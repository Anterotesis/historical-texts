<HEAD>A REVIEW OF THE MILITARY OPERATIONS IN <HI>NORTH AMERICA,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> ESTEEM myself highly honoured,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Introduc∣tion.</NOTE> when you request of me, a full account of the rise, progress, and present state, of the military operations in North America; with a just delineation of the characters of the principal agents in our political affairs. Indeed, my Lord, you impose a task that will require a Volume, rather than a Letter. As your Lordship's desire, however, shall always carry with me the force of a com∣mand, I will engage in it with the utmost chearfulness. Forgive me, my Lord, for saying I have a still stronger motive for com∣posing these sheets, than a mere compliance with your Lordship's request; to which I would ever pay the profoundest regard. When I reflect upon your eminent station—your excelling abi∣lities—your warm and active zeal, for the interest and welfare of the British colonies; I am prompted by an unfeigned desire of serving my country; and setting before your Lordship's eyes TRUTH, in her plain undisguised habiliments: I would strip
<PB N="6" REF="008163_0004_102E409C58571440"/>her of all that delusive colouring, with which she hath been art∣fully varnished, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-writers from this part of the world; either to subserve some mean sinister party design, or to promote the views of some aspiring and ambitions minds. Candour and integrity shall therefore guide my pen; and amidst the variety with which it is my purpose to present your Lordship, it shall be my sacred endeavour, to the best of my knowledge, to attach myself to the strictest — the most impartial verity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">American colanies too long neglected tho' of ge∣neral im∣portance.</NOTE> THE American colonies, I speak it with submission, my Lord, were too long neglected by their mother country; tho' loudly demanding her patronage and assistance. Those, on the conti∣nent, require her peculiar notice: They may be made an inex∣haustible magazine of wealth; and if suffered to fall into the hands of the French, such will be the accession to their already extended commerce and marine strength, that Great Britain must not only lose her former lustre, but, dreadful even in thought! cease to be any longer an independent power. Nay, should every other scheme fail, the success of this will inevitably accomplish the long∣projected design of that aspiring nation, for setting up an Uni∣versal Monarchy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for, if France rule the ocean, her resources will enable her to subject all Europe to her despotic sway. But it is unnecessary to offer any arguments in support of a proposi∣tion, of which the Public seems to remain no longer insensible. Happy for us, had these sentiments prevailed earlier, and been more frequently inculcated!</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">More con∣sidered, on the reduc∣tion of Louisburg.</NOTE> THE importance of the colonies, my Lord, was too little con∣sidered, till the commencement of the last war. The reduction of Cape Breton by the people of New-England, was an acquisition so unexpected and fortunate, that America became, on that re∣markable event, a more general topic of conversation. Mr. Shir∣ley, the governor of the Massachusetts B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, was the principal projector of that glorious enterprize: An enterprize, which re∣duced to the obedience of his Britannick Majesty, the DUNKIRK of North America. Of such consequence to the French, was the possession of that important key to their American settlements, that its restitution was, in reality, the purchase of the last general Peace in Europe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Gov. Shirley.</NOTE> OF all our plantation Governors, my Lord, Mr. Shirley is most distinguished for his singular abilities. He was born in Eng∣land,
<PB N="7" REF="008163_0005_102E40D2F5EF28D0"/>and bred up to the Law, at one of the Inns of Court. In that profession he afterwards practised, for several years, in the Massachusetts Bay: and, in 1741, was advanced by his Ma∣jesty to the supreme command of that colony. He is a Gen∣tleman of great political sagacity, deep penetration, and indefati∣gable industry. With respect to the wisdom and equity of his administration, he can boast the universal suffrage of a wise, free, jealous, and moral people. Tho' not bred to arms, he is emi∣nently possessed of these important military virtues — An ex∣tent of capacity to form and execute great designs; — pro∣found secresy; — love of regularity and discipline; — a fru∣gal and laborious manner of living; with the art of conciliating the affections; — a talent which Hannibal admired in Pyrrhus, above all the rest of his martial accomplishments. In the first of these great qualities, Mr. Shirley is universally acknowledged to shine: and it is, in reality, more estimable, than all other military endowments without it; consisting, to use the words of that discerning historian Mr. Rollin, <Q><HI>in having great views; in forming plans at a distance; in proposing a design, from which the author never departs; in concerting all the mea∣sures necessary for its success; in knowing how to seize the favourable moments of occasion, which are rapid in their course, and never return; to make even sudden and unforeseen accidents subservient to a plan; in a word, to be upon the watch against every thing, without being perplexed and dis∣concerted by any event.</HI></Q> But, whether it arises from his being so far advanced in years, or from his constitutional dis∣position and make, he has not, in my opinion, that activity and alertness so conducive to warlike expedition; and on which the success of an enterprize frequently depends. This was one of the characteristics of Braddock; a commander, vigorous in executing, as Mr. Shirly, judicious in contriving a plan— <HI>sed non <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia possumus-ownes</HI> — and 'tis easier, my Lord, to find active hands, than able heads.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hisatten∣tion to co∣lony af∣fairs.</NOTE> No man perhaps in the nation, has bestowed more attention, upon the state of the co∣lonies in general: and having their interest sincerely at heart, he has been perpetually concerting expedients, advancive of their prosperity, and to check the views of an all-grasping Mo∣narch. Upon the reduction of Louisburgh, he earnestly recom∣mended to his Majesty's minister, the demolition of that for∣tress,
<PB N="8" REF="008163_0006_102E409EE148C080"/>and an expedition against the French settlements in Ca∣nada. The reasons why he succeeded in neither of these pro∣posals,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is reward∣ed with a regiment and sent commissa∣ry to Paris</NOTE> I cannot take upon me to assign. His Majesty, how∣ever, sensible of his services, gave him a regiment in 1746; and upon the conclusion of the peace of Aix-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a-Chapelle, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt him as one of the British commissaries to Paris, for settling the controverted limits between the two Crowns in America. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> midst all the spendors and delicacies of Ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arllies, he forgot neither OUR interest, nor HIS duty. As a proof of his inte∣grity and diligence, during that fruitless embassy, one need only peruse these judicious and laborious memorials, in support of his Majesty's right to Nova Scotia which were principally framed by him; and lately published by order of the Lords of Trade, as a full exhibit of our title to that part of A∣merica. When no satisfaction could, in this way, be obtained from the Court of France; which was artfully endeavouring to spin out the negotiation, and at the same time fortifying the places in question, as well as making new acquisitions; the British commissaries retired from the French Court, and Mr. Shirley resumed his government in New-England in Au∣gust 1753.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The French en∣croach on Virginia</NOTE> THE French, jealous of the growth of the English colonies, were now meditating all possible arts to distress them, and ex∣tend the limits of their own frontier. The marquis Du Que<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, an enterprizing genius, was at this time invested with the su∣preme command of New France. Our provinces were quick∣ly alarmed by the French settlements, which he this year be∣gan on the banks of the Ohio. Virginia, appearing more im∣mediately concerned,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Message to the com∣mandant.</NOTE> Mr. Dinwiddie
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lieutenant Governor of Virginia.</NOTE> wrote, on the 31st of October, to the commandant of the French forces there, com∣plaining of sundry late hostilities: and desiring to know, by what authority an armed force had marched from Canada, and invaded a territory indubitably the right of his Brit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnic Ma∣jesty. Major Washington, a gentleman of whom I shall have occasion in the sequel to make honourable mention, was the bearer of this letter. He returned with an answer from Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. Legardeur De St. Pierre, dated at the fort on Beef River,
<PB N="9" REF="008163_0007_102E40D485794690"/>15 December, 1753; of which the following is an exact translation:</P>
<LETTER>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is an∣swe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed.</NOTE>
<P><HI>As I have the honour to command here in chief, Mr. Washington delivered me the letter, which you directed to the commandant of the French troops. I should have been pleased if you had given him orders, or if he himself had been disposed, to visit Canada and our general; to whom, rather than to me, it properly appertains to demonstrate the reality of the King my master's rights to lands situated along the Ohio, and to dispute the pretersions of the King of Great Britain in that respect.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I shall immediately forward your letter to Mons. Le Marquis Du Quesne. His answer will be a law to me: and if he directs me to communicate it to you, I assure you, Sir, I shall neglect nothing that ma be necessary to convey it to you with expedition.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As to the requisition you make (that I retire with the troops under my command) I cannot believe myself under any obligation to submit to it. I am here, in virtue of my general's orders; and I beg, Sir, you would not doubt a moment of my fixed resolution to conform to them, with all the exactitude and steadiness that might be expected from a better officer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I do not know that, in the course of this campaign, any thing has passed that can be esteemed an act of hostility, or contrary to the treaties subsisting between the two Crowns; the continuation of which is as interesting and pleasing to us, as it can be to the English. If it had been agreeable to you, Sir, in this respect, to have made a particular detail of the facts which occasion your com∣plaint, I should have had the honour of answering you in the most explicit manner; and I am persuaded you would have had reason to be satisfied.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have taken particular care to receive Mr. Washington, with all the distinction suitable to your dignity, and to his quality and great merit. I flatter myself that he will do me this justice, and join with me in testifying the profound respect with which I am,</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Virg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>man apply for aid to the colouies.</NOTE> ON the receipt of this resolute answer, Mr. Dinwiddie made instant complaint to the Court of Great Britain; and by alarming speeches laboured to rouze the Virginians into a vigorous opposi∣tion. He wrote also to the neighbouring governors, importuning the aid of the other colonie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for repelling the invasion, and erecting a sort at the confluence of the Ohio and Monongahela. An immediate junction in such measures became absolutely requisite for our common security. But the colonies, alas! were sunk into a profound lethergy; and, resigned to stupidity and slumbering, appeared insensible of the threatning danger. They contemned the power of Canada; confided in the number of their inhabitants; inattentive were they to the inconveniencies of an endless frontier; and in short intirely unacquainted with the situation of the inland country. The waters of the Ohio, before this period, were scarce known, save to a few Indian traders; and the generality deemed those French settlements too remote to be the object of dread, and a matter of insignificant moment.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">But they generally excused them∣selves.</NOTE> Accordingly, when application was made for succours to Virginia, conformable to directions from the ministry, some of our provincial Assemblies, particularly those of Pensylvania

<BIBL>Address of the general assembly to Lieut. Gov. De Lancey, 23 April, 1754.</BIBL></NOTE>, seemed even to question his Majesty's title to the lands usurped by the French. Others, to avoid their share in the burden, framed the most trifling excuses. New York, however, voted 5000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> currency in aid of Virginia; which, considering her own situation, and approaching distress, was no ungenerous contribution.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="008163_0009_102E40D91BDE4318"/>
THE Virginians nevertheless proceeded in their resolution of marching a body of troops to the protection of their frontiers:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces raised un∣der Col. Washing∣ton.</NOTE> and passed an act in February 1754, for raising 10,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and 300 men. The command was given to Col. Washington, a young gentleman of great bravery and distinguished merit. By his Majesty's direction, two of the regular independent companies of foot at New-York, were ordered to the frontier of that dominion. They imbarked for Virginia on board the Centaur man of war; which unfortunately did not sail from thence till the middle of June, and carried the money before mentioned to the assistance of that colony.</P>
<P>Col. WASHINGTON began his march,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who had a success∣ful skir∣mish with the enemy.</NOTE> at the head of his lit∣tle army, about the 1st of May. On the 28th he had a skir∣mish with the enemy, of whom ten were slain, and about twenty made prisoners. But this publick-spirited officer soon experi∣enced a reverse of fortune. Waiting for further reinforce∣ments, he was alarmed with an account, that 900 French and 200 Indians were advancing from the Ohio; who accordingly in two days after

Not a few thought it an artifice of Mr. Johnson's, who expecting to rise into importance, from the reputation of a mighty influence over the Indians, kept them from a punctual attendance; being very confident of a publick request to himself from the commissioners, to go up, and hasten their progress. There was the highest evidence of the like piece of policy at an Indian treaty, during Mr. Clin∣ton's administration.

<P>THE Indians being dismissed, the conferences were continued till the 11th of July. The commissioners were, both for a∣bilities and fortune, some of the most considerable men in North America. The speakers however were not many; but of those who spoke, some delivered themselves with sin∣gular energy and eloquence. All were inflamed with a patriot-spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, and the debates were nervous and pathetic. This as∣sembly, my Lord, might very properly be compared to one of the ancient Greek conventions, for supporting their expi∣ring liberty against the power of the Persian empire, or that LEWIS of Greece, Philip of Macedon. In the conclusion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plan of a union.</NOTE> a plan was concerted for a general union of the British colonies, and creating a common fund to defray all military expences; and a representation of their present state drawn up; which were agreed to be laid before the King's ministers.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Approved by all, ex∣cept De Lancey.</NOTE> though approved at the time by every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ember of the congress, except Mr. De Lancey. Unaccoun∣table was the conduct of this gentleman to several of the provincial deputies. But those who were best acquainted with his character and love of sway, ascribed his aversion from the plan, to an apprehension, that should the same take place, the supreme officer, who agreeably to it was to preside in the grand council of deputies from the respective colonies, would most probably be the governor of the Massachusetts Bay: An ap∣prehension, which repressed his own aspiring views; and it was imagined, stung him with unspeakable chagrin.</P>

<P>HE is the eldest branch of one of the first families in the province. His father, a French re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, a gentleman of distin∣guished rank in this city, and who here acquired a large for∣tune, sent him for his education to the University o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cam∣bridge.

In the year 1729 he was, by Governor Montgomery's recommenda∣tion, created one of his Majesty's Council of New York; but never engaged the publick attention, till the time of Mr. Cosby. He became then very famous. With this governor he took part in most or all of his measures — measures extremely arbitrary, and productive of an administration odious and tur∣bulent. Cosby, in return for his ministerial services, loaded him with favours. Deposing Chief Justice Morris (the main obstacle to his perilous projects) he raised him to the first seat on the bench
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. De Lancey was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> educated to the law; but having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pent some time, after his return from England, in the and of that science, Goy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y appointed him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd judge of the supreme Court of Judicature.</NOTE>. But tho' his excellency had the disposition of offices, he could by no means delegate the affections of the people. Accordingly, our politician was equally honoured and despised. He enjoyed the smiles of the gover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, which loaded him with the curses of the people; was caressed by the for∣mer, and by the latter abhorred. Cosby leaving a successor capable of governing without a pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pter, the chief justice found it necessary to deface the memory of his former conduct, by cultivating the arts of popularity. Mr. Clarke, who succeed∣ed
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">In March, 1736.</NOTE>, being perfectly master of our constitution, a gentleman of experience and penetration, and intimately acquainted with the temper of the people, in a short time reconciled all par∣ties;
<PB N="17" REF="008163_0015_102E40DEB54E54F0"/>and by restoring the public trenquility, rendered Mr. De L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncey's plo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding abilities utterly useless. Hence he was at full <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure to court the populace. Suddenly he became transformed into a patriot; and, strange to relate! without a single act of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>otism. His uncommon vivacity, with the semblance of aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lity and ease; his adroitness at a just, with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hew of condescension to his inferiors, wonderfully facili∣tated has progress. These plausible arts, together with his influence as Chief Justice, and a vast personal estate at use, all conspired to secure his popular triumph. To establish such an undue power, and amazing influence, would, in a Grecian commonwealth, have exposed a man of less ambition and bet∣ter principles to the ostracism. Mr. Clarke being superseded by Governor Clinton
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Clinton arrived as Governor, 22 Sept. 1743.</NOTE>, Mr. De Lancey was presented with a fresh opportunity for the exhibition of his political genius. Mr. Clinton, a gentleman of but indifferent parts, wholly re∣signed himself into his hands. Contenting himself with the title and salary of Governor, he left the sole direction of af∣fairs to his minister, who by virtue of his late acquired om∣nipotence with the assembly, carried all his points, and even endeared him to the people. This intimacy subsisted no longer than it was found conducive to his designs. Having obtain∣ed from Mr. Clinton a new commission for his office of Chief Justice <HI>during good behaviour;</HI> and flattering himself with the hopes of another, appointing him Lieut. Governor, through the interest of his friends in England, he cared not how soon his excellency abdicated the province, nor how tempestuous he rendered his administration; and was therefore prepared for an open rupture. He no sooner thought himself capable of acting independently of the governor, than like Sixtus Quin∣tus, who threw aside his cruthes the moment of his exalta∣tion to the popedom, he put off all that humble devotion, by which he had so fatally deceived his too credulous master, and openly set himself at defiance against him. Now he began to dictate, rather than advise: and instead of Sejanus, chose to be Tiberius himself. Dining one day with Mr. Clinton, and insisting upon some favourite point with great imperious∣ness,
<PB N="18" REF="008163_0016_102E40AAD920F3F0"/>the Governor, who had hitherto very cordially suffered himself to be led, refused on this occasion to be driven. The Chief Justice then arose and left him; declaring, with an oath, he would make his administration uneasy for the future: His Excellency replied, he might do his worst. Thus they parted; nor were ever afterwards reconciled. This breach gave rise to the contentions, which so unhappily imbroiled our pro∣vincial affairs, during the remainder of his administration. The assembly were instantly inflamed. He who before had been able to make them connive at very unjustifiable steps, could at once stir up an opposition to the most unexceptionable mea∣sures. Remonstrances, warm and virulent, were now drawn up; unworthy their own dignity to offer, and replete with the grossest language to his Majesty's representative. Thus was formed against Mr. Clinton a powerful party, which ceased not, while he continued at the helm, to harrass and perplex him. To such an exorbitant length did they carry their op∣position, as to throw off the restraint of humanity: They had even recourse to force and violence. Nay, a partisan of the Chief Justice, in defiance of the sacred rights of the magistra∣cy and the law — to shew his resentment against Mr. Clin∣ton and his adherents — assaulted the mayor; whipped the sheriff; damned the Governor; and stabbed his physician. My Lord, we became the sport and contempt of our neighbours; and it is beyond contradiction, that Mr. De Lancey, by blow∣ing up the coals of contention, did the province more injury, than he will be ever able to repair. Nor is their any reason to doubt, that the enorm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us power of this gentleman, and the ferment raised against Mr. Clinton, occasioned the 39th arti∣cle of the king's instructions to Sir Danvers Osborn; which appears purposely calculated to render our future Governors independent on his influence over the assembly: For a law indefinite, making provision for the salary allowed by the King to his Governors; and competent salaries to all judges, justices, and other necessary officers and ministers of government — such a law, I say, would effectually render a Governor inde∣pendent of the assembly, and consequently of any undue in∣fluence in it. Nor without such independence, or an abridgement of Mr. De Lancey's power, by reducing him to his primitive private station, do I see any probability of the extinction of that
<PB N="19" REF="008163_0017_102E40E394E8DFF0"/>party-spirit, which hath so long disturbed the tranquility, and injured the publick weal of the colony. Mr. Clinton, being superseded by Sir Danvers Osborn
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Danvers Osborn arrived at New York the 7th of October, 1753.</NOTE>, a gentleman of a most amiable moral character, retired into the country; from whence he proposed to embark for Great Britain. The Chief Justice, notwithstanding his long declared enmity, and unwearied in∣dustry to embarrass his administration, had now — the hu∣mility, shall I call it? — to dispatch a messenger to him, with design if possible to procure an accommodation — in order to secure his favour in England, when he could no longer distress him in America. It were difficult to determine, whether this required a higher degree of assurance or servili∣ty. But it is no uncommon thing, to behold the same per∣son fastidious and fawning, supercilious and sycophantic. Mr. Clinton, far from an implacable enemy, began to be softened; when his lady (who if born among the Scythians, had been the Thalestris of antiquity) unravelling the secret, frustrated at once all expectations of a composition; and gave the plenipo∣tentiary such a volley of invective against his constituent, as rendered all future overtures entirely hopeless.</P>

<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This happened on the 12th of October, 1753.</NOTE>,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His ap∣point∣ment to the go∣vernment and sys∣tem of politics.</NOTE> equally unexpected and deplored, Mr. De Lancey published the commission he had just received, appointing him Lieutenant Governor. He was now to act a part intirely new, and demanding the full ex∣ertion of his political dexterity. In the first place, he had to convince the ministry of his utmost efforts to carry the King's instructions in the house of representatives: And in the next, in order to preserve his popularity with the assembly, and not in the most flagrant manner counteract his avowed principles, he was to satisfy them, that in reality he by no means ex∣pected their compliance with them. To execute the former part of this plan — in his speech of the 31st of October, 1753. to the council and general assembly, he says,

THUS, my Lord, I have presented you with a faithful por∣trait of the Lieut. Governor of New York, who is to bear no small share in the public affairs, of which I have the honour to transmit your Lordship an account — a portrait, under which there had been no need of fixing a name to direct to the ori∣ginal, those who have the least knowledge of that gentleman's character.</P>
<P>WHILE these things were transacting at Albany, Mr. Pownal,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Mr. Tho¦mas Pow∣nal.</NOTE> brother to John Pownal, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> one of the secretaries to the Board of Trade, was upon the spot. This gentleman came over to America with Sir Danvers Osborn, in quality of his private secretary; though it was imagined by many, he was designed to be an assistant to him in the exercise of the go∣vernment. He is something of a scholar, but a confused rea∣soner; and in his stile perplexed; and in that usefullest of all sciences, the knowledge of mankind, he is a mere novitiate: without the latter, your Lordship knows that other acquire∣ments are comparatively of small account, in the management of public business. To be only learned, is frequently to be vain, ostentatious, and obstinate; such a one, in a word, as Tertullian describes the most learned among the heathens, "an animal of glory." This gentleman is fond of being consi∣dered <HI>in an important light.</HI> Insatiable of praise, he can not only hear himself flattered; but, what is more unaccountable in a man of tolerable sense, can flatter himself. He is a person of uncommon application, and a good memory. By dint of industry, and an access to the papers in the Plantation Board Office, he has acquired some knowledge of American affairs: but so keen is his appetite for promotion, that he cannot brook the thoughts of a gradual advancement. He is for galloping into preferment: and so intent on the contemplation of his future grandeur, as to lose all patience in earning it. Being more skilled in books than men, he is very abrupt in giving a scholastic turn to conversation, in order to display his erudition. Ever ready to contradict: himself impatient of contradiction. But wonderful is his knack at pluming himself with the schemes and inventions of others; and, with the daw in the fable, sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng in a borrowed dress: a remarkable instance of which I shall give your Lordship in the following anecdote; as
<PB N="26" REF="008163_0024_102E40B4F409BB48"/>characteristic of a person, who will appear to have had some considerable influence in the course of American transactions. During the sitting of the congress,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anec∣dotes re∣specting a piece he published.</NOTE> it was scarce possible to prevent part of their sentiments from transpiring. The scheme of a naval armament on Lake Ontario, projected by Lieut. Governor Clarke, before the late war; submitted to the then ministry; and now strongly recommended by the commissi∣oners of the Massachusetts Bay; by some means or other hap∣pened to be hinted without doors. Mr. Pownal, intent upon rising into significance among the colonies, chose not to slip so favourable an opportunity of distinguishing himself, as he could now lay hold of, from these whispered intelligences. He accordingly drew up some loose indigested proposals, with respect to American affairs. Among other trite sentiments, he urged this scheme as a new unthought-of measure, absolutely requisite to secure the command, and preserve the furr trade of those inland seas. This he delivered to some of the mem∣bers of the congress to be communicated: and afterwards trans∣mitted a copy to England; challenging to himself the sole merit of being the original author of so useful and necessary an expedient
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pownal had this piece published in New York in Feb. 1756. It contained an introduction, declaring, that copies of it were sent by the ministry to the respective governors of the colonies: and in the spring following, it was republished, with great oftentation, in the English magazines. With respect to those parts of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, where∣in he talks of Indian affairs, the sentiments seem to be unintelligi∣ble by a North-American understanding.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE the congress was held at Albany,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shirley e∣rects forts on Ken∣nebec.</NOTE> Governor Shirley, ever jealous of French machinations, proceeded, at the head of about one thousand men, to the river Kennebec; and e∣rected forts, at convenient distances, to stop the progress of the French on that quarter; to secure the possession of that country with the friendship of the eastern Indians.</P>
<P>THE remainder of this year was principally spent in repeat∣ed representations to the ministry, respecting the dangerous si∣tuation of the English colonies; and the absolute necessity of a

<P>On the welcome intelligence of the success of these repre∣sentations; and while <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were expecting from England; the two regiments or Shirley and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were ordered to be reestablished, and recru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were raising thro' the several go∣vernments, to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rm an army for dispossessing the French from their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate encroachments.</P>
<P>THE general assembly of the Massachusetts Bay being con∣vened,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Designs an expediti∣on against Crown Point.</NOTE> and the members sworn to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crecy; Mr. Shirley com∣municated to them a design of attacking Fort St. Frederic at Crown Point, the ensuing spring; and his intention to appoint Col. Johnson to the command of that expedition. The scheme being approved by the council and representatives of that pro∣vince, and the quotas settled, commissioners were charged to the neighbouring governments, to sollicit their concurrence and aid, in the prosecution of this enterprize.</P>
<P>WHILE these matters were in agitation. Mr. Pownal was at Boston, intending to sail from thence to England. He now thought fit to change his resolution; and Governor Shirley ho∣noured him with the embassy to New York, for which place he set out the beginning of March. Some gentlemen of the council and assembly were commissioned, on the like errand, to the other colonies of New Jersey, Pensylvania, &amp;c.</P>
<P>MR. POWNAL's prospects of success at New-York were at first not very encouraging.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Lancey endea∣vours to obstruct the con∣currence of New York.</NOTE> De Lancey, jealous of Shirley's rising reputation, appeared, with regard to the expedition recommend∣ed, extremely phlegmatic: and tho' artful enough to abstain from an open opposition, he made use of Mr. Chambers as his tool in council, to obstruct the concurrence of the legislature. At this time great animosities were prevailing in the province, occasioned by a charter just before granted by Mr. De Lan∣cey, constituting a college for the education of youth, upon a foundation which happened to enkindle the general disgust. The majority of the house, apprehending the loss of their seats on a future election, should they afford it the least assistance,
<PB N="28" REF="008163_0026_102E40B68802F2F8"/>found themselves obliged rather to countenance the popular re∣sentment. A gentleman of distinction, with whom Mr. Pownal advised on the subject of his commission, thought it a pru∣dent step to open his message in part, to those members of the assembly, who, on the above-mentioned account, were then in the opposition. Several of the leading men were secured by this method:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">But in vain.</NOTE> and when the house met, such a disposition appeared to join in the scheme proposed, that it was beyond Mr. De Lancey's power to obstruct it. Out of pique howe∣ver to Mr. Shirley, to whom this expedition was solely com∣mitted, he prevailed upon them to suspend the execution of their vote, until General Braddock's approbation was obtained: and by this artifice occasioned a considerable delay in the ope∣rations.</P>
<P>GENERAL BRADDOCK,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Braddock convenes the go∣vernors, and settles the opera∣tions.</NOTE> being now arrived in Virginia, sent expresses to the several governors to meet him, in order to a consultation on the business of the approaching campaign.— This convention was opened on the 14th of April
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was at first proposed to have been held at Annapolis in Mary∣land. Mr. Shirley, who thro' the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of his affairs did not arrive there till April, has been charged with delaying Braddock's march near three weeks; tho' it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us, <HI>that</HI> delay was occa∣sioned by the failure of the Virginia contract for the necessary sup∣plies. The general was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to enter into a new one with gentlemen in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> till the 27th of May, near six weeks from the conclusion of the congress.</NOTE>, at A∣lexandia in Virginia. Here it appeared, that thro' misrepre∣sentations from Virginia, the general was inj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined to proceed im∣mediately to Fort Du Quesne. Those who were well acquainted with the country, could not help observing, that a march from Potowmac, across the Allegheny mountains, must be attended with incredible difficulty, hazard, and expence — that the vi∣cinity of New York to Canada — its fort of Oswego on Lake Ontario — together with the advantages of water carriage — rendered that province by far the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> theatre of action. Brad∣dock's orders were nevertheless positive. — For the preserva∣tion therefore of Oswego, and the reduction of Niagara, it was at length agreed, that Shirley's and Pepperel's regiments should
<PB N="29" REF="008163_0027_102E40F0E5B8E028"/>proceed to Lake Ontario, — while General Braddock attack∣ed Fort Du Quesne — and the provincial troops, commanded by General Johnson, marched to invest Crown Point.</P>
<P>THESE resolutions being taken,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shirley returns to Boston, to prepare for the Northern Expediti∣ons.</NOTE> Mr. Shirley began his journey to Boston, to prepare for the expedition under his immediate command; to forward that under Col. Johnson; and to quicken the departure of the New England troops, now assembled by his Majesty's directions, for reducing the French settlements in Nova Scotia. On his way, he spent some time in conference with Col. Schuyler, a gentleman of fortune and courage, who, out of disinterested love to his country, was engaged to head a regiment of 500 men, raised and maintained by the province of New Jersey. In New York, he was retarded a few days to consult with General Johnson, and remove some objections made by Mr. De Lancey to the form of his commission:
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Johnson had his commission from the governors of the provinces, which furnished the troops under his command; the draft of which was settled at Alexandria. The Lieut Governor of New York now thought proper to repeat those very objections, which had been there over-ruled. This unaccountable conduct gave Mr. Johnson great un∣easiness, who could not obtain Mr. De Lancey's commission, till pro∣per notice was taken by General Shirley of so manifest an obstruction to the operations of the campaign.</NOTE> and in Connecticut, to hasten the assembling the troops of that colony
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Connecticut had voted one thousand men for the Crown Point expe∣dition and given assurances of 500 more, if the service so required. New York was to supply 800; but thro' the delay occasioned by the suspending clause above men soned in the vote of our assembly, Mr. De Lancey's brother was sent into Connecticut, to obtain leave for recruiting the quota we were to furnish, in that colony; as men might there be raised more speedily than in the province of New York. Mr, Shirley being at Hartford, during this application, was told h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Governor Fitch, that if Connecticut complied, they should consider themselves disengaged from the assurances given of 500 more than their own quota, did the service demand it. This, with Mr. Oliver De Lancey's declaration — that if himself should accept the command of the New York regiment, he could in ten days raise the whole number in this province, induced Mr Shirley to oppose the ap∣plication; it appearing to him not improbable, that the service might afterwards require the reinforcement offered. In consequence of which, only 300 recruits were furnished New York from thence — A lucky incident for M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Shirley's adversaries to incense the people of New York against him; to which purpose it was industriously applied, tho' his conduct in that affair was prudent and rational; and tho' by repeated letters to Lieut. Governor De Lancey, he took pains to re∣move any misunderstanding at a juncture so unseasonable.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="008163_0028_102E40BB462FFC00"/>
THE necessary dispatches being given to the expedition to Nova Scotia under Col. Winslow, Mr. Shirley, upon the arri∣val of the paymaster for the northern district, returned to New York;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">And sails for Alba∣ny.</NOTE> and on the 4th of July sailed for Albany, his own Regiment having passed by for that place, in twenty-one tran∣sports, a few days before.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nova Scotia re∣duced.</NOTE> the colonies were filled with universal joy, on the agreeable news that the New England troops were be∣come masters of Beau-sejour and Bay Verte, on the isthmus of Nova Scotia; whereby a new province was added to the British empire in America: and that a strong fleet, under Admiral Boscawen, lay before Louisburgh, to intercept the French supplies; and which had also seized two of their capital ships, the Lys and Alcide, and sent them into Halifax.</P>
<P>GENERAL BRADDOCK was now on his march towards the Ohio,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Braddock marches from Fort Cumber∣land</NOTE> at the head of about 2200 men, in order to invest Fort Du Quesne, and drive the French from their encroachments on the frontiers of Virginia and Pensylvania. From Fort Cumber∣land to Fort Du Quesne, the distance is not less than 130 miles. Mr. Braddock began his march from the former on the 10th of June; leaving the garrison under the command of Col. Innes. Innumerable were the difficulties he had to surmount, in a country rugged, pathless, and unknown, across the Allegheny mountains, thro' unfrequented woods, and dangerous defiles. From the little meadows the army proceeded in two divisions. At the head of the first, consisting of 1400 men, was the ge∣neral himself, with the greatest part of the ammunition and ar∣tillery. The second, with the provisions, stores, and heavy bag∣gage, was led by Col. Dunbar. Never was man more confi∣dent of success, than this brave, tho' unfortunate officer. Be∣ing advised at the great meadows, that the enemy expected a reinforcement of 500 regular troops, he pushed on by forced
<PB N="31" REF="008163_0029_102E40F36F354BF0"/>marches, with so much dispatch, that he fatigued the soldiers, weakened his horses, and lest his second division near 40 miles in the rear. The enemy being not more than 200 strong at their fort on the Ohio, gave no obstruction to the much of our forces, till the memorable 9th of July — a day never to be forgotten in the Annals of North America. About noon our troops passed the Monagahela, and were then within seven miles of Fort Du Quesne. — Unapprehensive of the approach of an enemy, at once was the alarm given, by a quick and heavy fire upon the vanguard, under Lieut. Col. Gage. Im∣mediately the main body, in good order and high spirits, ad∣vanced to sustain them. Orders were then given to halt, and form into battalia. At this juncture the van falling back upon them, in great confusion, a general panic seized the whole body of the soldiery; and all attempts to rally them proved ut∣terly ineffectual. The general and all the officers exerted their utmost activity, to recover them from the universal surprize and disorder: but equally deaf were they to intreaties and com∣mands. During this scene of confusion, they expended their ammunition in the wildest and most unmeaning fire. Some discharging their pieces on our own parties, who were advanced from the main body for the recovery of the cannon. After three hours spent in this melancholy situation, enduring a terrible slaughter, from (it may be said) an <HI>invisible</HI> foe, orders were given to found a retreat, that the men might be brought to cover the waggons. These they surrounded but a short space of time: for the enemy's fire being again warmly renewed from the front and left flank, the whole army took to imme∣diate flight; leaving behind them all the artillery, provisions, ammunition, baggage, military chest, together with the general's cabinet, containing his instructions and other papers of conse∣quence. So great was the consternation of the soldiers, that it was impossible to stop their career, flying with the utmost precipitation three miles from the field of action; where only one hundred began to make a more orderly retreat.</P>
<P>WHAT was the strength of the enemy, has hitherto remained to us uncertain. According to Indian accounts, they exceeded not 400, chiefly Indians: and whither any were slain, is still to be doubted, for few were seen by our men, being covered
<PB N="32" REF="008163_0030_102E40BDD1964DD8"/>by stumps and fallen trees. Great indeed was the destruction on our side. — Numbers of officers sacrificed their lives thro' singular bravery. Extremely unfortunate was the whole staff. The general, after having five horses shot under him received a wound in his lungs thro' his right arm, of which he died in four days. His Secretary, eldest son of Major General Shirley, a gentleman of great accomplishments, by a shot thro' the head, was killed upon the spot. Mr. Orme and Capt. Morris, aid-de-camps, were all wounded. Of the 44th regi∣ment, Sir Peter Halket, Colonel, was slain, with several other officers; and Lieut. Col. Gage wounded. Lieut. Col. Burton, of the 48th regiment, was among the wounded; and many gallant officers perished in the field. Our whole loss was about seven hundred killed and wounded.</P>
<P>To what causes this unhappy catastrophe is to be ascribed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">To what causes the defeat was ascribed</NOTE> has been matter of much inquiry and animated debate. The officers charged the defeat to the cowardice of the men: but, in a representation they made to Mr. Shirley, by order of the Crown, they in some measure apologize for their behaviour— alledging, that they were harrassed by duties unequal to their numbers, and dispirited thro' want of provisions: That time was not allowed them to dress their food: That their water (the only liquor too they had) was both scarce and of a bad quality: In fine, that the provincials had disheartned them, by repeated suggestions of their fears of a defeat, should they be attacked by Indians; in which case the European method of fighting would be intirely unavailing. But, my Lord, however censurable the conduct of the soldiery may be thought, Mr. Braddock, too sanguine in his prospects, was generally blamed for neglecting to cultivate the friendship of the Indians, who offered their assistance; and who, it is certain, had a number of them preceded the army, would have seasonably discovered the enemy's ambuscade. The Virginian rangers also, instead of being made to serve as regulars is the ranks with the English troops, should have been employed as out scouts. But this step, so necessary to guard against surprize, was too unhappily omitted; the whole army, according to the representation above mentioned, following only <HI>three or four guides.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="008163_0031_102E40F5F8E0BEC8"/>

Your Lordship might naturally expect to hear, that Col. Dunbar then intrenched himself, and called on the neighbouring colonies for immediate reinforcements;— as by such a step the enemy might have been detained at Fort Du Quesne, prevented from ravaging the frontiers, or throwing succours into Niagara. But alas! my Lord, an infa∣tuation seemed to accompany all our measures on the southern quarter. Fearful of an unpursuing foe, all the ammunition, and so much of the provisions were destroyed, for accellera∣ting their flight, that Dunbar was actually obliged to send for thirty horse loads of the latter, before he reached Fort Cum∣berland—where he arrived a very few days after, with the shattered remains of the English troops.</P>

<P>ALBANY, my Lord, was the grand theatre of all the prepa∣rations for the northern expedition against Fort St. Frederick, as well as that to the westward for the reduction of Niagara. The general, on his arrival there, found not the former in the forwardness he had reason to expect. The provincials discon∣tended with the inactivity of a long encampment, Major Gene∣ral Lyman was obliged to make short marches, to prevent their disbanding;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is detain∣ed at Al∣bany.</NOTE> and the general was therefore detained awhile in that city, to hinder so fatal an event. His own troops in the mean time were filing off, in different division, from She∣nectady, towards Oswego.</P>

At the battle Falls, the portage ex∣ceeds not a mile; the ground being marshy will admit of no wheel-carriage, and therefore the Germans who reside here, trans∣port the battoes in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which they keep for that purpose. The same conveyance is used at the Great Carrying-Place, sixty miles beyond the Little Falls; all the way to which the cur∣rent is still adverse, and extremely shift The portage here is longer or shatter, according to the dryness or we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness of the seasons. In the last summer months, when rains are not fre∣quent, it is usually six or eight miles across. Taking water again, we enter a narrow rivulet, called the Wood-creek, which leads into the Oneida Lake, distance forty miles. This stream, tho' favourable, being shallow, and its banks covered with thick woods, was at this time much obstructed with old logs and fallen trees. The Oneida Lake stretches from east to west about thirty miles, and in calm weather is passed with great facility. At its western extremity opens the Onondaga River, leading down to Oswego, situated at its entrance on the south side of the Lake Ontario. Extremely difficult and hazardous is the pas∣sage thro' this river, as it abounds with rifts and rocks; and the current flowing with surprizing rapidity. The principal ob∣struction is twelve miles short of Oswego, and is a fall of a∣bout eleven feet perpendicular. The portage here is by land, not exceeding forty yards, before they launch for the last time.</P>
<P>YOUR LORDSHIP, from this account, will readily conceive, that thro' such a long amphibious march an army must pro∣ceed with prodigious risque and fatigue; and the battoes be necessarily conducted by persons skilled in the navigation, and e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ured to hardships. For this service General Shirley had en∣gaged all the young men in the county of Albany, who for∣merly had been employed in the Indian trade at Oswego: and a vast number of battoes were prepared for the conveyance of the troops, stores, and provisions.</P>

OSWEGO was formerly garrisoned by twenty five men; but on the commencement of our present disputes, the number was augmented to fifty. Early this spring fifty more were ordered up: and about the latter end of May, Capt. Broadstreet arrived there with 200, besides workmen to be employed in the naval preparations, pursuant to the scheme concerted in the congress of commissioners at Albany the last summer.</P>

This struck a general damp on the spirits of the soldiers, and many deserted. Great numbers of the battoe-men dispersed themselves into the country, and fled to their respective habitations. To engage the return of above half the fugitives, equally ineffectual were threats or promises, rewards or punishments. The general, however, sensible of the importance of the service, pursued his march in spite of every vexatious disappointment. As he passed their coun∣try, he called upon the Indians of the Six Nations at some of their castles; and sent embassadors to the rest, pressing them to join him, with assurances of his protection.

And partly thro' re∣peated frauds, and the omission of proper measures to conciliate their favour, our interest with them amounted to little more than a bare neutrality. Mr. Johnson nevertheless pretending a mighty influence over them,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Johnson holds a conference with them.</NOTE> was intrusted with 5000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling, in order to engage their assistance for the general benefit of his Majesty's service.

YOUR LORDSHIP is pleased to insist upon my <Q><HI>descending into a detail of every transaction, how minute soever, that can give any light into the more secret springs of our political action.</HI></Q> I shall therefore acquaint your Lordship, that upon the general's arrival at Albany,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anecdote of John¦son and Shirley.</NOTE> Mr. Johnson laid before him a copy of the minutes of his late treaty with the Indians. These minutes, it seems, contained some unhandsome reflections upon his excellency; insinuating, that to treat seperately with them, he had employed one Lydius, a person of not the most unex∣ceptionable character, either for loyalty or integrity. The single reason upon which the surmise could be founded was this. Ly∣dius, who formerly lived near Lake George, and whose Indian acquaintance was very extensive, had offered the general his as∣sistance, in procuring the junction of a number of them, on the designed expeditions. Upon which he wrote to Mr. John∣son, intimating the pleasure it would give him, if he could make any use of this man in his Majesty's service. On delivering those minutes into the general's hands, Johnson, sensible of the insinuation, told him, he intirely disapproved the reflection they seemed to contain, and appeared ashamed of its insertion. Hav∣ing perused the paper, Shirley could not avoid complaining of the ill usage; while the other with solemn vows protested, he was not privy to it, and importuned him to return the minutes, that he might erase the obnoxious passage. The former confi∣ded in the sincerity of his protestations, but soon after had a∣bundant reason to distrust his integrity.</P>
<P>THE general had applied to one Staats, who resided near Al∣bany, and had a considerable interest with the Indians of Stock∣bridge
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stockbridge, by the Indians called Housat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ue, lies upon the western confines of the Massachusetts Bay, in the eastern parts of the province of New York.</NOTE>. He proposed to him his raising a company of them, as a guard to the battoes in their passage to Oswego. Pri∣vately was this man intimidated from the undertaking: and Mr. Johnson, to induce him to break thro' his promises, of∣fered him a captain's commission, could he engage an Indian com∣pany to proceed on the expedition under his own direction.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="008163_0035_102E40FB1BB8E0C8"/>
YOUR LORDSHIP, being already informed of this gentleman's appointment to the command of the provincial army, by the interest of General Shirley, will scarce have patience at the re∣cital of a conduct so astonishing and ungrateful. The secret, my Lord, was this —Mr. Johnson was never distinguished for his sense or penetration.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Faction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed against the gene∣ral, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>son of it.</NOTE> He had now for his aid-de-camp Capt. Wraxal, a man of art and genius, who a few years before had been appointed secretary for Indian affairs, and clerk of the city and county of Albany. Governor Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton had granted a com∣mission for the latter of those offices, before the date of Wraxal's sign manual. A suit was therefore commenced, and is still de∣pending between him, and the person in possession of the office, suspended on the determination of a point of law. Upon this account Wraxal became a humble dependant on Lieut. Gover∣nor De Lancey, before whom, unless superseded in the chief com∣mand, the case must be determined upon a writ of error: The latter, who had been a declared enemy to Johnson, throughout the whole of Clinton's administration, and had even prevented the assembly from discharging a very equitable demand he had against the province for services and disbursements, now deter∣mined to fall in with, and set him up, in competition with Shir∣ley. Wraxal's post and dependance afforded a fine opportunity for the purpose: and so Johnson became strongly attached to the Lieut. Governor. Your Lordship will no longer wonder at his procuring all the Indians he could prevail upon,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Evil effects<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of 11.</NOTE> to join the provincial troops under his own command; or at his at∣tempts to excite others to embarrass and obstruct the general's designs upon the Lake Ontario. In support of a charge so heavy as this, I think it incumbent upon me to assign the following instances: 1. Not an Indian joined General Shirley at Schenecta∣dy, agreeably to Mr. Johnson's positive assurances. 2. Nor at either of the castles in the five cantons, as he passed thro' them to Oswego: but, on the contrary; 3. One Bant, an Onondaga (three of whose sons were in Johnson's army) at the head of several other In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ians, declared to Mr. Shirley at Oswego, that it was a place of trade and peace — that there should be no war there — and that he should not disturb the French; ad∣ding that he was going with the like message to Canada. The general having convinced him, that the expulsion of the French from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> encroachments must redound to the advantage of the
<PB N="38" REF="008163_0036_102E40C26A78AE40"/>Six Nations; he asserted, that Mr. Johnson had sent them upon this embassy to Canada. Tho' this appeared utterly incredible, 'tis nevertheless certain, 4. several other Indians arrived from the Onondaga castle, with a belt, declaring it to have been sent them by Mr. Johnson, with his request, that not a man of them would join the King's troops, under the command of General Shirley. 5. Others also, from the Seneca, Oneida, and Cayuga cantons concurred in the like reports; particularly one Redhead, an In∣dian of great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame, and a speaker at the late congress at Mount-Johnson, came to Oswego, in his way to Oswagatic or la Gall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tte, and desired the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssation of all military designs; affirming, that with the same request he was going to the French.</P>
<P>IT was with difficulty, my Lord, these Indians were reconci∣led to our attempts, detained at Oswego, and thereby prevented from communicating our operations to the enemy. The general, from these instances, became more and more suspicious, that the faction at New York were endeavouring to embarrass and im∣pede his measures. What farther confirmed his suspicions, that the Lieut. Governor of New York, with that view, made Mr John∣son his instrument, was a letter, which after his arrival at Oswego he received from the latter wherein he justified that very aspersion before disavowed, contained in the minutes above recounted.</P>
<P>MY LORD, we will now leave Mr. Shirley at Oswego; and pursue the course of transactions, as well at New York, as in the southern colonies.</P>
<P>DUNBAR,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dunbar ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ches t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Phila∣delphia.</NOTE> having reached Fort Cumberland, dispatched an In∣dian express to General Shirley, with an account with the defeat, and the necessary returns respecting the troops under his command; acquainting him, moreover, with his intention of marching to Philadelphia, and his hopes of meeting his orders at Shippens∣burgh. About the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame time Mr. Dinwiddie wrote to Dunbar, proposing a second attempt on Fort Du Quesne. But a council being thereupon held, the members of which were Col. Dunbar, Lieut. Col. Gage. Governor Sharpe, Major Chapman, Major Spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke, and Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> John St. Clair, it was unanimously conceived, that Mr. Dinw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s scheme was impracticable. The very next day, being the second of August, Dunbar began his march to∣wards
<PB N="39" REF="008163_0037_102E40FDA4616E48"/>Philadelphia, with 1600 men, four six-pounders,

At this sudden departure of the forces, the Virginians were extremely disobliged, as not only exposing their frontiers, and occasioning the daily desertion of their provincials; but because the enemy, in flying parties pene∣trated into the province, and on many of the inhabitants com∣mitted robberies and murder. What judgment ought to be form∣ed of this retreat, I leave your Lordship to determine. Certainly those southern colonies ought to have strengthened General Brad∣dock with a large body of provincial forces, which had doubt∣less prevented all this effusion of blood and treasure — the fatal consequence of their ill judged parsimony <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Upon the advices received from Dunbar,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another attempt on Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t DuQuesne proposed.</NOTE> Mr. Shirley gave orders for renewing the attempt, if the southern colonies would readily afford him a competent reinforcement.</P>
<P>GOVERNOR MORRIS having convened the Pensylvania assembly,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">But Pen∣sylvania with∣holds her Aid.</NOTE> informed them of the retreat of our army, and in a well-drawn pathetic speech, pressed them to the most vigorous measures for the defence of their borders. They proceeded so far as to vote for raising 50,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> but offering a bill for taxing the proprie∣tary-estate, an immediate rupture ensued, of which your Lord∣ship is long since acquainted, by the ample accounts in sundry late pamphlets on that and similar subjects.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Virginia provides for her frontier Defence alone.</NOTE> As to Virginia — now equally open to the irruptions of the enemy, four companies of rangers were ordered out, and the assembly voted 40,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> for furnishing a thousand men for the frontier defence. About the same time, met the council and assembly of New Jersey, and the latter voted 30,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> for the publick service:

Schuyler. At New York, the house of re∣presentatives assembled on the 5th of August,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Lancey manage∣ment with respect to the rein∣forcement.</NOTE> and set out with a generous spirit. Agreeable to the request of the Massachusetts Bay government, always foremost in military affairs, they resol∣ved to reinforce the provincial army, destined for Crown Point, with 400 men. The bill was actually passed the house for that
<PB N="40" REF="008163_0038_102E40C6EBDB3FC8"/>purpose; and the council had determined to conceal from their knowlege, the contents of a second letter from Gen. Shirley to Col. Dunbar, of the 7th of August, in which he ordered him to proceed with his troops to Albany, for the protection of that important post, in case the colony forces should meet with a re∣pulse. By this bill the assembly proposed to invest the respec∣tive captains of the city militia with an arbitrary power to draught men for the service. The design of this extraordinary project was suspected to serve a particular purpose, on a new election of representatives, which, according to custom, it was thought would immediately ensue the arrival of Sir Charles Hardy, who was soon expected with a commission for the chief command of this province. It certainly was a favourite bill; for, contrary to precedent, the Lieut. Governor came to the council board
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of Governor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, it was customary for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, even when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tting in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of that b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anch of the legislature.</NOTE>, and pressed them to pass it: but when he perceived an amendment preparing for a ballot of the recruits in New York, as well as in the other counties, he immediately laid the general's letter to Dunbar before the house — in consequence of which, the design of a reinforcement instantly dropped, and the assembly adjour∣ned the next day.</P>
<P>AFTER what I have already recounted,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His influ∣ence over the assem∣bly.</NOTE> your Lordship will not, I presume, be at all surprized, to find Mr. De Lancey leaving no device untried, to maintain the sole direction of the assembly. He knew that on his interest with the representatives depended hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> credit with the ministry; and that with the expiration of his power to carry certain points of prerogative, would also expire their opinion of his importance. His agents in England, to sup∣port their patron, had hitherto amused a certain noble Lord with many specious promises. They had represented his capacity to serve the Crown in very magnificent terms; nor forget his rea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness to procure, whenever an opportunity presented, the obe∣dience of the house to some favourite instructions. Hence it is evident, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of his ascendancy over that branch of the leg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>slature, must naturally terminate in the extinction of his gran∣deur derived from the Crown.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="008163_0039_102E410124A6B890"/>
WHILE he held the reins of government, assumed on Sir Dan∣vers Osborne's decease, the ministry had none to inspect his con∣duct, or trace him thro' the mazy labyrinth of his politics. From himself came all their intelligence, and hence undoubted∣ly none in his own disfavour. During these golden days of security and repose, he resigned himself to pleasure, and indul∣ged his natural disposition to voluptuousness and ease. The province, the mean while, was principally governed by his se∣cretary; who like a second Atlas, bore the chief burden of the state. Thus negligent of his politics, his popularity began to suffer a manifest declension.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> It was moreover notably abridg∣ed by his passing the charter before mentioned, repugnant by his own confession, to the dictates of his judgment. By this step he incurred such general umbrage, that the very members of the assem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y could not be wrought upon to confirm it. Nay, so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the people was this charter, that a ma∣jority of the must reputable inhabitants united against it in a petition to the house. Civil liberty, and by some, even the rights of conscience were imagined to be in danger; and the opposition being, as it were, <HI>pro aris &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cis,</HI> was extremely animated. The Lieut. Governor became now apprehensive of the consequence. He stood upon the point of resigning his command to a successor hourly expected; and, without re∣gaining h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seat as chief justice, his popularity appeared de∣scending from its meridian: nor, in case of a dissolution was he insensible his authority with the house must suffer a total eclipse. Your Lordship cannot therefore but observe, of what moment it was, to secure the friendship of the next governor. Permit me to mention the arts, whereby it was accomplished.</P>
<P>SIR CHARLES HARDY arrived in our harbour on the 2d of September 1755.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> The council immediately convened themselves for his reception. In the midst of their consultations, Mr. O∣liver De Lancey, without leave of the board, bolts into the chamber, and modestly interposes his advice, to send a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ge to Sir Charles, requesting his continuance in the ship, till the next morning. The reason assigned was, to gain time for drawing out the militia, to receive his excellency at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, with the formality and honour due to his rank. But the true secret was, to gain an opportunity for the Lieut. Governor,
<PB N="42" REF="008163_0040_102E40CA745B84C8"/>and a select juncto, to pass the evening with him, in order to conciliate his graces, and give him early impressions in fa∣vour of their party. The next day, the governor published his commission; and was, by Mr. De Lancey, invited to a public entertainment. In the evening they conducted him to the common, to hear the acclamations of the people; and on every occasion, followed him with servile court and adulation. To impress a high sense of his predecessor's popularity, they spared no pains. For this purpose also they intrigued with the assembly, and city corporation, two elective bodies, and thence under his influence. Of the latter, Mr. Oliver De Lancey, as alderman, was a member; and, with true fraternal affection, stimulated the board to insert in their address a compliment to his brother. A modest motion, my Lord! and so vehe∣mently urged, that it was carried, tho' not without some op∣position. The burden of that momentous passage, without which the whole had been jejune and insipid, was discharged in these terms — <Q><HI>We have the greatest reason to expect the continuation of that wise and happy administration, we have been blest with some time past.</HI></Q> Still greater was Mr. De Lancey's interest in the assembly, as I have already had the honour to acquaint your Lordship. But one gentleman in that house op∣posed the flattery of their address. He is a man of an af∣fluent independent fortune, a bold unshackled spirit, and of strong natural parts. The address was calculated to secure De Lancey's power both with governor and people: the former, by displaying to Sir Charles his formidable interest in that house: the latter by preventing a dissolution; than which no∣thing was the object of greater dread. <Q><HI>It has, Sir, (these are the expressions) been usual in this colony, at the accession of a new governor, to give the people an opportunity of a new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

<P><Q><HI>THE importance of the business under our consideration, and the dispatch necessary to accomplish it, will plead our excuse to your excellency, for not being earlier in this address.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="008163_0041_102E4102AF0B4238"/>
<Q><HI>And here, Sir, we should have ended, were we not in justice bound to pay some acknowlegement to the administration of your excel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ency's predecessor the Lieut.

<P>MR. DE LANCEY is one of the most fortunate of men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> While the people impatiently expected a dissolution, an express arrived on the 12th of September, with a confused, but a∣larming account of an action at Lake George. This rendered it necessary for Sir Charles Hardy immediately to proceed to Albany. Thither the Lieut. Governor accompanied him, and had thereby a fair opportunity to ingrose and cajole him. I shall suspend the relation of his success, till I have laid before your Lordship the progress of the provincial army, and their repulse of the French.</P>
<P>MAJOR GEN. LYMAN, being advanced with the troops to the Carrying-Place, about 60 miles from Albany, was waiting the arrival of General Johnson, who set out from thence on the 8th of August, with the train of artillery.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lyman builds a fort at the Car∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>act.</NOTE> Lyman had begun a fort at the landing, on the east side of Hudson's River, now called Fort Edward. About the latter end of the month, Gen. Johnson, with the main body, moved forward 14 miles more northerly, and pitched his camp at the south end of Lake George, before called St. Sacrament. By some Indians, who had been sent out as scouts, he received the following ad∣vices: — That they had discovered a party of French and Indians at Tinonderoge, situate on the isthmus between the north end of Lake George and the southern part of Lake Cham∣plain, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> miles on this side Crown Pea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; but that no works were there thrown up. To have secured this pass, which com∣manded the route to Crown Point thro' the Lake, had been a measure extremely adviseable. Mr. Johnson, informed of its importance, on the 1st of September wrote to Gen. Shirley, that he was impatient to get up his battoes; proposing then to proceed with part of the troops, and seize upon that pass. The French however took advantage of the delay, and cut out work enough for him at his own camp.</P>

A dreadful resolution, my Lord! And had he succeeded — I tremble at the thought — had he succeeded. But the supreme Disposer of events had not yet de∣voted us to ruin; and therefore, like the counsels of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ite∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, blasted the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anguinary purpose. —</P>
<P>FOR the execution of this design, he embarked at Fort St. Fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> with 2000 m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n in battoes, and landed at the South Bay
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t 16 miles from the English <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>. Of this movement, Gen. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had not the least intimation, till his scouts discovered their actual departure from the South Bay towards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort Edward. By an English prisoner the baron was told that the Fort was defenceless, and our camp at the Lake, when he left it a few days before, without lines,
<PB N="45" REF="008163_0043_102E410545CCA650"/>and destitute of cannon. Having approached within two miles of Fort Edward, he opened his design to his troops, consis∣ting of 600 militia, as many Indians, and 200 regulars.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His irre∣gulars a∣verse to the attack of Fort Edward.</NOTE> To animate his irregulars, who seemed disinclined to the attack pro∣posed, he assured them, that inevitable must be their success — <Q>that on reducing this fort, the English camp must necessarily be abandoned, and their army disperse in great disorder — that this would enable them to subdue Albany; and by star∣ving the garrison of Oswego, superadd to their conquest the absolute dominion of Ontario.</Q> With whatever intrepidity this harangue inspired his European troops, the Canadians and savages, fearful of our cannon, were utterly averse to the scheme; but declared their willingness to surprize our camp, where they expected nothing beyond musquetry
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Our artillery was got up to the camp from Fort Edward but a day or two before the action, of which the French had no intelligence.</NOTE>. Thus disappointed in his principal design, he changed his route, and began to move against the main body at the Lake. Gen. Johnson,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He moves against our camp.</NOTE> on the information of his scouts, had dispatched separate messengers to Fort Edward, with advice of the enemy's approach towards that garrison; of which one was unfortunately intercepted: the rest who got back, reported, that they had descried the enemy about four miles to the northward of the fort. Instead of any attempt to discover the strength of the guard left with their battoes at the South Bay, which might easily have been cut off, a council of war resolved the next morning to detach 1000 men, with some Indians, to fall upon, or, as Mr. Johnson expresses it in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is letter to the several governors "to <HI>catch,</HI> the enemy in their retreat." On this service commanded Col. Williams, a brave Officer, who met the baron within four miles of our camp.</P>
<P>THE English, my Lord, were encamped on the banks of Lake George, being covered on either side by a low thick∣wooded swamp. After the march of the detachment, Gen. Johnson drew up the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>non, then at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00 yards distance from the front. Trees were also felled to form some fort of breast-work: and this was all his cover against an attack; having hitherto strangely delayed the proper retrenchments.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="008163_0044_102E40CFE87FE798"/>
ABOUT an hour after Williams's departure, a heavy fire was heard;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and meets our de∣tachment.</NOTE> which evidently approaching, Gen. Johnson judged right∣ly, that our detachment was retreating for the French were superior in number, amounting to about 1800. Upon this he sent out a reinforcement to support them; which was very judiciously conducted on the death of Williams, by Lieut. Co∣lonel Whiting, a Connecticut officer, who gained much applause at the reduction of Louisburgh. Gen. Johnson informs the governors, <Q><HI>That about half an hour after eleven the enemy appeared in sight, and marched along the road in very regu∣lar order, directly upon our center: That they made a small halt, about</HI> 150 <HI>yards from the breast-work, when the regular troops made the grand and center attack; while the Canadi∣ans and Indians squatted and dispersed on our flanks.</HI></Q> This halt was the baron's capital error: for, amidst the consterna∣tion at the camp, had he closely followed up the detachment, he had easily forced their lines, and gained a complete victory. But by continuing for some time a platoon fire, with little exe∣cution at that distance, our men recovered their spirits. As soon as the artillery began to play, Dieskau and his regulars found themselves totally deserted by the militia and savages, who all skulked into the swamps, took to trees, and main∣tained a scattered fire upon our flanks, for some time, with variable and intermitting briskness.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is de∣feated, &amp; taken pri∣soner.</NOTE> Having now no command of any part of his army, except his handful of regulars, the baron thought proper to retire; which he did in very great disorder. A party from the camp followed him, fell upon his rear, dispersed the remaining soldiers about him, and being himself wounded in the leg, was found resting on a stump, utterly abandoned and destitute of succour. Feeling for his watch, to surrender it, one of our men, suspecting him in search of a pistol, poured a charge thro' his hips; of which wound he is not yet recovered. Upon his retreat, the militia and In∣dians retired in small parties: and as the English neglected to continue the pursuit, they halted about four miles from the camp, at the very place where the engagement happened in the morning. Opening their packs for refreshment, they here entred into consultation, respecting a second attack. Why the enemy was not pursued, when their retreat became general, no tolerable reason has ever yet been assigned; and Mr. Johnson,
<PB N="47" REF="008163_0045_102E4107C744AFF0"/>in his letter, seems very artfully to evade it. Nothing however could be more fortunate than the gallant behaviour of a party consisting of about 200, led by Capt. M'Ginnes,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gallant behavior of M'Gin∣nes.</NOTE> who had been detached from Fort Edward, to the assistance of the main body. They fell upon the French in the evening, put an end to their consultations, and gave them a total overthrow. M'Ginne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> died of the wounds he received in this rencounter, having signalized himself by a spirit and conduct that would have done honour to a more experienced officer.</P>

Governor of New York, told him, he stood so near Gen. Johnson, when the latter received his wound, that "he thought he saw the ball enter:" which curious piece of intelligence was obliterated before its publication. I only mention this circumstance to con∣vince your Lordship, that the most intrepid soldier hath not always the same presence of mind.</P>
<P>IF the dusk of the evening was too far advanced, before the repulse at the Lake,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ene∣my not pursued.</NOTE> for an immediate pursuit (which by the way could not be the case, since M'Ginnes's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was subsequent) yet the neglect of it the next day admits of no colourable apology. Mr. Lyman urged it with great warmth; but the general, with most of the field officers, are accused of an equal disinclination. Mr. Johnson, to judge by his letter, seemed well satisfied with his escape, and determined with this action to close the present campaign. It was probably to avoid the prosecution of the expedition, that he transmitted no account of the battle to General Shirley; contenting himself with reques∣ting Lieut. Governor Phipps to send a copy of his letter from Boston, tho' his own situation was 200 miles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igher to Oswego. The gentleman at Albany, to whom his dispatches were in∣trusted, suspecting their contents, and conceiving their commu∣nication to the general absolutely necessary for his Majesty's service, broke open the letter to Governor Phipps, and sent an express with a copy to Oswego.</P>
<P>THE Indians, during the whole of the engagement,

Nor indeed was their assistance expected, by those who knew their boasted fidelity was a mere delusion, and Mr. Johnson's so much magnified influence, what it has since appeared to all men, the gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st

And had Dieskau won the day, equally ready had they been to scalp their brethren the English, as now they appeared to exercise their brutal dexterity on the French. Moreover, they came in a body to Albany, immediately after the battle, on pretence of celebrating the success of our arms,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and left our army after it.</NOTE> and to con∣dole with the widows of those who fell in the action. This, says one of Mr. Johnson's encomi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sts, is their custom; sub∣joining prophetically, that they were in a fortnight after their departure to return to the camp. The savages, my Lord, ob∣serve no such custom, save on the conclusion of an enterprize; whereas this was scarcely commenced: and as to their return, 'tis notorious they never did. Besides, had the general the real interest pretended, would he not, for once, have induced them to postpone their triumphant festivity, and untimely con∣dolence, when their presence at the camp, would they really sight, was of indispensible necessity; and himself in expectation of a second attack; nor, by the strain of his letter, exempt from a little perturbation of mind?</P>

But numbers of witnesses — eye witness<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, utterly impartial, and not belonging to the camp, are ready to depose, that by them he was seen fighting like a lion, and exposing his life in the hottest of the battle: not to mention a gentleman

<P>I SHALL now,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks on John∣son's rea∣sons for not pur∣suing the enemy, or prosecut∣ing his expediti∣on.</NOTE> my Lord, take the liberty to make a few remarks on Mr. Johnson's letter to the governors; and exa∣mine the reasons assigned against pursuing his advantage, as well as those alledged for not prosecuting the expedition. The repulse of the French delivered us from such unspeakable cala∣mity, naturally to be apprehended from the enemy's success, that we have infinite reason to thank the GOD OF ARMIES, for thus remarkably rescuing us from the jaws of perdition. Nor ought we to mention either our officers or men, who generally behaved as well as could be expected, without a suit∣able tribute of gratitude. But the general's own letter will enable me to convince your Lordship, that the magnificent trophies erected to his fame, sprung wholly from the New-York cabal; whose services, when encriculed with his laurels, he was ever after to acknowledge and retaliate
<Q><L>— sana redemitus tempora lauro</L>
<L>— veterem Anchisem agnoscit amicum.</L></Q> By this letter he appears so conscious of deserving reprehen∣sion, rather than applause, that the latter part of his epistle is apparently calculated to divert all inquiry into the true reason of his not pursuing the enemy, and breaking up the camp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign, without paving a visit to Crown Point. <Q><HI>Our men, says he, have suffered so much fatigue for three days past, and are
<PB N="50" REF="008163_0048_102E410E052127F8"/>constantly standing upon their arms by day, half the whole upon guard by night, and the rest lie down armed and ac∣coutred; that both officers and men are almost worn-out</HI></Q> I can't help thinking, that had the general begun his breast-work more seasonably, and not waited for intelligence of the enemy's advancing, before he ordered up his cannon, his men had been less fatigued by this redoubtable action. But lest the world should remain in the dark about the real grounds of his apprehension, he proceeds— <Q><HI>The enemy may rally; and we judge they have considerable reinforcements near at hand</HI></Q> I question, my Lord, whether the whole circle of history affords a single instance of an army's rallying, after the slaughter of 1000 men (his own computation) out of about 1800, the whole force of the enemy. And whence he conjectured they had any reinforcements so near at hand, as not to be able to join their routed detachment, still remains one of those arcana of state, which, by common understandings, is not to be fathomed: or, if the French consisted of 200 grenadiers, 800 Canadians, and 700 Indians (the baron's account to the general) so great a slaughter as is pretended by the letter, with the loss of the greatest part of the principal officers, and Mons. St. Pierre, who had the chief command and influence over the Indians, must have reduced them to less than 800. From these, one would have imagined, there was no danger of a second attack. Fat more probable was it, that for so momentous an enterprize as the reduction of the forts before-mentioned, the French had mustered all the Forces they could spare from Crown Point and Tinonderoge, where mary of the regular troops were posted; especially, as they went unfurnished with cannon. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to this, that our army was now flushed with victory; the enemy, on the contrary, disconcerted; and, according to his account, most of their principal officers, and many of their men, slain; the Indians too, by the death of St. Pierre, pro∣bably was vering and dissipated. This, if such were the facts, was a glorious opportunity to dispossess them of Tinonderoge. But the longer they were suffered to fortify, the more arduous the task to dislodge them, and the greater the loss of our present advantage, resulting from their defeat and our success. Besides, was there any probability of their return the next day, to re∣assault the camp with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quetry, when the effects of our
<PB N="51" REF="008163_0049_102E414C68671808"/>cannon (admitting them to have done the pretended executi∣on
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The cannon were so ill served, and highly elevated, that they did, beyond all controversy, no execution at all; none of the dead being observed to have been killed by cannon-shot: but amongst the tops of the trees, 30 and 40 feet high, they made great and use∣less havock.</NOTE>) was still so recent in their memories; and to the In∣dians, even the first time, so visibly tremendous? But the cautious general subjoins— <Q><HI>We don't think it either prudent or safe to be sending out parties in search of the dead.</HI></Q> I agree, it had been more for his Majesty's service to have dispatched them in pursuit of the <HI>living.</HI> After a short para∣graph concerning the wounded, his panic returns— <Q><HI>I think we may expect very shortly a more formidable attack.</HI></Q> More formidable than what?

But whence this surmise of a more formidable attack, he thinks not proper to communicate. It was well known, the whole force sent from France amounted to about 3000: — that of these, admiral Boscawen took eight companies, and 1000 were in garrison at Louisbourgh. Admitting therefore that all the rest arrived at Quebec, without any loss, (a favourable con∣cession) the utmost amount that reached Canada was about 1700; of which 500 were at Cadaraqui: so that, without any allowance for those killed at the camp, or in the mock pursuit which ensued, the whole number of regulars that arrived with Dies∣kau, and could come against him, but little exceeded 1100. The gentleman proceeds — <Q><HI>The late Col. Williams had the ground cleared for building a stockaded fort: our men are so harrassed, and obliged to be upon watchful duty, that I think it would be both unseasonable, and I fear in vain, to set them at work upon the designed fort, I design to order the New Hampshire regiment up here to reinforce us; and I hope some of the designed reinforcements will be with us in a few days. When these fresh troops arrive, I shall</HI></Q> — I dare say your Lordship expects at least the demolution of Fort St.

All his puissant purposes terminated now. <Q><HI>in setting about building a fort.</HI></Q> And if indeed he thought Crown Point impregnable by the army then under his command, above 4000 strong, he must necessarily conclude it would be found so the next year, by double the number: and if then attempted thro' another route, his grand fortress at the end of the Lake was absolutely useless. Nor would it prove any defence to the country between Lake George and Hudson's River, while the French could penetrate it by two other more usual passages, the South Bay and Wood-Creek; thro' the former of which they had actually marched to his camp. And as to their for∣midable attack with artillery, whence could they bring it, but from Crown Point? And if they learnt he intended, in the present campaign, nothing beyond building a stockaded fort, that very intelligence was sufficient to induce them to attack the camp with cannon; against which, I am confident, his fort would make but a very indifferent resistance. But, in reality, 'twas most probable they would exert their efforts in streng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hning Crown Point and Tinonderoge; the reduction of which, for not improving our success at the camp, will cost us a vast addition of blood and treasure.</P>
<P>THUS,

So that if ever any man obtained laurels without earning them, it was this fortunate general; who, by the splendid representations of his secretary, and the so∣vereign decree of his patron, is exalted into an eminent hero. To the panegyrical pen of Mr. Wraxal, and the — sic volo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> jubeo — of Lieut. Gov. De Lancey, is to be ascribed that migh∣ty renown, which echoed thro' the colonies, reverberated to Eu∣rope,

<P>So capracious is fortune, ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so fond of sporting with human affairs. The emperor Sever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s (I think it is Herodean tells the story) when obliged to raise the siege of Atras, the only attempt in which he had ever been baffled, thought himself conquered because he did not conquer: but our hero, it seems, is a conqueror, because he was not conquered. When a ge∣neral finds himself attacked in his camp, a very quaker me∣thinks, would forget his principles, and follow, in spite of Bar∣clay and the meeting, the powerful dictates of nature's incen∣tive to self-defence. And did the valour of our warrior carry him an inch farther? Did he pursue an enemy, who by fly∣ing, with the loss of about 30 men, exhibited a full proof of a most extraordinary pusilanimity? Or, if his wound (which, considering it was made by a ball visible in its flight to his aid-de-camp, must have been very capacious) rendered his per∣sonal pursuit impracticable; were any orders given to improve the fortune of the day, and destroy a fugitive army? Was not on the contrary, the noble ardor of those who offered to pursue, by positive orders repressed; and a poleroon adversary suffered to escape, whose recent cowardice promised a general slaughter, and who, in their present panick, had fallen a sacri∣fice to our victorious arms?</P>
<P>THESE are facts of incontestible notoriety:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why this action was so greatly exaggera∣ted.</NOTE> and if your Lordship demands, whence then the accounts that six or eight hundred, nay a thousand, fell before the camp (when, in reali∣ty, the enemy lost not above two hundred in all the three en∣gagements, which is less than our own loss) there is no other way of accounting for these glaring misrepresentations, than that it suited our present system of politics to have this action ex∣aggerated and magnified. It was necessary to exalt Johnson, in order to depress Shirley, and they who had represented the expedition against Crown Point of such prodigious importance, thought it adviseable to render every thing important that was transacted in that expedition. Every man among us knew it
<PB N="54" REF="008163_0052_102E4111134C2F80"/>to be an imposition; and yet ran the risque of having his head broke for offering to doubt it. It was notorious, not above 30 of the enemy were found slain at the camp; and that the rest of the dead could neither fly into the air, nor dive into the earth. Where then was the remainder? To antici∣pate the question, left any one should have effrontery enough to start it — they were carried off by a flying enemy, who took to their heels to save their own lives; and yet were so anxious about their dead, as to carry them all along. Such manifest contradictions are we obliged to believe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P>NAY,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shirley absurdly censured.</NOTE> to excuse this favourite general, the blame of not following his advantage, has been throne on Mr. Shirley, and attributed to his positive directions. Besides the absurdity of the accusation, that he could be accessory to an omission of this nature, it was absolutely impossible for him to know whether the enemy would at all risk an attack. Your Lordship will consider, the general was then at least 365 miles from the place of action, nor advised of it till nine days after it happened. But when he received the intelligence, so far from directing to the inactivity of a merely defensive conduct, that he dispatch∣ed repeated expresses to Mr. Johnson, urging him in the most pressing terms, to pursue the advantage already obtained; and if unable to proceed in person, to commit the charge of the troops to Major Gen. Lyman: or, if he found it impracti∣cable to invest Crown Point that season, at least to make him∣self master, if possible, of the enemy's advanced post at Tinon∣deroge. — But all was ineffectual: the laurel being already ac∣quired, fortune was not again to be put to a desperate venture.</P>
<P>WE will now, if your Lordship pleases, return to Oswego, where General Shirley arrived the 21st of August, and take a view of the course of his proceedings in that quarter.</P>

He thought proper to inform them of his intelligence concerning the situation and strength of the enemy — which was to this purpose — That before he left the Oneida Carry-Place, two trusty Indians, with as many Albany traders, were sent as spies to Niagara; who, after fourteen days absence, returned with an account — That the Indians had been two days in the French fort there, which was built partly of stone, but principally of logs, being in a weak and ruinous condition — that the gar∣rison consisted of about 60 French and 100 Indians, who said they had for some time expected 900 Indians and a quantity of stores from Canada; but were apprehensive their vessels were taken — that letters came in frequently from Fort Du Quesne, whence also they expected a considerable reinforcement.

<PB N="56" REF="008163_0054_102E411396F3DEA8"/>many English scalps, with a large quantity of cloaths and fur∣niture — that the French had there 70 or 80 large battoes, with which they intended to meet and board our vessels: and this article was confirmed by another Indian, who set out after the spies, and meeting one of our row gallies, cautioned the com∣mander against a nearer approach to Niagara.</P>
<P>HIS EXCELLENCY also informed the council, that an Indian spy had been with the Outawawas, who assisted the French in the action at Monongahela — that they had declared their in∣clination to lay down the hatchet; and that others more west∣erly gave the like intimations; which had induced him to dis∣patch four messengers with belts of wampum, to invite them into our alliance, or at least to engage their neutrality.</P>
<P>UPON the general's arrival at Oswego, he thought it necessary to procure intelligence from Frontenac; and for that purpose sent out a party of white men and Indians, who returned a∣bout the 8th of September, with information — that they land∣ed upon an island, about six furlongs from the fort, from whence they had a full view of it — that it was built in a bay, near the edge of the water, and surrounded by a stone wall; the land behind it cleared, and rising in a gradual acclivity — that two vessels, of about 40 tons each, lay moored in the harbour, unrigged, and without guns — that at the east end of the fort there was a regular encampment, and six marquis tents; from the extent of which they imagined it contained a∣bout 3 or 400 men. — Upon the side of the bay, opposite the fort, the land projected about half a mile: between this and the island they were upon was another little island, about three quarters of a mile from the fort, inhabited by about twen∣ty Indian families. The spies added, that there were several other adjacent islands; but they discovered no battoes. His ex∣cellency farther acquainted the council, that an Indian that came to Oswego about the time of his arrival, and had left Fronte∣nac nine days before, declared there were 30 French within the fort; a considerable quantity of powder, and many guns mounted on the surrounding wall, which was about six feet thick; and the encampment without consisted of 600 soldiers. The information of Redhead, to the same effect, was also laid before
<PB N="57" REF="008163_0055_102E415316EB8DC0"/>the council, with the addition — that there were two encamp∣ments, one of Canadians, and the other of regulars, in a hal∣low, indiscoverable from the island; and that he was told by the commandant, of a much larger number of troops ex∣pected with the general, lately arrived from France; when they proposed to invest Oswego. Gen. Johnson's l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tter of the 1st of September, signifying, that his scouts informed him of the departure of 300 canoes to Frontenac, was also consider∣ed: and from these articles of intelligence — the account of the arrival of the French troops — the suspension of all intercourse between Frontenac and Niagara — and their lying still so long at the former; his excellency observed, it was not improbable their design might be to make a descent on Oswego, if the whole force proceeded on the expedition to Niagara, which was about 150 miles to the westward; and from whence, at that advanced season, they could not return in less than 30 days. That this was the more probable, as Oswego was of the greatest importance for securing the frontiers of the western colonies, maintaining the British dominion over the great lakes, and the country beyond the Apalachean mountains. He also took notice of the defenceless state of Oswego, which would render it neces∣sary to leave a strong garrison there: that the number of ef∣fectives at that time in the three regiments and independent com∣panies, including serjeants and corporals, amounted to 1376; and that the irregulars, who were Albany men and Indians, procu∣red by his own emissaries, consisted only of 120. For the bet∣ter security of the place, the general had ordered to be built, with all possible dispatch, a strong wooden fort, capable of moun∣ting cannon, with pickets and a ditch, on a high point, com∣manding the old fort on the east side of the river. This he observed was already begun, and would soon be compleated: and that for the proposed enterprize, he had built and equipped a sloop and schooner of sixty tons each, two row-gallies, each of twenty tons, with eight whale-boats, each capable of carry∣ing sixteen men. He then informed them of his intention to embark for Niagara, as soon as the expected convoy arrived, with 600 regulars, including gunners and matrosses, besides the Albany and Indian irregulars, one 18 pounder, four 12 pounders, a ten-inch mortar, a seven-inch hoyet, two royals, and five small swivel-hoyets, the vessels, whale-boats, and a competent number
<PB N="58" REF="008163_0056_102E411625185E50"/>of battoes; leaving behind him 700 effectives, two 12 pounders, ten 6 pounders, six 3 pounders, and eight cohorns.</P>
<P>THE council, upon this representation, were unanimously of opinion, in answer to the several questions proposed, that the force intended for the Niagara expedition was sufficient: but with respect to Oswego, some imagined it would not be de∣fensible: the majority, however, were of contrary sentiments. All agreed, that a feint upon Frontenac, while his excellency was gone to Niagara, was by no means adviseable. They univer∣sally concurred in opinion, that a fort ought to be erected on the west side of the old fort: and that it would be for his Majesty's service to prepare materials for building one or more vessels, larger than any of those already upon the lake, capable of mounting ten 6 pounders, besides swivels, two more row-gallies, and a 100 good whale-boats.</P>
<P>IN consequence of this advice,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepara∣tions to proceed on the Niagara expedition</NOTE> 600 regulars were draughted, the artillery and ordnance-stores shipped on board the sloop On∣tario, part of the provisions on board the sloop Oswego, and the residue was ready for the row-gallies, whaleboats, and battoes. While these preparations were making, the weather was extremely wet and tempestuous. The rains began to fall so heavily on the 18th of the month, that on the best chosen ground the tents of the soldiers were overwhelmed. As 400 of the troops must have gone in open boats, it was impossible to pass the lake with any safety, till the storm abated; which was on the 26th of the month, when orders were immediately issued for the embarkation of the troops: but these could not be carried into execution. Tho' the rains ceased for a short space of time,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which could not be prose∣cuted from the bad∣ness of the wea∣ther.</NOTE> the western winds began to blow with redoubled fury; and were again suc∣ceeded by continual rains for thirteen days together. During this boisterous weather, numbers fell sick, whose tents were an in∣sufficient shelter: and the Indians, well acquainted with the cli∣mate, went off, declaring the season too far advanced to admit of an expedition upon the lake.</P>
<P>IN the midst of these difficulties another council,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another council of war held.</NOTE> consisting of the same members who composed the last, was called on the 27th of September. The general acquainted them with the unto∣ward
<PB N="59" REF="008163_0057_102E4156B205B5B8"/>state of affairs, and some of his latest advices. He ob∣served as follows — That the preceeding day, eight battoes were arrived, with 48 barrels of flour, and 13 of bread; so that there was then 14 days full allowance of those species of provisions for 2000, being the number then in his camp — That he thought it necessary to take with him 21,000 weight of bread and flour, which for 700 men, forty days, amounted only to three-fourths of the usual allowance — that, in such case, there would be lest with the garrison only 8000 weight of bread and flour, at half allowance for only 12 days: but, by advices received from the Carrying-Place and Mohawk River, he had the greatest reason to expect such a quantity of pro∣visions, in a few days, as would be a full supply for some months— that a party of men with two officers, in whale-boats, sent seven days before to Frontenac to discover the enemy's mo∣tions, were returned, with the following report — That they went into the harbour, and saw the fort, which appeared to be a regular square faced with stone, having four embrasures in the front — that the encampment consisted of above 100 tents— that two brigantines of about 40 tons each, and a small sloop lying then at anchor, were rigged, and the sails of one of them bent: and a number of battoes lay near the walls of the fort. He communicated to them also a copy of the orders and instruc∣tions given to the French regulars sent thither; which were taken from baron Dieskau, in the action at Lake George: whence it appeared, that ten companies of the Queen's battalion marched from Montreal to Cadaracqui, in two divisions, upon the first and second of August, together with 250 Canadians, exclusive of Indians: the number of men therefore at Frontenac, inclu∣ding the garrison, might amount to 1000 effectives, originally designed, as appears from those papers, for an attack upon Os∣wego. He farther took notice of the departure of some of our Indians, and their unanimous opinion, that the attempt a∣gainst Niagara could not succeed this season: on which account the remainder were resolved to return to their respective castles; giving nevertheless the highest assurances of their willingness to join us in much greater numbers in the spring—that the Albany tra∣ders were of the same opinion, that the battoes, tho' well adapted for the navigation of small rivers, could not live on the lake in such tempestuous weather as had continued for a fortnight
<PB N="60" REF="008163_0058_102E4119B4305A00"/>past — they Lieut. Holland, who had resided there above three years, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> it was commonly windy and wet, with sew fair days intervening, during the fall. — That it was besides now impracticable for the vessels and battoes to sail in concert: and as the vesse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and whale-boats would not contain all the supplies, there was the atmost danger of spoiling that part of the pro∣visions and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>munition, which must be conveyed in the bat∣toes; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consequence of which many of them might be cut off; it being more than probable, from the weakness of their fort, the enemy would attack them on the lake — that from the returns of the director and surgeons of the hospital, the number of the sick amounted to about 300, exclusive of officers; which they imputed to the excessive rains, and want of barracks. His excellency informed them, he proposed the erection of barracks, and a strong redoubt on the hill, west of the old fort, before the winter was too far advanced.</P>
<P>THESE matters,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their opi∣nion, and advice to lay aside the expe∣dition, &amp; strengthen Oswego.</NOTE> my Lord, were attentively considered: and the council of war prayed leave to add to the general's repre∣sentation — That Major Bradstreet, since his residence there, was persuaded 1650 Canadians had passed by from Cadaraqui to Niagara, for the Ohio; a great pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of whom, thro' scarcity of provisions, he conceived must then be upon their return to Canada; and that a considerable number of French traders go annually from Canada to Detroit, and other French settlements to the westward, who, at this season, are generally upon their return: — that their passage home is by the way of Niagara, where, it is very probable, they and all the French will tarry, as long as their provisions admit, for the defence of so im∣portant a post. That there were then but few proper battoe∣men at Oswego: nor could they be provided with a sufficient number, as those who understood the management of battoes were chiefly employed in the transportation of provisions from Schenectady to Oswego, and from Albany to Lake George; and that the soldiers were unable to conduct them to Niagara, the lake being turbulent generally five days in six.</P>
<P>THE advice of the council, my Lord, was unanimously to this effect — That the arrival of the battoes with provisions,
<PB N="61" REF="008163_0059_102E41583A9B47D8"/>tho' hourly expected, was by no means to be depended upon, there being scalping parties in the neighbourhood; one of which, since the last council of war, had actually killed three, and captivated two of the work-men employed in building the new fort on the east side of the river: and the cutting off the battoes was the more to be apprehended, as the Indians in our alliance were now returning to their castles. Nor did they think it adviseable to risk the troops in battoes upon the lake, at so advanced a season of the year. They approved his excel∣lency's intention of raising barracks for the soldiers without de∣lay; and thought the fort on the east side of the Onon∣daga River ought to be compleated as soon as possible; and again advised the erection of a work for mounting cannon on the eminence west of the old sort — all which, in there opi∣nion, could not be effected before the winter was too far set in, without employing the whole strength than at the place. They were also unanimously and clearly of opinion, that his excellency ought to defer any attempt on Niagara or Frontena<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, till the next spring; when they had great reason to expect the junction of a large body of the Six Nations, and some of the French allies, who had taken up the hatchet against the English, and were concerned on the banks of the Monongahela. Besides, he might, in the ensuing campaign, have a greater number of troops, whale-boats instead of battoes, and a more pow∣erful naval force, which they conceived ought to be provided against the next spring.</P>
<P>THIS advice, my Lord,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which was carri∣ed into execution.</NOTE> the general proceeded immediately to carry into execution. Compleating the fort on the east side of the river, was a matter of principal attention, because situated on a high point of land, at 100 yards distance from the lake, commanding the ground round about it— the old fort at 450 yards distance — and the entrance of the harbour. Its circumference was 800 feet, being built of legs from 20 to 30 inches diameter, and the outer wall 14 feet high. Round it was to be a ditch 14 feet broad and 10 deep. Within, a square log-house to overlook the walls, and barracks for 300 men. — This fort, called Ontario, was to mount 16 pieces of cannon. Another, called Oswego, was immediately begun, upon an eminence 450 yards west of the old fort. It was a square of 170 feet, with bastion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and a rampart of earth and masonry;
<PB N="62" REF="008163_0060_102E411B399A9500"/>which, besides the parapet, was to be 20 feet thick, 12 in height, with a ditch 14 feet broad and 10 deep. The barracks within were to contain 200 men. This was to mount eight pieces of cannon; being made the more defensible, as it com∣manded a good landing, distant 150 yards on the edge from the lake.</P>
<P>WHILE these works were carrying on,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The gene∣ral labours to estab∣lish the Indians in our in∣terest.</NOTE> the general employed himself in a necessary attention to Indian affairs. He laboured to establish some of the principal Onondagas, who were thro' negligence become wavering; and dispatched messages to those who were gone from us, and settled at Oswegatie, and to the Messasagues and Chippawees on the North side of the Lake Ontario. Others were sent to foment the dissaffection of the Outawawas, gisgusted at the French partition of the plunder, on Braddock's defeat. With the Senecas, the remotest from our settlements of all the five cantons, and therefore the most debauched by the French, he succeeded so well, that they now dismissed Jon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aire, one of their emissaries, whose father had been long suffered to reside among them, in spite of our re∣peated remonstrances; and was the chief preserver of the fort at Niagara They also engaged to meet him, the next cam∣paign, with 100 of their warriors, and promised for the future to refuse the assistance they had formerly given the French, in transporting their furrs, with horses and sleds, across the Nia∣gara Carrying-Place — as necessary there, as at any of our portages between Schenectady and Oswego.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">And re∣turns to Albany.</NOTE> When nothing fur∣ther could be prosecuted, the general retired from Oswego the 24th of October, leaving 700 men in garrison, under the com∣mand of Lieut. Col. Mercer; with orders to continue the works projected for its defence.</P>
<P>HAVING, my Lord, taken up too much of your time in a circumstantial relation of the proceeding in this quarter, I shall not trouble you with any reflections upon them. Your Lord∣ship has seen the insurmountable difficulties attending this western expedition; and will doubtless approve our not hazarding the loss of Oswego.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">French∣signed to cut off Oswego.</NOTE> That such would have been the event, had Mr. Shirley left the place about the beginning of October, was wisely foreseen, from the advices he had received: and baron Dieskau, just after the action at Lake George, assured a gen∣tleman
<PB N="63" REF="008163_0061_102E415BB7F13290"/>of distinction in the army, he questioned not the English general would make himself master of Niagara; but that the French had half the forces he brought with him from Brest, with a number of Canadians and Indians, at Frontenac, ready, immediately on his departure, to invest Oswego, and cut off his retreat.</P>
<P>WHILE the general was at Albany,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Charles Hardy calls in the mili∣tia on a false a∣larm.</NOTE> after his return from the lake, forwarding the supplies for the garrison at Oswego; pre∣paring for the operations of the next campaign, and examining into the state of the troops arrived there under Col. Dunbar; the city was alarmed by expresses from General Johnson, informing, that 8 or 9000 of the enemy were advancing towards him. Sir Charles Hardy, then at Albany, called in the militia: and a detachment of the regular troops, with a train of artillery, held themselves in readiness to march at a moment's warning. But another express gave reason to believe those apprehensions were ill-grounded, and General Johnson's fears in some measure abated. It seems a few Indian scouts had discovered the tracks of a large army; but Capt. Rogers, the brave officer before∣mentioned, came into the camp soon after them, and declared, the enemy were employed, as the general had predicted in his letter to Mr. Johnson of the 19th of September, in throwing up works at Tinonderoge. Upon which, the militia were dis∣missed to their respective habitations.</P>
<P>OF the malignity of the New York faction against the ge∣neral, I have already acquainted your Lordship: permit me to present you with another instance of the same spirit. A mercenary scribbler, of whom I shall soon take more particular notice, is pleased to inform the public, that <Q>Col Dunbar with his forces, were obliged six weeks to lie encamped at Albany, in the rain and snow, till barracks were built for them. That they were entirely obliged to Sir Charles Hardy, that they got a stick of wood to burn. So (says he) were our forces disposed of.</Q></P>
<P>ALBANY, my Lord, is an old compact city, consisting of 3 o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 400 w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ouses: and at about 16 miles N. W. from it, is the town of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nectady, consisting of about 150 houses. The inhabitants are far from being indigent: the adjacent country
<PB N="64" REF="008163_0062_102E411DC7422398"/>abounds with provisions; and in such quarters, your Lordship is sensible, his Majesty's troops <HI>will</HI> not want necessaries; espe∣cially <HI>fuel,</HI> in a country covered with timber. Where then the probability, that the forces, which consisted of 1200, would suffer in a post like this? As to the affair of barracks, my Lord, there was a council held at New York, on the first of August, when the news arrived of Col. Dunbar's retiring into winter-quarters, after Braddock's defeat. It was composed of Mr. De Lancey the Lieut. Governor, Mess. Alexander, Ken∣nedy, Murray, Holland, Chambers, and Smith; and the opinion of that board then was, <Q><HI>That not only the King's forces to the southward, but else those that could be spared from Nova Scotia, should quarter near Albany, for any future operations.</HI></Q> This resolve Mr. De Lancey transmitted to the general at Os∣wego; and as Dunbar's troops were ordered to Albany, for the defence of that Country, and particularly to make a stand, in case the provincials were defeated; they had, methink, the highest reason to expect favour from the inhabitants, and the special countenance of the government, even had they been quartered upon them as usual: and which at present is actually the case, by express orders of my Lord Loudon. The general, I say, had no reason to expect, upon this head, any opposition from the civil magistrate. But Sir Charles Hardy, on his arrival at Albany, about the 26th of September, signified to him by letter, his apprehensions of uneasiness arising among the inhabitants, should the soldiers be quartered upon private families; and wished to have his excellency's orders for building barracks, both there and at Schenectady; lest his assembly should not chuse to put the pro∣vince to that charge. He also expressed his hopes, if such an expence was saved them, of their greater readiness to raise more men, should the service require it, the next campaign. The general's answer to this letter equally demonstrated his integrity to the crown, and concern for the troops. He intimated his fears, that the construction of barracks would be thought an extraordinary ex∣pence; but it being necessary for the service, that Dunbar's, and the regiment of the late Sir Peter Halket, should winter in Albany and Schenectady, he complied with Sir Charles's re∣quest; and desired him to provide barracks for those regi∣ments with all possible diligence, that the troops on their arrival in his government, might not find themselves destitute of quar∣ters.
<PB N="65" REF="008163_0063_102E415FAD186B18"/>To relieve the crown in the expence, he farther took notice to Sir Charles, of the request made by his own government for drawing these troops to Albany — that they would in a special manner cover the frontier of New York — be of service to Oswego in the ensuing spring — and that the inhabitants would draw very large sums from their residence amongst them. Nor did he for∣get to recommend an imitation of the Massachusetts Bay; who thought it reasonable to erect barracks for his own regiment tho' they knew their continuance among them would be short, destined as they were for the western expedition. But that there might be no delay in building the barracks, arising from any doubt of the expence being paid by the province of New York, Mr. Shirley informed Sir Charles, that if they would not, after these conside∣rations, take that expence on themselves, he would defray it out of the contingent-money in the hands of the deputy pay-master. Thus, my Lord, if any ground for complaint of the want of barracks, Mr. Shirley 'tis clear was intirely unsensurable: and if the troops, as this libeller informs us, did suffer in their tents,— I submit it to your Lordship, whose province it was to have found them better quarters. But the fact is, that the barracks were finished, and the troops quartered in them before the first of December, fuel provided for them sufficient for the winter, and all at the expence of the crown.</P>
<P>THE winter now approaching, commissioners were appointed by the governments concerned in the Crown Point expedition, to ascertain their respective quotas for garrisoning the forts <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>William-Henry,</HI> and disbanding the rest of the army. After this was compleated, the general and Sir Charles Hardy returned to New York; where the former convened a grand congress of governors and field officers, to deliberate on a plan for the operations of the succeeding campaign. But before I enter upon their transactions, I shall briefly lay before your Lordship those between Sir Charles Hardy and his assembly; which was opened on the second, and continued sitting till the 23d of December.</P>
<P>I HAVE already observed, that the ministry,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Transacti∣ons in New York between Sir Charles Hardy and his assem∣bly.</NOTE> from the time of Mr. Clinton's departure in 1753, had been solicitous about procu∣ring the consent of our assembly to a law establishing a permanent provision for the governor, and other necessary officers. When Sir Danvers Osborne arrived, he brought with him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> instruction for that purpose; from the terms of which it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> apparent that the
<PB N="66" REF="008163_0064_102E412291F36DB0"/>ministry had it much at heart; and Sir Danvers, before he left England, was made to believe that Mr. De Lancey, by means of his great popularity, would enable him to carry it into execution. This I had from a gentleman, to whom Sir Danvers opened himself, and whom he consuited before his embarkation for his government. The gentleman is a person of the first figure in these colonies; and being acquainted with the system of politics in New-York, he informed Sir Danvers, that those promises were by no means to be depended upon: that Mr. De Lancey was inexpressibly jealous of his ascendancy over the assembly, who were utterly disinclined to a perpetual support: that he would join in no measures that might weaken the confidence they reposed in him: that as long as he maintained his influence in their counsels, he would virtually be the governor of the province; and there∣fore upon the whole, his interest and ambition would infallibly lead him to keep every governor in a state of dependence upon him. Sir Danvers disliked so disagreeable a prediction; and many are of opinion, that its accomplishment hastened his un∣happy fate. Excuse me, my Lord, for troubling you with a relation of facts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anecdote of Sir Danvers Osborne.</NOTE> a little out of the strict order of time. There is an anecdote of Sir Danvers, of which I would not have your Lordship uninformed. He arrived here on the 7th of October, 1753, under very discouraging apprehensions of the people; and indeed not without reason, the opposition against Mr. Clinton having been carried beyond all decorum. Governor Osborn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s commission, thro' Mr. Clinton's absence, remained unpublished till the third day after his arrival. This is usually done, first privately in the council-chamber; and immediately after, in the most public manner at the city-hall. To wait on his excellency thither, Mr. Clinton came abroad; an astonishing crowd being assembled at the Fort Gate, to attend the procession. Mr. Clin∣ton's enemies were very assiduous in exciting the popular accla∣mations; and the huzzas of the mob were scarce intermitted for a moment. There appeared, in short such a profusion of joy, accompanied with some indecent expressions respecting himself, as gave Mr. Clinton just reason to suspect more open indignities. He therefore soon took his leave of Sir Danvers, who expressed his displeasure at the conduct of his enemies. This, my Lord, proved a day of general festivity and Bacchanalian frolic. In the evening, the city was illuminated: the common blazed
<PB N="67" REF="008163_0065_102E41613704FDD0"/>with bonfires: great was the consumption of Madeira; and every company rung with maledictions against the late com∣mander in chief, who was charged as the sole procurer of the new instruction; an account of which could only have transpired from some of the council. Sir Danvers alone appeared unaffec∣ted with our intemperate revels; and on his countenance sat a melancholly gloom. He convened the council on Thursday the eleventh of the month; and prayed their sentiments on the probability of obtaining a permanent support, according to his instructions. That the point was unattainable, they all delivered as their unanimous opinion. He then required the solution of the same question from each member severally; and still from each received the same reply. Upon this, he turned himself about in apparent distress, uttered a deep sigh, and reclining his head against a window, in a disponding accent said, <Q>What then am I come hither for?</Q> The next morning — But I desist. This instruction, as your Lordship will be please to recollect, remained unrevoked all the time of his successor: and 'tis natural to expect, that the people of this province were very inquisitive whether it was continued to Governor Hardy—They were so. But Sir Charles did not follow the example of Mr. De Lancey, in laying his instructions before the assembly. The article relative to the support has undergone, as I am credibly informed, very few alterations, and those only in the preamble. That it was in substance the same, is evident from his speech to the house, on the 3d of December, at the opening of that session. His words are these: <Q><HI>I am commanded by his Ma∣jesty to recommend in his name without delay,</HI>

<P>MR. CLINTON, my Lord,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their be∣haviour different from what it was in Clinton's time, and the reason.</NOTE> asked of this same assembly only a support for five years and it was refused with indignation and vi∣rulence. Sir Charles here demands much more; and we see, that he is answered with the most commendable decency. To help your Lordship in accounting for this contradictory behaviour — Mr. De Lancey was bent upon expelling that governor from the province: and to gain his point, continually fomented the quarrel he himself excited. But Sir Charles was to be treated in a diffe∣rent manner, and measures more lenient were to be pursued. An ascendancy over him would ensure to his lieutenant many advan∣tages; and enable him to procure the governor's assent to a bill, for paying him a large sum, now due for his salary and other per∣quisites, while he had the chief command. He might indeed, but durst not pass such a bill himself, and therefore it was not of∣fered. Accordingly, the house, at their very next meeting, sent up a bill to the council, on the 4th of February, 1756, for paying the debts of the government; in which he was a creditor for near 4000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> But of this I shall have occasion to take more particular notice.

<P>LET us now take a view of the transactions in the grand council of war,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grand council of war con∣vened at New York for set∣tling the operations for 1756.</NOTE> which the general had convened at New York, for settling a plan of the future operations. It was opened on the 12th of De∣cember, and continued sitting for the space of two days. Tho' the invitation to the governors was universal, it consisted only of these members:
<LIST>
<ITEM>His Excellency General Shirley, commander in chief of all his Majesty's forces in North America:</ITEM>

He then delivered his sentiments to the board,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The gene∣ral deli∣vers his sentiments to the council;</NOTE> to the fol∣lowing purpose: <Q><HI>That our only entrance into Lake Ontario was thro' the Onondaga River to Oswego. No other harbour had his Majesty upon that lake, capable of receiving vessels of force: That Oswego was situate in the country of the Onondagas, the centre canton of the Six Nations, and famous for the furr trade: no o∣ther mart could we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>st, for commerce or correspondence with those numerous tribes of savages inhabiting the western country, on the banks of the great lakes Erie, Huron, Michigan, and the many rivers which r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll into them: That the Lake Ontario was only accessible to the Canadians▪ thro' the river Cadaracqui, for∣merly called by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rench Fleuve Iroquois but in their late maps, calculated to countenance their exorbitant claims, distinguished
<PB N="70" REF="008163_0068_102E4125A1B25BA8"/>by the name of St Lawrence. At the head of that river was their entrance into that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake; and near Fort Frontenac, situated on its north-eastern edge, about 50 miles from, and nearly opposite to our fort at Oswego: That while the enemy kept possession of Fron∣tenac, with the harbour at Front<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and a free passage thro' the Irequ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is River, they would always be able to build and maintain vessels of force upon the lake: That his Majesty would therefore be necessitated to support a naval armament there, at least equal to that of the French. Without this, they might annoy any forts we could erect at the north-east end of the pass at Niagara; and Oswego itself be lost. The inevitable consequence of which would be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the defection of the Six Nations, the loss of the whole country for near 300 miles from Oswego to Schenectady, and perhaps the reduction of Albany itself.</HI></Q> <HI>The general added,</HI> <Q><HI>That all the French forts at Niagara, upon the lake Erie, and the river Ohio, those also upon lake Huron, at the Streights of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>makinac, and the Lake Michigan still more westerly, received all their supplies by water-carriage from Montreal, thro' the River Irequois, and the Lake Ontario: That the French settlements at the mout<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Mississippi furnished these northern garrisons neither with provisi∣ons nor stores; being not only at 2000 miles distance from any of them, but embarrassed with insuperable difficulties, by a laborious navigation against a rapid stream</HI></Q> <HI>Hence on excellency concluded.</HI> <Q><HI>That could the French be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dged from Frontenac and the little fort at Fronto, and their entrance into Lake Ontario obstructed, all their other forts and settlements on the Ohio, and the western lakes, were deprived of their support from Canada, and must ere long be evacuated.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IMPRESSED,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s his plan of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations</NOTE> my Lord, with these views, the general proposed, as a plan of operations for the next year — That 5000 men should be very early aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed at Oswego, and 4000 of them sent to at∣tack Frontenac an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> La Gall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tte; which being reduced, an attempt should be made upon the forts at Niagara, Presque Isle, Riviere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u Beuf, Detr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, and Missilimakinac: and that in the mean time, 3000 provincial troops should march from Will's Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, for the reduction of Fort Du Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e: That a bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of 10000 should pro∣ceed to Crown Point, build a fort there, and launch one or more vessels into Lake Champlain: And that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of Canada might be farther divided, he proposed, that 2000 men should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and sword up Kennebec River, fall upon the settlements adjoining
<PB N="71" REF="008163_0069_102E41644F74E8C0"/>to the River Chandiere, and proceed to its mouth, three miles distant from Quebec; and by dividing themselves in small parties along the banks of the river St. Lawrence, and destroying the scat∣tered settlements there, keep that part of Canada in continual alarms.</P>
<P>HE then observed, that if the several attempts upon Crown Point, the forts upon the lakes, and the Ohio, were not pro∣secuted at the same time, very perilous might be the consequences: That if in particular, while Frontenac and Niagara were attacked, no attempt was made against Crown Point, the whole force of Canada would march to oppose us; which would defeat the design, and require so large a body of troops, as to render the transportation of necessaries to Oswego impracticable. So nume∣rous an army might also march against Albany, as effectually to cut off the retreat of our forces, or at least totally obstruct their supplies: That should, on the contrary, our whole strength be destined for Crown Point, and the western operations neglected; Oswego, the grand object of the French, was in the utmost dan∣ger of falling into their hands. A loss irreparable and beyond estimation — The loss of the whole country down to Albany, with that of the Six confederate Nations; and to the French the acquisition of an absolute dominion on the lakes, and the whole southern country.</P>
<P>HIS EXCELLENCY finished, with informing the council of his late intelligence — That the French were building three large vessels, of superior force to ours, in the harbour of Frontenac: and upon the whole prayed their advice.</P>
<P>A PLAN so well digested, and so clearly stated,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which was ap∣proved, with some little alte∣rations.</NOTE> required but little consideration; and accordingly it was in the main unani∣mously approved. The council advised the general, to give orders for building three or more vessels at Oswego. They were of opinion, that 10,000 men were necessary for the Crown Point expedition, and 6000 for that on Lake Ontario. The attempt against Fort Du Quesne, by the western governments, 'twas thought would answer very good purposes, especially in securing the fidelity of the western Indians. The feint against Quebec was approved, if it interfered not with the other expe∣ditions. The operations on Lake Ontario, they conceived ought to begin with the attack on Frontenac — and upon the whole, were of opinion — that an additional number of regular troops would be necessary for effectually recovering and securing his Majesty's rights and dominions on the continent.</P>

THE council having finished their business, the governors soon after returned to their respective provinces.

He earnestly sought an introduction to General Braddock; and Mr. Shirley did the office with great politeness. He was then just informed of his appointment to be lieut. governor of New Jersey, and on that account pressed for an admission into the council. Mr. Shirley, in a very genteel manner, declined a task, which might give offence to the general; and if any resolution transpired, draw himself into a snare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But Mr. Pownal, being a stranger to that diffidence and modesty, to suitable to his years and in∣experience, became from this moment disgusted, and was seldom after seen amongst that gentleman's friends. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arried at Phi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adelphia,
<PB N="73" REF="008163_0071_102E41691425AB48"/>till General Braddock's defeat: and towards autumn returned to New York. This change of temper recommended him to Mr. De Lancey, who failed not to exasperate the rising resentment: and now his opposition became open and unreserved. Just at this juncture, arrived Sir Charles Hardy; and Mr. Shirley being then at Oswego, your Lordship sees how seasonable their opportunity, for sowing the seeds of prejudice in the breast of the new governor. I will not take upon me to speak of their success; but doubtless no misrepresentations were wanting to strengthen the cabal. Yet no sooner did the general arrive from Oswego at Albany, where M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss. Pownal and De Lancey attended upon Sir Charles, than the former, dissembling his enmity, laboured to procure his confidence, that he might pry into his secrets: but from previous intimations of his present disposition, in a letter to a gentleman then near the general, he failed in that insidious design. He could now no longer suppres his male∣volence, or conceal his recent connections; and therefore openly traduced the very man, to whom he was indebted for all his significancy amongst the provinces. My Lord, it is with reluc∣tance I utter these things. But your Lordship is as determined to know every transaction which concerns the operations in Ame∣rica, as I am to discharge the office of a faithful historian. Truth is too sacred to be violated either out of fear or favour; and whatever your Lordship may think of this gentleman, such was his conduct. I knew him an avowed enemy to Mr. De Lancey, and to Mr. Shirley as sanguine a friend. I have since known him to calumniate the latter, and applaud the former. With a change of residence, or rather interest, he cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges sides; and on this account, no man perhaps ever multiplied so many adver∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ries in so short a time. He aims at two governments, without the least prospect of peace, if either of them should fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under his command. I can assure your Lordship, that even in the province of New Jersey he is so little esteemed, and that prin∣cipally for intriguing the disbandment of the regiment under Col. Schuyler, to disoblige Mr. Shirley, that upon his return to Eng∣land in February 1756, he was unable to procure a vote of assem∣bly, desiring his assistance of their ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt at the Court of Great Britain; tho' he pushed it with an earnestness that would have cost most men a blush of confusion</P>
<P>DETERMINED to embarrass the general, nothing could have been more agreeable to Mr. Pownal and the lieut. governor of
<PB N="74" REF="008163_0072_102E412BE0DEDF08"/>New York, than an admission into the late council of war. To a seat at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t board neither of them had the least pretension; and yet both were highly displeased at not being invited. Mr. Pownal, who has often distinguished himself for pushing a bold point, repaired to New Jersey, and importuned Governor Bel∣cher, unable, on account of his age, to attend the congress in person,

His excellency very wisely answered, that the invitation he had received from the general, was merely a personal compliment: nor could he, with the least decency, insist upon an appearance by proxy. His lieutenant, impatient of a denial, called in a menancing tone for pen, ink, and paper, thinking to operate on the infirmities of age by com∣mination and outrage. The council were astonished at this inde∣cent attack upon an antient and faithful servant of the Crown, and withheld their advice. But the governor, conscious of the propriety of his refusal, firmly adhered to his first resolution; and Mr. Pownal abruptly quitting the board, returned with disap∣pointment to New York.</P>

Mr. Morris however commenced an action against him in this province, more for his own vindication, than a reparation of damages; which the poor fellow would never have been able to make. Upon this he was committed to Goal, till Mr. Oliver De Lancey so far befriended him, as to become his security.

Your Lordship is too well acquainted with history, not to know, they chiefly owed their origin to the dis∣putes which involved the nation in all the calamities of a civil war. The first planters encountered innumerable difficulties, and were long engaged in sepeated wars with the Indian natives. Their descendants retain the martial prowess and spirit of their ancestors: and for wisdom, loyalty, and an enterprising genius, are a people of renown. In these governments lies the main strength of the British interest upon this continent. Besides their above advantageous character, they are very considerable for their numbers.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>YOU say you're informed, that your lieut. governor designs to exercise his former office,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The opi∣nion of a gentleman of the law with re∣spect to it</NOTE> in vertue of the commission issued by your late governor Clinton. I can't think your information well groun∣ded; because I am clearly of opinion, that office was extinguished by his acceptance of the lieut. governor's commission: and I con∣ceive Mr. De Lancey will hardly venture to dispute the matter with the crown. The main reason I go upon is, that those two offices are incompatible. To make this plain to you, you must un∣derstand—that to every office there are duties annexed. The same person cannot exercise two offices, inconsistent with one another. One of them must therefore be lost; because as every office is</HI> pro bono publico, <HI>its use lies in the exercise of it: and the inferior office is that which is lost; because it is most for the public good, teat the officer should hold the superior office; as the law presumes every man capable of the office which the King, who is the fountain of offices and honour, is pleased to confer upon him. Agreeable to this, we find many resolutions in our books: I'll mention one or two A man cannot be forester and judge</HI> eo instanti. <HI>Rolls Rep.</HI> 452, <HI>&amp;c. — Nor judge of the Com. and King's Bench</HI> simul &amp; semel. <HI>Dyer's Case.</HI> 4 <HI>&amp;</HI> 5 <HI>Phil. &amp; Mar.

C. 5 Mar. Br. Commissions pl.</HI> 25.</P>
<P><HI>NOTHING now remains but to shew, that the office of chief justice and governor of your province are inconsistent. To explain this, I must inform you, that your supreme court is a court of general jurisdiction, established by an ordinance of governer &amp; council; claim∣ing the like power here in all pleas civil and criminal, as full as they are taken cognizance of by the King's Bench and Common Pleas in England. Superior to this, is the Court of Governor and Coun∣cil — a court instituted by one of his Majesty's instructions to your governor. In virtue of this instruction writs of error are returned from the supreme court, before the governor and council. The inconsistency then of the two offices becomes very apparent. By the instruction, the governor in the court above it a</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; <HI>and to suppose him at the same time judge in the court below, and must a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sregard the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>urd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty of the governor's sending a writ to command himself; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of his just<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his judgment as chief jus∣tice to himself in council as governor: and yet be excluded from a
<PB N="79" REF="008163_0077_102E416FACAE08B8"/>voice in the judgment above; which nevertheless cannot be given without him. You see then the incompatability is much stronger, than if a man should be judge both of the King's and Common Bench in England There the other judges of B. R might correct the error in the Common Pleas — but here the course of public justice might be intirely stopped.</HI></P>
<P><HI>IF it should be said, his power was only suspended, while in the chair of government; I answer with the observation before — that an office is a</HI> duty, <HI>as the very word itself implies: and I know of no sleeping and not-to-be-exercised office Every office is institu∣ted for the public good: the officer is therefore obliged to exercise his duty; for, without that, he cannot serve the public — and to be</HI> obliged to act, <HI>and at the same time</HI> obliged not to act, <HI>is non∣sense. It would be more specious to say the instruction is no law; as your assemblies have often said in other cases; but then, Sir, Mr De Lancey, in obedience to it, has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> acting as judge, ever since the death of Sir D. Osborne: and why has be (as I have been informed) rejected a writ of error, because, according to this very instruction, the damages in demand did not exceed 300 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> ster∣ling? Besides this court of Governor and council, I am told, has long exercised its power, under this and former instructions to your governors, of the like tenor, without the least opposition.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THE offices will further appear to be inconsistent, if you reflect—that as governor he is also chancellor. The Court of Chancery of∣ten restrains the power of the law courts: and it is the spirit of every court to enlarge its own juri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ition Upon both these ac∣counts the two offices must inevitably clash I know that Knevet was formerly chief justice and chancellor: but the propriety of that double investiture was never solemnly considered. It was long ago, in the time of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> III There has been no instance of the like in later times; nor do I believe it would be suffered. But the case is much stronger here — and I can't conceive, for the reasons above, that your lieut governor will attempt to sit as judge, by virtue of his old commission It is more probable, he will prevail on your governor, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttely arrived, to grant him a new patent.</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>PERHAPS, my Lord, no higher evidence can be assigned of a man's influence, than such a bold invasion of his Majesty's prerogative. Mr. De Lancey was determined not to lose an office, which he knew to be the grand source of his popularity, and the main prop
<PB N="80" REF="008163_0078_102E413180664B80"/>of his power. For, whoever is chief justice of the province, unless a very device, must be the second man in the government. Go∣vernor Hardy made no opposition to this large stride of ambition: and the other not long after, by his wonderful artifice, subjected him to his absolute dominion. It was effected in the following manner — Your Lordship will be pleased to recollect,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">De La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y obliges the go∣vernor to pass two acts of as∣sembly.</NOTE> that Mr. De Lancey had the address to prevail upon the assembly to send up a bill to the council, on the 4th of February, intituled, <Q><HI>An Act for the Payment of the Debts due from this Colony; and other pur∣poses therein mentioned</HI></Q> By this, payments were to be made to many creditors of the government, <HI>for services done this colony,</HI> without speci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying what those services were. The lieut governor was to receive 378<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 16 <ABBR>s</ABBR> and several other sums were payable to his brother. It was in reality a bill for discharging the arrears due to the ordinary officers of the government. To render it the more palatable to the governor, provision was made for paying him also large sums for presents to the Indians, and the expences of his voyage to Albany, after the French repulse at Lake George. When it came up to the council, it obtained a majority only by one voice: and of these, my Lord, two gentlemen, besides lieut. gov. De Lancey, were themselves interested in the bill. They were the puisne judges of the supreme court, Mess. Horsemanden and Chambers, whose arrears of salary were now by the act to be dis∣charged. Moss. Colden, Alexander, and Smith looked upon it, as a mean invasion of the King's instructions, which, until they re∣signed their seats at the council board, they were bound in honour to regard with sacred punctuality. — It was besides evidently par∣tial; no provision being made for other creditors, whose demands were indisputable. They also conceived it derogatory to the digni∣ty of that board, to pass an act, excluding themselves from any knowledge of those services, for which the respective sums were made payable. For these reasons, among others, they opposed the bill; and prayed their dissent might be entered, as a vindication of themselves to his Majesty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. The governor to whom it was sent up, detained it for farther consideration; tho' he passed several other bil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s on the 19th of the month. This circumstance, my Lord, could not but chag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in his lieutenant, who had the bill much at heart; not only on ac∣count of the large sums thereby payable to himself and brother; but because the passing it into a law, would be the fullest evidence of his ascendancy over the governor; and if he could bring him
<PB N="81" REF="008163_0079_102E417442B4DB18"/>into disgrace with the ministry, by leading him into a breach of instructions, it was plain he would have nothing to rely upon, but his own popularity. This was an important card, and to be skil∣fully played off. So indeed it was: and when I finish the story, I am persuaded your Lordship will entertain to very mean opinion of American politicians.—The spring was now advancing; and it became necessary to pass a law for levying forces, not only to join the eastern colonies, on a new expedition against the French fortress at Crown Point, but for the protection of our western frontiers, in conjunction with Pennsylvania and New Jersey, which were become fields of blood, by the daily ravages of inhuman barbarians. The bill for this purpose originated with the assembly: and Mr. De Lancey, who was now closeting the members, was its principal constructor. When it came before the council on the 28th of March, that board immediately objected to it, according to his ex∣pectations: and the governor declared, that if the council approved, he should himself give it a negative. According to the tenor of this bill, the forces designed for the western expedition were to serve but forty days, when the province of New Jersey had ordained their quota, to be disbandable by Mr. Belcher: and Sir Charles Hardy insisted, that the like confidence ought to be reposed in his judgment. The two houses now engaged themselves in a dispute, at a time when, of all others, every contention should have been avoided. Mr. Oliver De Lancey, appointed by the house to provide the supplies for the regiment designed as our quota towards the Crown Point expedition, now gave orders to stop all farther preparations, an open rupture between the governor and assembly being daily ex∣pected. The members began freely to speak against him. The council laboured to procure an alteration of the bill — but all to no purpose. The principal thing aimed at, was the passing of the debt-bill: and a leading member in the house plainly intimated their designs to the governor. Doubtless your Lordship will won∣der he did not dissolve them with indignation. Believe me, my Lord, it would have been a step, at this time, extremely unadvisea∣ble. Forty days intermission between the test and return of the writ of summons for the election of representatives, being required by law; the public exigencies were too pressing to admit of any delay. Mr. De Lancey knew all his advantages: and that Sir Charles Hardy might be at no loss to conjecture that the house was now acting at his beck, nor himself under the necessity of
<PB N="82" REF="008163_0080_102E413309B24CC0"/>joining with the council against the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill, absented himself from the consultations of that board. The ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>bouring colonies in the mean time were urging the dispatch of our preparations for opening the campaign. Reduced at length by these perplexities, he was obliged to send for his lieutenant, and gave him his promise to pass the favourite bill for payment of the public debts. The house then privately took back the quota-bill; and after a few alterations, the council passed it on the 31st of March. To both of them Sir Charles gave his assent the following day: and they were enrolled among our laws. I leave this affair to your Lordship's own reflections; observing only, that from this period, the lieutenant governor's influence became more apparent than before — and that as it always was, so it will ever continue to be, his ruling passion, and the grand engine of his politics, to crush or controul the King's governors in this province.</P>
<P>THE plan of operations,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intelli∣gence from En∣gland.</NOTE> concerted at New York in December, was a few days after transmitted to Sir Thomas Robinson, to be laid before his Majesty, for the royal approbation
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pownal importuned Mr. Shirley to be made the bearer of these dis∣patches.

Upon the arrival of the first vessels from Europe in April following, we were surprised with these remarkable articles of intelligence: That the action at Lake George had been magnified in England into an almost decisive victory—that Mr Johnson was advanced to the dignity of a baronet, and 5000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling voted by the commons, as a farther reward for his great services—that Eyres, his engineer, was raised to a majority—and Wraxal, his secretary to the command of a company.

I will not assert,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The gene∣ral arrives at Albany, and calls a council of war;</NOTE> that Mr. Shirley had yet received his Majesty's orders with respect to the late plan of operations. I believe he had not — because on the 7th of May he arrived at Albany, and conti∣nued his preparations for carrying that plan into execution, until the 25th of the month, when a council of war was there held, con∣sisting of the following members:
<LIST>
<HEAD>His Excellency the GENERAL.</HEAD>
<ITEM>Lieut. Col. Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Lieut. Col. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton, Major Chapman,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Major Sparks, Sir John St. Clair, John Montreser, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> chief engineer.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Mr. Shirley laid before them the minutes of the congress in Decem∣ber, and acquainted them with the state of affairs.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and ac∣quaints them with the situa∣tion of affairs.</NOTE> With respect to the western expedition the naval force upon the lake consisted, he observed, of two vessels of ten carriage-guns each; two row-gallies, each of ten swivels; and that he had three months before issued orders for building three other vessels, one of eighteen, another of sixteen, and a third of twelve carriage-guns. Besides which, there would be 250 Whale-boats upon the lake, each of them capable of containing 16 men. The land forces then at Oswego, and on their march for preserving a free communica∣tion between that place and Albany, where his own and Pepperell's regiments, with that raised and supported by the province of New Jersey, and the four independent companies of New York. As there was a magazine of provisions and stores at the Canajohary Falls, about 35 miles from Schenectady; his excellency proposed posting there 100 men out of those forces: as many more at the German Flats, to secure another magazine, guard the portage, and convoy the provisions thro' the Wood Creek: and as the fall near Oswego occasioned another small portage, a fort was there also to be erected, for a garrison of fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty men at least. It was, my Lord, of the greatest moment to keep open the communication between Albany and our fort on the lake; his excellency was therefore intent upon raising four companies of sixty privates each, to be em∣ployed in scouting along the passage, and harrassing the French set∣tlements between Frontenac and Montreal.</P>
<P>THE general gave them also an account of the strength of Oswe∣go, when he left it the last fall — adding, that he had sent up Mr. M'Keller, the engineer in second, and Mr. Sewer, a practiti∣oner engineer, with orders to make such additional works, as they should think necessary for the security of that important post. And
<PB N="84" REF="008163_0082_102E4137EFAC6050"/>your Lordship will be pleased to take notice, that these orders were issued very early in March, before the Mohawk river was open; and that the engineers actually arrived at Oswego in April. At these several garrisons were to be deposited six months provi∣sions for 7000; and he observed to the council, that for that pur∣pose, 200 whaleboats and 500 battoes had been dispatched since the first of April from Schenectady. The remaining quantity would have been transported by the middle of July, had his designs been carried into execution.</P>
<P>As to the provincial expedition, he informed them — that the troops voted by the several colonies amounted to 8800 men, inclu∣ding the officers and garrisons at the sorts Edward and William-Henry. One, or perhaps two hundred Indians might be expected to join them▪ besides a company which his excellency had raised, to harrass the enemy upon lake Champlain, and procure intelli∣gence of their motions in Canada; and three more, for the like service, were intended to be chosen out of the whole force destined for Crown Point.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time one Rogers, of New Hampshire, capt. of a ranging company,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Capt Ro∣gers, an active of∣ficer, gains intelli∣gence; of which the general informs the coun∣cil.</NOTE> gave repeated demonstrations of his activity in the neighbourhood of Crown Point. He made many incursions upon the enemy, fell on their scattered parties, and scarce ever re∣turned to Fort William-Henry without scalps and prisoners. The general took particular notice of him; and he became singularly serviceable in procuring intelligence. By a cadet, whom he took on the 20th of May, we were informed, that the whole number of men at Fort St. Frederic, Tinonderoge, and at an advanced post, were 1100, composed of the regiments of Languedoc, the Queen's regiment, two companies of the colony troops, and the militia. Besides these, there were Indians; but their numbers uncertain: that at Tinonderoge the French had twelve pieces of ordnance mounted, and carriages preparing for an additional number; but that the retrenchment at the advanced post was without any can∣non. These troops wintered at Montreal and Chambly; and ar∣rived at the south end of the lake about the middle of April, be∣ing plentifully supplied with provisions and mil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tary stores.—These intelligences the general laid before his council; and then observed that the 50th and 51st regiments, the four independent com∣panies, and the regiment of New Jersey, were scarce a third part of the number of troops designed by the general plan for the opera∣tions upon Lake Ontario: that the provincials were also not only
<PB N="85" REF="008163_0083_102E417751A0E0E0"/>deficient of the complement thought necessary at the congress, but even of the number voted by the provinces concerned in the enter∣prize against Crown Point; and that it was impracticable, even with the junction of the 44th and 48th regiments, then at Albany, to carry on both the northern and western expeditions at the same time: that he had no dependance upon the Indians of the Six Na∣tions; Sir William Johnson being unable to procure scouting par∣ties; and that upon this account he proposed raising four compa∣nies for that service.</P>
<P>YOUR Lordship may hence observe, what reason the congress in December had for their opinion, that more troops were necessary for his Majesty's service in America. No reinforcements being yet arrived from England, for carrying the general plan into exe∣cution, the council were of unanimous opinion—that 1300 ought to be posted at Oswego, 50 at the Falls,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their o∣pinion and advice.</NOTE> 200 at the Oneida Car∣rying Place, 150 at the German Flatts, and as many more at the Conejohary Falls. They advised therefore, — that the 50th and 51st, and the New Jersey regiments, the independents, and the North Carolina provincials (all which amounted to about 2000 men) should be employed in that service. The 44th and 48th regiments, with the colony troops, were thought sufficient to re∣duce Crown Point. Accordingly, they recommended their junc∣tion: advising, however, that the regulars should continue for a time in their encampment at Albany. — The ranging companies, proposed by the general, were highly approved; and the raising of others strongly recommended. They also concurred with him in sentiment — that a road ought to be made from the German Flatts to Oswego: and declared, it appeared to them very neces∣sary to strengthen Fort Edward, and erect another at the South Bay, The former was a deposit for stores, and at the concurrence of all the routes from Crown Point to Albany. The latter would com∣mand the route taken by baron Dieskan for his designed attack upon Fort Edward — a route thro' which incursions were frequent∣ly made upon our northern frontier.

<PB N="86" REF="008163_0084_102E413A8350C528"/>The propriety of this advice, my Lord, must be evi∣dent to every man of a tolerable acquaintance with the country; and these were the very sentiments which the general repeatedly communicated to Sir William Johnson, in his letters, after the action at Lake George; which were then slighted by the cabal, who studiously opposed him in all his measures.</P>
<P>THUS I have shewn your Lordship the reasons why the general plan continued to be unexecuted, till the sitting of this last council of war. Mr. Shirley, however, in hopes of the arrival of the expected reinforcements, and loth to be diverted from his favou∣rite designs upon Lake Ontario, continued to throw large quan∣tities of provisions and stores into Schenectady, and all the ma∣gazines between that place and Oswego. This, it was supposed, was done to induce his successor, from these ample supplies, to act upon this quarter; it being universally imagined, that Crown Point was now become the main object of the ministry. Till the arrival of General Webb on the 7th of June, this was only conjecture, and general report. The effects of the misrepresen∣tations of American affairs in England, then became evident to all; for the stores laid in at Schenectady were now reconveyed to Albany for the nothern expedition; and fresh clamours excited against Mr. Shirley, for his supplies towards the western operations. On the 15th of June,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Major Ge∣neral A∣berc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbie takes the command of the army.</NOTE> Major General Abercrombie landed at New York; and ten days after at Albany; where he immediately took upon himself the command of the army. Shirley continued there no longer than to deliver over to the new general the proper returns, and communicate such information as appeared necessary, with re∣spect to the present situation of affairs.</P>
<P>THE whole force, of which General Abercromble now took the command, consisted of the 44th, 48th, 50th, and 51st regi∣ments, four independent companies, the New Jersey regiment, four companies raised by the province of North Carolina, Otway's, and the Highland regiments
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These two regiments arrived with him, and consisted of about 900 men.</NOTE>, and the provincial forces destined against Crown Point.</P>
<P>INSTRUCTIONS had been given to Sir William Johnson, to procure a large body of the Six Nations,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir William Johnson holds a conference at Onon∣daga.</NOTE>, to join in any attempt that might be made upon the Lake Ontario; and to engage 100 more, for the assistance of the provincial army. To effect which, he was then holding a conference with the deputies of the Six
<PB N="87" REF="008163_0085_102DD0649298D570"/>Cantons at Onondaga; from whence he was to proceed immedi∣ately to Oswego. Mr. Shirley had, besides, raised a company of Indians from Stockbridge, to be employed in ranging the woods between Fort William-Henry and Montreal: and that his Ma∣jesty's service upon Lake Ontaric might be free from the ob∣structions, by which it hath been the year before greatly embar∣rassed, he had inlisted 40 companies of battoemen, each of 50 men,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forty companies of bart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e men rais∣ed, and their great usefulness.</NOTE> a captain and an assistant, for transporting stores and provisions to Oswego. These were put under the direction of Capt. Bradstreet, an active vigilant officer, inured to the hardships to which that service inevitably exposed him. This, tho' one of the most judicious measures that could have been taken, was made the subject of low invective. The faction at New York laboured to represent it as a project to involve the Crown in a needless expence: but time has given the fullest evidence of the propriety of this step; and <HI>proper</HI> it will appear to your Lordship, before the conclusion of this letter. General Shirley wisely foresaw, that the Indians of the Six Nations, whatever influence over them Sir William John∣son might pretend, could not be engaged even to protect the King's troops in the passage thro' their own country; and that unless the communication was kept open to Oswego, nothing could be effec∣ted upon the Lake, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the garrison itself preserved from falling into the hands of the enemy. Accordingly,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A small post cut off in the Indian countrys</NOTE> no sooner did the spring open, than a little blockaded post, with 25 men, at the Car∣rying-Place, in the very center of the Oneida country, was cut off; the Oneidas themselves being unquestionably concerned in the mas∣sacre. Nothing could secure us against the repetition of these in∣sults, but passing through the country with large squadrons of battoes: and to facilitate the transportation, Mr. Shirley, who can∣vassed every expedient for the preservation of Oswego, employed a working party of 80 men, under a director, to remove the ob∣structions in the Wood Creek; by this means, the portage from the Mohawks River, across the great Carrying-Place, was reduced from eight miles to one. Nor did he omit observing to his successor, that an attempt upon Niagara was of the last importance; the loss or preservation of our Indians depending upon the success of the operations on Lake Ontario.</P>
<P>RELATIVE to the Crown Point expedition, he recommended the march of part of the army, in a new discovered route, on the west side of Lake George, to the enemy's advanced works, five
<PB N="88" REF="008163_0086_102E413D08A53220"/>miles short of Tinonderoge. Which being carried, the heavy ar∣tillery and stores might be there landed, and transported thro' a road to Tinonderoge and Fort Frederic: and after the reduction of those fortresses, he advised General Abercrombie immediately to construct armed vessels, to secure the command of Lake Champlain.</P>
<P>YOUR LORDSHIP may remember,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Governor Sharpe's designed attempt on fort Du Quesne fails.</NOTE> that an attempt was propo∣sed, at the congress in December, against Fort Du Quesne, with an army of 3000 provincials. Gov. Sharpe was to have com∣manded in that enterprize; but there remained now no hopes of its prosecution. Virginia chose to be intirely upon the defensive. — Maryland was wholly inactive; her frontier being covered by the adjoining provinces — and as to Pensylvania, she raised indeed 1500 men, but only with a view to protect her out-farms; nor probably would thus far have consulted her own safety, but for the daily murders and horrid cruelties perpetrated upon her borders.</P>
<P>WITH respect to the circumstances of Indian affairs to the north∣ward — While Mr. Shirley was at Oswego,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Circum∣stances of Indian af∣fairs to the north ward.</NOTE> and upon his return, as I before observed to your Lordship, he proposed to the Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, and Oneidas, the erection of small forts for the protection of their respective castles. The two last tribes consented, desiring also, that the forts might be mounted with cannon: and the Tuscoraras afterwards sent deputies to him, with the like request: — the Senecas and Cayugas had also lately signified their acquiescence to Sir William Johnson; and the general transmitted him the plan of a fort, directing the prose∣cution of the work with all possible dispatch, as a most effectual means to secure the Indian country to his Majesty.</P>
<P>BEFORE Mr. Shirley left Oswego the last year, he proposed to the Six Nations their convening this summer, in a grand council there, the Indians on the north side of lake Ontario, and round lake Erie, to consult their common interest, and maintain a correspon∣dence by annual councils at Oswego. And to draw off the latter from their attachment to the French, recommended to the Six Nations their concurrence, in opening a free trade with the foreign Indians, at the entrance of the Onondaga river, upon terms more advantageous to all the Indians than any hitherto pursued. This spring Sir William Johnson informed his excellency, that the Six
<PB N="89" REF="008163_0087_102E417CC9B7C718"/>Nations were extremely well pleased with the projects relating both to the trade at Oswego, and the construction of forts in their can∣tons. To accelerate the latter, the general supplied him with 5000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling, in addition to 5000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> advanced to him by General Brad∣dock: and yet, my Lord, he was constrained to confess, in a sub∣sequent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">10 May, 1756.</NOTE> letter, that unless his excellency could engage several companies of rangers, he despaired of the preservation even of a free passage thro' their country: and whether he has to this day built a single fort, as the general proposed, I have not been able, after much inquiry, to discover.</P>
<P>EQUALLY unpromising was the situation of our affairs with the southern Indians.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation of our af∣faires with the sou∣thern In∣dians.</NOTE> Some hopes indeed were entertained of the fidelity of the Cherokees — a people warlike and powerful; in whose territories the Virginians were erecting a fortress. The Shawanese nevertheless continued their eruptions into that province: and Go∣vernor Dinwiddie was obliged to draft the militia, to oppose their progress, and preserve the town of Winchester. These Indians al∣so, with the Susquehanas and Delawares, committed frequent hos∣tilities upon the Pensylvanians. Governour Morris, for the pro∣tection of the country, carried a line of forts on the west side of the Kittatiny mountains, all along the extended frontier of that colony, from Delaware to the river Potowmac. The government of New Jersey proceeded even to declare war against the Delaware Indians; and would have penetrated into their settlements, had not assurances been sent by Sir William Johnson from the council at Onondaga, that the Delawares and Shawanese, in obedience to the Six Nations, were under renewed and possitive engagements, to refrain from any farther outrages upon the southern frontiers. If any such promises were really made, 'tis certain they were immedi∣ately broken, many of our inhabitants having since been murdered and captivated by the savages of those very tribes. Whence we may fairly conclude, that either the Six Nations connived at these infractions of their commands; or that their antient sovereignty is become the contempt of their tributaries. In fact, my Lord, the matter is still worse. Too much reason is there to believe the truth of both these alternatives.</P>
<P>I INFORMED your Lordship,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Willi∣am John∣son's con∣duct con∣sidered.</NOTE> that Sir William Johnson was order∣ed to proceed from Onondaga to Oswego, with as many Indians
<PB N="90" REF="008163_0088_102E413F8E4D54C8"/>as could be perswaded to march with him; not only for the more effectual preservation of that post, but to execute the plan which Gen. Shirley had concerted, for the establishment of an annual coun∣cil there, with those Indians who had been long in the French in∣terest, and seemed ready to listen to proposals for an alliance with us. It was expedient, my Lord, that he should have complied with these instructions, nay it was his duty; but no sooner was he acquainted with Mr. Shirley's resignation of the command of the army, than he returned from Onondaga to Albany, at the head of about 60 Indians; leaving Capt. Patten with his company of gre∣nadiers, to wander thro' a forlorn wilderness, in search of Oswego. Whether this instance of his conduct was not intended to raise his reputation with the new general, as a leading man among the In∣dians, I leave to your Lordship's conjecture. By arts like these, he acquired his Indian fame: and the influence of the faction at New York so powerfully sustained it, that few persons doubted his ability to procure several hundred warriors for our assistance, tho' every day exhibited fresh proofs of their melancholy defection. Besides the destruction of our post in the very country of the One∣idas mentioned before, the enemy infested the parts about Oswego, and the whole passage thither, without the least opposition from the Six Nations. Alarms indeed were frequently given of the ap∣proach of their flying parties; and it was observable, that Sir. Wil∣liam Johnson, on those occasions, as Colonel of the county, raised the militia of Albany, and proceeded to the spot; tho' every man acquainted with Indians well knows, that of all places, these are the most unlikely for finding the enemy. By such sham expediti∣ons have our northern inhabitants been impoverished and distressed: nor could they answer any other end, than to raise a bruit thro' the colonies; and with parade and ostentation set the gazetteers upon sounding his applause. — Even in these wild romantic excursions, but few Indians attended him: and yet if we credit our news wri∣ters, hundreds were in his train.</P>
<P>MR. SHIRLEY had scarce resigned the command to Major Ge∣neral Abercrombie,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of a gal∣lant action of our bat∣to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> men under Capt. Bradstreet</NOTE> when the good effect of the battoe service be∣came so irresistibly evident, that his very enemies recollected their ungrounded calumnies with shame and confusion. — I allude, my Lord, to the action between the French and our battoe men, on the 3d of July. Sensible of the importance of Oswego, the enemy col∣lected themselves about the latter end of May in a large body, not
<PB N="91" REF="008163_0089_102E418090E539D0"/>many miles to the eastward of that garrison; from whence detach∣ments were perpetually sent out to fall upon our workmen, and in∣fest the passage thro' the Onondaga River. Capt. Bradstreet, who had the direction of the battoes, was apprized that small parties lay in ambush, waiting a favourable opportunity to attack him. Ac∣cordingly, when he left Oswego, he ordered the several divisions to proceed as near each other as possible: but so numerous and ir∣regular a body could not without difficulty be kept to any tolera∣ble order. He was at the head of about 300 battoe-men, in the first division, upon his return to Schenectady; and about nine miles from Oswego, when the enemy, who were 700 strong, rose from their ambuscade, and fired upon his front. Near the place of at∣tack, was a small Island, by which the enemy might easily have forded the river. Bradstreet in an instant landed upon the island, to prevent being inclosed between two fires; and with six men maintained his possession, bravely repelling twenty of the enemy, who attempted to seize that advantageous post. He was then rein∣forced with six others; and even compelled a second party of 40 French to give way. Enraged at this shameful disappointment, the enemy, to the number of 70 men, thought proper to make a third attempt; but the battoe-men, who did not exceed 20, with redoubled bravery still kept their ground, and again forced their adversaries to retire. During these skirmishes, which lasted near an hour, the battoe-men in the rear landed, without loss or confu∣sion, upon the south side of the river. Four hundred of the enemy now advanced up the north side of the stream, intending to ford it about a mile higher, and surround us. Bradstreet, aware of the design, left the island, and with two hundred men marched on the other side to oppose them. But they had actually forded over, be∣fore he came up, and posted themselves in a swamp. Dr. Kirk∣land, with the second division of battoes, was now advancing to his assistance; but Bradstreet ordered, and Capt. Butler, who com∣manded the third division, to keep their posts, and cover the bat∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s in the rear. Being arrived at the swamp, an engagement en∣sued in the Indian manner of fighting and continued above an hour with dubious success. Bradstreet, at length animating his men, rush∣ed into the thicket thro' twice his number, and gallantly pushed them into the river, where many of them perished. Another attempt was made, in the mean time, to ford the river a little higher; but those being also repulsed, the whole party was intirely routed and dispersed.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="008163_0090_102E41421F8BC670"/>
JUST after the defeat, Capt. Patten, with his grenadiers from Onondaga, fell in with our battoes; and the next morning a reinforcement of 200 men came up from the garrison, and but for the excessive rains, which began soon after the action, and continued all the next day, these brave battoe-men would probably have cut off the whole party. Had Sir William Johnson, as was expected, accompanied Capt. Patten to Oswego, with the In∣dians from Onondaga, Bradstreet might have made immediate pursuit, and many of the enemy must have been overtaken: but this pacific plenipotentiary was then hastening to Albany (a safe situation) with the important minutes of his late conference. A conference full of affectionate Indian speeches, and large promises of their assistance; when scarce a man of them could be prevailed upon to turn out of his hut for the defence of the common cause. Bradstreet had but 3 Indians of the Six Nations with him at this attack. Of these, one took to his heels; a second fought bravely; but the third went over to the enemy, and assisted in pointing out our officers. In these several actions we had about 30 men killed and wounded. How many of the French were slain, is not certainly known; tho' it is generally said, they lost about 120. Eighty Arms were brought to Schenectady; and about 70 men found in the woods, and carried to Oswego. The French fled in the utmost disorder, and some of their regular soldiers, being strangers to the country, got bewildered in the desart, and perished for want of sustenance.</P>
<P>BRADSTREET arrived at Schenectady on the 11th of July;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bradstreet gives in¦telligence of the ene∣my's de∣sign to at∣tack Os∣wego.</NOTE> and the next day acquainted General Abercrombie at Albany of the state of Oswego.—That he learnt from his prisoners, the French were preparing to attack it, having 1200 men for that purpose en∣camped not far from the easternmost fort. Upon the receipt of this intelligence, orders were issued to Major General Webb, to hold himself in readiness to march for its defence with the 44th regiment. My Lord, Mr. Shirley had, several days before
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the 26th of June, the day after he was superseded.</NOTE>, ad∣vised General Abercrombie to reinforce that garrison with
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Such a reinforcement could easily have been spared for that purpose, Otway's and the Highland regiment being now landed at Albany.

<PB N="93" REF="008163_0091_102DD06723BAA6F8"/>as Bradstreet was ready to convoy the troops, and every magazine, along the passage, plentifully supplied with provisions. But not to anticipate my story;</P>
<P>MR. SHIRLEY arrived at New York on the 4th of July,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Lon∣don arri∣ves.</NOTE> and waited the arrival of my Lord London, who landed there on the 23d of that month, with Mr. Pownal in his train: but in what character the latter returned a second time from England, was a subject of doubtful conjecture.—His Lordship, regardless of his ease, and the fatigues of a tedious voyage, tarried there but three days; and on the 29th of July reached his head quarters at Albany, when he took upon himself the command of the army.</P>
<P>THE garrison of Oswego consisted now of 1400 men, and about 300 workmen and sailors. Four hundred and eighty-five were posted, in small parties, between that place and Burnet's Field, to maintain an open passage thro' the country of the Six Nations. The 44th and 48th regiments at Albany and Schenectady, with the British troops just arrived, consisted now of 2600 men; and the provincials, under the command of General Winslow, were about 7000, and ready to march from Fort William-Henry.— Of the naval force of Oswego, I have already given your Lordship an account: and as to the strength of the enemy at Tinonderoge and Crown Point, according to the latest intelligence obtained by Capt. Rogers, they did not exceed 3000 men.</P>
<P>FROM his Lordship's known abilities for war,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our pre∣sent force, and that of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> the colonies were in great hopes, that notwithstanding the delay of the British rein∣forcements, some coup d'eclat would very speedily be struck at Crown Point. But alas! while we were intent upon this favourite design, the enemy were heading their main force, not to oppose us at Tinonderoge, but to secure what was to them a matter of much more importance, I mean the exclusive dominion of the great Lakes—Accordingly, they laid siege to Oswego;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oswego <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> and after two or three days contest, obliged the garrison, on the 14th of August, to surrender themselves prisoners of war. This melancholy ac∣count was first brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Albany by several soldiers, some of whom had formerly deserted the French service; and remained many days unconfirmed, till the arrival of two sailors, who made their escape after the reduction of the forts. An universal sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k was now given to the whole continent: and to increase our dis∣tress, the Indians reported, that the whole garrison was put to the sword, and the dead bodies of our country men denied even
<PB N="94" REF="008163_0092_102E4143A5789B08"/>the sacred rite of sepultre. But this, by subsequent advices, was contradicted: and the spies, dispatched for observation, inform us, that the works are intirely demolished, and the enemy departed. In what manner,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Circum∣stances of the siege unknown.</NOTE> and by what numbers, it was taken, or upon what terms surrendered, I cannot give your Lordship any satis∣factory account. How many were killed on either side is also un∣known; tho' certain it is that Lieut. Col. Mercer, the command∣ing officer, is among the slain.</P>
<P>IT is much to be wished, my Lord, that Mr. Shirley's advice to General Abercrombie had been followed: and equally to be regretted, that Sir William Johnson returned with such precipita∣tion from Onondaga to Albany.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battoe∣men im∣prudently discharged</NOTE> Nor ought the discharge of 400 battoe-men, after Bradstreet's return, to pass without some remark. They arrived at Schenectady, as I observed before, on the 11th of July; and methinks the recent proofs of their cou∣rage, and the account they gave of the strength and designs of the enemy, might have been a sufficient antidote against the poison of that council for their discharge; which was unquestionably de∣signed by Mr. Shirley's enemies for throwing an odium on his measures.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">General Webb's march de∣layed.</NOTE> To the same influence, my Lord, it was undoubtedly owing, that General Webb's march, with the 44th regiment from Schenectady, was delayed till the 12th of August, but two days before the garrison was actually surrendered. He had proceeded no farther than Burnet's Field, with his regiment of 900 men, and the remaining 800 battoe-men, when the deserters brought him the news of the siege. Upon the receipt of which, he made a forced march to the Oneida Carrying-Place; where he immediately felled trees into the Wood Creek to prevent the approach of the

<P>THESE, my Lord, were great oversights: but the loss of Os∣wego must principally be ascribed to a more distant cause — to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uncto, who have all along embarrassed every part of his Majesty's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervice on the Lake Ontario. By their misrepresentations, the
<PB N="95" REF="008163_0093_102E418410891010"/>public has been drawn into a dependence upon the Six Nations, merely to exalt Sir William Johnson: and that nothing might be wanting to procure a change in the command of the army, and destroy all confidence in Shirley's judgment, Oswego the great object of his attention, has been slighted as an unessential post; and the reduction of St. Frederic represented as a point of far superior moment.</P>
<P>MY LORD,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Unhappy conse∣quences of the lost of this im∣portant post.</NOTE> by these intrigues our country bleeds — Oswego is lost — lost perhaps for ever, — with the naval armament—above 60 pieces of ordnance, and a rich supply of stores and provisions, laid in at a vast expence, for several thousand men, during the whole cam∣paign. — Would to God this was all, and we had nothing worse to apprehend! — Our furr trade, which has long been the princi∣pal object of the national attention, and the support of our frontier city of Albany, is at an end. The French can now with the utmost facility secure the inland country, and confine us to the very brinks of the ocean — a free communication is opened between Canada and Louisiana; and all our intercourse with the Indians totally re∣scinded. The enemy, on the other hand, may, without opposition or restraint, render these innumerable tribes of savages their allies and dependants. The Six Nations are more wavering than ever: and should they no longer think it expedient to preserve their neu∣trality, the whole continent must inevitably become a field of blood. Whatever may be thought of these colonies, which of late have been magnified for their numbers and opulence,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The colo∣nies not so power∣ful as im∣agined.</NOTE> I do assure your Lord∣ship, that a short war will effectually exhaust them. Their settle∣ments are scattered; their frontiers extensive; the inhabitants but few, generally in very moderate circumstances, and still luxurious, and without resources. The irruption of a few Indians into Penn∣sylvania, had already occasioned the loss of several hundred souls, and the desolation of near two thousand farms. The frontiers of the neighbouring colonies are equally defenceless: and the power of the native savages, at present in the French interest, is of itself sufficient, by slow but inevitable means, to reduce us to extreme beggary and distress.</P>
<P>THUS, my Lord I have finished the relation of what has hitherto been transacted in America.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">General <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the whole.</NOTE> I have not only presented you with a series of the most interesting events, but brought your Lordship acquainted with the characters and designs of the principal agents
<PB N="96" REF="008163_0094_102E41452D6FBAA8"/>in our political affairs. If I have erred, I am persuaded it is not in any article of importance, nor purposely in the minutest. — E∣very line of this letter hath been penned with the most sacred vene∣ration for truth, and a mind equally unbiassed by resentment or affection. — For obtaining an intimate acquaintance with the mat∣ters rehearsed, few in the colonies have had superior advantages: nor in collecting proper materials, has any one been more assiduous. Add to this, that I had no other interest in the public measures, than the interest of every man on the continent. I am unconnected with all parties; neither enjoying any post myself, nor standing in the least relation to a single officer in the army. The love of my country was the sole spring of my curiosity; and so far, indeed, I was not an unconcerned spectator of the publick transactions. If I have made honourable mention of General Shirley, it was owing to my approbation of his schemes, as conducive to the com∣mon-weal of the british plantations: and if my judgment was in this regard erronious, I have the pleasure to find myself in very respectable company. Except New York, or rather a prevailing faction there, all the colonies hold him in very high esteem. Some have made public declarations of their sense of his great merit; and that too, at a time when he appeared descending from his meridian of glory. But he needed no other than the testimonials of his own province; for he, my Lord, whose conduct is approved by the people of the Massachusets Bay, must be distinguished both for his abilities and his virtue. They are too numerous and wise to be deceived, too free and independent to be driven. An undue influence can never be obtained by the governor of a colony, who has neither power nor places to bestow. — Their assemblies are annual — the members elected by ballot, in number near 200. — The council, or middle estate, chosen yearly by the assembly; — and as all the of∣fices are elective, not a man in the province is dependent on the smiles or the frowns of the King's representative: — and yet so wise, free, and loyal a people have approved his judgment; confi∣ded in his integrity; testified in his favour; and publickly lamented his departure from the continent. I would by no means, my Lord, be understood, by these favourable sentiments of Shirley, to dispa∣rage his noble Successor in the command. He yet has not, at least he deserves not to have, a single enemy amongst us: and I hope it will serve the purposes of no man to be his enemy. I could only have wished, that at this critical juncture, a gentleman so tho∣roughly
<PB N="97" REF="008163_0095_102E41879F753900"/>versed in American affairs, had been continued in America for his Lordship's assistance. We have to contend with a subtle enterprising foe—a foe, rapacious, martial, and bloody, committing murders, rather than waging war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tho' the French colony con∣tains perhaps not 30,000 men capable to bear arms; yet these are all under the despotic command and sole direction of their gover∣nor-general; and experience teaches us, that in spite of our navy, they may be annually reinforced. The strength of our colonies, on the other hand, is divided; and the concurrence of all neces∣saries both for supplies of men and money. Jealous are they of each other—some ill-constituted—others shaken with intestine di∣visions—and, if I may be allowed the expression, parsimonious even to prodigality. Our assemblies are diffident of their gover∣nors—governors despise their assemblies, and both mutually mis∣represent each other to the Court of Great Britain. Military mea∣sures demand secrecy and dispatch: but while the colonies remain undivided, and nothing can be transacted but with their universal assent, 'tis impossible to maintain the one, or proceed with the other. Without a general constitution for warlike operations, we can neither plan nor execute. We have a common interest, and must have a common council, <HI>one head,</HI> and <HI>one purse.</HI> — The French service is unexposed to those embarrassments; and hence they project without discovery, and we scarce collect their designs, till we are attacked and defeated. Hitherto they have prosecuted the war with superior advantage; and yet the militia of the pro∣vince of the Massachusets Bay alone, undoubtedly exceeds, by some thousands, all the troops of Canada. Since the commence∣ment of the present hostilities, his Majesty has lost above 3000 loyal subjects: and as all the Indians are at the devotion of the French, and Oswego is now lost, many thousand farms before the opening of the next spring, will probably be abandoned; and the interior settlements deluged with the innocent blood of all ages and sexes. Indeed, my Lord, 'tis not beneath the most elevated station, to indulge the benevolent feelings of humanity; nor, reti∣ring awhile from the pomp and gaiety that surrounds you, to shed a pitying tear over families inhumanly bereft of their substance, or more inhumanly sloughtered in their beds. — It is a celebrated saying, and does honour to human nature, <Q>Homo sum, et nihil humanum a me alienum puto.</Q></P>

WHAT the present or the next campaign will bring forth, it known only to the Omniscient Governor of the universe. The co∣lonies are nearly exhausted, and their funds already anticipated by expensive unexecuted projects: and whether they will still continue their efforts, or resign to a listless despair, is uncertain. I fear the worst — and yet you know, my Lord, I am not of a melancholy cast. There is too much reason for general concern: and I ven∣ture to predict, what every judicious person foresees, that unless some successful blow is struck—and speedily struck, at the power of France, Britain must inevitably lose her possessions in America. An event my Lord, of the most tremendous consequence to us — to you—to the Protestant religion—to the peace of Europe— yes — and to the peace and happiness of all mankind.</P>
<P>HITHERTO we have wasted our strength in lopping off branches, when the axe should have been laid to the root of the tree. Canada, my Lord, Canada must be demolished — Delenda est Carthago — or we are undone. Strength sufficient have we left, with proper as∣sistance, for a decisive struggle: but a lingring consumption will in∣fallibly enervate and destroy. France has been, ever can, and will be annually, throwing over fresh troops into her colony, in defiance of our great maritime force: and should peace ensue, even before our ruin is compleated, what will be the state of these provinces upon the next rupture between the two crowns, when the inland country is filled with our enemies? — As you therefore value, my noble Lord, the cause of liberty; the glory of the British name; the honour and dignity of the best of Kings; and the preservation of these colonies from bloody carnage and total ruin; exert, I be∣seech you, exert your influence, to extirpate this brood of French savages from the face of the continent. In a scheme so decisive, and in no other, will the provinces heartily unite; and if well con∣certed, and our unfortified sea-coasts at the same time sufficiently protected; it will doubtless succeed — humble the pride of France — and close the present war with a lasting and honourable peace.</P>
