<P>Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the Dead, and <HI>CHRIST</HI> shall give thee Light.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN discoursing on these Words, I shall, with the Help of GOD,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Describe the Sleepers to whom they are spoken.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Inforce the Exhortation <HI>Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the Dead.</HI> And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Explain the Promise made to such as do awake and arise, CHRIST <HI>shall give thee Light.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. 1. And first, as to the Sleepers here spoken to. By Sleep is signified the natural State of Man; that deep Sleep of the Soul into which the Sin of <HI>Adam</HI> hath cast all who spring from his Loins; that Supineness, Indolence and Stupidity, that Insensibi∣lity of his real Condition, wherein every Man comes into the World, and continues 'till the Voice of GOD awakes him.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now <HI>they that sleeps sleep in the Night.</HI> The State of Na∣ture is a State of utter Darkness; a State wherein <HI>Darkness covers the Earth, and gross Darkness the People.</HI> The poor unawakened Sinner, how much Knowledge soever he may have, as to other Things, has no Knowledge of himself: In this Respect <HI>he know∣eth Nothing yet as he ought to know.</HI> He knows not that he is a fallen Spirit, whose only Business in this present World is to recover from his Fall, to regain that Image of GOD wherein he was created. He sees no <HI>Necessity</HI> for <HI>the one Thing needful,</HI> even that inward universal Change, that <HI>Birth from above,</HI> (figured out by Baptism,) which is the Beginning of that total Renovati∣on, that Sanctification of Spirit, Soul and Body, <HI>without which no Man shall see the</HI> LORD.</P>
<P N="3">3. Full of all Diseases as he is, he fancies himself in perfect Health: Fast bound in Misery and Iron, he dreams that he is happy, and at Liberty. He says, Peace, Peace, while the Devil, <HI>as a strong Man armed,</HI> is in full possession of his Soul. He sleeps on still, and takes his Rest, tho' Hell is moved from beneath to meet him; tho' the Pit, from whence there is no Return, hath opened its Mouth to swallow him up: A Fire is kindled around
<PB N="3" REF="042191_0003_101BA5F99F6F4590"/>
him, yet he knoweth it not; yea, it burns him, yet he lays it not to Heart.</P>
<P N="4">4. By one who sleeps, we are therefore to understand (and would to GOD we might all understand it!) a Sinner satisfied in his Sins, contented to remain in his fallen State, to live and die without the Image of GOD: One who is ignorant both of his Disease, and of the only Remedy for it: One who never was warned, or never regarded the warning Voice of GOD <HI>to flee from the Wrath to come:</HI> One that never yet saw he was in Danger of Hell-fire, or cried in the Earnestness of his Soul, <HI>What must I do to be saved?</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. If this Sleeper be not outwardly vicious, his Sleep is usu∣ally the deepest of all: Whether he be of the <HI>Laodicean</HI> Spirit, <HI>neither cold nor hot;</HI> but a quiet, rational, inoffensive, good-na∣tured Professor of the Religion of his Fathers; or whether he be zealous and orthodox, and <HI>after the straitest Sect of our Religion, lives a Pharisee,</HI> that is, according to the scriptural Account, one that <HI>justifies himself;</HI> one that labours <HI>to establish his own Righ∣teousness,</HI> as the Ground of his Acceptance with GOD.</P>
<P N="6">6. This is he, who, <HI>having the Form of Godliness, denies the Power thereof;</HI> yea, and probably reviles it wheresoever it is found, as mere Extravagance and Delusion. Mean-while, the wretched Self-deceiver thanks GOD that <HI>he is not as other Men are; Adulterers, Unjust, Extortioners:</HI> No, he doth no Wrong to any Man. He <HI>fasts twice in the Week,</HI> uses all the Means of Grace, is constant at Church and Sacrament; yea, and <HI>gives Tythes of all that he has,</HI> does all the Good that he can: <HI>Touching the Righ∣teousness of the Law,</HI> he is <HI>blameless:</HI> He wants Nothing of God∣liness, but the Power; Nothing of Religion, but the Spirit; Nothing of Christianity, but the Truth and the Life.</P>
<P N="7">7. But know ye not, that however highly esteemed among Men, <HI>such a Christian</HI> as this may be, he is an Abomination in the Sight of GOD, and an Heir of every Woe, which the Son of GOD, Yesterday, To-day and for ever, denounces against <HI>Scribes and Pharisees, Hypocrites?</HI> He hath <HI>made clean the Outside of the Cup and Platter,</HI> but within is full of all Filthiness. <HI>An evil Dis∣ease cleaveth</HI> still <HI>unto him;</HI> so that <HI>his inward Parts are very Wick∣edness.</HI> Our LORD fitly compares him to a <HI>painted Sepulchre,</HI> which <HI>appears beautiful without;</HI> But nevertheless is <HI>full of dead Mens Bones, and of all Uncleanness.</HI> The Bones indeed are no longer dry; <HI>the Sinews and the Flesh are come upon them, and the Skin covers them above:</HI> But <HI>there is no Breath</HI> in them, no Spi∣rit of the Living God. And <HI>if any Man have not the Spirit</HI> of
<PB N="4" REF="042191_0004_101BA5FC61907010"/>
CHRIST, <HI>he is none of His. Ye are</HI> CHRIST<HI>'s if so be that the Spi∣rit of</HI> GOD <HI>dwell in you.</HI> But if not, GOD knoweth that ye a∣bide in Death, even until now.</P>
<P N="8">8. This is another Character of the Sleeper here spoken to. He abides in Death, tho' he knows it not. He is dead unto GOD, <HI>dead in Trespasses and Sins.</HI> For, <HI>to be carnally mind∣ed, is Death.</HI> Even as it is written, <HI>by one Man Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin: And so Death passed upon all Men,</HI> not only temporal Death, but likewise spiritual and eternal. <HI>In the Day thou eatest</HI> (said GOD to <HI>Adam) thou shalt surely die:</HI> Not bodily (unless as he then became mortal) but spiritually: Thou shalt lose the Life of thy Soul: Thou shalt die to GOD; shall be separated from Him thy essential Life and Happiness.</P>
<P N="9">9. Thus first was dissolved the vital Union of our Soul with GOD; insomuch that in <HI>the Midst of</HI> natural <HI>Life we are</HI> now <HI>in</HI> spiritual <HI>Death.</HI> And herein we remain, 'till the Second <HI>Adam</HI> becomes a quickning Spirit to us, 'till He raises the Dead, the Dead in Sin, in Pleasure, Riches, or Honours. But before any dead Soul can live, he hears, (hearkens to) <HI>the Voice of the Son of</HI> GOD: He is made sensible of his lost Estate, and receives the Sentence of Death in himself. He knows himself to be <HI>dead while he liveth,</HI> dead to GOD; and all the Things of GOD: Having no more Power to perform the Actions of a living Christian, than a dead Body to perform the Functions of a liv∣ing Man.</P>
<P N="10">10. And most certain it is, that one dead in Sin, has not his <HI>Senses exercised to discern</HI> spiritual <HI>Good and Evil: Having Eyes he sees not; he hath Ears, and hears not.</HI> He doth not <HI>taste and see the</HI> LORD <HI>is gracious.</HI> He <HI>hath not seen</HI> GOD <HI>at any Time, nor heard his Voice,</HI> nor <HI>handled the Word of Life.</HI> In vain is the Name of JESUS <HI>like Ointment poured fourth,</HI> and <HI>all his Garments smell of Myrrh, Aloes, and Cassia.</HI> The Soul that sleepeth in Death, hath no Perception of any Objects of this Kind. His Heart is <HI>past feeling,</HI> and understands none of these Things.</P>
<P N="11">11. And hence, having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Senses, no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ets of spi∣ritual Knowledge, the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of GOD: Nay, he is so far from receiving them, that whatsover is spiritually discerned, is mere Foolishness unto him. He is not content with being utterly ignorant of spiri∣tual Things, but he denies the very Existence of them. And spiritual Sensation itself is to him, the Foolishness of Folly. <HI>How,</HI> saith he, <HI>can these Things be?</HI> How can any Man <HI>know</HI> that he is alive to GOD? Even as you know, that your Body is
<PB N="5" REF="042191_0005_101BA5FDEC510438"/>
now alive? Faith is the Life of the Soul; And if ye have this Life abiding in you, ye want no Mark to evidence it to <HI>your∣self,</HI> but that divine Consciousness, that <HI>Witness of</HI> GOD, which is more and greater than ten thousand human Witnesses.</P>
<P N="12">12. If He doth not now bear Witness with thy Spirit, that thou art a Child of GOD; O that He might convince thee, thou poor unawakened Sinner, by his Demonstration and Pow∣er, that thou art a Child of the Devil! O that, as I prophesy, there might now be <HI>a Noise and a Shaking,</HI> and may <HI>the Bones come together, Bone to his Bone.</HI> Then <HI>come from the four Winds, O Breath, and breathe on these Slain, that they may live!</HI> And do not ye harden your Hearts, and resist the Holy Ghost, who even now is come to <HI>convince</HI> you <HI>of Sin, because you believe not on the Name of the only begotten Son of</HI> GOD.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. Wherefore <HI>Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the Dead.</HI> GOD calleth thee now by my Mouth; and bids thee know thyself, thou fallen Spirit; thy true State, and only Concern below. <HI>What meanest thou O Sleeper? Arise! Call upon thy</HI> GOD <HI>if so be thy</HI> GOD <HI>will think upon thee, that thou perish not.</HI> A migh∣ty Tempest is stirred up round about thee, and thou art sinking into the Depths of Perdition, the Gulph of GOD'S Judgments. If thou would escape them, cast thyself into them. <HI>Judge thy∣self, and thou shalt not be judged of the</HI> LORD.</P>
<P N="2">2. Awake, awake! Stand up this Moment, lest thou <HI>drink at the</HI> LORD<HI>'s Hand the Cup of his Fury.</HI> Stir up thyself <HI>to lay hold on the</HI> LORD, <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>thy Righteousness, mighty to save! Shake thyself from the Dust.</HI> At least, let the Earthquake of GOD'S Threatnings shake thee. Awake and cry out with the trembling Goaler, <HI>What must I do to be saved?</HI> And never rest, 'till thou believest on the LORD JESUS, with a Faith which is his Gift, by the Operation of his Spirit.</P>
<P N="3">3. If I speak to any one of you more than to another, it is to thee, who thinkest thyself unconcerned in this Exhortation. <HI>I have a Message from</HI> GOD <HI>unto thee.</HI> In his Name I <HI>warn</HI> thee <HI>to flee form the Wrath to come.</HI> Thou unholy Soul, see thy Picture in condemned <HI>Peter,</HI> lying in the dark Dungeon, between the Sol∣diers, bound with two Chains, the Keepers before the Door keeping the Prison. The Night is far spent, the Morning is at Hand when thou art to be brought forth to Execution. And in these dreadful Circumstances thou art fast asleep in the Devil's Arms, on the Brink of the Pit, in the Jaws of everlasting De∣struction.</P>
<P N="4">4. O may <HI>the Angel of the</HI> LORD <HI>come upon thee, and the Light
<PB N="6" REF="042191_0006_101BA60087EFF798"/>
shine into thy Prison!</HI> And mayest thou feel the Stroke of an Al∣mighty Hand, raising thee with, <HI>Arise up, quickly gird thyself, and bind on thy Sandals, cast thy Garment about thee, and follow me!</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Awake thou everlasting Spirit, out of thy Dream of world∣ly Happiness. Did not GOD create thee for Himself? Then thou canst not rest, 'till thou restest on Him. Return thou Wan∣derer. Fly back to thy Ark. <HI>This is not thy home.</HI> Think not of building Tabernacles here. Thou art but <HI>a Stranger, a Sojourner upon Earth:</HI> A Creature of a Day, but, just launching out into an unchangeable State. Make Haste, Eternity is at Hand. Eternity depends on this Moment. An Eternity of Happiness, or an Eternity of Misery.</P>
<P N="6">6. In what State is thy Soul? Was GOD, while I am yet speak∣ing, to require it of thee, Art thou ready to meet Death and Judgment? Canst thou stand in his Sight, <HI>who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity?</HI> Art thou <HI>meet to be Partaker of the Inheri∣tance of the Saints in Light?</HI> Hast thou <HI>fought a good Fight, and kept the Faith?</HI> Hast thou secured <HI>the one Thing needful?</HI> Hast thou recovered the Image of GOD, even <HI>Righteousness and true Holiness?</HI> Hast thou <HI>put off the Old Man, and put on the New?</HI> Art thou <HI>cloathed upon with</HI> CHRIST?</P>
<P N="7">7. Hast thou Oil in thy Lamp? Grace in thy Heart? Dost thou <HI>love the</HI> LORD <HI>thy</HI> GOD, <HI>with all thy Heart, and with all thy Mind, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Strength?</HI> Is <HI>that Mind in thee, which was also in</HI> CHRIST JESUS? Art thou a Christian indeed? That is, a new Creature? <HI>Are old Things past away, and all Things become new?</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Art thou <HI>Partaker of the Divine Nature? Knowest thou not, that</HI> CHRIST <HI>is in thee, except thou be reprobate?</HI> Knowest thou, that GOD <HI>dwelleth in thee, and thou in</HI> GOD, <HI>by his Spirit which He hath given thee?</HI> Knowest thou not, that <HI>thy Body is a Temple of the Holy Ghost, which thou hast of</HI> GOD? Hast thou the <HI>Witness in thyself? The Earnest of thine Inheritance?</HI> Art thou <HI>sealed by that Spirit of Promise, unto the Day of Redemption?</HI> Hast thou <HI>received the Holy Ghost?</HI>—Or dost thou start at the Question, not knowing whether there be any Holy Ghost?</P>
<P N="9">9. If it offends thee, be thou assured, that thou neither art a Christian, nor desirest to be one. Nay, thy <HI>very Prayer is turned into Sin;</HI> and thou hast solemnly mocked GOD this very Day, by praying for the Inspiration of his holy Spirit, when thou didst not believe there was any such Thing to be received.</P>
<P N="10">10. Yet on the Authority of God's Word, and our own
<PB N="7" REF="042191_0007_101BA605EE6B6C40"/>
Church, I must repeat the Question, <HI>Hast thou received the Holy Ghost?</HI> If thou hast not, thou art not yet a Christian: For a Christian is a Man that is <HI>anointed with the Holy Ghost, and with Power.</HI> Thou art not yet made a Partaker of the pure Religion, and undefiled. Dost thou know what Religion is? That it is a Participation of Divine Nature: The Life of GOD in the Soul of Man: CHRIST <HI>in thee, the Hope of Glory:</HI> Happiness and Holiness: Heaven begun upon Earth: <HI>A Kingdom of</HI> GOD <HI>within thee; not Meat and Drink;</HI> no outward Thing; <HI>but Righ∣teousness, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost?</HI> An everlasting Kingdom brought into thy Soul, a <HI>Peace of</HI> GOD, <HI>that passeth all Understanding; a Joy unspeakable, and full of Glory?</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. Knowest thou, that in JESUS CHRIST, <HI>neither Circumcisi∣on availeth any Thing, or Uncircumcision; but Faith that worketh by Love;</HI> but a new Creation: Seest thou the Necessity of that in∣ward Change, that spiritual Birth, that Life from the Dead, that Holiness? And art thou throughly convinced, that <HI>without it, no Man shall see the</HI> LORD? Art thou labouring after it? <HI>Giving all Diligence to make thy Calling and Election sure? Working out thy Salvation with Fear and Trembling? Agonizing to enter in at the strait Gate?</HI> Art thou <HI>in earnest</HI> about thy Soul? And canst thou tell the Searcher of Hearts, <HI>Thou, O</HI> GOD <HI>art the Thing that I long for!</HI> LORD, Thou knowest all Things, Thou knowest that I <HI>would</HI> love thee!</P>
<P N="12">12. Thou hopest to be saved—but what Reason hast thou to give of the Hope that is in thee? Is it because thou hast done no Harm? Or because thou hast done much Good? Or because thou art not like other Men; but wise, or learned, or honest and morally good? Esteemed of Men, or of a fair Reputation? Alas, all this will never bring thee to GOD. It is in his Ac∣count lighter than Vanity. Dost thou <HI>know</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>whom he hath sent▪</HI> Hath he taught thee, that <HI>by Grace we are saved, thro' Faith; and that, not of ourselves; it is the Gift of</HI> GOD; <HI>Not of Works, lest any Man should boast?</HI> Hast thou re∣ceived the faithful Saying, as the whole Foundation of thy Hope, <HI>that</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>came into the World to save Sinners!</HI> Hast thou learnt what that meaneth, <HI>I came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners, to Repentance? I am not sent but to the lost Sheep? Art</HI> thou (he that heareth, let him understand) lost, dead? <HI>Damned already?</HI>—Dost thou know thy Deserts? Dost thou feel thy Wants? Art thou <HI>poor in Spirit? Mourning for</HI> GOD, and refusing to be comforted? Is the Prodigal <HI>come to himself,</HI> and well con∣tent to be therefore thought <HI>beside himself,</HI> by those who are still
<PB N="8" REF="042191_0008_101BA60B39650610"/>
feeding upon the Husks which he had left? Art thou willing to <HI>live godly in</HI> CHRIST JESUS? And dost thou therefore <HI>suffer Per∣secution?</HI> Do <HI>Men say all Manner of Evil against thee falsly, for the Son of Man's Sake?</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. O that in all these Questions ye may hear the Voice that wakes the Dead, and feel that Hammer of the Word, Which <HI>breaketh the Rock in Pieces!—If ye will hear his Voice To-day, while it is called To-day, harden not your Hearts.</HI> Now <HI>awake thou that sleepest</HI> in spiritual Death, that thou sleep not in Death eternal! Feel thy lost Estate, and <HI>arise from the Dead.</HI> Leave thine own Companions in Sin and Death. Follow thou JESUS, and <HI>let the Dead bury the Dead. Save thyself from this untoward Generation. Come out from among them, and be thou separate, and touch not the un∣clean Thing, and the</HI> LORD <HI>shall receive thee.</HI> CHRIST <HI>shall give thee Light.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. 1. This Promise I come, lastly, to explain. And how encouraging a Consideration is this, That whosoever thou art who obeyest his Call, thou canst not seek his Face in vain. If thou even now <HI>awakest, and arisest from the Dead.</HI> He hath bound himself to <HI>give thee Light. The</HI> LORD <HI>shall give</HI> thee <HI>Grace and Glory;</HI> the Light of his Grace here, and the Light of his Glo∣ry, when thou receivest the <HI>Crown that fadeth not away.</HI> Thy Light <HI>shall break forth as the Morning, and thy Darkness be as the Noon-Day.</HI> GOD, <HI>who commandeth the Light to shine out of Dark∣ness,</HI> shall <HI>shine in thy Heart, to give the Knowledge of the Glory of</HI> GOD <HI>in the Face of</HI> JESUS CHRIST. <HI>On them that fear the</HI> LORD, <HI>shall the Sun of Righteousness arise, with healing in his Wings.</HI> And <HI>in that Day it shall be said unto thee, Arise, shine; for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the</HI> LORD <HI>is arisen upon thee.</HI> For CHRIST <HI>shall</HI> reveal himself in thee. And he is the <HI>true Light.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. GOD is the Light, and will give himself to every awak∣ened Sinner that waiteth for Him: And thou shalt then be a Temple of the living GOD, and CHRIST shall <HI>dwell in the Heart of Faith:</HI> And <HI>being rooted and grounded in Love, thou shalt be a∣ble to comprehend with all Saints, what is the Breadth, and Length and Heighth of that Love of</HI> CHRIST <HI>which passeth Knowledge, that thou mayst be filled with all the Fullness of</HI> GOD.</P>
<P N="3">3. Ye see your Calling, Brethren. We are called to be <HI>an Habitation of</HI> GOD <HI>through his Spirit: And thro' his Spirit dwel∣ling in us, to be Saints</HI> here, <HI>and Partakers of the Saints in Light.</HI> So <HI>exceeding great</HI> are the <HI>Promises which are given unto us,</HI> ac∣tually given unto us who believe. For by Faith <HI>we receieve not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of</HI> GOD, the Sum
<PB N="9" REF="042191_0009_101BA60CD390B678"/>
of all the Promises, <HI>that we may know the Things that are freely given to us of</HI> GOD.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Spirit of CHRIST is that great Gift of GOD, which at sundry Times, and in divers Manners He hath promised to Man, and hath fully bestowed since the Time that CHRIST was glorified. Those Promises before made by the Father, he hath thus fulfilled; <HI>I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my Statutes</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxvi. 27.</NOTE>. <HI>I will pour Water upon him that is thir∣sty, and Floods upon the dry Ground: I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Blessings upon thine Offspring</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isaiah</HI> xliv. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">5. Ye may be all living Witnesses of these Things: Of Remission of Sins, and the Gift of the Holy Ghost. <HI>If thou canst believe, all Things are possible to him that believeth. Who a∣mong you is there that feareth the</HI> LORD, and yet <HI>walketh in Dark∣ness, and hath no Light?</HI> I ask thee in the Name of JESUS, Be∣lievest thou that <HI>his Arm is not shortened at all?</HI> That He is still <HI>mighty to save?</HI> That He is <HI>the same Yesterday, To-day, and for ever?</HI> That He hath <HI>now</HI> Power <HI>on Earth</HI> to forgive Sins? <HI>Son, be of good Chear, thy Sins are forgiven.</HI> GOD for CHRIST'S Sake hath forgiven thee. Receive this, <HI>not as the Word of Man; but as it is, indeed, the Word of</HI> GOD; and thou art <HI>justified freely thro' Faith.</HI> Thou shalt be sanctified also thro' Faith which is in JESUS, and shall set to thy Seal, even thine, that GOD <HI>hath</HI> giv∣en unto us <HI>eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Men and Brethren, let me freely speak unto you: And <HI>suffer ye the Word of Exhortation,</HI> even from one the least esteemed in the Church. Your Conscience beareth you Witness in the Holy Ghost, that these Things are so, <HI>if so be ye have tasted that the</HI> LORD <HI>is gracious. This is eternal Life, to know the only true</HI> GOD, <HI>and</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>whom He hath sent.</HI> This is ex∣perimental Knowledge, and this alone is true Christianity. He is a Christian, who hath received the Spirit of CHRIST. He is not a Christian, who hath not received Him. Neither is it possible to have received Him, and not know it. For <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> xiv. 20.</NOTE> <HI>at that Day</HI> (when He cometh, saith the LORD) <HI>ye shall know, that I am in my Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</HI> This is <HI>that Spi∣rit of Truth, whom the World cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him: But ye know Him: for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. The World cannot receive Him, but utterly rejecteth the Promise of the Father, contradicting and blaspheming. But e∣very Spirit which confesseth not this, is not of GOD. Yea,
<PB N="10" REF="042191_0010_101BA60E70940900"/>
<HI>this is that Spirit of Antichrist, whereof ye have heard, that it should come into the World, and even now it is in the World.</HI> He is Antichrist, whosoever denies the Inspiration of the Holy Ghost, or that the indwelling Spirit of GOD is the common Privilege of all Believers, the Blessings of the Gospel, the unspeakable Gift, the universal Promise, the Criterion of a real Christian.</P>
<P N="8">8. It nothing helps them to say, <Q>We do not deny the As∣sistance of GOD'S Spirit; but only this <HI>Inspiration,</HI> this <HI>re∣ceiving the Holy Ghost,</HI> and being <HI>sensible</HI> of it. It is only this <HI>feeling of this</HI> Spirit, this being <HI>moved</HI> by the Spirit, or <HI>filled</HI> with it, which we deny to have any Place in sound Religion.</Q> But in <HI>only denying this,</HI> you deny the whole Scriptures, the whole Truth and Promise and Testimony of GOD.</P>
<P N="9">9. Our own excellent Church knows nothing of this devilish Distinction: But speaks plainly of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Art.</HI> 17.</NOTE> <HI>feeling the Spirit of</HI> CHRIST; of being <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Office of consecrating Priests.</NOTE> <HI>moved by the Holy Ghost,</HI> and knowing and <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Visitation of the Sick.</NOTE> <HI>feeling there is no other Name than that of</HI> JESUS, whereby we can re∣ceive any Salvation. She teaches us also to pray for the <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Collect before the Holy Communion.</NOTE> <HI>Inspi∣ration of the Holy Spirit;</HI> yea that we may be <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Order of Confirmation.</NOTE> <HI>filled with the Holy Ghost.</HI> Nay, and every Presbyter of her's, professes to <HI>receive the Holy Ghost, by the Imposition of Hands.</HI> Therefore to deny any of these, is, in Effect, to renounce the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as well as the whole Christian Revelation.</P>
<P N="10">10. But the <HI>Wisdom of</HI> GOD was always <HI>Foolishness with Men.</HI> No marvel then, that the great Mystery of the Gospel should be now also <HI>hid from the Wise and Prudent,</HI> as well as in the Days of Old; that it should be almost universally denied, ridiculed and exploded as mere Frenzy: And all who dare avow it still, branded with the Names of Madmen and Enthusiasts. This is <HI>that falling away</HI> which was to come: The general Apostacy, of all Orders and Degrees of Men, which we even now find to have overspread the Earth. <HI>Run to and fro in the streets of</HI> Je∣rusalem, <HI>and see if you can find a Man;</HI> a Man that loveth the LORD his GOD with all his Heart, and serveth him with all his Strength; How does our own Land mourn (that we look no far∣ther) under the Overflowings of Ungodliness? What Villanies of every Kind are committed Day by Day? Yea, too often with Impunity, by those who sin with a high Hand, and glory in their Same? Who can reckon up the Oaths, Curses, Profane∣ness, Blasphemies, the Lying, Slandering, Evil-speaking, the Sabbath-breaking, Gluttony, Drunkenness, Revenge, the

Whoredoms, Adulteries, and various Uncleanness, the Frauds, Injustice, Oppression, Extortion which overspread our Land as a Flood?</P>
<P N="11">11. And even among those who have kept themselves pure from those grosser Abominations, how much Anger and Pride, how much Sloth and Idleness, how much Softness and Effemi∣nacy, how much Luxury and Self-indulgence, how much Covet∣ousness and Ambition, how much Thirst of Praise, how much Love of the World, how much Fear of Man is to be found? Mean while, how little of true Religion? For where is he that loveth either GOD or his Neighbour; as He hath given us Com∣mandment? On the one Hand are those, who have not so much as the Form of Godliness: On the other, those who have the Form only: There stands the <HI>open,</HI> there the <HI>painted</HI> Sepulchre. So that in very Deed, whosoever were earnestly to behold any publick gathering togethether of the People, (I fear those in our Churches, are not to be excepted) might easily perceive, <HI>that the one Part were Sadduces, and the other Pharisees:</HI> The one having almost as little Concern about Religion, as if there were no <HI>Resurrection, neither Angel, nor Spirit:</HI> and the other making it a mere lifeless Form, a dull round of external Per∣formances, without either true Faith, or the Love of GOD, or Joy in the Holy Ghost.</P>
<P N="12">12. Would to GOD I could except us of this Place, Bre∣thren, my Heart's Desire, and Prayer to GOD for you is, that ye may be saved from this Overflowing of Ungodliness, and that here may its proud Waves be stay'd! But is it so indeed? GOD knoweth, yea, and our own Conscience, it is not. We have not kept ourselves pure. Corrupt are we also, and abomina∣ble; and few are there that understand any more, few that worship GOD in Spirit and in Truth. We too are <HI>a Generation that set not our Hearts aright, and whose Spirit cleaveth not stedfastly unto</HI> GOD. He hath appointed us indeed, to be <HI>the Salt of the Earth: But if the Salt hath lost its Savour, it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under Foot of Men.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. And <HI>shall I not visit for these Things, saith the</HI> LORD? <HI>Shall not my Soul be avenged on such a Nation as this?</HI> Yea we know not how soon He may say to the Sword, <HI>Sword, go through this Land!</HI> He hath given us a long Space to repent. He lets alone this Year also: But He warns and awakens us by Thunder. His Judgments are abroad in the Earth. And we have all Reason to expect that heaviest of all, even <HI>that He should come unto us quickly, and remove our Candlestick out of its Place, ex∣cept

we repent and do the first Works:</HI> Unless we return to the Principles of the Reformation, the Truth and Simplicity of the Gospel. Perhaps we are now resisting the last Effort of divine Grace to save us. Perhaps we have well nigh <HI>filled the Mea∣sures of our Iniquities,</HI> by rejecting the Council of GOD against ourselves, and casting out his Messengers.</P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>O God, in the midst of Wrath remember Mercy!</HI> Be glorified in our Reformation, not in our Destruction! Let <HI>us hear the Rod, and him that appointed it.</HI> Now that <HI>thy Judgments are a∣broad in the Earth,</HI> let the <HI>Inhabitants of the World learn Righteous∣ness.</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. My Brethren, it is high Time for us to awake out of Sleep, before the <HI>great Trumpet of the</HI> LORD <HI>be blown,</HI> and our Land become a Field of Blood. O may we speedily see the Things that make for our Peace before they are hid from our Eyes! <HI>Turn Thou us, O good</HI> LORD, <HI>and let thine Anger cease from us. O</HI> LORD <HI>look down from Heaven, behold and visit this Vine;</HI> and cause us to know the Time of our Visitation. <HI>Help us, O</HI> GOD <HI>of our Salvation, for the Glory of thy Name: O deliver us, and be merciful to our Sins, for thy Name's Sake: And so will we not go back from Thee. O let us live and we shall call upon thy Name. Turn us again, O</HI> LORD GOD <HI>of Hosts, shew the Light of thy Countenance, and we shall be whole.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now unto Him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think, according to the Power that worketh in us, unto Him be Glory in the Church by</HI> CHRIST JESUS <HI>throughout all Ages, World without End,</HI> Amen.</P>
