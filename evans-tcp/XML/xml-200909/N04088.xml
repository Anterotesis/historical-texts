<HEAD><HI>An ACCOUNT</HI> Of the Constitution and Government of <HI>Harvard-College,</HI> from its first Forma∣tion in the Year <HI>1636</HI> to the Year <HI>1742.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE subsequent Collection of Laws, which founded the Government of <HI>Harvard-College,</HI> was made on a late extraordinary Case, wherein the Overseers of said College assumed to themselves a SOVEREIGN Power over that College, and the SOLE Right to judge and censure and <HI>dismiss</HI> the PRESIDENT or ANY Member of the Corpo∣ration of said College, without the <HI>Consent</HI> or any <HI>Act</HI> of that Corporation for the same. This <HI>occasion'd</HI> the following Examination into the Constitution and Government of <HI>Har∣vard-College,</HI> beginning at the first Formation of that Col∣lege in the Year 1636 and ending with the present Year of our Lord 1742, wherein all the Laws that constitute the Go∣vernment of said <HI>College</HI> are laid together and compared; and then from these Laws an Argument is formed to prove "What Powers belong to the <HI>Corporation</HI> and to the Overseers of said <HI>College;</HI> and what Powers over that College <HI>still</HI> remain in the GENERAL COURT. And from the whole 'tis finally concluded "Who are the VISITORS of said <HI>College</HI> and have the Right at ALL <HI>Times</HI> to look into the State of the COLLEGE-STOCK and see that it is not <HI>embezzled</HI> or any Part of it <HI>alienated</HI> from its proper Uses.</P>

<HEAD>II. The Act of the General Court in 1642, which consti∣tuted and appointed OVERSEERS to said Harvard-College, <HI>before</HI> that College was made a CORPORATION.</HEAD>
<Q><P>WHEREAS through the good Hand of God upon us, there is a College founded in <HI>Cambridge</HI> in the County of <HI>Middlesex</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Called Harvard-College, <HI>viz.</HI> by the General Court. For the Court <HI>by Law</HI> gave it that Name, <HI>or∣dering</HI> that it should be <HI>called</HI> Harvard-College; as appears from the Court Records <HI>Anno</HI> 1638, 9. Dr. <HI>Aylisse</HI> in his Account of the University of <HI>Oxford</HI> (Vol. 2. P. 3.) when he comes to define a College, has these Words, <Q>A College is a Legal Body or Corporation. The Persons who are incor∣porated hereinto are a Body formed to last and endure in perpetual Succession of Time, and thus every College must have its legal <HI>Commencement</HI> or <HI>Beginning.</HI></Q> Now according to this Definition, or Account of such a Society, Harvard-College was a College <HI>improperly</HI> so called, 'till the Act or Charter of 1650 which made it a <HI>Legal Body or Corporation,</HI> and which <HI>incorporated</HI> the President and Fellows as a Body to <HI>last and endure in perpetual Succession of Time.</HI> So that from the Date of that Charter the said College MUST <HI>have its Legal Commencement or Beginning.</HI> And accordingly the General Court declare, on <HI>common Law,</HI> in the <HI>last</HI> and most <HI>exact</HI> Regulation they made of said College in <HI>Dec.</HI> 1707, <Q>That the FIRST Foundation and Establishment of that College and of the <HI>Government</HI> thereof had its ORIGINAL from an Act of the Court made in the Year 1650 which had not been repealed or nulled.</Q> So that the above cited Act of 42 is beyond the FIRST <HI>Foundation</HI> of the present College and of the GOVERNMENT <HI>thereof;</HI> and therefore the present incorporated College, or Harvard College as a College <HI>properly</HI> so called, seems to have nothing to do with this Act of 42 or with any POWERS contained in it, but only with the incorporating Act of 1650 as its FIRST Foundation. This Act now follows.</NOTE>, called HARVARD COLLEGE; For the Encouragement whereof this Court hath given the Sum of 400 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> and also the Revenue of the FERRY betwixt <HI>Charlestown</HI> and <HI>Boston,</HI> and that the well-ordering and managing of the said College is of great Concernment.</P>
<P>It is therefore <HI>ordered</HI> by this Court and the Authority thereof, that <HI>the Governour</HI> and <HI>Deputy Cover∣nour,</HI> for the Time being, and all the <HI>Magistrates of this Jurisdiction,</HI> together with the <HI>teaching Elders</HI> of the six next adjoining Towns, viz. <HI>Cambridge, Watertown, Charlestown, Boston, Roxbury and Dor∣chester,</HI> And the <HI>President</HI> of the said College, for the Time being, SHALL from Time to Time <HI>Have Full Power and Authority</HI> to make and establish all such <HI>Orders, Statutes and Constitutions</HI> as they shall see necessary for the instituting guiding and furthering of the said College, and the several Members thereof, from Time to Time, in Picty Morality and Learning: And also to <HI>Dispose, Order and Manage</HI> to the Use and Behoof of the said College, and Members thereof, all <HI>Gists, Legacies, Bequeaths, Revenues, Lands and Donations,</HI> as either have been, are, or shall be conferred, bestowed, or any Way shall fall, or come to the said College.</P>
<P>And whereas is may come to pass that <HI>Many of the said Megistrates and said Elders may be Absent,</HI> or <HI>otherwise Employed</HI> about other weighty Affairs, <HI>when</HI> the said College may need their present Help and Counsel, it is therefore ordered that the <HI>greater Number</HI> of Magistrates and Elders which shall be present with the President shall have <HI>the Power of the</HI> Whole; PROVIDED that if any <HI>Constitution Order</HI> or <HI>Or∣ders</HI> by them made shall be found <HI>burtful</HI> unto the said <HI>College</HI> or the <HI>Members</HI> thereof of to the <HI>Weal∣publick;</HI> Then upon APPEAL of the <HI>Party</HI> or <HI>Parties</HI> grieved unto the Company of Overseers <HI>first menti∣oned, they shall repeal</HI> the said Order or Orders (if they see Cause) at their next Meeting, or <HI>Stand Ac∣countable thereof to the Next</HI> GENERAL COURT.</P></Q>

<HEAD>IV. The Appendix to the College Charter of 1650. At a General Court held at <HI>Boston,</HI> Oct. 1657</HEAD>
<Q><P>In Answer to certain <HI>Proposals</HI> presented to this Court by the OVERSEERS of Harvard-College; As an Appendix to the College-Charter, it is Ordered:</P>
<P>The Corporation shall have Power from Time to Time to make such Orders and By-Laws for the better ordering and carrying on of the Work of the College as they shall see Cause without <HI>De∣pendance</HI> on the Consent of the Overseers foregoing; <HI>Provided</HI> always that the Corporation shall be <HI>responsible</HI> unto and those Orders and By-Laws shall be <HI>alterable</HI> by the Overseers according to their Discretion.</P>
<P>And when the Corporation shall hold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Meeting for agreeing with College Servants, for making of Orders and By-Laws, for debating and concluding of Affairs concerning the Profits and Reve∣nues of any Lands or Gifts and the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>posing thereof (Provided that all the said Disposals be according to the Wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Donors) for managing all emergent Occasions, for the procuring of a GEN<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>AL Meeting of the OVERSEERS and SOCIETY in <HI>great</HI> and <HI>difficut</HI> Cases and in Cases of <HI>New-Agr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ment,</HI> and for all other College Affairs to them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> all thse Cases the Conclusion shall be valid being made by the <HI>major Part</HI> of the Corporation, the President having casting Vote; Provided always that in these Things also they be <HI>responsible</HI> to the Overseers aforesaid.</P>
<P>And in Case the Corporation shall see cause to call a Meeting of the Overseers, or the Over∣seers shall see good to meet of themselves; it shall be <HI>sufficient</HI> unto the <HI>Validity</HI> of College Acts that Notice be given to the Overseers in the six Towns mentioned in the printed Law Anno 1642, when the rest of the Overseers by Reason of the Remoteness of their Habitations cannot conveniently be ac∣quainted therewith.</P></Q>
<P>This APPENDIX, or the greater Part of it, seems to be NULLED by a succeeding Law of the Colony (called the College Charter of 1672) which ends with this Sanction of the Court. <Q><HI>All and every of which Premises we do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in and enact to be</HI> FULLY <HI>established for</HI> LAW; <HI>any L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> GRANT, <HI>or Us<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge to the</HI> CONTRARY, <HI>in any wise notwithstanding.</HI></Q> Now the greater Part of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d Appendix is <HI>contrary</HI> to this posteriour Law of 72. And indeed this latter Law is the most <HI>proper</HI> Appendix to the Charter of 50; for in express Terms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us grounded on said Charter as on its Foun∣dation; not does it alter any Thing in that Charter but in some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew Cases. So there is no Oc∣casion to infort it here, <HI>Reference being had there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the Court Records.</HI> The greatest Alteration it makes in said Charter of 50 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that in some Things it gives <HI>more</HI> Power to the Corporation of said College, and <HI>less</HI> to the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, than the Charter of 50 does.

PRACTICES upon the Preceeding Laws of 42 and 50, which originally constituted the Overseers and Corporation of <HI>Harvard-College.</HI></P>
<P>The four preceeding Laws of 42, 50, 57, 72, were all the standing Laws, on which the Govern∣ment of said College was founded, in old Charter Times. And since Practices upon ancient Laws, nearest the Times wherein such Laws were made, do best explain and interpret them; here are sub∣joined some Acts of the Court, in those early Times, which show what Sense the Court put upon these two Laws which originally constituted the Overseers and Corporation of said College; and what Powers the Court, without Reserve to themselves, had been <HI>pleased</HI> to grant in these Laws to the Overseers and Corporation of said College. Thus;</P>
<P><HI>Ann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 1654. After the Court had constituted the Overseers and Corporation of said College; it appears from the Province Records, (Vol. 3. P. 245) That the Court <Q>on Perusal of the RETURN of the <HI>Committee</HI> appointed to consider of the College-Business, ORDER that all the STOCK ap∣pertaining to the College should be committed to the <HI>Care</HI> and TRUST of the <HI>Overseers</HI> of said College.</Q> Now by the Act of 42 the Overseers had the <HI>College-Stock</HI> given to them; but after∣wards the Charter of 50 takes it out of their Hands and puts it into the Hands of the Corpora∣tion; and now in 54 the Court in an extraordinary Case INTERPOSE and <HI>susp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd</HI> the Powers of the Charter, and, for a Time, put that Stock back again into the Hands of the Overseers. At first View this may seem an <HI>extraordinary</HI> Act in the Court, who by a solemn <HI>Grant</HI> of the Charter of 50 had vested the <HI>Property</HI> of that Stock in the said Corporation. But there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ally <HI>nothing extr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rdinary</HI> in this Act. For as VISITORS, of <HI>their</HI> OWN <HI>College,</HI> the Court had a Right at ALL <HI>Times</HI> to see that <HI>this</HI> STOCK <HI>was well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hen Care of!</HI> And therefore this Year when the said Corporation were so few in Number, and President <HI>Dunster</HI> being now about to quit his Place, and so the said College be lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> a HEAD: In the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> weak State of that Society, the Court <HI>seem</HI> for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of that Stock <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>commit</HI> it, for a Time, to the <HI>Care</HI> and TRUST of the Overseers. This was on Act that, in <HI>Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> the VISI∣TORS of a College had a Right to do.</P>
<P><HI>Ann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 1654. The Court ordered (Prov. Rec. Vol. 3. p. 274) that <Q>Mr. <HI>Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> and Mr. <HI>Cobbet</HI> Pastors or Teachers of the Churches of <HI>Dedham</HI> and <HI>Lyn</HI> and Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> an <HI>unsettled</HI> Teacher <HI>in</HI> Boston, <HI>should</HI> BE <HI>Overseers;</HI> and JOIN with the rest of the Overseers, in the Work of the College.</Q> And thus, notwithstanding the Acts of 42 and 50, the Court in the Year 54 made NEW Over∣seers; and by the same Power the Court could have unmade the <HI>Former</HI> Overseers. So dependent were the Overseers of the said College in those Times upon the Court. Such a state of Depen∣dency, for the <HI>Continuance</HI> of their Being on the Court, does not <HI>seem</HI> to imply that the Overseers of said College were, in and by their Constitution, the VISITORS of said College; For Visitors, <HI>as such,</HI> have not a dependent precarious Existence.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1654. Mr. <HI>Henry Dunster,</HI> the President appointed and <HI>named</HI> in the College Charter of 50, resigned his Place; while that Charter and all the Powers granted in it (as well as the Powers granted in the Act of 42 to the Overseers) were so well understood by ALL <HI>Parties concerned!</HI> For the Court had granted that Charter but <HI>four</HI> Years before. Now from the publick Histories of this Country, and from the large Account of the Matter in the College Records, it appears that Mr. <HI>Dunster</HI> (like Mr. <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt</HI> at <HI>Mar <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>) was <HI>forced</HI> either to <HI>resign</HI> his Place or to <HI>recant</HI> some of his religious Tenets, and he chose the former. So this forced Resignation was in effect the same Thing with a <HI>Dismission</HI> of him from his Place. And now let it be observed, "To WHOM <HI>He resigns;</HI> and how far the <HI>Overseers</HI> or <HI>Corporation</HI> of said College were concerned in the Business of his Resignation, which here follows.</P>

<P><HI>Richard Bellingham,</HI> Governour.</P>
<P>Court Records Book 3. p. 262. And Overseers Book, No. 2. p. 1.</P>
<P>And thus so <HI>near</HI> the Time when the College Charter of 50 was granted it app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s that the very President named and appointed in that Charter, made not his Resignation to the Overseers and Cor∣poration (though he out it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the Overseers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to them) but to the General Court; And hereon the Court ORDERED that this Affair should be LEFT with the Overseers (just as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Court might have ordered that it should be <HI>Left</HI> with <HI>any other</HI> Persons) so that 'tis evident the Overseers acted not in this Affair by any <HI>inherent</HI> Powers of their own, but by an <HI>ex∣trinsick</HI> and <HI>delegated</HI> Power from the Court, and as a <HI>temporary Committee</HI> of the Court <HI>until the next Sessions, when the Court should be better enabled to</HI> SETTLE <HI>in</HI> ALL <HI>Respects what was needful for the College;</HI> and the Overseers were <HI>to make</HI> RETURN of what they should do in this Affair, to the Court who had <HI>Employed them in it.</HI></P>
<P>And after the Court had thus <HI>empowered</HI> the Overseers to treat with Mr. <HI>Dunster</HI> they then enter into long and various Conferences with him and address him thus, <Q>Mr. <HI>President;</HI> The <HI>General Court</HI> seem <HI>to require</HI> of you that you <HI>Inform</HI> the Overseers whether you persist in your Resignation, and [the Court] EXPECT <HI>from us</HI> a Provision for the College in Case of your Persistance, and <HI>a Return</HI> to <HI>the Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> of What we have done in this Business.</Q></P>
<P>And again; <Q>Whereas in <HI>Observance</HI> of <HI>an</HI> ORDER <HI>of Court</HI> made, June 10. 1654, The Overseers have had sundry Meetings with Mr. <HI>Dunster</HI> to know whether he persist in his Resignation <HI>lately exhibited</HI> to the <HI>General Court.</HI> And as they would not be wanting to Mr. <HI>Dunster</HI> whose LAPSE [viz into the Tenets of the Anabaptiste] is the Matter of their <HI>Gri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> so that they may not be wanting to the <HI>Truth,</HI> the <HI>College,</HI> the Country, nor the <HI>Tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> committed to them by the General Court viz in <HI>this</HI> Affair wherein they acted as a <HI>Committee</HI> of the Court;] they therefore declare that is the Lord do not incline <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Heart before the middle of September next to give <HI>Satisfaction</HI> according to the Rules of Christ; the 4 n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> be <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> in Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e there be <HI>no other</HI> Remedy [viz from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>it</HI> which is <HI>all</HI> the Remedy
<PB N="12" REF="005041_0011_10168D6D404E75F0"/>that can be <HI>here</HI> supposed] to take Care for <HI>furnishing</HI> the College with <HI>another</HI> President.</Q>—Then after two or three more <HI>Pro's</HI> and <HI>Con's</HI> (no Way relating to the Occasion of these Extracts) he on <HI>Oct.</HI> 24.1654, makes his <HI>final</HI> Resignation to the Overseers of said College who were <HI>now</HI> sent and <HI>empowered</HI> by the Court as their <HI>Committee</HI> to receive it. And the Overseers in <HI>November</HI> following provided another President, and in the mean Time <HI>commit</HI> the Care and Government of the said College to the Fellows thereof.—And thus the Overseers of said College acted through the whole of this Affair; not by any Power of their own, but by a delegated Power from the Court; for this Power <HI>expired</HI> as soon as, according to Order, they had made <HI>Return</HI> to the COURT who had <HI>employed</HI> them in this Affair.</P>
<P>Let it be noted that this Resignation of Mr. <HI>Dunster,</HI> implied in it a <HI>proper</HI> Dismission of him; for a <HI>voluntary</HI> Resignation is of a quite different Nature. Thus a Member of said Corporation residing at Harvard College when he designs to settle abroad in the World may <HI>resign</HI> to the President of said College, <HI>i. e.</HI> may <HI>inform</HI> the President that he is determined to leave the College and quit his Post in it, (which none can hinder him from doing.) But this is far from implying that the said President can <HI>force</HI> such a Member to resign. But <HI>that</HI> Power that can rightfully <HI>force</HI> him to resign, is most certainly A POWER which can rightfully <HI>dismiss</HI> him. Now this was President <HI>Dunster</HI>'s Case. For the Overseers of said College, when they acted as <HI>De∣legates</HI> from the COURT, tell him expressly tht <Q>unless he would give <HI>Satisfaction</HI> according to the Rules of Christ they must be Constrained to furnish the College with <HI>another</HI> President.</Q> So this Power included in it a Power from the COURT to <HI>dismiss</HI> him.</P>
<P>N. B. The <HI>next</HI> and the <HI>only other</HI> Instance of a Dismission of a Member of said Corporation was on Feb. <HI>last</HI> 1741, 2; without <HI>any</HI> Power from the COURT or <HI>any Act</HI> of said Corporation for the same, but by the Sole and SOVEREIGN Authority of the Overseers of said College; who having no plain Law for it not from Times immemorial any Instance of such a Thing on their Side, <HI>seemed</HI> now resolved to <HI>make</HI> one, that so they might <HI>plead</HI> it in future Times. Precedents <HI>against</HI> Law are DANGEROUS Things; especiallly if they rise so high as to turn out Members of CORPORATIONs." Such a Thing done in England <HI>would cause an</HI> INSURRECTION <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> And if this Power does not belong to the Corporation and Overseers of said College <HI>by</HI> LAW, The Overseers of said College by such an Act have assumed to themselves the Powers of the GE∣NERAL COURT viz.

<HEAD>V. The State of <HI>Harvard-College</HI> since the now Province Charter was granted.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the vacating the old Colony Charter of the Massachusets in 1684, there were some new Laws or College-Charters made by the general Court of this Province. But these Laws (as all others made under our present Province-Charter) were of Course to be sent Home for the Royal Approbation; And they all were sent Home accordingly, and have been disapproved. So that no Laws whatever remain, but the four preceeding Laws fo 42, 50, 57 and 72, as the Foundation on which the Government of the said C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>e now stands. And <HI>all</HI> or <HI>some</HI> of these Laws are valid to this Day on the following Grounds 1. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ese Law, were made in old Charter Times, when it was not <HI>requisite</HI> to send them Home for Appro∣bation; and so they never were disapproved at Home. 2. As they never were disapproved at Home, so they never were repealed by the General Court who made them; Only so far as the succeeding do inter∣fere with, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>de or repeal the Preceeding, or any Clauses in the Preceeding, and in such a Case the suc∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ding take Place; and particularly the Charter of 50, and the last of these Laws made in the Year 1572 which is properly an APPENDIX to the said Charter of 50. And 3. What of those Laws re∣ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned valid, in old Charter Times, was virtually and implicitely confirm'd by a Clause in our present Pro∣vince-Charter and by a declarative Order of the General Court in 1707 respecting the College Charter of 50; BOTH <HI>of Which</HI> here follow as the <HI>last</HI> Regulation made of the Constitution and Government of said College.</P>

II. At a Great and General Court held at <HI>Boston</HI> Wednesday <HI>May</HI> 28. 1707. and continued by several Prorogations to Wednesday <HI>Oct.</HI> 29 following, being the third Sessions.</P>
<P>In Council; Thursday <HI>Dec.</HI> 4. 1707.</P>
<Q><P>THE GOVERNOUR and COUNCIL having <HI>Accepted</HI> and <HI>Approved</HI> the Choice made by the Fellows of <HI>Harvard College</HI> in <HI>Cambridge</HI> of Mr. <HI>John Leverett</HI> to be present President of the said College to fill up that Vacancy; <HI>Propose</HI> that the HOUSE of Representatives consider of and grant a suitable Sa∣lary to be paid to the said President annually out of the publick Treasury-for his Encouragement and Support during his Continuance in said Office, residing at <HI>Cambridge</HI> and discharging the proper Duties to a President belonging and entirely devote himself to that Service.</P>
<P><HI>And inasmuch at the</HI> FIRST <HI>Foundation and Establishment of that</HI> HOUSE <HI>and the</HI> GOVERNMENT <HI>there∣of had its</HI> ORIGINAL <HI>from an Act of the General Court made and passed in the Year</HI> 1650, <HI>which has not been</HI> REPEALED or NULLED; The President and Fellows of the said College are DIRECTED from Time to Time to regulate themselves according to the <HI>Rules of the</HI> CONSTITUTION by the Act <HI>Pre∣scribed;</HI> And to exercise the Powers and Authorities thereby granted for the Government of that House and Support thereof.</P>
<P>Saturday, Dec. 6. 1707. The Representatives returned the Vote passed in Council the 4th current referring to the College, with their Concurrence thereto; and this further Addition thereon, viz. That the Sum for Salary be <HI>One Hundred and Fifty Pounds.</HI></P></Q>
<P>To which the Council voted and Agreement, and the Governour consented</P>
<P>This was the LAST Act of the COURT relating to the Government of said College, and this Act refer∣red that College back again to its original Foundation on the College-Charter of 50. <HI>Which had not been</HI> REPEALED <HI>or</HI> NULLED; as the old Colony Law of 42 had <HI>been,</HI> by the Incorporating Act of 1650. So that the Overseers of said College have <HI>now</HI> no Power over that College by the Act of 42, but by the College Charter of 50 <HI>alone.</HI> Which gives the OVerseers of said College only a Power to act <HI>with</HI> the Corporation and not <HI>without</HI> them, as appears on Inspection from that Charter itself. And on this Foun∣dation the said College has continued, or OUGHT to have continued, to this present Year of our Lord, 1742.</P>
<P>And if any Persons in the Government of said College, should at any Time go off from this Foundation, and set up a Power INDEPENDENT on said Charter, and SOVEREIGN over the said Corporation; the Ge∣neral Court alone can remand them <HI>2 Second</HI> Time back to that Charter again, as the FIRST <HI>Foundation</HI> of that House <HI>and of the</HI> Government <HI>thereof;</HI> and DIRECT them to <HI>regulate themselves from Time to Time ac∣cording to the</HI> CONSTITUTION <HI>by that Act</HI> prescribed.</P>

<HEAD>REASONS to prove that the Honourable and Reverend <HI>Overseers</HI> of <HI>Harvard-College</HI> have no Independent Pow∣er over the Corporation of said College, nor can Dismiss a Member of said Corporation, solely by Themselves; But that the GENERAL COURT alone have such a <HI>Sove∣reign</HI> Power; And are the VISITORS of said College.</HEAD>
<P>IN Order to the Proof of This, Let it be Premised.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That from all the Preceeding Laws it appears that the said <HI>Harvard-College</HI> was originally the College of the General Court of the <HI>Massachusett;</HI> Colo∣ny; That the General Court of said Colony <HI>built</HI> it and <HI>named</HI> it and ordered <HI>where</HI> it should be built and <HI>what Kind</HI> of Building it should be; And that all the Powers which any Persons ever had from the beginning, or now have over the said College, were originally derived to them from the General Court of the Colony abovesaid; so that no Persons whatever can have any Power over the said College, but only so far as the General Court have been <HI>pleased</HI> to grant it to them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. It appears in particular that the Overseers and Corporation of said College owe their Being and all the standing Powers They now have, or ever had over the said College, To Four Laws of the General Court which were made in the Year 1642, 1650, 1657 and 1672. The <HI>First</HI> of which Laws originally constituted Overseers of said College; The <HI>Second</HI> incorporated the said College, and is called the Charter of 50; The <HI>Third</HI> is called an Appendix to said Charter; And the <HI>Fourth</HI> confirmed, added to or altered, some or <HI>all</HI> of these preceeding Laws. So that no Powers can now belong to the Overseers and Corporation of said College but those Powers which the Court granted to them in some or all of these four Laws.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That in the two latter Laws of 57 and 72, the Court gave to the Overseers of said College no <HI>New</HI> Powers of any Importance over the said Corporation; And so there is no Occasion to consider any of these four Laws, but the two <HI>First,</HI> in order to determine whether the Overseers of said College have an <HI>Independent</HI> and Sovereign Power over the said Corporation.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Now from these two Laws, which constituted the Overseers and Corporation of said College, it manifestly appears that the Court did not vest the Overseers of said College with such a sovereign Power over the said Corporation; But that the Court, who originally had this Power, reserved it to themselves; And are VISITORS of said College. For</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="16" REF="005041_0015_10168D7821C45150"/>
1. The <HI>prior</HI> Law of 1642, which constitute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of said College, gave them no Power over that College considered as a <HI>Body Politick or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI></P>
<P>This Law was made before the Corporation of said College <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ING; and therefore it gave the Overseers only a Power ever and <HI>unincorp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> College. It was the latter Law of 1650 which fist incorporated said College; for in this Law 'tis exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sly <Q>Ordered and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nacted by the Court, that <HI>From Henceforth</HI> the said COLLEGE in Cambridge shall be a <HI>Corporation.</HI></Q> So that by the Law of 1642 the Court gave the Overseers of said College no Power over that College consider'd <HI>as</HI> a a Corporation; And therefore when afterwards the Court m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Harvard-College a Corporation is 1650, so <HI>far</HI> as this latter Law, which in incorporated said College, <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ted</HI> the Members of this Corporation to the Overseers, <HI>so far</HI> and no father have the Overseers a Power over the said College or Corpo∣ration. And thus the latter Law supersedes or repeals the former Law of 1642. And this Sense the Great and General Court seem to have put upon the latter Law of 1050; For when in Decemb. 1707 the said Corporation were ordered to regulate themselves according to the original Constitution of the said <HI>College,</HI> the Court then declared that <Q>The first Foundation and Establishment of That House and the Government thereof had its Origin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from an Act of the General Court made and passed in the Year 1650 which had not been <HI>repealed</HI> or nulled.</Q> So that the FIRST Foun∣dation both of <HI>that House</HI> and the <HI>Government</HI> thereof had <HI>not</HI> its ORIGINAL from the <HI>prior</HI> Law of 1642 but from the latter Law of 1650. And hereon it follows that the Law of 1642 (which was <HI>before</HI> the FIRST Foundation of that House and the <HI>Government</HI> thereof) was sat <HI>aside</HI> and <HI>re∣moved</HI> out of the Way in order to <HI>Lay</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that House and in <HI>Government</HI> upon the incorporating Act of 1650. And therefore the said Law of 42 <HI>is n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Part of the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un∣dation</HI> of the present House of the College not of the <HI>Government</HI> thereof. So that by this Law of 42 the Overseers of said College (instead of having 2 sovereign Power over it) seem to have no Power at all over it, not over the Corporation thereof.</P>
<P>A plain Instance may illustrate this Law of 164<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: Suppose the General Court in 1642 had ap∣pointed Overseers to order and govern the Inhabitants of a Place, in the Colony, who had not as yet been incorporated into a <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n;</HI> and afterwards in 1650 the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rt should have have made the place a <HI>Town<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hip;</HI> — How <HI>far</HI> would these Inhabitants, now incorporated into a Town, be <HI>su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ject</HI> to their former Overseers by Virtue of the Law which constituted such Overseers before the Place was made a Town? Could these Overseers turn out the SELECT M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>N of that Town <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all <HI>future Times</HI> after the Place was made a Township? By N. Means! Unless the <HI>latter</HI> Law, which incorpo∣rated the Place into a Township, gave such a Power to the former Overseers of the Place. Nor would these Overseers have any Powers at all over such a Place, <HI>after</HI> it was made a Town, unless
<PB N="17" REF="005041_0016_10168D7AC43675F0"/>those Powers which were <HI>granted</HI> or <HI>confirmed</HI> to them in the <HI>latter</HI> Law which incorporated the Place into a Township.—And thus as to the Overseers and Corporation of the College abovesaid; The Law of 42 which appointed Overseers to said College <HI>before</HI> it was incorporated, gives them no Power over that College <HI>after</HI> it was made a Corporation; but all the Powers of the Over∣seers over said College <HI>after</HI> it was incorporated, are only those Powers which are <HI>granted</HI> or <HI>confirmed</HI> to them in the latter Law of 1650 which made the said College a Corporation.</P>
<P>Some truly worthy and valuable teaching Elders of the six neighbouring Towns are of Opinion, <Q>That the Law of 42 abovesaid is the great STANDING Law that contains all the more important and superior Powers over the said College; And that the Charter of 50 was made as a Thing by the BY, and only empower the President and Fellows to do some <HI>small</HI> Matters; and for the Sake of the College-Stock, it being necessary that they should be a Corporation in Law in order to acquire and hold a Stock.</Q> But in Answer hereto. 1. This Supposition is <HI>apparently</HI> contrary to the above mentioned Declaration of the General Court, which determines that the Act or Charter of 50 is the ORIGINAL of said College. So that the said Law of 42 is <HI>beyond</HI> the ORIGINAL of that College, and therefore <HI>seems</HI> to be out of Date. So far is it from being <HI>certain</HI> that this Law of 42 is "The <HI>great standing</HI> LAW—"the LAW that contains all the more <HI>important</HI> and <HI>superiour</HI> Powers over the said College. But 2. This Supposition abovesaid is contrary to the whole Strain and Tenou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the said Charter of 50 which no longer treates the President and Fellows <HI>as</HI> in a State of <HI>Minority</HI> under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> (though the most <HI>Honourable</HI> in the Land) but at now grown up <HI>to the full Statute of</HI> MEN. Thus particularly the said Charter enacts, <Q>That in all <HI>great</HI> and <HI>difficult</HI> Cases a general Meeting of ALL the Overseers and Society, or Corporation, shall be procured; and the <HI>Conclusion</HI> be made by the major Part (of the Corporation) the Overseers consenting thereto</Q>—Is this only a Power in said Corporation to do some <HI>small</HI> Matters? Or is this treating the President and Fellows as still in a State of Mi∣nority and <HI>Pupillage</HI> under Overseers, when a <HI>general</HI> Meeting of ALL the Overseers can make <HI>no</HI> Conclusion at all, and that in the most <HI>great</HI> and <HI>difficult</HI> Cases, but by <HI>consenting</HI> to a Conclusion made on such Cases by the Corporation? — Thus again 'tis enacted in said Charter, <Q>That the President and Fellows shall forever hereafter in Name and Fact be one Body Politick or Cor∣porate in Law to ALL Intents and Purposes</Q> and therefore <HI>not</HI> to ONE Intent and Purpose <HI>only.</HI> viz. The acquiring and holding a Stock, and the suing or being sued on the Account thereof. And thus evidently did the Court by this Charter, <HI>manumitt</HI> the said College from a State of <HI>meer</HI> Pupillage to Overseers, and locked on it as now grown up to Maturity and <HI>sitting</HI> to be incorporatd
<PB N="18" REF="005041_0017_10168D7EA891D958"/>with a President and Fellows and to have all the Rights and Privileges of a Corporation in Law; — as <HI>truly</HI> as in the Instance, above supposed, of a Place in the Colony put under Overseers, in its <HI>infant</HI> State; but afterwards incorporated when grown up and increased in full Numbers of Inhabitants. And as a Law that incorporates a Town can by a very just Figure of Speech be called the ORI∣GINAL of such a Town, so the incorporating Act of 1650 above-mentioned is, in its own Nature, the ORIGINAL of Harvard-College, as well as it has been declared by the Legislature to <HI>Be</HI> the ORIGINAL of said College. And therefore</P>
<P N="2">II. The latter Law of 1650, which incorporated Harvard College, and not the Prior Law of 1642, contains those Powers which the present Overseers have over the Corporation of the said College.</P>
<P>Now by this latter Law which incorporated Harvard College, the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">For the Truth of this FACT let the said Charter of 50, be consulted from Beginning to End! all the Powers of the Overseers which are either <HI>granted</HI> or <HI>mentioned,</HI> or even <HI>referred</HI> to, in that Charter are contained in the 3d, 6th and 8th small Paragraphs of said Charter, <HI>at</HI> it is printed in the preceeding Collection of Colony Laws relating to Harvard College. And so the <HI>Decision</HI> of the Fact here refer∣red to, and whether the Writer of this Pamphlet speaks <HI>Truth</HI> or <HI>Falsifies</HI> in such an Assertion, may be SHORT.</NOTE> ONLY Power given to the Overseers of said College is a Power to <HI>Counsel</HI> the Corporation of that College to act, or to <HI>consent</HI> to and <HI>allow</HI> of the Acts of the said Corporation. So that the Overseers of said College have no independent and SOVEREIGN Power over the Corporation of said College, even by that Law which is the only Law that now gives them any Power over that Corporation. To apply this in particular to the POWER of <HI>dismissing</HI> a Member of said Corporation. [Which let it be noted, is a Case on which this Law is absolutely <HI>silent</HI> and no where says "WHO have such a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the POWER given to the Overseers over the said Corporation, by that Law which appointed and made the said Corporation, is a Power to <HI>counsel</HI> that Corporation to act or to <HI>consent</HI> to their Acts; it follows that all the Power which the Overseers can have in <HI>dismissing</HI> a Member of that Corporation, is a Power to <HI>counsel</HI> the said Corporation to <HI>dismiss</HI> such a Member, or to <HI>consent</HI> to an Act of that Corporation for his <HI>Dismission;</HI> And therefore the Over∣seers of this College have no Power to dismiss a Member of that Corporation without an Act of the said Corporation for it; What <HI>can</HI> be more plain?—So that it may <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eely</HI> be said (and <HI>no</HI> Offence is <HI>justly</HI> offered in saying) that the Honourable and Reverend Overseers of said College, cannot, with∣out a Breach upon the College-Charter, assume the Power to dismiss a Member of that Corporati∣on,
<PB N="19" REF="005041_0018_10168D4E9CC8E198"/><HI>singly</HI> by themselves? So <HI>far</HI> is this Charter from giving to the Overseers of said College a SO∣VEREIGN Power to <HI>call</HI> a Member out of that Corporation before themselves <HI>alone;</HI> and <HI>try,</HI> and <HI>judge,</HI> and <HI>sentence,</HI> and <HI>turn him out</HI> of that Corporation; and all this Time the PASSIVE Corporation are to know nothing, unless by <HI>private</HI> Notice given them, <HI>"What has been doing to One of their Mem∣bers</HI> —or <HI>"What had finally become of him"</HI> 'till the Overseers of said College are pleased to give them Information. This is as foreign to the Design and Spirit of the Law, which incorporated Harvard Col∣lege, as it is to the plain and express Letter of it; and is such a Power as evidently <HI>seems</HI> to NULL the Charter or must it self be NULLED by it; And which of the Two are to <HI>Stand,</HI> to General Court alone, who founded that College and who appointed NO Visitors to it, can finally determine <HI>and Declare</HI> "Whether their OWN Act of 1650 which incorporated that College, or "Whether One unwarranted <HI>Precedent,</HI> which is subversive of that Act, is <HI>ultimately</HI> to remain VALID.</P>
<P>It may be added here <HI>Ex Abundanti</HI> that <HI>supposing</HI> some Powers granted to the Overseers of said College in the Law of 42, to act <HI>solely</HI> by themselves, were NOT superseded or vacated by the Charter of 50 which first incorporated said College; Yet all this <HI>notwithstanding,</HI> 'tis still TRUE that the Power of removing a Member of said Corporation if NOT One of those Powers that CAN be supposed to remain <HI>solely</HI> with the Overseers <HI>After</HI> the said Charter of 50 was granted. For since this Power of removing a Member of the Corporation is no where mentioned in the prior Law of 42 (and no Wonder, for the said Corporation and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> NO Being) it therefore follows that if such a Power is contained <HI>at all</HI> in that Law, It must <HI>be</HI> so, because it is <HI>implied</HI> under some of the GREAT and more important Powers granted to the Overseers in that Law. Now, This, <HI>This,</HI> brings the Matter to a Point! For the Charter of 50 i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> EXPRESS that the Overseers are to act <HI>with</HI> the Corporation in all GREAT and DIFFICULT Cases. So that <HI>supposing</HI> the Law of 42 was in some Respects still in Force, yet the College Charter of 50 comes afterwards and leaves NO Powers in that Law for the Overseers to act <HI>solely</HI> by themselves in <HI>any</HI> Cases of GREAT Importance! The Words in the Charter of 50 are these (<HI>Not</HI> they stand in the Copy of the Overseers CLERK and in some other <HI>faulty</HI> Copies of that Charter, which ought to be <HI>cor∣rected;</HI> but <HI>as</HI> the Words stand in the ORIGINAL Charter itself, and in the RECORDS of the General Court!) That <Q>For Direction in all emergent Occasions, Execution of all Orders and By-Laws, and for the procuring of a GENERAl Meeting of ALL the OVERSEERS <HI>and</HI> SOCIETY in GREAT and DIFFICULT Cases, and in Cases of Non-agreement; In ALL which Cases <HI>aforesaid,</HI> the Con∣clusion shall be made by the <HI>major Part,</HI> the said President having a casting Voice, the OVER∣SEERS

Such a <HI>loose</HI> LICENSE indulged, in inter∣preting Laws, wou'd destroy any Law in the World!—But when this Charter mentions "The <HI>Pro∣curing</HI> a general Meeting of all the Overseers and Society in great and difficult Cases" is it not self evi∣dent that it actually <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ans</HI> that such a Meeting <HI>should</HI> BE <HI>Procured</HI> in those Cases?

The <HI>Conclusion</HI> shall be made by the <HI>major Part</HI> (of the Cor∣poration) the President having a casting Voice, the Overseers CONSENTING thereunto. And thus 'tis evident to the Degree of <HI>Demonstration,</HI> that in NO great Cases and in NO difficult Cases had the Overseers a Power left them to act <HI>solely</HI> by themselves, after the Charter of 50 had incor∣porated said College! So <HI>carefully</HI> has this Charter guarded against an Independent and SOVEREIGN Power in the Overseers of said College to act without the Corporation in Matters of GREAT Mo∣ment. And <HI>so far</HI> is this Charter from granting or <HI>allowing</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Overseers a Power of acting, WITHOUT the Corporation in such Cases, that this Charter neither grants or <HI>allows</HI> it to the Over∣seers, <HI>even acting</HI> WITH <HI>the Corporation,</HI> unless a GENERAL Meeting of ALL the Overseers and of ALL the Corporation be procured for <HI>Concluding</HI> on such Affairs of Importance.</P>
<P>This is the Purport and Intent, this is <HI>Spirit, Soul and Body</HI> of that Charter (and which <HI>No</HI> Power can alter but THAT Power which can <HI>destroy</HI> this Charter itself) viz. That Cases <HI>of Im∣portance</HI> should be transacted in a <HI>General</HI> Assembly of the WHOLE Government of Harvard-Col∣lege: And not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be determined on by a PART, or, when <HI>unhappily</HI> divided and disagreeing in their Judgments, by "a Party.

— As in a late Case without a General, or even <HI>any</HI> Meeting of the Corporation, and also in the <HI>Winter</HI> Season and <HI>Recess</HI> of the General Court when there was not and <HI>could not</HI> be a general Meeting of the overseers themselves, some of those Magistrates and Teaching Elders, who are <HI>mention'd</HI> in the Law of 42, Met together and assumed to themselves the SOLE Power of turning out what Members of the Corporation they though sit. This was such an apparent receding from the Foun∣dation of Harward-College that if a few more Precedents of the like Sort were <HI>Submitted</HI> to, it would settle such a Power over that College that nothing could prevent the Ruin of its Constitution unless the Great and General Court, whose College it is, INTERPOSED and determined, as they did the LAST Time they Interposed "That the FIRST Foundation of that College and the GOVERNMENT thereof had its ORIGINAL from an ACT of the Court made and passed in the Year 1650, And ordered and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that <HI>according</HI> to that ACT the Overseers of said College should make NO Conclusion in GREAT and difficult Cases unless it were in a general Meeting of ALL the Over∣seers and Society, or Corporation, UNITED.—Without such a Remedy, the Consequences of the Overseers dismissing Members of the Corporation by themselves <HI>alone,</HI> when they have no such Power BY Charter, may be these: "That possibly, in Times <HI>to Come,</HI> so many Members of the Corporation may be dismissed <HI>solely</HI> by the Overseers, and so without any competent Authority, that those who succeed into their Places wou'd be meerly Members of the Corporation <HI>De Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> while those who were <HI>thus</HI> dismissed would be <HI>still</HI> Members of the Corporation <HI>De Jure.</HI> And t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> by Degrees there might be a Corporation <HI>De Facto,</HI> in Opposition to a Corporation <HI>De Jure.</HI> And THEN what would become of all the COLLEGE-STOCK!—It would no longer be in the Hands of a Corporation <HI>De Jure</HI> but only in the Hands of a Corporation <HI>De Facto,</HI> that is, in <HI>plain</HI> English, It would be in the Hands of NO Corporation <HI>at all!</HI></P>
<P>And yet if any Person belonging to Harvard-College offers to lisp this <HI>real</HI> and <HI>most certain</HI> Danger of all Things in that Society, He is <HI>industriously</HI> represented as One who is going to ruin the College!

THEN would be the Time for them to cry "Down with it—<HI>Rase it, rase it, even to the Foundation.</HI> —Or rather this Cry would be prevented with a Laugh at a Society that like the foolish Woman in the Proverbs <HI>Plucketh down her House with her own Hands;</HI> And thus such a Suggestion that "<HI>The</HI> COLLEGE <HI>is in Danger</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="005041_0021_10168D8B56D6F068"/>(and not that "The CHURCH is in Danger") answers itself, and is as STUPID as it is VIL∣LAINOUS. The <HI>Stupia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Part, no Doubt, came from some Teaching Elder in the COUNTRY; and the <HI>Villainous</HI> Part from some Long <HI>Chin</HI> who with his Brethren in Iniquity care not <HI>One</HI> SIX PENCE "What becomes of that College; or the Education of Youth in it: or whether the Tutors be∣longing to it, can examine Freshmen; or be able so much as to understand the BOOKS which they <HI>hear</HI> their Classes recite out of!—Or How many Thousands <HI>per Annum</HI> were squandered away by Parents for the Education of their Children in this sort; if <HI>ever</HI> it should <HI>so happen</HI> in future Times that such a Course of Things should <HI>prevail</HI> in that Place—THESE are the Men that want nothing but to keep the State of that Society in <HI>Darkness,</HI> and then (if they cou'd have the Influence of the Government in it) they know that they should be "The RULERS <HI>of that</HI> DARKNESS.—</P>
<P>BUT to <HI>resume</HI> the Argument drawn from the Clause in the Charter above cited which leaves NO Power in the Law of 42 for the Overseers of said College to act solely by themselves in any Cases of great Importance. "There is something still further remarkable with respect to these Words in the Charter of 50; and it is this; that the <HI>same</HI> Words are repeated over again without any <HI>real</HI> Al∣teration in the <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d</HI> Law relating to the College; though the manifest Design of the Law was to explain and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> some Parts of this Charter in <HI>Favour</HI> to the Overseers of said College. Now in this Law of 57 'tis expresly said, that <Q>for the procuring of a GENERAL Meeting of the Overseers and Society in GREAT and DIFFICULT Cases, and in Cases of Non-agreement—In All these Cases the Conclusion shall be valid [viz. for the procuring such a Meeting] being made by the major Part of the Corporation, the President having a casting Vote.</Q> —So that this Law confirms it <HI>over again</HI> and shows it to be the <HI>continued</HI> as well as <HI>original</HI> Sense of the Legistature, that in ALL Cases relating to said College which are <HI>difficult</HI> Cases or <HI>great</HI> Cases a GENERAL Meeting of the Overseers and of the Society (or Corporation) are to be procured.—And <HI>which Way</HI> the Conclusion shall be made on these Cases, when such a united Meeting of the Overseers and Corporation is procured, this Law does not <HI>say</HI>—And therefore does not <HI>alter!</HI> That is, this Law leaves it of Course <HI>without Alteration</HI> to the College-Charter of 50 which had already so clearly de∣termined that Point, that it needed <HI>No</HI> Explanation when this <HI>explanatory</HI> Law was made!</P>
<P>So that supposing t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Thousand Times over (and LET the <HI>Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s</HI> and <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y's</HI> of the Age, turn this Argument round and round 'till their HOT Heads grow giddy with it) "That the Over∣seers of said College had <HI>Some</HI> Powers left them to act solely by themselves <HI>after</HI> the Charter of 50 was granted; yet 'tis still TRUE that the Charter of 50 and its Appendix in 57, show the <HI>Original</HI> and <HI>Continued</HI> Sense of the Legistature to be "That in all <HI>Difficult</HI> Cases and in all <HI>Great</HI>

And this is the whole that the present Argument is concerned with.</NOTE> gives to the Overseers (and that in a General Meeting of ALL their Number) only a Power of <HI>counselling</HI> and <HI>consenting</HI> to Acts of the Corporation in <HI>great</HI> and difficult Cases.— How then is it <HI>possible</HI> for the Overseers of said College (against <HI>Both</HI> these Laws, and without <HI>any</HI> Law for it) To have the SOLE Power in so <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Difficult</HI> a Case as <HI>That</HI> of removing a President or any other Mem∣ber of the said Corporation. It <HI>Ought</HI> to be spoke out freely, "That, such a Power is an IMPOSSIBLE Power! And whenever it is assumed, all its Acts are <HI>essentially</HI> Nullities.

<P>Some of the Consequences of which (together with the assuming a Power to make Members of the Corporation <HI>De Facto</HI> in Opposition to those that are so <HI>De Jure</HI>) 'Tis of the last Impor∣tance to consider more at large than as yet they have been. 1. In such a Case while <HI>Some</HI> only (and not the <HI>Major</HI> Part) of the Members are meerly <HI>De Facto</HI> Members of the Corporation; 'Twill be <HI>utterly</HI> uncertain whether any of their Acts are VALID or not: And that for this plain Reason; Because so many of their Votes may turn upon the Votes of a <HI>De Facto</HI> Member, whose Vote will be no Vote at all <HI>De Jure:</HI> And so the Votes of the said Corporation <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mselves</HI> (when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urning on such Votes) will really <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> at all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is chosen a Member of that Corporation, in <HI>Fact,</HI> he will not be a Member of that Corporation of <HI>right;</HI> Which (by the By) will be a <HI>quick</HI> Way of making the Majority of that Corporation to consist of meer <HI>De Facto</HI> Members <HI>only!</HI> And thus when any Money is let out, who can say whether 'tis rightfully let out or not; or when any Lands or Tenements belonging to said College are<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">By <HI>express</HI> Charter the <HI>major Part</HI> of the Corporation can Lease, though the rest are absent.

For there would be only three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>al Members to concur to such an Act. And <HI>Three</HI> Members make no <HI>Quorum</HI> of the Corporation.

And shows the Sense of the Legislature to be the same on these Point<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> which it was at <HI>first</HI> when the Charter of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was granted. And it appeare that the Legislature never altered their Sense of these Matters, but on the contrary, showed <HI>This</HI> to be their Sense <HI>over again,</HI> the <HI>Last</HI> Time they INTERPOSED to regulate the Constitution of said College, <HI>When</HI> in Dec. 1707. The Court <HI>Referred</HI> Harvard College back again to the Act of 50 as <HI>the</HI> ORIGINAL <HI>of</HI> THAT <HI>House, and of the</HI> GOVERNMENT <HI>thereof; N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w</HI> on <HI>This</HI> Act all these Rea∣sonings are grounded, And <HI>That</HI> as on their ORIGINAL likewise! and being thus placed on the same firm BASIS as Harvard College itself is, They must Stand <HI>or Fall!</HI> with THAT <HI>House and the</HI> GOVERNMENT <HI>Thereof.—</HI>So that from all these concurring Arguments it appears to be an Impossibility <HI>in</HI> LAW that the Overseers of said College, should have the <HI>Sole</HI> Power in themselves to dismiss a Member of that Corporation. And therefore if they have any Power, in such a Case, it must be in Conjunction <HI>With</HI> the Corporation and not <HI>Without</HI> Them!—Which is the next Thing to be considered and perhaps may be effectually disproved. For</P>
<P N="3">III. The Law, or CHARTER, which incorporated Harvard College, grants not the Power of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing</HI> a PRESIDENT or ANY <HI>other</HI> Member of the Corporation, to the Overseers and Corporation of said College in Conjunction:—<HI>Any more than it does to</HI> EITHER <HI>of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> singly <HI>and a Part.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="005041_0026_10168D998805B218"/>
Here let to be noted that a <HI>Guard</HI> was placed at the <HI>very</HI> Entrance on the last general Article (page 18) against such a Power, as being no where granted in the Charter of 50, either to the Overseer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or to the Corporation, or to <HI>Both</HI> conjointly. And thus the General Argument on this Head, in the Preceeding Article, is carried on <HI>Hypothetically</HI> and by Way of <HI>Supposition</HI> only. viz. <Q>That IF the Overseers of said College had any Power in such a Case, it must be in Conjunction <HI>with</HI> the Corporation and not <HI>without</HI> Them.</Q> But now the Writer of this Pamphlet comes to argue <HI>Categorically</HI> and <HI>Directly</HI> against such a Power in the Overseers and Corporation of said Col∣lege. And therefore to BEGIN.—By the Charter of 50 the <HI>Only</HI> Power granted to the Overseers and Corporation, in this Case, is <Q>To make a NEW Member of the Corporation <HI>so often and from Time to Time as any of the</HI> Former <HI>shall</HI> DIE <HI>or be</HI> REMOVED.</Q> Here the Law stops short: And no where says "HOW or <HI>By</HI> WHOM, a <HI>President or Fellow</HI> of the Corporation shall be <HI>removed;</HI> And so the <HI>General</HI> COURT having this Power originally in Themselves, <HI>over their</HI> OWN <HI>Col∣lege!</HI> And <HI>not</HI> here granting it to any Persons whatever, this Power therefore remains <HI>Still</HI> in the COURT; and the COURT alone have it to this Day:— As <HI>None but the</HI> COURT had such a Pow∣er <HI>Before</HI> the Overseers and Corporation were appointed by the Law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of 42 and 50, when they dis∣missed Mr. <HI>Eaton</HI> from his Presidency in said College; and as <HI>None</HI> but <HI>the</HI> COURT had this Power <HI>After</HI> the Overseers and Corporation were appointed, and FULLY <HI>invested</HI> with ALL their Powers, when in 1654 the Court <HI>delegated</HI> the Overseers as their Committee to treat with the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> President Mr. <HI>Dunster,</HI> and to <HI>receive</HI> his final Resignation, and <HI>to make</HI> RETURN to the Court of what they had done in that Affair, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> never after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Law, granted this Power to any Persons whatever.</P>
<P>Now to clear this Argument from that MIST of Obscurity, which modern Notions and some <HI>No∣vel</HI> Practices have cast upon it, let those Premises be again considered which were laid down a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Beginning of this Discourse, viz. <Q>That Harvard College was originally the College of the Gene∣ral Court; for that Court <HI>built</HI> it, and <HI>named</HI> and <HI>endowed</HI> it, as well as <HI>incorporated</HI> the same. —Therefore ALL Power over that College was originally in the General Court <HI>alone.</HI>—There∣fore NO Powers over that College which have not been actually granted to others by some Law, CAN belong to any Persons whatever, but are <HI>Still</HI> the Powers of the Court, <HI>at tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> as they were at the Beginning when all Power over that College existed in the General Court alone, before the Times wherein the Court gave <HI>Some</HI> PART of their Power, <HI>ever</HI> THEIR OWN <HI>College,</HI> to the Overseers and Corporation by the Acts of 42 and 50.</Q>—So that ALL Powers whatever that have not been <HI>communicated</HI> to the said Overseers and Corporation, by some positive Law or Grant from the General Court, still continue in that Court; as the Water which has not as yet been <HI>communicated</HI> to the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rian</HI> or <HI>Rivulet</HI> still <HI>continues</HI> in the FOUNTAIN.— This is a <HI>certain</HI> Truth as to the Power of remov∣ing a <HI>Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dent</HI> or <HI>Any</HI> Member of that Corporation; for there is no Law or Charter whatever in which
<PB N="28" REF="005041_0027_10168D9D5CE362C0"/>the Court has <HI>communicated</HI> this Power to Others; and therefore this Power remains in the <HI>Fountain</HI> of ALL Power over that College, which is the GENERAL COURT alone! If any Thing farther need to be added, in <HI>so plain a</HI> CASE! there are two Things that may be urged which put it out of all Question that the Ge∣neral Court reserved this Power to Themselves among other Powers of VISITATION which the Court <HI>never</HI> granted to <HI>any</HI> Persons whatever!</P>
<P N="1">1. The First is that the explanatory Law of 57 is <HI>more Silent</HI> on this Power than the Charter of 50 itself! Now one <HI>great</HI> Design of this Law of 57 was to explain or determine what might <HI>seem</HI> obscure and undermined in the Charter of 50; and of all <HI>Cases</HI> that needed to be explained or determined in said Charter, <HI>This</HI> Case (<HI>supposing</HI> it to be contained in that Charter!) needed it the most; take it <HI>either</HI> Way, viz. as a Case not determined <HI>at all</HI> in that Charter, or as of Importance to be determined and not <HI>fitting</HI> to be left at a loose!—<HI>Yet</HI> does that explanatory Law leave this Clause in the Charter (which barely mentions the removing Members of the Corporation, <HI>without</HI> mentioning who had the Power to remove them) at as great a loose as it was before! And though this Law descends to such <HI>little</HI> Affairs as "How the Corporation should hold a Meeting to agree with <HI>College-Servants</HI> and be responsible to the Overseers for all <HI>such</HI> Agreements; yet this Law says not one Word on so <HI>great</HI> and so <HI>undetermined</HI> a Case as this "Who should have the Power of removing a <HI>President</HI> or <HI>Fellow</HI> of said Corporation" which (on <HI>both</HI> the Accounts <HI>above</HI>) needed more to be explained or determined by this Law of 57 than any Thing in that Charter whatever. Nothing therefore can <HI>account</HI> for the Reason why this explanatory Law should pass over so important a Matter in Silence, but this, viz. that such a Power, not being granted in said Char∣ter to any Persons whatever, was never looked on in <HI>those</HI> Times to be contained in that Charter <HI>at all.</HI> And THEN the Wonder ceases why this explanatory Law did not determine or settle" Who had or should have such a Power; for this Law was to explain or determine what was IN the said Charter, and <HI>not</HI> this Power which was <HI>Still</HI> in the General Court (for who can imagine that the Court in this explanatory Law designed to explain or settle their OWN Powers?) And hereon also <HI>Another</HI> Wonder ceases viz. Why the Overseers of said College should be so <HI>wanting to Themselves</HI> as no to put such a Thing into their <HI>Proposals</HI> to the Court for Explanation (though these PROPOSALS, which were for the <HI>Benefit</HI> of the Over∣seers, was the very Occasion of making this Law itself, as appears from the Preamble.) The Reason hereof seems to be very plain viz. Because ALL Parties concerned with the Government of the College were <HI>conscious,</HI> in those early Times which were so near the Time wherein said Charter was granted, that the <HI>Power</HI> of removing the <HI>President</HI> or <HI>any</HI> Member of said Corporation was never given BY Charter to any Persons whaterver, but that the Court had reserved it to themselves. And therefore if one (among the rest) of the PROPOSALS of the Overseers to the Court had been to explain or determine "Who had the Power of removing the President, or any other Members of the Corporation, on <HI>Male-Administration</HI> of when guilty of <HI>sundry Crimes and Misdemeanours;</HI> The Overseers of said College (with all due and <HI>sincere</HI> Deference to them be it mentioned) might have been honourably <HI>reminded</HI> by the <HI>Court</HI> "WHO had <HI>This</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="005041_0028_10168D9EF092AD58"/>Power <HI>in Themselves</HI> but three Years before, in the Case of President <HI>Dunster</HI> "When the Court thought <HI>fit</HI> to appoint the Overseers (without joining the Corporation <HI>with</HI> them) as their Com∣mittee to manage that Affair, and "to make <HI>Return</HI> to the Court of what they had done therein."</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Thing which puts it out of Question that the Court reserved this Power to Themselves, is, the manifest Difference made in the Charter between the removing a Member of the Corporation and removing inferiour College Officers and Servants. Now to exhibit this to <HI>Eye sight,</HI> let those two Passages be laid together, which are the <HI>only</HI> Passages in the Charter that mention the removing of Both these Kinds of Officers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chusing</HI> and <HI>Removing</HI> Members of the Cor∣poration <HI>by</HI> Charter. <Q>And the said seven Persons or the greater Number of them procuring the Pre∣sence of the Overseers of the College, and by their Counc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l and Consent shall have Power, and are hereby authorized, at any Time or Times to ELECT <HI>a new President Fellows or Treasurer</HI> so often and from Time to Time <HI>as any of the said Person or Persons</HI> SHALL <HI>die or</HI> BE <HI>removed</HI></Q>—</P>
<P>FINIS to <HI>This</HI> Power granted in the Charter!</P>
<P>The <HI>Chusing</HI> and <HI>Removing</HI> College Servants <HI>by</HI> Charter. <Q>And the President and Fellows, or major Part of them, from Time to Time may meet and CHUSE such <HI>Officers and Servants</HI> for the College, and make such Allowance to them, <HI>and</HI> THEM <HI>also to</HI> REMOVE, <HI>and after</HI> DEATH <HI>or</HI> REMOVAL <HI>to chuse such others</HI>—as they shall think Fit.</Q></P>
<P>Thus <HI>equally</HI> express and particular is this Law in specifying Who should have the Power of <HI>chusing</HI> Both these Kinds of Officers. But when it comes to say Who should have the Power to <HI>remove</HI> Then. -THEN <HI>appears the Difference!</HI> for as to the <HI>small</HI> Power of removing College Servants, the Law is as plain and express "Who should have <HI>That</HI> Power, as it is "Who should have the Power to <HI>Chuse</HI> them. But as to the <HI>important</HI> Power of removing Members of the Corporation (which in Law can exist separately from the Power of chusing them, as well as in Conjunction <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h</HI> it, and <HI>often</HI> does so in Colleges <HI>abroad</HI>) Here the Law is all over <HI>altum Silentium</HI>—Not a <HI>Word</HI> is said who should have this Power!—Now what Reason can be assign'd for so manifest a Difference, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his? viz. That the latter Power being of so much greater Importance than that of removing College <HI>Servants,</HI> the Court who had <HI>All</HI> Power originally in themselves over this College (and who therefore could sover∣eignly grant the Power of chusing <HI>without</HI> granting t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower of removing, just as they <HI>pleased</HI>) did not <HI>intend</HI> in this Law to grant the important Power of removing Members of that Corporation, out of their own Hands; but thought <HI>fit</HI> to reserve it to themselves, among those <HI>Visitatorial</HI> Powers which the Court originally had over this College and never granted to <HI>Any</HI> Persons whatever.</P>
<P>The <HI>only</HI> Objection that can be here made has, in Reality, been obviated already, viz. That <Q>tis implied of Course, and in the Nature of the Thing that those have the Power of <HI>removing</HI> who by Charter have the Power of <HI>making</HI> Members of the Corporation; since the Court mention not, in
<PB N="30" REF="005041_0029_10168DA09360B950"/>the Charter, who should have the Power of removing them or grant it to others.</Q> But this Objecti∣on suppresses <HI>one Half</HI> of the Truth; if the <HI>Whole</HI> Truth had been given, the Objection would appear inconclusive a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first View: Thus <Q>that 'tis implied of Course and in the Nature of the Thing <HI>[<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther]</HI> that those, who by Charter have the Power of <HI>making</HI> Members of the Corporation, have the Power of <HI>removing</HI> them [or else <HI>that the</HI> COURT, <HI>who</HI> originally <HI>had this Power, did not part with it</HI> at all, <HI>but reserved it to themselves</HI>] since the Court mention not in the Charter who should have this Power or grant it to others.</Q> Now that the latter of these Suppositions is <HI>True,</HI> appears by what has been said already; and may further appear beyond Contradiction by what follows. For 1. The <HI>Former</HI> Supposition (on which the Objection is grounded) no Way <HI>accounts</HI> for the Reason why this Law so expresly grants the <HI>small</HI> Power of <HI>Removing</HI> (as well as chusing) the <HI>inferiour</HI> Officers; and <HI>yet</HI> makes no Grant at all of so much <HI>greater</HI> a Power as that of removing the <HI>Superiour.</HI> Whence comes it <HI>to pass!</HI> that this Law does not leave the <HI>lesser</HI> Power of removing College Servants, to be <HI>implied of Course</HI> in the Power of <HI>chusing</HI> them; as well as according to this Supposition, it does the <HI>greater</HI> Power of removing Members of the Corporation?—If this Law had not expresly mentioned who should have the Power of removing <HI>Either</HI> of these Kinds of Officers, the Objection would then have been of some Force— Or if the Law had expresly mentioned who should have the <HI>greater</HI> Power of removing Members of the Corporation and had said nothing about the <HI>lesser</HI> Power of removing College <HI>Servants;</HI> then it might have been supposed (what seems to be the <HI>true</HI> Way of arguing in such Cases) that the <HI>Greater</HI> Power being granted, the <HI>Lesser</HI> was left to be <HI>understood</HI> and so <HI>implied of course.</HI> But since, unfortunately, for the Objection 'tis quite the contrary. "What possible Reason can be given [if this Law supposes <HI>of course</HI> and in the <HI>Nature of the Thing,</HI> these are to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the POWER <HI>of removing</HI> who have the Power of <HI>making</HI> College Officers] that the Law is not as silent on the <HI>petty</HI> Power of removing a College <HI>Ser∣vant,</HI> as it is absolutely silent about the <HI>important</HI> Power of removing a President or other Members of that Corporation? This is easily accounted for, on Supposition that the Court reserved this <HI>greater</HI> Power entirely to themselves; but 'tis impossible to account for it on Supposition that the Court made NO such Reserve. 2. There is no Connection in the <HI>Nature of the Thing</HI> between the Power of removing and the Power of putting into Office. So that it cannot be inferred that both these Powers are granted <HI>only</HI> because One of them is so. Yea 'tis utterly untrue in <HI>Fact</HI> that those always have the Power of removing, who have the Power of putting into Office. And of this the Representatives themselves, belonging to that Honourable Court who made this Law, are a known and publick Instance! For by the Choice of their respective Towns they are <HI>made</HI> Representatives; but their respective Towns, 'tis well known, have not the Power of removing their Representatives from out of the General Court; But the House, alone, who have not the Power to <HI>make</HI> Representatives for the Province, have yet the sole Power to remove them from their Place in the House. So that 'tis not true <HI>either Way,</HI> that those have the Power
<PB N="31" REF="005041_0030_10168DA60BE75918"/>of removing, who have the sole Power of putting into Place or Trust; nor those the Power of putting into Place, who have the sole Power of removing a Person from Place or Trust—and that from one of the most Honourable PLACES and <HI>Trusts</HI> in the Province. Thus it appears, from so <HI>eminent</HI> an In∣stance, that there is no Connection in the <HI>Nature of the Thing</HI> between these two Powers.—In Truth, they are sometimes granted and conveyed separately and sometimes in Conjunction, just as the supreme Power from whom they are communicated thinks <HI>fit.</HI> Certainly then a <HI>General Court</HI> who originally had these two Powers over a College that was a Creature of their OWN, may grant the <HI>One</HI> and sovereignly keep the <HI>Other</HI> to themselves without granting it <HI>at all.</HI> Now an absolute SILENCE, under some Circumstances, upon One of these Powers (when the other is <HI>expresly</HI> and <HI>formally</HI> granted) is every Way equivalent to an <HI>Exception;</HI> and so makes an express <HI>Negation</HI> of such a Grant to be <HI>intirely</HI> superfluous. And of this sort is that <HI>Silence</HI> in the Charter on the Power of removing Members of the Corporation; for, by what has been observed above, it can be accounted for <HI>no other</HI> Way. But 3. and <HI>finally</HI> to de∣cide this Matter "On which Side of the Question are ancient Practices upon this Law? These are the best Expositors of ancient Laws. Now let the Case of President <HI>Dunster</HI> (p. 5. &amp; 9—12 of this Paper) be read over in View to the Charter on this Point, and it will appear that no <HI>Comment</HI> ever determined the Meaning of a TEXT better than the Account of this Case determines (what the Charter has not <HI>expresly</HI> done) by whom <HI>the President, Fellows or Treasurer</HI> SHALL <HI>be removed!</HI> —<HI>The</HI> JUDGES on this Law (as <HI>Visitors</HI>) in his Case, were the Legislature who made the Law. And who can explain or determine the Sense of a Law so well as the Legislature who made it?—particularly if a great Part of that Legislature consists of the same <HI>individual</HI> Persons who framed and passed such a Law; which, from the <HI>Elections</HI> in the Records <HI>for</HI> the Year 1690 and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appears in this Case to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>!— <HI>The Overseers and Corporation</HI> also to whom the Charter of 50 was granted, consisted by a great Majority of the same Persons in 1654 when Mr. <HI>Dunster</HI> was dismissed, as they did in 1650. So that the generality of all Persons concerned in his Case must have had a perfect Understanding and even <HI>personal Knowledge</HI> of the Powers granted in the Charter; and of the Reason of that SILENCE in it, on the Power of removing Members of the Corporation. <HI>The Time</HI> also was so <HI>near</HI> the Time when that Charter was granted, that the very IDEAS of the several Power put into it, and the Import of the Clause that is so <HI>Silent</HI> on the Power of removing Members of that Corporation must have been <HI>fresh</HI> and <HI>lively</HI> in the Minds of all these Persons who were concerned in his Dismission. And now with such singular Advantages to know and to judge of the Sense of this Law "How <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the all judge and act upon it in his Case? <HI>Why</HI> ALL <HI>alike!</HI> —with the <HI>same</HI> Sentiments, the <HI>same</HI> Views of the Charter on this Point.—Thus Mr. <HI>Dunster</HI> when he found he <HI>must</HI> resign, appears to be at no Loss "<HI>To Whom</HI> to resign. And thus <HI>the Court,</HI> to whom he resigned, ap∣pear to receive his Resignation as a Matter the Cognisance of which belonged properly to them; and
<PB N="32" REF="005041_0031_10168DA8AE33DD98"/>as what came <HI>regularly</HI> before them, without coming <HI>at all</HI> before the Overseers and Corporation! —And when the Court <HI>delegated</HI> their Power to the Overseers as their Committee to manage this Affair and <HI>make Return</HI> upon it, they do it just as they might have appointed any other Persons to do the same Thing <HI>for</HI> them!— Nor is there the <HI>least</HI> Appearance that the <HI>Overseers</HI> or Mr. <HI>Dunster</HI> or the <HI>Corporation</HI> ever thought that his Dismission, without <HI>Any</HI> Act of the Overseers and Corporation for it, was not altogether according to Charter; nor did ANY <HI>of these Gentlemen</HI> thro' the WHOLE of their long Conferences and mutual Replies (which lasted so many Months and gave them all so much Oc∣casion to <HI>canvass</HI> this Point) ever <HI>once suggest</HI> that the Power of removing that President was vested by Charter in the Overseers and Corporation. Not a Man of them ALL appears to <HI>know</HI> (what, with the Advantages above described, they <HI>must</HI> have known! if it had been implied in that Charter at all) that "Those had the Power of <HI>removing</HI> Members of the Corporation who by Charter had the Power of <HI>making</HI> them such."—And <HI>yet</HI> 'tis now pretended by some of their late Posterity (who are of Yester∣day and <HI>know nothing</HI>) that 'tis so clear and obvious a Sense of the Charter that those should have the Power of <HI>removing</HI> who have Power of <HI>chusing,</HI> that <HI>'tis implied of course</HI> and <HI>in the Nature of the Thing</HI> "ridiculous. Such <HI>modern</HI> Refinements on the Charter which some <HI>Children</HI> of our Forefathers have made long since their Day, are of NO Account; while the UNITED Sense of the <HI>original</HI> Grantors and Grantees, in the only Instance of dismissing a Member of that Corporation, is on the other Side of the Question; and every rational Argument, grounded on the <HI>Silence</HI> of the Charter, and the <HI>Silence</HI> of the Appendix to the Charter, is on the same Side of the Question also. It having been shewn that <HI>such</HI> Silence could no Way be accounted for but by taking it (not as <HI>implying of courss</HI> a Grant of such a Power, but the reverse) as <HI>indicating</HI> that the Court made no Grant of this Power at all, but reserved it to themselves—Nor does it seem in the least strange that the Power of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ing Members of that Cor∣poration should be separated from that of <HI>chusing</HI> them; or if it <HI>did,</HI> 'tis nothing to the Question; for as Chief Justice <HI>Holt</HI> observes on the Power that Founders of Colleges have in such Cases, <Q>The Question is not, What is reasonable for the Founder to do, but what be <HI>has done</HI> on perusal of the Statute.—His WILL is his REASON in disposing and ordering <HI>his</HI> OWN.</Q> And thus in the present Case; If it appears (as it plainly does <HI>on Perusal of the Statute!</HI>) that the Court as Founder <HI>has made a</HI> Separation of these Powers; the sovereign WILL of the Legislature in <HI>disposing its OWN</HI> after this Man∣ner, <HI>is</HI> and OUGHT to be "Reason sufficient" for <HI>All</HI> beneath them to acquiesce in — supposing no <HI>other</HI> Reason could be assigned; which yet is not the Case in the Instance before us, for a wise and just Reason <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> obvious: — The important Powers of <HI>Visitation</HI> were never granted in that Charter; Now the Power of removing Members from <HI>out</HI> of that Corporation is of as great Importance as most Powers of Visitation are, and is of much greater than that of electing Members <HI>into</HI> it. So that these two
<PB N="33" REF="005041_0032_10168DAA388446E8"/>Powers might with very good Reason be separated; and the <HI>Greater</HI> be reserved (on the same wise Reason that ALL Powers of Visitation were reserved) while the <HI>losser</HI> was granted. For as to elect∣ing such Members; No Person among a fit Number of Candidates has an antecedent <HI>Right</HI> to be chosen, and so is not legally injured if passed by; Nor can he claim an <HI>Appeal,</HI> if not chosen; Nor does it really imply that he is criminal in the Eyes of the Electors. But 'its quite otherwise when a Person <HI>already</HI> in a Corporation is turned out of it. This must be for Crimes; and high Crimes; the World will so take it; and his Credit as to any future Trust or Place, and even in the common Employments of Life for Subsistence, may <HI>suffer</HI> on this Account. The <HI>present</HI> Presi∣dent (his <HI>own</HI> Conscience being Witness!) Would look on it as more ignominious to be turned out of his Place in that Corporation, than never to have been chosen into it at all, but have continued on his Ministry in the Church of which he was teaching Elder, Now it has often happened in Colleges <HI>abroad</HI> (and been as often lamented by the best Friends to such Societies when it <HI>has</HI> hap∣pened) that some Presidents and Heads of Colleges have been <HI>Set</HI> and <HI>Bent</HI> on aggrandizing them∣selves and enlarging their own Power by <HI>all Manner</HI> of Ways and Means. In one Word, "The Constitution which gives them <HI>No</HI> negative, and on which therefore they are but PRIMI <HI>inter</HI> PARES is what they <HI>cannot</HI> bear! Nothing short of BASHAW. Government will content them. And with a few leading Members gained over to their Side, and some others <HI>intimidated,</HI> they can compass their Ends and <HI>Tyrannize</HI> over the Rest of their EQUALS who only stand up for the Rights of their own Place and the Priviledges of such Societies against the ambitio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Heads and Presidents of <HI>this</HI> Sort, who will never leave till they have made such <HI>troublesome</HI> Equals fall Victims to these TURKISH Politicks. Now since in this Court, which incorporated Harvard-College, there were many worthy and learned Gentlemen, who had been educated in Colleges abroad, they must have seen ENOUGH of this Mis∣chief! To excite their Care to guard against it in a College they were <HI>then</HI> founding in this Land; and therefore they might judge the most effectual Way to prevent it, was to put NO <HI>such Power</HI> into the Charter, as That of <HI>amoving</HI> Members of that Corporation, which 'twas the <HI>Interest,</HI> and so of∣ten the <HI>Inclination</HI> of Heads and leading Members of such Corporations to <HI>Abuse.</HI> And thus the Court in their Wisdom might think <HI>fit</HI> to reserve this <HI>important</HI> Power among those Powers of VI∣SITATION which were never granted in that Charter at all; and among which, according to chief Justice <HI>Holt,</HI> the FOUNDERS of Colleges can reserve just what <HI>particular</HI> Powers they please. This leads in the last Place to consider who are the VISITORS of Harvard College, and therefore to say—</P>

IV. THE GREAT and GENERAL COURT who <HI>founded</HI> Harvard College, and appointed <HI>No</HI> Vi∣sitors to it, when they finally incorporated the same, are the <HI>Sole</HI> local VISITORS of that College.</P>
<P>Colleges <HI>must</HI> have Visitors! "Every College, says <HI>Holt</HI> on Colleges, hath a VISITOR either by to Appointment of the Founder, or the <HI>Law</HI>" so that if the Founder appoints no Visitor himself, the Law will do it for him. To imagine therefore that Harvard College has no Visitor is not only a <HI>vain</HI> Fancy but a <HI>dangerous</HI> Delusion!—If that Society has none, the Conclusion is short "Har∣vard College is NO Corporation in Law" And <HI>Then</HI> what will become of all their STOCK. 'Tis, on this Supposition, gone <HI>for ever</HI> out of the Hands of those SEVEN that pass by the <HI>idle</HI> Name of President and Fellows of Harvard College."—<HI>The very</HI> FERRYMEN will despise them! And those must be <HI>weaker</HI> than FERRYMEN who give any further Donations to an unincorporated Number of Men that can re∣ceive none, or Let them to Use, or sue for them in again, by any NAME that they <HI>dare</HI> publickly own and can <HI>maintain</HI> in Law. But if that College is a Corporation, the Conclusion is as short the other Way, that "VISITORS there are and <HI>must be</HI> Somewhere", and <HI>These</HI> can call the whole Body of them to Account and make the loftiest Head of that College to TREMBLE if they find him spoiling his LORD's <HI>Goods</HI> or smiting his Brethren with the FIST of Wickedness. The Power of VISITORS does not de∣pend on any accidental or local Customs or Laws. It depends not even on the Appointment of the Founder himself! But has a <HI>necessary</HI> Existence; and his Heirs <HI>will</HI> have it after him, if he appoints no VISTOR to a College or his own rounding. Now the Court alone founded Harvard College, and appointed no Visitor to it. So <HI>None</HI> but the Court could be the Visitors; and therefore, as Heir, none but the Legistature is or <HI>can be</HI> the local VISITORS of this College.</P>
<P>Here let the Proof of this 4th Article and the general <HI>Assertions</HI> under it be made out. The grea∣ter Part shall be taken from what Dr. <HI>Ayliff</HI> (i. e. L. L. D.) has written in his Account of the Uni∣versity of OXFORD," in which this <HI>Doctor of</HI> LAWS has treated at large on the Power of <HI>Visitors</HI> as warranted by Custom, Law, and common Right. Here then 1. It <HI>must</HI> be said that Harvard Col∣lege is a LAY <HI>Corporation.</HI> <Q>A College, says the Dr. Vol. 2. Pag. 52, is an ecclesiastical Corpo∣ration, by Cannon Law, if the Number of <HI>Clerks</HI> exceed or equal that of <HI>Laymen:</HI> If not; 'Tis confessed to be a LAY Corporation.</Q> Now in the Charter of 50, which is the sole Foundation of Harvard College <HI>as</HI> a Corporation, there is no Provision made for any <HI>Clerks</HI> at all! And so 'tis <HI>accidental</HI> to that Foundation, whether those who are upon it be <HI>Clerks</HI> or Lawyers or Physicians. Yea as to the <HI>Fact,</HI> viz. What Function the first SEVEN on that Foundation <HI>happened</HI> to be of, it appears there were six <HI>Laymen</HI> to one <HI>Clerk.</HI> Yet further, if the Overseers were here considered (as being <HI>on</HI> the Foundation though not incorporated upon it) it appears that the <HI>Honourable</HI> were twenty, and the <HI>Reverend</HI> not more than ten, when first set on the Foundation of 50. And thus if the said Corpo∣ration are taken singly, or together with the Overseers, and this in View either to <HI>Fact</HI> or <HI>Right,</HI> it appears that more <HI>Laymen</HI> were on the Foundation than <HI>Clerks.</HI> So that according to Dr. <HI>Ayl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> <Q>It must be <HI>confessed</HI> that Harvard College is a LAY Corporation.</Q> 'Tis evident also from the express Design of the Institution that the said Corporation is <HI>not</HI> acclesiastical. All the Passages in the Char∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er relating to its <HI>Design</HI> are these, "For the Advancement of all good Literature Arts and Sciences." This is plainly an Institution <HI>at large.</HI> Again "For the Education of Youth in Knowledge and Godliness." Now Godliness does not distinguish a <HI>Clerk</HI> from a <HI>Layman</HI> any more than <HI>Knowledge</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="005041_0034_10168DAF9CDB5FF8"/>does. Lastly <Q>For the Advancement and Education of Youth in <HI>all Manner</HI> of good Literature Arts and Sciences,</Q> This Design is as unappropriated as <HI>can</HI> be; 'Tis common and <HI>indifferent</HI> to all; and <HI>not</HI> as we are told in ELECTION Sermons that <Q>the <HI>great</HI> and <HI>peculiar</HI> Design of our pi∣ous Ancestours in founding this College was that it might be a NURSERY for the Gospel-Ministry a∣mong us, and to supply our Churches with Pastors and Teachers</Q> nothing of this is written by <HI>our pious Ancestors</HI> in the Charter; and 'tis <HI>directly</HI> against the very TEXT of the Charter itself; and so it must pass for <HI>Oral</HI> Tradition. And thus this College taken in all Views is <HI>not</HI> an ecclesiastical Corporation: If it had been so, the Right of Visitation (according to <HI>Ayliff</HI> Pag. 7. And <HI>Holt</HI> on Colleges) would have devolved to the CHURCH as <HI>Heir;</HI> but now we must look elsewhere for this Right. And therefore 2. It must be determined who were the <HI>Founders</HI> of this College. Now <HI>Ayliff</HI> Page 6. says <Q>He is the Founder of a College who <HI>First</HI> erects and endowes it and not He who incorporates it.</Q> In this Sense of Founding (as distinguished from the incorporating ACT by which <HI>alone</HI> a College is founded as a Body politick) the Dr. goes on and says, <Q>If the King and a common Person at the same Time gives Lands &amp;c. to a College <HI>on</HI> its Foundation [viz. o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being FIRST erected and endowed] The King is said to be the Founder by Reason of his Eminence; But if a common Person founds a College WITH Possessions of small Value, and the King afterwards endowes it with greater, yet the common Person shall be taken to be the Founder and not the King.</Q> Hence "th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n by a Parity of Reason; In the first Case, supposing any common Persons had been <HI>as early</HI> in erecting and endowing that College as the Court was, yet the Court alone (by Reason of its <HI>Eminence</HI>) would have been the Founder; and these common Persons could by no Means be stiled <HI>Co-Founders</HI> with the Court! But in the latter Case <HI>(a fortiori)</HI> the Court is the sole Founder: For if a common Person, on being the <HI>First</HI> in erecting and endowing that College, would have held the Name of Foun∣der against the Court itself; certainly then the Court, who <HI>really were</HI> the FIRST, will hold the Name of Founder against all common Persons; let these afterwards give ever so much to it. Now that the Court were <HI>First</HI> in erecting and endowing it, appears from the <HI>Province</HI> and <HI>College Records</HI> compared Page 4. 5, of this Paper. The Court first began the FUND for erecting and endowing this College in 1636. But what all private Persons gave to is was <HI>afterwards;</HI> and in particular what Mr. <HI>Harvard</HI> gave to it was by WILL in 1638. Hence then Mr. <HI>Harvard</HI> and all other private Donours were <HI>Benefactors</HI> to this College: but the COURT alone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Founders</HI> This brings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> directly to the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ters</HI> of said Col∣lege. For 3. The <HI>Founder</HI> and his Heirs MUST be the Visitors of a College, that is a <HI>lay</HI> Corporation, if he appoints no Visitor to it himself.—Though Corporations for publick Governmennt as Cities, Towns, &amp;c. have no Visitors, yet chief Justice <HI>Holt</HI> affirms of private Societies founded on the Score of Charity (as he says all Colleges <HI>are</HI>) that <Q>Where there is a Corporation, as a <HI>College</HI> or Hospital, there <HI>must</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Visitors (Tit, <HI>Visitors</HI>)</Q> A College <HI>cannot</HI> BE without a Visitor, says <HI>Ayliff.</HI> Page 74. <Q>It is not <HI>at the Plea∣sure</HI> of the Founder whether there <HI>shall be</HI> a Visitor or not. Page 76." A Visitor says <HI>Holt,</HI> is of <HI>Necessi∣ty</HI> by Law!—This Power was not introduced by <HI>Canons</HI> or Constitutions ecclesistical; but is an <HI>Appoint∣ment i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Law;</HI> it arises from the Property which the <HI>Founder</HI> had in the Lands given &amp;c. and as HE is the <HI>Author</HI> of the Charity, the <HI>Law</HI> gives HIM and his HEIRS a visitatorial Power</Q> (Tit. <HI>Visitors</HI>) Thus this Right has a necessary Existence. 'Tis originally in the Founder and <HI>Will</HI> descend to his Heirs if he appoint <HI>No</HI> Visitor himself. Herein Dr. <HI>Ayliff</HI> and a greater than the Dr, are express. <Q>If there be no particular Visitor appointed by the <HI>Founder's</HI> Statutes, the Law appoints the <HI>Founder</HI> and his <HI>Heirs</HI> to be Visitors. Thus <HI>Ayliff</HI> Page 76. In a Word, "The LAW doth in <HI>Defect</HI> of a particular Ap∣pointment, make the <HI>Founder</HI> Visitor. If HE is silent during his own Time, the Right will descend to his HEIRS.</Q> Thus <HI>Holt</HI> on Visitors. And after him what Need of further Evidence.</P>
<P>And now the only remaining Question is, "Whether the Court who founded Harvard College <HI>ever did</HI> appoint a Visitor to it? If not; Then from all these Authorities, this Right will descend to every <HI>succeeding</HI> Assembly <HI>as</HI> Heir. And that College <HI>cannot</HI> BE without the Court as Visitors" yea GREAT <HI>and</HI> GENERAL as the COURT <HI>is,</HI> yet in all Humility let it be said that <Q>it is not <HI>at the Pleasure</HI> of that Court whether they <HI>shall be</HI> Visitors or not</Q>—for in this Case the Court is <Q>Visitor of <HI>Necessi∣ty</HI> by Law.</Q> But that the Court never appointed any Visitor, appears from the Laws of 42 and 50 which are the <HI>only</HI> Laws in which 'twas ever pretended that Visitors were appointed. The Name <HI>Vi∣sitor</HI> or the Terms <HI>Visitation, Visitatorial</HI> &amp;c. do not once occur in these Laws. Now <HI>Ayliff</HI> (Page 74. 5)
<PB N="36" REF="005041_0035_10168DB45A4BAC98"/>makes it so necessary for "a Visitor to be <HI>appointed</HI> and <HI>named</HI> such by the Founder in <HI>express</HI> Terms" that he even labours to prove that <Q>by the Description of such a Power given to any Persons they are cre∣ated Visitors, whether expresly <HI>stiled</HI> such in the Founder's Statutes or not. Because otherwise, says he, the giving such a Power would be vain and the Clause useless</Q> since none therefore are stiled or appoin∣ted Visitors by <HI>Name</HI> in these Laws, let the Powers <HI>granted</HI> in them be considered and compared with that of Visitation as described by <HI>Ayliff</HI> and chief Justice <HI>Holt.</HI> To begin then with the Law of 42 which appointed Overseers to Harvard College <HI>before</HI> it was incorporated. And here 1. Visitors are <HI>not</HI> the stated Legislative or executive Power of a College; but are appointed by the Founder to see that those, who are such, do their Duty. But by the Law of 42, <HI>before</HI> there was a Corporation, the Overseers themselves were the <HI>only</HI> stated and ordinary Power to make Laws and Orders for the College. By this then they are not described as having a Power of Visitation, nor would the <HI>Power</HI> given them to make Laws and Orders <HI>be vain</HI> and <HI>the Clause useless</HI> though they were not Visitors—Unless that College was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be governed without any Laws and Orders at all! 2. Visitors are Independet and <HI>Sovereign</HI> in all Cases where they are Visitors at all. Thus on Appeals they are the <HI>dernier</HI> Resort, <Q>Who shall judge them? —Let their Sentence be <HI>right or wrong,</HI> the Party is <HI>concluded</HI> by it</Q> says <HI>Holt</HI> on Visitors. But by the Law of 42 the Overseers in all Cases of Appeals whatever, made from a Meeting of their Number that was not General <HI>to</HI> a General Meeting of their whole Number, could conclude <HI>Nothing</HI> against an Apel∣lant! For if they did not <HI>reverse</HI> former Judgment, the Party was so far from being <HI>concluded</HI> by i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that the Overseers themselves were to <HI>stand accountable</HI> to the General Court for it; But a standing Power over VISITORS to call them <HI>to Account</HI> for their Conduct, and that in the most <HI>ordinary</HI> Cases that could come before them, is such a <HI>Paradox</HI> as was never heard of in the World! Appeals lie from our infe∣rior Courts to the Superior; but even <HI>Inferior</HI> Courts stand not <HI>accountable</HI> to the Superior for their Acts. 'Tis therefore <HI>doubly</HI> absurd and impossible that the Overseers should be Visitors on this Law. But 3. The great <HI>Business</HI> of a Visitor, and the main <HI>End</HI> of his Power, is to see that the Charity of the Founder is not perverted says <HI>Ayliff</HI> Page 77. <Q>To prevent all perverting the Charity there is by Law a visitatorial Power</Q> says <HI>Holt</HI> on Visitors. But by the Law of 42 the Overseers were the <HI>very</HI> Persons who were betru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted with the College-Stock and all Donations to it; so that 'till it can be shewn that this Law appoints them "on their perverting the Charity" to visit <HI>themselves,</HI> to set in Judgment <HI>upon themselves</HI> for so doing, 'tis to <HI>No</HI> Purpose to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them this Law appoints them Visi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 4. All Power given the Overseers in the Law of 42 (whether respecting the College-Stock or the making Statutes Orders or Constitutions for the College) was <HI>abrogated</HI> a few Years after, by the Charter of 50; as has been demonstrated (Page 16, 17. of this Paper) both from the Nature of an incorporating Act, end from the express Declaration of the General Court that <Q>the FIRST Foundation of that College and the <HI>Govern∣ment</HI> thereof had its ORIGINAL from the Act of 50.</Q> So then from the Year 1650 the Overseers were so far from being Visitors by the Act of 42, that on that Act they could neither be <HI>Visitors</HI> or <HI>Vi∣sited</HI> on ANY Foundation at all! But 5. <HI>supposing</HI> the Charter of 50 did not <HI>wholly</HI> supersede the Act of 42; yet the Argument <HI>Ex Abundanti,</HI> Page 19. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seq.</HI> of this Paper, may be urged as strongly against a Power of Visitation in the Overseers, as it may against <HI>any other</HI> Power of Importance granted to them in this Act; For the Charter of 50 comes <HI>after</HI> this Act, and leaves NO Powers of Importance in it: but vests them in the General Assembly of <HI>all the Overseers and Society!</HI> —And now what a VAIN Attempt would it be in any Persons to struggle through such a SERIES <HI>of Impossibilities</HI> in order to settle a Power of Visitation on such a Law? And yet there is <HI>another</HI> Difficulty behind, that would make the Attempt (if possible) still <HI>more</HI> vain: And that is, that in <HI>common Law,</HI> "Visitors pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p∣pose "a <HI>Corporation!</HI> The Power of Visitation exists consequent <HI>on</HI> and not prior <HI>to</HI> the Act that in∣corpora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> a College. Hear the following Authorities on this Point. The very <HI>Definition</HI> of a Visitor in the common Law-Dictionaries (as in <HI>Jacob</HI>'s) is "an Inspector of the Government of a Corporation." But where was there a Corporation in 1642 for the Overseers to Inspect? Or where, in the Law of 42, is there a Syllable that stands in View to any <HI>Future</HI> Corporation, for the Overseers or for <HI>Any one else</HI> to in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pect? None at all. The Overseers then by that Law were not Visitors even <HI>in Habitu <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tenti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> any more than in <HI>Act.</HI> And thus the last Shift, that would betake itself to the very <HI>Ja<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gon</HI> of the School<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en for a Support, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in this Case precluded. From what Dr. <HI>Ayliff</HI> says also (Page 77.) 'Tis as plain as Words can make it, that Visitors presuppose a Corporation <HI>actually</HI> existing <Q>Where those, says he, who are to receive the Charity of the Founder [as the Overseers <HI>did</HI> in 42] are NOT
<PB N="37" REF="005041_0036_10168DB5EA1A4A30"/>incorporated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but Trustees are appointed, there is then NO visitatorial Power; <HI>Because</HI> the Interest of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> is not vested in them. But <HI>when</HI> they are incorporated <HI>then,</HI> to prevent all perverting the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, the <HI>Law</HI> establishes a visitatorial Power.</Q> This was exactly the Case of Harvard Col∣lege <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Charity of its Founder. For by the Law of 42 the Overseers were only <Q>to dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>er and manage to the Use and Behoof of the College and its Members [and <HI>not</HI> to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Overseers] all Gift, Legacies &amp;c made TO the said College.</Q> Thus by this Act they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Trustees of the Charity. But how different is the Stile of the incorporating Act of 50 <Q>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>dent and Fellows by that Name shall and may purc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d acquire to THEMSELVES [here is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Property</HI>] or receive upon free Gift and Donation any Lands.—And Goods and Sums of Money— <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the Use and Behoof of said <HI>Pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> and Fellows</HI> [as well as] Scholars of said College.</Q> Here is Property apain; and <HI>the Interest of the Revenue,</HI> in all Senses of the Phrase is here and elsewhere by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>vested in them</HI> as a Corporation. So then <HI>before</HI> the incorporating Act of 50 there was NO visitatorial Power over Harvard College, <HI>because</HI> the Interest of the Revenue was not vested in a Corporation. The Doctor repeats this over again page 87. Adn says <HI>absolutely</HI> (without Respect to <HI>Trustees</HI>) that <Q>where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Persons are NOT incorporated there is NO visitatorial Power, <HI>Because</HI> the Interest of the Revenue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot vested in them.</Q> And all this is confirmed by Chief Justice <HI>Holt</HI> who (Tit. <HI>Visitors</HI>) asserts in such a Case where <HI>none</HI> are incorporated <Q>There is NO visitatorial Power <HI>Because</HI> the Interest of the Revenue is not vested in them. But <HI>where</HI> they are incorporated <HI>there</HI> to prevent all perverting the Charity there is by <HI>Law</HI> a visitatorial Power.</Q> This Power then has no BEING 'till a College is incorporated; and therefore <HI>could</HI> NOT BE in the Law of 42 which was made eight Years before the incorporating Harvard College. Adn thus so great an Authority as HOLT has decided the Case <HI>for ever</HI> against the Teaching Elders as being NO Visitors upon that Act. FINIS <HI>to the Law of</HI> 42.</P>
<P>Pass <HI>We</HI> n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w to the incorporating Act of 50. But this Act also describes no Power of Visitation. And particularly it does not describe the Overseers as the Visitors. All the Power given them in this Law is a Power to <HI>Councel</HI> the Corporation of act, or to <HI>Consent</HI> to their Acts: Which is a Power that cannot act <HI>at all</HI> but only councel <HI>Others</HI> to act (at whose Pleasure it still lies whether they will <HI>take</HI> such Councel—) or else at farthest 'tis a Power that cannot act <HI>without</HI> the Corporation and so can effect nothing of <HI>itself.</HI> This is so f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r from being a Description of a Power of Visitation, which is independent and SOVEREIGN, that 'tis <HI>directly</HI> the Description of a Power that is <HI>not such.</HI> 'Tis a Power also that is <HI>ordinary</HI> and relates only to the consenting to and so <HI>compleating</HI> the Laws and Orders made by the Corporation. But 'tis the <HI>Right</HI> and proper <HI>Office</HI> of a Visitor when College Laws and Orders, that have been made and <HI>compleated,</HI> are found hurtful to the Society or its Members, Then to interpose and RESCIND them BY and OF HIMSELF. Now there is not a Syllable in the Charter that gives the Overseers a Power thus to interpose and <HI>Rescind</HI> One such College Law or Order—let it be found <HI>ever</HI> so hurtful. "<HI>They then are</HI> NOT <HI>the VISITORS of Harvard College by Charter" Q. E. D.</HI>— Hence then the Overseers of that College, Honourable and Reverend as they <HI>are</HI> on OTHER Accounts, yet it must be said that they are NOT to be <HI>Honoured</HI> or <HI>Revered</HI> as VISITORS. Nor <HI>Can</HI> they have a Right to turn out Members of that Corporation! An Attempt to do such an Act, as appears from all the Premises, would be <HI>in Effect</HI> (though <HI>far</HI> from such Intention) as Attempt to <HI>null</HI> the Charter— to <HI>dissolve</HI> the Corporation—to bring on a universal <HI>Dissipation</HI> of its Treasury—and thereon Mr. HOL∣LIS' Donations is <HI>particular</HI> must on the very Conditions on which they were received, be <HI>returned</HI> back to England again! This requires the <HI>serious</HI> Consideration of ALL Persons who have any <HI>Concern</HI> for that College.—But to go on. If any a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e described as Visitors, in the Charter, 'Tis <Q>the ge∣neral Assembly of <HI>All the</HI> OVERSEERS <HI>and</HI> SOCIETY in great and difficult Cases, and in Cases of Non-Agreement, in all which Cases the <HI>Conclusion</HI> shall be made BY the Major Part [of the Cor∣poration] the Overseers <HI>consenting</HI> thereunto.</Q> But this also is no Description of a Power of Visi∣tation in them; for great and difficult Cases and Cases of Non-Agreement may happen to the <HI>stated</HI> Legislative and executive Power of a College, in making and executing Laws, <HI>as truly</HI> as to Visitors. This Clause then describes nothing <HI>peculiar</HI> to a Visitor, but only what is <HI>common</HI> to a Visitor and to others that are <HI>not</HI> such; and so contains no Description of a Power of Visitation <HI>at all.</HI> The plain Sense of the Clause is only this: that <Q>the stated Legislative and executive Power of that Col∣lege, who by Charter are the Overseers and Corporation, are not to determine such important Cases
<PB N="38" REF="005041_0037_10168DB8ECC31F28"/>(and 'tis fitting they <HI>should</HI> not!) as they <HI>may</HI> do <HI>small</HI> and <HI>common</HI> Cases at a Meeting that is <HI>not</HI> General, but are to do it at a full and general Meeting of <HI>All</HI> their Number.</Q> This alters not the <HI>Capacity</HI> in which they are to act in full and general Meeting on such Cases; but leaves them <HI>still,</HI> what they were <HI>before,</HI> the Legislative and executive Power only. If it had <HI>altered</HI> their Capacity, so as to make them Visitors—What Absurdities would follow! For <HI>ever</HI> WHOM would it make them Visitors? Why over the <HI>whole</HI> stated Legislative and Executive Power of the College (for so are ALL Visitors of Colleges!) And thus the WHOLE Legislative and executive Power of that College would be Visitors of the WHOLE Legislative and Executive Power of that College—<HI>Wholly</HI> Visitors and <HI>Wholly</HI> to be visited by <HI>themselves.</HI> And so their WHOLE Number to set upon and give Sentence for (or <HI>against</HI>) their WHOLE Number. Such Absurdities are too gross to need any Refutation. Let <HI>One</HI> Consequence of so absurd an Interpretation of the Charter be mentioned: The only Ground on which <HI>Ayliff</HI> (and even <HI>Holt!</HI>) argues that a Power of Visitation will exist of Necessity by Law, is, that they Charity might not be perverted by the incorporated, who have it in their Hands. Now sup∣pose (what the very End of a visitatorial Power <HI>obliges</HI> us to suppose <HI>may</HI> happen) that so great and diffi∣cult a Case <HI>Should</HI> happen, as that the Corporation should embezzle the College-Stock or pervert if from its devoted Uses;—How could this Mischief be prevented! Or how would it be <HI>possible</HI> to call the Corporation to an Account for it! When in this very Case and by this very Clause of the Char∣ter (if the Corporation with the Overseers <HI>were</HI> Visitors) the Conclusion must be made by the Corpo∣ration <HI>itself;</HI> and hereon the <HI>more</HI> they embezzled the College-Stock (and so the more they <HI>needed</HI> to be visited!) the <HI>less likely</HI> they would be to make the Conclusion that they <HI>should be</HI> visited for it—or with the Overseers to sit in Judgment <HI>upon themselves</HI> for so doing—unless it were for this <HI>fatal</HI> Purposs, viz. To vote themselves <HI>innocent,</HI> and so come off Triumphant! For what could be done in such a Case? None of <HI>these</HI> Visitors could, BY Charter, make the <HI>Conclusion</HI> (for the Overseers to <HI>consent</HI> to) but the Corporation. So that if they should be <HI>hardy</HI> enough to make such a Conclusion (and <HI>stand by it!</HI>) They could go on to make Waste of the College-Stock, and defy the whole Number of the Honourable and Reverend Overseers to do <HI>their Worst.</HI> Thus the very <HI>End</HI> for which the Law appoints a Power of Visitation would be <HI>destroyed,</HI> if this Clause in the Charter was to be <HI>taken</HI> as describing such a Power given to the Corporation and Overseers. 'Tis Time then to give up this Sense of the Clause and with it ALL Thoughts of finding a Power of Visitation described in the Char∣ter: since this, which comes nearest to the Description of such a Power, is not and <HI>cannot</HI> be a Descrip∣tion of it.</P>
<P>And thus it appears, after a thorough Examination, that there is NO Law in which the Founder of this College conveyed this Right of visiting the same, <HI>away</HI> to others. And then this Right (<HI>which</HI> MUST <HI>exist somewhere!</HI>) Can exist in <HI>None</HI> but the <HI>Founder</HI> and his Heirs; That is, according to chief Justice <HI>Holt,</HI> the COURT in this Case is <HI>Visitor of</HI> NECESSITY <HI>by Law!</HI> —Thus it is in all Colleges in <HI>England,</HI> when the Founder appoints <HI>no</HI> Visitor. Two Instances of this, in <HI>Ayliff,</HI> are remarka∣ble. The one is <HI>Lincoln College</HI> <Q>The Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> says <HI>Ayliff,</HI> is Visitor of this College, only of <HI>common Right;</HI> and <HI>not</HI> by any particular Appointment of the Founder.</Q> 'Twas founded by <HI>R. Fleming</HI> Bishop of <HI>Lincoln</HI> before the Reformation; who could have no Heir by <HI>Descent,</HI> in those Times of <HI>enjoined</HI> Celibacy; Nor did he vest this Right in another.—<HI>Yet</HI> it died not with him—nor devolved to the <HI>Crown</HI>—Nor to the <HI>Church</HI> in common—Nor to the <HI>University</HI>—But because the Founder lived and died <HI>"Bishop of Lincoln"</HI> This Right descended to his Successors in that <HI>Sec.</HI> Such a necessary Existence has this Right (<HI>independent</HI> on the Appointment of the Founder) and so in∣separable is it from HEIRSHIP that, unless the Founder make the Separation by his own Act, if there be no <HI>other</HI> Heir but a spiritual Heir, it falls to him of <HI>common Right.</HI> Another Instance is <HI>Christ Church College,</HI> one of the most famous in the University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> founded by King <HI>Henry</HI> 8th after the Impeachment of Cardinal <HI>Woolsey</HI> who began it. <Q>This College, says <HI>Ayliff,</HI> is visited only by the King and Queen in <HI>Person</HI> or by their <HI>Commission.</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> 8th on his new Institution thereof having left or appointed <HI>No</HI> special Visitor by <HI>Any</HI> Statute; The CROWN as Heir in VISITOR; which some have deemed a Happiness.</Q> In a like Case therefore on the NEW Institution of Har∣vard College by the Charter of 50 (<HI>after</HI> Overseers were appointed in 42) <Q>The COURT having lose
<PB N="39" REF="005041_0038_10168DBB11FF4108"/>or appointed No special Visitor by any Statute, the <HI>Legislature</HI> as Heir is VISITOR; which <HI>Some</HI> (and 'tis to be hoped that ALL the teaching Elders who are Overseers) have <HI>deemed</HI> a HAPPINESS.</Q>— And as to the <HI>Corporation</HI> of that College, what is left for the to do but to <HI>own</HI> and <HI>recognize</HI> the Right of their FOUNDER over them! Of the <HI>Founder,</HI> that <HI>Annual</HI> Benefactor, that <HI>Visitor,</HI> whom they have often treated with an Indignity that nothing could exceed but the Goodness and Patience <HI>even to Long∣suffering</HI> with which the Court have forborn to resent it in the severest Manner. What open Disrespect, for Instance, has been shown them by that Corporation at the publick Solemnity of a <HI>Commence∣ment.</HI> The Court when sitting ('tis <HI>true</HI>) have been invited to it; But when they came to the Place, ALL their Members but the <HI>Honourable</HI> Overseers have been left at Noon-Day to <HI>wander about</HI> the Yard and Entries of that College, and been obliged to get a common Dinner where they could <HI>Find</HI> one (or re∣turn Home <HI>fasting!</HI>) While an ample Entertainment has been going on for <HI>Other</HI> Guests WITHIN. These publick Affronts offered them by that Corporation, the Writer of this Paper has seen with his own Eyes and has blushed to see what he <HI>could not</HI> help; at the same Time that he has trembled at what might follow on their thus treating the LEGISLATURE! — A Legislature who gave them their BE∣ING at <HI>first;</HI> and by whose Bounty <HI>annually</HI> continued to them, they have <HI>Subsisted</HI> ever Since!</P>
<P>And now "who are the VISITORS of Harvard College" may appear to all Persons who may have just and important Occasion to apply to them. Nor can the Writer of this Paper think it <HI>foreign</HI> to the Subject, or <HI>unuseful</HI> to Harvard-College (or to <HI>any</HI> Persons concerned with it) to mention the <HI>pe∣culiar</HI> Business of a Visitor, and their Method of <HI>Procedure</HI> in Colleges abroad. <Q>A Visitor, says <HI>Ayliff,</HI> Page 95, in all his Enquiries and Determinations ought to proceed according to the meer Law and Rights of Nations, where Matters of necessary Substance and not positive Form are observed.</Q> Thus on Complaints made to Visitors <Q>There ought to be some Matter of Accusation in Writing gi∣ven to the Party accused, and a convenient Time assigned him for Answer, &amp;c. and so of other Matters to which we have a common and natural Right, not to be destroyed by any local or more general Or∣dinance or Statute whatever.</Q> Thus <HI>Ayliff</HI> on the Method of their Procedure. As to the peculiar Office of a Visitor, it primarily respects "the Revenues, the Possessions, the WHOLE Estate of a Col∣lege! The inspecting whereof is so essential a Part of this Office, that <HI>Ayliff</HI> and even chief Justice <HI>Holt</HI> often repeats it as the grand Reason why the Law appoints a Visitor <HI>at all,</HI> "It is not FITTING fays <HI>Ayliff,</HI> that Members endowed and who have Charity bestowed upon them should be <HI>Left</HI> to them∣selves." To apply this to the Corporation of Harvard College; the State of whose <HI>Treasury</HI> has-been kept in such mysterious Secrecy as if they had <HI>No</HI> Masters! As if <HI>None</HI> but themselves had any Business with their Treasury, or a <HI>Right</HI> even so much as to <HI>know</HI> what it consisted of—The Writer of this Paper has been for 10 or 12 Years a Member of that Corporation, and he cannot find by their Records that there has been a formal Visitation of their Treasury ever since the Times of the <HI>Revolu∣tion!</HI> By what he has heard, the <HI>Visitors</HI> of Colleges in <HI>England</HI> have a <HI>Register</HI> of the whole Estate of their respective Colleges; and all the <HI>Additions</HI> thereto from Time to Time, are entered into <HI>such</HI> Registers accordingly. And indeed how would it be <HI>possible</HI> for a Visitor to know whether the Chari∣ty was perverted or not (which is the primary <HI>End</HI> for which the Law appoints a Visitor) if the him∣self knew not what the Charity <HI>was,</HI> nor the particular <HI>Uses</HI> and <HI>Ends</HI> for which it was bestowed
<PB N="40" REF="005041_0039_10168DBDC74534C0"/>'Tis his Right to <HI>demand,</HI> and the indispensible Duty of a Corporation to give <HI>in</HI> such an Account; if they should refuse it, they would be guilty of the most audacious <HI>Contumacy</HI> and be proceeded against as REBELS <HI>to their</HI> VISITOR accordingly.—Whether and <HI>how far</HI> the Corporation of Harvard College have exhibited in to <HI>their</HI> Visitor such Accounts of their WHOLE Estate! What <HI>Lands</HI> and Tene∣ments, and what Monies and Goods it consists of; with the <HI>Value,</HI> the <HI>Income,</HI> and the several <HI>Uses</HI> of the particulars, the Writer of this Paper knows not—He never was <HI>privy</HI> to any such Thing— Nor of late Years is it <HI>extant</HI> as he can find upon their Records.—But on ONE Account 'tis of the last Importance that the <HI>Whole</HI> Estate of that College should be known. And that is, leaft by the <HI>continual</HI> Additions made thereto, it should at Length <HI>exceed</HI> the Value of 500 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> <HI>per Annum,</HI> which is the Limit set to it by Charter, and so the Charter itself be Forfeit! [The Charter puts it on the <HI>Value</HI> and not the <HI>actual</HI> Income of 500 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> <HI>per Annum.</HI> The Rule then is "What by <HI>common Esti∣mate</HI> the Value is, and <HI>not</HI> what the Corporation think <HI>fit</HI> to rent their Estate at"—And indeed they have sometimes rented that for 5 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> which without being better'd by Improvement they have the very next Year rented at 25 or 30 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> <HI>per Annum]</HI> Now how near <HI>already</HI> they have, by <HI>acquiring purchasing</HI> or <HI>receiving upon free Gift or Donation,</HI> opproached to the Limit of 500 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> <HI>per Annum</HI> (as Money passed in 1650) is highly needful to be ascertained. The <HI>Library</HI> itself is worth 8 or 10000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> The Lands and Tenements in <HI>Cambridge</HI> and the adjoining Towns may be valued at more than 200. <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> <HI>per Annum</HI> —Besides the three Buildings <HI>called Colleges,</HI> and the <HI>President's</HI> House, which have all been <HI>ac∣quired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> received</HI> on Donation long since the Charter of 50 was granted: If to these were added the Lands on which they stand. And the In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> of <HI>Charl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>Y—And one Half of the Town∣ship of <HI>Hopkintown</HI>—And <HI>Merriconeag</HI>—And the many <HI>other</HI> Lands and Tenements belonging to that College—with the <HI>Hollisian</HI> Donations of 300 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> or more <HI>per Annum</HI> —And the rich <HI>Apparatus</HI>—And all the INDIAN MONEY—And the Gifts of an honourable Family in <HI>Salem</HI> —And other numerous Donations formerly made—And that are continually making (three Gentlemen of <HI>Boston</HI> have lately by <HI>Will</HI> given more than 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and a <HI>Chappel</HI> is now given)—ALL these, or <HI>What</HI> of these can pro∣perly be valued <HI>at some</HI> Rate <HI>per Annum,</HI> may perhaps on Due Estimate be found to come very near the NE Plus <HI>Ultra</HI> fixed by Charter! And 'tis the proper Right and Office of their Visitor, by a frequent <HI>Inspection</HI> of the STATE <HI>of the</HI> COLLEGE-STOCK, to <HI>see</HI> that by the continual Additions made thereto, it does exceed <HI>that</HI> Limit—Least the Charter should be <HI>Forfeit.</HI></P>
<P>Another special Part of a Visitor's Office is "to receive Appeals and redress Grievances." Viz. when the Cases are <HI>important.</HI>" <Q>A Visitor, says <HI>Ayliff,</HI> is bound in Duty and Conscience to re∣ceive an Appeal <HI>provided</HI> it be not frivolous</Q> <Q>He has a <HI>standing</HI> Authority, says <HI>Holt</HI> on Visitors, at <HI>all Times</HI> to hear Complaints and redress Grievances—He has a POWER to hear [and therefore when he judges it <HI>needful</HI> he <HI>may</HI> hear] <HI>Any</HI> Difference and redress <HI>Any</HI> particular Injury at <HI>Any</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="005041_0040_10168DC1A4F230E0"/>Time.</Q> And now to make the Application of this to Harvard College—A Place where Grie∣vances and Injuries do so much abound. Exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lsions and even <HI>final</HI> Degradations, in <HI>many</HI> Cases, are Grievances, and great Grievances. The best Gentlemen's Sons in the Country are liable to be ex∣pelled and so to be RUINED unless they can have Redress by appealing to a Visitor. And this Re∣medy <HI>cannot</HI> be denied them! They have as much a Right to it as <HI>Visitors</HI> have to BE <HI>Visitors.</HI> — As to <HI>final</HI> Degradations; There is one peculiar Sort of it which is for no Crime <HI>at all.</HI> And that is the fixing Gentlemen's Sons (by a <HI>perpetual</HI> Degradation!) below their just Place in College <HI>Classes</HI> and then spreading it about the Country in <HI>printed</HI> Catalogues. Of this there often have been Com∣plaints, and LOUD and JUST Complaints! The Writer of this Paper (who in Times past has been concerned in placing many a College <HI>Class</HI>) was so weary of the Injuries done to particular Persons herein, that he at Length freely and publickly told the President and Fellows that <Q>he could not in Conscience have any Thing to do with such Matters as they had been managed; it appearing to him that there was no RULE by which a <HI>Class</HI> could be placed, but what (on some View or other) was acted <HI>backward</HI> and <HI>forward</HI> upon, almost every Year—And sometimes in placing <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>same</HI> Class; And that if they <HI>insisted</HI> on his acting with them in this Affair, he must <HI>insist</HI> upon it to enter his Protest <HI>with Reasons</HI> and numerous <HI>Examples</HI> that he could produce; and would refe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the whole Matter to the Overseers and Corporation.</Q> On which his Brethren in the Govern∣ment of the College chose <HI>not to insist</HI> on his acting with them in this Article; and from that Time forward went on <HI>without</HI> him.—And indeed the Matter is <HI>flagrant.</HI> There is scarce a Family of Note in the Country but what have had Injustice done them on <HI>this</HI> Account. 'Tis but their look∣ing over the printed Catalogues and they may find where the Names of their abused <HI>Parents</HI> or abused <HI>Selves</HI> or abused <HI>Son<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> or <HI>Relatives</HI> stand for a publick and lasting Mark of Infamy on their Families. Even the Sons of Governours! And Sons of Councellours! <HI>After</HI> the Parents have been raised to these High Stations, are found placed <HI>beneath</HI> the Sons of those who were only teaching Elders. And the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are Gentlement (if it were decent to mention Names) that now have the Honour of sitting in the General Court who know this to be <HI>true.</HI> Some could say, for Instance, how their Class-Mate Mr. <HI>Solomon Otis</HI> was treated on this Account. With what Face can any Person vindicate so scandalous an Act as that of placing him below so many Sons of teaching Elders, and of others, in a publick <HI>printed</HI> Catalogue to be spread over the whole Land! 'Tis surprizing that such Numbers of Gentlemen in the Country, who have suffered these Indignities, can <HI>passively</HI> bear them without seeking Redress;—Or at <HI>least</HI> not enquire "Whether the Acts of the President and Fellows are <HI>Final</HI> in this Case? If these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entlemen will patiently bear such ignominious Treatment—The Writer of this Paper had almost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> "They WELL <HI>deserve</HI> to be thus treated." The Remedy is plain; The President and Fel∣low have <HI>not</HI> the full Power of placing such <HI>Classes.</HI> They of late Years have assumed it <HI>without</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="005041_0041_10168DC46BC016A8"/>Law and <HI>against</HI> Charter.—Perhaps the Practice was first <HI>settled</HI> on some of those <HI>temporary</HI> Charters, made since the <HI>Revolution,</HI> on which a new Course of Things obtained in that College (and among o∣ther Things) DEGREES were then given <HI>without</HI> the Consent of Overseers, as well as <HI>Classes</HI> placed with∣out <HI>such</HI> Consent.) But all these temporary Charters are long since <HI>extinct!</HI> And the Charter of 50 <HI>alone</HI> remains for the Governours of said College to act upon. And therefore there must be <HI>some</HI> Ground, <HI>some</HI> Foundation, in the Charter of 50, for Such a Power; unless it be <HI>Ex Toto</HI> arbitrary and illegal, and then 'tis high Time it should be <HI>demolished.</HI> But the only Clause in the Charter of 50, that <HI>can</HI> be the Ground of this Power, is that which enables the President &amp; Fellows "to make By-Laws and Orders, <HI>provided</HI> the said Orders be <HI>allowed</HI> by the Overseers" So that if there had been a By-Law approved by the Overseers that "The placing the Youth <HI>in</HI> their Classes, and <HI>in</HI> publick Catalogues, should be <HI>left</HI> with the Corporation (or President and Tutors—or President Professours and Tators, as <HI>Expulsions</HI> are) then their Doing this would have been <HI>Valid.</HI> But since there is no such By-Law <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>der, it necessarily follows from the Charter that the ORDERING <HI>the Places</HI> (or <HI>Precedency</HI>) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>'s Sons in a Class and publick Catalogue must, in <HI>every</HI> Act of it, receive the <HI>Consent</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s—<HI>as truly</HI> as every Act of giving the Youth their <HI>Degrees</HI> must receive <HI>such</HI> Consent."

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Writer of this Paper has gone through what he proposed; and presumes he has shown <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the <HI>Corporation</HI> and the <HI>Overseers</HI> of Harvard College as they stand in View to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Powers over that College still remain the GENERAL COURT.
