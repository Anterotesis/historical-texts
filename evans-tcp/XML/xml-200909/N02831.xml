<Q><BIBL><HI>II. CHRON. xxiv. 16.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And they buried him in the City of David among the Kings, because he had done good in Israel.—</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ALtho' the Person, to whose Depar∣ture, our <HI>Text</HI> hath Reference, sus∣tain'd a <HI>Sacred,</HI> &amp; the Person, whose Removal we this day lament, sus∣tain'd a <HI>Civil Character,</HI> yet the ground and reason of that Respect which was paid to <HI>his Remains,</HI> will afford proper Meditations on <HI>this</HI> mournful Occasion; which was, <HI>that he had done good in Israel.</HI> The man of God so honoura∣bly distinguished in his Sepulchre, was <HI>Jehoia∣da</HI> the High Priest; Venerable on the account of his Office: Prince and Primate in the Sa∣cred Order; who bore in his Breast-plate the <HI>Urim</HI> and the <HI>Thummim,</HI> Emblematical of light and perfection; who annually entred into
<PB N="2" REF="003379_0004_0FF82176E1E00EE0"/>the Holy of Holies, with blood, and made a∣tonement for the Sins of the People; and was a <HI>Type</HI> of Christ; and venerable on the ac∣count of the wisdom and excellent Spirit, which was in him; his eminency in his Office, and the great Service, which he did among his People: and our <HI>Text</HI> signifies the honour done him in his burial, and the reason of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The honour done him in his burial: They buried him in the City of David among the Kings:</HI> A singular honour this, that he should make his grave with the Princes and supream Ru∣lers of his People. <HI>David,</HI> when he was set∣tled in his Kingdom, took from the <HI>Jebusites,</HI> the strong hold of <HI>Zion,</HI> and call'd it after his own name; made it the place of his Resi∣dence, and the Seat of his Kingdom; in some part of which he was interr'd at his decease, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>King.</HI> 2.10. <HI>So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David;</HI> which afterward became the burying place of the Kings: for this is the account generally given concerning the Kings of <HI>Judah,</HI> that they slept with their fathers, and were buried <HI>in the City of David:</HI> And this was the honour done to <HI>Jehoiada</HI> when he died; they buried him in this City, and laid him among the Kings: an honour denied to some of the Kings, who had by their mismanagements, forfeited the Re∣gards due to their Character: It is Reported of <HI>Jehoram,</HI> that he departed without being desired: <HI>howbeit they buried him in the City of David, but not in the Sepulchres</HI> of the Kings,
<PB N="3" REF="003379_0005_0FF821A14E2B78D0"/>2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 21.20. and of that ungrateful and barbarous King <HI>Joash, that his Servants conspired against him, for the blood of the Sons of Jehoia∣da, and slew him on his bed, and he died, and they buried him in the City of David: but they buried him not in the Sepulchres of the Kings,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 24.25. which imports that they ac∣counted it a great honour to any one to have his Corpse lodg'd in them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The reason of it, because he had done good in Israel?</HI> By <HI>Israel</HI> here, is meant the King∣dom of <HI>Judah,</HI> as in 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 21.2. <HI>All these were the Sons of Jehoshaphat King of Israel;</HI> who was King of <HI>Judah,</HI> and not of <HI>Israel,</HI> when we speak of them in contradistinction: <HI>Had done good in Israel:</HI> This is a <HI>Meiosis,</HI> more is impli∣ed than express'd; for if he had only done some small Service, and in as small a degree, it might have been said, that he had done good in <HI>Israel;</HI> but this is far beneath' the lofty Intention of the expression, which is, that he had been E∣minently Serviceable, and had done very much good.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>That honour and respect is due, and ought to be paid, to the Remains and Memory of such as have been eminently Serviceable, and done much good among their People.</HI></P>
<P>Such are rich blessings while they live, and those whom God is pleased to honour, by furnishing of them, making them Eminent, and
<PB N="4" REF="003379_0006_0FF82178F43DC398"/>great and good Instruments, in his Providence, all men should honour and acknowledge; which is a clear dictate of natural reason, and strictly just; because exactly agreeable to the reasons and proportion of things. Such ought also to be honoured after their Decease, in such ways as the state of the matter gives room for.</P>
<P>Honour is due to all men on account of the Dignity of human nature, because man was made in the Image of God, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.17. <HI>Ho∣nour all men.</HI> A greater degree of honour is due unto rèligious, holy and vertous men; and by how much the more they excel in pie∣ty, and shine in vertue, by so much the grea∣ter Regard is due unto them, <HI>Psal.</HI> 15.4. <HI>He honoureth them that fear the Lord.</HI> But more especial honour still is due to them, who are placed on high, and bear Offices of distinction among Mankind, according to the degree of improvement and exaltation which they are advanced to, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.17. <HI>Honour the King.;</HI> and the greatest honour is due to them who are eminently Serviceable, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17. <HI>Let the El∣ders which rule well, be accounted worthy of dou∣ble honour, especially they who labour</HI> (more a∣bundantly, and exert themselves) <HI>in the word and doctrine;</HI> neither doth the obligation here∣unto cease, when their breath goeth forth; but honour is due to their remains and memo∣ry, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 16.13, 14. <HI>And Asa slept with his fathers, and they made a very great burning for him.</HI> This Doctrine may be considered in two Propositions.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003379_0007_0FF821A3060DDDA0"/>
PROP. I. <HI>Some men are eminently Servicea∣ble, and do much good among their People.</HI></P>
<P>There is not a greater diversity and contra∣riety in the World of things, than there is in the World of men. Some things are very hurtful and destructive to the nature of man, as the poison of Asps; some things are of the middle kind, and do neither good nor hurt; some are salubrious and very serviceable, nou∣rishing, strengthening, restorative, and com∣fortable.</P>
<P>So among <HI>men,</HI> some are very hurtful and pernicious, tyrannical and oppressive, deceit∣ful and unrighteous, turbulent and unpeacea∣ble, vicious and debauch'd; they are of little benefit to mankind, while they live; nor is it any loss to the world, when they die. They seem to be sent in Judgment, and are ta∣ken away in mercy; not to themselves, but to mankind. Others are as the Twilight, in the middle between good and evil, useful, and pernicious; they have a being upon the earth; but none are much oblig'd to them, neither have we any great complaint to advance a∣gainst them, they serve to swell the number of mankind, and this is well nigh all; that they are harmless &amp; inoffensive finisheth their Character.</P>
<P>Others exceed in their usefulness, and are rich Blessings in their day. God doth well furnish them, and well spirit them: and they are as the light of the morning, even a morn∣ing without Clouds, and as a clear shining af∣ter Rain: They expand their Beneficence as
<PB N="6" REF="003379_0008_0FF8217A879B9220"/>the rays of light, and men in every Order, Condition and Degree are the better for 'em; all men esteem and love them; because all men, at one time or other, are oblig'd and serv'd by them, and when cruel death doth forcibly take them away, all hearts are opprest with sorrow, and all eyes are full of tears, and are ready to look upon it, that a great part of their comfort is buried in the same grave. Such were <HI>David,</HI> and <HI>Jehoshaphat,</HI> and <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> and <HI>Josiah,</HI> among the Kings of <HI>Judah,</HI> and almost in every ge∣neration God. raiseth up, and bestows some such men.</P>
<P>We may expatiate a little and illustrate this in some instances.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Some do much good with their Estates.</HI> The God from whom doth come Riches, as well as Honour, doth honour them, in making 'em his <HI>Stewards</HI> of much worldly substance, and with all doth give them an heart to do good with their abundance: They are of a publick Spirit, and when there is opportunity, they discover a laudable generosity and openness of hand: It doth not suffice them to give to e∣every man his due, and to owe no man any thing but love; and to pay without grudging (which many do not) what the Support of the Publick doth require: but more∣over, they devise liberal things, and by libe∣ral things they stand; and are of the same publick and generous spirit with the Centuri∣on well respected among the <HI>Jews,</HI> because he loved their Nation, and built them a Syna∣gogue,
<PB N="7" REF="003379_0009_0FF8217C14765B88"/><HI>Luk.</HI> 7.5. When any matter is set <HI>for∣ward, which may be for God's Glory, the Inte∣rest</HI> of Religion, and the good of men, and re∣quireth money for the carrying on and per∣fecting of the same, you shall never find them opposing, declining, and drawing back; but always ready, forward, chearful, and rejoy∣cing at the opportunity.</P>
<P>They are also good to the poor; are touch∣ed with a sense of their indigencies, and <HI>ef∣fectively</HI> pity them: they don't eat their mor∣sel alone; and when they see the poor with∣out covering, they cause their loins to bless them: because they make them warm with the fleece of their sheep, and the blessing of such as were ready to perish doth come upon them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Some do great and good Service in the pub∣lick Stations, which they are exalted into.</HI> Pro∣vidence doth call them forth from a private to a publick Capacity, having antecedently fitted and qualified them therefor; and they do worthily, and become famous, in the wise and faithful attendance to, and discharge of the Trust, which they have received from God by men. If it be a civil Office which they sustain, that they bear Rule over men, they are just and rule in the fear of the Lord: when they sit upon the seat of Justice, they take heed what they do; because they account, and consider that they judge not for men, but for God. <Q><HI>That the power of judgment is God's Right, that the matter of Judgment is God's Cause,
<PB N="8" REF="003379_0010_0FF8217E38AEA690"/>and that the issue of Judgment is God's end;</HI></Q> and desire nothing more than that God would be with them in the Judgment; they are watch∣ful over themselves, that they be impartial, and do not decline after many to wrest Judgment; nor countenance a poor man in his cause; nor favour the great and the Rich, because they are so; neither do they bear the Sword in vain; but by the prudent execution of just Laws, they become <HI>a terror to them that do evil;</HI> and if the Sons of vice, and insolence will not otherwise be reclaimed, they use a just severity, and bring <HI>the wheel over the wic∣ked;</HI> nor are they less conscientious as to Re∣ligion and the Precepts of the first Table; they are a swift witness against the Prophane. against vain Swearers, Sabbath-breakers, and such as dare boldly affront the Majesty of Heaven; and they speak comfortably to those that teach the good knowledge of the Lord.</P>
<P>They are indued with wisdom, and a spirit of Government, and by the application of their Wisdom and Power, they keep all in peace and good order about them; they defend the Righteous, and protect the Innocent, and e∣very one sets under his own vine, and under his own fig-tree, socure in his just Rights, and enjoying the fruits of his own labours.</P>
<P>In like manner some in the sacred Imploy∣ment, do eminent Service for Christ, his Truth, and the Souls of men, and <HI>are the Chariots of Israel, and the Horsemen thereof:</HI> and others, who move in a lower sphere of publick Order,
<PB N="9" REF="003379_0011_0FF821A54AEBFD70"/>do much good in the worthy discharge of their Trust.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Some do great and good service by their counsel and advice.</HI> God gives unto them a wise and understanding heart, and they are well inclined to do good with their Talents. The Publick is much the better for that ex∣cellent Spirit of wisdom which is in them: when Emergencies arise; and dark clouds hang over the publick Affairs, they have a compre∣hensive discerning in the present juncture; and by their wisdom do direct unto that which doth extricate from the impending dif∣ficulties, and make all of a right spirit to re∣joyce in the happy issue, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 9.15. <HI>And he by his wisdom delivered the City.</HI> They also do much good by their Counsel and Advice more privately: their ability is known, and their integrity depended upon; they are much sought unto, and many appeal to them, as judges and arbiters of right and wrong, and by their wisdom and integrity, intitle them∣selves to the blessing of the Peace-maker.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Some do much good by their Example.</HI> They live a religious and exemplary life, worthy of imitation; and by their example have a good influence upon others. They are exemplary in their Families, walking in the midst of their houses in a perfect way; and hereby they have a good influence upon those that are under them, who insensibly fall into imitati∣on, and grow up into a likeness and conformi∣ty to Parents: They are patterns in their re∣gards
<PB N="10" REF="003379_0012_0FF80F74A59D3238"/>to Religion, things sacred and the house of God, constant and seasonable, decent and reverent in their attendance upon the publick Worship of God; and their general walk and conversation is both instructive and attractive: their speech is always with grace, seasoned with salt, good to the use of edifying, and apt to minister grace unto the hearers: they are patterns of truth, righteousness, fidelity, goodness, forgiveness, neighbourly kindness, and a tender conscience: the conscientious and vertuous see that in them, which they esteem, admire and would imitate; those who are o∣therwise, see that in them, which is some check and restraint upon them, that they dare not give the loose to their vicious inclinations as o∣therwise they would do: but their consciences are hereby somewhat assisted, and are a greater curb upon them; and some, are by what appears so good and amiable in them, allured to the choice and practice of Religion and Vertue themselves; <HI>are won by the good conversation of others,</HI> 1 Pet. 3.1, 5. <HI>Those are eminently ser∣viceable in whom all these are found happily united;</HI> in whom there is both ability &amp; goodness, who feed many with their Estates, and with their lips also, who are good in counsel, &amp; as good in Government, of a meek and moderate spi∣rit, and yet faithful in all that is committed to them, who have at heart the interest of Reli∣gion, practice it themselves, and in the best manner promote it in the places where they live; are hearty friends to the publick weal, and hearty well-wishers to all men.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="003379_0013_0FF821A78B139628"/>
O how rich blessings are such! and how hap∣py the people, who are favour'd with them! when any trouble doth begin to arise, they sea∣sonably obviate the same, lay the spirit of con∣tention, and quench the spark before it breaks out into a flame, and have so strong and ex∣tensive influence; that they maintain peace and truth, decency and good order, in their day.</P>
<P>Sometimes one such man will cause all things to go well in a place, and make a people hap∣py; will change the countenance of all Affairs among them, and bring all things into sweet and excellent order; will rectifie disorders, and meliorate the manners of a people, that stran∣gers, who come among them, shall observe and say, that there is much of a Reformation among them: one such man is so great a blessing, as few are sensible of 'till deprivation doth convince them.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>Honour and Respect is due, and ought to be paid to the Remains and Memory of such men.</HI></P>
<P>Death prevails over such as well as others: tho' they may sustain a Divine Character, and <HI>are Gods by Office;</HI> yet not in immutability; <HI>for they die like other men;</HI> tho' they are very useful, much needed, and can be very difficult∣ly spared; yet death is cruel and spares 'em not: for in the Grave are <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Counsel∣lors of the earth,</HI> as well as others, <HI>Job</HI> 3.14. and such, whether they come to their grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh
<PB N="12" REF="003379_0014_0FF82181A606E8B8"/>in, in his season; or, whether they are taken away in the midst of their capacity and use∣fulness, honour is due, and regard to be paid to the name and memory of such, after their spirits are removed, and they are no more con∣versant among us: and that so to do is de∣cent and fitting, just and grateful, appears to be a clear dictate of natural reason, and what hath been the tho't and practice of mankind generally; we shall not therefore labour in the demonstration of that which we presume all will readily acknowledge; but shall proceed to shew <HI>in what way,</HI> honour and respect ought to be paid unto such, and assign some <HI>Reasons</HI> of the Doctrine, which will invite into the Application.</P>
<P N="1">I. As to the first, <HI>some of the ways in which ho∣nour and respect ought to be paid unto such,</HI> are these which follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>By a suitable and honourable Burial.</HI> It is a practice, which hath obtain'd in the world, when persons die, to return back their Bodies, earth to earth as it was; and the light of rea∣son hath guided most, if not all nations, to pay some respect to persons of Distinction &amp; Cha∣racter, by some peculiar <HI>rites</HI> and <HI>ceremonies</HI> in their <HI>Obsequies;</HI> and it's decent that such should be honour'd in their Interment, according to the decent rites and customs, which have ob∣tain'd among their people.</P>
<P>Different modes of doing honour to the Ho∣nourable, have obtain'd in different Times and Countries. Among us we give honour to such, by Titles of Distinction, by uncovering of the
<PB N="13" REF="003379_0015_0FF821AA41F70958"/>head, by rising up before them, by bowing of the knee, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and it is equal and just that men of worth and improvement, have respect shewn them in such ways as are customary; and not to do it, is neglect and contempt; so likewise when they decease, honour'd they shou'd be in their burial. Thus they honour'd <HI>Jehoiada,</HI> by laying him among the Kings; and it was a custom in <HI>Israel</HI> to do honour to men of worth, by making odoriferous burnings for them. It is said concerning the good King <HI>Asa,</HI> that <HI>when he died they made a very great burning for him,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 16.14. and not to do this, was a token of neglect and disrespect; for it is said of that wicked King <HI>Jehoram,</HI> who departed without being desired, <HI>that his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 21.19.</P>
<P>This burning of sweet odours, was a signifi∣cation of respect, and an emblem of a good reputation, that they gladly were at cost to manifest their Regards to such a worthy per∣son, and that his name was sweet, &amp; as oint∣ment poured forth, which gives a delightful sensation to all that are near; and this may probably, let us into a right understanding of the wise man, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 7.1. <HI>A good name is bet∣ter than precious ointment, and the day of death than the day of ones birth:</HI> for when a man comes to die, it is better and more elegible, to leave a good name and reputation behind him, than to be honour'd with a great burning of sweet odours and costly perfumes.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="003379_0016_0FF821843664F510"/>
Another custom of respect to the worthy Deceased, was the erecting of Monuments over their graves; after <HI>Rachel</HI>'s death, <HI>Jacob</HI> erected a monument over her grave, which con∣tinued for a long time, <HI>Gen.</HI> 35.20. <HI>And Jacob set a Pillar upon her grave, which is the Pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.</HI> King <HI>David's</HI> Se∣pulchre remain'd in the Apostles day, <HI>Act.</HI> 2.29. <HI>Men and Brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the Patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his Sepulchre is with us unto this day.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>By lamenting and mourning for them, and attending the decent rites and customs thereof:</HI> As, where there is a just esteem of, and regard to worthy and useful persons, there will be deep sorrow and hearty mourning, when they are removed; so it is becoming, and a doing ho∣nour to such, that this should be made manifest in proper expressions, according to the lawful modes and customs of the time and place; both ancient and extensive hath been the usage of mourning Apparel; putting on of Sackcloth, and an attire significative of sorrow &amp; regard, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 14.2. <HI>Put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thy self with oyl, but be as a woman that hath a long time mourned for the dead.</HI> As <HI>Josiah</HI> was an excellent Prince, so, great and lasting was the mourning for him, 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 35.24, 25. <HI>And all Judah and Jerusalem</HI> (not his near Relati∣ons only, but all <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem</HI>) <HI>mourn∣ed for Josiah:</HI> And <HI>Jeremiah</HI> lamented for <HI>Josiah:</HI> and all the singing men and singing women spake of <HI>Josiah</HI> in their lamentations
<PB N="15" REF="003379_0017_0FF821ABD28D30F8"/>to this day, and made them an Ordinance in <HI>Israel:</HI> and, behold, they are written in the lamentations: the omission of which is an evi∣dence of disregard. <HI>Jer.</HI> 22.18, 19. <HI>Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah King of Judah, they shall not la∣ment for him, saying, Ah my Brother! or ah Sister! they shall not lament for him saying, Ah Lord! or ah his Glory! He shall be buried with the burial of an Ass &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>By acknowledging their worth, and speak∣ing forth their amiable qualities, and great and good Services.</HI> Praise is one of the just Re∣wards of vertue, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.8. <HI>and if there be any vertue, and if there be any praise.</HI> It is our du∣ty to bless God, and adore his infinite perfec∣tion, and praise his beneficence and goodness to his creatures: So we ought likewise to see and acknowledge the gifts and grace which he doth bestow upon men, &amp; give them the honour of their good Services, by a suitable acknow∣ledgment, <HI>Prov.</HI> 31.30. <HI>A woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.</HI></P>
<P>It is just and right that we do, in our minds esteem, and account of every man, according to the vertues and good qualities, which are manifest in him. If a man be truly eminent, and manifest himself by worthy actions to be so; not so to account of him, is unjust, and a with-holding of that which is his due; and as we ought thus inwardly to esteem good and deserving men; so it is but just to acknowledge it in words, &amp; speak it forth to their honour;
<PB N="16" REF="003379_0018_0FF82186633D7C00"/>and as this is a regard due unto them, while living; so it is an honour due to their name and memory, when they are dead; for it hath pleased the most High in his Wisdom to order upon record in his word, the excellent spirit, and great and good Services of many eminent and holy men in this way. The Righteous should be had in lasting remembrance; and we should bless the name of the Just: This is to embalm them indeed, and better than the most costly &amp; the most precious Aromatick burning.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>By shewing a proper regard unto theirs, whom they leave behind them.</HI> A man who is service∣able and honourable, respect is due to <HI>his</HI> up∣on his account; and every man esteemeth that which is done to his Children, as done to him∣self. It is natural to every man to desire, that his Children may be esteem'd, lov'd, and re∣spected in the World, and a dying man can∣not but desire this for this Children when he hath left them; and a paying of respect to his nearest Relations whom he leaves behind, is gratitude, &amp; a doing honour to the departed.</P>
<P><HI>Jonathan</HI> begs this favour of <HI>David,</HI> 1 Sam. 20.14, 15. <HI>And thou shalt not only, while yet I live, shew me the kindness of the Lord, that I die not; but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no not when the Lord hath cut off the enemies of David, every one from the face of the earth:</HI> And <HI>David</HI> did accord∣ingly: When he came to be settled in the Kingdom, he made inquiry, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 9.1. <HI>And David said, is there yet any that is left of the
<PB N="17" REF="003379_0019_0FF821AE2579AC78"/>house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?</HI> And when <HI>Mephibosheth</HI> was found &amp; brought, how kindly doth he receive him? <HI>v.</HI> 6, 7. <HI>And David said, Mephibosheth, &amp; he answered, behold thy servant, and David said unto him, Fear not, for I will surely shew thee kindness, for Jonathan thy fathers sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father, and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.</HI> It was a part of the dying charge of <HI>David,</HI> to <HI>Solomon</HI> his Son and Successor, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 2.7. <HI>But shew kind∣ness to the Sons of Barzillar the Gileadite:</HI> And it is laid as a perpetual infamy &amp; reproach upon the children of <HI>Israel, that they did not shew kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely Gi∣deon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel,</HI> Judg. 8. ult.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>By following of their Example, and imi∣tating what was excellent and worthy in them.</HI> Imitating and copying after another is an ex∣pression of esteem: we are inclin'd to copy af∣ter those whom we esteem considerable; and think, that we serve and recommend our selves in doing so: and therefore, hereby we honour them; for honour is an inward esteem, made manifest externally by significant expressions, whether in word or action. We glorify God by the transcript of his moral perfections into our hearts and lives; and this is one of the ways in which it is our duty to honour him: and in this way we should do honour to the name and memory of those who have done good in <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="003379_0020_0FF821886342CB60"/>
The good spirit which was in them we should covet and labour for: the piety and vertue, the truth and goodness, the kindness and libe∣rality, the faithfulness &amp; publick spirit, which shew'd forth themselves in them, we should think of, for our own direction and quickning. Were they exemplary in their regards to things sacred? this should be a motive to us to be so too: were they regular and vertuous in their conversation? we should aim to be like them: were they kind and neighbourly, affable and courteous to all? we should think hereupon, and say within our selves, such will we endea∣vour to be: were they always forward to ap∣pear against sin &amp; disorder, and bear their testimony against evil, according to their place? it should be our resolution, that we will do the same thing: did they always discover a readi∣ness to promote that which might be for the publick interest and good? we should determine within our selves, that we will be like them in this: were they always for peace? let it be our hearts desire and purpose that if it be possible we will live peaceably with all men, and be in∣strumental unto love and peace, as much as in us lieth: so shall we honour the dead who were good &amp; exemplary while they liv'd.</P>
<P N="2">II. As to the <HI>Reasons</HI> of the Doctrine, we may offer as followeth.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Not that it is any benefit to them who are departed.</HI> What we do in this World hath no influence, as to those who are departed into the world of spirits. Manifesting esteem &amp; regard
<PB N="19" REF="003379_0021_0FF862E6E8DCF000"/>may be of advantage to such, when alive; may be an encouragement to them in their duty and work; may be a quickning to them to exert themselves, that they may be more abundantly serviceable: and doubtless, it is sometimes of service to publick men, to know that their ser∣vice is well accepted, and that they have an interest in the esteem of their people, when they are well ballanced, and have grace to make a right improvement of it; but the doing honour to their name is of no service directly to them who are departed. The great &amp; good departed, need not any farther service of ours; they hear not our commendations; they are exalted above our praises; neither can our <HI>enco∣miums</HI> augment their beatitude.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is in it self just and right.</HI> There is a certain dependance of things one upon another, and references and relations of things one unto another, which is the foundation of just and right. Such a being as man, a creature endow∣ed with such powers, situate in such relation to, and dependance upon, the only uncreated and eternal mind, it is in it self just and right, that he should think of, be affected and act toward God according to <HI>his</HI> nature and perfections; and his own relation to, and dependance upon Him: and such is the relation of men one un∣to another, as that it is in it self just &amp; right, that every man should enjoy what is his own, his life, reputation, worldly possessions, without infringement or molestation; so it is in its self just and right, that respect should be paid to
<PB N="20" REF="003379_0022_0FF8218A1F5ADEE8"/>them who have been useful and serviceable; tho' they being now placed at such a distance from us, can receive no benefit by it; for this is no reasonable objection against the equity of the thing: for it is just and right, and our bounden duty, to honour and glorify God, tho' he be exalted above all blessing and praise, nor can we be profitable to Him.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It may be profitable to the Living:</HI> And by means of the living, the dead may yet speak, and be an occasion of good after they are laid in their graves.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It may be some support and comfort to be∣reaved and mourning Relations.</HI> It must needs be some alleviation of their grief, and lightning of their burden, to find that their dear rela∣tive, whom death hath separated from them, had a good interest in the esteem and love of others; and to observe that many do feelingly condole in their loss and sorrow.</P>
<P N="2">2 It may be profitable to others, as it may be <HI>a motive and an incentive to goodness and use∣fulness.</HI> A thirst and desire to be well tho't of, both while living, and when dead, is natural. For no man of tho't and sense, is willing that his name should be utterly forgotten: men would be remembred, which is one cause of their desire to children, that since they are mortal in their own persons, they may obtain a kind of immortality in their descendents; and hence men of no religion will engage in, and vigorously prosecute great &amp; worthy enterpri∣zes; yea, sacrifice their lives in the service of
<PB N="21" REF="003379_0023_0FF821B0388EAEF8"/>their Country, that they may (as the phrase is) die in the bed of honour; that their names may live, &amp; be renowned when they them∣selves are not: nor is this a meer <HI>Chimera,</HI> and vanity; tho' it must be acknowledged as of small value and light, when laid in the bal∣lance against the better blessings of the Eter∣nal World; for it is mention'd in holy Writ as one of the rewards of goodness, <HI>Prov.</HI> 10.7. <HI>The Memory of the just is blessed.</HI> Now the paying of respect, and doing honour to pious &amp; use∣ful men, when they are gone, evidently sets before the living the way of honour, and how they must live and improve themselves, as they would be respectfully mention'd, when they shall be no more seen among the living.</P>
<P>USE I. <HI>Hence learn that there is little regard, after their departure, due to those who have been vicious in their lives, and have done little service among mankind.</HI> Tho' they have been bad, yet humanity doth require that they be put into the ground; but, as there is but little respect due unto them while they live, so there is as little when they come to die, it is just &amp; best that they should pass off in silence, and that little should be said of them: barbarous it seems to rake in their dust, &amp; to blaze their reproach, when they are gone to receive the just deserts of an ill-spent life; and there is little good to be said of them, and therefore it's best that they should lie in silence; and agreeably the wicked are threatned in <HI>Prov.</HI> 10.7. <HI>The name
<PB N="22" REF="003379_0024_0FF8218BDB1DD948"/>of the wicked shall rot;</HI> and it is best that it should be so: Some are so very vicious and wicked, pernicious and hurtful in their lives, as that, when they are gone, it's pity their name should be mention'd any more, except in way of admonition and caution; it would be well, if such bad examples, might be utter∣ly forgotten; and therefore when such die, there is commonly much silence as they are carried to the place of silence; when good and useful men die, every one is speaking in their praise and commendation; but when the wick∣ed die, there is silence, and men return from their grave as those who are ashamed.</P>
<P>USE II. <HI>Hence we may be instructed that to reproach and vilifie such worthy men, when they are dead; or any ways to treat ill</HI> theirs, <HI>whom they have left behind, is highly criminal and faulty, ingratitude and baseness:</HI> Of which we are presented with a sad instance in our <HI>Context: Jehoiada</HI> was an excellent man; had done great service in <HI>Israel,</HI> and had done abundance for King <HI>Joash;</HI> he and his wife had sav'd him from death, from the hands of that wicked woman <HI>Athaliah,</HI> who destroyed all the seed Royal of the house of <HI>Judah</HI> be∣side, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould have murdered him, if she could have come at him; but they kept him hid in the house of God six years, and then <HI>Je∣hoiada</HI> made an interest for him, and strength∣ned himself, and set <HI>Joash</HI> upon the throne, and was a father, &amp; an excellent guide &amp; coun∣seller
<PB N="23" REF="003379_0025_0FF821B2501BC398"/>to him to his dying day: and what was the gratitude of <HI>Joash</HI> to <HI>Jehoida</HI> after his death? He was so barbarous and base, that he slew his Sons, tho' they were his near kins∣men; he forsook the Lord, &amp; thus requited his benefactor.</P>
<P>But how did he prosper? accordingly the Judgments of God followed him; his enemies came upon him, &amp; prevail'd against him; sore Diseases seiz'd upon his body; &amp; his own Servants had such an abhorrence of his ingra∣titude &amp; barbarity, that they conspired against him &amp; slew him; and the people had such a detestation of him, that they would not suffer him to be buried in the Sepulchres of the Kings: and this is written for admonition and warning.</P>
<P>USE III. <HI>Let this be an argument and motive to us, to do all the good and service in the world that possibly we can.</HI> Let us live Religi∣on, as well as profess it, and be concerned for the things of CHRIST JESUS; let us be solicitous for the publick weal, and seek the welfare of our <HI>Israel</HI> all the days of our lives; let us be subject to those above us, and good to those about us; faithful in our families, and exemplary in our lives.</P>
<P>This will procure us an honourable remem∣brance when we are gone, and give us a name in some respects better than the name of Sons and of Daughters; will give us a lasting name that shall not soon be cut off; and thus
<PB N="24" REF="003379_0026_0FF8218F09D78418"/>it will be in corrupt and degenerate
times; It was not a very good time in <HI>Israel</HI> when <HI>Jehoiada</HI> died;
yet what Honour was put upon him. There was not much true godliness in
<HI>Josiah</HI>'s day; yet how greatly was his Death lamented. It was a corrupt time
in the days of <HI>Jeroboam;</HI> yet when <HI>Abijah</HI> his Son died, all
<HI>Israel</HI> mourned for him, and buried him, <HI>Because there was found in him
some good thing toward the Lord God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam,</HI> 1
Kings, 14.13.</P>
<P>Consider we also, that if we, from a right Principle and sincerely, live thus, this will re∣commend us to God's approbation, who, as he is Goodness it self, and abundant in goodness and truth, so he delights in those who are good and do good. This also will give us in∣ward Peace, sweet Reflections, and cordial Supports and Views, in a dying hour, if then with <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> we have the Testimony of our Consciences, that we have walk'd before the Lord in truth, and with a perfect Heart, and have done that which is good in his sight: this also, of Grace, will intitle to glorious re∣wards in the Eternal World.</P>
<P>USE IV. Of Exhortation, <HI>To pay all due Ho∣nour and Respect to the Remains and Memory of such as have been serviceable, and have done good in Israel.</HI> These, when Providence doth re∣move them, are not suddenly to be forgotten, or their names be suffered to sink into oblivion; which directly leads to speak of that worthy
<PB N="25" REF="003379_0027_0FF821B3DCD8A4C0"/>and useful Man,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John Hall, <ABBR><HI>Esq</HI></ABBR></NOTE> whose removal from us hath given occasion to these Meditations: I am well aware that Funeral Sermons are too often stuff'd with Flatteries; but there is not such danger of this, when the Person lamented, was eminent, &amp; eminently serviceable, which is the present case, as you yourselves know: to pass over such a man in silence, would be great in∣justice; wherefore Men and Brethren, let me freely speak unto you of this Honourable Counseller, and Just Judge, who is now both Dead and Buried and his Grave is with us.</P>
<P>If we look to his déscent, he was born of credible and worthy Parents, who approv'd themselves well in their day; and having serv'd God and their generation by his Will in a various capacity, are fallen asleep.</P>
<P>If we consider him in his Natural abilities, the Father of lights, from whom cometh down every good and perfect gift, had well furnish∣ed him; of which there needs no other evi∣dence, than his rising to be so considerable under so small advantages: He had a large understanding, a singular discretion, and a good temper; But yet, when prudence justified him in it; could discover that he had spirit, tho' he held the same under agood regimen &amp; command.</P>
<P>And as the Most High, who gives Gifts to every man as he pleaseth, had accomplish'd him for service, and given him a right spirit therefor; so in the ordering of his Providence, he call'd him forth thereunto; and in every
<PB N="26" REF="003379_0028_0FF821915626CE90"/>imployment of Life, he discharg'd himself well and worthily, to the general satisfaction of those concerned with him, and to his own honour. While he was pleas'd to continue in a military capacity, how well accepted! how much esteem'd! and in a civil capacity, he was one of the best of Men, and did Govern in the integrity of his heart, and by the skil∣fulness of his hands; in matters of controversy between plea and plea, it may be said, that he made Judgment to run down as waters and righteousness as a mighty stream; and in causes of delinquency, he was in a great degree a terror unto evil doers, and was so fear'd as well as lov'd, that he scatter'd the wicked with his eye: in the executive Court he was a skilful and righteous Judge; and in the Le∣gislative, a wise and able Counseller: He had an extended foresight, a clear discerning, and an uncommon dexterity in the management of affairs, and was truly fitted for Government and Publick Service; therefore he was not long in the <HI>General Court,</HI> before his excellent talents were observed, and the Wisdom of that Ho∣nourable Assembly hath often improved him in controversies and difficulties in Towns and Societies; which, he (with other worthy Gentlemen) hath done good service, in com∣posing and bringing to a peaceable and satis∣factory issue.</P>
<P>And as in this regard he hath been a great and blessed Instrument of Publick Service a∣broad; so in the same way he hath done much
<PB N="27" REF="003379_0029_0FF821B6F77904F0"/>good among his own people: many differences he heal'd; many contending parties he re∣concil'd; scarce ever a man more applyed to for Counsel and Advice in matters and diffi∣culties of every nature and kind; or that did more good (according to his sphere) in such a way than he: his House was as <HI>Abel;</HI> here they ask'd Counsel and so ended the matter. And here, I cannot but mention to his honour, the uncommon talent he had, not only to de∣termine controversies according to righteous∣ness and justice; but also commonly in such a manner as would be to the good satisfaction of all parties, that they were wont to go away contented, pleas'd, in perfect amity one with another; and admiring the man that had done them so great service; that it may be in a good measure said of him, as <HI>Job</HI> saith of himself: <HI>Unto him men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at his counsel. After his words they spake not again, and his speech dropped upon them, and they waited for him as for the rain, and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain. He chose out our way and sat chief, and was one that comforted the mourners,</HI> Job 29. 21, 22, 23, 25.</P>
<P>Neither may I omit to Recognize some special vertues, in which he did shine with a particular lustre. He was courteous and very obliging to all, and had a particular sweetness of Conversation: his riches and exaltation did not render him offensively assuming, but gave him the opportunity of recommending himself
<PB N="28" REF="003379_0030_0FF82193830E12F0"/>so much the more by his affability and con∣descentions; he was as free from sourness and morosity, as almost any man living; natural∣ly disposed to an innocent and moderate plea∣santness; and yet had a particular skill in commanding reverence from all that convers'd with him.</P>
<P>He was pitiful and compassionate to his fel∣low creatures in their distresses, and troubles, and always ready as well as able to help them; often hath he delivered the needy, when they came to him, the poor also and him that had none to help him. How often and how glad∣ly hath he assisted the fatherless, and made the widow's heart to sing for joy: <HI>He put on righte∣ousness and it clothed him, his judgment was a robe and a diadem, he was eyes to the blind, and feet was he to the lame; he was a father to the poor, and the cause which he knew not, he search∣ed out, he brake the jaws of the wicked, and pluckt the spoil out of their teeth.</HI></P>
<P>He was of a peaceable and quiet spirit, and watchful and diligent in maintaining and pre∣serving peace and quietness among his neigh∣bours, and among his people: he had a parti∣cular greatness of soul, and was of a right publick spirit; and as God blessed him with a plentiful Estate, so he gave him an heart to do good with the same; for he was truly ge∣nerous, as he made manifest on all inviting oc∣casions; liberal both in publick contributions and donations, as also in private charities be∣yond what the world knew any thing of.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="003379_0031_0FF821B9E3BC50C0"/>
Amiable also he appears if we view him in every relation; a dutiful Son, very respectful to his aged Parents, neither of which have been many, and one of which hath not been two years dead; a most kind and loving Hus∣band; a wise and a tender Father; a good Neighbour; a fast Friend; a faithful Repro∣ver; Ministerial; a hearty Lover of his Coun∣try, and of all good men.</P>
<P>In Religion, he was sound in the faith, care∣ful and conscientious in the practise, as well as in the profession of it: he was not a talka∣tive, but a real Christian: never admired the noise, but always the thing: great was his regard to the house of God, and very exempla∣ry in a constancy, seasonableness, and reve∣rence of attending upon the publick Worship: in lesser and controverted points, he was of a moderate and charitable spirit, and was mainly concerned for the great things of God's law, mercy, judgment and faith: to practise them himself, and to promote them in others. His conversation, was pure, and blameless, and unstain'd from his youth up: and I am perswaded that he acted under the governing influence of the fear of God, and a sincere aim to honour and please him in the conduct of himself, both in a publick and a private capacity; and as he visibly liv'd the Christi∣an, so he had the advantage thereof in his last hours; patient, resign'd, and support∣ed by a comfortable hope: his tho'ts and his speech were much of Religion, and the things
<PB N="30" REF="003379_0032_0FF8219669DD3960"/>of another world: and among other savoury expressions, he said, <Q>He hop'd God would not gather his Soul with Sinners, when he should die; for he had not lov'd their com∣pany, when living, and that above all pla∣ces he had lov'd the habitation of God's house, and the place where his honour dwel∣leth.</Q> And some of the last words which I ever heard him speak, at the conclusion of some religious discourse, were, <Q>That after all he could venture himself upon the Gospel way of acceptance and Salvation.</Q> And the sen∣tence of charity is, that he is gone to the <HI>Hades</HI> of the blessed.</P>
<P>USE V. Of <HI>Address</HI> in a threefold Di∣rection.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Unto the Family;</HI> which is fill'd with Sorrow and cover'd with Mourning: Madam, and the Children; It hath pleas'd the most high God, the Sovereign Lord of Heaven and of Earth, to take away your Head from you, and your Glory is departed; your loss is ex∣ceeding great and irreparable; yet you must consider that it is an instance of divine good∣ness, and an honour to you, that you have had such an Husband and such a Father: and you have cause of Thankfulness that you have enjoyed him so long. And now since it hath been the pleasure of the Supream King to take him from you, silence and submission, patience and composedness, are your duty; studying rightly to improve so great a Provi∣dence.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="003379_0033_0FF821BB71C420A8"/>
<HI>Madam,</HI> my Hearts desire and prayer for you, is, that you may not faint, now you are so sharply rebuked of the Lord: you are now intitled to many rich and supporting promi∣ses, which you were not before intitled unto. Trust therefore in the Lord, and let thy spirit be sustained and comforted by those words of God, <HI>Isa.</HI> 54.5. <HI>For thy Maker is thine husband, (the Lord of Hosts is his name) and thy Redeem∣er the holy One of Israel, the God of the whole earth shall he be called.</HI> Your languishing hus∣band, when he beheld your sorrow and your tears, said to you, <Q>I shall leave you in the hands of a good God, and among Christian friends, and I hope and trust that you will experience the tenderness and faithfulness of an All-sufficient God, and the respect and kindness of christian friends.</Q><HI>So be it.</HI></P>
<P>And you the Children; my hearts desire and prayer for you is, that you may follow your father in all his good qualities and ver∣tues; that each of you may do good, and be serviceable as he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was: in this he express'd himself, as the principal thing which he desir'd for you: <Q>That God would remem∣ber his everlasting Covenant to you, &amp; make you useful &amp; serviceable while you live in the world.</Q> Now may it please the Eternal King to fulfil the desire of his Servant, and grant unto each of you to be so minded: And you his Sons, who are yet in your minority; great was the concern of your departing fa∣ther for you: may his dying counsel and
<PB N="32" REF="003379_0034_0FF82198785ED4F8"/>charge never be forgotten by you: take heed and beware, watch and pray against the temp∣tations of your age and your day; remember your Creator in the days of your youth, seek and serve the Lord betimes; and may you all herein agree and say, this God is our God, we will serve him and trust in him: our fathers God and we will exalt him: So shall you have an happy meeting with him, who is gone before, another day.</P>
<P N="2">2. To the people of this Town: Men, Bre∣thren, and Fathers, I account it an honour to this place, that God hath rais'd up such a man in it: We have enjoy'd a rich blessing in him; he hath been the instrument of much good a∣mong us; the sober and well disposed a∣mong us, have for a number of years sat under the shadow of his conduct and ad∣ministration with great satisfaction; and how heartily could we have rejoyced, might he have been continued many years more to do service among us, according to the largeness of his ability, and excellency of his dispositi∣on; but the Supream over all hath determi∣ned and ordered otherwise, and it is now <HI>with us a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morn∣ing spread upon the mountains, for our breach is great like the Sea, who can heal us?</HI></P>
<P>And since it is such a day of rebuke and dis∣pleasure, what should we do but consider seri∣ously, and humble our selves before God; search our hearts, and try our ways, and turn
<PB N="33" REF="003379_0035_0FF821BE8DC17818"/>unto the Lord: O let us beg and plead with God, that he would not depart away from us, and give us up unto our own ruin and de∣struction. Our head and <HI>gap-man</HI> is remov'd, O! that God would not suffer all our hedges to be broken down, and we laid waste, as an uncultivated wilderness: Oh! what shall we do in this dark and distressing day! unto you do I call, all ye sensible and tho'tful, all ye pious and religious ones, and my voice unto you is, All ye that affect and love good order, Oh! let us know where our help is, in God a∣lone; and let us pour out our hearts before him in most fervent Supplications, that he would yet dwell among us, and build up his interest in this place. O let us be united in heart and hand, and strengthen the good things which remain, that they languish and die not: O that love and peace might continue among us and good order flourish; and no other Emu∣lation be found among us but this, who shall excel in goodness and exceed in usefulness. O pray for the rising generation; pray one for another; and for me, that my God would teach me discretion, give me grace to be faithful, and inable me to do some service the little time I may have to continue among you.</P>
<P N="3">3. Here is a proper place for an <HI>Address to the People of this Government.</HI> O what meaneth the fierceness of the Lord's Anger, that he is thus going on in a way of rebuke and judg∣ment, that he doth thus multiply his witnesses against us, and make so many of his waves
<PB N="34" REF="003379_0036_0FF8216F34C3CC18"/>and his billows to pass over us? how hath he made us from year to year, for a number of years past, to experience the sad execution of that awful threatning, Isa. 3.1, 2, 3. <HI>For be∣hold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah — the mighty man — the judge — the prudent — the honour∣able man and the counseller!</HI> How are we weak∣ned, and how is our Glory made thin at this day! as God threatned, <HI>Isaiah</HI> 17.4.</P>
<P>O that God would sanctify his judgments to our reformation, that he would be with our honourable and worthy Men, who yet survive, that they may be continued to us; and that a double portion of the spirit of Wisdom and Understanding, of Counsel, Government, and the Fear of the Lord, may rest upon them; and that He with whom is the residue of the Spirit, would pour it out, and restore our Judges as at the first, and our Counsellers as at the beginning; that we may be called a Colony of Righteousness, a faithful Government; that he would continue our Priviledges; give us favour in the King's eyes and with his Coun∣sellers; Heal all the unhappy divisions found among us, and bless his People with peace.</P>
