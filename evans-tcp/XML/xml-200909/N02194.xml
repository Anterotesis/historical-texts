<HEAD>PREFACE. To the Reverend Mr. <HI>Peter Thacher,</HI> Modera∣tor, and the honourable Council of <HI>Churches, Patrons</HI> of Regular Singing, this Book is humbly Dedicated.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE</HI> great Obstruction that Regular Singing has of late met with from a great Number of Persons, who being Ignorant of the Use &amp; Excellency thereof, Vehemently decry it, and Violently Oppose it; (from whence has ensued great Contention &amp; Discord among us;) has Occasioned the following Discourse; which is only the fruit of or few spare Hours. Since the Writing hereof, I have seen several Tracts about Singing, viz <HI>The Accompilshed Singer;</HI> the <HI>Sweat Psalmist of Israel;</HI> and, <HI>A Discourse about the Reason<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bleness of Regular Singing:</HI> which I had never seen before These being made by Men of great Learning, may seem to render the ensuing Discourse useless; but tho' it be vastly in∣feriour to them, yet being on a something <HI>different</HI> Subject, and shewing the <HI>Necessity</HI> of Regular Singing in the Worship of GOD: I know not but it ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of some use to the Unlearned (for whom it it is designed;) For Moon light is serviceable to those that are benighted. If it may be of service to inlighten those that thro' Ignorance decry all Rule, and applaud Singing by Rote as the good Old Way; and if it may help to Reconcile Differing Minds; and for the future prevent Disorder in the Worship of GOD; GOD will herein be glorifyed, and my end will be obtained: and I shall Rejoyce, who desire to be for ever found a Friend to Peace and Truth, and a Mourner for the contrary.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT Singing of Psalms is a part of Di∣vine Worship, to be performed by the Peo∣ple of GOD, in their Publick Assemblies,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">not Including singing in Private.</NOTE> where they meet to Worship Him, is a truth Generally Received; and the Practise of the Reformed Churches makes it fully Evident. That this is not only a Modern Practice, but was in use among the People of GOD in Elder Ages, is as evident, the Worship of GOD both in the time of the Old Testament Dispensation, and the New was not performed without it. In this Chapter we have an Account of a Grear Solemnity in the time of the Old Testament; It was that of <HI>David's</HI> bringing the Ark of GOD from the House of <HI>Obed Edom,</HI> to the Place he had Prepared for it And among other things there mentioned, we are told in the 16 <HI>verse,</HI> that <HI>David</HI> spake to the Chief of the <HI>Levites,</HI> to appoint their Brethren to be the Singers, &amp;c. And in the Succeeding <HI>verses,</HI> we have an Account of the Manner of that Performance. In the <HI>verse</HI> wherein the Text is, 'tis said, <HI>And Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>naniah the Chief of the Levites was for Song.</HI> Then follow the Words to be Insisted on, <HI>viz He Instructed about the Song because he was Skillful.</HI> In the Words we may ob∣serve, <HI>First,</HI> Something Implyed, which is, <HI>1st. That Psalmody is
<PB N="2" REF="002614_0004_0FDB758017C29C70"/>a part of Divine Worship, which ought to be performed Regularly</HI> Instruction and Skill Imply Rule. <HI>2ly That it ought to be practised in Publick Conventions for the Worship of GOD.</HI> The Exercise the Text Relates to was in such a one. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Some∣thing expressed, wherein observe <HI>First,</HI> A Person Instructing about the Song, who had the oversight thereof, <HI>viz. Chenaniah. Secondly.</HI> The Reason why he had the oversight thereof, <HI>viz Because he was Skillful.</HI> From Hence arises this Doctrinal Truth.</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>That to the Right or Regular Performance of the Duty of Singing Psalms, in the Publick Worship of GOD, Good Skill is Necessary, and Required in (at least some of) them that Perform it</HI></P>
<P>I say <HI>[some of them]</HI> because we find here an Instructor, whence it follows that some were Instructed; All are not capable to lead herein. It cannot be Expected that whole Congregations should be Skillful; but it is Necessary that there be some and such a Number (at least) as may Govern the Psalmody, and be a Sufficient Guide to the Unskillful that the Service may be Regular, and becoming so Sacred an Ex∣ercise, and a pleasing Offering to the GOD of order, who requires as in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. <HI>ult. Let all things be done in order.</HI> The <HI>Levites</HI> in a peculiar manner ought to be well skill'd herein.</P>
<P>THERE are Two Propositions contained in the Doctrine.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>First. THAT Singing of Psalms as a part of the. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lick Wor∣ship of GOD, is of Divine Institution, and a Duty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncumbent on all the People of GOD.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly. THAT It ought to be Performed Regularly, or with Skill.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>First THAT singing of Psalms as a part of the Publick Wor∣ship of GOD, is of Divine Institution, and a Duty Incumbent on all the People of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>THE Truth of this Proposition is abundantly Evident from the Scriptures. Especially the Psalms of <HI>David,</HI> which were D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctated by the Spirit of GOD. Indiced and Pen'd for the use of the Church of GOD in all Ages, to be S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng in the Praises of GOD; And some whereof were Composed in Par∣ticular for the <HI>Sabbath Day,</HI> sco <HI>Psal.</HI> 92. Title: And in the
<PB N="3" REF="002614_0005_0FDB75843A6E86D0"/>100. <HI>Psal.</HI> we are Directed and Commanded to <HI>Enter God's House with praise.</HI> And <HI>David</HI> (the sweet Psalmist of Israel, as he is Stil'd in the 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23.1.) not only Indited the Psalms (most of 'em) and Sung 'em for his own Comfort and Sol∣lace; but also Published them for the Service of GOD in the Church; And withal appointed the Singers and the Tunes fitting them, see 1 <HI>Chron</HI> 16 4 5 as the Titles of Sundry Psalms make Manifest. And King <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> that good King and great Reformer Practised agreeably, as may be seen in 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 29.30 And this was not only an Old Testament Service but also Commanded and Practised in the New, see <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.19. <HI>Singing and making Melody in your Hearts to the Lord.</HI> And Col. 3.16. <HI>Singing to the Lord</HI> &amp;c And our SAVIOUR with his Disciples Practised it, as in <HI>Matt.</HI> 26.30. and <HI>Mark</HI> 14.26. <HI>And when they had sung an Hymn, they went forth,</HI> &amp;c. But this is a truth so Generally Received, and Practised by Christians of all Den<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>minations, (almost) that I need not insist thereon. I therefore proceed to the Second Proposition which I mainly intend which is.</P>
<P>PROP. the <HI>Second. THAT Singing of Psalms ought to be Performed Regularly, or with Skill</HI></P>
<P>FOR Illustration and Comfirmation of this Proposition, I shall Inquire.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>First.</HI> WHAT is here meant by Skill, or what it is to Sing with Skill?</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly.</HI> WHY this Skill is Necessary in Psalmody.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>First.</HI> WHAT are we here to understand by Skill, or what it is to Sing with Skill?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> BY Skill in General is meant, Good Knowledge (from good Instruction and Experience) in any Art or Sci∣ence: a good understanding of the Rules thereof. Skill Im∣plies Rule and there is no Art without it. He that is acquain∣ted with the Rules of any Art and by Practice h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s gain'd Expe∣rience may be said to have Skill, see <HI>Exodus</HI> 31.3. &amp; Chap. 35.31. 1 <HI>Chron</HI> 22.15. and Chap. 28.21. But more Particularly, And</P>
<P><HI>First Negatively,</HI> THE Skill in Singing is not <HI>here</HI> to be un∣derstood of the Grace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">that is another Subject.</NOTE> Required to be in Exercise in the Per∣formance thereof; for those that are most Unskillful in the Vecal part may Exercise Grace therein: and the Gracious part appertaineth to those Saints that were to be Instructed,
<PB N="4" REF="002614_0006_0FDB7585397409D0"/>as well as to the Instructor, and might be better Perform'd by 'em. Nor could he that Instructed others furnish 'em with that Grace in the least measure. Those that by Natural Impediments are Rendred uncapable of Performing that Duty or Exercise with Skill, may yet do it with Grace, and be accepted of GOD therein: and are not faulty when they do their best as those are, that have Power and Means to attain Skill, but Neglect to Improve them.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Secondly and Affirmatively,</HI> BY Skill here is intended.</P>
<P>FIRST. KNOWLEDGE of, and Ability to Manage the Tunes, in which the Psalms are to be Sung according to the Rules thereof; so as there may be <HI>Concord, Harmony</HI> and good <HI>Melody</HI> therein, <HI>Psal.</HI> 33.3. <HI>Play Skillfully,</HI> or do well in Playing, or rather Singing <HI>i. e.</HI> Make good Musick or Melody, and in this the Skill of <HI>Chenaniah</HI> was Imployed. Singing Implies <HI>Harmony</HI> and <HI>Melody.</HI> Every Pleasant Noise or Voice is not Singing in this sense; <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.19 <HI>Making Melody</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Isa.</HI> 51.3. Thanksgiving and the <HI>Voice</HI> of <HI>Melody,</HI> by which is meant Harmony, and a Sweet Musical utterence of the Holy Song. In this <HI>Knowledge</HI> is more Particularly Implyed or Included.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> AN Acquaintance with the Rules of Musick, the different Keys and the various Tones, Notes or sounds there∣in; the Chords and Discords, how to Rise and Fall Gradually, or pass from Chord to Chord in an agreeable manner, how to keep Time, and to make proper Closes, and the like.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> A Musical Ear, or an Ability to distinguish be∣tween the different Sounds in Musick: A Quick Perception of what is Disagreeable, Jarring and Immusical. This the Unskilful discern not, and therefore it is that they are so in Love with, what they Ignorantly call the <HI>Good Old Way,</HI> and even Idolize it, while they Reject and Decry the <HI>Real Good Old Way</HI> of Rule and Order. But of this more hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> A Tuneable Voice, which may be Managed in an Agreeable manner, by the Direction of the Notes, to the making good Musick or Melody. This to some is in a manner Natural; while others acquire it with great Pains and Diligence in Practice, but is Necessary to that Skill we are speaking of. As in any Craft, tho' a Man may have the Knowledge of all the parts and particulars thereof; yet Ex∣cept he can use his Hands Ingeniously to do the Work of it, he cannot be said to be Skillful therein: So Knowledge of
<PB N="5" REF="002614_0007_0FDB7586B63409A0"/>the Rules and the Notes and Characters of Musick will not render a Man Skilful, Except he can Govern his Voice to make agreeable Sounds. Good Knowledge of Rules with an agreeable Dexterity to Practice them makes an Artist, and such as have attained these may be said to be Skilful indeed.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. BY Skill here may be intended, an Excel∣lency therein, and a Superiour Degree of Knowledge there∣about. In the Sacred Musick there were <HI>Levites</HI> appointed for several Duties, and some to <HI>Ply</HI> and <HI>set them forward</HI> and to <HI>be over</HI> the Rest. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15.21. and these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e such as Excelled in the Art of Singing, to whom Sundry Psalms were Directed and Intituled, that by their care and direction they might be Sung Excellently unto the End. There were in <HI>Israel</HI> some <HI>Levites Singers</HI> that attended thereunto, and had no other charge; (see 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 9.33.) as <HI>Aynsworth</HI> on <HI>Psalm</HI> 4. has noted. Tho' Skill be neceessary in all, in some Degree yet not alike in all; those that appoint the Tunes, and lead therein should be capable to suit them to the matter of the Psalms Sung, whither of Prayer, Confession. Lamentation or Praise; some of the Tunes are more <HI>Chearful,</HI> and suited to Psalms of Praise; others more <HI>Melancholly,</HI> and suited to Psalms of Prayer, Confession, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which should be Regard∣ed. This is manifest by the Titles<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Aynsworth on the Titles of these Psalms.</NOTE> of the Psalms (many of 'em) in some of which the <HI>Tunes</HI> were Directed, or at least the Particular <HI>Keys</HI> on which they were Composed, as in Psalm 46. <HI>Title; a Song upon Alamoth</HI> which signifies <HI>Virgins,</HI> and this Psalm seems to be sung by the <HI>Virgins</HI> at <HI>Solomons</HI> Wedding, and on the <HI>Treble</HI> also, because shrill like a <HI>Virgins</HI> Voice, And Psal. 9. Title, <HI>To the Chief Musician upon Muth-Labben;</HI> this as Referred to the Musick seems to be a Tune on the Middle Key, <HI>viz</HI> the <HI>Medius,</HI> or <HI>Tenor,</HI> or <HI>Counter. Tenor,</HI> and Psalm 12. Title — <HI>upon Sheminith,</HI> or upon the Eight, or as the <HI>Chaldee</HI> Expoundeth it, the <HI>Eight Stringed Harp,</HI> or after the <HI>Eight,</HI> this is Referred to the Bass, being <HI>Grave, Solid</HI> &amp;c. <HI>David</HI> when he fetch'd home GOD's Ark, appointed some <HI>Levites</HI> with <HI>Harps</HI> upon the Eight, for the Honour and Ser∣vice of GOD, as in the <HI>verse</HI> before the Text. These things point out to us, that Rules were observed, Skill used, and a great Degree thereof Necessary to an agreeable Singing of the Praises of GOD. And here by the way 'tis worthy our
<PB N="6" REF="002614_0008_0FDB758C597A1840"/>Notice, That the <HI>Levites</HI> were Leaders in this Holy Exercise, and these (many of 'em) Excell'd in Skill and Instructed others; which shows that the Ministers of the Gospel ought to be Skillful herein, and should Instruct and lead their Peo∣ple; which might be preventive of the Contentions and Differences that arise thereabout. I come now to the Se∣cond Enquiry which is.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly. WHY is such Skill Necessary in Psalmody? or why ought it to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Regular, and Performed with Skill?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> RULE and Skill are Necessary, <HI>First,</HI> In Regard to <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Decency. This</HI> of its own Nature brings some cir∣cumstantial Dignity and Comliness to Divine Actions, as a Table and Cloath at the Communion, a Pulpit and Cloath or Cushion to a Sermon a clean and bright Bason for the Water at Baptism, and the like. This is Required in all the parts of GOD's Worshiip. As there are particular Rules given in the Scriptures in Cases that Require them, so there are Rules that are more General: some things in the Worship of GOD are Directed, (as to the Substance thereof) by particular Rules, but the Circumstances attending 'em are Directed only by General Rules; such as the Rules of observing of Order, Decency and the like and these are left to Discretion, see 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.40. <HI>Let all things be done Decently, and in Order.</HI> Now without Rule and Skill, it is Impossible there should be either Decency or Order, as will appear under the next Particular, which has a near Relation with this <HI>viz.</HI> That Rule and Skill are Necessary.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly. TO Prevent Discord and Confusion, in the Exercise of Singing.</HI> These are contrary to GOD and to all Religion, as in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14 33. <HI>God is not the Author of Confusion,</HI> &amp;c. It is for Order's sake that the Psalms are put into Metre. The <HI>Hebrew Poe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e</HI> was doubtless accommodated to their way of Singing, and agreeable to Rule and Art: and our Psalms are therefore Metrically Translated, that they might be adapted to the Rules of Psalmody. The Lines are measured by Syllables, which Requires so many particular Sounds, di∣rected by the Notes both as to their Length, and their Musi∣cal Rising and Falling. Now when Men are void of Skill herein, and unacquainted with the Rules thereof, it is Im∣possible they shold agree to make <HI>one Sound,</HI> or an <HI>even Sound;</HI> such an one as is discribed and was practised in 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 5 13. which is made by Rising and Falling of the Voice coincidently
<PB N="7" REF="002614_0009_0FDB758DC43A4A68"/>and in Union altogether, and duly keeping time, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>olation of Voice by which means a whole Congregation may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d to make but one Sound. Where there is no Rule, Mens Fancies (by which they are govern'd) are various; some affect a Quavering Flourish on one Note, and others upon another which (because they are Ignorant of true Musick or Melody) they account a Grace to the Tune; and while some affect a quicker Motion, others affect a slower, and draw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out their Notes beyond all Reason, hence in Congre¦gations ensue Jarrs &amp; Discords, which make the Singing (rather) resemble Howling: And their drawing our the Notes to such a length is the occasion of their Tittering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and down, as if the Tunes were all composed of Quavers, and make 'em resemble Tunes to Dance to. <HI>Further,</HI> The want of Rule &amp; Skill is the reason why every Congregation almost has a different way of Singing. So that when Per∣sons are occasionally abroad, and joy with a Neighbouring Congregation in the Worship of GOD, they are o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> un∣capable of Singing with 'em. Thus 'tis often at Lectures, and especially at Ordinations, where People of many Con∣gregations Meet together, their ways of Singing are so different, that 'tis not easy to know what Tune is Sung, and in Reality there is none: 'Tis rather Jumble &amp; Confusion, Altho' they all, doubtless, intend some Tune or other, and it may be, the same yet they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iffer almost as much as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every one Sang a different Tune. This I have often ob∣served all which is owing to the want of Knowledge of the Rules of Singing and of Skill to improve and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ge 'em. Some indeed may imagine that Singing by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> ran∣dom, is as Harmonious as Singing by Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, but this pro∣ceeds from their Ignorance. For as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in all Arts &amp; S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ences whatsoever, when Persons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave Learned the Rules, and by practice gained Experience, they see with new Eyes, as it were, and things that before seem'd to 'em to be Acure and well done, now appear to be only Bungle, so it is in this case. As Persons by practice in any Craft, obtain a Curious eye, and also become Handy and Expert in doing the work thereof; so by practice in Singing they obtain a Monce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ear, and perceive the difference of Sound, and find, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be only Jars &amp; Diseord, which before they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cemed good Musick or Melody, and are made capable of Striking any Note agreable to its Peace &amp; Sound. They no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> find, that
<PB N="8" REF="002614_0010_0FDB758F0405E840"/><HI>Rule</HI> excelleth <HI>Rote</HI> and Random, as far as light excels dark∣ness. As in Writing or Printing, without the Stops or Pauses the sense would be destroyed, and the true meaning not understood, and the most Rational Discourse appear Non-sense; so, without the use of Notes in Psalmody there will be only Jars and Discord: Hence appears the Necessity of Rule &amp; Skill. But.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly THEY are Necessary in order to Harmony &amp; Melody</HI> In order to these, Skill &amp; Rule are highly Necessary, because these are not Adjuncts, but of the Essence of Singing: where these are wanting, there is no Singing, and these require great Skill,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Playfords Introduction.</NOTE>. "Musick is an Art Divine and Ex∣cellent, by which a true Concordance of Sounds or Harmony is produced. There is a vast Mystery therein. It is (as <HI>Augustine</HI> intimates) the gift of GOD himself, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Re∣presentation of the sweet Consent &amp; Harmony, which His Wisdom hath made in the Creation, and also in the Admi∣nistration of the World. <HI>It is founded even in Nature it self;</HI> for there are but Seven distinct Sounds in Musick (or in Nature) which are repeated thorow the several Keys, as they stand in the Scale of Musick, every Eighth being exactly of the same Kind, in Nature, and Coincidence of Sound. There are likewise<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As to the Parts of Musick; but as to the Nature thereof, there are but Two, Flat &amp; Sharp.</NOTE> Three distinct Keys, or Septenaries, in which all the Parts of Musick, be they never so many are contained; so that if more be added, it is but the Multipli∣cation of one of these; These are mainly founded in, or chiefly composed from the Trial of the greater Concords of Notes, in the Three Septenaries, agreeing in one Harmony; so that one and the same Tune placed in these three, (or more) Keys may vary <HI>(i. e.)</HI> by falling in one Key, and at the same time Standing, or Rising in the other, yet there will be an exact Concord &amp; Harmony, perfectly void of all Jars &amp; Discord, if agreeably placed according to the Rules of Descant or Counterpoint in Musick: and being Sung thus, in Consort, there will be extraordinary good Musick, and a charming Melody, delightful to the Ear, and to the Heart very Ravishing. As there are but Seven Sounds in Nature constituted, so I doubt not, but the Art of Modulation, or Managing of the Voice, so as to produce
<PB N="9" REF="002614_0011_0FDB7590A7E07F00"/>a true Concordance of Sounds, was not from <HI>Satan,</HI> but from the GOD of Nature; and why might not the Inspired Psal∣mists at first have it of Divine Inspiration? This is cer∣tainly admirably adapted to the Praises of GOD. As there is a glorious Harmony in all his works, so in this part of Divine Worship, agreeably performed, 'tis shewed forth. We Read, Psal. 145.10. <HI>All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy Saints shall bless thee.</HI> By the works of GOD Praising Him, may be Meant, that the glorious Harmony there is in all the works of Creation and Providence, abundantly ma∣nifest and shew forth the Glory of the Divine Wisdom; Power &amp; Goodness. And by the Saints Blessing Him may be Meant, their Singing his Praises on that account (for we bless GOD when we Praise Him) in which, agreeably performed, there is a Concordance of Sounds, and a Har∣mony produced, which Naturally tends to Raise the Spirit in Devotion. and how agreeably, while we Meditate the Har∣mony that there is in the works of GOD, have we a Har∣mony or Melody in our Devotion or Religious Acknow∣ledgment of GOD on that Account? And indeed it is the Harmony <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Melody of Singing, that makes it differ from Speaking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Reading the Psalms; and this makes the Exer∣cise Resemble Heaven it self. See, <HI>Rev.</HI> 5.9. with other places of Scripture of like Import.

<PB N="10" REF="002614_0012_0FDB7591F82761A8"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilent of Philosophy; is to be endeavoured in our Puis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> Singing of Psalms, arid is Required in the Worship of GOD, is evident from the fore quoted Text, <HI>Psal,</HI> 33.3. &amp; <HI>Isdi.</HI> 51.3. But I pass to the fourth &amp; last Reason which is,</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly, RULE and Skill are Necessary to make the Service Reasonable.</HI> GOD Requires of the Reasonable Creature, a Reasonable Service, Rom. 12.1. <HI>[which is your Reasonable Ser∣vice,]</HI> by which is intended such a worship of GOD, as is most agreeable to Reason, and most agreeable to so excellent and pure a Deity, by the Verdict &amp; Sencence of Right Rea∣son, Now in Singing without Rule there cannot be such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n exercise of Reason, as in a Regular performance thereof. In performing any Action, or Duty according to Rule, there is an exercise of Reason in the very Act &amp; Manner of Per∣formance; and the Person so acting can render a Reason, why he so performs it. As GOD is Infinite in Understand∣ing, so He has given us Understanding, in a measure agree∣able to out Natures &amp; Beings, and requires us to exercise Reason in all things; and as He has made RULE the mea∣sure of our Duty, even in the <HI>Superficial Part</HI> thereof, so He requires us to Conform thereunto; and herein there is a Necessary. Exercise of Reason. GOD requires us to shew but selves Men Isai. 46.8. <HI>Shew your selves Men.</HI> That is by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing Reasonably: But while we in any thing act at Ran∣dom, or de all by Rote, It looks rather like Instinct, or un∣certain Experiment, by which bruit Creatures act, than like Ratic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al <HI>Paul</HI> saith, in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.15. <HI>I will Sing in the Spirit, and with Understanding;</HI> therefore Reasonably. Thus <HI>Singing</HI> appears to be a Reasonable Service, and cannot be agreeably performed, without Rule &amp; Skill.</P>
<P>THUS having spoken briefly to the Doctrinal part; be∣fore I pass to the designed brief Application, I shall endea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ur to Answer a few Objections against Regular Singing.</P>
<P>Object. 1. <HI>SOME have objected, That in the Church of Israel An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nental Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck was in use, which Required Skill and Art, But in our Vocal Singing there is not the like Necessity.</HI></P>
<P>TO which I Answer,</P>
<P N="1">1. 'TIS Easier by practice to Order &amp; Govern an Instru∣ment, according to the Notes, than 'tis for the most of Man to Modulate their Voices; which makes Skill in Vo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. Necessary As in Instrumental Musick. But,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="11" REF="002614_0013_0FDB7593D8864648"/>
2. IN the Church of Israel, Vocal Musick was in use, as well as Instrumental, else to what End, were the Psalme Me∣trically composed, which are Divine Songs: The Title of one being, <HI>To the chies Musician, a Psalm or Song.</HI> And others of the like Import: And they were Sung by <HI>David,</HI> and others of the People of GOD. And Instruments could not Articulate the Sounds of the words of the Psalmist; in 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.30. 'tis said, <HI>They praised God, in the words of Da∣vid and Asaph.</HI> Hence that Objection appears invalid.</P>
<P>Object. 2. <HI>IF the Tunes (as the Psalms are) were of Divine Inspiration, or had we the Hebrew Tunes; then it were Reasonable to conform to them and endeavour after Skill; but since we have not those, we have no Rule at all: nor do we see Rule necessary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> THO' we have not the Notes of the Hebrew Psalm Tunes, (which might for ought I know be divinely Inspi∣red) (as some of the Titles of the Psalms seem to Intimate) Or, the Prophets and Sacred Musicians that directed them, were at least assisted, with the Divine Concourse and Influ∣ence, <HI>Exod.</HI> 31.2, 3. Yet this is no just Bar to our way of Regular Singing, or just Objection against our Tunes, or the Skill of our Composers, or Masters of Musick. If the Hebrew Tunes had been Necessary for us, they would, no doubt have been preserved, with the Psalms for our use; but the Hebrew Metres differ from the Metres of other Languages, which makes it inconvenient for us to use their Tunes, if we had them; which those who are Skill'd in the Languages, do well know. And when the Psalms were first Translated into English Metre, fit to be Sung, Persons of Skill in Musick, Composed Tunes to fit the Version; some of which Tunes are affixed to our Psalm books, and the Singing of them according to the Notes in our Psalm∣books, is by some commonly called, The New Way of Singing. And tho' the Hebrew Tunes have not been Pre∣served, as we know of; yet the Skill, and general Rules of Singing, have doubtless been Retained (as well as of other Arts &amp; Sciences, <HI>Logick. Philosophy,</HI> and the like) from Age to Age, 'till now: several of which are plainly discerned in the Scriptures, (as in the Book of <HI>Jeb,</HI> and some of the pro∣phets, and more in the New. Testament:) And this is a sufficient Warrant for us to improve our Skill in composing
<PB N="12" REF="002614_0014_0FDB759985FAF5C8"/>and using Tunes for Psalms, which comes under the general Rule, and Command of Singing them with <HI>Decency &amp; Order.</HI></P>
<P>Obj. 3. <HI>THIS way of Singing, seems to be derived from the</HI> French, <HI>and looks like Popery; and it seems to be Introductory there unto.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. SUPPOSE the Popish party to use it that is no∣thing to us, nor it is a just bar to our use of it; if we must forbear the use of any thing in the Worship of GOD, on this score, we must forbear preaching or Believing the Doctrine of the Trinity, and the Hypostatical Union, with many other Important Doctrines, of Christianity, which they Believe, Preach, and pretend to Practice agreeable to, but do not.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE thing is not true in Fact: for there is no Eng∣lish, or other Popish Church, that Sing Mass, as we by our Notes Sing Psalms. And it may as well be Objected, that all Singing, is Popery because they Sing Mass, and the like, tho' in a Vastly different way of Singing: Singing of Psalms Regularly, in Grave, Solemn Tunes, was from GOD, before Popery appear'd.</P>
<P N="3">3. WHILE these People, that thus object, pretend a mighty fear of Popery, they Really imbrace it, in one of its Main Tenets. 'Tis a Popish Tenet, that <HI>Ignorance</HI> is the Mother of Devotion; and <HI>this</HI> they greatly Affect, and wil∣fully continue in; decrying all Rule &amp; Learning, and due Means of Knowledge; affecting only a blind Ruleless Per∣formance of Devotion. I mean, as to the Vocal part of it, in which yet, Exactness, and Rule &amp; Skill are Required, as has been proved.</P>
<P>Obj. 4. <HI>THE fourth Objection I take Notice of in some, is against the Tone used in Singing by Rule; and the particular Syl∣lables</HI> Mi Fa Sol La, <HI>used in Learning; some calling it a Negro Tone, others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c squeaking Tone, unbeeoming the Worship of GOD, and the Syllables,</HI> Fa Sol La Mi, <HI>are the great obstacles to them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> THIS is a most Foolish Objection, not worthy the Answering; but since 'tis made I shall briesly Answer it thus: Whether it be a Negro Tone or no, I am sure it is an English Tone, and a Solemn Musical Tone; a Clear, Smooth, Even Preasant Tone; and by their pretending <HI>[Mi, Sol, Fa, La,]</HI> to be unbecoming the Worship of GOD, they
<PB N="13" REF="002614_0015_0FDB759B2433F990"/>must mean either that those Syllables are <HI>in that form</HI> Sung in the Worship of GOD, or else that the Singing of Tunes only, is a part of GOD's Worship. If they mean <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e first, 'tis what is not intended or used in the Worship of GOD. If they mean the second, it shews their great Ignorance, that Imagine a Tune only, a part which is only an Adjunct of Divine Worship. But that those Syllables as pronounced, are not unbecoming the Worshippers of GOD, appears in that among other Syllables the Psalms in English do abound with them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>see Psal,</HI> 27.10. <HI>and Psal.</HI> 89.26. <HI>to</HI> 30. <HI>also Psal.</HI> 42.5.3. <HI>to</HI> 11. <HI>and in many more.</HI></NOTE> as in the words, <HI>My Farther, — My Soul. — My Law,</HI> — which are the same Sound with <HI>Mi Fa Mi Sol Mi La.</HI> But to proceed.</P>
<P>Obj. 5. and last, <HI>I shall take notice of is this, The Apostle directs us, as in</HI> Eph. 5.19. <HI>and</HI> Col. 3.16. <HI>To make Melody in our Hearts to the Lord, and to Sing with Grace in our Hearts,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and this is Sufficient whether we Regard Rule or no, as to the External Part.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> THE Apostles Intention here is not to Abrogate that Skill or Rule, which Skill is supposed or Implied in the words <HI>Singing</HI> and <HI>Melody;</HI> but to shew that there withall it was Necessary to Exercise Grace in order to Divine accept∣ance. And I may say here about Singing with <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Skill</HI> as our <HI>Saviour</HI> said in another case, <HI>These ought ye to have done, and not leave the other undone.</HI></P>
<P>I Now Proceed to the APPLICATION.</P>
<P>AND the First use is of Information. <HI>Hence we learn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, That it's the Duty of all Christians to Labour after the Attainment of Good Skill, in Psalmody, or Regular Singing.</HI> If Singing of Psalms be a Duty Incumbent on all Persons Capable thereof, and Skill be Required in the Performance of it, as has been shewed; then it Necessarily follows, 'tis the Duty of all to Labour after the obtainment of it, and to Pray to GOD for it. Where a Duty is Imposed and Injoyned and Rules given therefor, the Persons on whom the Duty is Incumbent, ought to acquaint themselves with the Rules thereof, or else they cannot perform the Duty in an Agreeable manner, and to Acceptance. We are Required to Sing the Praises of
<PB N="14" REF="002614_0016_0FDB759C975DB468"/>GOD, see <HI>Psal.</HI> 96.1, 2. and <HI>Col.</HI> 3.16. and to do it with Skill or by Rule as the Text Implies, and as in <HI>Psal.</HI> 33.3 <HI>Play (or Sing) Skillfully,</HI> that is agreeable to Rule, which Skill Implies; hence it appears to be the Duty of all to La∣bour after Skill and to Pray for it.</P>
<P N="2">2ly. <HI>HENCE it appears that such as</HI> oppose <HI>Regular Sing∣ing are greatly to blame; these discover great Ignorance and Folly, and are the Authours of Great Disorder and Confusion in the Worship of GOD; which is greatly displeasing to Him.</HI> To do <HI>thus</HI> is to Debase the Rational Nature, and to Act below the Powers and Faculties with which GOD has Endowed us. If Skill and Rule be decryed in one thing, they may as well be so in another, 'till all Learning and Religion be Justled out, and all Rules and Precepts about the Worship of GOD (as much as in us lies) made void; and so a People favoured with the Word and Laws of GOD, and Rules how to Serve and Glo∣rify Him, shall become like the Blindest and most brutish of the Heathen and those that know not GOD.</P>
<P N="3">3ly. <HI>HENCE we see that when a People have deviated from, or have lost the Rules of Psalmody, it is their Duty to become sensible of their Error, and to Reform.</HI> Reformation is always, and in all cases a Duty, where there has been an Apostacy or Deviation from the Rules by Scripture required to be observed, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.6, to 22. <HI>Isa.</HI> 55, 7. In matters of great weight and moment a more earnest endeavour is required, and proportionably some tho' a less, in those that are less. see 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 29, 30, 31. Chapters, and 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.26, to 34 But in as much as Reformation usually meets with great Obstructi∣on, either from the Ignorance, or Willfulness and Incor∣rigibleness of Men, in an Evil way, there ought to be abun∣dance of Courage, Prudence and Caution in them that attempt it. But here a Question naturally arises, which is;</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>WHO should be Leaders in such a Reformation?</HI></P>
<P>IN Answer to which I would say, That as in all other things that need Reformation, so in the present case the Heads or Rulers of a People should lead and go before others. In the Chapter wherein the Text is, the Psalmody was appointed by the King, (and there is the like Reason in Reformation) and
<PB N="15" REF="002614_0017_0FDB759E07618AA8"/>as I conceive 'twas appointed by <HI>David</HI> not only as the Psal∣mist of <HI>Israel</HI> Inspired; but also as their Chief Ruler. The Persons to have the oversight thereof were the Levites. It is easie here to make the Application: but as to the Practi∣cal part, the Younger sort of Men under such a Superiour conduct, seem to be most fit to lead next. Their Voices are most agreable, and Inclinations stronger then Old Men's. And by the Scriptures it seems as if they were most Improved. <HI>Lam.</HI> 5.14. <HI>The Elders have ceased from the gate, the Young Men from their Musick.</HI> Which could not be meant of Wanton Songs, but Sacred Musick, otherwise it was not matter of Lamentation that they ceased. And as Old Men, in whom the Daughters of Musick are brought low, as in <HI>Eccle.</HI> 12 4. seem less capable, so they seem to be more Indisposed there∣unto, as good Old <HI>Barzillai</HI> said to King <HI>David</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 35. <HI>Can I hear any more the Voice of Singing-Men and Singing Women?</HI> These also were such as were Imployed in Singing the Songs of Sion, see <HI>Ezra.</HI> 2.65. and <HI>Neb.</HI> 7.67.</P>
<P>But I Proceed to the Second Use which is.</P>
<P>USE 2. Of LAMENTATION.</P>
<P>THAT Musick which in it self is Concord, Harmony, Melody, Sweetness, Charming even to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As Histories give an Account.</NOTE> Irrational Creatures; Chears the Spirits of Men, and tends to Raise them in De∣votion, and in the Praises of GOD, and was Instituted by GOD as a means of Divine Worship, which is a Terrour to<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 16 23.</NOTE> Evil Spirits, the Delight of the Holy Angels, and will be the Everlasting Imployment of those Seraphims, and the Glo∣ryfied Saints, should be an Occasion of Strife, Debate, Dis∣cord, Contention, Quarrelling and all manner of Disorder. That Men, the only Creatures in the Lower Creation, that are Accomplished with Reason and apt Organs to Praise GOD with should Improve them so to Dishonour Him; and that in stead of an Angelick Temper in Men, which they are capable of, and is Required of them, and Especially in this Matter; there should be Rather a Cynick Disposition, and an Improvement of such Noble Organs to Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, Snarl a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and Bite one another, that in Stead of one Heart and one Voice
<PB N="16" REF="002614_0018_0FDB75A384CAEDC0"/>in the Praises of our Glorious Creator, and Soveraign, Pre∣server, and Redeemer and most Bountiful Benefactor; there should be only Jangle and Discord, and Slurring and Re∣viling one another; that those Tongues with which we should Bless GOD, and speak kindly to, and of one another, should be Imployed to Curse Men, even our Neighbours and Brethren; <HI>this is, and shall be for a Lamentation.</HI> Now, altho' in the present Differences and Contentions about the Mode or Vocal Part of Psalmody, we must Conclude, and may believe, there is the busie hand of Satan Instigating People thereto, thereby to promote every other evil work; yet we must acknowledge the hand of GOD herein; and whether we are not thus lest to contend about the Superficial or Exteriour Part, as a Just Punishment of our Formality in the Duty of Singing is what calls for our Serious Consideration. And whether it be not a sad Sign that GOD is withdrawing His Presence and Glory from us, may also be considered. And whether, while we thus contend about the Vocal part of the Duty, there be not a Total Neglect of the Spiritual and Gracious parts and so instead of Glorifying GOD by offering Praise, as in <HI>Psalm</HI> 50. <HI>ult.</HI> we do not by our pre∣tended and only formal Praising of HIM greatly provoke Him to Anger?</P>
<P>USE 3. IS of Caution to those who are Improving fit Op∣portunities and means to Learn the Rules and Skill of Psal∣mody, that they, while they delight in the Voice of Singing, do not forget that which should be their main end, as in all other things, as 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.31. so especially in this, <HI>viz. The Glory of GOD:</HI> while you please your Selves with the Voice of Melody, Charming Concord, Harmony and Sweetness of Musick, you be not like the <HI>Organs</HI> in whose Pipes, thro' the help of Artificial Lungs, the Wind makes a Pleasant Sound; and being well Managed by a Skillful Hand, there is a Plea∣sing and Delightful Harmony, which yet is a Lifeless Instru∣ment, and it's Pipes are made of the Basest of Mettals. There is certainly something which you propound as your end in Learning to Sing, if it be not to make you the more capable in an agreable manner, to Sing the Praises of GOD, 'tis a wrong end. A Pleasant and Strong Voice with Ability to Modulate the same, is the Gift of GOD, and a Tallent that should be Improved to the Glory of his Name. And tho' the
<PB N="17" REF="002614_0019_0FDB75A4CB4573C8"/>Singing of Tunes is no part of Divine Worship, yet the Singing of Psalms in good Tunes will if Rightly Performed. Promote true Devotion, and the Persons thus Imployed, are Advantaged to a Devout Meditation on the Glorious Per∣fections of GOD, and the Glorious Harmony that there is in his Work of Creation and Providence; the Concordance of Sounds is a Representation of the rest of his Glorious Works, while the parts of Musick contained in or chiefly founded on a <HI>Trias</HI> of Notes of the greater Concords in Musick of a three∣fold Key, agreeing as one, are Significant Emblems of the Glorious and Incomprehensible Trinity. There is doubtless something of Zeal in your Hearts, while you ingage in these Exercises; O let it not with your Voice Evaporate in the Air! but while your Voices are lifted up and seem even to Reach the Clouds, let your Thoughts and Affections <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could higher; and like the Glorious Seraphims Flame wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to GOD, and with desires of obtaining and Admittance into that Holy Plaint, where these Glorious Seraphims. with the Glorifyed Saints Joyn, in one Caelestial Quire, to sing Ever∣lasting Hallelujah's, saying as in <HI>Rev.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 3. <HI>Blessing, Honour and Glory and Power be unto him that sitteth on the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>THE Last Use is of Exhortation to all Persons to Endeavour a Devout performance of the Duty of Singing of Psalms. As Skill is necessary to an agreable performance of the Exteriour or Vocal part, so Grace is much more necessary to a Right performance of the Interiour Spiritual part. It was the complaint of GOD concerning his People of Old, <HI>Isa.</HI> 29.13. <HI>This People draw nigh me with the Mouth and Honour me with the Lip, but their Hearts are far from me.</HI> It is to be feared, that as to a great Number of People among us (and especially in this time of Temptation) it may be said of their Singing, as the <HI>Phylos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pher</HI> said of the little Singing Bird, call'd the <HI>Nigh∣tingale, viz.</HI> that it was <HI>Vox et piaeteria inh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l.</HI> Voice and nothing else; their Throats like the Pipes of the <HI>Organs,</HI> being fill'd with Wind make a P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sant Sound, but their Hearts are no ways ingaged in the Praises of GOD Where 'tis thus it must needs be very displeasing to Him. Man's Heart is the object of GOD's Eye in an especial manner; and in all our Religious Performances, the Devotion of the Heart is Expected and Recalled: and in our Psalmody when we
<PB N="18" REF="002614_0020_0FDB75A64983D638"/>make a Joyful Noise, and Sing aloud, it must be unto the LORD, as in <HI>Psal</HI> 81.1. &amp; <HI>Psal.</HI> 95.1. &amp; 100.1. And when we Sing Skillfully, and so <HI>do well</HI> in Singing, it must, still be to the LORD, see <HI>Psal.</HI> 33.3. <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.19. &amp; <HI>Col.</HI> 3.16. GOD is the only Object of all Religious Worship, and Requires, as in <HI>John</HI> 4.24. <HI>That we worship him in Spirit and in truth.</HI> But when we give Him only the Service of the Lip, Throat or Voice, 'tis only a Mock Service and unwor∣thy so Glorious and Jealous a GOD, 'tis an high Affront to His Holy Majesty, and instend of an Offering or Service well pleasing to him, and whereby he may be Glorified, as <HI>Psal.</HI> 10. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt.</HI> It will highly provoke him to Anger, and ex. pose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b his Wrath and Indignation. As the Cries <HI>or Prayed of Israel,</HI> because <HI>Hypocritical,</HI> and not to GOD, are calse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ling, as in <HI>Hosea</HI> 7.14. so may our Singing be terr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when our Hearts are not ingaged in the Praises of GOD. Wherefore it highly concerns all Persons to Endea∣vour the Performance of this Duty in a Devour and Gracious manner: Singing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>the Lord</HI> with <HI>Grace</HI> in their Hearts, and so making Melody to Him. Whatever our Thoughts are as to the Mode or Vocal part, whether the Old, or the New way (as they are call'd) be most pleasing to us, it would be our Wisdom and a Manifestation of our Christiani∣ty-to deny our Selves, and <HI>our own obstinate wills,</HI> which are apparently the chief cause of Contention in these things, and Condescend (at least) so far one to the other, as to keep come alike <HI>i. e.</HI> to begin and end the lines all together, which if we did, there would not in most of the Tunes commonly Sung, be so wide a difference as is by some Imagined, many of the lines being near alike; if we all Sincerely Endeavour to Exercise Grace in Singing, and to perform the Vocal pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on the best manner we could, our Services would be accepted of GOD. And I doubt not but Regular Singing would soon have a better <HI>Relish</HI> with the most of our People, and be comply'd with, and so our differences would end in a good and lasting union, and our Jars &amp; Discords in a sweet and delightful Concord and Harmony. So let it be! <HI>Amen.</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.17. READER.</P>
