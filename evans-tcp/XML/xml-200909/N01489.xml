<HEAD>Pay thy Debts AND Live of the Rest.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>II. Kings IV.</HI> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</BIBL>
<P>Now there cryed a certain Woman of the Wives of the Sons of the Prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy Servant my Husband is dead, and thou knowest that thy Servant did fear the LORD: and the Creditor is come to take unto him my two Sons to be bond men.</P>
<P>And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine hand-maid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oyl.</P>
<P>Then he said, Go borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy Neighbours, even empty vessels, bor∣row not a few!</P>
<P>And when thou are come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee, and upon thy Sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, &amp; thou shalt set aside that which is full.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="001768_0005_0FB823AEAD927930"/>
So she went from him, and shut the door upon her, and upon her sons: who brought the vessels to her, and she powed out.</P>
<P>And it came to pass when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oyl stayed.</P>
<P>Then she came and told the man of God, and he said, Go, sell the oyl, and pay thy de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and live thou and thy children of the rest.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Words read consist of two general Parts; a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>plaint, and the Answer to it.</P>
<P N="1">1. We have the Pitiful complaint of a Poor distressed <HI>Widow,</HI> to the Prophet <HI>Elisha.</HI> She was a <HI>Prophets Widow;</HI> yet <HI>Poor in the World.</HI> Her <HI>Husband</HI> was a Good Man; yet he died in <HI>Debt,</HI> more than he was worth. Now, it seems, there was a Custom among the <HI>Jews,</HI> for Pa∣rents, who were Poor, and not able to <HI>Pay</HI> their <HI>Debts,</HI> to sell their Children to the <HI>Creditor</HI> for the <HI>Payment:</HI> Or, at least, the <HI>Creditor</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="001768_0006_0FB826265BF3F9B0"/>would take them as Bond-Servants, to Answer the <HI>Debt;</HI> taking Ad∣vantage of that <HI>Law,</HI> Exod. 21.2, 7. &amp; Lev. 25.39. Of which <HI>Law</HI> or <HI>Practice,</HI> a certain <HI>Creditor,</HI> here in our <HI>Text,</HI> was taking the Advan∣tage, and finding no Estate, was already <HI>come</HI> to take this <HI>Widows two Sons, as Bond-men.</HI> And to whom should the <HI>Widow of one of the Sons of the Prophets</HI> go, in her <HI>Distress,</HI> but to him that was a <HI>Fa∣ther</HI> to them, and Interested him∣self in the concerns of their Fami∣lies? To him therefore she Re∣pairs, who had also observed this Good Womans Deceased <HI>Husbands</HI> Piety in Particular; which is a <HI>Plea</HI> to enforce her <HI>Suit,</HI> v. 1.</P>
<P N="2">2. You may observe how rea∣dily, and with what Fatherly ten∣derness, the <HI>man of God</HI> receives the Complainant; and how Ef∣fectually he Relieves her <HI>Distress.</HI>

<ITEM>(2.) He puts her into a way how to get out of <HI>Debt;</HI> and make a comfortable Living; without Selling either of her <HI>Sons</HI> into <HI>Bon∣dage,</HI> v. 3. to the 7. Where you may observe yet more <HI>Particularly:</HI>

<P>But that which made her ready Obedience, Diligence and Exact∣ness in following the <HI>Direction</HI> gi∣ven, so valuable, was her <HI>Faith;</HI> it was the <HI>Obedience of Faith.</HI> She <HI>Believed, and therefore</HI> she thus acted.
<PB N="5" REF="001768_0008_0FB826298BD97668"/>She did not tell the <HI>Holy Man of God</HI> that he mocked her, in bidding her fill so many <HI>vessels</HI> out of one, and larger out of a lesser: but does as she is bidden, and leaves the suc∣cess to the Almighty. <HI>O Woman! Great was thy Faith!</HI> Nor is the <HI>Prophet's</HI> concern for a Poor Dis∣tressed <HI>Debtor,</HI> to be over looked, in the Doctrinal handling of the <HI>Text:</HI> for it is Exemplary.

<P><PB N="8" REF="001768_0011_0FB8262DB5F971A0"/>
<HI>It is so Represented by God, and found so to be, by Men.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Word of God sets it forth as a sad thing to be in Debt.</HI> Men of <HI>Broken Fortunes,</HI> are Men of <HI>Restless Spirits;</HI> put to their Shifts, and not knowing what to do: 1 Sam 22.2. <HI>And every one that was in Debt, and every one that was Discontented ga∣ther themselves unto him; and be be∣came a Captain over them: And there were with him about four hundred Men.</HI> 'Tis to be fear'd, These did not at first follow <HI>David,</HI> because he was <HI>a Man after Gods own heart:</HI> but as an Enteprizing Souldier, and Self banished Wanderer; One whose Case appeared <HI>Desperate;</HI> A sit Leader, as they thought, for Desperate <HI>Debtors.</HI> And they were willing to go seek their Fortune with him in the howling Wilder∣ness, on desolate Mountains; in Dens and Caves of the Earth, and among wild Beasts, tho' they
<PB N="9" REF="001768_0012_0FB8262F58FDEF18"/>knew also that the W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath of the King would pursue them: For they feared no <HI>Man</HI> no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Beast,</HI> so much as their angry <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tors.</HI> In that <HI>Parable</HI> also of a <HI>certain King,</HI> (Mat. 18.23—) <HI>Who would take account of his Servants;</HI> does our LORD set forth the sad <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>exities,</HI> and woful <HI>Consequents</HI> or being in <HI>Debt;</HI> For, <HI>When he had began <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Reckon, one was brought unto him which ought him ten thousand Talents. But for as much as he had not to Pay, his Lord commanded him to be Sold, and his Wife and Children and all that he had, and Payment to be made. The Servant therefore fell down and Wor∣shipped him, Saying, Lord, have Pati∣ence with me, and I will Pay thee all.</HI>— Here we have one <HI>Debtor</HI> in a la∣mentable Plight; and, Presently, an other in a worse; for the <HI>Cre∣ditor laid hands on him, and took him by the Throat, Saying, Pay me what thou owest.</HI>— Nor could this mi∣serable
<PB N="10" REF="001768_0013_0FB82634806906B8"/><HI>Debtor,</HI> tho' it was no great matter he <HI>Owed,</HI> find the least <HI>Compassion,</HI> or prevail for an Hours <HI>For bearance;</HI> but to <HI>Prison</HI> he must! and lie in <HI>Goal</HI> till <HI>Payment</HI> be made! Then, in the last Place (For not being concerned, here, with the main Scope of the <HI>Parable,</HI> I con∣sider not the Connexion: I say, in the third and last Place) the Case of the <HI>Debtor</HI> is most <HI>Forlorn:</HI>— He is delivered to the <HI>Tormentors,</HI>— v. 34.</P>
<P>And thus, both in the <HI>Old Testa∣ment</HI> and the <HI>New,</HI> is the <HI>Case</HI> of a <HI>Debtor</HI> Represented as sad and la∣mentable, by God Himself; who al∣so, frequently calls the worst thing in the World, by this Name; even our <HI>Sin,</HI> Forgive us our <HI>Debts,</HI> Mat. 6.12.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Such as are deeply in Debt, do feelingly La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent the sadness of their Case.</HI> They must needs do so, un∣less they are <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oast feeling.</HI> What
<PB N="11" REF="001768_0014_0FB8263719687C70"/>their Self-bemoaning <HI>Complaints</HI> are, when they sit or walk alone; or as they lie musing on their Beds, we can't tell: Nor do we hear the Words of their Mind, when they talk with themselves, in a Multi∣tude of short Parentheses, which interrupt not the sense of their dai∣ly Converse, in Conversation, at Home and Abroad. But, to their <HI>Familiars,</HI> they must, some times, ease their <HI>burdened Spirits:</HI> and from others they cannot always hide the <HI>Perturbations</HI> that are within.</P>
<P>He did not express his own <HI>Sen∣timents</HI> only, whom I have heard thus bewailing his <HI>Case;</HI> <Q>How happy should I think my self, (said the Good Gentleman) were I in the <HI>Case</HI> of the Plainest Me∣chanick, or Day-labourer, that eats his own Bread, having Swea∣ted for it; and then sweetly falls a sleep on his Flock-Bed, or per∣haps Straw-Bed, and awakes a∣gain
<PB N="12" REF="001768_0015_0FB8263824516CA0"/>at Liberty, fearing no Of∣ficers Approach, nor <HI>Creditors</HI> un∣answerable Demands: While I am perplexed, cruciated and dis∣tracted, on the Wreck of my own Tumultuary Thoughts.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Fore-cast and Circumspecti∣on of Others to shun this Infelicity; together with the Self-denial they Practice, and the hard Shifts they make to keep themselves clear of Debts and Bonds; is a further Evidence that this Doctrine is True:</HI> So that without so much as naming the many <HI>Temp∣tations</HI> that accompany, and the long Train of <HI>sad Consequents</HI> that follow this Pernicious Guest, once Admitted and Entertained in our House. I pass to the <HI>Application.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. USE. <HI>To be Out of Debt then is Matter of Thankfulness.</HI> In that,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This Freedom is, in it self, a Rich Enjoyment of Life, and attended with many Advantages.</HI> Tho' a
<PB N="13" REF="001768_0016_0FB8263BDE784EE8"/>Man has but a <HI>Competency,</HI> necessa∣ry Food and Raiment, plain and homely fare, but still his <HI>own;</HI> 'tis <HI>Comfortable;</HI> 'tis <HI>Honourable.</HI> And when, by the Blessing of God on the Diligence of his Hand, and Fru∣gal Management, (For <HI>his God doth Instruct him</HI> how to <HI>order his Af∣fairs with Discretion</HI>) he has some∣thing to spare, he can give of his <HI>Own</HI> to the Poor; whiles such as are deeply in <HI>Debt,</HI> and with-hold from the <HI>Creditor</HI> his <HI>Due,</HI> can but give away another Mans <HI>Goods</HI> without his leave; so not, therein, <HI>Lend to the Lord,</HI> who <HI>hates Robber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for an Offering:</HI> But will Repay the truly <HI>Charitable;</HI> and make him still more and more able to do Good in his Generation; which is the most Desirable thing in the World: <HI>I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice.</HI> Yea, the Disentangled Christian is at Liberty for both; He can also <HI>Wait on the Lord without Distraction,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="001768_0017_0FB8263EDE6CD950"/>in the Publick and Private Duties of Religion; and <HI>in his Patience Possess his Soul.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>These and all the other happy Fruits of this Exempt Case, are owing to the Lord, in continual Returns of Gratitude.</HI> For, is it not the <HI>Lord</HI> who gives all, and secures what He gives; stops up the <HI>Leaks</HI> in our <HI>Estates,</HI> and preserves us, not only from Ill-handling by others; but ev'n from the Ill-husbandry of our own Hands: who also Exempts us from Impoverishing <HI>Afflictions,</HI> or pays all Charges, and makes up our <HI>Losses.</HI> Now, all Thanks are owing to God for this; and if we <HI>Sacrifice to our own Nets,</HI> with-hold∣ing from the Lord His <HI>Due;</HI> How soon may we put Him upon Re∣covering His Glory by <HI>Distraint</HI> and making us to know the worth of such a Favour, by the want of it.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="15" REF="001768_0018_0FB8264070959770"/>
II. USE. <HI>By way of Cautionary Direction; Particularly to Young Be∣ginners in the World: That they care∣fully shun a thing so sad and lamenta∣ble.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Shun, therefore, Bad Company and Idleness.</HI> Company-keeping will both Morally and Efficiently, Meritoriously and Effectually Un∣doe you, Much Time slips away in Ill Company, wherein nothing is gotten, and much is also spent; the Gains of what time has been profitably improved: A Mans bu∣siness, the mean while, suffering not a little, for want of his <HI>Eye</HI> as well as <HI>Hand:</HI> And many a Rash thing done, when the Brain is hea∣ted, and the Heart made foolish: The Soul and Gods Glory all the while neglected, &amp; much Sin com∣mitted; and so, impoverishing Judgements &amp; blasting Strokes Pro∣cured: For God has not only fore∣told Vain <HI>Company-keepers</HI> what such
<PB N="16" REF="001768_0019_0FB8264213C76290"/>a Course will bring them to; but also threatned what He will bring upon them. Prov. 6.6,—11. <HI>Go to the Ant, thou sluggard, confider her wayes, and be wise; which having no guide, overseer or ruler, provideth her meat in the Summer.— How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise—? Yet a little sleep, a lit∣tl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep. So shall thy Poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</HI> Certainly, tho' sometimes, slowly, and alwayes ir∣resistibly. <HI>Be not among Wine-bib∣bers, among riotous eaters of flesh. For the Drunkard &amp; the Glutton shall come to Poverty, and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags,</HI> Prov. 23.20, 21. Chap. 28.19. <HI>He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: But he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.</HI> Now the Event shall make appear which shall stand; the <HI>Word of God</HI> or the idle <HI>Company∣keepers</HI> vain Hope.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="17" REF="001768_0020_0FB8264704FF2CC0"/>
2. <HI>Proportion your Expences, to your Ability; Your layings Out, to your In∣comes.</HI> Cut your Coat according to your Cloth: You must not make a Delicate Appetite, an ambitious Mind, or others Example (who have great Estates, or little Pru∣dence, and less Conscience) the <HI>Rule,</HI> by which to measure your Garb, and House-keeping. No Man should desire to seem Richer or more Honourable than he really is; nor lavish out for the Present, What, hereafter, he shall wish, in his Necessities, he had reserved for his Relief. It's safest to under do: Store is no sore. Losses, Disap∣poinments, &amp; Sickness may come; or Charges, otherwise grow on the Family. Be therefore very <HI>Frugal:</HI> Get what may be gotten; Save what may be sav'd: <HI>Gather up the Fragments which remain, that nothing be lost,</HI> Joh. 6.12. Mind that Word,— <HI>That Nothing
<PB N="18" REF="001768_0021_0FB8264A08E38B10"/>be Lost.</HI> There is more in it than many ever did well consider. It is the <HI>Word</HI> of Him that shall <HI>Judge</HI> us all; and the <HI>Word</HI> by which the Wastful Person &amp; Spend∣thrifts shall be Judged and Con∣demned: Joh. 12.48.—<HI>The Words that I have spoken shall Judge him in the last Day.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Depend not on Probable Gains or Increase, as if they were Certain:</HI> Say not, My <HI>Trade</HI> will bring me in so much a Week, and that is so much a Year; for thou mayest be taken off by Sickness to Morrow, or Lameness the next Day, or on the Third, by Distraction, Temp∣tation, Corporal Blindness; or any one of a Thousand other wayes, in which <HI>Purposes are broken off.</HI> Sum not up, then, your Winters Work before the Spring. Reckon not on <HI>full Barns</HI> at Harvest, as soon as thou hast emptied thy <HI>Sacks</HI> in the Field. Leave also the Gain
<PB N="19" REF="001768_0022_0FB8264C635C69F8"/>of thy Merchandize to the Dispo∣sal of <HI>Providence:</HI> Then you will in Purchasing, Building, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> con∣sider what you have in <HI>Hand</HI> (or as Good as in Possession) not what you have only in <HI>Hope;</HI> and so, rather keep within Bounds, then venture to the utmost Verge of your Ability: This is to <HI>sit down, and count the Cost,</HI> Luke 14.28.</P>
<P N="3">III. USE. Is it sad! sad! to be in <HI>Mans Debt,</HI> and owe a little <HI>Money?</HI> What is it then, to be in <HI>GOD's Debt,</HI> and exposed to the <HI>Arrest</HI> of Divine Justice for the Mil∣lions of Millions that you <HI>Owe</HI> your Great <HI>Creditor,</HI> into whose Re∣venging hands you have forfeited your Lives and Souls; Yea, being Unbelievers, you are Cast and <HI>Condemned already,</HI> Joh. 3.18.

<P N="2">2. <HI>This Evil is not only and alto∣gether of the Lord.</HI> His <HI>Providence</HI> is Sportless; but our <HI>Improvidence</HI> is not so: We are, often-times, the Faulty Gauses of our Miserable Entanglements.

1. USE. <HI>For double Caution:</HI> That we neither Asperse the <HI>Providence of God;</HI> nor Rashly Censure our <HI>Neighbour.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We may not Presently Conclude our Neighbour either Deserted of God, or guilty in himself, because we see him Behind-hand in the World, fallen into Decay; in Debt and Insolvent:</HI> Re∣membring that this was the very <HI>Case</HI> of <HI>One</HI> that feared God above many, and was Noted for his <HI>Piety;</HI> ev'n this <HI>Son of the Prophets,</HI> and Child of God.</P>
<P>Are not the Circumstances of some Persons Peculiar?. They have more Chargeable <HI>Families,</HI> and yet a less Profitable <HI>Calling</HI> then many others; at least, their <HI>Trading</HI> brings them in but small <HI>Gains:</HI> and, Perhaps, they never had the Advantage of being before-hand, or so much as clear of <HI>Debt,</HI> to keep so.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Yet must we not lay all on Pro∣vidence;</HI> that so we may conceal, excuse or extenuate our own Im∣prudence: Imprudence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and Negligence too, if not Extrava∣gance, is sometimes to be charged home on a Man's Self; tho' he be otherwise Godly, in the Main.</P>

1. You have no other <HI>Spot,</HI> but that <HI>of Gods Children:</HI> Yea, How can you forbear Rejoycing?</P>
<P>Knowing,</P>
<P N="2">2. That your Spiritual <HI>Debts,</HI> to the Law of Works, are all <HI>Paid</HI> by the <HI>Surety of a better Covenant;</HI> and you <HI>Owe</HI> not one Farthing to Re∣venging Justice. There is still a <HI>Debt</HI> of Gratitude; but <HI>Christ</HI> our Universal <HI>Sponsor,</HI> stands bound for the Discharge of that also. And, <HI>Who,</HI> now, <HI>shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that Justifyeth: Who is he that Condem∣neth? It is Christ that died; yea ra∣ther that is risen again; who is even at the Right Hand of God; who also maketh Intercession for us,</HI> Rom. 8.33, 34. Does the World accuse? Does Conscience accuse? Does Satan accuse; Yea; Does the Righteous <HI>Law,</HI> or Divine Justice it self accuse? Your Answer is Ready: Tis but turning to <HI>Christ</HI>

<P>There is yet another Word of <HI>Consolation,</HI> for Poor <HI>Debtors;</HI> It is this: 3. That seeing God brings His Own into <HI>Debt;</HI> doubtless there is good to be gotten by such a Dispensation of <HI>Providence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In general;</HI> Its one of the Wayes by which God will <HI>Humble His</HI> People, <HI>and Prove them, that He may do them Good in their Latter End.</HI> This Thorny Way proves a Right Way to some, unto the <HI>Heavenly Canaan:</HI> Gods choice makes it so; for it is not a thing by us to be chosen.

The <HI>Rule</HI> I have mentioned is founded in Natural Reason: 'Tis one half of the <HI>Moral Law:</HI> Most Evident to the <HI>Light of Nature:</HI> So that if
<PB N="30" REF="001768_0033_0FB8266847509AB8"/>I were Reading a Lecture of <HI>Me∣ral Philosophy,</HI> in a School of <HI>Ethnicks,</HI> I must needs gain this Self-evident Point on their <HI>Consciences.</HI> But if it needs further Sanction from the Gospel, Christ has not been wan∣ting to Enforce it: Mat. 7.12. <HI>Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.</HI> And truly, if the Laws of this Province are the Result of Reason &amp; Wisdom, as well as Power and Authority, in our Councillors and other Le∣gislators; then it follows from the Law-Book (not only from the Book of the <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Gospel</HI>). That every Man ought Voluntarily to <HI>Pay</HI> his <HI>Debts;</HI> which else those Laws will Exact of him.</P>
<P>It may be further Argued; If it be our Duty readily to Lend, freely to Give away, and to help Others out of <HI>Debt</HI> (as in some
<PB N="31" REF="001768_0034_0FB82669AEBE9550"/>Cases, it is, <HI>Deut.</HI> 15.7. <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.42. <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b.</HI> 4.28.) Then, no doubt, it is our Duty to <HI>Pay</HI> where we <HI>Owe,</HI> and Discharge our own <HI>Debts.</HI> Again; If Borrowing of our Neighbour (as the <HI>Empty Vessels,</HI> in our Text were borrowed) only for present use, we are obliged, in Justice as well as Gratitude, to Return what we have so Borrow∣ed; because, tho' we had a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight given as of using yet the right and property of the thing is still in the Lender: Hence it follows that we are equally bound to Pay what we have Ingaged; because the Sum or Matter of the Ingagement is really his, whose <HI>Debtor</HI> we are.

<PB N="44" REF="001768_0047_0FB8268707636738"/>did the Doubting <HI>Israelites</HI> say, (and are not we their Natural Brethren in Unbelief?) Psal. 78.19 <HI>Can God furnish a Table in the [Wilderness?]</HI> When they were in <HI>Egypt</HI> they had not call'd it in Question; And when they should get into the Plen∣tiful Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> they Questi∣on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not but they should be Pro∣vided for: But, <HI>Can God furnish a Table</HI> (with <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esh</HI>) <HI>in the Welderness?</HI> If we Question not the Power of God; How is it that when Means seem to Fail, our Hearts &amp; Hopes sail too? As if Omnipotence could not do as much for us by small, as greater Means; and work as well without as with Means; yea, quite above and contrary to Means. <HI>If thou canst believe,</HI> said Christ to One who requested of him to <HI>Help,</HI> if He could, <HI>Mark</HI> 9.22, 23. After this Example then (for so far the Fa∣ther of the Dumb Child was right)
<PB N="45" REF="001768_0048_0FB8268861ADEAF0"/>let us Weep for our <HI>Unbelief,</HI> and cry first to have Help there; and then it shall be to us according to our <HI>Faith.</HI></P>
<P>But you confess that you Doubt of Gods Willingness to help you out of <HI>Debt;</HI> and what Reason for that? Is not God your <HI>Father?</HI> And has not His Christ put an Ar∣gument into your Mouth, where∣with to Plead with Him? Mat. 7.11. <HI>If ye, being Evil, know how to give good Gifts to your Children; how much more shall your Heavenly Father give good things to them that ask him.</HI> But more of this under the next <HI>Doctrine.</HI> I shall only add here; that He has once helped you out of <HI>Debt,</HI> when you owed more than all this Visible World is worth, and had not one Farthing to <HI>Pay;</HI> and that in a way that no Man or An∣gel cou'd have tho't of; at a Price which a Thousand Worlds could not Equal, in Condescentions Un∣parallel'd,
<PB N="46" REF="001768_0049_0FB8268A53727460"/>and infinitely above all Comparison; and all unasked: Now, <HI>having given us Christ; How shall be not with him also freely give us all things?</HI> Rom. 8.32. <HI>For ye know the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that tho' he was Rich, yet, for your s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kes, he became Poor, that ye, thro' his Poverty, might he Rich.</HI> And after all this, can we <HI>Question</HI> His Readi∣ness to Help us in our Temporal Straits? Did He Empty His Trea∣sures, and go to Prison for us; and <HI>give his Back to the Smiters,</HI> and en∣dure Hell-Torment, in His Con∣science, for us: and can He, after all, deny that Relief we need; which is as easy to Him as a words Speaking, or the turn of a Hand.</P>
<P N="2">II.

Now here is what will ef∣fectually Salve all; <HI>God has laid help upon One who is Mighty to Save-Christ is able to Save to the Uttermost. It has pleased the Father that in him should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Ful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss dwell. And him that

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>V. DOCT.</HI> We may not expect Help from GOD, but as we follow His Direction, in the Use of all Proper Means.</HEAD>

2. <HI>If more can be done, in any Law∣ful and Expedient Way; we must not spare any Tho't, Pains, or Petience.</HI></P>
<P>Reason 1. <HI>God does not Help in Spiritual Cases (where me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can do less) but by Means to be used by us:</HI> For, tho' <HI>He worketh in us to will and to do, of his good pleasure;</HI> yet must we <HI>Work out our own Salvation with Fear and Trembling.</HI></P>
<P>Reas. 2. <HI>This also is His usual Way in all Temporal Cases,</HI> 1 Chron. 22.16, <HI>Arise therefore and be Doing, and the Lord be with thee.</HI> The Scriptures do abound with Examples to this Purpose, as much as in any one thing, that can readily be named. <HI>Jacob</HI> was industrious, and God <HI>blessed</HI> him. <HI>Do Good—and verily thou shalt be fed. Work with your Hands</HI> and ye shall be <HI>Supplied, and have where with to help others:</HI> Yea, and even in <HI>Miracles,</HI> that are Gods Work Peculiarly, Man must com∣monly do something, all that is
<PB N="50" REF="001768_0053_0FB8269544CB91D0"/>within his compass: <HI>Lift up thy Rod: Speak to the Rock: Stretch forth thy hand over she Sea, and divide it: Prophesie to the Wind: Stretch forth thy [withered] hand.</HI> And when Christ had so many Thousand to feed and fill by <HI>Miracle;</HI> yet,— <HI>Bring me the five loaves and two fishes.</HI> So in the Instance of our <HI>Text;</HI> God does not make Money of the Stones, or Monies worth of No∣thing; but increaseth the <HI>Pot of Oyl,</HI> which the <HI>Poor Debtor had in the House;</HI> and she and her <HI>Sons</HI> must be busily employed, in doing all that can be done by them. Then, lastly, to the very <HI>Case</HI> of Approving our selves honest in <HI>Paying</HI> our <HI>Debts:</HI> See 1 Thes. 4.11, 12.—<HI>Do your own Business— work with your hands (as we com∣manded you) that ye may walk bonest∣ly— and have back of nothing.</HI></P>
<P>Reas. 3. <HI>Otherwise God should seem to indulge Negligence when He requires
<PB N="51" REF="001768_0054_0FB82697242D0C20"/>Diligence; and so be Divided against Himself.</HI> It is the <HI>Diligent Hand</HI> that gathers in, because its works are <HI>blessed:</HI> Nor has the <HI>Blessing</HI> of God (tho' His Common Providence may) ever enriched, either the <HI>folded hand;</HI> or the hand stretched out in Deceit and Oppression.</P>
<P>And now, (not any further, and more <HI>Particularly</HI> to add, how it's most for Gods Glory, and Mans Good, we should help our selves, that God may help us) Before I <HI>Improve</HI> this, I would <HI>Doctrinally</HI> speak also to the next <HI>Point;</HI> and then <HI>Apply</HI> them together.</P>

I. USE. <HI>What we have heard un∣der this last Doctrine, Reproves two Sorts of Persons.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Such as are so far from having put on, as the Elect of God, Bowels of Mercy; that they have even put off Humanity it self, and show no Com∣passion to their Fellow Creatures, how Miserable so ever they are Circumstan∣ced; though, in all Probability, next door to utter Ruine.</HI> These care for none but themselves. And be∣cause they are Resolf'd to Contri∣bute nothing towards the Relief of any; They make one <HI>General Sentence</HI> in the <HI>Judgment of Uncha∣ritableness,</HI> to serve Indifferently for all <HI>Poor Distr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed Debtors;</HI> Either they are Foolish, or Prodigal; or else their seeming Honesly and Prety is but a Cover for their Hy∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and some hidden Iniqui∣ty has B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asted their Ettare: When, its very likely, God is but trying

<P N="2">2. <HI>They also are worthy of Rebuke, whi are Guilty of Foolish and Ruinous Pity on the other Hand.</HI> These would have the Distressed Help'd in their Estates to the Hazzard of their Souls; Or put in a way to Advance their <HI>Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate</HI> Interest, tho' never so much to the Prejudice and Disadvantage of the <HI>Publick.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>As if they sought themselves only.</HI> Indeed they had need look well to their End; <HI>Otherwise they have no Reward of their Heavenly Father:</HI> But How can I <HI>Judge</HI> of another Mans Principles &amp; Ends?

<P N="2">2. <HI>As if they Endangered their E∣states.</HI> And here, truly needs all the <HI>Precaution</HI> Imaginable. And I had need Repeat to you that <HI>Can∣tion of Wisdom,</HI> Prov. 22.26, 27. <HI>Be not thou one of them that strike Hands, or of them that are Sureties for Debts.

<P N="1">(1.) <HI>That we Venture not so much, as that the loss of is should Ruine us.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>That we Venture not at all, where there is not a Probability at least, of Attaining some good</HI> End.

<HEAD>General Application.</HEAD>
<PB N="94" REF="001768_0097_0FB826F828694A88"/>
<P N="1">1. <HI>If you bring not what you have Heard Home upon your Consciences, it cannot Answer the End Proposed.</HI> There must be a Personal <HI>Applica∣tion</HI> of what has been Spoken: <HI>Conscience</HI> must be very Plain, and say to whom it may Concern, <HI>Thou art the Man.</HI> Thus and thus thou hast Done: This and that thou hast to do: Herein <HI>Deny thy Self;</HI> therein beware of the <HI>Temp∣ter.</HI> This is laying &amp; binding the <HI>Plaister</HI> on the <HI>Sore,</HI> the <HI>Wound</HI> be∣ing search'd; and this is taking down the <HI>Pills,</HI> one after another; which is a good Step towards a <HI>Cure:</HI> but if the <HI>Plaister</HI> stick not, or the <HI>Pills</HI> be only chewed, and spit out, because they are Bitter; what good can either do? Nor is this enough; for, (to follow the <HI>Metaphor</HI>) besides the Renewed
<PB N="95" REF="001768_0098_0FB826F9E4FFE0C8"/>Application of Proper <HI>Medicines;</HI> Abstinence from hurtful Meats, Drinks or Fruits; and all care to avoid taking Cold: And in some Cases Wakefulness and much Ex∣ercise: I say besides all this, which requires that the <HI>Patient</HI> be <HI>Active</HI> also; there must, in Our <HI>Mystical Cure,</HI> be Constant Tho'tfulness, and a Mind rightly disposed. <HI>Physick</HI> will work whether you think of it or not; <HI>Balsome</HI> will, by its innate, sanative Quality, <HI>Heal</HI> the Flesh; tho' the Heart be set against God and His Church; and the wound∣ed Man desires to be made whole, only that he may shew his Enmi∣ty to both, by renewing the Fight: But in the Present Case Faith and Sincerity are necessary Ingredi∣ents; for who will ever stop his Ears against the Dictates of <HI>Carnal Reason,</HI> (which are so Contradicto∣ry to the <HI>Directions</HI> given) till the <HI>Wisdom of the Fleshly Mind</HI> be
<PB N="96" REF="001768_0099_0FB823B64B1D94C0"/>brought into Subjection to <HI>Faith,</HI> and before the <HI>Single Eye</HI> of Since∣rity discover the Light of Spiritual Reason, in the <HI>Methods</HI> of <HI>Divine Wisdom,</HI> fetched out of the Sacred Dispensatory of the <HI>Scriptures.</HI> A Compound of <HI>Scripture mixed with Faith that Works by Love,</HI> and <HI>Honest Simplicity with Godly Sincerity,</HI> is a <HI>Receipt</HI> that has never once fail'd.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Make Conscience of Something else, or you'l never trouble your Con∣sciences much about Paying your Debts.</HI> Indeed God may begin here, and <HI>Convince</HI> the Sinner of Unrighte∣ousness towards his Neighbour, so leading him up, by this one <HI>Stream,</HI> to the <HI>Fountain</HI> of all Impiety &amp; In∣iquity: But you must <HI>Examine your selves whether you be in the Faith;</HI> The <HI>Spirit Convinces</HI> of the <HI>Sin</HI> of Unbelief, <HI>Job.</HI> 16.9. Come to an <HI>Accompt</HI> with your Self first, about your Spiritual <HI>Debts,</HI> and then
<PB N="97" REF="001768_0100_0FB823B02D343848"/><HI>Reckon</HI> with God thro' Christ: The <HI>Credit</HI> God has given Him, on His <HI>Book,</HI> over against the Belie∣ving Penitent's former Large and Black <HI>Accompt,</HI> is infinitely more than sufficient to <HI>Ballance</HI> all. And in a Word, Make <HI>Conscience,</HI> hence forward, of Discharging Duty to∣wards God, your Neighbour, and your own Souls, in Every thing; or you are truly <HI>Conscientious,</HI> with Godly Sincerity, in Nothing.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>On Supposition that your Case is not Reached, as to some Singular Cir∣cumstances of it, in any thing that has been said; It seems Advisable that you make it a Case of Conscience; and lay it Speedily before some Able Divine; and Skilfull Casuist, for an Answer.</HI> But this is spoken on <HI>Presumption</HI> also that you are willing to <HI>Know</HI> and <HI>Do</HI> your Duty. Otherwise I must further Reason with you out of the Scriptures. <HI>Know you not,</HI>
<PB N="98" REF="001768_0101_0FB823B1E2E39848"/>(saith the Apostle) <HI>that the Un∣righteous shall not Inherit the Kingdom of God?</HI> What is all our Out-side show of Religion, and seeming. Devotion towards God worth, if we are Unjust and Dishonest in our Dealings with Man? <HI>What doth it Profit, my Brethren, tho' a man say be has Faith, and have not Works, Can Faith Save him?</HI> Good God!
