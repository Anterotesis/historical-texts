<HEAD>TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF my Charge.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Do here present you with that <HI>Discourse</HI> which I delivered unto you, upon the <HI>Occasion</HI> of the <HI>Death</HI> of One of your <HI>Contempora∣ries</HI> by that fatal Sickness (as we supposed) of the <HI>Throat-Distemper;</HI> and which you so earnestly desired might be made Publick.</P>
<P>I must confess, that it was with some <HI>Diffi∣culty,</HI> I brought my self to be willing to suffer this Discourse to appear in Print, as thinking, that it wanted many <HI>Ornaments,</HI> to render it acceptable, nor was well eno' <HI>Labour'd</HI> to be made publick; and there were already many
<PB N="ii" REF="004829_0004_100DFCF90165B250"/>Exhortations to early Piety published, done by able Hands, after whose, I might be asham'd, that mine should be read.</P>
<P>But then, when I considered the particular <HI>Occasion</HI> and <HI>Circumstances</HI> of this Discourse, I was fain to own it was yours; and dare not deny you the Use and Improvement of it. It was at your <HI>Motion</HI> &amp; <HI>Desire,</HI> that at <HI>that Time,</HI> I made a Discourse to you: The Circum∣stances of the Time were such, that I could not but be pleased with the Motion; it seem'd as if there was the Hand of Heaven in it; I could not but think my self obliged from Duty to comply with the Motion. And as God was pleased to make the Discourse <HI>Acceptable</HI> to you, and you still asked my Consent for the Publication of it, <HI>for your further Use and Im∣provement,</HI> it seem'd as if Providence made it my Duty, still to comply: I could not con∣sider my self as your Servant, in the Cause of Christ and your Souls, and not own my Ob∣ligation to gratify You.</P>
<P>Such therefore, as it is, a Serious, Plain Discourse, designed for the Benefit <HI>of Youthful Auditors,</HI> destitute of the Ornaments of a beautiful Stile or any well studied Method, it is offered unto you.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="004829_0004_100DFCF90165B250"/>
And, as you have desired the Publication of it <HI>for your Benefit,</HI> so I hope, you will consider, that I may, justly expect from you, a serious Improvement of it; and, if you make not a good Use of it, may charge you with In∣consistency, and re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kon my self abused by you, as well as be disappointed in all the Hope and Encouragement I had of seeing you excited to early Piety.</P>
<P>Nor may you think, that you make any good Use of such a serious Warning and Ex∣hortation, as this is, if you indulge your selves in Youthful Vanities and Sins, put off the Work of Repentance till a Hereafter, and still live without God in the World, — Impeni∣tent and Unconverted.</P>
<P>GOD forbid then, that any of You, who have <HI>Ʋrged</HI> the Publication of this for your <HI>Improvement,</HI> as tho' you were resolved to make a good Use of it, should still, after the Reading of it, be found walking in the Ways of a car∣nal Heart, pleasing your selves in the danger∣ous Paths of Sin, saying, <HI>You shall have Peace, though you walk in the Imagination of your Hearts, to add</HI> Sin to Sin.</P>
<P>I have one Thing to add by way of <HI>Caution, viz.</HI> That you take Heed of saying, that <HI>the
<PB N="iv" REF="004829_0005_100DFCFB55DB46A0"/>Bitterness of Death is past,</HI> and the Danger over, <HI>because the seared Distemper,</HI> since the Death of the justly remembred Youth, who was taken from us, <HI>hath not prevailed among us.</HI> For if GOD is gracious and spares a little while, are You sure, he will spare for ever? Are you sure that, if GOD seeth you hardening your selves, the Distemper shall not be sent again? Is it not possible, that GOD be provoked to give a new Commission to the destroying An∣gel? Or, will not the affrighting Sickness at∣tend GOD's sovereign Order, and go when and where he bids it? Or, if you shall not be visited with this Sickness, hath GOD no other Judgments, with which to plead against secure and provoking Sinners? Have you never known a Young Person hastened from among the Living, to the Number of the Dend by any other Sickness? Hath GOD but one way <HI>to punish the Inhabitants of the Earth?</HI> If GOD shall not make your outward Man a Theatre of any remarkable Plagues &amp; wasting Sorrows, yet, are you sure, he will not inflict many spi∣ritual Miseries upon your Souls? Or, are not spiritual Plagues as formidable, as those that are inflicted upon the Body? If an offended GOD gives you over for incorrigible, punishes you with Hardness of Heart, and saith, <HI>Why should you be stricken any more?</HI> Would not this be sad and amazing?</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="004829_0005_100DFCFB55DB46A0"/>
Answer these Quaeries so as to discover any Knowlege or Reason, and you will see, that you are never out of Danger, till lodged under the Wings of the ALMIGHTY.</P>
<P>I add no more, but my sincere <HI>Wish,</HI> &amp; <HI>Prayer</HI> unto Almighty GOD, that this weak Endea∣vour may be blessed to the saving Advantage of your Souls, and you <HI>by this and other Means</HI> under the Powerful Presence and Influence of the Holy Spirit, may be perswaded to an <HI>early Choice of,</HI> and <HI>stedfast adherence to</HI> the Ways of Religion; that so you may be a pious and a happy Generation; <HI>hoping for,</HI> and <HI>earnestly de∣siring your Remembrance of me always</HI> in your Prayers,</P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>ISHALL not make any <HI>Apology</HI> here, for <HI>Appearing</HI> thus in <HI>Publick,</HI> nor any <HI>Excuse</HI> for my <HI>Method, Weakness, Deficiencies, &amp;c.</HI> I only purpose to give a brief <HI>Account</HI> of the <HI>Oc∣casion</HI> of it; which a Stranger will find alluded to in the Discourse, but not be thoroughly acquainted with.</P>
<P>He must be a Stranger indeed in these Parts of the World, who hath not heard of the <HI>Desolations</HI> made in sundry Parts of the Country, by that Distemper, that is usually called, The <HI>Throat-Distemper.</HI></P>
<P>Near Five Years ago, we in this Parish were <HI>Visited</HI> with the same; and sundry very pleasant and hopeful Young Persons were taken away.</P>
<P>Since which Time, we have had an Account of more <HI>awful Desolations</HI> made by it, in many <HI>Other Places.</HI></P>
<P>Near the Latter End of <HI>July</HI> last, a very hope∣ful, serious and likely Young Person, Named
<PB REF="004829_0006_100DFCFCFB19C6A8"/><HI>Prudence Bishop,</HI> the Eldest Daughter of Mr. <HI>John Bishop,</HI> was taken <HI>Sick</HI> amongst us; At first indeed, we hoped, that her Sickness might be only a hard Cold, a common sore Throat attended with a Feaver, Or the Effects of the Rash, as we called a Distemper, that was then among us.</P>
<P>But her Sickness presently increased, and she was brought into uncommon Difficulty and Distress. The justly <HI>Famous and well known Physician</HI> of these Parts was consulted; who judged her <HI>Sickness</HI> to be the <HI>Throat-Distemper.</HI> And to be short, the Distemper made <HI>Quick</HI> Work and carried her off, <HI>August 2d,</HI> and her Corps was interred on Lords-Day, <HI>August 3d.</HI></P>
<P>This Young Person gave us Ground to hope, that the Lord had been merciful to her Soul; begun and carried on a good Work of Grace in her: so that we could hope, that <HI>for ther to die was Gain:</HI> But then, it seem'd a dark <HI>Omen</HI> to the <HI>Living,</HI> and a loud <HI>Warning</HI> to our <HI>Surviving</HI> Youth <HI>to be also ready.</HI></P>
<P>Before this happened, our Young People had agreed among Themselves, to Meet together on Tuesday, the <HI>Fifth Day of August,</HI> for Youthful <HI>Diversion</HI> and <HI>Recreation;</HI> Or to use their own <HI>Terms,</HI> had agreed it should be a Day of <HI>Fro∣licking</HI> among Them.</P>
<P><PB REF="004829_0007_100DFCFEBB4E1160"/>
But Struck with this <HI>Sudden Death</HI> of one of their Number, and Alarumed with the Thought of such a <HI>Sweeping Distemper</HI>'s Entring the Place <HI>the Second Time,</HI> Many of them get together at the Funeral, and agree to <HI>desire</HI> me to give them an <HI>Exhortation,</HI> in the House of God, on said Tuesday, <HI>before intended for Mirth and Di∣version.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Accordingly,</HI> On the Evening following the Sabbath, some appointed by the Rest came, and informed me of their Design of <HI>Turning their Meeting,</HI> before designed for Diversion, <HI>into a Religious Meeting;</HI> and desired my <HI>Assistance,</HI> and a Word of <HI>Exhortation:</HI></P>
<P>I need not tell you, that I had not an Heart hard enough to deny such a Request.</P>
<P>In a little Time after said Meeting, the Young People appointed some, in the Name of the Rest <HI>to desire</HI> that the <HI>Discourse,</HI> which was at said Time, delivered to them, <HI>might be made Pub∣lick at their Charge and Expence:</HI> Which is now published for the same End, as it was then delivered: And if the rising Generation may hereby, as a <HI>Means,</HI> be any Thing Quickned to <HI>early Re∣ligion;</HI> the desired <HI>End is obtained.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>AMOS III. 6.</BIBL>
<P><HI>Shall a Trumpet be blown in the City, and the People not be afraid? Shall there be Evil in a City, and the LORD hath not done it?</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SO great is the Corruption, and De∣pravedness of the Humane Nature, that a spirit of Vanity and Sin, and an Inclination to depart from the Living GOD, are become natural to Men.</P>
<P>Hence, perhaps there hath not been found any Nation or people, of any long Standing upon the Face of the Earth, who have not run such a length in Sin and Wickedness, and so increased their Iniquities, as to render it necessary, for the Vindication of the Divine Providence and Perfections, that awful Judg∣ments be sent upon them, to be Testimonies from Heaven for GOD, and against impious blaspheming Mortals.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="004829_0008_100DFD01072BD4A8"/>
Indeed GOD is abundantly, yea infinitely good; he is kind to the rebellious Nations, and doth not at once <HI>stir up all his Wrath.</HI> But yet, if he spares for the Present, and <HI>being full of Compassion</HI> does not speedily raise up Him∣self to destroy them, he doth not forget their Wickedness and Sins, but writes them down in his Book; and when their Iniquities are ripe, he will visit their Sin upon Them. <HI>Exod. xxxii.</HI> 34.</P>
<P>So the Prophet Amos in the Name of the LORD, assures the great and populous King∣doms, which then were famous in the World, that they had Iniquities remembred by GOD, that must, when they had filled up their Mea∣sure, be punished upon them. See <HI>Chap. i</HI> &amp; <HI>ii.</HI></P>
<P>Judah and Israel, tho' they were the pecu∣liar People of God, the singularly favoured of Heaven, have their Sins remembred before GOD, as well as the Other Nations; and so might expect that a Woe-Day would sooner or later come upon them, <HI>Chap. ii.</HI> 4—8. Yea, the Sins of These especially needed to be punished upon Them: For GOD had done more for them than Others; laid them under stronger Obligations: So that their Sins were attended with very aggravating Circumstan∣ces; shewed more Ingratitude, Unkindness and Stubbornness; were greater Affronts to an indulgent Heaven, <HI>Chap. ii.</HI> 9—13.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004829_0008_100DFD01072BD4A8"/>
The Prophet, in our Context, in the Name of the LORD, declares the Necessity and Certainty of GOD's Judgments against his own backslidden and greatly provoking People of Israel; tells them, that as GOD hath been especially good to them, so their Sins espe∣cially call for Punishment; as he had peculiarly undertook the Care &amp; Government of them, and made them in a peculiar Manner his own Family, so it was but congruous and fitting, that he should see the Laws of his Family executed upon Them; correct them for their Offences, and punish them for their Iniqui∣ties, <HI>ver.</HI> 2. 'Tis indeed necessary, that they be forsaken and left of God, and given up to Misery and Evil, when their Ways are con∣trary and provoking to God; when they despise his Laws, and give him no becoming Reverence and Glory, <HI>ver.</HI> 3. <HI>Can Two walk together, except they be agreed?</HI> Can any Two walk together, and so have Communion and Fellowship one with the Other, when they are not enough of one mind to walk the same Way, or take the same Course? The Similitude is easily applied; when GOD and his People are contrary one to the other, there is no Communion between them: In this Case, as they walk contrary to GOD, so he to them; and that implies his Forsaking and Punishing them.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004829_0009_100DFD0329D33EB0"/>
And as 'tis necessary that they be punished for their Iniquities, so 'tis certain, that the LORD is offended, and about to punish them; And therefore they may be sure, that there are Sins found with them, rendring this neces∣sary. <HI>A Lion will not roar in the Forest,</HI> nor <HI>a young Lion cry out of his Den,</HI> for Nothing; <HI>a Bird is not caught without some Sanre or Gin; and no Man will think it worth his while to take up a Snare that has taken Nothing:</HI> In every one of these Instances, whither a Lion's Roaring, a Young Lion's Crying, a Bird's being caught, or a Snare taken from the Earth, there is some Reason and Occasion for the same, <HI>ver.</HI> 4, 5. In which the Prophet seems to lead us to con∣sider, that there is Nothing done by the De∣sign of any Agent, without some Reason or moving Occasion: And his Intention doubt∣less is, to convince us, that God does not threaten, nor send his Judgments for Nothing, or without any Cause: So that, if God utters his Voice, brings any Judgments upon a Peo∣ple, they may Konw, that there is some Rea∣son therefore; God is offended, and is about to punish them for their Iniquities; and that therefore it becometh them to <HI>prepare to meet God.</HI></P>
<P>This same Thing, the Prophet in a most convincing Way, further insists upon in our Text: <HI>Shall a Trumpet be blown in the City, and</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="004829_0009_100DFD0329D33EB0"/><HI>the People not be afraid? Shall there be Evil in City, and the Lord hath not done it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Shall a Trumpet be blown in the City, and the People not be afraid?</HI> Shall there be an Alarum given, and the People take no Notice, nor be concerred? When a Trumpet is sounded for such an End, men conclude there is Danger; their Hearts are presently filled with Fear; they conclude there is not this Warning for Nothing The Design and Application of this is easily seen, <HI>viz.</HI> That if God has sounded his Trumpet, given an Alarum, there is good Reason to conclude it is not for No∣thing; but he warns us that he is coming forth in the Way of his Judgments; and it concerns us to be ready to meet Him.</P>
<P>But perhaps this would not be convincing to some, except they better understood what Alarum was given by God, or what Trumpet of the Lord had been blown amongst them: They had heard, perhaps they would say, No Voice from Heaven; knew not of any War∣ning God had given them that might be com∣pared to a Trumpet sounding an Alarm.</P>
<P>To inform the Minds of such, and fasten the Conviction, 'tis added, <HI>Shall there be Evil in a City, and the LORD hath not done it?</HI> Shall there be any Judgments in the City, any Ca∣lamities, and the LORD not have a Hand in
<PB N="6" REF="004829_0010_100DFD04CFC22630"/>the same? If there be Evils, any sore Afflicti∣ons, or any terrible Providences, are not these the Doings of the LORD? By these God ut∣ters his Voice, warns and threatens you.</P>
<P>From which Words thus opened, we may gather these Things as plainly implied and in∣sinuated in them, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>I.</HI> That GOD hath an holy Hand in all the Judgments, brought upon us or our Friends: <HI>Shall there be Evil in a City, and the LORD hath not done it?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>II.</HI> That one End of GOD's Judgments, is, to be the Warning of a People: They are com∣pared to a Trumpet sounded for an Alarum.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>III.</HI> That it is the Duty of All, when GOD warns them in the Way of his Providence, to take the Warning, hear the Voice, fear the Danger, and endeavour to Escape it: The Simile made use of and improved upon this Occasion, plainly teacheth us, that as a People, who hear the Trumpet sounding an Alarm, fearing the Danger betake themselves to their Arms or Forts so should a People take War∣ning by the Trumpet of the LORD; be afraid of approaching Danger, and prepare to meet Him.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>These Things, we purpose at this Time, to consider, as so many Doctrinal Propositions.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<P N="1"><PB N="7" REF="004829_0010_100DFD04CFC22630"/>
I. <HI>GOD hath an holy Hand in all the Judg∣ments, brought upon us or our Friends.</HI> Nothing is more Evident, than that the same Almighty Being, who at first commanded the universal World to exist, exerciseth a Providence over the World he hath made This may be proved from the Perfections of the Deity, from the necessary Dependence of the Creature upon the Creator, from the continued Harmony and Order in the Visible World, and from Tokens of the Presence &amp; over-ruling Power of GOD in Providences that happen:</P>
<P>But at this Time, it is not our Design to offer Proofs for a Divine Providence; but to consider the Extensiveness of GOD's Provi∣dence.</P>
<P>Many allow that GOD exerciseth a Provi∣dence in the World, who yet have but stingy Tho'ts of his Providence: They allow, that he beholds the Children of Men from the Ha∣bitation of his Throne; takes Notice how Things are managed in the World; doth Good to his Friends; yea, is kind to his Ene∣mies, <HI>to the Evil and Vnthankful;</HI> sometimes also, he frowns upon the Workers of Iniquity: They look for a Time also, when he will gloriously reward his Friends with immortal Blessings, and spurn his Enemies from his Pre∣sence into outer Darkness and everlasting Hor∣rors
<PB N="8" REF="004829_0011_100DFD06DCCC5C38"/>But yet, there are a Thousand Things happening in Providence, that they don't con∣sider the Almighty as having any Thing to do with, only as a Spectator.</P>
<P>But, if we well consider Things, we shall find the Providence of GOD to be more extensive than such imagine; yea that it extends to all Things, and all the Accidents and Circumstan∣ces attending Them. What we call natural or second Causes, are conducted and influenced by GOD's Providence: 'Tis by his Provi∣dence, that the regular Returns of Day and Night, and the Successions of Summer and Winter are made. 'Tis by his Providence, that <HI>the Sun shines upon the Good and Bad, Mat. v.</HI> 45. 'Tis by his Providence, that <HI>the Heavens are covered with Clouds, and the Rain prepared for the Earth, Psal exlvii</HI> &amp;. And even those Events, that to us may seem casual and fortuitous, are ordered and over-ruled by his Providence; So we are informed, <HI>Prov. xvi.</HI> 33 <HI>The Lot is cast into the lap; but the whole Disposing thereof is of the Lord.</HI> And altho' it be true, that there are some Events, which happen by the Design of rational created Agents, yet these also are over-ruled by Divine Providence: If any such Agents do us Good, we should consider them as Instruments, which God improves; and if we suffer Evil from them, they are the Rods, wherewith the Almighty pleaseth to correct
<PB N="9" REF="004829_0011_100DFD06DCCC5C38"/>us. Thus the Assyrian, that had it in his Heart to destroy, and grievously wounded Is∣rael is called <HI>the Rod of God's Anger;</HI> and <HI>the Staff in their Hand is</HI> said to be <HI>his Indignation, Isa. x</HI> 5 The destroying Assyrian is again compared, <HI>to the Ax in</HI> the Hand <HI>of him that hewith therewith,</HI> and <HI>to a Saw shaken</HI> or <HI>listed up by him,</HI> that maketh use of the same, <HI>ver.</HI> 15. Again, he is compared <HI>to a Razor that is hired,</HI> in the Hand of him that shaveth, <HI>Isa. vii.</HI> 20.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole then, let us meet with what Things soever in the World, and from what Cause soever, the Hand of GOD is to be acknowleged in the same; whither good or evil Things b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l us, GOD's Providence is still concerned in the same: <HI>I form the Light,</HI> saith the LORD, <HI>and create Darkness: I make Peace, and create Evil: I the</HI> LORD <HI>do all these Things, Isa, xlv</HI> 7.</P>
<P>Not only then, are we to acknowlege the Hand of God in all our Blessings but, if there be any Evil in the City, we are to acknowlege, <HI>GOD hath done it;</HI> if there be any sore Afflicti∣on, heavy Calamity, any Sickness or Death amongst us, there is the Hand of the Lord in the same. So doubtless, Eliphaz understood the Matter, when he saith, <HI>Job v.</HI> 6. <HI>Affliction cometh not forth of the Dust; neither doth Trouble Bring out of the Ground:</HI> And therefore, as for himself, he says, if at any Time he should be
<PB N="10" REF="004829_0012_100DFD09B3285FE0"/>brought into Affliction, <HI>he would seek unto GOD and unto GOD he would commit his Cause, ver</HI> 8.</P>
<P>But we proceed to consider,</P>
<P N="2">II. That <HI>One End of</HI> GOD's <HI>Judgments, is, to be the Warning of a People.</HI></P>
<P>The Judgments of GOD may be considered as his awakening Voice to a stupid World: They are Signs or Effects and Fruits of his Anger against Sin; Tokens from GOD that Sin shall not go unpunished.</P>
<P>The Apostle makes the Judgments of GOD brought upon any, even in distant Ages, that come to our Ears, to be our <HI>Examples,</HI> and <HI>de∣si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned for our Admonition,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor. x.</HI> 6, 7, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So the Apostle Jude makes the Fall and Misery of the Angels to be Warnings to us, <HI>Jude,</HI> 5, 6, And tells us, <HI>That Sodom and Gomor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ha, and the Cities about them, are set forth for an Example, suffering the Vengeance of eternal Fire, ver.</HI> 7. So the Apostle Peter represents <HI>the Bringing in the Flood of old upon the World,</HI> to be a Warning to all that hear of the same, 2 <HI>Pet. ii.</HI> 5, 6.</P>
<P>And, if the Judgments of GOD, that we hear of in such distant Ages, have such a speak∣ing Voice, how much more the Judgments of GOD that are just at Hand, and fall within our Sight? Moses seem'd to think, that the Judg∣ments of GOD, that fall out within the Sight
<PB N="11" REF="004829_0012_100DFD09B3285FE0"/>and Knowlege of Any, have a clearer Voice than those we hear to have been in distant A∣ges, <HI>Deut. ii.</HI> 2,—7 <HI>Know ye this Day: for I speak not with your Children which have not known and which have not seen the Chast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>soment of the LORD your</HI> GOD, <HI>&amp;c..... But your Eyes have seen all the great Acts of the LORD, which he did.</HI></P>
<P>GOD's Judgments then, that overtake us, in our Persons, Families or Friends, are a loud Warning to us of the Danger of Abiding in Sin, and of the Necessity of hiding our selves under the Wings of the ALMIGHTY, before the Floods of Divine Indignation come upon us. Thus GOD's Judgments are called <HI>his Voice crying unto the City, Mic. vi.</HI> 9. Thus the Pro∣phet represents the Most HIGH, as uttering a mighty Voice, and speaking very loud to Men in the Way of his Judgments; <HI>Jer. xxv.</HI> 29, 30, 31. <HI>Lo, I begin to bring Evil on the City which is called by my Name, and should ye be utterly unpunished?

<P>We come now to consider,</P>
<P N="3">III. That <HI>it is the Duty of All, when GOD warns them in the Way of his Providence, to take the Warning, hear the Voice, fear the Danger,</HI> and <HI>endeavour to escape it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="004829_0013_100DFD0C03615B40"/>
<HI>When GOD's Judgments are in the Earth, the Inhabitants of the World should see, and learn Righ∣teousnes, Isa. xxvi.</HI> 9, 10, 11. When the LORD's Voice cryeth to the City, <HI>the Man of Wisdom will hear, Mic. vi</HI> 9. If GOD sends his Judg∣ments, for this End, <HI>Namely,</HI> to be a Warning to a careless World, it is evident, that Sin will lie at the Door of those, that receive not Warning: For we then only comply with the Design of God in his Judgments, when we con∣sider his Hand, hearken to his Voice, and do our best to be ready to meet him, that we may escape the severer Judgments of Heaven, and be hid in the Day of the LORD's Anger.</P>
<P>Indeed, this Proposition is so evident from what has been offered under the fore-going and from the End and Design of GOD's Judgments, that I need not detain you to offer any Thing more in Confirmation of it: For shall GOD himself give us Warning, and we not think out∣selves obliged to receive it? Shall GOD him∣self blow his Trumpet and we not be afraid When the Almighty gives Notice, that <HI>he reser∣veth Wrath for his Enemies, and the Day of the Lord hasteth,</HI> shall we not think it reasonable, that <HI>moved with Fear,</HI> if it b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> possible, <HI>we prepart an Ark,</HI> and secure out selves under the Cover of the ALMIGHTY's Wings?</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004829_0013_100DFD0C03615B40"/>
What is yet before us, is the Application of these Truths, which we have been con∣sidering.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="application">
<HEAD>USE, I. Of INFORMATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Is it as we have beard; that GOD hath an holy Hand in all the Judgments, brought upon us, or our Friends? <HI>Are all the Sorrows and Evils in the World directed and over-ruled by him? Then we may infer, that those who have GOD engaged for Them, and are secure of his Favour, are safe in the saddest Times; and therefore we may with Hope and Security, commend our selves and Circumstances to GOD in W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll doing in the most difficult Times.</HI> The Face of Providence is some Times overspread with Clouds and Darkness; <HI>the Eyes of Many mourn by reason of Affliction:</HI> Terrors and pestilential Arrows flie by Night, and <HI>Destruction wasteth at No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣Day.</HI> There seemeth to be Distress on every Hand; there is Desolation within doors, and Fear without; Abroad one Calamity prevails, and another as dreadful at Home.</P>
<P>But in such dark Times, there is this for the People of GOD to live upon, and comfort their weeping Hearts in the Consideration of, <HI>even,</HI> that <HI>the LORD reigneth, who rideth upon the Heaven in the Help of his People, and in his Ex∣cellency on the Sky.</HI> He over-rules all, <HI>Justice and Judgment are the Habitation of whose Throne;
<PB N="14" REF="004829_0014_100DFD0D95B38AC0"/>who is good, a strong Hold in the Day of Trouble, and who knoweth them that trust in Him.</HI></P>
<P>We may therefore in all such sad and dole∣ful Days, when were it not for this, it would not be strange, if our Hearts should sink and fail, I say, in such sad Times we may put our Trust in GOD; make the Most HIGH our Re∣fuge, and unto his Wings betake our selves for Shel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er: And we may be confident, that No∣thing shall hurt us without his Leave; none of the destroying Arrows that flie about, shall light upon us wihout his Permission. So that, it we can but be sure of an Interest in his Fa∣vour, we need not fear, <HI>though an Host should ene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mp against us, Psal. xxvii. 3. Nor, though the Earth be removed, and though the Mountains be carried into the Midst of the Sea. Tho the Waters thereof rore, and be troubled, tho' the Mountains shake with the Swelling thereof, Psal xlvi.</HI> 2, 3. We need not be afraid of the <HI>Snare of the Fowler, nor the noisom Pestilence.</HI> We need <HI>not be afraid for the Terror by Night: not for the Arrow that Flie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h by Day: nor for the Pestilence that walketh in Darkness: nor for the Destruction that wasteth at Noon-Day.</HI> We need not be afraid of <HI>any Evil that shall befal us,</HI> nor <HI>of any Plague that can come nigh our Dwelling, Psal. xci per totum. Yea, though we walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death,</HI> we need not <HI>fear any Evil, Psal. xxiii</HI> 4 For, <HI>GOD will cover us with his Feathers; and his
<PB N="15" REF="004829_0014_100DFD0D95B38AC0"/>Truth shall be our Shield and Buckler.</HI> With Life <HI>will he satisfy us, and shew us his Salvation, Psal. xci.</HI> 4. <HI>&amp;</HI> 16.</P>
<P N="2">2 Is it as we have heard, that one End of GOD's Judgments is, to be the Warning of a People? <HI>If then there be Judgments amongst us, or round about us, we learn what Interpretation to make of the same.</HI> By Them GOD gives us Notice, What <HI>he will do unto us</HI> if we are found in the Ways of Sin, and return not to him: <HI>And because he will do this unto us,</HI> hereby designs to excite us <HI>to prepare to meet our GOD; to seek Righteousness and Meekness, before the Decree brong Forth, before the fierce Anger of the</HI> LORD <HI>come upon us.</HI></P>
<P>GOD being infinitely good, and delighting in Mercy, most frequently sends his awakening Judgments, before he proceeds to the Utmost agaist Men; He warns them, and gives them a Space for Repentance. He somtimes visits with awful and distressing Sickness; so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the destroying Angel, and takes away some as a Warning to the Rest. And, if some of the Best are taken away, the Warning is not less; only there is more of GODs Love to Souls discovered, whiles those that are ready, are taken away to Peace and the Enjoyment of Heavenly Love, and Others are warned to be ready.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="004829_0015_100DFD0F96427898"/>
If then any awful Sickness, any sore Judge∣ment is sent amongst us, we may reasonably conclude that GOD is giving of us Warning to prepare for all Evens and be ready to meet Him, in what Way soever he shall be pleased to come unto us.</P>
<P>And particulary, <HI>We may so interpret the Disp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sation of Providence, whereby an awful Distemper hath been sent into a Family in this Place; and One of your Contemporaries by sudden Strike hath been removed.</HI> GOD hereby calls upon us to <HI>be also ready;</HI> that we bethink our selves, and put our selves into a ready Posture to stand before Him.</P>
<P>And it may be justly considered, as being more <HI>especially, a Warning to You that are in your Youth.</HI> To You, the LORD's Voice cries, <HI>Be ye also ready;</HI> make Haste, and get all Things in Readiness for a solemn Meeting with GOD: Your against the Young People especially, hath the affrighting and desolating Distemper been commissioned.</P>
<P>We <HI>of this Place,</HI> may still have <HI>in Remem∣brance our Affliction and our Misery, the Worm∣wood and the Gall,</HI> when some Years ago, we felt some Strokes of the Distemper, and sundry of your Comtemporaries were removed: And yet, the heavy Stroke on us, was light, compa∣red with what many other Places felf. Ah!
<PB N="17" REF="004829_0015_100DFD0F96427898"/>What Desolations is hath made in some Places! <HI>How terrible hath GOD been in has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oings!</HI> Nu∣merous Families have been empried! A great Number of the <HI>Children are cut off from without, and the Young Men from he Streets.</HI> Many once happy Parents, whose Hearts have rejoiced in the Blessings of Children, are bemoaning themselves as <HI>Jer x.</HI> 19, 20 <HI>Wo is me for my Hurt, my Wound is grievous: My Tabernacle is spoiled, and all my Cords are broken: my Children — are not.</HI> Where but a little While ago, Abun∣dance of youthful Songs of Mirth might be heard, now, mournful Litties, elegi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck Songs and Lamentations are chiefly in Use. And ah! how Few are left to join the mournful Song! Here and there, a Youth escaped, a Mo∣nument of sparing Mercy! wondring that he was not consumed with the sweeping Conta∣gion!</P>
<P>And is the fatal Distemper sent amongst us again? How loud is the Voice to prepare to meet a Holy GOD, who threatens us of coming forth in his Indignation? For if is pre∣vails, and we prevent it not by earnest Prayer, Humiliation and Amendment, how many of this pleasant Company will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly, in a little While, be in the immoveable Stare? It affects my Heart, to behold such a Number of Youth tope her, and think of the sweeping Distem∣per's Coming amongst them! — To think
<PB N="18" REF="004829_0016_100DFD1292D9E1C8"/>what Desolations, if GOD should give Per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s;ion, it would make! O may a merciful GOD prevent so sad a Calamity; and spare us, and by gentler Methods of Grace bring us to Amendment!</P>
<P N="3">3. Is it as we have heard? Then hence, <HI>All should be carefully considering God's Works, taking Notice of the Operation of his Hands:</HI> They should observe the Judgments and Doings of the LORD, and behold his Works. Some∣times, God speaks once, yea twice, and Men perceive it not; He speaks by his Word and in his Providence, and is not heard Men's Eves are blinded, and they see not; their Ears are dull of Hearing, nor do they give Attention to the Voice of GOD. Yea, 'tis to be feared, that many hear not his Voice, 'till <HI>the Decree bring forth,</HI> 'till <HI>the Day pass as the Chaff,</HI> and the fierce <HI>Anger of the LORD come upon them; 'till their Fear cometh as Desolation, and their de∣struction as a Whirlwind.</HI> Ah! Miserable Souls! Unhappy Men! They perceive not GOD speaking to them, till it be too late to cry for Mercy! or, to hope to avoid the Floods of divine Indignation! Poor Creatures! How they feel, when Death has Snatch'd them away, and all their Opportunities of Grace are over!</P>
<P>Don't it make all our Hearts to sigh — to think of that sad Eternity before them! Oh!
<PB N="19" REF="004829_0016_100DFD1292D9E1C8"/>how much more comfortable, will a due Con∣fideration and improvement of GOD's Judg∣ments make us at last; when the good design of a merciful GOD shall be happily ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ained, by awakening us to Repentance, and driving as to the Feathers of the ALMIGHTY's Wings for Protection?</P>
<P>But how can we hope, that the instructive Voice of divine Providence in those <HI>terrible Things done in Righteousness,</HI> should have this happy Effect upon us it we take no Notice of the Works and Doings of the LORD? If we will not yield Attertion, what Means of In∣struction are likely to availd? We know the unobserving Learner never makes Proficiency, but leses many Means of Instruction: And so whiles we observe not the Providence of GOD, we shall likely lose the Benefit, we might otherwise have, from many instructive dispensations of Providence: GOD may speak often, and we perceive it not: and so the gracious End of divine Warnings may be frustrated.</P>
<P N="4">4. If is be as hath been shewed, <HI>Then we may infer, that great th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'tfulness and Serto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sness becometh us, when GOD's Judgments are amongst us. Shall a Trumpet be blown,</HI> an Alarum given, <HI>and the People not be afraid?</HI> Shall Warning be given us to prepare to meet our GOD, and
<PB N="20" REF="004829_0017_100DFD1503DB6D40"/>we remain as senseless, tho'tless, inconsiderate as ever? — How unsuitable would this be? And shall the ALMIGHTY himself awfully speak, and utter his Voice in the Way of his Providence, and we yet indulge our selves in Levity and Mirth, and <HI>let our Heart cheer us,</HI> as tho' we had no Warning to look out for an Evil Day, and were nothing concerted in the Afflictions of our Friends, and Judgements of GOD? Can we but abhor such a spirit? Methinks, Nothing seems more indece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, than a jolly carele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, merry Homour indulged, when GOD in the way of his Judgments, is calling al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ud to prepare for a solemn Meeting with his Dreadful Majesty. GOD's Judgements are serious; and 'tis a serious Thing to meet him when he comes forth in the same.</P>
<P>And I can't but be pleased (and I hope it is and ken for Good) that the Young People of any Charge are inclined to be serious, and to consider the Voice of GOD in the Alarum, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a seemed to be given Them.

Is it as we have beard, that GOD's Judg∣ments are for the Warning of People to pre∣pare to meet GOD?

And, alas! What shall the Unprepared Soul do, if it be quickly called away? If the fatal distemper seises, dispatches and maker short Work? Ah! my dear Friends, how shad, how dreadful it would be?

<P>To inforce his Exhortation, consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>the Voice cries for early Repensance, and speedy Preparation to meet GOD.</HI> Some∣times, when GOD has been warning a People, they are ready to say, <HI>The Vison is for many days to come: Where is the Word of the</HI> LORD? <HI>say</HI> they, <HI>Let it come now, jer. xvii.</HI> 15. <HI>They say, Let him make speed, and hasten his Work, that we may see it: and let the Counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw night, that we may know it, Isa. v.</HI> 19.</P>
<P>But, Methinks, the Voice of GOD now, earneslly urgeth speedy Repentance; that we be prosently ready for the woful Day. It

<P>Besides, the Pains and Languishings of the Body render it an unhappy Time for so great a Work. Men generally find it enough then, to bear the Pains of the Body, and grapple under the Load of their Disease: Their
<PB N="27" REF="004829_0020_100DFD1ADD9FFFE8"/>girding Pains so possess the Mind, or fainting Turns interrupt the Thoughts, as to render a fixed Attontion to Soul work an impossible Thing; the Groans and Terrors of the sink∣ing and expiting Nature must needs very often, call away the Mind from every Thing else.

<P>Theis Hear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sink, their Souls tremble; their Looks call for Pity from by-standers, and are affecting enough, to beget bender Motions of Pity, even in cruel hearted Men!

And when they endeavour to improve a remaining Moment, in doing somthing for their Souls,
<PB N="28" REF="004829_0021_100DFD1D30BDC0B0"/>the distressed Body diverts the Tho'ts and forces away the Mind.</P>
<P>Moreover, the overwhelming Fear, that will likely attend Persons at such a Time, may deprive them of that Prudence, that at other Times they amy have; and lead them to take unlikely Courses to save their Souls.</P>
<P>At such a sad Time, poor Creatures, fright∣ned and amazed, full of Perplexity, and their whole Souls in a Tumult, oftentimes lay Hold of what will never save; as a drowing Person will lay Hold of any Thing for Satety, tho' i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be at the Bottom, and a sure way to make him Ruin certain.</P>
<P>'Tis not to be doubted, but Many in their dying Anguish flie to Courses, that will prow altogether fruitless, nor help their Souls at all They lean upon that which will sink undo their Weight: <HI>They turn to the Saints,</HI> and hope for Mercy for their sakes: They depence on the Prayers of their Friends: They trust to a dying Prayer for Mercy.

<P><PB N="30" REF="004829_0022_100DFD202CF82560"/>
It would be sad, it after God had warned us of our Exposeness to his Judgments, and in his abundant Goodness allowed us an Op∣portunity to hide our selves from the ap∣proaching Evil, we yet shoud make light of his Warnings, despise his Goodness, abide in our Sins, and be overtaken with the heavy Storms of Wrath, we had Notice were a gathering.</P>
<P N="3">3. Why should we delay? <HI>'Twill never be a better Time for Repentance and Making our Peace with GOD than now.</HI> We must <HI>turn to the</HI> LORD by true repentance, or <HI>Iniquity will be our Ruine.</HI> Repentance is a Work that must be done, or we are undone for ever: Our Sins or our Souls must die. We cannot always a∣bide in our Sins, estranged and alienated from GOD, at any cheaper Rate than the Blood of our precious, immortal Souls. Christ hath once, and again assured us, that <HI>except we re∣pent, we shall all likewise perish.</HI> As sure then, as we are now here, we shall perish, if we be not converted: If we remain unsanctified, we shall be cast off with the unholy, that shall never enter into the Kingdon of GOD: So that, it concerns us, to repent and be converted unto GOD, as much as our Souls are Worth.</P>
<P>And what must be done, why shall we not endeavour to do it now? Especially, consider∣ing,
<PB N="31" REF="004829_0022_100DFD202CF82560"/>that we sahll never have a better Time? For, supposing GOD in Mercy prevent the prevailing of Sickoness and Mortality amongst us, and our Space in the Word be lengthen'd out, Yet it will never be a better Time, for Repentance amd Seeking a Reconciliation with GOD than now: Yea, never will there be again, so good a Time for this Work as now.</P>
<P>Young People are strangely apt to imagine a <HI>more convenisent Season</HI> before them; but 'tis a Delusion, and ungrounded Imagination. The Time of Youth is really the best Time for this Work.</P>
<P>GOD directs his Offers of Mercy particu∣larly to Young Persons: He calls to them in a partcular Manner to come and partake of his Love; <HI>Pasal. xxxiv.</HI> 11. <HI>Come, ye Children, hearken unto me, &amp;c.</HI> See also <HI>Eccl.xii.</HI> 1. <HI>Remem∣ber now thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There is a special encouragement given to Yourth, that, if they apply themselves to seek the LORD, they shall speed; <HI>Prov. viii.</HI> 17,— <HI>Those that seek me early shall find me.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, GOD hath manifested how pleased he is, when Persons in Earnest seek him in their Youth. Remember the Instances of Samuel and Josiah, who sought the LORD when they were Young; what gracious Res∣pects
<PB N="32" REF="004829_0023_100DFD224DCB3830"/>GOD shewed to them? He blessed them and make them b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essings in the World.</P>
<P>Besides, there is not so much contracted Obstinacy in the Hearts of Youth, as in those of more advanced Years. Not but that they have natural Corruption and Principles of Sin in them, as well as Others; and Hearts so hard, as to need an Omnipotent Power to soften the same. But yet there is an incereasing Obstinacy in the Hearts of Men; and Young Persons have not made such Advances in it, as by longer Continuance in Sin, they will arrive unto. But then by every Day's continuance in Sin, this will increase upon Them; the Heart will grow more harden'd against the Counsels of Grace, more set against Religion and averse to a Compliance with the Term of Peace; Repentance will become more diffi∣cult and Hazardous: <HI>Jer xiii 23. Can the E∣thiopian change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots? then may ye also do Good, that are accustomed to do Evil.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> the Encumbrances of Life increase upon Persons, as they increase in Years. You will likely have more worldly Cares and Con∣cerns, to call off your Minds from the Care of your Souls afterwards, if your Day in the World be leng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h'ned out, than you have now. The Time of Youth is the freest from worldly
<PB N="33" REF="004829_0023_100DFD224DCB3830"/>Cares and Troubles of any: And therefore the wise Man calls upon Youth, <HI>to remember their Creator in the Days of their Youth, while the evil Days come not, Eccl. xii.</HI> I.</P>
<P>Nor may we expect to be freer from Temp∣tation to delay, and put off this Work of Re∣pentance, hereafter than now. There will be as many Temptations hereafter, still to put off, without any doubt, as now. Delaying will not make it better, but worses upon this Ac∣count. Say, have not some of you had Tho'ts of setting about the Work of Repentance Years ago; but thro' one Temptation or an∣other, have neglected it till now? And is it any better upon that Account now, than be∣fore? Are there not as strong Temptations to defer as ever? And so you may expect there will be, if you delay longer. Delay no longer then, but <HI>seek the</HI> LORD <HI>while he may be found,</HI> and <HI>call upon him while he is near.</HI> Improve a good Time, while you have it.</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>If you will not hearken to the Counsels of GOD, nor take Warning by his Judgmens, who know but GOD will say in righteous Judgment, Why should ye be stricken any more, an leave you in the Congregation of dead Souls?</HI> It would be but a righteous Retribution, if we resolve to delay the Work of Repentance any longer, and har∣den our Hearts against the Warnings of God,
<PB N="34" REF="004829_0024_100DFD249347BEC8"/>If GOD should leave us to a <HI>bard and impenitent Heart,</HI> to treasure up unto <HI>our selves Wrath a∣gainst the Day of Wrath, and Revelation of the righteous Judgment of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>And how sad a Judgment would this be? Then we might <HI>hear indeed, and understand not, see but perceive not:</HI> Then, if we remain'd longer in the World, we should be but like the barren Fig-tree, <HI>upon which no Fruit grew:</HI> Or like <HI>the dejected Earth, which beareth Thorns and Briars; whose End is to be burned.</HI></P>
<P>Some have thus been left of God. — So when GOD had Counselled and warned Israel, and it proved to no Purpose; he righteously <HI>gave them up to their own Hearts Lusts, and said, Why should ye be stricken any more? Ye will revolt more and more, Isa. i.</HI> 5. And so somtimes, he lets Persons alone to go on in their own Ways; takes away his holy Spirit, and strives no more with them.</P>
<P>And it hath been somtimes observed, that when GOD begins early to warn Persons, and to strive with them by his Spirit, if his War∣nings be slighted, and the Strivings of his Spirit resisted, GOD early leaves them, and takes away his holy Spirit from them.</P>
<P>Thus Many, who have had awakening Means, and the Strivings of GOD's Spirit in their Youth, have been left when they advance
<PB N="35" REF="004829_0024_100DFD249347BEC8"/>in Years, and suffered to walk in their own Counsels all their days. O then whil'st GOD warns, whil'st his Spirit strives, whil'st we have a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pecial Season of Grace, let us hear his Voice.</P>
<P N="5">5 <HI>If hereafter GOD shoud give you saving Re∣pentance, the Delaying of it will be Matter of bitter Sorrow to Tou then</HI> If there be some Instances of such as have long delayed Repentance and found Mercy with the LORD at last, Yet <HI>they mourn at the Last,</HI> and bitterly bewail their former Times: They find, that they have been wornging their own Soule; and with Tears lament it before the LORD. It fills their Hearts with Sorrow, that they have lost such precious Opportunities; miserably wast∣ed away their Days, and mispent a Season of Grace: It afflicts their very Souls, to remem∣ber how much they have dishonoured GOD, and liv'd in Vain; or what is worse, to the evil Purposes of Sin, big with Misery and Death. Now, <HI>the Sins of their Youth</HI> cause their Hearts to ake, and <HI>sill their Bones</HI> with Sorrow.</P>
<P>So that, if we find Mercy at last, it will cost us Abundance of Sorrow, if we delay the ne∣cessary Work of Repentance.</P>
<P>And that a Pity it is, to lay in for after Re∣pentance and Sorrows? We have Sin enough already, to cause Abund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Sorrow, and
<PB N="36" REF="004829_0025_100DFD261D800850"/>make the very inmost Parts of our Hearts to ake when we shall be brought to a Sense of the same. What a Pity it is, that we should lay in any more fore repenting Tears and Hear depressing Sorrow?</P>
<P>In a Word, what a Pity it is, that we should indulge our Sel es any longer in <HI>That, of which,</HI> we many be fore, <HI>there will be no good Fruit,</HI> and <HI>of which,</HI> there is danger, <HI>the End</HI> will prove <HI>the Death</HI> of our Souls and <HI>of which,</HI> suppose the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, and we obtain Forgiveness from GOD, <HI>we shall be ashamed;</HI> mourn and be in Bitterness for; and our Souls be humbled within us.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>If you remain unconverted and impenitent, you will be all your Life-Time thro' Fear of Death sub∣ject unto Bondage.</HI> Your Hearts will reproach and condemn you; an unpeaceful Witness re∣side in your Bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sts: Which if it be stifled will some Time or orther awake, and give in Testimony for GOD against you.</P>
<P>There is a Principle of spiritual Horror in unco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Souls, if they seem at any Time to be at Ease, and to live in Security. Con∣science may sleep a little While, but Terrors stand ready to seise the Soul, as soon as it wakes</P>
<P>And in General, impenitent Souls are sain to take Pains to lull their Consciences asleep which will be often reminding them of a day
<PB N="37" REF="004829_0025_100DFD261D800850"/>of Reckoning: So that there is no Quiet in their Minds; but their Consciences cry out against them, or they are doing Violence to themselves, to suppress their uneasie and accu∣sing Thoughts.</P>
<P>And for the most Part, after all their in∣dustrious and painful Labours, to drown the Noise and Clamour, their Consciences raise within them, They have many Terrors in the Night, and tedious Reflections by Day.</P>
<P>When ever God brings his Judgments upon them, and it looks as if God was coming forth in Earnest to purnish the Inhabitants of the Earth, (except some few harden'd Wretches, <HI>whom God hath given over to a reprobate Mind;</HI> who are become <HI>past Feeling, having their Con∣sciences seared with a red hot Irou</HI>) their guilty Breasts tremble as the Leaves of the Forrest. If Sickness light upon Them, or Death present it self before them, They presently <HI>howl upon their Beds;</HI> their <HI>Hands become faint, and their Hearts fail them for Fear, and for Looking after those Things, which,</HI> they apprehend, <HI>are coming on them.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Nothing is more unkind and unreasonable, than to reserve for the Service of God only the worst Part of our Lives.</HI> Thus <HI>to requite the</HI> LORD argues a vile and wrethched Heart. What?
<PB N="38" REF="004829_0026_100DEEC01EEDEC48"/>can we think of devoting the best of our Time and Strenght to the Service of our own Lusts, to gratify the Flesh and serve the Devil; and of turning off GOD with the Leaving<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lusts? What! think of devoting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>rime and Strength to the Service of Sin, and when <HI>the evil Days come, in which we cannot find Plea∣sure</HI> in gratifying our Lusts, devote that Time to God! How vile is the Thought! and wor∣thy of Hell!</P>
<P>Surely, such cannot be thought less blame worthy than those, the Prophet complains of. <HI>Mal.

<P>Methinks our Language doth not furnish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with Words emphatical enô to represent the Baseness, execrable Ingratitude and horrible Wickedness of Purposing thus to treat the most High and Glorious GOD, to whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are indebred for Being and every Mercy, — Or, the indignation and sacred Rage, with which our Minds should rise against the de∣tetable Thought.</P>
<P>GOD is full of Compassion, infinite in Good∣ness and Clemency, as well as in his other Per∣fections,
<PB N="39" REF="004829_0026_100DEEC01EEDEC48"/>or we might conclude, the Heavens would never bear such an Indignity as this, at the Hands of impious Mortals. It declares GOD to be unspeakably good, if the Heavens don't immediately gather Blackness; angry Storms arise, and devouring Lightning blast the impious Wretch, that thus presumes to treat his GOD</P>
<P>And, it God spares a While, the Wretch that lives in Sin, and presumer that God will accept the Lees of it's Life, may jostly fear, that er'e while provoked Wrath will break out upon it.</P>
<P>And, if now there be one Soul of us, that entertains the base Tho't and Purpose of thus requiting GOD, let him seriously consider the <HI>Curse</HI> denounced against <HI>the Deceiver, which hath in his Flack a Male, and voweth and sacrificeth unto the</HI> LORD <HI>a corrupt Thing, Mal. i.</HI> 14.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Our whole life-Time is not too much to be devoted to the service of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Why should we not be willing to devote our best Time, yea our whole Time to the Service of GOD? We are his, and to him we owe our selves; and he may justly claim our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eft and constant Service; We have <HI>been born, and carried by him</HI> from <HI>the Womb: And even to the old alge</HI> of any GOD <HI>is he, Isa, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lvi.</HI> 3, 4.
<PB N="40" REF="004829_0027_100DFD2AF9870148"/>'Tis GOD that upholds and provides for us al our Life-time; and therefore justly claims the Whole.</P>
<P>Or, do we think our Life will be too long to be devoted to the Honour of the Infinite GOD? Why; can we ever <HI>utter the Memory</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all God's wonderful Works, shew forth all hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Praise and declare all his Greatness, that we think his Service will be too Little for our whole Lives?

<P>And can we then think the best Life, that such poor imperfect Creatures as we can at∣tain unto, too good an Offering for God? Or, can we think so small a Space as that of the Life of Man in this World, too much for the Service of GOD? Surely, if we have any such Thot's, we have no becoming Apprehensions of the infinite Glories of GOD and our Ob∣ligations to Him.</P>
<P>And indeed, had we but any suitable Know∣lege of GOD and our selves, we should see, that it must be Grace in GOD, that he will accept of our Service, when we have done our
<PB N="41" REF="004829_0027_100DFD2AF9870148"/>Best; that such Service as we can yield unto God, tho' it be of our whole Life-time, is but an imperfect offering.</P>
<P N="9">9. Consider, <HI>How sollicitous and importunate your Friends are for your early Conversion.</HI></P>
<P>O ye Children and Youth, did you know, how much your Souls Salvation lay upon the Hearts of your Parents and Friends; did you know their Concern for you; how they <HI>travail in Birth again, until Christ be formed in you;</HI> how often upon the bended Knees of their Souls, they are Wrestling with God for you; Me∣thinks you could not, but be concerned for your selves.</P>
<P>How much have our Parents undergone, and done for us? And shall we not trie to let them have some Comfort and Rejoicing in us? Now, Nothing will more rejoice their Hearts, than to see us <HI>walking in the Truth; remembring our Creator in the Days of our Youth.</HI></P>

10. <HI>If we early turn to the LORD, and sincerely devote our selves to his Service; there will be ground to hope for the Continuance of GOD's Presence, when our Fathers are gone, and the rising Genera∣tion comes in their Place.</HI></P>
<P>The Fathers don't live for ever: <HI>One Gene∣ration passeth away, and another Generation cometh.</HI></P>
<P>Now in all Generations, 'tis the Blessing of the LORD, and his gracious Presence, that maketh a happy People.</P>
<P>Our Fathers have been bless'd with the Presence of GOD: He hath dwelt with and among Them: They have seen his Power, and rejoiced in his Grace. Ask them, and they will speak highly for GOD, and give in large Testimonies for him: They have found him a good GOD: By Him they have been often delivered in Dangers helped in Weakness, sa∣ved in Troubles: GOD has often supported them, when they have been ready to faint and to sink; done for them at such dark Times, when vain was the Help of Man. <HI>They have trusted in GOD, and he has delivered them.</HI> In a Word, GOD hath been their Patron, their Defence and Glory; and <HI>great is his Goodness, which he hath wrought for them.</HI></P>
<P>And how much is it to be desired and wished, that those who are next coming upon the Stage, might also <HI>be accounted to the LORD
<PB N="43" REF="004829_0028_100DFD2EB7CCBE88"/>for a Generation?</HI> That when the Fathers <HI>are gathered to their People,</HI> and <HI>fallen asleep</HI> you may still have GOD among You; a GOD near at Hand to do for You; and to whom you may repair at all Times.</P>
<P>Well, if you, that are in your Youth, may be awakened to Repentance, and be perswaded in good Earnest to set your selves to seek and to serve GOD; You may hope that your Fa∣ther's GOD will be your GOD: So <HI>David</HI> en∣courages us in that well known Exhortation to his Son, 1 <HI>Chron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> xxviii.</HI> 9. — <HI>My Son, know thou the</HI> GOD <HI>of thy Father, and serve him with a perfect Heart, and with a willing Mind: — If thou</HI> SEEK <HI>Him, he will be</HI> FOUND <HI>of thee.—</HI></P>
<P>But if our Youth will not regard the Works of the LORD, nor be awakened to Repen∣tance; if they will make light of their Fathers GOD; slight his Warnings, and reject his Counsels, what a Generation! and what a sad Time will it be, when the Fathers are gone! when the Glory shall be departed, and GOD have forsaken those that may be left!</P>
<P>We can scarce imagine the Wretchedness of such a Generation. <HI>Forsaken of GOD!</HI> 'tis a Kind of Damnation upon Earth! an Emblem of the Punishment of the Damned, <HI>who are pu∣nished with everlasting Destruction from the Pre∣sence of the LORD!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="004829_0029_100DFD31A3E5F100"/>
If GOD shall withdraw his Holy Spirit and forsake us, we shall be left in the Hands and Power of Satan; shall be <HI>taken captive by him at his Will;</HI> and be drawn by him from Sin to Sin, from one degree of Wickedness to Another, 'till we have filled up the Measure of our Ini∣quities. The God of this World, <HI>the spirit that now worketh in the Children of disobedience,</HI> will rule in us &amp; lord it over us, and drive us along the Road of Death &amp; Misery: So that we shall Jay up amazing Treasures of Wrath against the day of Wrath. And in the mean Time we shall be wretched, while imployed in the sor∣did Service of Satan. Our Reason will be in slav'd to Passion and Lust: We shall eagerly pursue Vanities that will deceive and disap∣point us: Our Minds will he disorder'd, rest∣less and unquiet: Evil Passions will distract our Tho'ts, and prey upon our Hearts like Fu∣ries of Hell. And such will be the Pride of our abandon'd Hearts, that a spirit of discon∣tent will fill our Souls with continual Vexation. A guilty Conscience also may likely often tor∣ture us with sad Reflections. Moreover, be∣sides these inward Miseries that attend un∣happy Souls forsaken of God, captiv'd by Sa∣tan and led along the Paths of Sin, we may ex∣pect if GOD withdraw his Holy Spirit, and leaves us to the Counsels of our corrupt Hearts, Abundance of outward Evils to attend us is
<PB N="45" REF="004829_0029_100DFD31A3E5F100"/>the World. Sin and Wickedness will so pre∣vail, that Men will likely be Plagues and Cur∣ses to each Other. Violence. Falsehood and Oppression will reign; mutual Confidence &amp; Trust be banished from among Men; <HI>Confusion and every evil Work</HI> prevail. Then, if there shall be some Few not given up with the Reft to the Power of Satan, they may with good Reason turn themselves to GOD for Help, &amp; complain as the Psalmist, <HI>Psal. xii</HI> 1, 2. <HI>Help,</HI> LORD, <HI>for the godly Man ceaseth; for the Faith∣ful fial from among the Children of Men! They speak Vanity every One with his Neighbour: with flattering Lips, and with a double Heart do they speak.</HI> Yea doubtless, as the Psalmist, they would mourn in their Complaint, and say, <HI>O that I had Wings like a Dove! for then would I flie away, and be at Rest. Lo then would I wander far off: and remain in the Wilderness, Psal. lv.</HI> 6, 7.</P>
<P>Now, would it not be sad, if when our Fa∣thers shall have left us, such Times should fol∣low; GOD be withdrawn, Faithfulness de∣parted from among Men, Religion and it's blessed Fruits retired and gone; and in the Room of these, Satan lording, Sin prevailing, Wickedness destroying, and all Evils aboun∣ding?</P>
<P>Let us then by early Repentance and Reli∣gion, secure an Interest in the Favour of our Father's GOD; that so we may hope, he will
<PB N="46" REF="004829_0030_100DFD3331531EF8"/>not forsake us, but dwell with us, and carry on his own Work in the Midst of us, when they are taken away.</P>
<P>If these Considerations be weighed and laid to Heart by us, I cannot but hope the Exhor∣tation will come with Force upon us, that we early turn to the LORD by true Repentance, and seek his Favour by an early Choice of Re∣ligion. <HI>O that the Spirit of the LORD then,</HI> who can effectually open the Heart, and make Way for his Truths to enter into our Souls, <HI>would impress these Considerations upon your Minds, and cause them to sink deep into your Hearts; that so you may be effectually stirred up to seek the LORD and his Favour in this Your Day, before the evil Day comes.</HI></P>
<P>Before I conclude this Discourse, let me plead with all the Earnestness I possibly can; and Oh! that I could do it in a more moving Way, and in a deeper Sense of the Worth of your Souls! I say, let me plead with you, and intreat of you, consider what hath been of∣fered, and to suffer your selves to be prevail'd with by such weighty Motives to receive the Exhortation, take the Warning given, and speedily prepare to meet GOD. My dear Brethren, <HI>Children in Charge,</HI> for your own Sake, for your Friend's Sake, for your poor Minister's Sake be intreated. Why will you
<PB N="47" REF="004829_0030_100DFD3331531EF8"/>not hearken, and consider? Why will you susse the God of this World to blind your Eves? Why will you so expose your precious, immortal Souls, and abide in the Way of GOD's Indignation? Why will you run so dreadful a Venture of Meeting the Almigh cloathed with Vengeance, and armed with the Instruments of his devouring Wrath? Oh! consider the awful and amazing Threatnings against the Sinner; open your Eyes, behold the preparing Storm of Wrath! see the ga∣thering Clouds! and who shall be able to abide the Storm, or stand before the Indignation? <HI>Whose Heart can endure,</HI> or <HI>Hands be strong,</HI> when he comes forth <HI>in the Fierceness of his Anger,</HI> the <HI>Mountains</HI> shaking, the <HI>Hills</HI> moving, the <HI>Earth</HI> trembling <HI>at his Presence, Yea, the World, and all that dwell therein?</HI> I hope, that None of you, the Youth of my Charge &amp; Love, will harden your selves against the threatned Vengeance, and the Terrors of GOD's Wrath: For, alas! how soon, when the threatned Storm shall come, will your Countenances change, your Courage fail, and you cry for Mercy, and wish you had hearkened and prepared your selves to meet the LORD? I hope you may never know by Experience the Dreadfulness of being pursued, overtaken &amp; bor'n down by the Ven∣geance of an angry GOD, as his implacable &amp; obstinate Enemies must. It raises Pity, and is
<PB N="48" REF="004829_0031_100DFD356A9B8FF0"/>affecting only to think of the Dreadfulness of the Day of the LORD to such poor Crea∣tures! What will they do! What can they say! — How confounded &amp; amazed will they stand before their Judge! Oh then, be intreated before the Day come, to reconcile your selves to GOD; and make Hast, lest it be too late.</P>
<P>Methinks I don't know how to conclude, or leave off Intreating, till I may hope some are perswaded in Earrest to seek the LORD</P>
<P>And yet, there is this melancholy Tho't in Labouring with you, <HI>Namely,</HI> That if you will not be perswaded, nor hearken, the Day of the LORD's Wrath will be so much the more dreadful to You. The Warning of GOD not considered, nor laid to Heart, will make the Day more dreadful; and this Discourse and Exhortation meant in Love to your Souls, will make it worse: For you will likely hear how you receive this very Exhortation. If you hearken, you will likely, many a Time bless GOD for it; and if you refuse, alas! it will be a Witness against you: Conscience will say, when your Calamity comes, Ah! You was warned, intreated, and you would not hear; and your Judge will say, <HI>I have called, and ye refused; you set at Nought all my Counsel, and would none of my Reproof.</HI></P>
<P>Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me then, with all the Seriousness and Solemnity I can, Charge you, that you so im∣prove
<PB N="49" REF="004829_0031_100DFD356A9B8FF0"/>this Exhortation, as that in the Day of the LORD, when You and I must stand before my LORD and Master, who hath sent me unto You, I need not be forced to give in Witness against You.</P>
<P>Would to GOD, that, when I must come before my Master at his Judgment-Seat, to give an Account of what I have done, with Respect to the Souls committed to my Charge, (tremble my Soul in holy Fear, remembring the Solemn Day) I say, would to GOD, that I need not have to bring in Testimony against them! And particularly, Dear Children of my Care, that I need not have to say against You, that on this Day! I warned You, intreated and pleaded with You, and you would not hear!</P>
<P>Be intreated then, to take this Warning, and comply with this Exhortation, and turn to the LORD: So shall my Soul rejoice, even mine; and You your selves will be so far from repenting of it, that it will make your Hearts glad for ever.</P>
<P>It seems to me, that Nothing would seem too much that was in my Power, if I could but gain you for Christ: How willingly would I spend all my S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rength in Intreating, if that would do? How willingly would I make my Self your Seryant, and intreat upon my Knees,
<PB N="50" REF="004829_0032_100DFD386F08B5E0"/>if that would do? But, alas! what can a weak, insufficient Creature do? <HI>Oh that the All∣powerful GOD would undertake, and make you willing, by his powerful Grace!</HI></P>
<P>I want, Methinks to know whither there are None perswaded, and fain would hope that there are some, whose Hearts are over∣come. And for my Encouragement, there appear some Countenances, shewing as if they were effected, concerned and intended to hear. But then, I am afraid, lest in a little Time, they forget themselves; their Concern vanish, and <HI>their Goodness be at the Morning Cloud, and as the early Dew that passeth away;</HI> that in a little While they will forgot the Exhortation, slight the Warning, and return to carnal Ease and their former Carelessness, <HI>At this my Heart trembleth, and</HI> almost <HI>moves out of his Place: Even when I remember, I am afraid, and Trembling taketh Hold an my Flesh!</HI> O that it might not be so, but that the Impression may abide!</P>
<P>How ever fincerely, my Friends, I disire and long for your Soul's Salvation; how willingly so ever I would do, what I may to promote the same, yet I can do no more than I can. The Success of my poor weak Endeavour I must leave with GOD, in whose Hands are the Hearts of Men.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="004829_0032_100DFD386F08B5E0"/>
If GOD graciously inclines your Hearts, and you are brought to be willing to receive his Word, GOD shall have the Praise; the Glory will be His. If you will not hearken, and find not Mercy with GOD, my Soul shall weep for you; and by Reason of that Rela∣tion I stand in to You, that Charpe divine Providence has committed to me, and that Love which I think I have to your Souls, I must have continual G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ief and Sorrow for You.</P>
<P>But <HI>whether you will hear,</HI> or <HI>whether you w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r∣bear,</HI> I will offer these Two Directions to you; with which I purpose to conclude.</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>Endeavour to Know your selves</HI> It cannot be expected, that any Motives will prevail with us to turn to the LORD, and make it our Concern to secure his Favour, if we know not what we are, nor our Relation unto GOD.</P>
<P>Now, 'tis one Part of the Misery men are naturally fallen into, that they know not themselves; Know not that Manner of Persons they are, nor what is their State towards GOD. <HI>Destruction and Misery are in their Ways,</HI> and they know it no</P>
<P>Hence it is easily accounted for, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the most weigh∣ty Arguments, used to perswade them <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reconciled unto GOD,</HI> come but with little Force, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they know not their natural Alienation from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. From the same Reason it is, that they are not filled with any great Concern, when the Terrors of the LORD are mentioned, and GOD's Judgments are abroad in the Earth: Not being acquainted with their own Guilt, and the Power of Sin and Death in their Souls, they ap∣prehend not their Danger, and Exposedness unto the same. Nor is it much to be wondred at, if Men live in Vain, run into Misry &amp; Ruin, so long as they know not what they are, what they were made or live for, nor what is the State of their Souls. Let every One then, be concerned &amp; take Pains to know himself; what he is, what is his last End, what is the State of his Soul.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="004829_0033_100DFD3B8086B078"/>
And seeing that all Men are fallen into a State <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Death; become depraved and corrupted; Children o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Wrath, obnoxious to all Miseries, <HI>Temporal, Spirtu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and Eternal;</HI> Let every one endeavour to search o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Plague of his own Heart; to become acquainte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the Corruption of his Natute, and his Expo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣sedness to the Judgments of GOD.</P>
<P>A true Accquaintance with our own natural Poverty Nakedness and Misery, would lead us in Earnest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tremble at GOD's Judgments, and enquire, <HI>What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must do to be Saved.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>Acquaint your selves with Christ, the Saviour, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only Name given under Heaven among Men, whereby <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must be saved.</HI> Endeavou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to know who Christ is, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was his Ensiness into the World what he has don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and offers to do for Sinners. And, O that you kne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him as he is represented in the Gospel! As our S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣viour said to the Samaritan Woman, if you knew th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Gift of GOD, you would ask of him, and he would give you living Water. See <HI>Joh. 10.</HI> 10.</P>
<P>We must not how ever think, that every One that has learned to tell semething of the Scripture Ac∣count of Christ, so know him as will infallibly lead him to ask and receive the Grace of Christ. There is a sort of Knowlege that is fruitless and vain; it does not move the Heart, nor influence the Life But the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there is a Knowlege of Christ that is saving, was<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and draws the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul So to know Christ is Life Oh, let us then wait <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>o: <HI>the Fatherof of Lights;</HI> and beg that he would <HI>shine in cur Hearts; give unto us to know the Mystery of the Kingdom of Heaven;</HI> make us to know the Voice of Chust; give us such a Discovery of him, as that we may b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Inamour'd with his Excellencies; esteem <HI>him as the ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efest among ten Thousand;</HI> yield up our Hearts with Plealure to him; chuse him for our LORD and Righ∣teousness, loving and resolving to <HI>Worship Him.</HI></P>
