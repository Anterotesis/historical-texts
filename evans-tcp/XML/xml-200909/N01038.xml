<OPENER><SALUTE>Friendly Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>We have had <HI>G. Fox's</HI> Will several times printed, (both in <HI>England</HI> and here in <HI>America</HI>) as it lies to be seen in the Prerogative Office in <HI>London,</HI> wherein there is scarce two Lines good Sence or English; and these two Letters are a Confir∣mation of his Learning; for by the first, we see, he could not write the date of the Year or spell his own Name right; how then was he capable to write a Book, notwithstanding the many Books the <HI>Quakers</HI> have so impudently published in his Name, especially his Journal, craftily drest up by their chief Wits, that People in after Times might not suspect the <HI>Quakers</HI> great Apostle to be such a Buzard as he was. But this is <HI>Quaker</HI> Plainness and Sin∣cerity.</P>
<P>His Book, called, <HI>A Primmer for all the Doctors and Schollars, &amp;c.</HI> of 2434 Queries, wherein he is set up as Head and Tutor to all <HI>Europe,</HI> that the World might think him to be a Learned Person: This also is <HI>Quaker</HI> Plainness and Sincerity.</P>
<P>Likewise, his Book called, <HI>A Battledoor,</HI> of the Interpretation of 20 or 30 Languages, when he understood not one of them, by
<PB N="6" REF="001235_0005_0FB182E7E5FE8060"/>which the poor deluded <HI>Quakers</HI> were made to believe that <HI>G. Fox</HI> had the Gift of Tongues by Inspiration, as the Apostles had at Penticost. But this is proved a Cheat; for it is discovered that the <HI>Quakers</HI> hired certain learned Men to do it for them: They gave one <HI>Jew</HI> Thirty Pounds to do the greatest part of it, and <HI>G. Fox</HI> only put his Name to it, as the Author, to deceive. This is also <HI>Quaker</HI> Sincerity. Yet the present Followers of the <HI>Quakers</HI> will not believe this; so strong is the Spirit of Delusion, when once it has seized the Soul.</P>
<P>Yet by the Mercy of God, some who have not shut their Eyes so hard, have discovered the <HI>Quakers,</HI> especially by seeing what a wicked course this <HI>Fox</HI> took to answer his Opponents Books, <HI>viz.</HI> by picking 10, 12 or 14 words out of a Sentence of 20 or 30 words, and transposing them, and placing them so as to turn their sound and Christian Sayings into Heresie &amp; Non-sence, and then answer them as their Sayings. Nay, sometimes he would charge his Op∣ponent with the <HI>Qrs.</HI> Heresie or Error he was writing against. And the <HI>Qrs.</HI> knowing their own Guiltiness in this case, would hide it by charging their Opposers with the same base Method of answer∣ing their Books. But this they charge without Proof, only to amuse. I say, some seeing these ways of <HI>Fox,</HI> are convinced that he was an Instrument of Satan, and not of God, and shewed them by what Power and Spirit he took upon him to throw aside Christs Ordinances, and instead thereof set up his Womanish Inventions of Female Prelates, and his honourable Courts of Women, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed, his Denyal of the Ordinances of BAPTISM and the SUPPER of our LORD, and counting them as Humane Inventions, Carnal and Devilish, is alone sufficient to prove to all who are not bewitched with the same Spirit, that he was a Minister of <HI>Anti-christ.</HI> And because all Christians from the Apostles to his Time had continued in the Practice of these Ordi∣nances, he had no way to confirm his Followers in a Belief that he had Power to put an end to them, but by declaring himself to be EQUAL WITH GOD, and set up for a Worker of Miracles, by the same Authority as Christ did; for you shall find in his Journal, in the third Table, his vile and sensless Miracles are said to be done by the Power of God, Not in the Name of JESUS, as the Apostles wrought Miracles, but in his own Name, by the
<PB N="7" REF="001235_0006_0FB182E9B7579A40"/>Power of God, To whom, (he blasphemously said) <HI>He was Equal,</HI> as his Books testifie. And upon this account the <HI>Quakers</HI> Idolize their great Apostle <HI>FOX,</HI> and his Inventions set up instead of Christs Ordinances, as the <HI>Turks</HI> Idolize their Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s And were the <HI>Quakers</HI> but in Power, and half so Numerous as the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> we should soon see they would as little bear to hear their <HI>FOX</HI> spoken against, as they their <HI>Mahomet.</HI> And unless, it please God to contiue Watch-men upon the Walls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this De∣lusion may prove as dangerous as that of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> because it carries with it a Pretence of <HI>Christianity,</HI> under the Guise of an out∣side Righteousness; <HI>Ministers of Satan</HI> (saith St. <HI>Paul</HI>) <HI>Transform∣ing themselves as Ministers of Righteousness, whose End shall be accor∣ding to their Works,</HI> 2 Cor. 11.15.</P>
<P>And to speak it with Commisseration; Have we not seen this to be the Self Righteous end of the <HI>Quakers?</HI> for never any right <HI>Quaker</HI> has been known to dye with a <HI>Lord have mercy upon him</HI> in his Mouth!</P>
<P>For their Foundation Principle being the same with the <HI>Heathen Deists,</HI> as they Live, so they dye in the Mode most in voge among the <HI>Deists, viz.</HI> Hard without any sence of Christ or of revealed Religion, trusting only to what is within them, the which, one calls Light, the other <HI>Reason,</HI> and in which both <HI>Quakers</HI> and <HI>Deists</HI> do magnifie themselves.</P>
<P>Now because <HI>W. Penn</HI> extols this <HI>Fox</HI> in the Preface to his Journal, for his wonderful depth in Divinity and his extraordinary Gift in opening Scripture, and would go to the Marrow of things. Therefore take two or three proofs as follow.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> In his Book of Distinction between the Two Suppers, p. 21. he quotes 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 17.18. <HI>But</HI> Hymen<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us and Philetus [says he] <HI>concerning the truth erred, who said the Resurrection was past already, such overthrew People from the Faith that stands in Christ, who is the Resurrection and the Life, through which Faith they attained to the Resurrection, and had their vile Bodyes changed, and made like unto his Glorious Body.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> How he preverts the Scripture both in words and sence, to defend their Heresie, denying the Resurrection of the Body after Death; for the words of Scripture, <HI>Who shall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our vile Bodyes,</HI> Respect the time to come at the Resurrection of the dead, but <HI>Fox</HI> will have it that they have <HI>Already</HI> attained the Resurrection,
<PB N="8" REF="001235_0007_0FB182EAE3BDBFF0"/>and had their vile bodies changed. Also, he makes the Resurrection that <HI>Paul</HI> Preached, <HI>Acts</HI> 17.19, 22. and 23.6. to be Christ himself, perverting our Saviours words, who called himself the Resurrection and the Life, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> litteral sence, which is plain [to all intelligent persons] contains a figurative sence, to wit, the Author and Cause of the Resurrection; As when God is called in Scripture the Saints Hope, Confidence and Salvation, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Author and Cause of their Hope, Confidence and Salvation.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> In his Book, called, <HI>Truths Defence</HI> p. 49, 50. in answer to his opponent, he quotes 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.29. and says, <HI>The Ministers of God they spake to the Spirits in Prison, and the Prisoner shall come out of Prison. The Son of Perdition is above all that is called God in thee — Thou art one that keeps the Light in Prison in thee.</HI> [And in answer to the Question, Whether the Devil is stronger then Christ, the Flesh than the Spirit; or, Whether dost thou find he was ever a Priso∣ner in Satans Chains? <HI>Fox</HI> answers, <HI>We witness he was in Satans Chains, and is in thee, else how could they crucify him afresh?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> At what a sensless rate he here perverts the Scripture, and all to prove his Blasphemy, <HI>viz.</HI> to prove that God is imprisoned, and in Bondage in Wicked Men, bound in Satans Chains in men: For the Spirits in Prison, whereof <HI>Peter</HI> writes in that place, were sometimes disobedient in the days of <HI>Noah,</HI> as the following words expresly declare. But how could Christ in them be disobedient, and not only Spirits, but disobedient Spirits? Are not these Rare instances of <HI>Fox</HI> his wonderful Depth and extraordinary Gift of Opening Scripture, and going to the Marrow of things, as <HI>W. Penn</HI> by his wit has there Romanced? I could give many the like Instan∣ces to prove that his understanding in Divinity was equal to that of his Schollarship aforesaid.</P>
<P>But to be short; I shall leave his Books, which have all passed through the <HI>Index ex Purgitor<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI> of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> before they were published, and will conclude with a passage taken from his Mouth, which is a more perfect Proof of his Parts and Learning, being a short Dispute which he maintained against <HI>T. S.</HI> at <HI>Cambridge, Aug.</HI> 1699. in company with <HI>G. Whitehead,</HI> and another <HI>Quaker,</HI> about the Trinity. The said <HI>T S.</HI> argued thus; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>

<P>Hereat some langhing, <HI>Fox</HI> answerd, <HI>That he was seen, but not</HI> visible.</P>
<P>Surely (said one) his Religion, Reason and Wits are all lost, for he runs beyond Reason and Sence to defend his Tenet.</P>
<P>Behold! how this wonderful deep <HI>Fox</HI> was confounded in de∣fending this Heresie, which was the heresie of <HI>Sabellius,</HI> who affir∣med, <HI>That in the divine Essence, there were three Names,</HI> but denyed that there were <HI>Three distinct Subsistences or Persons,</HI> as <HI>Fox</HI> and the <HI>Quakers</HI> do. Now the Name [<HI>Person</HI>] was warrantably applyed to the holy Trinity by the antient Fathers, for Reasons too large to set down here; but most properly the name Person is applyed, because personal acts are throughout the Scripture ascribed both to Father, Son and holy Ghost.</P>
<P>But here we have one Proof more of <HI>W. Penns</HI> Sincerity in that
<PB N="10" REF="001235_0009_0FB182EF66A84938"/>he says, <HI>G.

</TEXT></Q>
<P><HI>OBserve, Reader:</HI> He that engages to Defend to the utmost of his Power, according to the common sense of the words, He does Engage to do it both in Person and Estate, [if he has it] for so all the World understands the words [Defend to the Utmost of Our Power] I say this is the common sense of the words, let the <HI>Quakers</HI> deny it if they can or dare.</P>
<P>And you see above, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> have ingaged to Defend to the Utmost of their Power, according to the common sense of the words; Therefore they have engaged to do it in Person and Estate, as their Ability, and Occasion is. And yet almost in the next breath, they declare they cannot do it in Person. Can such Equivocators as these be fit Persons to be trusted in the Goverment?</P>
<P>But will they Defend with their Estates? Will they pay to main∣tain War or Fighting? Have they no mental Evasion or secret Re∣servation in this? for we see (as above) that they have solemnly declared, they have none: Yes indeed, they have; for since the year 1660 'tis known to be the <HI>Quakers</HI> avowed Principle to deny to pay, and cannot pay so much as one penny to maintain War or Fighting. And this <HI>Samuell Jenings</HI> asserted before my Lord <HI>Cornbury</HI> at the Council Table at <HI>Amboy,</HI> the whole Assembly being present, <HI>viz. That they could no more pay towards War or Fighting, than they could Fight or bear Arms.</HI></P>
<P>Behold here! The <HI>Quakers</HI> have first engaged to defend the <HI>Queen,</HI> &amp;c. to the utmost of their Power, and that as Defence is commonly understood, without Evasion or Reservation whatso∣ever, and yet at the same time declare their Intentions are, Not to do it neither in Person nor Estate: This is such an Equivocating Contradiction, as is not [I believe] to be parallelled in the whole
<PB N="12" REF="001235_0011_0FB182F288EC0EC0"/>World. The <HI>Jesuites</HI> of <HI>Old-Rome</HI> are but Dunces to these <HI>Quakers;</HI> Let the Nimble Fingured Miller, <HI>C. Pusey,</HI> tell us in his next Print, how and which way they can defend the <HI>Queen,</HI> &amp;c. to the Utmost of their Power, and yet neither do it in Person nor Estate, and that too, as [Defend] is commonly understood; if he can do this, and clear his Brethern from the Guilt of Perjury, I will then be engaged he shall be set in the Legend for a Worker of Miracles along with the great <HI>Fox,</HI> and the rest of the Saints both of <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New-Rome;</HI> Mean time, let the World Judge of this peice of <HI>Quaker</HI>-Sincerity.</P>
<P>But I must do <HI>S. Jenings</HI> Justice in this case, for he also said, that they did not expect to be gainers by refusing to pay; meaning (I suppose) that their Goods might be taken from them. But this is what they have always called Persecution; therefore this makes the matter worse; for here the <HI>Queen</HI> and those in Authority un∣der her are rendered Persecutors, and by the <HI>Quaker</HI>-Chronicles pass for such in the next Age. Now this is at least a passive Disobe∣dience to the Law; and is not their defending in any respect, much less a doing it to the Utmost of their Power, heartily and willingly declared?</P>
<P>I say again, What Government can be safe in trusting to such a Quick-Silver Tribe of men, whom no words will tye, though never so expresly spoken? And they are the same in most other matters. As in Swearing, they cannot in Conscience Swear, but they can take an Oath, and their Conscience in this Country is tayled to their Brethrens Conscience in <HI>England;</HI> for the Magistrates here could not perswade their Conscience, [for some time] to take their own New Oath, till they heard that their Brethren took it in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But now, Suppose the <HI>French</HI> should beset us: The <HI>Quakers</HI> count themselves no way engaged to assist us in defence of out <HI>Queen</HI> and <HI>Country,</HI> Therefore they are free, (if any tempting occasion offer) to Joyn with the <HI>French</HI> against us. For, as to their Saying, they cannot for Conscience sake bear Arms to Fight, or [as they word it] use Force and Arms; this is Deceipt and a Lye, as I could instance in several matters of fact: One pregnant Proof of this has happened so lately as the last <HI>August,</HI> in the County of <HI>Burlington,</HI> wher a report was, that a part of <HI>French</HI> were Lucking
<PB N="13" REF="001235_0012_0FB182F3ED462DF0"/>about a Branch of <HI>Anco<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u Creek,</HI> the <HI>Quakers</HI> thereabouts got to∣gether in Arms, in a Military posture, with their Guns charged, to meet the <HI>French;</HI> but you must Note, it was on their own ac∣count, not at the Command of the Government, that they thus took up Arms; Therefore what their design was, who can tell, seeing no Credit can be given to what they say or subscribe; but it must be either to Defend themselves, or Joyn with the <HI>French</HI> against us▪ If to defend themselves, that they so bore Arms, surely they ought much rather to do it at the Command of the Govern∣ment. No, say they we cannot for Conscience sake do that. And thus do they make a Stalking-horse of Conscience. This is <HI>Quaker</HI> Sincerity, being Hypocrisie at the least, grand Hypocrisie, and ought to be noticed by the Government.</P>
<P>Now let not <HI>C. Pusey</HI> in his next Print tell us, this is a Lye, and that these were no <HI>Quakers</HI> that thus bore Arms, for they are ap∣proved <HI>Quakers,</HI> Listed as such under the <HI>Quaker</HI>-Banner, by Certi∣ficate under the hands of <HI>Burlington</HI>-Meeting-Men, and by them given in to the Military Officers; and that they thus bore Arms is too obvious to be denyed by any but such as are endued with the above-mentioned <HI>Quaker</HI>-Sincerity. From which, <HI>Good Lord Deliver us.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Post-script.</HEAD>
<P>SInce the fore-going was written, I met with the <HI>Quaker</HI>-Alma∣nack, put out by <HI>J. T.</HI> and <HI>C. P.</HI> for this year 1705. 'Tis a Two-handed Piece, wherein they wou'd make their Readers think, that they have Conquor'd me on both sides. One will have me to be a meer Ignoramus in Art, and 'tother a Renogado in Religion, and consequently it must be as they say, That I am not fit for <HI>Religious</HI> nor <HI>Civil Society.</HI> High Charges! But if this be the worst they can do to me, I think my self the more happy in that they have said as bad of some of the best Men of our Age.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="001235_0013_0FB182F585C441E0"/><HI>First,</HI> As to <HI>J. T</HI>'s Vapours against me, if it would edifie, or be of advantage to Mankind, I would Confute him; for 'tis some Errors of the Press which he harps most upon, and would make to be mine; nay, and he rakes them out of old Almanacks too; whenas he knows I could severely lash him with the same Whip from all his (calculated) Almanacks, and his Book too; but I have now other Fish to fry. His grudging me the use of his Book, is like selling me Roast-Meat, and then beating me with the Spit, but what less can I expect from a <HI>Quaker? Gad∣bury</HI> would have scorn'd to have done so by him, for copying after his Ephemerides several years in his Book. But in short, he is wellcome to me to go on with his Yearly Calculations; he has, (it may be) more leasure than I; and I shall make a shift to write an Almanack, (perhaps as true as his) either with his help or without it: And let him not be grieved that my Almanack sells better than his.</P>
<P>And as to <HI>C. Pusey</HI>'s Reply to my Almanack, he has not answer'd one quarter part of it, but runs upon other matters, to bring his Reader off from the Scent of their Heresies: In his Answers he copies after the <HI>London-Quakers</HI> Answers, and dares venture no further than they have done to his hands. As to other things he sees it his safest way to tell me, <HI>He has not seen the Books out which I brought my Quotations;</HI> and that he thinks is sufficient to Refute me; or else he tells me, <HI>G. K</HI>'s <HI>Quaker</HI>-Books say so and so. But this is hard patching up Religion, when one <HI>Quaker</HI>-Book must be brought to mend or justifie another. And as to the <HI>London-Quakers,</HI> alas! They are baffled in their Answers, and Confounded to their perpetual Shame, by the Author of the Book, called, <HI>The Snake in the Grass,</HI> in his <HI>Defence</HI> and <HI>Reply,</HI> as all who read those Books may see.</P>
<P>But has <HI>C. Pusey</HI> not one word to say to what I have charged of their Monstrous Notions concerning <HI>Christ?</HI> No. They still stand Guilty of the Charge often proved against them, <HI>viz. That when they speak or write of the Christians</HI> Christ, <HI>they mean not a word of what they say;</HI> for they will not say, nor dare not confess, <HI>That they believe in a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> now in Heaven, and that Christ is now, and forever to come, truly
<PB N="15" REF="001235_0014_0FB182F6EADAF280"/>and really a Man, in true and proper Humane Nature, With∣out all other men.</HI> No, They have been several Times pro∣voked to give us a Proof of their Sincerity, in answering to this Christian Confession, but they will not. And their refusing to confess to this, bewrays them, and discovers the Cloven Foot to all Intelligent Christians, and is another repeated Proof, <HI>That they Mean not a Word of what they say concerning Christ Without;</HI> and therefore are Implacable Enemies to the Christian Religion.</P>
<P>And whereas I noted in my Preface, That <HI>Peter Fretwell</HI> con∣demned <HI>Eliz. Fenton</HI> for being baptized, and that therefore she must know a bitter Day of Repentance; and that <HI>Mary Wheat</HI> confirmed the same. Now if there be occasion <HI>Eliz. Fenton</HI> will make Oath to the Truth of this before a Magistrate.</P>
<P>But behold what a sincere <HI>Quaker</HI>-Turn-off they have invented for this. Why, they say, <HI>It was for her evil Life and Conver∣sation that</HI> Fretwell <HI>said she must know a bitter Day of Repentance for, and not for being Baptized.</HI> But do they tell what this Evil was that she was guilty of? No, No; have a care of that; you shall not catch them there; for it was past their skill to tell that: They know that none of her Neighbours can charge her with so much as a Spot in her Life and Coversation, those many years that she has lived both a Wife and a Widdow among them: If they could, no doubt, we had had it in Print, now at this Pinch: Therefore let those her Accusers think of what Reward they must have for such slanderous Lyes against the Innocent.</P>
<P>But why wou'd the <HI>Quakers</HI> now deny their Banters against Baptism? Is it because they begin to be ashamed of them? Truly I should be glad to be an Instrument to bring them to that. No, but here is a <HI>Snake in the Grass,</HI> for they use their Arts of Confessing and Denying (as occasion requires) only to avoid the Odium of the World; for besides their former Outrage against Baptism (which they still justifie) <HI>C. Pusey</HI> in pag. 3. (even while he would take his Friend <HI>Fretwell</HI> off from speaking against Baptism) does himself bring a bantering Scoff against it, and falsifies <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Bucer</HI> by perverting their sence to make them
<PB N="16" REF="001235_0015_0FB182F92B86BB10"/>speak against it too. And all this he does under a deceitful pre∣tence, That 'tis only <HI>Infant Baptism</HI> that the <HI>Quakers</HI> deny; whenas 'tis evident that both he and they shoot their poysoned Arrows against Baptism it Self. Their Practice proves this to all that know them, <HI>viz.</HI> That 'tis <HI>All manner of Water-Baptism</HI> which they deny: They Practise none.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>C. P.</HI> has the Impudence to deny [after his fashion] that <HI>W. Penn</HI> calls it <HI>Poyson, to believe or have faith in the History of Christs outward Manifestation.</HI> But what they expect to gain by this way of answering Books, I know not. But this I know, that several who were zealous <HI>Quakers</HI> have forsaken them for the sake of this very Doctrine of <HI>William Penn</HI>'s, and that other, where he denys <HI>The Outward Person,</HI> JESUS, <HI>who was born of the Virgin, to be properly the Son of God.</HI> I say, the <HI>Quakers</HI> refusing to condemn these two Doctrines of <HI>W. P.</HI> has caused many (and some very sensible Persons, as they know) to forsake their Society, Thanks be to God for it. And as the Proverb says, <HI>'Tis an ill Wind that blows no body Good.</HI></P>
<P>I shall conclude with one Instance of what I noted before, that C. P. wou'd lead his Reader from the Scent of their Heresies, by running from the Charge to other Matters▪ You must Note, that I had provoked him to say (if he durst) That they did the Scrip∣tures that honour as they did their own Books, <HI>viz.</HI> as ever to read so much as one Chapter of them in any of their Meetings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now <HI>C. Pusey</HI> knowing their own guiltiness in the case, instead of giving me a plain honest answer, he falls foul upon the Author of the <HI>Snake, &amp;c.</HI> and then brings Cirtificates to prove that their School-Boys read them in their Schools. But, Pray what is this to the purpose? Any body knows that the Bible is as necessary a Book to learn Schollars to read in, as another Book. But this is not reading them in their Meetings, as they do their own Books and Epistles. This is one of Friend <HI>Caleb</HI>'s go-by's, and this is <HI>Quaker</HI>-plainness too, which he gives instead of answers to me.</P>
