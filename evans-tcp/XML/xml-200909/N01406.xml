<HEAD>To my Honoured FRIENDS, the Mourn∣ful RELATIVES of the <HI>Deceased</HI> Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Wainwright.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT may doubtless become that <HI>Pastoral Rela∣tion</HI> which it has pleased the DIVINE PROVIDENCE to Honour Me with toward <HI>many of You,</HI> to give You this publick <HI>Expression</HI> of my <HI>deep Sympathy</HI> in your <HI>present Sorrow,</HI> and to <HI>minister</HI> as I am able to your <HI>Support</HI> under it, and <HI>Profit</HI> from it.</P>
<P>I pray GOD to <HI>Sanctifie</HI> to Your <HI>Selves,</HI> &amp; to your <HI>Families</HI> the many <HI>surprizing Breaches,</HI> which have within a <HI>few years</HI> been made upon that <HI>late Flourish∣ing part</HI> of your Family; and in particular the <HI>sudden Death</HI> of this <HI>Lovely</HI> BRANCH which we now mourn.</P>
<P>You had a great deal of <HI>Pleasure</HI> &amp; <HI>Comfort</HI> in Her the few days that GOD spar'd Her to you; nor did the <HI>Town</HI> show a <HI>Child</HI> more <HI>Amiable</HI> in Person, or more <HI>Innocent</HI> and Vertuous in Behaviour; of a more sweet <HI>Disposition,</HI> or seemingly better <HI>Inclin'd:</HI> not a <HI>Child</HI> scarce of greater <HI>Hopes,</HI> or more universally <HI>Esteem'd.</HI> So fair a <HI>Mind</HI> in so fair a <HI>Body</HI> was in∣deed worthy to be <HI>lov'd.</HI> Nor was <HI>She</HI> without the happy <HI>Signs</HI> of a Spirit of true <HI>Devotion</HI> toward GOD, as well as full of endearing <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Good∣ness, Humility</HI> and <HI>Meekness</HI> toward all whom She Conversed with: those <HI>Ornaments which are in the sight of GOD of great Price.</HI></P>

I shall never forget the <HI>Agonies of Distress</HI> I found <HI>You</HI> in, as <HI>Many</HI> of you as could suddenly get together on the <HI>Alarm</HI> of her Unexpected <HI>Change:</HI> Nor wou'd I have You to forget <HI>your own</HI> gracious Expressions of <HI>Humiliation</HI> and holy <HI>Fear, Submission</HI> and <HI>Adoration,</HI> in the transports of your Grief on that sad Occasion. O the <HI>Astonishing Spectacle</HI> we then had before our Eyes, of the <HI>Vanity</HI> of our <HI>Best Estate</HI> in this Life! What a poor thing are <HI>Riches,</HI> or <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Families,</HI> or any Earthly Enjoyments to build any <HI>Expecta∣tion</HI> on: <HI>Our dayes upon Earth are as a Shadow, and there is no abiding.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Many</HI> of You, my <HI>Good Friends,</HI> are in the Prime of Life, and <HI>some</HI> in your <HI>Youth,</HI> just En∣tring on a <HI>Vain World,</HI> in <HI>Superior Circumstances</HI> with respect to <HI>Outward</HI> Rank and Estate. Suffer me therefore to <HI>Exhort</HI> You to get above these <HI>empty transitory Temptations</HI> that do surround You, and endanger you. You have the more need to think often of <HI>Death,</HI> and of <HI>parting</HI> with every pleasant <HI>Object of Sense;</HI> to withdraw your Hearts from things below, and betimes to get that <HI>Faith</HI> in CHRIST, and in the <HI>Life to come,</HI> which is <HI>the Victory that overcometh the World.</HI> The more GOD has <HI>given</HI> You of <HI>this</HI> World, the more are you obliged to <HI>devote</HI> your selves to the Service of GOD in your Generation, as <HI>good Stewards</HI> of those <HI>Talents</HI> He has put into your Hands.</P>
<P>Suppose that GOD should <HI>call</HI> one or other of <HI>You</HI> to <HI>die,</HI> as suddenly as He call'd away your
<PB N="iii" REF="001671_0004_0FB4E271410C6AD8"/><HI>dear</HI> and <HI>blooming Relative</HI> a few days ago, amidst your <HI>Acquisition</HI> of Riches, and just as you have bro't all your <HI>Designs</HI> to bear for this World; have you considered how to give up all these <HI>Abor∣tive</HI> Labours and <HI>frustrated</HI> Hopes? Have you set your Eyes and Heart upon a <HI>Better World?</HI></P>
<P>I'm sure You must needs agree with me, that this is your <HI>Wisdom</HI> and true Interest, and will be your <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Comfort</HI> Living and Dying.</P>
<P>I heartily wish You this <HI>Grace;</HI> and pray GOD to make You great <HI>Blessings</HI> in your Day, to <HI>spare</HI> you long to live unto His own Service and Glory, and to <HI>Establish His Covenant</HI> with your <HI>Children,</HI> whom He gives you to bring up in His <HI>Fear.</HI></P>

<HEAD>TO THE Children Of the TOWN.</HEAD>
<P>I take this Opportunity to <HI>Address you,</HI> into whose hands this <HI>Sermon</HI> may come, for your <HI>Souls Good.</HI> You have seen many of your <HI>Own Age</HI> Buried in the <HI>Winter</HI> past; divers of <HI>whom</HI> died very hopefully, and made a gracious End. You have <HI>been Sick</HI> (most of you) <HI>your selves;</HI> and many of you may remember the Religious <HI>Frames</HI> you were then in, and the holy <HI>Desires</HI> and <HI>Purposes</HI> you then had. Some have been so wrought upon by their Danger, that I hope truly they have been bro't home to CHRIST. I wish the number of <HI>such</HI> were greater.</P>
<P>You are <HI>now,</HI> many of <HI>you,</HI> much <HI>affected</HI> with the <HI>Sudden Death</HI> of Mrs. <HI>Wainwright;</HI> and now while your Hearts are <HI>warm and tender,</HI> I wou'd press you to <HI>lay</HI> it to heart, and receive Instruction from it.</P>
<P>Which of <HI>you</HI> all are more <HI>likely</HI> or <HI>worthy</HI> to live than the <HI>Deceased Child was?</HI> Where is there any One among you <HI>fairer</HI> in Body or in Mind? Which of you have a fairer <HI>prospect</HI> for this World than
<PB N="v" REF="001671_0006_0FB4E27481F5C520"/><HI>She</HI> had? But that which was <HI>best</HI> of all, she appear'd to be <HI>Pious and Gracious.</HI></P>
<P>I remember well with what delight and <HI>thankful∣ness</HI> she once and again Entertained the good <HI>Coun∣sels</HI> and <HI>Exhortations</HI> I have given Her about Her <HI>Spiritual State.</HI> I have the <HI>Comfort</HI> now that I did my Duty toward Her in this particular, and it much <HI>Endear'd</HI> me to Her. I now call upon <HI>you, Child,</HI> while you read these <HI>Lines,</HI> that you mind your <HI>Soul,</HI> and <HI>pray</HI> to GOD daily, and <HI>fear to Sin,</HI> and make Religion your <HI>Business</HI> betimes; remem∣bring the <HI>Words</HI> of the LORD JESUS, which He spake <HI>when He was twelve year old,</HI> Luk. 2.49. <HI>Wist ye not that I must be about my Fathers Business!</HI></P>
<P>I have reason to think that the deceased <HI>Child</HI> was accustomed to <HI>Secret Prayer.</HI> They who have had Opportunity to <HI>Observe,</HI> have told me of her careful <HI>Retirements.</HI> Nor may I forget her gracious Care and Concern for her <HI>younger</HI> and <HI>only Sister,</HI> who lay dangerously Sick of a Fever but a few dayes before Her own death: <HI>Lucy,</HI> said she, do you <HI>pray to GOD now for your self? and did you pray before you were taken Sick?</HI> This looks as if <HI>she</HI> were no stranger unto <HI>Prayer</HI> her self. Her <HI>last words</HI> also were to ask the Prayers of Others for Her.</P>
<P>A <HI>Praying</HI> Child is, I hope, a <HI>Gracious</HI> One. <HI>Children,</HI> do you <HI>Pray</HI> to GOD daily for your Precious and Immortal Souls? Will you not be put upon doing so by this Example? May you not die so <HI>suddenly</HI> as not to have <HI>time</HI> to pray at last? Shou'd you not <HI>Adore</HI> the GRACE of GOD that <HI>spares</HI> you? and Improve the space He gives you? and say, as <HI>One</HI> of our Lovely <HI>Children</HI> did to Her <HI>Mother</HI> on this Occasion
<PB N="vi" REF="001671_0007_0FB4E2760D8CCFA0"/>GOD <HI>has many ways to bring Souls home to Him∣self, and it may be this is to be the means of bring∣ing me to Him.</HI></P>
<P>O that we cou'd see a <HI>serious Concern</HI> in our <HI>Children</HI> for their Everlasting Interests? how <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>grave</HI> and amiable wou'd they then be? how <HI>happy</HI> and <HI>safe</HI> under the Care and Love of Divine Providence! in what <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Esteem</HI> wou'd they pass through the World? How <HI>Ʋse∣ful</HI> and what singular <HI>Blessings</HI> would they be in it? how <HI>pleasant,</HI> easie and chearful might they <HI>live, free from vanity and the Wounds of guilt!</HI> and in what <HI>peace</HI> might they at last hope to <HI>Die?</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Mercy and Grace</HI> I wou'd in particular wish from GOD unto the <HI>Surviving Sister,</HI> the only <HI>Immediate</HI> remaining <HI>Branch</HI> of this <HI>broken Family;</HI> Beseeching <HI>Almighty GOD</HI> (if it may be His Will) to Restore Her perfectly from Her present <HI>Languishments,</HI> to <HI>Adorn</HI> Her with His Grace, and grant Her <HI>Long to Live,</HI> and be a <HI>Mother in Israel.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Devout Contemplation On the Early DEATH Of Pious and Lovely Children.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>JER. IX. 21.</HI></BIBL>
<P>For Death is come up into our Windows, and is entred into our Palaces, to cut off the Children from with∣out, and the Young men from the Streets.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HOW often doth the <HI>Great GOD</HI> re∣peat His <HI>Calls</HI> to us to look into our <HI>Graves!</HI> and how seasonable is this <HI>Melancholly Subject</HI> ever to us thro' our whole Life! The <HI>affect∣ing Strokes</HI> of His Providence return <HI>surprizingly</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="001671_0009_0FB4E27CEFD9BD98"/>upon us, every now and then, as the <HI>Clouds after the Rain.</HI></P>
<P>We have had a <HI>dark</HI> and sorrowful <HI>long Winter</HI> by reason of the <HI>Ʋntimely Deaths</HI> (as we are rea∣dy to say) of many of our <HI>dear Children,</HI> and hopeful <HI>Young People.</HI> And now this <HI>last Week</HI> a very <HI>sudden awful Death</HI> has taken away <HI>One of the fairest Flowers in this Garden of GOD;</HI> One of the most <HI>Blooming and Lovely</HI> Children in the <HI>Town</HI> or <HI>Land,</HI> whether we speak of <HI>Body or Mind.</HI></P>
<P>I wou'd take <HI>this Occasion</HI> therefore, for the profit both of <HI>Elder</HI> and <HI>Younger</HI> Persons, to recol∣lect the <HI>Contemplations</HI> which I have sometimes had on the <HI>Meaning of Divine Providence,</HI> in such grie∣vous distressing Dispensations.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Context</HI> is one of the most <HI>mournful Chapters</HI> that you can find in all the <HI>Holy Scripture. Jere∣miah,</HI> the <HI>Weeping Prophet,</HI> does in the most <HI>pathe∣tical</HI> words that <HI>Art</HI> can chuse and lay together, excite Himself and others unto <HI>Holy Sorrow</HI> on the foresight of the Calamities coming upon <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> by the conquering and cruel <HI>Arms</HI> of the King of <HI>Babylon.</HI> He wishes that <HI>his own Head were Waters, and his Eyes a fountain of Tears, that he might weep day and night, for the slain of the Daughter of his People.</HI> He <HI>weeps</HI> for their <HI>Sins,</HI> which he therefore Enumerates; and then He weeps <HI>afresh</HI> over the prospect of GOD's <HI>Judgments,</HI> the sor∣rowful Fruit, and dreadful Punishment of their Sins: in which he must be a <HI>Stock</HI> rather than a
<PB N="3" REF="001671_0010_0FB4E27E3B39DD80"/><HI>Man,</HI> who is not affected with the <HI>Hand and An∣ger of</HI> Divine Providence.</P>
<P>This was the <HI>bitter Mourning</HI> in the <HI>Context:</HI> v. 15. <HI>Therefore thus saith the LORD of Hosts, the GOD of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with Wormwood, and give them water of Gall to drink.</HI> v. 17. <HI>Consider ye, and call for the mourn∣ing Women, that they may come,—and let them make haste, and take up a Wailing for us; that our Eyes may run down with tears, and our eye-lids gush out with waters: for a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion! How are we spoiled! —Hear—O ye Women,— and teach your Daughters wailing, and every one her Neighbour Lamentation: for Death is come up into our Windows, and is entred into our Palaces; to cut off the Children from without, and the Young men from the Streets.</HI></P>
<P>What can be more <HI>soft, passionate and moving,</HI> than the <HI>strain</HI> of the Context? and what <HI>wound up</HI> the strings of sorrow unto this <HI>High Note,</HI> but Death come into their Windows, to cut off the Children and Young people from the Streets! Well does the <HI>Prophet</HI> call for the <HI>tenderest hearts,</HI> and the <HI>shrillest voices,</HI> even of <HI>Women,</HI> to raise the Lamentation on this account.</P>
<P>All Divine <HI>Judgments</HI> call for our <HI>Sorrowing</HI> un∣der Gods Hand and Rod. While God <HI>distribu∣teth sorrows in his Anger,</HI> our Eyes should <HI>pour out tears</HI> unto God. We ought to <HI>weep</HI> with him that is in <HI>Trouble,</HI> and our <HI>Eyes should mourn</HI> by reason
<PB N="4" REF="001671_0011_0FB4E281DE413D40"/>of affliction. But in no <HI>Instance</HI> does <HI>Nature</HI> teach &amp; even force sorrow, more than in <HI>Bereave∣ments</HI> and the Death of Children: This was the voice in <HI>Rama, Rachel weeping for her Children, and would not be comforted,</HI> &amp;c. It was said of <HI>Ma∣ry, she goeth to the Grave to weep there;</HI> a Melan∣cholly place indeed to draw forth the Tears of Relations.</P>
<P>But I'm aware that many may be <HI>too apt</HI> of themselves to <HI>indulge Grief.</HI> I will forbear there∣fore to Enlarge any further on the <HI>Context.</HI> Death is come up into our <HI>Windows: scil.</HI> of the Chambers where the Sick lay. There's no lock∣ing our Doors against this <HI>Officer,</HI> when he comes to Arrest, or serve his Execution. Or rather, as a <HI>Thief</HI> in the Night <HI>Steals in</HI> at the Window, so does Death often steal as <HI>suddenly</HI> into our Hou∣ses, ere we are aware. Nor does it enter into the <HI>Cottages of the Poor</HI> only, but into the Houses of the Rich, the Dwellings of Rulers, and the <HI>Pala∣ces of Princes.</HI> But that which I shall only attend to is, that it spares not the <HI>tender pleasant Children,</HI> nor the hail and <HI>promising Youths;</HI> These, a most sad part of its Execution, it <HI>cuts off from the Streets▪</HI> The <HI>Streets,</HI> where the Young people were wont to <HI>Walk,</HI> and where the Children us'd to <HI>Play.</HI></P>
<P>All the <HI>Observation</HI> that I shall raise from the Words, is this:</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<PB N="5" REF="001671_0012_0FB4E2839A7400D0"/>
<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> That abundance of the Children of Men, and of our most hopeful, pious and promising Children do Die Young.</HEAD>
<P>A very <HI>plain,</HI> and <HI>poor, little Observation</HI> you'll be ready to say; what any <HI>Child</HI> may make, and I would pray <HI>them</HI> to do so. I'm sure, you don't think that I intend to labour in the <HI>proof</HI> of this obvious <HI>Truth,</HI> and Universal Experience of Mankind. There is great <HI>Inequality</HI> as to the length of peoples lives here in the Body, tho' at the <HI>longest</HI> the life of man is very <HI>short;</HI> as a Va∣pour that endureth but a short time. There are the <HI>untimely Births which never see the Light:</HI> and many that are <HI>Born alive,</HI> yet only number a <HI>few breaths, hours and days,</HI> and <HI>expire</HI> again, without fulfilling their <HI>Week</HI> or <HI>Month.</HI> What <HI>brittle</HI> and tender things are our <HI>Babes,</HI> and what multitudes die in <HI>Infancy! Delights, lent</HI> us for a year it may be, and then <HI>taken</HI> (we hope) to the Delights of God for ever. In <HI>Childhood</HI> the blooming flow∣er falls too, and <HI>Autumn</HI> comes almost before the <HI>Spring</HI>'s begun. If thro' a million Dangers, mortal to others, we get up to <HI>Youth,</HI> yet how sud∣denly and often does Death cut down the ver∣dant <HI>budding plant!</HI> And when from Youth we are got to <HI>Manhood,</HI> even then in the prime of our strength we are often snatch away from Fami∣lies,
<PB N="6" REF="001671_0013_0FB4E28516A98380"/>from Service, and from all Worldly Enjoy∣ments. Job 21.23. <HI>The number of his months are cut off in the midst; he dies in his full strength, his Breasts are full of Milk, and his Bones are moistned with Marrow.</HI></P>
<P>Thus is it with the Children of Men; and this <HI>happens alike to all,</HI> both to the <HI>Evil and the Good.</HI> Now my <HI>Design</HI> is with Modesty and Holy Reve∣rence to Enquire into the <HI>Reasons</HI> of Providence in this particular, which tho' it may sometimes appear very dark, and be very grievous to particu∣lar persons, <HI>yet certainly</HI> is in it self very <HI>Wise,</HI> and Holy and Gracious.</P>
<P>I am to <HI>Observe</HI> then, that abundance of our <HI>hopeful and lovely</HI> and promising Children, and those top that are <HI>really Pious and Godly</HI> in their Childhood, do Die Young. It always <HI>has been,</HI> and still <HI>is</HI> so. Righteous <HI>Abel,</HI> the <HI>first fruits</HI> of fallen Man to God, the first <HI>Martyr</HI> for Religion, and the <HI>first-born</HI> of the Grave, died young. <HI>E∣noch</HI> was no <HI>Old Saint</HI> in his Day, tho' ripe for Heaven, when God took him. He died not, it's true, but was the <HI>Earnest</HI> to the Old World of the <HI>Resurrection.</HI> The <HI>ten Children of Job,</HI> who we hope Inherited their pious Fathers <HI>Sanctity, and Prayers,</HI> died together in their Youth. Heavy the Tydings to their amazed <HI>Parents—The House fell upon the Young men, and they are dead, and I on∣ly am escaped alone to tell thee.</HI> Sometimes the <HI>Holiest,</HI> and whom God loves best, he takes <HI>soonest.</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="001671_0014_0FB4E2875DA90480"/>So it was we know in the peaceful Death of the young Prince <HI>Abijah.</HI> 1 King. 14.13. <HI>He only of Jeroboam shall come to the Grave, because in him there was found some good thing.</HI> To name no more, Our Blessed <HI>Saviour</HI> himself has <HI>sanctify'd an Early Death</HI> by dying in the <HI>prime</HI> of the Life of Man.</P>
<P>And now give me leave to do some Honour un∣to the <HI>Divine Providence,</HI> (as it shall enable me) in ordering these Early Deaths. It is a thing ve∣ry <HI>grievous</HI> to us, lamentable to see, and heavy to bear, and so it should be; yet we may not com∣plain of the <HI>Divine Government,</HI> no not in <HI>this;</HI> however grievous it be to <HI>Grace and Sense</HI> together. Let the <HI>Sovereign GOD</HI> call soon for them that fear him, and are but beginning to serve him, and so are likely to honour him, and be Blessings in the World; whose <HI>Hope and Crown</HI> they are; yet is he easily justified in his doing, and clear in his judging thus. Now that I may begin right on this <HI>Argument,</HI> which is one of the <HI>deep</HI> things of God; Let me say,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Soveraignty of God</HI> is enough, and instead of a thousand Reasons, to his Creatures in any of the Dispensations of his Providence, which may be dark to them. I'm afraid that the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God is not at all conceived of, nor adored by multitudes of Christians, as it ought to be. The <HI>Scripture</HI> every where speaks in the most <HI>exalted strains</HI> that can be about it. And when the <HI>Dis∣pensations</HI> of God are such as furprize and confound
<PB N="8" REF="001671_0015_0FB4E28A8CE6B430"/>our weak Reason and Understanding, then very often instead of going about to satisfy our scruples, and level them to our Capacity, it bids us <HI>worship,</HI> instead of <HI>arguing</HI> about the Unsearchable Councils of Heaven; and contemplating the Greatness of God to be <HI>dumb.</HI> So in Gods dealings with his Servant <HI>Job,</HI> when he and his Friends had been contemplating the possibility of such Inflictions on an Upright person; at last <HI>Elihu</HI> takes up the Argument, and reproves them all for presuming to talk so freely of the Great GOD; asking them if God were to give them Account of what He did or could do? or if they must be dissatisfy'd with the Almighty's Actions when ever they could not account for them? He vouchsafes them no other satisfaction but the Greatness &amp; <HI>Dominion</HI> of God; and when God himself spake afterward out of the <HI>Whirlwind,</HI> it was in the same lofty Style and Rea∣soning; proper to, and worthy of a God. <HI>Job</HI> 33.12, 13, 17.36.22, 23, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Very justly may the Great GOD <HI>disdain</HI> to let us reason with him against any Circumstances which He orders for us, either in respect of Life or Death. Shall not the <HI>Clay</HI> ly still under the <HI>Pot∣ters</HI> skilful Hand? <HI>Balaam</HI> was provok'd to stand corrected by his <HI>Ass;</HI> and yet the Ass taught the Prophet with Justice and Mildness: Yet <HI>Vain Man,</HI> that is born like the Wild Asses Colt, would be wise before God, even to reprove his Maker!</P>
<P>Let me further observe here Two Things.</P>
<LIST>
<PB N="9" REF="001671_0016_0FB4E28D52F7F500"/>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Life and Death are among those things that abso∣lutely belong to the Divine Sovereignty.</HI> Who but the God of the Spirits of all flesh shall say, when our Souls shall come into these dwellings of flesh, and when leave them? The Key of <HI>Hades</HI> is in his Hand, and it is one of the <HI>Insignia</HI> of his Supream Dominion. The Life he gave is his own, and shall he not do what he will with it?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>God is to be resigned to even with respect to the de∣grees of present Serviceableness, or Future Glory.</HI> We should desire indeed a <HI>Distinction</HI> in both <HI>Worlds,</HI> owning our selves unworthy mean while of a Name in either of them. But in the midst of <HI>Ʋsefulness</HI> here, and of the prospect of <HI>Advance∣ment</HI> in a better World, we must bear a spirit of absolute <HI>Submission</HI> if God call us to Die. To do <HI>much</HI> we should always desire, that we have done <HI>no more,</HI> should be our Humiliation; that we have done <HI>any thing</HI> is matter of Thanksgiving, and if it must be no more, we must (like our Famous and Eminent Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> when a dying) bless God for the least, which we never deserv'd, and so re∣sign our else desired Life. If we have any place in the <HI>Firmament</HI> of Glory, we must leave it to God to ordain our <HI>magnitude</HI> and <HI>brightness</HI> there; and as one <HI>Star differs from another Star in Glory; so is the Resurrection of the Dead.</HI> Now he that telleth the Number of the <HI>Stars,</HI> and calleth them all by Name, has done the same in Numbring the <HI>Elect,</HI> and making them <HI>Vessels of Honour.</HI></ITEM>

I proceed now to say,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Our lovely, gracious Elect Children cannot be too soon in Heaven.</HI> Happiness and Bliss in the fulness and perfection thereof can never come too soon. If God takes the Elect <HI>Infant</HI> from the <HI>Mothers Breast,</HI> or the <HI>Fathers Knees,</HI> to Himself an infi∣nitely better Father; pray, what loss is it? How blessed is it for the <HI>Babe</HI> that no more days or months were ordained for it in this scorching and freezing world of ours! in this world of Sin and Affliction! Will the Babe pine after the Mothers Breasts, when Angels have taken it in their brighter Arms to carry it to, and lay it in the Bosome of <HI>JESƲS;</HI> the Good Shepherd of Souls, who layes the <HI>Lambs</HI> in his Bosome? Surely 'tis best of all to go to an immediate Everlasting Rest, since God ordains it; never to have felt at all the Evils of guilt or trouble which the Godly are here so of∣ten groaning under! Well then, we are never too young to be happy: Happiness can never come too soon; that <HI>Surprize</HI> must at last be exceeding <HI>pleasant.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Sometimes it has been the desire and choice of Holy Children, with submission to the Sovereign Pleasure and Wisdom of God, not to have a long conti∣nuance here in this World.</HI> This is a rare thing in∣deed, yet we lately had an <HI>Instance</HI> of it in our Neighbourhood, in that Excellent <HI>Youth,</HI> the <HI>Son</HI> of Major <HI>Fitch,</HI> whose gracious Example, and la∣mented Death will not be soon forgotten. It was
<PB N="11" REF="001671_0018_0FB4E29048BF2E78"/>a pretty frequent <HI>passage</HI> with him, that he saw little in this World to make one desire to live long here. 'Twas a sign that his heart was soon and strangely set on Heavenly Things. This re∣quires some very comfortable degrees of hope and <HI>good assurance</HI> of our Interest in a better Life. There are but few even of the Children of God in ad∣vanced years, who upon settled and weighed prin∣ciples of Devotion, arrive unto an <HI>habitual willing∣ness</HI> to Die. Yet some strange <HI>Instances</HI> of it have been found under the Early Impressions of Divine Grace: The <HI>fear of Sin,</HI> the longing for <HI>freedom</HI> from it, and the desire to be <HI>with Christ,</HI> may some∣times excuse even the desire to be <HI>dissolved,</HI> pre∣serving <HI>Resignation</HI> to God: but the <HI>Glorifying</HI> God on Earth, the Serving our Generation according to the Will of God, and the Believing in the <HI>Alsuf∣ficiency</HI> of the Grace of God to <HI>keep</HI> us thro' the World, must make Life when prolonged, not only <HI>easie,</HI> but <HI>delightful</HI> to us, and an <HI>Esteemed Mercy</HI> of God to us. Certainly to <HI>abide</HI> in the flesh is very <HI>needful</HI> and <HI>desirable,</HI> while <HI>to live is Christ:</HI> but when we change this <HI>thought,</HI> and can say to our selves—<HI>to me to die is Gain,</HI> it may be difficult not to <HI>verge</HI> too much with the Holy <HI>Apostle</HI> in his desires rather of a dissolution; &amp; to <HI>groan being bur∣dened in this Tabernacle; knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord,</HI> Phil. 21.23. 2 Cor. 5. begin. Some Good People have <HI>wish'd</HI> for a <HI>Sudden Death;</HI> but most of the Chil∣dren
<PB N="12" REF="001671_0019_0FB4E291C10EFF00"/>of God with great Reason joyn rather in that part of our <HI>Littany,</HI> to be <HI>preserved from it.</HI> How∣ever, it very much takes away the <HI>darkness</HI> of the Dispensation, when it comes to be the matter of a devout persons desire and choice. But these are Extraordinary <HI>Cases,</HI> not to be bro't into <HI>Example,</HI> nor to be commended to our Imitation; &amp; there∣fore not to be insisted on.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Possibly God may have consulted the Spiritual ad∣vantage of a desirable and gracious Child in its Early Death.</HI> I mean both in respect of <HI>Grace</HI> here, and <HI>Glory</HI> hereafter. Had the Child lived, you know how certainly it had been <HI>exposed</HI> in this place of sin, temptation and danger: what from the <HI>Snake in the Grass,</HI> latent Indwelling Sin, and that <HI>Adder in the Path,</HI> the Devi and Satan; what from an Insnaring World, and the lusting flesh resisting the <HI>Spirit</HI> in all its heavenly desires. It is a Cir∣cumstance of great happiness to be once safely past all these <HI>hazards,</HI> &amp; out of the reach of these mor∣tal Enemies and <HI>fiery darts;</HI> never to be tempted, nor to sin more; but to be confirm'd in a State of Grace, and ascertain'd, possess'd of Everlasting Happiness. Now God only knows how little a longer time might have been improved; how lit∣tle might have been got by it, how much might have indeed been suffered by it. It is a sad truth, but a certain one, <HI>that many Good people have found little or no advantage to their Spirtual Life by length of time.</HI> They were Converted young, it may be,
<PB N="13" REF="001671_0020_0FB4E2933ACE69B0"/>and if they had died young, they had been in the same place in Heaven, if not in a better, then ha∣ving liv'd to more years. How often have people gone backward, quench'd the Spirit of Grace, and hurt their own Souls. Take the Instance of <HI>Solo∣mon;</HI> how gloriously did he begin, and outshone in Grace, as he did in Wisdom and Dignity: He was the <HI>Wonder</HI> of the Church, as his <HI>Temple</HI> was of the World: He went before the very <HI>Ministers</HI> of Re∣ligion, and the Lords Prophets in zeal and in devo∣tion: and now had he died young, his Grace had been without a <HI>stain</HI> upon it: but he liv'd to show the <HI>frailty</HI> of the Greatest <HI>Saint</HI> in a State of World∣ly <HI>Affluence,</HI> and the hazard there is from <HI>Sensual Objects</HI> in our greatest Attainments here below. I dare not presume to think whether his fall has put him a great way <HI>back</HI> in the List of the Glorify'd, his Repentance and Recovery being glorious in our Eyes; but certainly if his <HI>Graces</HI> had not been brighter above, had he died in his unspotted youth, and before his fall, yet had his <HI>Name</HI> among Saints on Earth been so.</P>
<P>We are <HI>Sailing</HI> in a very tempestuous and uncer∣tain <HI>Sea,</HI> like <HI>Mariners</HI> that sometimes set out with a fair and strong <HI>Gale,</HI> and make half their Passage in a few days; but then they meet with some rough contrary Winds that force 'em <HI>to Ly by</HI> at least, if they are not <HI>driven back,</HI> and have many a League to measure over again, if ever they <HI>make</HI> their Pas∣sage at all. If the <HI>Ship</HI> spring a <HI>leak,</HI> tho' it do
<PB N="14" REF="001671_0021_0FB4E2998A840C10"/>not founder, but after many hardships the <HI>Port</HI> is gained, yet the Loss and Damage sustained is usual∣ly very much. So are there many that Set out well in their Youth, and at last get to Heaven, but it is sorely <HI>shatter'd</HI> and <HI>broken,</HI> through their falls before one temptation and another in their way. The Floods do not <HI>drown</HI> them in perdition, but yet thro' their ill Conduct and foolish Management much of their rich Freight and Lading is <HI>damnify'd</HI> and thrown Overboard. They can show the <HI>Rich∣es</HI> they once had put aboard them, but alas, <HI>canker'd</HI> and marr'd now: they are not when they die, even what they were in their early years, but their <HI>Beauty</HI> marr'd by the advance of <HI>Age;</HI> which tho' it be natural to the <HI>Body,</HI> yet it is unnatural to the <HI>Immortal Soul.</HI> They die <HI>Penitents</HI> it's true, but not <HI>Proficients;</HI> and tho' they get to Heaven at last, yet no higher there than if they had died in their younger days.</P>
<P>Upon all, say, if it is not very possible that God may graciously have consulted the Spiritual Ad∣vantage of many an Elect Vessel of Mercy, in their Early Death. We have no <HI>foresight</HI> of things to come, but God has the most perfect that can be; and tho' there's no foresight of Grace in the Saints before it is given, but only in the purpose of God to give it, for in our corrupt nature it never could be at all but of his free Gift; yet in the best of Saints there's an easie foresight to us all of Corrup∣tion ready to break out upon all Occasions, with∣out
<PB N="15" REF="001671_0022_0FB4E29C4AA70D00"/>Gods restraint and prevention thereof: and to God it <HI>is open and naked</HI> how good people will act if they come to be in these and those Circumstan∣ces. Some God <HI>permits</HI> for wise Ends, and the Good of others, to live and shew the prevalency of Corruption in them, against suitable strivings and measures of his Grace; and others God <HI>pre∣vents</HI> from being like Instances and <HI>Sufferers,</HI> by a happy Early Death. And tho' he does not say, as to particular persons (and less may we) that this is his End; yet possibly it may be so in the very <HI>Instances</HI> we are mourning over. Indeed for ought we know, had they liv'd they wou'd have <HI>grown</HI> in Grace more and more; and it is meet for us to suppose and hope it wou'd have been so: but 'tis as true, that for ought we know it wou'd have been otherwise: and it is not at all <HI>amiss</HI> for us to satisfy our selves after this <HI>manner;</HI> when the matter is necessarily left so <HI>doubtful</HI> to us, and <HI>hazardous.</HI> But so much for this particular.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The Righteous are sometimes taken away from the Evil to come.</HI> As the Prophet observes, <HI>Isa.</HI> 57.1. And sometimes it's certain, that <HI>Hopeful and Pious Children</HI> are so, as <HI>Abijah</HI> was: 1 <HI>King.</HI> 14.13. And King <HI>Josiah</HI> too, to whom it was promised as a to∣ken of Divine Favour; 2 Kings 32.20. <HI>That be∣cause his heart was tender and humble before God, therefore he should be gathered</HI> early <HI>to his Fathers, &amp; his Eyes should not see the Evil that was coming on Judah and Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="001671_0023_0FB4E29DD67DA120"/>
<HI>Long Life</HI> here in this World is unavoidably at∣tended with <HI>many Sorrows,</HI> especially if a person be pious and devout. Mens <HI>own</HI> Sins, and the Sins of <HI>others,</HI> especially of <HI>Relatives;</HI> our <HI>Afflictions</HI> also by <HI>Bodily Pains</HI> and <HI>Sickness,</HI> and by <HI>Bereave∣ments</HI> in Estate and Relatives, multiply Grief upon us thro' our present <HI>Pilgrimage,</HI> and make the days of the years of it very Evil. They that die young are soon out of this <HI>dark and suffering Scene;</HI> if they had liv'd longer, there had been possibly many things which they little foresaw to have imbitter'd their lives to 'ern; yea, the very things (many of 'em) wherein they promis'd themselves the most comfort. How often have the Relatives that Survive come to bless their <HI>Depar∣ted Dead,</HI> saying,—<HI>Blessed are the closed Eyes that never saw these things.</HI> This is true, both as to <HI>Sins</HI> and <HI>Judgments,</HI> and those both <HI>publick</HI> and <HI>private.</HI> For <HI>Instance,</HI> it may seem to us every way to have been happier for <HI>Eli</HI> to have died young, than in his <HI>Age</HI> to have seen the Iniquity of his <HI>Sons,</HI> and their Death in their Sins, together with the Cap∣tivity of the <HI>Ark,</HI> which he died under the heavy Tydings of. How bitter is it to a Godly person, to live and see Children and Brethren grow up and prove <HI>Apostates</HI> from God, Children of <HI>Belial,</HI> and perishing under the Judicial Strokes of Divine Providence. <HI>It is better never to live to bear,</HI> than to bring forth these <HI>Sons of Sorrow.</HI> God sees (says the late Excellent Mr. <HI>N. Taylor</HI>) <Q>the rising <HI>Storms</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="001671_0024_0FB4E29F43361908"/>to come, and when they wou'd Overset the <HI>Ves∣sel,</HI> and therefore dispatches the Sailing <HI>Orders,</HI> and provides a safe <HI>Harbour:</HI> His <HI>Greens</HI> he early <HI>Houses</HI> also in a warm place, because they are so tender, that the sharpness of the coming Weather wou'd <HI>nip and kill them.</HI> The mean while there's <HI>Corn</HI> that can endure the cold of <HI>Winter,</HI> and the heat of the <HI>Summer;</HI> and it is fitting that it stand and grow full ripe, and be gather'd when it is <HI>turn'd white for the Harvest.</HI></Q> The hopeful Youth is sometimes taken away in favour <HI>from the Evil to come.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Many things respecting the <HI>Nature of Saving Grace</HI> are to be <HI>learn'd</HI> from, and are <HI>seen</HI> in the <HI>Early Deaths</HI> of pious and hopeful Young people. As,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>It shows us that Grace intends not to secure us a long Life here in the Body.</HI> No, it is the <HI>assimilation</HI> of the Soul unto another Life, and its <HI>preparation</HI> for it: it is to <HI>wean</HI> the Soul from the sensitive life, and to <HI>raise</HI> it above the same: it <HI>points</HI> the Soul unto the life of spirits in holiness and happi∣ness that is <HI>to come;</HI> and on no pretence therefore can it fix the heart down in any desires or pros∣pect of living long here. Indeed, <HI>Grace never short∣ned any ones life here,</HI> but has prolong'd rather ma∣ny a <HI>mans; length of days are in her right hand</HI> and <HI>long life shall she add unto thee:</HI> Prov. 3.16. There is nothing in a principle of Grace and Holy living, but what tends to the preservation and lengthening
<PB N="18" REF="001671_0025_0FB4E2A0C0ED6D40"/>out of mans life. It bears antipathy to, and de∣testation of all those <HI>Intemperances</HI> and vicious <HI>Ex∣cesses,</HI> which shorten mens days. It does by <HI>trust and prayer</HI> commit us to the care &amp; blessing of the God of our lives. It desires to live to his Glory; and it secures to us that so far as God sees it best for us, we shall live in his world. But no further can a principle of Grace look to a continuance of the present life. No, the first and chief <HI>Relation</HI> of Divine Grace, and <HI>Benefit</HI> from it is unto a life to come. Col. 3.3. <HI>For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in GOD.</HI> The <HI>Spiritual Life</HI> only is worthy to be called <HI>our Life;</HI> and <HI>this</HI> is hid with <HI>Christ;</HI> as the life of the <HI>Branches</HI> is hid in the <HI>Root:</HI> So are our Hopes for Eternity deposited and laid up with <HI>Christ</HI> in Heaven.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Again, The Death of pious Children teaches us this also of a <HI>Principle of Grace, that where it once is, the Soul is safe.</HI> Let Death come as <HI>soon</HI> as it will after a persons <HI>Coversion,</HI> when once a Sancti∣fying Change has passed on him, be he never so young, the Soul is safe. It is indeed <HI>very desirable</HI> to us on many accounts, that there be some good <HI>space</HI> granted to us for the <HI>Exercise</HI> of Grace, and the <HI>Actings</HI> of the Regenerate Life: that so <HI>the Great GOD</HI> may have some Honour and Service from us, the fruits of that Grace which He hath Implanted in us; and <HI>we</HI> some good Evidence and hope of His Grace in us, and of our Title to Eter∣nal Life; that so we may at last die in peace and
<PB N="19" REF="001671_0026_0FB4E2AB8664BFD0"/><HI>Comfort</HI> as well as <HI>Safety.</HI> But this is not <HI>absolutely necessary:</HI> and a person really dies in peace, in a State of Salvation, and goes to Heaven, if a Change be truly wro't in the Soul, tho' God do not spare him any length of time to bring forth the fruits of his Grace. And the Early Deaths of pious <HI>Ones</HI> may satisfie us, <HI>That Salvation depends not on length of time for the continued Exercise of Grace;</HI> tho' it be in its self a Favour of GOD greatly to be desi∣red, if it may be His Will.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Hence also does it evidently appear, <HI>that Sal∣vation is not of Works, but of Free Grace altogether.</HI> If it were of Works of Righteousness wro't by us, it were much to be apprehended that they who die young could never be saved. If <HI>Infants</HI> are saved, it must be of free Grace, forthese can have no <HI>Works</HI> of their own: no, not so much as one <HI>Act of Faith</HI> are they capable of: and yet <HI>of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> Multitudes of <HI>them</HI> are sancti∣fy'd and justify'd, and taken to Heaven. In some proportion it is thus with him that dies young: suppose within the <HI>Month</HI> or the <HI>Year</HI> wherein the Grace of God has taken hold of his Heart; when he is but just beginning to live to GOD, is but turning to Him in his own apprehension, and by his own confession has done nothing for Him; but was beiginning he hop'd in earnest to think of do∣ing something, &amp; <HI>Now</HI> must be gone: However, he dies in Christ and goes to Him: but then how rich and free is that Grace which saves him? <HI>Where
<PB N="20" REF="001671_0027_0FB4E2AEC9ECDCF0"/>is Boasting?</HI> Where is any life of working so much as to be imagined?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Wherefore to finish this <HI>Head, How amiable and adorable doth this render saving Grace to us!</HI> that however young we die, 'tis possible to be saved by it; that how soon soever it takes possession of us, it puts us into a secure and happy Sate. O how lovely and desirable a thing then is it! how very valuable and precious!</P>
<P>See you <HI>One</HI> that has but just begun to seek and serve GOD, and GOD has so suddenly, instantly, presently rewarded and glorified him! when CHRIST his <HI>Judge</HI> shall name this <HI>Child</HI> with ho∣nour in the <HI>Last Day,</HI> what can it answer?— LORD, when did I ever serve Thee? What did I ever do for Thee? From the day that thy Grace found me, I had not a year, not a month, not a week (it may be) allowed me to live to honour Thee! No, Gracious LORD! in the day almost wherein thou didst please to <HI>Sanctifie</HI> me thou didst also <HI>Glorifie</HI> me. E'er I cou'd find thy <HI>Grace</HI> in my <HI>Soul,</HI> I found my self <HI>taken</HI> to thy <HI>Glory;</HI> and as I was but beginning to <HI>seek</HI> thy Mercy, I found my self Embraced in the <HI>Arms</HI> of it.</P>
<P>O what should render GOD &amp; His Grace more amiable to us, than his glorifying it after this man∣ner to the young Penitent, the <HI>Infant Saint!</HI> No sooner born from <HI>Above,</HI> than taken <HI>Thither.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. And <HI>lastly,</HI> The Death of those that are pious and gracious in their Youth <HI>is of excellent Ʋse, and
<PB N="21" REF="001671_0028_0FB4E2AFC8837180"/>great Necessity, to quicken and excite their Acquain∣tance, Friends and Relations to an instar and careful Preparation for their own Dying Hour.</HI> Many are the <HI>Instructions and Admonitions</HI> in it, both to <HI>Elder</HI> and <HI>Younger</HI> People. It may be of great Service to <HI>Survivors.</HI> And this is a <HI>Reason</HI> worthy of a <HI>Good GOD,</HI> whose care is for the Souls of <HI>many</HI> in his Providential Dealings with <HI>One.</HI></P>
<P>Let me then <HI>Observe,</HI> and so make the proper <HI>Application</HI> of the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> in this <HI>Illustration</HI> of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. That to be sure in the Early Death of pious Children, there are many Useful <HI>Admonitions in∣tended to those that are Young.</HI> Younger <HI>Friends and Relatives</HI> should take the <HI>Warnings</HI> of GOD, which are <HI>firstly and directly</HI> meant to them.</P>
<P><HI>You</HI> must be admonish'd, <HI>O Young Person,</HI> that you your self <HI>may die soon and suddenly</HI> likewise. You should never see one of your <HI>Own Age</HI> buried, or one younger than your self die, but you should seriously think—'It might have been <HI>my turn</HI> as well, or mine may be the <HI>next,</HI> and within a <HI>few</HI> days (if not to <HI>day</HI> or to <HI>morrow</HI>) I may follow. What am I better than my <HI>Companion?</HI> or it may be my life is not of half the worth that <HI>his</HI> or <HI>hers</HI> was! nor has been half so well improved or re∣deemed! or if it has, yet this makes no diffe∣rence; since the <HI>best</HI> die young.</P>
<P>See one proof of that <HI>Truth,</HI> Psal. 39.5. <HI>Veri∣lye very man at his best Estate is altogether Vanity.</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="001671_0029_0FB4E2B2370B04C8"/>A Flourishing Youth and Piety met together seem one of the best Estates of Man: the strength of our years united with the strength of Grace. 1 Joh. 2.14. <HI>I write unto you young men, because ye are strong,</HI> &amp;c. Yet in this <HI>Vigour</HI> of Nature and Grace both, may we suddenly expire and vanish away.</P>
<P>Wherefore <HI>Early Religion is the highest Wisdom, and Interest of all the Children of men;</HI> the most <HI>Im∣portant</HI> and necessary thing that can be. You can never begin too soon to think of your Souls, since you may every day look to die. This alone ought to awaken you to <HI>remember your Creator</HI> in the days of your Youth, and as you enter upon this life, to chuse that <HI>Good part</HI> which can never be taken a∣way from you; and to <HI>Seek first</HI> the Kingdom of GOD, and his Righteousness. The <HI>Funeral</HI> of e∣every <HI>Infant</HI> or <HI>Child,</HI> calls all the Children in the <HI>Streets</HI> to be thinking of, and preparing for their own Death: for if you are not too young to <HI>Die,</HI> neither are you to be <HI>Religious,</HI> and to make your Souls your care.</P>
<P>It <HI>warns</HI> you now in your Youth, that you <HI>need better Friends &amp; Dependance</HI> than any in this World, and a better <HI>Portion</HI> than this World can slatter you withal. For be you in the arms of your <HI>Pa∣rents,</HI> or bereav'd of them can you number up a great many <HI>Friends</HI> that heartily respect you, and care for your Interests? Are the <HI>Comforts</HI> of this Life surrounding you and your Worldly <HI>Estate</HI> in∣creasing upon you? Yet a day or an hour may
<PB N="23" REF="001671_0030_0FB4E2B3A2197A18"/>snatch you away from all; while your helpless Friends stand in Amazement and Sorrow about you, to see you expire. <HI>That Child alone is safe &amp; happy, who has the Great GOD for its Father, and Guardian and Portion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Children!</HI> Let me put it to you, whether you have ever yet began to think of your <HI>Souls,</HI> your <HI>Sins,</HI> your <HI>Saviour,</HI> your <HI>Baptism,</HI> your <HI>Dying Hour,</HI> and of <HI>Eternity.</HI> Do you <HI>pray,</HI> do you fear to sin, do you take any care to be Saved? O what Rea∣son there is to fear that few of you little consider any thing of this nature! which of you almost has any tho't about Death now in your Childhood? You scarce seem to apprehend it <HI>possible,</HI> and much less do you realize it as very <HI>likely,</HI> that you may die young. Will you never begin to <HI>think,</HI> Young People? not one <HI>sober tho't</HI> of your Eternal State, tho' you see so many of your own Stature in the Grave. GOD <HI>teach</HI> thee betimes so to <HI>num∣ber thy days, as to apply thy heart unto Wisdom.</HI></P>
<P>GOD can make the Death of your <HI>Companions</HI> a most awakening and effectual <HI>Sermon</HI> to you: and it may be worth anothers dying to do thy Soul good, and bring thee home to <HI>Christ:</HI> It <HI>preaches</HI> to thee in a more <HI>affecting manner</HI> than any meer words can, and in the <HI>happy season to Rela∣tives,</HI> when their affections are stirred, and their Souls the more easily come at. And O that our Young people wou'd but hear the good Counsels from the <HI>Funerals</HI> of their pious Friends that die
<PB N="24" REF="001671_0031_0FB4E2B8C0E5EF48"/>young! how well worth were it their dying, be∣times to fasten such Instructions for the Salvation of others.</P>
<P N="2">2. The death of hopeful Children and Young people may be of great Spiritual Advantage also to <HI>Elder persons. Parents</HI> should be quickned in Holy Living, by the death of their Children; and the <HI>Grey Head</HI> should receive Instruction &amp; Awa∣kening by the fall of the blooming Youth. There are many things said to them that are in Advanced <HI>Age,</HI> in the Death of their <HI>Juniors.</HI></P>
<P>Are these fallen so <HI>soon,</HI> how <HI>long ago</HI> then might I have been in my Grave? may the <HI>Elder Christian</HI> say. Adore the Sovereign Grace of GOD, that has so long spared you. Had you been cut down thus soon, think what had become of you, &amp; where had you been long since? Consider why God spares you. <HI>Shame</HI> your self for your Defects, and <HI>fear:</HI> If the <HI>green tree</HI> be fell'd, laden with Blossoms, or first ripe fruits; what then shall be done to the <HI>dry?</HI> Shall <HI>that</HI> stand always <HI>barren</HI> and unprofita∣ble, to <HI>cumber the Ground?</HI> What? see we a Child <HI>Older</HI> in Grace, and wiser and better than we in Years? our selves not so <HI>ripe</HI> for Heaven, as those that were <HI>Ʋnborn</HI> when we were Men &amp; Women! So the <HI>Army of Israel</HI> blush'd when they saw the <HI>ruddy Boy</HI> excel them all in Faith and Valour.</P>
<P>Are so many <HI>Young Ones</HI> in Heaven, and are we <HI>Old</HI> and never like to get thither? How can we bear the tho't? or how shall we when Death comes?</P>

<P>Are so many Young Ones in Heaven, and You O <HI>Aged Believer so little Ready</HI> in your own Ac∣count? Your Evidences so little clear? Your In∣terest in Christ so doubtful? Your Days spun and worn out to so little purpose? How should it quicken you to give all diligence in making your Election sure?</P>
<P>Do so many Younger die in <HI>Christ,</HI> and have not we had all their Opportunities, and more by far than all those which they have so well and timely Improved? How will they rise up in Judg∣ment against us, and condemn us! O fatal <HI>diffe∣rence</HI> between man and man! <HI>Some</HI> dying young in <HI>Christ, others</HI> living old <HI>Christless.</HI></P>
<P>Take the <HI>Alarm, O Dying Aged Sinner!</HI> if one come to thee from the <HI>Dead</HI> thou wilt repent! &amp; that too as we paint the bright <HI>Angels</HI> of GOD with a <HI>Youthful Mein and Air!</HI> let him tell thee with a charming voice of the <HI>Glories</HI> he has <HI>so soon</HI> pass'd into, and invite thee tho' <HI>so late</HI> to seek a part in those unspeakable and Eternal Felicities! What? will not this <HI>Glorious Vision</HI> it self Convert thee! No, tho' one come like <HI>Lazarus</HI> from the Bosome of <HI>Abraham</HI> unto you</P>
<P>You that are <HI>Parents,</HI> be you quickned to <HI>think seriously of dying your selves.</HI> The fruit of your Bodies are already (some of them) in the Grave; how soon may you look to be there too? Death that has already torn out some of your <HI>Bowels,</HI> will soon pierce your <HI>Heart.</HI> Parents are so se∣cure
<PB N="26" REF="001671_0033_0FB4E2BE0BD3E888"/>and forgetful of their own Mortality, that Death must needs lay its cold hand on their Bo∣some, and take their Babes thence, to awaken 'em: And surely they will sensibly feel themselves Mortal, while they see a part of themselves In∣terr'd already. So <HI>David</HI> graciously improv'd the death of <HI>his Child,—I shall go to it.</HI> Say thus, O <HI>Parent,</HI> to thy self: I shall soon follow; and be it thy care (O my Soul) so to improve thy present Sorrows, and the Residue of thy few Evil Dayes in the flesh, that I may meet <HI>mine</HI> whom I have committed to <HI>Christ,</HI> with Joy in His Presence at the last.</P>
<P><HI>Three words</HI> of Advice let me leave with <HI>Pa∣rents,</HI> respecting their <HI>Children.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. To begin betimes to Institute them for GOD. We must give them up to GOD in <HI>Bap∣tism;</HI> and as soon as they are able to learn teach them to know God, and fear Him, and serve Him. Betimes tell 'em of their Precious Souls, and of their Glorious Saviour, and of their Dying Con∣dition. Put them betimes on preparing for Death: they will die never the sooner for it, but may much the better, and you'll have the more peace and comfort in their death, if they are <HI>sud∣denly</HI> taken from you. Your Children are daily liable to the stroke of Death, where then (O Parent) is your Care or Love or Kindness to them, if you do not what you can to prepare 'em for it! And how reverently ought Children to
<PB N="27" REF="001671_0034_0FB4E2BF7B5CF1F8"/>mind what their Parents say to 'em about their Future and Everlasting Interests.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let Parents prepare betimes to part</HI> with their lovely Children, and get their <HI>Soul even as a weaned. Child;</HI> even before they wean their <HI>Babes</HI> from their Breast. We must look for <HI>Abrahams</HI> trial and E∣mulate his <HI>Faith,</HI> Gen. 22.2. <HI>Take now thy Son, thine only Son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and offer him up to Me.</HI> Our <HI>best</HI> are GOD's Due; What He made for Himself, and <HI>lends</HI> for a while to us. GOD comes into His <HI>Garden,</HI> and plucks which <HI>flower</HI> He pleases, and which but the most <HI>beautiful</HI> &amp; <HI>fragrant</HI> do men gather? Let the Great GOD take <HI>his own,</HI> &amp; let us make <HI>Abels</HI> acceptable Offering, <HI>the best of our Flock.</HI> The <HI>Shunamite,</HI> that <HI>Great Woman,</HI> had one <HI>wondrous</HI> Son, a special <HI>Gift</HI> of Heaven to her in Reward of her <HI>Piety;</HI> but soon had She the sorrow to see him die, and that very <HI>suddenly,</HI> in her <HI>lap:</HI> She made no <HI>Shriek</HI> in that terrible <HI>Sur∣prize,</HI> nor so much as shew'd her Distress to Her Houshold; no, not to her <HI>Husband,</HI> the partner of her Joyes and Griefs: She went to GOD, <HI>i. e.</HI> un∣to his <HI>Prophets</HI> feet, where her humble silent <HI>Acti∣on</HI> spake those Auguishes which no Words could utter: the mean while her Resignation to the Will of GOD, &amp; her Contentment therein, was most ad∣mirable: the <HI>Child was dead,</HI> yet said she,—<HI>All is well.</HI> Give me leave thus to <HI>Pharaphrase</HI> it.</P>
<Q><L>What GOD Ordains is <HI>Well</HI> and <HI>Best.</HI></L>
<L>It's <HI>Well</HI> with <HI>Ours</HI> when gone to Rest.</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="001671_0035_0FB4E2C34BCC2440"/>
It's <HI>Well</HI> with <HI>Ʋs</HI> who stay behind,</L>
<L>If more from Earth and Flesh resin'd,</L>
<L>We're patient, pray'rful, meek, resign'd.</L></Q>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let us be Comforted and quieted in the Death of hopeful Children.</HI> A Child <HI>in Heaven</HI> is well <HI>provi∣ded</HI> for, well <HI>dispos'd</HI> of, well <HI>preferr'd.</HI> It has a good <HI>Portion,</HI> is gone to a good <HI>Father,</HI> to a good <HI>Family,</HI> to good <HI>Company;</HI> to an Everlasting Rest, and to Infinite Blessedness. The Covenant of God embraces our Children with more tenderness, than our Arms ever did. Blessed are the Dead in Christ, that are soon pass'd from Sin and Sorrow here, to the Eternal Fulness of Holiness and Comfort in the Presence of GOD for ever.</P>
<P>We must not repeat <HI>Jacobs</HI> Error, who supposed himself <HI>bereaved,</HI> when <HI>Joseph</HI> was only <HI>Advancing</HI> under the special Favour of Providence in <HI>Another Countrey.</HI> He would needs be an <HI>Inconsolable</HI> Mourn¦er, <HI>and go down into the Grave after his Son mourning,</HI> But in time he heard <HI>of all his Glory in Egypt,</HI> (which what was it to the Glory of the least of our <HI>Little Ones</HI> that behold the Face of God in Heaven) and then the good <HI>Patriarchs Spirit revived,</HI> and he said,—<HI>Joseph my Son is yet alive, I'll go and see him before I die.</HI> Truly, so, <HI>O Christian,</HI> the Child thou mournest over may be now in Heaven and Glorify'd; It is thy Hope and Faith it is so: let thy <HI>sinking</HI> Spi∣rit then <HI>revive</HI> and say,—By the <HI>Grace</HI> of God, I will endeavour so to <HI>live,</HI> that I may <HI>See</HI> it in Glory when I <HI>Die.</HI></P>
