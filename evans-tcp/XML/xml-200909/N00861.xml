<HEAD>TO THE READER</HEAD>
<P>THe great Noise the Imprisonment, Prosecution and Con∣demnation of Coll. <HI>Bayard</HI> has made in there parts, and the unusual care taken by the Actors to stifle the Truth, is the oc∣casion of these ensuing Sheets. The Copies of the Publick Papers, and the Report of the Matters of Fact <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> exact; &amp; the Recital of what has been said by the several P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ions concerned, comes as near the words, &amp; comprehends the substance of what posted as well as many of the Auditors could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> away in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Memory, compared and assisted with such Notes as privately (unknown to the Court) were taken. The greatest Omission is in the long elaborate Discourses of Mr <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ver,</HI> Solicitor General, previous to the Tryal, and of Mr <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> in his Charges to the Grand &amp; Petty Juryes. The Publisher hereof his not that Interest with these Gentlemen to procure Copies of them; but the particulars of those Discourses mentioned in this Treati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e can be proved by many Witnesse, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all much short of the V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rulency of their Expressions: These Gentlemen, if they please, may sup∣ply those Defects.</P>
<P>The Common Interest the Subjects in the Plantations have to Petition the Government in <HI>England</HI> in all their Emergencies, is of that Consequence, and the sinister means taken to obstruct it. so in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, that were there no other, those may serve for a sufficient Apology for making this Publick.</P>
<P>STrangers who read this Tryal (without doubt) will be desirous to see the Addresses, about which there has been such great Disturbance and Persecution; wherefore that to the Lord <HI>Cornbury</HI> (being one of the Three, and having been delivered to his Lordship on board the Ship at <HI>Sandy Poi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>) is permitted to be here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rinted.

On the other hand, <HI>John Corbitt, Caleb Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>per, John Cortland</HI> and <HI>Jacoh d' Key</HI> insisted that the Kings Council ought not to be pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent with them at their private Debates, and that they had a Right to send for what Persons, and ask what Questions for their Information, as they should think needful. Whereupon Mr. <HI>Weaver</HI> did threaten them, and (to use his own Expression) would cause them to be Trounced, taking down their Names. And the Grand Jury broke up without acting.</P>
<P>The Court in the after-noon met according to Adjournment, and the Grand Jury being sent for, Mr. <HI>Weaver</HI> made complaint, That he was obstructed by some of the Grand Jury, who would not acquiese to his being present at the Examination of the Kings Evidence, and would have other Evidences sent for, than what were by him produced. And thereupon
<PB N="7" REF="001038_0011_0FAEF1A1C79E5CF8"/>Mr. <HI>Atwood</HI> did discharge the above said our Persons from their further Service; and caused <HI>Jacob <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>elen,</HI> who was absent when the others were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to be sent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or from his House, Sworn and added to the Grand Jury; and the Court adjourned till seven a Clock that Evening, but did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> till about Midnight, when lending to know if the Jury had found the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and being informed, that they were seperated, he adjourn'd the Court till next Morning at eight of the Clock, and in the way from the Court, in Passion said <HI>[If the Grand Jury will not find the Bill against Coll.</HI> Bayard, <HI>I will bring an information against him of High Treason, and Try him upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>]</HI></P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 21.

<P>Whereupon the Council for the Prisoner informed the Court that the Bill was not found by Twelve Jurors And upon Examination it appeared to the Commissioners that of such of the Jurors who remained in Court, Eight of the Nineteen were against finding the Bill, as appears by the Minutes of the Court, entered by order, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

To which Mr. <HI>Atwood</HI> made answer. They were no longer Jurors, they had presented the Bill, and the Court was posse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of it, it was now a Record, and there is no averment against a Record.</P>
<P>Ordered, The Prisoner come to Tryal on <HI>Monday</HI> next come seven Night, to which day the Court adjourned accordingly.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday,</HI> the 2d of <HI>March,</HI> the Commissioners met according to adjournment.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nicoll,</HI> (Council assigned for Coll. <HI>Bayard</HI>) moved that the Indictment might be quashed, not being found by Twelve Men: and to prove the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter of Law, offered to produce Authorities; and to prove the matter of Fact, offered to produce Evidences in Court, if either were insisted on, the Grand Jury being then by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Court.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Sollicitor General,</HI> What is moved in behalf of the Prisoner is most improper, for asmuch as the Indictment is found, and signed by the Fore∣man <HI>Billa Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a;</HI> there can be no Averment allowed against a Record brought in by the Body of a Grand Jury, and therefore I desire the Prisoner may be sent for and arraigned.</P>
<P><HI>Nicoll,</HI> This is a matter of great Weight and Moment, and concerns not only the Life and fortune of the Prisoner and his Posterity, but the Right of every <HI>English Man</HI> in the Province: It is not only lawful, but highly reasonable that an Indictment for High Treason should be found by

<P>May it please your Honour, I am joyned with Mr. <HI>Nicoll</HI> as Counsel for the Prisoner: The Question that now seems to lye before your Honour is, whether there can be any Averment offered against a Record; there is an Act of Parliament of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>H</HI> 4. wherein it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>acted, That a grand Jury shall consist <HI>De <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp; legal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and so likewise runs the tenor of the Writ of <HI>Ven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>;</HI> for want of such Persons the same Statute does declare the Indictment void; so that it is a good Exception to an Indictment to aver, That any one of the Grand Jury was an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which is matter of fact how, shall this Averment be made, it so be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be no Averment against a Record? and what benefit has the Prisoner of this Act, unless an Averment be allowed against the Record of this Indict∣ment, if it should so happen that some of the Grand Jury are not so qua∣lified as the Act requires, which seem to me sufficient proof that an Aver∣ment in the case at the Bar, is good against a Record.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Atwood</SPEAKER>
<P>The Statute gives the Part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that may be averred, and no other can be allowed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Its very hard upon the Subject, the Court appoints the Fore-man of the Grand Jury, and he may chance to be a Person prejudiced against the Prisoner, who may sign and return the Bill <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra,</HI> without the consent of his Fellows, or a sufficient Number, and because its Matter of Record, shall no Argument be allowed against the Bill?</P>

<SPEAKER>Atwood.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Grand Jury, in a certain Case, on an Indictment for words spoken, found <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lla Vera,</HI> but as to the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tiose, Ignoramu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> which made the Bill void; so in this Case, if the Jury, as to the Fact in the Indictment, had found <HI>Billa Vera,</HI> and as to Treason, <HI>Ignoramu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> the Bill had been void, and the Court must have taken Notice of it; but to this Bill there is no Endorsement but <HI>Billa Vera,</HI> the Court has received and published the Verdict, and therefore will proceed.</P>

<P>The Bill is sound, and appears to the Court matter of Record, so that you need not insist any further upon that Head, a Grand Jury is an Inquest of Office, and an Inquest of Office may be found by a less

<P>There is something in that which you offer of the Precept being under the Hands and Seals of the Commissioners, in the Return of the Pety Jury, but this does not at all affect the Grand Jury; for which reason, if you see cause to move it, time may be granted to mend that Mistake.

<P>THat your Petitioners Council have informed him, That on yester∣day they prayed, in the Petitioners behalf, the favour of this Court to prove before your Honours, by the Oathes of the major part of the Grand Jury, there also subpoena'd in Court, That the Indictment brought in for High Treason against your Petitioner by Capt. <HI>Johannes D' Peyster</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being Pure man of the said Grand Jury) was not found nor agreed to by any Twelve of that Jury, No, not by Two or Three of the Nineteen of them, though the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m (as is evidently known) are your Petitioners mortal Enemies, for no other cause but on account of the unhappy Divisions within this Province.

<P><HI>Samuell Clows Sworn,</HI> saith,</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> When I come to speak of the Addresses, I must pray you to take Notice, that I can speak positively to but very few things that is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, what I say is to the best of my Remembrance and Understanding, for I may be mistaken in both. 'T was about a fortnight or three Weeks before Coll. <HI>Bayards</HI> Commitment that I happened to come to his House about some business not at all relating to this matter, concerning which as we were talking, Coll <HI>Bayard</HI> ask'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me if I had seen the Addresses? I answered, No. He then shewed me three Addresses the first was to my Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> the Persons addressing in it, called themselves Inhabitants of <HI>New York,</HI> and others distant from it, and being some of them could not perhaps be present at his Lordships arrival here, did by way of Address Congratulate his Lordship into this Government, wishing him all Health and Prosperity here, and that the Name of <HI>Party</HI> might be banish't from among us. After I had read it, Coll. <HI>Bayard</HI> ask't me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> any thing to say against it? I answered, No, and then signed it. The other two Ad∣dresses were one to the King, and the other to the House of Commons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the Parliament, (I am not positive which) as I had read them. I remem∣ber I made this Observation in my self, that they contained nearly both the same things, and in them, or one of them, to the best of my remembrance, were contained these things. The Persons addressing called themselves <HI>English Men,</HI> and others who tho' Forreigners, yet enti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uled to the Pri∣viledges of <HI>English Men</HI> here: It speaks concerning the late Revolution here, of which I have but a confused Idea, and can remember nothing particular; afterwards it speaks concerning my Lord <HI>Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mont</HI>'s Admini∣stration, in several Articles of which I can remember but one, which is, That the <HI>Hottest</HI> and <HI>Ignorantest</HI> of the People were put into places of Trust. Then it speaks concerning the late Assembly here and tells you, that after this Assembly had chose their Speaker, some of the Representatives were informed that he was an <HI>Alien,</HI> upon which they made a Motion to the House, that that matter might be enquired into, but that Motion being refused, one halt of the Representatives, or Ten of them left the House, notwithstanding which the remaining part of the Representatives, with some others they took in, did proceed to make Acts, in one of which Acts they gave a Sum of Money to the Lieut. Governour to tempt him to pass these Acts, and likewise a Sum to the chief Justice of this Province to find Law and Form for their Proceedings; and that these things tended to the rendering the Government Vile and Cheap in the eyes of the People.</P>

<P>I think you said so before the Council.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clows.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps I might say something like to when I was before the Council, though I don'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> believe there is any essential difference between what I now say, and what I said to the Council; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et if there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

<P>Was not the assembly called an Illegal Assembly? and that they had made Acts prejudicial to the Country.</P>

<P>Perhaps I might before the Council useth, word <HI>Scum,</HI> but I now think it was, That the <HI>Hottest &amp; Ignorance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> were put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of Trust.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Clows,</HI> pray tell us what was the reason you did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign the other two Addresses?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clows.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I am not at this time obliged to tel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that, being it does not at all affect the matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Atwood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but it does, you must tell us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clows.</SPEAKER>
<P>On of the chief Reasons was because I then thought that the saying the Assembly had given a Gift to the Lieut. Governour to tempt him to pass their Acts. was a Reflection upon the Lieu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Governour, but it is my judgment now that it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Reflection at all upon him.</P>

I believe I might then answer something about it but I do not know any such thing in the Addresses, either of the Souldiers or their pay.

<P>Coming home from the Fort, and passing by M. <HI>Hutchins</HI>'s House, I was asked to walk in by Mr. <HI>Hutchins,</HI> which I did, and being some into the upper Room, I saw some Papers there, which were called Addresses, but I did not read any of them but that to my Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> which as I understood was a Complement and Congratulation to him a his arrival here. Mr. <HI>Hutchins</HI> has asked me to sign it, but I refused it, because being a Lieut. in the Garrison, I was unwilling to do any such thing before any of my elder Officers had done it. But I did not see Coll. <HI>Bayard</HI> nor his Name there.</P>

<P>I have novv proved by the Witnesses these false &amp; scandalous Libells set forth to the Indictment, vvhereby the good, peace and quiet of the Government has been disturbed, vvhich by this Act of Assembly is High-Treason.

<P>Your Honour and the Jury vvill please to take Notice, that the Indictment consists of divers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eads as, That the prisoner did compass, imagine, contrive, purpose and design to Defame, subvert, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Peace, Good and Quiet of this his Majesties Government.</P>
<P>That he u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d divers indirect Practices &amp; Endeavours to procure Mutiny and Sedition amongst the souldiers.</P>
<P>That he drevv in numbers of them the said Souldiers, and others, to sign false and scandalous Libells, and that he had sign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d them himself.</P>
<P>That in these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eclared. That the Subjects in this Province are and have been, for many Years last past, by those entrusted in the ad∣ministration of the Government, Opprest, and that the Government hath been and is rendered Cheap and Vile in the eyes of the People; as also, That the General Assembly of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rovince is not a Lavvful Assembly by which means, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he hath incited his Majesties Subjects to cast off their Obedience to his Majesties said Government</P>
<P>The Prisoner is not directly charged here with any Fact except his own signing the said Libels, but for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Endeavours; the rest are for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d Conclusions and strain'd In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erences drawn from thence. It is not alledg'd that the Peace of the Government Hath been disturbed, or that any Mutiny or Sedition hath been amongst the Souldiers, or that any one of his Majesties Subjects hath cast off his Obedience to his Majest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s said Government. By the Court of the Evidence it appears there was an Ad∣dress to the King, an Address to the House of Commons and an Address to my Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> and a Petition or Address to the Lieut. Governour and Council, but all the Evidence is very Lame and weak as to the three first: I we should admit the making or signing of them to be any fault or crime, more especially if the same should amount to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reason; for by none of the Evidence it does appear that those Addresses signed at the Coffee-House were the same Addresses which were at Coll. <HI>Bayards,</HI> or that the Addresses
<PB N="24" REF="001038_0028_0FAEF1B386AF7CA0"/>an Alder-man <HI>Hutchins</HI>'s were the same which were at the Coffee-House, or the same which were at Coll. <HI>Bayards:</HI> There is no Proof that the Prisoner signed those Addresses; here is not so much as the likeness, or comparison of Hands produced, alledged or proved, tho' if it were, that would not do; in the great Tryal of the Bishops, Mr. <HI>Pollexphen</HI> there Affirms, pag. 60. <HI>That Comparison of Hands is not good in a Criminal Case,</HI> and offers the Lady <HI>Cars</HI> case in &amp; <HI>dersi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Reports, <HI>pag.</HI> 418, 419. where it is so adjudged.</P>
<P>But I shall not dwell upon the Evidence; it is certainly the Right of the Subject to Petition the King whenever he conceives himself agrieved: In the Bishops Tryals, <HI>pag.</HI> 160. Mr <HI>Pollexphen</HI> says, <HI>I never thought it,</HI> nor hath since been thought by any body else to be a Crime to Petition the King. Pag. 121.

<P>I cannot think it a Crime for the Subjects of the Plantations to Petition the House of Commons, it is every days Practice; consult the Votes in ever Sessons, you'll find many Addresses, Petitions and Complaints from the Subjects of the Plantations: I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seems to be the Right of the Subjects to Petition the House of Commons, the Statute of the 13th or <HI>Charles the 2d chap. 5.</HI> restrains the common Law, by that in plainly appears to be the Right of the Subject to Petition the House of Commons or the King. The Provis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in that Act says. <HI>That neither that Act nor any thing therein contained shall be con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trued to extend or hinder any Person or Persons, not exceeding the Number of Ten, to present any publick or private Grievance or Complaint to any Member of the House of Commons, after his Election, or to the Kings Majesty.</HI> The Act of Rcognition of <HI>Prime W. and Mary,</HI> declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subjects, and settling the Succession of the Crown, thereby it is enacted, amongst other things, <HI>That it is the Right of the Subject to Petition the King, and all Commitments and Pro∣secutions for such Petitioning are Illegal.</HI> And they do claim command and insist upon all and singular the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses as their undoubled Rights and Li∣berties; and that no Declaration, Judgment Doings or Proceedings to the prejudice of the People, in any the said Premises, ought in any wise here∣after to be drawn into Consequence or Example. More is no grant of any new Priviledge, but a claim and acknowledgement of an antient Right: and Petitions to the Parliament are as ancient as Parliaments themselves; If the Subjects of the Plantations may not Petition and Compalin to their Prince, they are in a worse Condition than Slaves. The Cryes of the Oppressions in the Plantations have gone up to Heaven, and are again come
<PB N="25" REF="001038_0029_0FAEF1B612276A48"/>down upon the Earth, and have inspired and moved the King &amp; parliament of <HI>England</HI> to make a Law to check the exorbitant Actions of Governours in the Plantations, and make them accountable in <HI>England</HI> for their Mis∣carriages abroad; which can never be discovered to the King but by Petition.

<HEAD>An Act to punish Governours of Plantations in this Kingdom, for Crimes by them committed in the Plantations.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas a due punishment is not provided for several Crimes and Offences committed out of this his Majesties Realm of <HI>England,</HI> whereof divers Governours, Lieut.

<P>This Prosecution seems to be made to frustrate and evade this Act of Parliament. The Subject is oppre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, or conceives himself to be so he complains of this Oppression; this Complaining is made TREASON! Here is a strange and fatal Dilemma on the Subjects of the Plantations; They must either suffer their Oppressions or be hanged for Traytors if they Complain!</P>
<P>What relates to the Act of Assembly of this Country, it can by no Na∣tural or Legal Construction be extended to make the Prisoner cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pable: It is plain by the whole purport of the Act, that it has made no New Trea∣son, it only Recognizes the King and Queen, and Enacts, That those who shall do any thing distructive to that establishment, by Fore of Arms, or otherwise, shall be <HI>Rebels</HI> and <HI>Traytors,</HI> which they would be without this Act. If th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Address and Petition had been to the <HI>French King,</HI> the thing had been of another Nature. By the same Construction every petty Battery or other little Trespass may be a Treason.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="001038_0030_0FAEF1B740806B00"/>
The Petition of Coll. <HI>Bayard</HI> and the other three, is so far from disown∣ing the Government, that it is a direct acknowledging of the same: The Direction of the Petition is, <HI>To the Lieut. Governour and the Council.</HI> The Expression. (<HI>That they have Advice that the Lord</HI> Cornbury <HI>is to succeed the Earl of</HI> Bellomont) can with no Jusitice or common Sence be construed to be a disowning and casting off o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Government. I think it will hardly be affirmed that the Council succeeded the Earl of <HI>Belloment,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Nanfan</HI> the Council: If so after the Earl of <HI>Bel∣lomont</HI> who was Cap. General
<NOTE PLACE="marg"> Some time after the Earl of <HI>Bellamont</HI>'s Death Capt. <HI>Nanfan</HI> the Lieut. Governour was at <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></NOTE>? We had seven Capt. Generals; which is an A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rdity I suppose none will alledge. A familiar Example will demon∣strate the weakness &amp; falsity of this Construction: If a Capt. of a Company be killed or absent, the Lieutenant or next Office has the full Command of the Company, as the Capt. had, or could have; but I think no man will say he succeeds the Capt. or that when another Capt. is appointed, be succeeds that Lieut. or other Officer. So that I cannot think there is any Fact or Crime alledged or proved against the Prisoner, to charge him with this high Crime of Treason, or indeed with any other Crime whatsoever.</P>

<P>By your Honour's permission I am of Council for Coll. <HI>Bayard</HI> the Prisoner at the Barr, but by reason I am unwilling to spend too much of your time, this Tryal already having been very long, and Mr. <HI>Nicoll,</HI> who is also of Council of the same side, having amongst other things made it very evident, that for the Subject to Petition his Majesty, is their antient and undoubitable Right.</P>
<P>I shall therefore make it may business only, as near as <HI>I</HI> can, to demon∣strate to this Court and Jury, That had the King's Council made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mple proof of all the Matters of Fact alledged in the Indictment, as the signing the Addresses, and other things therein contained, to have been true; yet in point of Law they cannot amount to that grand Crime of <HI>High <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reason</HI></P>
<P>In order to this, shall with as much brevity as I can, examine into, and put your Honours in mind, and withal inform the Gentlemen of the Jury what the Law of <HI>England</HI> by which we are or ought to be govern'd here) hath been, for near the space of four hundred years last past, relating to this grand Crime of High-Treason: whereby it will manifestly appear how cautious the Parliaments of <HI>England</HI> have been, in making and increasing the Laws to take away me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s lives, and particularly for High-Treason. And shall begin with the Statute of 25 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. a Statute to which the greatest Regard has been paid, of any Act of Parliament what∣soever, unless <HI>Magne Charta,</HI> as hereafter I shall briefly shew</P>
<P>I must also observe to your Honours, that before the making of this Act of Parliament of the 25 <HI>E.</HI> 3. which was in <HI>Anno</HI> 1350 and which was the very first Act relating to Treasons, so many things were charged as High-Treason by the common Law, and there were so many Ambiguities and Diversities of Opinions, that both History and our Books of the Law sufficiently inform us, that scarcely any man knew how to behave himself. But now by this Statute the particulars and Species of this grand Crime are reckoned up, and all others excluded, till declared by Parliament.
<PB N="27" REF="001038_0031_0FAEF1B74DF76C98"/>
For though nothing can concern the King, his Crown and Dignity more immediately than High-Treason, which our Law calls <HI>Crimen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>Maje∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atis,</HI> a Crime wronging Majesty; yet this good King <HI>Edward the 3d.</HI> at the request of the Lords and Commons of <HI>England,</HI> in a Parliamentary way, and to make all after Ages happy, makes a plain Declaration of such Offences as should for the future be deem'd for High-Treason, and none other, unless declared by Parliament.</P>
<P>This Act of Parliament is branch't out by <HI>Sir Edw. Cook</HI> in the 3d part of his <HI>Institutes,</HI> into fix Classes or Heads, which I shall the rather take Notice of, for that Tryals of this Nature are very rare in the Plantations; and they are these,

<P>Now if there is any other Offence, which was not comprehended within one of these Classes, the same was thereby declared to be no Treason.</P>
<P>In the Clause of which Act of Parliament, we find these words, which I shall the rather read, because I apprehend it will very much concern this ensuing Tryal</P>
<P><Q>And because that many other like Cases may happen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to come, which a Man cannot think of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>are at this present time. It is O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dained, That if any other case, supposed Treason, which is not above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, do happen, before an Justices, the Justices shall carry, withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any going to Judgment of the Treason, till the cause be shewed and declared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the King and his Parliament, whether it be judged Treason, or other Fellony.</Q></P>
<P>By this we may easily perceive, and its very obvious, that this cause was made to prevent the Judges from taking upon them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> declare any thing to be High-Treason, but such as are particularly exprest by this Sta∣tute of 25 <HI>Ed</HI> 3. or by some other subsequent Act.</P>
<P>Again, in the Reign of <HI>Richard 2d.</HI> we find sundry other things were decla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by Parliament to be High-Treason, which were not comprehenced within the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 25 <HI>Ed</HI> 3. But yet upon the coming in of <HI>Hen</HI> 4. It was again enacted and declared, That nothing should for the future be adjudg∣ed High-Treason But what were so ordained by the aforesaid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 25 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> The words are these,</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="001038_0032_0FAEF1B80F119AE0"/>
<HI>1 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 4. <HI>cap</HI> 10. <Q>That whereas in Parliament, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th year of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> King <HI>Richard,</HI> divers pains of Treason were ordained by Statute; in∣asmuch as there was no man which knew how he ought to behave him∣self, to do, speak or say, for doubt of such Pains. Its accorded and assented by the King, Lords and Commons, That in no time to come any Treason be adjudged otherwise, than it was ordained by the Statute in the time of his Noble Grand-father King <HI>Edw.</HI> 3.</Q></P>
<P>Now this Statute, I am humbly of Opinion, is directly in the Negative, which says. That for the future nothing shall be adjudged Treason, other∣wise than it was ordained by the aforesaid Statute 25 Edw. 3</P>
<P>Yet nevertheless this indictment is grounded up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an Act of Assembly of this Province, which is, I am humbly of Opinion, not only contrary to, but directly repugnant to the aforesaid Statute (which appeareth to me to limit all new Species of Treason to be declared in Parliament, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> else where) Which if it should admit of such a Construction, as is now intended, I think I may modestly say, it will introduce five hundred several new species of Treason, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o that his Majesties good Subjects of this Province would fall under much greater Hardships than whatever the People of <HI>England</HI> were sensible of before the making of this Act, which I cannot to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> often mention, the 25 Edw. 3.</P>
<P>If we look further downward upon the coming in of Edw 6 which was in the Year 1546. sundry new species of Treason having been again introduced by Act of Parliament, it was in the very first Year of his Reign Enacted, That no Offence made Treason by any Statute, should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o deemed and adjudged for the future, but such as were made Treason by the aforesaid S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at. 25 Edw. 3. other than such as were by that present Statute ordained and declared.</P>
<P>But yet in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Time, in the first year of her Reign, this grand Crime was brought to its an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient Standard, and it was then declared in Parliament. <HI>That no Act <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> whatsoever should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Treason or Mispr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion of Treason but such as were decla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> by the Statute</HI> 25 Edw. 3. and the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Preamble is this, <HI>That the state and safety of the King standeth more assuredly by the Love of his Subjects than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of his Laws</HI></P>
<P>So that upon Examination, we find how careful and cautious the People &amp; Parliament of <HI>England</HI> have been in introducing and increasing of Sangui∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ary Laws, and that through the Revolution of many Ages. And hereby <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very remarkable what a great Regard has been in all Ages paid to this ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able Statute 25 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. which with great c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re has been consisted down to us to this very time, and is now in its full force. Sir <HI>Edw. Cook</HI> treating thereof tells us, That the Parliament in which this Act was made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> many years afterwards was called, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Parliamentum,</HI> The Blessed Parliament</P>
<P>If we look but into the Bill of Attainder of <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> in the year 1640, &amp; 41. even in those times, what Regard was paid to this Statute, which I have so often mentioned, wherein it was provided, That the Judgment against said Earl should never be drawn into Presi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent. And the words are those, <Q>Provided, That no Judge or Judges, Justice or Justices whatsoever shall adjudge or interpret any Act of Thing to be
<PB N="29" REF="001038_0033_0FAEF1B8CAD12270"/>Treason, nor hear or determine any Treason in any other manner than he or they should or ought to have done before the making of this Act.</Q></P>
<P>Now, if we do but Reflect upon the great Concern and Care that has been taken through all Ages, by the wise People of <HI>England,</HI> in preve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g, the Judges from in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erpre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing any A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t or Thing whatsoever to be Treason, but such only as are enumerated in the Statute 25 <HI>Edw</HI> 3.</P>
<P>And at the sometime give ourselves leave to think how industrousl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we labour to introduce an Act of Assembly of this Province, to make, as I said before, even five <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>undred New &amp; Never-heard-of Species of Treason, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, if we do bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consider this, 'tis matter of great Amazement, and more especially in such an Age as this, and in so happy a Reign, where no man over qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stioned or at the least doubted of the true enjoyment of our Laws and Liberties, tho' never so remove from the Fountain b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d.</P>
<P>I am afraid I have already Trespass'd upon your Honour's Patience, shall therefore conclude with some Observations upon the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Assembly, upon which this Indictment is laid.</P>
<P>Now both the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le, Preamble and Words of this Act of Assembly, and the cause of making thereof, is very obvious (however the same may be now interpreted) which were these two.</P>
<P><HI>1st.</HI> For the future to prevent the setting up a Power over his Majesties Subjects in this Province, without Authority from the Crown <HI>England,</HI> which was found to be of fatal consequence in the late unhappy Disorders in this Province.</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> To express the Love, Loyalty and hearty Affection of the People to their Majesties. King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as in them lay to Recognize them their Soveraign L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge Lord and Lady. I doubt not but your Honour will see cause to recommend the same to the Jury in de∣livering the Charge. And that no strain'd Construction of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of As∣sembly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ever affect the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isoner, Coll. <HI>Bayard</HI> or at the least blest his long experienc'd Loyalty to the Crown or <HI>England,</HI> and in a special manner to his present M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jesty King <HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>I had almost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to beg leave of the Court to apply my self to the Gentlemen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Jury, to obviate some Objections or rather a vulgar Error that usually hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ept in amongst them, upon Tryals, and particularly upon Indictments, which is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve,</P>
<P>That it the matters of Fact alledged in the Indictment, be but proved, they are to have no regard to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Law. Which I take to be a very great and dangerous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or in them.</P>
<P>For tho' it be true and mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t be granted, that Matters of Fact are the most common and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oper Object <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jury's Determination, and Mat∣ters of Law that of the Judges; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> ariseth cut of, and is inter wo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n and complicated with Fact, it cannot but fall under the Jury's Consi∣deration. For should it be otherwise, if a Person should be indicted for doing any common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Act, if it be but cloathed and dis∣guised in the Indictment with the Name of Treason, or some other high Crime, and proved by Witnesses to be done, then the Jury would lie under a Necessity of finding the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>one<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> guilty. No.</P>
<P>Do we not find in most general Issues, upon <HI>Not Guilty</HI> pleaded, as
<PB N="30" REF="001038_0034_0FAEF1B98E1AA050"/>upon Indictments of Trespasses, Breach of the Peace, Fellony, and even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Cases of High Treason, yet the Jury do not find the Fact of the Case by it self, leaving the Law to the Court, but findeth the party Guilty or Not Guilty.</P>
<P>And this will more evidently appear upon Indictments of Murther, that the Jury are Judges as well of Matter of Law as of Fact. For is it not every Days Practice, where Persons are indicted of Murther, the Jury doth not only find them <HI>Guilty</HI> or <HI>Not Guilty.</HI> But many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon hearing and weighing of Circumstances, the Jury brings in the Prisoner not only <HI>Guilty</HI> or <HI>Not Guilty</HI> in general, but brings them in either <HI>Guilty of Murther</HI> or <HI>Manslaughter by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> adventure,</HI> or <HI>se Defendendo, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>So the Jury being well apprize<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the true Matter of Fact, of which they are sole Judges, can better apply the Matter of Law; for, says my Lord <HI>Cook, Its by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tly applying Matters of Fact and Law together that the Jury brings forth their Vera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> which I hope you Gentlemen of the Jury will carefully do.</P>

</SP>
<P>The Evidence being Sworn and examined, the Solicitor General, with∣out answering the Authorities offered by the Prisoner's Council, relating to the Treason, summoned up the Evidence, as to matter of Fact</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Atwood</HI> gave the Charge to the Jury, in a long Discourse; and among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> things insisted, that the Indictment was not laid upon the Act of 25 <HI>E.</HI> 3 nor any Act of Parliament, but upon an Act of Assembly of this Province, confirmed by his Majesty, which had Power to make Acts
<PB N="31" REF="001038_0035_0FAEF1BA88D17A10"/>for High Treason, as well as the Parliament of <HI>England;</HI> and that the said Statute was confined to <HI>England,</HI> because by the said Statute, it is enacted that if any Doubt should arise, the same be adjourned unto Parliament, which must be understood of the Parliament of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>That it is High Treason by the Act of Assembly, by any manner of ways, or upon any pretence whatsoever by force of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or otherwise, to disturb the Peace. Good and Quiet of the Government, as it is now established, which he said was proved by Overt Acts laid in the Indictment, which were by signing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bells against the Government, and thereby enticing the People to cast off and disown the same, and chiefly by the Souldiers signing Complaints against their chief O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ers, which tended to Mutiny, and was Treason by the Common Law.</P>
<P>That by bringing the Papers to <HI>Hutchins</HI>'s House the Prisoner had made himself guilty of all that was done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, by the Souldiers and others sign∣ing those Papers.</P>
<P>That the right of Petitioning the King was not in dispute, but the man∣ner of doing it made it Criminal.</P>
<P>That it was plain the Address of the Prisoner and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> three Fellows, was a Disowning of the present Authority, and casting off his Majesty's Government as it was then established; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Capt. <HI>Nanfan</HI> succeeded the Lord <HI>Bellomont</HI> (as by the Commission appeared) and not my Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> which was a plain Overt Act of Treason, by the meaning and words of the Act of Assembly.</P>
<P>That it appeared undeniable, that the Prisoner and his Son were always by the Papers, and that it was done with a great Number of People to affront the Government.</P>
<P>That the drawing in Souldiers to sign Petitions, is Mutiny and Sedition by the Law, and drawing of them in on false pretences, in hopes of Free∣dom in the City, and subscribing their Names on blank Lists, is listing of Souldiers, and may be applyed to invite in any Forreign Power. And thereupon stro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uously insisted on the Validity of the Evidence, That the Facts la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in the Indictment were undenyably proved, and that those facts did amount to High-Treason, within the words &amp; meaning of this Act of Assembly, and that therefore the Jury could not do otherwise than bring in the Prisoner Guilty.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onstable being Sworn to keep the Jury, the Court adjourned till nine a Clock at night.

<P>Though it is very plain to me, and I suppose to the Court, that what I have affirmed in this matter is Truth, yet I shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much insist upon it, because, if the acts themselves should be admitted to be true, they do not fall under any of the heads or species of Treason so made by the <HI>English Laws,</HI> or by any Natural and Reasonable Construction of the Act of Assembly of this Government; which being wholly matter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Law, I shall leave to your Honours Consideration, and pass to the words of the Com∣mission, which are strictly limitted to the <HI>19th of February;</HI> so that what∣soever hath been done since. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> humbly conceive has been <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ram no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Judice,</HI> and therefore void. To prove this, there is the great Case between the Earl of <HI>Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cester</HI> and Sir <HI>Christopher H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yden</HI> in <HI>Plowdens.</HI> Reports: The Case was thus; Sir <HI>Robert D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dly</HI> was in Arms in open Rebellion against Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etting up the Title of the Lady <HI>Jane;</HI> he was taken Prisoner, and a Commission issued out to the Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and divers others, to enquire of this Treason. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> eight of those Commissioners an Indict∣ment for High-Treason was found against the said Sir <HI>Robert Dudly:</HI> After∣wards a Commission issued to the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and others, to receive an Indictment against the said <HI>Robert Dudly</HI> for High-Treason, said to be found before Fifteen Commissioners, and the same to Hear, Try and Determine. Upon this the said <HI>Dudly</HI> was arraigned before them upon
<PB N="34" REF="001038_0038_0FAEF1BE39E50B80"/>this Indictment taken before eight; to which he pleaded <HI>Guilty,</HI> and had Judgment of High-Treason. After this an Act of Parliament was made to confirm this Attainder, and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> by her Letters Patents granted the Lands of <HI>Dudly</HI> to Sir <HI>Christopher Heydon. Dudly</HI> was afterwards created Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> brings an Action of Trespass against Sir <HI>Chr. Heydon;</HI> he pleads in Bar the whole matter before recited, to which the Plantiff de∣murr'd. It was resolved by the Court, That the Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and others, proceeding upon an Indictment found before Eight, where the Commission was to proceed on an Indictment taken before Fifteen, had exceeded the Limits of their Commission, and all what they had done was <HI>Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> non Judice,</HI> and void; and that being so, the Act of Parliament did not help it, it making no new Attaindor, and could not confirm, where there was none before, &amp; therefore the Plantiff had Judgment to Recover. The Argument in this Case is strong<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, being specially limitted to a Day, which the Commissioners have exceeded.</P>

<SPEAKER>Nicoll.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the Commission was in common Form, to construe it ac∣cording to usual Practice, were rational; but being wholly our of com∣mon Form, to construe it contrary to the express plain words and against the common sence and understanding of those words, seems highly un∣reasonable.</P>
</SP>
<P>With this agrees the Judgment given in <HI>Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dens</HI> Reports between <HI>Nicolls</HI> and <HI>Nicolls,</HI> and the Rule there given by <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pen,</HI> in these words. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appoint per Commission non<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ascune poier forsque cio lim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> per Com∣mission;</HI> Persons appointed by Commission have no other Power but that limited to them by Commission.</P>
<P>In the Execution of an antient Office, which is by the Common Law, a mans Actions shall be construed liberally and favourably, according to usage and custom but the Actions of men proceeding by special Commis∣sion, shall be construed strictly, and according to the Letter and Limita∣tion of their Commission.</P>
<P>To make any other Construction would be very inconvenient; for should it be admitted that Persons acting by Commission, might extend their Power, limited by their Commissions, never so little, they might by the same Rule extend their Power <HI>ad Infinitum.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I very well remember that the Court was pleased to tell the Jury, after they had been together some days, and not being agreed upon the Verdict, <HI>That if they were under any Difficulty whether the Overt Acts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Indictment, if proved, were Treason, of they found the Prisoner Guilty, he had his Remedy by moving the Matter of Law in Arrest of Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>I therefore humbly offer, in arrest of Judgment, That if the Overt Acts laid in the Indictment were admitted to be proved, yet in point of Law they cannot amount to High-Treason, within the meaning of the Act of Assembly upon which the Indictment is laid.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="001038_0039_0FAEF1BF233C3F98"/>
For I take it that all Acts of Parliament, and consequently Acts of As∣sembly, are to be understood and taken by reasonable Construction, to be gathered and collected out of the words of the Act only, and that accor∣ding to the natural, grammatical, plain and legal Sense thereof, without any forc'd Interpretation.</P>
<P>Then if so, this Act of Assembly both by the Title, Preamble, and the Enacting part thereof, plainly demonstrates the meaning of the Law-makers, and what was thereby designed for the future to prevent. The Title of this Act is in these words, <HI>An Act for the Quieting and Settling the Disorders that have lately happened within this Province, and for establishing and securing their Majesties present Government against the like Disorders for the future.</HI> Now what these Disorders were, we have great cause to remember, and they are very well known to this Court to have been occasioned by some Persons setting up an Arbitrary Power over the Kings Subjects with∣out Authority from the Crown of <HI>England</HI> as appears from the Preamble of the said Act, part whereof is in these words, <HI>And whereas the late has<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y and inconsiderate Violation of the good and quiet of this Province by the seting up a Power over their Majesties Subjects, without Authority from the Crown of</HI> England, <HI>both vitiated and deba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hed the Minds of many People.</HI> &amp;c. <HI>For the prevention whereof in time to come, Be it exacted,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>That whatsoever Person or Persons shall by any manner of ways, or upon any pretence whatsoever, endea∣vour by fore of Arms or otherwise to disturb the Peace, Good and Quiet of this their Majestie Government as it is now established, shalt be deemed and esteem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d as Rebells and Traytors, &amp;c</HI></P>
<P>From hence it plainly appears, that the Intention of the Law-makers was only to declare such Person or Persons Rebels and Traytors as should, for the future set up a Power over his Majesties Subjects in this Province, with∣out Authority from the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> which undoubtedly is Treason within the Statute of 25 <HI>Edw</HI> 3</P>
<P>But it can never he understood, (without the greatest of Violence to the reasonable Construction of the said Act of Assembly, &amp; the plain Intention of the Makers thereof) to be construed to extend to the signing the Ad∣dresses mentioned in the Indictment, which is the only thing the Prisoner is positively charged withal; for all the rest are only presumtive, construc∣tive and accumulative Crimes drawn from thence.</P>
<P>But, says <HI>Mr Solicitor,</HI> the words of this Act of Assembly are in generals, <HI>That if any Person shall endeavour by force of Arms, or Otherwise to disturb the peace, good and quiet of the Government, shall be deemed and esteemed Rebels and Traytors.</HI></P>
<P>Now from the word <HI>[Otherwise] Mr. Solicitor</HI> would fain insinuate that the Prisoner is within the meaning of the Act of Assembly: A very fine Explanation! for by such a Construction as this every breach of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, suddain Quarrel or small Battery shall be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emed Treason. I shall not further add upon this Head, but only offer my humble Opinion. That here in the Plantations we are not capable in our Assemblies to make and declare any new Species of Treason, but such as are comprehended in the Statute 25 <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dw</HI> 3. or some other subsequent Statute.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the special Commission of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and <HI>Terminer,</HI> that it is long since
<PB N="36" REF="001038_0040_0FAEF1BF9CF888D0"/>expired by its own Limitation, is very plain and self evident; for it im∣powers your Honours even to meet and make enquiry as the City Hall on the 19th of <HI>February,</HI> and upon the said Day all and singular the Premises to hear and determine.</P>
<P>This indeed may be call'd a Special Commission, for it is not in the com∣mon Form of Commissions of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer,</HI> as our Books direct, for if we look at the form of this Commission in the Register, or in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Her∣bert</HI>'s <HI>Natar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Brevin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> or in the 4th part of Sir <HI>Ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Cook</HI> in his <HI>Institutes,</HI> they all agree in one Form, and are very different from this Commission; for by those Commissions, the Times and Places of their Meeting are left to the discretion of the Commissioners, and the words are these. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Mandamus quod ad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s &amp; Loc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ quod ves vel duo res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erm ad hoc Pro∣videritis, Inqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tonem illam factatis.</HI></P>
<P>Yet in this special Commission both the Time and Place of your Meeting, Enquiring, Hearing and Determining are specially limitted to the 19th of <HI>February</HI> at the City Hall of this City, and not <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</HI> So that I am of Opinion, that your Honours are strictly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed up by the words of your Commission, and that all your Proceedings against the Prisoner since the 19th of <HI>February</HI> are Unwarrantable, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Judice.</HI></P>

<P><HI>1st</HI> For Persons appointed to act by special Commission only, as in this case, they have no Authority but what is specially given them by the very words of their Commission.</P>
<P><HI>2dly</HI> But if Person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any thing by virtue of their Office, as the Chief Justice of the <HI>Kings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Common Pleas,</HI> the common Law in a great measure, explains their Authority and Power.</P>
<P>But, says Mr. <HI>Solicitor,</HI> a Day in Law is many times construed not ac∣cording to the litteral Sense, but according to a Legal understanding; and that a whole Term (which con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s of 28 Days, to some purposes) is but as one Day in the Law. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what be infers from his I cannot see. unless he could draw this conclusion, That it wil hold, <HI>vice versa,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Numerical Day, as the 29th of <HI>February,</HI> in construction of Law, is taken for 28 Days; which is a great absurdity.</P>
<P>Tho' what already has been offered. I hope will be sufficient to stay and arrest Judgment, yet I have several other things in behalf of the Prisoner (by your Honours permission) to move in arrest of Judgment, and which are not mentioned in the Reasons which were a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>igned in writing, and pray liberty to offer them <HI>Ore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></P>

<P>In a long Speech, said, What the <HI>Solicitor</HI> has offer'd is sufficient to Over-rule the Reasons exhibited in arrest of Judgment; for its evidently proved that the Prisoner has disturbed the Peace, Good and Quiet of the Government, as it is now established, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. By enticing the People to sign scandalous Libells against the Govern∣ment, at the Coffee House, and at his own House, by the Oath of <HI>Peter Od<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re,</HI> telling him, it was for the good of the Country; and his bringing them to Alder-man <HI>Hutchins</HI>'s makes him equally guilty to the Souldiers signing Complaints against their chief Officers, thereby enticing them to Mutiny; which Souldiers are part of the seven Thousand Men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed by Act of Parliament for Defence of the Kingdom, which is High Treason by the Common Law, as well as by Act of Assembly.</P>

<P>May it please your Honour, I ever abho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d that hanious and abominable Crime of High-Treason, as much as Death it self; I call God and my Conscience to witness. That I am as Innocent of it as the Child Unborn: I never spoke to any of the Souldiers to make any Complaint, or sign any Addresses, or other Paper whatsoever. I own I was present at the Coffe-House at the signing of an Address to the King, another to the Parliament, and another to the Lord <HI>Cornbury;</HI> and I own that the two first eontained some Complaints of Grievances we supposed to lie, un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er &amp; the latter a Congratulation. I had the best Council <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could get for so doing, and that it was the Subjects Right to Petition the King, by the Act of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of W. &amp; Mary;</HI> and I th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nk the Subjects should be worse than Saves, if they shall be arraigned for High-Treason for complaining to their Prince.</P>
<P>I must further beg leave to say, Your Honour was much mistaken in suming up just now what the Witnesses had Sworn; and the Jury by that Paper the Fore-man read in Court) had likewise a wrong Notion of it, which I desired then I might Controul, but your Honour over-ruled it; as not to be allowed after the Charge was given. It was not proved by
<PB N="38" REF="001038_0042_0FAEF1C10F3F6970"/>any of the Witnesses that the Peace of the Government had been disturbed: None of 'em said I had inticed any Person whatsoever to sign the Addres∣ses; nor that I was present at the Souldiers signing at <HI>Hutchins</HI>'s, much less that I enticed them to Mutiny. I knew nothing of their signing, I was not at the House all that time; Mr. <HI>Solicitor</HI> had Mrs <HI>Hutchins</HI> sworn, who said the same None of 'em say, that in said Address the Assembly was called <HI>Ʋnlawful,</HI> but only that the Speaker wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an <HI>Alien;</HI> nor that the Lieut.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Coll. D' Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster, Sir;</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Take leave to acquaint you, That tho' it has pleased God to suffer your self, and some of your Relations to be the likely chief Instruments of the total Destruction both of my self, and all my Family and Posterity, that yet notwithstanding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have that Peace with my self, (and I can but only thank God for his all sufficient Grace of strengt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ening me in it) that I am Reconciled to all Mankind whatsoever, and that I hope one of my last Prayers will be, That God out of his Infinite Mercy will graci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usly Pardon all those that have had a hand to cut me off. <HI>Sir,</HI> believe me as you may give Credit to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he words of a Dying Man (since I find the Job is to be done, and that it is now past your Power to stop the current) that shall also dye with a clear and good Conscience, &amp; as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of that horrid Crime laid to my charge as the Child yet unborn. And therefore I hope Gods Merciful Hand, who has never left nor fortaken me, will continue to support me to the very last, and that I may look Death in the face as a good <HI>Christian</HI> ought to do, humbly submitting my all to his most Wise, most Just and most Merciful Dispensations; for I am sensible there is no more than one Death for me, and that in all probability, considering my
<PB N="39" REF="001038_0043_0FAEF1C1DB7F0C18"/>Age, it might have been very soon, though this Tribulation had not be∣fallen me. I shall only add, that I hope in Gods Mercy for the Pardon of all my manifold Sins and Transgressions, through the only Merits of my Saviour Jesus Christ, and that when I shall be no more, he will continue his Grace to my dear Wife, and my Posterity: And <HI>lastly,</HI> That my Blood, which is struck at (by your Brother's own expressions to my self, and your Brother in Laws to others, both not long since) may be the last to be spilt on account of our dismal and unhappy Divisions, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out of my Ashes such further Calamities may arise to this poor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Province, that Posterity will have cause long to lament; for it is not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> expected that all the Plots.

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Petty Jury (in a manner) forced upon your Petitioner,

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That all what has been Sworn against your Petitioner, was, <HI>1st.</HI> That the Petitioners Name was seen to the Address to the Lord <HI>Corn∣bury,</HI> but that they knew not whether it was hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hand writing. <HI>2dly,</HI> That the Petitioner had been present at the Coffee-House, and at his own House when the Addresses to the King, and another to the Parliament, &amp; another to the Lord <HI>Cornbury</HI> were signed by several of the Free-holders, Free-men and Inhabitants of this City, but that he had desired none of them to sign the same. <HI>3dly</HI> That the Petitioner had brought some Papers, supposed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid Addresses, to the House of Alder-man <HI>Hutchins. 4thly.</HI> That the Address to the Lord <HI>Cornbury</HI> contained only a Cong<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atulation at his safe arrival, and a hearty desire, that with it all our Divisions mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. be healed, and that the very Name of <HI>Party</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>action might vanish and be ex∣tinguish'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and that in the two former, or in one of them, either to the King or Parliament, some Complaints were made of Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evances without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣membring the particulars; only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Clow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> wore, That to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m∣brance, in both, or in one of the Addresses to the King or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Parliament, mention was made. That some of the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st</HI> and <HI>Ignorantest</HI> of the People were put in Offices; That the Speaker of the Assembly was c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lenged to be an Alien; That the said Assembly had given a Gift to the Lieut.

And Swore further, That in none of them any Re∣flections were made (as he conceived) to the prejudice of the lieu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Gover∣nour; and that in none of them the words <HI>Ʋnlawful</HI> or <HI>Oppression</HI> were mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That all the rest of the Evidences swore nothing (against your Petitioner) but that they had signed the Addresses at Alder-man <HI>Hutchins</HI>'s, That two or three of the Souldiers had a Glass of Wine given them, but not for signing it being <HI>Christmas</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime; and that some of them expected to be made free of the City, but not of the Garrison.</P>
<P><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it please your Honours,</HI> Your Petitioner finds, by the Notes him∣self has taken at his Tryal, that nothing more has been sworn against him; whereupon the Jury being ignorant People, found him guilty, because some part of the Indictment was proved, as to the signing of said Addresses and what the Contents of them were only by the Oath of one Witness.</P>
<P><HI>Your Petitioner therefore humbly prays, That your Honours will be pleased to take the Premises into your serious Consideration, whether by the Laws of</HI> England <HI>or this Province, it can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bount to the Crime of High-Treason what has been sworn against him, as above exprest. And if not that our Honours will favourably order an arrest of Judgment, for the Reasons above mentioned &amp; what has been already offered to your Honour by the Petitioners Council. And as in Duty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Emot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am ready, and shall begin the first. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <HI>Andre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> one of the Petty Jury, is an Alien; we have two Evidences to prove the same.

<P>We cannot admit you any such Proo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, for tho' this might have been a good exception for cause before he or they had be sworn, but now its too late; therefore go on to the next.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emot.</SPEAKER>
<P>This seems very hard, for we ought to have been tryed by the the Kings lawful Leige People, and we apprehend these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not such, but we came not to the knowledge of this till after the Trya<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Atwood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Mr. <HI>Emot,</HI> delay the Court no longer, but proceed to the second Reason assigned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emot.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>2d Reason</HI> is, that the <HI>Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> or <HI>Ven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to summon the Petty Jury, is wrong awarded, or rather not awarded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Our happy Constitution of Government is, That all Tryals of this Nature must be by the Verdict of Twelve Men, and that as near as may be of the Neighbour∣hood where the fact ariseth, or is alledged to arise in the Indicment. Yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vertheless the Precept t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> summon the Jury, we find, is directed to the Sheriff to return Eighty Men of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailwick, where's he is Sheriff as well of the County of <HI>New-York,</HI> as of the City; and at the same time, the Matters of Fact alledged in the Indictment are said to be committed in the <HI>Dock</HI> and <HI>East Ward</HI> of this City. So that this is a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s-Tryal, upon which no Judgment can be given. And of this we have a multitude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣tion in our Books; and first, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Arundals</HI> case, <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o 6 books, p.</HI> 378 It was for the Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther of one <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</HI> and the Case was thus: The M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣ther was alledged to be done at the City of <HI>Westmin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter</HI> in a certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there, called <HI>Kings-street,</HI> in the Parish of St. <HI>Marg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</HI> For he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Issue a Jury was returned <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Westm Arn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l</HI> being found guilty, moves in arrest of Judgment, assigning for cause, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Jury ought to have been out of the Parish of St. <HI>Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> and not in g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e∣ral, out of the Neighbourhood of the City of <HI>Westmin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter:</HI> And it was adjudged a Mis-Tryal, and the Verdict was set-side and the I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, was done upon a special Consult of the Judges at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>So that we see how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Laws of <HI>England</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and the Judges thereof, that all Tryals of this Nature shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Ven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n that the Jury shall be summoned from the Neighbourhood where he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, And the reason thereof is grounded upon this Supposition and Presump<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, That the Neighbourhood are the best and must proper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers of Fact; for indeed its the Rule in the Law, That <HI>Vicinas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> vicin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pre∣sumitur s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re.</HI></P>
<P>But let me observe to your Honours. That our ease at the Far is much more uncertain, as to the awarding of the <HI>Venire sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>as</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um∣mon the Jury; for the fact is alledged to be done at the <HI>Dock</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Ward</HI> of this City, and Issue joyned thereupon. Yet the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>recep is directed to the Sheriff to Summon the Jury of his Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lwick, which, as I said before, con∣tains
<PB N="42" REF="001038_0046_0FAEF1C5E26684C0"/>both the City and County of <HI>New York,</HI> and without mentioning any Neighbourhood, and therefore may come out of the County, as well as from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity; and therefore of necessity must be esteemed a Mis-Tryal.</P>
<P>To this it may be objected, by such as are ignorant of our Laws, <HI>That notwithstanding the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was summoned from the Neighbourhood of the City of</HI> New York <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not from the County; for that they know the Persons to be such</HI> But this not appearing to be so upon Record, avails nothing; for the Rule of the Law is, <HI>What appears not, is not Existentibus &amp; non apparentibus cadem est ratio.</HI></P>

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> That the Precept to summon the Jury is not returned by the Sheriff, of any Endorsement thereupon, &amp; signed by him, against the known a Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and more particularly the Stat. 12 <HI>Edw. 2 cap 5.</HI> This Statute enjoynes that the Sheriff shall put his Name to every Return made by him, so that the Court may know of whom they took such Return, if need be. And I shall endeavour to prove from sundry adjudged cases, since the making of this Stature, That this Precept to summon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not being endorsed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Sheriff, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and not amendable.</P>

<P>In <HI>Ronsands</HI> Case in <HI>Lord C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Rep. 5 Book, p. 41</HI> in Ejectment upon a Verdict for the Plaintiff the Defendant moved in arrest Judgment, for the <HI>Venire facias</HI> was not returned or endorsed by the Sheriff tho' the <HI>Postea</HI> made mention that the Jury was returned <HI>per Mandatum Justic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rum.</HI> Yet in this case it was ruled, That that would nor help it: for the Judges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, That where there is no Return, it cannot be help't by the Statute 18 <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z.</HI> or any other of the Statutes of Jeofals; for that Statute only helps in imperfect and insufficient Returns, and such as want form, &amp; not such as are not return'd at all.</P>
<P>Again, in Sir <HI>Arthur Blackmores</HI> Case in said Book, <HI>Cov. Rep. p. 162</HI> in
<PB N="43" REF="001038_0047_0FAEF1C7408E5198"/>this case it was adjudged that Stat. 28 <HI>Eliz.</HI> doth not help a Tryal where no Return is made upon the Writ of <HI>Venire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> as was formerly, say they, adjudged in <HI>Rowlands</HI> case before cited. And our Books are full of Autho∣rities of this Nature, but shall not give you the trouble to mention any more.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solicitor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Emot,</HI> These Authorities which you have here cited, its true, are grounded upon the Statute which you have mentioned of 12 <HI>Ed</HI> 2. but this Statute has only relation to Writs, and in this case the Sheriff sum∣moned the Jury not by virtue of a Writ, but a Precept under the hands of the Commissioners, which differs the case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emot</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Solicitor,</HI> Then you say that the case at the Bar is not within the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ords of this Stat. 12 <HI>Ed</HI> 2 for that this is a Precept to summon the Jury, and not a Writ, and to consequently the Sheriff not obliged to sign and return the same. A very wise Distinction.</P>
<P>However, I shall endeavour to shew, that this Precept is within the Reason and Equity of the Statute, and that the same ought to be returned and signed by the Sheriff In order thereto I shall put this Court in mind, how Statutes have from time to time been taken by Equity in divers manners, that those things which are alike in Reason, are alike in Law; and that where an Act of Parliament hath been made to remedy some Mischiefs, that the same hath been extended to other things in like Degree, and that even in Penal Law. <HI>As for Example:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stat. of Gloucester. cap. 5</HI> By this Statute, an Action of Waste is given against one who holds for years; yet by the Equity of this Statute, a man shall have an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction against him who holds but for half a year, notwith∣standing the Act be Penal.</P>
<P><HI>Westm 2. cap. 3.</HI> This Statute gives an Action of <HI>cui in vita,</HI> after the Coverture disselved by Death, Yet if the Coverture be dissolved by Divorce; the Wife shall have, by the equity of this Statute, a Writ of <HI>cut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI></P>
<P>And lastly, the <HI>Stat. 25 Edw. 3. de proditionibus,</HI> This Statute expressly says, That no case shall be taken by equity unless it be adjudged in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arlia∣ment; and yet by the equity of the words of that Statute, which are, <HI>If the Servant kill the Master,</HI> it is taken, <HI>If the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d kill the Mastress,</HI> That this is Petty Treason.</P>
<P>So that from hence I am humbly of Opinion, That we are fairly within the Equity of this <HI>Stat. 12 Edw.</HI> 2. Besides, a Writ and Precept in this Case are only S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nonimous Terms, and signifie one and the same thing.</P>
</SP>
<P>These Reasons were Over-ruled.</P>
<P>And the Court ordered the Sheriff to make a Return upon the Precept to summon the Jury, conform to the above <HI>Stat. 12 Edw.</HI> 2. which the Court said they had power to do, and to help that Defect.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find your Honour has Over-Ruled all the Reasons that we have offered in arrest of Judgment, in behalf of the Prisoner Coll <HI>Bayard,</HI> why Judgment ought not to pass against him, according to the Verdict of the Jury; but have not as yet observed that either Coll. <HI>D' Peyster</HI> or Capt. <HI>Walters</HI> have given their Opinion to all or any of the Reasons we have offered. I humbly therefore pray, that we may have their Opinion, so that we may know by what hands we fall.</P>

<SPEAKER>Atwood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Emot, You which have been assigned Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el for the Pri∣soner, have hitherto, in all the Course of the Tryal, carried your selves li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Men of your own Profession, you must not now therefore begin to menace the Court. You shall have the Opinion of the rest of the Commissioners.</P>
</SP>
<P>Whereupon Mr. <HI>Atwood</HI> turning himself to them, and whispering them, they severally did declare, That they were of Opinion with Justice <HI>Atwood,</HI> In that the Reasons offered were not sufficient to arrest the Judgment.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Atwood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Coll. <HI>Bayard,</HI> have you any thing to say why Sentence should not pass against you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prisoner.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have nothing more to offer than what my Council have offered, and what is contained in my last Petition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Atwood.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry to find you so Impenitent of your Crime, which is so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eino<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Abominable in the sight of God and Man. You have lately made Reflections upon the Proceedings of this Court against you as if it had been a design to do the Job, comparing your Case to that of <HI>Naboth's</HI> Vineyard. But I hope God will open your Eye, that you may be convinced, and Repent of the Crime.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then Pronounced Sentences in those words,</P>
<P>It is considered by the Court here, That you be carryed to the Place from whence you came, That from thence you be drawn upon a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urdle to the place of Execution, Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there you be Hanged by the Neck, and being alive, you be cut down upon the Earth; and that your Bowels be taken out of your Belly, and your Privy Members be cut off, and you being alive, they be burnt before your face; and that your Head be cut off, and that your Body be divided into four Quarters, and that the Head and Quarters be placed where our Lord the King shall assign. And the Lord have Mercy upon your Soul.</P>

<P>I desire to know whether I may have leave to answer to your Honour's Speech made before Sentence?</P>
