<L>'Tis POPE, my Friend, that guilds our gloomy Night,</L>

<L>As that I name? what Transports fire my Mind,</L>

<L>Exalted high, the SAVIOUR-GOD is known,</L>
<L>And dazling Glory blazes round his Throne;</L>
<L>Around his Head a beamy Lustre plays,</L>
<L>Where glittering Jewels blend their trembling Rays;</L>
<L>Eternal Day breaks from his radient Eyes,</L>
<L>And flames divinely o'er the shining Skies:</L>
<L>Thus sits the GOD, with awful Honours crown'd</L>
<L>While everlasting Ages wheel their mighty Round! —</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, pause my Muse; cease my unartful Song:</L>
<L>The Beauties which I strive to praise I wrong.</L>
<L>The Scenes so fast upon my Fancy flow,</L>
<L>Convinc'd, I own ETERNITY a <HI>NOW.</HI></L>

<L>Then, lasting as your Theme, shall be your Fame:</L>
<L><PB N="57" REF="005355_0060_1017224D26392800"/>
Thus let your Poesy resins, improve,</L>
<L>And match the Musick of the Choirs above;</L>
<L>Still from your Lips let such soft Notes arise,</L>
<L>And Songs of Seraphs sound beneath the Skies;</L>
<L>Till, as your Muse, your Soul expands her Wings,</L>
<L>And to their bright Abodes, exulting, springs:</L>
<L>There, there your Voice shall deathless Strains resound,</L>
<L>And be amid th' immortal Chorus drown'd.</L>
<L>So some full Spring a trickling Rill bestows,</L>
<L>That makes melodious Murmur as it flows;</L>
<L>It widens as it wanders on its Course,</L>
<L>And as it glides it gathers greater Force;</L>
<L>Still on it runs, and nought its Stream controuls,</L>
<L>It now a Riv'let, now a River rolls.</L>
<L>Now its strong Tyde, with unresisted Sway</L>
<L>Rushes impetuous down and foams away;</L>
<L>It pours along, and all its Banks out-braves</L>
<L>Till the vast Sea absorbs its undistinguish'd Waves.</L>

<L>As when dark Clouds rise slowly from the Main,</L>
<L>Then, in swift Sluices, deluge all the Plain,</L>
<L>Descending headlong down the Mountains sides,</L>
<L>A thousand Torrents roll their foamy Tides,</L>
<L>The rushing Rivers rapid roar around,</L>
<L>And all the Shores return the dashing sound:</L>
<L>Thus awful, slow, the fiery Deluge low'rs,</L>
<L>Thus rushes down, and thus resounding rores.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But O! what Sounds are able to convey</L>
<L>The wild Confusions of the dreadful Day!</L>
<L>Eternal Mountains totter on their Base,</L>
<L>And strong Convulsions work the Valley's Face.</L>
<L>Fierce Hurricanes on sounding Pinions soar,</L>
<L>Rush o'er the Land, on the toss'd Billows rore,</L>
<L>And dreadful in resistless Eddies driv'n,</L>
<L>Shake all the chrystal Battlements of Heav'n.</L>
<L>See the wild Winds, big-blust'ring in the Air,</L>
<L>Drive thro' the Forests, down the Mountains tare,</L>
<L>Sweep o'er the Vallies in their rapid Course,</L>
<L>And Nature bands beneath th' impetuous Force.</L>

Storms rush at Storms, at Tempests Tempests rore,</L>
<L>Dash Waves on Waves, and thunder to the Shore.</L>
<L>Columns of Smoke on heavy Wings ascend,</L>
<L>And dancing Sparkles fly before the Wind.</L>
<L>Devouring Flames, wide-waving rore aloud,</L>
<L>And melted Mountains form a fiery Flood:</L>
<L>Then, all at once, immenfe, the Fires arise,</L>
<L>A bright Destruction wraps the crackling Skies:</L>
<L>While all the Elements to melt conspire,</L>
<L>And the World blazes in the final Fire.</L>

<L>Yet shall ye, Flames, the wasting Globe refine,</L>
<L>And bid the Skies with purer Splendour shine;</L>
<L>The Earth, which the prolifick Fires consume,</L>
<L>To Beauty burns, and withers into Bloom;</L>
<L>Improving in the fertile Flame it lies,</L>
<L>Fades into Form, and into Vigour dies;</L>
<L>Fresh-dawning Glories blush amidst the Blaze,</L>
<L>And Nature all renews her flow'ry Face.</L>
<L>With endless Charms the everlasting Year</L>
<L>Rolls round the Seasons in a full Career;</L>

Where-e'er she treads, Lillies unbidden blow,</L>
<L>Quick Tulips rise, and sudden Roses glow:</L>
<L>Her Pencil paints a thousand beauteous Scenes,</L>
<L>Where Blossoms bud amid immortal Greens,</L>
<L>Each Stream, in Mazes, murmurs as it flows,</L>
<L>And floating Forests gently bend their Boughs.</L>
<L>Thou, <HI>Autumn,</HI> too, sitt'st in the fragrant Shade,</L>

<L>To the long Periods of thy future Date?</L>
<L>Strange Labyrinths my puz'led Soul confound,</L>
<L>And winde mysterious in an endless Round.</L>
</LG>

<L>Before this System own'd the central Sun;</L>
<L>Or Earth its Race about its Orbit run,</L>
<L>When Light ne'er dawn'd, nor Form display'd its Face,</L>
<L>But shapeless Matter fill'd th' unmeasur'd Space;</L>
<L>E'er <HI>Chaos</HI> self with jarring Discords rung</L>
<L>Or the rude Elements were together flung;</L>
<L>Then, then, ETERNITY, thy Pow'r was known,</L>
<L>Then did'st thou sit on thy unshaken Throne,</L>
<L>Thy Scepter flourish'd, never to decay;</L>
<L>IMMENSITY the Kingdom of thy Sway.</L>

<L>Anon, Creation rose in infant Bloom,</L>

Heav'ns mighty Vault was like a Curtain thrown,</L>
<L>Where the Stars twinkled, and the Ether shone,</L>
<L>Time leap'd to Life, and sped his March from far,</L>
<L>Seated on Motion, his triumphal Car:</L>
<L>Through all the Worlds of Light his Axil rung,</L>
<L>And rolling Wheels resistless smok'd along —</L>
<L>Yet, O ETERNITY, all Time to Thee,</L>
<L>Is a small Bark that floats in an unbounded Sea.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, O my Muse, with wondring Eyes, behold</L>
<L>Scenes that remain, and Ages yet untold.</L>
<L>Look! where Duration yet unborn appears,</L>
<L>In the long Train of still succeeding Years!</L>
<L>The vast Extension stretches unconfin'd,</L>
<L>My Thoughts perplexes, and o'erpow'rs my Mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Day shall come when this stupendous Ball</L>
<L>Shall haste to Ruins, and to nothing fall.</L>
<L>When Thou, Great GOD, shalt in the Clouds descend,</L>
<L>Lift up thy Hand, and swear that Time shall end.</L>

Hark! the dread Trumpet breathes the mighty Sound,</L>
<L>The swelling Accents through the Air rebound;</L>
<L>See! the Graves teem; the waking Saints arise;</L>
<L>And the new Bodies glitter up the Skies;</L>
<L>Then the last Flames, commission'd, downward pour,</L>
<L>Melt the rough Rocks, consume the burning Shore,</L>
<L>While the Sea bubbles in its final Roar.</L>
<L>All Nature sinks, and every World destroy'd,</L>
<L>Leaves a waste Darkness, and a tractless Void.</L>
<L>Now fainting Time, in one vast Wreck o'erthrown,</L>
<L>Sinks dying down, and gives its latest Groan;</L>
<L>ETERNITY who first its Being gave,</L>
<L>Its fruitful Mother once, becomes its Grave:</L>
<L>So Streams which from the Sea their Birth obtain,</L>
<L>Flow swift along, there to be lost again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, Oh! what Prospects open to my View!</L>
<L>What distant Scenes, my wond'ring Eyes pursue!</L>
<L>I see the gloomy, ever burning Caves,</L>

Loud roar the Flames, while rising Cries resound,</L>
<L>And endless Shreeks, and Blasphemies go round:</L>
<L>There Sinners waken from their idle Dreams,</L>
<L>And raging Devils curse the glowing Flames.</L>
<L>There coyls th' Old Serpent, strugling with his Chain.</L>
<L>Still hisses dire, and bites the Brass in vain.</L>
<L>ETERNITY, thy Breath the Flame inspires,</L>

<L>Far other Scenes my joyful Lays invite,</L>

<L>I see the pious Souls with Pleasure crown'd,</L>
<L>And o'er the holy Hills Delights abound.</L>
<L>But Oh! the Raptures which my Pow'rs confess</L>
<L>When JESUS shines in his refulgent Dress!</L>
<L>From his wide Wounds perpetual Streams of Light,</L>
