<P>IN the appearance, which is not of man, nor according to man, I looked, and beheld a great mountain;</P>
<P N="1">1—2 And thereon stood candlesticks of gold, of silver, of brass and iron, and in them were candles, some of them burning bright and clear, and some appeared dull, and almost gone out, and some were gone out quite.</P>
<P N="3">3 And others were covered with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to defend them from storms, for they were all standing open to the firmament; and whilst I looked, behold, the light of the sun disappeared for a short season, and clouds, and darkness, and storms, and tempests, came and beat upon the mountain; then the candle∣sticks (which were men) were left in thick darkness, for their candles were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out, and some of them overthrown; and whilst I was looking off the walls of the mountain, which was built of pure gold and precious stones,</P>
<P N="4">4 There appeared a numerous company from another coun∣try, following <HI>ignus fatus,</HI> and their leader rode a scarlet colour∣ed beast, and his name was Oppression and Defence; and when they that sat in darkness upon the mountain, saw the multitude which came forth, they went forth from the mountain, and broke over the precious walls that were round it, and went to the leader of the multitude, and honoured him with great honour, and some joined with him in his host, and followed <HI>ignus fatus,</HI> and they rejoiced, saying, We will do valiently, for our God is with us, and we will tread down our enemies, and every one that riseth up to oppress us; and others gave him money and many great gifts, saying, Go forth with thy army, and bear down those storms and tempests.</P>
<P N="5">5 So he went forth with his company, and fought against, but could not prevail; and they which remained in darkness upon the mountain <HI>(a),</HI> made war with the golden candlesticks, whose light appeared bright, and ceased not from shining; but they were not able so much as to dim the light thereof neither they nor the tempests that beat against them; For they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to a great <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which was in the midst of the mountain.</P>
<P N="6">6 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they who were in darkness, were grievously perplexed and pricked in their hearts, and gathered themselves together, <HI>(a)</HI> and considered one with another, saying, Let us <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our∣selves places of refuge, whereunto we may flee in time of trou∣ble <HI>(b);</HI> and they took the holy name of the God of heaven in vain,
<PB N="3" REF="010258_0003_0F7E246EE8CF8280"/>
saying, He will be with us, and go forth with our armies; and they made themselves preparations for war war <HI>(c).</HI></P>
<P N="7">7 And as I looked, one came forth in his glorious appear∣ance, and cried, saying, Cease ye to make unto yourselves mar∣tial preparations, and instruments of war and of defence; for behold, there is in this mountain a safe biding place <HI>(a);</HI> and the walls they are sure <HI>(b):</HI> But many believed not, for they were in darkness, and hardness of heart overcame them, so that they gave no heed unto him nor his messengers, which he sent unto many that remain exercising themselves in martial manner: and there came forth a voice from on high, saying to him to appeared, Remove the golden wall and bulwarks from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this mountain, for they have exalted themselves in their own strength <HI>(c),</HI> and have forgotten the might power, which is a place of refuge in the midst thereof <HI>(d),</HI> who built the walls, and set the candlesticks, and light the candles that are therein; and he said, Let the tower remain therein <HI>(e),</HI> and he that is able to flee unto it, let him flee, and be safe, for I am deter∣mined what I will do unto this place.</P>
<P N="8">8 And suddenly the walls, which were of gold and precious stones, were taken away from about the mountain, and the wild boar of the forest entered into the borders thereof, and raged in his fury, for his chains were loosed <HI>(a),</HI> and he was released out of his prison, and began to remove many candle∣sticks, and assayed to destroy the whole mountain, and the cry of the widow and orphans began to be heard in the land, and they were greatly distressed who trusted in the holy name of JESUS, whose light still appeared; and they mourned and wept for the candlesticks that were removed out of their places and for the golden walls that were taken from about them <HI>(b).</HI></P>
<P N="9">9 And there appeared an angel of the Highest, having in the right hand golden snuffers, and he passed through the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the mountain, and snuffed the candles that were dim, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the golden oil, running through the golden pipes, from the two golden olives that stand before the Lord on high, and he snake comfortably unto them, and told them, that it was for the cursed sodomy <HI>(a),</HI> and great forsaking the Lord their God, that they were thus judged; but he said, Fear ye not, although the ancient walls are removed from about this place, it is but that the wicked may have the reward of their works, and the land be cleansed from the pollutions thereof, for there is an hor∣rible rebellion in the land, and turning aside from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the righteous, provoking the Holy One by sin and transmission, and breaking the holy covenant of the most high God.</P>
<P N="10">10. Thus saith the Lord, I have turned my hand against this place for evil, and I will give the people over to the furnace of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and he that cometh forth, shall be as pure <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in treasure, more pure than the golden wedge of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="4" REF="010258_0004_0F7E246F94C03D98"/>
that cometh not forth, is he who despiseth my holy covenant, and I will forsake him, and give him over to the tormentor, and I will remove his candlestick out of its place, and there shall be dreadful weeping and gnashing of teeth, and there shall be a great overturning in the land, saith the Lord:</P>
<P N="11">11 For behold, as I have threatened them with famine, and to let the sword in upon them, and have scourged them in their borders for their wickedness, but they have refused to humble themselves, and have lift up the heel against me,</P>
<P N="12">12 And despised the meek appearance of the messengers of the holy covenant <HI>(a),</HI> they have made the wicked world their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, they worship it day and night, and when they gather in their most solemn assembly, behold, it is in their mind, cursing, swearing, drunkenness, whoring, theft, chambering and wan∣tonness, and all manner of abominations is in their borders; and yet, saith the Lord, they will afflict themselves with fast∣ing, and put up their prayers, saying, Lord, save us <HI>(b),</HI> whilst their hearts thirst after the blood of their enemies, whom I have suffered to come upon them <HI>(c).</HI></P>
<P N="13">13 But thus saith the Lord, I will accept of none of your prayers, your fastings or afflictions of body; but I will suffer to come upon you the waters of a mighty river, whose floods shall go over the banks of the land of <HI>Emanuel,</HI> the streams thereof shall overspread the whole land, and there shall be great af∣fliction, which shall not cease till sin and transgression be en∣tirely swept away.</P>
<P N="14">14 In this time many shall strive to flee to the strong tower, which is in the midst of the mountain, but none shall be able (<HI>a</HI>) except them whose candles remain burning, and whose light shines in their borders; they shall strive, and shall be able, and shall have the songs of salvation, and sing upon the banks of deliverance; they shall say, Not by our might, nor by our power, but by the Spirit of our God are we saved <HI>(b)</HI> from our enemies, whilst they who believed not, having heard, suffer for their sins.</P>
<P N="15">15 Then I looked, and behold, the wild boar of the forest continued to make war in the mountain, and slew many in her <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and took many captive, men, women and children; then the candlesticks which were of silver, of brass and of iron, and many dark candlesticks, rose up to resist him, and they fought against him, and smote him in his hinder parts, and wounded him a little, but they could not prevail against him; then they cried aloud against the golden candlesticks, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Our wives and children are taken captives, and our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by the sword of them that are no people, and you will not arise for our help; and power was given them to oppress the golden can candlesticks for a time. Then the golden candlesticks were silent, and greatly distressed for a season; then they arose,
<PB N="5" REF="010258_0005_0F7E2470572E0560"/>
and some of them went forth, and joined with the candlesticks of silver, brass and of iron, because of the oppression that was upon them.</P>
<P N="16">16 And they which remained, gathered themselves together upon the top of the mountain, and sat silent <HI>(a)</HI> for a time, be∣fore the great tower that was in the midst thereof, and many were pained in their hearts, and lifted up their voice to the great Lord of Sabaoth, because of the great distressing, and carrying away captive in the land.</P>
<P N="17">17 Nevertheless it pleased the Lord of Sabaoth to continue his judgments for a time, and a time. But as they continued crying and humbling themselves before him, imploring help of his sacred Majesty for themselves and the people, it pleased him in his infinite goodness <HI>(a)</HI> to command the boar of the forest to return from their border, and he chained him with strong chains <HI>(b),</HI> and put a hook in his jaw, and drew him back into the wilderness, and the mountain was at rest for a short season; but the walls thereof was not since <HI>(c)</HI> built, neither shall be for the days of many generations, saith the Lord.</P>
<P N="18">18 And about this time the candlesticks of sliver, of brass and of iron exercised authority over the golden candlesticks, and would have overthrown them, but they could not, by rea∣son of the tower, which was in the mountain, whereunto abi∣lity was given them to flee.</P>
<P N="19">19 And behold, the wind of heaven arose, and blew upon the mountain, and the waters of a great river came forth, and passed over the mountain, and there was a great earthquake, and after that a great furnace, whose burning was as the burn∣ing of lime, and the candlesticks of silver, of brass and of iron were cast into the furnace, and the fire thereof burned in them, and all they which came forth out of the furnace, were as pure gold; but they which came not out, were no more, but as fuel of fire, and many golden candlesticks were refined therein; and as I looked, there appeared candles in all of them which came out of the furnace, which were all of pure gold <HI>(a)</HI> set round with precious stones.</P>
<P N="20">20 And one of great power rent the heavens above, and came down, having in his right hand a live coal, which he had taken from the holy altar of the most high God, and he touched the candles therewith, and the light appeared; and I looked, and the waters of the great river assuaged, and there was a calm <HI>(a),</HI> and the golden candlesticks (which were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣fect men and women) went up to the top of the mountain, re∣joining; but the furnace remained in the mountain, that at any time, if any rust appeared on any, they might be refined there∣in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that came down from above, held golden snuffers in his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hand, that if any candles appeared <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, he might clip them, that their light might renew its strength; he also
<PB N="6" REF="010258_0006_0F7E247195E91D98"/>
had power over the two golden olives and their two pipes, and he commanded them, that they should pour forth of the golden oil into the golden candlesticks. I also saw the peaceable streams of Shiloh, descending upon the mountain, and they were as pure gold, clear as crystal <HI>(b);</HI> and he that held the golden snuffers, whose appearance was like unto the Son of God, calling unto them that stood upon the mountain, saying, Come and drink freely of this new wine of the kingdom of God; and they came and drank thereof, and sung praises unto him that lives for ever and ever, and honoured and worshipped him in the beauty of holiness <HI>(c);</HI> and he that called them, made a covenant with them, that they should be his people, and he would be their God.</P>
<P N="21">21 And said, There hath been in this mountain wars and bloodsheds, and many of my people have erred therein, and have strayed from the good Shepherd, who was meek and low in heart, and gave his life for the sheep, who, when he was reviled, reviled not again, but patiently suffered all things, that the will of the Father might be done; and so ought my people to have done, that my will might be done in them, and not have distrusted the power of the Highest, and made flesh their arm; nor gone forth in martial,—that is productive of sin, misery and bloodshed, for it is contrary to my will and the glo∣rious dispensation of the gospel <HI>(a)</HI> to mankind; whereby many have shone as lights in the world, which many in this land have rejected; not in this land only, but upon the face of the whole earth <HI>(b).</HI></P>
<P N="22">22 But it shall not be so in time to come; for, saith the Lord, I will establish peace upon all the earth: And it shall come to pass, that he that formeth any instrument of war, shall be ashamed thereof, and I will judge him at the last day. The roaring of cannon, and the beating of drums, shall not be heard, the glittering sword and all the instruments of war, shall cease, and the prophecy of my anointed shall come to pass; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, nor learn war any more, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it, and it shall surely come to pass, notwithstanding many nations and great kings <HI>(b)</HI> oppose its coming. Behold, saith the Lord, they are but as grasshoppers, and fade as the flower of the earth, and go to a dark house of silence, and are seen of men no more.—Therefore give ear, my people, unto my words, and incline your hearts to wisdom, and learn understanding, that ye may know the will of God, and do it, and you shall have peace from your enemies round about; and I will build about you the walls and bulwarks of my salvation; and you shall know the Lord your God have visited you for good, and have saved you from your enemies. Also, you were not able to save yourselves in time of trouble; and it shall be as long as you remain faith∣ful
<PB N="7" REF="010258_0007_0F7E24722DDDED98"/>
and keep my commandments, I will keep and preserve you and your generations; and you shall be as Mount Sion, that cannot be removed; but if at any time you or your sons or daughters, refuse or rebel, and I threaten you with my judg∣ments, to humble you, if you lift up the head against me and my rebukes, as your fathers, I will surely <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you off from the earth, and you shall have a name among men no more. <HI>(c)</HI></P>
<P N="23">23 And I will break down the walls which I have set about you, and they shall be no more for ever: For behold, I brought your Fathers from a land, wherein they were oppressed <HI>(a),</HI> and could not serve me freely, and I moved the heathen back, for their sakes; not by the power of the sword, nor by the strength of battle, but I myself rebuked them, saying, that they should not destroy mine anointed, nor do my people any harm; and I fed your fathers in the wilderness many days, and gave them strength to cultivate the land, and blessed their labours with success, and gave them corn in abundance, and good things, and they encreased in the land, and their generations were in prosperity, and waxed fat, and did not rightly esteem the rock of their salvation, but rebelled against me, and in the time of correction they kicked; nevertheless I did not impute their sins unto you, neither have I numbered them to their children, neither will I, but every man shall suffer for his own sin; and he called unto many, and taught them many excellent things, and commanded them to go forth, and publish this doctrine to all people, whithersoever he should send them; yea even the glad tidings of peace and salvation, to as many as believed on the name of him that sent them, and received his law, and obeyed it, promising to be with them henceforth and for ever.</P>
<P N="24">24 And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have shewed thee all these things, that thou mightest make them known unto the people of this land; for I am determined to do unto this land according to all that thou hast seen; therefore write all these things in a book, that if any will hear, and understand, and repent, and be converted, that I may heal them, and save them from the hour of temptation that is coming on all flesh.</P>

<HEAD>THE EXPLANATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1 THIS mountain is the Quaker profession, or yearly meet∣ing, in Pennsylvania.</P>
<P N="2">2 Shews the members, under the term of candlesticks, and those who were born sons. By candles, and those which shined bright, were such who bore a clear testimony against the idol discipline: They had not only oil in their lamps, but lighted also, and burning bright.</P>
<P N="3">3 As those in this verse, being covered, shews some, who, in their private opinion, were one with the bright ones; their lamps were also lighted, but kept under cover, for fear of the yearly meeting authority, and select party:—Whose com∣mittees, to deal with such who could not conform to discipline, were the clouds that carried those storms which darkened the light of the Spirit of God in almost all the members minds; and as some were overthrown, it shews that some were over∣come by those storms, and their faith sailed in the light of Christ, in their own hearts; and they put their trust in, and depended upon the wall for security, which was discipline; being built of, or composed of such laws and rules as was truly the inward law of God's own Spirit; that is, where men truly, by the dictates of God's own Spirit, made conscience of things, and according as they walked, as to outward actions, by the leading of that Spirit;—this was collected into writing, and made into a law of discipline; thus was this idol, or wall, in which they trusted, made of precious stones.</P>
<P N="4">4 But this company, from another country, shews the natural man acting, exactly in all outward appearance, to this law, while yet strangers to the work of conversion; following the di∣rection of this discipline and orders, sense, judgments and ap∣pointments of the meetings of business, which is <HI>ignus fatus,</HI> for every man and woman that ever acted in any service of a religious nature, by virtue of their appointment from a meet∣ing, so far as that appointment was their warrant, or motive of inducement, so far they followed <HI>ignus fatus,</HI> whose prime leader to all the inferior meetings, is the authority of the yearly meeting. This authority is the scarlet coloured beast; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> scarlet is the kingly colour here in the kingdom of England; and it is to signify, that it has a shew of kingly or royal au∣thority: And as in its very nature it oppresses, which begets defence, so oppression and defence is its proper name. (That its very nature is to oppress, will be shewn at large in a work now preparing for the press, wherein the mystery of <HI>Babylon</HI> will
<PB N="9" REF="010258_0009_0F7E24735276F978"/>
be fully shewn and demonstrated to be most compleat in the Quakers.) The natural man, thus acting according to the very exact copy of the living world, while yet entire strangers to it, deceived those who had once known it, and were darkened again by this great outward shew; so that they went forth from the true living word of God, in their own heart, which was going out of the very profession: Omitting justice and judg∣ment, is also breaking over the rule, because this is the end and design; and breaking over the very wall, whole very first foundation was laid by the first Quakers, not to stir or act but in God's power only; but instead thereof, their eyes are turned to the leader of this multitude, namely, the orders and autho∣rity of the yearly meeting; him they honour, and in that they trust, and also rejoice; yea, also say, that we will do valiantly, for our God is with us. It is high time to rise against the mighty, (has been a common saying in meetings of business, by the select party) meaning such who call the authority of the body of friends in question, and the authority of the yearly meeting. Let the discipline be put in practice, and compare this with the latter part of this verse; as also, the yearly col∣lections to print epistles, with private gifts to traveling friends, who are valiant for this cause; observe also by the way, that though, as hinted in (3), those committees were the very clouds, set to work by this authority, which carried or occa∣sioned all contention, tempests and storms, or strife; yet they themselves assigned the cause to an opposite spirit.—Having set the reader on the tract or true sent of the meaning of this vision, shall now but just give a hint of matters in short, in order to lessen the bulk of the book.</P>
<P N="5">5 <HI>(a)</HI> Such who had known the truth, made war also <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those whose light shined to discover this false idol discipline but could not dim it. Witness that nine years ago the autho∣rity of the yearly meeting was scarce questioned; Quakers were startled, (as I remember <HI>J-n C-n</HI> said, I marveled at it) if any drop'd such an expression: And now it is become a fire side and table talk. Those tempests here relate to the discourage∣ments thrown in the way, as calling us heathens, ranters, se∣paratists; and the works (or use made of them) of <HI>Barclay's</HI> Anarchy, <HI>Ellwood</HI>'s works, and others, on or touching this point, who had once known the truth. This proves a hard labour, even if it were possible to deceive the very elect; yet a number has witnessed all this, not so much as able to dim the light for they laboured diligently, and found the pearl of great price, that is, appealed only to the witness of truth in their own hearts; this is the tower against the most plausible out∣ward appearance.</P>
<P N="6">6 <HI>(a)</HI> Meetings, conferences, &amp;c. <HI>(b),</HI> let us make a new rule of discipline; (now began the discipline to vary from being
<PB N="10" REF="010258_0010_0F7E247626218920"/>
a true copy of the living word) <HI>(c);</HI> discipline, with all its of∣ficers and amendments, said to be all done by the voice of God and his wisdom, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="7">7 <HI>(a)</HI> This one was the voice of truth in the sons of God, or sons of the free woman, that cried against this discipline, que∣ries, memorials, &amp;c. <HI>(b)</HI> The wall of this tower, being sure, alludes to the other as not sure: <HI>(c)</HI> This; shews, they trust to this discipline, as a things of their own strength; though of pure gold, and precious stones. <HI>(d)</HI> Forgot to set truth and honesty, and the spirit which trades it, above rule and order. <HI>(e)</HI> Let truth yet remain, under the name of the society.</P>
<P N="8">8 <HI>(a)</HI> This was quite obvious, for the serpent had twisted himself, and mixed to such with the truth, that it was difficult for the sons of God, to strike at this great order and authority, without giving encouragement to a libertine spirit. So when peoples eyes began to be opened, the libertine and vain broke loose, who were chained down by the remains of the power and function that went with the order and authority of such who had acted truly in God's power; for this power had in some mea∣sure remained till it was removed by a discovery of the cheat. <HI>(b)</HI> This wild boar assayed, in its fury, to overrun the pure power and word of life, as well as the false, which caused the widow and orphan to be distressed; that is, those who were motherless and fatherless, or forsaken of the yearly meeting, namely, the golden ones, who had cried against order and dis∣cipline <HI>(a),</HI> or the sin of <HI>Onan.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9 <HI>(b)</HI> This covenant is made between God and every con∣verted soul, where it covenants in the secret of its soul, to fol∣low the light and convictions of God's Spirit in his own heart, on penalty of his eternal wrath, and willingly covenants its being the day of God's power in the soul. And it is fitting to observe here, that God tries the soul, upon the conditions of its covenant, which sometimes will be to prohibit it from lawful things: And among Quakers, we find of late, they are tried with a breach of discipline, may be to rise in prayer, in pub∣lick, before they are received in unity, by the paper god; as <HI>E—b A—b,</HI> and others I could produce.</P>
<P N="10">10 This verse foresheweth a peculiar day of grace and light at hand; for though this day is to be desired, yet while the soul passes through the furnace, it is not pleasant, at the present, and this grievously torment the Pharisee spirit, (or select party) as our dictionaries explain the word.—Gnashing of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there will be, when they behold God's power, working in opposition to them, and their idol god: Then Jerusalem will be encom∣passed with armies, and Quaker Pharisees will be in the Jewish condition, when <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was taken, after Christ was put to death.</P>
<P N="11">11 This is spoke of outward famine and sword, even the dry
<PB N="11" REF="010258_0011_0F7E2476A0257A18"/>
unnatural seasons and Indian war; for as the kernel of a nut is enclosed with a rind, and then a shell, the nearer to the kernel, the more resembling the substance; even so this Indian war and outward society of Quakers, and contention and con∣troversies between them and other sects, is the rind or shell which enclosed the kernel of the vision; and has so near a resemblance, that them who dwell in the outward court, can form an imper∣fect explanation of it outwardly, also points towards the truth or kernel.</P>
<P N="12">12 <HI>(a)</HI> Those were not the select party, nor those who sat in the gallery seats, with their certificates and authority of meet∣ings, rich broadcloths and line white beavers. These have been far from that low, meek appearance of Jesus's true messengers, who ever yet have been rejected of men and the body of the church. <HI>(b)</HI> All affliction of body is fasting, as abstinence from converge, reading news papers, or other worldly matters <HI>(c);</HI> they thirst to kill the character of such who keep to truth, whereby their wickedness is uncovered, and honour and reputation of society stained.</P>
<P N="13">13 This river is the same enemy, suffered to come; not the boar nor sword, but is the voice of God, sent out in writing, as well as verbal testimonies, which will come out so thick, as to overflow and sweep away all tradition, sense and judgment of weighty friends (so called) out of mens minds, to serve the living God, and not idols, composed of a body of men and women.</P>
<P N="14">14 <HI>(a)</HI> Many who acted by discipline, shall strive to reconcile their past conduct to the light, but none shall be able but such as bore an open testimony against it; these shall now reap the fruit of their labour in this life, saying, No discipline, order, or yearly meeting advices has been of the least good service.</P>
<P N="15">15 Wild nature shew many by fornication, drunkenness, adul∣tery and unusual publick wickedness abounding; and the select party rose up, and fought against it with their discipline and preparations of war, and wounded it a little, and cried out to such, who they perceived a slackness in of attending their meet∣ings of business, to come forward, and join in the Lord's work, &amp;c. and power was given them to set at nought such as did not attend meetings of business, and join with the select party, but contended against the discipline, queries, &amp;c. those were set at nought, and contemn'd, as not concerned, to arise to help, but enemies to the work of God; and by this oppression and outside beauty of this order some who had known the truth, joined in this work of discipline.</P>
<P N="16">16 <HI>(a)</HI> Ceased opposing discipline, and cried for the abound∣ing wickedness in the society.</P>
<P N="17">17 <HI>(a)</HI> Not by help of discipline; <HI>(b)</HI> secret conviction and restraining grace; <HI>(c)</HI> this paragraph looks forward to the end,

and concludes the vision with the extirpation of yearly meeting bulwarks and discipline, as well as prophanity and wickedness out of the profession, perhaps a new society by a fair separation, or else conviction and reformation of the old.</P>
<P N="18">18 At the last looked forward, and concluded, so this looks back, and comes over the same a second time.</P>
<P N="19">19 <HI>(a)</HI> Pure gold signifies, entirely free from being in∣fluenced by yearly meetings orders for a rule of life, but from a fountain of their own.</P>
<P N="20">20 <HI>(a)</HI> This shews, that when the soul receives light from God, the exercising, refining workings of the mind, occasioned by the waters, or flowing testimonies of truth, and burning of God's word within the soul, this exercise is assuaged; that is, the effect of them in that soul, is accomplished, and not that they shall cease to be any more in others, <HI>(b)</HI> a clear perfect fountain, rising up in each soul free from tincture of education, tradition or filthy senses and judgment of yearly meetings, or contentious priest craft; <HI>(c)</HI> not in the beauty of order, and form appointed by church authority.</P>
<P N="21">21 <HI>(a)</HI> Outward rules and order, contrary to gospel cove∣nant, where the law shall be in the heart, and not a paper book: <HI>(b)</HI> Not only Quakers have made this outward discipline to go∣vern the church, but all professions on the whole earth.</P>
<P N="22">22 <HI>(a)</HI> Any article of faith, order or rule, as a term of church communion: <HI>(b)</HI> Societies, and founders of societies, and principal ruling active men in them; the whole of this verse sheweth, that that the notion or <HI>chimera</HI> of spiritual au∣thority, shall be so clearly discovered, that any such pretenders, to invent terms of church communion, or systems of divinity, will be laughed at or ashamed; and this being the very seed and root of church contention, which often set the magistracy or state on fire, nay mostly the cause: Therefore, the seed and root being thus destroyed, the whole weed of course must decay away; yet I am of the belief, that the sword will continue in the hand of the magistrate, as long as man remains to be born in a state of nature, <HI>(c)</HI> This signifies in case of such rebellion, the name Quaker shall become as odious to all good men, as the name Jesuit, is now near come to that pass.</P>
