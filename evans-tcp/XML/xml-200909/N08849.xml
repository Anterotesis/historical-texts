<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE natural increase of people upon the British continent of North-America is so great as to make it highly probable that in a few generations more a mighty Empire will be formed there.</P>
<P>The rise and progress of the several Colonies, of which this Empire will be constituted, will be subjects of entertain∣ment for speculative and ingenious minds in distant ages.</P>
<P>He who rescues from oblivion interest∣ing historical facts is beneficial to posterity as well as to his contemporaries, and the prospect thereof to a benevolent mind causes that employment to be agreeable and pleasant which otherwise would be irk∣some and painful.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="011300_0003_0F89726F7346CCF0"/>The papers of which this volume consists are intended to support and elucidate the principal facts related in the first part of the History of Massachusets-Bay, and may serve as an Appendix to it.</P>
<P>The author of that History was possessed of many other ancient and very curious original papers, which are irrecoverably lost by an unfortunate event, sufficiently known.</P>
<P>If this Collection shall be favourably received, another volume of Papers will probably be published, to serve as an Ap∣pendix to the second part of the same History.</P>

<PB N="27" REF="011300_0016_0F897279F2652B38"/>
<HEAD>Generall considerations for the plantation in New England, with an answer to several objections.</HEAD>
<P>FIRST, it will be a service to the church of great con∣sequence, to carry the gospell into those parts of the world, and to raise a bulwarke against the kingdom of Antichrist which the Jesuits labour to rear up in all places of the world.</P>
<P>Secondly, all other churches of Europe are brought to desolation, and it may be justly feared that the like judgment is coming upon us; and who knows but that God hath provided this place to be a refuge for many whom he meanes to save out of the general destruction.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the land growes weary of her inhabitants, so that man, which is the most precious of all creatures, is here more vile and base than the earth they tread upon; so as children, neighbours and friends, especially of the poore, are counted the greatest burdens which, if things were right, would be the highest earthly blessings.</P>
<P>Fouthly. Wee are growen to that excess and intem∣perance in all excess of riot as no meane estate almost will suffice to keep saile with his equals, and he that fayles in it must live in sorrow and contempt. Hence it comes to passe that all arts and trades are carried in that deceit∣ful manner and unrighteous course as it is almost impossible for a good upright man to maintayne his chardge and live comfortably in any of them.</P>
<P>Fifthly. The schools of learning and religion are so corrupted, as (besides the unsupportable chardge of this education) most children, (even the best wittiest and of fayerest hopes) are perverted, corrupted and utterly over powered by the multitude of evill examples and licentious governors of those seminaries.</P>
<P>Sixthly. The whole earth is the Lord's garden and hee hath given it to the sons of Adam to bee tilled and improved by them, why then should we stand starving
<PB N="28" REF="011300_0017_0F89727B7B74F280"/>
here for places of habitation (many men spending as much labour and cost to recover or keepe sometymes an acre or two of lands, as would procure him many hun∣dreds of acres, as good or better in another place) and in the meane tyme suffer whole countryes as profitable for the use of man, to lye waste without any improvement?</P>
<P>Seventhly. What can bee a better worke and more no∣ble and worthy a christian, than to helpe to raise and sup∣port a particular church while it is in its infancy, and to join our forces with such a company of faithfull peo∣ple, as by a tymely assistance may grow stronger and pros∣per, and for want of it may be put to great hazzard if not wholly ruined?</P>
<P>Eightly. If any such as are known to bee godly and live in wealth and prosperity here, shall forsake all this to joyn themselves with this church, and runne in hazard with them of hard and meane condition, it will be an ex∣ample of great use both for the removing of scandall and sinister and worldly respects, to give more lyfe to the faith of God's people in their prayers for the plantation and also to encourage others to joyne the more willingly in it.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="objections">
<HEAD>OBJECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>Object. 1. It will be a great wrong to our owne church and country to take away the best people; and we still lay it more open to the judgments feared.</P>
<P>Ans. 1st The number will be nothing in respect of those that are left. 2dly, Many that live to no use here, more than for their own private familyes may bee employ∣ed to a more common good in another place. 3dly, Such as are of good use here may yett be so employed as the church shall receive no losse. And since Christ's coming the church is to be conceived as universall without dis∣tinction of countryes, so as he that doth good in any one place serves the church in all places, in regard of the unitye. 4thly, It is the revealed will of God that the gos∣pell should be preached to all nations, and though we know not whether the Indians will receive it or not, yet
<PB N="29" REF="011300_0017_0F89727B7B74F280"/>
it is a good worke to observe God's will in offering it to them; for God shall have glory by it though they re∣fuse it.</P>
<P>Obj. 2. Wee have feared a judgment a long tyme, but yet we are safe; therefore it were better to stay till it come, and either we may flie then, or if we be overtaken in it wee may well be content to suffer with such a church as ours is.</P>
<P>Ans. It is likely that this consideration made the churches beyond the seas as the Palatinate and Rochel, &amp;c. to sit still at home, and not look out for shelter while they might have found it, but the wofull spectacle of their ruine may teach us more wisdome to avoid the plague while it is foreseene, and not to tarry as they did till it overtooke them. If they were now at their former liberty wee may be sure they would take other courses for their safety. And though most of them had miscarried in their escape, yet it had not been halfe so miserable to themselves, or scandalous to religion, as this desperate backsliding and abjuring the truth, which many of the antient professors among them, and the whole posterity that remayne are plunged into.</P>
<P>Obj. 3. Wee have here a fruitfull land with peace and plenty of all things.</P>
<P>Ans. Wee are like to have as good conditions there in tyme; but yet we must leave all this abundance, if it bee not taken from us. When we are in our graves, it will be all one whether we have lived in plenty or in penury, whether we have dyed in a bed of downe or lockes of straw. Onely this is the advantage of the meane condi∣tion, that it is a more freedom to dye. And the lesse comfort any have in the things of this world, the more liberty they have to lay up treasure in heaven.</P>
<P>Obj. 4. Wee may perish by the way or when wee come there, having hunger or the sword, &amp;c. and how uncom∣fortable will it be to see our wives and children and friends come to such miserie by our occasion?</P>
<P>Ans. Such objections favour too much of the flesh. Who

can secure himselfe or his from the like calamities here? If this course be warrantable, we may trust God's provi∣dence for these things. Either he will keepe those evils from us, or will dispose them for our good and enable us to beare them.</P>
<P>Obj. 5. But what warrant have we to take that land, which is and hath been of long tyme possessed of others the sons of Adam?</P>
<P>Ans. That which is common to all is proper to none. This savage people ruleth over many lands without title or property; for they inclose no ground, neither have they cattell to maintayne it, but remove their dwellings as they have occasion, or as they can prevail against their neighbours. And why may not christians have liberty to go and dwell amongst them in their waste lands and woods (leaving them such places as they have manured for their corne) as lawfully as Abraham did among the Sodo∣mites? For God hath given to the sons of men a two-fould right to the earth; there is a naturall right and a civil right. The first right was naturall when men held the earth in common, every man sowing and feeding where he pleased: Then, as men and cattell increased, they ap∣propriated some parcells of ground by enclosing and pe∣culiar manurance, and this in tyme got them a civil right. Such was the right which Ephron the Hittite had to the field of Machpelah, wherein Abraham could not bury a dead corpse without leave, though for the out parts of the countrey which lay common, he dwelt upon them and tooke the fruite of them at his pleasure. This appears also in Jacob and his sons, who fedd their flocks as bould∣ly in the Canaanites land, for he is said to be lord of the country; and at Dotham and all other places men ac∣counted nothing their owne, but that which they had ap∣propriated by their own industry, as appears plainly by Abimelech's servants, who in their own countrey did often contend with Isaac's servants about wells which they had digged; but never about the lands which they occupied. So likewise betweene Jacob and Laban; he would not
<PB N="31" REF="011300_0018_0F89727C7AB85940"/>
take a kidd of Laban's without speciall contract; but he makes no bargaine with him for the land where he fedd. And it is probable that if the countrey had not been as free for Jacob as for Laban, that covetuous wretch would have made his advantage of him, and have upbraided Jacob with it as he did with the rest. 2dly, There is more than enough for them and us. 3dly, God hath consumed the natives with a miraculous plague, whereby the greater part of the country is left voide of inhabitants. 4thly, We shall come in with good leave of the natives.</P>
<P>Obj. 6. We should send our young ones and such as can best be spared, and not of the best of our ministers and magistrates.</P>
<P>Ans. It is a great worke, and requires more skilfull ar∣tificers to lay the foundation of a new building, than to uphold and repayre one that is already built. If great things be attempted by weake instruments, the effects will be answerable.</P>
<P>Obj. 7. Wee see that those plantations that have been formerly made succeeded ill.</P>
<P>Ans. The fruit of any public designe is not to be dis∣cerned by the imediate success: it may appear in tyme, that they were all to good use. 2dly, There were great fundamental errours in others, which are like to be avoid∣ed in this: for 1st there mayne end and purpose was car∣nall and not religious. 2d, They aymed chiefly at profitt and not at the propagation of religion. 3d, They used too unfitt instruments, a multitude of rude and ungoverned persons, the very scums of the land. 4th, They did not stablish a right fourme of government.</P>

<P>Faithfully recorded according to the very truth, for the satisfaction of very many of my loving friends, who have earnestly requested to be truly notifyed in these things.</P>
<P>Written from New England July 24. 1629.</P>
<P>Any curious criticke that lookes for exactnes of phrases, or expert seaman that regards propriety of sea-termes, may be disappointed.</P>
<P>A true relation of the last voyage to New England, made the last summer, begun the 25th of April, being Satur∣day Anno Domini, 1629.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Company of New England, consisting of many worthy gentlemen in the citty of London, Dor∣cester, and other places, ayming at the glory of God, the propagation of the gospell of Christ, the con∣version of the Indians, and the enlargement of the King's Majesty's dominions in America, and being authorised by his royal letters patents for that end, at their very great costs and charges, furnished 5 ships to go to New England, for the further settling of the English plantation that they had already begun there.</P>
<P>The names of the 5 shipps were as followeth.</P>
<P>The first is called the Talbot, a good and strong ship of 300 tunnes, and 19 pieces of ordinance, and served with 30 mariners. This ship carried about an 100 planters, 6 goates, 5 great pieces of ordinance, with meale, oatemeale, pease, and all manner of munition and provision for the plantation for a twelve monthe.</P>
<P>The second the George, another strong ship also, about 300 tunnes, 20 pieces of ordinance, served with about 30
<PB N="33" REF="011300_0019_0F89727CF4046BE8"/>
mariners; her chiefe carriage were cattell, 12 mares, 30 kyne, and some goates: Also there gad in her 52 planters and other provision.</P>
<P>The third is called the Lyon's Whelpe, a neat and nim∣ble ship of 120 tunnes, 8 pieces of ordinance, carrying in her many mariners and about 40 planters, specially from Dorcester and other places thereabouts, with provision, and 4 goats.</P>
<P>The 4th is called the Four Sisters, as I heare, of about 300 tunns, which sayme ship carried many cattell, with passengers and provision.</P>
<P>The 5th is called the Mayflower, carrying passengers and provision.</P>
<P>Now amongst these 5 ships, the George having the special and urgent cause of hastening her passage, set sayle before the rest about the middle of April. And the Four Sisters and the Mayflower, being not thoroughly furnished, intended, as we heard, to set forth about 3 week after us: But we that were in the Talbot and the Lyon's Whelpe, being ready for our voyage, by the good hand of God's providence, hoysted our sayle from Graves-end on Saturday the 25th of April, about 7 o'clock in the morning. Hav∣ing but a faynt wynd we could not go farre that day, but at night we arrived against Leigh, which is 12 miles from Graves-end, and there we rested that night, and kept Sabbath the next day.</P>
<P>On Monday (the 27th) we sat forward and came to the flatts, a passage somewhat difficult by reason of the narrow∣nes of the channel and shallownes of the water; and going over this we were in some daunger: for the ship being heavy laden and drawing deepe water was sensibly felt of us all to strike 3 or 4 tymes on the ground: but the wind blowing somewhat strong we were carried swiftly on, and at last by God's blessing came safe to ancre at Gorin roade.</P>
<P>Tuesday (28th) we went a little further, and ancred over against Margret downe, staying for a wind for the Downes.</P>
<P>Wednesday (29th) we came safely through with much turning and tacking thorow the gullies into the Downes, and stayed that night.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="011300_0020_0F89727DB30F1F08"/>Thursday (30th) Fryday and Saturday (May 1st &amp; 2d) the wind blew hard from south west and caused our ship to daunce, and divers of our passengers and my wiffe spe∣cially were sea sicke. Here the King's ship called the Assurance, pressed 2 of our mariners. Here we saw ma∣ny porpuses playing in the sea, which they say is a signe of fowle weather.</P>
<P>(May 3.) Sabbath day, a windye day and could: We kept Sabbath staying still at the Downes.</P>
<P>Monday (4th) God sent us a fayre gale of winde, North N. East, whereby we came merrily from the Downes, and passing Dover we saw 6 or 7 saile of Dunkirkers wafting after us; but it seemed they saw our company was too strong for them, for then we had with us 3 or 4 ships that went for the Streights: So they returned backe from pursuing us any longer. But sayling with a good wind we went speedily, and at night came neere the Isle of Wight, but being darke, we durst not put into the channell, but put backe for sea-roome 4 houres, and then other 4 houres sayled backe agayne the same way.</P>
<P>Tuesday (5th) early in the morning we entered the channell, the wind being weake and calme, and passed by Portsmouth very slowly; but in the afternoone the wind quickened, and we were forced to ancre a little on this side Cowcastle, but the wind growing more favourable, we weighed and came to ancre againe, right against Cow∣castle, thinking to stay that night, the wind being very calme. Here I and my wiffe and my daughter Mary, and 2 maids, and some others with us, obtained of the master of the ship to go a shoare to refresh us, and to wash our linnens, and so we lay at Cowes that night. But the wind turning when we were absent, they hoysted sayle and left us there, and ancred 8 miles further, over against Yar∣mouth, about 8 of the clocke at night.</P>
<P>Wednesday (6th) betyme in the morning the shalope was sent from the ship to fetch us to Yarmouth; but the water proved rough and our women desired to be sett on shoare 3 miles short of Yarmouth, and so went on foote by land and lodged in Yarmouth that night.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="011300_0020_0F89727DB30F1F08"/>On Thursday and Fryday (7th &amp; 8th) there master Becher, allowed by the Company, gave me 40<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> to make our provision of what things we would for the voyage.</P>
<P>Saturday (9th) we went to board againe; and this day we had 2 other men pressed to serve the King's ship; but we got one agayne by intreaty.</P>
<P>The Sabbath next day (10th) we kept the ship, where I preached in the morning; and in the afternoone was in∣treated to preach at Yarmouth, where Mr. Meare and Captain Borley entertained us very kyndly, and earnestly desired to be satisfied of our safe arrivall in New England, and of the state of the country.</P>
<P>Monday morning (11th) blew a fayre wind from E.S.E. and the Lion's Whelpe having taken in all her provision for passengers, about 3 of the clocke in the afternoone we hoysed sayle for the Needles, and by God's guidance safely passed that narrow passage a little after 4 a clocke in the afternoone. And being entred into the sea, from the top of the mast, we discerned 4 sayle of ships lying southward from us. But night coming on we tooke in our long boate and shalope. And the next day (12th) we had a fayre gale of easterly wind that brought us towards night as farre as the Lizzard.</P>
<P>Wednesday (10th) the wind still houlding easterly, we came as farre as the land's end, in the utmost part of Cornwall, and so left our deare native soyle of England behind us; and sayling about 10 leagues further we passed the Iles of Scillic and launched the same day a great way into the maine ocean. And now my wiffe and other pas∣sengers began to feele the tossing waves of the westerne sea, and so were very sea sicke,</P>
<P>And this is to be noted, that all this while our passage hath beene upon the coast of England, so ought truly to be accounted the first day of our parting with Ould England.</P>
<P>Thursday (14th) the same easterly wind blew all day and night, and the next day (15th) so that some of the seamen thought we were come by this tyme 200 leagues from England, but toward night the wind was calme.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="011300_0021_0F89727E7555A408"/>Saturday (16th) we were be calmed all day. This day met us a little ship that came from Christopher islands.</P>
<P>Sabbath (17th) being the first Lord's day we held at sea was very calme, especially in the morning, but we were disturbed in our morning service by the appearance of a Biscayners ship, a man of warre, that made towards us, and manned out his boate to view us: But finding us too strong for him he durst not venture to assault us, but made off.</P>
<P>This day my two children Samuel and Mary began to be sicke of the small pocks and purples together, which was brought into the ship by one Mr. Browne who was sicke of the same at Graves-end, whom it pleased God to make the first occasion of bringing that contagious sicknes among us, wherewith many were after afflicted.</P>
<P>Monday (18th) calme still, the wind being N.W. blow∣ing a little towards evening, but contrary to our course.</P>
<P>Tuesday (19th) wind S. W. as little helpfull as the for∣mer and blowing very weake. This day the master of the ship, myselfe and another went aboard the Lion's Whelpe, where Mr. Gibs made us welcome with bountifull enter∣tainment. And this day towards night my daughter grew sicker, and many blew spots were seene upon her breast, which affrighted us. At the first we thought they had beene the plague tokens; but we found afterwards that it was only an high measure of the infection of the pocks, which were strucke agayne into the child, and so it was God's will the child dyed about 5 of the clocke at night, being the first in our ship that was buried in the bowells of the great Atlantic sea; which, as it was a griefe to us her parents and a terrrour to all the rest, as being the beginning of a contagious disease and mortality, so in the same judgment it pleased God to remember mercy in the child, in forcing it from a world of misery wherein other∣wise she had lived all her daies. For being about 4 years ould, a yeare since, we know not by what meanes, sweyed in the backe, so that it was broken and grew crooked, and the joynts of her hipps were loosed and her knees went crooked, pittiful to see. Since which she hath had a most
<PB N="37" REF="011300_0021_0F89727E7555A408"/>
lamentable payne in her belly, and would oft tymes cry out in the day and in her sleep also, my belly! which declared her extraordinary distemper. So that in respect of her we had cause to take her death as a blessing from the Lord to shorten her miserie.</P>
<P>Wednesday (20th) a wet morning, the wind was W.S.W. and in the afternoone N.W. by W. both being contrary to our course, which was to saile W.byS. Thus it pleased God to lay his hand upon us by sicknes and death and con∣trary winds; and stirred up some of us to make the motion of humbling ourselves under the hand of God by keeping a solemn day of fasting and prayer unto God, to beseech him to remove the continuance and further increase of these evills from us, which was willingly condescended unto as a duty very fitting and needful for our present state and condition.</P>
<P>Thursday (21st) there being two ministers in the ship, Mr. Smith and myselfe, we endeavoured, together with others, to consecrate the day as a solemn fasting and hu∣miliation to Almighty God, as a furtherance of our present worke. And it pleased God the ship was becalmed all day, so that we were freed from any encumbrance: And as sonne as we had done prayers, see and behold the goodnes of God, about 7 a clock at night the wind turned to N. E. and we had a fayre gale that night, as a manifest evidence of the Lord's hearing our prayers. I heard some of the mariners say, they thought this was the first sea-fast that ever was kept, and that they never heard of the like per∣fourmed at sea before.</P>
<P>Fryday (22d) the wind fayre, and east northerly, and for our purpose for New England. It did blow strongly and carried us on amayne with tossing waves, which did affright them that were not wonted to such sights.</P>
<P>Saturday (23d) the same wind blowing but more gently. Now we were comforted with the hope of my sonne Samuel's recovery of the small pockes.</P>
<P>(24th) The 2d Lord's day, an orderly wind and pros∣perous.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="011300_0022_0F89727F35365850"/>On Monday (25th) a fayre surme gale, the wind S.S.W.</P>
<P>Tuesday (26th) about 10 of the clocke in the morning, whilst we were at prayers a strong and sudden blast came from the north, that hoysed up the waves and tossed us more than ever before, and beld us all the day till toward night, and then abated by little and little till it was calme. This day Mr. Goffe's great dog fell overboard and could not be recovered.</P>
<P>Wednesday (27th) the wind still N. and calme in the morning, but about noone there arose a So. wind, which encreased more and more, so that it proved to us that are landmen a sore and terrible storme; for the wind blew mightily, the rayne fell vehemently, the sea roared and the waves tossed us horribly; besides it was fearefull darke and the mariners mait was afraid; and noyse on the other side with their running here and there, lowd crying one to another to pull at this and that rope. The waves powred themselves over the ship that the 2 boats were filled with water, that they were fayne to strike holes in the midst of them to let the water out. Yea by the violence of the waves the long boats roape which held it was broken, and it had like to have been washed overboard, had not the mariners with much payne and daunger recovered the same. But this lasted not many hours; after which it became a calmish day. All which while I lay close and warme in my cabine, but farre from having list to sleepe with Jonah; my thoughts were otherwise employed as the tyme and and place required. Then I saw the truth of the scrip∣ture Psal. 107. from the 23d to the 32d. And my feare at this tyme was the lesse, when I remembred what a loving friend of myne, a minister accustomed to sea stormes said to me that I might not be dismayed at such stormes, for they were ordinary at sea, and it seldome falls out that a ship perisheth at them if it have sea-roome. Which I the rather wryte that others as well as myselfe by the know∣ledge hereof may be encouraged and prepared against these ordinary sea-stormes.</P>
<P>Thursday (28th) So. wind; calme at night.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="011300_0022_0F89727F35365850"/>On Fryday (29th) a boistrous wind blowing crosse, but was allayed towards night with a showre of rayne.</P>
<P>Saturday (30th) So▪ wind, but fayre and quiett.</P>
<P>Sabbath day (31st) being the 3d Lord's day, fayre and calme; we saw abundance of grampus fishes, 2 or 3 yards long, and a body as bigg as an oxe.</P>
<P>Monday (June 1) the wind westerly and calme: But be∣sides our being stayed by contrary winds we begun to find the temperature of the ayre to alter and to become more soletry and subject to unwholsome foggs. For coming now to the height of the Westerne Ilands, some of our men fell sicke of the scurvie and others of the small pockes, which more and more increased: Yet thankes be to God none dyed of it but my owne child mentioned. And therefore, according to our great need, we appointed another fast for the next day.</P>
<P>Tuesday (2d) we solemnly celebrate another fast. The Lord that day heard us before we prayed and gave us an answer before we called; for early in the morning the wind turned full east, being as fitt a wind as could blow. And sitting at my study on the ship's poope I saw many bonny fishes and porpuses pursuing one another, and leap∣ing some of them a yard above the water. Also as we were at prayers under the hatch, some that were above saw a whale puffing up water not farre from the ship. Now my wiffe was pretty well recovered of her sea-sicknesse.</P>
<P>Wednesday (3d) a fayre day and fine gale of full East wind. This day myselfe and others saw a large round fish sayling by the ship's side, about a yard in length and roundeth every way. The mariners called it a sunne fish; it spreadeth out the sinnes like beames on every side 4 or 5.</P>
<P>Thursday and Fryday (4th &amp; 5th) the wind full E. we were carried with admiration on our journey. By this we were more than half way to New England. This day a fish very straunge to me, they call it a carvell; which came by the ship side, wafting along the top of the water. It appeared at the the first like a bubble above the water as bigg as a man's fist, but the fish itselfe is about the bignes
<PB N="40" REF="011300_0023_0F89727FF52210E8"/>
of a man's thum, so that the fish itselfe and the bubble re∣semble a ship with sayles, which therefore is called a carvell.</P>
<P>Saturday (6th) wind direct East still.</P>
<P N="7">(7th) The 4th Sabbath we kept at sea. The wind easterly till noone, and then it came full S. E. a strong gale that night and the next day (8th) till night. Tuesday (9th) the same wind held till 9 a clock in the morning; and then a great showre which lasted till about 7 at night, and then it was a very calme. There we sounded with a dipsea lyne above 100 fadome and found no bottom. This day we saw a fish called a turkle, a great and large shell fish, swimming above the water neere the ship.</P>
<P>Wednesday (10th) wind northerly, a fine gale but calmish in the afternoone.</P>
<P>Thursday (11th) the wind at N. an easye gale and fayre morning. We saw a mountayne of ice shining as white as snow like to a great rocke or clift on shoare, it stood still and therefore we thought it to be on ground and to reach the bottome of the sea. For though there came a mighty streame from the north yet it moved not, which made us sound, and we found a banke of 40 fathom deepe where∣upon we judged it to rest: and the height above was as much. We saw also 6 or 7 pieces of ice, floating on the sea, which was broken off from the former mountayne. We also saw great store of water fowle swimming by the shipp within musket shott, of a pyde colour and about the bigness of a wild duck, about 40 in a company. The mariners call them hag birds. Towards night came a fogge, that the Lions Whelp was lost till morning. And now we saw many bony fish porpuses and grampuses every day more and more.</P>
<P>Fryday (12th) Foggie and calmish, the wind northerly in the morning, but about noon it came S. E. a dainty loome gale which carried us 6 leagues a watch.</P>
<P>Saturday (13th) the same wind till night, and we saw great store of porpuses and grampuses.</P>
<P>The 5th sabbath, (14th) the same wind, towards noon it began to be foggie, and then it rained till night, we went 4 or 5 leagues a watch.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="011300_0023_0F89727FF52210E8"/>Monday (15th) a fayre day but foggie, the same wind blowing but with fresh gales carried us 7 leagues a watch. In the afternoon it blew harder, so the sea was rough, and we lost the sight of the Whelpe: it being foggie we drummed for them, and they shot of a great piece of or∣dinance, but we heared not one another.</P>
<P>Tuesday (16th) wind S. by E. foggie till about 10 a clocke. While we were at prayers it cleared up about an houre, and then we saw the Lion's Whelpe, distant about 2 leagues southward, we presently tackt about to meet her, and she did the same to meet us, but before we could get together a thick fogge came, that we were long in finding each other. This day we sounded divers tymes, and found ourselves on another banke, at first 40 fathom, after 36, after 33, after 24. We thought it to have been the bank over against Cape Sable, but we were deceived, for we knew not certainly where we were because of the fogge. After 3 or 4 hours company we lost the Lion's Whelpe agayne, and beate the drum and shot of a great piece of ordinance, and yet heard not of them. But perceiving the banke to grow still shallower we found it 27 and 24 fa∣thoms. Therefore, being a fogg, and fearing we were too neare land we tackt about for sea-roome for 2 or 3 watches, and steered southeast.</P>
<P>Wednesday (17th) very foggie still, and wind S. by W. and sounding found no bottome that we could reach.</P>
<P>Thursday (18th) wind full W. and contrary to us. This day a notorious wicked fellow that was given to swering and boasting of his former wickednes, bragged that he had got a wench with child before he came this voyage, and mocked at our daies of fast, railing and jesting against puritans, this fellow fell sick of the pockes and dyed. We sounded and found 38 fathom, and stayed, for a little while, to take some cod fish, and feasted ourselves merrily.</P>
<P>Fryday (19th) wind West still, a very fayre cleare day. About 4 a clock in the afternoone some went up to the top of the mast, and affirmed to our great comfort they saw land to the northeastward.</P>

<P>Sabbath (21st) being the 6th Lord's day; wind norther∣ly but fayre and calm.</P>
<P>Monday (22d) wind easterly, a fayre gale. This day we saw a great deal of froth not farre from us: we feared it might be some breach of water against some rockes, therefore the master of our ship hoisted out the shal∣lop and went with some of the men to see what it was; but found it onely to be a froath carried by the streame.</P>
<P>Tuesday (23d) the wind N. E. a fayre gale.</P>
<P>Wednesday (24th) wind N. E. a fayre day and cleare; about 9 a clocke in the morning we espied a shipp about 4 leagues behind us; which proved to be the Lions Whelpe, which had been a weeke seperated from us, we stoped for her company. This day a child of good man Clarke, which had a consumption before it came to shipp, died. This day we had all a cleare and comfortable sight of America, and of the Cape Sable that was over against us 7 or 8 leagues northward. Here we saw yellow gilliflowers on the sea.</P>
<P>Thursday (25th) wind still N. E. a full and fresh gale. In the afternoon we had a cleare sight of many islands and hills by the sea shoare. Now we saw abundance of mack∣rill, a great store of great whales puffing up water as they goe, some of them came neere our shipp: this creature did astonish us that saw them not before; their back appeared like a little island. At 5 a clocke at night the wind turned S. E. a fayre gale. This day we caught mackrill.</P>
<P>Fryday (26th) a foggie morning, but after cleare and wind calme. We saw many scools of mackrill, infinite multitudes on every side our ship. The sea was abun∣dantly stored with rockweed and yellow flowers like gilly∣flowers. By noon we were within 3 leagues of Capan, and as we sayled along the coasts we saw every hill and dale and every island full of gay woods and high trees. The nearer we came to the shoare the more flowers in abundance, sometymes scattered abroad, sometymes joyned
<PB N="43" REF="011300_0024_0F897280B8F9E448"/>
in sheets 9 or 10 yards long, which we supposed to be brought from the low meadowes by the tyde. Now what with fine woods and greene trees by land, and these yel∣low flowers paynting the sea, made us all desirous to see our new paradise of New England, whence we saw such forerunning signals of fertilitie afarre off. Coming neare the harbour towards night we takt about for sea-roome.</P>
<P>Saturday (27th) a foggie morning; but after 8 o'clocke in the morning very cleare, the wind being somewhat con∣trary at So. and by West, we tackt to and againe with get∣ting little; but with much adoe, about 4 o'clock in the afternoone, having with much payne compassed the har∣bour, and being ready to enter the same, see how things may suddenly change! there came a fearfull gust of wind and rayne and thunder and lightning, whereby we were borne with no little terrour and trouble to our mariners, having very much adoe to loose downe the sayles when the fury of the storme held up. But God be praised it lasted but a while and soone abated agayne, And hereby the Lord shewed us what he could have done with us, if it had pleased him. But blessed be God, he soone removed this storme and it was a fayre and sweet evening.</P>
<P>We had a westerly wind which brought us between 5 and 6 o'clock to a fyne and sweet harbour, 7 miles from the head point of Capan. This harbour 20 ships may easily ryde therein, where there was an island whither four of our men with a boate went, and brought backe agayne ripe strawberries and gooseberries, and sweet single roses. Thus God was merciful to us in giving us a tast and smell of the sweet fruit as an earnest of his bountiful goodnes to welcome us at our first arrivall. This harbour was two leagues and something more from the harbour at Naim∣kecke, where our ships were to rest, and the plantation is already begun. But because the passage is difficult and night drew on, we put into Capan habour.</P>
<P N="28">(28th) The Sabbath, being the first we kept in Ame∣rica, and the 7th Lord's day after we parted with England.</P>
<P>Monday (29th) we came from Capan, to go to Naim∣kecke,
<PB N="44" REF="011300_0025_0F897281725B9A00"/>
the wind northerly. I should have tould you before that the planters spying our English colours the Governour sent a shalop with 2 men on Saturday to pilot us. These rested the Sabbath with us at Capan; and this day, by God's blessing and their directions, we passed the curious and difficult entrance into the large spacious harbour of Naimkecke. And as we passed along it was wonderful to behould so many islands replenished with thicke wood and high trees, and many fayre greene pastures. And being come into the harbour we saw the George to our great comfort then being come on Tuesday which was 7 daies before us. We rested that night with glad and thankful hearts that God had put an end to our long and tedious journey through the greatest sea in the world.</P>
<P>The next morning (30th) the governour came aboard to our ship, and bade us kindly welcome, and invited me and my wiffe to come on shoare, and take our lodging in his house, which we did accordingly,</P>
<P>Thus you have a faithful report collected from day to day of all the particulars that were worth noting in our passage.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="remarkable things">
<HEAD>NOW in our passage divers things are remarkeable.</HEAD>
<P>FIRST, through God's blessing our passage was short and speedy, for whereas we had 1000 leagues, that is 3000 miles English, to saile from Ould to New England, we performed the same in 6 weeks and 3 dayes.</P>
<P>Secondly, our passage was comfortable and easie for the most part, having ordinarily fayre and moderate wind, and being freed for the most part from stormie and rough seas, saving one night only, which we that were not used thought to be more terrible than indeed it was, and this was Wednesday at night May 27th.</P>
<P>Thirdly, our passage was also healthfull to our passen∣gers, being freed from the great contagion of the scurvie
<PB N="45" REF="011300_0025_0F897281725B9A00"/>
and other maledictions, which in other passages to other places had taken away the lives of many. And yet we were in all reason in wonderful danger all the way, our ship being greatly crowded with passengers; but through God's great goodness we had none that died of the pockes but that wicked fellow that scorned at fasting and prayer. There were indeed 2 little children, one of my owne and another beside; but I do not impute it meerely to the pas∣sage; for they were both very sickly children, and not likely to have lived long, if they had not gone to sea. And take this for a rule, if children be healthfull when they come to sea, the younger they are the better they will endure the sea, and are not troubled with sea-sicknes as older people are, as we had experience in many children that went this voyage. My wiffe indeed, in tossing wea∣ther, was something ill by vomiting, but in calme weather she recovered agayne, and is now much better for the sea sicknes. And for my owne part, whereas I have for di∣vers yeares past been very sickly and ready to cast up what∣soever I have eaten, and was very sicke at London and Gravesend, yet from the tyme I came on shipboard to this day, I have been straungely healthfull. And now I can digest our ship diett very well, which I could not when I was at land. And indeed in this regard I have great cause to give God praise, that he hath made my coming to be a method to cure me of a wonderful weake stomacke and continual payne of melancholly wynd from the splene: Also divers children were sicke of the small pockes, but are safely recovered agayne, and 2 or 3 passengers towards the latter end of the voyage fell sicke of the scurvie, but coming to land recovered in a short tyme.</P>
<P>Fourthly, our passage was both pleasurable and profi∣table. For we received instruction and delight in behould∣ing the wonders of the Lord in the deepe waters, and sometimes seeing the sea round us appearing with a terrible countenance, and as it were full of high hills and deepe vallyes; and sometimes it appeared as a most plain and even meadow. And ever and anon we saw divers kynds of
<PB N="46" REF="011300_0026_0F89728301D0FF10"/>
fishes sporting in the great waters, great grampuses and huge whales going by companies and puffing up water-streames. Those that love their owne chimney corner, and dare not go farre beyond their owne townes end shall neever have the honour to see these wonderfull workes of Almighty God.</P>
<P>Fifthly, we had a pious and christian-like passage; for I suppose passengers shall seldom find a company of more religious, honest and kynd seamen than we had. We con∣stantly served God morning and evening by reading and expounding a chapter, singing, and prayer. And the Sab∣bath was solemnely kept by adding to the former, preach∣ing twise and catechising. And in our great need we kept 2 solemne fasts, and found a gracious effect. Let all that love and use fasting and praying take notise that it is as prevaileable by sea as by land, wheresoever it is faithfully performed. Besides the ship master and his company used every night to sett their 8 and 12 a clocke watches with singing a psalme and prayer that was not read out of a booke. This I wryte not for boasting and flattery; but for the benefit of those that have a mynd to come to New England hereafter, that if they looke for and desyre to have as prosperous a voyage as we had, they may use the same meanes to attayne the same. So letting passe our passage by sea, we will now bring our discourse to land on the shoare of New England, and I shall by God's assistance endeavour to speake nothing but the naked truth, and both acquaint you with the commodities and discommodities of the country.</P>

<P>NOW for the present condition of the plantation what it is. When we came first to Naimkecke, now called Salem, we found about half a score houses built: and a fayre
<PB N="47" REF="011300_0026_0F89728301D0FF10"/>
house newly built for the governour, and we found also abundance of corne planted by them, excellent good and well liking. We brought with us about 200 passengers and planters more, which now by common consent of all the ould planters are all now combyned together into one body politique under the same governor. There are with us in all ould and new planters 300, whereof 200 are set∣tled at Naimkecke, now called Salem, and the rest plant themselves at Massachusets bay, being to build a towne there called Charleston or Charlestowne; we that are set∣tled at Salem make what haste we can to build, so that within a short tyme we shall have a fayre towne. We have great ordnance whereof we doubt not but to fortifye ourselves in short tyme, to keepe out a potent adversarye. But that which is our greatest comfort and means of de∣fence above all others, is, that we have here the true re∣ligion and holy ordinances of almighty God amongst us. Thanks be to God we have plenty of preaching and dili∣gent catechising, with strict and carefull exercise of good and commendable orders to bring our people to christian conversation, which whilst we do we doubt not but God will be with us, and so Rom. 8.31. what shall we then say to these things. If God be with us who can be against us?</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="excerpts from letter">
<HEAD>Some brief collections out of a letter that Mr. Higginson sent to his friends at Leicester.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are certainly expected here the next spring the coming of 60 familyes out of Dorcettershire, who have by letters signified so much to the Governour to desyre him to appoint them places of habitations; they bringing their ministers with them. Also many families are expected out of Lincolnshire and a minister with them, and a great company of godly christians out of London. Such of you as come from Leister, I would counsell you to come quickly, and that for two reasons. 1st, if you lin∣ger too long, the passages of Jordan through the malice of
<PB N="48" REF="011300_0027_0F897284137FF180"/>
Sathan may be stopped; that you can not come if you would. 2dly, Those that come first speed best here, and have the priviledge of choosing choise places of habita∣tions. Little children of 5 years ould may by setting corne one month be able to get their owne maintenance abun∣dantly. Oh what a good worke might you that are rich do for your poore brethren, to helpe them with your purses onely to convey them hither with their children and families, where they may live as well both for soule and body as any where in the the world. Besides they will recompense the cost by helping to build houses and plant your ground for a tyme; which shall be difficult worke at the first, except you have the helpe of many hands. Mr. Johnson out of Lincolnshire and many others have helped our godly christians hither, to be employed in their worke for a while, and then to live of them∣selves. We have here about 40 goats that give milke, and as many milch kyne; we have 6 or 7 mares and an horse, and do every day expect the coming of half a score mares more, and 30 kyne by two shipps that are to follow us. They that come let them bring mares, kyne and sheepe as many as they can: Ireland is the best place to provide sheepe, and lyes in the way. Bring none that are in lambe, nor mares in foale; for they are in more dan∣ger to perish at sea. Of all trades carpenters are most needful, therefore bring as many as you can. It were a wise course for those that are of abilityes to joyne toge∣ther and buy a shipp for the voyage and other merchan∣dize. For the governor would that any man may em∣ploy his stocke in what merchandises he please, excepting onely beaver skins, which the company of merchants re∣serve to themselves and the managing of the publique stocke. If any be of the mynde to buy a shipp, my cou∣sin Nowells counsell would be good. Also one Mr. — a very godly man and the master of the ship we went in, and likewise one Mr. Graves the master's maite, dwelling in Wapping, may herein staund you in steed. The payment of the transportation of things is wondrous

deare, as 5<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a man, and 10<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a horse, and commonly 3<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> for every tunne of goodes: So that a little more then will pay for the passage will purchase the possession of a ship for all together.</P>
<P>No man hath or can have a house built for him here unlesse he comes himselfe, or else sends seruants before to do it for him. It was an errour that I now perceive both in myselfe, and others did conceive by not rightly under∣standing the merchaunts meaning. For we thought that all that put in their money into the common stocke should have a house built for them, besides such a portion of land; but it was not so. They shall indeed have so much land allotted to them when they come to take possession of it and make use of it, but if they will have houses they must build them. Indeed we that are ministers, and all the rest that were entertained and sent over and maintained by the rest of the company, as their servants, for such a tyme in such employments, all such are to have houses built them of the companies charge and no others nor otherwise. They that put money into the stocke, as they do a good worke to helpe forwards so worthy a plantation, so all the gayne they are like to have, is according to the increase of the stocke at 3 yeares end, by the trade of beaver, besides the lands which they shall enjoy when they will.</P>
<P>All that come must have victualls with them for a twelve month, I meane they must have meale, oatmeale and such like sustenaunce of food, till they can gett increase of corne by their owne labour. For, otherwise, so many may come without provision at the first, as that our small beginnings may not be sufficient to maintayne them.</P>
<P>Before you come be carefull to be strongly instructed what things are fittest to bring with you for your more comfortable passage at sea, as also for your husbandrey oc∣casions when you come to the land. For when you are once parted with England you shall meete neither with taverns nor alehouse, nor butchers, nor grosers, nor apo∣thecaries shops to helpe what things you need, in the midst of the great ocean, nor when you are come to land, here
<PB N="50" REF="011300_0028_0F897284724E5778"/>
are yet neither markets nor fayres to buy what you want. Therefore be sure to furnish yourselves with things fitting to be had before you come; as meale for bread, malt for drinke, woollen and linnen cloath, and leather for shoes, and all manner of carpenters tooles, and a good deale of iron and steele to make nailes, and lockes for houses and furniture for ploughs and carts, and glasse for windowes, and many other things which were better for you to think of them there than to want them here.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Worshipful,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Did expect to have beene with you in person at the court, and to that end I put to sea yesterday and was driven back againe the wind being stiffe against us. And there being noe canoe or boate at Sagust I must have beene constrained to goe to Mistick and thence about to Charles town, which at that time I durst not be so bold, my bodie being at this present in an ill condition to wade or take cold, and therefore I desire you to pardon mee. Though otherwise I could much have desired it, by rea∣son of many occasions and businesses. There are at Mr. Hewsons plantation 5 or 6 kine verie ill and in great danger, I feare they will hardlie escape it whereof twoe are myne and all I have which are worse than any of the rest. I left myne there this winter to doe Mr. Skelton a pleasure to keepe his for him here at Salem that he might have the benefit of their milk. And I understand by
<PB N="51" REF="011300_0028_0F897284724E5778"/>
Wincoll that they have been ill tended and he saith almost starved. Besides they have fed on acornes and they cannot digest them for that they vomitt exceedinglie and are so bound in their bodies that he is faine to rake them and to use all his skill to maintaine life in them. I have willed him to be there till he can bring them to some strength againe if it be possible. And I have given him malt to make them mashes of licoris and annis seedes and long pepper and such other things as I had to drench them. I could wish when Manning hath recovered his strength that you would free him, for he will never doe you or Mr. Hewson service, for when he was well he was as negligent as the worst of them. Mr. Skelton, myselfe and the rest of the congregation desire to be thankfull to God and yourselfe for your benevolence to Mr. Haughtons child. The Lord restore it you. I prevailed with much adoe with Sir Richard for an old debt heere, which he thought was desperate, to contribute it, which, I hope I shall make good for the child. I think Mr. Skelton hath written, to you, whome he thinks stand most in neede of contribution of such provisions as you will be pleased to give amongst us of that which was sent over. The yeele potts you sent for are made, which I had in my boate, hoping to have brought them with mee. I caused him to make but two for the present, if you like them and his prices (for he worketh for himselfe) you shall have as many as you desire. He selleth them for 4 shillings a peece. Sir, I desired the rather to have beene at court because I heare I am much complayned on by goodman Dexter, for strikeing him. I acknowledge I was too rash in strikeing him, understanding since that it is not lawfull for a justice of peace to strike. But if you had seene the manner of his carriadge with such daring of mee with his armes on kembow, &amp;c. It would have provoked a very patient man. But I will write noe more of it but leave it till we speak before you face to face. Onely thus farre further that he hath given out if I had a purse he would make mee empty it, and if he cannot have justice heere he will doe wonders

in England, and if he cannot prevale there hee will trie it out with mee heere at blowes. Sir, I desire that you will take all into consideration. If it were lawfull to trie it at blowes and hee a fitt man for mee to deale with, you should not heare mee complaine, but I hope the Lord hath brought mee off from that course. I thought good fur∣ther to wryte what my judgment is for the dismissing of the court till corne be sett. It will hinder us that are farre off exceedingly, and not further you there. Mens labour are precious heere in corne setting tyme, the plan∣tations being yet so weak. I will be with you, the Lord assisting mee, as soone as conveniently I can. In the meane while I committ you to his protection and safeguard that never failes his children, and rest</P>

<P>WHEREAS his Majesty hath lately been informed of great distraction and much disorder in the planta∣tions in the parts of America called New-England, which if they be true, and suffered to run on, would tend to the dishonour of this kingdom, and utter ruine of the planta∣tion: for prevention whereof, and for the orderly setling of government, according to the intentions of those patents which have been granted by his Majesty and from his late royal father king James, it hath pleased his Majesty that the Lords and others of his most honorable Privy Council should take the same into consideration. Their Lordships in the first place thought fitt to make a committee of this Board to take examinations of the matters informed. Which committee having called divers of the principal adventurers in that plantation, and heard those that are complainants against them, most of the things informed being denied, and resting to be proved, by parties that must be called from that place, which required a long ex∣pence of time, and at present their Lordships finding, they were upon dispatch of men, victuals and merchandize for

<HEAD>Mr. Cotton's Letter, giving the Reasons of his and Mr. Hooker's Removal to New-England.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend and beloved brother in our blessed Savior,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT which you observe touchinge the wonderfull goodnesse of the Lord to my wife, and childe, in the midst of deepe dangers, I desire never to forgett it, but to walke (as the Lord shall be pleased to helpe me) accordinge to that abundant faithfullnesse of his to one so undeserving all my dayes. Helpe me with your faithfull prayers soe to doe: That as by the prayers of yourselfe, and other brethren, I acknowledge the former mercy to have beene graunted me, soe by the same, a faithfull and fruitfull use of it may be graunted likewise; otherwise I may say it with shame, I see a frame of spirit in my selfe ready to turne every grace of God into unprofitablenesse, yea and forgettfullnesse of the most high God, the God of
<PB N="55" REF="011300_0030_0F897285F48246A8"/>
my salvation: Howsoever God dealt otherwise with my cosigne Suckey, and which might give unto some whom it nearly concerned a seasonable advertisement, yet I am per∣swaded it was in much faithfulnesse to hir, that God took her away to prevent the disquietnesse and discouragement of her spirit, which the evills ensueinge, evills hasteninge upon the towne, would have brought upon hir: The Lord is wise and gracious, and knoweth how to deliver his, out of the houre of temptation; blessed for ever be his name in Christ.</P>
<P>The questions you demand, I had rather answer by word of mouth, than by letter, yet I will not refuse to give you account of my brother Hookers removall and mine owne, seinge you require a reason thereof from us both. We both of us concurre in a 3 fold ground of re∣moval. 1. God havinge shut a doore against both of us from ministringe to him and his people in our wonted con∣gregations, and calling us by a remnant of our people, and by others of this countrye to minister to them here, and opening a dore to us this way, who are we that we should strive against God and refuse to follow the concurrence of his ordinance and providence together, callinge us forth to minister here. If we may and ought to follow Gods callinge 3 hundred myles, why not 3 thousand? 2. Our Saviors war∣rant is in our case, that when we are distressed in our course in one country (nequid dicam gravius) we should flee to another. To choose rather to bear witnes to the truth by imprisonment than by banishment, is indeede sometimes Gods way, but not in case men have ability of body and op∣portunity to remove, and no necessary engagement for to stay. Whilst Peter was young he might gird himselfe and goe wither he would, Joh. 21.8. but when he was old and unfitt for traveyle, then indeed God called him rather to suffer himselfe to be girt of others, and led along to prison, and to death. Nevertheles in this point I conferred with the chefe of our people, and offered them to beare witnes to the truth I had preached, and practised amongst them
<PB N="56" REF="011300_0031_0F897286B3F1B2F0"/>
even unto bonds, if they conceived it might be any confir∣mation to their fayth and patience; but they diswaded me that course, as thinking it better for themselves, and for me, and for the church of God, to withdraw my selfe from the present storme, and to minister in this country to such of their towne as they had sent before hither, and such others as were willinge to goe alonge with me, or to follow after me; the most of the <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> choosing rather to dwell in the [obliterated]
there. What service my selfe, and brother Hooker might doe to our people or other bretheren in prison (especially in close prison which was feared) I suppose we both of us (by Gods helpe) doe the same, and much more, and with more freedom from hence, as occasion is offered: Besides all our other service to the people here, which yett is enough, and more than enough to fill both our handes, yea and the hands of many brethren more, such as your selfe, should God be pleased to make way for your comfortable passage to us. To have tarryed in England for the end you mention, to appear in defence of that cause for which we were questioned, had been (as we conceyve it in our case) to limitt witnesse-bearing to the cause (which may be done more ways than one) to one onely way, and that such a way as we doe not see God callinge us unto. Did not Paul beare witnesse against the Levitical ceremonyes, and yett choose rather to depart quickly out of Hierusalem, because the most of the Jews would not receyve his testimony concerninge Christ in that question (Acts 22.18.) than to stay at Hierusalem to bear witnesse to that cause unto prison and death? Not that we came hither to strive against ceremonyes (or to fight against shadowes) there is noe neede of our further labor in that course; our people here desire to worship God in spirit and in truth, and our people left in England know as well the groundes and reasons of our suffering against these things, as our sufferings themselves, which we beseech the Lord to accept and blesse, in our blessed Savior. How
<PB N="57" REF="011300_0031_0F897286B3F1B2F0"/>
farre our testimony there hath prevayled with any others, to search more seriouslye into the cause, we doe rather ob∣serve in thankfullnesse and silence, than speake of to the prejudice of our bretheren.</P>
<P N="3">3. It hath been noe small inducement to us, to choose rather to remove hither, than to stay there, that we might enjoy the libertye, not of some ordinances of God, but of all, and all in purity. For though we blesse the Lord with you for the gracious meanes of salvation, which many of your congregations doe enjoy (whereof our owne soules have founde the blessinge, and which we desire may be for ever continued, and enlarged to you) yet seeing Christ hath instituted no ordinance in vayne (but all to the of∣ferringe of the body of Christ) and we know that our soules stand in neede of all to the uttmost, we durst not so farre be wanting to the grace of Christ, and to the ne∣cessity of our owne soules, as to sitt downe some where else, under the shadowe of some ordinances, when by two monthes travayle we might come to enjoy the libertie of all.</P>
<P>To your 2d question, how farre ministers are bound to beare wittnesse against corruptions cast upon the face of Gods ordinances, it is too large a point for me to give answer to in the heele of a letter. But thus much briefly, wittnes is to be borne against corruptions. 1. By keeping a mans owne garments cleane; I meane his owne outward practice. Rev. 16.15. 2. By declaringe the whole coun∣sell of God to his people, not shunninge any part of it, as reasonable occasion is offered, to prevent sinne in them. Acts 20.26.27. 3. By avoyding appearances of evill, as well as evill it selfe. 1 Thess. 5.22. Eleazerus durst not eate mutton, or bread, or any other cleane foode, when it had an appearance of eateing swines flesh, but chose death rather than deliverance by such meanes. 2 Maccab. cap. 6. ver. 21. to 25. whose story though it be apochry∣phall, yet the example authenticall, as being ratifyed by the apostles testimonie amongst the rest of like nature. Heb. 11.35. where by the others he speaketh of he meaneth not other women, but other men, for the word is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<PB N="58" REF="011300_0032_0F897287743A1248"/>
masculine. Howsoever, Peters dissemblinge is evidently blamed by Paul in a like case, when by his example he countenanced the imposinge of ceremonyes upon the Gen∣tiles, to whom God never gave them. Gal. 2.11. to 14.4. By contendinge for the truth in an holy manner, when others contend with us against it. Jude 3.4. By givinge account of our fayth before magistrates, if they call us to it publiquely, requireing to be informed of our doctrine and manner of life. 1 Pet. 3.15. Otherwise, if they call us to knowe our opinions in private (intending to bringe us into trouble) or publiquely, rather as captions questio∣nists than judiciall governors, in such a case, I suppose we may conceale our mindes, and put our adversaryes upon proofe, as our Savior did, John 18.19, 20, 21. But why doe I spend time and wordes to you in these thinges, who know them as well as I can tell you, I rather desire you may be kept in a peaeable way of bearinge wittnesse to the truth (if the will of God be such) than exposed to hazards by such confessions as mighte prejudice your liberty. My poore requests are to heaven for you, as I desire you might not forgett me and mine, and all us here. Now the God of peace and power guide and support your spirit, in all your holy endeavours, blesse and prosper your labors, and keepe you as a chosen vessell in the shadowe of his hande, through him that hath loved us.</P>

<HEAD>Libertye and the Weale Publick reconciled: In a briefe and cleare declaration of the mis∣apprehension of some grieved mindes concern∣inge the lawfull and orderly proceedings of the late Court of Elections at Newtown, the 17th of the 3d month, 1637.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Massachusets History Vol. I p. 61.</NOTE></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The complaint is, that the peoples libertye was restrained, by such as withstood the reading of a petition ten∣dered before the elections made.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOR clearing hereof it is to be considered, 1. What the libertye is which they desire to have preserved: That I take to be this, viz. That the people may not be subjected to any lawe or power amonge themselves with∣out their consent; whatsoever is more than this, is neither lawfull nor durable, and instead of libertye may prove bondage or licentiousnesse.</P>
<P N="2">2. If this libertye be at any tyme restrayned by the people themselves, they are guilty of their owne harme; if any be.</P>
<P N="3">3. If such restraint be not redressed, upon any seasona∣ble opportunity, when lawfully it may, they can blame none so much as themselves.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the power of a popular state being unlimited in its owne nature, and being by free consent and wise
<PB N="64" REF="011300_0035_0F89728A79239FE0"/>
advise, brought into a methode; and so bounded, in order onely, not in power, it is more safe to be so continued and exercised (though with offence or perhaps damage to some particulars in some transient cases, the original power re∣maining still inviolate) than to be putt out of its settled course, upon every pretence, or occasion, of publick grie∣vance: seeing every deviation in the verye forme of any such government is allways attended with much trouble, and some danger.</P>
<P>Answ. If we examine the passages of the court, we shall see where the error was.</P>
<P>It is observable that the proper business of this court was matter of election, and it is also obviouse, that it hath obtained, by custom, the first place in that day (except ad∣mission of freemen) and where it was objected, that in the court 1635, the petition in Mr. Endecotts case, was heard and answered before election: It is not true: For I can shew by that which hath been faithfully kept of the pas∣sages of that court, among other, that all petitions were rejected till the elections were passed; and many can re∣member, that when that case was heard, Mr. Heynes sate governour, who had been elected that court.</P>
<P>It is objected againe, that the court might yet have heard the petition first, and seeing it was for the peoples libertye, why was it stopped? To this it may be answered, that it is true, they might, if they had so pleased: But first they would not, and their refusal was lawfull upon these reasons.</P>
<P N="1">1. It had been no point of wisdom to break order, without pressing necessity, or for some prevalent advantage, neither of which could the court then apprehend.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the question was, whether petition or election should be first, 1 one could give answer there, but the court it selfe, which was the whole bodye of freemen (for none of the magistrates had any more influence in that court than any other freeman) so as here was no other way to knowe the minde of the court but by putting it to vote, and by numbering either side, to decide the question; this
<PB N="65" REF="011300_0035_0F89728A79239FE0"/>
was done, and the major part being for election, it may truely be sayde, that the people or the court did order that election should proceed before the petition should be heard: And now let any wise man judge, who hath done the people wronge, or what restraint hath been putt upon their liberty. For if the people would have had the peti∣tion first heard, who could have judged it, or what expo∣sition did any make against it, otherwise than is lawfull for any freeman to doe, by shewing his dislike and giving reason for it?</P>
<P>If it be objected, that a great parte of the people did not consent: I answer, there was not one freeman there but his consent was to it: for it is an insepparable inci∣dent to all bodyes politick, which are composed of volun∣tary members, that every one (in his admission) gives an implicite consent to whatsoever the maior parte shall establishe, not being against religion or the weale publick, and this they are further bound unto by their oathe: yea if the oath be disputable, yet their consent is in it, till it be cleared, and the error of the maior part convinced by plain arguments: otherwise no such societye would long sub∣sist: neither could peace be at all preserved in it; for it is hardly possible, to establishe any thinge (except of indiffe∣rent nature) that shall please every man: and if one or more in any society may be at libertye, when the rest are restrayned, it can neither be equal nor safe.</P>
<P N="3">3. It had been meere injustice, for the people then assembled to have concluded any publick businesse by po∣pular vote. The reason is apparent. Because those towns, which by lawful order, upon publick considerations, sent their proxies for elections, and their deputyes for other affaires, had been iniuriously surprized, and deprived of their due interest to discerne of those things, which did no less concerne them than the rest who were present. And upon this grounde, whatsoever the freemen then present had concluded had been meerely voide and no man bound to submit to it: for, besides the manifest iniurye to such as had been so unduly kept awaye, it might have fallen out,
<PB N="66" REF="011300_0036_0F89728B75195E58"/>
that, beinge present, they might have given such reasons as might have altered the judgment of the rest of the court.</P>
<P N="4">4. If the petition had contained any matter of grievance which had necessarily required the helpe of the people to redresse it (as in some cases it may fall out) yet why this might not as well have been done after the election as be∣fore doth not appeare: for the people must have stayed as long tyme, for dispatch of bothe, whichsoever had first been handled, petitions or elections: And if they had unadvisedly elected any unworthy person, they might soone have removed him: and the just disgrace upon such an one had more than recompenced the short tyme it would have required.</P>
<P N="5">5. So the generall court at Boston, in the 3. mo. 1634, when the people established a reformation of such things as they judged to be amisse in the government, they then settled an order, that in the court of elections they should leeve their deputyes to manage all other affaires.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is verye difficult and dangerous for so great a people and of so different apprehensions, to give judg∣ment in a cause of right or wronge, being suddainly dis∣covered to them: and if we should growe to such a mul∣titude as (through Gods blessing) we may soone be, it will be impossible it should be well carried.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is easye to judge, that 30 or 40 distinct men, chosen out of all the countrye, and by all reason as free from partialitye or preiudice as any other, may give a more just sentence in any such cause (upon deliberation and quiet discourse) than a whole multitude upon the suddaine, when many may be thought not to heare what is proposed, and others not to understand it, and perchance the greater part in a heate and tumult, and when the weakest and worst member of the common-wealth adds as much weight to the sentence as the most godly and judicious.</P>
<P N="8">8. The people (in the said court 1634) having (by searious advice of such as they best knew, and that seem∣ed to be much lovers of their libertye) given power to their deputyes, for future tyme, to doe whatsoever them∣selves
<PB N="67" REF="011300_0036_0F89728B75195E58"/>
might (save in matters of elections) order requires they should first referre the redresse of their grievances to their deputyes, and the people not to entermeddle, except the deputyes should first fayle, and that apparently and previously: which is seldom like to fall out in a popular state, where nothing but force can deprive them of their libertye, except they shall wittinglye and willinglye give them away, and then <HI>volunti non fit injuria,</HI> a man cannot blame another for the harme he does to himselfe.</P>

<HEAD>A Defence of an Order of Court made in the Year 1637.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Declaration of the Intent and Equitye of the Order made at the last Court, to this effect, that none should be received to inhabite within this Jurisdiction but such as should be allowed by some of the Magistrates.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Defence and the Replication are undoubtedly the Per∣formances of Mr. Winthrop. The Answer is by Mr. Vane, afterwards Sir H▪ Vane. I leave the Reader to judge who had the best cause and who best defended it. See <HI>Mass. Hist. Vol. I. p.</HI> 62.</NOTE></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOR clearing of such scruples as have arisen about this order, it is to be considered, first, what is the essentiall forme of a common weale or body politic such as this is, which I conceive to be this—The consent of a certaine companie of people, to cohabite together, under one go∣vernment for their mutual safety and welfare.</P>
<P>In this description all these things doe concurre to the well being of such a body, 1 Persons, 2 Place, 3 Consent, 4 Government or Order, 5 Wellfare.</P>
<P>It is clearely agreed, by all, that the care of safety and wellfare was the original cause or occasion of common weales and of many familyes subjecting themselves to rulers and laws; for no man hath lawfull power over ano∣ther, but by birth or consent, so likewise, by the law of proprietye, no man can have just interest in that which be∣longeth to another, without his consent.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="011300_0037_0F89728BF3A8C310"/>From the premises will arise these conclusions.</P>
<P N="1">1. No common weale can be founded but by free consent.</P>
<P N="2">2. The persons so incorporating have a public and re∣lative interest each in other, and in the place of their co∣habitation and goods, and laws, &amp;c. and in all the means of their wellfare so as none other can claime priviledge with them but by free consent.</P>
<P N="3">3. The nature of such an incorporation tyes every member thereof to seeke out and entertaine all means that may conduce to the wellfare of the bodye, and to keepe off whatsoever doth appeare to tend to theire damage.</P>
<P N="4">4. The wellfare of the whole is to be put to apparent hazard for the advantage of any particular members.</P>
<P>From these conclusions I thus reason.</P>
<P N="1">1. If we heere be a corporation established by free consent, if the place of our cohabitation be our owne, then no man hath right to come into us &amp;c. without our consent.</P>
<P N="2">2. If no man hath right to our lands, our government priviledges, &amp;c. but by our consent, then it is reason we should take notice of before we conferre any such upon them.</P>
<P N="3">3. If we are bound to keepe off whatsoever appears to tend to our ruine or damage, then may we lawfully refuse to receive such whose dispositions suite not with ours and whose society (we know) will be hurtfull to us, and there∣fore it is lawfull to take knowledge of all men before we receive them.</P>
<P N="4">4. The churches take liberty (as lawfully they may) to receive or reject at their discretion; yea particular towns make orders to the like effect; why then should the com∣mon weale be denied the like liberty and the whole more restrained than any parte?</P>
<P N="5">5. If it be sinne in us to deny some men place &amp;c. a∣mong us, then it is because of some right they have to this place &amp;c. for to deny a man that which he hath no right unto is neither sinne nor injury.</P>
<P N="6">6. If strangers have right to our houses or lands, &amp;c. then it is either of justice or of mercye; if of justice let them plead it, and we shall know what to answer: but if
<PB N="69" REF="011300_0037_0F89728BF3A8C310"/>
it be only in way of mercye, or by the rule of hospitality, &amp;c. then I answer 1st, A man is not a fit object of mercye except he be in miserye. 2d, We are not bound to exer∣cise mercye to others to the ruine of ourselves. 3d, There are few that stand in neede of mercye at theire first com∣ing hither. As for hospitality, that rule doth not bind fur∣ther than for some present occasion, not for continual re∣sidence.</P>
<P N="7">7. A family is a little common wealth, and a common wealth is a greate family. Now as a family is not bound to entertaine all comers, no not every good man (otherwise than by way of hospitality) no more is a common wealth.</P>
<P N="8">8. It is a generall received rule, <HI>turpius ejicitur quam non admittitur hospes,</HI> it is worse to receive a man whom we must cast out againe, than to denye him admittance.</P>
<P N="9">9. The rule of the Apostle, John 2.10. is, that such as come and bring not the true doctrine with them should not be received to house, and by the same reason not into the common weale.</P>
<P N="10">10. Seeing it must be granted that there may come such persons (suppose Jesuits, &amp;c.) which by consent of all ought to be rejected, it will follow that this law (being only for notice to be taken of all that come to us, without which we cannot avoyd such as indeed are to be kept out) is no other but just and needfull, and if any should be rejected that ought to be received, that is not to be imputed to the law, but to those who are betrusted with the execution of it. And herein is to be considered, what the intent of the law is, and by consequence, by what rule they are to walke, who are betrusted with the keeping of it. The intent of the law is to preserve the wellfare of the body; and for this ende to have none received into any fellowship with it who are likely to disturbe the same, and this intent (I am sure) is lawful and good. Now then, if such to whom the keeping of this law is committed, be persuaded in theire judgments that such a man is likely to disturbe and hinder the publick weale, but some others who are not in the same trust, judge otherwise, yet they are to
<PB N="70" REF="011300_0038_0F89728CB2D0ED28"/>
follow theire owne judgments, rather then the judgments of others who are not alike interested: As in tryall of an offender by a jury; the twelve men are satisfied in their consciences, upon the evidence given, that the party de∣serves death: but there are 20 or 40 standers by, who conceive otherwise, yet is the jury bound to condemn him according to their owne consciences, and not to acquit him upon the different opinion of other men, except theire rea∣sons can convince them of the errour of theire consciences, and this is according to the rule of the Apostle, Rom. 14.5. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mynde.</P>
<P>If it be objected, that some prophane persons are received and others who are religious are rejected, I answer 1st, It is not knowne that any such thinge hath as yet fallen out. 2, Such a practice may be justifiable as the case may be, for younger persons (even prophane ones) may be of lesse danger to the common weale (and to the churches also) than some older persons, though professors of religion: for our Saviour Christ when he conversed with publicans, &amp;c. sayth that such were nearer the kingdom of heaven than the religious pharisees, and one that is of large parts and confirmed in some erronious way, is likely to doe more harme to church and common weale, and is of lesse hope to be reclaymed, then 10 prophane persons, who have not yet beene hardened, in the contempt of the meanes of grace.</P>
<P>Lastly, Whereas it is objected that by this law, we re∣ject good christians and so consequently Christ himselfe: I answer 1st, It is not knowne that any christian man hath beene rejected. 2, A man that is a true christian, may be denyed residence among us, in some cases, without reject∣ing Christ, as admitt a true christian should come over, and should maintaine community of goods, or that magis∣trates ought not to punish the breakers of the first table, or the members of churches for criminal offences: or that no man were bound to be subject to those lawes or magis∣trates to which they should not give an explicite consent, &amp;c. I hope no man will say, that not to receive such an one, were to reject Christ; for such opinions (though being
<PB N="71" REF="011300_0038_0F89728CB2D0ED28"/>
maintained in simple ignorance, they might stand with a state of grace yet) they may be so dangerous to the pub∣lick weale in many respects, as it would be our sinne and unfaithfullness to receive such among us, except it were for tryall of theire reformation, I would demand then in the case in question (for it is bootelesse curiosity to re∣frayne openesse in things publick) whereas it is sayd that this law was made of purpose to keepe away such as are of Mr Wheelwright his judgment (admitt it were so which yet I cannot confesse) where is the evill of it? If we conceive and finde by sadd experience that his opi∣nions are such, as by his own profession cannot stand with externall peace, may we not provide for our peace, by keeping of such as would strengthen him, and infect others with such dangerous tenets? and if we finde his opinions such as will cause divisions, and make people looke at their magistrates, ministers and brethren as enemies to Christ and Antichrists, &amp;c. were it not sinne and unfaithfullness in us, to receive more of those opinions, which we all∣ready finde the evill fruite of: Nay, why doe not those who now complayne joyne with us in keeping out of such, as well as formerly they did in expelling Mr. Williams for the like, though lesse dangerous? Where this change of theire judgments should arise I leave to themselves to examine, and I earnestly entreate them so to doe, and for this law let the equally mynded judge, what evill they finde in it, or in the practice of those who are betrusted with the execution of it.</P>

At the best it is but a descrip∣tion of a common-wealth at large, and not of such a com∣mon-wealth as this (as is said) which is not only christian but dependant upon the grante also of our Souveraigne; for so are the expresse words of that order of court to which the whole countrey was required to subscribe.</P>
<P>Now if you will define a christian common-wealth, there must be put in; such a consent as is according to God;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov 8.5. Isai. 6.7.</NOTE> a subjecting to such a government as is ac∣cording unto Christ. And if you will define a corporation, incorporated by vertue of the grante of our Souveraigne, it must be such a consent as the grante re∣quires and permitts and in that manner and forme as it prescribes, or else it will be defective. The common-wealth here described, may be a companye of Turkish pirates as well as Christian professors, unlesse the consent and go∣vernment be better limitted than it is in this definition; for sure it is, all Pagans and Infidels, even the Indians here amongst us, may come within this compasse. And is this such a body politicke as ours, as you say? God forbid. Our common-wealth we feare would be twise miserable, if Christ and the King should be shut out so. Reasons taken from the nature of a common-wealth, not founded upon Christ, nor by his Majestyes charters, must needs fall to
<PB N="73" REF="011300_0039_0F89728D79D22790"/>
the ground, and faile those that relye upon them. In the application of the description, and the conclusions inferred, all things are not currant, all things doe not agree con∣cerning the causes of common-wealths as is affirmed. There are 7 several opinions of this matter, which writers speak of, though this be not so material. Members of a common-wealth may not seeke out all meanes that may conduce to the wellfare of the body, but all lawful and due meanes, according to the charter they hold by, either from God or the King, or from both: Nor may they keepe out what∣soever doth appeare to tend to theire damage (for many things appeare which are not) but such, as upon right and evident grounds, doe so appeare, and are so in truth. Thus farre concerning that which hath beene touched may for the present suffice.</P>
<P>The second thinge is the reasons, which we shall sett downe and answer.</P>
<P>The first reason of the equity of the order is this, <Q>If we be a corporation established by free consent, if the place of our habitation be our owne, then no man hath right to come unto us without our consent.</Q></P>
<P>Ans. We do not know how we that stand a corporation, by vertue of the Kings charter, can thus argue; yet to avoyd dispute, suppose the antecedent should be granted, the con∣sequence doth not follow. This is all that can be inferred, that our consent regulated by the worde, and sutable to our patent ought to be required, not this vast and illimitted consent here spoken off, our consent is not our owne, when rightly limitted, 1 Cor. 6.19, 20. An unlawful dissent can hinder no man, though a lawful may.</P>
<P>The 2d reason runs thus,
<Q>If no man hath right to our lands, our government privilegdes, &amp;c. but by our consent, then it is reason we should take notice of men before we conferre any such upon them</Q></P>
<P>Answ. Besydes the doubtfulness of the truth of the supposition, the question here is changed; for so most states doe in takeing the names of such as come to dwell among them, but the question is whether the admitting or
<PB N="74" REF="011300_0040_0F89728E340590E0"/>
rejecting of persons should depend upon such unlimitted and unsafe a rule, as the will and descretion of men, sup∣pose magistrates or others not regulated.</P>
<P>The 3d reason is thus framed, <Q>If we are bound to keepe off whatsoever appeares to tende to our ruine and damage, then may we lawfully refuse to receive such whose dispositions suite not with ours, and whose societye we know will be hurtefull unto us, and therefor it is lawful to take knowledge of men before we doe receive them.</Q></P>
<P>Answ. This kinde of reasoning is very confused and fallacious, for the question here is not only changed, but there is this further deceite of wrapping up many questions in one, and besides if it were put into a right forme, the assumption would be false.</P>
<P>The question is not, as was said before, whether know∣ledge may not be taken of men, before they be received, nor whether magistrates may refuse such as suite not with their dispositions, or such whose societye they know will be hurteful to them; though the second of these is not, nor cannot be proved; but whether persons may be rejected, or admitted, upon the illimitted consent or dissent of ma∣gistrates. The assumption also would be false, for men are not to keepe off whatsoever appeares to tend to their ruine, but what really doth so; Eliah appeared to Ahab, and, no doubt, to his counsell of state, a troubler of the common-wealth, one that brought 3 yeares famine, enough to ruine the whole state: Yet the Jewish magistrates ought not to have rejected him and all those of his frame and judgment, because thus it appeared; for in truth Elijah was the horsemen of Israel and the chariots thereof. It appeared also to the chiefe priests and pharisees, that if our blessed Saviour were let alone, it would tend to their ruine, John 11.47, 48. and therefore used meanes to keep it off by rejecting Christ and his gospel, and yet we hope you will not say they were bound to doe so. Lastly, it appeares to the Natives heere (who by your definition are compleat common-wealths among themselves) that the
<PB N="75" REF="011300_0040_0F89728E340590E0"/>
cohabitation of the English with them tends to their utter ruine, yet we beleeve you will not say they may lawfully keepe us out upon that grounde, for our cohabitation with them may tend to theire conversion and so to theire eternal salvation, and then they should doe most despe∣rately and sinnefully. Let us then doe unto our brethren at least as we would desyre to be done unto by Barbari∣ans, which is not to be rejected, because we suite not with the disposition of theire Sechem, nor because, by our com∣ing, God takes them away and troubles them, and so, to theire appearance, we ruine them.</P>
<P>The 4th argument stands thus, <Q>The churches take libertye (as lawfully they may) to receive or rejecte at their discretion; yea particular townes make orders to such effect, why then should the commonwealth be denied the like libertye, and the whole more restrained than any part?</Q></P>
<P>Answ. Though the question be here concluded, yet it is farre from being soundly proved, yea, in trueth, we much wonder that any member of a church should be ignorant of the falseness of the ground worke upon which this conclusion is built; for should churches have this power, as you say they have, to receive or rejecte at their discretion, they would quickely grow corrupt enough. Churches have no libertye to receive or rejecte, at their discretions, but at the discretion of Christ, whatsoever is done in word or deed, in church or common-wealth, must be done in the name of the Lord Jesus. (Coll. 3.17.) Neither hath church nor common-wealth any other than ministeriall power from Christ (Eph. 5.23.) who is the head of the church, and the prince of the kings of the earth. (Rev. 1.5.) After that Cornelius and his companye had received the holy ghost, whereby the right which they had to the covenant was evidenced, it is not now left to the discretion of the church whether they would admitte them there∣unto or not. But can any man forbid them water faith Peter, he commanded them to be baptized. (Acts 10.47, 48.) There is the like reason of admission into churches,
<PB N="76" REF="011300_0041_0F89728EF40513E0"/>
when Christ opens a door to any theres none may take libertye to shut them out. In one word, there is no liber∣tye to be taken neither in church nor commonwealth but that which Christ gives and is according unto him, Gal. 5.1.</P>
<P>The 5th reason produced is, <Q>If it be sinne in us, to denye some men place amongst us, then it is because they have some right to our place.</Q></P>
<P>Answ. The question is heere againe changed, for it is not whether some may be denyed, but whether any or all such as the magistrates illimitted dissent shall rejecte. But besydes this, we say, that the kings christian subjects have right by his majesties pattent, to come over and plante in places not inhabited, for a double end, 1st, to enlarge his majesties dominions, 2dly, for the conversion of the Pagans. And since his majestie hath given them right for these ends, we may not denye them, unless they forfeite it, either by denyeing the land which they inhabite to be an enlarge∣ment of his majesties dominions, or becoming such dissolute and prophane persons as rather doe harden the Indians than be a meanes of their conversion, for by so doing we shall exceed the limitts of his majesties grante, and forfeite the priviledges, government and lands which we challenge to be our owne.</P>
<P>Moreover, we may not denye residence, to any of his majesties subjects without just grounds, except we will doe injury both to the king and his subjects, who have adven∣tured both theire estates and lives to enjoye those privi∣ledges and libertyes, which he hath granted them. Be∣sydes the law doth not only prohibite those whom the ma∣gistrates shall dislike to plante in those places uninhabited, though in an orderly manner, but to make their abode in friends houses, either given or sold, or hyred, which are lawful meanes of obtaineing right. Now if the kings majestie give me right, if title be procured by donation, purchase, farmeing, &amp;c. If now this state at theire plea∣sure, take this away and expell men from the same, what were this but to exercise robbery, and to vex the poore
<PB N="77" REF="011300_0041_0F89728EF40513E0"/>
and the needy, and oppresse the stranger wrongfully, a sinne forerunning desolation, (Ezek. 22.29.) and such an one as will more ruine the state by the execution thereof, than those persons (whom the law intend to expell) were the law abolished.</P>
<P>The 6th reason assigned is this,
<Q>If strangers have right to our houses or lands, &amp;c. then it is either of justice or mercye,</Q>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>Answ. The question still is changed, but in answer to this we say, such may the stranger be as have true right of cohabitation, and sojourning with us, as hath beene shewed, and that of justice, by his majesties pattent, for they are fellow subjects to one and the same prince, they are also of the same nation, and if they be christians they are in a farre nearer relation than all these, even fellow brethren, and coheires of all the blessings layd up for them in Christ Jesus, and in all these considerations have right of cohabitation and residence with us.</P>
<P>The 7th reason is this, <Q>A familye is a little common-wealth and a common-wealth is a great familye, now a familye is not bound to entertaine all comers, no not every good man, otherwise than by way of hospitalitye, no more is a common-wealth.</Q></P>
<P>Answ. Here againe the question is much changed, it should not have been proved that we are not bound to receive all comers nor all good men, but rather no comers at all, unlesse it be upon the unlimitted consent of the magistrates. Although it be true, that there is some proportion betweene a familye and a common-wealth, yet there is a great disparitye in this matter. A maister of a familye hath another kinde of right to his house and estate than this common-wealth hath to all the houses and lands within this patent. The maister of a familye may bequeath his whole estate to his wife and children, and so may not the body of this common-wealth to theires. The king will looke for some right, nor may we blame him, if he doe. Many are no members of the common-wealth, and yet have good right both to houses and lands here, many members of this state agree not to this law, but have
<PB N="78" REF="011300_0042_0F89728FB40BB718"/>
protested against it as sinnfull and unwholesome, and yet we hope the rest have not as good right to their houses goods and lands as the maister of the familye hath to his. If the state should take upon them such a right, I pray you consider whether it would not prove a greater wronge, even like to that of Labans toward Jacob, who told him that all were his, Gen. 31.43. It is to be feared such pleas of right will worke more trouble to this state, if they be noysed abroad, than the entertainment of those people against whom this law is made.</P>
<P>Eighthly it is thus reasoned, <Q>It is a generall rule, <HI>turpius ejicitur quam non admittitur hospes,</HI> it is worse to receive a man whom we must cast out, than to deny him admittance.</Q></P>
<P>Answ. Let any man resolve these words, and they will be farre from proveing the equitye, though they may per∣haps the intent of the courts order. The thinge which from hence is concluded will only amount to this. That it is worse for a common-wealth to receive a man whom they must cast out againe, than to deny him admittance. The reason is taken from humane authoritye, but what is this to the pointe in controversye, why should men thus argue, and their conclusions so farre from the marke, yet as we said perhaps this may shew the courts intent, for this intimation we have from hence, That the intent of the common-wealth is to cast out all such as have beene received in tymes past, who are of the same judgment with them, whom the magistrates will not admitt but cast out, though with a greate deale more dishonestye, for <HI>turpius ejicitur,</HI> &amp;c. which if it must be, the Lords will be done.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Vane's adherents were afterwards banished. See <HI>Mass. Hist. Vol. p.</HI> 75.</NOTE></P>
<P>Ninthly, it is thus further argued, <Q>The rule of the Apostle, John 2.10. is, that such as come and bring not the true doctrine with them should not be received to house, and by the same reason not into the com.wealth.</Q></P>
<P>The question is still wonderfully changed, for if the order now in question were but conformable to this rule of the Apostle none would oppose it, but the order is
<PB N="79" REF="011300_0042_0F89728FB40BB718"/>
therefore scrupelled, because it setts downe no rule for the magistrates to walke by in that admittance or rejection of such as come, but leaves it to their illimitted consent or dissent, nay such were the expressions of the same, in the court, who had a hand in this law, as cleares it to us that this law opposeth directly this rule; for such as doe bring the doctrine intended in the text, are the persons which are aymed at to be denyed residence, as sad experience also in the execution hath given us in parte to see already, and wee feare in the future will yet doe more.</P>
<P>The 10th and last reason is this in effect, <Q>Such may not come into the land as by the consent of all are to be re∣jected, and therefore it is lawful to take notice of them.</Q></P>
<P>We much marvaile that it should be so often said, the law is only for takeing notice, is it not plaine that such are to be fined who receive them whom the magistrates allow not? and cannot notice be taken of men without such a course as this? Why should any in higher place speake in open court—Let us have their money first?— What meanes the words immediately following which speake of rejecting and keeping out by vertue of this order, if it were only made to take notice of such? It would have done very well to have kept to the question, and not argue so farre distant from the purpose as this doth. What if some come into the land and are to be rejected, are any therefor to be rejected in an undue and sinnful way? In the enlargement of this reason the law is excused, if it be not rightly executed, and they which are to execute it are likewise defended, if they follow their judgments and con∣sciences. The law is excused because it hath a good intent, but good intents do not make a law or action good, what was intended the execution doth declare. Now is it suffi∣cient for those who are betrusted with the execution of this law to follow their perswasions, judgments, and consciences, except they be rightly ruled by the word of trueth? Paul was perswaded that he should doe those things which he did against Jesus of Nazareth, Acts 26.9. They which kill Gods children may thinke they doe God good service,
<PB N="80" REF="011300_0043_0F8972907214F028"/>
John 16.1. but in so doeing, neither the one nor the other are to be excused. It is not a full perswasion that makes a thinge lawfull from the rule Rom. 14.5. but a full per∣swasion upon good grounds. All the actions of christians must be according to the rule Christ gives them to walke by, Gal. 6.6.</P>
<P>Object. 1. Some prophane persons are received, and others who are religious are rejected. To which you an∣swer there is no such thing knowne to be done, and if it were it might be justified, because prophane persons may be lesse dangerous, than such as are religious, of large parts, confirmed in some erroneous way, our Saviour conversed with publicans, &amp;c. and sayd they were nearer the king∣dom of heaven than religious pharisees. This is the summe. As for the objection which is made, it is your owne; for any thing we know, we would not object in this manner. It is not the refusing of some religious persons against which we except, but against the libertye which is given by this law of rejecting those, that are truly and parti∣cularly religious, if the magistrates doe not like them, which is already put in practice, as farre as may be judged. If you deny any thing to be done, there are divers wit∣nesses will affirme the contrarye. If you say it be more dangerous to accept such than prophane persons you need not much confutation, such shall be blessings wheresoever they come, Gen. 12.2. they will not need to be bound to the peace or good behaviour as some that are admitted by authoritye by their blasphemous and quarrelling speeches. As for scribes and pharisees wee will not pleade for them, let them doe it who walke in their way; nor for such as are confirmed in any way of errour, though all such are not to be denyed cohabitation, but are to be pitied and reformed, Jude 22, 23. Ishmael shall dwell in the presence of his brethren, Gen. 16.12.</P>
<P>Object. 2. It is objected that by this law we reject good christians and so consequently Christ himselfe, and it is made of purpose to keepe away such as are of Mr. Wheel∣wrights judgment. To the former parte of this objection
<PB N="81" REF="011300_0043_0F8972907214F028"/>
you say, it is not knowne that any christian man hath been rejected, and that christians in some cases may be rejected, holding some pernicious errors. This is the substance.</P>
<P>To which we answer that diverse christians have been already rejected so farre, as they are not allowed to make any abode amongst us, but for a short limitted tyme, and by the law they may be rejected for ever. All the tyme such are rejected Christ is rejected, Luke 10.16. Acts 9.4. Suppose some christians may be refused and Christ not re∣fused (which is not yet proved) that is nothing to the law nor to the present execution of it. If you deale with such make it appear. To the latter parte of this objection you answer, that you cannot confesse that it is made against them of Mr. Wheelwights judgment, and if it were, where is the evil of it, seeing that the opinions are such as he pro∣fesseth cannot stand with external peace, and will cause divisions, and will make the people looke at their magi∣strates, ministers and brethren, as enemyes to Christ and antichristian, more dangerous than the opinion of Mr. Williams? We omitt divers words for brevityes sake and change not the matter. To this we replye, that though you cannot confesse it, yet it doth appeare by your examina∣tions of them you refuse, for present demanding of them whether they know him, and wishing of them to disclaime his doctrine, and excepting against them because they are allyed to them of the same judgment, as likewise by the courts proceeding against him, that there is some such thing; though indeed we would not make this objection, though some of the like kinde.</P>
<P>Now whereas you grante this by way of concession, and give reasons to justifie the same, they are either weak or greate mistakes. First you finde fault with his opinions, because he said they could not stand with externall peace. He affirmed indeed that the preaching of the gospell could not stand with externall peace, and doth not the word of God hold this forth? Our Saviour came not to send peace but a sword, Matth. 10.34. That chapter speakes fully to the purpose, and when news of Christ comes, Herod
<PB N="82" REF="011300_0044_0F897291F9E968B0"/>
and all Jerusalem is troubled, Matth. 2.3. Paul and Silas were accused for turneing the world upsyde downe, Acts 17.5. We question not but he will grante that the Lord can and doth sometymes give his church rest, Acts 9.31. but this will not stand nor continue, which we know to be his meaneinge. A man cannot be Christ's disciple but he must meete with crosses, Matth. 16.24. Esau and Jacob wrestled together in their mothers wombe, Gen. 25.22. In the 2d place you except against his opinions, because they make devisions. The gospell which he or any man holds forth will cause devisions by accident, Matth. 10.34.35. If he be blamed for this, Christ cannot be excused. The 3d thing you alledge is that his opinions make people looke at their magistrates, ministers and brethren as antichristians, enemies to Christ, but we know no such doctrine which he taught, all which he delivered concerning this matter, was a description of the way of workes and antichristianisme, and so farre as magistrates and ministers walke in that way they are to be looked at as antichristian, John 4.1, 2, 3. Lastly, it is said that his opinions are more dangerous than those of Mr. Williams which, if it be true, then is the doctrine of the gospell more dangerous than that for which Mr. Wil∣liams was banished; for as yet we know nothing which Mr. Wheelwright helde dissonant from the gospell, nei∣ther hath he beene confuted, though condemned, and it is not our judgments so much as the cause which is changed.</P>
<P>These objections and answers being viewed, and what is unsound refuted, we come to the conclusion, wherein we are desyered to judge what evill we finde in the law, and this we will doe faithfully by the helpe of Christ. This law we judge to be most wicked and sinnefull, and that for these reasons.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because this law doth leave these weightye matters of the common-wealth, of receiving or rejecting such as come over to the approbation of magistrates, and suspends these things upon the judgment of man, whereas the judg∣ment is Gods, Deut. 1.17. This is made a ground worke of grosse popery. Priests and magistrates are to judge, but
<PB N="83" REF="011300_0044_0F897291F9E968B0"/>
it must be according to the law of God, Deut. 17.9, 10, 11. That law which gives that without limittation to man, which is proper to God, cannot be just.</P>
<P N="2">2. Because here is libertye given by this law to expell and reject those which are most eminent christians, if they suite not with the disposition of the magistrates, whereby it will come to passe, that Christ and his members will finde worse entertainment amongst us than the Israelites did amongst the Egyptians and Babilonians, than Abram and Isaack did amongst the Philistines, than Jacob amongst the Shechemites, yea even than Lott amongst the Sodo∣mites. These all gave leave to Gods people, to sit downe amongst them, though they could not clayme such right as the Kings subjects may. Now that law, the execution whereof may make us more cruell and tyrannicall over Gods children than Pagans, yea than Sodomites, must needs be most wicked and sinnefull.</P>
<P N="3">3. This law doth crosse many lawes of Christ, Christ would have us render unto Caesar the things that are Cae∣sars, Math. 22.21. But this law will not give unto the Kings majesty his right of planting some of his subjects amongst us, except they please them, Christ bids us not to forget to entertaine strangers, Heb. 13.2. But here by this law we must not entertaine, for any continuance of time, such stranger as the magistrates like not, though they be never so gracious, allowed of both by God and good men, except we will forfeite unto them our whole estates, it may be and much more than our estates comes unto. Christ commands us to do good unto all, but especially to them of the household of faith. Many other lawes there are of Christ, which this law dasheth against, and therefore is most wicked and sinnefull.</P>

<HEAD>A Reply to an Answer made to a Declaration of the Intent and Equity of the Order made at the Court in May last, whereby none are to be re∣ceived &amp;c. but by allowance of the Magistrates.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Court was held at Newtown, now Cambridge, in May 1637.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>COntentions among brethren are sad spectacles, among the churches of Christ, especially when they come once to savour of bitternesse, which would have discou∣raged me from publishing the former declaration, if I could have expected such an answer: And in that respect I should willingly have sitten downe under my reproach, if the cause of truth and justice had not called me againe to this taske; wherein, if I deale more sharply, than myne owne disposition leads me, the blame must fall upon him, who puts such occasions upon me, as I cannot otherwise shunne.</P>
<P>Many faults doth the Answerer find in my declara∣tion. which I must examine as thay come in order. The <Q>1st is, that in describing a common wealth (such as ours is) I do not describe it, as it is christian, nor as it is founded upon the grant of our King.</Q></P>
<P>To this I replye 1st, the defininition or description of the genus may be applyed to all the species, reserving the specificall differences: To define a man to be a reasonable creature is a true definition of any man, whether rich or poor, christian or heathen: and when I describe a com∣mon wealth in general or in a more civil or politicke res∣pecte, the churches or christians which are in it, fall not into consideration, as to the being of it, for it may be a true body politicke, though there be neither church nor chris∣tian in it.</P>
<P>The like may be sayd for the forme of government, whether it be by patent or otherwise yet it is a govern∣ment, and so the description is safe and true.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The description which I make doth include all that which he doth complaine to be wanting. The words
<PB N="85" REF="011300_0045_0F89729304165748"/>
are these. A company of people, consenting to cohabite under one government, for their mutual safety and well∣fare. Now let ours be layd to this description and the truth will appeare. We A.B.C. &amp;c. consented to cohabite in the Massachusetts, and under the government set up among us by his Majesty's patent or grant for our mutual safety and wellfare, we agreed to walke according to the rules of the gospell. And thus you have both a christian common weale and the same founded upon the patent, and both in∣cluded within my description.</P>
<P>I will adde only what I conceive from this and other like passages in his answer, viz. that he makes this exception rather to shelter himself under pretence of his renderness of the kings honour and right, than out of any ignorance of the true latitude of my description; and withall he dis∣covers how little he regardeth what jealousyes he put us under, so he may shelter his owne parties. The Lord give him to see his secret underminings, that it may be forgiven him. Having thus faulted my description, he taketh upon him to teach me a better; and for this he refers me, by a marginal quotation to Proverb 8.5. the text is this, Oh ye simple understand wisdome and ye fools be ye of an un∣derstanding heart; and to Isai. 6.7. And he layd it upon my mouth and sayd loe this hath touched thy lipps &amp;c. How these places will prove his description of a christian common wealth, founded upon the kings patent is beyond my reach, but it suits well with a practise now in use, to speak nothing but what they bring scripture for; so scrip∣ture be alledged it matters not how impertinent they be.</P>
<P>As for your description it self, I have no more to say against it, but that it was not requisite, to that which I projected, to expresse those particulars; and our lawyers will tell you that <HI>expressio eorum quae tacitè insunt nihil operatur:</HI> My intent was to prove the proprietye and privi∣ledges of a common weale which may also belong to such government among Turkes and Pagans, so far as they may fall within my description without any prejudice to the most christian government, that is, as if I speake of one
<PB N="86" REF="011300_0046_0F897293749326F8"/>
that is an honest man, and say that he goeth upright, speakes, laughs, &amp;c. when a Turke or a Pagan doth the same.</P>
<P>His next exception is, that I say <Q>that such a body politic may use all meanes, which may conduce to their wellfare, and do not restrain it to lawful meanes.</Q></P>
<P>To this I reply, that it is according to scripture phrase, and our common speach. When we call upon a sicke man, to use meanes for his recoverye, we are well enough under∣stood, though we put not the word lawful: I may do all things, saith Paul, and give all diligence saith Peter, with∣out expressing lawful, which the Answerer would have un∣derstood well enough, if he had not beene minded to seeke a knot in a rush; only I see not why he should passe over those many things which he saith are questionable in my ground worke, and take up those which will afford so little advantage.</P>
<P>Then he proceeds to examine the reasons which I layd downe to prove the equitie of this law.</P>
<P>The first reason is this, "If we be a corporation esta∣blished by free consent, if the place of our habitation be our owne—then no man hath right to come in to us, without our consent."</P>
<P>To this he answers, that "he knoweth not how we who stand a corporation by the Kings patent can thus argue." To this I replye then. I will tell him, that which the King is pleased to bestow upon us, and we have accepted, is truly our owne.</P>
<P N="2">2. He denyeth the consequence by a distinction of a consent regulated, and a vast and illimited consent.</P>
<P>Replye: To speake of consent in general, implyeth alwayes a consent suitable to the power or interest of him who is to give it; as when we say, a child may not marrye without consent of parents, we know it is regulated, yet when a father pleads it, he doth not neede to expresse all the limitations.</P>
<P>Thus he runs on in a frivolous discourse, and in the end falls upon this false conclusion, "An unlawful dissent can hinder no man," So that if he had need to borrow my
<PB N="87" REF="011300_0046_0F897293749326F8"/>
horse, and I ought by the rule of love to lend him to him, though I refuse to consent to his request herein, yet he may take him, because my dissent is unlawfull; so by this conclusion a wife, a childe, a servant may doe any thinge that is lawfull, though the husband, father, or maister deny their consent. If this speed well, the next conclusion will be an anarchie.</P>
<P>After this discourse I expected somewhat to have taken away the consequence of my argument, but I finde not a word to that purpose, he is suddainly fallen upon my second reason, which is this,</P>
<P>"If no man hath right to our land, &amp;c. but by our con∣sent, then it is reason we should take nottice of men, be∣fore we conferre any such upon them."</P>
<P>This he partly grants, but complaines of the change of the question, to which I replye that I did not propound any reasons in a syllogisticall frame, but by way of dis∣course, and that which this argument tends unto was only to shew why some were not presently allowed, but a time taken, wherein we might gayne some nottice and tryall of them, and there was no need why the answerer should so often complaine of the change of the question; for if he takes my reasons together he cannot denye but the question itselfe is argued and concluded, as will appeare by the sequell, I will therefore passe by all that he strives about, upon this supposed fallacie, and joyne with him in the question, as he states it, viz.</P>
<P>Whether the admitting or rejecting of persons should depend upon the discretions of men, which he calls an unlimitted and unsafe rule and their discretion not regu∣lated, though they should be magistrates.</P>
<P>To this I replye, or rather answere, first, That which he takes for granted, and wherein lyes the whole strength of his defence is untrue, viz. That the magistrates will and discretion in our case is not regulated, for 1st, the magi∣strates are members of the churches here and, by that covenant, are regulated to direct all their wayes by the rule of the gospell, and if they faile in any thinge, they are subject to the churches correction. 2dly. As they are
<PB N="88" REF="011300_0047_0F89729432B6F0D0"/>
freemen, they are regulated by oath, to direct their aymes to the wellfare of this civill body. 3dly. As they are ma∣gistrates, they are sworne to doe right to all, and regulated by their relation to the people, to seeke theire wellfare in all things; so as here is no such irregulated discretion as is supposed, and it seems to me an improper speech and savouring of contradiction; for discretion alwayes im∣plyes a rule for its guide. And herein I have occasion to take in his answere to my 4th reason drawne from the practice of our churches, and some towns where matters of admitting or rejecting are ordered by discretion. And here it is made a wonder that I shew so much ignorance. I must confesse my ignorance is greate, and I cannot hide it, being exposed so much as I am to publick view: Yet that will not cover the answerers blindness, from prejudice in this greate wonder, which is such as he cannot discerne the voyce and will of Christ dispenced in the discretion of his servants and people, and yet tells us not how it should be knowne otherwise. Did he never heare. that our prac∣tise is, that none are propounded to the congregation, ex∣cept they be first allowed by the elders,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This must needs render the influence of the Clergy very great under the old Constitution. No body could be proposed to the Church for a Member unless the Minister allowed it. No body could be admitted a freeman unless he was a Member of the Church.</NOTE> and is not this to admitt or reject by discretion? Did he never heare of a christian man rejected by the church, or put off at least, be∣cause a brother hath professed want of satisfaction? Hath he never heard that the dissent of some few brethren may, by rule, (as hath beene sayd) cause the rejection of a man, whom all the rest of the brethren shall approve of? And where is Christs voyce to be heard now, if he will have discretion shut out of the church. So says the instance of townes matters (which he wisely declines and gives no an∣swer to) he well knowes that within the towne of Boston it is an established order, that none should be received into cohabitation there, except they be allowed by certain men appointed to judge of their fitness for church-fellowship. And so, whereas the way of God hath alwayes beene to gather his churches out of the world; now, the world, or
<PB N="89" REF="011300_0047_0F89729432B6F0D0"/>
civill state, must be raised out of the churches. And yet the answerer can finde nothing of wonder of ignorance here. And if he had enquired of our neighbours at Ply∣mouth, they could have tould him that their practice hath beene upon the like law, for many yeares, I mean in referring it to the discretion of the magistrates to receive and reject such as come to them. And if he had con∣sidered of a rule in the law of Moses, he should finde that there is power given to a husband or father to allow or make void any vow of a wife or childe at their discretion, yet I hope he will not call this a vast and unlimitted rule.</P>
<P>But because the word discretion seems so offensive and unsafe, let us trye it by the ballance of the sanctuarye, if we can finde it to hold weight there, sure it will prove a good measure for civill affaires.</P>
<P>The word in scripture is sometymes taken for sound reason, as Psal. 112.5. He will order his affaires by discre∣tion; so Pro. 11.12. Sometymes for understanding, as Pro. 19.11. Isai. 28.26. Sometymes for skill, as Pro- 2.11. Pro. 3.21. Sometymes for judgment, Phill. 1.9. And in all places in a good sence, for it is a gift of God wherein he despenseth his own wisdome in all the affairs of men, both in church and common wealth; all lawes are made by discretion, and the equitie of them is found out and applyed to particular cases by discretion; by it (being guided by the spirit of God) the mynde and will of God is found out in his word, Acts 5.8 and Acts 8.23. Acts 15.38. Acts 21.23. Levit. 27.8, 12. So for judgment in civil causes; by discretion did Solomon judge betweene the harlots. It is not possible to provide a law that in the letter of it shall reach every case which may fall out, as we see by the law of God it selfe in the same place of Levit. 27.8. then it must rest in the discretion of the judge to discerne, so doth the Lord himselfe appointe, Deut. 17.8.9. &amp;c. they are to do as the judge shall deter∣mine, and that which he shall declare for law, that must they obey, otherwise there could be no determination in hard and doubtful cases. As for these scriptures which the Answerer alledgeth about Christ his souerainty, &amp;c.
<PB N="90" REF="011300_0048_0F897294F4B5FCF0"/>
they are nothing to the question; for the prerogative authority of Christ in all affaires in church and common wealth, doth not hinder the manner of his dispensations of the ministry of his servants, and in the improvement of such gifts of his, of wisdome, discretion, &amp;c. as he is pleased to exercise his authority in, according to the rule of his word.</P>
<P>My 5th reason is, that it is no sinne or injury to deny a man that which he hath no right unto, therefore we may denye some men place amongst us. In the answer, there is againe complainte of changing the question, because I go about to prove that some men may be rejected, which he seemeth to grant, and if so then that which he maketh the maine question will easily be cleared, for if we may re∣ject some, then the care of this must be committed to some persons, for to speak of discerning Christ his autho∣rity in church or common wealth, otherwise than as it is dispensed in the ministry of men, is a meer idea or fan∣tasye. If then it must be committed to some persons, to whom may it more properly than to the fathers of the common wealth? And if it cannot be foreseene who are to be received and who to be rejected, those persons must be trusted with the tryall of them, and if no certaine rule can be set downe which may be sufficient to discerne of every man, then must it be committed to their discretion, regulated by the word of God, and the dutye of their place, which they are bound to observe. And whereas the Answerer cryes out against this course as vast, illimitted, sinefull and injurious, and yet will not (and cannot) pre∣scribe us a better, neither in his answer, nor at the court when he opposed the makeing of this law, may we not safely judge that such opposition and those reproachful termes as are cast from it, upon an ordinance of God, in the faces of those whom he would have to be had in honor for his sake, proceed rather from distemper of minde, than from any just cause of offence?</P>
<P>Now here I might strike him with his owne weappon, for when he seekes to prove that any of the kings sub∣jects, have right by our patent to come and plant in places
<PB N="91" REF="011300_0048_0F897294F4B5FCF0"/>
not inhabited, he changes the question indeed, for both the law and our dispute have beene about entertaining into houses and townes, and not into places not inhabited. That question may fall to be discussed upon some other occasion.</P>
<P>Againe (that we may take notice how his zeale for the cause outrunes his judgment) he gives to all the kings christian subjects a right to plant among us, by vertue of our patent, and such a right as by misusage whereof they may forfeit the patent, and here he might fitly have brought in his vast and illimitted termes, had he not mis∣placed them, for hast, for there was never seene such a vast patent of incorporation as should comprehend all the kings christian subjects, which is as large as if he had said all his subjects.</P>
<P>But that others may see his errour, if he himselfe will not, let the patent be perused, and there it will be found, that the incorporation is made to certaine persons by name, and unto such as they shall associate to themselves, and all this tract of land is granted to them and their associates: And after this he gives leave to any of his subjects to de∣part out of his other dominions to this place: So then the case standeth thus, the 10 men of Boston allow a strainger to sit downe among them, yet this gives him no right to any mans house or land, nor to any lot in the towne, till it be granted him, nor to any privilege there till he be made free; we must have a new sort of reason to make this a good argument; the King gives a man leave to inhabite in the incorporate colony of the Massachusets, <HI>ergo,</HI> he hath hereby right to the lands there. His discourse about the matter of general right by patent is so confused and irra∣tional, as I should but waste tyme and paper to follow him in it, <HI>valeat ut valere potest.</HI> I finde nothing in it which may endainger my argument, except it be put out of countenance, by a false clamour of robbery, vexation, op∣pression, &amp;c. as if the state here went about to take from men their lawful right and expell them from their houses, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The 6th reason is this, if straingers have right to our houses, &amp;c. then it is either of justice or of mercye, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="011300_0049_0F897295B403DF48"/>The answerer, after his wonted prejudice of change of the question, undertakes to prove,
<Q>that some straingers have right in justice by the Kings patent,</Q>
only he re∣straineth it to cohabitation and sojourning (which will con∣clude nothing for him, seeing this law doth not shutt out all straingers) The reasons he bringeth are three, the 1st, because they are fellow-subjects, 2dly, because they are of the same nation, 3dly, because they are christians.</P>
<P>To this I replye, that I have alreadye cleared this pointe in laying open the extent and meaneing of the patent, and this I may say further, that I have reade over all the lawes of England and all the general customes and privi∣leges of the Kings subjects there, but I have not found any thinge that may give the least colour for such a privi∣ledge as is pretended.</P>
<P>As for that of christianitye I have granted in my de∣claration that there is a right of hospitalitye, but for other right of cohabitation or sojourning it must be considered in such special cases, as may fall out and cannot be pro∣vided for by general rule.</P>
<P>My 7th reason is drawne from the proportion or re∣semblance that a common-wealth hath to a familye, which is not bound to entertaine all comers, no not every good man, otherwise than by way of hospitalitye.</P>
<P>The answerer (his complainte of changing the question premised) seekes to disprove the proportion, by <Q>distin∣guishing between the right which the maister of a familye hath to his house, &amp;c. and the right which this common wealth hath to all the houses, &amp;c. within this paient.</Q> This he amplyfyes by particular instances. <Q>1. in power of bequeathing them to his wife and children. 2. In re∣gard of the King's right. 3. In respect of such as are no members, &amp;c. and yet have right to their houses, &amp;c. 4. In regard to such as have protested against this law.</Q></P>
<P>To this I replye, that it is not needful they should hold proportion in all respect. It is sufficient if they hold in that which is intended, viz. libertye to receive or reject; which being knowne to all and confessed by the answerer,
<PB N="93" REF="011300_0049_0F897295B403DF48"/>
in granting that some may be rejected, is sufficient to make good the argument drawne from this similitude: yet to make it more cleare, I replye to these instances.</P>
<P>To the first I say, that a bodye politicke may leave their houses, &amp;c. to their successors, which are in the place of their children. 2. For the Kings right, that being para∣mount, hinders no more in a common-wealth than it doth in a familye, for he hath the same interest in the houses, &amp;c. of the father of a familye. 3. For such as are no members they are as sojourners in a familye, who though they have right to be in the familye themselves, yet may not receive in any to reside in their particular chambers, without con∣sent of the master of the familye. 4. For such as protested against this law, that protestation cometh too late (except they first convince us of the injustice of the law) seeing they formerly gave an implicite consent to all the whole∣some lawes and orders of the body; neither need we feare to proclaime our right to our houses, &amp;c. against all in∣truders, more than particular persons and corporations may do in England, notwithstanding his Majesties interest in them also. Such objections are not worth any answer.</P>
<P>In his answer to my 8th reason, viz. <Q>Turpius eijcitur quam non admittititur hospes,</Q> he saith it is of humaine authority, and that my conclusions are farr from the marke.</P>
<P>To this I replye, that though this sentence be humaine, yet the equitye of it is strengthened by divine truths: It had been lesse griefe to Abraham not to have received Hagar to his bed then it was after to cast her out; and it was <HI>turpius</HI> for Tobija and his stuffe to be cast out of the temple, then it would if he had not been received in. Now that it may appear how farre my conclusion is from the marke, I will thus lay downe the argument. That law which shuts out such as being received in, shall be worthy to be cast out is honest and of good reporte, but this law doth so, <HI>ergo,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The major proposition is proved by the examples of Hagar and Tobija, the minor I prove thus; the law pro∣vides to have such kept out as will disturbe the peace here,
<PB N="94" REF="011300_0050_0F897296769937F8"/>
rightly established by the rules of Gods word, <HI>ergo,</HI> &amp;c. except the argument may be avoyded, the conclusion will hitt the marke.</P>
<P>But the Answerer saith that, <Q>1. Such ones as are in∣tended to be kept out, are no disturbers of our peace. 2. That the law doth not declare who are to be kept out and who not.</Q></P>
<P>To these I replye first, for brevitys sake let the apo∣logie and the remonstrance, with the coppie of the whole sermon (which himselfe delivered into the court) be com∣pared and examined, and they shall decide the question, if you will stand to it.</P>
<P>To the second I replye, that yourselfe confesses who the law intended to keepe out; and though such a preamble as might have expressed the full intent, was (for want of time) omitted (which was indeed a defect) yet such as were of the court, and did well know, can make no such advan∣vantage of it, seeing the magistrates have other rules to guide them in the execution of it; and so it is warranted by scripture examples as that of our saviour Math. 16.19. and 18.18. whatsoever you binde on earth shall be bound in heaven &amp;c. yet he doth not there tell them, who they ought to binde or loose.</P>
<P>The 9th argument is taken from that of the 2 John 10. Such as bring not the true doctrine are not to be received to house, and consequently not into the common wealth.</P>
<P>The Answerer (after his usual complainte of the change of the question) acknowledgeth, that if the order had been made against such it would not have been opposed; but affirmeth that it appears (by the same expressions in the court, and by the execution of the law in part) that this law is made to keepe out such as bring the true doctrine of the gospell, so that now he hath brought the question to this state, whether the opinions spread in the country. and opposed by the magistrates and elders, be the doctrines of the gospell or not, which seeing it is to be decyded by the synod assembled, it will be best to attend the issue thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="011300_0050_0F897296769937F8"/>In his answer to the 10th reason, he doth only discourse and finde fault with a conclusion which is of his own fram∣ing (for I do not conclude that the law was only for taking notice of such as come to us, but I add also the ende of such notice, viz. for avoyding such as are to be kept out) which being all included in one parentesis, it is more than a slip thus to mistake it.</P>
<P>And whereas he chargeth me, as if I grounded the law upon no better foundation than a good intent, the reader may easily judge that it is a meere slander: For I lay down the order of the law to be, that such should not be received into our fellowship who are likely to disturbe the same; and thence I inferre that this intent is lawfull and good.</P>
<P>The like cast he hath at the persuasion and conscience of such as are to execute this law: And here I must make bold to aske him this question, viz. Seeing you are bound by your oath in all causes wherein you are to give your vote for elections, &amp;c. to goe according to your conscience, if then one be propounded to be chosen a magistrate, and you are persuaded in your conscience, by the best know∣ledge you can get of him, that he is not fitt for that place, whether are you to give your vote for him or not? When you have answered this question, I will replye further to you: And with all I desyre the answerer to take this along with him; that this law concerning the freemens oath, whereunto all the godly of this common-wealth consented, (and which referrs the judgment of persons and churches in that cause to the conscience and persuasion of christian men) was never yet held to be a vast and illimitted rule.</P>
<P>The Answerer proceeds to the objections, and least his arguments should not reach his ayme, he speakes to pre∣judice the readers judgment, by averring much unsoundnes, &amp;c. beforehand, but I must intreate him to make a better discovery ere it be yeelded.</P>
<P>The 1st objection is, that some profane persons are re∣ceived and others who are religious are rejected.</P>
<P>The answerer disclaymes this objection as none of theirs, which matters not greatly. I know from whome I heard
<PB N="96" REF="011300_0051_0F86A008DA5107B0"/>
it, though he did not; yet he might as well owne it, as offer to prove that such as are truly and christianly reli∣gious have been rejected, except he will denye such to be religious: But I affirme still, as I did before, that I know of none such, who have been rejected, nor any such blas∣phemers or quarrellers (as he speakes of) to have been received.</P>
<P>In his answer to my solution of this objection, I only observe this, that whereas my argument is by way of com∣parision <Q>betweene a younge prophaine person and an elder professor confirmed in some errour,</Q> he gaine saith the comparison by introduction of Abraham, who was a blessing to others; but alledgeth not any opposite member; but sure he was in a greate streight, otherwise he would not have held forth the father of the faithfull as such an one, as he must produce to answer my comparison; but it well accords with his owne tenent, that he must have leave to advance his owne partie, whatever danger or damage befall others by it.</P>
<P>After this he takes upon him to prove, <Q>that all such as are confirmed in any way of errour, are not to be de∣nyed cohabitation, but are to be pittyed and reformed, for this he alledgeth two places of scripture, Jude 22, 23. Gen. 16.17.</Q></P>
<P>To this I replye 1st, Let it be observed how this an∣swers my argument. I endeavoured to prove that some professors were to be denyed cohabitation, rather than some prophaine ones, for this reason, viz. because they may be more dangerous. His answer is, that all such as are con∣firmed in any way of errour are not to be denyed, &amp;c. and omitts that wherein the weight of the argument lies, viz. their being dangerous to publick peace. 2dly, I denye that these scriptures prove his proposition, for that in Jude speakes nothinge of cohabitation, or confirmation in errour, nor speakes he to magistrates, or such as had power, to re∣ceive or reject, &amp;c. and if he will bring that place to his purpose it will inferre this conclusion, that no compassion is to be had of such as we may denye cohabitation unto.
<PB N="97" REF="011300_0051_0F86A008DA5107B0"/>
As for that, Gen. 16.12. it is as little to the purpose. Ismaell dwelt in the house of his brethren, but not among them; so, by our law, such as we hold not fitt to dwell among us are not denyed to dwell by us.</P>
<P>Another objection is, "that by this law we reject true christians, and so consequently Christ himselfe."</P>
<P>The solution of this objection is, that in some cases a man that is a true christian may be rejected or denyed re∣sidence, and yet Christ not rejected; for proof whereof I instance in diverse particulars, all which he passeth by, without any directe answer; but concludes, that is nothing to the law; which I must leave to the reader to judge of, seeing he brings neither reason nor scripture against it, to which I may replye.</P>
<P>After this he comes to the particular occasion of the law, and here he layes about him in earnest, and strikes all that come in his way, magistrates, elders, and all that doe walk in that way which Mr. Wheelewright hath described to be a way of a covenant of workes, and holds them forth as Anti∣christs; and for proof hereof alledges that in 1 John 4.1, 2, 3. where the Apostle, giving a rule to discover false spirits by, gives this as the marke, they confesse not that Jesus Christ came in the flesh, and such a spirit is of Antichrist. How this place proves his assertion I am not able to dis∣cerne: Sure I am that such, as he casts under a covenant of workes, doe confesse that Christ is come in the flesh, but then I see that hereby he hath brought the cause, which he is so zealous for, into such a toyle as all the skill he hath cannot extricate, unlesse (as before) he will draw in Abraham into the same estate of antichristianism; seeing by that doctrine he walked in the same way of a covenant of workes, 14 yeares together, viz. while he kept Hagar, &amp;c.</P>
<P>For his answer in defence of Mr. Wheelewright his opinions, I will make no replye, but waite the successe of the conference among the churches now assembled.</P>
<P>In the last place he bringeth diverse reasons to prove "that this law is most wicked and sinnefull."</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="011300_0052_0F86A00B86F0D330"/>His 1st reason is, this law giveth that, without limitation, to men, which is proper to God; and so is a ground of grosse popery; for proofe he cites Deut. 1.17. and 17.9, 10, 11.</P>
<P>To which I answer, that I have proved already that the magistrates are limitted both by their church covenant and by their oath, and by the dutye of theire places, to square all their proceedings by the rule of Gods word, for the advancement of the gospell and the weale publick; neither doth it crosse either of the places mentioned, for whatsoever sentence the magistrate gives, according to these limitta∣tions, the judgment is the Lords, though he do it not by any rule particularly prescribed by civill authority. As for that other place in Deut. 17.9. it strengthens our law, and reflects sharply upon such as doe oppose it; for it streightly commands all persons to submitt to the sentence of the judge, and to receive the exposition of the law from his mouth; so as such gainesayers stand guilty of pre∣sumption in opposeing the sentence of the judges, before they have clearely convinced them that their sentence is contrary to the law of God.</P>
<P>As for that aspersion of popery, &amp;c. it will draw no blood; his earnestnes in the cause makes him thus to cast dirt upon his opposers, when he hath spent his shott.</P>
<P N="2">2. His 2d reason against this law is, that it gives libertye to the magistrates to expell and reject those who are most eminent christians, if they suite not with the magistrates disposition; and thence concludes that Christ and his mem∣bers will finde worse entertainment among us than the Israelites did among the Egyptians and Babilonians, han Abraham and Isaack among the Philistines, than Lott among the Sodomites, &amp;c.</P>
<P>To this I answer, 1. His earnestnes confounds his me∣morye; he knows well, that this law gives no power to ex∣pell any, neither doth it make the magistrates disposition the rule for rejecting any; but this slander hath beene con∣futed before. 2. For a brother in church covenant and a fellow member of such a civill body as ours, to conclude
<PB N="99" REF="011300_0052_0F86A00B86F0D330"/>
so peremptorily of his fellow brethren, favours of much arogance and desperate prejudice. If his charity can hope no better of us, but that we will deale worse with Gods people than the Pagans (and that before he hath seene any experience of it) it is no marvaile if he favour such as have ranked us with the same before; onely herein he deales fairely with us, in giving us tymely warneing what to ex∣pect from the imbittered mynde of such a brother; but for his argument it selfe thus it stands: The Egyptians, &amp;c. gave leave to Gods people, to sett downe amongst them: But the magistrates will not give leave, &amp;c. <HI>ergo,</HI> they are worse than the Egyptians, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I answer, howsoever the magistrates cannot stopp his fury, yet we shall free the law from the force of his argu∣ment: For except he had assumed thus, the magistrates must or may &amp;c. for it is nothing to the law, that they will doe so, seeing a magistrates will may transgresse a good law, and if they should doe so, yet I denye that it is by the liberty of the law, which I shall not need further to prove, seeing my denyall will bear as much weight as his affirmation.</P>
<P N="3">3. His 3d reason is, this law doth crosse many lawes of Christ. This he proves by enumeration of 3 particulars, Matt. 22.21. Heb. 13.2. Gal. 6.10.</P>
<P>To this I answer, and 1. to that of Matt. 22.21. Give unto Cesar the things which are Cesars. The reason lyes thus: The King hath right to plant any of his subjects among us; but we denye to let him plant some of his sub∣jects among us, unlesse they please us; <HI>ergo,</HI> we denye to Cesar, &amp;c. The proposition is false; for I have proved before, that the King haveing given all the land within cer∣taine limitts to the patentees and their associates, cannot send others to possesse that which he hath granted before.</P>
<P N="2">2. As for that in Heb. 13. it is nothing to the purpose; This law of the court hinders not the entertainment of straingers so farre as the rule of hospitalitye requires; and there is no other intended in that place.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="100" REF="011300_0053_0F86A00BF6714568"/>3. For that in Gal. 6. I confesse the houshold of faith are principally to be regarded; and it is apparent that the care of their wellfare was the only occasion and ground (next the glory of God) of the making of this law: For, the court, taking nottice how the hearts of the faithfull were sadded by the spreading of diverse new and unfound opinions, and the uncharitable censures which they laye under by occasion of them, how brotherly love and com∣munion decayed, how the ordinances of religion were neg∣lected, and the faithfull dispensers thereof (sometimes more precious than fine gold) slighted and reproached, through∣out the whole countrey, they found it needfull to provide remedye in tyme, that it might goe well with the houshold of faith, and though the execution of this law should turne to the damage of some of this houshold, yet better it is some member should suffer the evill they bring upon them∣selves, than that, by indulgence towards them, the whole familye of God in this countrey should be scattered, if not destroyed.</P>
<P>His last argument (by which we may see that he ment not to quitt the cause, so long as his breath would hold) is this, This law dasheth against many other lawes of Christ <HI>ergo,</HI> it is most wicked and sinnefull.</P>
<P>To which my answer may be short, and yet sufficient to withstand the force of his argument. This law dasheth not against any law of Christ; <HI>ergo,</HI> it is just and good.</P>

<P>THIS day the Lords Commissioners for foreign Plan∣tations, taking into consideration that the petitions and complaints of his Majestys subjects planters and tra∣ders in New-England grow more frequent than hereto∣fore for want of a settled and orderly government in those parts, and calling to mind that they had formerly given order about two or three years since to Mr. Cradock a member of that plantation, to cause the grant or letters patent of that plantation (alleadged by him to be there remaining in the hands of Mr. Winthrop) to be sent over hither, and that notwithstanding the same, the said letters patent were not as yet brought over: And their Lordships being now informed by Mr. Attorney General that a Quo Warranto had been by him brought according to former order against the said patent, and the same was proceeded to judgment against so many as had appeared, and that they which had not appeared, were outlawed.</P>
<P>Their lordships well approving of Mr. Attorney's care and proceeding therein did now resolve and order, that Mr. Meawtis clerk of the council attendant upon the said commissioners for foreign plantations should in a letter from himselfe to Mr. Winthrop inclose and convey this order unto him.

I should be glad to be truly informed by you, what You conceive of the soyle and meanes of subsistances, and whether that exposition agrees with the truth of things. I am sorry to heare of Mr. Williams's sepa∣ration from you: His former good affections to you, and the plantations, were well known unto me and make me wonder now at his proceedinges. I have wrote to him effectually to submit to better judgments, and especially to those whom formerly he reverenced and admired; at least to keepe the bond of peace inviolable. This hath been alwayes my advise; and nothing conduceth more to the good of plantations. I praye shew him what lawfull fa∣vour you can, which may stand with the common good. He is passionate and precipitate, which may transport him into error, but I hope his integrity and good intentions will bring him at last into the waye of truth, and confirme

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thank you for your continued offices of love in your counsaile to my servant, while the Lord granted him health, and your kindnes and respect to him in his sick∣nes; as the Lord shall offer me opportunitie you shall ever find me ready to performe the like or any other fruit of well affection for you or yours. The change that his death hath made in my occasions putts me upon much new labour that I thought I had done with, and therefore I must be very briefe at present. I shall desire that those cattle that are in your hands or any others may be conti∣nued as they were till next springe, when I shall, if the Lord grant life, take order for them. I wrote to you con∣cerning powder that was left in the bay, the store we had here grows short, but I hope we shall have noe need till next springe, until when I leave it also, only I directed my man that if he saw it decaying, haveing been long kept, (though that we have here holds yet well) he should sell 8 or 10 barrels of it. Concerning the last part of your letter I can yet say little, only thus much that whatsoever tends to mutual defence and shall conduce to the settling and maintaining unfained love, you may expect from me and all those who are intrested in this place. For other matters, as they are of great consequence and near concern∣ment to others as well as myself, I can at present say thus much only, that if there be any thing betwixt you and the townes above, about bounds, whatsoever is concluded without us heare I shall account invalid and must protest

I am lastly to thank you kindly on my wifes behalf for your great dainties; we both desire and delight much in that primitive imploy∣ment of dressing a garden, and the taste of soe good fruits in these partes gives us good incouragement.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAD not the Almighty (who is righteous in the mid∣dest of mans unrighteousnes) stirred up certaine malicious and slanderous persons to defame me with impu∣dent, falfe and shameles reports, to my no small griefe and trouble, I had been with you before this day, knowing right well how comfortable the face of a friend is in such sad conditions as yours at present. How I have been and am affected with those losses and crosses as are befallen you by your unfaithful servant, he that made the heart best knoweth. But when I consider how unhappy a man may be, in the fullest and most plentiful enjoyment of worldly treasures, then I judge you neerer happines in the losse of them; not doubting but our gracious God will sanctifie his hand unto you, assuring myselfe it will be good for you in the end. How prone would Gods people be to have their hearts ensnared and taken up with the world and the riches and honors thereof, if he should not sometimes shew us their vanity. He that brought Job so low (after he was humbled before him) blessed his latter daies more than his former. We have to doe with the same God: He can doe what he will, and let this be our comfort, he will doe what is best for us: Therefore let us shew forth his praise by patient submitting to his hand, joining therewith a diligent enquiry after the cause twixt him and ourselves. I have too often used a foolish proverb, I had rather be envyed than pittyed: But I finde by lamentable experience Gods word true, That none can stand before envy; and there∣fore prefer your condition farre before mine owne, whom I conceive to be compassed about with friends. But alas, however a friend loves at all times, now is the time of tryall; and herein (as many other waies) I doubt not but you will gaine by your present condition; which the Lord

<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR pious and good letter I received; for which I humbly thanke you. Your judicious counsel therein I lovingly imbrace, as concurring fully with mine owne judgment: Hence have I not troubled the people at all with church discipline, or constitutions of churches, &amp;c. but have bent my whole studdies to shew them their miserable and lost estate without Christ, &amp;c. Nor have I enveyed, in the least measure, against the church of Eng∣land (to my remembrance) but have been (and still am) very fearefull to give one word of distast about those things, but altogether do seek to gaine them to Christ. True, I do acknowledge that after I had been here for the space of a month or 6 weeks, and perceiving them very superstitious, (performing mans invention rather than the
<PB N="112" REF="011300_0059_0F86A0139C713060"/>
instituted worship of God) now, that I might gaine their good esteeme of Gods pure ordinances, and make them see the evill and folly of their superstition and will-wor∣ship, I made choise of Ps. 19. and 7. to handle it at large: And, in one of the uses of reproof, I bent myselfe as strong∣ly as I could against the religion of the Papists, and con∣demned those practices, which I saw the people here were superstitiously addicted to, in that use against the Papists; whose religion I shewed, at large, consisted either of a new instructed worship not mentioned in the law of God, or of Gods instituted worship miserably abused, either by their additions or diminutions; and shewed the particulars wherein. Now (I heartily thank God for it) it took a generall good impression, excepting Mr. Vines and one more who told me I struck at the church of England, though I mentioned her not. Whereupon he pressed me to dispute with him about one part, of baptizing infants with godfathers and godmothers; the which I was very loth to dispute about; yet I saw that either I must, or else sit downe with shame, for he had called together his whole family to heare it. Now, it pleased God so to strengthen me (through the riches of his mercy) that he was utterly silent; and since that time hath manifested more respect and love to me and my master than formerly, and doth take notes of the sermons dayly, and repeateth them in his family very orderly, as I am informed.</P>
<P>Thus, sweet Sir, I make very bold to enforme your wor∣ship with the truth of things, though not worth the writing.</P>
<P>I have been solicited both from the inhabitance of Stratens plantation and from those of Caskoe, to be a meanes to helpe each of them to a godly minister; where∣fore I do make bold to intreat your worship to do your endeavour to furnish them both.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Deare Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am glad that La Tour hath not ayd from us; and I could wish hee might not have any from the shipps: For as long as La Tour and Daulney are opposites they will weaken one another. If La Tour should prevail against him we shall undoubtedly have an ill neighbour. His father and himselfe, as I am informed, have shed the blood of some English already, and taken away a pinnace and goods from Mr. Allerton. It were (I think) good, that that busines were cleared before hee had either ayd or libertie to hire shipps, yea, or to depart.</P>
<P>Sir, it is not the manner abroad to suffer straingers to view forts or fortifications, as it seems these French have done. I must needs say, that I feare we shall have little comfort in having any thing to doe with these idolatrous French. The countrey hereabouts is much troubled that they are so entertayned and have their libertie as they have to bring their soldiers ashore, and to suffer them to trayne their men. And great jealousies there are, that it is not Daulney that is aymed at; seeing such a strength will neither sute such a poore designe, and La Tour a man of weake estate, as it is said. Wherefore, other mens hands are employed, and purses too, for some other service. But I leave all these things to your serious considerations, desireing the Lord to guide you therein to the glorie and peace of the churches here, to whose grace I commit you and humblie rest,</P>

<P>I Understand by Mr. Parker that you have written to me by Mr. Shurt, which as yet I have not received. It cannot be unknown to you the fears that we are in since La Tours promise of ayd from you; for my part, I thought fitt to certifye foe much unto you, and I doubt not only these parts which are naked, but all N. E. will finde D'Aulnay a scourge. He hath long wayted (with the expence of neer 800<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> per month) for the apprehending of this supply, and if all his hopes shall be frustrated through your ayd, you may conceive where he will seeke for satisfaction. If a thorough worke could be made, that he might utterly be extirpated, I should like it well; other∣wise it cannot be thought but a soldier and a gentleman will seeke to revenge himself, having 500 men, 2 shipps, a galley, and 3 pinnases, well provided: Besides you may please to conceive in what manner he now besiedges La Tour, his shipps lye on the S. W. part of the island at the entrance of St. Johns river, within which side is only the entrance for shipps, on the N. E. lye his pinnases; it can∣not be conceived but he will fortifye the island, which will debarr the entrance of any of your shipps and force them backe, shewing the will, having not the power, to hurt him.</P>
<P>I suppose I shall for England in this shipp, I am not as yet certayn, which makes me forbear to be large at this tyme, or to desire your commands thither. Thus in haste I rest,</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from Richard Saltonstall and others to the Honourable Governor, Deputy-Governor, and Assistants, and the Reverend Elders at or near the Bay.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Much honoured in the Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THough we doe, and may truly, professe ourselves to be both unfit and unwilling to interpose in a matter of such state and weight, as we conceive this French af∣fair to bee, yet the honour we owe to the religion we pro∣fesse, the loyalty we beare to our native country, especially in its present condition and the reference wherein it stands to the kingdome of France, out of respect to the reputa∣tion of our government and governors, our tender care of the souls and lives of such as are committed to the trust thereof, the eye of care we ought to have upon our friends in the east, our regard to our christian confede∣rates, so lately combined with us, in confidence of our piety and wisdome, and the religious discharge of our own consciences and duties, will not permit us to be silent, so long as there is any roome left for us to speake. We have littel hope to revoke resolutions soe farre transacted and ripned, but we presume it shall not be taken amisse, if we labour to wash our hands wholly of this designe, and what ill consequences soever it may produce. The reasons moving us hereto, are our deepe feares that the stated rules of undertaking warres, either by proper and direct enter∣prize, or by lending ayd, have not been so duly observed, as we could wish.</P>
<P N="1">1. The grounds of warre ought to be just and necessary. For the justice of this warre by la Tour agaynst Daulnay, we conceive that all the light and information New Eng∣land hath, or may probably receive, cannot be sufficient for us to determine it possitively; we understand it hath beene variously judged in the courts of France, one while for Daulnay, another while for la Tour, and it is not impos∣sible that la Tour hath now rather outfriended than out∣pleaded Daulnay; we shall therefore runne into an un∣christian
<PB N="116" REF="011300_0061_0F86A0175875FE50"/>
premunire of presumption if we resolve upon such an enterprize with an irresolved faith, <HI>in causâ dubiâ bellum non est suscipiendum.</HI> For the necessity of it, it must either be in point of charity towards de la Tour or upon some engageing interest of our owne. For any bond of charity, we conceive the speech of the prophet to Jeho∣shaphat, 2 Chron. 19.2. and of Solomon, Proverbs 26.17. not only discharge but strongly prohibite us. 1. For our owne interest, if it be cleare that Daulnay hath offered us such great wrong, as invites us to a warre (which we much question, for it must be <HI>atrox injuria)</HI> we suppose it would stand more with the honor of our religion and plan∣tation, to proceed professedly and orderly against him, then for us English to become but margent notes upon a French text, which to us is as yet but apocripha; and to undertake him upon more certaine grounds, and at a more seasonable time when he doth less expect us, and is not so well provided for us as now he is. Warrs are extreme remedies and are not to be enterprised unlesse their causes will beare out all manner of effects and consequences, whe∣ther personall or nationall, which may ensue. And what may not ensue, if either of the nations to whom we belong will comment upon our action in a state language? And how apt a time this is for misconstructions we cannot be ignorant. The spirit of warre is scholastick and jesuitical, traversing the very positions and principles, which peace hath held both dogmatical and irrefragable, even to the wonderment of rational men. We are informed that Daulnay desires our friendship, and we are inclined to believe that if it did as well become him to appeal to our judgment as it ill be∣seemes us to expect it, he would not refuse to cast himself upon our compromise.</P>
<P N="2">2. Warres ought not to be undertaken without the counsell and command of the supreame authority, whence expeditions issue. It is not hard to say, the present re∣ference betweene the kingdomes of England and France considered, that the subjects of the one ought not to wage warre against the other without a publick commission of
<PB N="117" REF="011300_0061_0F86A0175875FE50"/>
state, unlesse it be in defence upon a sudden assault: Nei∣ther do we yet heare that La Tour himself hath any such commission for this his action; though if he had it were little to us. It is a rule observed amongst confederates, that during any league of peace betweene them, one friend may not ayd another against any part of his pro∣vince, till that part be proscribed by the authority of a generall assembly whereof it is a member, and the confe∣derates assured thereof in a state way. The breach of this rule is a breach of league. Publick actions of hosti∣lity worke farre and wide, having their national and con∣federal influences and consequences. The daggers we draw here may happly prove swords in Christendome for ought we know.</P>
<P>But this designe, whatever the cause was, seemed shy even of our New-English Counsel to warrant and guide it: How closely it concernes the peace and safety of the whole plantation may easily be conjectured, and how farre it declined the advice thereof in a representative course we are very sorry to consider or mention.</P>
<P>We dare not so much impeach the honour of the ad∣visours as to think they would vaile the action with this, that they only permit and give way to volunteirs; for who knows not this to be a rule of state, that Not to for∣bid, when there is notice and power, is to bidd.</P>
<P>This were also to proclaime our weaknes, in prostrating our government to nothing; for who is ignorant that To permit voluntiers to issue out in ayd of a friend is never done without an act of state, where any state is?</P>
<P>Daulnay, nor France, are not so feeble in their intel∣lectuals as to deeme it no act of state, when, upon consul∣tation with some of our chiefe persons, our men are suf∣fered, if not incouraged, to goe forth with our provision and munition upon the designe: We do therefore wonder that our people, having no warrant from authority, will, of their own heads, runne such a hazzard of their soules and lives, as can neither looke for any prayers or thankes for their good successe, nor any succours if it sares ill, and
<PB N="118" REF="011300_0062_0F86A0182AC40750"/>
as it may fall out, rather call for the curses of their friends from whom they went, and of posterity yet unborne, and yet these poore men presume that if Daulnay should say, as the King of Egypt to Josiah, what have I to do with thee, thou King of Judah? I come not out against thee this day, but against the house with whome I have warre, or if they should shed innocent blood or feel their owne soules dropping suddenly into hell, they had their warrant from the Counsel and countenance of those upon whom they might and ought to confide. It were to be wished they had been taught the Germane proverb, which sayth, He that loseth his life in an unnecessary quarrel dyes the Devill's martyr. Had they had the voyces of the people with them, it had beene better than nothing; but that wind seemes to us to blow strong in the teeth of their voyage. We shall presume to propound these questions. 1. If Daulnay or France shall hereafter demand any of them from us as enemies, or murtherers, whether will our court protect or deliver them? 2. If any of the parents or wives shall require their lives at our hands, who shall an∣swer them? 3. If any of their widdowes or children shall require sustenance, or any maimed souldier in this expedi∣tion call for maintenance, who shall give it them? or if taken captive and made slaves, who shall rescue or redeem them?</P>
<P N="3">3. The ends of warre ought to be religious: What glory is intended hereby to God we see not, and how our peace shall hereby be settled we foresee not, but suspect it will rather be a beginning than an end of our troubles and feares, if we doe not wholly suppresse Daulnay, we may be sure of it. He is already very strong, and if our ships and munition fall into his hand, it will deminish from us, and incourage, exasperate and strengthen him.</P>
<P>If La Tour prevaile he is like to cavill with our men for some miscarriages, or we with him for non-payment. The passage of our ships to and from England hath hither∣to beene quiet and safe, in regard of the French, but we cannot so expect it hereafter, if they shall meete with any of La Tours or Daulnayes special friends, or at least with
<PB N="119" REF="011300_0062_0F86A0182AC40750"/>
the friends of such of them as we shall seeme to wrong. <HI>Bellum contra hostem non est suscipiendum cum periculo rei∣publicae,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4. Undertakings of warrs ought to be probably feasable, but this seemes not soe to us. We learne out of the East, be an eye witnesse, that Daulnay is very strong, in artillery, men and munition, at land, and very well provided at sea, insomuch that some of the East have consulted to repayre to him in his ayd, least he should upon revenge annoy and ruine them; he is reported to be a valiant, prudent and experienced souldier and commander, and defendants have great advantages of assaylants, soe that, we feare, our sheep have hastned to their slaughter.</P>
<P N="5">5. Lastly, The manner of enterprising warre calls for many rules, according to scripture and the custome of re∣ligious and ingenuous nations, as to summon and give warning before they strike: To heare what the defendant can pleade for the justice of his cause, to offer termes of peace with equal articles, and to give special cautionary commissions and commands how farre to persist in ayd, and when to desist; but we neither can send fitt men for such charges, nor can we prescribe such directions, without a professed imbarquing ourselves in the action; which, it seems, is wholly declined on our parts.</P>
<P>We therefore trouble you no further, only we itterate our protestation that we are and desire to be held cleare and innocent of this undertakeing, and</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from Mr. Endecott to Governor Winthrop, about the French.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dearest Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Finde that your troubles are many, and especiallie about this French busines. The Lord in mercie support you. I am much grieved to heare what I heare; and I see more of the spirits of some men than ever I thought I should see. The Lord rebuke Satan. Sir, be of good comfort, I doubt not but our God that is in heaven will carry you above all the injuries of men; for I know you would not permitt any thinge, much less act in any thinge that might tend to the least damage of this people, and this I am assured of, that most of Gods people here about us are of the same minde. The rumours of the countrey, you know, they rise out of ignorance principallie, and much out of fears; wherefore, I pray you, let there be satis∣faction given as soone as you convenientlie can, in the way you wrote me of; for I finde the spirits of of men in this countrie are too quick and forward. I cannot excuse my∣selfe, yet I blesse God, not to wronge you, but according to the information and light I received from you, I acted publiquelie so farre forth as to break downe all prejudices against yourselfe or the rest that advised with you. Our prayers here are publiquely and privately for a good issue of it, and that continually. I hope God will looke upon your sinceritie in mercie and will heare our requests.</P>
<P>I see no good use of such protestations as I heare of, but they may prove more dangerous than the French bu∣sines by farre, if our God hinder not. However, it will be of use (God directing) to make a holy use of it.</P>
<P>Touching my coming to Boston about the Dutch bu∣sines, I cannot see how it will be of any use: For the messenger cannot have a determinate answer till the ge∣nerall court, and to morrow we have appointed many of the towne for the working of the fort, which, unless I be there, there will not any thing be done, and I received not your letter till this day after our lecture.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="011300_0063_0F86A018B55ED398"/>I conceive, if you doe any thing about Mr. Oateleys busines, that you also will be pleased to appoint some day and grant some summons to him, that hee may bring in his witnesses, that there may not be any just ground of exceptions given: For hee speakes as if hee were much wronged in all the testimonies taken against him, and that he can disprove them, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Touching the note about Bushrode, I shall bring it with mee (God willing) the next court.</P>
<P>The Lord our good God be with you, to uphold you, and to continue you amongst us, to do yet further service, to whose grace I committ you.</P>

<HEAD>The Governor's Answer to the Ipswich Letter about La Tour.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen and beloved brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not unknowne to you, that (through the Lords gracious assistance) I have thankfully imbraced and submitted unto the wise and loveing advise and admonitions of any of my brethren; and truly it is still my desire so to doe: And this (I hope) may well stand (upon this pre∣sent occasion) with the maintenance of what is good and righteous in our cause, about this French busines, and with that faithfulnes that is againe required of me towards you all, whom I love honour and reverence in the Lord. And though I have lately written to you about this matter, yet that which I have since received from you calls upon me for some addition and answer also; which I do not with any purpose to contend, but in discharge of my conscience and duty of my place, and let the Lord do what seemes good in his eyes.</P>
<P>The protestation, which was directed to myselfe first, but came to me through many hands (and so it seemes it
<PB N="122" REF="011300_0064_0F86A019B66D0F48"/>
was intended by you, being sent unsealed) was entertained of me as proceeding from your zealous care for the publick safety: But, considered in itselfe, it is an act of an exorbi∣tant nature, out of rule, out of season, and of dangerous consequence. Such protestations are publique and judicial acts, and therefore must be warranted by some authority, which appears not in this. I know no law, order, custome or &amp;c. that can give power to 3 assistants, by any such publick instrument, to contradict the proceedings of a greater number, the Governor also being one of them; and how it will consist with the obligation of a freeman is also considerable. Suppose now, 3 other assistants and so many elders should protest against your protestation, it would be of equal force, and as warrantable for ought I knowe. Againe, it comes not like Solomons apples of gold if plates of silver; it is <HI>consilium post factum:</HI> Whereas, if you had sent it in season, it might perchance have stopped those proceedings which you so much complaine against; whereas, at present (you know and may see) you do but beate the ayre, and strive for that which (you are sure) you cannot reach. It is also of dangerous consequence in these respects. 1. It may be a president for others to at∣tempt the like in any case; for you take upon you the sole judgment of your owne act, and if others may have the like liberty, they may countenance their opposition to authority, as well in evill causes as in good. 2. It blowes a trumpet to division and dissention amongst ourselves, magistrates protesting against magistrates, elders against elders, blameing, condemning, exposeing brethren to the peoples curses, and casting them down to hell itselfe; and all this must be indured, while we walk after the light God affords us from his owne word, and the presidential acts of former times, and of our owne generall court (as will be expressed hereafter) whereas the way of God, and of order, and of peace, had beene to have referred your grievance to the generall court, and not by such an un∣warrantable protestation and outcry against your brethren, to incite the people against them; whereof, if any evill
<PB N="123" REF="011300_0064_0F86A019B66D0F48"/>
effect should follow, your protestation of innocencie would afford you little comfort or defence. 3. This is the ready way to hasten upon us the evill so much feared: For if Daulnay understand our divisions to be such, as he is like to have a party amongst ourselves, (as you declare your intelligence to be) this may imboulden him to attempt that against us which, otherwise, he dared not have done. It is also against the rule of justice, your owne plea on Daul∣nays behalfe, for you passe sentence and publish it without calling us to answer: If may be one or two of you have accidentally heard us speake somewhat about it, but did you ever enquire of us, if we had any more to say for our selves, why judgment &amp;c. For you will find we have more to say for our selves than you formerly heard, and it is a necessary consequence, if you had power to be our judges, you had the same to require our answer. I intreate you to call to mind that beaten rule of equity, <HI>Qui aliquid sta∣tuit parte inauditâ alterâ,</HI> &amp;c. We are condemned in court, in country, by private tongues and by publick edict, and never asked, Why have you done this? and all this so carryed on, and unseasonably dispensed as no man can tell (nor do yourselves propound) what you would have, or how it may tend to any publick good or prevention of that great danger which you suppose to hang over us; except it may be conceived that, either Daulnay will be pacified with a protestation, or the people will be stirred up to sacrifice some of us to make their owne peace. You say, indeed, you will hereby be innocent of all the evill that may insue, &amp;c. Amen, say I; but surely wise men will not believe that such a protestation will acquit you, either before God or men: No more than if one of the magistrates <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> court while a man is con∣demned, and after he is executed shall tender a protesta∣tion of his dissent from the sentence. And truly (brethren) you might have dealt a little more tenderly with us, for such saileings as you have apprehended in our counsells, being the fruite but of a few houres consultation; seeing yourselves, (upon so many weekes deliberation) could not
<PB N="124" REF="011300_0065_0F86A01A34D3AA98"/>
free your owne acts from such miscarriage as you see your protestation, out of date and out of course, doth hould forth.</P>
<P>This I thought needfull to tender to your wise and christian consideration, concerning your protestation in ge∣nerall: Somewhat I must say to your arguments, besides what may concerne them in my former writings. But, first, you may please to consider, that it cannot be denyed but that the Governor, assisted with some of the magi∣strates, may take order for such sudden affaires of the state as either need not, or cannot, stay the assembling of the general court; of which sort, we conceived this was (the reasons you may see in my former writing) and when, in such cases, we have proceeded according to our best skill and judgment, we are to be excused, and so it was wont to be: And the generall court seemes lately to have in∣larged this trust, when, by the order of (4) 1641, it gives power, out of court, to any 3 magistrates to do that which may occasion a warre, with the Indians, as likely as this with the French: For they may give commission to any master to right himselfe upon the Indians, for his fugitive servant. By like authority it was that some of us disarmed the Indians and imprisoned some of them, upon the late suspicion: And although it was conceived to be full of danger, and proved troublesome and chargeable, yet wee were not reproved for it. Other instances might be brought, but in those times, indeed, when such protesta∣tions were not in use. Now, in this case of the French, wherein the onely doubt was, not whether wee should in∣gage ourselves in a warre with La Toure against Daulney, or not; for, we know that neither the magistrates nor the generall court it selfe could determine that,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No War could be declared without the consent of the united Colonies▪</NOTE> but whether it were safer or more just and honourable for us to stop the course of God's providence, offering us opportunity to save a distressed neighbour, to weaken a dangerous ene∣my without our chardge or engagement, or to suffer it to go on freely in its owne course. Of these two we judged the last to be best, &amp;c. And of this opinion some of us shall still be untill we see stronger arguments against it, than as yet we have met with.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="011300_0065_0F86A01A34D3AA98"/>Now for your arguments, (whereof some concerne the preceedings, others the consequences) I will passe by that of Jehosaphat as no parallel to our case; and see if I can free us from that of Prov. 26. And here it may be first observed, that he speaks of one that passeth by, viz. that had no calling or invitation to deale in it. But 2, I will shew that this strife betweene La Tour and Daulnay doth neerly concerne us: and first in point of duty, in that our distressed neighbour calls to us for help; a speciall pro∣vidence of God and his owne good opinion of our chari∣tableness, brought him to us, for some ends, and no other appearing to us, it was our duty to attend his; nor were we in this case to stand upon the justice of the quarrell betweene them, no more than Abraham did when Lot and the Sodomites were in present distresse; nor than any man would doe, if he saw his neighbour under foote and in danger to be killed, he would first rescue him from dan∣ger, ere he enquire of the cause. And how we might withould such helpe from La Tour which that providence which brought him hither, might here offer him in his apparent distresse and danger of utter ruine, I professe I see no warrant.</P>
<P>For cleareing of this point I desire you seriously to con∣sider an argument or two. 1, He is either a neighbour or no neighbour. If he be not a neighbour, then is he in no relation to us by the second table, and then we may rob, beate, or kill him without breach of any commandment. But if he be a neighbour then must we do to him in his distresse, as we would have others do to us in ours. 2dly, If he be one of those ALL, to whom by the rule of the Apostle we must doe good (as he must needs be, if he be either of the houshould of faith or out of it) then that is the good we must do to him, which he hath most present neede of; and that we may not withould from him, when it is in our hands to give it him, Prov. 3.27. I pray you consider the place. 3dly, If my neighbours or mine ene∣mies oxe be in that state as he cannot get to his place without my helpe, I must helpe him to his place, Exod.
<PB N="126" REF="011300_0066_0F86A01D75A54E90"/>
23.4. much rather my neighbour himselfe; and therefore La Tour and his company being now before us in that condition, we ought to helpe him hence. These are plain and general rules and will not beare distinctions of protes∣tant and papist: For the morall law being given to man by nature was given to him as man, not as man so and so qualifyed, and therefore when it requires duty from him, it requires it as from a man simply; and when it pro∣pounds man as an object of this duty, it propounds him also simply considered without distinction of good or bad, christian or heathen, &amp;c. and our Saviour inforceth this by propounding the example of our heavenly father, who causeth the sun to shine upon the just and unjust, &amp;c. and commands us to follow his example. And the gospell makes this difference only, that in question of priority, or necessi∣ty of neglect of one, the faithfull must be preferred. Therefore let us see something of like authority to dis∣pense with these rules, or else we must conclude, that this (so farr as we deale in it) is a thing that concernes us. 2dly, As it concerns us in point of duty, so doth it also in point of danger. I have shewed in my former writing, how Daulnay hath dealt with us and our neighbours, when he was weak, what principles he is acted by, and what pretences he hath against us; and all histories teach us that the ambition and covetousnes of conquerours and spoylers, hath always increased with their power: And shall we not believe that Daulnay onely will be more calmed and moderated by accesse of 200 soldiers, and 4 or 5000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> yearely revenue: Let the latin proverb be attended as well us the Germaine, and that will tell us that <HI>res nostra agitur, paries cum proximus ardet.</HI> I may strengthen this con∣cernment by a late Germaine history. When the bishop of Spiers had begun to raise a strong fortification upon his owne territories, the late Palatine of Rhine demolished it by force of armes in a time of peace, because it might be dangerous to him if warr should arise. And the Lacede∣monians being in league with the Athenians (their owne city being unwalled) would not suffer the Athenians to
<PB N="127" REF="011300_0066_0F86A01D75A54E90"/>
wall theirs, because it concerned them in point of advan∣tage. And it hath beene usual for the States of Europe to interpose in quarrells of their neighbour States, when they have concerned them but in point of danger onely. Now for your discourse about our distinction betweene commanding and not forbidding, let the distinction be rightly stated as it concerns our practise, and not as you would put upon us, and we hope it will hould so well, as neither the advisers nor the actors shall neede to be asham∣ed to owne it. We disclaime to have any hand in yield∣ing leave to any of ours to go make warr upon Daulnay, but this we owne and no more, that we gave leave to such as could be hyred, &amp;c. to accompany La Tour and to con∣duct him to his owne place. And such a permission at this (though it were a commission to this purpose) we stand still to maintaine is no undertaking of warr, nor act of hostility, but a meere liberty of commerce, and if any blood shed should follow upon it, it is accidentall and not depending uppon this as any cause of it. Nor is it any just provocation of warr, or any breach of peace, nor so accounted among civil states. I shall cleare it by an in∣stance or two both private and public. If I have a neigh∣bour within a few miles of me suspected to be a robber, if I send my servant to beate him and he doth so, I am a trespasser; if he kill him, I am a murderer. But if a tra∣veller comes by and tells me that he hath a chardge about him, and he is afraid to goe alone on his journey for feare of such man, and desires me to let my servant go with him (if he be willing) though it may be dangerous to his life, and may also prove danger to mee or mine from such robber: And if the traveller be now sett upon by this robber and my servant kills him, we may both justify it.</P>
<P>I will give another instance. A merchant of Spaine being in London, by leave of the King of England, hires a London ship to transport him and his goods into Spaine; upon the way, a Holland man of war meetes and fights with him, and men are slaine on both sides, yet without any breach of peace on either side, or any act of hostility in
<PB N="128" REF="011300_0067_0F86A01EA58C2EC0"/>
the King of England, as it would have beene if he had granted a commission to assault the Hollander: So that you may see there is a wide difference betweene giveing commission to fight and giveing leave to be hyred to guard or transport. So as you must needs have beene mistaken in the right statinge of the distinction, or else I cannot conceive what your apprehensions should be of the English and Irish and Scottish, who in so greate numbers, for these many years, have served the States against the Spaniards, and the Spaniards against the States, the Swedes against the Emperor, and <HI>e contra,</HI> without any breach of the peace between those nations. But, admit such a permission were against a rule of state; yet, if that rule of state be against the rule of charity, it will not be hard to judge which must give place. I will conclude this argument with that which I touch∣ed in my former writing. That which is lawful for a private person to do, in the way of his calling, the magistrate (if he judge it expedient, or not hurtfull to the commonwealth) ought to furder, or not to hinder him in it. But it is lawful for the owners and masters of shipps, and is in the way of their calling, to be hyred by La Tour, to convey him to his rightfull habitation, and we judge it no way hurtfull but advantagious to this commonwealth; there∣fore we did well, according to the duty of our office, in yielding leave to them, and in not hindering them. And it is no sufficient plea against it, to say that we know not the justice of his cause; for that will not concerne us in this case (and yet we do know it in good measure) But if our shipps shall be opposed in their lawfull course, the jus∣tice of their cause will lye in that: As for example: A man travaileing in a waggon in England, and carrying his goods with him, his creditor sets upon the waggon to take his debtors goods from him by force, the waggoner may defend him and his goods, being now in his charge, with∣out any respect to the former ingagement; for the justice of his cause ariseth upon another ground. Neither is there any need to send to Daulnay before they goe (no, though they went of purpose to fight with him) for besides divers
<PB N="129" REF="011300_0067_0F86A01EA58C2EC0"/>
examples in scripture to warrant the forbearance of it, the rule in Deut. 20.10. gives other direction: When thou comest <HI>neere to</HI> a city to fight against it, thou shalt send to offer peace, &amp;c. This point being thus cleared, that we have not enterprised any warre in this our pro∣ceeding, all your complaints against us, and all your argu∣ments tending that way do fall to the ground. This is not the case, neither are we the men, and therefore I shall not need to examine your reasons and allegations against such; nor am I willing to mention these passadges wherein our power seemes to be so much slighted. I dare not believe that you intended all that is held forth in them. I looke at your queries also as raised upon the same mistaken grounds, which being now cleared to you, you will easily resolve yourselves about them. And yet this I will pro∣pound to your consideration, which may be a full answer to them all in the most knotty construction, viz. If our brethren should erre in theire way and thereby bring them selves into distresse, yet (if we must pardon them upon their repentance) sure we may not desert them, nor hide our eyes from theire misery. If any of our confederates (through humane infirmity) should, against their covenant, bring a just warre upon themselves, yet if they call to us for helpe, and tender themselves to equall satisfaction, we must not leave them to destruction. No relation amongst men could stand or be usefull, if meere errour (which we are all continually subject to) might dissolve it, or obstruct the vitall spirit which should breathe in it.</P>
<P>Whereas you object that, in this permission, we make the state but a cypher: I answer, the state hath the same influence into this which it hath into other merchants voyages, by a general and implicit consent, which may be sufficient in so free a state as ours is; where there is no restraint upon persons or ships (but upon speciall occasion) they goe and come at their liberty.</P>
<P>Now for the point of danger. I conceive, first, the rule of the Apostle Peter will hould even in this case; while we do well we are not to be frighted with any terrour. Againe, there is no course or voyage undertaken by us, but
<PB N="130" REF="011300_0068_0F86A01F22F96A38"/>
it may expose the undertakers to perill, and may occasion displeasure and danger to us from abroad; but such dan∣gers have not hitherto deterred us from any probable way of our safety or advantage; nor have we sustained any harme hitherto, by casting ourselves upon the Lord and his good providence, in such cases. I will remember you of some. When we first set up reformation in our church way, did not this expose us to as greate an hazard as we could run, both from abroad and at home? Did not our friends in England, many of them, forewarne us of it ere we came away? Did not others send letters after us, to de∣terre us from it? Did not some among ourselves (and those no meane ones) inculcate our inevitable dangers at home, from no small company left out of church fellowship, and civill offices, and freedome hitherto? Yet we trusted in God (though there appeared no meanes of safety) and went on our way; and the Lord hath still preserved us and frustrated all councells and attempts against us. Againe, when upon grievous complaints against us to the Lords of the Privy Counsel, of such civil innovations amongst us as we could not justify by the laws of that state, a strict order and command was sent to us to deliver up our patent, or else to expect to have it fetched by force, what greater danger could be towards us than appeared in not obeying of this command? Yet we had then courage enough to returne an answer without our patent. When we undertooke a warre against the Pequots, which no ne∣cessity put us upon, but only in point of conscience (they had done us no injury) on others behalfe, there were more objections (in point of dangerous consequences) against that, than against this; our friends of Plimouth complained of it, and wrote to us accordingly; so did our friends of Con∣necticot, laying forth the dangers we had exposed them unto by it, wishing we had forborne to a fitter season; but neither of them protesting against it: Yet, in due time, the Lords hand appeared in it, to the good of the whole country, and we felt but little of those great dangers which were justly to be feared. Our intelligence was believed, which we heard long since, and hath been more certainly
<PB N="131" REF="011300_0068_0F86A01F22F96A38" MS="y"/>
confirmed of late, that the jesuitical State<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They were in great fear of the French when they settled, under Richlieu, at Port Royal and afterwards, when D'Aulnay came to Penobscot. See <HI>Massa. History, V. I. p.</HI> 28.</NOTE> have had an evil eye upon us, and not without cause (as themselves appre∣hend) and though we looke at this as the head of all for∣rein enmity, yet the Lord hath still saved us, and that without any great impression of feare upon our spirits. In the treaty about our confederacie, the doubtful construc∣tion of it in England, the danger from a General Governor (especially in regard of our brethren of Plimouth) the necessity of our being involved in the quarrel with the Dutch, on the behalfe of our brethren of Hartford, were taken notice of by the generall court and many of the elders, &amp;c. yet neither would the court be deterred from entring into that brotherly league, nor were our elders or people troubled with feare of those dangers. And now, lately, when we received Pumham and Sawconoco in to our jurisdiction, the generall court considered how offen∣sive it would be to the Naragansets, and so likely to ingage us in a warre with them; yet, the thing being lawful and expedient for us, and giving hope of opening a doore to the conversion of some of them, they would not let slipp the opportunity of such advantages, for the feare of doubtful dangers. More I might add: All amounts to this summe, the Lord hath brought us hither, through the swelling seas, through perills of pyrates, tempests, leakes, fires, rocks, sands, diseases, starvings, and hath here preserved us these many yeares from the displeasure of Princes, the envy and rage of Prelates, the malignant plots of Jesuits, the mutinous contentions of discontented per∣sons, the open and secret attempts of barbarous Indians, the seditious and undermineing practises of hereticall false brethren; and is our confidence and courage all swallowed up in the feare of one D'aulnay? Admit we should have stepped aside out of our way, doth the favour and pro∣tection of our God wholely depend upon our perfect walking? Were we never out of our way before, under all our former mercies and deliverances? Did Abraham,
<PB N="132" REF="011300_0069_0F86A01F78BCA498" MS="y"/>
Isaack, Jacob, David, Jehosaphat, the people of Israel, Judas, and others, never find protection and deliverance, when, by infirmity, they were found to be out of their way? If they did, why may not we still seeke and hope for the like, seeing the Lords mercies indure for ever? For my part (if there were not other sins, which God may have a controversie with us for) I should little feare any harme from this. If any breach were made in our peace, this is not the way to make it up. We may bring more displeasure and danger upon ourselves, by the divisions and breaches of rule which may be occasioned by our unsea∣sonable striveings about that which is now past remedie, than would otherwise arise from any miscarriage in the busines it selfe, in the worst construction that can be made thereof.</P>

<P>I Received, together with others, two letters from your selfe, concerning the French affaire, and had I not hoped that you should have receaved a finall answer from us longe before this tyme, I should not have been so longe silent, nor shewed soe much seeming neglect, but being now almost out of hope of accomplishing that which was intended, I thought meete to present you with these few lynes.

The truth is, our ayding of Latour was very grievous to many hereabouts, the designe being feared to be unwarrantable by dyvers, as the case stands with us; of which number I confesse I was, and soe still remaine one, and though the business was soe farr proceeded in before wee writt the letter, as (for my parte) I had noe hope of stayeing the shippes, yet some of us thought it might be of good use to intimate that some cautions might be given to those that went, and they be strictly required to observe the same, that soe the undertaking myght be preserved from sinne and the common wealth from damage, soe much as the case was capable of, which cautions if refused, then to sig∣nifie under our hands, our not consenting to the proceed∣ing, with our reasons thereof; but for any protestation against the act, condemning it, we never intended it, but frequently fully and expresly declined it, soe the sending the letter without those cautions and after the shippes were gone, concernes those to answer that did it, for my parte I was much troubled att it so soone as I heard of it.

<P>I Heard nothing further of Glocester busines till the 3d day of this week at even, when I received a letter from Mr. Blinman, together with a complaint of the towne against Griffens companie for several misdemeanors. And at the foote of the complaint a referrence from yourselfe and 3 other magistrates to me, for the redresse of them. I therefore dispatched away a messenger betimes the next morning, with a letter to Mr. Griffen, that he would send me such of his men whose names I had underwritten his letter, to answer to the misdemeanors of sabbath-breaking, swearing and drunkennes: And withall I sent a letter with instructions to Mr. Blinman, with a warrant addressed to the constable. That if Mr. Griffen would not send his men, that the constable should attach their persons and bring them before mee: If they did resist or refuse, not to strive with them nor to use any provoking termes, but to take witnes of their carriadge and to returne mee an answer; which here I have sent you inclosed.

We have, here in Essex, appoint∣ed a day to meet at Salem, viz. the 22d of the next month, to consider of some thinge for the common wealth, ac∣cording to an order of court.

<HEAD>A Declaration of former Passages and Proceedings betwixt the English and the Narrowgansetts, with theire Confederats, wherein the Grounds and Justice of the ensueing Warre are opened and cleared.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Published<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Made publick, I never met with it in print.</NOTE> by Order of the Commissioners of the United Colonies at Boston,
<DATE>the 11th of the 6th Month, 1645.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE most considerable part of the English colonies professe they came into these parts of the world with desire to advance the kingdome of the Lord Jesus Christ, and to enjoy his precious ordinances with peace; and (to his praise they confesse) he hath not failed theire expectation hitherto, they have found safety, warmth and refreshing under his wings, to the satisfaction of theire soules. But they know and have considered that theire Lord and Master is King of righteousnes and peace, that he gives answerable lawes, and casts his subjects into such a mould and frame, that (in theire weake measure) they may hould forth his vertues in theire course and carriage, not onely with the nations of Europe, but with the bar∣barous natives of this wildernes. And accordingly, both in their treaties and converse, they have had an awfull respect to divine rules, endeavouring to walke uprightly and inoffensively, and in the middest of many injuries and insolencies, to exercise much patience and long suffrance towards them.</P>
<P>The Pequotts grew to an excesse of violence and out∣rage, and proudly turned aside from all wayes of justice and peace, before the sword was drawne or any hostile attempts made against them. During those warres, and after the Pequotts were subdued, the English colonies were carefull to continue and establish peace with the rest of the Indians, both for the present and for posterity, as by severall treatyes with the Narrowganset and Mohiggin Sagamores may appeare. Which treaties, for a while,
<PB N="139" REF="011300_0072_0F86A021DE2168D0"/>
were in some good measure duely observed by all the In∣dians; but, of late, the Narrowgansets, and especially the Nyanticks theire confederats, have many wayes injuriously broken and violated the same, by intertaineing and keeping amongst them, not onely many of the Pequot nation, but such of them as have had theire hands in the blood and murther of the English, seizing and possessing at least a part of the Pequot country; which, by right of conquest, appertaines to the English; by allowing or harbouring and withhoulding severall Pequot captives fled from the En∣glish, and making proud and insolent returnes when they were redemanded. And, more lately, the English had manie strong and concurrent Indian testimonies from Long Island, Uncoway, Hartford, Kinnibeck, and other parts, of Miantonimoes ambitious designes, travelling through all the plantations of the neighbouring Indians, and, by promises and gifts, labouring to make himselfe their uni∣versal Sagamore or commander, persuadeing and engage∣ing them, at once, to cut off the whole bodie of the English in those parts. Which treacherous plotts were confirmed by the Indians generall preparations in messages, insolencies and outrages against the English and such Indians as were subjects or friends to them; so that the English colonies, to theire greate charge and damage, were forced to arme, to keep strong watch, day and night, and some of them to travell with convoyes from one plantation to another, and when Miantonimo, in his circular travell, was questioned at Newhaven concerneing these things, instead of other and better satisfaction, he threatned to cutt off any Indians head that should lay such a charge upon him to his face.</P>
<P>The commissioners, by the premisses, observed Mianto∣nimoes proud and treacherous disposition, yet thought not fitt to proceed against him in that respect, till they had collected more legall and convinceing proose.</P>
<P>But while these things were under deliberation, Mian∣tonimo was brought prisoner by Uncas to Hartford, and the case being opened and cleared as followeth, he craved the commissioners advise how to proceed with him.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="011300_0073_0F86A02274C6C1E8"/>It appeared that in a treatie made with the English, at the Massachusetts Anno 1637, Miantonimo engaged him∣selfe not to fight with any of the Indians, and particularly not to invade Uncas without the English consent; and af∣ter in a tripartite agreement made and concluded at Hart∣ford betwixt Miantonimo and Uncas with reference to the English, Anno 1638, in which one of the articles runns, That though either of the said Indian Sagamores should receive injury from the other, yet neither of them shall make or begin warre, untill they had appealed to the English, and till their grievances were first heard and de∣termined, and if either of them should refuse, the English might assist against, and compell the refuseing and obsti∣nate partie.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding which, Miantonimo and his confede∣rates have both forcibly and openly plotted and practised against the life of Uncas not at all acquainting the English or advising with them; but more especially of late, since the forementioned plotts and designes were in hand.</P>
<P>First, a Pequott Indian, one of Uncas his subjects, in the spring 1643, ayming at Uncas life, shot him with an ar∣row through the arme, and presently fled to the Narrow∣gansetts or their confederates, boasting in the Indian plan∣tations that he had killed Uncas. But when it was known that Uncas (though wounded) was alive, the Pequot (taught as was supposed) changed his note, affirming that Uncas had cut through his owne arme with a flint, and had hired him to say he had shott and killed him.</P>
<P>Miantonimo, being sent for by the governour of the Massachusetts upon another occasion, brought this Pequott with him and would have covered him with the former disguise, but when the English, out of his own mouth, found him guilty and would have sent him to Uncas his Sagamore, Miantonimo earnestly desired he might not be taken out of his hands, promising he would send him safe to Uncas to be examined and punished.</P>
<P>But feareing (as it seems) his own treachery would be discovered in a day or twoe, he stopped the Pequotts mouth by cutting off his heade; but at parting he tould
<PB N="141" REF="011300_0073_0F86A02274C6C1E8"/>
the governour in discontent that he would come no more to Boston.</P>
<P>After this some attempts were made (as is reported) to take away Uncas life by poyson, and by forcery; these faileing, some of Sequassons companie (an Indian Sagamore allyed unto and an intimate confederate with Miantonimo) shott at Uncas, with an arrow or two, as he was goeing downe Connecticut river.</P>
<P>Uncas, according to the forementioned treatie (1638) complained, and the English, by mediation, sought to make peace, but Sequasson expressing his dependance on Mian∣tonimo refused, and chose warre. They fought and Uncas had the victory.</P>
<P>Lastly, Miantonimo, without any provocation from Uncas (unless the disappointment of former plotts provoked) and suddenly, without denouncing warre, came upon the Moheg∣gins with 900 or 1000 men, when Uncas had not halfe so many to defend himselfe. Uncas, before the battle, tould Miantonimo that he had many wayes sought his life, and for the sparing of bloud offered by a single combate be∣twixt themselves to end the quarrell. But Miantonimo presuming upon his number of men, would have nothing but a battle. The issue fell contrary to expectation, his men were routed, divers of considerable note slaine, and himselfe taken prisoner.</P>
<P>These things being duely weighed, the commissioners judged that Uncas could not be safe while Miantonimo lived: Wherefore, they thought he might justly put such a treacherous and blood-thirsty enemy to death; but ad∣vised him to doe it in his owne jurisdiction, without torture or cruelty.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The best that can be said of this advice is, that it was politick. Miantonimo was a man of great spirit. The English were in more fear of him than of any other Indian upon the continent.</NOTE></P>
<P>And Uncas, having hitherto shewed himselfe a friend to the English, and in this and former outrages (according to the treatie) craveing theire advise, if the Narrowgansetts or their confederates should, for his just execution, unjustly assault him, the commissioners for the colonies promised to assist and protect him.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="011300_0074_0F86A025A44C09B8"/>Uncas hereupon slew an ennemie, but not the enmity against him. The Narrowgansetts soon fell to new con∣trivements. They pretended they had payd a ransome for theire Sachems life, and gave in particulars to the value of about fourty pounds. This, for a while, call an imputation of foule and unjust dealing upon Uncas: But, in September 1644, the English commissioners, meeting at Hartford, sent for the Narrowgansett Sachems, or theire deputies, desire∣ing they might be instructed to make good theire charge.</P>
<P>Uncas came himselfe; they sent theire deputies. But after due examination it appeared, though some loose dis∣course had passed that, for such quantities of waompum and such parcells of other goods, to a greate value, there might have been some probability of spareing his life, yet no such parcells were brought, and the Narrowgansett deputies did not alledge, much lesse prove, that any ransome was agreed, nor so much as any serious treatie begun to re∣deeme theire imprisoned Sachem; and as for the waom∣pum and goods sent, as they were but small parcells, and scarce considerable for such a purpose, so they were dis∣posed of by Miantonimo himselfe, to sundry persons, for curtesies received during his imprisonment, and upon hope of further favour.</P>
<P>The Narrowgansett deputies saw theire proofes fell farre short of former pretences, and were silent. The commissioners promised that, upon better evidence here∣after, they should have due satisfaction.</P>
<P>Whereupon a truce was made, and both parties were in∣gaged that all hostility should cease till planting time 1645, and after that they would give thirty dayes warning either at the Massachusetts or Hartford before the truce should cease. Yet in February last, the Narrowgansetts by mes∣sengers sent to Boston, declared that unless Uncas would render 160 fadom of waompum, or come to a new heare∣ing within six weekes they would begin the warre.</P>
<P>This crossed the former agreement, and the season was such that neither the commissioners could be advised with, nor could Uncas travel if notice had been given. After which about or before planting time Tantaqueison a Mo∣hegin

captaine who took Miantonimo prisoner was dange∣rously and treacherously wounded, at night, as he slept in his wigwam, and other hostile arts were on both parts at∣tempted in a private and underhand way, as they could take advantage one against the other.</P>
<P>But since the Narrowgansetts have at several times open∣ly invaded Uncas so that Connecticut and New-Haven were forced, according to ingagement, to send men from those colonies for his present defence, but with expresse direction not to begin any offensive warre against the Nar∣rowgansetts or their confederates till further order.</P>
<P>In the mean time, messengers were sent to the Narrow∣gansetts from the generall court in the Massachusetts sig∣nifyeing the commissioners meeteing, promising their grie∣vances should be fully and justly heard; and requiring a cessation of warre in the meane time, but they refused; and heareing, probably, that the English from the Westerne colonies were returned, they made a new assault upon Uncas, and have done him much hurt.</P>
<P>The commissioners being met sent messengers, the second time, both to the Narrowgansetts and Moheggin Indians, minding them of the former treatie and truce, desiring them to send their deputies instructed and furnished with autho∣rity to declare and open the grounds of the warr, to give and receive due satisfaction, and to restore and settle peace.</P>
<P>At first, the Narrowgansett Sachem gave a reasonable faire answer, that he would send guides with them to the Moheggins, and if Uncas permitted he would send his de∣puties to the commissioners, and, during eight dayes, hosti∣lity should cease; but he soone repented of his moderation, tould the English messengers his mind was changed, sent private instructions to the Nyantick Sachem, after the de∣livery of which there was nothing but proud and insolent passages; the Indian guides which the English messengers brought with them from Pumham and Soconoco, were by frownes and threatning speeches discouraged, and re∣turned; no other guides could be obtained, though much pressed; they knew (as they expressed themselves) by the course held at Hartford the last yeare, that the commissio∣ners
<PB N="144" REF="011300_0075_0F86A02639AD59B0"/>
would mediate and presse for peace, but they were resolved to have no peace without Uncas his head, it mattered not who began the warre, they were resolved to continue it; the English should withdrawe theire gar∣rison from Uncas, or they would take it as a breach of former covenants, and would procure as many Moquakes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Maquas or Mohawks.</NOTE> as the English should affront them with; that they would lay the English cattle on heapes as high as theire houses; that no English man should stepp out of his house to pisse, but he should be killed.</P>
<P>They reviled Uncas, charged him with cutting through his owne arme, and saying the Narrowgansetts had shott him; affirmed, that he would now murder the English messengers, as they went or returned, (if he had opportu∣nity) and lay it upon the Narrowgansetts.</P>
<P>The English messengers, upon this rude and uncivill usage, wanting guides to proceed, and fearing danger, re∣turned to the Narrowgansetts, acquainted Pesicus with the former passages, and desired guides from him, he (in scorne, as they apprehended it) offered them an ould Pequot squawe, but would afford no other guides. There also they conceived themselves to be in danger, three In∣dians with hatchets standing behind the interpreter in a suspicious manner, whilst he was speaking with Pesicus, and the rest frowneing and expressing much distemper in theire countenance and carriage. The English messen∣gers, not hopeing for better successe at that time, departed; telling Pesicus, that if he would returne any other answer, he should send it to the English tradeing house, where they intended to lodge that night. In the morning, he invited them to returne, and promised them a guide to Uncas, but would grant no cessation of armes. When they came to Providence, they understood that, in their absence, a Nar∣rowgansett Indian had been there, and faineing himselfe to be of Connecticot, spake in that dialect, but could not put off the Narrowgansett tone. He tould Benedict Arnolds wife (who well understands the Indian language) that the English messengers should not passe to the Moheggins;
<PB N="145" REF="011300_0075_0F86A02639AD59B0"/>
he knew they should have no guides, but should be de∣stroyed in the woods, as they travelled towards Uncas.</P>
<P>Thus the English messengers returned, and the inter∣preter, under his hand and upon his oath, related the former passages, with others lesse materiall, more largely.</P>
<P>Mr. Williams, by the messengers, wrote to the com∣missioners, assureing them that the country would suddenly be all on fire, meaneing by warre; that, by strong reasons and arguments, he could convince any man thereof that was of another mind; that the Narrowgansetts had been with the plantations combined with Providence and had solemnly treated and settled a neutrality with them, which fully shewes their councells and resolutions for warre.</P>
<P>Thus while the commissioners, in care of the public peace, sought to quench the fire kindled amongst the Indians, these children of strife breath out threatnings, provocations and warre against the English themselves. So that unles they should dishonor and provoke God, by vio∣lating a just ingagement, and expose the colonies to con∣tempt and danger from the Barbarians, they cannot but exercise force, when no other meanes will prevaile, to reduce the Narrowgansetts and theire confederates to a more just and sober temper.</P>
<P>The eyes of other Indians, under the protection of the Massachusetts and not at all ingaged in this quarrell, are (as they have expressed themselves to the English messen∣gers) fastned upon the English with strict observation, in what manner and measure they provide for Uncas safety. If he perish, they will charge it upon them, who might have preserved him; and no Indians will trust the English, if they now breake ingagement, either in the present or succeeding generations. If Uncas be ruined in such a cause, they foresee theire heads, upon the next pretence, shall be delivered to the will of the Narrowgansetts, with whom therefore they shall be forced to comply as they may, for theire future safety, and the English may not trust an Indian in the whole country. The premisses being duely weighed, it clearely appeares that God calls the colonists to a warre.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="011300_0076_0F86A027089674B0"/>The Naragansetts and theire confederates rest on their numbers, weapons and opportunities to doe mischief, and probably as of ould, Ashur, Amalek, and the Philistines, with others, did confederate against Israel, so Satan may stirre upp and combine many of his instruments against the churches of Christ: But their Redeemer is the Lord of Hoastes, the mighty one in battaile, all the shieldes of the earth are in his hands, he can save by few or by weake meanes, as well as by many and greate.

<HEAD>Commission and Instructions from the Commissio∣ners of the united Colonies to Maj. Gibbons.</HEAD>
<P>THE Commissioners of the united colonies of New-England being to appoint a commander in chiefe, over all such military forces as are to be sent forth and employed, not only in ayde of the Moheggin sachem, but also against the Narrowgansett and Nianticks and other their confederates, who in making warre upon Uncas the Moheggin sachem contrary to former treaties and agree∣ments, are now become as well our enemies as his in re∣gard of our engagement. The said commissioners hav∣ing sufficient knowledge of the piety, courage, skill and discretion of you Major Edward Gibbones, doe hereby committ unto you the charge, conduct, command and go∣vernment of all the said military forces, with all such armes, and ammunition, provisions and other appurtenances, with all officers thereto appointed, to be ordered managed and disposed of upon all occasions by yourselfe and your coun∣cell of warre, according to the course of military discipline, and according to such instructions as you shall receive from the said commissioners from the time of your setting forth in your march untill your returne, or sufficient discharge sent you from the same authority. You have power also hereby (with advise of your councell of warre) to use and execute martiall discipline upon all offenders and delin∣quents as occasion shall be, by fynes, corporall punishment, and capitall punishments also if need shall require. And all persons whatsoever employed under you in this service, are hereby required to yeeld due obedience and subjection to all your lawfull commands, according to the quality and power wherewith you are hereby invested. You have also power to command and order all such barkes and other vessels which are to be sett forth in the said service, with all seamen, souldiers, ammunition and pro∣visions in them. And the said commissioners doe hereby constitute and appoint Capt. Myles Standish, Capt. John Mason, Capt. John Leverett, Lieut. Robert Seely (or such

You have also power hereby, upon any necessary occasion, to make new officers and to give them titles sutable to theire places.</P>

<HEAD>Instructions for Sergeant Major Gibbones, com∣mander in chiefe of our military forces, and for such as are joyned unto him in a councell of warr.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS you Sergeant Major Edward Gibbones are appointed commander in chiefe of all such forces as are or shall be sent forth of the severall colonies, as by your commission bearinge the date of these presents doth more fully appeare, and whereas there is joyned to you by the same authority, as a councell of warre, divers of your chiefe officers, persons of approved worth and fidelity, as in the said commission they are more fully ex∣pressed: And whereas the cause and scope of this expedi∣tion is not onely to ayde the Moheggins, but to offend and invade the Narrowgansetts, Nyanticks, and other theire confederates, who, upon making warre upon Uncas the Moheggin Sachem, contrary to theire ingagements, are become as well our enemies as his: Yet it being the ear∣nest desire of the commissioners, if it may be obtained with justice, honour and safety, to procure peace, rather than to prosecute warre; it is first commended to your good discretions to take any fitt occasion, or (if with safety you may without any considerable delay or danger to your proceedings) to use meanes to drawe on such a peace,
<PB N="150" REF="011300_0078_0F86A02ADF968858"/>
which you have hereby power to treate and conclude, wherein you are to take due consideration of the charges the colonies have expended in the warre, which you may estimate by the numbers of men sent forth at several times, by their continuance abroad, with wages and provisions appertaineing. And of the damage which Uncas hath sustained since the warre began, wherein it were meete (if it may be done with conveniency) he were consulted with, that both the colonies and he may receive just satis∣faction and repaire; which if the Narrowgansetts cannot presently make, a considerable part may be paid in hand, and the rest by a yearely tribute; but withall, according to our ingagements, you are to provide for Uncas his fu∣ture safety, that his plantations be not invaded, that his men and squawes may attend their planting, fishing and other occasions, without feare or injury; and that Osswo∣mekin, Pumham, Soconoco, Cutchamekin, and other Indians, friends or subjects to the English, be not mo∣lested, which will disturb the peace and draw on further charge and inconvenience. But a peace well framed will hardly be secured, unless either some of the chiefe Sa∣chems deliver their soones as hostages, or that some consi∣derable part of theire country be yeelded to the English for plantations, wherein there may be forts built by the English and maintained (at least in part) by a tribute from the Narrowgansetts, to secure the agreement. And it might probably conduce to the settling or preserving of peace, if a trade were settled betwixt the colonies and them; by which they might be supplied with necessaries, but peeces and powder kept backe, which other traders furnish them with. If you cannot conclude a peace with them, upon the termes above mentioned (to prevent greater inconvenience) you may abate somewhat of our charges, and of the damage Uncas hath sustained: But much care must be taken to secure both our and his future peace, which, if it may be done by raising forts and keeping gar∣risons in the Narrowgansett and Nyantick countries, at theire charge, though we require hostages as above, they may be restored when the fortifications are finished and
<PB N="151" REF="011300_0078_0F86A02ADF968858"/>
theire payments made; and the articles are to be agreed and confirmed by the commissioners for the united colonies at theire next meeting, otherwise to be of no force. But if peace may not be obtained in such a way as is before expressed, you are then with all prudent celerity to prose∣cute with force of armes the said Narrowgansetts and Nyanticks, and all such as shall assist them, until you may (through the Lords assistance) have subdued them or brought them to reason. And if the necessity of the ser∣vice shall require a further ayde of men or provisions (be it one hundred, more or lesse) upon your letters of advise to the Governors of the severall colonies, supplies shall be speedily sent to you, according to the proportion agreed.</P>
<P>You are to make faire warres, without exercising cru∣elty, and not to put to death such as you shall take captive, if you can bestowe them without danger of your owne. You are to use your best indeavours to gaine the enemies canowes, or utterly to destroy them, and herein you may make good use of the Indians our confederates, as you may doe upon other occasions, having due regard to the honour of God, who is both our sword and shield, and to the di∣stance which is to be observed betwixt Christians and Bar∣barians,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It seems strange that men who professed to believe that God hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, should so early and upon every occasion, take care to preserve this distinction. Perhaps nothing has more effectually defeated the endeavours for christianizing the Indians. It seems to have done more: To have sunk their spirits, led them to in∣temperance, and extirpated the whole race.</NOTE> as well in warres as in other negociations. If you find any English stragglers, traders or others, whom you shall suspect to give intelligence or to furnish with armes and ammunition, or to give any other ayde to the enemy, you may secure them and send them to Boston. All other of our countrymen, carrying themselves peacea∣bly and inoffensively, shall be in peace by you, and if you have occasion to make use of any of their boates or vessels, cattle, provision or other goods, you shall be very tender of endamaging them, and you shall give them a ticket whereby they may receive due satisfaction from the colonies, or some of them.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="011300_0079_0F86A02C0F84ABE8"/>When you shall meete with the forces which come from the confederates of Plimouth, Connecticot and New-Haven, or any of them, yourselfe and the councell may order and dispose of them, into such bodies and under such of the commanders as you shall find to be most convenient, and most agreeable to the service, haveing care to give no just occasion of offence or discontent to any of the commanders or officers of any of the colonies.</P>
<P>We doubt not but yourselfe and your councell knowing well how precious the lives and healths of our men are among all our colonies, and how greate charge this warre is like to bring upon us, will be very careful in preserving and husbanding both to the best advantage; so as we shall not need to give you any instructions and directions about the same, but shall rest satisfyed in the confidence we have of your wisdome and faithfulnes to be improved, through the Lords assistance and blessing upon you, in this service, for his owne glory and his peoples safety and prosperity in this wildernes.</P>
<P>If the enemy flie, so that you cannot come to fight with him, it may be expedient that you build one or more forti∣fications in the most convenient places of the Narrowganset or Nyantick countries, into which you may by the helpe of the Indians our friends, gather and preserve the enemies corne and other goods for the advantage of the service.</P>
<P>Lastly, (yet above all the rest) we commend to your christian care the upholding of the worship of God in your armie, and to keepe such watch over the conversation of all those under your charge, as all prophaneness, im∣piety, abuse of the sacred name of God, luxury, and other disorders may he avoyded or duly punished, that the Lord may be pleased to goe forth before you, and prosper all your proceedings and returne you to us in peace, which we shall dailie pray for.</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from Mr. Edward Winslow to Governor Winthrop.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honored Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOURS I long since received in answer of my request in behalf of my friend Mr. Sherley and thanke you for your readines herein. Sir, I had written to you long since, but the truth is I could neither have content in silence or writing, by reason of some unworthy passages in our last generall court, to the great offence of our Gover∣nor Mr. Prence, myselfe, and sundry others. In the middle of October we had two courts successively, the first being the last session of our election court, the other our ordinary quarter court, and both generall courts. Before either of these two, at a court of assistants, other things giving opportunity, the Governor, Mr. Collier, Capt. Stan∣dish, and myselfe being there, took into consideration a matter of great concernment, as we apprehended, and agreed mutually in the thing as necessary to propound it to the generall court, which was the last session of our election court: Accordingly it was propounded, and after a whole daies agitation it was allowed and entred in the waste booke, there being but one deputy against it, and he not direct; save onely, as he thought, it did not properly concerne that court. The next weeke, being in course another of our generall courts, came more of our magi∣strates that live remote and were not with us either at the court of assistants or the foregoing generall court, where this act was done; And after a tumultuous manner except∣ed against the entry of that order, as pernicious and de∣structive to the weale of the government, with very many unseemly termes concerning others, &amp;c. which exception of his was strengthned by 3 other magistrates, one where∣of had joyned with us twice before and now against his own act, bat made beforehand by the first excepter as well as the other two and many of the deputies: They cried
<PB N="154" REF="011300_0080_0F86A02C8B78F748"/>
out to have it defaced and crossed. The Governor Mr. Prence, and myselfe, would not allow it, or any other act, (Mr. Collier being absent to our greefe) to be defaced; but if hereafter it should be found prejudiciall, it might be repealed by another act, but not otherwise. In briefe (for I am ashamed to mention particulars, especially to write them) a promise was made that it should rest till the next generall court and nothing be done in it: And then, when court and country had duly thought of it, if they thought meet to repeale it they might. After this, the first ex∣cepter having been observed to tender the view of a scroule from man to man, it came at length to be tendered to my selfe, and withall, said he, it may be you will not like this. Having read it, I told him I utterly abhorred it as such as would make us odious to all christian commonweales: But at length he told the Governor he had a written proposi∣tion to be propounded to the court, which he desired the court to take into consideration, and according to order, if thought meet, to be allowed: To this the deputies were most made beforehand, and the other three assistants, who applauded it as their Diana; and the sum of it was, To allow and maintaine full and free tollerance of religion to all men that would preserve the civill peace and submit unto government; and there was no limitation or excep∣tion against Turke, Jew, Papist, Arian, Socinian, Nicho∣laytan, Familist, or any other &amp;c. But our Governor and divers of us having expressed the sad consequences would follow, especially myselfe and Mr. Prence, yet notwith∣standing it was required, according to order, to be voted: But the Governor would not suffer it to come to vote, as being that indeed would eate out the power of godlines, &amp;c.</P>
<P>By this you may see that all the troubles of N. E. are not at the Massachusets. The Lord in mercy looke upon us, and allay this spirit of division that is creeping in amongst us. You would have admired to have seen how sweet this carrion relished to the pallate of most of the deputies! What will be the issue of these things our all-ordering God onely knows. Only we know, without him
<PB N="155" REF="011300_0080_0F86A02C8B78F748"/>
it shall never be; and thats our greatest comfort: But if he have such a judgment for this place, I trust, we shall finde (I speake for many of us that groane under these things) a resting place amongst you for the soales of our feet.</P>
<P>I had not thought to have been so long; but if you have heard of the particulars and the persons, especially the ringleader of this rout (if a rout might be in a lawfull assembly) by this generall you may gather the more in∣sight into the particulars. Thus, saluting you and all yours, desireing my due respects may be tendered to your Governor, Mr. Endecott, Mr. Pelham, Mr. Bellingham, Mr. Saltonstall, Mr. Nowell, Mr. Hibbins, and Mr. Flint, desireing your prayers, take leave and remaine,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Worshipfull,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot but out of that respect I owe your selfe pre∣sente my respects to you in these few lines, and to give you to understand how things are here with us; we gott well to this island of Barbados through grace; here I found greate respect since my coming both from the go∣vernment and people, only sorry I have been to heare told me by the governour off this place what our reve∣rend Mr. Dudley should publickly say concerning him. The man seems to me to be wise, moderate in his way and temperate, orthodox in his judgment, and I hope godly, his natural temper is affable and not violente; this take from me as from one that will declare the truth, he would nourish and honour religion according to his light, only heresies (which this island abounds withall) he exposeth.
<PB N="156" REF="011300_0081_0F86A02CF6B124F8"/>
A kind respective friend he hath beene to me, he saith he desires correspondencie with you off New-England, and many able to come hither, as by my letters may appeare; I may be mistaken, but love thinks noe ill and yet not blind.</P>
<P>I am here engaged to preach only for the present, the manner how I refer you to Mr. Wilson, to whome I have wrote and Mr. Cotton.</P>
<P>The island suites very well with my temper hitherto, through bountie, it is now and like to be very wealthy, full of sugar, cotton, indigo, and ginger, some have made this yeare off one acre off canes about 4000 weight of su∣gar ordinarily 3000. Much drought now oppresseth, and I wonder, in the eye off argument, at Gods greate pa∣tience to so profaine a people for swearing and drinking as the vulgar be. It must certenly, in my apprehension, be some strong hand must reforme them.</P>
<P>I would not be tedious to you. There hath this yeare beene brought over 3 commissions, one from the Earle of Warwicke and commissioners with him to command this government to profess themselves for the parliament, and to lay aside their neutralitie. But this they seem not to embrace, but have answered it thus, professing their wil∣lingness to be serviceable to the kingdome, their honour for the parliament, but their yet allegiance to the King, therefore desired to be spared a little till things be settled.</P>
<P>There were one other for libertie of conscience, that they have thus answered, that they are not unwilling not to press any mans conscience in matters of ceremonie, only in regard there are many sects that under pretence off liber∣tie may take occasion to denie all ordinances, and so con∣sequently the Lords day, therefore this they would require of all, to come to the publick preaching, and that shall be sufficient.</P>
<P>There is a 3d, and that is to call the Governor and some off the Councill into question for some pretended acts off injustice here past. And these things to be examined by inferiour persons here, and that not off the best in matter of opinion, and that seems to exasperate.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="011300_0081_0F86A02CF6B124F8"/>For soe much, if I should be demanded how I thinke things will goe here, I would say, I am afrayde when I con∣sider off the profaness off the place, and the divisions that are here and like to be, soe much I certainly would say, had not a man greater arguments to carrie hither and here, for the present, to stay him than temporalls, he would faile. How oft have I thought in my hearte, oh howe happie are New England people!</P>
<P>Not only thus, but even in respect off temporalls, for the common people, that have but meane estates, are very meane in respect of provisions, little flesh if any, noe bread but casader, a bread I approve not off; though its true the rich live high.</P>
<P>The country to my sense is not very hott, but that which I like well off; and a man with about 200 off pounds, in an ordinarie way off providence, might quickly gaine an estate by sugar, which thrives wonderfully.</P>

<HEAD>AN ABSTRACT OF THE LAWS OF NEW ENGLAND.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This piece was printed in London in 1655 and, by William Aspin∣wall the publisher, allowed to have been the performance of Mr. Cotton. It should rather be intitled An Abstract of a Code or System of Laws prepared for the Commonwealth of the Massa∣chusets Bay; for although when they compiled their laws they made this abstract their plan, in general, yet they departed from it in many instances, and in some which were very material. "Considering that these plantations had libertie to mould their civill order into that forme which they should finde to be best for themselves, and that here the churches and commonwealth are complanted together in holy covenant and fellowship with God in Christ Jesus, he did at the request of the general courte in the Baye drawe an abstract of the lawes of judgment delivered from God by Moses to the Commonwealth of Israel, so far forth as they are of moral, that is of perpetual and universal, equity among all nations, especially such as these plantations are; where∣in he advised that Theocracie, i. e. God's government, might be established as the best form of government wherein the people that choose civil rulers are God's people in covenant with him, that is members of churches and the men, chosen by them to be rulers, such also, and the lawes of God and the ministers of God are consulted with by the governor, magistrates and people, in all hard cases and in matters of the Lord, that is of religion, &amp;c. and for the clearing of his judgment with the grounds thereof touch∣ing this matter I wish that some of his sermons to the general court were printed." <HI>M.

The patent, if the corporation had continued in England as was intended, admits of no difficulty in the con∣struction of it. These doubts and questions arise meerly from changing a corporation in England into a common wealth in America. The questions seem not to have been proposed all at the same time, but it appears they were all answered before the year 1646.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>Q. 1. WHETHER the magistrates are by pattent and election of the people the standing counsell of the commonwealth, in the vacancie of the general court, and have power accordingly to act in all cases subject to government according to said pattent and the laws of this jurisdiction, and when any necessary occasions call for action from authority, in cases where there is noe particular ex∣presse law provided, there to be guided by the word of God till the generall courte give particular rules in such cases?</P>
<P>A. 1. The magistrates are by pattent and election of the people, the standing counsell of the commonwealth in the vacancie of the generall courte, and accordingly to act in all cases according to the pattent (pertaining to government) and laws made by the said generall courte of this jurisdic∣tion. This answer is grounded upon sundry passages in the said pattent, as p. 10. where it is said that the Gover∣nor,
<PB N="180" REF="011300_0093_0F86A03B98AE2168"/>
Deputie Governor and Assistants shall apply themselves to take care of the best disposeing and ordering of the ge∣nerall affaires and businesses of for and concerning the lands and premisses and the plantations thereof, and the government of the people there. Alsoe p. 11. it is said that the Governor, Deputie Governor and Assistants, or anie number of them as is expressed, shall be a full and suf∣ficient courte for the handling, ordering and dispatching of all such businesses and occurrences as shall from time to time happen touching and concerning the said company or plantation. And it is said p. 12. that it is in the power of the generall courte to make laws and ordinances for the good and wellfare of the companie, and they may make and establish wholesome laws, statutes and ordinances for the settling of the forms and ceremonies of government and magistracie, and for managing and settling all sorts of officers, superiour and inferiour, and for the distinguishing and setting forth the severall duties, powers and limmitts in every such office and place. 2dly. We doe not find that by the pattent they are expressly directed to proceed ac∣cording to the word of God, but we understand that by a law or libertie of the country, they may act in cases wherein as yet there is no expresse law, soe that in such acts they proceed according to the word of God.</P>
<P>Q. 2. Whether the Governor and Assistants have anie power by pattent to dispence justice in the vacancie of the generall courte, without some law or order of the same to declare the rule?</P>
<P>A. We doe not find in this commonwealth now consti∣tuted by this pattent that the Governor and Assistants have any power to dispence justice in the vacancie of the gene∣rall courte, without some law or order of the same, as the rule of theire administration, which we conceive were meete to be expressed for the regulateing of all particulars as far as may be, when such cannot be supplyed by generall rules.</P>
<P>Q. 3. Whether anie generall courte hath not power in particular cases to choose any commissioners, either assis∣tants or freemen, exempting all others, to give theire com∣mission,
<PB N="181" REF="011300_0093_0F86A03B98AE2168"/>
to sett forth theire power and places by any par∣ticular case, we meane in all things, and in those of all the officers the commonwealth stands in need of between elec∣tion and election, not taking away the peoples liberties in election, nor turneing out any officer soe elected by them without shewing cause?</P>
<P>A. If the tearmes (all thinges) intend or imply all cases of constant judicature and counsell, we answer negatively, viz. that the generall courte hath not power by pattent in all cases to choose anie officers, as commissioners, either assistants or freemen, exempting that is excluding all others, to give them commission, to set forth theire power and places, because it would then follow, that the magistrates might be excluded from all cases of constant judicature and counsell which are theire principall worke, whereby alsoe the end of the peoples election would be made frustrate. 2dly. But if these tearms (all things) imply and intend cases, whether occasionall or other, belonging neither to constant judicature nor counsell, we answer affirmatively, viz. The generall courte hath power by pattent in such particular cases to choose anie officers and commissioners, either assistants or freemen, exempting all others, to give them commission, to sett forth theire power and places, which yet we understand with this distinction, viz. that if the affaires committed to such officers or commissioners be of generall concernment, we conceive the freemen accor∣ding to the pattent are to choose them, the generall courte to sett forth theire power and places; but if the affaires committed to such officers or commissioners be meerely of particular concernment, then we conceive the generall courte may both choose them and sett forth theire power and places. Whereas we give places of constant judicature and counsell to the magistrates, we thus interpret the word (counsell) Counsell consists of care and action; in respect of care they are not to be limited, in respect of action they are to be limited by the generall courte as the supreme counsell. Finally, it is our humble request that if anie difference grow in the generall courte betweene
<PB N="182" REF="011300_0094_0F86A03C13E2B2C0"/>
magistrates and deputies, either in these or anie the like weighty cases which cannot be presently issued with mutual peace, then both parties will be pleased to deferre the same to further deliberation, for the honour of God and of the courte.</P>

<P>Q. 2. Whether by pattent the generall courte, consist∣ing of magistrates and deputies, as a generall courte, have judiciall and magistraticall authoritie?</P>
<P>A. 1. The pattent in expresse words giveth full power and authoritie, as to the governor and assistants soe to the freemen alsoe assembled in generall courte, p. 11. 2dly, Whereas there is a 3 fold power of magistraticall authori∣tie, legislative, judicative, and consultative or directative, of the publique affaires of the commonwealth, for provi∣sion and protection. The 1st of these, namely, legislative, is expressely given to the freemen joyntly with the gover∣nor and assistants, p. 12. Consultative or directative power of the publique affaires of the commonwealth, for provi∣sion and protection, is also granted by the pattent unto the freemen as to the governor and assistants, p. 13. But now for the judicature, if we speake of the constant and usuall administration hereof, we doe not find that it is granted to the freemen or deputies in the generall courte, either by the pattent or by the election of the people, or by anie law of the country. But if we speake of the occational administration thereof we find the power of judicature administrable by the freemen joyntly with the governor and assistants, upon a double occasion, 1. In case of de∣fect or delinquency of a magistrate we find the whole generall courte of governor, deputy governor, assistants and freemen may proceed to remove him, p. 12. 2dly. If by the law of the countrey there lye anie appeale to the general courte or any other special causes referred to theire judgement, it will necessarily inferre that in such cases, by such laws, the freemen joyntly with the governor
<PB N="183" REF="011300_0094_0F86A03C13E2B2C0"/>
and assistants have power of judicature touching the ap∣pealeants and cause, the appeale and those reserved cases. What we speake of the power of freemen, the same may be said of deputies, soe far forth as the power of the freemen is delegated to them by order of law.</P>
<P>Q. 3. Whether we may warrantably prescribe penalties to offences which may probably admitt of variable de∣grees of guilt?</P>
<P>Q. 4. Whether a judge be bound to pronounce sen∣tence as a positive law prescribes, in case it be apparently above or beneath the merit of the offence?</P>
<P>A. 1. Certaine penalties may and ought to be prescribed to capitall crimes, although they may admitt variable de∣grees of guilt, as in case of murder upon prepensed malice and upon sudden provocation there is prescribed the same death in both, though murder upon a prepensed malice be a farre greater guilt than upon sudden provocation, <HI>Num.</HI> 35, 16, 17, 18. with ver. 20 21. alsoe in crimes of lesse guilt, as in theift, though some theift be of greater guilt than other (as for some men to steale a sheepe that hath lesse nede is of greater guilt than for another who hath more nede) the Lord prescribed one same measure of resti∣tution to both, <HI>Exod.</HI> 22.1. 2dly, In case variable circumstances of an offence doe soe much varie the degrees of guilt, as that the offence is raised to a higher nature, then the penaltie must be varied to an higher answerable proportion; the strikeing of a neighbour may be punished with some pecuniary mulct, when the strikeing of a father may be punished with death; soe any sin committed with an hie hand, as the gathering sticks of the Sabbath day may be punished with death, when a lesser punishment might serve for gathering sticks privily and in some need. 3dly, In case circumstances doe soe varie a sinne as that many sinnes are complicated and wrapped up in it, the pe∣naltie is to be varied according to the penaltie of those severall sinnes. A single lye may be punished with a lesse mulct than if it be tould before the judgement seate, or
<PB N="184" REF="011300_0095_0F86A03CB81F1890"/>
elsewhere to the damage of any person, whether in his good name by slander, or in his estate by detriment in his commerce, in which case a lye aggravated by circumstances is to be punished with respect both to a lye and a slander, and to the detriment which another sustaineth thereby. 4thly, In case that the circumstances, which varie the degrees of guilt, concerne only the person of the offender (as whether it were his first offence, or customarie, whether he was inticed thereto or the inticer, whether he was prin∣cipall or accessary, whether unadvised or wittingly and wil∣lingly, &amp;c.) there it were meete that the penaltie should be expressed with a latitude, whereof the lowest degree to be expressed, suppose 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> or as the case may be 5 stripes, and the highest degree 20<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> or 40<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> or stripes more or less, within which compass or latitude it may be free to a magi∣strate to aggravate or mitigate the penaltie as the circum∣stances doe require or alleviate the offence. Yet we would have care be taken that a magistrate attend in his sentence to a certaine rule, as much as may be in those cir∣cumstances, lest some person whose sins be alike circum∣stantiated with another, if his punishment be not equall the one with the other, one may thinke himselfe more unequally dealt withall than another. 5thly, In those cases wherein a judge is perswaded in conscience that a crime deserved a greater punishment than the law inflict∣eth, he may lawfully pronounce sentence according to the prescript penaltie of the law, because he hath noe power committed to him by law to goe higher; but where the law may seem to the conscience of the judge to inflict a greater penalty than the offence deserveth, it is his part to suspend his sentence till by conferrence with the law∣givers he hath liberty, either to inflict the sentence or to mitigate it. 6thly, The penalties of great crimes may be sometimes mittigated by such as are in cheife power, which in this country is the generall courte, out of respect to the publique good services which the delinquent hath done to the state in former times; so Solomon mittigated the pu∣nishment
<PB N="185" REF="011300_0095_0F86A03CB81F1890"/>
of Abiathar for his service done to his father formerly, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 2.26, 27.</P>
<P>Q. 1. Whether the distinction of power and authoritye in magistrates, and only libertie of counsell in the people, be according to the pattent, with respect of the magistrates and deputies in the generall court?</P>
<P>A. We conceive by the pattent, as the people have li∣bertie of counsell, soe they have alsoe other power or au∣thority, as we have expressed in our answer to the two first questions sent unto us by our honoured magistrates.</P>
<P>Q. 2. Whether the generall courte, consisting of magi∣strates and deputies, be not the chiefe power of this com∣monwealth, and to describe the power of magistracy, and to prescribe laws to all, and doe all other acts which belong to such a power?</P>
<P>A. The generall courte, consisting of magistrates and deputies, is the chiefe civill power of this commonwealth, soe as to prescribe the power of magistracy and to pre∣scribe in a civill way lawes unto all, not repugnant unto the lawes of God, nor to the pattent, nor to the funda∣mentall lawes and liberties established in this common∣wealth, and accordingly may doe all other acts which be∣longe to such a power, as namely, both acts of counsell tending to the provision and protection and wellfare of the whole body, and alsoe acts of judgement, soe far as (ac∣cording to our answer to the two former questions of our honoured magistrates) is by the pattent or choice of the people or lawes of the commonwealth reserved to them and seated in them.</P>
<P>Q. 3. Whether our government be a pure aristocracie or mixt with a democracie? If mixt, whether it should not be mixt in all the administrations of the same?</P>
<P>A. 1. Our government is not a meere aristocracy, but mixt of an aristocracy and democracy, in respect of the generall courte. 2dly, Notwithstanding it be mixed in the generall courte, yet it followeth not necessary thereupon,
<PB N="186" REF="011300_0096_0F86A03D84B830E0"/>
that it should be mixed in all other courtes and administra∣tions thereof, because our forme (as all other formes of civill government) is the ordinance of man, therefore as it was free to make it mixed or simple, soe alsoe to make it mixed in the generall courte and united in others accord∣ing to the pleasures of the ordeiners thereof. Accordingly our pattent, notwithstanding it hath made our government mixed in respect of the generall courte, yet it seemes to have instituted subordinate administrations of justice to be aristocratically dispensed by the courte of assistants; yet even in these courtes there is some place for a democratical dispensation in respect of the jurors.</P>
<P>It was voted that all the answers given in by the reve∣rend Elders to the severall questions, were approved just and true answers to satisfaction, except such as are not put to vote.</P>
<P>Prop. 1. That the assistants have noe power to act in judicature without some law of the generall courte to de∣clare the rule.</P>
<P>Elders. That the assistants have noe power to act in judicature without some law, either particularly expressed, or in generall tearms, in defect thereof, enacted by the generall courte as the rule of their administrationes.</P>
<P>Prop. 2. That the generall court consisting of magi∣strates and deputies is the chiefest power of this common∣wealth, and may act in all things belonging to such a power concerning counsell and judicature, namely for making laws, receiving appeals, questioning and sentencing the highest officers, and consulting about the weightiest affaires of the common wealth and in all other cases which in their wisdome they thinke meet to take cognizance of.</P>
<P>Elders. That the general court consisting of magistrates and deputies is the chiefest power of this common wealth, and may act in all things belonging to such a power, both concerning counsell in consulting about the weighty
<PB N="187" REF="011300_0096_0F86A03D84B830E0"/>
affairs of this common wealth and concerning lawes, alsoe concerning judicature in orderly impeaching, sentanceing and removing officers, even the highest according to law, likewise in receiving appeales, whether touching civill or criminall cases wherein appeales are or shall be allowed by the generall court.</P>
<P>Prop. 3. That the magistrate hath not power to vary from the penalties of any law either to mitigate or exceed the same.</P>
<P>Elders. That the magistrate hath not power to vary from the penaltie of any law either to mitigate or exceed the same without consent of the general court.</P>
<P>Prop. 4. That the patent in expresse words giveth full power and authority as to the governor and assistants soe to the freemen also assembled in general court.</P>
<P>Elders. That the patent in expresse words giveth full power and authority as to the governor and assistants soe to the freemen also assembled in general court, or thus, that the full power which is prescribed by the patent and graunted by the general court is not only to the governor and assistants, but also to the freemen there assembled and acting with common consent.</P>
<P>Prop. 5. That certaine penalties may and ought to be prescribed in cases although the offences admit of variable degrees of guilt.</P>

<HEAD>A Remonstrance and Petition of Robert Child, and others.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the worshipful the Governor, the Deputy Governor, and the rest of the Assistants of the Massachusets Bay in New England, together with the Deputyes of the Generall Court now assembled at Boston.</SALUTE>
The Remonstrance and humble Petition of us whose names are underwritten, in behalfe of ourselves and divers others within this jurisdiction, humbly sheweth,</OPENER>
<P>THAT we cannot but with all thankfulnes acknow∣ledge your indefatigable paines, continuall care and constant vigilancy, which, by the blessing of the Almighty, hath procured unto this wilderness the much desired fruits of peace and plenty: While our native land, yea the christian world, is sharply afflicted with the devour∣ing sword and the sad consequents of intestine wars. And further, that you whom the Lord hath placed at the helme of these plantations and endowed with eminent gifts fitt for such honourable callings, are best able to foresee the clouds which hang over our heads, the storms and tem∣pests which threaten this poor handfull here planted, and timously to amend them. Notwithstanding those who are under decks, being at present unfit for higher employments, may perceive those leaks which will inevitably sink this weake and ill compacted vessell, if not by your wisdomes opportunely prevented. We who, in behalfe of ourselves and divers of our Countrymen, laying our hands upon our breasts and seriously considering that the hand of our good God, who through his goodnesse hath safely brought us and ours through the great ocean and planted us here, seems not now to be with us, yea rather against us, blasting all our designs, though contrived with much deliberation, undertaken with great care, and proceeding with more than ordinary probability of successfull events, by which many of
<PB N="189" REF="011300_0097_0F86A03E6D41F3E8"/>
good estates are brought to the brink of extreame poverty, yea at this time laying his just hand upon our familyes, ta∣king many away to himself, striking others with unwonted malignant sicknesses, and with some shameful diseases, have thought it convenient with all respectivenesse to present these our sincere requests and remonstrances to this honor∣ed court, hoping we have found out those speciall leaks, which concurring with many and great sins of this place (which our consciences know and our brethren of England are not ignorant of) are the speciall causes of the Lords turning his face from us, leaving us to ourselves, and con∣sequently to strife, contention, unfaithfulnesse, idlenes, and of lamentable faylings, not blessing us in any of our en∣deavours, so as to give us any great hopes of staple com∣modities, and consequently of comfortable subsistance, though we, to the utmost of our power, these many years, even to the exhausting of our estates and spirits, have en∣deavoured the same; but contrariwise, all things grow worse and worse, even to the threatning (in our apprehen∣sions) of no less than small ruine; not doubting but you will receive them with the same candour of mind which we, not ayming at novelty or disturbance, but at the glory of God, our allegiance to the state of England, and good of these poor plantations (if our hearts deceive us not) present them unto you, though for want of skill and other necessary helpe roughly drawn up; and hope that you will be more diligent in amending than we in searching out the causes of these our present calamities, &amp;c. Not to trouble you who are employed in the most serious affairs of these plantations with many words, we shall briefly re∣ferre them to these heads, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="1">1. Whereas this place hath been planted by the incou∣ragement, next under God, of letteris patents given and granted by his Majesty of England to the inhabitants there∣of, with many privileges and immunities, viz. Incorpora∣tion into a company, liberty of choosing governors, setling government, making lawes not repugnant to the lawes of England, power of administring the oath of allegiance to
<PB N="190" REF="011300_0098_0F86A03F9F137990"/>
all, &amp;c. as by the said letters patents more largely appear∣eth. Notwithstanding, we cannot, according to our judg∣ments, discerne a setled forme of government according to the lawes of England, which may seeme strange to our countrymen, yea to the whole world, especially consider∣ing we are all English. Neither do we so understand and perceyve our owne lawes or libertyes, or any body of lawes here so established, as that thereby there may be a sure and comfortable enjoyment of our lives, libertyes, and estates, according to our due and naturall rights, as free∣borne subjects of the English nation. By which, many in∣conveniences flow into plantations, viz. jealousies of intro∣ducing arbitrary government, which many are prone to beleeve, construing the procrastination of such setled lawes to proceed from an overgreedy spirit of arbitrary power (which it may be is their weaknes) such proceedings be∣ing detestable to our English nation, and to all good men, and at present a chief cause of the intestine warre in our deare country: Further, it gives cause to many to thinke themselves hardly dealt with, others too much favored, and the scale of justice too much bowed and unequally bal∣lanced: From whence also proceedeth feares and jealousies of illegall committments, unjust imprisonments, taxes, rates, customes, levyes of ungrounded and undoing assessments, unjustifiable presses, undue fynes, unmeasurable expences and charges, of unconceyvable dangers through a negative or destructive vote unduly placed, and not well regulated, in a word, of a non certainty of all things we enjoy, whe∣ther lives, liberties or estates; and also of undue oaths, being subject to exposition, according to the will of him or them that gives them, and not according to a due and un∣bowed rule of law, which is the true interpreter of all oathes to all men, whether judge or judged.</P>
<P>Wherefore our humble desire and request is, that you would be pleased to consider of our present condition and upon what foundation we stand, and unanimously concurr to establish the fundamentall and wholesome lawes of our native country, and such others as are no wayes repugnant
<PB N="191" REF="011300_0098_0F86A03F9F137990"/>
to them, unto which all of us are most accustomed; and we suppose them best agreeable to our English tempers, and yourselves obliged thereunto by the generall charter and your oathes of allegiance. Neither can we tell, whe∣ther the Lord hath blest many in these parts with such eminent politicall gifts, so as to contrive better lawes and customes than the wisest of our nation have with great consideration composed, and by many hundred yeares ex∣perience have found most equall and just; which have procured to the nation much honour and renowne amongst strangers, and long peace and tranquility amongst them∣selves. And for the more strict and due observation and execution of the said lawes by all the ministers of justice, That there may be a setled rule for them to walke by in all cases of judicature, from which if they swerve there may be some power setled, according to the lawes of Eng∣land, that may call them to account for their delinquences, which may be a good meanes to prevent divers unnecessary appeales into England.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whereas there are many thousands in these planta∣tions, of the English nation, freeborne, quiett and peacea∣ble men, righteous in their dealings, forward with hand, heart and purse, to advance the publick good, knowne friends to the honorable and victorious Houses of Parlia∣ment, lovers of their nation, &amp;c. who are debarred from all civill imployments (without any just cause that we know) not being permitted to bear the least office (though it cannot be denyed but some are well qualifyed) no not so much as to have any vote in choosing magistrates, cap∣tains or other civill and military officers; notwithstanding they have here expended their youth, borne the burthen of the day, wasted much of their estates for the subsistence of these poore plantations, paid all assessments, taxes, rates, at least equall, if not exceeding others, yea when the late warre was denounced against the Narrowganset Indians, without their consent, their goods were seized on for the service, themselves and servants especially forced and im∣pressed to serve in that warre, to the hazarding of all
<PB N="192" REF="011300_0099_0F86A040552CB338"/>
things most dear and near unto them, whence issue forth many great inconveniences, secret discontents, murmur∣ings, rents in the plantations, discouragements in their cal∣lings, unsettlednes in their minds, strife, contention, and the Lord only knows to what a flame in time it may kindle; also jealousies of too much unwarranted power and domi∣nion on the one side, and of perpetual slavery and bondage on the other, and which is intollerable, even by those who ought to love and respect them as brethren.</P>
<P>We therefore desire that civill liberty and freedom be forthwith granted to all truely English, equall to the rest of their countrymen, as in all plantations is accustomed to be done, and as all freeborne enjoy in our native country; (we hoping here in some things to enjoy greater liberties than elsewhere, counting it no small losse of liberty to be as it were banished from our native home, and enforced to lay our bones in a strange wildernes) without imposing any oathes or covenant on them, which we suppose can∣not be warranted by the letters patent, and seeme not to concur with the oath of allegiance formerly enforced on all, and later covenants lately imposed on many here pre∣sent by the honorable houses of parliament, or at least to detract from our native country and lawes, which by some are stiled foreign, and this place termed rather a free state, than a colonie or corporation of England; all of us being very willing to take such oathes and covenants as are ex∣pressions of our desires of advanceing the glory of God and good of this place, and of our dutyes to the state of England, and love to our nation, being composed accord∣ing to the lawes and customes of other corporations of England; but all of us are exceeding unwilling by any pollicies whatsoever to be rent from our native country, though far distant from it, valuing our free derivations, the immunities and privileges which we and our posterity doe and we hope shall alwayes enjoy above the greatest honors of this country, not cemented to the state of Eng∣land, and glory to be accounted though but as rushes of that land, yet that we may continue to write that we and
<PB N="193" REF="011300_0099_0F86A040552CB338"/>
ours are English; or least we entreate that the bodyes of us and ours (English subjects possessing here no privileges) may not be impressed, nor goods forcibly taken away, least we, not knowing the justice of his warre, may be ig∣norantly and unwillingly enforced upon our own destruc∣tion, and that all assessment, taxes, impositions, which are many and grievous (if civill liberty be not granted) may be taken of, that in all things we may be strangers, other∣wise we suppose ourselves in a worse case here and lesse free than the natives amongst whom we live, or any aliens. Further, that none of the English nation, who at this time are too forward to be gone, and very backward to come hither, be banished, unles they break the known lawes of England in so high a measure, as to deserve so high a punishment; and that those few that come over may settle here without having two magistrates hands, which some∣times not being possible to obtain, hath procured a kind of banishment to some, who might have been serviceable to this place, as they have been to the state of England, &amp;c. And we likewise desire that no greater punishments be in∣flicted upon offenders than are allowed and sett by the laws of our native country.</P>
<P N="3">3. Whereas there are diverse sober, righteous and godly men, eminent for knowledge and other gracious gifts of the holy spirit, no wayes scandalous in their lives and con∣versation, members of the church of England (in all ages famous for piety and learning) not dissenting from the latest and best reformation of England, Scotland, &amp;c. yet they and their posterity are deteined from the seales of the covenant of free grace, because, as it is supposed, they will not take these churches covenants, for which as yet they see no light in Gods word; neither can they clearly per∣ceive what they are, every church having their covenant differing from anothers, at least in words: Yea some churches sometime adding, sometime detracting, calling it sometimes the covenant of grace, sometimes a branch of it, sometimes a profession of the free covenant, &amp;c. notwith∣standing they are compelled, under a severe fine, every
<PB N="194" REF="011300_0100_0F86A042E36F1F08"/>
Lords day to appear at the congregation, and notice is ta∣ken of such who stay not till baptism be administred to other mens children, though denyed to their owne; and in some places forced to contribute to the maintenance of those ministers who vouchsafe not to take them into their flock, though desirous of the ordinances of God, &amp;c. yet they are not accounted so much as brethren, nor publickly so called, nor is christian vigilancy (commanded to all) any way exercised to them. Whence, as we conceive, doe abound an ocean of inconveniencies, dishonor to God and to his ordinances, little profit by the ministry, encrease of anabaptisme, and of those that totally contemne all ordi∣nances as vaine, fading of christian graces, decrease of brotherly love, heresies, schismes, &amp;c. the whole body of the members of the church of England, like sheep scattered in the wildernes, without a shepherd, in a forlorn condition.</P>
<P>We therefore humbly intreat you, in whose hands it is to help and whose judicious eyes discern these great incon∣veniences, for the glory of God and the comfort of your brethren and countrymen, to give liberty to the members of the church of England, not scandalous in their lives and conversations (as members of these churches) to be taken into your congregation and to enjoy with you all those liberties and ordinances Christ hath purchased for them, and into whose name they are baptised, that the Lord may be one and his name one amongst us in this place; that the seales of the covenant may be applied to them and their posterity, as we conceive they ought to be, till incon∣veniences hereby be found prejudiciall to the churches and colony (which we hope shall never be) not doubting but the same christian favour will be shewed to all its members of these churches, when they shall retire to our dear native country (if their conversations be righteous and holy) or otherwise to grant liberty to settle themselves here in a church way, according to the best reformations of Eng∣land and Scotland, if not, we and they shall be necessitated to apply our humble desires to the honourable houses of parliament, who we hope will take our sad conditions into
<PB N="195" REF="011300_0100_0F86A042E36F1F08"/>
their serious considerations, to provide able ministers for us (this place not being so well provided as to spare any) or else out of their charity, many estates being wasted, to transport us to some other place, where we may live like christians and not be accounted burthens, but serviceable both to church and state.</P>
<P>These things being granted, by the blessing of God to us in Christ, we hope to see the now contemned ordinances of God highly prized, the gospell much darkned, break forth as the sun at noon day, christian charity and brother∣ly love, almost frozen, wax warm, zeal and holy emulation more fervent, jealousy of arbitrary government (the bane of all common wealths) quite banished, the wicked, if any such be found, in their courses disheartned, the righteous actors in their wayes encouraged, secret discontents fret∣ting like cankers, remedied, merchandising and shipping by speciall providence wasted, speedily encreased, mines un∣dertaken with more chearfulnes, fishing with more forward∣nes, husbandry now withering forthwith flourishing, vil∣lages and plantations much deserted presently more popu∣lous, all mechanicall trades the great enriching of all com∣mon wealths heartily going on, staple commodities the life of trade presently raised, our almost lost credit regayned, our brethren of Englands just indignation and their force as a post flying from us turned to embrace us, the honour∣able houses of parliament patrons of piety under their wings in these dangerous times with alacrity shrowding us, the privileges and immunities which we and ours enjoy in our native land more firmly settled, forreign enemies day∣ly threatning totally discouraged, unsettled men now a∣bounding firmly planted, that the prosperity of England may not be the ruine of this plantation but the contrary, hands, hearts and purses now streightned freely opened for public and honorable services, strife and contention now rife abated, taxes and sesses lightned, the burthens of the state but pleasure, &amp;c. To conclude, all businesses in church and common wealth which for many years have seemed to go backward, beyond our desert yea expecta∣tion,
<PB N="196" REF="011300_0101_0F86A0438037F438"/>
the good hand of our God going along with us, suc∣cessfully thriving.</P>
<P>And shall always pray the Almighty, the only wise God, to guide you with his wisdom, strengthen you with his power in all your undertakings, that all may be for the glory and good of his people, and that he would blesse your wisdom with the blessing of peace, plenty, and long dayes, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>A Declaration of the General Court holden at Boston 4 (9) 1646. concerning a Remonstrance and Petition exhibited at last Session of this Court by Doctor Child, Thomas Fowle, Samuel Maverick, Thomas Burton, John Smith, David Yale, and John Dand.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Petition and Remonstrance (as they call it) which is the first of the sorte that we have received, and (as we conceive) without president in any plantation or established commonwealth, as will appear by the smale cause of such remonstrance, and as little reason for what is petitioned. We first observe the solemne and religious profession they make of the sincerity and singleness of their end in respect of the glory of God and the good of this colonie, which we have reason to be jealous of with a godly jealousie, when we consider what connexion and affi∣nity there is betweene such greate and glorious ends and the pursuit they make in their remonstrance, so far from truth and righteousness, together with the means they have propounded for attaining the fame. We therefore wish them well and deeply to consider that they have herein to doe with him by whom actions are weighed, whose eyes
<PB N="197" REF="011300_0101_0F86A0438037F438"/>
are like a flame of fire, who will make all the churches knowe that he searcheth the heart and the reines, and will render to every one of them according to theire workes. It were a dreadful dareing presumption, if the blessed name of the most high God (whose honor is so oft avouch∣ed to be theire ayme in this designe) should be made to serve a corrupt project. The next thing we observe is, a divine over-ruling hand leadinge them to a cleare acknow∣ledgment of that truth which cutts the sinewes of theire remonstrance, and justifies our government and all the ad∣ministrations thereof, against all that reproach and blame they endeavour after to cast upon it. The words are these, We cannot but with all thankfulnes acknowledge your in∣defatigable paines, continuall care and constant vigilance, which (by the blessing of the Almighty) hath procured unto this wildernes the most desired fruites of peace and plenty; whilst our native land (yea the christian world) is sharpely afflicted, &amp;c. From which words we inferre these 4 propositions. 1. The government established in this colonie (by the blessing of the Lord) hath beene dispenced and administred, from the first to last, with a speciall and eminent measure of care and watchfullnes upon all occasions. 2dly, By the blessing of the Lord, the government esta∣blished and administred as aforesaid, hath beene a procuring cause of peace and plentie to this colonie. 3dly, By the blessing of the Lord, the government established as afore∣said, and the good effects thereof have beene graunted to us in this wildernes, and that at such a season, while not only our native country, but the christian world, are sharp∣ly visited and afflicted with contrary evills (we may say in this case with astonishment, Not unto us, Lord, but to thy name be the praise, we confesse it is our shame (we desire it may be also our sorrow) that we have not rendered to the Lord according to his great goodnes.) 4thly, The Petitioners (by theire owne confession) have not only no cause to blame this government, or the administration or effects thereof, but are bound with all thankfulnes to ac∣knowledge the good fruites thereof, as wherein them∣selves have had theire share.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="011300_0102_0F86A044353E0528"/>These foure propositions (allowing to the first of them that which humane frailty calls for) are (as we conceive) no lesse evident in the truth of them than in theire depen∣dance upon the petitioners owne words. Yet we observe 3dly, How they sometimes sende forth sweete water and bitter. For in the following passages they speake of leakes, which (they say) will inevitablie sinke this weake and ill-compacted vessell, which they wholly impute to the evills of our government, civill and ecclesiasticall, both in the ad∣ministration and effects thereof. And though in the said propositions, they make us monuments of mercie, prefer∣ring us above our native country, yea above the christian world; yet, in the conclusion they affirme the quite con∣trary; houlding us forth as the scumme and off-scouring, such as our brethren in England, in their just indignation, avoyde as a pest, which they wholely ascribe to the evills of our government. They highly commend the admini∣stration of this government, and yet complaine of an arbi∣trary power, detestable (as they say) to our English nation and to all good men. They commend this government in respect of care and watchfulnes; and yet they speake of many sheepe in this wildernes without shepheard, in a forlorne condition. They largely acknowledge the good effects of this government; and yet cry out of intollerable slavery and bondage. They commend it in respect of peace and plenty; and yet they speake of discontents fretting like cancers, of merchants wasteing, of husbandry wither∣ing, of villages and plantations much desolated, and that all busines both in church and commonwealth have seemed to go backward, and that for many year. They commend it in respect of peace; and yet affirme they have no secu∣rity of theire lives and liberties, but are under a non cer∣tainty of all they enjoy. They commend it in respect of peace; and yet speake of contentions, readie to breake out into a fearful flame, blameing the government as the cause thereof. They commend it in respect of plenty; yet pro∣sesse they are brought to the brinke of extreame poverty, so as they beg of the parliament some help for transporta∣tion
<PB N="199" REF="011300_0102_0F86A044353E0528"/>
to some other place. They professe they owe ac∣knowledgment with all thankfulnes for what they here enjoy; and yet affirme that by reason of unjustifiable, un∣grounded and undue taxes imposed on them, they are in worse condition than the natives themselves. They pro∣fesse such acknowledgment as aforesaid; and yet affirme that they are in such a place, where they cannot live like christians.</P>
<P>These petitioners fabricke being thus overthrowne by theire owne confession and manifest contradictions, we might have throwne out theire petition, as not worthie our further trouble, but lest they should pretend, that theire said thankfull acknowledgment was but a complement, or a piece of theire rhetorick <HI>(ad acquirendam gratiam)</HI> to gaine favour (yet let them consider what we put them in mind of at first, how dangerous it is to engage the greate name of the Almighty, to advance theire corrupt and un∣charitable designes. <HI>(Nec tutum est ludere cum sacris)</HI> It is not safe to dally with things sacred. We will there∣fore, for the petitioners more cleare conviction, and further satisfaction to all the world, examine their particular grie∣vances, and other passages which we meete with in theire remonstrance, &amp;c. and give such account of our government and administrations both civil and ecclesiastical, as none shall be able (we hope) to contradict the truth thereof.</P>
<P>For our government itselfe, it is framed according to our charter, and the fundamental and common lawes of England, and carried on according to the same (takeing the words of eternal truth and righteousnes along with them, as that rule by which all kingdomes and jurisdictions must render account of every act and administration, in the last day) with as bare allowance for the disproportion between such an ancient, populous, wealthy kingdome, and so poore an infant thinne colonie, as common reason can afford. And because this will better appeare by compareing par∣ticulars, we shall drawe them into a parallel. In the one columne we will sett downe the fundamental and common lawes and customes of England, beginning with Magna
<PB N="200" REF="011300_0103_0F86A04537AA80E8"/>
Charta, and so goe on to such others as we had occasion to make use of, or may at present suite with our small be∣ginnings: In the other columne we will sett downe the summe of such lawes and customes as are in force and use in this jurisdiction, shewing withall (where occasion serves) how they are warranted by our charter. As for those positive lawes or statutes of England, which have been from tyme to tyme established upon the basis of the com∣mon law, as they have been ordained upon occasions, so they have been alterable still upon like occasion, without hazarding or weakening the foundation, as the experience of many hundred yeares hath given proofe of. Therefore
<PB N="201" REF="011300_0103_0F86A04537AA80E8"/>
there is no necessitie that our owne positive lawes (which are not fundamental) should be framed after the patterne of those of England, for there may be such different re∣spects, as in one place may require alteration, and in the other not.</P>
<P>For ourselves, we must professe our insufficiencie for so greate matters (as the remonstrants also judge of us) and that in the lawes of England we have but the knowledge of novices, which is mixed with ignorance, and therefore such faileings as may appeare either in our collection of those lawes, or in conforming our owne to that patterne, are to be imputed to our want of skill. If we had able lawyers amongst us, we might have beene more exact.</P>

<P><PB N="208" REF="011300_0107_0F86A04A643D9E50"/>By this it may appeare that our politic and fundamen∣talls are framed according to the lawes of England, and according to the charter; so that the petitioners (if they had not cast off all modesty) must needs be ashamed of this complaint, as also of those which follow, viz. Arbitrarie government, The negative vote, Illimited oathes, Unjust taxes, Illegall committments, &amp;c. For the first, we use to say, Rome was not built in a day: Nay, they could write of it many hundred yeares after, <HI>Tantae molis erat,</HI> &amp;c. Let them produce any colonie or commonwealth in the world, where more hath beene done in 16 yeares. Let them shew where hath beene more care and strife to pre∣vent all arbitrarines, and to bring all judgements to a cer∣taine rule, so farre as may be. Let them confesse theire ignorance of the judiciall proceedings in England, or theire malice which setts them on, to take up any thing to throw at us, though it cutt theire owne fingers, as the practise of England (which they would seeme so much to adhere unto) will most certainely doe, if they looke into any of those courts of judicature (except it be the common pleas) but especially the chauncery (which is the highest court of judicature) the court of requests, the chauncery of the exchequer and of the dutchie, in which courts they are not tyed to the common lawes or statutes of England, but doe judge arbitrarily <HI>(secundum aequum et bonum)</HI> accord∣ing to equitie. If they can give no reasonable answer here (as we are sure they cannot) they must either harden theire hearts or confesse theire guilt, and be as carefull to reforme theire arbitrary obedience, as we are to keepe off arbitrary government. We may say the same for the second, the Negative vote. Sure these men would seeme to have misteries of state in theire heads, and they meane to keepe them there. They tell us of a destructive negative vote, but they neither shew where nor what this daunger is, nor what remedie for it. It may be they have found out a way how a mixt government may subsist with∣out a negative vote, which this court (with all the help of all the elders, and other the wisest in the country, after
<PB N="209" REF="011300_0107_0F86A04A643D9E50"/>
two or three years endeavour) could not attaine; nor would the farre deeper wisdome of the parliament of England ever attempt it (and that these remonstrants are not igno∣rant of) nor doe they affect a democracie. Therefore this must needs be put in only as a fine device <HI>(ad facien∣dum populum)</HI> to please the people. For the third, viz. Illimitted oathes, and covenants not explained by lawe: They should have done well to have tould us what oathes and covenants they meane, for <HI>(dolus versatur in universa∣libus)</HI> deceit lyes hid in generalls. We know no oathes we impose upon any, other than such as are allowed by our charter, and were in practise by the company in London (as occasion required) before we came into these parts. And for covenants of a civill nature, there hath not beene so much as any mention of any such amongst us these many yeares, save only, the last yeare, a motion was made in court of complying with our native country in the na∣tionall covenant there, which was referred to further con∣sideration. As for our church covenant, that shall be spoken to in its proper place. Besides (to prevent all such burdens) we have established a lawe to that end, as appears here before. 5thly, For unjust taxes, there is none that come amongst, us or heare of our condition and affaires, but will marvaile for what purpose such great summes should be raised upon the country, as should occasion this grievance; seeing we attempt nothing of chardge, but what is necessarie, and what the freemen and members of the court contribute unto, as largely as any other. We spend nothing superfluously in buildings, feastings, pen∣sions, public gratuities, officers fees, or the like; nay we are ashamed sometimes at our penuriousnes, but that we had rather beare shame and blame, than overburden the people. Such as are in chiefe office amongst us are con∣tent to live beneath the honour of their places that they might ease the common charge. All our publick expences have beene about some small fortifications, makeing lawes, dispenseing justice, some expeditions against the Indians, who by their injuries and insolencies have provoked us
<PB N="210" REF="011300_0108_0F86A04AF58120D8"/>
thereunto, and some forraigne occasions of late, which accidentally fell upon us. If the remonstrants have knowne of any lavish wasting or mispence of the publick treasure, it had beene fitt they should have mentioned it, otherwise they deale unjustly and injuriously with us, to expect we should provide for theire peace and safety, and yet deny us the meanes whereby we should accomplish it. 6thly, For illegall committments, theire complaint pre∣tends frequencie, otherwise it were not a publick grie∣vance, therefore we conceive they might have produced some cleare instances in this kind. But let them bring forth one: Or let them charge any of the courts or magi∣strates with corruption in theire places, or manifest injustice in theire sentences: Or the government with allowance of any thing that is morally evill. If not; they are impu∣dent slanderers, and deeply guilty of the breach of the 5th commandment which (without serious repentance) God will require of them. 7thly, These remonstrants would be thought to be a representative part of all the non-free∣men in the countrie; but when we have pulled off theire vizards, we find them no other but Robert Child, Thomas Fowle, &amp;c. For first, although their petition was re∣ceived with all gentlenes, yet we heare of no other part∣ners that have appeared in it, though it be four months since it was presented. Againe, we know that divers of the non-freemen have lived some in Virginia and other plantations, where the government hath not been so easy to them as they have found it here. Others have lived in Kent, under the lawes of Gavelkind, more repugnant to the common lawes of England than any of ours. Others have had to doe in maritime affaires; others in causes tes∣tamentrie and matrimoniall; others in the chancery, and others in London and other corporations, and so have found by experience that Englishmen may live comforta∣bly and securely under some other lawes besides the com∣mon and statute lawes of England; and that all the privi∣ledge of a freeborne English subject is his interest in the lawes, without right of election of publick officers, which
<PB N="211" REF="011300_0108_0F86A04AF58120D8"/>
they were never acquainted with there, and yet payd their equall proportions to all publick charges, &amp;c. These non-freemen also are well satisfyed (as we conceive) and doe blesse God for the blessings and priviledges they doe enjoy under this government. They think it is well, that justice is equally administred to them with the free∣men; that they have equall share with them in all towne lotts, commons, &amp;c. that they have like libertie of accesse to the church assemblies, and like place and respect there, according to theire qualities, as also in all neighbourly meetings for maintenance of love, as also like freedome of trade and commerce. So that we have good cause to be perswaded, that there are not many of these discontented remonstrants within our jurisdiction, nor in New England. We are further confirmed herein, when we consider what hard shifts these remonstrants were put unto, to make up the number of seven. The first (and he that must <HI>(ducem agere in hujus militiae)</HI> be the leader in this designe) is a Paduan Doctor (as he is reputed) lately come into the country, who hath not so much as tasted of their grievances, nor like to doe, being a batchelour and only a sojournour, who never payd penny to any publick charge, though (of his owne good-will) he hath done something for publick use. A second, is a church member, but will be no free∣man; he likes better to be cased of that trouble and charge. A third, is a freeman, but no member of any church, and the reason hath beene his professed affection to the hierar∣chie. A fourth, is a clarke of the prothonotaries office, a sojournour also, and of no visible estate in the country, one who hath never appeared formerly in such designe, how∣ever he hath been drawne into this; it is like to be as those who were called by Absolom to accompany him to Hebron. A fifth, is a young merchant, little acquainted with com∣monwealth affaires. We are willing to suppose he might also be one of them, who were invited by Absolom to He∣bron, but sure we are, it is no small griefe to his honoured godly friends to find him there, when they prayed and waited dayly to heare of him in Jerusalem. A sixth was
<PB N="212" REF="011300_0109_0F86A04BE292F3C0"/>
taken up by accident, being none of this jurisdiction, but himselfe and familie inhabiting at Rhode-Island. The seventh, is an ould grocer of London, whose forgetfulnes of the lawes and customes of that citty, and unmindfull∣nes of his dutie to the government under which he now lives and prospers, we may impute to his age and some other infirmities. And these are the champions who must represent the bodie of non-freemen. If this be their head, sure they have <HI>(insulsum caput et non multo sale defaecandum)</HI> an unsavoury head, not to be seasoned with much salt. It may be thought rather that this was some dareing busines at some of their merry-meetings, like that of Sir Roger Williams and the Dutch commander Skencke, who in a vyeing bravery would adventure to fetch the prince of Parma out of his tent in the middest of his army.</P>
<P>Thus have we traced our remonstrants through the civill state, wherein it was easie to follow them by theire ill scent; they are now passing over to the church, but in theire way they will needs observe some notable decay of trade and husbandry, &amp;c. and withall some malignant and noisome diseases among us, and they are bould to deliver Gods councell therein without consulting with his ora∣cles, where they might have learned that all things come alike to all, and as many as I love I rebuke and chastise, and judgment must begin at the house of God (and how then must malignants speed) So as theire imputeing such afflictions to the evil of our government is without rule, nor doe they deale faithfully in their discovery. For although our merchants have sustained some late losses at sea in two or three voyages, yet we have no cause to mur∣mure at the good providence of the Lord, who hath well repaired those losses by his blessing upon us in our fishing and other tradeing abroade, and by the successe he hath given to our labours at home, so as we could spare twenty thousand bushells of corne the last yeare (so much at least being transported) and a good quantity shipped out al∣ready this present yeare. As for those diseases they speak of, it is true (and the Lord teach us to profitt thereby)
<PB N="213" REF="011300_0109_0F86A04BE292F3C0"/>
God was pleased to visit some of our townes the last spring with a more violent fever than ordinary, whereby (as we guesse) some fifty or sixty persons were taken away in a few weekes; but when we consider the nature and strength of the disease, and the weakness of the meanes for pre∣vention or cure, we must acknowledge it a singular testi∣monie of fatherly love, that among so many thousands he tooke away so few, and stayed it so suddenly. And for that shamefull disease they mention, we may see how rea∣die they are to publish any thing to our disgrace. They might have covered this blemish, being the first of this kind that we have knowne in the countrie, and no guilt there∣of lyeing upon the government, or upon the country that we can find. There came indeed the last yeare out of England a lewd person infected with the French disease, who stayed not long with us; but since his departure some others have been infected, but by what meanes we cannot find; the infection spreading by a worke of charitie, in drawing the breasts of one infected, but nei∣ther knowne to them nor to herselfe, that we can learne. But this was more observable (wherein the remonstrants might have seene the good hand of the Lord toward us) that a stranger coming accidentally into the country at that time, who had speciall skill in that disease, through the blessing of God, soone cured them.</P>
<P>These remonstrants are now come to the church doore, when one of theire companie gives them the flipp, not dareing (it seemes) to enter for feare of an admonition. But let us see what exceptions the other side have to our churches, &amp;c. They tell us, <Q>that divers sober, righteous, and godly men, eminent for knowledge and other gra∣cious gifts of the Holy Spirit, no wayes scandalous in theire lives, are detained from the seales, because (as is supposed) they will not take these churches covenant.</Q> The petitioners are sure mistaken or misrepresent the matter; for the true reasons why many persons in the country are not admitted to the seales are these. First, many are fraudulous in theire conversation; or 2dly, noto∣riously
<PB N="214" REF="011300_0110_0F86A04D13FAC6D0"/>
corrupt in their opinions; or 3dly, grosly igno∣rant in the principles of religion; or 4thly, if any have such knowledge and gifts, yet they doe not manifest the same by any publick profession before the church or be∣fore the elders, and so it is not knowne that they are thus qualified. And our churches may not receive men blind-foulded, or upon other mens creditt, when they shall re∣fuse to give account of their faith or repentance, which is so expresly required, 1 Pet. 3.15. Matt. 3.6. Acts 8.37. Matt. 16.16, 17, 18. Few examples (if any) can be given of such as have manifested themselves to be so qualified and yet have beene refused meerely for scrupleing the covenant. And it is justly questionable whether such should be admitted to the seales, who will not be subject to the discipline appointed by Christ in his churches. For what is the covenant but a submitting themselves under the ordinances of Christ, as the same are exercised according to the rule of the word, in that church where such an one joynes as a member? Let a man professedly engage him∣selfe hereto, and (we suppose) our churches will rest satis∣fyed therewith. Our churches are not alone, nor the first that have walked in this way. The like course is held in the French and Dutch churches, and allowed by some of the chiefe patrons of the presbyterian way: As Mr. Rath∣beard, Nar. p. 16. Mr. Rutterford, Due Right, &amp;c. p. 85, 86, 88. Who doe grant, that when a member is admitted, &amp;c. there is alwayes an implicite covenant (at least) which be now comes under. And if so, then what burden or danger can there be to any christians conscience, in ex∣pressing that by his words, which he must acknowledge and binds himselfe unto by his action? unles plain and open dealing be growne unlawfull. They say they see no light in Gods word for such a covenant, which may well be; for it appeares by other passages in theire remon∣strance, that they have small acquaintance therewith, or else like not to come under the power of it. And it ap∣peares also, by the offence they take, to be compelled to attend to it in the publick assemblies. They professe to
<PB N="215" REF="011300_0110_0F86A04D13FAC6D0"/>
approve of the covenant lately imposed by the honourable houses of parliament, and that they are all of them very willing to take such oathes and covenants as are expressions of theire desires of advanceing the glory of God and good of this place, &amp;c. and yet they boggle at the covenants of these churches, which are wholely framed according to the same description. So as it is cleare, it is not want of light (as they pretend) but something in theire owne hearts, which they seeke to cover. For let them stand to that profession, and they can never stick at our covenants. And whereas they say they cannot perceive what our covenants are, because they are not one and the same in every church; they might as well say, they could not un∣derstand our prayers and sermons, because they differ also one from another in forme of words. For the difference of our covenants in the severall churches is no other. In substance (for ought we know) they all agree. And what ever the severall expressions may be, this sufficeth us (which we conceive to be intended by them all) that in this covenant we professe our engagement of relation to God, and one to another, in all the duties which belong to the publick worship of God, and edification one of ano∣ther, according to the rule of the gospell.</P>
<P>Another matter which troubles them is, that they are compelled (under a severe fine) every Lords day to ap∣peare at the congregation. The law which they account so severe is this: Any two assistants may fine or imprison such persons inhabiting here, as shall usually absent them∣selves from church meetings upon the Lords day, so as the fine exceed not 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> for one offence. We cannot conceive that such sober and godly men as these remonstrants speak of, should feare any hurt by this lawe, for sure such persons need not to be compelled to resort to church meetings. Therefore it should seeme rather, that they would pleade for libertie for loose and irreligious persons, or for such as are tainted with such corrupt opinions as doe cause them to cast off all publick ordinances of Gods worship, or else they would not have the civill authoritie to meddle with
<PB N="216" REF="011300_0111_0F86A04DC798C360"/>
men, for matters of the first table; and so they would have the 4th commandment to be ceremoniall, which ex∣presly requires that all within our gates be looked unto, that they doe not violate the Lords sabbath, but sanctify it. And if they would have all men admitted to the seales of Gods covenant, they must either allowe they may be brought to the ordinary meanes of instruction, whereby they may be made fitt for the same; or else they confesse against themselves that they would have them admit∣ted in theire ignorance and profanenes.</P>
<P>They are offended also at our lawe against Anabaptists. The truth is, the great trouble we have beene putt unto and hazard also, by familisticall and anabaptisticall spirits, whose conscience and religion hath been only to sett forth themselves and raise contentions in the country, did pro∣voke us to provide for our safety by a lawe, that all such should take notice, how unwelcome they should be unto us, either comeing or staying. But for such as differ from us only in judgment, in point of baptism or some other points of lesse consequence, and live peaceably amongst us, with∣out occasioning disturbance, &amp;c. such have no cause to complaine; for it hath never beene as yet putt in execu∣tion against any of them, although such are knowne to live amongst us.</P>
<P>Another of their grievances is, that in some places they are forced to contribute to the maintenance of those mini∣sters who vouchsafe not to take them into their flocke. They doe well to restraine this grievance to some places; for it is well knowne, that in many of our churches no such course is used. And sure we are, that none of these re∣monstrants were ever compelled so such contribution. And although the scripture saith the labourour is worthy of his wages, yet there are amongst us some, who live under the ministry of the word, themselves and theire families, yeare after yeare, and yet never contribute the worth of one penny to the maintenance thereof, though they have place in the assembly equall to any of theire ranke, and though the wives of some of them doe commu∣nicate
<PB N="217" REF="011300_0111_0F86A04DC798C360"/>
at the Lords table, and their children are received to baptisme. And whereas they complaine that they are not accounted so much as brethren, nor publickly so called. The truth is, we account all our countrymen brethren by nation, and such as in charity we may judge to be be∣leevers are accounted also brethren in Christ. If they be not publickly so called (especially in the church assemblies) it is not for want of due respect or good will towards them, but only for distinction sake, to putt a difference betweene those that doe commuicate together at the Lords table, and those who doe not. As for that complaint of want of exercising christian vigilancie towards them, it is a most untrue and unjust charge. For it is evident in most places (and for ought we know) in all, that besides the publick prayers and instructions which is common to them with the members of the church, they are admitted (such as will) to private conference and prayers; they are visited in tymes of sicknes, &amp;c. as occasion requires. If any faileing be in particular members in this kind, it is against the mind of the churches and the intent of the civill government. If some duties of church discipline are not exercised towards them, they can blame none but them∣selves, in that they refuse to submitt themselvs thereto.</P>
<P>Concerning the baptisme of the children of such as are not members of our churches, there is an assembly of the elders now in being, and therefore we think fitt to deferr any resolution about that and some other pointes concern∣ing the church discipline, untill we shall understand theire conclusion therein, for further light in these things.</P>
<P>In theire conclusion, these remonstrants prognosticate what peace and felicitie we may certainely expect both in church and common wealth, if theire petition be granted, viz. that every man be left to his owne libertie, and no distinctions or qualifications observed, &amp;c. which they might have illustrated by some examples, which we mar∣vaile they omitted, especially haveing one so neere and fresh; we shall therefore help theire memory. They well know that some eight yeares since, here were a
<PB N="218" REF="011300_0112_0F86A05061BBD570"/>
certaine companie (which were petitioners and remon∣strants also though in another kind) who out of theire tendernes of libertie of conscience, and civill libertie with∣all, made greate disturbance both in church and civill state, but not obtaineing their desire, and fearing such a ruine to come upon us as these remonstrants foresee, they removed to Rhode-Island, where haveing given equall priviledge to all and established this as their basis, &amp;c. that no man should ever be molested for professing his judgment, &amp;c. they thought themselves the onely happy concording people under heaven. But, alas! it was but a dreame; it was not of God and therefore could not stand. For this li∣berty and equallity so fomented naturall corruption, as they presently fell at variance among themselves, and grew into three or foure opposite parts, which continue to this day; and instead of establishing church and civill state have overthrowne both.</P>
<P>Such peace, unity, prosperity, &amp;c. is that which we may expect, if we will cast off the rules of Gods word, the civill prudence of all nations, and our owne observation of the fruite of other mens follies, and hearken to the coun∣sell of these new statesmen. From which the Lord de∣liver us, and all the seed of Israell to the comeing of Christ Jesus. AMEN.</P>

<P>I Had ended as you see what I intended at this tyme, but it being still in my hand I thought good to add a little more. The scope of what I would expresse is, to observe Gods providences in mans motions at this tyme seeme plainly to tend to settle his people here, and to recover new English spirit for Christs kingdome againe.
<PB N="220" REF="011300_0113_0F86A050F946E338"/>
The irregular departure of some causeth a deeper search of heart, wherefore God hath brought his people hither, (I will briefly mention Gods ends, as I conceive them, by and by) and the plotting of others under the alluring notion of liberty, thereby to winne the opinionists and looser sort, causes the solid christians to prize the rare and rich liberty which God hath given them, and they have deerly purchased, (viz. in respect of men in this their great adventure) at a very high rate. Is not government in church and common weale (according to Gods owne rules) that new heaven and earth promised, in the fullnes ac∣complished when the Jewes come in, and the first fruites begun in this part New England, though neglected by many and opposed by some? Now to name what seemes to be Gods ende in bringing his people hether, whatever more there may be which tyme may yet discover.</P>
<P N="1">1. To be an occasion to stirre up the zeale of the two nations to sett upon reformation of religion, and that with good successe.</P>
<P N="2">2. To have liberty and power to sett up Gods owne ordinances in church government, and thereby to hold forth matter of conviction to the episcopacy and others that this way of church government and civill government may stand together.</P>
<P N="3">3. To exercise the graces of the richer sort in a more mixt condition, they shall have the liberty of good govern∣ment in their hands, yet with the abatement of their out∣ward estates. And that the poorer sort (held under in England) should have inlargement.</P>
<P N="4">4. To afford a hiding place for some of his people that stood for the truth while the nation was exercised unto blood.</P>
<P N="5">5. To have an opportunity to trayne up a godly skillfull soldiery, which shortly may be imployed against that blas∣phemous citty. And to these may be added (at least a sprinkling) of godly seamen, formerly rare in the world.</P>
<P N="6">6. To make this place a rendezvous for our deare En∣glish friends when they shall make their voyages to the West Indies, to dry up that Euphrates.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="221" REF="011300_0113_0F86A050F946E338"/>7. To be hopefull instruments in Gods hand to gaine these Indians to Christs kingdome. Which mercy if at∣tained in any considerable measure will make us goe sing∣ing to our graves.</P>
<P>I will also mention the text preached upon at our last fast, and the propositions raised thereupon, because it was so seasonable to New-Englands condition, and so prosecut∣ed, that did you see a coppy I thinke you would desire the sermon to be sett forth in printe for publick advantage.</P>
<P>Jeremy 30.17. For I will restore health to thee, and heale thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord: because they called thee an outcast, saying, this is Zion whom noe man careth for.</P>
<P N="1">1. Prop. That sick tymes doe passe over Zion.</P>
<P N="2">2. That sad and bitter neglect is the portion and ag∣gravation and affliction of Zion in the tyme of its sick∣nes and wounds, but specially in the neglect of those that doe neglect it, and yet notwithstanding doe acknowledge it to be Zion.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the season of penitent Zions passion is the sea∣son of God's compassion.</P>
<P>This sermon tended much to the settling of godly minds here in Gods way, and to raise their spirits, and as I con∣ceive hath sutable effects.</P>
<P>I think the magistrates, &amp;c. may justly long for a happy conclusion of the Synod, that they may attest to the govern∣ment of Christ in his church, and that they may with re∣newed vigor attend the mighty providences in these tymes and opportunities for the advance of Christs cause, the elders being soe zealously sett thereupon.</P>
<P>Sir, its conceived this place will prove either very ho∣nourable or very meene and contemptable, according as religion is attended or neglected.</P>
<P>If you thinke it meete, I pray send also a coppy of their petition found in Dands studdy, its directed to the commissioners.</P>

<P>This gentleman, Mr. John Mainford merchant, is com∣ing to your porte to trade for provisions for the belly, which at present is very scarce, by reason of 5 or 6 months daythe, and not that only, but men are so intent upon planting sugar that they had rather buy foode at very deare rates than produce it by labour, soe infinite is the profitt of sugar workes after once accomplished.

<P>THE Commissioners for the united Colonies have con∣sidered what you have propounded, either by speech or writeing, and find your present state and condition full of confusion and danger, having much disturbance amongst yourselves, and no securitie from the Indians, they desire therefore in severall respects to afford both advice and helpe. But upon perusall of the ancient patent granted to New Plimouth, they find Roade Island (upon which your plantations are settled) to fall within theire lyne and bounds, which the honourable Committee of Parliament thinke not fitt to streighten or infringe, nor may we. If therefore yourselves and the inhabitants, or the most considerable parts of them, upon a due consideration of Plimouths patent and right, acknowledge yourselves within that jurisdiction, we shall consider and advise how you may be accepted upon just tearmes, and with tender respect to your conveniencie, and shall after afford you the same advice, protection and help which other plan∣tations within the united Colonies enjoy, which we hope in sundry respects may tend to your comfort and safety.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>REeceaving a letter from you, notwithstanding the large letter sent by the corporation to yourselves, I cann doe no lesse than give you thanks for your respect therein to myself, and care of mee, least I might sink under the pressure of following the publick busines at my private charge, the time is not as yet come for me to expect any reliefe, there being very little of the collections come into the treasury, more than what hath been ex∣pended in printing, &amp;c. and paying Mr. Jenners library, which I desire may be looked after according to the cat∣talogue sent over. For his necessities pressed us to a pre∣sent disbursement of thirty pounds, and to recover it a∣gaine would be a hard matter, yea too hard for us, he living in Norfolk; but a word is sufficient, it is better to loose some than all. I shall speedily write to Mr. Weld and acquaint him also with the readines that is in the cor∣poration to pay the thirty four pounds to him also (having order so to doe) for his library left with Mr. Elliott, so that I trust that gapp will be soone stopped. The col∣lection is hopefully begun in London, and I believe will arise to a considerable some, but you would wonder to heare the severall sorts of objections that are made against it by men that after all are ashamed to neglect it, as what have we to doe to raise great sumes to promote the gospell among naked people, the gospell is going away from us, and we helpe it forward, we have more neede to support learning at home then abroad; and then our levellers will
<PB N="229" REF="011300_0117_0F86A0575739F410"/>
have nothing to doe to advance humane learning, there is too much of it already; and yett notwithstanding it goes hopefully on, &amp;c. Yesterday (as I am informed) Mr. Cod∣dington<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was in England solliciting for powers of Government for Rhode Island.</NOTE> had something done for him at the counsell of state, which I believe was his pattent confirmed, for the truth is since I perceaved by letters from Plymouth that after another years warning nothing is likely to be done in reference to the old order of lords and commons sent over in (47) as I take it I looked upon it as a vaine thing to strive against the streame, when as indeed that was the maine matteriall objection above a twelve month since, which I could not answer, that we had such an order but never looked after the performance thereof, nor made any retourne upon it, and if I could not then answer it, how much lesse now after another yeare, if not eighteen months expiration, but the will of the Lord must be done; how∣ever I suffer in my reputation here, to make so great a bustle forced, and then to let all fall at last; had I not had particular instructions from Plimouth herein I had never stirred in it, but I shall be more warey heereafter how I ingage in busines of that nature, yet when I have said it, shall not dare to neglect the least service wherein any or all the united colonies are concerned. Here is a great murmuring at the great provisions of powder and shott the severall shipps gett license for, yeare after yeare, 40 bar∣rells of powder and 50 barrells is an ordinary proportion to a shipp, nay sometimes 100, and lead and arms propor∣tionable. Its laid to our chardge, that being custom free, we inrich ourselves by furnishing Barbadoes and Virginia, though enemies, &amp;c. with that and other commodities, and there hath been upon that very accompt a serious debate about revoking our free custome and excise. I have la∣boured in it, and satisfyed many of the Parliament and Counsell of State, of your care not to suffer any powder more than shipps store▪ to be transported away, that we are faine to land all we bring hither for feare of fireing the shipps in the river, and must gett license for that also upon

retourne, that the master is forced to take license for more than he buyes that he may beare out his passengers parti∣cular stores. I have shewed them how many shipps and their lading we have lost for their sakes by the kings party, told them what profitts they had by the retournes of New England, for whether they went for Spaine, Streights, Barbadoes, &amp;c. they all pay custome and excise home; that we only had suffered with and for them and, for their sakes, were hated of all the English abroade. This hath made a present stopp, but I assure you it concernes the countrie to take notice of it and be carefull that our mer∣chants and such as trade thither abuse not the freedom we enjoy, nor know I better to whom to imparte it than to you the Commissioners that are the representatives of the united Colonies.

<P>WE have received yours of the 17th of Aprill past, and therein take notice of your continued respects to this countrie, and uncessant endeavours for promoting the welfare of the poore natives; we have also seene the invoyce of the goods sent,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the use of the Corporation for propagating the Gospel among the Indians, Mr. Winslow being one of the Members in England.</NOTE> which as we understand are taken up at Boston according to the tennor of the bills of lading, and secured by those to whose care you committed them. It is some disadvantage that the prices of the seve∣ralls are not mentioned, which for future you may please to rectifie; we shall endeavour, through the grace of Christ, that what comes to our hands may be improved to the best advantage of the worke, as it comes under our view; and

that such account be kept of the disposall thereof and retourned to you, as may (if not fully answer the expec∣tation of all who are concerned) yet evidence our faith∣fullnes in the trust committed to us. In order whereunto we have deputed Mr. Edward Rawson of Boston as our steward or agent, to receive what is sent, dispose and keep accompts of the same, according to such order as he re∣ceiveth from us, and notice shall be taken, according to your desire, what difference there is in the proofe of the tooles now sent; we shall enquire after the catalogue of Mr. Jenners library, and endeavour that neither your nor our ends may be frustrated. It is apprehended by some that, according to the intent of the act of Parliament, an eye may be had in the distributions to the enlardging the colledge at Cambridge, whereof is great neede, and furtherance of learning not so immediately respecting the Indian designe; though we fully concurre not, yett we desire to know what the apprehensions of the honnored Corporation are here∣in: If the one might receive some encouragement without prejudice of the other, we hope the kingdome of our Lord Jesus, the gennerally professed end of all interested in the worke, may be advanced thereby. It hath been and is the great care of the governments in the severall colonies, that the immunities graunted by the honorable Parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Massa Hist. Vol. I. 114.</NOTE> may not be abused by any of ours, and therein have had a speciall respect to the trade of powder; which we can∣not but fear hath been too exorbitantly managed, by some, though the welfare of the colonies, in many respects, are deeply concerned and hazarded; we shall adde what strength we may to the fences already made, that if no other considerations will prevaile, selfe-concernment may deterre. Though we have not understood that any from us hath been transported to Barbadoes or Virginia; the great inconvenience we lye under is from that mischievous trade of guns, powder, shott, &amp;c. carryed on by French, Dutch, and Swedes, with the Indians, and temptations arising to some of ours thereby, which hath occasioned ma∣ny to urge a setting open that trade amongst ourselves,

conceiving that (as the case stands) the best way to putt a check to that current it now runs so strongly in; but we have been slowe herein, nor dare we yett sett open such a doore, yett could be willing to understand from you what interpretation you conceive would be made by the state there, if restreints, upon the aforementioned consi∣derations, should for a time be taken off. We understand Mr. Eaton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Governor of New-Haven Colony.</NOTE> hath written to you at large about their just title to considerable parts of land on both sides of Dela∣ware bay and river, how they were formerly disturbed in their trade and planting, by force and other unlawfull practices both of Dutch and Swedes, yourselfe may re∣member; and he hath acquainted you with a late unneigh∣bourly and injurious carriage of the Dutch Governor, when at least 50 of New-Haven jurisdiction were on their way to plant there, but were staied, imprisoned and forced to retourne with great losse to those interrested in that designe, and hath desired your helpe in procuring a patent. These things, by a petition from these concerned in the late losse and disappointment, have been recommended to our consideration. We are justly sensible of the dishonour putt upon the English nation by this unjust affront, of our duty to preserve the English title to so considerable a place as Delaware, and that a just repaire and satisfaction be made to those so wronged both in their persons and estates and, from you, desire information what esteem the old pattents for that place have with the Parliament or Coun∣sell of State, where there hath been no improvement hitherto made by the pattentees; whether the Parliament hath graunted any late pattents, or whether in graunting they reserve not libertie and encouragement for such as have or shall plant upon their formerly duely purchased lands; as also how any engagement by the colonies against the Dutch upon the forementioned occasion will be re∣sented by the Parliament, of which we desire information by the first, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from Mr. John Cotton to Lord General Cromwell.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honourable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FOR so I must acknowledge you, not only for the eminency of place and command which the God of power and honour hath called you unto; but also for that the Lord hath sat you forth as a vessell of honour to his name, in working many and great deliverances for his peo∣ple, and for his truth, by you; and yet helping you to re∣serve all the honour to him, who is the God of salvation, and the Lord of hoasts, mighty in battell. I am not igno∣rant that you suffer no small dishonour in the tongues of many, not only as a sectary, but as out of your calling, be∣ing sat on worke (as is pretended) by an usurped power, and yourselfe (with the army) exercising a power destruc∣tive in some cases to the priviledges of parliament, and the liberty and safety of the kingdome. But 3 or 4 principles there be, upon which it seemeth to me your proceedings have been grounded and carryed on, and whein my judg∣ment (reasonable it is) hath been fully satisfyed: 1. That the concessions of the late king never came up to such a posture as whereon to lay a firme foundation of a safe peace, either to church or commonwealth. 2. That when the Parliament was full, and assisted with the commissioners of Scotland (in the treaty at Uxbridge or Newport, or elsewhere) they agreed together that the king could not be restored to his former state upon such termes. And therefore (unles his concessions afterwards in the Isle of Wight were more safe and satisfactory)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is expressed very cautiously.</NOTE> if the Parliament of England voted the contrary afterwards, in a mighty consultation, it was not an act of Parliament, but a praevari∣cation of a former just and lawfull act. And therefore, when the army discerned, not only their owne safetyes, but the safety of religion and state, and their cause and victoryes given in defence thereof, all of them given away in that praevarication, I know not how they could have
<PB N="234" REF="011300_0120_0F86A0593739AE18"/>
approved their faithfullnesse better to the state and cause, then by purging the Parliament of such corrupt humours, and presenting the king to publique tryall. 3. That the army, though they be inferiour and subordinate to the state that giveth them commission and pay; yet neither their consciences nor services are mercenary, though they doe receive wages for their support in the service; though soldiers may take oathes of fidelity to the state, in under∣taking an expedition, yet they, regarding the cause as well as the persons that set them on worke, doe performe their fidelity, if they attend to the cause for which they fight, rather than to the private ends or lusts of such as send them forth. Joab (the generall of Davids hoast) though he went beyond his commission in putting Absalom to death, yet not beyond his fidelity. 4. That when covenants are plighted, which consist of many articles (some principall and fundamentall, others subordinate and accessary) if it so fall out that all the articles cannot be performed without breach of some or other, there may be just cause of re∣penting the undertaking of such covenants; but yet, if some articles cannot be performed without breach of others, the covenanters must chiefely attend to the performance of the principall articles, though (with griefe) they be put to it to violate the subordinate. These things are so cleare to mine owne apprehension, that I am fully satisfyed, that you have all this while fought the Lords battells, and the Lord hath owned you, and honoured himselfe in you, in all your expeditions, which maketh my poor prayers the more serious and faithfull and affectionate (as God helpeth) in your behalfe. In like frame (as I conceive) are the spirits of our brethren (the elders and churches of these parts) carried forth, and the Lord accept us, and help you in Christ.</P>
<P>If you aske upon what structure I have made thus bold to addresse myselfe in these rude lynes to your Lordship, I must acknowledge it is abhorrent from my native bash∣fullnesse to run into the presence of great men: But I received the other day a letter from my reverend brother Mr. Hooker of Newhaven, who certifyeth me that your Lordship made speciall mention of me in your late letters
<PB N="235" REF="011300_0120_0F86A0593739AE18"/>
to him, with tender of loving and more respectfull saluta∣tions than I could expect; withall he moved me to write to your Lordship, as believing you would accept the same in good part. This is my excuse, such as it is.</P>
<P>The Scots, whom God delivered into your hands at Dunbarre, and whereof sundry were sent hither, we have been desirous (as we could) to make their yoke easy. Such as were sick of the scurvy or other diseases have not want∣ed physick and chyrurgery. They have not been sold for slaves to perpetuall servitude, but for 6 or 7 or 8 yeares, as we do our owne; and he that bought the most of them (I heare) buildeth houses for them, for every 4 an house, layeth some acres of ground thereto, which he giveth them as their owne, requiring 3 dayes in the weeke to worke for him (by turnes) and 4 dayes for themselves, and promiseth, assoone as they can repay him the money he layed out for them, he will set them at liberty.</P>
<P>As for the aspersion of factious men, I hear, by Mr. Desboroughs letter last night, that you have well vindicated yourselfe therefrom by cashiering sundry corrupt spirits out of the army. And truly, Sir, better a few and faith∣full, than many and unsound. The army on Christs side (which he maketh victorious) are called chosen and faith∣full, Rev. 17.14. a verse worthy your Lordships frequent and deepe meditation. Go on therefore (good Sir) to overcome yourselfe (Prov. 16.32.) to overcome your army, (Deut. 29.9, with v. 14.) and to vindicate your orthodoxe integrity to the world.</P>
<P>Pardon, I beseech you, my boldnesse and rudenesse, which not arrogancy but due respect and observancy to your Lordship hath put upon me.</P>
<P>The Lord Jesus who is your righteousnesse goe before you, and the glory of the Lord be still your rearward, Isai. 58.8. Thus humbly taking leave, I remain,</P>

<P N="1">1. UPON due consideration and respect of what the honnored deputyes from the illustrious Governor of New-France have informed and upon experience our∣selves have had of the insolency and treachery of some of the barbarians, we can conceive and grant, that the French and those easterne Indians may have just grounds to their owne safisfaction, for a warr against the Mohawks.</P>
<P N="2">2. The English looke upon all such Indians as receive the yoke of Christ with another eye than upon those that worship the Divell.</P>
<P N="3">3. The English desire by all just meanes to keep peace (if it may be) with all men, even with these barbarians.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Mohawkes, living at a distance from the sea, have little intercourse in these parts, but in the warr the English had with the Indians 14 or 16 yeares since, the Mohawkes shewed a reall respect, and have not since done any knowne hostile acts against them.</P>
<P N="5">5. The English engage not in any warr before they have full and satisfying evidence, that in all respects and considerations it is just, and before peace upon just termes hath been offered and refused.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Mohawkes are neither in subjection nor league with the English, so that we can neither require any account of their warres, or other proceedings, nor have we meanes to informe ourselves what they can say for themselves.</P>

Though the English in these jurisdictions are free to performe all neighbourly offices of righteousness and peace, towards the French collonie, yet they foresee they can neither permitt volunteeres or auxilliary forces to be taken up against the Mohawkes, nor that the French or eastern Indians passe through the English jurisdictions, to invade them, but they shall expose both the christian and other Indians and some of the smaller English plantations to dainger.</P>
<P N="9">9. The English are much unsattisfied with that mis∣chievous trade the French and Dutch have had and still continue, selling gunns, powder and shott to all the In∣dians, of which we have dayly complaints, and by which the Indians are animated and apt to grow insolent not only against Indian converts and catechumens, but against the christians of Europe.</P>
<P N="10">10. If the English colonies were assured of the justice of this warre, and engaged with the French to prosecute against the Mohawkes, yet we have no such short and convenient passage either by water or land to approach them, as may be had up Hudsons river, to and beyond Aurania forte, which is in the Dutch jurisdiction.</P>
<P N="11">11. They hope the auncient peace and amitye betwixt England and France will be continued and confirmed, which they both desire and as far as lyes in them shall by all due meanes readily promote.</P>
<P N="12">12. They conceave that the honored deputies have power and authoritie at present to agree and settle a free commerce betweene the English and French colonies in these parts, but if the said deputyes, upon reasons knowne to themselves, see cause to limitt the English colonies to such restrictions, or rather prohibitions as the unpriviledged French are under, that they may not trade till they have first procured a particular licence from the Governor and Councell of New-France, at least till they have issued the
<PB N="242" REF="011300_0124_0F86A05C5418AF10"/>
present differences and settled peace with the Mohawkes, a fitter season for these treaties must be attended, which the Commissioners shall readily improve when it is presented.</P>
<P>The English Colonies, as in the 2d article, are ready upon a fitt opportunity to shew all due respect to all truly converted and christian Indians, and much more than to others, but while they live at such a distance from the En∣glish jurisdictions they neither may promise nor afford them any protection to secure them from dainger.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Massa.

<HEAD>Concerning the life of the famous Mr. Cotton, teacher to the church of Christ at Boston in New-England.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT I have to adde concerning the life of this blessed man of God now tryumphing in glory, to what hath been already set forth by the reverend Mr. Davenport, the worthy pastor of the church of Christ at New-Haven, I shall hold forth in these particulars. 1. Concerning the place of his birth and education, till he went to the university and his abode in Cambridge. 2dly, Concerning his removall from Cambridge to Boston in Lyncolnshire, and what he met with and did there. 3dly. Concerning his departure from thence into New-England, and what service the Lord made him an instrument of in that remote country. For the first,</P>
<P>The place of his birth was the towne of Derby, the most eminent place in that country; his father trained him up to such learning as the schoole afforded, for the fitting him for Cambridge, whither he went when he was very young, at 13 years of age, and was admitted into the famous society of Trinity-College, where he fell soe hard to his studie, and soe profitted in the knowledge of the tongues and arts that he had undoubtedly beene fel∣low there, but that at that time their great hall was then
<PB N="243" REF="011300_0124_0F86A05C5418AF10"/>
in building, which caused such expences to them that the election was put by or at least deferred till some longer time. And this providence I cannot passe by concerning him, that his father (whose calling was to be imployed in the studdy and practise of the law) had not many clients that made use of his advice in law matters before, it pleased God after he was gone to Cambridge, to put his father upon great practise, soe that he was very able to keepe him there and allow him liberall maintenance; insoemuch that the blessed man said, God kept me at the university. From Trinity colledge he removed to Emanuel colledge, the happy seminary of learning and piety, where he was honoured with a fellowship in that society, after a diligent and strict examen, according to the statutes of that house: wherein this is worth the taking notice of, that when the poser came to examine him in the Hebrew tongue, the place where he was to be examined was that in Isai. 3. that speakes against the bravery of woemen, which hath more hard words together than any place in the Bible within soe narrow a compasse, and might have posed a very good Hebrician, but he was very ready at it, and all those difficult words were easy to him. Afterwards he was head-lecturer and dean and catechist in the colledge, and was a diligent tutor to many pupills and very much be∣loved of them: His exercises that he performed in the colledge, whether in way of common-place or dispute, wanted not sinnewes and strength, were highly commended and applauded of those that knew him. The first time that he became famous throughout the whole university, was from a funerall oration which he made in latine for Doctor Some, who was Master of Peter-house, which was soe elegantly and oratoriously performed that he was much admired for it by the greatest witts in the university. After that, being called to preach at the university church called St. Maries, he was yet more famous for that sermon, and very much applauded by all the gallant schollars for it: After that, being called to preach there againe, God helped him not to flaunt, as before, but to make a plain, honest
<PB N="244" REF="011300_0125_0F86A05F30920948"/>
sermon, which was blessed of God to famous Dr. Preston's soules eternal good: His <HI>Concio ad Clerum,</HI> when he tooke his degree for Bachelor of Divinity, which was after he had beene at Boston halfe a yeare or more, was very much admired and applauded more than he desired; his text was out of Math. 5.13. <HI>Vos estis sal terrae, quòd si sal in∣fatuatus fuerit, quo salietur?</HI> In handling of which, both the matter and the rhetorical streighnes, elegancy of phrase, and sweet and grave pronunciation rendered him yet more famous in the university; and soe did his answering of the divinity act in the schools, though he had a very nimble opponent, Mr. William Chappel by name, who disputed with him.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Concerning his removal from Cambridge to Boston in Lyncolnshire, this is to be saide, that his call was good, for their desire was urgent, their need pressed, their assem∣bly of people very great, himselfe very able, and his heart inclining to come to them. At his first coming he found some obstruction from the Bishop of the Diocesse, which was B. Barlow, who told him he was a young man and unfit to be over such a factious people: Mr. Cotton being ingenuous and undervaluing himselfe, thought soe too, and was purposing to returne to the colledge againe; but some of Mr. Cotton's Boston friends understanding that one Simon Biby was to be spoken with, which was near the Bishop,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which some called Simony &amp; Bribery.</NOTE> they pre∣sently charmed him, and so the businesse went on smooth, and Mr. Cotton was a learned man with the Bishop, and he was admitted into the place, after their manner in those dayes. Well, to Boston the good man came, and for 3 yeares he preached and lived soe amongst them, that they accounted themselves happy (as they well might) in the enjoyment of him, both the towne and country thereabout being much bettered by him: But it pleased God, after 3 or 4 yeares being there, that he could not digest the ceremonies that were soe pressed, nor conformity to them, which in some space of time after bred him trouble in the court of Lyncolne, from
<PB N="245" REF="011300_0125_0F86A05F30920948"/>
which he was advised to appeale to a higher court, and imploying Mr. Leverit (which was afterwards one of the ruling elders of the church at Boston in N. E.) to deale in that businesse, and he being a plaine man as Jacob was, yet subtile to get such a spiritual blessing, soe far insinuated himselfe into one of the proctors of the high court, that he sware <HI>in animam Domini,</HI> that Mr. Cotton was a con∣formable man, and so he was restored to Boston; as likewise by the meanes that a gentleman of Boston, called Mr. Ben∣net, used to bring him in againe: After which he was marvelous successful in his ministry, till he had beene 20 yeares there, and in that 20 yeares space, he on Lords-day, on afternoones, went over, thrice, the whole body of divinity in a catechistical way, and gave the heads of his discourse to those that were young schollars and others in that towne, to answer to his questions in publique, in that great congregation, and after their answers he opened those heads of divinity and sweetly applyed all to the edification of his people, and to such strangers as came to heare him: In the morning on the Lords-day, he preach∣ed over the first six chapters of the gospel by John, the whole booke of Ecclesiastes, the prophesye of Zephaniah, and many other scriptures, and when the Lords supper was administred (which was usually every month) he preached upon 1 Cor. 11. and the whole 30th chapter of the 2 Chron. and some other scriptures about the Lords sup∣per: On his lecture dayes he preached through the whole 1st and 2d epistles of John, the whole booke of Solomons song, the Parables of our Saviour set forth in Matthewes gospel to the end of cap. 16. comparing them with Mark and Luke. He tooke much paines in private, and read to sundry young schollars that were in his house, and some that came out of Germany, and had his house full of au∣ditors. Afterwards, seeing some inconveniences in the peoples flocking to his house, besides his ordinary lecture on the 5th day of the weeke, he preached thrice more on the weeke dayes, on the 4th and 6th dayes, early in the morning, and on the last day at 3 of the clock in the after∣noone;
<PB N="246" REF="011300_0126_0F86A0606209DA18"/>
only these 3 last lectures were performed by him but some few yeares before he had another famous col∣league with him, and not many yeares before he left Boston: He alwayes preached at the election of their mayors and at that time when they tooke their oath and were installed in their office; and alwayes (if he were at home) at the funerals of those of the abler sort that died: He was frequent in duties of humiliation and thanksgiving, in which I have knowne him in prayer and opening the word and applying it, 5 or 6 houres, soe indefatigable he was in the Lords worke, and soe ready to spend and be spent for his peoples soules: He was of admirable candor, of unparalleled meeknesse, of rare wisdome, very loving even to those that differed in judgment from him, yet one that held his owne stoutly, <HI>arctè tenens accuratèque defen∣dens,</HI> what himselfe judged to be the truth. He answered many letters that were sent far and neare, wherein were handled many difficult cases of conscience, and many doubts by him cleared, to the greatest satisfaction. He was ex∣ceedingly beloved of the best, and admired and reverenced of the worst of his hearers. Nothing was wanting to make him a compleat minister, nothing lacking to make him a perfect christian, but the perfection of grace which he hath now attained to, and the glory he hath now arrived at. He was a man that was in great favour with Dr. Wil∣liams the Bishop of Lincolne, who admired him for his learning, and (as I have beene told) when he was lord keeper of the great seale, he went to King James, and speaking of Mr. Cottons great learning and worth before him, the King was willing, notwithstanding his non-confor∣mity, to give way that he should have his liberty, to goe on without interruption in his ministry, which was very marvelous, considering how the Kings spirit was carryed out against such men; the mystery of which Mr. Samuel Ward of Ipswich being ignorant of, spake merrily among some of his friends: Of all men in the world I envy Mr. Cotton of Boston most, for he doth nothing in way of conformity, and yet hath his liberty, and I doe every
<PB N="247" REF="011300_0126_0F86A0606209DA18"/>
thing that way and cannot enjoy mine. He had many enemies at Boston, as well as many friends, and some that rose up against him and plotted secretly to undermine him, and others that practised more openly against him; but they all of them were blasted, either in their names, or in their estates, or in their familyes, or in their devices, or else came to untimely deathes, which shewes how God both owned his servant in his holy labours, and that in the things wherein they dealt proudly against him, he would be above them.</P>
<P>One thing more, and I have done with him as he was one of Englands gloryes, and then come to him as over the Atlantique ocean, and in New-England, and it is this; concerning his hospitality, wherein he did exceed most that ever I heard of, and especially his heart and doores were open to receive (as all that feared God, soe) especially godly ministers, which he most curteously entertained, and many other strangers besides; only one minister, Mr. Hacket by name, which had got into the fellowship of famous Mr. Arthur Heildersham, with many other godly ministers, and being acquainted with their secrets, betrayed them into the prelates hands; this man coming into Boston and meeting with Mr. Cotton, the good man had not the heart to speake to him, nor invite him to his house, which he said he never did to any stranger that he knew before, much lesse to any minister.</P>
<P>Concerning the last thing, viz. his departure from Boston to New-England. The times growing perillous, he was envied of some at home and others abroad; and letters missive were come to convent him before the high-commission-court, and a profligate fellow and a filthy for∣nicator, Gowen Johnson by name (who not long after dyed of the plague) was to bring the letters to him, as he did to some others near him, which when Mr. Cotton under∣stood, he looked for nothing from the court but scornes and prison, and therefore with advice from many able heades and gracious hearts, he kept close for a time, and fitted himselfe to goe to N. E. and God bringing him and his
<PB N="248" REF="011300_0127_0F86A06169D5DAA8"/>
company over in safety, through his mercy, after they had beene there a while, there grew some trouble betweene those that were to settle matters in church and common∣wealth, but Mr. Cotton then preaching before the general court an excellent sermon out of Hag. 2. Be strong Ze∣rubbabel, and be strong Joshua, and be strong ye people of the land, &amp;c. it pleased God soe to compose and calme and quiet spirits, that all apprehensions were laid aside, and they went about the worke of the Lord very comfortably and were much encouraged. After which time how use∣full he was to England, to New-England, to magistrates, ministers, people, in publique, in private, by preachings, counsells, dissolving hard knots, and answering difficult questions, all knew, that knew the grace of God soe evi∣dently manifested in him. What scriptures he went over on Lords dayes in expounding and preaching, I cannot certainly say, because I was of another church, serving there according to the grace bestowed upon me; but surely he went through very many, for on his lecture dayes he preached over the whole booke of the Revelation, Ecclesiastes and Canticles, the 2d and 3d Epistles of John, the 2 Epistles of Timothy, with divers others, all which shews the unwearied paines which he tooke in the Lords worke, besides all the bookes that were written by him, and other unknowne labours that he went through. I could speake much more, but at this present want strength, but this I say, he may be a patterne to us all, and happy they that come nearest him, in those things wherein he most followed Christ. I am not like to live to see such another in N. E. though I know God is able to double the spirit of that Elias upon him that succeeds him, and upon many others in our native country and here. It is well for both the Bostons, that they had such a light, if they walke in the light, and continue in that word of Christ and light of grace and truth that he held out to them. I end all with that of our Saviour concerning John-Baptist, he was a burning and shining light, and God graunt the after words be not verified of both Englands
<PB N="249" REF="011300_0127_0F86A06169D5DAA8"/>
and both Bostons. I speake my feares, but would be glad to entertaine better hopes. My prayers shall be that it may never be said as of old, <HI>Fuimus Troes, fuit Ilyum, sed jam seges est ubi Troja fuit.

<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from Mr. Cotton to the Bishop of Lincoln.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Letter is not in order of time but may be considered as an appendage to the foregoing account of Mr. Cotton's life.</NOTE></HEAD>
<OPENER>To the right reverend and my very honourable good Lord, John Lord Bishop of Lincoln, at his pallace in Kurkden, present these. <SALUTE>My very good Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now above twenty yeares agoe, since by the good∣nes of God and (for a good part of this time) by your Lordships lawfull favour, I have enjoyed the happines to minister to the church of God at Boston, a remote corner of your Lordships diocesse. What I have done there, all this while, and how I have spent my time and course, I must ere long give account to the great shepherd of the sheep, the bishop of our soules. Meane while, give me leave to make your Lordship this short account: The bent of my course hath been (according to my weake mea∣sure) to make and keep a 3 fold christian concord amongst the people; between God and their conscience; between true hearted loyaltie and christian liberty; between the fear of God and the love of one another. That wherein I have most seemed to your Lordship to fayle (to witt in not discerning christian liberty to practise some commands of authority, in some circumstances) I doe humbly thanke your Lordship, and freely acknowledge, your Lordship
<PB N="250" REF="011300_0128_0F86A06185FD2078"/>
hath not been wanting freely and often to admonish me thereof, and that with such wisdom and gravity, and with such well tempered authority and mildness, that I profess unfeynedly noe outward respect in the world could have deteyned me from requesting your Lordships favour with ready subjection to your Lordships counsell, that I might have prolonged myne owne peace and your Lordships fa∣vour together, but so it is (my good Lord) though I doe unfeynedly and deservedly honour your Lordship, and highly esteem many hundreths of other reverend divines, great lights of the church (in comparison of whom what am I poore sparke?) who doubt not of their liberty in those matters; yet to this day (I speake in the simplicity of my heart) I can only follow your Lordship with obser∣vance, and them with reverence, but not with that plero∣phory of fayth in these thinges which in such cases the apostle requireth, Rom. 14.5. Your Lordship well knoweth it is both the apostles and prophets principle (and it holdeth in every righteous man from the meanest to the greatest) <HI>Justus ex fide suâ vivit, non alienâ,</HI> and therefore, howsoever I doe highly prize and much preferre other mens judgment and learning, and wisdom, and piety, yet in thinges pertaining to God and his worship, still, I must (as I ought) live by mine own fayth, not theirs. Nevertheless, where I cannot yeeld obedience of fayth, I am willing to yeeld patience of hope.</P>
<P>And now, my good lord, I see the Lord who began a yeare or two agoe to suspend (after a sort) my ministry from that place by a long and soare sickness (the dregs whereof still hang about me) doth now putt a further ne∣cessity upon me, wholly to lay down my ministry there, and freely to resigne my place into your Lordships hands. For I see neither my bodily health, nor the peace of the church will now stand with my continuance there. I doe now therefore humbly crave this last favour at your Lord∣ships hand, to accept my place as voyd, and to admitt there∣to such a successor as your Lordship shall finde fitt, and the patron (which is the corporation of Boston) shall present to
<PB N="251" REF="011300_0128_0F86A06185FD2078"/>
you therefor. The congregation is great, and the church duetyes many, and those, many times, requiring close atten∣dance, and I would be very loth the service of God, or the helpe of the people should be in any sort neglected by my long discontinuance.</P>
<P>What though this resignation of my place into your Lordships hands may be defective in some forme of law; yet I trust your Lordship will never forgett the auncient moderation and aequity of that honourable and high court of chauncery, whereunto your Lordship was advanced, to temper the rigour of legall justice, to the relief of many distressed. Never (I thinke) came there any cause before your Lordship more distressed, nor more justly craving christian aequity.</P>
<P>Now the Lord of heaven and earth soe guide and keep and blesse your Lordship on earth, that he may delight to crown your Lordship with honour in heaven, at the end of your dayes, through Jesus Christ. Thus at once com∣mending my hmmble sute and late vicarage, and the com∣fort of the whole congregation to your Lordships honour∣able favour and integrity, I humbly take leave and rest</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Commissioners of the Massachusetts presented this ensueing letter from the Corporation in England.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letter wee received and returne you this answer, that wee are very glad and approve of the accompts you sent over by the last, which are or may be sat∣tisfactory to the manifold objections have of late arisen about the same, for when (through mercy) our demeanors had stopped the mouths of all men heere, then the greate quere was, whether things sent were not misapplied with you in New-England. And truly you would wonder had wee but time to relate the severall sorts of objections, which for the most part turne all to obstructions for a season; till by the elaborate paines of Mr. Winslow, wee are forced to take off and remove the same, you wrote to us not to send any more goods till you sent for them, and to tye ourselves to such and only such provisions to be sent. We are very well sattisfied therewith, and thereupon shall deceive the expectation of divers, that have written for letters, for printing paper, &amp;c. and indeed in so writing you seem to understand your owne power and trust, but give us leave to tell you there is such a material objection here started as wee are ashamed of and know not how to answer, viz. the manifold com∣plaints made by Mr. Elliot to sundry his friends here, that you allow him but £. 20 per ann. which doth not beare his charges, insomuch as he runnes in debt every yeare more and more, and is disabled for giving his child∣ren that education he otherwise would. Now whether it be or no wee know not, but verily believe the worke will suffer some thousands of pounds by it, for it flyeth like lightning and takes like tinder, men being extreame glad

to meete with any thing may colour over theire covetous∣nes, and dull theire zeale in so good a worke: Nay Mr. Peters who, but fourteene daies before, told Mr. Winslow in plaine termes he heard the worke was but a plaine cheate, and that there was no such thing as gospell con∣version amongst the Indians, presently after, charged the same man upon a letter he received from Mr. Weld, by information from Mr. Elliot that you the commissioners for the united colonies forbad the worke in that you would not allow competent maintenance to Mr. Elliot, and others that laboured therein; and however wee have otherwise charitable thoughts of Peters yett he hath been a very bad instrument all along towards this worke, who (though of a committee in the army for the advance of it amongst them) yett protested against contributing a penny to∣wards it in person, and indeede some of us have been faine to intreate the rest of the gentlemen not to trouble him any further in the busines, nor know wee any cause unlesse it be that the worke is coming to such perfection and he hath not had the least hand or finger in it. These things wee thought good to acquaint you withall; and doe intreate that Mr. Elliott, Mr. Mayhew and such other eminent labourers as are imploied therein may have grea∣ter encouragement from you than so; yea such according to what the Lord shall send in from time to time. Wee are farr from justifying Mr. Elliott in his turbulent and clamorous proceedings, but the best of Gods servants have their faylings, and as such so we looke upon him. The reason you send for nothing this yeare wee conceive is, because you have about 800 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> in money stocke and debts with you, wee should be glad to hear that debts are received, and doe intreate you that the worke may not be retarded thereby; alasse, what pity were it that deserving instruments should be discouraged, and what a shame will it be to us here, besides an absolute period to all future collections, whereby Gods glory and the present opportunity will be lost in doing good to those poore soules; and lett not the late difference betweene your neighbours of the Massachu∣setts

<HEAD>To which Letter the Commissioners returned this following Answer.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honnorable Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOURS of the 18th of February last wee have re∣ceived, with the contents whereof wee are diversly affected; glad that the accompts wee sent do in any mea∣sure answer objections and remove obstructions; he who observeth all our carriage and aimes in this worke of his, knowes (that laying aside all sinister respects wee desire to improve all opportunities and order all disbursements for the advancement of the end designed, that if it please the father of mercies, the gospell of his sone may have a large
<PB N="259" REF="011300_0132_0F86A0672631E0B8"/>
and powerfull entrance into the hearts of these poore In∣dians, but it is an afflicting consideration that the worke should receive any discouragement or hinderance either from Mr. Elliotts penn or Mr. Peters speech. By a letter signed by Mr. Winslow in the name and by order of the honnored Corporation, dated May the 1st 1652, wee un∣derstood what inconvenience did or might grow by the collections and disbursments made by Mr. Butcher not put into the corporation stocke and account, which (with you) wee desired might be brought into your treasury, as the right channell, accordingly wee enquired of Mr. Elliott what somes are sent over yearely upon those more private accounts and how imployed, what part to the Indians, and what to himselfe and others who labour in the worke; he acknowledged some considerable somes of money came that way to his hands, but was slowe to give any account how much or how expended; heereupon wee did conceive that 20 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> per ann. added to what he received by other meanes out of England and what he received from the church of Roxbury (which as we heare is not lesse than 60<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> per ann.) might sufficiently mayntaine his family and afford due education to his children without running him∣self into debt. We shall now allow him forty pounds per ann. and, if there be cause, shall readily enlarge further, and so to Mr. Mayhew; all wee propound is, that as our masters acceptance is sufficient, nay rich wages, for any care or paines of ours in this worke, so there may be some due proportion (as neere as wee can judge) betwixt the imployment and incouragement of other instruments. Through the blessing of him who is love itself and the God of peace, the Commmissioners now mett at Hartford doe comfortably close, as in the affaires of the corpo∣ration, so in the other occasions of the confaederation, and hope they shall so proceede.</P>
<P>Mr. Elliot and Mr. Mayhew doe each of them propound the building a new meeting house for the Indians, besides the building in hand for some schollars at the college (whereof wee wrote the last yeare) and that allowance may
<PB N="260" REF="011300_0133_0F86A0682A09BBE8"/>
be made for interpreters, schoolmasters and others, to in∣struct the teacheable Indians; one catechisme is already printed, and Mr. Pierson is preparing another to suite these southwest parts, where the language differs, from theires who live about the Massachusetts; all which will occasion us to write for a considerable parcell of provisions, as the following invoice will shew; wee expect not so good pennyworths from any as from the Corporation, and though the ammunition were, in different proportions, this last yeare divided amongst the Colonies and by them (with the advance formerly mentioned) since returned into the stocke, yet wee purpose to drive very little or no trade but upon the account and concernment of the Indians.</P>
<P>Mr. Rawson hath sent his accounts for the yeare past to the Commissioners now met at Hartford, but upon peru∣sall wee finde something defective or obscure, so that wee returned them to him to be perfected, and must desire the Commissioners for the Massachusetts to review and upon their approbation to underwrite and send them for Eng∣land. Wee here inclose the coppie of a direction sent us from the Massachusetts for letters for the use of printing, which we desire may be provided and sent. Thus, with our due respects, wee commend yourselves and the worke in hand to the blessing of the only wise and gracious God, resting</P>

<HEAD>Instructions for Major Symon Willard, comman∣der in chief of our forces, and such as are joyned with him as a counsell of warre.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Commissioners were of opinion that it was necessary to enter into a War with the Naraghanset Indians. The Massachusets Colony was averse to it. Willard was a Massachusets man and seems to have defeated the intent of the Commissioners.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>YOU are to take under your charge and command all such forces, horse and foote as, according to the order of the Commissioners, are or shall be levyed, out of three of the Collonyes, with which you are to be at the appoint∣ed randevouz at Tho. Stantons, at or before the 13th of October next, and forthwith to march into the Nianticke countrie to the place of Ninnigrets ordinary residence, and to demand of him (if he may be spoken with) a present and full surrender of all the Pequotts under him, or lately living upon his land, and if he doth not forthwith consent, then to take them by force from him or any that shall har∣bor or detaine them and to remove and settle them under the protection of the English and under such government as Mr. Winthrop, Major Mason and Capt. Dennison shall appoint, till the Commissioners shall take further order, without increasing the tribute formerly due from them.</P>
<P>And further, to require and take of Ninnigret the tri∣bute due for time past, for the said Pequotts, together with the charge of this expedition, or some considerable parte of both, and to give him time for the rest, according to your discretion, as may stand with the honnor of the English and the safety of the countrie.</P>
<P>And you are in the name of the Commissioners to pro∣hibit him and the rest of the Narragansett Sachems to make any further attempts upon the Long Iland Indians, and to assure them that the Commissioners will lay the like charge upon the Long Iland Indians not to invade or di∣sturbe them, which if he refuse, and that the peace of the countrie can by no other meanes be provided for, you are to proceede as the case requires. But if Ninnigret shall not oppose the removall of the Pequotts but shall demeane
<PB N="262" REF="011300_0134_0F86A06844984118"/>
himselfe fairely in that busenes and shall submitt to our charge, and promise that he will not further disturbe the peace of the countrie, wee judge it not expedient at this season of the yeare to beginne the warre upon him barely for the non payment of the tribute and charges, supposing also, that you may use other meanes to drawe some part of it from him at present and the residue may be forborne for some convenient time, provided if the Pequotts cannot be prevayled with to come under the government and pro∣tection of the English, then if Ninnigret shall pay the tri∣bute past and the charges of this expedition, and promise not to disturbe the peace of the countrie for time to come by making warre upon our friends and confederates with∣out our consent, according to his covenant made at Boston anno 1645, as also to pay the tribute for such Indians as are under him for time to come, according to the last agreement at New-Haven 1651, he may enjoy the said Pequotts still without disturbance or any further pro∣ceeding against him.</P>
<P>But if you shall finde the designe cannot be carried on without a great force, then you shall with all expedition send to the severall colonies for the rest of the forces in this case ordered by the Commissioners, which you are to improve according to your best skill for the speedy reducing of Ninnigret to subjection or tribute, with securitie by hostages, for his performance of the same.</P>
<P>And if yett a greater force shall be found necessary, you are to give notice to the severall colonies of the whole number you desire, that they may send theire severall pro∣portions according to the agreement of the Commissioners.</P>
<P>You shall, if you thinke fitt, send to Uncas (whom wee have prepared) to assist you and may be very usefull in the service. You are to make faire warre, without exer∣cising crueltie and not to put to death any whome you have taken captive, if you canne bestow them without dainger of your owne men.</P>
<P>If you finde any English straglers, traders or others, whom you shall suspect to give intelligence, or to furnish
<PB N="263" REF="011300_0134_0F86A06844984118"/>
with armes or ammunition, or to give any other aid to the enemy, you may secure them or send them to Boston.</P>
<P>Lastly, and above all the rest, wee commend to your christian care the upholding of the worship of God in your army and to keepe such watch over the conversation of all those under your charge that all prophanes and im∣piety, abuse of the sacred name of God, luxury and other disorders may be avoyded, or duly punished, that the Lord may be pleased to goe forth before you, prosper all your proceedings and returne to us in peace, which wee shall daily pray for, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>The Narrative follows.</HEAD>
<P>MY selfe, whose name is underwritten, being impowered by the Commissioners of the united Colonies, bearing date the 25th Sept. 1654, doe declare the particular acts of the proceeding of the councill of warre being assembled at Thomas Stantons, according to the instructions received from the said Commissioners, as followeth.</P>
<P>Imprimis, our first instruction being forthwith to march into the Nyanticke countrey, the place of Ninnigrets or∣dinary place of residence, and to demand of him (if he may be spoke with) the Pequotts, &amp;c. The reasons why wee did not attend to that particular was, wee knew he was removed from that place up into the woods into a swamp, some 15 myles from our quarters, and further, by a storm the boates of Conecticott and Newhaven, whereas all were to meete 13 October 54, we say, the boates and some of the souldiers with their stocke of ammunition came not to us untill the 16th day the one, and the 17th day the other. Further, we had one clause in our instructions to act as might stand with the honour of the English and the safety of the countrey, but for us to move with our forces wee thought it would make great rumour to stirr amongst the Indians, when they should heare wee were returned to our quarters and did nothing; therefore wee thought it would expedite our worke to attend that that was presented to us, which are as followeth.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="011300_0135_0F86A068F8A00478"/>First, Ninnegret haveing some of his Indians present with us, who as we supposed were willing to salve up things as well as they could, we agreed to send some of them to him to advise him to come and speake with us, but we haveing intelligence of his great feare to consent to this motion, wee offered him hostages for the security of his person, and if this pleased him not, he should acquaint us what he would desire to secure him; his answer was, by 4 of his men, that one of our Indians had taken away a canoe of his and made prize of it, and upon this he was more afraid than before.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, He demanded what he had done to the English that they came so against him round about, and will not let him alone, and he would desire to transact this busines by messengers, and not come face to face.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, He said his father was a friend to the English in former times, and he wondered they should be so against him now. Our answer to these things were as followeth. First, wee knew nothing of the canoe, and that if any of our Indians had wronged him in this kind they should restore it againe; but they would not forbeare this dis∣course, so wee sent them away with these following an∣swers, First, wee wondered that he, a wise man as he would be accounted, that he should offer to hold us in discourse about such a trifle as a canoe is, either he must be unwise himselfe, or thinke us unwise, if wee should be delayed with such things at these. 2dly, That it was not the fashion of the English to transact things of such a nature by mes∣sengers from an ambassador, but to come face to face. 3dly, If this course might have beene taken, wee could have done this from the place of our habitation, without raising these forces. The 16th, there came some of the Pequotts and told us that, the day before this, they went to∣wards Ninnegretts company to perswade their kindred to come from him, fearing otherwise it would goe ill with them, but they met with three Pequotts that did adhere to Ninegrett, who asked them what they did there, they said they had something to doe; then they asked our Pequotts
<PB N="266" REF="011300_0136_0F86A069B4EE9920"/>
how many there were of them, they said 30, then said the 3 men there are 30 heads for us; then our Pequotts said they did attend the English to carrey letters or burthens abroad, where the English should have occasion to send them, then one of the 3 men told them they would have their 30 heads before to morrow in the afternoone, though the English men were with them, and they said they would not desert from the warr against the Long Islanders, neither would they forsake Ninegrett. This day they came into us and gave in their names to the number of 73. The 17th day there came into us more Pequotts that lived neere to Ninegrett, which, before, wee com∣manded to bring away their houses and goods, which things they did, and gave in their names as the rest to the num∣ber of 36. The 18th day, Ninegrett still keeping off and would no ways comply with us, wee agreed and sent two gentlemen with two to attend them, and two inter∣preters to make some demands of him; but there being sixe he refused to speake with above two of them, but after much debate with his scours and some of his chiefe men, they came to speake with them, viz. Capt. Davis and Capt. Seely, and first they demanded the Pequotts under him, his answer was, why doe yee demand the Pequotts of me when you have them already? they demanded more, his answer was he had not above 3 or 4 with him, but the rest were disposed abroad a hunting and elsewhere, but in the issue he ingaged by writing to surrender all that were under him into the hands of Mr. Winthrop or Capt. Mason within seven days. 2dly, They demanded the tribute due for the Pequotts, his answer was he never engaged for them; he was told he payd it at New-Haven; he said the reason of that was he feared they would have been taken from him, therefore he payd 9 or 10 fathom of his owne peage to make up the some. 3dly, They further required not to make any more war against the Long Island Indians, to this he was silent for a time, but after said this; Shall such a prince and two such captains loose their lives and their blood not be revenged? the answer to this was,
<PB N="267" REF="011300_0136_0F86A069B4EE9920"/>
he must act in a right way by making the commissioners acquainted with it, but he was silent. Further he was charged not to molest them nor any other of the friends of the English lest his head were set up upon an English pole. Also he was informed that none of ours should molest him. 4thly, The charges of this expedition was demanded of him, his answer was he was not the cause of it, but the Long Island Indians killed him a man at Connecticott.</P>

<P>ABOUT twelve days since I wrote to you by Capt. Collens, wherein I gave you a large account of our proceedings in this island of the Barbadoes; how that by Gods blessing we attained our passage in five weekes, made the 2500 men we landed 6000, and because our stores for the army were not as yet come up close we should lose the drie season and my lords honor suffer there∣by and have scrabled up so many arms as to make the 1500, we here brought, 6000 or near thereabout: that we raised two small troopes of horse upon the island and gotten such and so many other stores as we are to sett saile this evening from the place: We thought to have gone the 24th in∣stant but could not attaine thereunto. Since which time came Capt. Hassefield of London and tells us of the Great Charity, that she was at sea with him; but saies that she with many others in company were forced back by the fowle weather. This gentleman was above two months, from Falmouth hither, and tells us our storeships were in the Downes with a safe convoy and believes they will
<PB N="269" REF="011300_0137_0F86A06A821B6208"/>
be here speedily; but truly, Sir, we are so weary of wayt∣ing and the season so neer spent as we are resolved to cast ourselves into the arms of Almighty God, whose providence we trust will be ever for good and will owne us as instru∣ments in his right hand to execute his determined ven∣geance upon that tyrannous and idolatrous and bloudy nation that hath inflicted so many cruelties upon the nations of the earth in their distressed members and not the least upon ours. We have agreed to order the Great Charity to stay heer till our stores come up and then to convey them to us. The general hath settled the militia of the island and given commission to fowre regiments of horse and fowre of foote and made the governor his lieutenant-generall and Col. Collison major-generall of this island. I hope it will conduce to the publick weale of the place. We have made bold to refer our commissioners to make use of their excise office whereof the governor had a 3d, which 3d we still leave him to possesse; but whereas they call upon their articles I tell them they have broken that article, for whereas they were to pay the publick debts of the island therewith they have received all those two yeares profitts past and we none at all, and now we shall reape the cropp of this 3d yeare, but with a greate deale of indigna∣tion to many. We aske them how long his highnes shall waite their pleasure to receive his royalties?

<OPENER><SALUTE>Loveing friend Major Willard,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WEE have received and considered both the letter you writt and the trust committed to you, and the account thereof, the last yeare, in which (to speake can∣didly according to your desire) wee finde mistakes and er∣rours, we heare you had not the unanimous consent of your councill, and certainly your instructions (which stand upon record in each of the united colonies) are cleare enough to have guided you to a further progresse than you made in the service, nor doe wee finde any considera∣ble difficultie in the way. Ninigrett, through the feare that then possessed him, might (in all probability) have been enforced to receive any impression the chief com∣mander of such forces would have putt upon him, but the not improving of a season (especially in such a service) is oft attended with mischievous consequences. Ninegrett, who whilst our smale army was there, had his mouth as in the dust, soone after grew high and insolent in his speech and carriage, refuseth to deliver the rest of his Pequotts, threatens them that have left him, hath againe invaded the Long Island Indians, our friends, tributaries and in cove∣nant with us; some blood is already shed, how much more may be shortly shed is not yet knowne, and how farr our charge and danger may be increased by his pride and trea∣chery ingaging forreign Indians against us, and what fur∣ther inconveniences may arrise from your nonattendance to your commission is yet uncertaine, and as doubtfull how they may be prevented; but what satisfaction may be from yourselfe, and those of your councill that joyned with you, expected, wee leave to the consideration of the colonies and rest</P>

<P N="1">1. YOU are desired to take the first convenient oppor∣tunitie to present the letter from this Court (heerewith delivered) unto his Highnes. And upon all

<P N="3">3. That you also humbly desire on our behalfe that seeing our former agent is dead, and we have many ene∣mies in the world, that all complaints made against us by one or other may take no place in his princely breast, but be suspended from all beliefe till we may have knowledge thereof and opportunitie to answer for ourselves.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Providence,
<DATE>15. 9mo. 55.</DATE>
(so called)</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Much honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is my humble and earnest petition unto God and you, that you may so be pleased to exercise command over your own spirits that you may not mind myselfe nor the English of these parts (unworthy with myself of your eye) but only that face of equitie (English and christian) which I humbly hope may appeare in these representations following.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="011300_0141_0F86A070745B36A8"/>First, May it please you to remember, that concerning the town of Warwick (in this colonie) there lies a suite of £. 2000 dammages against you before his highnes and the lords of his councell, I doubt not if you so please but that (as Mr. Winslow and myself had well nigh ordered it) some gentlemen from yourselves and some from Warwick deputed, may friendly and easily determine that affair be∣tweene you.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Indians which pretend your name at Warwick and Pawtuxet (and yet live as barbarously if not more than any in the country) please you to know their insolences upon ourselves and cattell (unto £. 20 dammages per annum) are insufferable by English spirits; and please you to give credence that to all these they pretend your name and affirme that they dare not (for offending you) agree with us, nor come to rules of righteous neighbour∣hood, only they know you favour us not and therefore send us for redresse unto you.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Concerning four English families at Paw∣tuxet, may it please you to remember that two controversies they have long (under your name) maintained with us, to a constant obstructing of all order and authoritie amongst us.</P>
<P>To our complaint about our lands they lately have pro∣fest a willingnes to arbitrate, but to obey his highnes au∣thoritie in this charter, they say, they dare not for your sakes, though they live not by your lawes, nor bear your common charges nor ours, but evade both under colour of your authoritie.</P>
<P>Honoured Sirs, I cordially prosesse it before the most high, that I believe it, if not only they but ourselves and all the whole country, by joint consent, were subject to your government, it might be a rich mercy; but as things yet are, and since it pleased first the parliament, and then the lord admirall and committee for foraigne plantations, and since the councell of state, and lastly the lord pro∣tector and his councell, to continue us as a distinct colonie, yea and since it hath pleased yourselves by publick letters and references to us from your publick courts to owne
<PB N="277" REF="011300_0141_0F86A070745B36A8"/>
the authoritie of his Highnes amongst us; be pleased to consider how unsuitable it is for yourselves (if these fami∣lies at Pawtuxet plead truth) to be the obstructers of all orderly proceedings amongst us; for I humbly appeale to your owne wisedomes and experience how unlikely it is for a people to be compelled to order and common charges, when others in their bosoms are by such (seeming) par∣tialitie exempted from both.</P>
<P>And therefore (lastly) be pleased to know, that there are (upon the point) but two families which are so ob∣structive and destructive to an equall proceeding of civill order amongst us; for one of these 4 families, Stephen Arnold, desires to be uniforme with us; a second Zacharie Rhodes, being in the way of dipping is (potentially) banish∣ed by you. Only Wm. Arnold and Wm. Carpenter (very far allso in religion from you, if you knew all) they have some coulour, yet in a late conference they all plead that all the obstacle is their offending of yourselves.</P>
<P>Fourthly, whereas (I humbly conceave) with the peo∣ple of this colonie your commerce is as great as with any in the countrey, and our dangers (being a frontier people to the Barbarians) are greater than those of other colonies, and the ill consequences to yourselves would be not a few nor small, and to the whole land, were we first massacred or mastered by them. I pray your aequall and favourable reflection upon that your law which prohibits us to buy of you all meanes of our necessary defence of our lives and families (yea in this most bloudy and massacring time.)</P>
<P>We are informed that tickets have rarely bene denied to any English of the country; yea the barbarians (tho' notorious in lyes) if they professe subjection, they are fur∣nished: Only ourselves, by former and later denyall, seem to be devoted to be the Indian shambles and massacres.</P>
<P>The barbarians all the land over are filled with artillerie and ammunition from the Dutch, openly and horridly, and from all the English over the country (by stealth) I know they abound so wonderfully, that their activitie and insolencie is grown so high, that they dayly consult and
<PB N="278" REF="011300_0142_0F86A0720953E0E0"/>
hope and threaten to render us slaves, as they long since (and now most horribly) have made the Dutch.</P>
<P>For myselfe (as through Gods goodness) I have refused the gaine of thousands by such a murtherous trade, and think no law yet extant amongst yourselves or us secure enough against such a villainie; so am I loath to see so many hundreds (if not some thousands) in this colonie destroyed like fools and beasts without resistance: I grieve that so much bloud should cry against yourselves, yea and I grieve that (at this instant by these ships) this cry and the premisses should now trouble his highnes and his councell. For the seasonable preventing of which is this humble address presented to your wisdome, by him who desires to be</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Providence, <DATE>12.3.56. (so called)</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MAY it please this much honoured assembly to re∣member that, as an officer and in the name of Providence Colonie. I presented you with our humble re∣quests
<PB N="279" REF="011300_0142_0F86A0720953E0E0"/>
before winter, unto which not receaving answer I addressed myselfe this spring to your much honoured Go∣vernor, who was pleased to advise our sending of some of Providence to your assembly.</P>
<P>Honoured Sirs, our first request (in short) was and is, for your favourable consideration of the long and lamen∣table condition of the town of Warwick, which hath been thus. They are so dangerously and so vexatiously inter∣mingled with the Barbarians, that I have long admired the wonderfull power of God in restraining and preventing very great fires, of mutuall slaughters, breaking forth be∣tweene them.</P>
<P>Your wisedomes know the inhumane insultations of these wild creatures, and you may be pleased also to ima∣gine, that they have not bene sparing of your name as the patron of all their wickednes against our English men, women and children, and cattle to the yearely dammage of 60, 80 and 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>The remedie is (under God) only your pleasure that Pumham shall come to an agreement with the towne or colonie, and that some convenient way and time be set for their removall.</P>
<P>And that your wisdomes may see just grounds for such your willingness, be pleased to be informed of a realitie of a solemne covenant betweene this town of Warwick and Pumham, unto which, notwithstanding that he pleads his being drawne to it by the awe of his superiour Sachims, yet I humbly offer that what was done was according to the law and tenour of the natives (I take it) in all New England and America, viz. that the inferiour Sachims and subjects shall plant and remove at the pleasure of the highest and supreme Sachims, and I humbly conceave that it pleaseth the Most High and only Wise to make use of such a bond of authoritie over them, without which they could not long subsist in humane societies, in this wild condition wherein they are.</P>
<P N="2">2. Please you not to be insensible of the slipperie and dangerous condition of this their intermingled cohabita∣tion.
<PB N="280" REF="011300_0143_0F86A073348991D8"/>
I am humbly confident, that all the English towns and plantations in all New-England put together suffer not such molestation from the natives as this one towne and people. It is so great and so oppressive that I have dayly feared the tidings of some publicke fire and mischief.</P>
<P N="3">3. Be pleased to review this copie from the lord admi∣rall and that this English towne of Warwick should pro∣ceede, also that if any of yours were there planted they should by your authoritie be removed. And we humbly conceave that if the English (whose removes are difficult and chargeable) how much more these wild ones, who re∣move with little more trouble and dammage then the wild beasts of the wildernes.</P>
<P N="4">4. Please you to be informed that this small neck (wherein they keepe and mingle fields with the English) is a very den of wickednes, where they not only practice the horrid barbarisms of all kind of whoredoms, idolatries and conjurations but living without all exercise of actual authoritie, and getting store of liquors (to our griefe) there is a confidence and rendezvous of all the wildest and most licentious natives and practices of the whole country.</P>
<P N="5">5. Beside satisfaction to Pumham and the former inha∣bitants of this neck, there is a competitour who must allso be satisfied, another Sachim, one Nawwushawsuck, who (living with Ousamaquin) layes claime to this place, and are at dayly fewd with Pumham (to my knowledge) about the title and lordship of it. Hostilitie is daily threatned.</P>
<P>Our second request concerns 2 or 3 English families at Pawtuxet who, before our charter, subjected themselves unto your jurisdiction. It is true, there are many grie∣vances betweene many of the town of Providence and them, and these I humbly conceave may best he ordered to be composed by reference.</P>
<P>But (2) we have formerly made our addresses and now doe for your prudent removall of this great and long obstruction to all due order and regular proceedings among us, viz. the refusall of these families (pretending your name) to conforme with us unto his Highnes authoritie amongst us.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="281" REF="011300_0143_0F86A073348991D8"/>3. Your wisedomes experimentally know how apt men are to stumble at such an exemption from all duties and services from all rates and charges either with yourselves or us.</P>
<P N="4">4. This obstruction is so great and constant, that (with∣out your prudent removall of it) it is impossible that either his Highnes or yourselves can expect such satisfaction and observance from us as we desire to render.</P>
<P>Lastly, as before, we promised satisfaction to the natives at Warwick (and shall all possible ways endeavour their content) so we humbly offer as to these our countrymen, First, as to grievances depending, that references may settle them. 2dly, For the future, the way will be open for their enjoyment of votes and privileges, of choosing or being chosen to any office in towne or colonie.</P>
<P>Our third request is for your favourable leave to us to buy of your merchants fower or more barrells of powder yearely, with some convenient proportion of artillerie, con∣sidering our hazardous frontier situation to these Barbari∣ans, who from their abundant supply of armes from the Dutch (and persidious English all the land over) are full of our artillerie, which hath rendered them exceedingly insolent, provoking and threatning, especially the inlanders which have their supply from the fort of Aurania. We have bene esteemed by some of you as your thornie hedge on this side of you; If so, yet an hedge to be maintained: If as out sentinells, yet not to be discouraged. And if there be a jealousie of the ill use of such a favour, please you to be assured that a credible person in each towne shall have the dispose and managing of such supplies according to the true intent and purpose.</P>
<P>For the obtaining of these our just and necessary peti∣tions we have no inducement or hope from ourselves; only we pray you to remember that the matters prayed are no way dishonourable to yourselves and we humbly conceave doe greatly promote the honour and pleasure of his Highnes, yea of the Most High allso, and lastly, such

<P>THE remembrance of the solemne covenants and pro∣mises the united colonies (in the beginning of their combination) made one with another, not only to strengthen the hearts and hands each of other in appointing and maintaineing of religion in its purity, but also to be assist∣ing each to other where any deficiency in such respects may appear, hath putt us upon the pursuance of our en∣deavours to discharge our duties in desireing you to consi∣der of some such meete way and expedient, as where any defect appeares in any colony in the right improvement of such meanes and ordinances as the Lord hath appointed all his to use and improve for the edification of the body whereof Christ is the head, till his second coming.</P>
<P>Having heard some time since, that our neighbour colony of Plymouth, our beloved brethren, in a great part, seeme to be wanting to themselves in a due acknowledgment and incouragement to the ministry of the gospell, so as many pyous ministers of the gospell have (how justly we know not) deserted their stations, callings and relations: Our desire is that some such course may be taken, as that a

<P>Here hath arrived amongst us severall persons professing themselves Quakers, fitt instruments to propagate the kingdom of Satan; for the securing of ourselves and our neighbours from such pests wee have imprisoned them till they be dispatched away to the place from whence they came, one of which, Richard Smith, wee have lett out of prison to returne to his family at Southampton, whome wee hope and doubt not but our neigbours of Connecticut well be carefull so to order it as he may doe the least pre∣judice. As also that some generall rules may be com∣mended to the severall jurisdictions for the settling of go∣vernment amongst the Indians; that a generall law may also be commended to the generall court to prohibit the sale of horses to Indians, or to transport any mares beyond the seas to Barbadoes or otherwaise, on a severe penaltie, and that some generall rules may be also commended to each generall court to prevent the comeing in amongst us, from forraigne places such notorious heretickes as Qua∣kers, Ranters, &amp;c. and that strong waters to the Indians in all the jurisdictions may be forbidden, that the name of God be not dishonoured.

those professed ends of comeing into these parts, and of combination of the united colonies, which if not at∣tended in the particulars aforesaid will be rendered wholly frustrate, our profession miserably scandelised, ourselves become a reproach in the eyes of those that cannot with∣out admiration behold our suddaine defection from our first principles; wee cannot therefore but with all ear∣nestnes commend it to the wisedome and justice of the se∣verall jurisdictions to take effectuall care and make answer∣able provision, that religion and the ordinances of Christ professed may be upheld and maintained, which cannot be but by a due incouragement of an able orthodox ministry, a discountenanceing of that which is hetrodox and an effectuall course to keepe out heretickes, the great engines of Satan (in these times) to overthrow the trueth, and be∣cause this busines is of such high concernment to all, wee shall more particularly impart our thoughts to serious consideration.</P>
<P N="1">1.

<P N="4">4. The reference or relation of a minister being to the whole societie joyntly, whether in church order or not, his expectation of maintenance, and the debt of justice, is from the whole societie joyntly.</P>
<P N="5">5. Although the societie may according to their dis∣cretion use divers wayes to raise this maintainance, yet if the wayes be ineffectual (though the defect may be in some particular persons) the societie cannot be discharged, but is the debtor.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="286" REF="011300_0146_0F86A076951779A0"/>6. The ingagement being upon the societie, and that according to religion and right reason, it necessarily follows that the society be enabled with sufficient power to dis∣charge it selfe.</P>
<P N="7">7. Therefore the generall court should declare such a power to be in such societies, that there may be no pre∣tence in them for want thereof, and if any societie or township shall be wanting, either out of neglect or opinion, to procure and maintaine as abovesaid an orthodoxe mini∣stry according to the gospell, wee conceive (by the rules of scripture and the practise not only of all christian go∣vernments but even of heathen who not only held their sacra in veneration but tooke care of those that had the keeping of them and the charge of making knowne their misteries) the severall generall courts stand charged with the care that the people professing christianitie owne and live according to rules and ordinances of their profession, and that the dispensers of them be incouraged as aforesaid. The maintenance of the ministry being a debt of justice from the societie and the societie impowered to discharge it, if any particular person shall be defective to the societie they ought to be ordered by the ordinary course of justice.</P>
<P>These generalls wee thought meete to propose, from whence wee leave to the wisdome of the generall court to draw up such conclusions and orders as may attaine the end desired. And if any of the members of the said court should not concur (at present) with our apprehensions, wee doe earnestly desire that by all meanes they would labour to informe and satisfy themselves of the trueth of the particulars abovesaid, whereof wee (for our parts) have noe doubt. Wee doe further propose to the severall ge∣nerall courts that all Quakers, Ranters, and other notori∣ous heretickes be prohibited comeing into the united co∣lonies and if any shall hereafter come or arrise amongst us, that they be forthwith secured or removed out of all the jurisdictions. That some safe provision be made against selling or giving strong lyquors to the Indians without particular and expresse licence from some magi∣strate,
<PB N="287" REF="011300_0146_0F86A076951779A0"/>
or other officer thereunto deputed, and that upon some weighty cause or exigent. And that noe horse or mare, young or old, be sould to any Indian, under the penaltie of five for one.</P>
<P>And as to the restrainte of sending forth or transport∣ing, that each jurisdiction be left to theire libertie.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="sentence">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">See the Record of the judgm<SUP>t</SUP> in the case.</NOTE>WHEREAS when I gave my sentence in the case before me, betweene George Giddings plaintiff, and Edward Browne de∣fendant, in an action of trespas upon the case, &amp;c. I did
<PB N="290" REF="011300_0148_0F86A0781D26C4C0"/>
expresse some grounds of my judgment to be seen in the records. Now I shall add further what doth induce me to that apprehension in the case, viz.</P>
<P>First, This may be given as a reason, that it is against a fundamentall law in nature to be compelled to pay that which others doe give. For then no man hath any cer∣taynty or right to what he hath, if it be in the power of others (by pretence of authority or without) to give it away (when in their prudence they conceive it to be for the benefit of the owner) without his owne consent.</P>
<P>Secondly, This to me is some strengthning to induce my apprehension in this case, viz. That notwithstanding in England, it cannot be denied, but that mens estates were sometymes unduly taken from them: Some by force, some by fraud, some by sinister wresting of evidences, yea, and sometimes of lawe itselfe, as about knighthood-money, shipmoney, &amp;c. yet I dare say, if search be made into histories, lawyers bookes of reports, &amp;c. it cannot be made to appeare that in the most exorbitant times any man hath had his estate taken from him as by the guift of others, under colour of lawe, or countenance of authority. Noe, noe, lawyers would have blushed to have given such a con∣struction of lawes; and suddenly their faces would have waxed pale. For the Kinge would have beene too wise to have owned the plea. And what would all wise men have said for such taking away the greatest outward right or liberty from them? For it may be understood, that bene∣volencies, incouraging gratuities, leaves, or privy seales, were not required by lawe, or by pretence of lawe, but de∣sired as by favour. However they were obtained by ille∣gall and tyrannicall meanes, as was apprehended.</P>
<P>This I say further, and I doe argue it from the greater to the lesse. That if noe kinge or parliament can justly enact and cause that one mans estate, in whole or in part, may be taken from him and given to another without his owne consent, then surely the major part of a towne or other inferior powers cannot doe it. But shew us any man that can produce any footstep for such a way, either directly or indirectly.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="011300_0148_0F86A0781D26C4C0"/>But to the contrary it appeareth unto me. See Dalton page 401. where it is to this effect. That the kinge can∣not release a man out of prison (being in at a private mans suit) to his damage, without his owne consent. Also to the same purpose see Sir Henry Finch, recorder of London, in his first booke of lawe, page 74, having ended his rules about native or fundamentall lawes, he saith in the next page, Therefore lawes positive doe lose their force and are noe lawes at all, which are directly contrary to the former viz. native or fundamentall.</P>
<P>The parliament may tax (and that justly) the whole country to give a guift or reward to one man for some ser∣vice; for they are betrusted soe to doe. The reason is, it is levied upon the whole country, with their consent, and for the immediate benefitt of the whole.</P>
<P>But if they should doe it between persons (though they should soe doe by power, and the person wronged hath noe remedy in this world) yet it would be accounted ty∣ranny. Is it not to take from Peter and give it to Paul?</P>
<P>If one man, for such or such a turne or good end, may justly be deprived of a fundamentall right or liberty, then an other and an other, and so every man. In England there is but one sort of men that might be deprived of their goods; which sort are usually called slaves but there they are called villeynes to the lord of the mannor.</P>
<P>Thus much concerning fundamentall lawe, in reference to mine and thine, not to be given or taken away without his owne consent.</P>
<P>But now to answer some objections that may be made to the case in hande.</P>
<P>Objection. Suppose it be true what is expressed, and granted that he were a strange man that should deny the same in the generall: Yet, notwithstanding, it hindereth not but that a towne (when and as often as they thinke good, in their prudence) may doe it for good ends, and soe (in speciall cases) it may lawfully be done in the particular, upon the lawe made page the 9th, <HI>that every inhabitant
<PB N="292" REF="011300_0149_0F86A0794DCA22D8"/>
shall contribute to all charges in church and commonwealth (whereof he doth or may receive a benefitt) else he shall be strayned.</HI></P>
<P>Answer. I conceive that it is an extreame dishonour cast upon the generall court, to make such a construction of their positive laws as doth infringe the fundamentall law of mine and thine; for it must needs be voyd, if it should indeed be necessaryly construed against the right or liberty of the subject. But the law in its true sense is good.</P>
<P>Before this recited law was made, though some churches, or townes rather, did agree how much yearely maintenance the minister should have, yet it was not rated, at least in any compellable way by the towne, but men did pay their proportion in a way of voluntary contribution. But some (especially non members) some of them did grow slacke; and so the burthen grew too hevy upon church members, &amp;c. And upon consideration it was found lawfull to make a law to compell every one to beare his owne share; for∣asmuch as by hearing the word and publique prayer, &amp;c. he did or might receive a benefitt and (in a way of God) be received as a member with the rest. And yet the law was framed soe, as such churches as chose to goe in a volun∣tary way of weekly contribution or soe, might soe conti∣nue, notwithstanding this law, as some churches in this country doe to this day.</P>
<P>But for the right understanding of the word <HI>benefitt</HI> in the law, it is worthy the consideration or attendance, that benefit and necessary duty must goe together. The law both of God and the country doth require people to goe to the meeting for publique worship.</P>
<P>But it is not understood that any law doth provide that every towne shall buy or build a house for the minister as often as there is a removall by death or otherwise, I mean to be his in propriety.</P>
<P>Let us a little examine the poynt of <HI>benefitt</HI> that a man doth or may receive, as a motive to such a gift.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="011300_0149_0F86A0794DCA22D8"/>First, suppose or admitt the giver (compelled by the act of others against his will) should gaine twenty fold there∣by, viz. by the use of such a smith, or person obtained into towne, yet that doth nothing at all warrant the act.</P>
<P>And if you should onely consider matter of <HI>benefitt</HI> (not at all in this consideration minding the poynt of law∣fullnesse or unlawfullnesse in being compelled to pay) though it be not material to the case (as hath been sayd) whether it be <HI>benefitt</HI> or not in this respect, yet then the other way voted by the towne, viz. for the ministry, accor∣ding to the law provided, (by so generall if not universall consent) is to be compared with this way now strayned for, to understand which way turnes the scale for matter of <HI>benefitt.</HI></P>
<P>He that layeth downe a summ of money in hand for worke to be done, gives just occasion for others to take into the consideration whether a mans life be soe certayne or his continuance in the place and worke is made so sure as that it is a <HI>benefitt</HI> to goe in that way rather than in the other: For in any matter of this kind, rightly to understand whether soe or soe be a <HI>benefitt,</HI> yea or noe, both the present and future arguments must be weighed together.</P>
<P>Obj. But if any should object and say there is noe com∣parison betweene the <HI>benefitt</HI> that ariseth by the ministers function amongst people and externall temporall goods, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Ans. It is fully granted in one sense, but not in the sense of our enquiry. Here externall <HI>benefitt</HI> (in the comparison) is the thing considerable, as that the labourer is worthy of his hire.</P>
<P>For if the objecter should have men otherwise to under∣stand the matter of <HI>benefitt,</HI> he must alter his mind upon this consideration: Whoever doth but ride through the towne, and the people being met at that tyme, the stranger comes in and speaks some heavenly truths amongst them: Is not this of greater value than all the lands, houses and cattle in the towne? And is it therefore legall and bind∣ing, if the major part present doe give him 100 <ABBR><HI>l</HI></ABBR>?</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="011300_0150_0F86A079DD53F328"/>Obj. But the law urged fol. 9. expresseth civill charges as well as ecclesiasticall; therefore, though it were a mis∣chief to the commonwealth so to interpret generall sentences in positive or court lawes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is quite contrary to the rules following for interpreta∣tation of laws.</NOTE> this law (so interpreted) will leave them out, if a towne or select men shall thereupon give, and accordingly rate and distrayne such as never consented to their acting, to one good ditcher soe much over and above his allowance for his worke by the rodd, &amp;c. Such a smith soe much, &amp;c. For it is to the <HI>benefitt</HI> of the towne to incourage them to stay, and so be content to take the lesse wages.</P>
<P>Answ. Amongst 200 inhabitants in a towne, whereof a matter of six, or soe, be worth 2000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a piece, the rest doe perceive that the six rich men within a yeare will remove their estates out of towne. The towne having a generall meeting doe give 300<ABBR>l.</ABBR> to the present minister, that the proportion of the estates of such rich men may ease them∣selves for the future: It is in consideration of his staying amongst us and as part of his yearly maintenance and for advancing the lands of the towne in general, either to lett out or sell for such as come into towne after such a summ layd down in hand before the worke be done. And who can deny but the rich men doe or may receive a <HI>benefitt,</HI> or some <HI>benefitt</HI> (at the least) thereby, namely, by the word of God preached, before they doe remove theire estates out of towne.</P>
<P>After this there is another tax raised by the towne (there being 20 of good estate though not neare the first) for some good end, &amp;c. and there are divers valuable con∣siderations held forth, them thereunto moving, at last the few riche men begin to perceive that they being few in number shall be levelled, and yet comfort themselves that they cannot be made slaves in this countrey: For though they be thus deprived of their estates, yet they have the words of a law for them; and if all, in a manner, should be thus wasted, yet there is such a way to ease them again.</P>
<P>Thus much touching the matter of <HI>benefitt</HI> construed and urged by the law, fol. 9,</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="part">
<PB N="295" REF="011300_0150_0F86A079DD53F328"/>
<HEAD>About a bargain or contract.</HEAD>
<P>Obj. Suppose it should be endeavoured to be made a bargain, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Ans. It is no matter to the case in question: For though it be in the power of a person or of many (each person con∣senting) to make a bargain never so much to his owne losse, yet he or they must be holden to it: But otherwise it is with a derived power or trust, being a society; for they have not such an unlimited domination over other mens estates or persons; For, setting aside the consideration of the fundamentall law (before sufficiently spoken unto) they are limited by statute law. And such bargains as bind the non consenters must be just, rationall, and the termes or conditions also expressed and certayne: If any of these fayle noe law will bind them.</P>
<P>This is knowne, that upon motions in towne meetings and other companies, some use one argument or motive, some another. Some are moved with one argument or consideration in his mind, some with another. And is the rule to seeke then (or onely soe in this case) what is the way of nations to understand the mind of the company? Must not recourse be had to the record?</P>
<P>In the case in question, doe the agitations end in a bar∣gain, or in a gift? Whatever the motives were that did incline, &amp;c. if so expressed in termes, it is hard worke to add thereunto or to alter therefrom.</P>
<P>If it were so, that any man were not capable to receive a gift, it might have some colour to be interpreted to be a bargain, or contract.</P>
<P>But if it be an equall or rationall thing to have pay laid downe, or urged to be laid downe afore-hand, where a call of God is acknowledged by accepting and taking office before. And besides the knowledge of the yearely salary. knowing also that the place was willing to expend 150 <HI>l.</HI> to buy or build a house for the use of the ministry, which during his abode there he was to dwell in.</P>
<P>And when there are noe certayne conditions that doe provide, in case he die or remoove within one yeare, or
<PB N="296" REF="011300_0151_0F86CB2DD907BED0"/>
one month, his executor to returne part of it to the towne, or when there is no such conditions, nor any at all express∣ed, and onely one party knowne to consent, and that as they have done, whether this can be called a just and binding contract or bargain, yea or noe, or any at all, let the world judge.</P>
<P>And certayne such as plead on the now defendants party must say it is either a gift or a bargain. If this be endea∣voured to be a bargain or contract, it is a very blind bar∣gain, as they say, which (acting upon oath) I could not allow. If a gift (for there may be motives and high con∣siderations in the minds of the granters to give as well as to conclude a bargain) then it doth not bind such as doe not consent to be forced to pay what doe move other men to give away out of their estates.</P>
<P>So much about the matter of contract or consideration.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Now a little about interpretation of lawes and of rules to be attended therein.</HEAD>
<P>Let us not (here in New-England) despise the rules of the learned in the lawes of England, who have both great helps and long experience.</P>
<P N="1">1. First rule is, that where a law is such as that, by wresting, a man may give such an interpretation as will overthrow it, when it might be construed to be good; this is a corrupt interpretation. So holy scripture may be wrested.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Finch p. 33. in his booke of law.</NOTE>If repugnant to fundamentall law, its voyd; as if it gives power to take away an estate from one man and give it to another.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 75.</NOTE>It is then consonant, if it be to compell men to pay necessary duties in church and common wealthe, as yearely maintenance.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another rule is about equality. Hence where a com∣pany in trust doth act, if any will imply conditions (noe way exprest) yet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">F. p. 20.</NOTE> to hold forth any color of binding, they must be knowne to be equall and certaine: though a statute law should provide or expresse mischief∣ously. See his words at large, justly applyable as is expressed.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="297" REF="011300_0151_0F86CB2DD907BED0"/>3. Another rule appeareth to this effect. That where a person is sued at a private mans suit, and put in prison upon execution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dalton p. 401.</NOTE> the king cannot pardon that imprisonment without the consent of the party plt. and the reason is there given; for it is in lieu of damage to the party, as hath been touched before.</P>
<P N="4">4. The law construeth things with equity and modera∣tion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Finch page 55.</NOTE> and therefore restrayneth a generall act, if there be any mischief or inconveniency in it.</P>
<P>So far touching rules for interpretation of laws.</P>
<P>Quest. By the way: Seeing there is so much spoken about fundamentall lawes and interpretations, what may be the difference betweene the late Earle of Straffords inter∣pretations and actings against fundamentall lawes, and some∣times those of other men?</P>
<P>Answ. Although in some things materially they should be the same, yet formally they are not, or may not be so.</P>
<P>The Earle of Straffords acting was found to be a trea∣cherous and perfidious attempt to alter and subvert the frame of polity.</P>
<P>So there were these particulars in it, viz. First, his end was naughr. 2dly, He acted arbitrarily against such lawes. 3dly, It was done perfidiously, it being done willingly.</P>
<P>But others acting against fundamentall law, charity con∣strueth that their end they ayme at is good. Secondly, their arbitrary construction (where it is so) may be through ignorance, or through want of notice taking of such rules for interpretation of laws as are expressed in the lawyers bookes.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Precedents and judgments in courts.</HEAD>
<P>Although there had been noe precedent in the like case, yet I ought (I conceive) to have judged, in the case in question, according to the rules aforegoing: Notwithstand∣ing, I grant that what I find to have beene judged already and acted, both justly and honourably, I ought to be the more confirmed thereby.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="298" REF="011300_0152_0F86CB2EADDF7820"/>1. In Ipswich, some years since, the town greatly wanted a good chirurgeon, &amp;c. and the inhabitants then generally being desirous of such a person to inhabite amongst us; the chiefe sort consulted how to effect it. It must cost above 50 <HI>l</HI> to bring it about.</P>
<P>It was concluded that it could not be justly done by way of rate, but each mans name being drawne out (according to a rate) such as were willing did signify the same, and the rest were left to use their liberty.</P>
<P N="2">2. I am informed and doe partly remember it, that some yeares since there was a six acre lott in Ipswich purchased for Jeffery Snelling; but some of the inhabitants consented not: It came it last to a suite in Ipswich court, and it was found against the towne, because by law they could not give away any mans estate against his owne consent, not∣withstanding the considerations and motions inducing.</P>
<P>And admitt there were not such weighty considerations or benefitt as in some other case there may be, the degree is not the poynt; for <HI>majus et minus non variant speciem.</HI> Ambrose Leach the seller of the land. Daniell Clarke was sued.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is yet, I conceave, a concluding argument (in the like case) in the generall court, I referr to the re∣cord itselfe (but till an understanding man, then an inhabi∣tant of Weymouth, (as I am informed) mentioned it since the passing of my sentence in the case in question) it was out of my mind.</P>
<P>I remember the substance of it, and I suppose so doe many more. That towne of Weymouth did generally agree to provide an house and meet accommodations for the use of the ministry, to remaine for posterity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">This case was tried at a county court at Boston, and found a∣gainst the town.</NOTE> The matter came into the ge∣nerall court. Mrs. Richards stood out, and not many (if any more besides) and although the court did soe well like their ayme, or the thing (in itselfe considered) as may by and by appeare, yet it was judged in court that they could not justly im∣pose payment upone one, or more persons, not consenting.
<PB N="299" REF="011300_0152_0F86CB2EADDF7820"/>
One Dyer was then deputy of that towne, and did prose∣cute in behalfe of the towne: Yet herein the court gave a testimony of their good liking in respect of the townes intent, viz. in that way to provide for the ministry. And accordingly the law was framed, and enacted for the future,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 20.</NOTE> that very court.</P>
<P>This provision was not to give away, but to remaine to posterity, and the like provision was for every towne in the country; and that which a great part, if not the greater part, of Ipswich have desired and do still stand for.</P>
<P>Obj. But it may yet further be objected. That the two wayes, viz. of giving a sume, 100 <HI>l.</HI> more or lesse, and that of laying out 150<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> for the ministry, whereby the present minister should have the benefitt and use during his life (if he stayed in the place which he had formerly accepted) and after him the same to remaine to posterity for the use of the ministry, which were best is considera∣ble, &amp;c. Now seeing the greater part doth choose rather the latter way, by a major vote, what great matter if the other part doth not yield to it? or why should they not yet yield to it, for the first way seems to tende most to peace, and there is lesse present expence about it, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Answ. The answer to this is, we are not now upon per∣swasive arguments, what is least expence. &amp;c. or what may be supposed to tend most to peace, or upon a thing to be done: But I am to judge the case according to justice and right, upon what is already done; wherein, according to my oath and trust, I am not to respect persons in judgment.</P>
<P>Obj. But possibly some will yet further object that it was done in part of his maintenance.</P>
<P>Ans. This is spoken unto already. How can this be part of that contract which was some six weeks before, viz. that he should have 80<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> per ann. for his maintenance, and a house was procured for him for the present, and a vote passed to pay 150<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> to provide for him during his being in the place, and then to leave it for such an end, &amp;c. especially the matter being soe variously propounded and agreed as each man thought good in the meeting house.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="011300_0153_0F86CB2ED5383C58"/>Some saying to this effect (to promote a guift) that the minister would not stay unless he had soe much to buy or build a house for himselfe in propriety. Others did ad∣here to the former way agreed upon. Againe, some say∣ing it were best to procure a sum by way of subscription, viz. to put it to men to give as the arguments did move them, in a voluntary way. Others that it might be voted, &amp;c.</P>
<P>All this while noe demandant present nor noe authority to this day appearing to mention much lesse to conclude a bargain or contract.</P>
<P>But the result of all motions and arguments was to give 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> as it is expressed in the record. From which I dare not in any wise in point of justice receed.</P>
<P>Obj. Lastly, if it be objected that in that there was soe great a sume given or granted it may stumble the busines, but had there beene a matter of half of it or lesse it would have been held good.</P>
<P>Ans. However too often it falls out in the world that smaller injuries or errors are passed by, being done by the hands of such as have power in their hands and specially if acted by such as are in supreme authority, yet such act∣ings were but a crooked or lesbian rule to justify an act thereby. Will it not be yeelded that <HI>majus &amp; minus non variant speciem?</HI> If the major part can justly give away one pound, by the same reason 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> yea 1000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> If one acre of another mans ground, his orchard also, yea his farme as well. And that although a parliament or generall court cannot doe it.</P>
<P>Such as promisse a guift it behoves them in poynt of conscience to make payment (and they only it is conceived) though not as vote of the towne, but as each particular mans promisse doth binde himself.</P>
<P>Quest. If it be demanded whether there be any diffe∣rence detweene disposing mens estates by way of guift (under colour of law and countenance of authority) unto other men against or without the consent of the owners and the doctrine of levellisme.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="011300_0153_0F86CB2ED5383C58"/>Ans. It may be answered (I conceive) to this effect, viz. That of the levellers, though wicked and absurd, yet it is as yet but doctrinall (I thinke) but this kinde of transpose∣ing mens estates is both doctrinall and practicall alsoe, and soe leadeth more directly to tiranny as it seemeth.</P>
<P>Secondly, Levellisme (I take it) reacheth but to the estate, &amp;c. But this (if accounted legall) men may for a debt soe obtained (as in other cases) upon execution for a debt inforce the person to prison, or expose him to be sould to make payment.</P>
<P>Quest. But what if there be an interpretation put upon the words of the records, and call it a contract, will not this help the matter.</P>
<P>Ans. This liberty to interprett acts or records against the playne words thereof (if it be a help) I suppose it is to make the matter worse in this respect (if worse can be) then the doctrine of levellisme, for by their doctrine (I thinke) a man may understand what they meane by their words, and their words are used (its likely) in one fence.</P>
<P>But this kinde of liberty of interpreting seems to coun∣tenance and strengthen the opinion of the scepticks, which makes all things true, and soe indeed nothing true or cer∣tayne. Hence when an act will serve the turne let the words stand, else take liberty to interpret them for their purposes.</P>
<P>If this kind of liberty be good, either to construe laws (provided for necessary payments) or turning guifts into contracts (as men please) then indeed it is all one whether both parties be present when the busines is in hand or not. And though it was wont to be lawe that a bargain, whether it proveth gaynfull or loosing, yet being made bindeth both parties. But had this vote beene for 20<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> M (or soe) instead of 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> would it be interpreted good, binding and disanulling of the vote for the 150<ABBR><HI>l</HI></ABBR>? But this was intended doubtless by some, namely by granting a new sume to change or repeale the act for the former way agreed on, according to the lawe and the townes con∣tentment, though herein alsoe they did mistake, for there
<PB N="302" REF="011300_0154_0F86CB2FD76526A8"/>
appeareth to be noe vote to disanull the former. Soe that if there were divers more graunts or gifts in this kind, they were all additionall, and would all be gotten by suit and distresse, and if this may, justly be obtained by lawe.</P>
<P>The question unto this court is annexed under the hand of the clerk of Salem court.</P>
<P>It being framed in one question by Salem court, it doth consist of a compound axiome.</P>
<P>Upon viewing whereof I finde the paper to contayne two questions distinctly taken.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. First, Whether the vote doth binde all or any of the inhabitants of the said towne to pay any thinge towards the said 100 <HI>l.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Secondly, Whether such as voted not but are and were unwilling may be compelled thereunto, yea or noe?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The first of these doth not concerne such as refuse to pay or are defendants in the case originally: Save that they are bound to desire that matters may be rightly understood and judged. Not doubting but the court seeth a manifest difference betweene a mans being bound in private con∣science to performe his owne promisse, and being legally bound by a vote of a towne. For a towne or court cannot or need not distinguish of particular persons who is for the affirmative, who not. But how many, &amp;c. Its the vali∣dity of a major part's vote is in question; not the personall vote of this man or of that.</P>
<P>The latter doth properly concerne the said defendants. For payment whereunto, or accordingly, they are sued and their goods distreyned. And the case is now come to this court for resolution.</P>
<P>The order of the towne of Ipswich, its proceeding in re∣ference to the answers in question was to this effect, viz.</P>
<P>At a meeting in Ipswich October 55, about the tyme of Mr. Cobbetts coming to towne, there was a vote past to pay 80<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> per ann. for his maintenance.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="011300_0154_0F86CB2FD76526A8"/>Alsoe there was another vote of the towne expressing their willingnes to disburse a sume not exceeding 150<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> to provide for the ministry.</P>
<P>And there was a meeting of the towne in February following (being about six weekes after Mr. Cobbett was ordayned) upon much agitation to and fro there was a vote past in these words, viz. Voted by the towne to give 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> to buy or build a house for Mr. Cobbett.</P>
<P>It is conceived that the view hereof doth afford argu∣ment for further clearing and confirming (if need were) of what is argued for in this paper.</P>
<P>To conclude this matter, I thank God, I am for ordi∣nances both in church and common wealth; and conse∣quently for due meanes for the upholding of them (and doe account it not onely a great wickednes to be contrary-minded, but extreme folly and madnes) and I thinke it tends to the honour of them, when, in reference there∣unto, provision is made either in a voluntary or else in a way of compulsion, grounded upon such principles as both here and in other nations will be owned as just and equall.</P>
<P>I doe sometymes remember what is said of Levy. In poynt of right and truth, he tooke noe notice of father or mother. And that is the way to establish love and peace in this our Israel. And the holy scripture doth oblige the doctrine and practice of piety according to the first table, and of distributive justice in the second, both expressly, or by necessary consequence, at the hands of such as are called to dispence the same, though they take not oath soe to doe.</P>
<P>It is supposed that noe man is come to New England to have his goods given and taken from him, unto, or for what good end, or under what pretence soever.</P>
<P>If this should be confirmed for good law; henceforth then (I conceive) there will be noe more need, or little, to make any more propositions for voluntary contri∣butions.</P>

<HEAD>To the honoured Generall Court now assembled.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS it hath pleased God in the way of his providence to exercise the towne of Ipswich with great troubles, by removing those reverend elders which they formerly enjoyed, it pleased God in our straits by the help of our honoured Governor, Deputy Governor and severall of the reverend Elders, to provide for us an able helpe in the worke of the Lord among us, our rev. pastour Mr. Th. Cobbet, whom now at present we enjoy. After he was come amongst us, we came in a church-meeting to consider how to provide for his maintenance, in which we conceive a house must be provided for him. Then the case came to be propounded to the towne in a generall towne-meeting, where being some agitations about it, there passed a vote, which is here expressed.</P>
<Q>Voted to give 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> towards the building or buying a house for Mr. Cobbet.</Q>
<P>Which vote was full and cleare; and afterwards there was a proportion made by the selectmen of the towne upon the severall inhabitants. But there being diverse of them that refused to pay their proportion, the deacons
<PB N="305" REF="011300_0155_0F86CB30479F4B40"/>
came to consider with the selectmen what to do about it, and they ordered the marshall to distreine one, or two. He was sued in an action of trespasse before our honoured magistrate Mr. Samuel Symonds, from whose judgment he appealed to Salem court; where the partyes appearing, were desired by the court to cease prosecution and to let the question be stated by the court and presented to the generall court. Which was accordingly consented unto. Which we humbly intreat this honoured court to take into their consideration.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="order">
<HEAD>A copy of the order of Salem court.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS there were severall actions commenced at this court by some of the inhabitants of Ipswich, which were of great and generall concernment. And the court fearing the usuall manner of proceedings would not put a comfortable issue to the said cases, propounded to the partyes that the question in controversy might be stated and presented to the generall court for resolution, which should determine the particular actions and all others that might arise upon the said question, which question was by the court stated with the consent of partyes, and is as followeth.</P>
<Q>At a generall yearely meeting of the inhabitants of the towne of Ipswich Feb. 25. 55. voted to give 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> toward building or buying a house for Mr. Cobbet.</Q>
<P>The question is, Whether this vote doth bind all or any of the inhabitants of the said towne to pay any thing to∣ward the said 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> and that such as are or were unwilling may be compelled thereunto, yea or no? And it is agreed that either party shall have liberty to present their reasons, in writing, to the generall court, pro and con. But no other pleadings by either party to be allowed.</P>
<P>According to which liberty we present as followeth.</P>
<P>The question hath two parts, 1. Whether the vote be binding. 2. Whether such as refuse may be compelled.</P>
<P>The first being proved, the other will easily follow.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="reasons">
<PB N="306" REF="011300_0156_0F86CB3102A7DEE0"/>
<HEAD>Reasons tending to prove the affirmative.</HEAD>
<P>The vote is legall, therefore binding. It is legall in respect of the matter and manner. For the matter, it is necessary, publicke towne charges, viz. honourable main∣tenance of the ministry, which the law requires in generall, but leaves to each towne to determine and apply in parti∣cular, suitable to their owne condition; provided they are subject to be regulated by higher authority, where need shall require. This honourable maintenance, we conceive, cannot be lesse than that a minister, for his labour in preach∣ing the gospell, (whatever estate he hath of his owne) should have such a recompence whereby he may be enabled comfortably to provide for the present necessity of his family, to be given to hospitality, and to leave some com∣fortable provision for his family after his decease, as other men by Gods blessing upon their ordinary labours are generally enabled to doe. This being granted which (we hope) seems but just and reasonable, that ministers families may not be left in a worse condition than most other mens, the particular way and manner of affording this maintenance (where there are variety of apprehensions) must necessarily be determined by the major part. So it was in our case, and the towne pitched upon what is ex∣pressed in the vote, the due fullfilling of which is necessary and justifiable upon these grounds.</P>
<P N="1">1. The usuall yearly allowance will not reach the for∣mer end, viz. to afford any provision for a ministers family after his death.</P>
<P N="2">2. This hath been a common practise among ourselves formerly, and in other places in the country lesse able, not only to give their first but succeeding ministers a dwelling house, or somewhat proportionable that way.</P>
<P N="3">3. This we perceived would be most acceptable, and might rationally be expected, and the other way pro∣pounded, of providing a house meerely for use, would not be acceptable, as not being usuall in the country, and apprehended prejudiciall to the familyes of ministers after their decease.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="307" REF="011300_0156_0F86CB3102A7DEE0"/>4. The sume given is not so great as to exceed the end for which it is granted, or to burden the towne in payment of it, and other lesse sumes being propounded, this was freely chosen and resolved on.</P>
<P>This for the legality of the vote in respect of the mat∣ter and substance of it.</P>
<P>For the manner. It was a lawful meeting, free liberty of debate being given, and at last concluded by the farre major part, very few opposing it either in debate or voting.</P>
<P>Thus the vote appearing legall, we conceive it binding, and being so, we conceive the towne hath power to com∣pell such as refuse to yield to it, by virtue of a law enact∣ed and established by the generall court, p. 9. providing that all common charges to church and commonwealth may be compelled by assessment and distresse.</P>
<P>To conclude, we hope and persuade ourselves that our brethren are one with us in their love and desire to en∣courage an able godly ministry among us, and will judge it safest and suitablest both to the mind of God and the godly zeale and religious care of our honoured generall court, to be open, rather then strait-handed that way: And that we would not be justly taxed for, nor exemplary in, the least discouragement of that nature, and that we agree in the end, only differ about the meanes of attain∣ing it.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="judgment">
<HEAD>This 22 of the 4th mo. 1657.</HEAD>
<P>FOrasmuch as there is a case in controversy concerning a sum of money, containing one hundred pounds, voted by some in a towne meeting to be given to Mr. Cobbet for his particular use to buy or build him a house, we whose names are underwritten (promising due reve∣rence to the person fore mentioned) conceiving ourselves not to be obliged by a major vote in an act of that nature, not being involved in that act; we here crave leave, as without offence unto any, to declare our dislike of it, we never acting in it nor gave any incouragement thereunto, seeing noe reason soe to doe; yet doe we declare our∣selves

<HEAD>At the Court held at Salem 1.5. 1657.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas there were several actions commenced against several of the inhabitants of Ipswich which were of greate concernment and the court fearing the usuall man∣ner of proceeding would impede a comfortable issue to the said cases, propounded to the parties that the question in controversie might be stated and presented to the generall court for resolution, which determine the particular actions and all others that arise upon the said question, which question was by the court stated with the consent of par∣ties and is also as followeth,

<P>This is a true coppie.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The great doubt in this long case seems to have been whether an act of the supreme authority, impowering the major part of the inhabitants of a town to tax the minor part which did not consent to the tax, was not contrary to the fundamental laws in government. It must be remembered that many of this minor part were not voters in town affairs, neither in person nor by any representative of their own constituting. The arguments are as strong against taxes by the General Court as by a Town, and yet the House of Representatives (p. 304) voted that the tax made by the Town was not binding. In a day or two after they altered their mind. There was a division in the colony at this time upon the mode of maintenance of ministers, any other way except by voluntary contribution being opposed by many, of whom Mr. Justice Symonds seems to have been one.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>Copy of a petition of the inhabitants of Yorke, Kittery, Wells, &amp;c. presented 27th of October 1658, to his Highness the Lord Protector.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>To his Highnes the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, and dominions there∣unto belonging.</P>
<P>The humble petition of severall the inhabitants of the townes of Yorke, Kittery, Wells, Saco and Cape Porpus, sometymes under the provinciall government of Mayne and Lygonia, now under the jurisdiction of the Massa∣chusets in New England,</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER>Humbly sheweth,</OPENER>
<P>WHEREAS as information doth report unto us of several addresses lately made unto your Highnes, by some gentlemen of worth, for restitution of their right of jurisdiction over us, claimed by theyr patents, the de∣termination whereof (we humbly conceive) after a legall hearing, rests upon your pleasure, wherein ourselves not being so properly concerned as others, at present, doe pur∣posely wave, craving onely to present your Highnes with a true narrative, though implicite, of our first and last estate, before and since we had this government which through Gods mercy we now enjoy to our good satisfaction, and for our continued setlednes under it we dayly pray, for these reasons.</P>
<P>First, Because of ourselves we have small power to carry on government, being a people but few in number, and those not competent persons to manage such weighty affayres, our weakenes occasioning distraction, our paucity division, our meanes contempt, as our owne former experi∣ence hath fully evinced to the totall subverting all civill order amongst us.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, Because chainges cannot reduce things from im∣possibilityes to make things, of such as are not, to be, the case is ours, the places of our residence admit but of small
<PB N="315" REF="011300_0160_0F86CB34EBED21E8"/>
inlargement, the generality of the country from us east∣ward is so confusedly taken up with uninhabitable beings of sterile lands, swamps, and rockey mountaynes, as not more than a few shreds are left by the sea shore fitt for co∣habitation, and those already populated by an inconsiderate number of people. How the wisest of such who desyer superintendency over us can settle a well governed com∣monwealth upon such basis we leave to your wisdome to judge.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, Because changes in these tymes may prove dan∣gerous, where discontented spirits wayte for such oppor∣tunityes, which have not beene the least part of that small number amongst us who were professed royalists, whose breathings that way, since our subjecting to this authority, have beene so far stifled, as that the activity of such spirits cannot fynde any, or the least opportunity of motion.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, Because we feare the hurtfulnes of our change. As our government now is, our persons and estates stand under the security of wholesome lawes, watchfull gover∣nors, the fathers of our nourishment and peace, whose pyous care not onely tollerates but maynetaynes us the purest institutions for the encouragement of godly persons, both ministers and others, to reside amongst us, but changing it may throw us backe into our former estate, to live under negligent masters, the dainger of a confused anarchy, and such other inconveniencyes as may make us a fitt shelter for the worst of men, delinquents and ill affected persons to make their recourse unto, thereby to exempt themselves from their just deserved punishments.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, Changes are apt to inihilate, unless they prove much for the better, especially in weake boddyes, where heades are far remote; touching such events our former experience hath taught us something, else we crave of those gentlemen who are now so solicitous for government over us, what ment the deepness of theyr sylence severall yeares, both in theyr tongues and penns, as not after our frequen∣cy of writing to them they not so much as returne us one sylable of answer, or afford us the least assistance in go∣vernment;
<PB N="316" REF="011300_0161_0F86CB3582567708"/>
the want whereof let us sincke into great di∣stractions, for our recovery thence severall amongst us petitioned for government to the collony of the Massachu∣setts, who after some debate with us and confirmation of some articles of agreement to us, tooke us under theyre authority, unto which we subscribed and subjected our∣selves, and under whose protection to continue we account it not the least part of our security and happinesse.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. Because we conceave the confyrming the Massa∣chusets pattent in its due extent, in respect of its antiquity, nuls all after pattents whatsoever, as fully in titles of lands as of government, from both which we expect aequal free∣dome by theyr just interests and our owne subjection.</P>
<P>Our humble request therefore is, that your Goodness would favour our reasonable entreatyes, whose weakenes calls for support, our manners for some strictness of rule, whose distractions for some present settlement wherein our voate is that it may be as it is under the government of the Massachusets, against which if changes should inter∣pose our inevitable troubles would follow. Our condition as it was in part, and as it now stands, lyes really before your gracious eye, although not so methodically presented, for which we hope our ignorance will excuse us. Touch∣ing which if your Highnes expect any further information we beseech your commands herein for a pyous and reve∣rend friend of ours, Mr. John Wheelwright, sometymes of us, now in England, unto whome our estate is well knowne and is able fully to sattisfy any enquiries therein.</P>
<P>Craving pardon for our overmuch boldnes and prolixity, as our dutyes are, so pray we for the Almightys protection to secure your person, his spiritt to guide, his gracious blessing to crowne your high and memorable endeavours with continued succes for the advancement of his owne glory and kingdom, and your happiness here and eternally.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOURS of 13 September received with the enclosed to his Highnes the Lord Potector, dated 10th June 58. Now such was the good pleasure of the Most High, that the Protector, whose commands occasioned that letter in returne, was gathered to his fathers before that came from you, he dyed the 3d September. Upon the 4th his eldest son the Lord Richard was proclaimed Protector, to whome I made my application on the behalfe of the coun∣try that day fortnight after; agayne, upon receipt of the generall courts letter, I applyed myselfe to his Highnes and presented the said letter the 27th day of October, he was pleesed to open and read the letter in my hearing, and then gave me assurance as formerly that he had a deep sense how deare the people of N. E. were to his deare father, and that he should be ready in all things to lay forth himself for the good of that people. After my humble thankes returned on the countrys behalfe, I pre∣sented a copy of the petition from Pascataqua and Yorke inhabitants (Mr. Godfrey being active about his complaints, the which he still prosecutes and hath procured a refe∣rence) his Highnes said he would read the same and con∣sider thereof at more leisurable tyme than he had at that present; so that I doubt not but whatever Mr. Godfrey may doe we shall be able to give such answer as to pre∣vent prejudice to the courts actings as to those parts. For the letter his late Highnes sent, it was procured by a gen∣tleman attends his Highnes; it being drawne up and made ready for signing, and so tooke his opportunity; the se∣cretary hath promised if any thing in future be upon mo∣tion refering to the country I shall have notice thereof while I abide here: For state of affaires at present, we are at peace and the great chaynge hath as yett little of the face of chaynge in it; his present Highnes gayneing upon

The English agent, Mr. Dow∣ning,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir George Downing, who a few years before went from New-England.</NOTE> and French hath put in their memorandums at the Hague, in name of their masters, that the Dutch desist assistance to continue hostilities betweene the notherne kings, and to provoke them to endeavour a mediation.

<P>WEE presume you have heard from the people of the fort of Aurania, that some of the English have beene lately in those parts upon discovery of some meete places for plantations within the bounds of the pattent of the Massachusetts colonie. which from the latitude of 42 or 42 and 30 minutes, and so northerly, extends itselfe from
<PB N="319" REF="011300_0162_0F86CB3C2AAC3990"/>
east to west in longitude through the maine land of Ame∣rica from the Atlanticke ocean to the south or west sea. And we understand that the government of the Massachu∣setts have graunted libertie to some of theire people to erect a plantation in these parts and intend to effect the same, yet without intrenchment upon the Dutch rights, and foreseeing some difficulties to beginne a plantation such a distance by land and that the passage up Hudsons river would very much accommodate them in theire de∣signe, wee have thought good on theire behalfe to desire libertie of free passage for theire said planters by your townes and forts upon the said river to the said land, they demeaning themselves peaceably and paying such moderate duties as may be expected in such cases, which being so concordant to reason and the custom of civill nations living in amitie, doth beget in us a confidence that you will be very slow (by an unreasonable denyall) to interrupt the neighbourly correspondency that hath beene betwixt the English and Dutch colonies: For the exact bounds of the Massachusetts pattent wee leave to that government to cleare, onely wee conceive the agreement at Hartford, that the English should not come within ten miles of Hudsons river doth not prejudice the right of the Massachusetts in the upland country, nor give any right to the Dutch there, that agreement intending onely the differences betwixt Conecticott and Newhaven and yourselves on the sea coast, there being at that time no difference betweene you and the Massachusetts, and neither Conecticott or Newhaven pretending any right to the lands up the country within the line aforesaid.</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from the General Court to Mr. John Leverett in London.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have received your letter of October 58, with the petition of Mr. George Rigby, &amp;c. have considered the contents of both, and have herewith sent you a copie of our patent, and of the extent of our lyne taken by ar∣tests, with severall other writings and letters to friends in reference thereunto, which we desire and hope may be improved to our advantage, and judge it convenient, if there be a fitt opportunitie and friends propitious for us, that it may be a speedy issue. Some considerations we thought good to suggest, which you may make use of as there shall be occasion; as first, from the expresse words of the pattent that determines our northerly bounds, which our generall court hath always understood to meane as you know, as also one other passage in the pattent where it is said that any thing of doubtfull interpretation shall be understood in favour of the patentees. 2dly, At our first coming hither into this wilderness, and for some yeares after, multitude of occasions in the beginning of so great an undertaking did hinder our exact taking notice of our laying claim to the utmost extents of our limits, especially to the norward, nor had we for some time after our com∣ing hither occasion to make use thereof, yet did we never sett up our bounds 3 myles east of Merimack, as the peti∣tion mentions, but as occasion was given have always as∣serted the same limits that now we claim, though we knew not certainly (till tryall made) where it would fall. In the meane time, severall persons procured pattents of certaine tracts of land within the limits formerly graunted us, all or most whereof were obtained surreptitiously and illegally, and afterwards ordered and governed as unduely, the pattentees chiefly ayming at trade or private profitt, neglecting the chiefe end intended, and declared in his
<PB N="321" REF="011300_0163_0F86CB3E51561470"/>
Majesty's original graunt, whence it came to passe that there were severall pettie governments, sometimes by pat∣tent, sometimes by combination, and sometimes the people left in distraction and confusion without any, and in great danger and hazard of shedding one anothers blood, where∣upon first divers of the inhabitants of Paskataqua, about the year <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> petitioned this court that as they were conceived to be within our lyne, so they might be actually taken in and governed by us, which accordingly was done by com∣missions sent from this court, with the consent and good liking of all the inhabitants and persons interested therein, and so have continued with much satisfaction, living in peace and enjoying the fruit and benefitt of good government to this day. In the yeare <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> we took a more exact survey of our limits, and finding these easterly parts men∣tioned in the petition to fall within our pattent (which is more ancient and more authenticke than any other pre∣tended to by the petitioners) we made declaration thereof to the inhabitants residing within the aforesaid precincts, being likewise petitioned so to doe by divers of the inha∣bitants beyond Paskataqua river, now called Yorkshire, and after some agitation and conference with the rest of the people there, we came to a friendly and amicable conclu∣sion, that as they were within our pattent so they would forever be subject to this government, wherein they are well satisfied and find the benefitt thereof, as theire peti∣tion to his Highnes doth declare; nor was it matter of profitt that moved us hereunto, for we have neither re∣ceived or expected any thereby, but the obligation of dutie that lay upon us to see the people within our pattent go∣verned according to God, and hath been our diligent care and indeavour, and so shall allwayes be, that all just pos∣sessions and improvements shall be preserved and confirm∣ed to the true proprietors there, as it is amongst the rest of the inhabitants that have beene under our government from the beginning. There are severall other scat∣tered inhabitants that live betwixt our lyne and Colonel Temple's, some whereof observing the benefitt theire

neighbours have reaped by good government, have offer∣ed themselves to us, which yet wee are slow to accept of, because without our limits, which we desire not to enlarge, but conceive it would much conduce to the peace and wellfaire of the English in these parts, if they were layd to Col. Temple's jurisdiction or this, if his Highness please so to order it (as we have intimated in our letter to my Lord Fienes, &amp;c.)</P>
<P>Concerneing those letters from persons of honour, al∣ledged by Mr. Godfrey to have been sent to the governour and magistrates in favour of him, wee never received and so could returne no answer, and for himselfe, he was one of those that did submitt to this government, accepted of commission from hence and tooke the oath of freemen, and that without any force or compulsion at all, none being used towards him or any other, as is unduely suggested in the petition; and it is no strange thing that Mr. Winslow, Mr. Dudley, &amp;c. should long since, before our limitts were ex∣actly knowne, seeme to owne those for distinct govern∣ments which in truth were none, but included in this of ours, as upon the running of our lyne did manifestly appeare.</P>

<PB N="323" REF="011300_0164_0F86CB3E942B77A8"/>
of your and the countryes concernes that neyther myselfe nor any other for you can heare from you; the conside∣ration whereof had almost wrought me to a resolve of neglecting this opportunity of presenting my due respects in giveing you any account of others motions in England concerneing you; but least you should have cause of chargeing me with neglect I have set pen to paper, to let you understand what I heare in relation to New England. The complaynants against you to the Kings majesty, as I am informed, are Mr. Godfrey and that company, Mr. Reckes and Sefford and company of iron workes, some of the sometymes fyned and imprisoned petitioners, whoe thought, first, to have made theyr complaynts severally, after, resolved in joint by petition; moved to have the quakers and anabaptists joyned but they refused. I have endea∣voured to have a sight of theyr petition but cannot pro∣cure it; but am informed that, haveing mentioned the articles they petition for, the distance of place does not ad∣mit of a way of heareing as being nigher it might. They move that a generall governour may be sent to give reliefe to them. To this petition they get what hands they can of persons that have been in New England, though never inhabitants. The quakers I heare have been with the King concerneing your putting to death those of theyr friends executed at Boston. The generall vogue of peo∣ple is that a governour will be sent over. Other rumours there are concerneing you, but I omitt them, not knowing how to move and appeare at court on your behalfe, I made bold to address myself to the Lord Say and desyred his favour that in case of complaynts to his majesty he would be your friend, so far as to desyre his majesty that you might be heard before any thing were determined concerneing you as to judgment. His lordship professed his greate respect for the plantations and thanked God he prayed for you dayly, promising to improve his interest according to my motion. I likewise addressed myselfe to the Earle of Manchester, Lord Chamberlaine, who pro∣mised the like. By the ships that are expected I perceive
<PB N="324" REF="011300_0165_0F86CB3F429B8E88"/>
that some of those that complaine doe expect that you will impower some to appeare for you, and thereupon make some demurr in theyr prosecution, but if that be not, then they intend to have something done against the spring of the yeare. The peace with Spayne was proclaimed in London 11th instant, upon the same articles concluded in his late majestyes tyme. Episcopacy, common prayer, boweing at the name of Jesus, signe of the cross in bap∣tisme, the altar and organs are in use and like to be more.

<P>MAY it please your Majesty, in the day wherein you happily say you know you are King over your British Israel, to cast a favourable eye upon your poore Mephibosheth, now and, by reason of lameness in respect of distance, not untill now appearing in your presence, wee mean upon New England, kneeling with the rest of your subjects before your Majestie as her restored King. Wee forget not our ineptness as to these approaches; wee at present owne such impotence as renders us unable to ex∣cuse our impotency of speaking unto our Lord the King; yet contemplating such a King who hath also seen adver∣sity, that he knoweth the hearts of exiles, who himself hath been an exile, the aspect of Majesty, extraordinarily influ∣enced, animateth exanimated outcasts, yet outcasts as wee hope for the truth, to make this address unto their Prince, hoping to find grace in your sight. Wee present this
<PB N="326" REF="011300_0166_0F86CB400A3AD9C8"/>
script, the transcript of our loyall hearts, into your royall hands, wherein we crave leave to supplicate your Majesty for your gracious protection of us in the continuance both of our civill as of our religious liberties (according to the grantees known end of suing for the pattent) conferred upon this plantation by your royall father. This, this, viz. our libertie to walke in the faith of the gospell with all good conscience, according to the order of the gospell (unto which the former in these ends of the earth is but subser∣vient) was the cause of our transporting ourselves with our wives, little ones, and our substance, from that pleasant land over the Atlantick ocean into the vast wilderness, choosing rather the pure scripture worship with a good conscience in this remote wilderness among the heathen, than the plea∣sures of England with submission to the impositions of the then so disposed and so far prevailing hierarchy, which we could not doe without an evill conscience. For this cause we are this day in a land which lately was not sowne, wherein we have conflicted with the sufferings thereof much longer than Jacob was in Syria. Our witness is in heaven that we left not our native country upon any dissa∣tisfaction as to the constitution of the civill state. Our lot, after the example of the good old nonconformists, hath been only to act a passive part throughout these late vicissi∣tudes and successive overturnings of states. Our sepera∣tion from our brethren in this desart hath been and is a sufficient bringing to mind the afflictions of Joseph: But providentiall exemption of us hereby from the late warres and temptations of either party we account as a favour from God; the former cloaths us with sackcloth, the latter with innocency. What reception, courtesy and equanimity, those greater, and others, adherers to the royall interest, who in their adverse changes visited these parts, were en∣tertained with amongst us, according to the meaness of our condition, we appeal to their own reports.</P>
<P>Touching complaints put in against us, our humble request only is, that for the interim, while we are as dumb by reason of our absence, your Majesty would permit no∣thing
<PB N="327" REF="011300_0166_0F86CB400A3AD9C8"/>
to make an impression on your royall heart against us, untill we have both opportunity and leave to answer for ourselves: Few will be innocent, said that impleader, if it be enough to deny: Few will be innocent, said the then Emperor, if it be enough to accuse. Concerning the quakers, open and capitall blasphemers, open seducers from the glorious Trinity, the Lord Jesus Christ, our Lord Jesus Christ, the blessed gospell, and from the holy scriptures as the rule of life, open enemies to the government itselfe as established in the hands of any but men of their owne principles, malignant and assiduous promoters of doctrines directly tending to subvert both our church and state, after all other meanes for a long time used in vaine, we were at last constrained for our owne safety to passe a sen∣tence of banishment against them, upon pain of death. Such was their dangerous and impetuous and desperate turbulence both to religion and state civill and ecclesiasti∣call, as that how unwillingly soever (could it have been avoyded) the magistrate at last, in conscience both to God and man, judged himself called for the defence of all, to keep the passage with the point of the sword held towards them, this could do no harm to him that would be warned thereby, their wittingly rushing themselves thereupon was their owne act, we with all humility conceive a crime bring∣ing their blood upon their owne head. The quakers died, not because of their other crimes how capitall soever, but upon their superadded presumptuous and incorrigible con∣tempt of authority breaking in upon us, notwithstanding their sentence of banishment made known to them; had they not been restrained, so far as appeared, there was too much cause to fear that we ourselves must quickly have died or worse, and such was their insolency that they would not be restrained, but by death; nay, had they at last but promised to depart the jurisdiction, and not to re∣turne without leave from authority, we should have been glad of such an opportunity to have said they should not dye. Let not the king hear mens words, your servants are true men fearing of God and the king, not given to change,

zealous of government, order, orthodox and peaceable in Israell; we are not seditious as to the interest of Caesar, nor schismaticks as to the matters of religion, we distin∣guish between churches and their impurity, between a living man, though not without sickness or infirmity, and no man; irregularities either in ourselves or others we desire to be amended, we could not live without the pub∣lick worship of God, nor permitted the publick worship without such a yoke of subscription and conformities we could not consent unto without sin. That we might therefore enjoy divine worship without humane mixtures, without offence to God, man, our owne consciences, with leave but not without teares departed from our country, kindred and fathers houses into this Pathmos, in relation whereunto we do not say our garments are become old by reason of the very long journey, but that ourselves, who came away in our strength, are by reason of long ab∣sence many of us become grey-headed, and some of us stooping for age.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">At a Generall Court held at Boston in New-England, 19th December 1660. Instructions for our honoured and loving friend Captain John Leverett, or in his absence Richard Saltonstall and Henry Ashurst, Esqrs.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. TO take the first opportunity that may be, in the best and most acceptable manner, to deliver the petitions, herewith sent, to his Majestie and high court of Parliament.</P>
<P N="2">2. To interest as many gentlemen of worth in parlia∣ment, or that are neere his Majestie, as possibly you may, to owne and favour our cause, and to beget in them a good opinion of us and our proceedings.</P>

<P N="4">4. If the King or parliament should demand what those priviledges are which wee desire the continuance of, your answer may be, all those which are graunted us by pattent and that wee have hitherto enjoyed in church and common wealth, without any other power imposed over us, or any other infringement of them, which would be destructive to the ends of our coming hither. As also that no appeale may be permitted from hence in any case civill or crimi∣nall, which would be such an intollerable and unsupport∣able burthen as this poore place (at this distance) are not able to undergoe, but would render authoritie and govern∣ment vaine and uneffectuall, and bring us into contempt with all sortes of people. And if you find the King and parliament propitious to us, to use your utmost endeavours for the renewing that ordinance that freed us from customs 10th March 42.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Massa. Hist.

<P N="5">5. Upon any matter of complaint, by any of his Ma∣jesties subjects or others, relating to the bounds and limitts of our pattent, our humble desire is that wee may have notice thereof and liberty to answer for ourselves (before any determination or conclusion be made against us) which being done, wee shall finally acquiesse in such issue as his Majesty, the high court of parliament, or any substituted by them, shall put thereto.</P>
<P N="6">6. If any particular be alledged relating to the iron-workes, the answer is, It was first heard and judged in an inferiour court and afterwards upon a full hearing and due consideration by the generall court, who gave judgment impartially, according to the pleas and evidences then pro∣duced, and shall be ready, if desired, upon new evidences and better pleas to allow another hearing thereof, and for further and more particular answer hereunto wee must referr you to what you know or hath binn formerly in∣formed from hence.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="331" REF="011300_0168_0F86CB4188430168"/>7. Concerning our proceedings against the Quakers, our answer is contained in our printed declaration and petition to his Majestie, which wee hope will satisfy, but if there should be any designe to encourage theire coming hither or his Majestie be induced to permitt them theire liberty heere (which God forbid) wee intreate you, above all things else, to use your utmost interest to prevent, as being destructive to our being heere and so contrary to our consciences to permitt, and no lesse oppression of us than the destroying both us and ours by the sword.</P>
<P N="8">8. To give us as full intelligence as may be by the first opportunity of all matters that concerne what you con∣ceive necessary to be done for our advantage.</P>

<P>WEE greet you well. It having pleased almighty God, after long trialls both of us and our people, to touch their hearts, at last, with a just sense of our right, and by their assistance to restore us peaceably and without bloud to the exercise of our regall authority for the good and wellfare of the nations committed to our charge. We have made it our care to settle our lately distracted king∣doms at home, and to extend our thoughts to increase the trade and advantages of our colonies and plantations abroad. Amongst which as wee consider New-England to be one of the chiefest, having enjoyed and grown up in a long and orderly establishment, so wee shall not come behind any of our royal predecessors in a just encouragement and protection of all our loving subjects there, whose applica∣tion unto us, since our late happy restoration, hath been very acceptable, and shall not want its due remembrance upon all seasonable occasions; neither shall we forget to make you and all our good people in those parts equal par∣takers of those promises of liberty and moderation to ten∣der consciences expressed in our gracious declarations; which though some persons in this our kingdom of des∣perate, disloyal and unchristian principles, have lately a∣bused to the publick disturbance and their owne destruc∣tion, yet wee are confident our good subjects in New-England will make a right use of it, to the glory of God, their own spiritual comfort and edification.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honourable Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WEE according to your honours order departed in search after Col. Goffe and Whaley (persons de∣clared traytors to his Majestie) from Boston May the 7th, 1661, about six a clock at night, and arrived at Harford the 10th day and repaired to Governour Winthrop and gave him your honours letter and his Majesties order for the apprehending of Col. Whaley and Goffe, who gave us an accompt that they did not stay there but went directly for New Haven, but informed us that one Symon Lobden guided them to the towne. The honourable Governour carried himselfe very nobly to us, and was very diligent to supply us with all manner of conveniencies for the prosecu∣tion of them, and promised all dilligent search should be made after them in that jurisdiction, which was after∣wards performed. The 11th day we arrived at Guild∣ford and repaired to the Deputy Governor, William Leete, and delivered him your honours letter and the coppie of his Majesties order for the apprehending of the aforesaid persons, with whome at that time was severall persons. After the perusal of them, he began to read them audibly, whereupon wee tould him it was convenient to be more private in such concernements as that was; upon which, withdrawing to a chamber, he tould us he had not seene the two Colonels not in nine weekes. We acquainted him of the information we had received that they were at Newhaven since that time he mentioned, and thereupon desired him to furnish us with horses, &amp;c. which was pre∣pared with some delays, which wee tooke notice of to him, and after our parting with him out of his house and in the
<PB N="335" REF="011300_0170_0F86CB43259EEF88"/>
way to the ordinary, came to us one Dennis Scranton and tould us he would warrant that Col. Goffe and Whaley. at the time of his speaking was harboured at the house of one Mr. Davenport, a minister at New-Haven, and that one Goodman Bishop of the towne of Guildford, was able to give us the lyke accompt, and that, without all question, Deputy Leete knew as much, and that Mr. Davenport had put in ten pounds worth of fresh provisions at one tyme in∣to his house, and that it was imagined it was purposely for the entertainment of them.</P>
<P>And the said Scranton said further, That Goffe and Whaley should say that if they had but two hundred friends that would but stand by them, they would not care for Old or New-England: Whereupon wee askt him if he would depose to that: He replied he would, that it was openly spoken by them in the head of a companie in the field a traineing. Which words was also confirmed by severall others, as allso information that Goffe and Whaley was seene verie lately betwixt the houses of Mr. Daven∣port and one Jones, and it was imagined that one lay at one of theire houses and the other at the others. Upon which wee went back to the Deputies and required our horses, with aide, and a power to search and apprehend them; horses was provided for us, but he refused to give us any power to apprehend them, nor order any other, and said he could doe nothing untill he had spoken with one Mr. Gilbert and the rest of the Magistrates: Upon which wee tould him wee should goe to New-Haven and stay till wee heard from him, but before wee tooke horse the aforesaid Dennis Scranton gave us information, there was an Indian of the towne wanting, which he tould us was to give notice of our comeing. But to our certaine know∣ledge one John Megges was sent a horseback before us, and by his speedie and unexpected goeing so early before day was to give them an information, and the rather be∣cause by the delayes was us'd it was breake of day before wee got to horse, soe hee got there before us; upon our suspicion wee required the Deputie that the said John
<PB N="336" REF="011300_0171_0F86CB43CF454D40"/>
Meggs might bee examined what his business was that might occasion his soe early goeing: To which the De∣putie answered that hee did not know any such thing, and refused to examine him; and being at Newhaven, which was on the 13th day, the Deputie arrived within two hours or thereabouts after us and came to us to the court cham∣ber, where wee againe acquainted him with the informa∣tion wee had received and that wee had cause to believe they were concealed in Newhaven, and thereupon wee required his assistance and aide for their apprehension: To which he answered that he did not believe they were. Whereupon wee desired him to impower us, or order others for it. To which he gave us this answer, That hee could not, nor would not make us magistrates: Wee replied, wee ourselves would personally adventure in the search and apprehension of them in two houses where wee had reason to imagine they lay hid, if they would give way to it and enable us: To which hee re∣plied, Hee neither would, nor could not doe any thinge untill the freemen were met together. To which wee set before him the danger of that delay and their inevatable escape, and how much the honour and service of his Ma∣jestie was despised and trampled on by him, and that wee supposed by his unwillingness to assist in the apprehension, hee was willing they should escape: After which hee left us and went to severall of the magistrates and were toge∣ther five or six hours in consultation, and upon breakeing up of their counsell, they tould us, they would not nor could not doe any thing untill they had called a generall court of the freemen: Whereupon wee represented to them your Honours and Governour Winthrops warrants as pre∣sidents, who upon the receite of his Majesties pleasure and order concerning the said persons, stood not upon such niceties and formallities, but endeavoured to make all ex∣pedition in seizing on them, if to bee found in their govern∣ment, and allso how your honour had recommended this grand affaire to him, and how much the honour and justice of his Majestie was concerned, and how ill his sacred Ma∣jestie
<PB N="337" REF="011300_0171_0F86CB43CF454D40"/>
would resent such horrid and detestable concealments and abettings of such traitors and regicides as they were, and askt him whether he would honour and obey the king or noe in this affaire, and sett before him the daunger which by law is incurred by any one that conceales or abetts traytors; to which the Deputie Leete answered, wee honour his Majestie, but wee have tender consciences.</P>
<P>To which wee replied, that wee believed that he knew where they were, and onely pretended tenderness of con∣science for a refusall: Upon which they drew into con∣sultation againe, and after two or three houres spent, in the evening the Deputie and Magistrates came to us at the head of the staires in the ordinarie, and takes one of us by the hand and wisht he had binn a plowman and had never binn in the office, since he found it soe weightie.</P>
<P>To which wee tould them, that for their respect to two traytors they would doe themselves injurie and possibly ruine themselves and the whole collony of Newhaven, and still continuing to presse them to their duty and loyaltie to his Majestie, and whether they would owne his Majestie or noe, it was answered, they would first knowe whether his Majestie would owne them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New-Haven was a government formed by a voluntary Combi∣nation, without any Charter, or Commission, or authority what∣soever from the Crown, or other Powers in England.</NOTE></P>
<P>This was the substance of our proceedings, there was other circumstantiall expressions which are too tedious to trouble your honour withall, and which wee have given your honour a verball accompt of, and conceive it needless to insist any further; and soe findeing them obstinate and pertenaceous in their contempt of his Majestie, wee came away the next day in prosecution after them, according to instructions, to the Governour of Manadas, from whome wee received civill respects and a promise, if they were within his jurisdiction, wee should command what ayde wee pleased, but for sending of them according to your honours request, hee could not answer it to his masters at home, but if they came there hee should give your honour timely notice: Whereupon we requested his honour the Go∣vernour

of Monada to lay a restraint upon all shipping from transporting of them, which hee promised should be donne, and allso to give order to his fiscall or chief officer to make private search in all vessells for them that were going thence.</P>
<P>Upon which, wee findeing any other meanes would bee ineffectuall, wee made our returne hither by sea, to give your honour an accompt, and to which (when your ho∣nour shall require it) are ready to depose to the truth of it, and remaine</P>

<P>THE council of our jurisdiction being assembled the 4th instant at Boston, ordered me to signify to you what lately they have receaved from England by Captain Leverett, his letter bearing date 12th April 1661, who tells us that however our addresse to his Majesty came seasonably and had a gracious answer, yett many com∣plaints and claims are multiplied against us, and that wee are like to heare from his Majesty's committee what those
<PB N="339" REF="011300_0172_0F86CB4481F0BC10"/>
complaints are, and what is expected from us; that an oath was produced against him for saying that rather then wee should or would admitt of appeales here, wee would or should sell the country to the Spaniards; which though he absolutely denyed that ever he so said, and that if he should have so said he had wronged the country very much, some of the said committee said the words if spoken they were pardoned, but they looked at the words not so much his as the spirit of the country, and tho' againe he desired that the country might not suffer, in theire minds, for what he knew was so much and so farre from them, as to thinke ought in any such respect, yet one of them proceeded to question him, whether if wee durst wee would not cast off our allegiance and subjection to his Majesty; He answer∣ed, he did apprehend wee were honest men and had de∣clared in our application to his Majesty the contrary, and therefore could not have such thoughts of us without the breach of charity; that it is no lesse than necessary we had some able person to appeare for us, well furnished to carry on our busines, which will not be without money; that the councill for plantations demanded of him whether wee had proclaimed the King and whether there was not much opposition to the agreeing of our application. He answer∣ed he knew not, only had heard Capt. Breaden say so, but humbly submitted to theire consideration, that neither wee nor any other were to be concluded by debates but by our conclusions, which were sent and presented to his Majesty in our names. They tooke notice, from enquiry, that it was only from one colony, namely, Massachusetts, and have theire considerations of the other colonies neg∣lects, to speake most favourably thereof. Thus farr as to the letter. Further, I am required to signify to you as from them, that the non attendance with dilligence to execute the Kings majestys warrant for the apprehending of Colonel Whaley and Goffe will much hazard the present state of these colonies and your owne particularly, if not some of your persons, which is not a little afflictive to them. And that in theire understanding there remaines no way to ex∣piate

the offence and preserve yourselves from the danger and hazard but by apprehending the said persons, who as wee are informed are yett remaining in the colony and not above a fortnight since were seen there, all which will be against you. Sir, Your owne welfare, the welfare of your neighbours, bespeake your unwearied paines to free yourselfe and neighbours. I shall not add, having so lately by a few lines from our Governour and myselfe looking much this way communicated our sence and thoughts of your and our troubles, and have as yett received no return, but commend you to God and his rich grace, for your guidance and direction in a matter of such moment, as his Majesty may receave full and just sattisfaction, the mouths of all opposers stopped and the profession of the truth that is in you and us may not in the least suffer by your actings is the prayer of</P>

<P>THAT majestie and benignitie both sate upon the throne whereunto your outcast made their former addresse, witnes this second eucharistical approach unto the best of kings, who to other titles of royaltie common to him with other gods amongst men, delighteth herein more peculiarly to conforme himselfe to the God of gods, in that he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, neither hath he hid his face from him, but when he cried he heard.</P>
<P>Our petition was the representation of an exiles necessi∣ties, this script gratulatory and lowly is the reflection of the gracious rayes of christian majestie. There wee be∣sought your favour by presenting to a compassionate eye that bottleful of teares shed by us in this Jeshimon: Here we also acknowledge the efficacie of regal influence to qualify these salt waters. The mission of ours was accom∣panied with these churches sitting in sackcloth, the recep∣tion of yours was as the holding forth of the scepter of life.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="011300_0174_0F86CB4875686CA0"/>The truth is, such were the impressions upon our spirits when we received an answer of peace from a gracious, from our gracious soveragne, as transcends the facultie of an eremitical scribe. Such, as though our expressions of them neede pardon, yet the suppression of them seemeth un∣pardonable. A desert condition, in some sense, is an ob∣ject fittest to magnifie princely radiance, inferior whereto cannot make the wildernes rejoice. Opake bodies occasion the most luculent reflections. Affection makes a rhetori∣cian. Craesus's dumbe son speaks to prevent miserie, and Zedaciah's tongue breaketh loose to acknowledge mercie. It was a day wherein your people, who had forgot pros∣peritie, the people, the joy of whose heart was long ceased, was revived in the matters of their God. Life from death is so much the more sweet. Gospel libertie, truely so called, is sweeter than life, especially when rescued from its contrarie more bitter than death, and yet more edul∣corated when resented as a signal pledge of the kindnes of the Lord in that evangelical promise kings shall be thy nursing fathers. It was a good day, and wee should not doe well to holde our tongue as concerning the heart conso∣lations of your sad abjects, the affectionate benedictions of your most serene highnes tempered with tears of joy, when warmed with the influence of your royal favour they, by way of congratulation, comforted themselves that the breath of our nostrils the anointed of the Lord hath escaped their pits of whom wee begin to say, under his shadow wee shall live amongst the heathen.</P>
<P>Wee are deeply sensible of your Majesty's intimation relating to instruments of Satan, acted by impulse diaboli∣cal. Venner (not to say whence he came to us) went out from us because he was not of us. God preserve your Majestie from all emissaries agitated by an infernal spirit, under what appellation soever disguised. Luther some∣time wrote to the senate of Mulhoysen to beware of the wolfe Muncer.</P>

<HEAD>Proceedings of the Committee of the General Court appointed for the dispatch of Agents to England.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The colony at this time was divided upon the expediency of sending agents to England. The Governor and Deputy Go∣vernor were against it, and though appointed to be of the com∣mittee declined acting. The agents themselves seem to have been pressed into the service. They feared a long detention in England and were not sure that they were intirely free from danger of restraint upon their liberty. Complaints had been preferred against the colony from all quarters. Mr. Bradstreet had been a magistrate from the beginning. It was well known that the elders or clergy used to be consulted and had great in∣fluence in every affair of moment, and Mr. Norton was of that order and of great note. Besides, it was doubtful what would be the fate of the charter. If taken away they would not know where to obtain satisfaction for any extraordinary expence or trouble in England.</P>

<P>THE honored generall court not having leisure to communicate, unto their messengers intended, the matter of their mission with an opportunity to consider thereof, and upon its communication by the honored com∣mittee theire appeared these ensuing and unexpected difficulties.</P>
<P N="1">1. Two of the magistrates either not giving their placet, or signifying their non-placet as to the mission at this time, the governor and deputy governor being two of them, and though members of the committee, yet declining so much as to owne the busines with their presence.</P>

<P N="4">4. The hazard of the undertaking, in the judgment of the honored committee, so sensible thereof as that they thought meete to order the messengers (whose coming can∣not

<P>Wee in respect of the premisses (that wee may have, up∣on occasion, to answer for and sattisfie ourselves in time to come) doe conceive it our part and duty not to conceale the prementioned discouragement, but thereupon to offer to the committees solemn consideration whether it be not more elligible to improove the power committed to them, rather for the deferring then for the putting on the pre∣sent mission intended, touching which question, if they in∣cline to the negative, wee hope the best, but if after all they shall still determine for the affirmative a meete mes∣sage with other requisites provided, wee hope wee shall not be wanting to the duty of patience therein, though destitute of that encouragement which was fundamentall to our acceptance, and in defect whereof our hope was that the authority of this colony would not have expected this service from us, <HI>fiat voluntas dei.</HI></P>

<HEAD>To which the Committee returned this answer.</HEAD>
<P>THE committee, taking the premisses into their serious consideration, cannot but look upon it as a humbling providence of God towards his poore people, that whilst they are endeavouring (and as they hope in some measure of sincere love to the Lord his truth and ordinances) to wait on God in the use of all lawfull means left unto them for the preservation of such high favours as in sundry respects he hath been pleased to betrust us withall, that so many clouds should hover over our heads for the darkning our pathes, and stumbling blocks appearing in our way to hinder the same, yet neverthelesse being persuaded that not only prudentiall arguments referring to our owne peace and safety, but also the honor of the Lords name, church and wayes, which is now principally shott at by our ad∣versaries,
<PB N="351" REF="011300_0178_0F86CB51C5AE0290"/>
doeth call aloud upon us not to delay the use of all lawful meanes, and this propounded being upon mature councills in sundry debates agreed upon as the best expe∣dient conducing to such an end, doe account it their duty (the said objections notwithstanding) to further the said gentlemen in the discharge of the trust reposed in them, and cannot consent to any unnecessary delay therein.</P>
<P>Further briefly to the several partes.</P>
<P>To the first, The committee doe indeed concurr with the commissioners that a more full and explicite acting of the said honored gentlemen, were very desirable, but yet not essentially necessary. The honored governor having manifested himself willing not only to give his approbation to such commission instructions and particulars as shall be orderly agreed upon, as also to sign the same according to the appointment of the generall court.</P>
<P>To the second, The committee conceive there is no doubt on their part as to this message, nor yet any incon∣sistency of what they have propounded with what the general court agreed upon, but such as may be rationally interpreted to be the true meaning of the power com∣mitted to them.</P>
<P>To the third, The committee doe conceive they are already agreed of the message, viz. the commissions in∣structions and petitions as in the former returnes.</P>
<P>To the fourth, That as yet no act hath beene passed by them of such tendency, only some proposals, where they have rather expressed their tender respect towards our honored and deare friends, than any just reason that they have for the entertaining such fears.</P>
<P>Finally, the committee doe propose as a further expe∣dient for the satisfaction of our honored commissioners, that they themselves would be pleased to consider and present unto us what themselves apprehend there yet remains to be done by us for their furtherance in this so great an un∣dertaking, and we hope we shall not be found wanting to their encouragement in what we may.</P>

Wee have appointed these our messengers to wait upon your honour (according to your wonted bene∣ficence) to cast your eye upon them and us, in doing where∣of wee shall have cause to pray for, the rich blessing of heaven and earth to descend upon you and yours. So wee trust the God of all grace and glory will not fail to accept and recompence all kindnes extended to this little part of his heritage, so we remaine,</P>

There∣fore if it may please your honour to promote this errand of your humble suppliants and vouchsafe your countenance to our messengers and procure favour and accesse to his Majesty and his ministers of state, you will greatly oblige your servants to blesse God for you, and to pray that the blessing of heaven and earth may rest upon yor head and heart in Christ Jesus in whom wee are,</P>

<P>Such is the all-wise providence of God towards us, that after no little travell for the attaineing of meet persons from among ourselves, for our messengers, to appeare be∣fore his Majesty and most honorable councell on the be∣halfe of this colony, together with provision according to our poore ability for such a dispatch, it hath pleased the Lord to frustrate our designe by disinabling one of our said messengers by sicknes, even then when there remained nothing but their going aboard, whereupon the ship hath been put upon demurrage, even to the hazzard both of ship and cargo, by reason of the ice in this cold country, so that we are now forced to send away the addresse to his Majesty with letters to some lords of his honorable coun∣cell without our messengers accompanying the same, we being wholly uncapable to impower any other, not having an opportunity to convene our generall court for the com∣missioning of some other in his stead.</P>
<P>Our request is therefore to yourselves, jointly or seve∣rally, as God may give you opportunity, after the perusall of the inclosed to seale up the same, and then improve

<P>As also our request is to yourselves that you be pleased to further our request to his Majesty, being to us a mat∣ter of great importance, and wherein, as we conceive, the glory of our God is not a little concerned.</P>
<P>What moneys you expend on this our busines charge it to our account, and we shall readily and thankfully owne the same; and we are confidently perswaded he whose name and glory is so greatly interested in our quarrell with those cursed hereticks, will also owne your labour and travell herein, their mallice being not so much against our persons and estates, as against his truth and ordinances, under which we have here desired to shrowd ourselves.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE experience we have had of your cordiall affec∣tion to his Majesty's poore subjects, circumstanced with the distance and meanes of so remote a wildernes con∣dition, doth embolden to the troubling your honor with these lines.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="011300_0189_0F86CB63160AD668"/>Such is the good pleasure of him who ruleth all things according to his own will, that when with no little travell and difficulty wee had attained two meet persons from amongst ourselves for our messengers to our lord the King, with some provisions for such an undertaking, according to our poore ability, it hath pleased the Lord to frustrate all our endeavours by his visitation of one of them (i.e.) the Rev. Mr. John Norton, whereby he is disinabled to attend that service; the which, as to ourselves, the dis∣appointment is great, and we cannot but look upon it as an humbling and awfull providence, and that the rather, in that our adversaries thereby have occasion given them to triumph, and to boast themselves that the Lord fighteth against us.</P>
<P>Sir, Your selfe being not long since on the place, we neede not to trouble you with an account of our condition as now circumstanced with the malignancy of our adver∣saries, especially bent against the interest of the Lord and his poore people here, as yourself do well know, who while they plead with that wicked Haman, that our laws are divers from all people, and do accuse us of disobedience to the laws of our king, and that it is not for his Majesty's profit to suffer us, pretending great profit to his Majesty in case their enterprises may be atchieved, although wee may truly say the enemy in so doing could not counter∣vayle the king's damage.</P>
<P>Our request to your selfe is, that according to the op∣portunity God hath put into your hands, you will be pleased to further those gentlemen to whome we have committed the trouble of accompanying our addresse to his Majesty together with your presence countenancing of the same, if you shall see meete, and to be futher instru∣mentall, wherein you truly may, for the removing of any offence that this our disappointment may occasion; assur∣ing his Majesty (as wee hope you have charity towards us) that, however we are loaded with the calumnies of our ad∣versaries, we shall alwayes approve ourselves to be those that feare the Lord and honour our King.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="011300_0190_0F86CB64F627A1D8"/>Sir, We have not to perswade hereto with motives of our owne deserts or with future obligations. You well knowing our condition, how circumstanced, with so great distance and meaness, utterly incapacitating to a suitable returne of your favour; yet we hope you will not find us uncivill in not acknowledging the same. And however it fares with us, you may assure yourselfe that he who keepeth a register of all hearts and thoughts, Mal. 3.16 yea even of a cup of cold water, will not be unmindfull of your labour of love, into whose armes of mercy and blessing in Christ Jesus committing you and all your weighty affaires, we remaine</P>

<P>A Letter of yours being brought hither, directed to Mr. Ashurst and Mr. Hutchinson, though the for∣mer of these two gentlemen did by the last ship, as he tells us, acknowledge the receipt of it, and intimate the reasons of our silence, yet we now thinke it meete to assure you also ourselves how acceptable it was to us to be informed, partly by that letter of yours and partly by the relation of some learned ministers that came a while since from New-England, that you continue your care and concerne for the propagation of the gospel of Christ amongst the poore Indians, and we are glad that through the goodnes of God wee are now in a condition to informe you that since the receipt of your lately mentioned letter, it hath pleased the king's majesty (in councill) to grant a charter of incorporation, wherein many of the nobility and other persons of quality, and most of those gentlemen that were
<PB N="375" REF="011300_0190_0F86CB64F627A1D8"/>
formerly imployed in the like worke are authorized and appointed to endeavour the carrying on of that pious de∣signe (for converting the heathen natives) wherein they deservedly esteeme it both an honor and advantage to be imployed in this new establishment, being among other particulars enjoyned to appointe commissioners in New-England to prosecute there by our directions his Majesties pious intentions; wee judge this to be a matter of the highest concernment that belongs to the worke intrusted to us, for all our endeavours here and all the supplies wee may procure from hence, will be but ineffectuall, though not to our owne souls, yet to the worke wee would pro∣mote, unlesse there be a prudent and faithfull management of what wee send over, by the commissioners wee shall ap∣point in New-England, and those that they shall employ, and therefore since, having obtained the best information wee can and seriously considered the matter, we have pitched on the same course that have beene formerly taken in pursuance of the same ends and care, and accordingly determined at present to desire you to take upon you againe the care and management of this worke upon the place, wee hope you will descerne how great a trust wee wil∣lingly repose in you, and wee doubt not of your readines to comply (as formerly you have done) with our directions herein. The busines wherein wee desire to engage you being such as wee thinke it truly honorable to be engaged in ourselves, and the designe being of a nature to which the greatest and most precious promisses are annexed, be∣sides that the civilizing and converting of your barbarous and unbelieving neighbours is that whose successe will be in some regards of more immediate advantage to your selves than to us, our good wishes to so christian a worke makes it much our troble to see that the meanes of carry∣ing it on are no greater then wee now at our entrance find them, which wee mention, not by way of reflection on those to whose hands the management of them was com∣mitted before the grant of the charter, but because it is necessary for us to acquainte you with the condition wee
<PB N="376" REF="011300_0191_0F86CB665560BF70"/>
are brought to, partly by the great charge you and wee have been at on severall necessary occasions, and partly (and indeed chiefly) by the injurious dealing of some who take advantage of the letter of the law, against all justice and equitie, to repossesse themselves of what they formerly sold, whereby the greatest part of our revenue is at present detained, which will prove, wee feare, very expensive and somewhat difficult to recover, and therefore wee desire as little money may be drawne on us for this yeare to come as will possibly consist with the not neglecting of what is necessary to be done, wee say for this next yeare because wee cannot be so dispondent as not to hope that the pro∣vidence of God will, by some meanes or other, provide for the supply of a worke so much tending to his owne glory, and so acceptable to those that are so heartily concerned for it. The bill of £.800 drawne for the use of the Indian worke is for the most part paid, and should have been en∣tirely so ere now, were it not for the want of present money. That which is from time to time laid out wee de∣sire may, according to your commendable practice, be sent us over in a particular within the yeare, and it may assist us in the regulating our expences, if you be pleased to let us know, by the first conveniency, what further charge you judge you shall be putt to by perfecting the printing of the bible; the use of that divine booke and also a constant use of catechising, wee judge most necessary for the Indians instruction in religion; and wee also thinke it may conduce to unity and order if the same catechisme be generally taught amongst them. If our stocke do increase, which wee hope it hereafter may, especially since his Majesty himselfe has been graciously pleased particularly to counte∣nance this worke, and to secure both what hath been, and what may be given towards it, by a legall settlement, which before was wanting; if (wee say) our meanes in∣crease we should consider of some employment in the way of trade and manufacture to imploy the Indians, or if in the interim there occurrs to you any thinge about this or any other matter that you judge may tend to the promot∣ing
<PB N="377" REF="011300_0191_0F86CB665560BF70" MS="y"/>

<P>TRUSTY and well beloved, Wee greete you well. Whereas wee have lately received an humble ad∣dress and petition from the generall court of our colony of the Massachusetts in New England, presented to us by Symon Bradstreet and John Norton, Wee have thought it agreeable to our princely grace and justice to lett you know that the same have been very acceptable unto us, and that wee are satisfyed with your expressions of loyalty, duty and good affection made to us in the said address, which wee doubt not proceeds from the hearts of our good sub∣jects, and Wee are therefore willing that all our good sub∣jects of that plantation do know that Wee doe receive them into our gracious protection, and will cherish them with our best incouragement, and that Wee will preserve, and doe hereby confirme the pattent and charter heretofore graunted to them by our royall father of blessed memory, and that they shall freely injoy all the priviledges and li∣bertyes graunted to them in and by the same, and that Wee will be ready to renew the same charter to them,
<PB N="378" REF="011300_0192_0F86CB6706977C18"/>
under our great seale of England, whenever they shall de∣sire it. And because the licence of these late ill times have likewise had an influence upon our colony, in which they have swerved from the rules prescribed, and even from the government instituted by the charter, which wee doe graciously impure rather to the iniquity of the time than to the evill intents of the hearts of those who exercised the government there. And Wee doe therefore publish and declare our free and gracious pardon to all our subjects of that our plantation, for all crimes and offences committed against us during the late troubles, except any such persons who stand attaynted by our parliament here of high trea∣son, if any such persons have transported themselves into those parts; the apprehending of whom and delivering them into the hands of justice Wee expect from the dutiful and affectionate obedience of those our good subjects in that colony, if they be found within the jurisdiction and limmitts thereof. Provided always, and be it in our de∣clared expectation, that upon a review of all such lawes and ordinances that are now or have been during these late troubles in practise there, and which are contrary or derogative to our authority and government, the same may be annulled and repealed, and the rules and prescriptions of the said charter for administring and taking the oath of allegiance be henceforth duly observed, and that the ad∣ministration of justice be in our name.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These are made the conditions of the Pardon which the King may annex as he thinks fit, on the performance whereof the vali∣dity of the Pardon will depend. What follows seems to be ra∣ther a requisition or recommendation of certain acts upon the performance whereof depends his Majesty's further grace and favour. This is called a Letter and certainly was not a Pardon under the great seal. It is however often claimed as a Grant or Charter as well for the remission of all Offences as for the con∣firmation of all Liberties and Privileges granted by Patent.</NOTE> And since the principle and foundation of that charter was and is the freedom of liberty of conscience, Wee do hereby charge and require you that that freedom and liberty be duely admitted and allowed, so that they that desire to use the booke of common prayer and performe their devotion in

that manner that is established here be not denyed the ex∣ercise thereof, or undergoe any prejudice or disadvantage thereby, they using theire liberty peaceably without any disturbance to others; and that all persons of good and honest lives and conversations be admitted to the sacrament of the Lords supper, according to the said booke of com∣mon prayer, and their children to baptisme. Wee cannot be understood hereby to direct or wish that any indulgence should be graunted to those persons commonly called Qua∣kers, whose principles being inconsistent with any kind of government, Wee have found it necessary, with the advise of our parliament here, to make a sharp law against them, and are well content you doe the like there. Although Wee have hereby declared our expectation to be that the charter graunted by our royall father, and now confirmed by us, shall be particularly observed, yet, if the number of assistants injoyned thereby be found by experience, and be judged by the country, to be inexpedient, as Wee are in∣formed it is, Wee then dispence with the same, and declare our will and pleasure, for the future, to be, that the num∣ber of the said assistants shall not exceed 18, nor be less at any time than 10, Wee assuring ourselves, and obliging and commanding all persons concerned that, in the election of the governor or assistants, there be only consideration of the wisdome and integrity of the persons to be chosen, and not of any faction with reference to their opinion or pro∣fession, and that all the freeholders of competent estates, not vicious in conversations, orthodox in religion (though of different perswasions concerning church-government) may have their vote in the election of all officers civill or military. Lastly, our will and pleasure is that at the next generall court of that our colony this our letter and de∣claration be communicated and published, that all our lo∣ving subjects may know our grace and favour to them, and that Wee doe take them into our protection as our loving and dutifull subjects, and that Wee will be ready from time to time to receive any application or address from them, which may concerne their interest and the

<P>THE state of this country as to its constitution and settlement under the favour of his Majesty's pattents, and that these governments according to their constitution thereby, have been carried an end some longer some shorter tyme, is well knowne. That of Plymouth was the first settlement, but that of the Massachusetts though begun diverse years after, yet by God's speciall blessing is the most prosperose and considerable both for people and trade. For the manner of government though 'tis under an annuall election according to pattent, yet the persons seldome chang'd or remov'd but by death or their owne removing out of the collony. The present state of the collonies through Gods great mercy is a state of peace and under the injoyment of a competency for the conti∣nuance whereof wee have dependance upon the conti∣nuance of that mercy of God and his Majesty's graciose

<P>This summer wee have been under some trouble by the pagan natives, who have had their plottings and con∣trivances for our disquiet, but the Lord hath prevented it, blessed be his name, and there is a better understanding now betweene the English and them than there was in the spring of the yeare. Some small disturbance there hath beene at a place called Packatuck, betweene Conec∣ticott and Rhoad Island; the question betweene them is in poynt of jurisdiction, and its credibly reported that Rhoad Island have chosen one Mr. John Clarke<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I suppose this to be the same Person who was sentenced to be fined or whipped for his antipaedobaptistical tenets, and who afterwards removed to Rhode Island where his posterity remain in repute to this day. See p. 309.</NOTE> their deputy governor, and intend to send him to complaine to his Majesty of Conecticott. Conecticott have offered to referr the matter to the two colonies of Massachusetts and Plimouth, to which motion diverse of Rhoad Island would concur but others refuse, upon what ground is not under∣stood. These colonies not being interested in the quarrell or reason of it (though some of the inhabitants may be in the land, or claim an interest therein, but the government doe not) soe that that course might have been neighbourly to have tryed for an issue that way, before there had been giving a trouble to his Majestie in so small a matter as it is supposed that will prove to be when heard; however, it is a certaine truth that the collony of the Massachusetts is not at all ingaged and not soe much as acquainted with it further then report. If soe be that from the complaints of Rhoad Island men, or any others, any thing should be reflected upon the collony of the Massachusetts, may wee by the means of any friend or friends but obtaine the favour to be heard before wee are concluded with those complained against, or have any conclusion made of us, it will be a verry high obligation unto us. Another thing desirable is, that wee may be advized what motions there

may be concerning us, if any, whether for our advantage or disadvantage. 'Tis well knowne that many have been the attempts to give us disquiet or interruption in the worke the Lord hath set us about in this wildernesse, and wee cannot thinke that wee are yet without ill-wishers. But God that hath prevented and disapoynted all hitherto, can and will, soe far as it may concur with his own coun∣cills and good pleasure, which hath appeared to be coun∣cills of much peace towards an unworthy people, for which let his holy name be forever praised by us in a way of believing, that wee may be able to say in truth, this God is our God who was our fathers and will be our guide unto death.</P>

<P>TRusty and well beloved we greet you well; whereas our trusty and well beloved Ferdinando Gorges, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> hath by his humble petition informed us that his grand∣father Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Knight, deceased, being a person who laid himself forth very much for the advanc∣ing of forraine plantations, and particularly that of New-England in America, did in the fifteenth year of the raign of our late royal father of blessed memory, obtain a grant under the great seale of England, for a certain part and portion of the said country, which by the said patent was entitled the province of Meyne and (as the petitioner af∣firms, he hath heard from several persons of worth) he the said Sir Firdinando Gorges did expend in planting several parts of New-England above twenty thousand pounds sterling; and when he was in hopes to receive some advantage in recompence of his great disbursements afore∣mentioned, the late unhappy warres breaking out in Eng∣land,
<PB N="386" REF="011300_0196_0F86CB6A01EB3600"/>
he the said Ferdinando Gorges (though betwixt three and fourscore years of age) did personally engage in our royal fathers service, and particularly in the siege of Bristol, by reason whereof when it was necessary for him to appear before the councel and committees for forraine plantations, he was wholly discountenanced by them, even to the en∣couraging of the people in the said province to disown his government, which had continued for several years unin∣terrupted, and a party of the inhabitants of the said pro∣vince, petitioning the governors of the Massachusetts Bay, that they would also take upon them the government of the said province; in pursuance of that petition, those who had the government of the said Bay did from thenceforth take upon them the government of the said province, so as both the said Sir Ferdinando, the petitioners father, and himself, have ever since been thereby deprived of the issues and profits of said province. Now in regard of the pre∣mises, and for as much as those agents who were lately imployed to address themselves unto us, on the behalf of the governours and inhabitants of the said Bay, being on the behalf of the petitioner charged before our privy council for usurping the government of the said province, did declare that those whom they represented did not claim any title in, or interest to the said province; but did onely govern the same untill orders from hence were sent over for the government thereof, on the behalf of the petitioner: upon whose humble supplications, we were graciously pleased to refer the allegations aforesaid to the considera∣tion of our counsel learned in the law, who have made re∣port unto us, that they have considered thereof, and do find that Sir Ferdinando Gorges aforementioned, in the fifteenth year of the raigne of our royal father, obtained a grant to him and his heirs under the great seal of England of a part of New-England in America, called by the name of the province of Meyne, to be held as of the mannor of East Greenwich, under certain rents and conditions in the letters pattents expressed, and that it appeared by several affidavits and certificates of credible persons that the said
<PB N="387" REF="011300_0196_0F86CB6A01EB3600"/>
Sir Ferdinando Gorges had the possession of the said pro∣vince without any disturbance, and did govern the same ac∣cording to the directions of the said letters pattent for some years, expended above twenty thousand pounds in the plantation thereof, that when he had made such pro∣gress in the said plantation as that he expected to reap some profit and advantage thereby, the unhappy warres break∣ing out in England Sir Ferdinando Gorges was in actual service in the said warres for our royal father, by reason whereof he was a great sufferer, plundered and imprisoned several times and thereby disabled from any further ex∣pences in carrying on the said plantation, the rather for that he was so discouraged and discountenanced by the then pretended commissioners for forraine plantations, as that his commissioners were forced to come from the said plantation, and so lost the possession, and the inhabitants thereof petitioned the governours of the Massachusets or Bay of Boston, to take them under their government, which accordingly they did, and have continued under their go∣vernment ever since, and the petitioners commissioners since our restauration have endeavoured to take possession of the said province for the petitioner (being heir to his grandfather) and proclaimed us, began to hold courts as formerly, and to administer the oathes of allegiance and supremacy, but were disturbed and hindered therein by the said governours of the Massachusets or the Bay of Boston, who required the commissioners to proceed no further on the behalf of the petitioner untill they had or∣der from the supream authority of England, untill which time they commanded the inhabitants of that province to continue under their government: We have taken the whole matter into our princely consideration, and finding the petitioners allegations and report of our said councel learned so consonant, we have thought fit to signifie our pleasure on the behalf of the said Ferdinando Gorges the petitioner, hereby requiring you that you forthwith make restitution of the said province unto him or his commissio∣ners, and deliver him or them the quiet and peaceable pos∣session

The truth of which wee beleeve as wee ought to doe the words of soe gra∣cious a King.</P>
<P>But alasse, Sir, The commission impowering those com∣missioners to heare and determine all cases whatever, mi∣litary, criminall or civill (what they have further by in∣struction at present wee know not) should it take place, what would become of our civill government which hath binn, under God, the heade of that libertie for our con∣sciences for which the first adventurers passed thorough
<PB N="389" REF="011300_0197_0F86CB6ADDB05F50"/>
and bore all difficulties and discouragements that encoun∣tered them as in the way toe soe in their continuance in this wildernes? Sir, Wee returne you our true and har∣ty thankes for your former favours and crave the continu∣ance thereof as opportunity shall offer and the great mover of harts shall inclyne you in appearing our friend still, that if possible the commission may be recalled; for which end wee have made our humble supplication to his Majestie, in whose eyes may wee find favour, wee and our posterity shall have cause to blesse the Lord. But if the decree be past soe that it cannot be recalled, wee shall waight the Lords issue with us; and whatever may be the conjectures of any, rendering alterations here adviseable, the issue will speake them to be the subversion of all that which makes this place or our abode therein desireable. Or if the envy of those that desire a dominion over us (not to serve his Majesties interest in advancing plantation worke with the countenance of godlines, but to serve themselves by his Majesties authority and our ruin) shall prevaile, it will to posterity be rendered a disservice, to his Majesties disho∣nor, and such a dammage as the procurers will not be able to repay us. Wee can sooner leave our place and all our pleasant outward injoyments than leave that which was the first ground of wandering from our native country, nor are wee thereby made such strangers thereto but wee can ra∣ther chuse to return and take up our lott with our bre∣thren than abide here under the deprivement of the end of our travells. Our way is with the Lord. Craving your honnors pardon, for this bouldness, and offering up our best desires to the Lord for you, wee remaine</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sirs,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HIS Majesty hath heard this petition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix to History of Massachusets Bay, V. I. p. 537.</NOTE> read to him and hath well weighed all the expressions therein, and the temper and spirit of those who framed it, and doth not impute the same to his colony of the Massachusets, amongst whom he knowes the major part consists of men well af∣fected to his service and obedient to his government, but he hath commanded me to let you kow that he is not pleased with this petition and lookes upon it as the contrivance of a few persons who have had too long authority there, and who use all the artifices they can to infuse jealousies into his good subjects there and apprehensions as if their charter were in danger, when it is not possible for his Majestie to doe more for the securing it or to give his subjects there more assurance that it shall not any degree be infringed, than he hath already done, even by his late commission and commissioners sent thither, who are so far from having the least authority to infringe any clause in the said charter, that it is the principall end of their journey, so chargea∣ble to his Majestie, to see that the charter be fully and punctually observed; his Majestie did expect thankes and acknowledgments, from that his colony, of his fatherly care in sending his commissioners thither, and which he doubts not he shall receive from the rest of his colonies in those parts, and not such unreasonable and groundlesse complaint as is contained in your petition, as if he had thereby intended to take away your priviledges and to drive you from your habitations, without the least mention of any misdemeanour or miscarriage in any one of the said commissioners or in any one particular; nor can his Ma∣jestie comprehend (except you believe that by granting your charter he hath parted with his soveraigne power
<PB N="391" REF="011300_0198_0F86CB6B887BB508"/>
over his subjects there) how he could proceed more gra∣ciously, or indeed any other way, upon so many complaints presented to him by particular persons of injustice done contrary to the constitution of that government; from the other colonies for the oppression they pretend to undergoe by the power of that of the Massachusets, by extending their bounds and their jurisdiction further than they ought to doe, as they pretend; from the natives for the breach of faith and intolerable pressures layed upon them, as they alledge, contrary to all kind of justice, and even to the dishonour of the English nation and christian faith, if all they alledge be true; I say, his Majestie cannot compre∣hend how he could apply proper remedies to these evills, if they are reall, or how he could satisfy himselfe whether they are reall or noe by any other way or meanes than by sending commissioners thither to examine the truth and grounds of all the alligations, and for the present to com∣pose the differences the best they can, untill upon a full and clear representation thereof to his Majesty, who can∣not but expect the same from them, his Majesties owne finall judgment and determination may be had, and it hath pleased God so far already to blesse that service that its no small benefit his Majestie and his English colonies in those partes have already received by the said commissioners in the removall of so inconvenient neighbours as the Dutch have been for these late years, and which would have been a more spreading and growing mischiefe in a short time, if it had not been removed. To conclude, I am com∣manded by his Majestie to assure you againe of your full and peaceable enjoyment of all the priviledges and liberties granted to you by his charter, which he hath heretofore and doth now againe offer to renew to you, if you shall desire it, and that you may further promise yourselves all the protection, countenance and encouragement that the best subjects ever received from the most gracious Prince; in returne whereof he doth only expect that duty and chearfull obedience that is due to him, and that it may not be in the power of any malicious person to make you

miserable by entertaining any unnecessary and unreasonable jealousies that there is a purpose to make you soe; and since his Majesty hath too much reason to suspect that Mr. En∣decott,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Endecott died before the next election.</NOTE> who hath during all the late revolutions continued the government there, is not a person well affected to his Majesties person or his government, his Majestie will take it very well if at the next election any other person of good reputation be chosen in the place, and that he may noe longer exercise that charge. This is all I have to signify unto you from his Majestie and remaine</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honorable Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LET my first salutation be my congratulation for this addition of a further expression of Gods peoples affection and confidence in your courage, wisdom and faithfulnes for the interest of our Lord Jesus and the good and wellfare of church and commonwealth, in that they have unanimously called you to be one of the assistants for governing the civill affaires in the court, as well as to be their major generall in the campe. The good Lord assist and governe you by his spirit of wisdom, of courage, and of the feare of the Lord in both.</P>
<P>Sir, I received yours dated 27. 3d. 65. for which I returne humble and hearty thanks, and for the inclosed narrative, whereby I perceive that the powers of darknes which have prevailed in other parts of the world are at worke here also, to subvert the kingdom of Christ in these ends of the earth. But God hath not yet said that this is theire hour in reference to N. E. though our unthank∣fulnes for the gospel, unfruitfulness under it, dissobedience
<PB N="393" REF="011300_0199_0F86CB6C51A8E3A8"/>
to it, declensions from the simplicity that is in Christ, and sinful compliances, &amp;c. have deserved that our hedge should be broken down. That admonition which Christ sent unto the church at Ephesus should sound in our hearts continually, Repent and doe thy first workes. For even David had his first and his latter wayes. Therefore it is noticed concerning Jehosaphat, in 2 Chron. 17.3. that the Lord was with him, because he walked in the first waies of his father David. If N. E. would returne to the first waies of reformation here begun, according to gospel rules and patternes (from which the compas of the last synods conclusions seemes to be varied by some degrees towards the antartique, or is newly discovered to be other than I formerly apprehended to have been the way of these churches) I would hope that the same onely wise God who dissappointed the councel of that archprelate in the raigne of the last king (whereby your pattent was once and againe demanded by the said king, and as often refused by your generall court, to be returned to England) would also still appeare, in this juncture, by frustrating the present designe and making it an abortion, or a mere tryall of the country, whether they will stand to their church rights and privi∣ledges or permit them to be invaded and violated by such attempts, which when they are tried and found unsuccess∣ful, will cease for the future. For the Lord is and will be with his people while they are with him; and if yee seeke him he will be found of you. An experiment here∣of you had in the quiet proceeding of your elections, as a gracious answer to prayers. Their claiming power to sit authoritatively as a court for appeales, and that to be ma∣naged in an arbitrary way, was a manifest laying of a ground worke to undermine your whole government established by your charter. If you had consented thereunto, you had plucked downe with your owne hands that house which wisdom had built for you and your posterity. For all your courts would then have signified nothing; the sentences of them being liable to be dissannulled, upon complaints to the commissioners made by delinquents, as
<PB N="394" REF="011300_0200_0F86CB6E70689018"/>
appeareth in the case of Mr. Tho. Deane, &amp;c. and the ex∣ecution of the justest censure might be hindred and the course of justice obstructed, as you have alreadie found in the case of John Potter. Nor can I see that your pre∣serving that authority and jurisdiction which the last king, by his roial charter, gave you, can rationally be accounted an opposing the soveraignety which this king hath over you, seeing <HI>id possunt reges quod jure possunt.</HI> There is indeed a verbal profession of preserving your liberties. But if the commission of these gentlemen be of such a latitude as they say, it is a real destruction of that which they promise to preserve. <HI>Quid verba audiam, cum facta videam?</HI> Therefore, to me, the matter of your answer seemes to be rational, just and necessary. As for the solem∣nity of publishing it, in three places, by sounding a trum∣pet, I believe you did it upon good advise, and therefore, suspending my own thoughts, I shall wait to see how it is resented at the court in England. Yet, upon serious second and third thoughts, I see not but that it was your prudent way so to do, considering that, 1. It was the answer of the generall court. 2. Published in the kings name. 3. For the cognisance of the whole country concerned in it. 4. For declaring the courage and resolution of the whole countrey to defend theire charter liberties and priviledges, and not to yeeld up theire right voluntarily, so long as they can hold it, in dependance upon God in Christ, whose interest is in it, for his protection and blessing, who will be with you while you are with him. If my advise were worth any thing, I would say, let a collection of your grievances occasioned by the coming over of these com∣missioners, and by their actings, in one place and another, and of the 3 commissioners in prejudicing the Indians against the English, whereby the good worke for theire conversion is in danger to be hindered and the safety and peace of the English to be hazzarded, for the future; let, I say, all instances of theire illegal and injurious proceed∣ings, throughout the countrey, be fully collected and clearly proved, and speedily transmitted and represented to the
<PB N="395" REF="011300_0200_0F86CB6E70689018"/>
king, the lord chancellor, &amp;c. by your next addres, and therein let them fully and plainly understand that the whole countrey (for the generality of them) are much ag∣grieved at these doings and humbly desire to be resettled in theire former state, according to theire charter, and that they may be freed from those new encroachments; wherein the petition to the generall court presented in the names of so many non-freemen, declaring theire full satis∣faction in the settled government, as it is, with theire ear∣nest desire that it may be still continued without alteration, may be signified to the higher powers, to good purpose. Sir, You see whether my zeale for preserving Christs in∣terest in your parts (though in N.H.C.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">New Haven Colony.</NOTE> it is miserably lost) and my unfeigned love to your colonie and my fervent desire of the wellfare of the churches and commonwealth (so far as they may be promoted and perpetuated by your circumspection) hath carried me, through my confidence in your wisdom and faithfulnes, that you will make no other use of this my scribbling then such as shall be safe both to you and me. To the honorable governor you may com∣municate it, if you please, presenting also to him my hum∣ble and affectionate service.</P>
<P>Sir, I returne your copie of the articles that concerne Commameene, having received them formerly from your selfe, and lately from Mr. Bishop, with many thanks to you for the sight and loan of them from us both. But I am and shall be discouraged from regarding such agree∣ment made by a subject, though honourably, til I see your charter, sealed by the late King, and obliging his heirs and successors, really as well as verbally confirmed and per∣formed, towards the purchasing whereof I paid 50<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> and Mr. Eaton 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> and sundry other merchants the same sums respectively, we being members of the London cor∣poration for N. E. which doth ingage me to desire and en∣deavour, what I can and may, that the intended effects thereof may remaine, for the service of Christ and for the good of all his people, both at present and for the future. I heare well of your last address to the king. I should take
<PB N="396" REF="011300_0201_0F86CB6F31B34828"/>
it for a favour if I might peruse it and the king's answer. I shall now cease from giving you any further trouble, but not from praying for a good issue of your and our present afflictive exercises, and not ours only but of the distressed churches of Christ, in whom I rest,</P>

<P>IT doth not a little grieve my spirit to heare what sadd things are reported dayly of your tyranny and perse∣cutions in New-England, as that you fyne, whip and im∣prison men for their consciences. First, you compell such to come into your assemblyes as you know will not joyne with you in your worship, and when they shew their dis∣like thereof or witnes against, then you styrre up your magistrates to punish them for such (as you conceyve) their publicke affronts. Truely, friends, this your practice of compelling any in matters of worship to doe that whereof they are not fully persuaded, is to make them sin, for soe the apostle (Rom. 14 and 23.) tells us, and many are made hypocrites thereby, conforming in their outward man for feare of punishment. We pray for you and wish you pros∣peritie every way, hoped the Lord would have given you so much light and love there, that you might have been eyes to God's people here, and not to practice those courses in a wildernes, which you went so farre to prevent. These rigid wayes have layed you very lowe in the hearts of the

saynts. I doe assure you I have heard them pray in the publique assemblies that the Lord would give you meeke and humble spirits, not to stryve soe much for uniformity as to keepe the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.</P>
<P>When I was in Holland about the beginning of our warres, I remember some christians there that then had serious thoughts of planting in New-England, desired me to write to the governor thereof to know if those that dif∣fer from you in opinion, yet houlding the same foundation in religion, as Anabaptists, Seekers, Antinomians, and the like, might be permitted to live among you, to which I received this short answer from your then governour Mr. Dudley, God forbid (said he) our love for the truth should be growne soe could that we should tolerate errours, and when (for satisfaction of myself and others) I desired to know your grounds, he referred me to the books writ∣ten here between the Presbyterians and Independents, which if that had been sufficient, I needed not have sent soe farre to understand the reasons of your practice, I hope you doe not assume to yourselves infallibilitie of judgment, when the most learned of the Apostles confesseth he knew but in parte and sawe but darkely as through a glass, for God is light, and no further than he doth illuminate us can we see, be our partes and learning never soe great. Oh that all those who are brethren, though yet they can∣not thinke and speake the same things might be of one accord in the Lord.

For when the complaints you hear of are against our tyranny and persecutions in fining, whip∣ping and imprisoning men for their consciences, be pleased to understand wee looke at such complaints as altogether injurious in respect of ourselves, who had noe hand or tongue at all to promote either the coming of the persons you ayme at into our assemblyes, or their punishment for their carriage there. Righteous judgment will not take up reports, much lesse reproaches, against the innocent. The cry of the sinnes of Sodome was great and loude, and reached up to heaven; yet the righteous God (giving us an example what to doe in the like case) he would first goe downe to see whether their crime were altogether according to the cry, before he would proceede to judge∣ment, Gen. 18.20, 21. and when he did finde the truth of the cry, he did not wrap up all alike promiscuously in the judgement, but spared such as he found innocent; wee are amongst those whom (if you knew us better) you would account of (as the matron of Abel spake of herselfe) peaceable in Israel, 2 Sam. 20.19. Yet neither are wee so vast in our indulgence or toleration as to thinke the men
<PB N="404" REF="011300_0205_0F86CB79A18C12E0"/>
you speake of suffered an unjust censure. For one of them (Obadiah Holmes) being an excommunicate person himselfe, out of a church in Plymouth patent, came into this jurisdiction and took upon him to baptize, which I thinke himselfe will not say he was compelled here to per∣forme. And he was not ignorant that the rebaptizing of an elder person, and that by a private person our of office and under excommunication, are all of them manifest con∣testations against the order and government of our churches established (wee know) by Gods law, and (he knoweth) by the lawes of the country. And wee conceive wee may safely appeale to the ingenuity of your owne judgement, whether it would be tolerated in any civill state, for a stranger to come and practise contrary to the knowne principles of their church-estate? As for his whipping, it was more voluntarily chosen by him than inflicted on him. His censure by the court was to have payed (as I know) 30 pounds or else to be whipt, his fine was offered to be payed by friends for him freely; but he chose rather to be whipt; in which case, if his suffering of stripes was any worship of God at all, surely it could be accounted no better than will-worship. The other (Mr. Clarke) was wiser in that point and his offence was lesse, so was his fine lesse, and himselfe (as I heare) was contented to have it payed for him, whereupon he was released. The impri∣sonment of either of them was noe detriment. I believe they sared neither of them better at home, and I am sure Holmes had not been so well clad of many yeares before.</P>
<P>But be pleased to consider this point a little further. You thinke to compell men in matter of worship is to make men sinne, according to Rom. 14.23. If the worship be lawfull in itselfe, the magistrate compelling him to come to it compelleth him not to sinne, but the sinne is in his will that needs to be compelled to a christian duty. Josiah compelled all Israel, or (which is all one) made to serve the Lord their God, 2 Chron. 34.33. yet his act herein was not blamed but recorded amongst his virtuous actions. For a governour to suffer any within his gates to prophane
<PB N="405" REF="011300_0205_0F86CB79A18C12E0"/>
the sabbath, is a sinne against the 4th commandment, both in the private householder and in the magistrate; and if he requires them to present themselves before the Lord, the magistrate sinneth not, nor doth the subject sinne so great a sinne as if he did refraine to come. If the magi∣strate connive at his absenting himselfe from sabbath duties the sinne will be greater in the magistrate than can be in the others passive comeing. Naamans passive goeing into the house of Rimmon did not violate the peace of his con∣science, 2 Kings 5.18 19. Bodily presence in a stewes, forced to behold the leudnesse of whoredomes there com∣mitted, is noe whoredome at all. Noe more is it spirituall whoredome to be compelled by force to goe to masse.</P>
<P>But (say you) it doth but make men hypocrites, to com∣pell men to conforme the outward man for feare of pu∣nishment. If it did so, yet better to be hypocrites than prophane persons. Hypocrites give God part of his due, the outward man, but the prophane person giveth God neither outward nor inward man.</P>
<P>Your prayers for us wee thankfully accept, and wee hope God hath given us so much light and love (which you thinke wee want) that if our native country were more zealous against horrid blasphemies and heresies than wee be, wee believe the Lord would looke at it as a better improvement of all the great salvations he hath wrought for them than to sett open a wide doore to all abominations in religion. Doe you thinke the Lord hath crowned the state with so many victoryes that they should suffer so many miscreants to pluck the crown of soveraign∣ty from Christs head? Some to deny his godhead, some his manhood; some to acknowledge noe Christ, nor hea∣ven, nor hell, but what is in a mans selfe? Some to deny all churches and ordinances, and so to leave Christ noe vi∣sible kingdome upon earth? And thus Christ by easing England of the yoke of a kingdome shall forfeit his owne kingdome among the people of England. Now God forbid, God from heaven forbid, that the people and state of England should so ill requite the Lord Jesus. You
<PB N="406" REF="011300_0206_0F86CB7C2E3BC120"/>
know not, if you thinke wee came into this wildernesse to practise those courses here which wee fled from in Eng∣land. Wee believe there is a vast difference betweene mens inventions and God's institutions; wee fled from mens inventions, to which wee else should have beene compelled; wee compell none to mens inventions.</P>
<P>If our wayes (rigid wayes as you call them) have layd us low in the hearts of God's people, yea and of the saints (as you stile them) wee doe not believe it is any part of their saintship. Michal had a low esteeme of Davids zeale, but he was never a whit lower in the sight of God, nor she higher.</P>
<P>What you wrote out of Holland to our then governor Mr. Dudley, in behalfe of Anabaptists, Antinomians, Seekers, and the like, it seemeth, mett with a short answer from him but zealous; for zeal will not beare such mixtures as coldnesse or lukewarmenesse will, Revel. 2.2.14.15.20. Neverthelesse, I tell you the truth, wee have tolerated in our church some Anabaptists, some Antinomians, and some Seekers, and do so still at this day; though Seekers of all others have least reason to desire toleration in church fellowship. For they that deny all churches and church ordinances since the apostacy of Antichrist, they cannot continue in church fellowship but against their owne judgment and conscience; and therefore 4 or 5 of them who openly renounced the church fellowship which they had long enjoyed, the church said amen to their act, and (after serious debate with them till they had nothing to answer) they were removed from their fellowship. Others carry their dissent more privately and inoffensively, and so are borne withall in much meekenesse. Wee are farr from arrogating infallibility of judgement to ourselves or affect∣ing uniformity; uniformity God never required, infallibi∣lity he never granted us. Wee content ourselves with unity in the foundation of religion and of church order: Super∣structures wee suffer to varie; wee have here presbyterian churches as well as congregationall, and have learned (through grace) to keepe the unity of the spirit in the bond
<PB N="407" REF="011300_0206_0F86CB7C2E3BC120"/>
of peace; onely wee are loth to be blowne up and downe (like chaff) by every winde of new notions.</P>
<P>You see how desirous wee are to give you what satis∣faction wee may to your loveing expostulation, which wee pray you to accept with the same spirit of love wherewith it is endited. The Lord Jesus guide and keepe your heart for ever in the wayes of his trueth and peace. So humbly commending our due respect and hearty affection to your worship, wee take leave and rest.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This and the next preceding Letter are without date.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE lately heard that his Majesty hath authorized and required you to reduce Canada to his Majesty's obedience, therefore I thinke it my duty (for several res∣pects) to give you advertisement of an opportunity which presents it selfe towards the facilitating (if not wholly ef∣fecting) the worke at once. For I have received letters yesterday that the French were marching (in number ac∣cording to Indyans computation about 700 men) towards Albany. I presume they will not openly professe them∣selves enemyes to us, till they have either vanquisht the Mohaukes, or made peace with them; however I have strengthened my garrison in the fort to withstand their attempts; hereof I have also sent governor Winthrop an account, and cannot imagine any reason to the contrary why so faire an advantage against the French should bee let slip, since his Majesty's directions therein are so possitive. And truly if from your colony a speedy force of horse and dragoones, not exceeding 150, would march and joyne with a proportionable number of Conecticott colony, in all probability few of the French could return to Canada, whose whole strength is now so farr engaged from home,
<PB N="408" REF="011300_0207_0F86CB7CCB0F9AA0"/>
and by consequence the rest of the French will not be able to make any considerable resistance; the necessity of your speedy determination is so evident, that I shall not make use of other arguments, only assuring you of my utmost endeavours to serve his Majesty upon this occasion in the defence of his dominions, not doubting but that the com∣mon safety is precious to you, although the danger at pre∣sent more immediately threatens this colony; I remitt the consideration of the premisses to your serious thoughts, and remaine your very affectionate friend and servant,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALthough wee were credibly informed before your generall court sate in September last, and by di∣vers circumstances were jealous that the signification of his Majesties pleasure to yourselves, under his Majesties signe manuall and subscribed by Sir William Morice, prin∣cipall secretary of state, would not meet with a full com∣plyance in your generall court; yet wee were loth to credit reports so derogatory to your dutifull submission to his Majesties commandes; and having seene the copy of an humble addresse to your generall court, under the hands of many considerable persons eminent for loyalty and estates within your jurisdiction, wherein the petitioners did, with a modest importunity, offer to their representa∣tives their deep sense of the calamities which may ensue, if his Majesties just displeasure should be kindled against the disobedient, wee were full of hopes that the generall court would have given his Majestie due satisfaction to his commands, and particular thankes to those gentlemen the petitioners: But being fully informed that your resolu∣tions are neither to send Mr. Richard Bellingham, your

present governor, with Major Hawthorne, who are expresly required upon their allegiance to attend his Majestie, nor to make your choice of two or three other persons, as his Majesty is pleased to direct you; and further, that you have not only discountenanced but laid heavy charges against those loyall and dutifull petitioners, wee conceive ourselves, at last, highly obliged (as commissioners from his Majestie) solemnly to manifest declare and protest, in the name and behalfe of his Majestie.</P>
<P N="1">1. First, That his Majesties signification of his pleasure to his colony of the Massachusets is an originall signed by his Majestie, subsigned by Sir William Morice principall secretary of state,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix to Massa. Hist. Vol. I. p. 547.</NOTE> which ought to be received for authen∣tick in all his Majesties dominions, and is so entertained in all the other his Majesties colonies in New-England, to their joy and satisfaction, though with some blot upon record in your scutcheon.</P>
<P N="2">2. Secondly, That his Majestie will be justly displeased with your resolutions against sending the persons nomi∣nated in the signification, with such others as you are posi∣tively commanded to make your owne choice of, to attend his Majestie, who expects from all his subjects obedience, as much more acceptable than sacrifice.</P>
<P N="3">3. Thirdly, That his Majesty cannot but approve of that humble petition presented to your generall court, and by the lawes of England (which must be the touch-stone) those gentlemen ought not to be molested, fined, or impri∣soned for any matters contained in the said petition, so full of duty to his Majestie, of respect to your generall court, and tending to the peace and welfare of the whole colony.</P>
<P N="4">4. Lastly, Wee ourselves, fully concurring with the substance and to those good ends manifested in the petition, doe earnestly sollicit you to resume the whole matter into your most serious consideration, that his Majestie may bee honoured with the reall obedience of his subjects, and thereby encouraged plentifully to pour forth the riches of his goodnes upon his colony of the Massachusets, to which we are hearty well wishers and will contribute our best

<HEAD>Copy of a Narrative of the Commissioners from England, about New-England.</HEAD>
<P>THE colony of Conecticote returned their humble thankes to his Majesty for his gracious letters and for sending commissioners to them, and made great pro∣mises of their loyalty and obedience. And they did sub∣mit to have appeales made to his Majesties commissioners, who did hear and determine some differences among them. All formes of justice passe only in his Majestyes name, they admit all that desire it to be of their corporation; they will not hinder any from enjoying the sacraments and using the common prayer book, provided that they hinder not the maintenance of the publick minister; they will amend any thing that hath been done derogatory to his Majestyes honour, if there be any such thing, so soone as they shall come to the knowledge of it. The bounds betwixt the Dukes province and Conecticote were mistaken by wrong information, for it was not intended that they should come nearer to Hudson's river then twenty miles, yet the line was set downe by the commissioners to goe from such a poynt N. N. W. whereas it ought to goe
<PB N="413" REF="011300_0209_0F86CB7E47D84D00"/>
just N. otherwise the line will goe into Hudsons river. They have nothing to say against Duke Hamiltons pat∣tent, but their writings were burnt, and that they bought the land of the Lord Say and Brook and others, and that his Majesty hath confirmed it to them, and that they never knew that the late Marquis Hamilton had a graunt of it, for he never sent any to take possession of it or to inhabit upon it. Their eastern bounds are determined to be a line drawn westward from the midst of the road Pawtucket river, neere to Shaws house. Their northern bounds is the south line of the Massachusets, which, as the collony complaines, is stretched much too southerly. This colony hath many good rivers and harbours, many scattering towns not worthy of their names, and a scoller to their minister in every town or village, but noe places fortified except Seabrook fort, which is much gone to decay, and here, for the most part, they are rigid presbyterians.</P>
<P>The colony of Road Island and Providence plantations returned their humble thankes to his Majesty for sending commissioners and made great demonstration of their loy∣alty and obedience. They approved, as most reasonable, that appeals should be made to his Majestyes commissioners, who having heard and determined some causes among them, referred other some, in civility, to their generall court, and some to the governor and others; some of which causes they again remitted to the commissioners to be de∣termined. All proceedings are in his Majestyes name, they admit all to be freemen that desire it; they allow liberty of conscience and worship to all who live civilly, and if any can inform them of any thing in their lawes or practi∣ses derogatory to his Majestyes honour, they will amend it. The Marquis of Hamiltons pattent takes in all Road Island colony and about half of Conecticote. The Narhiganset Sachims did in the year 1664, by writing, surrender them∣selves, their people and country, into the late Kings pro∣tection; two of which Sachims, now living, did actually, in their own persons, surrender themselves, people and coun∣try, into his royall Majestyes protection before his com∣missioners,
<PB N="414" REF="011300_0210_0F86CB7F18561E28"/>
and deliverd to them them that very deed made in 1664, which had been carefully kept by Mr. Gorton, &amp;c. whereupon the commissioners, according to their instruc∣tions, entred upon the country in his Majestyes name and have named it the Kings province, have taken the na∣tives into his Majestyes protection, and have appoynted justices of the peace to govern it untill his Majestyes plea∣sure be farther known. For this Narhyganset country is allmost all the land belonging to the country, the which cannot subsist without it, and therefore the commissioners ordered that the magistrates for the colony should be justi∣ces of the peace for the Kings province, that noe difference may arise betwixt the officers. The Sachims did thank∣fully receive the two coates presented to them in his Ma∣jestyes name. In acknowledgment of their subjection they are to pay yearly, upon the 26th of May, two wolf skins to his Majesty, and did now send two caps of peague and two clubs inlayed with peague for a present to the King, and a feather mantle and a porcupine bag for a present to the Queen, which ware all taken by the Dutch. One of these princes, named Passicus, desired the commissioner to pray King Charles that noe strong liquor might be brought into that country, for he had 32 men that died by drink∣ing of it. These Indian princes gave a long petition to the commissioners, complaining of many acts of violence and injustice which the Massachusets had done to them: Among others, they first caused them to be fined, then tooke their whole country in mortgage (according to the remonstrance sent to his Majesty) and would have juggled them out of it; but there could be noe redresse, the Massa∣chusets refusing to let the commissioners have the hearing of appeals. Their western bounds are determined with Conecticote, their northern bounds must be the Massachu∣sets southern line, wherever it falls (which they complain to be too southerly) their eastern bounds betwixt them and New Plymouth could not be determined by consent of both parties (Road Island claiming a shred of land 3 miles broad all the length of the maine land lying next to
<PB N="415" REF="011300_0210_0F86CB7F18561E28"/>
the Narhyganset island, which they of New Plymouth could not part with without great prejudice) whereupon commissioners appoynted the water (the naturall bounds of each colony) to be their present bounds, untill his Ma∣jestves pleasure be farther known. Mr. William Brenton, deputy governor of Road Island, having bought a farm upon that shred of land which he hoped would belong to that colony, humbly desires his Majesty that he may continue to possesse that farme though it falls within the line of New Plymouth, and Doctor Alcock, a physician, having bought Block Island for 400<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> of some of Boston, who took upon them power (never graunted them) to sell it, and having been at great charges in planting of it, desires his Majesty that he may not be dispossessed of it, he humbly submitting to the government of Road Island; both these petitions to his Majesty are lost. This colony, which ad∣mits of all religions, even Quakers and Gennerallists, was begun by such as the Massachusets would not suffer to live among them and is generally hated by the other colonyes, who endeavoured severall wayes to suppresse them; they maintained several other Indians against the Narhyganset Indians. The commissioners of the united colonyes dis∣posed of a great part of this country, pretending they had conquered it from the Pequod Indians, but evidence being made that the Narhygansets had conquered it before the English began their war, and that the right was in him who had sold it to the Road Islanders, and his Majestyes commissioners not thinking it justifiable for any colony to dispose of land without their own lymits, determined it for the Road Islanders. The Massachusets did maintain Pumham (a petty Sachim in this province) twenty years against this colony and his chief Sachim, and did, by armed soldiers, besiedge and take prisoners Mr. Gorton, Howden, Weeks, Green and others in this province, and carryed them to Boston, put them in chains, and took eighty head of cattle from them, for all which they could never yet get satisfaction. This colony could never be acknowledged for a colony till his Majesty's
<PB N="416" REF="011300_0211_0F86CB7FC17D6C88"/>
charter was published, though in the year 1643 they sent over some into England to procure the King's charter then, but finding that unnaturall war begun, and the King gone from London, they took a charter from the lords and commons, which was more then Newhaven did pretend to, and more then Conecticot could shew, yet these two were admitted colonys in their great combination, and Road Island slighted. The Narhyganset bay is the largest and safest port in New-England nearest the sea and fittest for trade; this colony hath two scattered towns upon Road Island, two upon the maine land, and four small villages; here only yet is lime stone found, and here only the gover∣nour and magistrates serve the publick at their own charge. In this colony is the greatest number of Indians, yet they had never any thing allowed towards the civillizing and converting the Indians, and in this colony they have the greatest playnes, but noe place of strength fortified, altho' many places capable of fortification. In this province is the best English grasse and most sheep, the ground very fruitfull, ewes bringing ordinarily two lambs, corn yields eighty for one, and in some places they have had corn twenty six years together without manuring. In this pro∣vince only they have not any places sett apart for the wor∣ship of God, there being soe many subdivided sects they cannot agree to meet together in one place, but according to their several judgments they sometimes associate in one house sometimes in another.</P>
<P>The colony of New-Plymouth did submit to have ap∣peals made to the commissioners, who here had but one plaint to them, which was, that the governour would not let a man enjoy a farm of four miles square which he had bought of an Indian, the complaint soone submitted to the governor when he understood the unreasonablenes by it. They are here constrained to perswade men, sometimes to compell there, to be free men, soe far are they from hinder∣ing any. This colony is seated on a neck of land the baranest part of the country. They were the first plan∣ters in New-England, though the Massachusetts got the
<PB N="417" REF="011300_0211_0F86CB7FC17D6C88"/>
first charter, and since hath much streightned this colony by stretching their line so much southerly. They shewed their charter and gave a copy of it to their commissioners, and told them they were so poore they could not renew it; whereupon the commissioners took occasion to offer to get their charter renewed and delivered to them at the com∣missioners own charge, if, for a further demonstration of their loyalty, they would let his Majesty choose one of three (whose names themselves should send to the King) to be their governor, and this to be done every 3 yeare, or every 5 years, which they thought best. The com∣missioners thought if this had succeeded in this the first colony they had visitted it might have been a good exam∣ple for the rest; but after the generall assembly had con∣sidered of it, with many thankes to the commissioners and great protestations of their loyalty to the King, they chose to be as they were. They have about twelve small towns, one saw mill for boards, one bloomary for iron, neither good river nor good harbour, nor any place of strength; they are soe poore, they are not able to maintain scollers to their ministers, but are necessitated to make use of a guifted brother in some places.</P>
<P>The collony of the Massachusetts was the last and hardliest perswaded to use his Majestyes name in the forms of justice. In this collony, at the first coming over of the commissioners, were many untruths raised and sent into the collonyes, as that the King had sent to raise 5000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> yearly for his Majestyes use, whereupon Major Hawthorne made a seditious speech at the head of his company, and the late Governor another at their meeting house in Boston, but neither of them were soe much as questioned for it by any of their magistrates. The commissioners visitted all other collonyes before this, hoping both that the submission and condescention of the other collonyes to his Majestyes de∣sires would have abated the refractorinesse of this collony, which they much feared, and that the assistance of Colonel Nicholls (whome they expected) would have prevailed much: But neither examples nor reasons could prevaile

with them to let the commissioners hear and determine soe much as those particular cases (Mr. Deanes and the Indian Sachims) which the King had commanded them to take care of and doe justice in: And though the commissioners, who never desired they should appear as delinquents but as defendents, either by themselves or by their attorneys, assured them that if they had been unjustly complained of to his Majesty, their false accusers should be severely pu∣nished, and their just dealing made known to his Majesty and all the world, yet they proclaimed by sound of trum∣pet that the generall court was the supreamest judicatory in all that province, that the commissioners pretending to hear appeals was a breach of their priviledges graunted them by the Kings royall father and confirmed to them by his Majestyes own letter, and that they should not per∣mitt it; by which they have for the present silenced above 30 petitions which desired justice against them, and were all lost at sea. To elude his Majestyes desire of their ad∣mitting men civill and of competent estates to be freemen, they have made an act, whereby he that is 24 years old, a housekeeper, and brings a certificate of his civill life, ano∣ther of his being orthodox in matters of faith, and a third of his paying ten shillings, beside head money, at a single rate, may then have liberty to make his desires known to the court, and then it shall be put to vote. The com∣missioners examined many townships, and found that scarce three in a hundred pay ten shillings at a single rate; yet, if this rate were generall it would be just; but he that is a church member, though he be a servant and pay not two pence, may be a freeman: They will not admitt any who is not a member of their church to communion, nor their children to baptisme, yet they will marry their children to those whome they will not admitt to baptisme, if they be rich: They did imprison and barbarously use Mr. Jour∣dan for baptizing children, as himself complained in his petition to the commissioners. Those whom they will not admitt to the communion they compell to come to their sermons, by forcing from them five shillings for every
<PB N="419" REF="011300_0212_0F86CB8082050378"/>
neglect; yet these men thought their paying one shilling for not coming to prayers in England was an unsupport∣able tyranny: They have put many Quakers to death, of other provinces, for which also they are petitioned against; first they banished them, as Quakers, upon payn of death, and then executed them for returning: They have beate some to jelly, and have been otherwayes exceeding cruell to others, and they say the king allows it in his letters to them; indeed they have misconstrued all the king's letters to their own sence. They yet pray constantly for their persecuted brethren in England. They have many things in their laws derogatory to his Majesty's honnor, of which the commissioners made a breviate and desired that they might be altered, but they have yet done nothing in it; among others, whoever keeps Christ∣mas day is to pay five pounds. They caused at length a mapp of their territoryes to be made, but it was made in a chamber by direction and guesse: in it they claim fort Albany, and beyond it all the land to the south sea. By their south sea line they intrench upon the colonys of New Plymouth, Road Island and Conecticote; and in the east they have usurped Capt. Masons and Sir Ferdinando Gorges pattents; and said that the commissioners had no∣thing to doe betwixt them and Mr. Gorges, because his Majesty neither commanded them to deliver possession to Mr. Gorges, or to give his Majesty reason why they did not. The commissioners being at Perscataqua when they received his Majestyes letter which commanded them to see the harbours fortified, &amp;c. sent their warrants to four towns upon that river, requiring them to meet at such a time and place to hear his Majestyes letter read, one of these warrants was sent post to Boston, from whence two marshalls are sent from the governor and counsell with an∣other warrant to forbid the towns either to meet or doe any thing commanded them by the commissioners, at their utmost perills; and withall sent an unbeseeming letter to the commissioners, both which letter and warrant were lost at sea. Col. Whaley and Gough were entertained by the magistrates with great solemnity and feasted in every place,
<PB N="420" REF="011300_0213_0F86CB8140B63488"/>
after they were told they were traytors and ought to be apprehended; they made their abode at Cambridge untill they were furnished with horses and a guide and sent away to Newhaven; for their more security, Capt. Daniell Gookin is reported to have brought over and to manage their estates; and the commissioners being informed that he had many cattle at his farm in the Kings province which were supposed to be Whalyes or Goughs, caused them to be seazed for his Majestyes use, till further order, but Capt. Gookin, standing upon the priviledge of their charter and refusing to answer before the commissioners, as soe, there was noe more done in it; Capt. Peirce who transpor∣ted Whaly and Gough into New England may probably say something to their estate. They of this colony say that King Charles the first gave them power to make laws and to execute them, and graunted them a charter as a warrant against himself and his successors, and that so long as they pay the fifth part of all gold and silver oare which they shall gett they shall be free to use the privileges graunted them, and that they are not obliged to the King but by civillity; they hope by writing to tire the King, Lord Chancellor and Secretaryes too; seaven years they can easily spin out by writing, and before that time a change may come, nay, some have dared to say, who knows what the event of this Dutch war will be? This colony furnish∣ed Cromwell with many instruments out of their corpo∣ration and their collidg, and those that have retreated thether since his Majesty's happy return are much res∣pected, and many advanced to be magistrates. They did solicit Cromwell, by one Mr. Winslow, to be declared a free state, and many times in their lawes stiling themselves this state, this common wealth, and now beleve themselves to be soe. They demand what taxes they please, but their accounts could never yet be seen. Some few soldiers they keep at their castle; their governor hath 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> yearly, every magistrate 30<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> They convert Indians by hiring them to come and hear sermons, by teaching them not to obey their heathen Sachims, and by appoynting rulers
<PB N="421" REF="011300_0213_0F86CB8140B63488"/>
amongst them over tens, twentyes, fiftyes. The lives manners and actions of those whom they say are converted, cannot be distinguished from those who are not, except it be by being hired to hear sermons, which the more gene∣rous natives scorn. This colony, which hath ingrossed the whole trade of New-England and is therefore the richest, hath many townes, but not one regularly built within its just limitts, which the commissioners suppose to be Seconett brook on the S. W. and Merimack river on the N. E. and two right lines drawn from each of those two places, till they come within 20 miles of Hudson river, for that river is already planted and given to his royall highness. Boston is the chief town in it, and seated upon a penin∣sula in the bottom of a bay, which is a good harbour and full of fish. It was fortified this year 1665 with two block houses, they had, before, a castle upon an island in the roade where ships must passe, about 5 or 6 miles from the town. Their houses are generally wooden, their streets crooked, with little decency and noe uniformity and, there, neither months, dayes, seasons of the year, churches nor inns are known by their English names. At Cambridg they have a wooden collidg and, in the yard, a brick pile of two bayes for the Indians, where the com∣missioners saw but one; they said they had 3 or more at scooll. It may be feared this collidg may afford us many scismaticks to the church, and the corporation as many rebells to the king, as formerly they have done, if not timely prevented. In this colony too the king hath many loyall subjects, who petitioned this general court at his Majesty's first coming in, for the owning of his Majesty, and now lastly for complying with his Majesty's commis∣sioners, but have had neither answer nor good look since; they are sorry that soe few (for there are scarce above 8 of the most factious) should carry on soe strong a faction, yet they are so over-awed that they can doe nothing to remedy it. They only say it is now with them as it was with the king's party in Cromwell's time; one of those was derided for being soe civill to accompany one of the
<PB N="422" REF="011300_0214_0F86CB836DDBD670"/>
commissioners from the town where he lived to Boston, and others in Boston derided those of Road Island for hav∣ing yielded soe much to the commissioners. In Boston lyes 10 iron guns brought from the French fort taken in Cromwell's time, which would doe well at Pescataqua to defend the mouth of that river, where the masts are laden, if they be the king's. On the 10th of September 1664 they published by order of court a paper to deter and af∣frighten all from making any complaints to the commis∣sioners. The commodities of the country are fish, which is sent into France, Spain and the Streights, pipe staves, masts, firr boards, some pitch and tarr, pork, beef, horses, and corn, which they send to Virginia, Barbados, &amp;c. and take tobacko and sugar for payment, which they after send for England. There is good store of iron made in this province; their way of government is common wealth like; their way of worship is rude and called congregational, they are zealous in it, for they persecute all other formes.</P>
<P>New-Hampshire is the name of a province granted to Capt. Robert Mason about the year 1635, and was to be∣gin on the sea coast 3 miles E. of Merimack river, and reaches to Pescataqua, and 60 miles of that breadth up into the country; but now it is usurped by the Mas∣sachusetts who pretend that it is within their bounds, and that the people petitioned to be within their protection; it is true that difference of oppinion made a division among them, and a few who were for congregationall churches did petition for their assistance, by which occasion, partly by force and partly by composition, they have engrossed the whole and named it Norfolk. When the Massachu∣setts charter was first graunted, the mouths only of the two rivers, Charles and Merimack, were known to them, for they durst not travill far up into the country, presently after there was a house erected three large miles from Merimack, which was for 17 years called and known to be the bounds of the Massachusetts, and in that time was this pattent graunted to Capt. Mason. Mr. Wheelwright was banished out of the jurisdiction of Massachusetts and was
<PB N="423" REF="011300_0214_0F86CB836DDBD670"/>
permitted to inhabit immediately beyond the bound house, as himself gave testimony before the commissioners. Mr. Mason had a pattent for some land about Cape Ann before the Massachusetts had their first pattent, whereupon Capt. Mason, and Mr. Cradock, who was the first governor of the Massachusetts and lived in London, agreed that the Massachusetts should have that land which was graunted to Capt. Mason about Cape Ann, and Capt. Mason should have that land which was beyond Merimack river, and graunted to the Massachusetts. This agreement was sent to Mr. Henry Joslin to get recorded at Boston, but before he could have leasure to goe thither he heard that Capt. Mason was dead, and therefore went not, of this he made affidavit before the commissioners, who forbore to doe any thing about the limitts of this province till this might more fully be proved, though the generallity of the peo∣ple petitioned to be taken from under the tyranny of the Massachusetts, as themselves stiled it. The Massachusetts, since they have had the government of this land, have graunted and divided the province into several townships, which are very long and thin, three of which are seated upon Pescataqua river, which is a very good harbour and very capable of fortification; here are excellent masts got∣ten, and here dry docks might be made, and upon the river are above twenty saw mills, and here are great store of pipe staves made, and great store of good timber spoyled.</P>
<P>The province of Mayne begins at the E. side of Pesca∣taqua, and reacheth to Kennebeck river; it was named and graunted to Sir Ferdinando Gorges by king Charles the first, but was usurped also by the Massachusetts under pre∣tence that it was within the limitts of their charter, and that the people petitioned to be under their government, and they named it Yorkshire. One gentleman, who re∣fused to submitt to the Massachusetts and suffered great losse by them, shewed the commissioners a warrant the Massachusetts made to have him brought to Boston alive or dead, and now demands justice against them. This province upon petition of the inhabitants and the diffe∣rence
<PB N="424" REF="011300_0215_0F86CB842FD9DCD8"/>
betwixt Mr. Gorges commissioners and the Massa∣chusetts, his Majesty's commissioners took into his Majes∣ty's protection and government, and appoynted justices of the peace to govern them untill his Majesty's pleasure be farther known. The inhabitants afterwards petitioned his Majesty that they might allways continue under his Majesty's immediate government, and that Sir Rob. Carr might continue their governor under his Majesty, which petition was lost at sea: In this province allso lives an In∣dian Sachim, who lives neer to the great lake, from whence flowes Merimack river; petitioned his Majesty to take him into his protection, which was allso lost. In this province there are but few townes and those much scattered, as ge∣nerally they are throughout New-England; they are ra∣ther farmes than townes: But in this province there is a bay called Casco bay, in which are very many islands, two outletts to the sea, many good harbours and great store of fish and oysters, crabs and lobsters. In this province, as in all the rest there are great store of wild ducks, geese and deer in their seasons, strawberyes, rasberyes, goosberyes, barberyes, and severall sorts of billberyes, severall sorts of oaks and pines, chesnut trees, wallnut trees, sometimes for four of five miles together; the northerly the country the better the timber is accounted: On the N. E. of Kenibeck river, which is the bounds of the province of Mayn, upon Shipscot river and upon Pemaquid, 8 or 10 miles asunder, are 3 small plantations belonging to his royall highnesse, the biggest of which hath not above 30 houses in it, and those very mean ones too, and spread over 8 miles at least. Those people, for the most part, are fishermen and never had any government among them, most of them are such as have fled hether from other places to avoide justice. Some here are of opinion that as many men may share in a woman as they doe in a boat, and some have done soe. The commissioners, for necessity sake, have appoynted the best whom they could find, in each place, to be a justice of peace, and have ordered 3 of those justices of the peace in the province of Mayn, who live
<PB N="425" REF="011300_0215_0F86CB842FD9DCD8"/>
next to them, to joyn with them in holding of sessions, till further order be taken. In these parts are the best white oaks for ship timber. All the lands graunted to his royall highnesse in these north parts of New England, except these 3 plantations, are allso graunted to Sir Thomas Temple, in the pattent of Nova Scotia.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Narrative was undoubtedly the work of the Commissioners, or some Person employed by them.

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOURS of July 1667 wee received by the hand of Capt. Henry Addy, who through the blessing of God arrived here safe the 14th of this instant. Some few dayes before whose arrivall a letter from his Excellency the Lord Willoughby, your honourable father, intimating the seasonablenes of some present supply to be made from hence for the reliefe of his Majesties fleet with you, was received, and care taken speedily to provide and send such provisions as wee in our poor capacity are able, which pro∣visions are now putting on board the good ship called the Hopewell, whereof under God Capt. John Allen is com∣mander, and are appointed to be delivered to your hono∣rable father, to be disposed for the ends abovesaid, as his Excellency in his wisdome shall see meet. Wee do ac∣knowledge ourselves greatly obliged to his Excellency for his great favour and respects had for this his Majesties colony, the expressions whereof, cloathed with much love and candor, wee have sundry wayes good assurance that they are reall, and that his Lordship doth cordially seeke our peace, and should wee be wanting to a due acknow∣ledgment thereof, wee hope wee should be the first that

should blame ourselves for so great a neglect. In reffer∣rence to your motion for provisions for the supply of Capt. Addy, wee have endeavoured to answer your proposall and expectation therein, although by reason of Gods ha∣ving diminished our crops for sundry years past, by blast∣ing, &amp;c. especially our wheate, in conjunction with the present season of the yeare, when old store is spent, and new not being come in as yet, wee cannot in all respects accommodate him as were meete, yet according to our ca∣pacity wee have endeavoured the same, as himselfe, wee doubt not, will more particularly enforme. And wee shall be ready from time to time to encourage our merchants and traders in their exportation of provisions for your fur∣ther recrute to the uttermost of our power.</P>
<P>As to a supply of men from hence, your motion therein hath been also seriously weighed by us, and in sundry re∣spects it doth not appeare feaseable to be effected, so as may be to the answering of your expectation, nor yet with the safety of this his Majesties colony at this juncture.</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from Colonel Nicolls to the Governor and Assistants of the Massachusets, respecting the Province of Maine.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Was for some time past very unwilling to believe that you would reassume a power of government in the province of Mayne or Yorkeshire, the absolute decision whereof is lodged with his Majesty; and surely it will appeare an open breach of duty that any of his Majestyes inferiour courtes should usurpe a power over townes and persons after it hath pleased his Majesty to signifie his pleasure to yourselves, in these following words: "And for the better preventing of all differences and disputes upon the bounds and lymitts of the seaverall collonyes, his Ma∣jestyes pleasure is, that all determinations made by his Majestyes sayd commissioners with reference to the sayd bounds and lymitts may still continue and be observed till upon a full representation of all pretences his Majestye shall make his owne finall determination," &amp;c. Which very words you will finde in your owne letter from his Ma∣jesty, concluding thus: "And his Majesty expects that full obedience be given to this signification of his pleasure in all particulars. Given at the court at Whitehall, the 10th day of Aprill 1666, in the 18th year of his Majestyes raigne, by his Majestyes command, Wm. Morice." But I have now seene the order of your last generall court, in answer to the petition of some restlesse and unquiet spirits, wherein your resolution is already taken to send commissio∣ners to keepe a court and to exercise justice, &amp;c. as under your government. I know you have force enough to compell most of your neighbours to submitt to your go∣vernment; but if you thinke his Majestyes arme will ne∣ver be stretched forth to defend his subjects from usurpa∣tion, you may attempt any thinge under the notion of settling peace and order. I dare not be silent in a matter soe expressly contradictory to his Majestyes signification, dated 10th Aprill 1666,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix to Hist. Massa. Vol. I. p. 547.</NOTE> for though some of your greate
<PB N="428" REF="011300_0217_0F86CB85C115EC70"/>
people have spread a report that the said signification was never knowne to or owned by his Majestie, and probably for that reason the generall court was induced to issue forth the aforesaid order, yet you are to expect that his Majesty will owne his hand, and Sir William Morris will require sattisfaction for such scandalous aspersions upon him, being principall secretary of state. In short, you will finde that province allready settled by his Majestyes commissioners in peace and order, except some few turbulent spirits. You may read his Majestie hath made a temporary confirma∣tion thereof, why then are you soe hasty to enter upon a thinge of this nature, or how can you say that you have heard nothing since that might discourage or weaken your title to the said government? I am necessitated to write in these playne and large termes because the shortnesse of my tyme in these parts will not permit me to give you a visit, but will tell you my feares, that if you proceed to compell an alteration of government in the province of Mayne, by subverting there present establishment as it now stands cir∣cumstanced, in all likelyhood you may cause blood to be shed, for it is both naturall and lawfull for men to defend their fast rights against all invaders.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I shall send a coppie of this my letter with an originall of his Majesties aforesaid signification to those gentlemen of the said province, and there leave the deci∣sion betwixt God and yourselves; my hearty wishes and prayers shall be to the Allmighty that you may be endued with the spirit of obedience, charity, meekness and bro∣therly love, houlding yourselves within these bounds, you may be happie upon all the poynts of the compass, and I am sure noe man can wish you better than your affectionate humble servant,</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from several dissenting Ministers in and about London to the Magistrates and Ministers in Massachusets-Bay.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Worshipfull, Reverend and Beloved,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE received yours dated from Boston Aug. 21. 1671. directed to many of us, which also we have seve∣rall times considered, as the providence of God hath per∣mitted to us opportunities of meeting together. The im∣portance of the contents thereof, together with the honor and respect we owe you all, obligeth us to return you such answer as we are at present capable of, according to that disposall which it hath pleased the infinitely wise God to make of us in our stations, and also of the conditions which he hath measured out to his people amongst whom he hath placed us, from whom, as well as ourselves, you cannot expect (as things stand with us) to receive that fruit that either your need calls for or our love would produce, were we not ourselves, together with the churches of Christ in these nations, intangled in many straits, and thereby call'd to a more universall designment of what God hath graciously left his poor people to the supportation of the interest of his gospell and the ministers and professors thereof, whose daily relief depends, as to many counties, principally upon this citty, from whom also we must pro∣mise ourselves the greatest part if not all of that little we can hope to attain to, to expresse the value we have for the interest of our dear Lord Jesus amongst you, and more especially the promoting of the continuance of it in our assistence to the education of such as may by the blessing of his grace and spirit be usefull in their generation for the running and glorifying of his gospell in and by your numerous growing posterity.</P>
<P>As to the three branches of your letter, which com∣prize the whole of it, we doe according to the best of our judgments represent our thoughts to you which we hope will be acceptable to you, as you may find in it any labor of love towards you.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="011300_0218_0F86CB8DEB101410"/>First, We join with you in that humble thankfullnesse which is due to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he hath for so long a time planted and conti∣nued amongst you a school of the prophets, from whence have issued such instruments as God hath used for service to himself, even in both Englands, and heartily condole, that not only the dead stones, but also the living ones in that foundation are so much crumbled and diminished, and gladly would we contribute our helping hand to the repairing of the one and the reviving of the other, were our power suited to our wills. But upon consideration of the straits and troubles the ministers and churches of Christ are here wrestling with, and after consultation had with some wise and godly gentlemen, sincere lovers of you, we find in ourselves and them the concentring of the same thoughts, that the exhausted purses of those that are most able to contribute, cannot reach any summe considerable to∣wards the repair of the edifice, so many of God's servants here calling for daily relief, even of necessaries to them and their impoverished families, yet have we advised about sending you what assistance God shall enable us unto for the maintenance of Fellows and Tutors for the instruc∣tion and education of youths, who may be bred up in good literature and fear of the Lord, for future imploy∣ment in church and common-wealth, in which we can say there is a reall zeale for you and them in this great con∣cerne. Several wayes have been proposed and debated, we cannot yet acquaint you with any fully determinate meanes for effecting, yet this we were willing to advise you of, that you are in our hearts, and that we are fully purposed (if the present liberty we have to meet be not interrupted by those presaged hurryes which seeme to be in the womb of Providence coming upon us) to use all our indeavour to collect such summes of money (and so to dispose them by the best advice we can take) as may in time amount to some comfortable help towards the end which we specified before, in the service whereof we judge that which is most necessary for you (at least that we are capable of) may be attended.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="431" REF="011300_0218_0F86CB8DEB101410"/>2dly, As we desire to bless God with and for you, that so reverend and judicious a person as your president hath for so long a time been continued with you, and that so use∣fully, so it is a grief of heart to us that there appeares none amongst yourselves to succeed him in that employment, and more that we cannot find persons whose hearts God hath touched to goe over to you, in order to a supply of that expected losse which you mention; yet, if our advice herein be worth attending to, we would suggest, that it having pleased God to stirre up the heart of our beloved friend Dr. Hoar to intend a voyage towards you by this shipping, we do suppose a speaking providence in it, and doe judge that God hath so farr furnished him with the gifts of learning and the grace of his spirit, as that if your judgments concurre with ours and his inclinations (if God shall bring him to you) he may in some measure supply that want and help to make up this breach, and we shall hope and pray that it may be to some good fruit to you and yours.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, For what concerns our promoting the sending of youths over to you for their education, wee can say no more but this, that where we find any inclined so to dis∣pose of their children, we shall not be wanting to incou∣rage it as farre as we hear there shall be reason for it, by the Lords provision of such help amongst you as shall be continued yet unto you or further added by him in whose hands is the residue of the spirit, to be poured out on you and on your seed, according to his covenant. So commending you to the Lord and to the word of his grace we remaine</P>

I receved yours of the 6 of novem∣ber, I cared the inclosed and did as you desired, which I parseved was liked better then a lettar would have been from you; he hoped to send something but not yet, he told me you wantid nothing so far as he could un∣darstand, I wich you find it so, but the Lord is very gra∣shous to you and us in taking care, and tis a choyc marcy not to want that the Lord will not have us to inioy, tis the worke of the Lord to bring our minds to our condishon, but I find hope desired makes the heart sick, but the Lord is plesed to be the veshion in the applycation of som word or other, as that I will never leve thee nor forsake thee, I will be your God and the God of your sead, and throe marcy I have found it in some meshere maid good, for Frank is, I bles the Lord, receved into the chorch and gave great sattisfaxon to all that ware present, theare was eldars, deakons and som other of the membars that spake with her at forst and the whole church was sattisfid in her, and I hope the Lord who hath begon the worke will finnesh it to his glory and our comfort that she may help kepe up the name of the Lord in the world when we are laid in the dost. I found the inclosed, it being of her one writing, I have sent it to thee that we may reioyce and bles

the Lord together for so great a marcy; a porshon in him self is the best porshon for this cannot be lost, the Lord help us all to love him more and then the parting with earthly comforts will not be so grevous to us as it tis, deare Mrs. Jane hath sent some goods she being perswaded that it would be best this year, if the Lord plese to send them safe and that thay be well maneged for you and your freinds benefit. I trust the Lord will make it of some com∣fort to you, for my aunt toke great paines to send it before the war begon and we hope it is gon safe, we desire to fol∣low it with prayers. If you be good lads and will send word what you want theare will be care taken to soply you, but tell then I forbare to send because it is your desire. I bles the Lord I want nothing but thy deare company and thy friends. Give all the glory to God he is the giver of all our marceyes. It will not be long but I must be gon to those manshones that Christ hath prepared for me and all that love the Lord; theare will be no sorrow but fulnes of joy and pleshures for ever more; but if it may stand with the pleshure of my father I shold be glad to see thee and pease upon Isarell onse more, but I feare I am not worthy of such a marcy, but the Lord Jesus Christ is, for whose sake he will appeare in the best time. I have sent you the inclosed by which you may see that the pepell of God in∣joy much liberty at the present but what the eshue of it may be the Lord knows. The war with the Duch is like to be very terabel; the Lord ordar all things for his one glo∣ry; Christ is the head of the church and that may comfort us in the medst of all these commoshons. I bles the Lord I and your sistars and other friends are in health, only Betty is weakly, my ant takes great care of my brother as if he ware her one and is very kind to all the samely and to all that feare the Lord, for she makes it her buisnes to help the afflicted; many have cause to bles the Lord for her; doutles she will have a hye place in heaven; her good husband is much afflicted with the stone which makes him stratened in time that I fear he cannot write but prays dayly for you. Mrs Jane is much plesed when you write

Pray Child be carefull of yourself and friend and if you want a periweg to keep you warm let me know it and I will send you one; pray want for nothing that may be good for you, for my happynes is bound up in your well being. The going of the ships are very unsartain and therefore I know not whether I may write any more this yeare or not, but I shall not sese to pray for you and all the pepell of the Lord with you, especially for those that show kindnes to you to whom I desire to be remembred and returne hearty thanks for all thear great love; I hope the Lord will re∣quite them a thousand fould. If anny thing be don by us to your prejedish pray let me know it from yourselfe. Many friends desire to be remembred to you and prays dayly for you, all your sistars presents thear humbell duty and greatly longs to see you, my most indeared love to thyself and humbel duty to whom it belongs, I bles the Lord that theare is anny hopes of his recovery, the Lord profit the marcy and sanctifie all his dealings to us and let every mar∣cy and every afflixon that we mete with bring us nearer to himselfe and then we shall have no cause to complayn, my child this is like to be a very trobelsom sommar and therfore pray hard that the Lord wold appeare for his poore pepell and that the gospell may be upheld. Many nay allmost all that fear the Lord have apprehenshons that God is bringing som great stroke upon this nashon, the Lord devart his judgments if it be his will or however hide his pepell while these calametyes be over past, we have yet a breathing time, the Lord give hearts to improve it. The churches of Christ many of them ware in greate likly∣hoods to mete in the halls, having a grant from the com∣panyes, but at present theare is a demur on it, you may ges from home, but the Lord raineth let the earth re∣joyce, doutles this is a great blow to the bushops, but I shall be to troubelsom thoe I know not how to leve when

<HEAD>Copy of the Elders Advice to the General Court.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS it hath pleased this honnourable generall court assembled and setting in Boston the 15th of May 1672, to call us severall of the elders of the churches in this colonie, to consider, consult and advise concerning the present difficult emergencies before them, in order to the free, full and amicable concurrence of both houses in managing such cases of judicature as are represented unto this court, by petition or otherwise, according to law; wee thought incumbent on us as an indispensable duty, pressed under the sense of the great consequence of the question, it being to us a matter of the greatest importance, on the one hand, to say nothing that might in the least im∣pair the honour, power and authority due to the honored magistrates, or, on the other, infringe, weaken or make voide the liberties, priviledges or power by our constitution appertaining to the freemen, both which are more deare to us than our lives; seeing that in the temperament of both standeth the firmnesse of our civil being and the happinesse of this whole people, in the preservation of the common interest; wee thought good humbly to suggest as the result of our serious thoughts on the whole confe∣rence, that it pleased this honoured generall court to
<PB N="437" REF="011300_0221_0F86CB91CC0B34C8"/>
admit us unto the hearing of amongst themselves for our formation in the state of the case, these proposals following.</P>
<P N="1">1. That our civil constitution respecting both the form and administration of civil government, it is or ought to be founded in and upon our charter by which wee are incorporated into a body politique, and furnished both with legislative and executive power, and giveth life and strength both to the being and operations of our civil politie, and maketh us a people.</P>
<P N="2">2. That therefore this our charter is to be kept and observed inviolably in all the fundamentalls of civil policy, therein directing to the right constitution of courts and regular distribution of differing interest of power and pri∣vilege between the magistrates and the freemen, and the distinct exercise of legislative and executive power by those who are by pattent vested therewith.</P>
<P N="3">3. That in any particular which doth admit a latitude of interpretation and fall under a different understanding amongst us, such a just accommodation as may consist with our patent and best provide for the publicke satisfaction and safety is most adviseable.</P>
<P N="4">4. That although wee concurre fully with those our worthy predecessors in the ministry who when called to give their advice in the like, if not the same case, have placed the negative vote in the major part of both houses, as, in their understanding, most agreeable to the charter and conducible to the publick weale of this colony, as by their manuscripts yet extant more fully doth appeare:</P>
<P>Yet, for a present accommodation (wee humbly con∣ceive) that our honoured magistrates bill referring to the issuing of all debates in matters of judicature (in case of the non-concurrence of both houses voting apart) unto the vote of the whole court mett together, or the major part of them, whereof the governor, deputie governor and four magistrates, or otherwise five of the magistrates at least shall alwayes bee a part, to the making any valid act; wee say wee humbly conceive that a mutuall concession here∣unto and a joynt concurrance herein may bee a sitt medium
<PB N="438" REF="011300_0222_0F86CB92917E7848"/>
of such an accommodation, as that which falls within a true latitude of interpetation, and for this wee humbly submit our reasons to your consideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because the patent doth expresly make and denomi∣nate two distinct estates constituting this corporation, as 1st, That of the governor, deputy governor and assistants. 2dly, That of the freemen. Therefore, either to confound these two estates of magistrates and freemen, so as that there should be noe distinction in the exercise of executive power, or to divest the magistrates of the exercise of all executive power, or to invest the freemen with a power equall unto, and in case above, the magistrates in the finall determination of matters of judicature; or to swallow up the whole estate of the magistracy, with all their interest of place, power and patent right together, by a major vote of the freemen in court, doth seem to us to shake and overthrow the boundaries of two distinct estates laid in the charter.</P>
<P N="2">2. Because the patent doth, according to our under∣standing of it, constitutue a quorum of the magistrates in all generall courts, with whom there is a negative vote in matters properly appertaining to that court, else what meanes that clause divers times industriously inserted, of which the governor, deputy governor and six of the ma∣gistrates shall be seven, which, if so, then totally to null that quorum and negative vote together, seems to us to bee a fundamentall errour in government, according to patent.</P>
<P N="3">3. Because, to leave the finall determination of judica∣ture in any case altogether to the freemen, doth tend to evacuate our great liberty and priviledge of election, as to one main end of it, unto which our honoured magistrates are solemnly sworne, viz. the administration of eivil justice according to the lawes of the land, which they cannot possibly doe if altogether superseded by the major vote of the freemen in generall court; all which, wee humbly conceive would be prevented if the aforesaid accommoda∣tion may bee attained.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="439" REF="011300_0222_0F86CB92917E7848"/>5. That for the prevention of trouble and expence of time to the honoured generall court, by hearing and deter∣mineing cases civill or criminall, it seemes expedient, by law, to provide that there may bee a more open way to an issue of such cases in inferiour courts of judicature, by the agree∣ment of bench and jury, and that the magistrates may be, by expresse law, directed to accept the juries verdict and to grant judgment accordingly, unlesse they shall judge the juries verdict to be evidently contrary to law and evidence, in which case, that they may bee impowered by law to cause the jurie to answer for their default, in the same court, before a jurie of twenty four persons chosen by the freemen, or otherwise to bee liable to bee served by the party aggrieved with a writ of attainder out of the same court, or otherwise as this honoured court may see more aptly and amply to provide.</P>
<P>It being the great liberty of an English subject to be tryed by his peers, before whom he hath free and full libertie to plead law for his indempnitie and safety.</P>
<P N="6">6. That when the worthy deputies in generall court engage as judges in matters of judicature it may bee thought meet and just that they are sworne according to law, so farre at least as the magistrates are sworne, which seemes necessary in reason.</P>
<P N="1">1st, That acting joyntly and together with the magi∣strates they may act under the same obligation of law and conscience. It seemes very incongruous, that of joynt judges some should bee sworne to judge according to law, and others left with a latitude to judge according to judg∣ment and conscience only, and so that the magistrates should be only judges and the deputies judges and chan∣cellors in the same court.</P>
<P N="2">2d. That our persons, names, estates, lives, and all, may bee under the protection of law, which is the great secu∣ritie of the subject, and that it may not rest in the judg∣ment and conscience of any of our judges to vacate our lawes and in an extrajudiciall way to passe judgment in any case under a legall cognizance.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="440" REF="011300_0223_0F86CB93457523F8"/>7. The premises notwithstanding, wee humbly propose, whether that such cases as are already lying before or de∣pending in this honourable court, either by petition or otherwise, may not, for the furtherance of the accommo∣dation abovesaid, be admitted unto a hearing in the wonted way of procedure in this court as heretofore.</P>
<P>These proposalls wee doe in all humillity and faithfull∣nesse present and submit unto the serious considerations of this honourable court, and being under the awfull sense of the great necessity of the amicable agreement of both houses in such a time as this, wee doe most humbly and unfaynedly beseech him who is the wonderfull coun∣sellor and prince of peace, of whose government and peace there shall bee no end, that hee would guide you by his counsell and fill you with the spirit of wisdome and coun∣sell and of the feare of the Lord, to make you of quicke understanding in the feare of the Lord, that you may bee able to discerne and conclude upon such a way of agree∣ment in this matter as may bee for the glory of his name, peace and welfare of his people here and your account with joy in the great day of the Lord.</P>

<P>THIS opportunity gives occasion of these lines, wee have had a quiett and peaceable election, no alter∣ation or addition; O what a price doth divine patience yett betrust us with, when he is drawing out the sword and arraying himself with the garments of vengeance as to other kingdomes, and when it is more than probable many garments are tumbling in blood. As to the news from England all men, both wise and others of more or∣dinary cappassityes, looke on the effect or produce thereof will be as black a daye in the world, as the world hath knowne. The late actions in England in commissionating their fleet to seise and fall on the Hollander, of which I wrote you in my last, breaking their league, joyning with the French, assisting them with souldiers out of England, and with their principall harbours to receive a numerous army and shutting up the exchequer, whereby many are outed of their estates contrary to all lawe, are thinges that both in England and here, by men of all sorts, are looked up∣on as strange, horrid, and omminous. There is another ship expected, one Jonas Clarke, (if not stopped by the embargo or otherwise) in which one Dr. Hoare, a minister, is ex∣pected. Remember me to mine and thine, with my love to all with you. I cannot forgett you before the father of spirits, night and daye.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR short letter with the treasurer's and your bills I received, which were very welcome, having re∣ceived by them the newes of your hopeful recovery from soe great an illness, wherein God hath spared you to that country as a publique mercy I hope as well as your friends and family, which the Lord in mercy continue, and carry you on in your worke to the perfecting of that
<PB N="443" REF="011300_0224_0F86CB940A88BB48"/>
which God in his councell hath further to continue your use and services to accomplish. According to your orders the 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> is payd in to Mr. Floyd upon Mr. Rawson's ac∣count, and 64<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> received into my owne hands by vertue of the bill sent by Mr. Saltonstall, and the new one of 44<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> charged on Capt. Peirce, which is in my hands, saving what hath binn disbursed, according to your order, to Mr. Rushworth, whom I have, as you directed, employed since 24th June last, to have an eye upon your affayres, though I neglect it not myselfe. I agreed to give him 3 guynies a quarter and have accordingly payd him 9 at the rates they goe, which is 20<ABBR>s.</ABBR> a piece, and have agreed to be at all contingent charges of fees or transcribing papers; which besides a croune or thereabout which I have layd out is all yet out of purse; unless you shall think fitt to allow any thing towards the charges of the publique papers I have formerly and now sent, which I have hitherto payd out of my owne wholly. Your letter directed to Dr. Owen, Mr. Woodbridge and myselfe, wee did not communicate to him, his abode being at Newberry and seldome in towne, and, betwixt you and I, wee judge one that is not very likely to be serviceable to you. You need not give any account of it to Mr. Symons. Through Gods goodness there is not the least cause to write to you about any thing at present that concernes you, saving that New-York being restored by the peace one Mr. Andrews is appointed governor, a man I know not; and some rumour is mali∣ciously spread at court that you have made peace with the Dutch there, which is obviated by the readiness of some persons to shew the falshood of it. I hope nothing will for this year further disturbe you, and if any thing doe arise it will be from New-Yorke and the government there, I have therefore greatly encouraged some gentlemen your friends, who would purchase it of his royall highness, as thinking it will be much for your peace, who are about it, but how it will issue I know not. Mr. Rushworth hath not had any thing to doe for you as yet, but only to at∣tend what the council table or council of trade should
<PB N="444" REF="011300_0225_0F86CB94C0C60B38"/>
passe, before the last of which Plymouth patent hath layn long, but nothing done in it. I hope you shall want no infor∣mation, only I hear the King is offended that some of your ships take in their lading from Virginia and goe to France and defraud his customes, as alsoe from other plantations; to which I know not what to say. The truth is, pro∣roguing the parliament is some yea much discontent to them, when they had soe many good things before them, and the present transactions in Europe, with the kings vast debts, and their not having yet come to any resolve as to the future way of paying of them, takes up all their thoughts that they have little time to mind such minute things as yours, untill some old things be againe revived or new provocations given, in which I doubt not God will enable you to walke wisely. All the publique news and papers most choyce, as to manuscript or print, that have come out in the time of war or parliament, I have enclosed in a box which my brother Hammond will take up, it is shipped in Mr. Clements, whom I have ordered to deliver them to you and pray you, after you have perused them, to let my father have them for the use of friends; and were there any thing considerable that is not there I should add it, saving the presaging of mens minds of some dangers of papists and popery, and other things not fit for papers. The 2 nations are discomposed as to the prorogueing of the parliament, especially Scotland, where hath binn sad jangling betwixt the Duke of Lauderdale and the nobility, which may issue in disquietments. I am, I bless God, well, with my wife, who presents you and your lady with her service, and soe are all your relations. God hath binn afflicting our family here, having taken away lately my only daughter, and alsoe, as I hear, my relations there have had sore breaches, the Lord sanctifye to them and me his holy hand. Since my last it hath pleased God to re∣move by death Mr. Lodor, Mr. Venning and some other ministers of the presbiterian perswasion, holy men and much lamented; as alsoe lately Sir Thomas Temple, whom melancholy and griefe hath killed by his hard usage

from Mr. Elliott, but especially the occasion given of scan∣dall by his lodging at his old Mrs. her house, Mrs. Martin, which having heard the echo of again from New England, from the letters that some too uncharitably wrote, did sit deep upon his spirit and hastened his end: He sent for mee and I was with him severall houres, before hee dyed a week, and hee layd open his soul; it was a meer acci∣dent, yea great necessity, I judge, afterward that cast him at that wretches house; hee did declare in the presence of God, that noe temptation, noe not in a lust after her, had ever come upon his spirit but contrarywise a great abhor∣rence of it, was deeply afflicted that any had soe much ag∣grevated the report, and that the name of God should suffer. I saw neither disease nor paine that would hasten his end, but his spirit broken, his inward estate darke, wherein God did enable mee to doe him some small service. I hope he had the root of the matter in him and is gone home to rest. Your concussions you have at the colledge doe greatly grieve mee, and soe much the more that noe friend hath binn pleased to give me a true state of it, but all I gather, from them that I see, are wholly of one syde; it causeth a great rumour here, and is greatly ag∣gravated to the presidents reproach, in whom I am con∣cerned, for hee was a member with us, but it seems hath joined himselfe with the 3d church at Boston, which sur∣prizeth me, although I doe judge his relation thereby to us is erazed, all that I would say is, that it hath by our New England friends here binn layd as a reproach upon all the elders, yet I think without cause; for if our letter bee viewed you will not find that wee did recommend him to bee your president, wee judged that too much for us to undertake, nor did wee excite him to come or urge him upon such hopes; it was his own eagre desire after it and his thinking that hee might bee serviceable there; all wee sayd was, that since hee was prepared to come wee thought him one that might bee helpfull in your colledge worke and left it with you to judge how; if there be any other expressions, or to the like purpose of what I mention, they
<PB N="446" REF="011300_0226_0F86CB96832A3DE0"/>
are none of ours; I hope the letter is kept, and if you would doe mee the favour to send mee the original, or a true copy, I should returne it to you again safely, though I had rather have the original. I hope that noe recom∣mendation of ours will cause you to continue him, if you find him unfitt; better hee suffer than the glory of the colledge bee mined, as is the expression of several letters from the very best hands there. Just as I was writing this, came to hand yours of the 12th of February 1673, wherein I have some account of the things I am now wri∣ting about, for which I thanke you, and find your candid opinion of the Dr's actings, like to Mr. Stoughton's who gave mee much the same sentiments about the matter of fact, but did not instance in what was charged against him. I hope God will pleas to heal that breach or to direct you to what may bee most for the good of the colledge; and to add noe more of that, the kind and obliging expressions which you are pleased to use towards mee I returne you my humble thanks for, and pray I may be continued in your love and prayers as I desire to mind you in mine, though weak and sinfull. Sir, I shall only further ac∣quaint you that Capt. Peirce required a discharge for the whole summe, and considering the 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> came not into my hands, and yet I have charged myselfe with it by a general acquittance to him, I think for my discharge it is but necessary that I have, for soe much paid by your order, a discharge from your treasurer, which I beg you to re∣member.

<SALUTE>Ever honored Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is noe little trouble to some here to understand that you are under some indisposition of body, that you write to few friends here, the Lord strengthen your heart and hands in that great worke which the Lord hath layd before you. It is very grievous to your friends here, not only to us ministers, but your commissioners for the col∣ledge, to heare of the great breach that is made in it, wee wonder at the occasion of it, that they doe not either strenthen the hands of Mr. Hore that so the worke may go on, or else some other able man may be put into the place. For the wound will widen by delays, and if the colledge dye, the churches (some judge) will not live long after it. Mr. Penoyer's meanes given to it, about forty pounds per ann. I feare will goe another way when it falls, if there be noe colledge; and divers other intended gifts. Wee have some money offered to be payd for the colledge, &amp;c. divers youths desire to come over to study there, but I doe give noe encouragement to them soe long as things are in such a broken condition in the colledge. Thus with my deare love to yourselfe and good mistress Leverett, and Mr. Oxenbridge, I commend you all to God's blessing in Christ Jesus.</P>

<P>Let me assure you that here is at present a great designe of foote for the regulation of New-England, but you have no man here to prevent your trouble or speake a word for you; your country ought to be at some charge

<P>Sir, I should have beene ashamed to scrible thus to such a one as yourselfe, but I dare not be wanting to my duty, though my weaknes at present (as to writing) disinables mee, yet through mercy otherwise well. Oh! that I could say soe of your good friends Dr. Owen, Mr. Hooke, who are in a languishing condition. I hope shortly wee shall receive neare an hundred pounds for the Colledge, though I was the first (I thinke) that first moved Mr. Doddridge to give, yet I will not take it; it may be I shall accept of tenn pounds, for I can say the getting of it now, after nine years with-holding of it, has cost mee many journeys to London and some money.</P>

<P>I Understand by my cosin Peter Sergeant, who hath a good quantity of powder of myne in his hands, that the authority of your collony refused to let him sell it, when he had good opportunitys, for my advantage, by which meanes its like to prove a greate lose to me. If it be soe, I desire you will seriously consider whether the collony is not to make me reparation, by taking the pow∣der at the rates he might have sould it. And first I must tell you, in fact, its what his Majesty doth here, for since the war our salpeter did rise considerably to transporte, his Majesty prohibited the exportation and paid us the same price to a farthing, reddy money, that we could have sould it for, and hath the peter still in his stores. And though particular persons must submit to the publique, yet where there is a damage the publique is better able, and in con∣science
<PB N="449" REF="011300_0227_0F86CB974DE8CA80"/>
ought to beare it, it being but little to each particu∣lar person when the whole beares it, but heavy where one beares it; and if there be a benefit, as undoubtedly it was judged, the whole did pertake of it, which they ought to doe at theire owne charge and not at mine. Besides in∣deed, I thinke it good pollecy to incouredg your having store in your country of that commodity, in case of need, which the restraining the free dispose of it will hinder; though as a lover of your country I must say it were your interest to make it there. Sir, I appeale to you for justice and desire you will see me righted.</P>
<P>There has been much discourse and complaint about Mr. Gorges's pattent; it were good if such things were taken up, least in the future they prove prejudiciall. If the country would buye out their claime it may be done, or if you could propound how their title might answer the disburse of the money, I should joine with others or doe it my self, but being wholly ignorant of the thing have refused any discourse with the proprieters, though have binn often invited to it. Pray let me have your thoughts about it, which will much governe mee.</P>

<P>I Formerly wrote unto you about my suffering in my powder, in which I hope you will see mee righted; since which, being at the corporation for the propagateing the gospel amongst the Indians, I found the commissioners letter did not incoredge the sending any stocke into the country, but upon consideration amongst themselves have at last resolved to send some, remitting it into the hands of
<PB N="450" REF="011300_0228_0F86CB991E5A0118"/>
Mr. John Richards and Mr. Peter Sergeant, to be im∣proved for that worke. If you please to advise with them and others, and find a way of certain improvement by buying lands, mortgages or other security, I am confi∣dent the corporation may be inclined to goe in debt here to remitt a good some over. And indeed if you had my apprehensions of things you would endeaver it.</P>
<P>And now to returne to what I began with. I am per∣swaded your country will afford good peter and it would be your advantage to make powder yourselves, and in the mean time to have a store by you, that you may not be in straights, upon any sudden breach. I wish I may not be a prophet (as I have binn twice to some amongst you) in this, that I feare another warre. Upon which account, had I had the freedom of the dispose of the commodity, or that the country would have bought it now its cheape, I should have sent a large supply this yeare, but now for∣beare untel I heare from you, and may then doe it, if the doar be open.

<P>I Hope myne with the papers I sent you are long be∣fore this time come to your hand, wherein you will see what I have to write concerning yourselves, and alsoe the general state of things amongst us, glad I am I have nothing more to add in relation to yourselves, save only that, since I wrote last, there hath been a proposition of alienating by the proprietors the province of Mayn and what you call New-Hampshyre to the King, to make an interest of it to the Duke of Monmouth, and it is proposed that he should send a governor to rayse to himselfe a re∣venew from it. I hope it will come to nothing. He that was all agog to goe governor thither, I had him dealt withall by a friend and such discouragements layd before him, and the ridiculousnes of hoping for such a revenue as was proposed of 5000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a year, or more, to the Duke, that I think it is layd aside. To be sure I shall, by the last ships, to which I refer my larger letters to you, give you a further account of that or any thing else that shall con∣cerne you, but I judge you have little reason to expect any

I shall only add, that there may be somewhat more considerable, as to the publique, by the last returne of the ships, which I shall either by writing or prints send you; some stirs are in Scotland about the late impositions, which what they will produce time will shew; somewhat I shall send you by the next; their parliament is desolved and the nation in a scurvy temper; whether ours will meet again next season appointed I know not, much de∣pends upon it; I am now at the waters for my health, from whence I now write.

I pray God still continue you usefull, as to making up breaches there in church and state. As to what you intimate about the removing of the Dr. in reference to the colledge, I think, neither myselfe or others are any further concerned than to be sorry such a breach hath binn under his hand, and to beg of God to direct you in a right choyce.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Most dear and honored Mother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the 23d July I received yours of the 29th March 1674, with the inclosed that should have come last year, hoping you have also by this time received mine of the 21st May last, which informs you how it was then with myselfe and your old friend Mr. R.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whaley.</NOTE> and that I wrote largely to yourselfe and dear Mrs. Jaines, in October last, which I perceive you have not received, which I am very sorry for; but it hath been a great mercy that all my former letters came safely to your hands, and as for those, know∣ing the hazard of their miscarriage by reason of the warres, I kept the coppyes of them, and for your further satis∣faction I have again transcribed, that you may see I was not unmindfull of my duty in writing to you and answer∣ing your desire of my advice concerning my sister Fr.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">His daughter Frances.</NOTE> of whose disposall in marriage you have now given me the account, so far as you conceive you could, and I believe are longing to understand my thoughts of it. Dear mo∣ther, you are pleased to say well, that you gave me an account how it hath pleased the Lord to dispose of her, &amp;c. It is indeed the Lord, who is her heavenly father, that hath disposed of her and provided this husband for her, and therefore, tho he be unknowne to me, I do believe he is the fittest person in the world for her, and that she like∣wise is the most meet help for him. I remember in a former letter to yourselfe, when you desired my thoughts in a matter concerning her, I tould you I was confident the Lord would take care of her and in due time provide a husband for her, and now he hath done it, shall I question whether he hath done it well? No, I dare not do it. It is a great satisfaction to me that you sought the Lord, and tooke advise of our dear and christian friends, and that my syster was guided in her choyse by yourselfe
<PB N="454" REF="011300_0230_0F86CBA202552330"/>
and them, and desire with you to blesse the Lord that hath provided so well for her, and shall not cease to pray night and day on their behalfe, that the Lord will be pleased to make them great blessings to each other, and that this new condition may be, every way and allways, comfortable to them both, for as you very truely say, it will be as the Lord shall be pleased to make it. I pray remember my most tender and affectionate love to them both, and tell them that I greatly long to see them; but since that can∣not be at present, you may assure them that whilst they shall make it their great worke to love the Lord Jesus in sincerity, and love one another dearly for Christ's sake, and to carry it with tender love and dutyfull respect to yourselfe, I shall esteem it my duty to love and pray, and act faith for them as if they were my own children, being not otherwise able at this distance to be helpfull to them. Dear mother, that yourselfe and all friends did so well ap∣prove the match gives much content to my heart, and I beseech you not to give way to any recoylings that may arise in your own spirit; do not say, as to the world, my sister might have done much better, the Lord knowes what is best for us, and ours; it may be that which wee may think would have been better might have proved much worse. These are dying times, wherein the Lord hath been and is breaking down what he hath built, and plucking up what he hath planted, and therefore it is not a time to be seekeing great things for ourselves. Let us read the 45th chap. of Jeremiah, and apply to ourselves what the Lord there speakes to Baruch, and account it a great mercy if he give us our lives for a prey, and bring us again to see the faces one of another with comfort, The things, that Baruch is dehorted from seeking, were worldly things, why then are they called great things? Surely the Lord speakes it onely according to the esteem that we are too apt to have of them, for the worlds great things are indeed and in truth but poor little things, and the saints should looke down upon them with contempt, and shew themselves to be of high raised spirits, seeking
<PB N="455" REF="011300_0230_0F86CBA202552330"/>
things truly great, as our Lord himselfe doth exhort us, Mat. 6.33. But seeke you first the kingdom of God and his righteousnesse, as if he had saide, for they are great things, worthy your affectionate endeavours, and as for all these little things which gentiles so earnestly pursue, they shall be added unto you so far as your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of them. My poor sister begins her housekeeping at a time when trading is low, and all provisions dear, and I cannot but pitty her in that respect. I hope she will not be discouraged nor her hus∣band neither, but for prevention I desire them to consider seriously and to act faith upon that most excellent councell our Lord delivered with authority in his sermon on the mount, Mat. 6th from the 24th ver. to the end of the chapter. I cannot but be full of longings to heare how the Lord hath dealt with her in her lying in, but I doubt not you will take the first opportunity to inform us of it, in the mean time I shall endeavour to stay myselfe upon the promise made to childe-bearing women, 1 Tim. 2.15.</P>
<P>Dear mother, I have been hetherto congratulating my newly marryed syster, but I must now turn aside to drop a few tears upon the hearse of her that is deceased, whose losse I cannot choose but lament with tears, and so share with you in all the providences of God towards us; but my dear mother, let me not hereby be the occasion of re∣newing your griefe, for I doubt not but you have grieved enough, if not too much, allready. Let us consider how graciously the Lord deales with us (as for my dear syster, shee is got beyond our pitty, we need not lament for her sake, but rather rejoyce that shee is at rest in the bosom of Christ) who whilest he is taking from us with one hand, gives double with the other. He hath added one to your family on whom I hope you may set that motherly affection as if he were your own son, and I hope hath before this time also made you to rejoyce in the fruit of my systers womb; and shall not we say with Job, the Lord hath gi∣ven, and the Lord hath taken, blessed be the name of the Lord. But oh how apt are wee to murmur, if the Lord
<PB N="456" REF="011300_0231_0F86CBA369D8FF58"/>
do in any thing displease us, but what a shame it were that we should be displeased at any thing which God doth? Who are wee, that wee should set our corrupt wills in op∣position to his most holy and blessed will. It is blessed counsell that a reverend minister of the gospell gives, who had been in the schoole of affliction, that I lately met with in a printed booke of his, I pray you (saith he) drink in that notion, viz. That the will of God being pure, holy, perfect, yea God himselfe, should not onely be submitted to, or rested in, but loved and chosen above all creatures, yea above life itselfe, the best of creatures. Would wee but once learne this lesson (which the Lord is, I hope, teaching of us by all his dealings with us) and help us (as you say sweetly in your letter) to see love in all his dis∣pensations, there could nothing come amisse to us.</P>
<P>Dear mother, I perceive, when you wrote last, you were upon a remove from those dear friends with whome you then sojourned, I hope the Lord guided you to that mo∣tion, and shall long to hear where you settle; in the mean time, it is my comfort that the Lord tells all your wan∣drings, and receives all your tears into his bottle, and will not faile to direct all your steps, till he hath given you a safe conduct through your wearysome pilgrimage, and at the end thereof open unto you an abundant entrance into those mansions that are prepared for you in our fathers house, where you shall be at rest in the bosome of Christ for ever.</P>
<P>Your old friend, Mr. R. is yet living, but continues in that weake condition of which I formerly have given you account, and have not now much to add. He is scarce capable of any rationall discourse, his understanding, me∣mory and speech doth so much faile him, and seems not to take much notice of any thing that is either done or said, but patiently bears all things and never complaines of any thing, tho' I feare it is some trouble to him that he hath had no letter of a long time from his cozen Rich, but speaks not one word concerning it, nor any thing you wrote of in your last, onely, after I had read your
<PB N="457" REF="011300_0231_0F86CBA369D8FF58"/>
letters to him, being asked whether it was not a great re∣freshment to him to hear such a gracious spirit breathing in your letters, he said it was none of his least comforts, and indeed he scarce speakes any thing but in answer to questions when they are put to him, which are not of many kinds, because he is not capable to answer them; the com∣mon and very frequent question is to know how he doth, and his answer, for the most part, is, very well, I praise God, which he utters with a very low and weake voyce; but sometimes he saith, not very well, or very ill, and then if it be further said, do you feele any pain any where, to than he allwaies answereth, no; when he wants any thing he cannot well speake for it, because he forgets the name of it, and sometimes asks for one thing when he meanes another, so that his eye or his finger is oftentimes a better interpreter of his mind than his tounge; but his ordinary wants are so well known to us, that most of them are sup∣plyed without asking or making signes for them, and some help he stands in need of in every thing to which any motion is required, having not been able, of a long time, to dresse or undresse himselfe, nor to feed, or ease nature either way, orderly, without help, and its a great mercy to him that he hath a friend that takes pleasure in being helpfull to him, and I blesse the Lord that gives me such a good measure of health and strength, and an opportunity and a heart to use it in so good and necessary a worke; for tho' my help be but poor and weake, yet that ancient servant of Christ could not well subsist without it, and I do believe, as you are pleased to say very well, that I do enjoy the more health for his sake. I have sometimes wondered much at this dispensation of the Lord towards him, and have some expectations of more than ordinary issue; the Lord help us to profit by all, and to waite with patience upon him, till we shall see what end he will make with us. Thus farr I write of myselfe, I shall now ask him what he would have me to say to his friends concern∣ing him. The question being asked, he saith, I am better than I was. And being asked what I should say more to
<PB N="458" REF="011300_0232_0F86CBA561E58D20"/>
his cozen R. or any other friends, after a long pauze, he again saide, the Lord hath visitted me in much mercy, and hath answered his visitation upon me. (I give it you in his own words.) Being desirous to draw more from him, I proposed severall questions and the sume of his answers were, that he earnestly desires the continuance of the fervent prayers of all his friends for him, and desires to be remembered to his cozen Rich and longs to receive a let∣ter from her, and desires her to exhort her son and daugh∣ters, his dear cozens, to fear God, and to be remembered to her aunt at Chelsey, praying that the Lord will requite all her great love, as also to be remembred to Mrs. Jaines and her good husband, to whom also he thinkes himselfe greatly obliged for their great love, and in particular for Mrs. Jaines her care of poor Nol. desiring her to continue the same; as also to be remembred to yourselfe, and wish∣eth Frank much comfort in her new condition, and saith he shall not cease to pray for you and all yours. This is written on the 6th of August, but I know not when I shall have opportunity to send to Boston, it may be there∣fore before I send away my letter I may have something more to add concerning him.</P>
<P>Thus far I proceeded yesterday, but night coming on and having something else to do, I could proceed no fur∣ther, and so laid aside my paper, intending this morning to finish (if the Lord pleased) my answer to yours of the 29th March. But now my first worke must be to tell you that, thro' the great goodnesse of God, I did also last night, after supper, receive your welcome letter of the 8th of May (Franks birthday) wherein you let me know that you have also received mine of the 2d of October last, at such a season, which made it the more refreshing to you, which is a great satisfaction and comfort to me, for which I desire to blesse the Lord; but it would have been the more full if you had but said, with the inclosed to dear Mrs. Jaines, which I have lately transcribed, together with your owne, from the originalls, with a purpose to have sent them with this, but I shall send neither, for I have good hopes that
<PB N="459" REF="011300_0232_0F86CBA561E58D20"/>
both were received, for I cannot but think when you com∣plained that the dore of your house was opened, if halfe of your goods had been taken away you would have made mention of it; for your own letter was both the house and inventorie of all the goods contained in it.</P>
<P>Dear Mother, it is also a great comfort to me to hear that the Lord was graciously pleased to appear on my dear systers behalfe in the needfull hour, and desire with you to blesse the Lord for that great mercy, and I heartily thanke you for giving me so quick a notice of it. Dear mother, it was likewise a great mercy that the Lord was pleased so far to satisfie your desire as to shew you the fruite of her wombe and to make you the joyfull grandmother of a son, and tho' it hath pleased the Lord so soon to trans∣plant him from the militant to the triumphant church, yet it may be a great comfort to yourselfe and my dear syster, that from your wombs hath proceeded the increase to the misticall body of Jesus Christ, and reckon it a mercy that the Lord being purposed to take him from you in his in∣fancy, was pleased (that it might be the more easy to you) to do it before it had much time to take deep root in your affections, for I do believe the longer yourselves and his other relations had enjoyed him the harder it would have been to us all to have parted with him: But what shall we say more? It may be such considerations as these are too selfish, it is enough to compose the hearts of the children of God under every providence, to say, it is the Lord that hath done it, our loving and tender hearted infinitely wise Father hath declared his royall pleasure, and it is our duty to sub∣mit to it, yea to rejoyce in it (for it is most meet he should dispose of us and ours as shall seem good in his sight) and to apply ourselves to learn the lessons he would teach us thereby, and among the rest that is none of the least which you mention, to get our hearts weaned from creature comforts and to live upon himselfe as our allsufficient soul satisfying portion; and let my dear brother and syster re∣member what the H. G. saith, Lam. 3.27. It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. Dear mother,
<PB N="460" REF="011300_0233_0F86CBA6049A63F8"/>
I pray, in your next, speake a little more fully concerning his godlinesse, for you say nothing to that, except by the phraise of a very honest man, you mean a very godly man, as I hope you do; for you give the same epethite to that good man (whose word you tooke concerning him) of whom another friend saith that he is a very godly man, aged and wise, &amp;c. I pray, remember my dear love to syster Judeth, and tell her from me she must now be a very good childe, and labour to know the God of her fa∣ther and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind, 1 Chr. 18.9. and leaving to grieve for her syster and nephew that are at rest with God, strive with all her might to be a comfort to her poor afflicted mother, who is contesting with the difficulties and temptations of an evil world. I humbly thanke you for your motherly love and care for me, in your being so desirous to supply my wants; and because you are pleased to lay your com∣mands upon me, I shall make bould, when I need your help in that kind, to write to you for it. There is yet a little meale in the barrel and oyle in the cruise. The greatest thing I need is a heart to abide patiently in this condition untill it be expended. I cannot but account it a great mercy that in these hard times you should be able to be so helpfull to your poor children; but I beseech you let not your love to them make you to forget yourselfe, in parting with what is necessary for your own comfort in your old age. Dear mother, you say you find nature greatly decaying in you, and therefore desire prayers that grace may be strengthened, &amp;c. It cannot be otherwise expected but that as age comes on nature will decay; but I beseech you preserve it what you can, and take heed of immoderate griefes, or whatsoever else may be prejudiciall to your health, which you are able ta avoyde, and when you have done all you can, if you still perceive the out∣ward man perishing, yet faint not, for I do believe, through the faithfulnesse of God, your inward man shall be re∣newed day by day, 2 Cor. 4.16. I blesse the Lord, tho' I cannot deny but I feele, with you, the decayes of nature,
<PB N="461" REF="011300_0233_0F86CBA6049A63F8"/>
yet I have and do enjoy a competent measure of health and strength, and beg your pardon if I have been too slow in acquainting you with and giving you the comfort of it. I thanke you for what you have written concerning those relations I desired to heare of; and the rather because you say you cannot write much, through the weaknesse of your eyes, and I feare it may hurt them to read these long let∣ters, for I desire you first to reade and then seale and de∣liver the inclosed to my honored and dear friend D. G. with my best respects to him and his dear wife. My dear mother, I recommend to you the counsell and promise given to the Philipians, chap. 4. 4, 5, 6, 7. and let me in∣treat you to rejoyce in the Lord alway, and again I say rejoyce; and I beseech you remember that weake eyes are made weaker by too much weeping.

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>Now, my dear mother, give me leave in a postscript to be a little merry with you, and yet serious too. There is one word in one of your letters that sounds so harshly, and looks so untowardly, that I cannot tell well how to read or looke upon it, and I know not how to write it, and yet I must, though I crosse it out againe. I sup∣pose you do by this time sufficiently wonder what will follow; but the matter is this, after you had given me a loving account of a businesse wherein you have done your best, you were pleased to say, that if I should be
<PB N="462" REF="011300_0234_0F86CBA6CDA54558"/>
<HI>angry</HI> you had many to beare with you, &amp;c. Rash an∣ger, I confesse, is a burthen that needs more shoulders than one to beare it; for Solomon saith, a stone is heavy and the sand weighty, but a fools wrath is hea∣vier than them both. But oh, my dear mother, how could you feare such a thing from me? Yourselfe knoweth I never yet spake an angry word to you, nay I hope I may say (without taking the name of God in vain) the Lord knoweth I never conceived an angry thought towards you, nor do I now, nor I hope never shall, and in so saying I do not commend myselfe, for you never gave me the least cause, neither have you now, and I believe never will; therefore, dear mother, the whole praise belongs to yourselfe, or rather to the Lord, who, blessed be his name, hath so united our hearts together in love that it is a thing scarce possible to be angry one with another. But I shall now con∣clude with a request that you will not be angry with yourselfe for writing that word I have spoken so much against, for I suppose all your meaning was, if I should not alltogether approve of what was done, &amp;c. and I am abundantly satisfied that the root from which that feare sprung was tender love, and that you speake your heart when you say you love and honour me as much as ever, which may well increase my longings after you, for the exceeding grace of God in you. Now thankes be unto God for his unspeakeable gift. 2 Cor. 9.14, 15.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The remarkable circumstances of two persons who had made so considerable a figure in England will, I hope, excuse the publi∣cation of this long letter, altho' it has no immediate relation to the affairs of the Massachusets colony.</NOTE></P>

<P>YOURS of the 10th April is before me and thereby understand as by Capt. Peirce of the money that was in his hand is paid according to order, also of your engaging Mr. Rushworth in our busynes and for your disburse to him, and those papers you send us and all other your charges is expected that you place to account, and not to put you to the charge; your time and endeavours for us is more than is meet we should expect from you, and I hope we shall be able in tyme to goe beyond, but in the meane tyme please to accept of the acknowledgment of your true friends, which on their behalf as my owne I hereby freely give you. For your providentially being restrayned from communicating ours to Mr. B. I am well pleased with, and shall make use thereof according to your information. I heartily desire you to present my service to the reve∣rend my honored friend though unknown to him D. J. O. whome I have cause to acknowledge, having had through the mercy of the Lord tastes of his goodnes in attending upon him in his ordenances, by his administration, and

otherways by his prints. Your testimony of Sir Thomas Temple, a little before his exitt, allays the reports by others raised, I hope falsely. For the busines of the col∣ledg with us wee have cause to be humbled, that through animosityes wee should cause discouragement to those at so great distance that wish us well, that they are hindred in their freedom in the forwarding of that worke, I must freely say it to you I see not the reason, but that a per∣verse spirit seems to be our judgment. The Lord hum∣ble us in the sence of it; yet I hope we are groweing over it. Thy Doctor's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor Hoar the President of the College.</NOTE> opposers loose ground, and I hope the worke will yet be carryed an end. The not effecting the disappointment of the last commencement, and the Lord's helping the Doctor in that act to pass with general acceptance gives some hopes that he may gett over the check given him in his beginning, which may make him more cautious for time to come; who is, I doubt, nor so cautious in his comeing off from former engagement as he ought before he enters upon new; his not concerneing you in his relateing himselfe in church fellowship here, I can∣not looke at as independently congregationall, I meane in a good sence, I have not had opportunity to speake to him, but intend it; he hath lately had an ague and since a flux, but in a hopeful way of recovery. Mr. Oakes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Minister of Cambridge, afterwards President of the College.</NOTE> hath had a distemper hang upon him that hath much weakned him; the greatest occasion, I thinke, is some exercise in his mind, though he thinks it is the remayne of his sick∣ness long agoe in England. I have been afraid least he may be of noe long continuance with us; but a graine of hopes that he may get over it. The Lord hath been graciously pleased to favor us in the seasons of the yeare for the fruits of the earth, blessed be his name. Our neighbours the Dutch have been very neighbourly since they had certaine intelligence of the peace. One of their captains have bin upon the French sorts, taken Penobscot, with loss of men on both sides; what they have done further east we understand not. Your brother Moody

<P>BY yours of the 27 April 74, you give me to under∣stand that you have information from Mr. Peter Sergeant that the authority of the Massachusets prohibited him from selling of your powder in his hand, and from thence claim justice by the taking off the powder at the price he could have sould it; I shall not need but re∣fer you to Mr. Sergeant, by whome these come, for the giveing you a more right understanding of what he wrote,
<PB N="466" REF="011300_0236_0F86CBA846904858"/>
for I assure you never any order past for the restraynning of him or any other to make sale of that or any other sort of goods, but the contrary, since upon the warre, an order past that the storekeeper should not deliver any but by order from some magistrates; nor will Mr. Sergeant say that ever he had any denyal upon any desire for the deli∣very of powder sould by him; there was one bound for Guyny, that had bought of him twenty barrels and clan∣destinely, contrary to law, shipped it, so that it was seiza∣ble by a law in force when you was in these parts; which powder, upon his petition, was set at liberty, and he allowed to ship off ten barrels, the other he privetly conveyed, so that he carryed all away. At the same tyme the order before mentioned was given to the storekeeper, there was an order issued for the several townes to have their stores fully supplyed according to law, which quickened the de∣mand of powder within ourselves; and the other collonyes understanding the order applyed themselves for liberty to recruite their stores, which was redily granted them, so that the order past by authority was noe obstruction but a furtherance to those that had of that commodity, both for quicknes of sale and advance of price, and this I hope is sufficient to rectifie your thoughts in that matter.</P>
<P>Sir, For the busines of Mr. Gorges pattent, which was graunted, as by the date appeares, after the Massachusets, so that the jurisdiction lyeth within the government there∣of is without question here; that there hath been several turnes therein is very true; but that there hath been any just cause of complaint of the government of the Mas∣sachusets, I am perswaded that if the whole matter weare prepared noe indifferent judges would blame them for what hath beene done by them; yet, could there be a way hit upon to stop clamours it would be a service to them. I am confident, and that upon good and rational grounds, had Mr. Gorges what he desires from the Massa∣chusets he would not find the place turne to his profitt, but rather an addition to former losse; and should any purchase his pretentions, in expectation of profitt, they
<PB N="467" REF="011300_0236_0F86CBA846904858"/>
would miss in their expectation; yet, could the busines be tooke up with him, it might be a service to this govern∣ment, in preventing clamours. In order thereto, and you please to treat with them concerned, that thereby you may understand what they claime and the grounds thereof, and what proposal they will make, and give notice thereof, you should receive answer thereto; or might his preten∣tions be bought off for five hundred pounds, and assurance given to take off all after claimes and claimers against the collony of the Massachusets or others upon the place, and you please to ingage in it for the collony, I doe hereby oblige that the money shall be ordered to be paid there, upon such assurance given. Concerning which I may not question but that you will doe it by such advice as may be had, that it may stand good in law, and for that, possibly, you may meet with an opportunity that for present money more may be effected than by taking tyme, if you please to disburse it to the sum forementioned, I doe pass my word that you shall be imbursed your money, with consi∣deration for the same. I should not have made thus bould with you in this matter, but from your loveing encourage∣ment given by yours to me, and the confidence I have of that loveing respect you have to the peace and welfare of this place, and the churches of our Lord Jesus therein; desiring that what I have wrote in this matter may be for your use and noe thing therein may be imparted to any that may seeke occasion against the government thereby.</P>
<P>By yours of the 4th June, which came first to hand (the other not coming to my hand until the 18th instant, Mr. Sergeant can give the reason) I perceive your mind is la∣bouring for the publique good, your informations there∣to I heartily thanke you for, and shall in any thing to my power promote, for the Indian affaire with the commissio∣ners or the other gentlemen. We are upon a worke for makeing powder and have erected a mill in order there∣unto at Neponset, about 6 miles from Boston; our difficulty will be for peter, which we must, in our beginning, have from without us, but hope, in time, may raise it amongst
<PB N="468" REF="011300_0237_0F86CBA90610BC00"/>
us. We have an aincient man that came out of Kent, one Walter Everden, that made powder in England, as he saith, is imployed in the worke; and for your having liberty to ship off from hence, in case you have store with us, you shall not need to doubt it, or if a stay be made for the countreys use, but that they will make pay for the same. You may assure yourself that we see it for the publique service to encourage trade, and I hope we shall not be left to strike in with others, that labour what in them lyes to put clogs and discouragement upon the trade that the Lord hath led us into, beyond expectation in our beginnings; and you will be enformed by Mr. Sergeant that the dis∣couragement that was laide before you was upon ground∣less misprision and not from any thing done by authority to occasion it; so commending you to God, I rest,</P>

<P>YOURS of 3d August 74, came to my hand 26th 7ber. By Mr. Sargeant I wrote in answer to yours respecting powder and Mr. Gorges's busines. For the dissatisfaction you mention, in reference to vessels be∣longing to this place that goe freighted with tobacco, I doe not understand of any but one that went from our parts this yeare, mostly as it is sayd with logwood, and by charter directly bound for England, and the owners tooke bond for their ships value that noe damage should acrue to them by the freighters neglect of paying the king his dutyes. His name is Mr. Dervall. a Dutchman that came from New York, he marryed Mr. Delevall's daughter. If any of our vessels went, they went from Virginia, touch in England and put off part of their tobacco there, as I am
<PB N="469" REF="011300_0237_0F86CBA90610BC00"/>
informed. I suppose the provision made of paying the king's duty in Virginia will take off occasion of complaint for time to come; for myself I am not concerned there∣in, the general court haveing left the care of that affair with the secretary, onely shall advertise him to more cir∣cumspection in his place. I acknowledge that we are much obliged to you for your love in so friendly advising. The continuance of which favours, as it will be a service to God, so desired by him who commending you to the Lord and giving you his best respects, remains, Sir,</P>

<P>BY yours of the 24th of August I perseave you judge my complaint about the powder was groundless: The reason you give me. For my applying to you, it was upon my cozin Sergeants informing me, as I then wrote, which he still affirmes, and though he's loath to offend the government in saying any thing now that he thinkes may not be acceptable, I thinke your owne excuse, if weyed, saith enough for me; for when 20 barrels ware sould there was a great trouble to git a licence for 10, and the other ten privately carried away, which certainly hin∣dred others from endeavouring to buy any to send abroad, and that voyage, I know, might well have carried to ad∣vantage ten times that quantity: And I assure you, let the law be as aintient as it will, I will never (if I can help it) have my estate under such a restraint, and had I known it would never have had a barrel in your collony. Yet the oldness of the law takes not off the equity against the new law to compell all into one store-house, under your store∣keeper,
<PB N="470" REF="011300_0238_0F86CBA9BB738B20"/>
and that he should deliver none but by the mage∣strates order; which is prejudiciall to its sayle; for trade is a seacret thinge, and when made publicke in the perticu∣lers proves injurious to the concerned, but where such su∣pervisers will make it otherwise, and soe, upon the whole, I am not satisfied, but my first demand is grounded upon reason, and soe expect you should doe me justice. The case of peter I instanced in houlds good, for it was re∣strained by a law made before ours was imported, and yet his Majestie tooke ours off at the rate it would have yeild∣ed, which is what you ought to doe for my powder. I am alsoe much dissatisfied with my cozin Sergeants great charge of store-house rome, 32<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> per ton a year. It was a prudent case to have powder at a distance from the towne, as here in the tower, but let the quantity be never soe great that we lodge there, nothing is paid for it; soe if you had laid it upon the countrys charge, or at least a rea∣sonable ware-house rome, it might have bin excused, but because a private person, for a barrel or two, is willing, therefore to injoine for quantities, I thinke is not equall (though a factor may consent) which alsoe I leave with you for justice.</P>
<P>For the business of Mr. Gorge I should willingly have disburst the money you mention, but they are now in the clouds and expect as much a yeare, secured here, for their interest; the coppy of his, with others their petition, I gave Mr. Collins to send you, and is heare inclosed. The councell of trade have don nothing, soe its remanded to his Majesties prevy councell. As any thing passeth (soe far as I can learne) shall advise you, but am of opinion that some presents might be plaste to the countrys advantage, and yet of noe great vallue.</P>
<P>As to what you write of the 26th of September, I am glad I could say soe much to some of his Majesty's officers, yet I must informe you that the paying the custome in Virgina doth not priveledg any vessel to carry tobacco to any place but to the English plantations, and the gover∣nor of the plantation where such tobacco is brought, if it
<PB N="471" REF="011300_0238_0F86CBA9BB738B20"/>
be againe exported, is bound to take bond to bring it for England. I should be sorry that his Majestie should have any ground of offence in this kind, for a little profitt to some particular persons, to be an occasion of depriveing the whole of their chiefest injoyments. Its objected here by some that you have noe such law there, and soe will not judg by our lawes in exporting or importing of goods to or from forraine kingdomes. If it be soe, as a true friend to you, I would advise it be one of the first things you doe to prevent greater evills, which is all the trouble that at present is given you by your affectionate and faith∣full servant.</P>

<P>YOURS by Mr. Sprague I received and desire to bless God for the tydings it brings of your health and your familye, and to bee suitably affected with all other providential alterations the holy and wise God hath brought amongst you, wherein I humbly beg that poor country may hear the voice of the rod and who hath ap∣pointed it. I shall take things in order as I find them in your letter, that I may not omitt to answer all that is needfull. For Dr. Hoares concerne as to the colledge, I am very sorry that matters are soe ill that nothing can heal that breach but his laying downe, and more that hee should put the overseers to the utmost wayting for it, which I think very little prudence in him; by comparing report with report, letter with letter, I am almost con∣founded in makeing a judgment of this matter; some soe severe as to lay all the blame on him and that not only of unmeetness for the place but several moral miscarriages; others again wholly in charging one Mr. Graves and others of the fellows, and adding the emulation of several
<PB N="472" REF="011300_0239_0F86CBAA8F1ABAD0"/>
expecting the preferment; yourselfe, with others most ju∣dicious, parting it betwixt both. I chuse the medium to judge by; only methinks a passage in your letter, more direct against him than any thing formerly, doth a little startle mee, at least soe far as to beg, in your next, a true account of it, namely his want of truth in his words. Pray Sir, if you judge him justly culpable in that matter, let me privately know it, for hee is a member with us, if he re∣turne. The enclosed coppy of the letter is, as far as I remember, just as wee wrote it. My only concerne in this busines is to sympathize with the broken state of that once flourishing house, to beg of God a revival of the worke and all else in which his glory is concerned in the midst of the yeares, and to mourne over that disunited spirit amongst Gods people which appeares in this matter and all others; and what tokens of Gods displeasure are but too evident with you; the Lord humble his people, par∣don and heal the land. For the busines of Mr. Dyers petition I know nothing of that in particular but, as I hope God hath sent in Mr. Foster, you will, by my letters, understand the same thing, in effect, which now I am able to give you an account of, as far as yet the affair hath gone. The enclosed petition will shew you what they are about to put the King upon, a purchase of the propriety of the province of Main and Hampshire, and by whome transacted; hee that the King should buy it for is the Duke of Monmouth, though nothing as yet is determined; many complaints are made against you; they have thoughts of sending a commissioner thither, and it was determined to do it with some force, but their more weighty affaires and want of money will hardly admit this, I suppose, this summer; but a letter from his Majesty you will have, to order some account of these things to bee given him, and I fear that which is aymed at is to call your patent to a strict account, upon what termes you hold it; you would doe well to be in a preparation for it, especially to make good your title to that part of your government. Here is none able to speake for you, wee want instructions, papers that
<PB N="473" REF="011300_0239_0F86CBAA8F1ABAD0"/>
wee had formerly the late dreadful fire either consumed or removes have quite lost. My Lord Privy Seal, who was formerly wrote to and engaged on your behalfe, lately sent for mee, with whom I had discourse about an hour, who was as free as hee thought good with mee in this affair, and beyond his owne will I could not nor durst urge. I perceve hee takes it ill (my Lord Anglesea, who is Lord Privy Seal) that he hath not been addressed to,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Massa. Bay, Vol. I. p 3<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9.</NOTE> and the matter lies before him. I begged him you might not bee prejudged beforehand, which hee promised mee. Hee told mee the King would write to you. I think, if with the first you wrote an obliging letter to him and transmit your pleas to him as well as others that may wayt upon him, you will doe well. Your moneys in my hands will not, as things goe with us, stop any gap, by way of present; if the 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> you drew off by Mr. Rawson had bin left with your order in my hands to have bestowed it, with good advice, where it might have been placed, it would have entangled for a long time, and perhaps everted the busenes. Mr. Rushworth hath bin in salary ever since your order, at 3 guyneys a quarter, nor is that all paid, soe that with con∣tingent charges, which are not much, there will bee near 20<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> gone, when hee is paid, yet is not all hee hath done worth a rush; if my owne industry, with the help of Major Thomson, had not sifted this busines, about which I have taken many a step, hee had not had the least crevise of light into this busines; all he hath and what now hee prosecutes is upon my information; hee is old and full of busines, and hath but small interest at court: I intend, upon my owne head, to pay him to lady-day and then withold, and I think, if you would order, by the first, all the money remayneing into Major Thomsons hands, hee would make a better use of it for your advantage, his em∣ployment in the East-India company gives him frequent access to court, where hee hath opportunity to give a feeling to such clerkes of the council as may serve you with true intelligence, which I cannot doe in my circum∣stances, having not bin at Whitehall but twice in many
<PB N="474" REF="011300_0240_0F86CBAC9949F020"/>
years; and persecution is pretty hot, and if it goes on I may expect a prison for my living in the towne, and there∣fore I judge, on all accounts, hee is the fittest person, who if you oblidge in it may doe you most service. I have not nor shall acquaint him with what I write to you, be∣cause I would leave you free to your own judgment, only I pray let mee have a dischardge of what I have disbursed that I may receive my <HI>quietus est</HI> out of the exchequer, the full and just summe of which you shall have by the next ships. As to what you write of the removal of more of Gods servants in the ministry, and especially Mr. Ox∣enbridge, lately, I doe bemoan it, the Lord of the harvest send forth more labourers into it. As to any private hints you give about myselfe what they will amount to I cannot judge till I see how providence workes, and then, I fear, my resolution will not be equal to what may be desired, how willing soever I may bee, which if I were free I should deeply ponder; I doubt the church here will as soon all remove to you as myselfe; but here is too much of an affair that I know not whether I shall bee any fur∣ther concerned in than to tender my humble thankes to you for that undeserved love and respect you have shewed in your desires to have me so near to you. As for our affaires here, I have nothing to write, but I shall transmit in the publique prints, save only that the King, by the prevalency of the bishops over him, hath within this month or 6 weeks taken off the protection of his licences given us in March 72 and, together with a hot prosecution of the Papists, left us alsoe a very troublesome persecution, wherein many are spoyled of their goods, several impri∣soned, which last cost the life of a worthy minister, Mr. Thompson of Bristol, pastor of the church there; several returned upon 20<ABBR>s.</ABBR> a month into the exchequer, to their utter undoing; this city yet scapes best, you cannot ima∣gine how averse the spirit of the magestrates is to meddle with us; what importunity and opportunity may at last produce wee are fearful.

All we desire, if God keep us faithfull to himselfe, hee will deliver us from sin, the greatest evil, and we shall hope the wrath of man shall praise him and the remaynder he will restrayne. Things in the parts beyond sea look still as proceeding to further war and confusion; Hollands condition yet distracted, the protestants every where sufferers, and yet the popish swords drawne one against another. Methinks the coming of our Lord should bee near, in the faith of which wee desire to wayt. The parliament will one way or other give a great change to things and make mee have more news to send (which I shall communicate as opportunity serves) though I expect none good.</P>

<P>HAVING allways endeavoured not to bee wanting in all neighbourly and friendly manner to your colony, this is on occasion of a printed paper set forth in your names the 7th December last past of your Indyan warre, wherein, besides, is declared that Philip and his whole crew, in his retreat towards Conecticut river, recruiting himselfe with ammunition from Albany, hath prosecuted his first designe to ruine and destroy the English, &amp;c. The which being a severer imputation then could have been brought from ennemyes, without complaint or notice, much lesse from his Majesties subjects, without any knowne cause and some in your parts convicted and fined, but no men∣tion thereof. And having, unasked, acted as is knowne, and published through this government such severe or∣ders concerning Indyans, as appears on record, and parti∣cularly at Albany for sale of ammunition, to the forfeiting of estate and life, I doe therefore hereby desire you'l let me know by the bearer, what persons at Albany are guilty, that they may be proceeded against accordingly, or that exemplary punishment bee inflicted on the notorious im∣postors, to the vindication of the magistrates and all other his Majesties good subjects under his royall highnesses government in these parts, who allways have endeavoured and duely observe all his Majesties lawes. Which expect∣ing, I remaine,</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a Paper endorsed Mr. E. R's. Narrative Sept. 20th and Octo. 12th 1676.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the right honorable the Lords of his Majesties most honorable Privy Council appointed a committee for trade and plantations.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An answer to severall heads of enquiry concerning the present state of New-England.</HEAD>
<P>AND whereas amongst the severall colonies and plantations settled there that of the Massachusets bay, commonly called the corporation of Boston, is the most flourishing and powerfull, and at the present gives lawes to a great part of this country, by a pretended char∣ter from his late Majestie, it is first in relation to this colony most humbly answered. To the first enquiry.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="inquiry">
<HEAD>Where the legislative and executive powers of the government of New England are seated.</HEAD>
<P>The legislative power is seated in a generall court, from which there is no appeal, consisting at present of a gover∣nor, deputy governor and 10 magistrates, with the depu∣ties of the severall townes in that jurisdiction, all which are yearely elected.</P>
<P>This court is the supreme judicature of the colony, and only hath power to make lawes, raise money, and lay taxes upon the whole colony, dispose lands, give and confirme properties, impeach, sentence and pardon, and receave ap∣peals from all inferior courts, and cannot be adjourned or dissolved without the consent of the major part.</P>
<P>The governor, deputy governor and magistrates are chosen by the majority of the votes of the freemen of the colony, who are to attend at Boston, either in person or by proxy, without any summons, the last Wednesday in Easter terme, and upon that day to consummate the elec∣tion, which is done by writing the names in paper, but no

person that hath been a magistrate the year before is to be left out<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Left out of the nomination he intends.</NOTE> at the new election, and is to have the prece∣dency in nomination before all others.</P>
<P>The deputies for the generall court are chosen by the freemen of every towne, who have all the power of the freemen transferred to them. No town can send more than two deputies, and where a town hath but 20 freemen, that town can send but one deputy, and when not 10 freemen the town sends none; no person being an attor∣ney is to be chosen a deputy.</P>
<P>No person is admitted to be a freeman of the colony, or have vote in any election but church members who are in full communion and approved by the generall court.</P>
<P>The governor and magistrates sit apart and act all busi∣nesse by themselves, by drawing up bills and orders, which having agreed upon, they send to the deputies to be con∣sidered, and accordingly to give their consent or dissent thereunto.</P>
<P>The deputies likewise sit by themselves and consult a∣bout such matters as they shall find meet for the common good, which being agreed on they present to the magistrates to be considered, who may give their consent or dissent.</P>
<P>No law is made without the consent of the major part of the magistrates and the greater number of the deputies. The governor hath a casting vote in all courts and assem∣bles, can call a generall court, or any other court or council at his pleasure.</P>
<P>The executive power is in the governor and council, whereof seven men make a quorum, the governor or de∣puty governor to be one. But when businesse is urgent then the acts of so many as do assemble are accounted valid and sufficient, and can impresse soldiers, seamen, ships, all manner of ammunition and provision, and all other neces∣saries, and give warrant to the treasurer to make payment for the same.</P>
<P>The council sits twice a weeke constantly, and is sum∣moned at the pleasure of the governor, and oftner if need be.</P>
<P>There be two courts of assistants yearly kept at Boston
<PB N="479" REF="011300_0242_0F86CBAFFA8D1320"/>
by the governor, deputy governor and the rest of the ma∣gistrates, upon the first Tuesday in March and September, to hear and determine all actions of appeal from inferiour courts, and all capitall and criminall causes extending to life, member or banishment.</P>
<P>There are also county courts held in severall townes of the colony upon set dayes by such magistrates as the generall court shall appoint, for to heare and determine all causes civill and criminall, not extending to life, member or banishment. To make and constitute needfull officers, and to summon juries of inquest, tyme of holding said courts alwaies on Tuesdays.</P>
<P>The governor and deputy governor jointly agreeing, or any 3 magistrates consenting, have power to reprieve a condemned person till the next generall court.</P>
<P>Every magistrate is a justice of the peace, and can de∣termine any cause under 40<ABBR>s.</ABBR> can commit to prison and punish offenders for breach of lawes and impose fines according to discretion.</P>
<P>The secretary of the councill signes all warrants for the execution of persons, sitting the generall court or court of assistants.</P>
<P>The governor and magistrates at all courts, meetings and assemblies, have a publick table kept and their neces∣sary expences born at the charge of the country.</P>
<P>And for keeping all persons in perfect obedience to their authority, it is enacted, that whosoever shall revile the person of any magistrate or minister, or shall defame any court of justice or the sentence or proceedings of the same, or the judges of any such court in respect of any act or sentence therein passed, shall be punished by whipping, fine, imprisonment, disfranchisement or banishment, as the quality or measure of the offence shall deserve.</P>
<P>And whosoever shall conspire and attempt any invasion, insurrection, or publick rebellion against the common∣wealth, or shall endeavour to surprize any town or fort, or shall treacherously and perfidiously attempt the altera∣tion and subversion of the frame of pollicy or government fundamentall he shall be put to death.</P>
<P><PB N="480" REF="011300_0243_0F86CBB08085E170"/>And as a marke of soveraignty they coin mony stamped with inscription Mattachusets and a tree in the center, on the one side, and New England, with the year 1652 and the value of the piece, on the reverse. Their money is of the standard of England for finenesse, the shillings weigh three pennyweight troy, in value of English money nine-pence farthing, and the smaller coins proportionable. These are the current monies of the colony and not to be transported thence, except twenty shillings for necessary expences, on penalty of confiscation of the whole visible estate of the transporters.</P>
<P>All the money is stamped with these figures, 1652, that year being the aera of the commonwealth, wherein they erected themselves into a free state, enlarged their domi∣nions, subjected the adjacent colonies under their obedience, and summoned deputies to sit in the generall court, which year is still commemorated on their coin.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a misrepresentation. The first money of this impress being stamped in 1652 they never altered the date, altho' they stamped more annually for thirty years together.</NOTE></P>

<P>I John Leverett, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> governor of his Majesty's colony of the Massachusets in New-England, doe testify and make known that J. W. master or commander of the Sarah frigat hath appeared before me and delared by solemn oath that the said ship or vessel of which he is at present master or commander, containing about one hundred tons, doth belong to the inhabitants of the city of London, with∣in the dominions of his most serene and mighty prince the King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, defender of the faith. So help him God. And in regard it will be most acceptable unto me that the said master or comman∣der be assisted in his just and lawfull affairs, I doe request you and every of you, wheresoever the said master or commander shall arrive with his ship, and the goods laden on board and carryed in her, that you would be pleased to receave him courteously, use him kindly, and admit him upon paying the lawfull and usuall customes and other duties, to enter into, remain in, and passe from your port, river and dominions, and there to enjoy all kind of right of navigation, traffick and commerce, in all places where he shall thinke fit, which I shall most willingly and readily acknowledge upon all occasions. In testimony and con∣firmation whereof I have with my hand signed these pre∣sents, and caused them to be sealed with the public seal of the colony above-written. Dated in Boston, April 29, 1676, and 28th year of his Majesties reign.</P>

<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="inquiry">
<HEAD>Second Enquiry. What lawes and ordinances are now in force there derogatory or contrary to those of Eng∣land, and what oath is prescribed by the government?</HEAD>
<P>The lawes and ordinances made in that colony are no longer observed than as they stand with their conve∣nience.
<PB N="482" REF="011300_0244_0F86CBB701EFF4D8"/>
The magistrates not so strictly minding the letter of the law when their publick interest is concerned, in all cases more regarding the quality and affection of the persons to their government than the nature of their of∣fence. They see no evill in a church member, and there∣fore it is very difficult to get any sentence or verdict against him, tho' in the smallest matters.</P>
<P>No law is in force or esteeme there but such as are made by the generall court, and therefore it is accounted a breach of their privileges and a betraying of the liberties of their commonwealth to urge the observation of the lawes of England or his Majesties commands.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="laws">
<HEAD>The lawes most derogatory and contradictory to those of England.</HEAD>
<P>All persons of the age of 21 years, being excommuni∣cate or condemned, have liberty to make wills and dispose of lands and estates.</P>
<P>In capital cases, dismembering or banishment; where no law is made by the generall court, or in case of defect of a law in any particular case, the offender to be tryed by the word of God and be judged by the generall court.</P>
<P>Ministers are ordained by the people, and no injunc∣tion to be put upon any church officer or member, in point of doctrine, worship or discipline, whether for substance or circumstance, besides the institution of the Lord.</P>
<P>Whoever shall observe christmasse day, or the like festi∣vity, by forbearing to labour, feasting or other way shall pay 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> and whosoever shall not resort to their meeting up∣on the Lord's day and such days of fasting and Thanks∣giving as shall be appointed by authority, shall pay 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> no days commanded by the lawes of England to be observed or regarded.</P>
<P>No person shall be impressed or compelled to serve in any wars but such as shall be enterprized by that common∣wealth, by the consent of a generall court, or by authority derived from them.</P>
<P>No person whatsoever shall joine any persons in mar∣riage but a magistrate, it being an honorable ordinance and therefore should be accordingly sollemnized.</P>
<P><PB N="483" REF="011300_0244_0F86CBB701EFF4D8"/>All strangers professing the true christian religion that shall fly to them for succour from the tyranny or oppres∣sion of their persecutors, or for any necessary or compul∣sory cause, they shall be entertained and protected amongst them according to that power and prudence God shall give them. By which law Whalley and Goffe and other tray∣tors were kindly receaved and entertained by Mr. Gookins and other magistrates.</P>
<P>Whosoever shall be in the possession of any land 5 years, altho' the grant of said land was to another, and the posses∣sor have nothing to shew for the alienation thereof but his possession, the possessor shall have the land confirmed to him.</P>
<P>No oath shall be urged or required to be taken by any person but such oath as the generall court hath considered allowed and required.</P>
<P>The oaths of allegiance and supremacy are neither taken by the magistrates nor required to be taken by the inhabitants, only an oath of fidelity to the government is imposed upon all persons as well strangers as inhabitants, upon the penalty of 5<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> for every week they shall refuse the said oath.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Unless they gave security for their fidelity to the satisfaction of the court.</NOTE></P>

assistance thereunto with my person and estate as in equity I am bound; and will also truly endeavour and preserve and maintain all the liberties and privileges thereof, sub∣mitting myselfe unto the wholesome lawes made and esta∣blished by the same; and further, that I will not plot or practice any evil against it, or consent to any that shall so doe, but will truely discover and reveal the same to law∣ful authority now here established for the speedy prevent∣ing thereof.

<P>These and all other oaths are taken by holding up the hand and not by laying the hand upon the booke.</P>
</DIV4>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="inquiry">
<HEAD>Third Enquiry. What number of church members, freemen, inhabitants, planters, servants or slaves there are, of what profession and estates, and how many of them men able to bear armes?</HEAD>
<P>The magistrates and all other officers in the civil go∣vernment or in any place of profit or advantage are church members, and are consequently freemen, but the number of the church members and freemen compared with the rest of the inhabitants (who are termed the dissenting party) is very inconsiderable, not being reckoned above one sixth part; the most wealthy persons of all professions being men of good principles and well affected to his Majestie. It is nothing but interest and designe that draws most of the people into their church membership and to think well of that religion and government they thrive under.</P>
<P>The inhabitants within this government, including Hampshire and Main, are computed to be upwards of one hundred and fifty thousand souls.</P>
<P>The chief professions are merchants who are principally seated at Boston, Salem, Charlestown, and Portsmouth, and wealthy shop keepers or retailers, who dwell in most towns of the colony, and get good estates. There are rich men of all callings and professions, and all mechanical arts and occupations thrive well.</P>
<P>The farmers are numerous and wealthy, live in good houses, are given to hospitality, and make good advantage by their corn, cattle, poultry, butter and cheese.</P>
<P><PB N="485" REF="011300_0245_0F86CBB8DA6779C8"/>There are about 30 merchants that are esteemed worth from ten to twenty thousand pounds; most have considera∣ble estates and very great trades, and are an industrious and thriving people. There are no servants but upon hired wages, except some few who serve four yeares for the charge of being transported thither by their masters, and not above 200 slaves in the colony, and those are brought from Guinea and Madagascar.</P>
<P>There are men able to bear armes between 30 and 40,000 and in the town of Boston is computed about 4000.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is an extravagant computation.</NOTE></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="inquiry">
<HEAD>Fourth Enquiry. What number of horse and foot, and whether they be trained bands or standing forces, and what old and experienced officers they have amongst them?</HEAD>
<P>They have no standing army, but their trained bands are twelve troops of horse and six thousand foot; each troop consisting of 60 horse besides officers, are all well mounted and compleatly armed with back, breast, headpiece, buffe coat, sword, carbine and pistols, each troop distin∣guished by their coats. The foot also are very well fur∣nished with swords, muskets, and bandeliers. There are no pikemen, they being of no use in the warrs with the Indians. The late warrs have hardned their infantry, made them good firemen, and taught them the ready use of their armes. The pay in time of war to a captain of horse is 6<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> per month, to a captain of foot 4<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> to a com∣mon soldier one shilling a day besides victuals, and in time of peace the officers have an allowance for their expences upon the days of muster. The present governor Mr. Leverett is the only old soldier in the colony, he served in the late rebellion, under the usurper Oliver Cromwell, as a captain of horse. The governor of the colony is always generall, and out of the rest of the magistrates is chosen the major-generall; they are places of good profit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Governor never had more than £. 100 per annum. I never met with any allowance to a Major-General, and suppose he had none except in actual action.</NOTE> and no danger, they may stay at home and share the

</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="inquiry">
<HEAD>Fifth Enquiry. What castles and forts are in New-England, and how scituated, and what store of pro∣visions are they furnished withall?</HEAD>
<P>Three miles from Boston, upon a small island, there is a castle of stone lately built and in good repair, with four bastions and mounted with 38 guns, 16 whole culverin, commodiously seated upon a rising ground 60 paces from the water side, under which at high water marke is a small stone battery of 6 guns, these command all the vessels sail∣ing up and down the channel of Boston. There is six fathom water by the castle, and no good going up any other way. The present commander is one Capt. Clap, an old man, his salary 50<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> per ann. There belong to it six gunners, each 10<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> per ann. No soldiers are there, and seldom above the captain and one gunner, who upon sight of any vessel coming up set up his Majesties flag, the only demonstration of his Majesties authority in those parts, to which all vessels are to strike, and none are to saile out from Boston but they must send their passe to the captain, which is signed by the governor, for which is paid 10<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> and if it be a bill of health, 14<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> There is a small brick fort lately made at the south end of Boston, with two tyre of guns, 6 in each, as it is made it is of little use, no offi∣cers or soldiers belong to it. One platforme on the north side of the towne, commanding the river to Charlestown, made of loose stones and turfe, mounted with 5 demy cul∣verin, two small guns, no officers.</P>
<P>There is a small fort at Marblehead, upon a neck of land going up to the bay of Boston, but of little use.</P>
<P>And upon the western poynt of Great Island, at the mouth of the river of Pascataway, is a small fort in good repair, very commodiously seated and mounted with 5 guns, formerly built by John Mason, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> from this river come the masts and plankes for England. Every vessel above 20 tuns, not belonging to the inhabitants of that colony, payes, per tun, ½ pound of powder, or 9 pence in money, which amounts to a considerable stock.</P>
<P><PB N="487" REF="011300_0246_0F86CBB98140F7F8"/>There are in the publick stores commonly 1000 barrels of powder, with other ammunition and armes proportion∣able, besides 6000 small armes lately come from England.</P>
<P>At Dorchester, 7 miles from Boston, is a powder mill in good repair, well wrought. There is in the country great quantities of saltpeter, especially upon islands where foule frequent, and in swamps where pigeons roost. The powder is as good and strong as the best English powder; the master of the worke is one Eversden, formerly of Battles in Sussex.</P>
<P>Great guns have formerly been cast in the country, but none at present, the undertakers quarrelling among them∣selves, and so the workes fell.</P>
<P>There is great plenty of iron oare, and as good iron made as any in Spain. There are six forges for making of iron in that colony.</P>
<P>The town of Boston, the metropolis of the colony and the residence of the governor and councill is seated upon a peninsula, which with a small charge might be made very strong, being incompassed by the sea, except a small neck of land of 100 rods at low water, but not 20 at high. The town contains about 2000 houses, most built with tymber and covered with shingles of cedar, as are most of the houses in the country, some few are brick buildings and covered with tyles.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="inquiry">
<HEAD>Sixth Enquiry. What are the reputed boundaries and contents of land?</HEAD>
<P>The ancient bounds of the Massachusets colony was not above 20 miles upon the sea coast,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bounds of the colony upon the sea coast were never contro∣verted nor uncertain.</NOTE> but the present limits are as large as that government please to make them, having some years since taken in the two intire provinces of Hampshire and Mayne, by them, now called after other names and divided into 4 counties, Norfolk, Suffolk, Mid∣dlesex and Yorkshire, besides several considerable townes in the other colonies of New Plymouth and Connecticot; for the Massachusets, having the preheminence in trade,
<PB N="488" REF="011300_0247_0F86CBBA465B3E38"/>
strength and riches, take the liberty to clayme as farre as theire convenience and interest directs, never wanting a pretext of right to any place that is commodious for them, declaring they doe not know the boundaries of their commonwealth.</P>
<P>And tho' his Majesties commissioners, in the year 1665, did settle the limits of severall colonies, especially the pro∣vinces of Hampshire and Main, and declared to the in∣habitants that, by his Majesties commission and authority, they were taken off from the government of the Massa∣chusets, to the generall satisfaction and rejoycing of the people, and did constitute justices of the peace and other officers (with the approbation of the proprietors) to act and govern according to the lawes of England, and by such lawes of their owne as were not repugnant thereunto, un∣till his Majestie should take further order, whereupon his Majestie, by his declaration to the corporation of Boston<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He means the Massachusets Colony often called Boston Government.</NOTE> of the 10th of Aprill 1666, did approve of the actings and proceeding of his said commissioners, and did command that noe alteration should be made, either in the boundaries or government of those colonies, and that all determinations made by said commissioners should be observed and con∣tinue untill his Majestie should make his own finall deter∣mination, yet neverthelesse, noe sooner were his Ma∣jesties commissioners returned for England, but Mr. Leve∣ret, the present governor, Mr. Ting and Capt. Pike, and some others entred these provinces in an hostile manner, with horse and foot, and subverted the government there settled by the commissioners, imprisoned severall persons, and compelled the inhabitants to submit to their usurpa∣tions. And thus taking all opportunities and advantages to improve their dominions and authority, the jurisdiction of the Massachusets is swelled into a very large territory.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="inquiry">
<HEAD>Seventh Enquiry. What correspondence doe they keep with their neighbours the French, and the government of New Yorke?</HEAD>
<P>The French, upon the last treaty of peace concluded between the two crowns of England and France, had Nova
<PB N="489" REF="011300_0247_0F86CBBA465B3E38"/>
Scotia, now called Acadie, delivered up to them, to the great discontent and murmuring of the government of Boston, that his Majestie, without their knowledge or consent, should part with a place so profitable to them, from whence they drew great quantities of beaver and other peltry, besides the fishing for cod. Neverthelesse, the people of Boston have continued a private trade with the French and Indians inhabiting those parts, for beaver-skins and other commodities, and have openly kept on their fishing upon the said coast, tho' often<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Something is wanting to make out the sense.</NOTE> by the French Kings lieftenant in Acadie last year.</P>
<P>Monsieur La Bourn, governor for the French King there, upon pretence, of some affronts and injuries offered him by the government of Boston, did strictly inhibit the inhabitants any trade with the English, and moreover layd an imposition of 400 codfish upon every vessel that should fish upon the coasts, and such as refused had their fish and provisions seized on and taken away.</P>
<P>The French have held a civill correspondence with the inhabitants of Hampshire and Main and Dukes province, tho' the government of Boston, on all occasions, is impo∣sing upon the French, and encouraging an interloping trade, which causes jealousies and feares in the inhabitants bordering upon Acadie, that the French will, some tyme or other, suddainly fall upon them, to the breach of the nationall peace. The government of the Massachusets hath a perfect hatred for the French, because of their too near neighbourhood, and losse of their trade, and looke upon them with an evill eye, beleeving they have had a hand in the late warre with the Indians.</P>
<P>As for New Yorke, there were severall things in mat∣ter of trade which occasioned a difference between the two governments, which at length role so high that it came to a stop of trade, the governor of New Yorke not permitting any European goods to be imported into that colony from Boston, that had not certificate or other sufficient proof to have paid custom in England, which hath ever since occa∣sioned a misunderstanding between them.</P>
<P><PB N="490" REF="011300_0248_0F86CBBB05409EA8"/>In the late Indian warre, the government of Boston did greatly complain of fort Albany, that from thence the In∣dians were supplied with armes and ammunition, and were incouraged to begin and prosecute the warre, but this great outcry is judged by the wiser and sober sort of people to be without any just cause, but rather a report raised out of malice and envy; for the government of the Massachu∣sets love no government that is not like their own, and therefore they were more kind and friendly to the Dutch (even in tyme of warre) when they were possessed of New Yorke, than they are to their countrymen the English. However, the governor of New Yorke hath proved very serviceable to the Massachusets in this warre, and had the magistrates of Boston either conferred with or hearkened to the advice of Colonel Andross, the Indian warre had either been diverted or proved lesse destructive; for he offered and would have engaged the Mowhawkes and Maquot Indians to have falled upon the Sachem Philip and his confederates, but his friendly advice and offers were slighted.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I never met with any evidence of this.</NOTE> Neverthelesse, Colonel Andross, out of his duty to his Majestie, kept the aforesaid Indians from taking any part with the Sachim Philip.</P>

<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="inquiry">
<HEAD>Eighth Enquiry. What hath been the originall cause of the present warre with the natives. What are the advantages or disadvantages arising thereby and will probably be the End?</HEAD>
<P>Various are the reports and conjectures of the causes of the present Indian warre. Some impute it to an imprudent zeal in the magistrates of Boston to christianize those hea∣then before they were civilized and injoyning them the strict observation of their lawes, which, to a people so rude and licentious, hath proved even intollerable, and that the more, for that while the magistrates, for their profit, put the lawes severely in execution against the Indians, the people, on the other side, for lucre and gain, intice and provoke the Indians to the breach thereof, especially to drunkennesse, to which those people are so generally ad∣dicted that they will strip themselves to their skin to have
<PB N="491" REF="011300_0248_0F86CBBB05409EA8"/>
their fill of rume and brandy, the Massachusets having made a law that every Indian drunke should pay 10<ABBR>s.</ABBR> or be whipped, according to the discretion of the magistrate. Many of these poor people willingly offered their backe to the lash to save their money; whereupon, the magi∣strates finding much trouble and no profit to arise to the government by whipping, did change that punishment into 10 dayes worke for such as could not or would not pay the fine of 10<ABBR>s.</ABBR> which did highly incense the Indians.</P>
<P>Some beleeve there have been vagrant and jesuiticall priests, who have made it their businesse, for some yeares past, to goe from Sachim to Sachim, to exasperate the In∣dians against the English and to bring them into a confe∣deracy, and that they were promised supplies from France and other parts to extirpate the English nation out of the continent of America. Others impute the cause to some injuries offered to the Sachim Philip; for he being posses∣sed of a tract of land called Mount Hope, a very fertile, pleasant and rich soyle, some English had a mind to dis∣possesse him thereof, who never wanting one pretence or other to attain their end, complained of injuries done by Philip and his Indians to their stock and cattle, whereup∣on Philip was often summoned before the magistrate, sometimes imprisoned, and never released but upon part∣ing with a considerable part of his land.</P>
<P>But the government of the Massachusets (to give it in their own words) do declare these are the great evills for which God hath given the heathen commission to rise against them: The wofull breach of the 5th command∣ment, in contempt of their authority, which is a sin highly provoking to the Lord: For men wearing long hayre and perewigs made of womens hayre; for women wearing borders of hayre and for cutting, curling and laying out the hayre, and disguising themselves by following strange fashions in their apparell: For profanesse in the people not frequenting their meetings, and others going away before the blessing be pronounced: For suffering the Quakers to live amongst them and to set up their thresh∣holds

by Gods thresholds, contrary to their old lawes and resolutions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Massa. History, Vol. I. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>21.</NOTE></P>
<P>With many such reasons, but whatever be the cause, the English have contributed much to their misfortunes, for they first taught the Indians the use of armes, and ad∣mitted them to be present at all their musters and train∣ings, and shewed them how to handle, mend and fix their muskets, and have been furnished with all sorts of armes by permission of the government, so that the Indians are become excellent firemen. And at Natick there was a gathered church of praying Indians, who were exercised as trained bands, under officers of their owne; these have been the most barbarous and cruel enemies to the English of any others. Capt. Tom, their leader, being lately taken and hanged at Boston, with one other of their chiefs.</P>
<P>That notwithstanding the ancient law of the country, made in the year 1633, that no person should sell any armes or ammunition to any Indian upon penalty of 10<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> for every gun, 5<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> for a pound of powder, and 40<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> for a pound of shot, yet the government of the Massachusets in the year 1657, upon designe to monopolize the whole Indian trade did publish and declare that the trade of furrs and peltry with the Indians in their jurisdiction did solely and properly belong to their commonwealth and not to every indifferent person, and did enact that no per∣son should trade with the Indians for any sort of peltry, except such as were authorized by that court, under the penalty of 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> for every offence, giving liberty to all such as should have licence from them to sell, unto any Indian, guns, swords, powder and shot, paying to the trea∣surer 3<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> for each gun and for each dozen of swords; 6<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> for a pound of powder and for every ten pound of shot, by which means the Indians have been abundantly fur∣nished with great store of armes and ammunition to the utter ruin and undoing of many families in the neighbour∣ing colonies to inrich some few of their relations and church members.</P>
<P><PB N="493" REF="011300_0249_0F86CBBBC030F340"/>No advantage but many disadvantages have arisen to the English by the warre, for about 600 men have been slaine, and 12 captains, most of them brave and stout per∣sons and of loyal principles, whilest the church members had liberty to stay at home and not hazard their persons in the wildernesse.</P>
<P>The losse to the English in the severall colonies, in their habitations and stock, is reckoned to amount to 150,000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> there having been about 1200 houses burned, 8000 head of cattle, great and small, killed, and many thousand bushels of wheat, pease and other grain burned (of which the Massachusets colony hath not been damnifyed one third part, the great losse falling upon New Plymouth and Connecticot colonies)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Randolph shews his malice against the Massachusets in this mis∣representation for Connecticut suffered but little by the war, and the Massachusets lost more of their substance as well as of their inhabitants than both the other colonies together.</NOTE> and upward of 3000 Indians men women and children destroyed, who if well managed would have been very serviceable to the English, which makes all manner of labour dear.</P>
<P>The warre at present is near an end. In Plymouth colony the Indians surrender themselves to Gov. Winslow, upon mercy, and bring in all their arms, are wholly at his disposall, except life and transportation; but for all such as have been notoriously cruell to women and children, so soon as discovered they are to be executed in the sight of their fellow Indians.</P>
<P>The government of Boston have concluded a peace upon these termes.</P>
<P N="1">1. That there be henceforward a firme peace between the Indians and English.</P>
<P N="2">2. That after publication of the articles of peace by the generall court, if any English shall willfully kill an Indian, upon due proof, he shall dye, and if an Indian kill an Englishman and escape, the Indians are to produce him, and he to passe tryall by the English lawes.</P>
<P>That the Indians shall not conceal any known enemies to the English, but shall discover them and bring them to the English.</P>
<P><PB N="494" REF="011300_0250_0F86CBBEF15E1F60"/>That upon all occasions the Indians are to ayd and assist the English against their enemies, and to be under English command.</P>

<HEAD>Ninth Enquiry. What are the commodities of the pro∣duction, growth and manufacture of the country, and what are those imported from other places, and par∣ticularly how the trade and navigation is carryed on, whether directly to and from England or otherwise, what number of ships do trade thither yearly, and of what burthen they are, and where built; and lastly, what notice is taken of the act of navigation?</HEAD>
<P>The commodities of the production, growth and ma∣nufacture of New England are, all things necessary for shipping and naval furniture in great abundance, as excel∣lent oake, elme, beech, firre, pines for masts the best in the world, pitch, tarre, hempe, and iron not inferior to that of Bilboa, clapboards, pipe staves, plankes and deal∣boards, so that his Majestie need not be beholding to other nations for naval stores.</P>
<P>It abounds with horses, beefes, sheep, hogs and goats, with mighty numbers of wild beasts, as beaver, otter, moose, deer, stags, foxes, musquash, and severall other sorts, whose skins produce great profit yearly. Also great plenty of wheat, rye, barley, oats and pease, fruits of most kinds, especially apples, whereof they make great quantities of excellent cider. Fish of all sorts, especially cod, mackarell and herring, which are very large and fat. These are the staple commodities and are exported.</P>
<P>To Virginia, Jamaica and Maryland, beef and porke salted, pease, flower, bisket and mault, coddfish and salt mackarell.</P>
<P>To Barbados, Nevis, St. Christopher and the other islands, the above commodities, together with horses, deal∣boards, pipestaves, and houses ready framed.</P>
<P>To Spain, Portugall and the Straights, Maderas and Canary islands, fish and timber, pipestaves and dealboards.</P>
<P><PB N="495" REF="011300_0250_0F86CBBEF15E1F60"/>To England, masts and yards for ships, firre and oake plankes, with all sorts of peltry.</P>
<P>The commodities imported from the plantations are tobacco, sugar, indico, cotton wool, ginger, logwood, fustick, cocao and rume, the which are again transported to other parts.</P>
<P>The trade and navigation is carried on by a generall traffick to most parts of Europe, as England, Scotland, Ireland, Spain, France, Portugall, Holland, Canaries, and the Hans townes, carrying to each place such commodities as are vendible, either of their own growth and manufac∣ture or those of the other plantations, and doe make their returns in such goods as are necessary and vendible either in New England, or in any other of his Majesties domi∣nions in America; as brandy, Canary, Spanish and French wines, bullion, salt, fruits, oyles, silkes, laces, linnen of all sorts, cloath, serges, bayes, kersies, stockings, and many other commodities, which they distribute into all parts of the West-Indies; so that there is little left for the mer∣chants residing in England to import into any of the plan∣tations, those of New-England being able to afford their goods much cheaper than such who pay the customes and are laden in England. By which meanes this kingdome hath lost the best part of the western trade, there being very little exported hence but only such commodities as are properly the product and manufacture of England and cannot be had in other parts.</P>
<P>It is the great care of the merchants to keep their ships in constant imploy, which makes them trye all ports to force a trade, whereby they abound with all sorts of com∣modities, and Boston may be esteemed the mart town of the West Indies.</P>
<P>There are some ships lately sent to Guinea, Madagascar and those coasts, and some to Scanderoon, laden with masts and yards for ships.</P>
<P>There are severall vessels yearly built there and sold in England and other parts, which they build very cheap.</P>

<P>The ecclesiasticall government is in the hands of lay-elders, these being the lawes and constitutions.</P>
<P>No person is permitted to gather a church without the approbation of three of the magistrates and the elders of the neighbour churches.</P>
<P>Every church hath liberty of election and ordination of officers and ministers to exercise all the ordinances of God, according to the rules of the scripture. To cele∣brate daies of fasting, prayer and thankesgiving, according to the word of God. No injunction to be put upon any church, church officer, or member in point of doctrine, worship or discipline, whether for substance or circum∣stance, besides the institution of the Lord. Hath liberty of admission, recommendation, dismission and expulsion of their officers and members, with free exercise of the disci∣pline and censures of Christ, according to the rules of the word.</P>
<P><PB N="501" REF="011300_0253_0F86CD0AD4A75A80"/>The civill authority hath power to see the peace, or∣dinances and rules of Christ observed in every church and to deal with any church member, in a way of civill justice, notwithstanding any church relation, office or interest.</P>
<P>No church censure shall degrade or depose any man from any civill dignity, office or authority he shall have in the commonwealth.</P>
<P>Whosoever shall interrupt any minister in his preaching or charging him with any error he hath not taught, shall pay five pounds.</P>
<P>The ministry in Boston are payd by a collection weekly made in the severall congregations, by the elders, who give the minister what they think fit; but in other towns they have a settled maintenance by a rate layd on every inha∣bitant, and houses are provided for them.</P>
<P>There are three colledges built in Cambridge, one with timber at the charge of Mr. Harvard and bears his name; a small brick building called the Indian colledge, where some few Indians did study, but now it is a printing house; new-colledge, built at the publick charge, is a fair pile of brick building covered with tiles, by reason of the late Indian warre not yet finished. It contains 20 chambers for students, two in a chamber; a large hall, which serves for a chappel; over that a convenient library, with some few bookes of the ancient fathers and school divines, but in regard divinity is the generall study, there are many English bookes of the late non-conformist writers, espe∣cially of Mr. Baxter and Dr. Owen. Here they teach Hebrew before they well understand Latin. No forma∣lities or distinctions of habits, or other decencies, as in England, much lesse these exhibitions and supports for schollars. They take no degrees above master of arts.</P>
<P>Their commencement, kept yearly the 2d of August, in the meeting-house, where the governor and magistrates are present, attended with throngs of illiterate elders and church members, who are entertained with English speeches and verses. Most of the students are come for England, and at present no settled president, but one Mr.

Oakes, a rigid independent, supplies the place. The al∣lowance of the president is 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> per ann. and a good house. There are but 4 fellowships, the two seniors have each 30<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> per ann. and the two juniors 15<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> but no diet is al∣lowed: These are tutors to all such as are admitted stu∣dents. Mr. Thomas Graves, an ingenious and worthy person, was put by his fellowship, by the late Dr. Hoar, because he would not renounce the church of England. The government of these colledges is in the governor and magistrates of the Massachusets and the president of the colledge, together with the teaching elders of the six adjacent towns.</P>
<P>As to the colonies of New-Plymouth and Connecticot, it is humbly offered.</P>
<P>The lawes of England are there observed with such of their own as are not contradictory thereunto. The oath of allegiance is taken by every magistrate and officer, whe∣ther civill or military, and by all freemen. All com∣missions, proclamations, writs and summons are in his Majesties name.</P>
<P>The number of inhabitants in both colonies are computed to be 80000 soules. There are noe slaves, only hired servants. The chief professions are farmers, grasiers and fishermen. Very few merchants, they being supplied with all forreign commodities from Boston.</P>
<P>The militia consists of 4 troops of horse and 5 regiments of foot, who are well armed and disciplined, no old soldiers among them. The number fit to bear armes 20000.</P>
<P>The country is very fertile and pleasant and abounds in corn and cattle, and produceth very good horses, the best in all N. E. which are sent into severall parts. There is great abundance of tarre and excellent good hemp, and there is made good quantity of whale oyle, which fish they take upon the coasts. The act of navigation is duely ob∣served. No stranger is admitted to come into their ports. They have no ships of burthen, but only small ketches and barkes, to trade along the coasts and take fish.</P>
<P><PB N="503" REF="011300_0254_0F86CD0C167D4360"/>They are generally very loyall and good people, and doe upon all occasions expresse great love to the person and government of his Majestie, and doe heartily wish that his Majesties authority were established over the whole country.</P>
<P>The present governor of New Plymouth is Josiah Winslow, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a person eminently popular and beloved in all the colonies of N. E. and was generall of the united forces against the Indians.</P>
<P>The governor of Connecticot is Wm. Leet, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a very worthy person, as are most of the magistrates of that colony.</P>
<P>The losses which these colonies have sustayned by the Indian warre is estimated to be near 100,000 pound.</P>
<P>This is (may it please your Lordships) the best account I have been able to gather, during my short stay in those parts, as well from my own observation as from the information of others.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A short narrative touching the delivery of your Majesties letters to the magistrates of Boston in New-England, by Edward Randolph.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Majestie,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING receaved your Majesties letters for the go∣vernor and magistrates of your Majesties town of Boston in N. E. dated 20th of March last, with my parti∣cular instructions from the right hon. Mr. secretary Co∣ventry, upon the 30th of the sayd month I sayled from the Downes. After a tedious passage of 10 weeks arrived at Boston on 10th June. At my landing I went immedi∣ately to the governor John Leveret, and shewed him your
<PB N="504" REF="011300_0255_0F86CD0C7A500A20"/>
Majesties passe and acquainted him with the cause of my coming, and that I had brought a letter from his Majestie unto the magistrates of that colony, and did therefore de∣sire him that, with what convenient speed might be, the magistrates might be assembled to hear your Majesties letter read. The governor answered, that the council was to meet that afternoon, upon other businesse, and that then I should be sent for; as I was, by the marshall of their court; where being come and admitted into the councill, I delivered your Majesties letters to the governor, there being six of the magistrates and their secretary assembled with him, and there being a chaire placed purposely for me, I was desired by the governor to sitt.</P>
<P>The governor having opened your Majesties letter sayd to the rest of the magistrates, it was a letter from your Majestie, and looking to the bottom of the letter, he read by his Majesties command Hen. Coventry. The gover∣nor asked me who that Mr. Coventry was. I told him he was your Majesties principall secretary of state.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the reading of your Majesties let∣ter, the whole councill being covered, I put off my hat; whereupon three of the magistrates tooke off their hats and sate uncovered; but the governor with the rest con∣tinued to keep their hats on.</P>
<P>Your Majesties letters, with the inclosed petitions of Mr. Mason and Mr. Gorges, being read in my hearing, the governor told the councill that the matters therein contained were very inconsiderable things and easily an∣swered, and it did no way concern that government to take any notice thereof. I acquainted them that your Majestie had commanded me to require an answer of your sayd letters, and for which your Majestie had ordered me one month to attend. The governor answered, that they should consider of those things. Whereupon I withdrew.</P>
<P>Then I delivered the particular letters of Mr. Mason, which he had writt unto severall of the most eminent in∣habitants of Boston, some whereof are the principall offi∣cers of the militia. These gentlemen receaved me with
<PB N="505" REF="011300_0255_0F86CD0C7A500A20"/>
much kindnesse and expressed great loyalty to your Ma∣jestie. The letters he wrote were to give them an account of the contents of your Majesties letters, his own com∣plaints against the proceedings of that government, with the occasion of my coming into these parts, desiring them to communicate the same to others, the which was soon spread abroad, to the great pleasure and satisfaction of all those who are well-wishers to your Majestie.</P>
<P>Within a day or two after my arrivall, I met with a report which seemed artificially raysed to amuse and di∣stract the people about domestique troubles here in Eng∣land, the sume whereof was, that the Duke of Yorke, with diverse of the nobility, upon discontent, had left the court, and had applied themselves to the citty for assistance, and that all was going to confusion at home. This was re∣ported with much confidence, and sayd to be writt from some very good people in London, and therefore must be true. I soon confuted this report, by many arguments, shewing them the falsenesse of it, and so in a short tyme it vanished.</P>
<P>After two days consideration it was resolved in their councell that thankes be returned to your Majestie for your gracious letter, and that an answer be forthwith sent by a master of a vessel ready to saile for London.</P>
<P>The 15th of June I was sent for to the councell. The governour asked me whether I intended for London by that ship that was ready to saile, if so I should have a du∣plicate of their letter to your Majestie, the originall being to accompany his own particular answer to a letter he had receaved from Mr. secretary Williamson by the same master of the ship I came with. I told them I had other matters of concern under my charge, and should not return so soon, and withall asked them if they had well con∣sidered of his Majesties letter and the inclosed petition in so short a time, and concluded on their agents and the time of their going for England, to which they gave me no reply, but the governour asked me if I had any thing fur∣ther to offer them from your Majestie, I told them I had
<PB N="506" REF="011300_0256_0F86CD13883EF640"/>
nothing further to communicate to them, whereupon the governor said that he looked upon me as Mr. Mason's agent, and that I might withdraw.</P>
<P>The day after, I went to visit the governour at his house, and among other discourse I told him I tooke notice of severall ships that were arrived at Boston, some since my being there, from Spain, France, Streights, Canaries and other parts of Europe, contrary to your Majesties lawes for encouraging navigation, and regulating the trade of the plantations. He freely declared to me that the lawes made by your Majestie and your parliament obligeth them in nothing but what consists with the interest of that colony, that the legislative power is and abides in them solely to act and make lawes by virtue of a charter from your Ma∣jesties royall father, and that all matters in difference are to be concluded by their finall determination, without any appeal to your Majestie, and that your Majestie ought not to retrench their liberties, but may enlarge them if your Majestie please, and said, your Majestie had confirmed their charter and all their privileges by your Majesties letter of the 28th of June 1662, and that your Majesty could doe no lesse in reason than let them enjoy their liberties and trade, they having upon their own charge and without any contribution from the crown made so large plantation in the wildernesse, and that during the Dutch warrs your Majestie sent ammunition to New-Yorke for that place, but sent them word they must shift for themselves and make the best defence they could, and that notwithstand∣ing the colony had many enemies, yet they did believe your Majestie to be their very good friend, for that your Majestie had by severall letters expressed your great kind∣nesse to them.</P>
<P>Within a few days after I met with one Mr. Harris, a gentleman who arrived there from England about six months before, who told me that at his arrival at Boston, he was, according to their law, conducted to the governor, which enjoins all masters of vessels to bring all passengers to the governor upon penalty of 20<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> who enquiring of
<PB N="507" REF="011300_0256_0F86CD13883EF640"/>
him if he knew Mr. Mason and whether he was coming over and what commissioners were coming with him, Mr. Harris told him there was a report that Mr Mason was to come over. The governor then said he had re∣ceaved information from England that commissioners had come over last summer or the spring, but that your Majes∣tie had not money to defrey that charge and set them forth, and did therefore beleave no commissioners would come.</P>
<P>The 23d June I gave in a memoriall to the governour, the councill being then assembled at his house, wherein I acquainted them that in pursuance of my instructions I did remind then of your Majesties command of sending over agents that might be sufficiently qualified and im∣powered, and did desire that seeing a generall court seemed much more proper for dispatch of matters of so great and weighty concerns, that a generall court might on this oc∣casion be assembled, that so I might receave their delibe∣rate and solemn answer to your Majesties letters, for the which I would attend. But hereunto they gave me no other answer then that when I was ready to saile for Eng∣land I should have a coppy of their letter which they had writ unto your Majestie.</P>
<P>About the beginning of July, I went into the province of New-Hampshire, belonging unto Mr. Mason, but now divided by the Bostoneers into three counties, and by them called Norfolk, Suffolk and Middlesex. And travailed through severall of the most considerable towns, acquaint∣ing the inhabitants with the occasion of my coming into the country, and read Mr. Mason's letter unto them, which gave them great satisfaction, the whole country complaining of the oppression and usurpation of the magistrates of Boston, imposing ministers upon them, not admitting them to the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, denying baptism to their children, and liberty of choosing their own magistrates and officers because they were not members of their con∣gregations. And as a farther marke of their power and sovereignty over them they send twice a year magistrates from Boston to keep courts for trying of causes, and that
<PB N="508" REF="011300_0257_0F86CD1513F6E2B8"/>
they lay at pleasure what impositions, fines and taxes they thinke fit upon their estates, persons and trade, contrary to the lawes of England, and that they have been for a long time earnestly expecting to be delivered from the govern∣ment of the Massachusets Bay, and doe now humbly hope your Majestie will not permitt them any longer to be op∣pressed, but will be graciously pleased to give them relief, according to the promises made them by your Majesties commissioners in 1665, who were then in that province, and declared them not to be under the government of Boston.</P>
<P>And being at Portsmouth, a town of very great trade, lying upon the river of Piscataway, in the northermost part of New-Hampshire, about seventy miles from Boston, severall of the principall inhabitants of the province of Main, belonging unto Mr. Gorges, and now by the Bos∣toneers, since the seizing thereof, called Yorkshire, came unto me making the same complaints, with those of New-Hampshire, entreating me to represent their condition to your Majestie and are passionately expecting relief, some of them having been suffered to be ruined by the Indians for having formerly expressed their duty to your Majestie when your Majesties commissioners were in that country, and for having taken commissions from them to act as justices of the peace.</P>
<P>At my return to Boston I receaved a message from Josiah Winslow, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> governor of your Majesties colony of New-Plymouth, desiring I would give him a visit before I left New-England. Whereupon I made a journey to him, whome I found a gentleman of loyal principles and hath shewed himself a person of great courage and conduct in the management of the Indian warre, those barbarous people being chiefly overcome by his conduct and troops, which makes him to be feared and not loved by his neigh∣bours the Bostoners.</P>
<P>In his discourse he expressed his great dislike of the carriage of the magistrates of Boston to your Majesties royall person and your subjects under their government;
<PB N="509" REF="011300_0257_0F86CD1513F6E2B8"/>
of their incroaching upon the rights, trades and possessions of the neighbouring colonies, laying what rates they please on the commodities and products of the other colonies imported into their harbours; the dayly breach of your Majesties lawes concerning trade and navigation, trading with and incouraging all nations so trade with them, to the great prejudice and detrement of your Majestie and this your kingdom: And that he, finding the inconve∣niences of a divided government dayly arising, did say, that New-England could never be secure, flourish, nor be ser∣viceable to your Majestie, untill the severall colonies and plantations were reduced under your Majesties immediate government, and that the colonies of New-Plymouth and Connecticot would readily and willingly submitt to your Majesties pleasure and commands in the disposall and set∣tlement of the civill government.</P>
<P>That during my stay at Boston I made acquaintance with severall of the chief inhabitants and some of the magistrates, and did particularly informe myself of the humour, disposition and affections of the people, and found the principal inhabitants, some whereof are the chief offi∣cers of the militia, and the generality of the people com∣plaining of the arbitrary government and oppression of their magistrates and doe hope your Majestie will be pleased to free them from this bondage by establishing your own royall authority among them and govern them according to your Majesties lawes. And many of the better sort did intreat me to represent this their condition to your Majestie, not daring publickly to expresse their desires or complaint by petition, because of the severity and arbitrary proceeding of their rulers, and that many of them have been sufferers for petitioning formerly. Altho' at the general court in Octob. 1666, upon occasion of your Majesties letter and declaration of the 10th Aprill in the said year, which petition was subscribed by upwards of 100 of the principall inhabitants of that colony, wherein they did assert your Mejesties right of jurisdiction and so∣veraignty over them, a copy whereof is hereunto annexed,
<PB N="510" REF="011300_0258_0F86CD16B1EA9850"/>
being given me by some of the chief persons that had sub∣scribed it, desiring that your Majestie might see the same; these gentlemen soe delivering this petition, did then re∣ceave a severe check, the petition voted scandalous, they stiled the betrayers of the libertyes of that colony and ill-affected to that government, for which some of them have been greatly prejudiced in their estates and fortunes, and still lye under many inconveniences, and are not admitted into any offices of the government or choyce of the ma∣gistrates.</P>
<P>Being ready to return for England, the tyme allotted by your Majestie being expired, I went to the governor on the 20th July, for my dispatches, and was entertained by him with a sharp reproof for publishing the substance of my errand into those parts, contained in your Majesties letters, as alsoe in Mr. Masons petition and what he re∣presented to his friends there, with that of Mr. Gorges unto the inhabitants of Boston, New-Hampshire and Main, telling me that I designed to make a mutiny and distur∣bance in the country and to withdraw the people from their obedience to the magistracy of that colony and the authority thereof. I told him, if I had done any thing amisse, upon complaint made to your Majestie he would certainly have justice done him.</P>
<P>The governor then gave me the duplicate of a letter directed unto the right honorable Mr. Secretary Coven∣try, which he told me was the answer which the councill thought fit to give to your Majesties letters, the originall being sent for England a month before.</P>
<P>At my departure from him, both he and some of the magistrates, severally, intreated me to give a favourable report of the country and the magistrates thereof, adding, that those that blessed them God would blesse, and those that cursed them God would curse. And withall, desired me to acquaint your Majestie that whatever reports were raysed against them, by wicked and evill minded men, to draw away your Majesties grace and favour from them, yet they were a people truely fearing the Lord and very obe∣dient to your Majestie.</P>
<P><PB N="511" REF="011300_0258_0F86CD16B1EA9850"/>So that altho' by your Majesties command I was sent to the magistrates of Boston, and was named in your royall letters as one who should sollicit a fit determi∣nation in the businesse depending, and bring back the answer thereof, yet I must wholly refer myself to their own answer, they not having thought fit to acquaint me with the contents thereof.</P>

<HEAD>To the honored generall court now assembled in Boston.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please this honored court,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR humble petitioners being informed that letters are lately sent from his Majestie to the governor and councill, expressing his ill resentment of the proceedings of this colony with his commissioners lately sent hither, and requiring also some persons therein particularly nam∣ed, with command upon their allegiance, to attend his Ma∣jesties pleasure, in order to a final determination of such differences and debates as have happened between his Ma∣jesties sayd commissioners and the government here; which declaration of his Majestie your petitioners looking at as a matter of the greatest importance and justly calling for more serious consideration, that they might neither be wanting to yourselves in withholding any incouragement that their concurrence might afford in so arduous a mat∣ter, nor to themselves and the country being involved by their silence, in the dangerous mistakes of some persons (tho' otherwise well-minded) inclining to disloyal princi∣ples, they desire they may have liberty, without offence, to propose some of their thoughts and fears about that matter unto your most serious consideration.</P>
<P>Your petitioners humbly conceave that they who live in this age of the world are not lesse than others concerned in that advice of the wiseman, to keep the kings com∣mandment, and that because of the oath of God, and not to be hasty to goe out of his sight that doth whatsoever
<PB N="512" REF="011300_0259_0F86CD17000DAFE8"/>
pleaseth him. Wherefore they desire that seeing his Ma∣jestie hath already taken no little displeasure against us as if we disowned his Majesties jurisdiction over us, effectual care may be taken lest by refusing to attend his Majesties orders for clearing pretences unto right favour in that particular, we should plunge ourselves into greater dis∣favour and danger.</P>
<P>The receaving a charter from his Majesties royall pre∣decessor for the planting of this colony, with a confirma∣tion of the same from his royal person, by our late addresse sufficiently declare this place to be part of his dominions, and ourselves his subjects, in testimony of which also our first governour Mr. Mathew Cradock, as we are informed, stands recorded <HI>juratus de fide &amp; obedientiâ</HI> before one of the masters of chancery, whence it is evident that if any proceedings of this colony have given occasion to his Ma∣jestie to say that we beleave he hath no jurisdiction over us, what effectual course had need be taken to free our∣selves from incuring his Majesties farther displeasure, by continuing in so dangerous an offence, and to give his Majestie all due satisfaction in that point? Such an asser∣tion would be no lesse destructive to our welfare than de∣rogatory to his Majesties honour. The doubtful interpre∣tation of the words of a patent, which there can be no reason to beleeve can ever be construed to the divesting of a soveraign prince of his royall power over his naturall subjects and liege people, is too frail a foundation to build such a transcendent immunity and privilege upon.</P>
<P>Your petitioners shall ever be willing to acknowledge to the utmost how much they are bound to yourselves and others in the like capacity for your abundant care and paines in carrying on they government of this colony and endeavouring to uphold the liberties thereof, and should not be unwilling to run any hazard with you for the re∣gular defence and security of the same, and would be most unwilling to reflect upon the persons of them they so much honour and respect, by a necessary dissenting from them in some things wherein they could not approve the
<PB N="513" REF="011300_0259_0F86CD17000DAFE8"/>
reasons of their proceedings, but in matters of so great concernment as that now in agitation, wherein the honour of God, the credit of religion, as well as the interest of our own persons and estates are all concerned.</P>
<P>They earnestly desire, that no party will so irresistably carry on any design of so dangerous consequence as to ne∣cessitate their brethren, equally engaged with them in the same undertaking, to make a particular addresse to his Majestie and declaration to the world to clear themselves from the least imputation of so scandalous an evill, as the appearance of disaffection, or disloyalty to the person and government of their lawfull prince and soveraign would be.</P>
<P>Wherefore your petitioners doe humbly intreat, that if any occasion hath been given unto his Majestie so to re∣sent any of your former actions, as in his last letter is held forth, that nothing of that nature be further proceeded in, but contrawise that application be made to his Majestie by meet persons immediately to be sent for that end, to clear the transactions of them that govern this colony from any such construction, least otherwise that, which duly im∣proved, might have been as a cloud of the latter rain, be turned into that which in the conclusion may be more ter∣rible than the roaring of a lyon.</P>
<P>Thus craving a favourable interpretation of what is here humbly presented, your petitioners shall ever be obliged to thankefullnesse.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>This petition was signed by upwards of an hundred of the principal inhabitants of the Massachusets colony, and presented by them to the generall court at their meeting in Boston in October 1666, upon occasion of his Majesties declaration of the 10th of April in the same year.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This I have no doubt is a true copy of a petition which appears by the records to have been presented to the general court and, if it had been presented twenty years before, the court would have made the petitioners smart for their intermeddling, as they did Child and others.

<SALUTE>Ever honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE comes with this another letter to yourselfe from mee, which Mr. Rawson will give you, with that which your committee here for the colledge hath sent to the overseers. There is one Mr. Smith, I think his name is soe, an expert surveyor, who hath built forty of these famous houses in London, though he be a stranger to myselfe, yet hath the commendations of eminent mini∣sters for his goodnes, besides some of the chiefe workmen in the city for his ability in his calling. If you make use of him about the colledge, you may doe well to pay his passage, or as you please; I have agreed with him for no∣thinge, because he desired to be left free.</P>
<P>Sir, there is another trouble which I presume to putt upon you, which is, to speak to the reverend Mr. Higgin∣son, pastour of Salem, to move that congregation to doe something for the maintenance of Mrs. Peters,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Widow of Hugh Peters.</NOTE> who, since her husband suffered here, hath depended wholly upon Mr. Cockquaine and that church whereof he is pastour. I fear she will be forced to seke her living in the streets, if some course be not taken for her relief, either by Mr. Higginson or Mr. Oxenbridge, or some other sympathy∣zing minister. Sir, I pray you, present my best respects to both of them. Little news here since my last, which was directed to yourselfe. Here is great talke of the Ger∣man Emperor and the Sweeds joyning with the Hollander. The treaty of peace at Coligne is sayd to be broken up, our navy is going forth suddainly, it is violently suspected that all our East India men are taken by the Dutch, and some of our factoryes.

<P>TRUSTY and well beloved, We greet you well. Whereas We have been given to understand that you did in the month of October last, passe a law in your assembly at Boston for the reviving and administring a certain oath of fidelity to the country; and whereas the enjoyning the said oath at such time, when you had inti∣mation by your agents here of our being displeased with the forme thereof, is highly disrespectfull to Us, and seems to be intended as a snare in the way of many of our good subjects there, of whose preservation We shall ever be ten∣der; We have thought fit hereby to signify to you, that We take the untimely renewing and enjoyning of the said oath very ill, and that We look upon the same as deroga∣tory to our honour as well as defective in point of your duty, inasmuch as the allegiance due to us, and the fidelity to the country are joyned together in the same undecent forme, wherein such fidelity is made even to precede your allegiance to us. And though We doe not, for the pre∣sent, prescribe what forme may be proper amongst your selves, as to your corporation oath, yet We doe hereby strictly require and command you to give order that the oath of allegiance, as it is by law established in this Our kingdom of England, a copy of which oath attested by one of Our principall secretaries of state you will receive herewith inclosed) be administred unto and taken by all Our subjects, inhabitants within that Our colony, who are of years to take an oath, wherein We expect your entire

<P>THAT whereas your sayd petitioners have since your Majesties most happy restauration, upon their several addresses in the yeares 1661, 62, &amp;c. received many sig∣nal and gracious returns of favor (confirmation of our charter, pardon of our errors, assurance of your royall inclination to promote the trade and happines of this plan∣tation) proceeding only from your royal goodnes, which hath highly obliged us to all due acknowledgments there∣of, as wee have had opportunity; and wee shall, in future, at no time omit to manifest (according to our capacitie) our harty and sincere affection to your Majesties service and interest, as in duty wee are bound: And therefore most humbly implore the continuance of those gracious influ∣ences, whereby your poore subjects here have been soe much refreshed in their great sufferings and distresses, and that your Majestie, according to your innate wisdome and

<P>In humble obedience to your Majesties command in 76, wee dispatched our good friends Mr. William Stoughton and Mr. P.

<P>Wee humbly supplicate your Majestie that our messen∣gers, having dispatched the business betrusted with them by us and commanded to attend by your Majestie, may be at liberty to returne, and not be obliged to make answer to such complaints as are made by unquiet spirits, who seek not your Majesties but their owne advantages and our distress. And what shall be incumbent on us, wee shall with all dutifullness attend, as becomes good christians and loyal English subjects, and shall glory in giving your Ma∣jestie all just satisfaction, not insisting upon any errata that may have slipped us in 48 years, especially in our infancy,

These our letters are to accompany our trusty and well beloved William Stoughton and Peter Bulkley, Esqrs. your agents, who having manifested to us great necessity in their domestick concernes to returne back into New-England, Wee have graciously consented thereunto, and the rather because, for many months past, our councill hath been taken up in the discovery and prosecution of a popish plott, and yet there appears little prospect of any speedy leasure for entring upon such regulation in your affaires as is certainly necessary, not only in respect of our dignity but of your owne perfect settlement. But it is very probable that if either your said agents had brought commission to intermeddle in such regulation (which they have disowned) or that you had sent such commission after them, when, from time to time, intimations were given them of what wee did expect, and what wee were thereupon willing to grant, neither their stay had been thus long, nor had the matter now been undetermined. Wee must therefore at∣tend a further opportunity for this work and, in order thereunto, our will and pleasure is, that you send out such other fitt person or persons, duly instructed, and send them in six months after the receipt of these our letters, that they may here attend us in the prosecution of the same: For since the charter, by its frame and contents, was originally to be executed in this kingdome<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Massa. Hist. Vol. I. p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> and not in New-England, otherwise than by deputation (as is accor∣dingly practiced in all other charters of like nature) 'tis not possible to establish that perfect settlement wee so much desire, untill these things are better understood. In the mean time, wee doubt not but the bearers hereof, who have demeaned themselves, during their attendance, with good care and discretion, will, from their owne observations, acquaint you with many important things which may be
<PB N="520" REF="011300_0263_0F86CD1A04249F88"/>
of such use and advertisement to you that we might well hope to be prevented, by your applications, in what is ex∣pected or desired by us, so much it is your interest to pro∣pose and intercede for the same; for we are graciously inclined to have all past errors and mistakes forgotten, and that your condition might be so amended as that neither your settlement, or the minds of our good subjects there, should be lyable to be shaken and disquieted upon every complaint. Wee have heard, with satisfaction, of the great readiness wherewith our good subjects there have lately offered themselves to the taking of the oath of allegiance, which is a clear minifestation to us that the unanswerable defect in that particular was but the fault of a very few in power, who for so longe a time obstructed what the char∣ter and our expresse commands obliged them unto, as will appeare in our gracious letters of the 28th of June, in the fourteenth yeare of our reigne; and wee shall henceforth expect that there will be a suitable obedience in other par∣ticulars of the said letter, as namely, in respect of freedom and liberty of conscience, so as those that desire to serve God, in the way of the church of England, be not thereby made obnoxious or discountenanced from their sharing in the government, much lesse that they or any other of our good subjects (not being Papists) who do not agree in the congregationall way, be by law subjected to fines or for∣feitures, or other incapacities, for the same; which is a severity to be the more wondred at, when as liberty of con∣science was made one principall motive for your first transportation into those parts; nor do wee think it fitt that any other distinction be observed in the making of freemen, than that they be men of competent estates, rate∣able at ten shillings,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They seem to have held out till the last in refusing to admit any to be freemen who were not, either church members or who did not, at least, obtain a certificate from the minister of the town that they were orthodox, of good lives, &amp;c.</NOTE> according to the rules of the place, and that such, in their turnes, be also capable of the ma∣gistracy, and all lawes made voyd that obstruct the same. And because wee have not observed any fruits or advan∣tage by the dispensation granted by us in our said letters

of June in the fourteenth year of our reign, whereby the number of assistants, settled by our charter to be eighteen, might be reduced unto the number of tenn, our will and pleasure is, that the ancient number of eighteen be hence∣forth observed, according to the letter of the charter. And our further will and pleasure is, that all persons coming to any priveledge, trust, or office in that colony, be first enjoyned to take the oath of allegiance, and that all the military commssions as well as the proceedings of justice may run in our royall name. Wee are informed that you have lately made some good provision for observing the acts of trade and navigation, which is well pleasing unto us.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is very extraordinary, for this provision was an act of the colony declaring that the acts of trade should be in force there. Massa. Hist. Vol. I. p. 322.</NOTE> And as wee doubt not and do expect that you will abolish all lawes that are repugnant to and inconsistent with the lawes of trade with us, Wee have appointed our trusty and wellbeloved subject Edward Randolph, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to be our collector, surveyor and searcher, not only for that colony, but for all other our colonies in New England, constituting him, by the broad seal of this our kingdome, to the said employments, and therefore recommending him to your help and assistance in all things that may be re∣quisite in the discharge of his trust.</P>
<P>There is one thing which wee cannot omit to let you know wee are surprized at, which is, that during the time wee had the complaints of Mr. Gorges under our consideration, you should presume, without asking our royall permission, to purchase his interest in the province of Maine, the truth whereof is but lately owned by your said agents, when almost at the same time wee come to heare of some effects of a severe hand layd by you on our subjects there in consequence thereof. And whereas your agents declare you have payd to Mr. Gorges the sume of twelve hundred pounds for the said province, wee do ex∣pect, that upon our reimbursement of what it shall appeare you have payd for the same, that there be a surrender of all deeds and writings thereof made into our hands, and that your future agents do bring them over, forasmuch
<PB N="522" REF="011300_0264_0F86CD1ABA41B240"/>
as wee were sometime in treaty for the sayd province and do disapprove what you have done therein. And as for that part of the province of New-Hampshire lying three miles northward of Merimack river, which was granted unto Mr. Mason, and whereof the government remains still vested in us, you are not to expect (according to the desire of your agents) that the same should be annexed to your government, for wee have it under our consideration to establish such method there as may be of most benefit and satisfaction to the people of that place. And therefore our will and pleasure is, that you do recall all commissions granted by you for the governing within that province, which wee do hereby declare to be voyd, and do require that you do in all things for the future conforme yourselves unto the regulation which wee have taken in this behalfe. And so not doubting of your duty and obedience herein, wee bid you farewell. Given at our palace of Hampton-Court the 24th day of July 1679, and in the one and thirtieth year of our reigne.</P>

<P>TRUSTY and well beloved, wee greet you well. When by our royall letters bearing date the 24th day of July in the one and thirtieth year of our reigne, we signified unto you our gracious inclination to have all past deeds forgotten, setting before you the meanes whereby you might deserve our pardon, and commanding your ready obedience to severall particulars therein con∣tained, requiring, withall, a speedy compliance with the in∣timations of your duty given to your late agents, during their attendance here, all which wee esteeme essentiall to your quiet settlement and naturall obedience due unto us; wee then little thought that those markes of our grace and
<PB N="523" REF="011300_0264_0F86CD1ABA41B240"/>
favour should have found no better acceptance amoung you, but that, before all things, you should have given pre∣ference to the execution of all our commands, when after so many months we come to understand by a letter from you to one of our principall secretaries of state dated the 21st of May last, that very few of our directions had been pursued by your generall court, the further consideration of the remaining particulars having been put off upon in∣sufficient pretences, and even wholly neglecting your ap∣pointment of other agents which were required to be sent over unto us within sixe months after the receipt of our said letters, with full instructions to attend our royall plea∣sure herein in relation to that our government. We have also received the petition of our trusty and well beloved Robert Mason, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> whose ancestors obtained divers grants and made large purchases of lands in New England, humbly laying before us the state of his further preten∣sions to the propriety of soyle in a tract of land lying be∣tween Merrimack and Nahinkeke rivers, by virtue of a grant bearing date in the nineteeeth yeare of the reigne of our royall grandfather, in the examination whereof the lords of our committee of forrain plantations had made such a progresse that the right of our subjects had been thereupon settled, without the humble intreaty of your said agents, and the consent of the said Robert Mason, that in regard of their suddaine departure and want of power in that behalfe, the determination thereof might be suspended untill the arrivall of other agents to be ap∣pointed according to the limitation of our aforesaid let∣ters, as your agents were able to informe you. And al∣though the vindication of our authority, and the demand of justice from one of our subjects, might have well induc∣ed to the most speedy meanes of redresse, by doing us and our subjects right; Wee have neverthelesse continued our royall clemency towards you and thought fitt to give you further opportunity of bearing evidence of your duty to∣wards us; so as no further occasion of complaint may be offered in respect of your behaviour. Wee doe there∣fore, by these our letters, strictly command and require you,

Such is the care and tendernesse that wee will alwayes continue towards you and other our subjects, by removing those difficulties and mistakes that have arisen by the execution of the powers of your charter at such a distance from us, which by the first in∣tendment and present constitution thereof (as by the charter appears) has its naturall seate and immediate direction with∣in our kingdome of England, and that the due observance of all our commands above-mentioned may not be any longer protracted, wee require you, upon the receipt here∣of, forthwith to call a generall court, and therein to read these our letters and provide for our speedy sattisfaction; in default whereof, wee shall take the most effectual meanes to procure the same. And so wee bid you farewell.

<HEAD>Copy of Edward Randolph's Articles of high Misdemeanor exhibited against the General Court sitting 15th February 1681.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Massa. Hist. Vol. I. p. 335.</NOTE></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Articles of high misdemeanour exhibited against a faction in the generall court, sitting in Boston, 15 Feb. 81. viz. against Tho. Danforth, Dan. Gookin, Mr. Salton∣stall, Sam. Nowell, Mr. Richards, Mr. Davy, Mr. Gid∣ney, Mr. Appleton, magistrates. And against John Fisher, Elisha Cook, Tho. Brattle, Anthony Stodder, Bathurst, Hathorn, Wait, Johnson, Hutchinson, Sprague, Oakes, Holbrook, Cushion, Hammond, Pike, deputys &amp;c. By Edward Randolph, collector, &amp;c. of his Majesties customs in New-England.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. THAT the said faction, the governor not consent∣ing thereto, have refused to publish his Majesties proclamation of the 24th of November in the 23d year of his reign, sent by his Majesties special command, and received by this government in October 1680, which en∣forceth the act made in 25th year of his Majesties reign.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="527" REF="011300_0266_0F86CD1DEDD6E8B8"/>II. The said faction have refused to declare and admit of his Majesties letters pattents bearing date at Westminster 15th October, in the 33d year of his reign, erecting an office of collector, &amp;c. of his Majesties customs in New-England, and of the powers granted to his Majesties offi∣cer by the same, tho' often pressed thereunto, in the gene∣rall court, by the governour, Major Dudley and severall of the magistrates of the colony.</P>
<P N="3">III. The said faction have refused to pay me severall summes of money which I was forced to deposit in court before I could proceed to triall of causes relating to his Majesty's concerns, by virtue of an order of court made October 1. 1681, no law of this colony directing the same, though by his Majesty's royall letters of Octob. 21. 1681, they are particularly required thereunto.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The said faction, under pretence of satisfaction of his Majesty and regulating the trade of this colony, in op∣position to the said officer of collector of his Majesty's customs, have confirmed the place and powers of the col∣lector of the customs and imposts laid upon wines and strong waters imported into their colony, set up by a law made in their colony in 1645, their present navall officer, having been chiefe collector of these dutyes above a yeare before this navall office was ordered, as by their law, navall office, doth appeare.</P>
<P N="5">V. The said faction continue to exercise the power of governor and court of assistants, which, through the inad∣vertency of former governors, the court of deputyes have assumed, to heare, repeale and determine in civill causes, which, for want of education and being under no particu∣lar oath, they are uncapable to manage: so that by their numbers outvoting the governor and court of assistants, his Majesty's subjects greatly suffer in their estates, and besides, there is no such power granted them in their charter.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The said faction have neglected to repeale all laws of their colony contrary to the laws of England, though required thereunto by his Majesty's letters of 28th of Feb. 1662, and the observance thereof promised by their agents
<PB N="528" REF="011300_0267_0F86CD21AE0B8578"/>
at that time; and also by particular direction from the right honourable the Lords of the committee of trade and plantation to their late agents in 1678, by which meanes coining of money (acknowledged in their agents petition to his Majesty a great crime and misdemeanor, who then craved his Majesty's pardon to the government for the same) is continued to this day, &amp;c. Also their laws eccle∣siasticall continued, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The said faction have refused to admit of his Majesties letters pattents beating date at Westminster 19th of May in the 32d year of his Majesty's reign, granted to William Blathwait, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> erecting an office of surveyor and auditor generall of his Majesties revenues arising in America, and do appropriate to themselves the fines, for∣feitures, &amp;c. which appear by the said letters pattents to belong to his Majesty, and they make the condition of all recognizances and penall bonds payable to the treasurer and not to the King.</P>

And that wee may not be reflected upon as those that make very unsuitable returns thereunto, wee have taken the boldnes to trouble your honour with the fol∣lowing account of our proceedings; whereby wee hope soe great an infelicity may be prevented, and which though it may seeme late, yet is by the first from hence, except one ready to saile, when his Majesties commands were received by us.</P>
<P><PB N="529" REF="011300_0267_0F86CD21AE0B8578"/>Upon the receipt of his Majesties said letter (though at a season, in regard of the extremity of the cold and snow, very difficult for the members, especially those remote, to assemble in) the governour forthwith summoned a gene∣ral court; which being met January 4th and his Majesties letter communicated with all duty and regard, the contents thereof were taken into serious consideracion.</P>
<P>And, in the first place, wee applyed ourselves to the choise of agents that they might have timely notice and, accordingly, so prepare themselves for that service as to be ready to imbarque upon the first opportunity.</P>
<P>Wee considered of instructions for them, wee carefully perused our whole booke of lawes, pursuant to the excep∣tions made to some of them by Mr. Atturny and Sollicitor generall when our late agents were attending his Majestie and their information given us, since their returne home, wherein wee have made a considerable progresse towards a conclusion.</P>
<P>But so it is, right honourable, that wee find it no easy matter to prevaile with persons, in any degree qualifyed, to undertake such a voyage at this time; and though se∣veral elections have been made, wee have not as yet ob∣tain'd the consent of any.</P>
<P>The present calamity of others of this country, now slaves in Algier (and one of them an agent from one of his Majesties colonies here) not yet ransomed, does greatly dis∣courage, especially such as live in good credit and condition.</P>
<P>And truly, Sir, should persons under such a character be taken, wee have cause to beleeve their ransome would be so high as that it would be hard for us to procure it amongst a poore people yet labouring under the burthen of the arreares of our late warre with the Indians and other extraordinary charges not yet defrayed.</P>
<P>Sir, Wee doe not urge this as that which hath kept us from our duty, but only as an inconvenience that meets us in the discharge of it.</P>
<P>Wee doe not take ourselves to be disobliged; wee have not departed from our resolutions: But hope the pre∣mises

considered (without mentioning other ill circum∣stances which wee are attended with in this affaire) that the lapse of time will not be reflected upon as proceeding from the want of loyalty and allegiance in us, which wee hum∣bly professe that wee will always beare to his most sacred Majestie: And will the rather hope for his Majesties pardon herein, for that we understand his Majesties time is yet taken up in those weighty affairs (especially relating to the horrid and execrable popish plot) which were the chiefe occasion of his dismission of our former agents. So that we have ground to feare that our attendance at pre∣sent may be troublesome to his Majestie and unprofitable to ourselves.</P>
<P>Right honourable, Wee humbly pray that this our addresse may be accepted and taken in good part by your honour, and that you will please to favour us, his Majesties most dutifull and obedient subjects, with the representation of our present condition herein contained; that wee may not incurre his Majesties displeasure, nor be thought re∣gardlesse of his commands, whereunto wee have been assembled in general court, endeavouring to give evidence of our obedience.</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from Edward Randolph to the Bishop of London.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my attendance on your Lordship, I often exprest that some able ministers might bee appoynted to per∣forme the officies of the church with us. The maine ob∣stacle was, how they should be mainetayned. I did for∣merly, and doe now propose, that a part of that money sent over hither and pretended to bee expended amongst the Indians, may be ordered to goe towards that charge. I am told by credible persons that there is nigh two thou∣sand pounds of that money put out to interest in this country, I know two hundred hath bin for many yeeres in the hands of Mr. Rawson, their secretary, who is now pressed for to pay the money, to his utter ruin. Necessity, and not duty, hath obliged this government to send over two agents to England; they are like to the two consuls of Rome, Cesar and Bibulus. Major Dudley is a great op∣poser of the faction heere, against which I have now arti∣cled to his Majesty, who, if he finds things resolutely man∣niged, will cringe and bow to any thing; he hath his for∣tune to make in the world, and if his Majesty, upon alte∣ration of the government, make him captain of the castle of Boston and the forts in the colloney, his Majesty will gaine a popular man and obleidge the better party.</P>
<P>But if, whatever I have said and proved against, and even confessed by their former agents, their money raised upon the miserable inhabitants shall still prove a prevailing argument, and the agents be dismissed before every mat∣ter concluded in England bee certified to bee duly and punctually observed heere, you will render them more capable to oppose his Majestys authority.</P>
<P>I have reason, from such great pressing reasons to pay in this 200<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> to believe that this money is a banke layd up heere upon mannaging some publick designe. There was
<PB N="532" REF="011300_0269_0F86CD2845E03A08"/>
a great difference betwixt the old church and the members of the newchurch, about baptisme and their members joyn∣ing in full communion with either church; this was soe high that there was imprisoning of parties and great distur∣bances, but now, heereing of my proposals for ministers to be sent over, for they have very good correspondancy with some of the clarks of the councell, they are now joyned together, about a fortnight ago, and pray to God to con∣found the devices of all who disturbe their peace and li∣berties. I have made it an article against them, for not repealing their lawes ecclesiasticall, and sent in my papers to Mr. Blackworth a large account of their latter transac∣tions, to which I humbly beseech your Lordship to be referred and to be present at the committys making a party against their great friend L. P. S. who cannot withstand their weighty arguments. They have bin this 3 yeeres raising money for this expedition, their last agents ex∣pended above 4000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> in their agency, the poore people must pay all, for by their law neither magistrates, mini∣sters or any publick officers are charged with any publick rate. These agents have certaynly one great advantage by my absence, haveing liberty to say what they please; but I thinke I have so cleerly layd downe the matter of fact, sent over their lawes and orders to confirme what I have wrote, that they cannot deny them; however, if commanded, I will readily pass the seas to attend at White∣hall, especially if Danford, Goggin and Newell, majestrates, and Cooke, Hutchinson and Fisher, members of their late generall court and great opposers of the honest governor and majestrates, be sent for to appeare before his Majesty, till which time this country will always be a shame as well as inconveniency to the government at home. Your Lord∣ship hath a great pledge for such ministers as your Lord∣ship shall thinke convenient to send over, for their civell treatment, and I thinke no person sitter than Major Dudley, their agent, to accompany them, who will be very carefull to have them settled as ordered in England. He is one of the commissioners for the money sent over for
<PB N="533" REF="011300_0269_0F86CD2845E03A08"/>
the converting the Indians; I give him two or three lines to recommend him to your Lordships favour, soe far as he may bee serviceable to the designe; as for Capt. Richards, he is one of the faction, a man of meane extraction, com∣ing over a poore servant, as most of the faction were at their first planting heere, but by extraordinary feats and coussinadge have gott them great estates in land, especially Danford, so that if his Majesty doe fine them sufficiently, and well if they escape soe, they can goe to worke for more. As for Mr. Richards, he ought to be kept very safe till all things tending to the quiett and regulation of this government be perfectly settled. I give your Lord∣ship my humble thankes for the great present of excellent bookes. I have disposed of them to advantage and, with my wife, are cryed out upon as disturbers of the peace of the churches, for bringing in damnable bookes. We have in Boston one Mr. Willard, a minister, brother to Major Dudley, he is a moderate man and baptiseth chose who are refused by the other churches, for which he is hated. My Lord, we heere the slaves in Algier are all to be re∣deemed, that I bouldly write itt that the settlement of this country and putting the government into the hands of honest gentlemen, some or which are already in the maje∣stracy, and discountenancing utterly the faction, will be more gratefull to us, for now our conciences as well as our bodys are in captivity to servants and illiterate plan∣ters. My Lord, your goodnes and readines to serve his Majesty in the settlement of this great plantation, invites me, upon all occasions, to interpose your Lordships more weighty affayres, but since wee are heere immediately un∣der your Lordships care, I with more freedome press for able and sober ministers, and wee will contribute largely to their maintenance, but one thing will mainely helpe, when no marriages heereafter shall be allowed lawfull but such as are made by the ministers of the church of England. I humbly crave your Lordships blessing and remaine</P>

I have a great fammyly to mayntayne, have had great losses and expences about his Majesties service heere, all which, I hope, will be taken into consideration; for if his Majesty be now resolute, I question not, but without aney further charge to his Majesty, the whole settlement of the country will be effected.</P>

<SALUTE>Right honourable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Wrote your Lordship largely by Mr. Foy, which I hope is come to your Lordships hands. Our agents are sayled from hence about a fortnight ago. Wee heare, Maj. Dudley, one of them, is very sick of a feavor and not like to hold out the voyage, Mr. Richards, the other, one of Danforths faction and a great opposer of the governor, will, upon Maj. Dudleys death, have an opportunity to say what he pleaseth, in defence of the severall misdemeanors objected against them and their faction.</P>
<P>They have been these 2 yeares raysing money upon the poore inhabitants, to make friends at court, certainly they have some there, too nigh the councill chamber, otherwise they could not have coppies of my petition against their government, my articles of high misdemeanures against Danforth, and now of Mr. Cranfields instructions and ne∣gotiations in the province of New-Hampshire.</P>
<P>I heartily congratulate the happy returne of his Royall H. my gracious master, to Whitehall, the news whereof and of his Majesties bringing quo warrantos against several charters in England, and of Mr. Cranfields being constituted
<PB N="535" REF="011300_0270_0F86CD29CD67D2E0"/>
governor of New-Hampshire, puts the faction in a great perplexity; their generall court hath sett above a month, and made only the inclosed law, and appointed a fast throughout the government. I am confident, if his Ma∣jestie had bene pleased, at the same time he made Mr. Cran∣field governor, to bring a Q. W. against their charter and made him governor of this collonie, they would thanck∣fully receive him, especially upon declaring liberty of con∣science in matters of religion; but so long as their charter remaines undisturbed, all his Majestie saith or commands signifies nothing here. The governor is very much trou∣bled that the faction will not hearken to reason; he en∣deavoured to have their navall office (sett up in opposition to my letters pattents) taken away this generall court, and have all the acts of parliament relating to trade declared and published, but the faction are resolved to doe nothing to oblige the governor or answer his Majesties expecta∣tions. His Majesties quo warranto against their charter and sending for Tho. Danforth, Sam. Nowell, a late factious preacher and now a magistrate, and Dan. Fisher and Elisha Cooke, deputies, to attend and answer the articles of high misdemeanures I have now exhibited against them, in my papers sent Mr. Blaithwait per Capt. Foy, will make the whole faction tremble. I was very much threatned for my protest against their navall office, but it was at a time when they heard of troubles in England; but, since, I am very easy, and they would be glad to heare no more of it. His Majestie commanded them to repay me the money they tooke from me by their arbitrary orders, which the faction would not heare of, I have therefore arrested Mr. Danforth for 10<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> part of that money, and their treasurer, Mr. Russell, for 5<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> due to me for a fine, and I am to have a tryall with them. I humbly beseech your Lordship that I may have coesideration for all my losses and money laid out in prosecuting seizures here, in the year 1680. If I may not have it out of his Majesties treasury in England, that the heads of this faction here may be strictly prosecuted and fined for their treasons and misdemeanures, and my
<PB N="536" REF="011300_0271_0F86CD2A8DD45050"/>
money paid out of their fines. My Lord, I am at a great disadvantage, by reason of my distance from court, and in no condition to sollicite his Majesties concernes and the good and wellfare of this colony, as formerly, I well re∣member, business with your Lordship, as with other Lords of the councill, sometimes intervenes, which hath occa∣sioned not only delays but quite alters the face of things, especially when a committee of Lords meete, who are not acquainted with the whole series of this affaire: It is there∣fore my humble request to your Lordship to move that 2 or 3 committyes may be appointed for this matter, when your Lordship, my Lord Hide, and Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, may be present, and the whole matter of fact examined and stated. I know the agents, at least one of them, will confess what is charged upon their government, as their former agents did, in their petition to his Majestie, which is a standing evidence against them; but if that be not sufficient ground to avoid their charter, together with the misdemeanors charged upon them, on which your Lordship hath the opinion of Sir Wm. Jones, if his Ma∣jestie please to direct Gov. Cranfield to examine the last articles against the faction, there will be reason not only to vacate their charter but to send over a prudent gentleman to be generall governor. If the party were so considera∣ble as to revolt, upon his Majesties resolution to settle this plantation (as hath been sometime suggested) their first worke would be to call me to account, for endeavouring, openly, the alteration of their constitution, which by their law is death, but they dwindle away and are very much divided, magistrate against magistrate, the one hoping, the other fearing a change. My Lord, I have but one thing to reminde your Lordship, that nothing their agents can say or doe in England can be any ground for his Majestie to depend upon: Be pleased to remember, from the time your Lordships honorable father, the late Lord Chancellor, engaged with their agents, in 1662, who undertooke and assented to every thinge his Lordship proposed for his Majesties honour and the benefit of his subjects here in∣habiting,
<PB N="537" REF="011300_0271_0F86CD2A8DD45050"/>
nothing but open contempt, of all his Majesties commands, with small evasions and tricks, have followed, and worse may be daily expected, if it be left to them to regulate the abuses complained of. My Lord, one un∣happy (if not willfull) mistake hath very much promoted these mischiefs, his Majestie hath been represented to this people very low in his treasury, unable and unwilling to give them any disturbance, though never so much pro∣voked to it, which is here believed, when to this day their contempts putt upon his Majesties commission and com∣missioners in 1664, his Majestie not calling them to account for refusing to send over Bellingham and Hathorne, when commanded upon their allegiance to attend at Whitehall by his Majesties letter of 1666, no not so much as the least notice taken of it in any of his Majesties letters at any time since to this government, and on the other hand, by a certain <HI>deceptio visus,</HI> these people have been represented to his Majestie as a very dutifull and loyall people, that they are a great people and can raise great forces, besides that they have been at vast charges and expences in sub∣duing a wildernesse and making a great country, without any charge or expence to the crown. Its true there are many loyall subjects here, but few of them in any places of trust. Their forces are very inconsiderable, more for shew than service. I will engage with 500 of his Majesties guards to drive them out of their country. And for their expences, I know very few now living, nor their children, who were at that charge. Mr. Dudley, one of the present agents, was one of the first planters and a gentleman, came over with a good estate, but the first adventurers are either all dead and their children drave out of all, by their fathers servants, or else so few and inconsiderable that no notice is taken of them; and as for all the persons joyned and con∣cerned in the faction here, I know but one man who was not a servant or a servants son, who now governe their governor and the whole country.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a scandalous misrepresentation, unless he intended to save himself by supposing the governor and the whole country to be governed by a few, only, of those against whom he had just be∣fore exhibited articles of high misdemeanor.</NOTE> I beseech your Lord∣ship
<PB N="538" REF="011300_0272_0F86CD2B4307D160"/>
to pardon my long New England discourse, and be∣lieve me, in all this, to aime at his Majesties honour and the good of this plantation, where, by his Majesties goodness and your Lordships favour, I am now become an inhabitant, and remaine</P>

<P>My Lord, After your Lordship hath perused the inclosed, if any thinge occurr therein which may be of service, whilest the affaires of this colony are transacting, be pleased to send it to Mr. Blaithwait, that the necessaries may be communicated, if required. In the inclosed law, they call the money coyned in this colony. New Eng∣land coyne, engageing the whole plantation in the matter of their mint and thereby bespeaking the influence this small government would have over all the neighbour∣ing colonys, but their ambition will shew itself upon all occasions; however, if they cannot conceale what they aime at, lying under such circumstances, they will take a time effectually to demonstrate what they have been for many yeeres, designing, that is, the generall go∣vernment over the whole plantation, which, indeed, is absolutely necessary on his Majesties behalfe, but not to be managed by them.</P>

<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Gave your Lordship the trouble of mine of 29th of May last, which I hope is long since received. Wee have advice by Capt. Barrett, now arrived from London, that your lordship hath remembered us, and sent over a minister with Mr. Cranfield, the very report hath given great satisfaction to many hundreds whose children are not baptized, and to as many who never, since they came out of England, received the sacrament. I wrote your
<PB N="539" REF="011300_0272_0F86CD2B4307D160"/>
lordship of our two agents coming over to attend and re∣ceive his Majesties commands, they have large commis∣sions to promise as much as any of their former agents, and have credit for large sumes of money to purchase (if they can) what their promises cannot obtaine, but I hope nothing will be concluded upon, and they thereupon per∣mitted to returne home, till his Majestie have full assu∣rance from governor Cranfield that all things are here duly performed which are expected and commanded to be done in this collonie. But nothing will so effectually set∣tle this government on a firme dependence upon the crowne as bringing a quo warranto against their charter, which will wholly disinable many, now, great sticklers and promoters of the faction among us from acting further in a publick station, especially those against whom I have ex∣hibited the inclosed articles sent in my last to Mr. Blathwait.</P>
<P>My Lord, I am at a great distance and so not able personally to attend and sollicite in this affaire as for∣merly, but in regard the matter is more easy to be effected, I thinke it unnecessary, yet in regard its ab∣solutely necessary for his Majesties service and advantage to the crown to have the whole plantation settled upon the true basis of duty and allegiance, I had rather take a voyage to England, if commanded, to make out my alle∣gations, than to have this matter passed over and hursht up upon bare pretences and promises. I confesse my particular businesse is to take care of the trade of this country, I dayly expose myselfe to many hazards and troubles, but all I have done or can project is to little purpose, so long as this government (now sufficiently di∣vided) which the lawes of England enjoyne to my aide and assistance, are parties and chiefe obstructers of my designs, for till this government be thoroughly regulated, all that his Majestie commands will signify nothing. This inde∣pendency in government claimed and daily practised by us is one chiefe occasion of the many mutinies and distur∣bances in other his Majesties forreigne plantations. If wee are misinformed concerning your lordship's sending
<PB N="540" REF="011300_0273_0F86CD2BFB75FC20"/>
over a minister, be pleased to commiserate our condition, and send us over a sober discreet gentleman. Your lord∣ship hath now good security, so long as their agents are in England, for his civill treatment by the contrary partie; he will be received by all honest men with hearty christian respects and kindness, and if his Majesties lawes (as none but fanaticks question) be of force with us, wee could raise a sufficient maintenance for divers ministers out of the estates of those whose treasons have forfeited them to his Majestie. I have wrote to the Earl of Clarendon, to Mr. secretary Jenkins, to remind them of the many small eva∣sions and tricks putt upon his Majestie and the lords of the councill by this inconsiderable faction, whose so long delayed punishment and reformation, invites and incou∣rageth to greater contempts. I question not but your lordships unspotted loyalty to his Majestie, and charitie to us his dutifull subjects, will now engage your lordship timely and vigorously to assist, so to reduce this faction, as to put it absolutely out of their power to attempt the like for the future. Our ministers hope God will support them in all their extravagancies, and now wee have a sol∣lemne fast ordered to intreate the Lord to give our agents favour in the eyes of the King, and with all they are to be concerned. Serjeant Maynard, his Majesties serjeant at law, hath made a present of eight chests of books, now sent over to the colledge at Cambridge, by Capt. Barrett, and consigned them to Capt. Richards, one of the agents sent to England. They are valued at above 400<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> I finde his marrying Mr. Bantries neece will oblige him to stand up for the good old cause, and to assist the agents, who a∣mongst other matters, are to represent me as an enemie to this government, and an open disturber of their peace. I heartily beg your lordships blessing, and remayne,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have yours of Sept. 10th by me and am now to give you the news of your charter being vacated, by judg∣ment, for non-appearance. His Majesty has chosen Coll. Kerke, late governor of Tangier, to be your governor. He is a gentleman of very good resolution and, I believe, will not faile in any part of his duty to his Majesty nor be wanting to doe all good offices for your distracted colony, if, at last, they will hear what is reason and be governed. Here was sent over a most scandilous paper, preached, as tis said, by Mr. Moody and Mr. Mather; the Duke of Yorke hath a copy of it, and others have coppies also; twill doe your country great prejudice and put jealousies into the minde of the councel here, as if the collony would not abide by the judgment against their charter, but stand up to defend their liberties. My business has been and shall be to ward off as much as I can. And if, by the iniquity and folly of your ministers and majestrates, you faile of what was expected, the whole blame will rest upon themselves. The King sent me over to Holland, to in∣quire after the irregular traders; 3 or 4 had been there, and they were gone before my coming. I returned back a fortnight after judgment was given and would have been glad to have seen Sir Edmund Andrews in England, who is yet in Guernsey. I question not but you will have reports, as if a great fleet of ships, with regements of horse and foote, are coming against you, but I know of no such thing, only, I believe, a frigott or two will attend the go∣vernor, who is leftenant of one of his Majesties regiments of guards and one of the bed chamber. I remember what you advise, that the government be, in the first place, transposed and committed to the care of fitting persons upon the place to prepare and accommodate affairs against the arrival of the governour. I am not wanting to press for liberty of conscience and confirmation of all your rights and possessions, and have nominated, according to what was
<PB N="543" REF="011300_0274_0F86CD2CC28A73A0"/>
agreed betwixt you and myselfe, persons for the councill, and disswade all I can from raising any rates upon the peo-to support government, more than what has been usual with you. The King has been pleased to make me secretary and register of New-England. I have nominated you for the King's receiver generall of all New-England, which will be a place of profit. I had other things to propose on your behalfe, but that must attend a farther opportuni∣tie. Respects to the governor and his lady, madam Taylor, Mr. Stoughton, Mr. Bulkeley, Mr. Page and his lady, and all friends. Its yet very uncertain whether processe will issue out against Rhode Island and Connecticut collony to bring in both them before the governour come over, or to do that afterward in case they refuse to submit to a gene∣ral governour, as yet nothing has been discovered of it. A committee of Lords but saturday next is appointed for that busines. Dr. Cox is well and so is Mr. Boyl and all your friends, amongst whom I desire to be recorded, because I am Sir,</P>

<SALUTE>May it please your Lordships,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PURSUANT to his Majestyes order in council of the 13th July 1685, directing Mr. Attourney Generall to cause writs of Quo Warranto to be brought against the charters of the colonys of Rhode Island and Connecticot in New England, I accordingly served these writts, tho' by a tedious passage of almost 6 months from London to this place, the time of their returne was lapsed. However, the governor of Connecticott, upon my delivering the writt to him at Harford, on 21st instant, has appointed a meet∣ing of the generall courte of that colony to be called to∣gether to surrender their charter to his Majestie, if not perswaded by the factious people (who are unwilling to depend on his Majesties favour) to stand a triall, only to gain time and delay his Majesties sending over a generall. Upon my delivering the governor of R. Island the summons of the writt, he assembled the freemen, and they have drawne a petition and address to be forthwith humbly presented to his Majestie.</P>
<P>I intended, long before this time, humbly to lay before your Lordships a more early account of the present state of this government, but have forbore, to wait the effect his Majesties gracious commission and constitution of govern∣ment, containing libertie of conscience, would have upon
<PB N="545" REF="011300_0275_0F86CD2D79B0A188"/>
the people of this colony, which, at my first arrivall, was received with all outward shew of satisfaction and a com∣pliment of gratitude was returned his Majesty for that favour; but since, the proceeding of the governor and councill, whatever they write or pretend in their letters to their Lordships, are managed to the incouragement of the independant faction and utter discountenancing both the minister and these gentlemen and others who dare openly profess themselves to be of the church of England, not making any allowance for our minister, more than we rayse by contribution amongst ourselves. The frame of this government, only, is changed, for our independant mi∣nisters flourish, and expect to be advised with in publick affaires. I need no further arguments to confirme the truth hereof to your Lordship than to say, but two of the present members of the government, viz. Mr. Mason and myselfe, are members of the church of England, that of above 60 officers in the militia of the whole government, there are not above 2 captains, or 3 inferior officers, but are either church members or such as constantly frequent those meetings, which makes nonconformists from all places resort there. About 2 months agoe Mr. Morton, an ex∣communicated minister, came hither from Nuington green; he was welcomed by our president and designed to be master-head of our colledge, but not daring to proceed, at first, by such large steps, he is called to be minister at Charlestowne, a very good liveing, and is ready at hand to be president of the colledge.</P>
<P>Two brothers, of the name of Baylie, great and daring nonconformists at Lymbrick in Ireland, have been here 2 yeares and well provided for. In the time of Mon∣mouths rebellion, most part of the ministers animated the people, saying the time of their deliverance was at hand, and not one of them prayed for his Majestie, nor would give credit to his Majesties most gracious letter, signifying the overthrow of the rebells. I humbly propose, as great∣ly for the quiet and wellfare of this plantation of New-England, that no minister from England be permitted to
<PB N="546" REF="011300_0276_0F86CD2FC2055968"/>
land without the licence of the generall governour, and that he have power or licence to restrain from preaching such as are already upon the place. From all which it will appear very necessary that his Majesty would be gra∣ciously pleased to send over to us a generall governour, to unite and settle this distracted country, and also to make good what is already begun in this colony, the delay where∣of may be of evil consequence and give way for the factious people here to reassume the government, which they openly declare they have not parted withall, but expect an opportunity to be restored.</P>
<P>And as to the discharge of that trust reposed in me, I humbly represent to your Lordships, that under his Ma∣jesties authority the president takes great liberty to injoyne upon me in my station, and would not assist me to make a sei∣zure of a vessel in the harbour, which my officers were not permitted to board. I am by all accounted the foule enemy of the country, having been for 11 yeares attending his Majesties command in this affaire, and by serving the writts upon the other colonies, my life may be made very uneasy, unless his Majesty shall be pleased graciously to recommend me to the care and protection of his generall governour, for whose speedy arrivall all good men hear∣tily pray.</P>

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>INCLOSED is a letter sent some time since from the government of Road Island, they call it a surrender of their charter. I have since the receipt of it called on them in my way to Hartford in Connecticott, the governor tells
<PB N="547" REF="011300_0276_0F86CD2FC2055968"/>
me they will pass a surrender in fuller tearmes under the seale of their colony, but are willing to have this sent. I was with the governor of Connecticott and delivered to him the quo woranto. I suppose they intend not to stand it out, our councill have sent Major Pincheon and Capt. Winthrop to Hardford to perswade them to accommodate the matter, so as they may be added to the government here; how farr that will prevaile I know not; they are sen∣sible of Mr. Dudleyes encroachment on all and every side, and are unwilling to trust him, and are strongly invited to come under New Yorke, but it is more for the publick advantage to have that colony continued to us. Since my goeing to Hartford, the president has so contrived the matter that Capt. George has received above two hundred pounds mony which legally belongs to me who, as collec∣tor and informer, ought to be admitted to prosecute a ship laden with Scotch goods, but its all as Capt. George pleases, the president and he carry all as they please, to the greate dissattisfaction of the members of the councill, that now in∣stead of meeting to do publick business, tis only to quarrill and that in such heats that I feare it will occasion the de∣solving this government. I am forced to moderate others passions (tho' I have most cause to complaine) and quietly to suffer my proffitts to be shared out amongst others till Sir Edmund Andros come over; he is longed for by all sober men who find themselves abused by the false president. Mr. Wharton is comeing over our agent, I have offered Mr. Mason at least to be joined with him, but I think I cannot gett it to pass.</P>
<P>There will I fear be an eruption betwixt the French of Nova Scotia and our people in Mayne and New Hamp∣shire, occasioned by Capt. Palmer and Mr. West of New Yorke, who being at the fort of Pemmequid and haveing advice of a ship of Piscattaqua which landed wine at Ponop∣scutt belonging, as they say, to Nova Scotia, they by force went ashoar and took of the wine: I referr you to the inclosed, a copie of Mr. Palmers letter: The gover∣nor of New-Yorke I am told has given them directions to

claim all the land as farr eastward as the River St. Croix. We have sent to all places to warne our people and to the fishermen, not to venter upon their coasts, least they be surprized, and made to answer for damages done by stran∣gers. Just now I have received a letter from my good friend Mr. Chaplin, who acquaints me of your happy recovery from a dangerous sickness, for which I returne hearty thancks to allmighty God. Mr. Stoughton is inclined to the nonconformist ministers, yet stands right to his Majes∣tyes interest. Mr. Usher is made a great criminall for in∣forming against Moody and Allin, who are stirring up the people to rebellion, he is a just honest man, and will not see his Majestyes interest suffer. But we are over voted and cannot help our selves till Sir Edmund come to regulate the matter. Sir, I am under great difficultyes, and were it not for my ingagement in the business of the masts, I would once more make a journey over, for I am treated by Mr. Dudly worse than by Mr. Danforth, yet all under the pretence of friendship, and is angry that I do not believe him. Honest Major Buckly is quite tyred out and can hardly be perswaded to come to Boston. This is our present distracted condition. Wee have only patience and our friends assistance to depend upon in England for redress.</P>
<P>I remaine, Sir, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Sir, I am informed that the land wheron the wine was landed have been allwayes deemed to belong to the French and was the very place formerly belonging to Sir Thomas Temple, and was delivered up to the French upon the articles of Breda by Capt. Wibourne, by his Majesty's spe∣ciall command, in exchange for the English plantation on St. Christophers and that done about the yeare 1667.</P>
<P>Sir, Some of the members of the councill are of opi∣nion that since the constitution of this government is by a president and councill, who united are all but governor, that therefore they ought to have a proportionable share of the profitt as well as the charge and burthen, haveing not one penny comeing to them as members of the councill more then to any justice of the peace; some stay here five

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Grace,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have forborne riteing to your grace till I had been some time upon the place, to see how the poore peo∣ple here would demean themselves under this new govern∣ment. At my first arrivall I met with outward expressions of joy and satisfaction, and many seemed well pleased at the change, having been struck with a panicke feare upon the aprihention of Colonel Kurcks coming hither to be theire governor; but finding a commission directed to a gentleman borne among themselves, the then governor and companie, growing hardie by theire ministers, began to perswade Mr. Dudlie not to except of his Majesties com∣mission to be president, hoping thereby to continue the government among themselves: But that faileing them, they adjourned the meeting of their generall assembly to the second of October next, and so broke up with hopes, that either some unhappie accident in affairs of state at home, or by dissention raised by their artifices among the members in this new government, they might prevaile so far as to dissolve this new constitution and then reassume the government, which to accomplish they are solissitouse. I take leave humbly to remind, that when your grace was present at a committee of the Lords and was therein pleased to move, that one of theire meeting houses in
<PB N="550" REF="011300_0278_0F86CD327676B020"/>
Boston should be ordered to be set apart for the exercise of the religion according to the church of England, it was then answered by some of those noble Lords who discorsed in theire favour, provided they might have libertie of con∣cience in matters of religion, they would voluntarilie sub∣mit to have one of theire three meeting housen to be dis∣posed of by the president and councell, for that use. Since my arrivall with Mr. Ratcliffe, a sober man, recommended by my Lord of London to be our minister; who, besides his Lordships faire testimonials, brought with him a letter from the right honourable the Lords of the committe for trade and foraine plantations to the president and councell for their countenance and incouridgement in the discharge of his office; yet twas a long time before they tooke the least notice of him or his busines; at last, though strongly opposed, I got a little roome in their towne house, for such as were for the church of England to assemble in, but found it so straite that we are forced now to make use of the exchange for that purpose; where, to humour the people our minister preaches twice a day and baptises all that come to him, some infants, some adults persons; we are now come to have praiers every Wednesday and Friday mornings on their exchange, and resolve not to be baffled by the great affronts; some calling our minister Baals priest, and some of their menisters, from the pulpit, calling our praiers leeks, garlick and trash. We have often moved for an honourable maintenance for oure menister; but they tell us those that hire him must mainetaine him, as they maintaine their owne menisters, by contribution. Of a president and eighteen members of the councell, there is onely myselfe, since Mr Masons departure for England, that is of the church of England, and twas never intended that that charge should be supported by myselfe and some few others of oure communion.</P>
<P>I humbly represent to your grace, that the three meet∣ing houses in Boston might pay twentey shillings a weeke, a piece, out of their contribution, towards the defraieing our church charges; that sume being less per annum
<PB N="551" REF="011300_0278_0F86CD327676B020" MS="y"/>
than each of their ministers receive. We have yet ne∣cessitie for another minister to come over to us; for if any illness or indisposition happen to the present incumbent, we have no man heere to performe the office. I am not to forgit to your grace the banke of monie in the hands of the corporation for evangelizing the Indians. Your grace was very desireous that that monie might be inquired af∣ter, and applied to build us a church and free schooll, that our youth might be no longer poysoned with the sedissious principles of this country: I am told that there is not less then two thousand pounds here, but adventure not to stir the least in it, having all redie brought upon my self so many enemise, and to all my crimes added this one as the greatest in bringing the letherdge and cerimonise of the church of England to be observed amongst us, and this day is a commencement at our collidge, which your grace was pleased to honoure with a present of the learn∣ed Hamonds works, that rich man: They are all at present more taken up in puting in one Morton of Neventon-green, a rank independent, to be theire precident, than to shew any respect which is due to youre graceouse present, and I cannot expect it should be otherwise till his Majes∣tie shall be pleased to send us a generall governor from England.</P>
<P>Thus much relating to these affairs of oure church, that of our state little differs; most part of our chiefe officers, as justices of the peace, &amp;c. are congregationall men, and not above three church of England men; and not above three church of England officers in the militia; so that in the maine I can only assure your grace that the persons onely and not the government is changed.</P>
<P>Now from all this, after so many hazards and difficulties which I have gon throw in the prosecution of his Maje∣sties service in New England, I am, by their maliciouse practises made very uneasie; and such persons who reape particular advantages by the change of government hate me for accomplishing it, and are makeing parties and factions to misrepresent me to his Majestie. Amongst
<PB N="552" REF="011300_0279_0F86CD32B9B87958"/>
those many noble Lords of his Majesties most honourable previe councell, who have all along countenanced and furthered my hartie designs to serve his Majestie, Sir, there eminently appeared for me. I humblie pray, upon all occasions, the continuance of your graceouse favour, by which I shall be the better inabled to attend his Ma∣jesties affairs heer committed to my care, and I shall remain in all dutie your graces.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a copy of one of Mr. Randolph's letters, and I suppose the bad orthography is owing to the transcriber, for the origi∣nals are, in that respect, not very exceptionable.</NOTE></P>

<SALUTE>May it please your Grace,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have some time since humbly represented to your grace a necessity of having a church built in Boston to receive those of the church of England. Wee have at pre∣sent 400 persons who are daily frequenters of our church, and as many more would come over to us, but some being tradesmen, others of mechanick professions, are threatened by the congregationall men to be arrested by their creditors, or to be turned out of their work, if they offer to come to our church; under such discouragements wee lye at present, and are forced to address your grace for reliefe.</P>
<P>I have taken care to informe myself how the money sent over hither for the company of evangelizing Indeans in New England (for soe by their pattent from his late Majesty they are stiled) is disposed of here. Here are 7 persons, called commissioners or trustees, who have the sole manage of it; the chief of which are Mr. Dudley, our president, a man of a base, servile and antimonarchicall principle, Mr. Stoughton, of the old leaven, Mr Richards, a man not to be trusted in publique business, Mr. Hinkley, governor of New Plimouth collony, a rigid independant, and others like to these. The poor Indians (those who
<PB N="553" REF="011300_0279_0F86CD32B9B87958"/>
are called ministers) come and complaine to Mr. Ratclieffe, our minister, that they have nothing allowed them: We have spoken to the commissioners to have some allowance for them; all we can gett is the promise of a coarse coat against winter, and would not suffer Aaron, an Indian teacher, to have a bible with the common prayer in it, but took it away from him. This money is not less than 3 or 400<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> which is yearly returned over hither (some say 600) with which they enrich themselves, yet charge it all as layd out among the poore Indians. I humbly presume to remind your grace of your promise to me, when in Eng∣land, that a commission should be directed to some persons here, unconcerned, to audit and report their acts of this money. We want good schoolemasters, none being here allowed of but of ill principle, and, till there be provision made to rectifye the youth of this country, there is noe hopes that this people will prove loyall. The money now converted to private, or worse uses, will set up good and publick schooles and provide maintenance for our minister, who now lives upon a small contribution, and are yet forced to meet in the town-house.</P>
<P>I cannot omit to acquaint your grace, how tender con∣scienced, members of our old church, for soe they are di∣stinguished from the other 2 churches in Boston, are. Not long since, I desired them to let their clerk toll their bell at 9 clock, Wednesdays and Fridays, for us to meet to go to prayers. Their men told me, in excuse for not doing it, that they had considered and found it intrenched on their liberty of conscience granted them by his Majestyes present commission, and could in noe wise assent to it. The necessity of a church and publick schooles and encourage∣ment of ministers presses me to give your grace this trou∣ble, which I humbly intreat your grace to remember to effect, least the small beginnings of the church of England settled here with great difficulty, fall to the ground and be lost, for want of tymely relief and countenance.

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have with me your three letters of March the 7th, 11th and 7th April, by Mr. Mason, for all which I heartily thank you, and for your particular direction in the several stages of my employ. I have very lately had the bonds of masters of ships bound from hence to England in my custody, and those are indorsed that copys thereof are sent for England; you shall not faile of the duplicates if this ship makes not too much speed, and for the future you may expect them with my other accounts of the cus∣tom-house; however I am to take it as a favour if I be per∣mitted to send them directly to the custom-house, in regard I have been censured for suffering my papers but to look first into the plantation office, and the primier, there now, objected hard against me. Pardon my digression, you are sensible how much business I have lying upon me, to send accounts and duplicates from my custom-office. I am at 50<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a year charge to keep an able clerke. I cannot yet get any fees settled sufficient to pay that charge, Mr. Stough∣ton, Mr. Wharton and others objecting that his Majesties salary for 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a year is to defrey all that charge, so that I am a great loser, besides I am to have deputies in our several ports, and unless they allow fees I am not capable of doing that service at a distance without deputies, and their not allowing moderate fees is only to discourage from inspecting their irregular trade. This his excellency has endeavoured to have rectified, but is opposed by my enemies, to my very great losse, and prejudice to my deputyes. Inclosed is such an account as I could get from Mr. Hooke, late treasurer in the province of Mayne. Mr. Danforth, tho' severall times putt upon it for an account, wholly de∣clines it, and sayed he never received any money but it was all payd to Mr. Hooke, treasurer.</P>
<P><PB N="555" REF="011300_0280_0F86CD3B4F802F78"/>His excellency tryed all wayes to bring the people to quitt rents. There were severall who would take grantes for lands, but as it now falls out his excellency has none to dispose of; a little time will trye what our new judges Dudley and Stoughton will say, when either Indian pur∣chase or grantes from the generall court are questioned before them. Sir, you will much wonder to hear I have disposed of the secretaryes office, for a time, for too in∣considerable a vallue, whenas it was judged worth 5 or 600<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> I lost mony considerable, during the time I had it, one part the president run away with, and it was not set∣tled, tho' his excellency endeavoured it, but alwayes op∣posed, and whatever Mr. West can make of it, I could not get an able man to discharge it, but the whole trouble, care and charge lay upon me. I, sometime after his ex∣cellencyes arrivall, was directed to prepare commissions, civill and military for the whole territory. I made 12 in parchment for the peace, 240 military, copied and engros∣sed in parchment all the lawes, and dispersed copies through the whole government, yet they scrupled to allow me for writing them, these matters have so discouraged me that I thought it better to have some certainty than to leave all loose, and know no end to the charge. I hope long ere this you have received the minutes since his excellency's arrivall, since which nothing considerable has passed, only some laws about regulating cornfields and cattle, coopers and casks, they stick hard upon that of possession as of a generall concerne and, next to that, for a law for ministers maintenance, strongly opposed by the quakers. We have had but one meeting of the whole councill since passing those laws; that of the rates of pieces of eight does not answer the end, money grows very scarce and no trade to bring it in. The members of the councill of Rhoad Island and New Plimouth have enough of comeing to sett in councill, 8 or 10 dayes a time, at their own charge, and I now expect but very thin appearance for the future, in regard the tables are downe, but to the great dissatisfaction of our brethren.</P>
<P><PB N="556" REF="011300_0281_0F86CD3CD57F0D40"/>Twill be for his Majestyes service to putt Mr. Shrimp∣ton in the place of Captain Champernoon, and Mr. Lus∣combe in the place of Mr. Jo. Sandford of Rhoad Island, both dead. Since Colonel Dongan had notice of his excel∣lencies letter to the governor of Connecticott, he has sent his to tempt them to submit to New Yorke government, with assurance of the injoyment of their estates and pro∣perties, and that they shall all be continued in the govern∣ment, with I know not what other great advantages. If Connecticott goe to New Yorke, it will certainly evince that collony and this government cannot subsist without a free trade with Connecticutt, which will be debarred if they are not annexed to us, or what's worse for us, to pay 10 per cent. for all wheat, porke, &amp;c. brought to us, which we cannot want.</P>

<P>I Am obliged to you for yours of the 22d of Sept. last, with the newes and copy of Sir Robert Holmes com∣mission, all which I gratefully received from Capt. Leg, who arrived here the 10th inst. and delivered your letters, and packetts to his excellency our governor, who, being

in great sorrow for the losse of his good lady who dyed the 22d instant, desires me to present his humble service to Mr. Blathwayt and to yourselfe, and to excuse his not writing to you by this accidentall opportunity of a vessell going for Holland with logwood and must touch at some port in England.</P>
<P>By the severall Gazetts, filled with addresses, I find you are all at liberty at home, and I believe the court is so taken up with the weightier matters of state that there will be no room for my wife to addresse my petition for a confirmation of my office of secretary and sole register, &amp;c. which I pray may be enlarged and extended to the limitts of the present government. I see no reason why I should resede in my desires of getting an understanding gentleman to come from home to engage in the discharge of the secretary's and register's office, which is very bene∣ficiall to West, no fees being as yet agreed upon, and I have ground to believe designedly done to discourage any to undertake that office, whilst, in the mean time, he extorts what fees he pleases, to the great oppression of the people, and renders the present government grievous. I have wrote you of the want we have of two or three honest atturneys (if any such thing in nature) we have but two, one is Mr. West's creature, came with him from New-York, and drives all before him; he also takes extravagant fees, and for want of more the country cannot avoid com∣ing to him, so that we had better be quite without them than not to have more. I have wrote Mr. Blathwait the great necessity of judges from England. I know there are some loyall gentlemen and able lawyers, who have not practice; the judges with us, being now 3, have 390<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> be∣twixt them all, besides their fees, which they make very considerable to them: Now, two will serve our occasions. They ought to be of the councill, and their salaryes made up 400<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a yeare, apeece, they will deserve it. As for Mr. Bulkley he is stupified and drown in melancholy, and almost uselesse, being seldom with us. I formerly wrote you about a fitt person to assist in my office. Be∣sides
<PB N="558" REF="011300_0282_0F86CD3D91A58848"/>
the losse I dayly receive, Mr. West is cryed out upon by all; and whom Mr. Blathwayt or you should recom∣mend will be acceptable. Capt. Nicholson tells me Mr. Martin who was to come over with Col. Kerke, is out of busines and believes he would accept of the office: I would have an honest gentleman, who will not be drawn to ill company, but will mind his busines: There are many about court, but now out of my mind. Pray, please to assist my wife in what may be for my interest.</P>
<P>Severall vessells are gone from hence to Bermodos, but are designed for the wreck. No news yet of Sir John Norburrow or Sir William Phips being there. We can∣not yet agree upon the prizes of money: Some would have all peeces of 8, tho' of 15 pennyweight, go at 6<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> New-England, others at 17; but they stand at 17½. Our mo∣ney goes all away and shall have little or none to supply ordinary occasions.</P>
<P>Since the governor's arrivall, New Plimouth colony have great profitt by whale killing: I believe they will have nigh 200 tons for to send to England, and will be one of our best returnes, now beaver and peltry fayles us. I have a desire to see England once more, but know not when I can get an opportunity, or my busines will allow of my absence, till I take leave of it, which I am not much disposed to think of till I hear all things are settled with you. I shall write you all our proceedings, as opportu∣nity offers. Not further, but that I am, Sir,</P>

<P>I Am to thank you for yours of the 23d of November, and would not faile to answer the chief particulars. If the union of all New England under one governor be acceptable on your side the water, what will the joining and annexing to the same government be of all the En∣glish territories in America, from Delaware bay to Nova Scotia? This is already determined by his Majesty, and a commission constituting Sir Edmund Andros governor also of New-York, as united to and parcel of his Majesties dominion of New-England. And for the two Jersies, scire facias's are expediting towards their union. This, besides other advantages, will be terrible to the French and make them proceed with more caution than they have lately done.</P>
<P>I am obliged to you for your kind present of cranberries, acorns, chesnuts, &amp;c. which came very well and are im∣parted to Mr. Robert Southwell. The little box of locust trees was broke open and they are lost, which was a pity, since they are so shady as you mention. I told the king of the black fox, who taking not much notice of it, I keep it myself, unless you think otherwise to dispose of it.</P>
<P>Care is already taken for the passing your patent for all New-England, and if Mr. Spragg were not in the way, it might have been for the whole new dominion.</P>
<P>Pray, present my humble service to Mr. Mason and let him know Mr. Povey gives him particular instructions by this ship how to proceed regularly. The governour needs not any order from hence to do justice. If Mr. Mason be aggrieved he may appeal.</P>
<P>My humble service likewise to Capt. Nicholson, who I hope may be the lieut. governour intended by the King

for the New-England. Nor let my service be forgot to my cousin Treffry, whose relations are all very well.</P>
<P>Since you are so mindfull of my concerns, the inclosed paper will shew you how the article for the auditors is to be worded. But pray remember the first accompt of the president and councill. It was sent back with severall queries, in order to the satisfying the lords commissioners of the treasury, and I expect your return of it. And you may do well to help Sir E. Andros to dispatch the first ac∣compt since his arrivall, by setting forth every particular, how expended, more minutely than the parchment sent me does contain, that the Lords of the treasury may not except against the method of it.</P>
<P>I send you the gazettes touching the pirates and Sir R. Holmes. The King has granted him all pirates goods for 3 years and the power of pardoning for one year. He offers fair to discoverers and such as surrender themselves, and will certainly make good his promise. An accident on that account may make your fortune, as you are most in the way of that sort of people.</P>

went amongst all the islands in Casco bay, visited Mr. Whar∣ton's possessions at Pejepsgut, and rowed up many leagues in Kennebeck river; from thence, by easy motions, they got to Pemmequid, where he stayed 3 or 4 dayes to refresh themselves with sheep and foules, and then, with the Rose frigott, made towards Ponobscott; his Excellency had sooner, by me before, appointed Capt. George to speake to Monsieur St. Casteen, and to acquaint him with his come∣ing; the captain roade with his frigott before Casteen's doore, sent his lieut. ashoare, Casteen spoake to him and told him, but upon notice of the Governor's comeing, Casteen and all the company retired, left the place to that <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> and left his house shutt; the Governor landed, with other gentlemen with him, and went into the house and found a small altar in the common roome, which altar, and some pictures and ordinary ornaments, they did not meddle with any thing belonging thereto, but tooke away all his armes, powder, shott, iron kettles and some trucking cloath and his chaires, all which were putt aboard the Rose and laid up in order to a condemnation of tradeing, in the forte at Pemmequid; at their returne, notice being irregularly given to the Indian Sachem, neighbour to Casteen, that he should have all his goods restored if he would demand them at Pemmequid and come under obedience to the King, it is supposed he went and acquainted the Governor at Port Royall of it, and how resented we were to expect by the returne of our fishing vessels. This Casteen is a Frenchman, has lived there many yeares, has 3 or 4 Indian wives and goes a hunting with the Indians, he has a tradeing house and sold the Indians, armes and ammunition in the late Indian wars; he does not well like to be under the French government, desires to live indifferent. His Excellency carryed with him carpenters and boards, nailes and all necessary stores, intending to erect a forte at Ponopscutt, the old one, as they say, being gone to ruin, formerly made up with stone and turfe, but finding none there, was resolved to spare that charge till a more proper time offered, and in his Ex∣cellency's

returne from Ponopscutt, 5 or 6 leagues off from thence, I meete the Governor at sea, I being bound to Po∣nopscutt, but I then returned with him to Pemmaquid. The Governor sent out, every way, messengers to summon in all the Indian Sachems; such as were at Pemmaquid at his first arrivall, stayd his returne; they were well treated with shirts, rumm and trucking cloath, but his Excellency, with a short speech, by an interpreter, acquaint∣ed them that they should not fear the French, that he would defend them, and ordered them to call home all their young men and they should live quietly and undi∣sturbed. There I went to one Shurt, town clarke of Pemmequid, to know what leases were made lately and by whom, and for what quitt rent; he told me that above 2 years agoe Capt. Palmer and Mr. West produced to them a commission from Col. Dongan, to dispose of all their land to whoever would take leases at 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> the hundred acres quitt rent; they lett there and at a place called Dart∣mouth, 12 or 16 miles distant from Pemmequid, about 140 leases, some had 800 or 1000 acres, few less than 100, some but 3 or 4 acres, and all paid 2<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 0<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> for passing their grantes of 100 acres of woodland with 20 acres of marsh, wherever it could be found; but this bred a great mischiefe amongst the people, few or none have their land measured or marked, they were in haste and gott what they could; they had their emissaries amongst the poore people and frighted them to take grantes, some came and complained to the Governor and prayed him to confirme their rights, which he refused to doe, the commission and whole proceeding being illegall, having notice they were to be under his government, they resented it, but it served their turne. The poor have been very much oppressed here, the forte run all to ruin and wants a greate deale to repaire it; the Governor has ordered it to be well re∣paired; it stands very well to command a very good bay and harbour about it, and will in time be a good place, being the only good porte for all vessels, eastward, to ride well and secure by the forte from danger. At this time,
<PB N="564" REF="011300_0285_0F86CD40863032B0"/>
Capt. Palmer and Mr. West laid out for themselves such large lotts, and Mr. Graham, tho' not there, had a child's portion, I think some have 8 or 10000 acres; I hear not of one penny rent comeing in to the King from them who have their grants confirmed at Yorke, and this 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> an hundred acres was only a sham upon the people. At our returne, we saw very good land at Winter harbour, enough to make large settlements for many people: The Governor will have it first measured and then surveyed, and then will dispose of it for settlements.</P>
<P>Mr. Graham and his family are settled in Boston, he is made attourny generall and now the Governor is safe in his New Yorke confidents, all others being strangers to his councill. My cousen Mason can make no progress in his business, he has attempted to try his title at Piscataqua, but has been delayed by the judges, and the inhabitants are far more obstinate than formerly, Mr. West haveing told some of them that his title is little worth. All Mr. West aimes at is to have the passing grantes for all Mr. Mason's lands, and neither he nor Graham will allow that he has power to make a grante to any tennant; they are for leiveing him out of all. The newes of the dissenters being indulged and taken into favour, at home, encouraged this people, and the judges will not give a cause for the King. They now dispute his Excellency's grantes and plead either possession or Indian purchase in barr of it. The addition of New Yorke to this government does very much inlarge our bounds and may be of greate service to the crowne, but they have been squeezed dry by Colonell Dongan and his agents West and Graham, that there is little good to be done. We are in greate expectation of Foyes arrivall, and some preparations are makeing for a southarne expedition, but I believe Sir Edmund will not goe into New Yorke till Col. Dongan is removed off the place, there is no good understanding betwixt them, and twas not well done of Palmer and West to tear all in pieces that was settled and granted at Pemmequid by Sir Edmund, that was the sceene where they placed and displaced at

pleasure, and were as arbitrary as the great Turke; some of the first settlers of that easterne country were denyed grants of their own lands, whilst these men have given the improved lands amongst themselves, of which I suppose Mr. Hutchinson has complained.</P>

<SALUTE>Hon. Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THESE are only to returne you thanks for your kind letter dated July 3. 88. It was exceeding welcome to heare from you, and the good aspect that his Majestie hath towards his poor New-England subjects. I hope mine to your selfe, by Capt. Belcher, might come season∣ably; only let me advise not to present any thing by way of complaint to his Majestie, for that I feare will do us more hurt than good; it may be of use to present to friends to shew the reason why we supplicate his Majestie for the confirmation of us in our possessions, and that he will grant us the same privileges that others of his plan∣tations are not denyed, namely a generall assembly, with∣out which our condition is little inferiour to absolute sla∣very. And for my own part, if that cant be obtained, I do not think the change of our governour will ease any thing, for the greater interest at court will add greatly to our burthens, and emboulden him that hath the power in his hand to squease to extremity. I entreat you wholly to conceale my name from those of our own people or others that you confer with, for it may do me much harm and no good to the publick. I shall think long till I hear the issue of matters.</P>
<P>Concerning those matters that I wrote to you about, re∣ferring to myselfe, I have received a letter from my sister that gives mee account the time hath now passed so long
<PB N="566" REF="011300_0286_0F86CD415FB5E3B0"/>
that the matter is hopeless to find out any thing, and there∣fore would not have you give yourself any trouble about it.</P>
<P>Mr. Peter Bulkley dyed about three months since, and verely his sun did set in a cloud.</P>
<P>It hath pleased God again to suffer the natives to do us mischiefe in July last, three or more persons killed at Quackeage on Connecticot river, one man at New Haven, and sundry at the Eastward, some at Kenebeck and Cape Porpos, in all, about twenty six persons killed, so that all the out towns are driven into garrisons, and under great affrightment. Sir Edmund hath lately been at New York, and from thence to Albany, &amp;c. thorow the country, was absent about 11 weeks, and, as I hear, will not allow it to be called a war, but murtherous acts, and he will inquire the grounds; is not pleased that any soldiers were levyed, in his absence, to send eastward, and hath re∣leased from prison Indians that were sent thence, i. e. from eastward. The winter is now upon us, but whether that will occasion the succession of mischiefe I know not, but people are generally much affrayd what will be the issue.</P>
<P>In case something be not obtayned for settlement of pro∣perty and restreyning rigor in making orders, which they call lawe, and levying money, I fear what hath been done at court will exasperate and possibly may double the tale of brick. I am exceeding sensible that it is very difficult for our friends on the place to do much, unless God do in more than ordinary manner inspire the heart of his Ma∣jestie to favour us. Wee are in no capacity to do any thing, not so much as to pay what is of necessity to be done to officers, &amp;c. in case his Majesties favour should be great, nor may wee meet in our severall towns to consider of any thing for our own good, at home or abroad, (as the inclosed copie of their order will shew you, an unheard of tyranny) so that should any disburse for us, I can't, for my own part, see how it can possibly be gained to repay, and yet people are at present in great expectation that, so many of our friends being on the place, something will be gained.</P>

<SALUTE>Rev. Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR loveing lines were with much joy received and read by me, for which I humbly bless God, and return yourselfe many thanks. By reason of the great expectation of your sudden arrivall (with other of your friends) I did willingly omitt writeing unto you by the last opportunity, but now, considering the times are among those things reserved by God to his own dispose, I shall adventure the riske of a few lines, committing yourselfe and my endeavours herein to the good providence of God.</P>
<P>Its now 14 weeks since the revolution of the government here, the manner whereof, before these can reach you, will spread farr and neare; future consequences wee are igno∣rant of, yet wee know that, at present, wee are eased of those great oppressions that wee groaned under, by the ex∣ercise of an arbitrary and illegall commission, some briefe account whereof is contained in the declaration published the same day, a coppie whereof I herewith send you. The busines was acted by the soldiers that came armed into Boston from all parts, to the great amazement of all beholders, being greatly animated by the Prince's declara∣tions, which about that time came into the country, and
<PB N="568" REF="011300_0287_0F86CD42A5D75508"/>
heightened by the oppressions of the governor, judges, and the most wicked extortion of their debauched officers. The ancient magistrates and elders, although they had strenuously advised to further waiting for orders from England, and discouraged any attempts of that nature so farr as they had opportunity, yet were they now com∣pelled to assist with their presence and councells for the prevention of bloodshed, which had most certainly been the issue if prudent counsells had not been given to both parties. A coppie of that paper sent Sir Edm. Andross I have herewith sent you, upon which he forthwith came and surrendered himselfe. The same day, about 30 more of the principall persons of that knot were secured, where∣of some were quickly released, and some yet remaine un∣der restraint, Eight of whom, viz. Mr. Dudley, Sir Ed∣mund, Mr. Randolph, Mr. West, Mr. Palmer, Mr. Grai∣ham, Mr. Sherlock, Mr. Farwell, the representatives of the people, at their last sessions, voted unbailable. Mr. Dudley in a peculiar manner is the object of the peoples displeasure, even thorow out all the colonies where he hath sat judge, they deeply resent his correspondency with that wicked man Mr. Randolph for the overturning the government, and the manner of his procuring his president∣ship, his extream covetousnes, getting to himself so many bags of money, to the ruinating of trade, and since Sir Edmund's arrivall here, hath been his great instrument in the oppression of the people, choosing rather to do that base drudgerie then to displease, and thereby endanger the losse of his honor and gaine. These and such like things have made him vile in the eyes of all generally both good and bad, so that the governor and councill, though they have done their uttermost to procure his inlargement, yet cant prevaile, but the people will have him in the jaile, and when he hath been by their order turned out, by force and tumult they fetch him in againe, and both he and the rest of them there remaine till released by orders from England. I am deeply sensible that we have a wolfe by the ears. This one thing being circumstanced
<PB N="569" REF="011300_0287_0F86CD42A5D75508"/>
with much difficulty, the people will not permitt any in∣largement, they having accused them of treason against their king and country; and those restrained, they, threa∣ten at a high rate for being denyed an habeas corpus. I do therefore earnestly entreat of you to procure the best advice you can in this matter that, if possible, the good in∣tents of the people and their loyalty to the crown of Eng∣land may not turn to their prejudice. The example of England, the declarations put forth by the Prince of Orange, now our King, the alteration of the government in England making the arbitrary commission of Sir Edmund null and void in the law; these considerations, in conjunction with the great oppressions they lay under, were so far prevalent in the minds of all, that although some could not advise to the enterprise, yet are hopefull that we shall not be greatly blamed, but shall have a pardon granted for any error the law will charge us with in this matter. The exercise of Sir Edmund's commission, so contrarie to the magna charta, is surely enough to call him to account by his superiours, and also Mr. Dudley that led the van in that tragedy; and for others of them, may we be quit of them, as we hope for no good from them, so we are farr from desiring to revenge our selves upon them, let what they have met with be a warn∣ing to others how they essay to oppress their Majesties good subjects any more in that kind. I crave an answer hereunto by the first opportunity.</P>
<P>I must also yet a little further acquaint you that sundry of those gentlemen and merchants that were very active in this matter on the day of the revolution yet, since, mis∣sing of what they expected the people universally crying up their charter priviledges and urging the old governor and magistrates to reassume the former government all which they were designed to oppose but had hopes to advance their private interests of which finding themselves now disappointed, are greatly discontented and speake high∣ly against the representatives of the people and present government and, as we are informed, sundry of them, mostly
<PB N="570" REF="011300_0288_0F86CD433A8E6EC8"/>
factors and strangers, have drawn a petition to the lords of the committee for forreign plantations, pretending loyalty and advance of revenue to the crown, and highly inveighing against the government and people, whereas, in truth, they are the transgressors of those acts for trade and navigation, and those whom they complain against are ge∣nerally unconcerned in either, and so uncapable to do the thing they accuse them of. If any thing of this nature be presented, let me intreat you sedulously to divert the mis∣chief intended and send me a coppie thereof by the first opportunity.</P>
<P>Capt. George, commander of the Rose frigott, was also the same day with the rest of that knott seized, reports being spread by sundry of his men, that he intended for France, there to waite on the late King James, and before his departure to shew his spleen against Boston, so that the people were afraid of being murdered and burnt up in their beds, the lieutenant also a known papist. The sails of the frigott are brought on shore and secured till the go∣vernment here receive their Majesty's order, for which deed its hoped we shall not receive blame. We do crave that the circumstances of our case and condition in all res∣pects may be considered. Nature hath taught us selfe preservation: God commands it, as being the rule of cha∣rity towards our neighbour: Our great remotenes from England denys us the opportunity of direction and order from thence for the regulating ourselves in all imergencies, nor have we meanes to know the laws and customes of our nation: These things are our great disadvantage: We have alwayes endeavoured to approve ourselves loyall to the crown of England, and are well assured that none of our worst enemyes dare to tax us in that matter, and we have also laboured to attend the directions of our charter, under the security whereof were laid by our fathers the foun∣dation of this his Majesties colony, and we are not with∣out hopes but that before you do receive these lines we shall receive from their royall Majesties the confirmation of our charter, with such addition of privileges as may ad∣vance
<PB N="571" REF="011300_0288_0F86CD433A8E6EC8"/>
the revenue of the crown, and be an encouragement to their Majesties subjects here. In mean time we shall pray for the long and happie reign of their Majesties, and God's blessing to be on his people in all their three kingdoms.</P>

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY a heady multitude possessed with jealousyes that our Governor, Sir Edmund Andros, was a papist and intended to bring on the French and Indians to cut off the inhabitants, a generall insurrection was intended and so perfected on the 18th of Aprill last, that the Governor, hoping to secure himselfe in our fort, missed an opportu∣nity of going aboard the Rose frigott, then at anchor in the harbour, and so, being overpowered, wee were taken prisoners of warr, as the silly multitude told us. This proceeded from a dayly expectation (that one Mather, one of their ministers in Boston, had raised by his letters to them from court in the height of popery) of a new charter. I know he or any other (having first subscribed to re∣pealing their penall lawes and test) might for their money obtain fair promises of, and he had so far prevailed with Sir Thomas Powis, atturney generall, that he had obtained a report in their favour, upon many false suggestions, which, immediately on the P. of Orange his intending to visit the court of England vanished; however, he had no other engine to draw supplyes of money from the dissatis∣fied party here, but to feed them up with assurances of a
<PB N="572" REF="011300_0289_0F86CD483B413C38"/>
new and much larger charter. They were impatient at his delay and, hearing the newes that all papists were either secured or fled out of England, and would not be∣lieve but Sir Edmund was a papist and his commission ar∣bitrary and calculated onely for the suppressing all persons of a different perswasion; they caballed and accordingly executed their principall resolutions: They have not yet sent to England, expecting Mather, their Mahomett, or at least particular orders from court, which will not operate here unlesse consonant to their humours. We have, at this day, above 100 persons equally concerned as conservators of the peace, but their power signifies nothing, further than it pleases the people; sometymes they are for having their old magistrates reassume their former government; sometymes to form a new modell of government; but their being many more ready (and of necessity disposed) to pull down than build up, they know not what to be att: Some, that have estates and shipping abroad, feare they have done more than they can answer, believing other go∣vernments will treat them as revolters from their alle∣giance, and give them neither protection nor lett them de∣part till they have orders from home how to treat them. This you may please to communicate to the other govern∣ments leeward of you, to whom I have not an opportu∣nity to write, who, I am well assured, will also highly resent it, and so will the present constitution at home, whoever be in the throne, and not suffer so high an in∣dignity to be putt upon the most authentick authority any Prince can give his subjects for their security and pro∣tection, whilst they act by a power confirmed by the broad seal. God onely knowes how affaires stand at home. I am confident they will never part with me, unlesse de∣manded, by a force or their ships stoped in the plantations till I am delivered up for their liberty and licence to trade. This country is poor, the exact execution of the acts of trade hath much impoverished them; all the blame lyes upon me, who first attacked and then overthrew their charter, and was made the officer to continue their Egyp∣tian

servitude, by my office of collector, &amp;c. I intreat you to represent my state to the Earls of Clarendon and Ro∣chester, by the first opportunity, and that the Governor and I may be sent for home by some frigotts. I must confesse there have been ill men from New-York, who have too much studdied the disease of this people, and both in courts and councills they have not been treated well. However, nothing done can amount to countenance such an open rebellion, and, were I in England, I must advise a generall pardon, many hundred of innocent per∣sons being forced to act, otherwise to be imprisoned; and the kingdome of England cannot loose this country nor govern it without some respect and allowance to the weak∣nes of those who are mislead and the force of education and the byas of common prejudices: However, we are, at present, as much distracted and as far from cementing into any sort of government as at the building of Babell. God onely keeps them from destroying us.</P>
<P>You will have one Robert Glanvill from Salem, master of a ketch, he was imprisoned here, for an abettor of py∣rates, and was imprisoned with 7 pyrates, he can tell you their names; he brought into this country 3700 and odd Spanish hides, robb'd from a Portugesse vessell, the men thrown overboard, with other goods to the value of about 2000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> This is all proved by sufficient witnesses and they kept in goal till some particular order from Sir Robert Holmes. About Oct. last, he sent his commission to the Governor and myselfe, dated the 26 Aug. 88. which we receiving not till November, and the Governor and I stay∣ing to the eastward till the limite was past, could not a∣gree upon a method of proceeding against them, in regard they stood upon their justification, but rather, wee could not be assured of a jury that would find against them, up∣on the most evident proofe, but now they are at liberty, have their goods, and perhaps may bring some of the hides, or barrels of small barrs of copper to your island: However, I think the ketch is forfeited for bringing in the pyrates and their goods to this country, knowing the

men to be such, for Glanvill, in his ketch, sayled in com∣pany with the pyrates, in the vessell they tooke, as far as New England; he went to Salem, appointed to meet them at Port a Bear, in Nova Scotia, and did so and carried them supplyes and provisions; when they burned the vessell and brought away the goods in this ketch and other vessels. This I heartily refer to your conduct and privacy, my life lying at stake for the least discovery. I cannot trust Mr. Rudger, father in law to Mr. West, with us, who has been a great instrument in imposing upon this people.</P>

That you have not ere this had an account of our affaires particularly directed unto your selfe, proceeded neither from forgetfullness nor neglect, but solely from our daily expectations of seeing you here, wee being so long time without any intelligence from England. Your providential deteinure behind our friends, who arrived about two months since, wee hope was in mercy, and will turn to our advantage. We under∣stand there seem'd to be an absolute necessity of your ap∣pearance for us. Wee have thought it adviseable to send over our worthy friends Mr. Elisha Cooke and Mr. Tho∣mas Oakes, (who are knowing and well acquainted with all transactions and the state of our affaires) whom wee have joyned in commission with the right hon. Sir Henry Ashurst, knt. and baronet and yourselfe, as our agents and represen∣tatives in England, or so many of you as shall be there re∣sident; and given them instructions. The informations and evidences wee have gathered up against Sir Ed.

Wee expect no less than that they

will greatly asperse and calumniate this people, and endea∣vour to load them with all the infamy imaginable. Wee hope our friends, now sent, will be reasonably provided to take off the most of them, unto whom wee must refer you and to the papers. You will not wonder to see so great a number of that society of men come over, whom wee are glad to get rid of, they having been industriously diligent to interrupt and disturb our publique affaires here to our no small disadvantage. Wee have endeavoured to make some provision by this conveyance for the discharge of our just debts in England, and refer it to yourselfe and others our friends joyned with you in commission, to make some suitable present unto such of those honourable gentlemen who have befriended and assisted our affaires at the court, unto divers of whom wee have written particularly, and sent the letters open, that so you might have the perusal of them. Wee have been necessitated, for the quiet of the people and preservation of the peace, to take the highest steps in administration of government, by trying, condem∣ning and executeing some notorious criminals, found guilty of piracyes and murder, without doing which wee could not have lived, hopeing for a favourable resentment and acceptance of what wee have done therein, and doubt not of your assistance thereto; praying the continuance of your care, paines and labour, to endeavour the full obtain∣ing of all that good you have wished and industriously in∣tended the procureing for us, if the Lord shall please to succeed therein; unto whose gracious guidance and pro∣tection wee heartily commend you, praying that God will mercifully, in his good time, returne you unto us, that wee may see your face againe with joy; and earnestly begging your constant remembrance of us at the throne of grace, that God may graciously guide and conduct us in all the arduous affaires under our hand, so as may be to his glory and our owne and this people's everlasting good and com∣forte, with the tenders of our unfeigned respects, wee subscribe,</P>
