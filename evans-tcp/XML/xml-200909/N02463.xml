<HEAD>REMARKS UPON THE <HI>Earthquake.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Night</HI> that followed the Twenty ninth of <HI>October</HI> [1727.] was a <HI>Night</HI> whereto NEW-ENGLAND had never in the Memory of Man, seen the like before. The <HI>Air</HI> never more <HI>Calm,</HI> the <HI>Sky</HI> never more <HI>Fair;</HI> every thing in all imaginable Tran∣quillity: But about a quarter of an Hour before Eleven, there was heard in BOSTON, passing from one end of the Town to the other, an horrid rumbling like the Noise of many Coaches together, driving on the paved Stones with the utmost Rapidity. But it was attended with a most awful <HI>Trembling of the Earth,</HI> which did heave and shake so as to Rocque the Houses, and cause here and there the falling of some smaller Things, both within Doors and without. It cannot be imagined, but that it gave an un∣common Concern unto all the Inhabitants, and even a degree of Consternation, unto very ma∣ny
<PB N="2" REF="002919_0004_0FE6966739570BF0"/>of them. This <HI>first Shock,</HI> which was the most Violent, was followed with several others, and some Repetition of the Noise, at sundry times, pretty distant from one another. The Number of them is not entirely agreed; but at least Four or Five are allow'd for; The last of which was be∣tween Five and Six of the Clock in the Morning.</P>
<P>How far this <HI>Earthquake</HI> extended thro' the Countrey, we are not yet informed; but that it extended Scores of Miles, we have already a certain Information. And what added unto the Terrors of it, were the terrible Flames and Lights, in the Atmosphere, which accompani∣ed it. The Vessels on the Coast, were also made sensible of it, by a shivering that siezed on them.</P>
<P>When the greatly affected People, had a little Opportunity to look about them in the Morn∣ing, the Pastors of the <HI>Old North Church,</HI> directed the <HI>Bells</HI> to be rung, that such of the People as could and would, might assemble immediately unto some seasonable Exercises of Religion. The Pastors of the <HI>New</HI> joined with them in sending up unto Heaven, the Supplications which the solemn Occasion called for. And the Pastors in the other part of the Town, made a speedy and hearty Appearance, and most affec∣tionately united in a Concurrence with them. The Assembly that came together, did more than croud and fill the most capacious of our Meetinghouses; And as there was a multitude of serious Christians, who are acquainted with
<PB N="3" REF="002919_0005_0FE696675946C788"/><HI>Real</HI> and <HI>Vital</HI> PIETY, so the whole Auditory expressed a Devotion which was truly Extraor∣dinary.</P>
<P>When these Exercises were finished about Two in the Afternoon, after some short Inter∣raission of an Hour or Two, several Churches in the other part of the Town, followed the Exemple, and with vast Congregations, conti∣nued the proper Exercises of Religion, until a∣bout Eight a Clock in the Evening. For the Animation thereof, there was not only the joint Inclination of the <HI>Pastors</HI> and the <HI>People,</HI> but likewise a Recommendation from His Honour the L. GOVERNOUR; Whose <HI>Piety,</HI> ever discovered on every other, as well as this, Oc∣casion, disposed him, to Direct also the keeping of the <HI>Thursday</HI> following (which is the Day of the usual weekly Lecture,) as a Day of SUP∣PLICATIONS in all the Churches of the City.</P>
<P>In the Year 1580. <HI>England</HI> felt an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> which tho' no considerable Damage was done by it, awakened the Government of the Nation, to call upon all the Subjects throughout the Kingdom, to be fervent and instant in Prayer, that the Wrath of GOD whereof the <HI>Earthquake</HI> was a <HI>Token,</HI> might be averted from the Land. Such a Disposition possesses our <HI>Commander in Chief,</HI> and his People most readily come into it.</P>
<P>One of the MINISTERS, who did their part, in the Great Assembly of the Morning judg'd it Expedient, yea, Necessary, that PRAYER
<PB N="4" REF="002919_0006_0FE6967149A89090"/>should have the WORD accompanying of it. He thought, that if ever he did <HI>preach the Word IN SEASON,</HI> he should now do so, by taking the Present SEASON to render the <HI>Voice</HI> of the Glorious GOD, in the EARTHQUAKE, while it was yet scarce over, Articulate and In∣telligible unto the Hearers: 'Twould be Em∣phatically, A WORD IN SEASON. And he hop'd, that <HI>Hearts made soft</HI> by the ALMIGH∣TY <HI>Troubling</HI> of them with the Occurrences of the Night before, would be more likely than ever, to receive Good Impressions, and be moulded into durable Resolutions of Godliness; Yea, that as the primitive <HI>Outpouring</HI> of the Ho∣ly SPIRIT, was attended with an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> so the EARTHQUAKE would now be attend∣ed with such on <HI>Out-pouring</HI> of the Holy SPI∣RIT as would make an Holy, and so an Happy People. Accordingly, with the Divine Assist∣ance, he made a SPEECH, [or, if you please, A SERMON,] which was no sooner offered in the Assembly of <HI>Zion</HI> there convened. but it was desired, that it might be further offered in the way of the Press, for the Service of PIETY, not only here, but in other parts of the Land, which <HI>GOD makes to Tremble.</HI> He durst not re∣ject the Desire. Tis true, There can be expect∣ed none but a mean Preparation, from a few Minutes of a Morning filled with Disturbances; which may be an Apology for the Deficiencies which a curious Reader may soon discover in it.
<PB N="5" REF="002919_0007_0FE696716324CBB0"/>But our Gracious GOD is pleased sometimes to make use of <HI>such,</HI> to do Good in the World; that so, <HI>Man</HI> may be Nothing, and HE may be <HI>All in All.</HI> Tis not possible for him to give Word for Word, a Discourse which he could have no Time to Write, before it was delivered. But it is here without many material <HI>Additions,</HI> &amp; per∣haps, with some Forgetful <HI>Substractions,</HI> Exhibited as very near as can well be asked for, to what was delivered.</P>
<P>O! May the Holy SPIRIT of our GOD, make it come with <HI>Efficacy!</HI></P>
<P>We find, the <HI>Hill</HI> on the North side whereof <HI>Joshua</HI> was buried, had [Josh. XXIV. 30.] the Name of, <HI>Har-Gayash;</HI> which Name signifies, <HI>The Mountain of Trembling.</HI> The Jews have a Tradition, That at the Time of his Burial, the <HI>Mountain Trembled</HI> with an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> to testify the Displeasure of GOD against the People. My Friends, We approach as to an <HI>Har-Gayash,</HI> in what is now to be set before us.</P>

<HEAD>A SPEECH, Made by One of the Ministers, to the Inhabitants of BOSTON; Assembled the Morning after the EARTH∣QUAKE. <HI>Octo.</HI> 30. 1727.</HEAD>
<P>THE Glorious GOD has <HI>Roared out of Zion.</HI> We have the last Night heard the terrible <HI>Roaring;</HI> with general and uncommon Terror, heard the awful Repetition of it. Who is here of you, among them who felt the <HI>Earth trembling</HI> under them, that said not upon it, <HI>When I heard, my Lips quivered at the Voice, and I trembled in my self, that I might find Rest in the Day of Trouble!</HI> Who is there that said not, <HI>Lord, my Flesh trem∣bles for fear of Thee, and I am afraid of thy Judg∣ments!</HI> The <HI>Lion hath roared; Who will not fear?</HI> We are worse than <HI>Beasts,</HI> if we <HI>tremble</HI> not.</P>
<P>Never did the City of BOSTON, in the Ninety seven Years that have rolled over it, see
<PB N="7" REF="002919_0009_0FE696798DC160A8"/>such a <HI>Night,</HI> as what we saw a few Hours ago. A MIDNIGHT CRY was heard; The Con∣sternation whereof is not this Morning over with us; An <HI>Auguish</HI> like that on a <HI>Travailing Woman,</HI> siezed upon <HI>Men</HI> as well as <HI>Women.</HI> What <HI>Fear,</HI> from the Apprehension of going to the <HI>Pil,</HI> by a stroke like a <HI>suare</HI> upon us!</P>
<P>We have had the repeted, more than three times repeted <HI>Shocks,</HI> of a Formidable EARTH∣QUAKE. And GOD knows, whether there are any more to come, or what Execution they may do, when they come.</P>
<P>When the never-to-be-forgotten <HI>Sicilian</HI> EARTHQUAKE in our Days, had given some <HI>Shocks</HI> which only terrified the People, after an Intermission of Two Days, there came on those, which horribly destroy'd them; A <HI>Bosom of De∣struction</HI> that swept away near one hundred and fifty Thousand of them.</P>
<P>The Ancient Cry of the <HI>Prophets,</HI> is now most certainly the Cry of our <HI>Earthquakes;</HI> Hos. X. 12. <HI>It is Time to seek the Lord.</HI> The poor Popish <HI>Idolaters,</HI> in their <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> make their Proces∣sions &amp; their Addresses to, <HI>Lying Vanities,</HI> &amp; silly gods that <HI>cannot save</HI> them; <HI>They cry, but there is none to save them!</HI> We will <HI>walk in the Name of</HI> JEHOVA-JESUS, <HI>who is our</HI> only GOD, as those unhappy Creatures <HI>walk in the Name</HI> of Theirs. <HI>Their Rock is not as our Rock;</HI> We have a SAVIOUR, in whom we find a sufficient <HI>Re∣fuge,</HI> for us, and a <HI>very present Help in Trouble,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="002919_0010_0FE69672EB875368"/>when the <HI>Earth is moved</HI> under us, and the <HI>Moun∣tains are shaking</HI> about us. We will invert the Order of the <HI>Eighteenth Psalm;</HI> The Psalmist said, <HI>In my Distress I called on the Lord, and cried unto my GOD, Then the Earth shook and trembled.</HI> We will say, <HI>Since the Earth shakes and trembles; Now in our Distress we will call on the Lord, and cry unto our GOD.</HI> It is with pleasure that I read in <HI>Eusebius,</HI> a Letter of <HI>Antoninus,</HI> who was a stran∣ger to the True GOD, but yet complains, That the <HI>Pagan</HI> urged him to persecute the <HI>Christians;</HI> <Q>Whereas (he says) I understand, that they are a good People, and whenever there happens an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> their Course is to go and pray unto their GOD, that His Wrath may be turned away from us; And in this they show more of Religion than the People that urge me to destroy them!</Q> We are this Day doing what the <HI>Primitive Christians</HI> did, and what all <HI>Genuine Christians</HI> will.</P>
<P>We have Two <HI>Occasions,</HI> to repair unto our gracious GOD; we have Two <HI>Petitions</HI> to carry unto Him. The one is, That we may have the Grace to <HI>know,</HI> and to <HI>do,</HI> the <HI>Duties,</HI> which the <HI>Earthquake</HI> does in its hideous Rumbles most sen∣sible call us to. The other is; That there may be no such <HI>Returns</HI> of the <HI>Earthquake</HI> as to lay us in Desolations, and make our <HI>Plagues wonderful.</HI> But, the <HI>success</HI> of our Supplications, will very much turn upon our Attention to the Voice of our glorious GOD in the <HI>Earthquake</HI> which is
<PB N="9" REF="002919_0011_0FE696A1DAECDE38"/>now affrighting of us. Don't we remember those Divine <HI>Retaliations; As He cried, and they would not hear, so they cried and I would not hear, saith the Lord of Hosts.</HI> And again, <HI>Because I called, and ye refused, I will laugh at your Calamity, and I will mock when your Fear cometh; when your Fear cometh as Desolatioa, and your Destruction corn∣eth as a Whirlwind; when Distress and Anguish cometh upon you?</HI> Yea, I may say unto you, The <HI>Dispositions</HI> of PIETY, will be so many <HI>Supplica∣tions;</HI> and indeed, the best sort of <HI>Supplications,</HI> the most proper and the most potent <HI>Supplicati∣ons;</HI> There are <HI>pure Hands lifted up</HI> in our <HI>Suppli∣cations</HI> when we <HI>Do</HI> what our GOD has oblig'd us to.</P>
<P>Wherefore, as a Praeliminary, and as a Foun∣dation to the Discourse, wherewith I propose to treat you, the TEXT which I now pitch upon is That;</P>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Mic. VI. 9.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The Voice of the LORD, crieth unto the City.</P></Q>
<P>CErtainly, you will not expect, that I should spend any time in proving, That there is a VOICE of the glorious GOD, in all that He <HI>does,</HI> in the World. All the <HI>Works</HI> of <HI>Creation,</HI> and all the <HI>Works</HI> of <HI>Providence,</HI> there is a <HI>Voice</HI> of the glorious GOD in them. He <HI>speaks</HI> in all
<PB N="10" REF="002919_0012_0FE69679A72B7F10"/>that He <HI>does.</HI> And there is no place, where their <HI>Voice</HI> may not be <HI>beard.</HI> O <HI>Deaf</HI> we, if we hear it not! — That <HI>Voice, — O Love,</HI> O <HI>Ad∣mire, O Adore, the glorious One, who does all these things. O Fear this GOD, and give Glory unto Him!</HI></P>
<P>'Tis very sure; In the <HI>Works</HI> wherein the glorious GOD goes out of the <HI>Ordinary Road,</HI> or, His <HI>Extraordinary Dispensations;</HI> In these, His <HI>Voice</HI> becomes very Notable; and most inexcu∣sable are they who <HI>Regard not the Works of the Lord, nor the Operation of His Hands: He shall de∣stroy them, and not build them up.</HI></P>
<P>EARTHQUAKES are such <HI>Works.</HI> We read, Psal. XXIX. 8. <HI>The Voice of the Lord shakes the Wilderness.</HI> There is the <HI>Voice of the Lord,</HI> in it, when He <HI>shakes</HI> our Territories. — There may be some <HI>Earthquakes</HI> more <HI>Supernatural</HI> than others: We reckon that of Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> One; And so we reckon that at the <HI>Resurrection</HI> of our Blessed JE∣SUS; and yet more conspicuously that of His <HI>Crucifixion.</HI> The <HI>split Rocks</HI> at this Day observed by Travellers who are <HI>Protestants,</HI> and somewhat Nice in their Credulity, are thought by some no Injudicious Men, to be the lasting Monu∣ments and Memorials of it. But usually, our <HI>Earthquakes</HI> have <HI>Natural Causes</HI> assigned for them. What they are, 'tis now and here, nei∣ther a Time nor Place for Philosophical Disqui∣sitions. Whether <HI>Colluctations</HI> of <HI>Minerals</HI> pro∣ducing Vapours that must have an Explosion,
<PB N="11" REF="002919_0013_0FE696A1F6E738B8"/>may cause those direful Convulsions in the Bow∣els of the Earth, which are selt in our <HI>Earth∣quakes?</HI> — Or, whether the huge quantities of <HI>Waters,</HI> running in the Bowels of the Earth, may not by Degrees wash away the Bottom of the upper <HI>Strate</HI> here and there, so as to cause their falling in? —Or, whether the <HI>Subterraneous Fires,</HI> getting head, may not by their Sulphureous and Bituminous Exhalations in the Bowels of the Earth, cause a Combustion that may carry all before it? — Or, whether — But it must be something more <HI>Theological,</HI> that you are now to be treated with. Let the <HI>Natural Causes</HI> of <HI>Earth∣quakes</HI> be what the <HI>Wise Men of Euquiry</HI> please, <HI>They</HI> and their <HI>Causes</HI> are still under the Govern∣ment of HIM that is the <HI>GOD of Nature.</HI> Shall we say, All this is but a <HI>Chance that happens to us,</HI> or the meer unguided <HI>Motion</HI> of <HI>Matter?</HI> Ah, profane <HI>Philistine!</HI> — 'Tis a Language for none but a <HI>Philistine.</HI> A <HI>Christian</HI> cannot speak so; No, He is one that will be sensible of GOD in these things. Verily, In them, <HI>Lo, GOD sends forth His Voice, and that a mighty Voice</HI> unto us.</P>
<P>You will yet less expect, that I should be at any pains, for proving, That this VOICE of the glorious GOD, is to be hearken'd to. When the <HI>great GOD who formed all things,</HI> will please to <HI>utter His Voice,</HI> What? Shall it not by all that have the Faculties of <HI>Reason</HI> in them rendring them capable of hearkening to it, be hearken'd to? O most <HI>unreasonable!</HI> GOD our Maker
<PB N="12" REF="002919_0014_0FE6967BF9873410"/>says, <HI>Unto you, O Men, I call, and my Voice is unto the Sons of Men.</HI> We are <HI>Bruits</HI> rather than <HI>Men,</HI> and <HI>Colts of the wild Ass,</HI> yea, <HI>Children of the wick∣ed One,</HI> rather than the <HI>Sons of Men,</HI> if we do not hearken to the <HI>Voice</HI> of his Eternal <HI>Wisdom.</HI> He will not own us, for the <HI>People of His Pasture, and the Sheep of His Hand,</HI> if we do not even <HI>To Day bear His Voice.</HI> An hardy <HI>Pharaoh</HI> may say, Exod. V. 2. <HI>Who is the Lord, that I should Obey His Voice!</HI> Words to come from the Mouth of none but a <HI>Pharaob,</HI> and a <HI>Devil!</HI> But, Ah, <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> ah! Monster, The Almighty GOD, whom thou so insultest, and whose <HI>Voice</HI> thou so defiest, what will the affronted JEHOVAH do unto thee! <HI>What will He do unto thee!</HI></P>
<P>Indeed there is this Argument for hearkening to the <HI>Voice</HI> of our GOD, that if we do it not, we provoke Him to <HI>Render His Rebukes in Flames of Fire</HI> unto us; We provoke Him, to inflict <HI>great Plagues and of long continuance</HI> upon us. If we do not hearken to His <HI>Voice,</HI> especially in His <HI>Casti∣gatory Dealings</HI> with us, — He says, <HI>If ye will not hearken unto me, I will punish you yet seven times more for your Sins.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore, Be now at length effectually <HI>Alarmed,</HI> O Inhabitants of BOSTON, yea, and of the whole Countrey whereof this is the <HI>Me∣tropolis.</HI> What a <HI>Trial,</HI> Yea, what a Gradu∣ally descending <HI>Trial,</HI> is our glorious GOD making of us, whether we will <HI>hearken to His Voice</HI> or no? A few Months ago, how fearfully did
<PB N="13" REF="002919_0015_0FE696AAE6B6D7C8"/>we see the Heavens blazing over us, with Corus∣cations that fill'd People with a <HI>fearful Expecta∣tion</HI> of the <HI>fiery Indignation</HI> which is anon to <HI>devour the Adversaries</HI> of GOD! And how frequently did loud <HI>Thunder-Claps</HI> rouse us out of our Le∣thargies! How frequently did hot <HI>Thunderbolts</HI> fall where many Objects felt the Force of an <HI>Arm</HI> which, <HI>What can stand before?</HI> But, alas, Did we <HI>bear Attentively,</HI> and Obediently, the <HI>Noise of Hu Voice,</HI> or, Mind as we should have done, the <HI>Sound that went out of His Mouth?</HI> Af∣ter this, The <HI>Stormy Wind which fulfils His Word,</HI> came rushing down upon us. We saw an <HI>Horri∣ble Tempest.</HI> A <HI>Storm</HI> came, which tore up the Trees of our Fields by the roots; tore down parts of our Houses; Yea, Wounded and Kil∣led some of our People. The <HI>great and strong Wind</HI> which <HI>rent the Mountains,</HI> had a <HI>Voice</HI> in it. Indeed, it was not a <HI>still small Voice;</HI> but was it therefore the less to be hearken'd to? And now, <HI>After the Wind an Earthquake!</HI>—Oh! Let it not be said, <HI>The Lord was not in the Earth∣quake.</HI> Our GOD says, <HI>Now surely, they will fear me, and they will receive Instruction;—that I may not proceed unto a more dreadful Extremity, and cut off their Dwellings, and them with and in their Dwellings!</HI></P>
<P>What I am now therefore to proceed unto, is the Consideration of that CASE.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="002919_0016_0FE6967C1A5B6020"/>
<HI>What may be the VOICE of the glorious GOD unto us, in the EARTHQUAKE, wherein we have bad the Earth just now trembling under us?</HI></P>
<P>O People <HI>Trembling</HI> before the Lord; <HI>Hear now my SPEECH, and hearken to all my Words.</HI> For indeed, I may declare unto you, The <HI>open∣ing of my Lips will be of Right Things;</HI> and you will not <HI>understand Wisdom,</HI> nor be <HI>of an understan∣ding Heart,</HI> if you do not hearken to them.</P>
<P N="1">I. The VOICE of the glorious GOD <HI>crying to the City</HI> in His <HI>Earthquake</HI> is This; O Glorify the <HI>Perfections</HI> of the glorious GOD, which are display'd in the <HI>Earthquake;</HI> And very particulary, the <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> which He displays when He causes the <HI>Earth,</HI> and the Inhabitants thereof, to tremble before Him.</P>
<P>Syrs, Don't you <HI>clearly see</HI> the <HI>Eternal Power and Godhead</HI> of Him, who can <HI>shake the Earth,</HI> yea, shake it all to pieces at His Pleasure? Oh! see it, and <HI>shake</HI> before it! As when He <HI>sets fast the Mountains,</HI> He shows that He is <HI>Girded with Power;</HI> So, when He <HI>shakes the Mountains</HI> He shows that He has a <HI>Girdle</HI> of matchless <HI>Power.</HI> This whole <HI>Globe,</HI> tho' the Ambit of it be more than Twenty four Thousand and Nine Hundred Miles, and in the solid Content must be more than Two Hundred and Sixty one Thousands of Millions, yet it is no more than the <HI>light Dust of
<PB N="15" REF="002919_0017_0FE696AB052959A0"/>the Balance,</HI> in the Hand of the glorious GOD; who made it, and can Tear it and Rend it as He pleases. In our <HI>Earthquake,</HI> the great GOD, says to us, yea, to the greatest of Men, with an infinitely greater Claim, than a Roman Gover∣nour could speak so, to any Man, <HI>Knowest thou not that I have power over thee, to put thee to Death, or save thee alive?</HI> We cannot but own His Ab∣solute and Sovereign <HI>Dominion</HI> over us, and our Lives, and if He go to extinguish our Lives by an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> we must own, <HI>We are in the House of the Potter, and Lord, Thou mayst break us and lodge us where thou pleasest.</HI> But at the same time, the <HI>Earthquake</HI> proclaims the Irresistible POWER, where with He can <HI>Crush a World,</HI> (as He <HI>made</HI> it) with a <HI>Word.</HI> If He touch the Earth, it shivers and crumbles before Him. <HI>The Finger of GOD,</HI> it can rip open the Earth, and cause <HI>Castles,</HI> and <HI>Cities,</HI> and the largest of <HI>Territories</HI> to sink into it in a Moment. <HI>Lords who knows the power of thine Anger!</HI>—O all you that <HI>go on still in your Trespasses</HI> and persist impenitently in Rebellion against the glorious GOD; What are you but <HI>Fighters against GOD?</HI> What mean you, O Fool-hardy Wretches? Dare you <HI>provoke</HI> Him who is Lord <HI>GOD Ominipotent?</HI> Are you <HI>stronger than He?</HI> O <HI>Tremble</HI> to continue under the <HI>Wrath of the Almighty.</HI> The <HI>Trembling Earth</HI> calls upon you; O <HI>Fear Him, that is able to destroy!</HI> Fear Him, on whose order for it, <HI>Earth, open thy Mouth!</HI> you you presently go down into the Pit; you are swal∣lowed up in a Moment!</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="002919_0018_0FE696840748C2E8"/>
But then, O the <HI>Mercy</HI> of our GOD! In the midst of the <HI>Lamentations</HI> and <HI>Ejulations</HI> caused by the <HI>Earthquake,</HI> yet we are to make that Con∣fession, and, Oh! make it with wonderment; <HI>Lord, It is of thy Mercy that we are not consumed!</HI> If we had our <HI>Desert,</HI> what would an <HI>Earthquake</HI> presently do unto us! Our <HI>Hearts</HI> are so <HI>Earth∣ly,</HI> that we <HI>deserve</HI> to be buried in the <HI>Earth.</HI> We Bury our selves in it, while we neglect our Souls thro' the pursuits and hurries of it. A jealous GOD may justly say of us; <HI>Let the Earth swal∣low them up; It has already swallow'd them up. They have changed their Center; The Earth is become their Center. Let them go down unto their Center!</HI> We have such a share in the <HI>Sins</HI> of them who dwell on the <HI>Earth,</HI> which have made the <HI>Earth</HI> ob∣noxious unto <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> that we cannot com∣plain of being unjustly dealt withal, if we have our <HI>share</HI> in their <HI>Woes.</HI> By the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> with which the <HI>Earth</HI> has been <HI>visited by the Lord of Hosts,</HI> multitudes have <HI>perished wonderfully.</HI> That <HI>we</HI> have not, this lays Obligations upon us, for continual Acclamations, <HI>Oh! The patience of a GOD slow to Anger and plenteous in Mercy! Oh! the Riches of His Goodness and Forbearance, and long-suffering!</HI> I pray, what are we better than any of them? <HI>Josephus</HI> writes of a dismal <HI>Earthquake,</HI> wherein <HI>Judaea</HI> was horribly shaken, and near Ten Thousand People were slain by the fall of Houses upon them. 'Tis likely that in that <HI>Earthquake,</HI> a Towre built over the <HI>Portico's</HI> at the
<PB N="17" REF="002919_0019_0FE696AC6C339510"/>Poll of <HI>Bethesda</HI> fell, and slew <HI>Eighteen</HI> that were there waiting for a Cure. Now, have you for∣gotten what our SAVIOUR said about <HI>those Eighteen upon whom the Tower of Siloam fell?</HI> This, This is what He now says unto us. <HI>Think ye, that all they who have perished in Earthquakes were Sin∣vers above all the Men that are yet walking on the Earth? I tell you, No; You are all of you so very sinful, that you deserve to perish, as much as many of those.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! Let us be deeply affected, with the <HI>spar∣ing Mercy</HI> of our GOD unto us. <HI>Behold the Com∣passion and Severity of GOD! Severity</HI> to them who have <HI>perished</HI> in <HI>Earthquakes;</HI> But <HI>Compassion</HI> towards thee, who hast not so <HI>perished.</HI> — <HI>Lord, why am I spared, and yet standing on the Earth before thee! Why, why does thy Earth yet bear such a Sin∣ner against thee upon it!</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. The VOICE of the glorious GOD <HI>crying to the City</HI> in His <HI>Earthquake,</HI> is, This; Let the <HI>Crimes</HI> that Cry to the Holy GOD for all the Vengeance of an <HI>Earthquake</HI> upon you, be gene∣rally and thoroughly <HI>Reformed</HI> among you.</P>
<P>The Cry is, REFORMATION, O <HI>Degene∣rating Plants,</HI> REFORMATION; <HI>or more Evil to come upon you!</HI></P>
<P>'Tis no fond <HI>Superstition</HI> to think, An <HI>Earth∣quake</HI> usually carries in it, some Intimation of the <HI>Divine Displeasure;</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Token</HI> which we who <HI>dwell in the Wilderness</HI> may be <HI>afraid</HI> of. If God
<PB N="18" REF="002919_0020_0FE6968420C4A430"/><HI>overturn the Mountains</HI> as He does in <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> 'tis in His <HI>Anger</HI> that He does it. If the <HI>Earth Tremble,</HI> as it does in <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> 'tis <HI>at His Wrath,</HI> that it does so. When the <HI>Mountains quake,</HI> as they do in <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> 'tis from His <HI>Indignation.</HI> It was declared concerning some <HI>Tents of Wicked Men;</HI> Num. XV. 30. <HI>If the Earth open its Mouth, and swellow them up, and they go down alive into the Pit, you shall understand that these Men have provoked the Lord.</HI> Yea, If no Body be kill'd in the <HI>Earth∣quake,</HI> yet the <HI>Divine Displeasure</HI> against Sin, is to be apprehended in it. By such an <HI>Earthquake</HI> did the Father of our Blessed Jesus testify something of His Resentment, upon the Wickedness of the Jews, when, <HI>All their Wickedness was in Golgotha:</HI> The most nefandous Wickedness that was ever perpetrated! Rarely an <HI>Earthquake</HI> sent any where, till a People have <HI>sinned grievously.</HI> If we search for the <HI>Moral Causes</HI> of an <HI>Eartiquake,</HI> a Prophet of GOD has declared them; Isa. XXIV. <HI>5. The Earth is defiled under the Inhabitants thereof.</HI></P>
<P>And shall I now <HI>Cry aloud, and spare not, but lift up my Voice like a Trumpet,</HI> and <HI>show</HI> unto you, O our People, that you have <HI>sinned grievously?</HI> 'Tis true, Our People are not for the most part so Abandoned unto <HI>Immoralities,</HI> as they are in many Ungospellized, or Apostatized and Anti∣christian Regions. But our <HI>Faults</HI> are aggrava∣ted into <HI>Crimes,</HI> because we sin under, and against the <HI>glorious Gospel of the Blessed GOD.</HI> We <HI>Rebel against the light</HI> in what we do amiss; and a <HI>light</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="002919_0021_0FE696AC8CFD8020"/>which teaches us, &amp; quickens us, &amp; gives us ma∣ny Advantages, to be the <HI>best People</HI> in the World. If we are not the <HI>Best People</HI> on the Face of the <HI>Earth,</HI> it must not be wondered at, if the <HI>Earth</HI> do <HI>Groan,</HI> in the Murmurs of <HI>Earthquakes</HI> under us. It has been thought by some, that <HI>Earth∣quakes</HI> are not mentioned among the <HI>Plagues</HI> in the <HI>Twenty Eighth</HI> Chapter of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> be∣cause of a Transcendency in this beyond all o∣ther <HI>Plagues,</HI> [It is impossible to contrive any Defence against it; but it says, <HI>Tho' they hide in the top of Carmel, I will find them there!]</HI> which renders it a more proper Vengeance for Sins un∣der the <HI>Evangelical Dispensation.</HI> Our Sins are such. But Oh! What a <HI>Black List</HI> is there to be formed of them!</P>
<P>[I see none <HI>Asleep</HI> at this Time. 'Tis a Con∣gregation of <HI>Hearers,</HI> that I am this Time speak∣ing to. This very circumstance <HI>awakens</HI> a Thought in me; That <HI>sleeping</HI> in the Assemblies of Zion, when it is Indulged, and not a meer Invo∣luntary surprisal upon Insirmity, 'tis <HI>utterly a Fault,</HI> &amp; offfers an Affront unto Heaven: But it is a very <HI>Epidemical Miscorriage</HI> in the Countrey. Now, Syrs, You have an <HI>Earthquake</HI> to give you a push like that of the <HI>Goads</HI> given of old, by the <HI>Masters of the Assemblies,</HI> for the <HI>Awaking</HI> of the Drowsy <HI>Sleepers</HI> there. An <HI>Earthquake</HI> is crying in your Ears, <HI>What meanest thou, O Sleeper in the House of GOD? Oh! No more sleeping in this dreadful place! It may soon be made so.]</HI> I can go on, and be heard.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="002919_0022_0FE696858868E888"/>
How do the Sins of <HI>Intemperance</HI> grow upon us! 'Tis the Description of an <HI>Earthquake, The Earth reels to and fro like a Drunken Man.</HI> How does it call for an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> when the <HI>Earth</HI> can show so many ugly pictures of such a Thing, in <HI>Drunken Men reeling to and fro upon it!</HI></P>
<P>How do the Sins of <HI>Unchastity</HI> under the <HI>Curse</HI> of Heaven <HI>Increase and Multiply</HI> among us? The Cities which GOD <HI>overthrew in His Anger,</HI> and sunk for the compass of Eighteen Miles in Breadth and Eighty Miles in Length, and are covered with a Lake that is called, <HI>The Dead Sea:</HI> Was there not an <HI>Earthquake</HI> that help'd in the <HI>over∣throwing</HI> of them? If an <HI>Earthquake</HI> do unspeak∣able things upon us, let the Impurities of <HI>Sodom</HI> stand indicted for it.</P>
<P>How do the Sins of <HI>Dishonesty</HI> bring an abomi∣nable scandal on our Profession; and the <HI>perni∣cious ways</HI> thereof, make the <HI>way of Truth</HI> to be <HI>evil spoken of?</HI> The Habitations, that are not <HI>Habitations of Righteouswess,</HI> but built, or fill'd, or sed, by <HI>Dishonest Gain,</HI> 'tis not wrong, if the <HI>Earth</HI> don't bear them to stand upon it. GOD sends an <HI>Earthquake</HI> to demolish the Nests that have been <HI>Feathered</HI> with so much <HI>Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>To these Miscarriages may we not annume∣rate the Lust of Excesses and Vanities in <HI>Appar∣el;</HI> the <HI>Costly Pride</HI> whereof is a Temptation to take Indirect ways, for the supporting of it? The <HI>Earthquake</HI> says to us, <HI>Put off some of your Orna∣ments!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="002919_0023_0FE696B62B089A00"/>
And shall the Cry of <HI>Defrauded Labourers,</HI> be stifled? I am sure, the <HI>Pulpit</HI> may speak of them; the <HI>Earthquake</HI> does it.</P>
<P>How are we in regard of <HI>Sabbatizing?</HI> The Right and High Strain of it, how is it sadly de∣cay'd with us? An Offended GOD by an <HI>Earth∣quake</HI> has not suffered us to take the <HI>Rest,</HI> into which we were composing our selves; has fetch'd us out of our Beds, and made us unca∣pable of enjoying our usual <HI>Rest.</HI> Most Equally punished! We have wretchedly Violated the <HI>Rest</HI> of GOD, by our Profanantions of the <HI>Holy Sabbath,</HI> with which He has favoured us.</P>
<P>The <HI>Evenlng</HI> that follows the <HI>Lord's Day!</HI>— I do not plead for holding it properly a part of the <HI>Holy Time</HI> that belongs to the <HI>Christian Sab∣bath.</HI> Not only the <HI>Scripture,</HI> but also the <HI>Practice</HI> of the whole Church in all Ages and in all Pla∣ces, have ever made the <HI>Evening</HI> that precedes the <HI>Lord's-Day,</HI> to be a <HI>part</HI> of it; until a cer∣tain Writer in <HI>Switzerland</HI> a little while ago, started that Opinion for another <HI>Beginning of the Sabbath,</HI> which now so many run into. But yet, I hope, I may plead, That <HI>this Evening</HI> may not be prostituted unto such <HI>Vile Purposes,</HI> as to spoil and lose all the <HI>Good</HI> of the Day; And that there may no more be such a <HI>Quick Transi∣tion</HI> as there often is, from the <HI>Exercises</HI> of <HI>God∣liness,</HI> to all Ungodly Vanities and Lewdnesses. It is complained, That there is more Sin com∣mitted on that <HI>Evening</HI> among us, than in any
<PB N="22" REF="002919_0024_0FE69685A2F0FDF8"/><HI>Evening</HI> of all the Week beside. <HI>Young People,</HI> Where were you, and what was it that you did last Night? And in what Airs did the <HI>Earth∣quake</HI> find you? Verily, Syrs; The Glorious GOD has taken the most <HI>Suitable Evening</HI> that could have been taken, to send an <HI>Earthquake</HI> upon us. A Time, how <HI>Indigitating!</HI> What He <HI>speaks</HI> to us, what He <HI>points</HI> to us, is plainly This. <HI>Let the Evening that ensues upon my Day, be better spent than it use to be. Spend it more in Employments, that may be agreeable and serviceable unto the Inten∣tions of my Day that is then Expiring with you.</HI> Oh! That <HI>House-keepers</HI> would restrain those that are <HI>within their Gates,</HI> from going out of them, and assign them those Things to do, which may be most useful to them. [The <HI>Societies of Young Men</HI> meeting to Worship GOD and Edify one ano∣ther, on this <HI>Evening,</HI> how much ought they to be Encouraged!]</P>
<P><HI>Family-Religion;</HI> In what Condition is it? We are told, they are most Ominously abating of it, among those whom we esteem our <HI>United Brethren</HI> beyond-Sea. But is not there amongst us also, some Abatement of it? There were Twelve Sermons on <HI>Family-Religion</HI> lately preached unto the City, in so many Lectures of your <HI>United Pastors.</HI> They were not regarded as they should have been; And GOD now makes an <HI>Earthquake</HI> succeed them, which preaches them over again, in a manner to be <HI>trembled</HI> at. It is upon Record, That there was a Town
<PB N="23" REF="002919_0025_0FE696B64A43A3C8"/>in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> all destroy'd by an <HI>Earthquake:</HI> Only One House escaped, in which the Good Man was at his daily <HI>Family-Sacrifice.</HI> If the <HI>Earthquake</HI> last Night, had caused every House to fall, that has not a daily <HI>Family-Sacrifice</HI> to GOD in it, what a rueful Spectacle had we seen this Morning! O <HI>Prayerless Housholders,</HI> How Obdurate, How Obstinate are you, How Inex∣pressibly and Prodigiously given up to a <HI>Repro∣bate Mind,</HI> if upon this <HI>Earthquake,</HI> which you have outlived, <HI>[But are not sure, that you shall Another!]</HI> you do not call your <HI>Domesticks</HI> toge∣ther, and let them know, You are exceedingly troubled, that your Family has been so long ex∣posed unto the <HI>Great Wrath</HI> of GOD, by being a <HI>Family that has not called on His Name,</HI> and that from THIS TIME, such <HI>Atheism</HI> shall no lon∣ger be persisted in; from THIS TIME you will have them join with you, in <HI>seeking</HI> of GOD that you may <HI>Live.</HI> And BEGIN without any further Delay: Fall down on your Knees be∣fore the LORD, with the Expressions of a Soul Returning to Him; and then Rise up Resolv∣ing, <HI>As for me and my House, we will serve the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>[I might go on, and ask; Are we not <HI>sound faulty</HI> in having our <HI>Hearts divided</HI> as they are, in our foolish <HI>Factions?</HI> And may not the Glo∣rious GOD cause the <HI>Earth</HI> to split with Chasms and Gasps and frightful <HI>Divisions;</HI> to animadvert upon our sinful <HI>Divisions?</HI></P>

Oh!

<P>Syrs, Let every one of us, [For I call upon you in the Style of the two <HI>Micahs; Hear this, O all ye People, every one of you!</HI>] — I say, Let <HI>every one of us,</HI> be awakened, — Won't a Rugient <HI>Earthquake</HI> awaken us? — <HI>To search and try our ways, and turn unto the Lord.</HI> Find out, what Errors in our Lives, our <HI>Conscience</HI> may Condemn us for. When an <HI>Earthquake</HI> is at work, it will be strange indeed if our <HI>Conscience</HI> be not also at <HI>work.</HI> The <HI>Work of the Law writ∣ten in our Hearts</HI> will be now exerted.

<P>Our LORD mentioning the <HI>Signs</HI> of His coming to Burn THIS World, and <HI>Create New Heavens and a New Earth wherein shall dwell Righ∣teousness,</HI> He says, Luk. XXI. 11. <HI>There shall be great Earthquakes in diverse places.</HI></P>
<P>Our SAVIOUR having foretold, That His <HI>Coming</HI> will be with all possible <HI>Surprize</HI> upon the World; like that of a <HI>Thief in the Night,</HI> wholly unlook'd for; no more look'd for than the Fate of the <HI>old World,</HI> and of <HI>Sodom,</HI> in the Day that it overtook them; and, <HI>The Day shall come as a Snare, on all them who dwell on the Face of the Earth:</HI> How is this consistent, with such <HI>Signal,</HI> such Observable, such Astonishing, <HI>Forerunners</HI> of His <HI>Coming?</HI> — It seems to me, the <HI>Signs</HI> which He foretells, were to be Things which were not so much <HI>Immediately</HI> to <HI>precede</HI> His Coming, and Rowse a <HI>sleeping World,</HI> as to <HI>Prefigure,</HI> and there∣with to <HI>Demonstrate</HI> unto Mankind, <HI>How Things will be at His coming.</HI> And it is intimated, as if they would be given <HI>Immediately after the Tribu∣lation of those Days,</HI> which dispersed the Jewish Nation.

<PB N="27" REF="002919_0029_0FE696B7891DDCC0"/>which in <HI>Those Days</HI> more than ever shook the World, <HI>in Diverse Places,</HI> and especially that un∣parallel'd one at <HI>Antioch,</HI> the second City of the World, when People were come together to wait upon the Emperour, and celebrate their Sports, from all parts of the World, might suf∣ficiently fulfil what our SAVIOUR foretold, of <HI>Great Earthquakes in diverse places.</HI> I verily Beleeve, That all the <HI>Signs,</HI> which our LORD promis'd of His coming, have been <HI>given;</HI> and are <HI>passed,</HI> and <HI>over;</HI> and the Heedless Children of Men, under the Intervening Reign of <HI>Anti∣christ,</HI> have taken little Notice of them.

—But, what a CONFLAGRATION, will be joined with it!—</P>
<P>When I consider, That the <HI>Coming of the Son of Man in the Clouds of Heaven,</HI> [which must mean His Literal, Personal, Visible <HI>Coming;</HI> We take <HI>the Name of the Lord in Vain,</HI> if we Expound it otherwise,] Tis to be at and for the <HI>Destruction</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> Monarchy, in the <HI>Papal</HI> and <HI>Final</HI> Form of it; And when I consider, the <HI>Flames,</HI> declared by <HI>Daniel,</HI> and by <HI>Paul,</HI> and by <HI>Peter,</HI> to accomplish it; I confess, I cannot but ad∣mire, how any Men of Thought can content themselves, with the commonly Received Opi∣nions, about the <HI>Coming</HI> of our SAVIOUR in His <HI>Kingdom,</HI> which are indeed calculated, as if on purpose, to lay and keep the <HI>World</HI> in that profound SLEEP, wherein the <HI>Day of GOD</HI> is to find it: <HI>Opinions,</HI> which the <HI>Petrine</HI> CONFLA∣GRATION, makes a miserable <HI>Hay</HI> and <HI>Stubble</HI> of! — But, if I should own, That I know of <HI>Nothing</HI> that remains to be done, before the Lord <HI>shall destroy the Man of Sin by the Brightness of His coming;</HI> If I should own, That this Word, is <HI>like a Fire in my Bones, and I am not easy in forbearing;</HI> If I should make the Cry, FIRE, FIRE! <HI>The Fire of GOD will sooner than is generally thought for, fall upon a wretched World, which dreams little of it!</HI>— I should be as much <HI>mocked,</HI> and as lit∣tle <HI>minded,</HI> as <HI>Lot</HI> was in the <HI>Morning</HI> of the Day when he went out of <HI>Sodom.</HI> The <HI>Sleepy</HI> People of GOD, will not bear to be Awakened: Our

<P>Wherefore, I will wave it. I will say no more of <HI>That.</HI> I will say, only what no body doubts of!

<P>First. A <HI>Process of Repentance,</HI> I say, A PRO∣CESS OF REPENTANCE: You must go thro' <HI>That</HI> IMMEDIATELY.

<P>The perils of an <HI>Earthquake</HI> bring us all into that woful plight; <HI>Thy Life shall hang in doubt be∣fore thee, and thou shalt fear Day and Night, and thou shalt have no Assurance of thy Life.</HI> Yea, there is not one Unregenerate among us, but what may say, <HI>I have no Assurance, that I shall not be in Hell before to Morrow Morning.</HI> How can any Man dare to live so?

<PB N="31" REF="002919_0033_0FE696C11E934928"/>of thee, if thou art enabled ever to turn unto GOD, then <HI>Consider thy ways.</HI> Take the <HI>Ten Commandments,</HI> with the Exposition of the <HI>Cate∣chism</HI> upon them; and Reflecting upon thy Tres∣passing against what is <HI>Forbidden</HI> and what is <HI>Re∣quired,</HI> in the <HI>Commandments,</HI> loath and judge thy self before the Lord, for thy many and heinous <HI>Trespasses.</HI> Go back to thy <HI>Original Sin,</HI> which has been the source of all thy <HI>Actual Sins,</HI> and of <HI>Innumerable Evils:</HI> Thy share in the <HI>Guilt</HI> of the first Apostasy: Thy deriving from thence an <HI>Heart</HI> that is <HI>Desperately wicked,</HI> and a <HI>Mother of Abominations.</HI> Full of <HI>Self-abborrence,</HI> present be∣fore the glorious GOD, the <HI>Blood</HI> of His own SON, which <HI>Cleanses from all Sin;</HI> Admiring the Merit and Virtue of that <HI>Blood,</HI> Beg and Hope on the account thereof to be <HI>cleansed from all thy Sin.</HI> Do this, and weep to a <HI>GOD Ready to par∣don;</HI> until His good SPIRIT has raised a <HI>Comfor∣table Perswasion</HI> in thee, <HI>that He has pardon'd thee.</HI> At the same, take up a <HI>full purpose of Heart,</HI> that thou wilt <HI>cleave</HI> to Him, and <HI>walk</HI> with Him, in perpetual Endeavours to <HI>keep a Conscience void of Offence</HI> before Him, to the period of thy Days. <HI>This is the way,</HI> Oh! <HI>walk</HI> in it; and thou shalt find <HI>Rest for thy Soul;</HI> A <HI>Rest</HI> wherein tho' an <HI>Earthquake</HI> may toss about the <HI>Earth</HI> under thy seet, thou shalt yet sing; <HI>The Lord is my Defence, I shall not be moved!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; A speedy Flight unto the only REDEEMER: This is the ONE THING
<PB N="32" REF="002919_0034_0FE6969786D18B60"/>NEEDFUL. 'Twill procure our <HI>safety</HI> in an <HI>Earthquake. As they fled from before the Earthquake in the Days of Uzziah King of Judah,</HI> so let us now <HI>Flee</HI> unto the LORD whom we see on <HI>a Throne high and lifted up;</HI> the <HI>High priest</HI> upon the <HI>Throne;</HI> the SAVIOUR who calls upon us, <HI>Come unto me!</HI> We read much about being <HI>safe</HI> and <HI>lodg'd</HI> and <HI>hid</HI> in the <HI>Tabernacle of GOD.</HI> But, O! what? O! where? — is the <HI>True Tabernacle?</HI> Truly, our Blessed JESUS is <HI>Tabernacle of GOD;</HI> Our Bible calls Him so. In Him there <HI>personally dwells the Fulness of the Godhead;</HI> Here the <HI>Shechinah.</HI> My Friend, Get into a CHRIST, and thou art in all the <HI>safety,</HI> in which the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> of GOD can cover thee: A <HI>Tabernacle</HI> that no <HI>Earthquake</HI> ever can reach unto.</P>
<P>But, How is this to be done? Briefly, A glori∣ous CHRIST has in a <HI>Covenant of Redemption</HI> en∣gaged unto His FATHER for His People; That He would furnish them with a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and a <HI>Righteousness,</HI> in Relying whereon they should be <HI>Forgiven</HI> and <HI>Accepted</HI> with Him; And, That He would then fill them with the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD and their Neighbour, and Heal all that is Amiss in them, and fit them for and bring them to <HI>all the spiritual Blessings in the Heavenly places.</HI> Now con∣sent unto it, O Gospellized Soul, That thou mayst be comprehended in this <HI>Covenant</HI> of thy SAVI∣OUR. Beg it of Him; <HI>O my SAVIOUR, Do for me all that thou hast engaged unto thy FATHER to do for all thy chosen!</HI> This Consent brings thee into the
<PB N="33" REF="002919_0035_0FE696C2B34C4748"/><HI>Covenant of Grace.</HI> Thy SAVIOUR takes thee un∣der the <HI>shadow of His Wings;</HI> And what can any <HI>Earthquake</HI> do unto thee there? My Neighbours come about me, and Cry, <HI>Oh! What shall I do, if I see the Earth opening under me, and seel my self going down into the Pit?</HI> I cannot for my life think on a better Answer than This; <HI>Get and keep a fast hold of a CHRIST, and you are in eternal safety.</HI> I have just now told you, how to do it. Soul, Thy SA∣VIOUR calls to thee, <HI>With me thou shalt be in safe∣ty.</HI> Oh! Repair to Him, and say, <HI>Lord, I am Thine; save me!</HI> If an <HI>Earthquake</HI> should now sink thee down, thou hast a SAVIOUR that will fetch thee up again.</P>
<P>—And now, O EARTHQUAKE, <HI>Do thy worst. Thou canst not make me miserable. My SAVI∣OUR is my Friend, I will not fear; what can an Earthquake do unto me!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly; A Life of Serious, Watchful, Prayer∣ful, and Fruitful PIETY; <HI>This</HI> will do. <HI>All its Ways are Ways of Tranquillity, and all its Paths are Safety.</HI> He that <HI>walks with</HI> GOD, what has he to sear, tho' he should have the <HI>Earth trembling</HI> under his Feet? The <HI>Life of GOD,</HI> come into <HI>That,</HI> and thou hast what can't be <HI>kill'd;</HI> No, Not by an <HI>Earthquake.</HI> Beleever, Get a Soul as full of a CHRIST as ever thou canst; especially, in <HI>Precious Thoughts</HI> of Him. Let thy <HI>Life</HI> be fill'd with <HI>Devotions</HI> towards GOD, and with <HI>Benigni∣ties</HI> towards Men. Make the <HI>serving</HI> and <HI>pleasing</HI> of GOD in them, the main <HI>Scope</HI> of thy Actions;
<PB N="34" REF="002919_0036_0FE69697A110D418"/>Make the <HI>seeing</HI> and <HI>serving</HI> of GOD by them, the main <HI>Sweet</HI> of thy Enjoyments. Be daily <HI>de∣vising of Good,</HI> and have a peerless Delight in do∣ing of it, and, <HI>Be not weary of well-doing.</HI> If an <HI>Earthquake</HI> find thee <HI>so doing,</HI>—how <HI>Safe,</HI> how <HI>safe,</HI> art thou? <HI>What can harm thee,</HI> if thou be such a <HI>Follower of the Good One?</HI></P>
<P>Alas, When I see the Epidemical Decay of <HI>Real</HI> and <HI>Vital</HI> PIETY, and how <HI>Lukewarm</HI> we are in all that is Good, with how few <HI>Agonies</HI> the affairs of Salvation are carried on, methinks, I see sufficient cause for <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> to throw us into <HI>Agonies. Laodicea</HI> had this charged upon her, <HI>Thou art Lukewarm.</HI> Tis <HI>Our</HI> unhappy and prevailing Temper. But what is become of <HI>La∣odicea?</HI> Tis intirely lost, in amazing <HI>Earthquakes.</HI> No Travellers can find where <HI>Laodicea</HI> stood!— It is entirely absorb'd and vanished, in horrible <HI>Earthquakes.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly. What a Contempt is due to an <HI>Earth,</HI> whereof we see all the Possessions lying under such a dismal <HI>Uncertainty!</HI></P>
<P>We find People <HI>casting away their Idols,</HI> when they see the <HI>LORD arising to shake terribly the Earth.</HI> The <HI>Earthquake</HI> wherein we just now saw the Glorious GOD <HI>arising to shake terribly the Earth,</HI> has in it this <HI>Voice</HI> unto us; <HI>Don't Idolize this Earth! Set not your Hearts upon an Earth, which may easily and suddenly prove a Grave unto you, and unto all that you have upon it!</HI> If we could look into the <HI>uncertain Ground</HI> which we stand upon,
<PB N="35" REF="002919_0037_0FE696C2D32970F8"/>and build upon, and could see the deep, the wide, and hideous <HI>Vaults</HI> below, and how liable the thin <HI>Arched Roof</HI> over the hollow Recesses of the <HI>Sub∣terraneous World</HI> may be to fail and break &amp; sink upon the Expansion of the Vapours there, cer∣tainly it were enough to make us almost swoon with Fear, and in a shuddering Horror, and our Hearts even die away within us. The dreadful <HI>Abyss,</HI> over which there is bent and laid the shallow <HI>Bridge,</HI> that sustains us, and all that the <HI>Men of this World</HI> have to subsist upon, or find comfort in! Syrs, we have no <HI>earthly</HI> Possessions, but what may be call'd, <HI>Moveables;</HI> Our very <HI>Houses</HI> are so! O you that <HI>mind Earthly Things!</HI> What of this <HI>Idolized Earth</HI> is there, that you can be sure of? How does all appear, when an <HI>Earthquake</HI> shews you <HI>truly</HI> what it is? How Undone! How Undone! How Damned are you, if you are put off with a <HI>Portion</HI> here? The Text, of which the <HI>Earthquake</HI> is a Cogent and a Pungent <HI>Sermon,</HI> is that; Col. III. 2. <HI>Set your Affections on the Things that are Above, not on Things that are on the Earth.</HI> My Fellow-Travellers; Let us live like <HI>Strangers on the Earth,</HI> and even as <HI>Dead</HI> unto it; and maintain a wise <HI>Indifferency</HI> to all the Enjoyments and Endearments of it. <HI>As Dying, and behold we Live!</HI></P>
<P>I have done.—But now, <HI>Return and discern be∣tween the Righteous and the Wicked; between him that serveth GOD, and him that serveth Him not.</HI></P>
<P>And here, first, see the forlorn and frighted As∣pect
<PB N="36" REF="002919_0038_0FE69698F18FD9D8"/>of the <HI>Wicked;</HI> How their <HI>Countenance is chan∣ged,</HI> and their <HI>Thoughts trouble them,</HI> and their <HI>knees do swite one against another!</HI> Their <HI>Flesh</HI> it self evi∣dently quivering, and their <HI>Hearts failing for fear, and for looking after: be Things that are coming on the Earth!</HI> — And NOW, they wish, <HI>Oh! That I were in good Terms with Heaven!</HI> they think; Well, If they may escape <HI>this once,</HI> how they will <HI>Exer∣cise themselves unto Godliness;</HI> how Regularly they will <HI>order their Conversation;</HI> how conscienciously they will <HI>work out their own Salvation!</HI> — Sayst thou so, <HI>Friend?</HI> — But Oh! <HI>Let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more!</HI> We shall see, how they re∣member the <HI>Vows</HI> of GOD upon them; how they behave themselves.</P>
<P>But then, the <HI>Righteous! Mark the perfect Man, and behold the Upright;</HI> See the <HI>Peace of GOD</HI> that fortifies him, even, when he has a prospect of his <HI>End</HI> just come upon him. There is indeed a <HI>Reve∣rence and godly Fear</HI> with which he regards what the great GOD is doing in an <HI>Earthquake.</HI> Even a <HI>Moses</HI> himself is an Example of it. He is neither a <HI>Stoick,</HI> nor a <HI>Mocker.</HI> But yet — not <HI>Afraid with any Amazement!</HI> — you may see an Amiable <HI>Se∣renity</HI> in him, when all the World about him is in an uproar. How free from the <HI>Commotions,</HI> and Convulsions and Confusions, with which the reft of the World is agitated. Even an Heathen Poet, celebrates it among the priviledges and preroga∣tives of a Virtuous Man, <HI>Let an Earthquake break and sink the World,</HI> [Impavidum serient Ruinae]
<PB N="37" REF="002919_0039_0FE696CBF9E22938"/><HI>be is not frighted at the Ruins!</HI> But O the Triumphs of the Man that indeed <HI>Lives unto GOD,</HI> and feels a CHRIST, <HI>living in him!</HI> He is assured, <HI>If the Earthquake put a stop to my Breath, my Soul will be in the Paradise of GOD before the morning.</HI> Like <HI>Paul</HI> &amp; <HI>Silas,</HI> he can <HI>Sing</HI> in the midst of an <HI>Earthquake;</HI> he can <HI>Sing for the Majesty of the Lord;</HI> he can say, <HI>O Death, where is thy sting! O Earthquake, where is thy Victory!</HI></P>
<P>Thus do we turn to <HI>see the Voice!</HI> — We read, Rev. XI. 19. <HI>The Temple of GOD was opened, and there were Voices, and Thundrings, and a great Earthquake.</HI> We are this Day come into the <HI>Temple,</HI> that we may hear the <HI>Voices</HI> of our <HI>Great Earthquake.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Great Earthquake</HI> is called in the Bible, <HI>A Trembling of GOD.</HI> But, O! If we may <HI>Tremble</HI> more than the <HI>Earth,</HI> and be those whom GOD <HI>shall see Trembling at His Word;</HI> This, This would be a <HI>Trembling of GOD</HI> in∣deed: Such as, Blessed are they that come into it.</P>
<P>In some Expectation, that <HI>GOD giving forth His Thundring Voice,</HI> in and by the <HI>melting</HI> of the <HI>Trembling Earth,</HI> His <HI>Voice</HI> will be heark∣ned unto, and that our <HI>Earthquake</HI> will prove the <HI>most useful Dispensation</HI> that ever we have seen, in all the Days of our Pilgrimage, We shall now conclude; and presently Sing part of the <HI>Forty sixth Psalm,</HI> with the <HI>last Verse</HI> of the <HI>Fourth Psalm</HI> annexed unto it.</P>

<HEAD>AN <HI>APPENDIX.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[Written <HI>Saturday,</HI> Nov. 4.]</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE Six Days from the First Shock of our EARTHQUAKE are Expired, we are able to Relate, That it has reached, as far as 'tis possible for us in this Time to learn, upon all points of the Compass. We already know of it's reaching from <HI>North</HI> to <HI>South,</HI> near one hundred &amp; forty Miles. It seems, to have been at the <HI>Northward,</HI> rather more formida∣blethan in our parts. The <HI>Roar</HI> of it <HI>longer</HI> and <HI>louder,</HI> and the Noise of the <HI>Explosion</HI> somewhere or other, after more than an Hours <HI>murmur,</HI> more audible, and more terrible; equal to that of many discharged Cannon. It affects Travellers to see, not only vast Quan∣tities of <HI>Stone-Wall</HI> thrown down by it, but also mighty <HI>Rocks</HI> either overset, or sunk some way into the Earth. 'Tis not known, how many <HI>Houses,</HI> or <HI>Chimneys</HI> are damnified. But then, That no <HI>more!</HI> — That no <HI>Worse!</HI> — That no <HI>Lives</HI> that we yet know of, Sacrificed! —</P>
<P>Scarce a Night has pass'd all this Week, without a sensible Repetition of the <HI>Sbocks,</HI> with the concomitant Rumbles in mony Places. But
<PB N="2" REF="002919_0041_0FE696CC17A1D9B8"/>the smell of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> which is affirmed by ma∣ny to have been plain unto them, — adds to a <HI>Fearful Expectation</HI> of a <HI>Fiery Indignation,</HI> — in GOD's Time and way to be proceeded in.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Glorious GOD has heretofore spoke to <HI>New-England,</HI> by lesser <HI>Earthquakes;</HI> and our Predecessors made such an Holy Im∣provement of them, that they proved <HI>profitable Dispensations.</HI></P>
<P>About, <HI>Jun.</HI> 2. 1638. there was an <HI>Earth∣quake</HI> that shook the Houses, and shook down the Things that stood upon Shelves in them; and People that were abroad, could not stand, but laid hold upon what was next them, to pre∣serve them from falling down. A second <HI>Shock</HI> succeeded, but not equal to the former. The <HI>Sea also was troubled;</HI> and the Vessels there felt the Shock, with surprize and consternation.</P>
<P>GOD was at the same time, <HI>shaking</HI> the Churches in the Country, with a Shock that would have torn them to pieces: if <HI>GOD in the midst</HI> of them, had not prevented their be∣ing <HI>moved:</HI> Their GOD and SAVIOUR <HI>helped</HI> them, in that <HI>Morning</HI> of the Colony.</P>
<P>On <HI>Octob.</HI> 29 1653. there was an <HI>Earthquake;</HI> on which the Aged Hand of the famous Mr. <HI>Peter Bulkly,</HI> the never-to-be-forgotten Pastor and Glory of <HI>Concord,</HI> could not forbear taking a Pen, and Writing this Epigram. [Taken from, His <HI>Life,</HI> in the <HI>Magnalia CHRISTI Americana.</HI> B. III. p. 98.]</P>

<L>The Pillars of the World all shake; The Frame</L>

<L><HI>Lord,</HI> Put an End unto the <HI>Shocks</HI> betimes:</L>
<L>But, Oh! <HI>First</HI> put an End unto our <HI>Crimes.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>In the Year, 1658. <HI>New-England</HI> felt another considerable <HI>Earthquake.</HI> Nothing memorable is left upon Record concerning it. It had Con∣comitants that were <HI>too Memorable.</HI></P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>January,</HI> between 1662 and 1663, there was an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> whereof we find this Account given by that worthy Man, Mr. <HI>Samuel Danforth</HI> of <HI>Roxbury;</HI></P>
<P><Q><HI>Jan.</HI> 26. &amp; <HI>28.</HI> The Foundations of the Earth trembled, and some our Houses rocqu'd like a Cradle. Six or seven times did the <HI>Earth shake</HI> under us, in the space of Two or Three Days. It was then tho't &amp; said, That these <HI>Earth∣quakes</HI> might portend the shaking the Founda∣tions of our Churches, and of our Civil State.</Q></P>
<P>In the Year 1705. there was a small <HI>Earth∣quake</HI> felt by the <HI>Massachuset</HI>-Province on <HI>Jun.</HI> 16. And in <HI>Connecticut</HI>-Colony, <HI>Jun.</HI> 22. On which occasion Dr. <HI>Increase Mather,</HI> preached and printed, <HI>A Discourse concerning Earthquakes.</HI> In that Sermon, there are these among other Passages:</P>
<P><Q>The Lord seldom Visits any Town or Coun∣try with desolating Judgments, but He first gives them Warning of it, by one means or another; and many times by <HI>Earthquakes.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="002919_0044_0FE6969E30A431B8"/>A Roman Historian observes, that the City of <HI>Rome</HI> never felt any <HI>Earthquake,</HI> but some ter∣rible Judgment soon followed. In the Scrip∣ture, it is said, <HI>There shall be Earthquakes in diverse Places;</HI> The Next Words are; <HI>And FAMINES &amp; PESTILENCES. Earth∣quakes</HI> are sometimes <HI>prodromous</HI> of those other Judgments. — But, —We have at this Day Reason to expect that a Notable COMING of the LORD is near at hand. Yea, we may say, <HI>The Great-DAY of THE LORD, is Near, it is Near, and it Hasteth greatly.</HI></Q></P>
<P>There have been more than One or Two les∣ser <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> besides these, at several Times in the Country. But never any that on all Ac∣counts has equalled THAT which is now Alarming of us.</P>
<P>We will at present conclude, with a few Lines extracted from a little Treatise entituled, <HI>Geologia Norvegica:</HI> written by a Danish Mi∣nister, whose Name was <HI>Michael Peterson Es∣cholt,</HI> on the Occasion of (what he calls) <HI>That very great &amp; spacious Earthquake, almost quite thro' the South Parts</HI> of <HI>Norway, Apr.</HI> 24. 1657.</P>
<P>He says, <Q>It carryed such a Noise &amp; Sound with it, that the People at first knew not but it was the Noise of Thunder, until they per∣ceived the Houses shook, and all their Move∣ables totter. — Yet it hath not done any Re∣markable Harm; for which we ought to be very Thankful unto GOD.— Nevertheless,
<PB N="6" REF="002919_0045_0FE696CDB76C7DE8"/>in regard that this <HI>Earthquake</HI> was of such a Length and Breadth, namely an hundred and sixty Miles, we need not doubt but that it may signify some Remarkable Change and Alteration. The ancient Historiographer <HI>He∣rodotus,</HI> has recorded it; That when any Re∣markable Change or Calamity approaches, it is commonly signified by such preceding Tokens! —</Q></P>
<P><Q>—When GOD Almighty, now in these last Times of the World, shall permit such <HI>Great &amp; Spacious Earthquakes,</HI> for so many many Miles in length to happen, Men ought not carelesly to slight them, and think no more of them: No, But regard &amp; receive them, as partly signifying some unusual Accident Im∣pending or Approaching; and partly as in∣fallible <HI>Forerunners</HI> of the DAY, which the <HI>earnest Expectation of the Creature waiteth for, yea, Groaneth and even Travaileth in Pain.</HI></Q></P>
