<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE House of Representatives of this Province, in the present Ses∣sion of the General Court, have unanimously agreed to propose a Meeting, as soon as may be, of COMMITTEES, from the Houses of Representatives or Burgesses of the several <HI>British</HI> Co∣lonies on this Continent▪ to consult together on the present Cir∣cumstances of the Colonies, and the Difficulties to which they are, and must be reduced, by the Operation of the Acts of Parliament for levying Duties and Taxes on the Colonies; and to consider of a general, and united, du∣tiful, loyal and humble Representation of their Condition, to his Majesty and the Parliament, and to implore Relief. The House of Representatives of this Province, have also Voted to propose, That such Meeting be at the City of <HI>New-York,</HI> in the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> on the first Tuesday in <HI>October</HI> next; and have appointed a Committee of Three of their Members, to attend that Service, with such as the other Houses of Representatives, or Burgesses, in the several Colonies, may think fit to appoint to meet them.

<P><HI>GENTLEMEN,</HI></P>
<P>THE House of Representatives of this Province, have appointed you a Committee, to meet at <HI>New-York,</HI> on the first Tuesday of <HI>October</HI> next▪ such Committees as the other Houses of Representatives, or Burgesses, in the several Colonies on this Continent may think fit to appoint, to con∣sult together, on the present Circumstances of the Colonies, and the Dif∣ficulties to which they are, and must be reduced, by the Operation of the late Acts of Parliament. By this Choice, the House has reposed in you a Trust of singular Importance, and has just Reason to expect you will give your utmost Attention to it. In case you should receive Advice that the Houses of Representatives or Burgesses of the other Colonies, or any of them, agree to send Committees to join you in this Interesting Affair, you are directed to repair to <HI>New-York,</HI> at the Time appointed▪ and endeavour to unite with them in Sentiment, and agree upon such Representations as may tend to preserve our Rights and Privileges; and it is the Opinion of this House, that no Address or Representation, shall be esteemed the Act of this House, unless it is agreed to, and signed by the major Part of their Committee.</P>
<P>If it should be said that we are in any Manner represented in Parliament▪ you must by no Means concede to it, as it is an Opinion, which this House cannot see the least Reason to adopt; further, the House think that such a Representation of the Colonies, as <HI>British</HI> Subjects are entitled to, and enjoy, would be attended with the greatest Difficulty, if it is not absolutely impracticable, and therefore you are not to urge or consent to any Proposal for a Representation, if such be made in the Congress.</P>
<P>It is the Expectation of the House, that a most loyal and dutiful Address to his Majesty and his Parliament will be prepared by the Congress, pray∣ing as well for the Removal of the Grievances the Colonies labour under at present, as for the preventing Others for the future, which Petitions, if
<PB N="3" REF="010424_0003_0FFE636CB22F07D8"/>
drawn up, as far as you shall be able to Judge agreeable to the Mind of this House, you are impowered to sign and forward, and you are to lay a Copy of the same before this House, and make Report of your Proceedings upon your Return.</P>
<P>It is the hearty Prayer of this House, that the Congress may be endued with that Wisdom, which is from above; and that their Councils and De∣terminations may be attended with the Divine Blessing.</P>

<P>The Congress met according to Adjournment, and Resumed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as Yesterday. And upon mature Deliberation, agreed to the following Decla∣rations of the Rights and Grievances of the Colonists, in <HI>America,</HI> which were Ordered to be inserted.</P>
<P>The Members of this Congress, sincerely devoted, with the warmest Sen∣timents of Affection and Duty to his Majesty's Person and Government, inviolably attached to the present happy Establishment of the Protestant Succession, and with Minds deeply impressed by a Sense of the present and impending Misfortunes of the <HI>British</HI> Colonies on this Continent; having considered as maturely as Time will permit, the Circumstances of the said Colonies, esteem it our indispensable Duty, to make the following Decla∣rations of our humble Opinion, respecting the most Essential Rights and Liberties of the Colonists, and of the Grievances under which they labour, by Reason of several late Acts of Parliament.</P>
<P N="1">I. That his Majesty's Subjects in these Colonies, owe the same Al∣legiance to the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> that is owing from his Subjects born within the Realm, and all due Subordination to that August Body the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. That his Majesty's Liege Subjects in these Colonies, are entitled to all the inherent Rights and Liberties of his Natural born Subjects, within the Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. That it is inseparably essential to the Freedom of a People, and the undoubted Right of <HI>Englishmen,</HI> that no Taxes be imposed on them, but with their own Consent, given personally, or by their Representatives.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That the People of these Colonies are not, and from their local Cir∣cumstances cannot be, Represented in the House of Commons in <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. That the only Representatives of the People of these Colonies, are Per∣sons chosen therein by themselves, and that no Taxes ever have been, or can be Constitutionally imposed on them, but by their respective Legislature.</P>
<P N="6">VI. That all Supplies to the Crown, being free Gifts of the People, it is unreasonable and inconsistent with the Principles and Spirit of the <HI>British</HI> Constitution, for the People of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> to grant to his Majesty the Property of the Colonists.</P>
<P N="7">VII. That Trial by Jury, is the inherent and invaluable Right of every <HI>British</HI> Subject in these Colonies.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="16" REF="010424_0016_0FFE630F39B9DCD0"/>VIII. That the late Act of Parliament, entitled, <HI>An Act for granting and applying certain Stamp Duties, and other Duties, in the</HI> British <HI>Colonies and Plantations in</HI> America, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by imposing Taxes on the Inhabitants of these Colonies, and the said Act, and several other Acts, by extending the Ju∣risdiction of the Courts of Admiralty beyond its ancient Limits, have a manifest Tendency to subvert the Rights and Liberties of the Colonists.</P>
<P N="9">IX. That the Duties imposed by several late Acts of Parliament, from the peculiar Circumstances of these Colonies, will be extremely Burthen∣some and Grievous; and from the scarcity of Specie, the Payment of them absolutely impracticable.</P>
<P N="10">X. That as the Profits of the Trade of these Colonies ultimately center in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> to pay for the Manufactures which they are obliged to take from thence, they eventually contribute very largely to all Supplies granted there to the Crown.</P>
<P N="11">XI. That the Restrictions imposed by several late Acts of Parliament, on the Trade of these Colonies, will render them unable to purchase the Ma∣nufactures of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P N="12">XII. That the Increase, Prosperity, and Happiness of these Colonies, depend on the full and free Enjoyment of their Rights and Liberties, and an Intercourse with <HI>Great-Britain</HI> mutually Affectionate and Advantageous.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. That it is the Right of the <HI>British</HI> Subjects in these Colonies, to Petition the King, or either House of Parliament.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> That it is the indispensable Duty of these Colonies, to the best of Sovereigns, to the Mother Country, and to themselves, to endeavour by a loyal and dutiful Address to his Majesty, and humble Applications to both Houses of Parliament, to procure the Repeal of the Act for granting and applying certain Stamp Duties, of all Clauses of any other Acts of Parlia∣ment, whereby the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty is extended as aforesaid, and of the other late Acts for the Restriction of <HI>American</HI> Commerce.</P>
<P>Upon Motion, Voted, That <HI>Robert R. Livingston, William Samuel Johnson,</HI> and <HI>William Murdock,</HI> Esquires, be a Committee to prepare an Address to his Majesty, and lay the same before the Congress on Monday next.</P>
<P>Voted also, That <HI>John Rutledge, Edward Tilghman,</HI> and <HI>Philip Livingston,</HI> Esquires, be a Committee to prepare a Memorial and Petition to the Lords in Parliament, and lay the same before the Congress on Monday next.</P>
<P>Voted also, That <HI>Thomas Lynch, James Otis,</HI> and <HI>Thomas M<SUP>c</SUP>Kean,</HI> Es∣quires, be a Committee to prepare a Petition to the House of Commons of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and lay the same before the Congress on Monday next.</P>

<OPENER>Most humbly Sheweth,</OPENER>
<P>THAT the Inhabitants of these Colonies, Unanimously devoted with the warmest Sentiments of Duty and Affection to your Majesty's Sa∣cred Person and Government, Inviolably attached to the present Happy Establishment of the Protestant Succession in your Illustrious House, and deeply sensible of your Royal Attention to their Prosperity and Happiness,
<PB N="18" REF="010424_0018_0FFE62A0C6781120"/>
humbly beg Leave to approach the Throne, by representing to your Ma∣jesty, That these Colonies were Originally Planted by Subjects of the <HI>British</HI> Crown, who, animated with the Spirit of Liberty, encouraged by your Majesty's Royal Predecessors, and confiding in the Public Faith for the En∣joyment of all the Rights and Liberties essential to Freedom, emigrated from their Native Country to this Continent, and by their successful Per∣severance in the midst of innumerable Dangers and Difficulties, together with a Profusion of their Blood and Treasure, have happily added these vast and valuable Dominions to the Empire of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> That for the Enjoyment of these Rights and Liberties, several Governments were early formed in the said Colonies, with full Power of Legislation, agreeable to the Principles of the <HI>English</HI> Constitution.</P>
<P>That under those Governments, these Liberties, thus vested in their An∣cestors, and transmitted to their Posterity, have been exercised and enjoyed, and by the inestimable Blessings thereof (under the Favour of Almighty GOD), the inhospitable Desarts of <HI>America</HI> have been converted into Flourishing Countries; Science, Humanity, and the Knowledge of Divine Truths, diffused through Remote Regions of Ignorance, Infidelity, and Barbarism; the Number of <HI>British</HI> Subjects wonderfully Increased, and the Wealth and Power of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> proportionably Augmented.</P>
<P>That by Means of these Settlements, and the unparallelled Success of your Majesty's Arms, a Foundation is now laid for rendering the <HI>British</HI> Empire the most Extensive and Powerful of any Recorded in History. Our Connection with this Empire, we esteem our greatest Happiness and Secu∣rity, and humbly conceive it may now be so established by your Royal Wis∣dom, as to endure to the latest Period of Time; This, with most humble Submission to your Majesty, we apprehend will be most effectually Accom∣plished, by fixing the Pillars thereof on Liberty and Justice, and securing the inherent Rights and Liberties of your Subjects here, upon the Principles of the <HI>English</HI> Constitution. To this Constitution these Two Principles are essential, the Right of your faithful Subjects, freely to grant to your Ma∣jesty, such Aids as are required for the Support of your Government over them, and other Public Exigencies, and Trials by their Peers: By the One they are secured from unreasonable Impositions; and by the Other from Ar∣bitrary Decisions of the executive Power.</P>
<P>The Continuation of these Liberties to the Inhabitants of <HI>America</HI> we ardently Implore, as absolutely necessary to Unite the several Parts of your wide extended Dominions, in that Harmony so Essential to the Preservation and Happiness of the Whole. Protected in these Liberties, the Emolu∣ments <HI>Great-Britain</HI> receives from us, however great at present, are incon∣siderable, compared with those she has the fairest Prospect of acquiring. By this Protection she will for ever secure to herself the Advantage of con∣veying to all <HI>Europe,</HI> the Merchandises which <HI>America</HI> furnishes, and of Supplying through the same Channel, whatever is wanted from thence. Here opens a boundless Source of Wealth and Naval Strength; yet these immense Advantages, by the Abridgment of those invaluable Rights and Liberties, by which our Growth has been Nourished, are in Danger of
<PB N="19" REF="010424_0019_0FFE751B0521DBA8"/>
being for ever Lost; and our subordinate Legislatures, in Effect, rendered useless, by the late Acts of Parliament imposing Duties and Taxes on these Colonies, and extending the Jurisdiction of the Courts of Admiralty here, beyond its antient Limits: Statutes by which your Majesty's Commons in <HI>Britain</HI> undertake, absolutely to dispose of the Property of their Fellow Subjects in <HI>America,</HI> without their Consent, and for the enforcing whereof, they are subjected to the Determination of a single Judge in a Court un∣restrained by the wise Rules of the Common Law, the Birthright of <HI>Eng∣lishmen,</HI> and the Safeguard of their Persons and Properties.</P>
<P>The invaluable Rights of Taxing ourselves, and Trial by our Peers, of which we implore your Majesty's Protection, are not, we most humbly conceive Unconstitutional; but confirmed by the Great CHARTER of <HI>English</HI> Liberty. On the First of these Rights the Honourable the House of Com∣mons Found their Practice of Originating Money Bills, a Right enjoyed by the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> by the Clergy of <HI>England,</HI> until relinquished by themselves, a Right, in fine, which all other your Majesty's <HI>English</HI> Subjects, both within, and without the Realm, have hitherto enjoyed.</P>
<P>With Hearts therefore impressed with the most indelible Characters of Gratitude to your Majesty, and to the Memory of the Kings of your Illustrious House, whose Reigns have been Signally distinguished by their Auspicious Influence on the Prosperity of the <HI>British</HI> Dominions, and convinced by the most affecting Proofs of your Majesty's Paternal Love to all your People, however distant, and your unceasing and benevolent Desires to promote their Happiness, We most humbly beseech your Majesty, that you will be gra∣ciously pleased to take into your Royal Consideration, the Distresses of your faithful Subjects on this Continent, and to lay the same before your Ma∣jesty's Parliament, and to afford them such Relief, as in your Royal Wis∣dom their unhappy Circumstances shall be judged to require.</P>
<P><HI>And your Petitioners as in Duty bound will pray.</HI></P>

<P>That your Memorialists also humbly conceive another of these essential Rights to be the Exemption from all Taxes, but such as are imposed on the People by the several Legislatures in these Colonies, which Right also they have, till of late, freely enjoyed.</P>
<P>But your Memorialists humbly beg Leave to represent to your Lordships, That the Act for granting certain Stamp Duties in the <HI>British</HI> Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> &amp;c. fills his Majesty's <HI>American</HI> Subjects with the deepest Concern, as it tends to deprive them of the Two fundamental and invaluable Rights and Liberties above mentioned, and that several other late Acts of Parlia∣ment, which extend the Jurisdiction and Powers of Courts of Admiralty in the Plantations, beyond their Limits in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> thereby make an unnecessary and unhappy Distinction as to the Modes of Trial, between us and our Fellow Subjects there, by whom we never have been excelled in Duty and Loyalty to our Sovereign.</P>
<P>That from the natural Connection between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> the perpetual Continuance of which your Memorialists most ardently de∣sire, they conceive that nothing can Conduce more to the Interest of both, than the Colonists free Enjoyment of their Rights and Liberties, and an affectionate Intercourse between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and them. But your Me∣morialists (not waving their Claim to these Rights, of which with the most becoming Veneration and Deference to the Wisdom and Justice of your Lordships, they apprehend they cannot Reasonably be deprived) humbly Represent, That from the peculiar Circumstances of these Colonies, the Duties imposed by the aforesaid Act, and several other late Acts of Parlia∣ment, are extremely Grievous and Burthensome, and the Payment of the said Duties will very soon, for want of Specie, become absolutely impracti∣cable; and that the Restrictions on Trade by the said Acts, will not only greatly distress the Colonies, but must be extremely detrimental to the Trade and true Interest of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Your Memorialists therefore, impressed with a just Sense of the unfor∣tunate Circumstances of the Colonies, and the impending destructive Con∣sequences which must necessarily ensue from the Execution of those Acts, animated with the warmest Sentiments of filial Affection for their Mother Country, most earnestly and humbly entreat, That your Lordships will be pleased to Hear their Counsel in Support of this Memorial, and take the Premisses into your most serious Consideration, and that your Lordships will also be thereupon pleased to pursue such Measures for Restoring the just Rights and Liberties of the Colonies, and preserving them for ever inviolate▪
<PB N="21" REF="010424_0021_0FFE752B9AF63CA8"/>
for redressing their present, and preventing future Grievances, thereby pro∣moting the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Interest of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> as to your Lord∣ships in your great Wisdom shall seem most Conducive and Effectual to that important End.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="petition">
<HEAD>WEDNESDAY,
<DATE><HI>October</HI> 23, 1765, A. M.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The Congress met according to Adjournment.</P>
<P>The Petition to the House of Commons being Ingrossed, was Read and Compared, and is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>To the Honourable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> in Parliament assembled.</P>
<P>The PETITION of his Majesty's dutiful and loyal Subjects, the Free∣holders and other Inhabitants of the Colonies of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay, Rhode-Island,</HI> and <HI>Providence</HI> Plantations, <HI>New-Jersey, Pennsylvania,</HI> the Government of the Counties of <HI>New-Castle, Kent,</HI> and <HI>Sussex,</HI> upon <HI>Delaware, Maryland,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Most humbly Sheweth,</HI></P>
<P>THAT the several late Acts of Parliament imposing divers Duties and Taxes on the Colonies, and laying the Trade and Commerce thereof under very Burthensome Restrictions, but above all the Act for granting and applying certain Stamp Duties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> have fill'd them with the deepest Concern and Surprize'; and they humbly conceive the Execution of them will be attended with Consequences very Injurious to the Commercial Interest of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her Colonies, and must terminate in the eventual Ruin of the latter.</P>
<P>Your Petitioners therefore most ardently implore the Attention of the Honourable House, to the united and dutiful Representation of their Cir∣cumstances, and to their earnest Supplications for Relief, from those Regu∣lations which have already involv'd this Continent in Anxiety, Confusion, and Distress.</P>
<P>We most sincerely recognize our Allegiance to the Crown, and acknow∣ledge all due Subordination to the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and shall always retain the most grateful Sense of their Assistance and Protection. It is from and under the <HI>English</HI> Constitution, we derive all our Civil and Religious Rights and Liberties: We Glory in being Subjects of the best of Kings, and having been Born under the most perfect Form of Government; but it is with most ineffable and humiliating Sorrow, that we find ourselves, of late, deprived of the Right of Granting our own Property for his Ma∣jesty's
<PB N="22" REF="010424_0022_0FFE752FD4F66CB0"/>
Service, to which our Lives and Fortunes are entirely devoted, and to which, on his Royal Requisitions, we leave ever been ready to contribute to the utmost of our Abilities.</P>
<P>We have also the Misfortune to find, that all the Penalties and Forfei∣tures mentioned in the Stamp Act, and in divers late Acts of Trade extend∣ing to the Plantations, are, at the Election of the Informer, Recoverable in any Court of Admiralty in <HI>America.</HI> This, as the newly erected Court of Admiralty has a general Jurisdiction over all <HI>British America,</HI> renders his Majesty's Subjects in these Colonies, liable to be carried, at an immense Expence, from one End of the Continent, to the other.</P>
<P>It gives us also great Pain, to see a manifest Distinction made therein, between the Subjects of our Mother Country, and those in the Colonies, in that the like Penalties and Forfeitures recoverable there only in his Ma∣jesty's Courts of Record, are made cognizable here by a Court of Admiralty: By these Means we seem to be, in Effect, unhappily deprived of Two Pri∣vileges essential to Freedom, and which all <HI>Englishmen</HI> have ever considered as their best Birthrights, that of being free from all Taxes but such as they have consented to in Person, or by their Representatives, and of Trial by their Peers.</P>
<P>Your Petitioners further shew, That the remote Situation, and other Circumstances of the Colonies, render it impracticable that they should be Represented, but in their respective subordinate Legislature; and they hum∣bly conceive, that the Parliament, adhering strictly to the Principles of the Constitution, have never hitherto Tax'd any, but those who were actually therein Represented; for this Reason, we humbly apprehend, they never have Tax'd <HI>Ireland,</HI> or any other of the Subjects without the Realm.</P>
<P>But were it ever so clear, that the Colonies might in Law, be reasonably deem'd to be Represented in the Honourable House of Commons, yet we conceive, that very good Reasons, from Inconvenience, from the Principles of true Policy, and from the Spirit of the <HI>British</HI> Constitution, may be ad∣duced to shew, that it would be for the real Interest of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as well as her Colonies, that the late Regulations should be rescinded, and the several Acts of Parliament imposing Duties and Taxes on the Colonies, and extending the Jurisdiction of the Courts of Admiralty here, beyond their ancient Limits, should be Repeal'd.</P>
<P>We shall not Attempt a minute Detail of all the Reasons which the Wis∣dom of the Honourable House may suggest, on this Occasion, but would humbly submit the following Particulars to their Consideration.</P>
<P>That Money is already become very scarce in these Colonies, and is still decreasing by the necessary Exportation of Specie from the Continent, for the Discharge of our Debts to <HI>British</HI> Merchants.</P>
<P>That immensely heavy Debt is yet due from the Colonies for British Manufactures, and that they are still heavily burthen'd with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> dis∣charge the Arrearages due for Aide granted by them in the late War.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="010424_0023_0FFE75388E520BD0"/>That the Balance of Trade will ever be much against the Colonies, and in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> whilst we consume her Manufactures, the De∣mand for which must ever Increase in Proportion to the Number of Inha∣bitants settled here, with the Means of Purchasing them. We therefore humbly conceive it to be the Interest of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> to increase, rather that diminish, those Means, as the Profits of all the Trade of the Colonies ultimately center there to pay for her Manufactures, as we are not allowed to purchase elsewhere; and by the Consumption of which, at the advanced Prices the <HI>British</HI> Taxes oblige the Makers and Venders to set on them, we eventually contribute very largely to the Revenue of the Crown.</P>
<P>That from the Nature of <HI>American</HI> Business, the Multiplicity of Suits and Papers used in Matters of small Value, in a Country where Freeholds are so minutely divided, and Property so frequently transferr'd, a Stamp Duty must ever be very Burthensome and Unequal.</P>
<P>That it is extremely improbable that the Honourable House of Commons, shou'd at all Times, be thoroughly acquainted with our Condition, and all Facts requisite to a just and equal Taxation of the Colonies.</P>
<P>It is also humbly submitted, Whether there be not a material Distinction in Reason and sound Policy, at least, between the necessary Exercise of Par∣liamentary Jurisdiction in general Acts, for the Amendment of the Common Law, and the Regulation of Trade and Commerce through the whole Em∣pire, and the Exercise of that Jurisdiction, by imposing Taxes on the Colonies.</P>
<P>That the several subordinate Provincial Legislatures have been moulded into Forms, as nearly resembling that of their Mother Country, as by his Majesty's Royal Predecessors was thought convenient; and their Legislatures seem to have been wisely and graciously established, that the Subjects in the Colonies might, under the due Administration thereof, enjoy the happy Fruits of the <HI>British</HI> Government, which in their present Circumstances, they cannot be so fully and clearly availed of, any other Way under these Forms of Government we and our Ancestors have been Born or Settled, and have had our Lives, Liberties, and Properties, protected. The People here, as every where else, retain a great Fondness for their old Customs and Usages, and we trust that his Majesty's Service, and the Interest of the Na∣tion, so far from being obstructed, have been vastly promoted by the Pro∣vincial Legislatures.</P>
<P>That we esteem our Connections with, and Dependance on <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as one of our greatest Blessings, and apprehend the latter will appear to be sufficiently secure, when it is considered, that the Inhabitants in the Colo∣nies have the most unbounded Affection for his Majesty's Person, Family, and Government, as well as for the Mother Country, and that their Subor∣dination to the Parliament, is universally acknowledged.</P>
<P>We therefore most humbly entreat, That the Honourable House would be pleased to hear our Counsel in Support of this Petition, and take our distressed and deplorable Case into their serious Consideration, and that the
<PB N="24" REF="010424_0024_0FFE754238883AA0"/>
Acts and Clauses of Acts, so grievously restraining our Trade and Commerce, imposing Duties and Taxes on our Property, and extending the Jurisdiction of the Court of Admiralty beyond its ancient Limits, may be repeal'd; or that the Honourable House would otherwise relieve your Petitioners, as in your great Wisdom and Goodness shall seem meet.</P>
<P><HI>And your Petitioners as in Duty bound shall ever pray.</HI></P>

<P>(COPY.)

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE had the Honour to be appointed by the House of Representatives of the Province of <HI>Maryland,</HI> a Committee, to meet Committees of the Members of Assembly of the other Colonies, on this Continent, at <HI>New-York,</HI> the First of this Instant, to join in a general, and united, duti∣ful, loyal, and humble Representation of the Condition of those Colonies, to his Majesty and the Parliament, and to implore Relief from the grievous Burthens lately laid upon our Trade, and the Taxes and Duties lately im∣posed on us, especially by the STAMP-ACT.</P>
<P>Accordingly Members from Nine Colonies met, <HI>to wit,</HI> from the <HI>Mas∣sachusetts-Bay, Connecticut, Rhode-Island</HI> and <HI>Providence</HI> Plantations▪ <HI>New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania,</HI> the Government of the Counties of <HI>New-Castle, Kent,</HI> and <HI>Sussex,</HI> upon <HI>Delaware, Maryland,</HI> and <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> but
<PB N="27" REF="010424_0027_0FFE7557F41FEEE0"/>
as you'll find the Address, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Signed only by Members from Six of those Colonies, it may be proper to acquaint you with the Reasons why they did not all Sign, tho' they all concurr'd with the Proceedings.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> Prorogued their Assembly from Time to Time, so that their House had not an Opportunity of appointing Members with full Powers to join, and Sign the Address, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet the Assembly of <HI>New-York,</HI> having at their last Meeting, appointed Five of their Members as a Committee, not only to Correspond with their Agent at Home, but also during the Recess of the House, to write to, and corres∣pond with, the several Assemblies, or Committees of Assemblies on this Continent, on the subject Matter of the several late Acts of Parliament, so Grievous and Dangerous to their Colonies, it was thought proper to admit this Committee to join in the Conferences, and they agreed to what was done, and promised to use their Endeavours with their Assembly to concur also whenever they should be permitted to meet.</P>
<P>The <HI>South-Carolina</HI> Assembly, not rightly viewing the Proposal (which Originally came from the Assembly of the Government of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI>) as it was intended that the several Committees, when met, should Frame and Sign an Address to his Majesty, and Memorial and Petition to the Parliament, to be immediately Dispatch'd by the Congress, Instructed their Members (Messrs. <HI>Lynch, Rutledge,</HI> and <HI>Gadsden,</HI>) to return their Pro∣ceedings to them, for Approbation. The <HI>Connecticut</HI> Assembly made the same Restrictions in their Instructions. The Assembly also of <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> wrote, that they had Resolved, That notwithstanding they were Sensi∣ble such a Representation ought to be made, and approved of the proposed Method for obtaining thereof, yet the present Situation of their Govern∣mental Affairs, wou'd not permit them to appoint a Committee to attend such Meeting, but shou'd be ready to join in any Address to his Majesty and the Parliament they might be honoured with the Knowledge of, probable to answer the proposed End: And the Speaker of the Assembly of <HI>Georgia</HI> wrote, that a Majority of their Members had applied to the Governor to call their Assembly, and he did not think it Expedient, which was the Rea∣son they did not send a Committee as proposed, but requested us to transmit a Copy of our Proceedings to them (which will be done) and that their Assembly wou'd meet about this Time, and he did not doubt but they shou'd Act so as to convince the Sister Colonies of their inviolable Attach∣ment to the Common Cause: We also understood the <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> and we know the <HI>Virginia</HI> Assembly, was Prorogued, whereby they cou'd not have the Opportunity of joining us; so that we doubt not but the Colonies who have not Signed, will very speedily transmit similar Addresses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if their Assemblies should not be hindered from Meeting: And to this Pur∣pose, we hope you'll soon hear from the Assembly of <HI>South-Carolina.</HI> By the Gentlemen of that Colony we were favoured with a Sight of your late Letters, and inform'd of your careful and spirited Conduct with Regard to the Interests of that Colony, and that, together with your Declaration, which we find in those Letters, that you enjoy an independant Seat in the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, induced us (as we have no established Agent at present. for this Province, nor have yet been able to obtain a Law to Tax ourselves
<PB N="28" REF="010424_0028_0FFE755C0A0C1138"/>
for that Purpose) to trouble you with our Request, that you will Present the inclosed Address to his Majesty, and Memorial and Petition to the Houses of Parliament, and exert your utmost Interest and Abilities in behalf of this poor distress'd Country, and of this Province in particular.</P>
<P>We hope as there is a Change in the Ministry, and as the Gentlemen in the House of Commons, may at their next Meeting, take a more enlarged View of the true Interest of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and her Colonies, they will find it to be in supporting the Rights and encouraging the Trade of the lat∣ter, and that the Happiness of the Mother Country and her Colonies must be inseparable, and that we shall obtain Relief.</P>
<P>The several Committees agreed to recommend it to their respective Colo∣nies to appoint Special Agents on this Occasion, and to instruct them to unite their utmost Interest and Endeavours for that Purpose. One Ad∣dress, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was transmitted by the Gentlemen of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> Govern∣ment, immediately to their Agent (Mr. <HI>Jackson</HI> we understood) and we expect the other Colonies will have Duplicates sent to their Agents, and we hope will all unite in Expence and Instructions, to have able Counsel before both the Lords and Commons, as our Petitions pray.</P>
<P>We were intrusted with the Disposition of some Money upon this Occa∣sion, and inclose you a Bill of Exchange, on Messrs. <HI>Capel</HI> and <HI>Osgood Han∣bury,</HI> for One Hundred and Fifty Pounds Sterling, as a Compensation for your Trouble and Expence in this Affair. We doubt not our Assembly will approve of what we do in this Matter; and as they are to meet the last of this Month, we shall lay our Proceedings before them, and 'tis probable they will write you more fully, and furnish you with such further Instruc∣tions and Arguments, as may appear to them to be proper to be given and urged on this Occasion, in Behalf of the Colonies.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>We are, Your most obedient Servants.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
