<P>Ye Hypocrities, Ye can discern the Face of the Skie, but can Ye not discern the Signs of the Times?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THe Occasion of these words, spo∣ken by Christ himself to the <HI>Pharisees</HI> and <HI>Sadduces,</HI> we shall find in the History. We read at the latter end of the foregoing <HI>Chapter,</HI> that Christ had been shewing
<PB N="2" REF="000685_0003_0FA9A2FC66F57708"/>
of his Divine power, in a miraculous feeding of a multitude with a few Loaves and Fishes; which one would have thought should have sufficiently convinced them who he was; even the expected <HI>Messias.</HI> Upon this, in the beginning of this <HI>Chapter,</HI> we have the <HI>Pharisees</HI> and <HI>Sadduces co∣ming to him, and asking a sign of him, verse</HI> 1. And this was just as he had been giving of them an eminent one: So impertinent doth unbelief make men to be. Our Saviour hereupon very suitably in <HI>v.</HI> 2.3. Sharply reproves them for not making use of those Signs which they had: and this reproof he establisheth upon the consi∣deration of their curiosity in observing, and apt∣ness to conclude from their observation of Na∣tural and Fallible Signs with respect to Fair and Foul Weather; in Conjunction with their Dul∣ness and Incogitancy in observing, and Incredu∣lity in concluding about greater, and more Momentous affairs; <HI>Viz. The Signs of the Times.</HI></P>
<P>Our Text is the Reddition of this Comparison, or the Conviction it self which he applies from the foregoing consideration.</P>
<P>In the words then we may observe these Two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. An Exprobation or a Contumelious Title
<PB N="3" REF="000685_0004_0FA9A2FD0A736A40"/>
which he puts upon them; <HI>O ye Hypocrites</HI>: An <HI>Hypocrite</HI> is one that makes a fair and dissembling shew of something that he intends not: these pretended to an earnest desire of being informed about Christ and his Authority, but it was a meer pre<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence.</P>
<P N="2">2. The ground or reason of this Exprobation, <HI>Ye can discern</HI> &amp;c. The Sum is, that they had studied and gotten skill in a matter of so little moment, and yet were unacquainted with things of the highest concernment. <HI>Viz. The Signs of the Times.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A Sign is something that represents some other thing unto us, and gives us some notification about it.</HI> We are by it instructed about something else and we may from it receive information, make obser∣vation, and draw conclusions accordingly.</P>
<P>Now these Signs are either <HI>Natural,</HI> or <HI>Positive</HI> and <HI>Instituted. Natural</HI> are such as have in them a Natural Connexion with the thing signified, or the reason of the signification is in the nature of them. Such were these in the Skie here men∣tioned▪ thus Natural Causes are Signs of those effects that are indicated by them: so proper accidents are Signs of their Subjects; and ma∣ny the like. <HI>Positive</HI> or <HI>Instituted</HI> are such as are so made by appointment, which puts their signi∣fication
<PB N="4" REF="000685_0005_0FA9A2FD73134D58"/>
into them; and that whether of <HI>God</HI> or of <HI>Man.</HI> Of mans appointment; so was <HI>Rahabs Scarlet Thread</HI> to be a <HI>Sign</HI> to the Spies, <HI>Josh</HI> 2.18. Of Gods appointment; so the <HI>Rainbow</HI> was given to <HI>Noah, Gen.</HI> 9.12, 13. And <HI>Circumci∣sion</HI> to <HI>Abraham, Chapt.</HI> 17.10. For a <HI>Sign.</HI> Thus all those things which the Scripture Predicted should come to pass, either as Forerunners, or Concomitants of Christs Coming and Appearance in the Flesh, were to be Signs by which men were to know it, and to Judge of it: and these seem to be more peculiarly the things which Christ aims at in our Text.</P>
<P>There are also <HI>Mixt</HI> and <HI>Moral Signs,</HI> which are partly of <HI>Institution,</HI> and partly have a <HI>Moral Influence</HI> into the things which they signifie; and have a real signification in them.</P>
<P>By the <HI>Signs of the Times</HI> we may here under∣stand such Tokens by which we are advantaged to Judge what Times we are fallen into, and what Prognosticks may be made of them, on a Moral account.</P>
<P>The word here used for <HI>Discerning,</HI> is of a middle signification; it is sometimes used for debating and hesitating in a matter that is dubious and we are at a loss to determine about it; and sometimes for Judging rationally of things, and
<PB N="5" REF="000685_0006_0FA9A2FE31D3F370"/>
drawing Conclusions from premises, whether probable or certain, according to the force there appears to be in them, and in this latter Sense, we are here to take it: Hence.</P>
<P>DOCTRINE</P>
<P>It is an Important Duty lying upon the People of God▪ to labour after a skill in discerning the Signs of the Times which they live in.</P>
<P>Our Saviour here upbraids these <HI>Pharisees,</HI> who were men that pretended high to Religion, and would be thought to out do others in the know∣ledge and practice of it, yet they were unacquain∣ted in this great affair: they were times wherein men were in great expectation, and yet they did not understand these signal discoveries which God then made in his Providence.</P>
<P>The importance of this Duty will briefly ap∣pear, if we lay these things together.</P>
<P N="1">1. That there are varieties of Times which pass over men. The times are not always alike, there are good days, and there are evil days: <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a <HI>day of prosperity,</HI> and a <HI>day of adversity:</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="000685_0007_0FA9A2FEF00941A8"/>
a time of peace and a time of trouble. The wise man makes such an observation as this in, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 3. <HI>begin.</HI> and they are the various aspects of God▪ providence upon men that make these differen∣ces in the times; for it is he who orders all the changes that go over men, whether publick or private, this <HI>David</HI> confesseth in, <HI>Psa.</HI> 31.15. <HI>My times are in thy Hand.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That there are <HI>Signs</HI> of these <HI>Times.</HI> God is wont frequently to foresignify to men what revo∣lutions there are likely to come upon them. There are certain indications or forerunning Symptoms, which as they intimate what the present times are, and what remarks are to be made upon them, so they carry in them the Pregnostick of what days are coming. As to <HI>Natural Signs</HI> which some pretend to from <HI>Astrolo∣gicall</HI> Observations, and Predictions grounded thereupon, I meddle not with them, nor is there any credit to be given to those that do; and it is to be lamented that so many Christians are se∣duced into a good Opinion of them: But as to <HI>Moral</HI> and <HI>Instiiuted</HI> Signs, they are such as God himself hath therefore appointed in his word▪ because he would have men to improve them: as therefore it is his Command, <HI>Jer.</HI> 10.2. <HI>Learn not the way of the Heathen, and be not dismayed at the Signs of Heaven.</HI> so also we have the complaint of the Church in <HI>Psal.</HI> 74.9. <HI>We see not our signs</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="7" REF="000685_0008_0FA9A2FFB009D230"/>3. These signs are capable of being dis∣cerned, not only the things themselves that are signs may be known, but under this consi¦deration as they are so: <HI>i. e.</HI> there may be a discovery made of the thing signified by them. The very reason why God hath appointed them to be signs, is that men may so be instructed by them; and hereupon they would lose their end of being so, if they were not to be understood; nor yet would men come under blame from God for their not discerning of them, as they do, <HI>Text</HI> There are therefore such Rules given us in the word of God, as are for our discretion in this re∣gard, and according unto which we may and ought to judge of the times; only if we would not mistake or fall short in our Judgment, and be led into errour, we must be Critical, and take pains in the Application of these Rules.</P>
<P N="4">4. There are special Duties relating to these times as they are circumstanced. As the dispo∣sing of the times according to his Holy pleasure, is one part of the Government of the World by God; so, as they have any reference to man∣kind, they have a respect to his <HI>special Government,</HI> which always hath an eye to the Law of that Government, according unto which God mana∣geth the affairs of this sort of beings, &amp; for that reason there is a <HI>Moral</HI> consideration to be had of them, because they have a regard to the Rule of Relative Justice, which God hath Fixed: from which it follows, that there are <HI>Moral Duties</HI> to be par¦ticularly
<PB N="8" REF="000685_0009_0FA9A30071A7B738"/>
inferred from them. There is a <HI>voice</HI> in every turn of providence which passeth over men, and it speaks to them, signifying what it is that God requires of them at such a time, and it hyghly▪ concerns them to hear it, that so they may practice accordingly: and these Duties vary as to their specialty, as the times vary; hence that▪ <HI>Eccl.</HI> 7.14. <HI>in the day of Prosperity rejoyce; and in the days of adversity consider.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The way for men to know these Duties is by <HI>Discerning the times.</HI> It is true, there are the General Duties of Religion which are accommo∣dated to all times, we are to <HI>trust in God at all times,</HI> and whatever difficulties and darknesses are upon us, we are to <HI>Pray evermore,</HI> and not to be discouraged at any thing that would perswade us that God hears us not▪ we are without ceasing to <HI>serve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trem∣bling:</HI> these Duties can never be out of season, let the Times be what they will. But there are more particular engagements lying upon us, which are urged from the times, and the argu∣ments to press them upon us are to be fetched from thence: there is a present work to be done, somthing that GOD NOW more eminently calls for, and it is pointed unto by the time it selfe, hence is that reproof given unto them <HI>Jer.</HI> 8.7. <HI>yea the stork in the heavens knoweth her apointed times &amp;c: but my people know not the Judgments of the Lord.</HI> Now, if men do not regard, and there∣upon are unacquainted with the time, how shall
<PB N="9" REF="000685_0010_0FA9A30136D85FF0"/>
they understand what this Duty is that they are now to set upon?</P>
<P N="6">6. The consequence of doing or neglecting of these Duties is very great. A peoples happiness or misery depend upon it: a mistake here may prove wofully hazardous to men. If the times for the present are good▪ they may be either continued or lost, according as men improve them; we may observe what a threatning God utters against them, <HI>Deut.</HI> 28.47.48. because thou servedst not <HI>the Lord with joyfulness and gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things, therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies:</HI> if the times are bad, and men carry not answerable to them, but contrarily, it is the way to make them worse, hear what God saith, <HI>Isa.</HI> 22.12.13. <HI>In that day the Lord of Hosts called to weeping, &amp;c. and behold joy and gladness, &amp;c. surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till you dye.</HI> Nay, if bad times are fore-boded and predicted, men may either precipitate or avert them by their answerable demeanure, how eminently have we this exmplified in the men of <HI>Nineveh: Jonall</HI> 3. and the truth is, men may thank themselves, if after their being thus forewarned, they yet fall into mischief, they might have prevented it, if they had attended the voice of providence, and known the day of their visitation; hence that ex∣postulation, <HI>Isa</HI> 48.18.19. <HI>oh that thou hadst heark∣ned to my commandments, then had thy peace been as a river, &amp;c.</HI> they prove themselves to be but sim∣ple fools; for what saith the wise man? <HI>Prov.</HI> 27.
<PB N="10" REF="000685_0011_0FA9A301EFED5920"/>
12. <HI>The prudent foreseeth the evil and hideth himself, but the simple passeth on and is punished.</HI> Hence then the case I am here to endeavour some resolution of is this.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>By what Rules may we truly and profitably discern the present times?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Here let me premise;</P>
<P N="1">1. That this case may be applied to the Pro∣phetical times mentioned in the Scriptures, which respect that Glorious state of the Church which is believed and expected by the servants of God, in the latter days: That there shall be such a time; that it is stated and determined in the Counsel of God; That there are the signs of its approach∣ing; that the day of it is coming on apace; and that it is our duty soberly to acquaint our selves with the tokens of it, the word of God is our warrant, nor ought they who fear God in <HI>New-England</HI> to look upon themselves or theirs as un∣concerned in it, because they dwell in a re¦mote corner of the earth: But I shall altogether wave this in the present enquiry.</P>
<P N="2">2. It might also be extended generally to the whole affair of the people of God in the world at this day, and it would be a profitable specula∣tion; for if we are bound to <HI>pray for the Peace of Jerusalem,</HI> we ought then to be very inquisitive after the condition which the Church is in, that we may accordingly direct our petitions to God in its behalf, and understand what answer our prayers do receive from him, and to neglect it
<PB N="11" REF="000685_0012_0FA9A303E0FC88C8"/>
will argue that we are but a little concerned a∣bout them. But I shall not directly intend this neither; although the Rules to be given may be generally applicable; hence,</P>
<P N="3">3. I shall direct the resolution of this case more especially to our selves, or this little company of a professing people, in this nook or corner of the world; and let it here be observed; That al∣though, not only Christs <HI>Mystical</HI> body is but one, but also the <HI>Visible</HI> Church of Christ on earth is in some respects but one too, since they do or ought to professe the same God, the same Christ, the same Faith, the same ordinances, and consequently are subjects of the same Government of Christ; yet as they are dispersed up and down in divers places of the world; &amp; therupon are se∣verally combined, the times may be exceedingly diversified unto them, and consequently the signs be very various: Religion may flourish in this place, and it may at the same time be under great decays in another; here there may be good, and there may be bad <HI>Symptoms.</HI> Nor doth this only respect particular Churches, or Congre∣gations, although these also may be very unlike, but the Collective body of them too, as they are involved in a more immediate <HI>Communion</HI> one with another in Sacred and Civil respects: for God is wont to treat with them in his Providence under the Consideration of such a people so combi∣ned, as is evidently to be observed from the word of God.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="000685_0013_0FA9A30486EF5078"/><HI>Signs,</HI> according to the Scripture use of the word, are by <HI>Criticks</HI> ranked under three heads. 1. <HI>Indi∣cative</HI> or <HI>notifying</HI> signs: such as carry in them a discovery of the present State of affairs, and tell men what they are to Judge of things as they now are; or give light for a Prediction of some future events, having a reason in them for this Conclusi∣on, whether <HI>Natural</HI> or <HI>Moral</HI> from which men may raise a conjecture of what is neer at hand, or in great likelihood shortly to come to pass: such are the <HI>signs of the skie</HI> taken notice of <HI>Text.</HI> Thus the Death of <HI>Hophni</HI> &amp; <HI>Phinehas</HI> in one day, were a <HI>sign</HI> to <HI>Eli</HI> of the Accomplishment of all that God had threatned against his family, 1. <HI>Sam.</HI> 2.34. <HI>this shall be a sign unto thee.</HI> 2. <HI>Monitory; viz.</HI> such as carry moral instruction in them to others, and bid them to beware: thus the Judg∣ments of God which befall some sinners for No∣torious sins, are signs to others, admonishing them to consider what they came for, and beware of exposing themselves to the like Judgments by like sins, lest they also suffer as those did; thus <HI>Korah</HI> and his accomplices are said to be <HI>made a sign in Israel, numb.</HI> 26:10, and thus God threatens them to <HI>make them a sign and a Proverb; Ezek.</HI> 14.8.</P>
<P N="3">3. For the <HI>Confirmation</HI> of things done.</P>
<P>There are <HI>Ratifying</HI> Signs. Thus a mans set∣ting of his hand to a Deed is called his Signing of it; and thus <HI>Circumcision</HI> is called a <HI>Sign,</HI> it being given for a Ratification of the Covenant
<PB N="13" REF="000685_0014_0FA9A304EE7F2708"/>
which God made with <HI>Abraham,</HI> Rom. 4.11. but this last is not so much of our present con∣sideration; it being the former which the case in hand hath a more peculiar Relation unto. Now that we may have a right discerning of the present times, there are two things which call for our observation.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>What times are new upon us?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>What aspects there is upon those times?</HI> Or what are the <HI>Symptoms,</HI> and what are <HI>Prognosticks</HI> of the present Times?</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>What times are now upon us?</HI> And this may come under either a <HI>Physical</HI> or <HI>Moral</HI> considera∣tion: and both of them call for our obser∣vation.</P>
<P N="1">1. In a Physical Consideration, times are to be accounted either as good or bad, according to the dispensations of Providence in Mercies or Af∣flictions. There is indeed for the most part a mixture of these, it is seldome that times are so good, as that it can be said of a People, as it was once of them, 1 King. 5.4. <HI>There is neither Adversary, nor evil Occurrent.</HI> Nor is it ordinary, but that the greatest Affliction are tempered with a mixture of many Mercies, so that a Judgment is here to be made according to the prevalent degree of either▪ and by this Rule, <HI>it is now certainly an evil day with this Peo∣ple</HI>: it is beyond question a time of Trouble; and I think I have no need to go about to reason them into a belief of this Assertion, whereof
<PB N="14" REF="000685_0015_0FA9A305B295DFF8"/>
there are so many sensible Demonstrations: and doubtless Sense is a competent Judge of sensible evils: surely seeing and feeling is believing in such a case: there is no perswading of one who is under the apprehension of acute pains which make him to roar, that all is well with him: I may then pass over this a a thing be∣yond doubt.</P>
<P N="2">2. In a moral consideration, and here the great Enquiry will be, whether these Afflictions under which we are, be meerly <HI>probationary,</HI> or not al∣so <HI>paena<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>? There is a very great difference be∣tween these two, and there are Signs by which it is to be proved, and according unto which a judgment is to be made: a mistake here is dan∣gerous, since there are Duties incumbent on us, referring to our State in these respects: to help us in this regard let us observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. I suppose that the Rule which many take up with, <HI>viz.</HI> that private or personal afflictions may be for Trial, but that publick Calamities are always Punishments, or Chastisement for sin, will not hold universally. It may possibly be true for the most part, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it may not be fixed for a certain unerring Rule. That God hath tied himself up to this way of proceeding is hard to determine, since there may be a reason given for his so dealing in way of Trial with a People, as well as with a person: Nor am I able to give any other account of that Remarkable Passage referring to <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 32.1.
<PB N="15" REF="000685_0016_0FA9A3066F13DD58"/>
<HI>After these things and the establishment of them,</HI> Se∣nacherib <HI>King of</HI> Assyria <HI>came and entred into Ju∣dah, and encamped against the Fenced Cities,</HI> &amp;c. when was this, but after <HI>Hezekiah</HI> had wrought an eminent Reformation, and Settled the Mat∣ters of Religion in the Kingdom? and that in <HI>Asa's</HI> Reign Recorded, 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 16. <HI>begin.</HI> seems to carry the same face upon it; just before, in Chap. 15.17. God had testified that the heart of <HI>Asa was perfect all his days.</HI> Out of doubt there are follies in the best times, but God doth not impute them, or chide for them, or take the advantage of them to enter into Controversies with his People, <HI>Psal.</HI> 130.3, 4.</P>
<P N="2">2. Publick Calamities may sometimes be the punishments of some sins that have been long before committed: God is pleased in his Sove∣raignty sometimes to Reserve his Testimony a∣gainst them till afterwards, yea till they that were the principals in the commitring of them are Dead and Gone; so that a People may be called to look a great way back, if they would find out what is the sign in this respect.</P>
<P>There was a famine which came upon Jsrael in <HI>Davids</HI> reign. 2. <HI>Sam</HI> 24. <HI>begin.</HI> but upon inquiry, it was found to be for act of unjust cruelty which <HI>Saul</HI> had committed in his reign, and God tells <HI>Moses</HI> that he will <HI>remember</HI> the sin of makeing the Golden Calf afterwards, <HI>Exed.</HI> 32.34. whence the Jews have a Proverb, <HI>that in every Judgment that after befel them, there was an Ounce of the
<PB N="16" REF="000685_0017_0FA9A3072EFC7140"/>
Calf</HI>: and it is very signal, that if there hath been no publick Testimony of Repentance for such Sins as the Publick hath been involved in, they have just ground to believe that God is in such Afflictions calling of those Sins to remem∣brance, and visiting for them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Afflictions that are <HI>Paenal,</HI> do usually come upon a Generation, for the sins of the Generation that is so Afflicted. It is true, and it often so comes to pass, that their sins may be <HI>Filling Sins</HI>; what saith Christ to the Jews of his time, <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.32. <HI>Fill up the Measure of your Fathers</HI>; but however, God himself hath given us to understand, that if the Children observe their Fathers sins, and take warning by them, and Repent throughly, this shall be prevented, Ezek. 18.14. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so that the reason is because they pursue the same refractory courses, till the <HI>Ephah is full:</HI> and so these are the sins that nextly pull down the Anger of God. Now there are these three signs by which we may discern that the Calamities on a People are not meer Trials, but the effects of Divine Displea∣sure, and say, that God who sends them is angry with such a people.</P>
<P N="1">1. If they are guilty of apparent and sensible <HI>Apostasy.</HI> If a People that walk close with God, and maintain the life of Religion in their Pro∣fession, are notwithstanding thus oppressed with Troubles, they may take this for a Trial, and ac∣cordingly improve it: but if there be notori∣ous
<PB N="17" REF="000685_0018_0FA9A307EFC3FF30"/>
decays and too general declinings either in the Duties themselves, or in the zealous pursuit and practice of them, an increase of sin among them, and now Calamities come upon them, it saith that God is angry, and that he is now punishing of them for these things; for this is according to the threatnings which he hath pronounced: If <HI>Ephesus departs from her first love, and neglecteth her first works,</HI> she thereby endangers <HI>the removing of the Candlestick,</HI> Rev. 2.3.4.</P>
<P N="2">2. If God hath stirred up his Servants to bear witness against these Apostacy's, and they are not hereby reformed. God is wont to warn a Professing People before he strikes them; and if his warnings are sultably entertained, they are to end there, and the compliance of such a people with them, useth to avert the evil: yea though he hath proceeded to severe threatnings against them yet thus there may a stop be put to the execution of them, <HI>Jer.</HI> 18.7.8. It is Gods way to send Messages by his Servants, whom he hath made sensible of the decays under, which a people are fallen, and to stir up an Holy Zeal in them to bear witness against such back-slidings; if these be de∣spised, or not regarded, and the people are not convinced and awakend and reformed; but they hold on in their evil courses, and it may be decline yet more after all, and there is no ap∣pearance of any likelihood that it should be other∣wise; and now calamities come upon them, this can be judged to be no other but the confirmati∣on
<PB N="18" REF="000685_0019_0FA9A308B1DF9400"/>
of his word in the mouth of his Messengers; this therefore is given as a reason of their mise∣ries, <HI>Je.</HI> 44.4, 5, 6. <HI>Howbeit I sent unto you all my Servants the Prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh do not this abominable thing that I hate: But they hearkned not,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth.</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. If they were not reclaimed by the higher and easier afflictions which they felt. God for the most part useth to proceed gradually, and when he hath laid some more gentle strokes up∣on a sinning people that would not be warned to prevent them, he <HI>hearkens to hear</HI> if they will not lay these to heart, and recieve instruction there∣by, so as to be reformed, <HI>Jer.</HI> 8.6 <HI>I hearkned and heard.</HI> But if they are unregardful of these, they do not take the hint of them, but still turn to their old course, and there follow more grie∣vous and distressing troubles, these are Judgments and the manifest fruits of his anger; and this al∣so is consonant to the Rule which himself hath given us of his proceeding in this case, <HI>Levit.</HI> 26.18. <HI>And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.</HI></P>
<P>By these Rules a people maw know themselves to be under the impressions of Divine Anger, and that God is undoubtedly managing a controversy with them: and they are sure signs.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>What aspect there is upon these times?</HI> There are signs whereby we are to Judge, not only what
<PB N="19" REF="000685_0020_0FA9A30974D2CBF0"/>
the times are at present, but also what is their ten¦dency, or what prospect we may have for the fu∣ture of the state of our affairs: and this is an en∣quiry which every one is apt enough to be sollicitous and anxious about, that is under the apprehension of the present distress▪ who is not ready to ask, what hopes there are that the storm will blow over; or must we expect the continu∣ance and encrease of our troubles? and to those that make this enquiry for Good ends, and with an heart desirous to comply with God in his plea∣sure, I shall take leave to offer some General Rules which may be improved to satisfaction in this respect.</P>
<P N="1">1. That all the afflictions which befall a peo∣ple at any time, are brought upon them by God. He challengeth himself to be the author of this sort of evil, whensoever it befalls any; <HI>Am.</HI> 3.6. <HI>Is there any Evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it? Isa.</HI> 45.7. <HI>I form the Light, and create Darkness; I make Peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.</HI> There is therefore his Wisdom, Holiness, Righteousness, concerned in it; these are acts of his special Government ac∣commodated to the Laws of it: he doth these things as he is the <HI>Judge of the whole Earth, and cannot but do right.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That all mediate or second causes that are used in them, are his instruments, and altogether at his dispose. In these things God useth a me∣diate Providence in which he improves Creatures
<PB N="20" REF="000685_0021_0FA9A30B1D232AE0"/>
to afflict a sinful people by; and although some of these are causes by counsel, have wills of their own, act upon deliberation in their own minds, have a meaning, and proceed upon reasons vastly different from, and contrary to Gods design in it; yet they are entirely under the Management of his Providence, as Rods and Swords; and they can do no more than fulfil his counsell, nor can they go one step farther such was the <HI>Assyrian, Isai.</HI> 10.5.7. <HI>Oh Assyrian the Rod of mine Anger, and the staffe in their hand is mine indignation: howbeit he meaneth not so.</HI> So that the whole of these afflictions, and every cir∣cumstance in them is ordered and governed by God.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence there is nothing signal in them, but what he can alter at pleasure. There is a ratio∣nal conjecture which men may raise by obser∣ving the posture of second causes, from whence we may judge of the probabilities of things, and in these it is that carnal wisdom is wont to termi∣nate: but, Christians have farther to look; Let the aspect of second Causes be never so pro∣mising, or never so ill boding, from whence we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> apt either to flatter or frighten ourselves, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> can turn it about in a moment whenever he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> meet<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and he hath many secret unknown ways <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do it in, which cannot possibly be frustrated if once he be resolved. He can make men to change their most obstinate resolutions, as he did by <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> who had made his <HI>heart</HI> so <HI>hardned</HI> a∣gainst
<PB N="21" REF="000685_0022_0FA9A30BB15E3EA0"/>
letting Israel go out of his land. He can find men other work to do, which shall divert them, in the very birth of their malicious designs against his people, as he did by <HI>Saul,</HI> to whom, when he was just ready to sieze David, a <HI>Mes¦senger comes in hast to tell him, the Philistines had in∣vaded the land.</HI> He can fright men with noises in the Air, fill them with Pan<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick fears, and put-them to the run, as he did by <HI>Benhadads</HI> Army that beleagured <HI>Samaria,</HI> and would else in a very little time have possessed themselves of it, and there are many such things as these with him. These Signs therefore, though they are not to be despised, because they are Providentially threatning of calamity, yet they ought not to terrify us, because there is a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or them to be remedied, by engaging God to take our part; and a people may lay as, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.31. <HI>If God be for us, who shall be against us.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Though God be angry with a sinning people yet he is placable. His anger may be turned away, and his wrath be appeased towards them though the case be dangerous yet it is not despe∣rate. He is a <HI>God of mercy, and there is forgiveness with him that he may be feared</HI>: he is a God of Compassion, and is <HI>Prone to Pardon,</HI> he hath relent∣ing bowels, and hath exemplified this in Remar∣kable instances, to encourage men to hope in him, notwithstanding their sins have procured his dis∣pleasure against them: even an ungodly <HI>Ahab,</HI> one who had sold himself to do wickedness, if upon
<PB N="22" REF="000685_0023_0FA9A30C70AE6ED0"/>
the severe threatnings of God declared by the Pro∣phet he <HI>Humbleth himself, puts on sackcloth, and walks softly</HI> shall be so far taken notice of, that the Judgment shall be deferred as to the Compleat execution of it: 1 <HI>Kings.</HI> 21.29. even an Idolatrous &amp; flagitious <HI>Nineveh,</HI> who were arrived at the height of wickedness, if upon the Preaching of <HI>Jonah,</HI> they <HI>Fast</HI> and <HI>reform</HI> from their debaucheries and oppressions, shall experience his favour, and he will <HI>repent of the evil</HI> which he was ready to bring upon them, <HI>Jon.</HI> 3 9. and what do these stand upon record for, but to encourage sinful men, and People to seek Gods mercy in the way of a true and through Repentance?</P>
<P N="5">5. Hence he offers fair terms, and makes Gra∣cious Promises in case they be complied withal, God is not only wont to give men warning of what he is about to do, before he smites them with af∣flictions, that so they may be cautioned to avoid them, by taking due and proper courses to that end, but he also vouchsafes to send them messages when they are under the rod, and feel the smart of it, in which he invites them to a compliance, with him upon easy &amp; fair terms; assuring them that if they do accept of them he will put a stop to his anger, and return again unto them in mer∣cy, and this not once nor twice, but very often. How many such errands, as these were the Pro∣phets of old sent upon to the people of <HI>Israel</HI>▪ in evil times? yea and when he had so sent them, God <HI>hearkned diligently</HI> to hear what entertainment
<PB N="23" REF="000685_0024_0FA9A30D31B17750"/>
they found as one, that would have taken great de¦light in the good success of them, <HI>Jer.</HI> 8 6.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is of God to work these te<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms in men That a sinful people do not comply with them is their own fault, and will be charged upon them as the fruit of their obstinacy, and rebellious frame of heart: but that they do entertain them is of Gods grace: there is in the depraved nature of man a corrupt principle of enmity which sets him against any subjection to the will of God, so that if he leaves men to their own carelessness &amp; stupidity they never will hearken to him; &amp; this dereliction is Judicial; but if they be made sensible of their folly, &amp; become <HI>willing and obedient,</HI> this is the work of his own spirit in them. It is the com¦plaint which <HI>Moses</HI> makes over them, <HI>Deu..</HI> 29.3, 4. <HI>The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs and the miracles; yet the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day</HI>; when therefore God invites sinful men to turn to him, it concerns them to pray unto him to turn them; so do they, <HI>ps.</HI> 80 <HI>ult. turn us again oh God of our Salvation.</HI> True Repentance, on which these offers of mercy are made unto men, is a Gift of God; &amp; till he works it in them, all means will fail of effecting it.</P>
<P N="7">7. Hence, if God do bring them unto this, it is a sure sign for good; it is an evidence that will never fail those in whom it is truly to be found: other grounds of hope, which men are ready to nourish their expectations withal, nay, and very often do prove to be vain presumptions; but this never will. God for that reason gives a people an heart to turn to him from their Backslidings, because he hath a
<PB N="24" REF="000685_0025_0FA9A30DF1F0E1B0"/>
mind to return to them in mercy. The promise is full which is in the Word of God made to this Condition▪ and God would have an afflicted peo∣ple to try him, and see whether he will fail of his word or no, <HI>Mal.</HI> 3.10. <HI>Prove me now herewith saith the Lord,</HI> &amp;. Let a people be never so much dege∣nerated, and for it never so sorely distrest; yea let them be all the black tokens imaginable in the face of Providence, of more troubles like to fall upon them; let all the whole course of second causes bode never so ill, yet i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that people do humble them selves deeply before him, stir up themselves in good
earnest to seek God, and all orders of men among them, do in their places according to their advan∣tages, set themselves heartily and strenuously <HI>to put away the evil that is gotten among them, and amend all their evil ways and doings that have not been good</HI>; there is no doubt to be made of it, but that God will save them and do them good: his word is past for it, and he will never recede from it.</P>
<P N="8">8. And till God doth this for them, they abide under the threatning. The Dealings of God with an Heathen World, are upon his meer Prerogative, for as they stand in relation to the Old Covenant, so they are Condemned to all misery, and their ve∣ry lives are spared upon meer Indulgence, and he measures out his Mercy or his Wrath to them in this World according as he sees meet: whereas he treats with a Professing People, who are in visible Covenant with him, according to the tenour of that Covenant, in which there are Conditionate Promi∣ses and Threatnings. Now what concerns such a
<PB N="25" REF="000685_0026_0FA9A30EAFC13840"/>
People as they are a Body, or a Company of Pro∣fessors standing under the Obligations of such a Co∣venant, referrs unto this life and the Affairs of it, for they will not be considered or treated after this life as a people; and the terms do here so run, as we have the account of them, Isa. 1.19, 20. <HI>If ye be waking and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the Land, but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be Devoured with the Sword, &amp;c.</HI> other Scripture Expressions to the same purpose. As long then as such a people are not wrought up to a compliance with these terms on which Salvati∣ons are promised, the threatning under which they were must continue upon them; &amp; therefore what∣ever God may do for them in his Soveraignty, a li∣berty whereof he reserves to himself, and sometimes makes use of it, first to save them, &amp; then to reform them, and make these his mercies to be mel<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing means to bring them to Repentance, as Ezek. 36.31 <HI>then shall you remember your evil ways,</HI> &amp;c. (i. e. when he had returned and settled them in Peace &amp; Prosperity: yet as to their present state they are a threatned people, and have all reason to expect the Judgments of God.</P>
<P N="9">9. Hence there are these signs by which we may discern the evil of evil times to be in a likely way to continue and increase.</P>
<P N="1">1. It iniquity abide and abound among a People after all that God hath done. Not that any times are here to be expected so good, as that there shall be no Iniquity in them; there will be found some of the worst of men in the best of times and places; but if the same sins which procured the Judgments for
<PB N="26" REF="000685_0027_0FA9A30F6EF82798"/>
them, do remain under the same circumstances, or are rather growing into more power and prevalen∣cy, (and indeed Apostasy is seldome at a stay, till such time as God turns the heart of such a people to himself again, but goes in a gradual progress) it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that there is more wrath against them. It is a truth in morals as well as in naturals, that <HI>if the Cause abide the effect is not like to cease.</HI> The afflictions which <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such a people, are Divine Testimonies against such sins as God hath warned them of, &amp; threatned them for, and they call men to repent of them; and if they do not comply with this call, the Provoeation continues, &amp; God hath said it, that he will go on to punish them, <HI>Lev.</HI> 26. if such men should say, is there no peace to be expected, his answer to them would be like his to him, 2 <HI>King.</HI> 9.22. <HI>What peace so long as these Whoredoms abide?</HI> and therefore God pronounceth that Wo upon <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in <HI>Jer.</HI> 13.27. <HI>Wo to thee Jerusalem, wilt thou not be made clear? when shall it once be?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 If the affliction that God brings upon them make them worse, instead of reforming them. Those trou∣bles which God brings a profesing people into, after such time as warnings and threatnings have been des∣pised by them, do belong unto the Discipline which he useth with such as are in Covenant with him: they are therfore called his <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrections,</HI> and <HI>Chastenings</HI>: the use therefore and improvement which they ought to make of them is to <HI>receive instruction</HI> by them: they are the tokens and witnesses of Gods Holy anger, an,d call upon men to see his hand, and seek his reconciled savour; and in this way only can they im∣prove
<PB N="27" REF="000685_0028_0FA9A3102EE3A980"/>
them either to Gods acceptance, or their own advantage: If then instead of this they grow more obstinate, and hold their iniquities the faster, and that under the very hand of God, &amp; his awful Judgments that are upon them, when he said <HI>surely they will re∣ceive instruction,</HI> &amp; presumed that in <HI>their affliction they would seek him early</HI>; what is this but to stout it out a∣gainst God; and that must needs be a very ill bod∣ing Symptom. This is the fearful brand which God him self sets upon <HI>Ahaz.</HI> 2. <HI>Chron.</HI> 28.22. <HI>and in the time of his distress did he yet trespass more against the Lord; this is that King Ahaz.</HI> God is very angry when it is so, and declares against it, as that which highly provokes him, he therefore so articleth a∣gainst them in <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.30. <HI>In vain have I smitten your Children, they received no Correction</HI>; and it provokes him to give over Correcting them, and take a more awful course with them; to lay by the rod, and to take the Sword into his hand: to turn castigatory punishments into vindictive; hence that <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.5. <HI>why will you be smitten any more? ye will revolt more and more, q. d.</HI> you grow worse and worse under all the disciplicary means that are used with you, it is there∣fore high time to give them over, and take another way; there is nothing now but desolation that re∣mains. All the endeavours that are used for Refor∣mation prove unsuccessful. It is sometimes so, that <HI>there is Balm in Gilead, and a Physician there,</HI> and vet there is no good done for it. There are those among a professing People who do Zealously set themselves against the sins of the times and places they live in, and would fain be instrumental, if it might be, of
<PB N="28" REF="000685_0029_0FA9A310F0EE0428"/>
promoting a sincere and through Reformation a∣mong their People, but all their most prudent and Vigilant endeavours fail and are lost; the same ini∣quities abide, and get head in the midst of them; Sy∣nods may be solmenly convened, provoking evils di∣ligently sought out, suitable remedies faithfully pre∣scribed, wholsome Laws prudently enacted, Churches be called upon to, and engaged in the renewal of the Covenant, and after all this, nothing may be amended; or if the wound be a little skinned over for a while, it breaks out again presently, and more fearfully. Thus it was with the Kingdom of <HI>Judah</HI> in the times of <HI>Joash,</HI> as is at fully recorded in 2 <HI>Chr</HI> 24. yea, and how much better was it in the times of that excellent <HI>Josiah</HI>? we may read the com∣plaint that God makes against them, in the Book of <HI>Zephaniah,</HI> and that threatning denounced, Chap. 1.12, 13. and what indeed is there in such a case to be expected, but that God should cause his Wrath to fall upon such a people.</P>
<P N="4">4. If Rulers are left to do things which are great∣ly provoking unto God, <HI>Delirant Reges, plectuntur Activi.</HI> The Error of Rulers in their places are wont to have awful influence upon the Condition of that people over whom they are set; and the gross mis∣takes of these will make all to suffer: for they are publick persons, and the Representatives of their People. If <HI>Saul</HI> in his zeal thinks that the <HI>Gibeonites</HI> ought to be cut off, because they were among the number of the once devoted people; &amp; we know that the former Judges had erred in their suffering of them, and for that reason had been for so many
<PB N="29" REF="000685_0030_0FA9A3129F4DA048"/>
ages afflicted; and hereupon he attempts; a <HI>three years famine</HI> is procured to the Land by it; 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 21. <HI>begin.</HI> yea good and wise men have been some∣times left by God when he hath been angry with a people, hereby to procure more Judgments for them, so it was in <HI>Davids</HI> case, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24.1. <HI>the An∣ger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and he mov∣ed David to say, Go Number the People.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5 If a Spirit of Division be gotten amongst a people. If when the hand of God is heavy upon them, they, instead of joyning heart and hand in seeking after a redress of those things, which God is provoked by▪ do fall into dissentions, and there are divided judgments &amp; divided hearts among them; so that they study and endeavour to thwart one the other, &amp; to impede each other in all attempts for good; whereupon nothing can go forward, but all things are put under an una∣voidable check; this carries a very ill Omen in it; it is in it self a great punishment, and tending to many mischievous events that will naturally arise from it. Some good Interpreters so understand that in, <HI>Hos.</HI> 10.2. <HI>Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty.</HI> It is indeed a terrible thing, for a people to be left to such a frame, that when providences call for u∣nanimous endeavours in averting the wrath of God and their safety mainly depends on their unity, they expose themselves to become a prey, by their divi∣sions, <HI>Isa.</HI> 9.21.</P>
<P N="6">6. If Gods faithful messengers are dispised, and their advise is trampled upon. It hath been an usu∣al thing for God to stir up his servants in the Mini∣stry, to bear their testimony at such times, to declare a¦gainst
<PB N="30" REF="000685_0031_0FA9A3132EDD6020"/>
the sins which are Prevailing, and by which Gods displeasure hath bin stirred up; &amp; to give coun∣sels and warnings to His People, both publick and private; and it belongs to their office so to do, and Gods warrant will bear them out in it: but if they be scorned, and their counsels are disregarded, and they themselves are censured as those that meddle with that which they have nothing to do withal; it is an ill sign. Such a people shall <HI>know</HI> before God hath done <HI>that they had Prophets. Asa</HI> is angry and inraged at the Prophet who brought him a message from God, but it occasioned him more trouble, 2 <HI>Chro.</HI> 16. <HI>Amaziah</HI> bids the Prophet who came to reprove him for his Idolatry, to meddle with own business, and not to talk to him; but what follows? 2. <HI>Chron.</HI> 25.16. <HI>I know, that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkned unto my counsel. Elijah is</HI> counted by <HI>Ahab</HI> to be the <HI>troubler of</HI> Israel, because he bore a faithful Testimony against <HI>Israels</HI> sins: and <HI>Jeremiah</HI> is voted to be a <HI>Man of death,</HI> for his seri∣ous warnings and admonitions, but these were fearful presages of growing calamities, and were accordingly followed therewithal. God will be deeply provoked at such things, and answerable fruits ate to be expected. These are some of those Rules that are to be made use of in judging of the Times: and the application belongs to every one to make according as they are concerned.</P>
