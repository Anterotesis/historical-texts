</FIGURE> CANADA SUBJECTED. —A New Song.—</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>BRAVE Soldiers all, both far and near,</L>
<L>Lay by your Swords and never fear:</L>
<L>For now the Battle being o'er,</L>
<L>The thund'ring Cannon cease to roar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lay by the Trumpet and the Drum;</L>
<L>For joyful Days at last are come,</L>
<L>And CANADA is all our own,</L>
<L>And subject to great GEORGE's Throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The <HI>Savages</HI> lay down their Arms.</L>
<L>The <HI>French</HI> do cease to raise Alarms.</L>
<L>Now CANADA is fallen down</L>
<L>Before the Troops of GEORGE's Crown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great was the Day of our Success,</L>
<L>When Heav'n our Hosts was pleas'd to bless.</L>
<L>When proud <HI>Quebec</HI> and <HI>Montreal</HI></L>
<L>A Prey to <HI>English</HI> Troops did fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let martial Music sound no more;</L>
<L>We have no Foes upon the Shore:</L>
<L>But now we joyfully will sing,</L>
<L>And drink a Health to GEORGE our King.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We'll beat our Swords into Plough-shares,</L>
<L>And into Pruning-hooks our Spears;</L>
<L>And bloody Fighting we'll deny,</L>
<L>And follow honest Husbandry.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Rejoice, O <HI>Youth!</HI> the rising Age,</L>
<L>May you not need in War 't engage;</L>
<L>May ev'ry Thing succeed so well,</L>
<L>That Peace with you may ever dwell!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold the bloody Sons of <HI>Gaul!</HI></L>
<L>Rejoice with Trembling at their Fall.</L>
<L>The Blood which cruelly they shed</L>
<L>Has fall'n on their own guilty Heads.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some Time ago their Joy was loud,</L>
<L>And CANADA grew very proud;</L>
<L>While we were mourning in Distress,</L>
<L>With Widows and the Fatherless.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We've took their Towns, and so possess</L>
<L>Their Pastures and the Wilderness.</L>
<L>Triumphant News spreads thro' the Land,</L>
<L>That we have got the Upper-hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye holy Prophets now rejoice,</L>
<L>And ye GOD's Saints that hear his Voice;</L>
<L>Because the Lord hath saved you</L>
<L>From Insults of the <HI>Popish</HI> Crew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With them was found the Blood of Slain,</L>
<L>And on their Robes there was a Stain;</L>
<L>They drunken were with Christian Blood,</L>
<L>Which flowed down like as a Flood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, happy Day!—the blushing Morn</L>
<L>With Pleasure may our Souls adorn,</L>
<L>When proud <HI>Montreal</HI> became a Prey;</L>
<L>We'll ever bless the glorious Day!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! when will come the happy Hour,</L>
<L>Which will destroy all <HI>Babel</HI>'s Pow'r!</L>
<L>When will the blessed Morning come,</L>
<L>When <HI>Babylon</HI> receives her Doom!—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Time in Haste is coming on,</L>
<L>The End of haughty <HI>Babylon:</HI></L>
<L>The joyful Cry shall quickly be,</L>
<L>"She's like a Stone sunk in the Sea!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Time will come, when Pope and Fry'r</L>
<L>Shall both be roasted in the Fire;</L>
<L>When the proud <HI>Antichristian</HI> Whore</L>
<L>Will sink, and never <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more.</L>
