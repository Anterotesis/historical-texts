<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Doctrine which Concerns the Ministry of HOLY ANGELS, is a Subject most worthy to be Searched into. Several Learned Men have Published Elaborate &amp; Solid Discourses thereon: In sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cial <HI>Zanchy, Ri∣vius, and Stuckius.</HI> There are also sundry Useful <HI>English</HI> Treatises, in which this Argument is Judi∣ciously Handled. Particularly, by Bishop <HI>Hall,</HI> Mr. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ambrose</HI>; This notwith∣standing, a Learned Divine Laments, that there are so few Books Written, or Sermons Preached, concerning the Angels, of whom the Scripture speaks so much. I have from that Consideration been Induced to Publish what is Emitted here∣with. As for <HI>Philosophical Questions</HI> about the Na∣ture of Angels, and the way of their Understand∣ing Things, whether it be <HI>Per Species Intelligibiles Insitas vel Acquisitas,</HI> and many the like, which <HI>Thomists</HI> and <HI>Scotists</HI> have such wrangling Contests about, I have wholly declined them. <HI>Heerboord</HI> in his Select Disputations, and <HI>Schiebler,</HI> in his
<PB REF="000756_0006_0FAA491479D6CB10"/>
<HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>taphysicks,</HI> are among the clearest Authors, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Treat on those Speculations, whose Books are in the Hands of Scholars. To offer such things un∣to a Popular Auditory, would be to feed them with Stones instead of Bread. Nor have I deter∣mined any thing concerning that Problem, <HI>Whe∣ther every man has a particular Angel to be his constant Companion, from the time of his Birth to his Death?</HI> The <HI>Platonicks,</HI> and other <HI>Philosophers</HI> among the Gentiles of old, did believe it, unto an high De∣gree of Superstition: A Magician advised <HI>Antho∣ny</HI> not to contend with <HI>Augustus,</HI> because he said the <HI>Genius</HI> of <HI>Augustus,</HI> was the most Powerful▪ The Jews are perswaded, that there is an Ange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Guardian deputed to each particular man. Thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Cabbalists,</HI> (which are too much favoured by <HI>Mersennus</HI>) undertake to tell us, what were the Names of the Angel Guardians belonging to <HI>Adam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Shem,</HI> and <HI>Abraham.</HI> V. <HI>Gassendi Examen Fludd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Philos. p.</HI> 243. Another Author (<HI>Caesar Longinus, p.</HI> 476.) tells us, who were the Angels of <HI>Joseph, Joshua, David Elisha,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Psellus</HI> has Written a Book <HI>De proprio Daemone.</HI> And all the Pontificial Doctors mentain the Affirmative of the <HI>Problem</HI> mentioned, unto which also some Eminent Prote∣stant Divines incline, though not as Comprehen∣ding every man, only every Elect Vessel; groun∣ding their Belief chiefly on those two Scriptures, <HI>Math.</HI> 18.10. and <HI>Acts</HI> 12.15. The very Learn∣ed, and very Pious Doctor <HI>Rivet,</HI> (according to his usual manner) expresseth himself with grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="000756_0007_0FAA4914E65F0B38"/>
Caution and Judgment concerning it. <HI>That every One of them, who shall be Heirs of Salvation, has, besides what may be, with him on extraordinary Occa∣sions, always One particular Angel with him, he suppo∣ses it to be a probable Truth, and that it is not against the Scripture. Nevertheless, that we cannot from thence Infer, that it is alwayes the same Angel</HI>: He adds, <HI>That it is an Opinion not worth the Contending about.</HI></P>
<P>I have therefore Declined that Question, and endeavoured (so far as I am able to Discern) to keep unto clear Scripture Revelation, in what I have delivered; and so to speak, as that the most ordinary Capacities might Understand and be Edified. I have not Liesure to Transcribe my own Notes: Therefore, These Sermons (as well as some, on other Subjects lately sent to the Press) are Pub∣lished, as they were taken from me, in Short-Hand, by One of my Hearers. I have perused them, and here Present them without any great Alteration. The Ingenuous Reader will pardon the Inculcations in them, considering to whom they were Preached, and for whose sake they are, in this way made publick.</P>
<P>ANGELS (both the Good and Evil Ones) have a greater Influence on this World, than men are generally aware of. <HI>Monitions</HI> of Dan∣gers, and of Great Changes are oftentimes from Good Angels. <HI>Beza</HI> was strangely affected with a Dream, which he Communicated to the Magi∣strates of <HI>Geneva,</HI> by means whereof the City
<PB REF="000756_0008_0FAA4915B48BF720"/>
was Saved from an Impending Mischief. This could not be from an Evil Angel. Nevertheless, Providence does sometimes Permit and Order Moni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions of Future Evils by them: Thus <HI>Brutus</HI> was by a <HI>Daemon</HI> Fore-warned of his Death. Arch-bishop <HI>Spotwood</HI> Writes, that One of the Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> was terrified with the Vision of a Person, whom he had caused to Sin much a∣gainst his Conscience, who C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed to him. <HI>Wo worth the Day that ever I knew thee, for because I have sought to please thee against God and His Ser∣vants, I am now adjudged to the Torments of Hell.</HI> The next morning he understood, that that man was dead, and that he dyed just at the Hour, when he appeared to him, after that affrighting manner. He also dreamed that Sir <HI>James Ha∣milton,</HI> whom he had caused to be Executed, came to him with a Drawn Sword, and therewith cut off both his Arms, whilst he was musing what should be the meaning of that Dream, News was brought him of the Death of both his Sons. Our <HI>English</HI> Histories report, that the Lord <HI>Stanly,</HI> had a Dream, in which it seemed to him, that a Boar Gored him, and the Lord <HI>Hastings</HI>; and because the D. of <HI>Glocester</HI> gave the Boar for his Arms or Cognizance, it made a dreadful Impres∣sion upon his Spirit, that mischief was by him se∣cretly intended ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inst them. He that Night sent to the Lord <HI>Hastings</HI> about it, who looked on it, as no more than a Dream or Phansy; but the next day, the Lord <HI>Stanly</HI> was Wounded, and the
<PB REF="000756_0009_0FAA4916C279DD88"/>
Lord <HI>Hastings</HI> was Murthered by the Bloody Treachery of that Boar, the D. of <HI>Glocester,</HI> who was afterwards K. <HI>Richard</HI> 3. And we know from the Scripture, that an Evil Angel foretold, the Fall of <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Jonathan,</HI> and the Great Mutations, which should then happen, in the Kingdom of <HI>Israel.</HI> Jewish Commentators say, that the Reason, why <HI>Saul</HI> cut off the Witches throughout the Land, was, because they Foretold that <HI>David</HI> should be King. I Remember, that once in Discourse with the Learned Doctor <HI>Spen∣cer,</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> concerning his Book of Prodi∣gies, he said to me, that his Judgment was, <HI>That the Evil Angels had</HI> Praenotions <HI>of many Future Things, and did accordingly give strange</HI> Premoni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣ons <HI>of them.</HI> No doubt it is often so, and yet as <HI>Lavater, Schottus,</HI> and others have noted, there are sometimes Things signified by <HI>Angels,</HI> which it is not easy to determine of what sort those <HI>Genii</HI> are. What shall be thought of the <HI>Phantom,</HI> which appeared to General <HI>Vesselini,</HI> assuring him that he might take the City of <HI>Muran,</HI> by the Assistance of a Widow which Lived in that Ci∣ty, which strangely came to pass accordingly, in the Year 1644. There comes to my mind a very Unaccountable Thing, which happened at <HI>London</HI> above Thirty Years ago. It was this, One Mr. <HI>Cutty</HI> (an honest Citizen) passing between <HI>Milk-street</HI> and <HI>Wood street</HI> in <HI>Cheap-side,</HI> on <HI>March</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> 1664. took up a Letter Sealed. The Superscripti∣on whereof was these words following; <HI>From
<PB REF="000756_0010_0FAA49175FB03690"/>
Geneva, to a Friend.</HI> Within the Letter these words were Written.
<Q>This is to give both timely and speedy Notice, that in the Year 1665. in the latter end of <HI>May,</HI> shall begin a Plague, and hold very Hot, till the latter end of <HI>December,</HI> and then cease, but not quite; and then go on, till the latter end of the Spring the next Year. And in 1665 and 66. putting both together, shall not only happen a Plague, but great Sea Fights, such as the like was scarce ever heard of; and this shall not be all, but in the Year 1666. on the Second of <HI>September,</HI> shall happen a Fire, that shall Burn down One of the Eminentest Cities in the World.</Q>
Mr. <HI>Cutty</HI> carried the Letter to the then Lord Mayor. A Reverend Divine in <HI>London,</HI> who was of his Ac∣quaintance, had a Copy of it, before the sad Things here Praedicted came to pass; and at my last being at <HI>London,</HI> was pleased to favour me with it, as 'tis here Related. This Account bing certainly true, and very surprizing, I thought it not unworthy the Publication.</P>
<P>As for the annexed Discourse, concerning <HI>Ange∣lical Apparitions,</HI> more Instances than one or two, here in <HI>New-England,</HI> of Appearing Pretended Angels, have made it necessary, that something should be Written to prevent the Deception of several that have been, and of others, that were in Eminent Danger of being Imposed upon. Some may think it Extraordinary, That such Things should happen in a Place, where the Light of
<PB REF="000756_0011_0FAA4918186813D0"/>
the Gospel (which has ever been wont to shine away the Angels of Darkness) does prevail. But it is no new thing for men to be thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded. Some Good men have Credited strange Relations about <HI>Apparitions of Saints Departed,</HI> as well as of Angels. <HI>Eusebius,</HI> in his Ecclesiastical History, (<HI>Lib.</HI> 6. <HI>cap.</HI> 4.) reports that <HI>Potamiaena,</HI> three days after her Martyrdom, appeared to <HI>Basilides,</HI> and caused him to turn a Christian; and after∣wards to many in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> on whom the <HI>Ap∣parition</HI> ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the like Effect. Fabulous Relations (and such I take those of <HI>Eusebius</HI> to be) are more like to Confirm Infidels, than to make Christians.</P>
<P>I have reason to believe, that it has been a sig∣nal Mercy to this Country, that the pretended Angels have been suspected to be no better than <HI>Satan transforming himself into an Angel of Light.</HI> Nor is it at all to be wondred at, that the Spirits of Darkness should be able to Deceive mens Sen∣ses; making them believe that they see that which is not. A man that is Skilled in Opticks, may Impose on the Senses of others, as did <HI>Descartes,</HI> when he caused Admiration in his Friend <HI>Brassieus</HI> by Representing to him a Company of Souldiers, marching in his Chamber; but this proceeded from the small Figures of Souldiers which he concealed, and by a Glass brought such multiplied without doors. And who, that has Read <HI>Porta, Longi∣nus, Zimara, Weckerus,</HI> or such like Writers, knows not that by Natural, without Superstitious Magic,
<PB REF="000756_0012_0FAA4918A0BA0188"/>
Things of this Nature may be done? How easy then is it for <HI>Daemons,</HI> who have a perfect Under∣standing in <HI>Opticks,</HI> and in the Power of Nature to deceive the Eyes, and delude the Imaginations of Silly Mortals?</P>
<P>It was in my thoughts to have Written some∣thing concerning that Power, which by the Per∣mission, and Righteous Judgment of God, the E∣vil Angels have over the sinful, miserable Chil∣dren of men. There are some, who will not Believe, that ever a Wizzard or C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>njurer should be able to set the Devils upon their Neighbours, or that those Infernal Spirits should have Power to Hurt them. But the Scriptures assures us, that <HI>Balak</HI> sent for that Infamous Southsayer <HI>Balaam,</HI> to Curse his Enemies, which he would never have do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> if it had not been a thing notoriously known, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat <HI>Balaam</HI> could by his Charms do such things. And the reason of his being no more affrighted when his Ass spoke to him, was doubt∣less because he did not at first think that it was a Good Angel that spoke, but rather one of those Evil Spirits with whom he had maintained a fa∣miliar Conversation. Nor can it be denyed, but that there are cursed Books in the World, which Instruct men what Ceremonies they must use, and what Words they must utter, that so when the <HI>Signals</HI> which are of the Devils <HI>Institution,</HI> are observed, he may do what his Worshippers desire of him, so far as the most High shall give him
<PB REF="000756_0013_0FAA491AC62EBF98"/>
Leave, without whose Permission he cannot so much as enter into any man's Swine. The Superstitious Gentiles of Old, set a very High Price on such DIABOLLICAL-BOOKS. The Converted <HI>Ephesians</HI> burnt those Books, and they counted the Price of them, and found it to be Fifty thousand Pieces of Silver, which amounts to One Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Two Pounds, Ten Shillings, English Money, <HI>Acts</HI> 19.19. Because the <HI>Ephesians</HI> were notorious for doing Mischief by Magical Spells [<HI>EPHESIA GRAM∣MATA</HI>] became a Proverb. That such In∣struments of Satan cannot always hurt whom they would is most certain. <HI>Cyprian</HI> (who was after∣wards a famous Minister and Martyr) found it to be so, when he made the Attempt. It is Related in the Life of <HI>Ambrose,</HI> that Magicians did in vain seek to do him Hurt. One that many years since was Executed at <HI>Hartford,</HI> in <HI>Connecti∣cut</HI>-Colony, on the Account of Witchcraft, con∣fessed, that she had Employed Evil Spirits to be Revenged on several; but that when she would have had them do the like to Mr. <HI>Stone</HI> (the Eminent Teacher of the Church there) they told her, they had not leave to do it: Nor is this to be Evaded by saying some Persons (as of late in <HI>New England</HI>) have falsly accused themselves, for this Person was upon Rational Grounds, thought to be a true Penitent, before her death. We cannot argue, that because some have failed in their cursed Attempts, that therefore never
<PB REF="000756_0014_0FAA491AEC839588"/>
any Succeeded. But the known Success of many was that which Emboldned others to Endeavour the like. Some of the Indian <HI>Pawaws (i. e.</HI> Wiz∣zards) in this Country, having received the Gos∣pel, and given Good Evidence of a True Conver∣sion to God in Christ, have, with much sor∣row of Heart, declared how they had, whilst in their <HI>Heathenism,</HI> by the hands of Evil Angels Murdered their Neighbours. There are, who, by <HI>Spells</HI> or Muttering a few words, have caused Diseases to be Removed from those, that have applyed themselves to them. It is Impudence to Deny this, since the Persons are Extant among us, concerning whom it is to be Averred. But if the <HI>Charms</HI> of Impious <HI>Sorcerers,</HI> will cause Invisible Agents, to heal Diseases, Reason says, they may as well have Power to Inflict them. These are plain, clear Arguments, and it is more easy to Slight and Ridicule them, than to give a Refuta∣tion of them. But of this, no more, nor have I mentioned These Things, as expecting that <HI>Sad∣duces</HI> or <HI>Semisadduces,</HI> who are Judicially harden∣ed in their Error, will be Convinced and Conver∣ted (for no Arguments in the World will ever do that) Nevertheless, others will be Confirmed in the Truth thereby.</P>
<P>We ought to Admire the Grace of God to∣wards us Sinful Creatures, in that, He has ap∣pointed His Holy Angels to Guard us against the Mischiefs designed by Wicked Spirits, who are
<PB REF="000756_0015_0FAA491BF0CEFEC0"/>
alwayes Intending our Hurt, both as to our Bodies and Souls. After the Psalmest had said, <HI>The An∣gel of the Lord Encampeth round about them that Fear Him, and delivereth them,</HI> he adds immedi∣ately O! <HI>Tast and see that the Lord is Good</HI>; herein <HI>Good,</HI> in bestowing such a <HI>Guard</HI> upon us. It was (as that Great Divine Doctor <HI>Arrowsmith</HI> well observes) an Act of Royal Benignity towards <HI>Mordecai,</HI> in King <HI>Ahashuerus,</HI> to make the chief Favourite in the Court his Attendant; but how much Greater is this Kindness? That the Blessed Angels, those Fevourites in the Court of Hea∣ven, should be Ministring Spirits for them, that shall be Heirs of Salvation! Although they are Ministring Spirits, we may not suppose them to be our Servants, no more than the Shepherd is the Servant of the Sheep, whom his Master Commands him to look after. They are in themselves far more Noble Creatures than we are, Nevertheless, out of Obedience to GOD Their Father, and Our's, and out of Love to us, their Younger Brethren, of whom they have a most tender Care, they do, without Grudging, per∣form the Charge committed to them, as Dr. <HI>Fuller</HI> expresses it: The <HI>Natives</HI> of Heaven grudge not to Guard Those who are only <HI>Free Denizens</HI> thereof. Excellent was the saying of one of the Ancients: We see the whole Heaven at Work for our Salvation; God the Father send∣ing His Son, to Redeem us; the Father and

and wonderfully to deliver his Servant. The means of which Deliverance, is noted in this Text and Context.</P>
<P N="1">1. Prayer unto God, was a means thereof: <HI>Da∣vid</HI> himself did Pray. At that time, he could not make any Prayer more than Ejaculatory, such as <HI>Jehoshaphat</HI> in great Distress did; he listed up his He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, and the Cries of his Soul came before God.

Davids</HI> Godly Friends, Looked up to Hea∣ven on his behalf, and God was pleased to answer them, to their great lightning and consolation.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another means of his Deliverance, is men∣tioned in the words before us, which are expres∣sive of the benefit <HI>David</HI> received by the Ministry of Holy Angels: God Commands his Angels to Encamp round about his Servants, and to Deliver them. A man that hath Enemies, if there be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Army round him, may, notwithstanding his Dangers be Delivered. Thus it was with <HI>David:</HI> and thus 'tis with all that truly fear God: There is an Host, an Army about them. One Angel is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble to defend many against their Enemies: yet such is the Care of God concerning, and such his

Love towards his Children, as that he appoints many Angels, on Occasion, no less than an Host, enough to make a Camp, to Save one Servant of his.</P>
<P>There are then two <HI>Doctrines</HI> before us.</P>

<P><PB N="5" REF="000756_0021_0FAA4920246DD9F8"/>There are several things contained in this <HI>Proposition.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the Angels are Real Beings.</HI> I say, There are such Beings as <HI>Angels.</HI> They are not meer <HI>Entia rationis,</HI> Imagina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Beings, or <HI>Appari∣tions</HI> only, but true and real Beings. That O∣pinion was the Error of the <HI>Sadduces,</HI> they did not believe any such Real Beings, <HI>Acts</HI> 23.8.

One may wonder, that the <HI>Sadduces</HI> should deny the Being of <HI>Angels,</HI> considering they did receive the Books of <HI>Moses,</HI> in which there is frequent mention made of <HI>Angels of God.</HI> But t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erefore some have Observed, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Opini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n was, that the Angels are not Real Beings, but only <HI>Apparitions,</HI> and Impressions made on the minds of men: whenas the Scripture declares them to be Real Spiritual Substances, that have a Personal Subsistence.

They are represented in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Scripture, as beholding and admiring the Wisdom of God. <HI>Ephes.</HI> 3.10. <HI>The manifold Wisdom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>is made known to the Prin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cipalities and Powers in Heavenly Places.</HI> They are represented in the Scripture, as Discoursing with one another. <HI>Zech.</HI> 2.3, 4. an Angel did appear, and said to another Angel concerning the Prophet <HI>Go and make this Young man understand the Vision</HI>▪ And they are represented in the Scripture, as ex∣citing one another to Glorify God.

the Great Day.</HI> These things then make it clear unto us who believe the Scriptures, that there are such real Beings as Angels. And indeed, reason doth dictate no less unto men; for it is evident, that there are Evil Angels: Men cannot but per∣ceive that. And it was manifest from the Ora∣cles of the Gentiles of old; the Evil Angels did speak in them. This also is sadly evident from Bodily Possessions, of which every Age gives instances to the World. Now then, if there are Evil Angels, reason saith, they were once good: they are not originally Evil. The Creator, who is Perfect, Infinite, Goodness, did not make them Evil: they must needs come Holy out of His Hands. And if the Evil Angels were once good, we may rationally conclude, that there are some who are as originally they were Holy Spirits. Hence the Gentiles, who had not the Light of Scripture to inform them; nevertheless believed, that there were good, as well as evil Spirits. They have said of God, that He is [<HI>PATER AN∣DRONTE THEONTE</HI>] the Father of Spirits, as well as the Father of Men.</P>
<P N="2">2. These <HI>Angels are Second Beings,</HI> Created Be∣ings; they receive whatever they are, their very Being, and all from another. Some of the Hea∣then Philosophers, supposed the Angels to be <HI>Co-eternal</HI> with the Great God. But it is not so, nor is that possible to be true: There can be but one First, but one Eternal Being. It is the Prerogative of the Great God, and of him alone,
<PB N="8" REF="000756_0024_0FAA4924521B0A50"/>
to be from all Eternity, Hab. 1.12. <HI>Thou art from Everlasting</HI>: that is more than can be said of a∣ny Ang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l in Heaven. It can't be said of them nor of any amongst them, that they are from E∣ternity: Six Thousand Years ago, there was not one Angel. The Angels are as much beholden to God for their Beings, as the poorest Worm on the earth: He did Create them, or else they would never have been: God made them all out of nothing. <HI>By him all things were Created i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heaven and Earth, things visible, and invisible,</HI> Col. 1 16. The Angels are Invisible Things: but the things belonging to the Invisible World, were as truly Created by God, as any of those things in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Visible World, which our Eyes behold con∣tinually. It is true, the Scripture does not so expresly declare, on what day of the Week the Angels were made, as it does concerning the se∣veral sorts of Creatures in this lower World. Nevertheless, it is certain, that it was on one of those six dayes, in which the World was Created. <HI>God made Heaven and Earth, and Sea, and all that in them is, in the space of six days,</HI> Exod 20.11. If all the things which are in Heaven, were made in the space of six days, then the Angels were so. The Scripture giveth us to un∣derstand, that before the Seventh Day, the <HI>Hea∣vens and all the Hosts</HI> thereof, were Created, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.1, 2. Now the Angels are the Hosts of Heaven. As for this Heaven, that our Eyes look upon, the Stars are the Hosts thereof▪ but as for the Third
<PB N="9" REF="000756_0025_0FAA4925AAB50F48"/>
Heaven, which is to men on Earth Invisible, there is an Host belonging to that Heaven; and the Holy Angels are the Hosts thereof: They are called the Hosts of Heaven, <HI>Neh.</HI> 9.6. <HI>Thou hast made the Heaven of Heavens with all their H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, and the Host of Heaven Worshippeth thee.</HI> The Blessed Angels are that Host of Heaven, which does Worship God: And it is also clear from the Scriptures, that the Angels were Created before this Earth, that we now Live upon: and therefore before the Third Day of the Week; for the Earth was made the Third Day. And then <HI>the Sons of God Shouted for Joy, and the Mor∣ning Stars Sang together.</HI> Job 38.7. In the <HI>Septua∣gint</HI> it is [<HI>PANTES ANGELOI,] All the Angels,</HI> they were <HI>the Sons of God,</HI> that shouted for joy, when the Earth was made. It is most probable, the Angels were Created in the same day, that the Light was, <HI>viz.</HI> in the first day of the Week; Then was the Light Created, and probably the Angels of Light also. The Scripture calls them the <HI>Morning Stars.</HI> They are Stars, in respect of brightness and glory, and Morning Stars, as being brought forth in the very beginning of the Crea∣tion. So then we see, that Angels are Creatures or Second Beings.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They are of all Creatures, the most Excellent and Glorious.</HI> Man is the most Excellent Creature in this lower World: but he is Inferiour to the Angels, and was so in his first and best Estate <HI>Psal.</HI> 8.5. <HI>He was made lower than the Angels.</HI>

Therefore the Scripture doth say of the Angels, that they are the highest Creatures. Eccles. 5.8▪ <HI>Solomon</HI> saith concerning the great Tyrants, that oppress the Earth, <HI>There be Higher than they, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> He that is Higher than the Highest, will regard it▪</HI> God will take notice of it, and He is higher tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Angels, who are the highest of Created Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ings. They are more like unto God, than an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Creatures are, and are therefore sometimes called <HI>Elohim,</HI> i. e. <HI>Gods,</HI> in the Scripture. <HI>Psal.</HI> 97.7. <HI>Worship Him, all ye Gods,</HI> that is, all ye <HI>Angels,</HI> fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so does the Apostle interpret those words of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Psalmist, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.6.

therefore it is, that they are Invisible: Angels cannot be seen, though they stand by men: This Assembly is full of them at this hour, yet we see them not; neither can they be felt or discerned, but by their effects and operations. By this argu∣ment Christ convinced his Disciples, that he was not a Spirit, but a real Body. When Christ ap∣peared to them after his Resurrection, they were troubled, and thought he had been a Spirit▪ Christ said to them, <HI>Behold, my hands and my feet, handle me, see that it is I: a Spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me have.</HI> Luk. 24.39. You can't handle a Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, therefore come and handle me: You may see and feel, that I have a real Body, and that therefore I am not a Spirit, as you fear: And from hence it is, that Angels can come into Houses, when the doors are shut; though there are Bars of Iron upon them, they can pass through them, because they are Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itual Beings. It is true, the Angels themselves compared with God, are not Spiritual. Hence some of the Ancients were wont to say, that every Creature is <HI>Corpore∣al,</HI> that is, comparatively, or in respect of God. Nevertheless, if Angels be compared with other Creatures, they are Spiritual and Incorporeal: Whether they have not <HI>Vehicles</HI> of a more Spiri∣tual Nature, than the Bodies of other Creatures, is a Philosophical Question, not proper to be here Discussed: But in the Scripture they are called Spirits, in distinction and opposition to Bodies.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="12" REF="000756_0028_0FAA4927C0BE3368"/>2. <HI>They are Immortal,</HI> and in that respect resem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble the Glorious God. The Lord is styled, the Everlasting God, and the Immortal King: and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is said of him, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.16. that <HI>He only hath Im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mortality:</HI> He only hath it originally; He only hath Immortality of himself; but Angels have Immortality by the Gift of God. Although <HI>Eter∣nity</HI> cannot be affirmed of the Angels; neverthe∣less, <HI>Eviternity,</HI> or <HI>Immortality</HI> may be affirmed o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them. Though they had a Beginning, once they were not,, they shall never cease to be: what they are now, they shall be for ever. An Ange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cannot dye. It is said, that after the Resurrecti∣on, the Children of God shall be [<HI>ISANGELOI,] Equal unto,</HI> or like <HI>the Angels, neither can they Dye.</HI> Luk. 20.36. They will be made like the Angels, in respect of Immortality, or an impossibility of Dying. An Angel is a Creature that can never Dye. Indeed, God that made them, can annihi∣late them at his pleasure; but they are not Sub∣jects capable of Death or Dissolution: as not being out of <HI>Pre existent Principles.</HI> Nor does Nature decay in them, as in Mortal Creatures. Altho' they have Lived now for the space of more than Five Thousand Years, they are not subject to any decay of Nature, but are as strong and vigorous, as in the day they were made.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Angels Resemble God in respect of Wisdom and Knowledge.</HI> The Lord is a God of Knowledge: He is styled, <HI>The only wise God.</HI> In that respect, Angels are most like to him; they have a won∣derful
<PB N="13" REF="000756_0029_0FAA492864F05C20"/>
measure of Wisdom and Knowledge. <HI>Da∣vids</HI> extraordinary Wisdom, is expressed, by say∣ing, <HI>That he was wise, according to the wisdom of an Angel of God, to know all the things on the Earth.</HI> 2 Sam. 14.20. An Angel of God knows all the things on the Earth; such Wisdom have they. The most knowing man in all the World, knows little or nothing comparatively to what an Angel knows. It is said, co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erning the time of the Day of Judgment, <HI>Of that Hour knows no man, no, not the Angels in Heaven,</HI> Math. 24.36. intimating, that the Angels of Heaven, have a far greater know∣ledge, than men have. <HI>Adam,</HI> before sin darkned his understanding, had a greater measure of know∣ledge, than any man in the World since hath had; but his knowledge was short of the Angels. Hence, the Devil tempted our first Parents with that, If you eat the forbidden fruit, you shall be like unto <HI>Elohim,</HI> like <HI>Gods, h. e.</HI> like Angels, say the Jewish Interpreters on those words, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.5. The Angels are great <HI>Philosophers</HI>: they know the Principles, the Causes, the Nature, and Pro∣perties of every Creature in the World. They are great <HI>Statists</HI>: they know all the affairs of State in this World. In <HI>Dan.</HI> 10.13. The An∣gel said, <HI>I remained with the King in Persia</HI>: that Angel knew all the State affairs, of all the King∣doms of the whole World. They have a Won∣derful <HI>Natural Knowledge</HI> and Wisdom in them, and their knowledge is increased very much by Experience. They have had above five thousand
<PB N="14" REF="000756_0030_0FAA49292776EF90"/>
years experience, which hath added to their know∣ledge. And they have a greater measure of <HI>Re∣vealed Knowledge,</HI> than men may pretend unto. They know the Scriptures, better than any man in the World. They have a deeper insight in∣to Scripture Mysteries. Hence the <HI>Angel</HI> said to <HI>Daniel,</HI> Chap. 10.21. <HI>I am come to shew thee, that which is noted in the Scriptures of truth.</HI> They know what things are in the Scripture, and can give the sence and meaning of them. They are more knowing in the Counsels of God, more pri∣vy to the Counsels of Heaven, than any men on the earth are. And they know what will befal some men and women many years before the things come to pass, yea, before such Persons are born, <HI>Dan.</HI> 11.6. Hence they are compared to liv∣ing Creatures <HI>full of eyes behind and before,</HI> Rev. 4.6. Because they are full of Knowledge and Wis∣dom. They are said to have <HI>eyes behind,</HI> because they know what is past. No such Historians in the World, as the Angels are: they can give an account of all that has happened in the World, for these five thousand years· They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve <HI>eyes before,</HI> inasmuch as they can see forward a great way. As for future things, they have a wonder∣ful sight into them: and as for futurities, which they don't know certainly, they can give such Conjectures, as men cannot reach unto. And God reveals more to them, then He does to men: and has oftentimes revealed future things to men, by the Ministry of His Angels: so that in respect
<PB N="15" REF="000756_0031_0FAA492A32ECDD80"/>

<P>Lastly, <HI>They are like to God in respect of Holiness.</HI> The Image of God is in Holiness especially. <HI>Exod.</HI> 15.11. <HI>He is Glorious in Holiness.</HI> God is Infinite Holiness. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2.2. <HI>There is none Holy as the Lord.</HI> Hence the more holiness is in any, the more like to God are they: this is true concerning the blessed Angels, they are the most holy Creatures in all the World: They are styled in the Scrip∣ture, <HI>the Holy Ones,</HI> Dan. 4.17. and <HI>Holy Angels.</HI> When Christ comes to Judgement, <HI>all the Holy Angels</HI> shall come down from Heaven with Him. <HI>Math.</HI> 25.31. Therefore are they in the Scripture said to be, <HI>Angels of Light,</HI> 2 Cor. 11.14. Because of the light of Holiness, in which they were Cre∣ated: and in that light and life doe they still a∣bide. The Elect Angels never did sin against God. Hence, when they have appeared unto men, usually they did seem to have bright Apparel, and Garments as white as Snow, and like unto the light as an Emblem of their Innocency, Purity, and Holiness. <HI>Dan</HI> 10.5. <HI>Math.</HI> 28.4. <HI>Act.</HI> 10.30.

<HEAD>PROPOSITION. II. That there is an Order among the Angels of Heaven.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="16" REF="000756_0032_0FAA492AA33D35B0"/>This is implyed in the Text before us, which compares the Angels unto an <HI>Army</HI>: that shews there is an Order among them. Though for men to take upon them to declare the particulars of that Order; or to shew by what Laws the Invisible World is Governed, is presumption, and sinful Curiosity; such are condemned by the A∣postle, <HI>as intruding into those things, which they have not seen.</HI> There is a Book, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich passeth under the counterfeit name of <HI>Dionysius</HI> the <HI>Areopagite</HI>▪ wherein the Author ventures to describe the <HI>Cae∣lestial Hierarchy,</HI> as if he had Lived and Con∣versed many years among them; pretending that there are nine distinct Orders amongst the Angels of Heaven. He has taken his Notions partly from the Jews, and partly from the <HI>Pythagore∣an</HI> and <HI>Platonick</HI> Philosophers. But we may not assert any thing in Subjects of this nature, be∣yond what we have Scripture Light for. Now though the Holy Angels may, for ought any thing that the Scripture declares to the contra∣ry, be all Equal in respect of <HI>Nature</HI>; it is certain, that some are in respect of their <HI>Office,</HI> and <HI>Employment</HI> superior to others. There are some, who are as Captains and Leaders, and o∣thers follow them, according as God is pleased to Employ them: It is said in the Text, <HI>The Angel of the Lord Encampeth round about them that fear him.</HI> One Angel cannot make a <HI>Camp,</HI> but many Angels under the Conduct of one, under one as a Leader, may do it, and they do
<PB N="17" REF="000756_0033_0FAA492D71F66F90"/>
doe it. Hence the Angel which came unto the Shepherds, and brought them the Tidings of the Birth of Christ, said, <HI>I bring you glad Tidings,</HI> Luk. 2. and in <HI>v.</HI> 13. it is said, that there was with the Angel, <HI>a Multítude of the Heavenly Host Praising God.</HI> So that there was an Host, a Multitude of Angels, who were under the Conduct of one Angel. That there is a distinction among the Angels, in respect of Office, and that some are Superior to others, is clear from that Scripture, in <HI>Col.</HI> 1.16. where the Apostle speaking concerning the Creatures in the Invisible World, doth distin∣guish them into <HI>Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, and Powers.</HI> Now Thrones are Superiour to Do∣minions; Dominions to Principalities; and Prin∣cipalities to Powers: The words allude to Earth∣ly Governments. In Civil Polities, Kings or Vice-Royes sit upon Thrones, Dukes and Princes, are called Dominions; Governours Commission∣ed by them, and set over particular Provinces, are called Principalities; and Inferiour Magistrates are called Powers: The Abstract is put for the Concrete. So that from these Expressions we may gather, that there is an Order among the Angels of Heaven. Hence also the Scripture speaks expresly, not only concerning Angels, but <HI>Arch-angels</HI>; these are styled in the Scripture, <HI>Ha∣sarim Harishonim, Dan.</HI> 10.13. Not only Princes, but <HI>Chief Princes.</HI> We have the names of one or two of the Arch-angels mentioned in the Scrip∣ture: One of them is named <HI>Michael</HI>; He is the

Christ is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any where called an Arch angel, but plainly di∣stinguished from the Arch angel, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4.16. This <HI>Michael</HI> seems to be the chief of all the Angels, and of all the Arch-angels of God: and therefore He is said to be, not only an Arch-an∣gel, but <HI>the Arch angel</HI>; and is called the <HI>Grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Prince,</HI> as in the Scripture but now quoted in <HI>Daniel.</HI> These Arch angels are supposed to be se∣ven in number: they seem to be signified by the Seven Lamps, that Burned in the Temple before or over against the Mercy-Seat, which wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Throne of God.

<HEAD>Quest. I. <HI>Who are the Object of the Care and Inspection of the Angels of Heaven?</HI></HEAD>
<P>For <HI>Answer,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Church of God is the special Object of the Care and Tutelage of His Holy Angels.</HI> This might be signified to us by those <HI>Cherubims,</HI> that were on the Curtains belonging to the Tabernacle, of which you read, <HI>Exod.</HI> 26.1. And also by the <HI>Che∣rubims,</HI> that were drawn on the Walls of the Tem∣ple, declaring this Mystery to us, that there is a Communion between the Angels in Heaven, and the Church on Earth, and that the Church is
<PB N="28" REF="000756_0044_0FAA493789C7D478"/>
Surrounded with Angels, as the Temple was with Cherubims. The Elect of God are said to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Church of the first-born,</HI> whose names are writ∣ten in Heaven: Now the Scripture is express and clear, that <HI>All</HI> the Angels of Heaven (not one excepted) are made use of to promote the Sal∣vation of the Elect of God: Heb. 1.14. <HI>Are they not all Ministring Spirits, sent forth to Minister for them, who shall be the heirs of Salvation?</HI> And there∣fore particular Churches and Societies of Saints are under a special Inspection of the Angels of God. As the Church of the Jews of old was favoured &amp; honoured with that priviledge, as we see in <HI>Dan.</HI> 12.1. So we have reason to conclude, that Churches consisting of Christians, are under a peculiar In∣spection of Elect Angels. If particular Countries and Provinces, are under their Guardianship, (as there is reason to believe) particular Churches are so much more, as being more eminently under the care of Christ, the Lord of Angels. It is cer∣tain (as the Text before us doth intimate) that in a most peculiar manner, such as truly fear God, receive advantage, by the Ministry of Holy An∣gels: But for their sakes, others are also benefited thereby. Hypocrites, who are only external Wor∣shipers of God, are many wayes benefited by the Ministration of Angels, for the sake of them, who are sincere. Every man in the Church of Israel did receive benefit by the Ministry of the Angels of Heaven: they <HI>All</HI> did eat of the <HI>Manna</HI>; which Manna was prepared by Angels. There∣fore
<PB N="29" REF="000756_0045_0FAA4938C1D68520"/>
it is said, that <HI>Man did eat Angels Food,</HI> Psal. 78.25. Because the Manna was prepared for them by the Angels. So is it now in the days of the Gos∣pel, when God doth provide Spiritual food for men, all that are the Objects thereof, are or may be better for it. Where there are faithful, able Preachers of the Word of God, all have the ad∣vantage of that Light: Now such things are by Christ's appointment brought to pass, by the Se∣cret Invisible Ministry of Angels. When <HI>Peter</HI> was sent to Preach the Gospel to <HI>Cornelius,</HI> and his Family, it was an Angel that did direct him unto them. When <HI>Paul</HI> and other Ministers Preached the Gospel to the <HI>Macedonians,</HI> an Angel of Heaven by Divine Appointment, caused them to do it, <HI>Acts.</HI> 16.9. Paul had a Vision, there stood a man of Macedonia, and Prayed him say∣ing, <HI>Come over into Macedonia, and help us</HI>: h. e. He saw an Angel habited like a Macedonian, who spake those Words to him, whence he and others with him concluded, that they were called to Preach the Gospel in Macedonia, and that God and his Angels would be with them there. Towns and Cities in which there are Churches of Saints Worshipping God in Christ, have no doubt their peculiar Angels to watch over them. When Je∣rusalem was besieged by the Assyrians, it is said the Angel of the Lord <HI>went out</HI> and smote the Camp of the Assyrians, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 19.35. It seems then, there was an Angel that did reside in and preside over that City, where the Temple was, who upon

<P N="2">2. <HI>The Care and Inspection of Angels, is not Limi∣ted to the Church only.</HI> That in a special manner, is the Object thereof; yet for the Churches sake, their Care and Tutelage doth extend much fur∣ther.

This the Angel did out of respect to the Lord's People▪ For <HI>Darius</HI> himself was an Idolater, and not a Worshipper of God. So <HI>Alexander,</HI> Sirnamed <HI>the Great,</HI> he was far from being a true Feare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of God, but he was kind to the Jews, then the only People of God in the World, and he was wonderfully preserved and prospered by the An∣gels of Heaven. He was delivered in miraculous Dangers: once he was Shot in his Shoulder, and another time sorely Wounded in his Leg, but strangely preserved in the midst of his Enemies, because God did design to humble and break th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Enemies of his People, by the hand of that <HI>Alex∣ander</HI>: Angels delivered him, until such time, as he had done the Work God had appointed for him. God then doth Govern the whole World by the Ministry of His Holy Angels: They are

in <HI>Heaven</HI> as a <HI>Watch-Tower,</HI> and they keep the World. Hence <HI>Daniel</HI> saw a <HI>Watcher,</HI> an Holy One, come down from Heaven. <HI>Dan.</HI> 4.13. The Angels are those <HI>Holy Ones,</HI> that Watch the World: They are the great Intelligencers of Heaven, whom the Lord Christ sends throughout the Earth, to observe, and give him an account, how the Affairs thereof are. We see in the first Chapter of <HI>Zachary,</HI> that the Angels come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Increated An∣gel, and the Lord of all the Angels: they say to him, <HI>We have Walked to and fro thorow the Earth, and behold, all the Earth is at rest.</HI> v. 11. Thus do they inspect the World, and give an account of their Ministry. Hence it is said, that the <HI>Living Creatures,</HI> (Angels I told you are meant by the Living Creatures) <HI>ran and returned, as the appea∣rance of a Flash of Lightning.</HI> Ezek. 1.14. When the Lord sends them on an Errand, <HI>they Run,</HI> and <HI>they Return</HI> again, when they have dispatched the business they were sent upon. And they run as swiftly as a flash of Lightning: they go from Heaven to Earth, and from Earth to Heaven like Lightning. Although they that fear the Lord, are the peculiar Charge of Holy Angels, whom they constantly attend; nevertheless, that the World in general is under their Inspection, is evi∣dent from the Scriptures: For</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>God doth Dispense both signal Mercies and Judg∣ments by their hands.</HI> Ezek. 1.13. The Living Crea∣tures are said to be <HI>as a Lamp, and as Coals of fire.</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="000756_0048_0FAA493A73997900"/>
They are unto such as fear God, as a Lamp, to direct and light them: but they are unto wicked men, as Coals of Fire to consume them. This we see described at large in the 6<HI>th</HI> Chapter of <HI>Zachary,</HI> from the first to the ninth verse; where we read of four Chariots, that is to say, the Angels of God, sent forth into the four Cor∣ners of the World, North, South, East &amp; West: and the Horses that represent the Angels, appear in several Colours: there was <HI>Red Horses,</HI> noting bloody Judgments, Desolations by War, and this by the Ministry of Angels; <HI>Black Horses,</HI> signifying the Pestilence and Famine, and the like Judgments coming upon the World; and <HI>White Horses,</HI> intimating Victory and Mercy to the Peo∣ple of God; and there were <HI>Grisled Horses,</HI> em∣blematically setting forth mixed Dispensations of Divine Providence: and all by the Ministry of Angels: Of these the Lord sayes, <HI>They have qui∣eted my Spirit in the North Country.</HI> The Angels were sent into the North-Country, namely to <HI>Babylon,</HI> to Execute Judgment there; and then the Holy Spirit of God was satisfied, when He saw, that Justice was done by his Angels, on his and his People's Enemies. <HI>David</HI> Prayed that Judgment might be Executed on his Enemies, by the hands of Angels. <HI>Psal.</HI> 35.5, 6. <HI>Let the Angel of the Lord chase them, and let the Angel of the Lord Persecute them.</HI> It is true, that no Judg∣ment befa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the World, but God doth it. <HI>Amos</HI> 3.6. <HI>Shall there be Evil in a City, and the Lord hath</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="000756_0049_0FAA493B38FEBE78"/>
not done it. Nevertheless, the Lord is not wont to Execute Judgment upon men, by His own Im∣mediate Hand, but by the Ministry of Angels: When it is done by men, yet Angels have an hand therein. Sometimes indeed by the Hands of Evil Angels, whom the Lord lets Loose, and punishes a wicked World by them; but many times by the Hands of His Holy Angels. Thus, when <HI>Sodom</HI> was Destroyed, they were the An∣gels of Heaven, that did that terrible and glorious work of Justice, on provoking Sinners. The An∣gels said to <HI>Lot, We will destroy this place, the Lord has sent us to destroy it.</HI> Gen. 19.13. As for the Angel who Killed the First born of <HI>Egypt,</HI> the Jews think He was, <HI>The King of Devils</HI>; whom they call by the name of <HI>Ashmodai,</HI> which signi∣fies a <HI>Destroyer.</HI> The Scripture calls him a <HI>Destroy∣er, Heb.</HI> 11.28. He might notwithstanding that, be a good Angel: For no work is more beco∣ming those Holy Spirits, than to Execute the Judgments of God on Impenitent Sinners. And although it is said concerning the Egyptians, <HI>Psal.</HI> 78.49. That the Lord did cast upon them the fierceness of his Anger, <HI>By sending Evil Angels a∣mong them</HI>: Judicious Expositors conceive, That those Angels are styled, <HI>Evil Angels,</HI> not in respect of their Nature, but in respect of the sad Message they were sent upon, in that they were the Mes∣sengers of Evil Tidings; they were the Messen∣gers of Death to the Egyptians. The Egyptians had made use of wicked Angels to oppose <HI>Moses,</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="000756_0050_0FAA493BE88E8D98"/>
and to withstand the Design of God for the Sal∣vation of His People: and now God to punish them, would make use of the Holy Angels, as the Instruments of His Providence. When Seven∣ty Thousand men among the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> Dyed of the Plague, they were smitten by the Hand of an Angel. <HI>David</HI> saw the <HI>Angel stretch∣ed out his Hand over Jerusalem to destroy it, but the Lord said to the Angel that destroyed, it is enough, stay now thine hand</HI> 2 Sam. 24.16.

God sent his Angels, and they caused that noise to be heard. Thus in <HI>Jehoshaphat's</HI> time, when the <HI>Edomites,</HI> the <HI>Ammonites,</HI> and the <HI>Moa∣bites</HI> did Combine against <HI>Judah,</HI> it is said, 2 <HI>Chr.</HI> 20.22 That the <HI>Lord set Ambushments against them</HI>: and then the other two Nations stood up against the <HI>Ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mites,</HI> and after that they de∣stroyed one another.

time of the <HI>Maccabees, Judas Maccabeus,</HI> with Six Thousand Men, destroyed above Twenty Thou∣sand of the Enemy. The Historian relates, that when the two Armies were set in Battel Array, the Jews General began the Battel with Prayer, <HI>Lord,</HI> (said he) <HI>Thou art the God, who in the time of</HI> Hezekiah, <HI>didst send thy Angel, to destroy the Host of Sennacherib; send, I pray thee, an Angel be∣fore us.</HI> The Lord heard that Prayer: Their chief Enemy was taken Prisoner, and Five and Thirty Thousand were Slain, by a small number of the Jews; their Enemies professing, that they saw two men standing, one at the Right, and the other at the Left hand of <HI>Maccabeus,</HI> (the <HI>Jews</HI> General) who kept off the Arrows, that they could not hurt him.

When <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> the Emperour of the World, was Deposed from his Throne, and his Kingly Glory given to another, it caused a stupendous Change in the Court of <HI>Babylon</HI>: and this was done by the Angels of God; <HI>It was by the Decree of the Watchers, and the Demand, by the Word of the Holy Ones.</HI> Dan. 4.17.

They that Write the

History of those Times, give us to understand that when the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> under the Con∣duct of <HI>Darius</HI> and <HI>Cyrus,</HI> did Besiege <HI>Babylon,</HI> some of the <HI>Babylonian</HI> Deserters directed <HI>Darius</HI> to the Emperours Palace, where they found him, and all his Lords, Drinking, who were all put to the Sword; and the Scripture giveth us to under∣stand, that an Angel by an Hand-writing on the Wall, had intimated to them but a few hours before, that so it should be: Angels also assisted <HI>Darius</HI> in keepi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g the Government of that Empire after he had possession of it. <HI>Dan.</HI> 11.1. <HI>In the first year of Darius the Mede, I</HI> (saith the Angel) <HI>stood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o confirm and strengthen him.</HI> When the Im∣peri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Diadem was above two Hundred Year<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> after, taken from the <HI>Persians,</HI> and given to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Graecians,</HI> it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was an astonishing Revolution, and Effected by the Ministry of Holy Angels. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was a wonderful thing, that <HI>Alexander</HI> with so few should set upon an Emperour, that had so great an Army; his Friends with all importuni∣ty did disswade him from it; and many thought him little better than a mad man, to make such a daring attempt. The Emperour, against whom he came, ordered his Lieutenants, that they should take <HI>Alexander</HI> alive, and that they should Sell his Souldiers for Slaves; yet did he overcome that mighty Emperour. The Scripture tells how this came to pass, Dan. 10.20. <HI>I</HI> (saith the An∣gel) <HI>will Fight with the Prince of</HI> Persia, <HI>and when I am gone forth, lo, the Prince of</HI> Graecia <HI>shall come▪

Lo,</HI> (saith the Angel) here i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a wonderful thing, that the King of <HI>Graecia</HI> with Thirty or Forty Thousand men, should set himself against, and preva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> over the whole power of the Empire of <HI>Persia,</HI> which was able to oppose him with milli∣ons of Armed m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. But the Angels of God did by Divine Appointment, stir up the Spirit of <HI>Alexander</HI> unto mighty Undertakings: and thence in the beginning of the 11<HI>th</HI> Chapter, it is inti∣mated, that it was by the Ministry of Angels, that the Kingdom was taken from the <HI>Babyloni∣ans,</HI> and given to the <HI>Persians</HI>; and that there∣fore <HI>Daniel</HI> might conclude, that when Gods time was come, to give it to the <HI>Graecians,</HI> those An∣gels, that had made the former Revolution, were able to make the latter also. So when the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Empire of Pagan became Christian, it was a wonderful Revolution. For many years, no man might be in any place of Power, if he was a Christian: But God so ordered and altered the Affairs of the World, that <HI>Constantine,</HI> a Christian, and a good man, was made Emperour, and all of a sudden, the World was turned up side-down, and no man was to be in place of Power, except a Christian; <HI>The Dragon found no place in Heaven.</HI> This was the greatest Revolution, that ever hap∣pened in the World; and the Angels of Heaven were instrumental in the accomplishment of it. Rev. 12.7. <HI>Michael and his Angels Fought and pre∣vailed against the Dragon and his Angels.</HI> It was the Angels of Heaven then, that did bring about
<PB N="40" REF="000756_0056_0FAA494374B38808"/>
that happy Revolution. Thus we see, that this Visible, is, by God's Appointment, Governed by the Invisible World.</P>

<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="question">
<HEAD>II. The <HI>Second</HI> thing to be inquired into, is, <HI>What benefit they that fear God, do receive by the Mi∣nistry of Holy Angels?</HI></HEAD>
<P>For Answer,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They are by them preserved from many Evils, that otherwise would befal them.</HI> They doe as a guard, stand between them and many dangers, that are ready to overtake them. The Angels of Heaven are as Nurses to the Children of God. Psal. 91.11, 12. <HI>He shall give his Angels charge over thee, and they shall bear thee in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a Stone.</HI> As a Nurse holds the Child she hath the care and charge of, in her armes: so they that fear the Lord, are kept from many a fall, preserved from many a hurt and blow, that would light upon them, did not Angels look after them. Hence the fearers of God have spe∣cial Protections in Journies, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> according to his will. Thus, when <HI>Jacob</HI> was to go that great Journey from his Fathers house, in the Land of Canaan, to his Uncle in Padan Aram, he saw <HI>Angels of God Ascending and Descending,</HI> Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 28.12. To intimate, that the Lord would send his Angels, both to go with him, and to return with him again: And when Jacob was returning to the Land of Canaan, <HI>the Angels of God met him on his way:</HI> There were two hosts of them, <HI>Gen.</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="000756_0057_0FAA4944297207F8"/>
32.1, 2. It seems there was one host of Angels, that went with him from <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> to the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and when he came into his own Country, another host mett him to take him under their especial care and guardianship. So when God calls his Servants to go in great and hazardous Voyages at Sea, He giveth his Holy Angels charge concerning them. Of this the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> had experience, <HI>Act.</HI> 27.23, 24. When there was a Storm, and the Vess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l at last cast away, <HI>the Angel of God stood by him, and said to him, fear not, for God hath given to thee, all them that Sail with thee.</HI> There were Angels of God with him at Sea, that did incamp round about him there, and for his sake, about all that were in the same Vessel wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h him. They that fear God, are alwayes exposed unto danger, from the Invisible World especially. The Devil is alwayes watching an Opportunity to do them one mischief or other. <HI>Your Adversary the Devil</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>goes about, like a roar∣ing Lyon, seeking, whom he may devour.</HI> Therefore the Angels of Heaven are alwayes about them, to protect and preserve them, from those mischiefs, that their Spiritual and Invisible enemies are de∣signing against them. The Devils are powerful enemies: but the good Angels are more powerful than they; <HI>Michael</HI> and his Angels, are more pow∣erful, than <HI>Satan</HI> and all his Angels▪ And when Instruments of Satan, that is to say, wicked men, do intend and attempt evil against those that fear God, Holy Angels oftentimes disappoint them, &amp;

so deliver the Lords Servants from many a Snare <HI>Balaam</HI> had a mischievous design against the Chil∣dren of <HI>Israel,</HI> but an Angel met him, and disap∣pointed him: The Angel of the Lord stood in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> way for an adversary against him, and said, <HI>I we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse be∣fore me,</HI> Numb. 22.32. And when the King of <HI>Syria</HI> s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt an Army to surround <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>othan,</HI> and to ap∣prehend the Prophet, <HI>Elisha,</HI> an Army of Angel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prevented th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, &amp; d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>livered the Prophet, 2 <HI>King.</HI> 6.17. And when God will have it to be so, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Holy Angels cut off those that seek the hurt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them that fear Him. They kill those wicked men who, if they were suffered to live any longer would do hurt unto the Fearers of the Lord. Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Souldiers in <HI>Sennacheribs</HI> Army, lived a whil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> longer, they would have fallen upon Jerusalem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Therefore did Angels kill an hundred and four∣score and five thousand of them in one night <HI>Herod</HI> began to Persecute the Church: had he lived longer, he would have gone on with hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Persecution. Therefore an Angel was sent from Heaven to kill him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Angels do not only deliver from Evil; but positive Blessings and Benefits are conveyed by their Hands.</HI> To instance in two or three particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They assist God's Servan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s) in their Undertaking<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which are according to His Will.</HI> They make them successful in lawful Undertakings, especially in great Undertakings. Sometimes they that do not fear God, have Angelical Aides and Assistan∣ces,
<PB N="43" REF="000756_0059_0FAA4946B716FB48"/>
for the sake of such as do fear him. It was before noted, that the Angel said of <HI>Darius, I stood to confirm and strengthen him</HI>: and yet we cannot say, that <HI>Darius</HI> was a true Fearer of the Lord. But much more do they assist them, that do indeed fear him, when they are called to any singular Service for his Name. It was from this consideration, that <HI>Abraham</HI> did encourage his Servant to go on that great Concern, which he was sent to manage, for his Masters Family: <HI>The Lord</HI> (said he) <HI>before whom I walk, will send His Angel with thee, and prosper thy way,</HI> Gen. 24.40. His way was made prosperous; he did obtain that which he was sent about, because God sent Angels with him, who caused his faithful Endea∣vours to prove successful.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Holy Angels do perform the Office of Tutors unto God's Children.</HI> Hence they are sometimes instructed in glorious Truths, by their Ministry, which otherwise they would not have been ac∣quainted with. An Angel <HI>Informed Daniel,</HI> and said, <HI>I am come to give thee skill and understanding.</HI> Dan. 9.22. The Angel that talked with the Pro∣phet <HI>Zachary,</HI> said unto him, <HI>I will shew unto thee, what these be. Zach.</HI> 1.9. The <HI>Revelation</HI> was gi∣ven to <HI>John</HI> by an Angel.

Angels <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and informed the Shepherds concerning the Birth of Christ: Angels informed the Disciples, of the
<PB N="44" REF="000756_0060_0FAA494720EB0080"/>
Resurrection of Christ, and after what manner he will come again to Judge the World, at the last Day. And we find in the Scriptures, that the Fearers of the Lord have been excited unto and directed in, that which hath been their duty, by the Angels of Heaven. Thus <HI>Manoah</HI> and his Wife, were directed by an Angel, after what manner they should Educate their Son. Thus when <HI>Elijah</HI> was in a strait, whether to shew himself to the King or no, <HI>An Angel of the Lord said to him, go and be not afraid, and he arose, and went to the King.</HI> 2 King. 1.15. Thus again, an Angel spoke to the Apostles, and bid them go, and Preach the Word of Life in the Temple. <HI>Act</HI> 5.19. It was an Angel that directed <HI>Philip,</HI> to go to the place, where he met with a Great man, whom he instructed in the Principles of Religion: and by means of that man, was a whole Kingdom Enlightned in the Knowledge of Christ. The Angels, like faithful Tutors, and Monitors, do sometimes correct and discipline the Children of God, when they have offended. When <HI>Hagar</HI> Ran-away from her Mistress, that dealt hardly with her, an Angel of the Lord said to her, <HI>Re∣turn to thy Mistress, and submit thy self unto her Hands.</HI> Gen. 16.9.

Angels of Heaven, to correct them for some Sin they have been guilty of.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Holy Angels have a great influence, upon the thoughts, minds, and Spirits of men.</HI> Evil Angels inject evil thoughts into the mind. The Devil put it into the heart of <HI>Judas,</HI> that he should go, and betray his Master, <HI>Joh.</HI> 13.1. Evil Angels stir up those Corruptions, that are in the hearts of men. They have a powerful influence and ope∣ration on the Spirits of the Children of disobedi∣ence, in whom they work effectually. Hence the Prophet <HI>Micaiah</HI> saw the Lord on his throne, and the host of Heaven round about him, and heard him saying, Who shall deceive <HI>Ahab,</HI> that he may go up to Ramoth Gilead, and fall there: and one said on this manner, and another on that manner: and <HI>there came forth an Evil Spirit,</HI> and said, I will goe, and be a lying Spirit in the mouth of all his Prophets: and the Lord said, <HI>Thou shalt perswade him, and prevail also,</HI> 1 Kin. 22.22. By which it appears, that evil Angels have a great influence on the Spirits of wicked men. So have the Holy Angels a great influence on the Spirits of them that fear the Lord, exciting them unto the things that are good. They have the benefit of Angeli∣cal Suggestion, in many good motions, more than themselves are aware of. It is true, that all Holy thoughts are originally from the Spirit of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Nevertheless, He is pleased oftentimes to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Ministry of Angels therein.

<PB N="46" REF="000756_0062_0FAA494A0E1B86C8"/>
Souls of Believers, as the Holy and Eternal Spirit doth: nor have they power to make their Sug∣gestions effectual: they can't give Life &amp; Grace with the good motions Suggested by them, as the Spirit of God doth. Ministers in Preaching may propose Arguments to men, and can do no more. The Eternal Spirit only can make those Arguments to prevail. That which Ministers do externally and visibly, the Holy Angels do after a Spiritual and invisible manner. Sometimes wicked men have strange Impulses from evil Angels, whence i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t they are hurried on, to the perpetration o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most abominable and enormous crimes. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> do they become guilty of Blasphemies, Adulteries▪ Murders, and sometimes of Self-Murder. So ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are sometimes very unaccountable Motions and Impressions on the Spirits of good men, which are wrought in them, by the Ministry of Holy Angels whose work it is, to prevent and disappoint the designs of Satan &amp; of his evil Angels. I remem∣ber one relates a remarkable passage of a good man, that, when he was reading in his house, he could not rest in his Spirit, but he must step out of doors: which he had no sooner done, but he saw a Child in a pond of Water, ready to perish which would have been gone past recovery, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gone out of his doors, just at that moment. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Impression must needs be from a good Angel. And an other like passage is related in the Life o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Holy man, Mr. <HI>Dod:</HI> One evening (thoug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he had other work to attend) he could not bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

he must go to such a Neighbours house: when he came to him, he told him, he knew not what he was come for; but he could not rest in his Spirit, until he had visited him. The poor man was astonished: for he had in the Violence of a Temptation, put a Rope into his Pocket, with an intent to have destroyed himself, had not Mr. <HI>Dod's</HI> thus coming prevented it. Surely an Angel of the Lord was in this Providence. Bishop <HI>Hall</HI> speaks of one whom he knew, that having been for Six∣teen years a Cripple, had these monitions in his Sleep, that he should go and wash in St. <HI>Matherus</HI> Well in <HI>Cornwell,</HI> which he did, and was suddenly recovered. This he thinks was from Angelical Suggestion. <HI>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus</HI> did in a Dream, receive the prescript of a remedy for his disease, which the Physitians could not cure. A Physitian of <HI>Uratislavium</HI> followed the Counsil he had given him in a Dream, concerning the cure of a disease which was to him incurable, and he recovered his patient. It added to the wonder, that a few years after, he met with that Receipt in a Book then newly Printed. Histories report that the like to this hapned to <HI>Philip,</HI> and to <HI>Galen.</HI> If Angels may Suggest things beneficial unto the minds of men who are Strangers to God, much more unto them that fear him!</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="reasons">
<P>We proceed to inquire into the <HI>Reasons, Why the Ministry of Holy Angels is made use of?</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="48" REF="000756_0064_0FAA494AE522C278"/>1. The <HI>first</HI> and great <HI>Reason</HI> of it is, because <HI>it is the Sovereign will and pleasure of God, to have i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so, with respect unto his own Glory.</HI> Gods Will is <HI>the Reason of all Reasons.</HI> We have shewed, that He doth not make use of Angels, as though he stood in any need of them, or of their Services. That God, who made the World, without their help, can preserve the World and His People therein, without any of them, if He so pleased: But He doth use them, for the same Reason, for which He did Create them, namely his own pleasure. Rev. 4.11. <HI>Thou hast Created all things, and for thy plea∣sure they are, and were Created. All things,</HI> and therefore all the Angels in Heaven, wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Created for the Pleasure of the Great God. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are they, all of them, for the same reason, mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> use of, as Ministring Spirits: and it pleases God to have it so out of respect to his own Glory. That which is the best End, must needs be God's End, in all His Works of Creation and Provi∣dence. Now the Glory of His own Name, is the best end. God, who alone is infinitely wise knows, what doth best become his own Greatne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and Goodness. And if the Lord did not see that it would be most for His Glory, that thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should be managed by the Hands of His Holy Angels, rather than by His own Immediate Hand on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y; it would not be as it is. The Lord is able to Convert men without sending Ministers t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Preach to them: To heal the Sick without Phi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sicians; to preserve Humane Societies withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="49" REF="000756_0065_0FAA494BC6E17598"/>
Magistrates, to defend his People from Ene∣mies, without the use of Arms; but it is His Will and Pleasure, that secondary Causes should be made use of. The like is to be said of An∣gelical Protection: God is the Fountain of all our Mercies and Preservations. Angels and Ordinances are but Cesterns, which it is His Pleasure to make use of.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another <HI>Reason</HI> is, <HI>That so the Obedience of the Angels may be tried, exercised and rewarded.</HI> By this the Obedience of Angels, and their humility is tried, whether they will readily stoop unto, and comply with the Command of God. It is a great Tryal of their Obedience, that they should be set as a Guard to such poor, sorry Creatures, as the Children of men are. <HI>What is man,</HI> (says the Psalmist) <HI>thou hast made him lower than the Angels,</HI> Psal. 8.4, 5. In as much therefore as they Minister to him, their subjection to the Will of God is put upon the Trial. It is generally sup∣posed, that the Sin of Reprobate Angels, was their refusing to comply with the Command of God in this matter: that they did think scorn of it, to be made Attendants, on such a Creature as man, so much inferiour to them. But the Elect Angels think no Service too mean, that the glori∣ous God shall see meet to imploy them in: and they do by this become Patterns of Obedience unto us. If the Angels that are so much above us, do most willingly and gladly comply with the
<PB N="50" REF="000756_0066_0FAA49522F09C368"/>
Will of God in whatever He shall appoint them unto, men ought to do so. If Angels do not think much to look after them that fear God▪ then it doth become the Greatest man in all the World, to be willing to serve or promote the Welfare of the meanest Saint, that is upon the Earth: Angels set a pattern of Obedience in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> respect; and thus their Obedience is exercised▪ even from the beginning, to the end of the World: for they continue their Ministration from the beginning to the end of the World: and when they have accomplished the course of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Obedience, they shall have their Reward: the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (as a Great Divine of our own, does well an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> truly express it) <HI>They shall be Rewarded with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> contemplation of the Infinite Excellencies of God,</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Enjoyment of him, throughout Eternal Ages which is the greatest happiness, that any Creature is capable of. And in the mean time, it is no small honour to the Angels of Heaven, that the should be used in such a Service; that they shoul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> joyn with the most High God, in that which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of all his Works the most glorious, namely, the Preservation and Salvation of his Elect.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another <HI>Reason,</HI> why <HI>the Ministry of Hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Angels is made use of,</HI> is, <HI>That so the Devils may b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kept in awe, and in a perpetual vexation and tormen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>▪ For, certain it is, that the Angels of Heaven, have a great awe upon the evil Angels to restrain thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Power, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> disappoint them in their maliciou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Designs; which they are able to do by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="51" REF="000756_0067_0FAA4952694B9C08"/>
speaking of a word. You see in the ninth verse of <HI>Judes</HI> Epistle, that when the Devil was con∣tending about the Body of <HI>Moses,</HI> the Arch An∣gel did but speak a word; He did but say, <HI>The Lord rebuke thee, Satan,</HI> and all the Devils Design was at an end presently. The Evil Angels know the power of the Holy Angels: they know, that they are able to withstand them: And they do not know, but that they may meet with them at every turn, and disappoint all that they have been contriving, which must needs be a perpe∣tual vexation to those Evil Spirits: It is a torment to the Devil to see and behold an Host of Angels Encamping round about all them that fear God; so that the Devil is not able to destroy one of them all, because there are Holy Angels Encamp∣ing round about them. And it is a torment and vexation to the Devil, to see the Holy Angels gloriously and triumphingly imployed in Service for the Great God, and rewarded by him; whilst they in the mean time are made to Eat the Dust, being rejected and abdicated to the vilest Services, that any part in the whole Creati∣on are exercised in. It cannot but cut the Devil to the heart, to see those very Angels, that are of the same nature with him, and with whom he was once a Companion in Heaven, thus tri∣umphingly Serving God. And what a torment∣ing reproach must it needs be, when at the same time he shall hear it said to him, this might have been thy Employment, and should have been
<PB N="52" REF="000756_0068_0FAA49532683E4D0"/>
so, if thou hadst not by sinning against the Great God, brought eternal damnation upon thy self.</P>
<P N="4">4. A fourth <HI>Reason,</HI> Why <HI>the ministry of Holy An∣geli is made use of,</HI> is, <HI>That so Communion and Love may be maintained and increased among those that are Members of the Glorious Family of God.</HI> Some part of God's Family is here upon Earth; they that fear him are here: But then another part of the Family belongs to Heaven, namely, the Blessed Angels. <HI>I Bow my Knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole Family in Heaven and Earth is named.</HI> Eph. 3.15. They that Fear God are the Family on Earth: the Angels of the Lord are of the Family in Heaven: it is meet that there should be a Communion between those that are of the same Family. We cannot any way be helpful to the Angels, nor do they need our help in any thing: all our help, it is limited unto <HI>the Saints on the Earth, Psal.</HI> 16.3. <HI>My Good∣ness</HI> (saith <HI>David) extendeth not to thee, but unto the Saints, the Excellent in the Earth, in whom is all my delight.</HI> We cannot be beneficial to the Saints in Heaven, or to the Angels there: But the An∣gels can help us, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> need their help. In that way therefore must the Communion, which becomes the Members of this Glorious Family, be maintained. And therefore the Love of An∣gels unto the Children of God, is confirmed and increased: Love is increased by kind offices: we see, that Nurses have a special affection, to the Children that have been fostred by them. So
<PB N="53" REF="000756_0069_0FAA4953F36FA9E0"/>
have the Angels of God unto His Children, that have been under their Care and Education; those Heirs of Salvation, whom from their Cra∣dle unto their Graves, they have been fostring and taking care of, they must needs have a great affection for. Holy Angels, and all such as truly fear God, shall live together in the same Heaven, World without End. It is meet then, that there should be a great Love and Friendship between them: This Ministry of theirs must needs cause it to be so. Thus have we seen the <HI>Doctrine</HI> Ex∣plained and Confirmed.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="objections">
<P>Before we proceed to <HI>Application,</HI> it may be needful to remove an <HI>Objection</HI> or two.</P>
<P N="1">1. It may be Objected, <HI>That they that Fear God, are subject unto the like Casualties with other men</HI>; as much subjected to Dangers and Afflicti∣ons, yea, and sometimes more, then they that do not fear him. Doth not the Scripture say, <HI>That all things happen alike to all; there is one Event to the Righteous and the Wicked, to him that Sweareth, and to him that feareth an Oath?</HI> How then can it be said, that the Angel of the Lord delivereth them that fear him, when they fall into Evils no less than such as do not fear him? Take the An∣swer in these following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Ministry of Angels is limited by the Holy Pleasure of God.</HI> Psal. 103.21. <HI>The Angels that do His Pleasure.</HI> And therefore so far as it is the Pleasure of God, to have them to secure, or to deliver his Children from outward Evils, they
<PB N="54" REF="000756_0070_0FAA4954A813E728"/>
are not wanting to do it. But sometimes it is God's Holy Pleasure to have it otherwise, they must be suffered to fall into great Temptations, for their good, and that God may have Glory thereby. Yea, not only such as truly fear God, but such as fear him above many, that are Emi∣nent Servants and Fearers of the Lord, very sad Temptations and Afflictions in the World▪ may befal them. God sees it meet to have it so. We see this in the Instance of <HI>Job,</HI> who wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Eminent for the Fear of God: There was none like him in the Earth, that did Fear God, and Eschew Evil, so much as he: And for a long time the Angels delivered him; they kept of the malice of Satan, from taking any effect up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on him. Thence the Devil complained, Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>there was an Hedge round about. Job.</HI> The <HI>Hedge</HI> of Divine Protection by the Ministry of Holy Angels, the Devil could not break thorow, not get over: He did therefore get leave of God to fall upon <HI>Job</HI>; and the Angels were by, when the Devil had that liberty granted to him: those Sons of God were by, and did hear the Devil begging and obtaining leave to fall upon <HI>Job</HI>: Then they might not oppose. Then Evils came upon him from day to day; not but that the Angels could have diverted those Evils, and deli∣vered <HI>Job</HI> from them all, if so had been the Pleasure of God; but they knew that God had appointed otherwise. So when any outward Cala∣mity befals a Child of God in the World, the reason
<PB N="55" REF="000756_0071_0FAA495566407330"/>
of it is not, that the Angels of the Lord are not able to prevent the Calamity, or that they are a∣ny way invigilant or negligent in that which is their Charge; they always do what God com∣mands them, as in the Psalm but now, <HI>Ye his An∣gels that do His Commandments.</HI> They know, what the Pleasure of God is, and act accordingly.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is possible, that such as belong to God, may, (and too often they do) give way to Sin and Temp∣tation, and so deprive themselves of the Protection of God, and His Angels.</HI> By Sinning against God, they provoke him to countermand and suspend the wonted Protection of His Holy Angels. For, their Ministration, and the Charge that they have to keep and guard us, doth run with this express limitation, that we shall keep our selves in the way, that God has bid us keep in <HI>Psal.</HI> 91.11. <HI>He shall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.</HI> But if men go out of their way, then they go from under the Charge of those Holy Angels. When they sin against God, they go out of their way: when they hearken unto the Tempter, he will certainly lead them out of the way: when they sin against God, they Run away out of the Hands of Holy Angels, and do thereby put themselves into the Hands of Evil Angels; they deprive themselves of Divine, and consequently of Angel Protection. We have an awful instance concerning this, in 1 <HI>King.</HI> 13.22, 24. You read there of a man of God, that was sent unto <HI>Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>boam</HI>: and the Lord comman∣ded
<PB N="56" REF="000756_0072_0FAA495862D8AF50"/>
him, that he should neither eat nor drink, till he returned home to his own House again. As he was returning, an old lying Prophet came to him, desiring him to turn in to his house, to eat and drink there. No (saith the man of God) I may not do so: for, God hath charged me, that I should not. The Lying Prophet re∣plied, I am a Prophet as well as thou, and an Angel hath spoken to me, and told me, that thou must come into my house. The poor man of God was deceived, and did so, and the issue was, He never lived to come Home; but a Lion met him by the way, and killed him. This was, be∣cause he went out of God's way, and so from under God's Protection. It is indeed, a blessed truth, that God will not utterly depart from any of his Faithful Servants; he will not utterly for∣sake them; for so his Covenant is, <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.5. <HI>I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.</HI> Nevertheless, he may for a time, and he may in a great mea∣sure forsake them, in case they sin against him: As it was with <HI>Sampson,</HI> though he did not appre∣hend it at the first: <HI>Judg.</HI> 16.20. <HI>He wist not, that the Lord was departed from him. Sampson</HI> had gi∣ven way to Temptation; and now the Lord was departed from him. So it is true concerning the man, that feareth the Lord, the Holy Angels do never utterly depart from him, yet for some time, and in a great measure, they may; that he shall not be so favoured with Angel Protecti∣on, as sometimes he was, when he Walked
<PB N="57" REF="000756_0073_0FAA495A568BAEC8"/>
more closely with God. As the Holy and Eter∣nal Spirit doth never wholly depart from true Believers, Joh. 14.16. <HI>He doth abide with them for ever</HI>: this notwithstanding, he may in a great measure withdraw from them: <HI>David</HI> was sensi∣ble of this, and that made him pray, as in <HI>Psal.</HI> 51.11. <HI>Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy holy Spirit from me.</HI> God sometimes takes away h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Holy Spirit from his own dear Children, as to the quickning and comforting presence there∣of: therefore they had need be careful, that they grieve not the Holy Spirit, and that they quench not the Spirit. True Believers may grieve the Spi∣rit of God, and grieve him away from them, so as that the Comforter, that should relieve their Souls, shall be far from them. When any of Gods Children doe behave themselves, so as to grieve his Spirit, the Angels are also grieved: and if the Spirit of God goes from them, the Angels of God go from them too; for they are perfectly directed and acted by the Eternal Spirit, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 1.20. It is said, that <HI>whithersoever the Spirit was to goe, thither the Living Creatures went.</HI> If Gods Children shall give way to sin; if they shall be∣come guilty of any Scandalous iniquity, the Spi∣rit of God withdraws from them, and the Holy Angels goe away with him.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>When they that walk in the fear of God, fall into great Afflictions and Miseries, Holy Angels are with them, notwithstanding those Temptations.</HI> Angels are with the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to support &amp; comfort them, in all
<PB N="58" REF="000756_0074_0FAA495AAF7DD258"/>
their Temptations. Our blessed Lord was tempted and Victorious over all his temptation: It is recor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded that then <HI>Angels came, and ministred unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>▪ Math. 4.11. So it is as to Believers in their Spiritua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conflicts, though the ministration of Angels is in∣visible &amp; unperceivable by them that are concern∣ed therein. When they are in Agonies of Soul, Holy Angels desert them not. We read concern∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng the Lord Jesus Christ, that when he was i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Agony, <HI>there appeared Angels unto him from Hea∣ven, strengthening him,</HI> Luk. 22.43. Then (as on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> observes) the Master was comforted by the Ser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vant: an Angel from Heaven came, &amp; strengthen∣ed the blessed Lord Jesus in his Agonies. But th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are Believers oftentimes comforted in their de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jections by the secret Ministry of Holy Angel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> We see it in the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI>: He was dejected and disconsolate in his Spirit, at the consideratio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his exceeding sinfulness. We hear him crying, <HI>Woe is me, I am undone! I am a man of unclean lips</HI>: Alas, (says he) though I have been called to the Work and Office of a Prophet, I have not used my tongue for God so much as I should have done▪ now a <HI>Seraphim</HI> did comfort him in his dejection; an Angel came and said unto him, <HI>Thy sin is purged, thine iniquity is taken away,</HI> Isa: 6.7. <HI>Daniel</HI> was dis∣consolate, in thinking of the Afflicted state of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> People of God; his Spirit was much exercised &amp; dejected in him, but an Angel came unto him when in these dejections &amp; temptations, and tell him, that he was, <HI>a man greatly bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved,</HI> Dan. 10.11
<PB N="59" REF="000756_0075_0FAA495B6280A828"/>
Angels doe inable Gods Children to bear their temptations. It is wonderful and astonishing, to consider, how the Martyrs were sometimes enabled to bear the greatest Tortures and Torments, that the Devil could invent for them: They had An∣gels with them. Those instances of <HI>Babyl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> and <HI>Theodorus</HI> are famously known. Martyrs that were put to the Torture of the Rack, some of their friends afterward inquired of them, how they could possibly indure such intolerable pain; they told them, that when they were first on the Rack they were in great pain, but there seemed a young man to stand by them, who refreshed them with cold Water, that after a while they felt no pain, but their Torments were a pleasure to them, and they were grieved, when they were taken down from the Rack▪ One of our English Martyrs, in the time of Popery, in the midst of the Flames, could say to those that were Spectators, Papists ask for a miracle, here you may see one: I feel no more pain in this fire, then if I were in a soft bed. Surely then the Angels of Heaven were sent to quench the Violence of fire.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>God in due time will send his Angels to deliver his Servants out of all their Troubles.</HI> Sometimes Angels are sent to pluck them out of the very mouth of destruction. As it was with <HI>Lot</HI> &amp; his Family: Angels did lay their hands upon him, and on his Children, and delivered them from the burnings, <HI>Gen.</HI> 19.16.

examples to you, of some who have by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> strange Instinct, removed from the places whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they were: they have no sooner gone out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> doors, but the house hath fallen down: had they stayed there but a minute or two longer, they had perished in the Ruins. Doubtless there is a Secret Influence of the Angels of Heaven, in such things as these are. Sometimes, when the Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Servants are in the Jawes of death; he sends his Angels to deliver them. So it was with <HI>Daniel▪ My God</HI> (saith he) <HI>hath sent his Angel, and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> shut the Lions mouths that they have not hurt me.</HI> Dan. 6.22. That he saw an Angel, it is not said; but, he saw the Lions did not hurt him, and therefore might conclude, that God sent his Angel to shu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the mouthes of those Lions. Sometimes whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they were deprived of liberty, Angels have be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Instruments of restoring it to them again. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Apostles were cast into the common Prison, and an Angel came in the night, and set open the Prison-doors, <HI>Act.</HI> 5.19. So it was with <HI>Peter</HI>; he was cast into Prison, and the next day was to have been made a Sacrifice: but God sent his An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gel to deliver him, <HI>Act.</HI> 12.11. Sometimes me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that have been deprived of Health, have had i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> restored to them, by the Ministry of Holy An∣gels. An Angel did trouble the Waters in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pool of <HI>Bethesda,</HI> and who-ever first step'd in afte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Angel had troubled the Waters, was mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whole, what-ever disease he had, <HI>Job.</HI> 5.4.

<PB N="61" REF="000756_0077_0FAA495CF2AEBF28"/>
Angels frequently remove them. And when they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at fear God, have done all the work that He hath for them to do in the World, then he sends his Angels to fetch them away to Heaven. So are they by the Angels of the Lord delivered out of all their troubles. When <HI>Elijah</HI> had finished his course, there came a Chariot and Horses of fire, that is to say, Angels from Heaven, and did carry away <HI>Elijah</HI> thither. So when they that fear God, have done and suffered all that He hath appointed for them, then he sends Chariots and Horses of fire, to fetch-away their Souls. So are they by the Angels of the Lord delivered from all evil.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 2. But there is another <HI>Objection</HI> to be answered, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is the Lord that delivers those that fear him; He is the Preserver of men: and shall we ascribe their Deliverances to Angels? Is not that a Dishonour to God, to attribute that which is His Work to Angels, who are his Crea∣tures?</P>
<P>The <HI>Answer</HI> is clear, That God doth it by them; the Glory of Deliverances does not belong to the Angels, but to God, who sets them on work: It is said in this Psalm, concerning the Righteous man, <HI>Vers.</HI> 20. <HI>That the Lord keeps all his Bones, not one of them is broken</HI>; but this He does by giving his Angels Charge over them. The Lord is said to do that which is done by Angels immediately. It is said, God overthrew <HI>Sodom,</HI> Amos 4.16. And yet the Angels did it
<PB N="62" REF="000756_0078_0FAA495DC8F0B240"/>
<HI>Gen.</HI> 19.13. The Angels said, <HI>We are sent to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stroy this place.</HI> Well then, though Angels did it, God did it, and that by their Ministry. When the Enemies of them that feared the Lord, were routed and ruined by Holy Angels in <HI>Jehoshaphat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Times; nevertheless, <HI>That Battel was the Lords.</HI> 2 Chron. 20.15. The Glory of that Victory be∣longed to God, and not to them, when He was pleased to effect it by their Agency and Ministry. They have all their power from the Lord. What strength they have, it is God that hath given it to them: and their Commissions are granted to them by the Lord. The Charge that they have, it is God that gives them that Charge: <HI>He shall give his Angels charge. Psal.</HI> 91.11. And therefore they don't act, till they have order from God. When they have done one work, that they are set about, before they enter upon another, they must have a new Commission, and new Instructi∣ons, new Orders from that God, who is the Lord of Angels. Hence, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 1.24. It is said, that the Living Creatures, <HI>When they stood, they let down their Wings.</HI> When they had done, what God set them about, they let down their wings, hum∣bly waiting for a new Commission; they don't stir, till they have new Orders from the Great God, and then away they Fly: but till then, their Wings are let down. So that it is God, that doth it by their Hand. It is no dishonour to God, to make use of Instruments in his Work: and if He sees meet to use a thousand Instruments in
<PB N="63" REF="000756_0079_0FAA495E6ADB34E8"/>
one work, it is no dishonour to him, but rather a Discovery of His Greatness and Glory.</P>

<P>Inference 1. <HI>Hence, although Angelical Appariti∣tions are not to be expected in these days; nevertheless, the Ministry of Holy Angels, doth continue still.</HI> Their <HI>Appearings</HI> are in a great measure ceased, but their <HI>Working</HI> is not ceased, but continues as in former times. Indeed, there is not need now, as in the Dayes of the Old Testament, for Angels to ap∣pear visibly unto men, because the Scripture is now perfected, there must be no Addition made unto the Written Word of God, which now is sufficient to direct men in all cases what∣soever, that may concern their Salvation and Consolation. There was need for an Angel to appear to <HI>Daniel</HI> visibly, to instruct him, concern∣ing what should befal the People of God: and of an Angel to appear to the last Apostle <HI>John,</HI> to inform him, what should befal the Church in all future times. There is no need of that now: we must look into what <HI>Daniel</HI> and <HI>John</HI> have written; and there we may see, as much as is meet for us to be acquainted with. So that <HI>An∣gelical Apparitions</HI> are not frequent in these Days: Only Evil Angels do appear more often than
<PB N="64" REF="000756_0080_0FAA495F23487C68"/>
good Ones. No wonder, because they are of more Earthly Inclinations, than those Spirits, that dwell above. Evil Angels do often appear; very true, and sometimes pretending to be good An∣gels too. The Apostle saith, 2 Cor. 11.14. That <HI>Satan doth transform himself into an Angel of Light.</HI> He cometh to men, and appears visibly to them, and pretends to be an Angel of Light, and will give them good counsel, will pretend to be for Truth, and for Holiness, although he doth intend nothing less. I could mention to you instances respecting this. There was about four and twen∣ty years ago, in a place belonging to the King of <HI>Denmark's</HI> Dominions, a Young man, that a <HI>Dae∣mon</HI> appeared to, on a Lord's-day, in white shi∣ning Garments, and gave him excellent good counsel, telling him, that he must not sin, as for∣merly he had done; and that he must call upon others to amend their ways, to leave their Cur∣sing &amp; Swearing, &amp; other Sins; &amp; that he should pray to God every day three times; &amp; he would joyn with him in singing a Psalm too. And yet this <HI>Daemon</HI> did at last appear to be an Angel of Darkness. There was in <HI>Geneva,</HI> the Son of a Senator there, that was miserably imposed upon, by a <HI>Daemon,</HI> pretending to be a good Angel; that would complain of the Unbelief of some, who would not (though many did) look upon him as an Angel, that was sent from Heaven. And yet this <HI>Daemon,</HI> that appeared in a glorious manner, was at last discovered to be an Unclean
<PB N="65" REF="000756_0081_0FAA495FEF34CEF0"/>
Devil. I do the rather mention these things, because I understand, that something of this na∣ture hath lately happened in <HI>New-England,</HI> which I am perswaded, will in the issue appear to be a Delusion of the Evil One, that pretends to he an Angel of Light. Wherefore it is an unwarranta∣ble and a very dangerous thing, for men to wish, that they might see, and that they might converse with Angels. I could tell you of some, that have done so, &amp; God hath been provoked with them for their curiosity and presumption, and hath permit∣ted Devils to come to them, pretending to be good Angels, whereby they have been deceived and undone. But I say, although Angelical <HI>Ap∣paritions</HI> are not to be expected; nevertheless, their Ministry is still continued, and it shall be so: As long as there shall be any Fearers of God upon the Earth, so long shall there be Angels of Hea∣ven to Encamp round about them: That Pro∣mise, <HI>Psal.</HI> 91.11, 12. doth belong unto Believ∣ers, even to the End of the World; that God will send his Angels, and give them Charge over them, to keep them in all their ways, and to hold them up in their Arms, that they may not dash themselves against a stone. Yea, as long as there shall be any of the Elect of God in the World, so long shall there be the continuation of the Mi∣nistry of Holy Angels <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.14. <HI>Are they not sent forth to be Ministring Spirits, to them that shall be Heirs of Salvation?</HI> They then that are Heirs of Salvation, in all Ages of the World, are
<PB N="66" REF="000756_0082_0FAA4962A9EA02D0"/>
priviledged with this Ministry of the Angels.</P>
<P>Inference 2. <HI>For men to despise and abuse them that fear the Lord, must needs be an evil and dange∣rous thing.</HI> For they have Angels to guard them. The Angels of Heaven are far from despising them. There are no Nurses in the World, that do so tender the Children Educated by them, as the Angels do the meanest Saint on Earth com∣mitted to their Care: Saith Christ, <HI>Despise not one of my little ones</HI>: Despise them not, saith He, <HI>For I say unto you, that in Heaven their Angels do alwayes behold the Face of my Father, that is in Heaven.</HI> Math. 18.10. God gives His Angels a charge to look after them: and what will you despise them▪ Certainly, if the eyes of men were opened, to see who they are, and what a guard they have, they durst not despise them. As for them that truly Fear God, it may be said of them, as wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said of <HI>Gideon</HI>'s Brethren, <HI>Each one of them resem∣bleth the Children of a King.</HI> Thus as to those that Fear the Lord, each one of them resembleth a King. There is not a Monarch upon Earth, that hath such a guard about him, as every one that truly fears God, hath round about him con∣tinually. The Souldiers of Heaven do attend him, where ever he goes. If the eyes of wicked men were enlightned (as once the Eyes of the Prophet's Servant) they would not despise Holy men. When <HI>Elisha</HI>'s Servant was sore afraid, be∣cause of Enemies, that were come to apprehend
<PB N="67" REF="000756_0083_0FAA4964492D78D8"/>
his Master, the Prophet prayed, and said, <HI>Lord, open his Eyes</HI>: and presently he saw the Mountain full of Horses and Chariots of Fire: his Master's House was all surrounded with Angels. Did men see this, they would not cast contempt upon those that fear God. To abuse them, is a dangerous thing: One of those Angels, that they have a whole guard of, is able to destroy all the Ene∣mies, that they have in the whole World. It is said concerning the two Witnesses, <HI>That Fire goeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their Enemies: If any one will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.</HI> Rev. 11.5. When they call upon God, he sends <HI>Seraphims,</HI> yea, Horses and Chariots of fire against their Enemies. How doth fire go out of their mouths? It alludes to that of <HI>Elijah.</HI> When a crew of wicked men, came to lay hands on him, and said to him, Come, thou man of God, the King hath sent for thee: He replyed, <HI>If I be a man of God, let fire come down from Heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty</HI>: and fire came down from Heaven, and immediately destroyed them all. 2 <HI>King.</HI> 1.10, 11. There were Angels at hand, ready to consume the Prophets Enemies with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. You may observe sometimes, that persons who are full of enmi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and will be spitting their venom, against one that hath a special guard of Angels to attend him, blasting stroaks from Hea∣ven fall upon them. The Angels of that Holy man, have heard what hath been spoken, &amp; know what has been designed against him; and have
<PB N="68" REF="000756_0084_0FAA49646F096990"/>
taken his part. Take heed then, how you wrong any man, that is dear to God, and to His Holy Angels.</P>
<P>Inference 3. <HI>Hence they that f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r God, should be above the fears of outward evils,</HI> since they have God and his Angels to take care of them. <HI>If God be for us, who can be against us?</HI> Saith the Apostle. So if the Angels of God, are by his appointment for us, we need not fear, though we should be in as eminent danger, as <HI>David</HI> was in, when amongst the Philistines in <HI>Gath.</HI> Angels are able to defend us, and will do so, so far as a gracious God and Father shall see it meet for them to do. We have more for us, then are against us, if we have Angels to be for us, as the Prophet said unto his Servant, when they were surrounded with enemies: the Servant was afraid; <HI>Alas Master, how shall we do?</HI> said he: <HI>Fear not,</HI> says the Prophet, for <HI>there are more with us,</HI> than are with our enemies. And God opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw the mountain was full of Chariots and Horses of fire, round about <HI>Elisha,</HI> 2 King. 6.17. <HI>viz.</HI> An∣gels, that did so appear at that time. What tho' men are in danger; if they have a strong convoy, they do not fear. This is the case of Gods Children, whilst in this World: they are in danger; they are like men at Sea, &amp; in the midst of enemies: the Pirates of Hell are seeking to lay hands on them: But they have a strong convoy; they have Angels of Heaven to be a guard unto them: &amp; therefore need not be afraid of what their Enemies can do
<PB N="69" REF="000756_0085_0FAA49655D992218"/>
unto them. They that fear the Lord, may be above the fear of danger, when they go to Sea; only let them look to their call; let them look to it, that they are in Gods way; then He will send his Angels to look after them. So in great and hazardous Journies by land, they need not fear, but they shall go forth; and return in safety: If it be good for them to be preserved and protected, it shall be so, notwithstanding what ever evils may attend them in their way. Angels are more able to defend them, than all their enemies are able any way to hurt them. It was said concerning the Egyptians, Isa. 31-3. <HI>They are Flesh and not Spirit</HI>; they are poor weak Creatures. But now the Angels are Spirit and not Flesh: why then should they that fear God, be afraid of what their enemies can do unto them, who are flesh, and not spirit, when they have those to be their Guardians and deliver∣ers, that are spirit and not flesh? And they need not fear sickness and diseases; God will send his Angel to deliver them, if preservation from such a distemper shall be best for them. Psal. 91.10. <HI>There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.</HI> How so? It follows in the next verse, <HI>for he shall give His Angels charge over thee.</HI> So he doth wonderfully sometimes. I remember a Lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned man relates a remarkable Providence to this purpose, of the Chancellour of <HI>Navar,</HI> that heard a voice in the night, calling him by his name, and bidding him go out of that Town, because within a few dayes a terrible Plague would be
<PB N="70" REF="000756_0086_0FAA496654D60F88"/>
there, and make the Town desolate: He took the warning, and so escaped the danger. God hath strange wayes, by his Angels to deliver his Servants in times of sickness and common danger, when it shall be most for his glory. And they need not fear, what evil Angels can do unto them. The Lord for holy ends may suffer you to fall into the hands of those cruel Creatures: but if you fear God, there are Holy Angels by, that will not forsake you▪ that will inable you to endure, whatever God shall see mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, to suffer you to be tempted and afflicted with. And therefore be not afraid: only fear God, and trust in Him. And then, suppose the worst that can be supposed; suppose the Lord should give leave to those enemies to kill your bo∣dies; such a thing may, and sometimes has happen∣ed to the dear Servants of God: nevertheless, their Souls are safe, as being in the hands of Holy An∣gels. The Lord will say to his Angels, You Angels of mine, go and look after such a man, or woman, I commit to you the care and charge of their Im∣mortal Souls, to bring them safe to Heaven, after they have suffered, what is my pleasure to have them indure. That the fearers of the Lord may and ought to be above the fear of outward evils, from the consideration of the Ministry and Guard∣ianship of the Holy Angels, is evident from several things; which we may take notice of &amp; consider. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They are of all Creatures the most powerful</HI>: they are wonderful in strength, Psal. 103.20. <HI>Ye his An∣gels, that do excel in strength.</HI> They are not only
<PB N="71" REF="000756_0087_0FAA4966AE76F948"/>
strong, but they excel in strength. Therefore are they styled, <HI>Mighty Angels,</HI> 2 Thes. 1.7. They are stronger than men, <HI>greater in power and in might,</HI> as the Apostle speaks concerning them, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.11. One Angel is able to destroy all the men in the World. You have been told, that one Angel hath that <HI>might,</HI> that power, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God should give him a Commission, he is able to destroy the whole World before him. It is <HI>Luthers</HI> assertion, <HI>Unus Angelus est pot entior, quam totus mundus.</HI> Put the whole World together, and they have not the strength of one Angel. We see what powerful Creatures they are, by the things that have been done by them: Gates of Iron can't stand before them. When an Angel came to deliver <HI>Peter,</HI> the Iron-gate opened of its own accord. <HI>Act.</HI> 12.10. Nay, an Angel is able to make the very earth to shake, as has formerly been noted from Math. 28.2. Where we read, that there was <HI>a great Earth quake, for the Angel of the Lord descended from Heaven.</HI> All the men in the World can't make the earth to quake; but an Angel from Heaven is able to do it: such mighty Creatures are they. And we see what they can do, by what the Angel did in <HI>Senacheribs</HI> Army, and by their destroying <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomor∣rah,</HI> by thunder and lightning, and a terrible earth-quake. Those Citys were swallowed up in a moment, and they were Angels of God th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> did cause it to be so. Well then, be not afraid, as long as you have such mighty powerful Spirits as these are, near unto you, to defend and safe guard you against all your enemies.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="72" REF="000756_0088_0FAA49676FA39650"/>2. <HI>There are many of them to befriend us.</HI> An host, a whole Army of mighty Angels of the Lord round about them that fear him: Their number is exceeding great: They are a <HI>great Company,</HI> Psa. 68.11. There are thousands of them, Vers. 17. <HI>The Chariots of God</HI> (his Angels, by whom he obtains his Victories over the World, are the Chariots of God) <HI>they are twenty thousand, even thousands of An∣gels.</HI> Nay, there are Millions of them. <HI>Daniel</HI> saw Millions of Angels, Chap. 7. v. 10. And so did <HI>John,</HI> Rev. 5.11. There <HI>were many Angels,</HI> saith he, <HI>and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thou∣sand, and thousands of thousands.</HI> Nay, they are in∣numerable, Heb. 12.22. We are come unto <HI>an in∣numerable company of Angels.</HI> No man can say, how many <HI>Myriads</HI> of them there are: Is there any number of these Armies of God? <HI>Job</HI> 25.2. Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho' the Interpretation of one of the Antients is not so∣lid, that by the lost sheep in the parable mankind is meant, &amp; that by the ninety and nine the An∣gels are intended, and that therefore there are nine∣ty and nine Times as many Angels as men; Ne∣vertheless, it is most certain, that the Angels of Heaven are more in number by far, then all the men on earth: put all the men on the face of the earth together, they are but a small number, in comparison of the glorious Angels of the most high God. Hence Christ said to Peter, <HI>Thinkest thou, that I cannot pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve Legions of Angels,</HI> Math. 26.53. A <HI>Legion</HI> is six thousand six hundred and
<PB N="73" REF="000756_0089_0FAA4968247BE7A0"/>
sixty six. <HI>Twelve Legions</HI> made the <HI>Roman Army</HI>▪ What (saith Christ) though all the power of <HI>Rome</HI> is set against me, I could have more than that at a words speaking: I could have more Legions of Angels, than are men in the Emperors Army, to save me, if I would; or it may be, considering there were Twelve of them together (Christ and the eleven Apostles) when the Lord spoke these words, He would give them to understand, that He could obtain a Legion of Angels to defend each one of them. The Lord hath so many An∣gels, that he can spare multitudes of them; Armies of them, to attend every one of those that fear him in the World. As for one <HI>David,</HI> the Lord can send whole Armies to encamp round about him, and deliver him Why then should they that fear God, be afraid of evils in the World?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Angels are ready to do any Service for them that Fear God</HI>; ready to do it, as soon as ever God shall but speak the word to them: <HI>They hear∣ken to the Word of God,</HI> Psal. 103.20. Hearken to it; they stand and hearken, when once the word will go out of the mouth of God, and then they go without any delay. Indeed, Heaven is their proper Habitation; nevertheless (as before was intimated) they can fly from Earth to Heaven, and from Heaven to Earth, in a very little time: They are therefore represented in the Scripture, as <HI>Flying,</HI> and that <HI>swiftly.</HI> Dan. 9.21. The Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> (who appeared to the Prophet in an hu∣mane shape) <HI>Was caused to fly swiftly.</HI> In a little time,
<PB N="74" REF="000756_0090_0FAA4968E5669D90"/>
they can go from one end of the World, to the other, even like Lightning. <HI>Psal.</HI> 104.4. <HI>He makes His Angels Spirits, and His Ministers a flaming fire.</HI> Angels that are the Ministring Spirits, round a∣bout those that fear God, they fly like lightning, like a flame of fire. You see Lightning go from the West to the East, in the twinkling of an eye: So do the Angels of Heaven, in a moment of time, go from one end of the World to the o∣ther: and when God sends them on any Errand, they don't turn back, nor stop by the way, until such time as they have done that which the Lord hath appointed them unto. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 1.12. <HI>The Li∣ving Creatures, they went, and turned not, when they went,</HI> but went on, till they had dispatched th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Work the Lord had commanded them to per∣form. These things considered, they that fear the Lord, may have great comfort, notwithstand∣ing the evils and dangers, which in this wofu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> World, they are liable unto. It was an express<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on full of Faith, uttered by a late faithful and la∣borious Minister of Christ, when some wondred to see him so chearful under great Afflictions, I (said he) <HI>Have God for my Father, Christ for my Redeemer, the Holy Spirit for my Sanctifier, Heaven for my Inheritance, Holy Angels for my Guardians,</HI> &amp; shall not I then rejoyce?</P>
<P>Inference 4. <HI>We may here see, that the Angels are not to be adored, although they are to be Loved and Honoured.</HI> They are Creatures, and therefore not
<PB N="75" REF="000756_0091_0FAA4969A8B14450"/>
to be adored. We may love Creatures, but must not worship them; we must not give unto them, that which is God's due alone: Religious Wor∣ship is so. Psal. 76.11. <HI>Bring Presents unto Him that ought to be feared.</HI> God is he, and He only, that ought to be feared, as to a Religious Fear. And therefore when the Devil desired to be wor∣shipped▪ the Lord Jesus Christ said, Get th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e hence, <HI>Satan,</HI> for it is written, <HI>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou Serve, Mat.</HI> 4.10. When <HI>Manoah</HI> would have presented an Offering unto the Angel that did appear to him, <HI>Judg.</HI> 13.16. saith the Angel, <HI>If thou wilt offer a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urnt-offering, thou must offer it unto the Lord.</HI> Burnt-offerings, and so all Religious Worship, must be Offered unto God, and not unto an Angel.

condemned in the Scripture. Col. 2.18. <HI>Let no man beguile you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f your reward, in a voluntary humi∣lity, and Worshipping of Angels.</HI> It is <HI>Will-worship, voluntary humility</HI>: there is no Command in the Scripture to worship them; and when men do, as the <HI>Platonick Philosophers</HI> did, (and as some that call themselves Christians in these dayes do) pre∣tend, that they are not worthy to come to God immediately; but therefore they will go to him by Angels, and worship them, and desire them to present their Supplications unto God: this i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> voluntary humility. Such do not <HI>Own the Head,</HI> as the Apostle speaks in the 19<HI>th.</HI> verse; they put Christ out of his Office, to whom it belongs to Offer up the Prayers of his People to God. The Holy Angels themselves have forbid men to wor∣ship them: The Apostle <HI>John</HI> being amazed at the Glory of the Angel that appeared to him, fell down at his feet to worship him. <HI>Rev</HI> 22.9. saith the Angel to him, <HI>See thou do it not, for I am of thy Fellow servants.</HI> Men may not worship those that are their Fellow-servants. The high∣est Angel in Heaven, and the meanest Saint upon the Earth, are Fellow-servants, they Serve the same God, and must worship him, and him only. We may not invocate Angels: we may not pray unto them: There is the same Object of Prayer, that there is of Faith. Rom. 10.14. <HI>How shall they call on him, on whom they have not believed?</HI> We may not call upon, or pray unto him, that we may not believe on. Now God alone is the
<PB N="77" REF="000756_0093_0FAA496BAE13CAA8"/>
Object of Faith: We may not pray unto any one, but unto him that is Omnipresent and Om∣nipotent, unto him that hath power to do for us whatever we can desire of him. We stand in need of many Blessings, which none but God can give unto us; which no Angel in Heaven can bestow upon us. We need the par∣don of sin: and who can forgive sins, but God only? We need Sanctifying Grace: and who can give us Grace, but God alone? As for the Angel that <HI>Jacob</HI> did pray unto, he was not a Created Angel, but the Son of God, who is called an Angel in respect of his Office, as being sent by God. Therefore <HI>Jacob</HI> called the name of the place, where he wrestled with the Angel, <HI>Peniel,</HI> Gen. 32.30. which signifies, <HI>The Face of God,</HI> for (saith he) <HI>I have seen God.</HI> The Angel he pray∣ed unto, was God; so the Prophet <HI>Hosea</HI> declares, Hos. 12.4, 5. <HI>He had power over the Angel, even the Lord of Hosts, that is his Memorial.</HI> That An∣gel is called by the name of <HI>Jehovah</HI>; and that glorious Title, <HI>Of the Lord of Hosts,</HI> is attributed unto him. All the Hosts of Heaven, all the An∣gels there, are commanded by that Angel, whom <HI>Jacob</HI> did worship: He therefore was no other than the Son of God himself, who is God. But although we may not pray unto created Angels, who Minister unto us, and are our Fellow-ser∣vants; this notwithstanding, they are to be, tho' not adored, yet loved and honoured by us: There is an Honour due to the Blessed Angels, an Ho∣nour
<PB N="78" REF="000756_0094_0FAA496CDFFDA2E0"/>
of <HI>Moral Reverence.</HI> We are to honour those persons, who are many ways, and on many accounts, our Superiours: we ought to Reverence them: we reverence a man, that is known to be Eminent for his Parts, Learning and great Ac∣complishments. It was said of <HI>Solomon, All Israel feared him, because they saw the Wisdom of God i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him.</HI> 1 King. 3.28. As for a man, that is full of wisdom, knowledge, and understanding, reve∣rence is due unto him: So it is much more to one that excels in Piety and Holiness. It is said of <HI>Herod,</HI> Mark 6 20. <HI>That He feared John the Bapti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, knowing that he was an holy man, and a just.</HI> The Image of God is to be reverenced, where∣ever it doth appear: Now the Image of God doth appear in the Angels more than in any Crea∣tures in all the World. They then are to be ho∣noured by us: But it is only a <HI>Fraternal,</HI> not a <HI>Divine</HI> Honour, which is their due: <HI>Cultus Fra∣ternae Societatis.</HI> And as we are bound to honour and reverence, so likewise to love those Holy Spirits. They are of the same Family with us: then we ought to love them: Both they and we are of God's Family: The Angels and Believers on Christ, have the same Father. They are Children of the same Father, though on a di∣vers account: Believers are styled, <HI>The Sons of God, Job.</HI> 1.12. And so are the Angels styled, Job 1.6. They joyn with us in praising our Lord Redeemer. We ought then to Love them. They rejoyce at the welfare of the Childre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of
<PB N="79" REF="000756_0095_0FAA496D62B6B418"/>
men: it is a joy to them, when good happens to them that fear God, their Lord and ours, <HI>Luk.</HI> 2.11, 13. You see here, how glad the Angels were, when there was good tidings for us men: The Angel said unto the Shepherds, <HI>I bring you glad tidings of great joy, unto you a Saviour, Christ the Lord, is born. And there was with the Angel a multitude of the Heavenly host, Praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth Peace, good will to∣ward men.</HI> When God did manifest his good will toward men, the Angels were glad, and did break forth into holy Praises, because there is by Christ Peace made between Heaven and Earth. Thus also they rejoyce at the Conversion of the Elect of God. Hence it is said, <HI>There is joy in Heaven over a sinner that doth repent,</HI> Luk. 15.7. And how joy in Heaven? in Verse 10. It is explained by saying, <HI>There is joy among the Angels</HI> over a sinner that re∣penteth: They rejoyce to see, that there are Souls <HI>New born,</HI> to fill up those places, which the Apostate Angels have left Vacant in Heaven. They are glad to see new-born Souls come there. Again, the Angels do very great Service for God, &amp; many kind Offices for us, therefore they are to be both loved and honoured by them that fear him.</P>
<P>Inference 5. <HI>It is a very Angelical, and therefore an honourable thing to be Serviceable.</HI> This is to be as the Angels of Heaven are. When God doth imploy any man in doing Service for his Name, he doth put very great honour upon that man.

1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2 30. <HI>They that honour me, I will honour.</HI> And how doth God honour them? by using them in his Service, that is the Honour there especially in∣tended. God will imploy them in his Service, &amp; in that respect honour them, just as he honours th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Angels of Heaven. The glory of the Saints at the Resurrection, is expressed by that of their being made <HI>like unto the Angels,</HI> Luk. 20.36. They shall then be <HI>Angels fellows.</HI> And so are they that are imployed in Services for the great God, <HI>they are like unto the Angels,</HI> they are made Fellow-Servants with the Angels of Heaven, for, they are all of them the Servants of the great God, and are on that account stiled his <HI>Ministers,</HI> Psal. 103.21. <HI>Ye An∣gels, ye Ministers of his that do his pleasure.</HI> And let me say to you, There are thousands of Millions of those Ministers in the Court of the great King of Heaven, Dan. 7.10. <HI>There are ten thousand times ten thousand that stand before him, and that Minister unto him.</HI> It is then a glorious thing to be imployed in Service for God. It is accounted a great honour and happiness, to be a Servant to an earthly Prince, as the Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> said to <HI>Solomon,</HI> 1 King. 10.8. <HI>Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy Servants, which continually stand before thee.</HI> But then what is it to stand before God &amp; the Lord Jesus Christ, as a Servant of his? It is a glorious thing. When God would put honour upon <HI>Moses</HI> after his death, he calls him his Servant.

God.</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 9.6. It was said of <HI>Samuel,</HI> that he was a <HI>Man of God, an Honourable man.</HI> He was therefore an Honourable man, because a Man of God. What can be more honourable than this, that if it be asked concerning one, <HI>Whose man is that</HI>? Whose Servant is that man? The Answer must be, <HI>He is God's man,</HI> he is a man of God? It is a Title fit for an Angel of Heaven. <HI>Manoah</HI> called the Angel that had ap∣peared to his Wife, <HI>A Man of God,</HI> Judg. 13.8. So then, to be imployed in Service for God, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o small mercy: To be Serviceable to the World is a marvellous happiness; it is to be like the Angels of Heaven, who do great Service, even for the World: They prevent Evils from coming on the World. To be serviceable that way, is an honour and happiness, and indeed Angelical. What a World would this be, did not God use Holy Angels to prevent the miseries that other∣wise would overwhelm it? What work would the Devils make in the World, did not the Lord by his Holy Angels prevent them! The Devil hath made this World become miserable enough, but he would make it become more miserable, to be a meer Hell, but that the Blessed Holy God imployes Angels to prevent him in his De∣signs.

<P>Inference 6. <HI>If the Angels of the Lord Incamp round about them that fear him, here is uncomfortable news for such as do not fear God.</HI> They may not pretend unto this glorious priviledge of the Guar∣dianship of Holy Angels. They cannot say, that the Angel of the Lord doth Encamp round about them, and will deliver them. Three or four particulars evincing and confirming the Truth o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this <HI>Inference,</HI> may be here mentioned.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Until such time as men fear God, they cann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> know, that the Angels are concerned for them.</HI> It i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> true, that God chargeth his Angels with his E∣lect before they fear him: but they cannot know this, and therefore cannot have the comfort of it, before they turn to the Lord▪ A man cannot know his Election before his Conversion. Hence the Apostle speaks, as 2 Pet. 1.10. <HI>Give diligence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> make your Calling and Election sure.</HI> He that would be sure of his Election, must be sure of his being effectually Called. If he hath the true fear of God in his heart, he may know, that he is appointed an Heir of Salvation, and so may
<PB N="83" REF="000756_0099_0FAA49742A6F1D08"/>
know, that the Angels have a charge given to them concerning him. For, if God had not from all Eternity intended that man's Salvation, he would never have put his fear into his heart. So that when once Grace is wrought in his Soul, he may be sure, that the Angel of the Lord Encam∣peth round about him: But before that, he can∣not have the comfort of this Truth.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is certain, that the Angels do not delight in those that fear not God.</HI> They don't care to be in their Company. As God himself delights not in them; <HI>By Nature we were the Children of Wrath</HI>: they that are still in their Nature, in their natural <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nconverted State, are Children of Wrath; The Wrath of God abides on them that believe not: He is angry with the wicked every day. And as an holy man cannot delight in the company, and conversation of those that are ungodly: <HI>Da∣vid</HI> saith, <HI>All my delight is with the Saints on Earth:</HI> and again, <HI>I am a Companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy Precepts.</HI> So must it be concluded concerning Holy Angels, that they delight not in communion with such as do not fear God. If holy men cannot do it, Angels who are holier than they, can never do it. It is a very offensive thing to an holy man, to see o∣thers do things that are inconsistent with the fear of God, to hear them speak such words, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them do such deeds, as cannot well stand with the true Fear of God. It is a grief and vexation to him, that has a righteous Soul within him, as
<PB N="84" REF="000756_0100_0FAA47D867B76F48"/>
it was to <HI>Lot.</HI> Much more then are the Holy Angels offended thereat: <HI>Doves</HI> can't endure to be where there is an ill scent; you know it drives them away. So when men indulge themselves in the wayes of Sin, the Angels, those Doves of Heaven, fly away and can't endure their compa∣ny. It is a celebrated sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Luthers, Ubi non est gratia▪ ibi n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um habet Angelorum cust<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dia.</HI> Graceless men may not pretend to the Guardian∣ship of holy and glorious Angels, unto whom they are abominable.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Evil Angels have a fearful power over them that fear not God.</HI> They are said to be under Sa∣tans Power. <HI>Paul</HI> was sent to the Gentiles, that he might turn them from darkness to light, and from the <HI>power of Satan unto God,</HI> Acts 26.18. They then that are no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> turned from darkness, turned from sin, but remain still in their uncon∣verted State, are not turned from the power of Satan: the Devil doth claim a right in ungodly men, as those that are his own; he claims them as his house that he hath power to be in. Thus the unclean spirit, in <HI>Mat.</HI> 12.43. saith, <HI>I will re∣turn to my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouse.</HI> A wicked man is the Devils House, where he dwells, and where he rules. Sinners are the cursed children of the Devils Family, and are therefore called, <HI>The Seed of the Serpent,</HI> Gen. 3.15. The Devil, he is the Serpent, wicked men are the seed, the children of that accursed Serpent. And the Apostle saith, <HI>He that committeth Sin, is of the Devil▪ for the De∣vil

As <HI>Chil∣dren</HI> are o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Father, so are they that commit sin, <HI>of the Devil</HI>; his image they bear, and him they imitate, as Children their Father. And they are his Slaves, woeful Slaves in the Kingdom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, <HI>Taken Captive by the Devil at his will,</HI> 2 Tim. 2.26. They are his Captives and Slaves: he doth even what he will with them: If the Devil put them upon doing this or that wickedness, they will do it. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he tempt them to Curse and Swear, they will do it: And if the Devil tempts them to Uncleanness, or to Lying, and such like abominable things, they will do as he would have them.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>As for such as shall continue in their Unregene∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate State, that shall live so, and dye so, the Angels are their Enemies.</HI> The Angels of the Lord, that Encamp round about them that fear him, and deliver them, are Enemies to them that fear him not. When <HI>Balaam</HI> persisted in his wicked way, the Angel that met him, if he had not humbled himself, would have been his death. There have been thousands of men in the world, concerning whom it is certain, (though they were not sensi∣ble of it, until after their Souls were out of their Bodies) the Angels have been their death: The Angels of Heaven have secretly smitten them, and they have dyed. As for such, <HI>Davids</HI> Pray∣er is made good against them, Psal. 34 4, 5. <HI>Let the Angel of the Lord chase them: let their way be dark and slippery▪ and let the Angel of the Lord
<PB N="86" REF="000756_0102_0FAA47D9E6EDA708"/>
persecute them.</HI> That Prayer will be remembred against the Enemies of God and his People, to the end of the World: And when Death comes, the Angels forsake them, and leave them in the hands of Devils. How should the Soul of a wic∣ked man ever get to Heaven? he must pass tho∣row an Army of Devils, thousands of millio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of them that lie in the way. And the good Angels forsake him; they will not, nor may they take any care of his Soul: and therefore he can never get to Heaven; and at the Day of Judgment, the Angels will be the Ministers of Justice, by whom the Wrath of God shall be Executed on sinful Creatures. <HI>In the time of the Harvest the Reapers gather the Tares into Bundles to bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n them.

Encamp round about us, and deliver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us. Alas! we are not sensible as we should be, how much we are beholden to God, for the Ministry of his Angels. It is a sad thing, that this is no more thought of by Christians. I remembea a Wor∣thy Divine justly complains of it, that although Angels are frequently spoken of in the Scriptures, they are therein expresly mentioned above two hundred and sixty times over; yet it is rare to hear Ministers Preach on such a Subject, or to instruct and inform their people, how much we are beholden to God for His Angels: and it is rare to hear Christians praising the Lord for their Ministry: That which God has promised to every Believer, all Christians ought to praise him for: But the Guardianship of Angels is pro∣mised to every one that belongs to Christ. <HI>Psal.</HI> 91.11. Mat. 18.10. Heb. 1.14. we should praise the Lord for all his benefits. <HI>Psal.</HI> 103.2. There∣fore we may not forget to praise him for so great a benefit as that of his appointing his Angels to Encamp round about us. As long as we know in general that we have Angelical Aids and Assist¦ances, and that ordinarily, though we know not in particular when they are more peculiarly helpful to us, we sin if we express not our Thank¦fulness to God for so high a favour. And altho' men truly pious may be too forgetful of their du∣ty in this, as well as in other matters; neverthe∣less, as for the person who is so <HI>Atheistical in his Principles,</HI> as to deny this Honour due to God,
<PB N="88" REF="000756_0104_0FAA47DB60171680"/>
he has cause to fear that himself is a Servant in Satans Kingdom, and one whom the Holy An∣gels have no kindness for. Let us consider a few things, which shew what cause they that fear him, have to praise him on this account.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Angels take care of the Elect of God, all their lives long, from the beginning to the end of their dayes.</HI> Throughout the whole course of their lives, from the Cradle to the Grave, Angels are charged with them. Not only after they are a∣dult, and have learned to fear and serve the Lord. but before that. If they are ministring Spirits, to them that shall be Heirs of Salvation, then an Heir of Salvation doth no sooner come into the World, but the Angels are charged to look after him. There are many heirs of Salvation, that dye before they come to adult age, whom nevertheless the Angels have a charge over: The Scripture speaks <HI>Of Little Ones, that have their An∣gels.</HI> Mat. 18.10. <HI>Despise not one of these Littl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ones</HI> (saith Christ) <HI>for their Angels do behold the Face of my Father in Heaven.</HI> Although such as are little in their own esteem, and little perhaps in the esteem of the World, may be intended in the Scripture, yet a literal Interpretation must not be excluded. Christ took a little Child into His Arms, and said, <HI>These Little Ones have their An∣gels</HI>: As for them that belong to the Election of God, the Devil is set against them to destroy them, as soon as they come into the World, on∣ly Angels do prevent it: As one speaks well, <HI>The
<PB N="89" REF="000756_0105_0FAA47DE5ECFF080"/>
Devil doth ramp about the Elect of God, whilst they are in their swadling clothes:</HI> But they have Holy Angels to protect them against the rage of Hell: as we read concerning the Man-child, <HI>Rev.</HI> 12.4. as soon as he was born, the Dragon would have devoured him. Which words although they are figurative, they allude to that which is really true. An Elect Child is no sooner born into the world, but there are Devils that would destroy it; but God sets his Angels to preserve and deliver it: The Lord Jesus Christ, when in a state of infan∣cy, had his life secured by the Ministry of An∣gels. <HI>Mat.</HI> 2.13. and so is it with many of those that belong to the Lord Jesus Christ, as the Heirs of his Salvation: and when they are past their Infancy, in adult age, and when they come to Old Age, still Angels are with them, Encamping round about them, and deliv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring them from many an unseen evil, which otherwise had prov∣ed their destruction: They are with them in all places, where the Hand of God leads them: When they are in this place, Angels are with them; and when they go into another Land, Angels are with them there: From Childhood to Old Age it is so: As the Lord speaks in Isai. 46.3, 4. <HI>From the Womb unto Old Age, I will bear, and I will carry and deliver them.</HI> How doth the Lord bear his Chosen Ones from the Womb, &amp; unto their Old Age? Truly, He doth it by the Hands of Angels; He gives Holy Angels a charge that they shall bear them in their Arms, and hold them in their Hands.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="90" REF="000756_0106_0FAA47DE6826A020"/>2 <HI>Consider, if we fear God, the Angels will not forsake us at death.</HI> They will be with us all our lives long; yea, and at and after death too: when we must forsake all the World; when our Bodies and Souls must part for a time; when our Souls forsake our Bodies; the blessed Angels will not leave us, until they have brought us into the presence of Christ in Glory. The very Heathen Philosophers, some of them had sentiments con∣cerning this thing: They did not only believe, that the Souls of men are Immortal, but that at the time of Death, Evil Angels do carry away the Souls of wicked men, into a place of Tor∣ment: and that Good Angels carry the Souls of good men into a better World than this is: Doubtless, they had that knowledge from the Jews, as they had many notions (though they corrupted them) concerning the Invisible World from them, and the Jews from the Patriarchs &amp; Prophets of old. The blessed Scriptures of God are exceeding clear concerning this: When <HI>Eli∣jah</HI> was Translated, there appeared a <HI>Chariot of Fire, and Horses of Fire</HI>; that is to say, Angels in that form, to carry him up to Heaven, 2 <HI>King.</HI> 2.11. So when Believers leave this World, there is a Chariot and Horses of Fire prepared to conduct them to Glory: Hence is that Luk. 16.9. <HI>Make to your selves friends of the mammon of unrighteous∣ness, that when ye fail, they may receive you into E∣verl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ng Habitations</HI>: When ye fail, that is, when you dye, or cease to be in this World;

<HI>they may receive you,</HI> that is to say, that they whose office it is to receive you, namely, the Holy An∣gels, that they may receive your Souls into their Arms, and carry them upon their Wings into E∣verlasting Habitations: and therefore in the Pa∣rable concerning the Rich man and <HI>Lazarus,</HI> it is said of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> that when he dyed, <HI>he was car∣ried by the Angels into Abraham's Bosome,</HI> Luk. 16.22. that is, to a place of blessed rest and repose: for, the words evidently allude, as to the History of <HI>Abraham</HI> and his faithful Servant <HI>Eleazar,</HI> so to the Jews manner of Feasting, who as they sat at meat, one did lean on the Bosome of anoth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. <HI>Dives,</HI> notwithstanding all his grandeur, never had such Attendants, as poor dying <HI>Lazarus</HI> had: <HI>Dives</HI> never had a guard of Angels to surround him, and to conduct him, where he should find rest, as we see dying <HI>Lazarus</HI> had.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Consider what benefit they that fear the Lord, shall receive by the Ministry of Angels at the Last and Great Day.</HI> Those Angels that do accompa∣ny their Souls, to the Mansions prepared for them in their Fathers House that is above, will come back again with them, at the day when there shall be a joyful meeting, between their Bodies and Souls, that have been for so long separated from each other. All the Angels in Heaven will be here at that Day: not an Angel in Heaven, but will come down into this lower World at that day.

And do we think, that they will then do nothing for the Heirs of Salvation? yes, surely. For altho' the Work of Resurrection, like that of Creation, will (as a great Divine observes) be Effected by the Al∣mighty Power of God alone, without the inter∣veniency of Angels, or <HI>Secondary Finite Agents</HI>;
<PB N="94" REF="000756_0110_0FAA47E529845390"/>
nevertheless, they will then be Employed to the unspeakable comfort and joy of all the Children of God. The Blessed Angels will go down with them, to the places where their Dead Bo∣dies shall be revived, and then will carry those Bodies unto the Right-hand of Jesus Christ, where he shall sit to Judge all the Earth. Mat. 24.31. <HI>He will send his Angels, and they shall gather toge∣ther his Elect, from one end of Heaven to the other.</HI> They must gather them together, and must bring them to the Lord Jesus Christ at that day. And then the Angels will separate all wicked men from them, so that none but Saints shall be toge∣ther, which is a wonderful happiness. What a blessed spot of Earth would that be, if there could be a place found, where there are none but Saints, none but good men, and those made perfect too. Thus shall it be at that Day; and this will be effected by the Ministry of the An∣gels of Heaven: <HI>The Son of Man shall send fort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Angels, and they shall gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend, and them that do iniquity.</HI> Mat. 13.41. In that Kingdom there will be none but real Saints of God. The Angels will drive away the Wicked, that none shall come there, as of old they kept Apostate <HI>Adam</HI> out of Paradise; And they will come in as witnesses of the fi∣delity and piety of them that have feared and served God in sincerity. It is therefore said, that <HI>we are made a spectacle unto the Angels.</HI> 1 Cor. 4.9. Angels do observe us, while we are acting our

Oh! then, let us bless God for the Ministry of his Angels! Why hath God revealed so much in his Word concerning his Angels, but that he might have praise from us on that account: Because some have indulged themselves in vain and curious un∣scriptural speculations, others say it is dangerous to discourse and think of Angels. But i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we keep to the Scripture, we may as safely discourse of Angels, as of the poorest worm on the Earth. I say again, Why is it, that God hath in his writ∣ten Word spoken so much concerning his An∣gels? Is it that we should give glory to them? They all with one voice say, <HI>Do it not.</HI> But it is, that we might give glory to God on the account of what they do for us. Let us not thank An∣gels, but let us thank God for his Angels.</P>

<P>For Answer.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We must make sure, that we have an interest in Jesus Christ.</HI> For, all the Angels of Heaven are at His Command, who is their Lord and General. The Man Christ Jesus commands the living Creatures: He sits on a Throne in the Firmament, which is above ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their heads; and they con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inually receive Orders from him. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 1.26.

If the Lord Jesus, who sayes the Angels are his, shall say to this or that Angel in Heaven, Go thy way, there is such a Ser∣vant of mine, take thou the care of him, it is done immediately. And it is by means of the Mediation of Jesus Christ, that we obtain this

priviledge of the Ministry of Angels. <HI>The An∣gels of God ascend and descend on the Son of Man.</HI> Joh. 1.51. It is by means of the Son of man, by means of Jesus Christ, that the Angels of God do ascend &amp; descend for us, as for <HI>Jacob</HI> of old▪ Christ is the <HI>Jacobs</HI> Ladder which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oucheth Earth and Heaven, and joynes them both together by his Mediation. If Christ be ours, His Holy An∣gels are ours too <HI>If ye are Christs,</HI> then <HI>all is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ours</HI> Hence the Apostle speaks <HI>of things in Hea∣ven that are by Christ reconciled:</HI> There are Souls in Heaven indeed, that are reconciled to God by means of Jesus Christ; which some take to be the meaning of that Scripture: But it is moreover true, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at there are Angels in Heaven, who are by Christ reconciled, not to God, whom they have not offended, but to us. When we had sin∣ned, those Creatures in Heaven, those Holy Spi∣rits, were offended at us, but Jesus Christ hath caused friendship to be between Angels in Hea∣ven and Saints on Earth: If we belong to Christ, we are for his sake dear to his Angels: They take pleasure in doing good Turns <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or them that are by Faith united to Christ, be they never so mean in the World. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Christ, we are the Angels Fellow Servants.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us be careful to walk in the Fear of God.</HI> If his Angels Encamp round about them that fear Him: let us then keep in his fear. Remember what you have lately heard from <HI>Prov.</HI> 23▪ 17. <HI>Be thou in the Fear of the Lord all the day long:</HI> The

way to have the Protection of Angels all the day long, is to be in the Fear of the Lord all the day long. Oh! take heed of going out of God's way: His Angels have a charge to keep those that keep in his way: Therefore are we greatly concerned, not to go out of God's way; give not way to sin and temptation; you will not on∣ly offend God, but grieve and offend Holy An∣gels if you do. Oh! how the Angels lament it, when they see a man that fears God, doing that which ill becomes him! When they see a man that fears God, give way to the corruptions of his own heart, how do the Holy Angels (though we hear it not) lament over that man! They are grieved to see it. But on the other hand, Oh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> how do the Angels rejoyce, when they see a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> walking closely with God, always serving, always doing something or other for God; how do the Angels rejoyce over that man, and delight to be with him! Be therefore much in the exercise o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Fear of God. Exercise your selves unto God∣liness. Be constant and frequent in Religious Duties: Angels love to see it. Be much in Pray∣er to God in Jesus Christ, that is the way to have Angels with you.

The Angels of Heaven have a special charge given to them concerning those that are much in mourn∣ing for sin. We read in the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> of six men, that had brought their Weapons with them, that is to say, six Angels. Angels are cal∣led men; as the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> was called the <HI>man Gabriel,</HI> so they are called <HI>six men,</HI> because they appeared like men; they had slaughter wea∣pons in their hands, they were to make dreadful destructions and desolations in the World. But the Lord Jesus Christ saith to them, <HI>Set a mark on them that sigh and crie and mourn for the abom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nations that are done in Jerusalem.</HI> Saith Christ, I have a small company of gracious, humble, pray∣ing Souls in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> who mourn for the sins of the times, do you my Angels have a special care of them, and come not near any of them to hurt them, when you are destroying all the World before you. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 9.4, 6.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let us imitate the Angels of Heaven.</HI> Let us endeavour to be as like them as may be, to be∣come as Angelical, as our state of Infirmity will permit us to be. We should imitate Angels in respect of Serviceableness. The Angels are in∣struments of good to the World. So ought we▪

to as many as possibly we can: we should endea∣vour, that the World may fare the better for us. The Angels are in a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>culiar manner serviceable to the Church of God. Let us then in our seve∣ral places and stations do all the Service we can, for the Church of God, in our generation; and we should be like them, in respect of obedience unto the Will of God. They are Patterns of Obedience unto us <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.10.

If we are like the Angels in respect of Holiness, after the Resurrection we shall be like them (and that not only as to our Souls, but our Bodies too) in respect of Glory and Immortality. <HI>In the Resurrection they are like the Angels of God in Heaven,</HI> Mat. 22.30.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Let us remember, that the Eyes of Angels are upon us.</HI> God hath his Angels every where: Those Spirits of God are sent to and fro through∣out

all the Earth. Did men remember this, it would by the Blessing of God, be a means to keep them from much sin, and so of keeping Ho∣ly Angels near unto them. Why shouldest thou sin <HI>before the Angel</HI>? Eccles. 5.6. If a man when tempted to commit a sin, should behold an An∣gel saying to him, Oh! do not this abominable thing which the Lord hates, would it not restrain him. Such a sight would make as graceless a man as <HI>Balaam</HI> was▪ afraid to go on wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h his in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended wickedness. Indeed, the first and chief motive that should make us careful and watchful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver our selves in all our wayes, is the considera∣tion of the Presence of God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, that the Eyes of the Eternal God, and of Jesus Christ the Son of God, whose eyes are as a Flame of Fire, are upon us, but also this of the Angels is to be improved as a motive to Obedience. So we see the Apostle in the place before mentioned, doth from this consideration incite <HI>Timothy</HI>▪ to the greater circumspection: <HI>I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Elect Angels.</HI> Not only the remembrance and meditation of the Eye of God and of Christ, but of the <HI>Elect Angels,</HI> should move us. The Angels do observe us in all places; they observe how we Worship God in solemn Assemblies. The Apostle requires that there should be modesty &amp; decency of behaviour in Church-assemblies, <HI>be∣cause of the Angels.</HI> 1 Cor. 11.10. They come into Church-assembly: For Christ has his Throne

there: He never sits on his Throne, but there a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny Angels to attend him. How many Angels are in this Assembly, I know not, but this I know, there are many to observe how I Preach, and how you Hear the Word of God. <HI>David</HI> says, <HI>Before the Gods I will sing praise to thee,</HI> Psal. 138 1. which the seventy express by saying, I will sing unto thee <HI>in the presence of Angels.</HI> Yea, and Angels observe us in our Families, and in our Closets and Retirements also: and with∣out doubt they make report concerning us before the Great God: They say, Lord, There is such a Servant of thine, we see that he walks before God with a perfect heart in his House: we see that he is often at Prayer alone, and that he mourns for sin, we are witnesses of it: and what shall we do more for that Servant of thine, do the Angels say. Let us remember these things; and if we act accordingly, it will not be long before we shall see these Angels, that now you only hear of; but cannot see: It will not be long before we shall see them. And as the Lord said to his Prophet, <HI>Zech.</HI> 3.7. <HI>If thou wilt walk in my wayes▪ and if thou wilt keep my charge, I wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> give thee places to walk among these that stand by.</HI> Who were they? concerning whom it is said, <HI>These that stand by</HI>▪ They were Holy Angels.

day. Let us be careful to walk with God now▪ and within a little while, we shall walk with Holy Angels in the Galleries of Heaven, where they will tell us wonderful things, concerning what they have done for us, which we little think of now; how they delivered us at such a time, how they were with us at such a place, how they prevented such and such designs from taking effect against us. And then shall they and we joyn together in <HI>Ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lasting Hallelujahs</HI> to God and to Jesus Christ. You see in the fifth Chapter of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> how the Twenty four Elders and the Angels all concur and harmonize in ascribing Praises and Glory unto God in Jesus Christ, saying, <HI>Blessing, Honour and Glory unto Him that sits upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</HI> Thus shall it be in that blessed day (which the Lord hasten) when we shall be in the Heavenly Jerusalem, with the Spirits of Just men made perfect, and with the Innumera∣ble Company of Angels.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THere were in the Primitive Times (as there are in these days) men, who altho' they did call themselves Chri∣stians, had apostatized from the great Truths of the Gospel, imbracing Fundamental Errors in Religion. The Apostle in the begin∣ning of this Chapter, shews, that such cannot Es∣cape the Destroying Judgments of Heaven, which would unavoidably come upon them. And this he proves by an Argument taken from the Ex∣ample
<PB N="105" REF="000756_0121_0FAA47F05C0D4E10"/>
of what had befallen other Sinners. There are three exceeding awful Instances here menti∣oned. The <HI>First</HI> is that of <HI>the Sinning Angels.</HI> The <HI>Second</HI> is that, which befel the Apostate Old World: Notwithstanding, there was a World of them, (the Lord knows how many Thousands, how many Millions there might be) nevertheless they were all destroyed, excepting one small Fa∣mily. The <HI>Third Instance,</HI> is, that <HI>Of Sodom and Gomorrah,</HI> and those Citie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that were Condemned by an Eternal Overthrow. When they sinned against God, he punisht them with the Venge∣ance of Eternal Fire. The words at present be∣fore us, fall under the first of these Examples, namely, that <HI>Of the Angels which sinned.</HI> I have spoken many things to you concerning the Holy Angels, who never sinned against God. It may not be unsuitable to discourse something concer∣ning the <HI>Reprobate Angels,</HI> who have sinned, and are damned for it. When it is said, <HI>God spared them not,</HI> the meaning is, that he did shew them no mercy; that he made them become the Sub∣jects of his Wrathful Judgments; that he did not forgive their sin, nor did ever make an offer of mercy to them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrine</HI> therefore to be insisted on, is,
<HI>That the Holy God hath made the Angels which sin∣ned, Examples of Judgment without mercy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="000756_0122_0FAA47F064563F00"/>This <HI>Doctrine</HI> may be cleared in several <HI>Pro∣positions.</HI></P>
<P>PROPOSITION I. <HI>That although all the An∣gels were in their first Creation without sin, neverthe∣less, many of them did soon after that, Sin against the Great God their Glorious Creator.</HI></P>
<P>There are divers things contained in this <HI>Pro∣position.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That all the Angels were once without Sin.</HI> As for the Angels that sinned, there was a time▪ when <HI>They were in the Truth,</HI> as it is said of them, <HI>Job.</HI> 8.44. Their First Estate was a State of In∣tegrity. They were once adorned with the Glo∣rious Image of God: and on that account they were <HI>The Sons of God,</HI> Job 38.7. the Sons of God, in respect of their being like unto him, and made after his Image in their First Estate. They did not come sinful out of Gods Hands: that could not possibly be, for then God should be the Author of Sin, which 'tis impossible that he should, as the Apostle <HI>James</HI> proves. <HI>God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man: Every good and perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of Lights, with whom is no variableness nor shadow of turning.</HI> Jam. 1.13, 17. All good is from God, saith the Apostle: and therefore evil, moral evil, sin, cannot be from him; for then he should be variable and subject to change, as Creatures are, which the Blessed God is not: and therefore He is not the Author
<PB N="107" REF="000756_0123_0FAA47F138FF7228"/>
of sin. The Angels then that sinned, were pure and spotless, as they came out of His Hands: Those very Angels, which are now in Hell, were once in Heaven. Hence it is said, <HI>That they left their own Habitation.</HI> Jude 6. Heaven was their proper place and habitation, their Native Coun∣trey, as we may so speak. Those Apostate An∣gels who are now blaspheming in Hell, there was a time, when they were praising God in Heaven. When the Foundation of the Earth was laid, <HI>All the Sons of God sang and shouted for joy</HI>: all the Angels; those that are now Blasphe∣mers of him, were then shouting for joy, in ad∣miration at the Wisdom and Power of their Cre∣ator, whom they did then behold laying the foun∣dation of this Earth. Those Angels that are now <HI>evil,</HI> were once <HI>good,</HI> and they continued to be so for a few dayes. For on the sixth day <HI>God saw every thing that He had made, and behold it was very good.</HI> Gen. 1.31. If all the Works that God had made, were good on the sixth day after the Creation began, the Angels that have sinned, were then good.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Rebrobate Angels did not continue in their Sinless state, for any long time.</HI> For, although they were most excellent and glorious Creatures, yet they were but Creatures; and being Creatures, they were <HI>Mutable,</HI> and because mutable, there∣fore <HI>Peccable,</HI> that is, in a possibility of sinning and falling from God. Absolute immutability is a Divine Property: it cannot be affirmed of any,

but God alone. Mal. 3.6. <HI>I am the Lord, I change not.</HI> It cannot be said of any besides the Lord, that he cannot change. <HI>Austin</HI> gave a judicious Answer to that enquiry, <HI>How could Angels, that were such excellent and glorious Creatures in their first estate, not having any one to tempt them as man had, how could they sin, and loose their happiness</HI>? His An∣swer was, <HI>Non sunt Deus,</HI> They are not God: and▪ therefore were subject unto change, and in a pos∣sibility of falling from Heaven. <HI>He chargeth his Angels with folly,</HI> Job 4.18. The Angels are char∣gable with folly in this respect. It is a Scripture Expression, <HI>Wise as an Angel of God.</HI> Nevertheless▪ the wise Angels are and alwayes were the Subjects of <HI>a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mparative folly</HI>: compared with the only wise God, they are foolish things. And when once they sinned, they were to be charged with infinite folly. For them to offend and fall out with their Omnipotent Creator, and by loosing his favour to loose their own happiness, was stu∣pendous folly in the fallen Angels. As for the particular sin, which the Apostate Angels were guilty o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the Scripture is not so clear in revealing what it was; and therefore it is not for us to be positive in the determination of it. Nevertheless, it is very probable, that God might try their O∣bedience unto the Moral Law, by some positive Precept o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other. As he tryed mans Obedience by that positive Precept respecting the forbidden fruit on the Tree of knowledge of good &amp; evil: so we may conceive, that he tryed the Obedience
<PB N="109" REF="000756_0125_0FAA47F2A70C71D8"/>
of the Angels, by some positive Precept. It is also a probable conjecture, that the Lord told them (and Commanded them) that they should all be Ministring Spirits for man, and that this they would not stoop unto, man being far their inferi∣our. To be sure there was pride in the sin which the Angels became guilty of, as indeed there is in every sin. Hence it is said, that a <HI>Bishop must n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t be a novice, lest being lifted up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of the Devil.</HI> 1 Tim. 3.6. The Devil was condemned to eternal fire, because of the sin of pride. But how, and in what particular that pride discovered it self, the Scripture hath not declared unto us. This notwithstanding se∣veral things are certain from the Scripture. It is certain, that the Angels, some of them, did sin a∣gainst God: So the Apostle expresly declares here. And by the Apostle <HI>Jude,</HI> it is said, that they <HI>kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation.</HI> And hence the Scripture speaks not only concern∣ing <HI>Good Angels,</HI> but concerning <HI>Evil Spirits.</HI> We read in the Gospel of certain Women, who had been healed of <HI>Evil Spirits</HI> and infirmities. Those Spirits had possessed them and made them sick. In particular and by name <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here was <HI>Mary Magda∣len,</HI> out of whom went seven <HI>Devils.</HI> Luke. 8.2. So that there are Angels, who are called <HI>Evil Spirits</HI> and <HI>Devils.</HI> We find in the Scripture, that Christ gave his disciples <HI>power against unclean Spirits.</HI> Mat. 10.1. They are said to be unclean Spirits, not only (though partly on that account) because they
<PB N="110" REF="000756_0126_0FAA47F36D11A0D0"/>
excite wretched men unto unclean lusts, but be∣cause they themselves are defiled with sin. They are polluted, and have made themselves hateful &amp; abominable in the sight of the holy God, against whom they have sinned. And it is moreover certain, that these Apostate Angels did early cor∣rupt themselves. It was within a short time after the world began. <HI>John</HI> tells us, that <HI>the Devil sinned from the beginning,</HI> 1 Joh. 3.8. And our Saviour Christ hath told us, that <HI>the Devil is a Lyar and a Murderer from the beginning</HI>▪ Joh. 8 44. That is to say, from the first beginning of the World, or within a short time after the Creation. The <HI>Jewish Doctors</HI> (many of them) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave Conjectured that the fallen Angels sinned on <HI>the second day</HI> after the Creation began; and they suppose that to be the reason why there is no divine approbation men∣tioned concerning the work of that day, as there is of the other. But there is no solidity in that conjecture. For what is spoken <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.10. relates to the work of the second, and not of the third day only. It seems clear from the Scripture, that there was no sin in the world for six dayes after the beginning. <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.31. Nevertheless, It is evi∣dent, that the Angels fell before man did, for it was the Devil, that did tempt man to disobey the Commandment of God, which could not have been, if he had not himself sinned against God before that. It is yet further clear and evident from the Scripture, that more then a few of the Angels sinned. There were vast multitudes of
<PB N="111" REF="000756_0127_0FAA47F62CC21970"/>
them that fell down from Heaven to Hell. No doubt but one was the Ringleader in that rebellion, whom the Scripture calls by the name of, <HI>the De∣vil,</HI> and by the name of <HI>Satan,</HI> and whom the Jews were wont by way of contempt to call by the name of <HI>Belzebub</HI>: That <HI>Lucifer,</HI> (as he useth though not so properly to be called) who is be∣come the Monarch of Hell, did not fall alone, nor perish alone in his iniquity, there were migh∣ty numbers of them that did joyn with the great Devil, in the conspiracy against the most High. Hence the Scripture speaks of <HI>the Devil and His Angels,</HI> Mat. 25.41. <HI>His Angels.</HI> So that there were many of them, that were concerned in that first Transgression and Rebellion against the Lord. It is said, Ephes. 2.3. That the Devil is <HI>the Prince of the Power of the Air.</HI> So that there is a <HI>Power,</HI> an <HI>Host,</HI> a vast <HI>Army</HI> of those Evil Spirits, that did joyn with the Devil, in setting themselves against the Great God. How many, is not for us to say, the Written Word of God not speaking any thing as to the quantity of their number: only it is manifest from the Scripture, that there are far more Angels that have sinned, far more Devils then there are men in all the World. There is not a man in the whole world, but there are Devils to tempt him continually. And if so, they must needs be more in number than men are. We read in the Gospel of no less than a Legion of Devils in one poor misera∣ble man. Luk. 8.30. You read there of a posses∣ed
<PB N="112" REF="000756_0128_0FAA47F72E5B0508"/>
man, and Christ demanded of the Evil Spirit, what his name was: The chief Devil among them made answer, <HI>It is Legion, for we are many.</HI> A Legion is six thousand six hundred and sixty six. Now then, if the Devil has such vast num∣bers of Infernal Spirits under him; if he has such troops of them, as that he can spare no less than a Legion to afflict, and as it were to keep Garri∣son in one poor miserable man: what prodigious numbers of Evil Angels must there needs be.</P>
<P>Thus you have seen the <HI>first Proposition</HI> confirm∣ed? We proceed to the <HI>Second.</HI></P>
<P>PROPOSITION. II. <HI>That God hath made the Sinning Angels examples of Judgment without Mercy.</HI> Therefore it is here said, <HI>God spared them not.</HI> He never did make any one tender of Mercy to them. He did not pardon their offence, nor ever will do. The truth of this is evident from several things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In that the fallen Angels are for the present i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a miserable condition.</HI> They are now at this instan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in a state of misery. They have lost their happi∣ness for ever, and did so, from the very moment, when they first sinned against God; they were immediately excluded out of Heaven, and the e∣verlasting Gates were shut upon them. I do not say, nor do I believe, that the Angels did sin in the highest Heaven: for it is said of that Hea∣ven, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.4. That it is <HI>Undefiled</HI>: whereas if the Angels had sinned there, they would have defiled the very Heavens. But when once they sinned▪ they were banished from Heaven, and they never
<PB N="113" REF="000756_0129_0FAA47F7F8F97AD0"/>
came within the Palace of the great King any more. As soon as ever they sinned, they were cast away from the Presence of God for ever; and they are Excommunicated from the Society of those Holy Angels, that once they had an happy Fellowship with. And they are not only banished out of the Heavenly Kingdom to Eternity, being confined to the low Regions of the World; but they are m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reover become the Subjects of positive misery: Therefore are they said to be <HI>in Darkness,</HI> which notes misery, as the Apostle expresses it in this Context, they are <HI>de∣livered into Darkness.</HI> Darkness of misery is come upon them already, they being excluded from the Presence of God, in whose favour is light and life: they must needs be in darkness. And they are said to be made <HI>Prisoners,</HI> and to be <HI>Cast into Hell,</HI> and to be <HI>in Chains</HI> there: <HI>They are delivered into Chains of Darkness.</HI> Those expressi∣ons are <HI>Metaphorical,</HI> alluding to what is customa∣ry among men. A Malefactor who is a great Criminal, is committed to Prison, and is there to lye in Chains, until the <HI>Sessions</HI> comes. So hath the Great God dealt by the Angels that sinned against Him, He hath committed them to Pri∣son, and hath ordered them to lye in Chains there, until the Judgment of the Great Day shall come. They are not only under a Chain in re∣spect of the restraining Power and Providence of God, which does hamper the Evil Angels, that they cannot go where they would, nor can they
<PB N="114" REF="000756_0130_0FAA47F8DDCDCA90"/>
do many things, that fain they would do, which is a torment to them. But there is the chain of a guilty Conscience, which is a dark chain in∣deed, in respect whereof the Devils carry Hell up and down the World with them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Angels that sinned, shall ere long be in grea∣ter misery then at present they are subject unto.</HI> They are Prisoners, and have been so from the day of their fall: nevertheless, they are Prisoners at large, and the Devil hath a long chain allowed to him for the present: Therefore when it was said to him, <HI>Whence comest thou?</HI> saith he, <HI>I come from going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</HI> Job 1.7. So that he hath leave to go from one end of the earth to the other. <HI>He walks about seeking whom he may devour,</HI> 1 Pet. 5.8. For the present he is permitted to range up and down the World, to see if he can prevail over miserable Creatures, and make a prey of the precious Souls of the children of men. But there is a day a coming, when he shall be made a <HI>close Prisoner.</HI> Satan is to be cast into the Bot∣tomless Pit, and shut up there. <HI>Rev.</HI> 20.4. He cannot then wander up and down as now he doth. Although the Devils now feel something of torment in their guilty Consciences, and there are doubtless some Laws which they are under, being (as some have judiciously observed) awed by a superiour power, and which they are as much afraid of acting against, as a Malefactor is afraid of going against the Laws of men, lest h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="115" REF="000756_0131_0FAA47F97B76CF10"/>
should be scourged for his so doing: Hence the Devil, though he had a natural power to hurt <HI>Job,</HI> was afraid to do it without leave. Yet there is a time coming, that they will be in more in∣tolerable torment by far, than what they at pre∣sent indure. Hence when the Devils saw the Lord Jesus Christ approaching, they cryed out, What have we to do with thee? <HI>Art thou come to torment us before the time.</HI> Mat. 8.28. So that there is a time yet to come, wherein the Devils shall be subject unto greater torment, than as yet they are made sensible of. And that time will be at the Day of Judgment: <HI>Do ye not know, that the Saints shall Judge the World? Know ye not, that we shall judge Angels,</HI> 1 Cor. 6.2, 3. that is to say, the Angels that sinned. At the Great Day, all reprobate men, and not only so, but all the repro∣bate Angels shall be brought into Judgment, and shall then have a sentence of Eternal Condemna∣tion passed upon them. Therefore it is, that the thought of the Day of Judgment is exceeding terrible unto all the Devils in Hell; they all tremble, when ever they think of the Judgment to come. <HI>The Devils believe, that there is one God, and they tremble.</HI> Jam. 1.19. So they believe, that there is a Day of Judgment, that will be here ere long, and they tremble at the fore thought of it. We read in the Gospel of a Devil in a pos∣sessed man, who said to the Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.</HI> q. d. God has given us leave, as yet to be out of the
<PB N="116" REF="000756_0132_0FAA48005B0626E0"/>
place of Torment, where we must at last be. Therefore I adjure thee by him not to send me thither. So that the Devils have a fearful expe∣ctation of that Day of Wrath. <HI>Mar.</HI> 5.7.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The ruine of the Angels that sinned is irrecovera∣ble and eternal.</HI> Therefore is it said, that <HI>God hath not spared them,</HI> because they are without all hopes of ever being restored to their blessed State. They are cast down to Hell: they are not able to re∣cover themselves. They are fallen down so deep into that Dungeon of Darkness, which Sin hath brought them into, that they can never rise a∣gain, by any power of their own. The Chains which they are in, the mighty Devils cannot break them: and the Holy God will not recover them. He hath not seen meet to do any thing for their being recovered out of the woful mise∣ry, which they have sinned themselves into; God has not afforded any means for their Salvation▪ and therefore their ruine must needs be an Eter∣nal Ruine. The Chains which the Devils are said to be in, are called, <HI>Everlasting Chains,</HI> Jude 6. The Fire of the Wrath of God, that they are condemned to endure, is called <HI>an Everlasting Fire. Mat.</HI> 25.41. It will be said to the Wicked at the last day, <HI>Depart with the Devil and his An∣gels into Everlasting Fire.</HI> So that the Angels that sinned are condemned to Everlasting Fire. God then hath not spared them, but hath made them Examples of Justice without Mercy.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="000756_0133_0FAA4800E69CDB70"/>PROPOSITION III. <HI>That the Severity of God, manifested on the Angels that sinned, is most just and reasonable.</HI> For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Their sin was exceeding hainous.</HI> The Devils were the first that ever sinned. And God uses to leave a mark of his indignation on those that are the first Transgressors in any kind. And they sinned without a Tempter; they sinned of themselves: <HI>They left their own Habitation</HI>; left it of themselves: Their wills were deeply engaged in their sinning against God: and the more of the will there is in any sin, the more Evil is in it. They sinned, I say, and were not tempted by any one to do it: As for man, when he sin∣ned, he was tempted, beguiled and deceived by the Devil: And probably <HI>Adam</HI> knew nothing of the Fall of the Angels, but might think when the Devil spoke to him, that it was a good An∣gel, and therefore might be the more easily de∣ceived. Man thus sinning through temptation, was an object of pitty, more than the Devils, that had none to tempt them; also the Angels sinned against clear light and knowledge. Their Sin was yet further aggravated, in that God had done more for them, than for any Creature be∣sides. God had advanced them above all the Creatures in the World: Their sin therefore was e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ding hainous. Now the least sin that can be thought of, deserves Eternal Punishment: Therefore God in not sparing the Angels that sinned, is just and righteous.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="118" REF="000756_0134_0FAA4801A4DD9770"/>2. <HI>The Apostate Angels are become the most wick∣ed Creatures in all the World</HI>: They are set upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> They are called by the name of <HI>Shedim.</HI> Deut. 32.17. which signifies <HI>Wasters,</HI> or <HI>Destroy∣ers.</HI> Those hateful and rapacious Birds of Hell, are always devouring miserable Creatures. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.8. for which cause the Devil has the name of <HI>Abaddon</HI> and <HI>Apollyon</HI> given to him. <HI>Rev.</HI> 9.11. they are wicked in the highest degree: There∣fore are they called <HI>Spiritual Wickednesses,</HI> Ephes. 6.12. because they are most wicked Spirits, wic∣ked with all manner of wickedness: there is no good in them in the least. It is said of the De∣vil, <HI>that there is no truth in him.</HI> Joh. 8.44. There is no goodness in him: he hath not so much of common goodness, so much of the relicks of the Image of God, as the sinful children of men have: and therefore he doth not scruple any man∣ner of wickedness, let it be never so great. There are some very wicked men in the World, that as for some sins, they are afraid of them. Natural Conscience has that power in them, that as for some sins, they seem so atrocious and horrid, as that they are afraid to commit them. But now the Devil doth not stick at any wickedness, let it be never so great and hainous. The greater any sin is, the more pleasing it is to the Devil: He is always sinning himself, and endeavouring to make others sin to the utmost of his power. He is not only a <HI>Tempter,</HI> but <HI>the Tempter:</HI> That is his cursed Trade. Blasphemy is the greatest sin:
<PB N="119" REF="000756_0135_0FAA4802A2AC3880"/>
now that the Devil is continually guilty of. It was Satan that made <HI>Jobs</HI> Wife say, <HI>Blaspheme God and dye.</HI> And those sins which they cannot commit, because of their being spiritual natures, yet they stir up others to them: such as Drun∣kenness and Uncleanness, they stir up wicked men to live in such abominations: And all this they do out of despight against Heaven, because they know that such things do offend and grieve the blessed God. Out of their desperate hatred of the Glorious and Holy God, against whom they have sinned, they do all they can to cause His Name to be dishonoured: and therefore it is that the Devils do hate those most, that are most like to God, and who above others do Ser∣vice for His Name, the Evil Angels do in a pe∣culiar manner set themselves against, and are fil∣led with all the rage of Hell against such as those are. The Devil is full of wrath and rage, but against whom? against those especially, which <HI>Keep the Commandments of God, and the Testimony of Jesus.</HI> Rev. 12.17. against such is his malice, his wrath and rage in a peculiar manner bent. His malice is greater than his policy, though he is a great Politician. The Devil hath a great wit, he hath wonderful parts, as to understanding and memory: yet his malice is greater than his wisdom. He knows well enough he shall get no∣thing, by setting himself to do mischief to those that belong to God: He knows that he shall but hurt himself, and shall receive the great∣er
<PB N="120" REF="000756_0136_0FAA48075D260170"/>
Damnation for it at the last day. He knows this, and yet will go on, because his malice is greater than his understanding. And the Devil, and so all his Evil Angels are come to that height of wickedness, that they would not have the Blessed God to have a Church in the Earth: They would not have Christ to have a Servant in the World. If they could have their wills, the Glorious God should not be worshiped. They hate that which is good: they hate Prayer, and Preaching, and good Books, that have a tenden∣cy to promote the Salvation of the Souls of men. The Devils in a special manner hate such Books as those are: They hate this blessed Bible, more than any Book in the World: They hate the Lords day. Because of their malice against Hea∣ven, they tempt the children of men on the Sab∣bath-day, more than on any day in the week, because they know, that if men sin on the Sab∣bath-day, they will then become doubly guilty in the sight of God. The Devil is the oldest Sinner, and the most cursed Creature in all the World. It is said, Isa. 65.20. <HI>That the Sinner of an Hundred Years shall be accursed.</HI> But then what shall the Sinner be, that is more than five thou∣sand years old? The Devil and and all the An∣gels that sinned with him, are Sinners of above five thousand years old, and will therefore be∣come the most accursed and damned Creatures in the whole universe at the Great Day.</P>
<P>We now proceed to the <HI>Uses</HI> of this Doctrine.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="000756_0137_0FAA480868485508"/>And in the <HI>first</HI> place by way of <HI>Information,</HI> or <HI>Instruction</HI> in several particulars.</P>
<P>Inference 1. <HI>Here we may behold, and let it affect all our hearts, to consider the wonderful Grace of God towards fallen men, in that God hath spared them.</HI> Although he did not spare the Angels that sinned against him, he hath spared the fallen sinful chil∣dren of men, spared them from Everlasting De∣struction. He has manifested more Grace to them then he did to the Angels that sinned, for whom he did not provide a Saviour. God did not send his Son into the World to take the Nature of Angels, and unite that Nature unto his own Sacred Eternal Person. <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.16. <HI>He took not to him the nature of Angels,</HI> it is said, but that of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and so of other men. The Scrip∣ture does therefore call Redeeming Grace <HI>PHI∣LANTHROPY,</HI> or the <HI>Love of God towards man.</HI> Tit. 3.4. The Blessed Angels that never sinned, are affected with the thought of this, they do admire the Grace of God towards the fallen children of men, and they praise his Glorious Name on that account. The Angel said to the Shepherds, <HI>Behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people: for unto yon is Born a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.</HI> Luk. 2.10, 11. <HI>Unto you</HI> (says the Angel) to you sinful children of men, not to Angels that sinned, but <HI>to you men.</HI> And a multitude of Holy Angels did then praise God, saying, <HI>Glory to God in the Highest, on Earth peace, good will towards men.</HI> Now Christ is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
<PB N="122" REF="000756_0138_0FAA480920AFA918"/>
that is come to pass by which God will have glory in the highest, men will have peace and the good will of God towards the children of men is and will be manifested: This all the hosts of Heaven that worship God continually, are af∣fected with; and shall not we who are most con∣ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned, have our hearts within us moved with meditations thereon? God did not send Angels from Heaven to Preach a Jesus to the Angels that sinned, no, he never did send any such message from Heaven to them, as unto men he has. Nor did the Lord wait on the Angels that sinned, to see if they would return to him, and repent, and humble themselves before him as he has waited on men. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.20. <HI>The Long suffering of God waited in the dayes of Noah.</HI> And how long doth God wait upon many Sinners? With what pati∣ence doth God wait on them, before he casts them down to Hell; before he send them to be where the Angels that sinned now are. And when the Angels sinned <HI>but once,</HI> as soon as ever they had but once transgressed, <HI>He spared them not.</HI> But now though men have sinned a million times over, God spares them; although they continue sinning from one year to another, God not only spares them out of Hell, but tells them of a Heaven, and sends his Gospel to them, to assure them, that all their sins shall be pardoned, and their Souls saved, if they obey the Gospel: Here now is wonderful Grace, that we may be astonished to consider of. The Angels that sin∣ned,
<PB N="123" REF="000756_0139_0FAA4809EAF97ED0"/>
never had one offer of a Christ: They ne∣ver had a <HI>Jesus</HI> Preached to them as <HI>a Deliverer from the Wrath to come.</HI> God himself Preached the Gospel, and promised Salvation to fallen man, on the very day in which he first sinned. <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.15. What glorious Grace was this!</P>
<P>Inference 2. <HI>We see here a glorious evidence of the holiness and of the Justice of God.</HI> He is an Holy God, He cannot endure sin. He will not suffer sinners to be in his sight. If they be sinners, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they be Angels, if once they become sinners, out of Gods sight they must go. Such is the Holiness of Gods nature. <HI>David</HI> being a man after Gods own heart, could say, <HI>A Lyar shall not dwell in my house, nor tarry in my sight.</HI> Psal. 101.7. But Oh! the Holiness of the blessed God, that when the reprobate Angels did once become Lyars, they might not dwell in Gods house, nor tarry in his sight one moment longer. Such is his Holiness, that he cannot look upon sin with approbation of it. Hab. 1.13. <HI>He is of purer eyes, than to behold evil: he cannot look upon iniquity</HI> without detestation there∣of. 'Tis not only true that he will not, but that he cannot. God can no more approve of sin, then he can cease to be God. Thus glorious is he in Holiness And we see before our eyes a glo∣rious and dreadful demonstration of the Justice of God, in that he does punish sinners whoever they be. The truth is, He never spared any sin, there was never any sin committed in the World, nor
<PB N="124" REF="000756_0140_0FAA480AA10F39F0"/>
never shall be, but God hath punished it, or will punish it. As for the Angels that sinned, they are condemned to eternal fire and flames: not any one of them all can escape the stroke of Divine Justice. And as for reprobate men, although God bears with them a long time, and is pleased to ex∣ercise infinite Patience towards them, yet they will at last find, that all their sins shall be punish∣ed with a Vengeance, Rom. 9.22. <HI>What, if God willing to shew his wrath, and make his power known, endured with much long suffering the Vessels of wrath fitted to destruction.</HI> At last Gods wrath, his Justice will be made to appear in punishing them for all their Transgressions, Ay, and he will make known his infinite Power at the same time. The infinite Power of God is seen in making one that hath been a sinner, capable of enduring such punish∣ment. That a poor Creature should be filled with the wrath of God, and yet be capable, or in a possibility, to indure it to all eternity, this makes known his power as well as his wrath. Thus doth he shew his wrath and make his Power known. And as for the Elect of God, he hath not spared their sins, as appears in that his own Son was not spared, when he became a surety on their behalf, Rom. 8.32. <HI>God spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all.</HI> The Son of God who never sinned nor could sin, yet was not spared, when he became a Mediator undertaking to answer for sinners. That is the highest demon∣stration of the Holiness and Justice of God, that
<PB N="125" REF="000756_0141_0FAA480B83DA4460"/>
can be thought of. As some Divines have ex∣pressed it, <HI>If a man would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee the Justice of God set forth to the life, let him go to Golgotha,</HI> where Christ was crucified, and behold him on the Cross, and there hear him crying out, when bleeding and dying, <HI>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</HI> And if a man would see the Justice of God set forth to the life of it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et him go unto the Gar∣den, where Jesus Christ was in his <HI>Agony,</HI> and let him there behold the Son of God sweating drops of Blood, because of the wrath of the Father, due for the Sins of men. So that we see glorious de∣monstrations of the Justice and Holiness of God, and of his infinite hatred of Sin.</P>
<P>Inference. 3. <HI>Sin makes men to become like unto the Apostate Angels.</HI> It turns men into Devils. There are wicked men who are Devils incarnate. And therefore sinners are said to be <HI>the Children of the Devil, and to be of the Devil,</HI> 1 Joh. 3.8. Namely as Children are of their Father. He is called their Father, Joh. 8.44. <HI>Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the lusts of your Father ye will do,</HI> saith Christ: Ye do just as the Devil doth, and just as the Devil would have you do, and there∣fore ye are his Children, and he is your father. There are Children in respect of <HI>Imitation</HI>: Sinners imitate the Devil: Yea, they have his Image, the very same evil nature, the same wicked dispo∣sition and sinful inclinations which are in the heart of the Devil, are in their hearts and na∣tures.
<PB N="126" REF="000756_0142_0FAA480C2177DF00"/>
Especially, there are some sins that make men exceeding like the Devil, and his Children indeed. As now, that sin of <HI>Apostacy</HI> from good beginnings: The Devil was the first Apostate. Hence when men have begun to do well, and after that turn from the good ways of God, they make themselves like the Devil. As for the Fal∣len Angels, they have left off all Exercises of Re∣ligion and Piety. There was a time, when the Devil and his Evil Angels did pray and worship God; when they did joyn with the Holy Angels in praising the great Creator of the World. But they have left praying and praising, and forsaken the Company of Holy Angels. Ah! Lord God, are there not such in this Assembly this day! are there not such here before the Lord this day, who have manifested themselves to be the Devils Children? There was a time when they would pray, and joyn with others the Fearers of the Lord in serving him: but they have forsaken him, they serve him not, neither do they pray unto him: And they have forsaken the Commu∣nion of those Fearers of the Lord with whom they did once joyn in Religious Exercises. This is to be and to do just like the Devils: such are his Children, as like him as it is possible for Crea∣tures to be out of Hell: So <HI>Hypocrites</HI> and Dissem∣blers are like the sinful Angels. Christ said to his Disciples, <HI>Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a Devil.</HI> Joh. 6.70. That was <HI>Judas.</HI> Why was <HI>Judas</HI> a <HI>Devil?</HI> but because he was an
<PB N="127" REF="000756_0143_0FAA481044975E88"/>
<HI>Hypocrite,</HI> one that pretend to that in Religion and Devotion which was never in him; one that did seem to be an Angel of light, when he was not so; one that did betray Christ with a kiss, pretending to be his friend, when he was trea∣cherous and false to him and to his Interest. Such men there are in the world, as will out of respect to carnal ends and designs make pretenti∣ons to Religion: They are like the Devil. There is in the Field of Christ, (in his Church in the World) not only Wheat but Tares, there are not only sincere Professo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, but Hypocrites. <HI>They are the Children of the Wicked One.</HI> Mat. 13.38. and all <HI>Lyars</HI> are so. The Devil is <HI>a Lyar, and the Father of it,</HI> because he is the Father of them that are so. Lyars joyn with the Devil in sin∣ning, and as they partake with him in sinning, so shall they have the Devils punishment. What is the Devils punishment? It is an exclusion out of Heaven: And what is the punishment of all Lyars? They shall in no wise enter into the Heavenly Jerusalem. They shall ba excluded, as the Devil their Father is. What is the Devils punishment? It is said, He shall be cast into <HI>the Lake of Fire and Brimstone. Rev.</HI> 20.10. and the very same is said concerning all <HI>Lyars,</HI> that they shall have their part in <HI>the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimstone, which is the Second Death.</HI> Rev. 21.8.</P>
<P>Inference. 4. <HI>This informs us of the Evil which is in Sinning against God.</HI> We see what an evil
<PB N="128" REF="000756_0144_0FAA481175AA8A68"/>
sin is, that it is the worst of evils, and that which of all evils men have the greatest cause to dread. For it doth provoke God: Therefore it is of all evils the most formidable. It was well replied by one of the Antients, when the greatest Person in the Empire sent him a threatning message, Go (said he) carry back this answer, that <HI>I am afraid of nothing, but to sin against God.</HI> Sin is a most de∣structive evil to the Creature. No eminency or priviledge can save sinning Creatures from the strokes or Divine Justice. It brings remediless ruin on those that shall become guilty of it. Angels are eminent ones: <HI>If I speak with the tongues of Men and Angels</HI> (saith the Apostle) intimating, that Angels were of all Creatures the most excellent and glorious, and yet when they sinned, we see what became of them, of so many of them, as sinned against God. <HI>They are reserved under darkness for the Judgement of the great day.</HI> Then most certainly there is no eminency in men, that can secure them from the Vengeance of Hea∣ven, if they sin: no eminency of Power. <HI>Angels</HI> are <HI>greater in power and might</HI> than men are, yet when they sinned, they must go into Everlasting Chains. It is not any Eminency of Parts and Wisdom, that can save sinful Creatures from the killing strokes of revenging Justice. It was said of the King of <HI>Tyrus, Thou art full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty: thou hast been in Eden the Garden of God.</HI> Ezek. 28.12. For all this he must down to the pit. Wilt thou yet say before him that

Oh▪ th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n what an evil is sin! One sin hath destroyed millions of Angels in one moment: what an Evil is Sin then, do you think? One sin hath b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought Death upon the whole World of Mankind in one day, so that all mankind must have perished to Eter∣nity, if the Son of God himself had not stept in to save them. Rom. 5.12. <HI>By one man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin, and so Death pas∣sed upon all men, for that all have sinned.</HI> What a fearful poison is sin, that hath poisoned all man∣kind in one moment! <HI>Adam</HI> did no sooner eat the forbidden fruit, but he and all his posterity were poisoned to death in that very moment: such an Evil is it. And therefore if men go on sinning against God, it is in vain for them to think they shall escape the hand of that Justice which <HI>hath not spared the Angels that sinned.</HI> What∣ever man shall go on in his Trespasses, will at last find Judgment without Mercy. <HI>He that despised Moses's Law, died without mercy, of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy, that hath trodden under foot the Son of God.</HI> As for Sinners, especially under the Gospel, oh what will become of them! as the Apostle here speaks▪ if God spared not the Angels that sinned, <HI>if so,
<PB N="130" REF="000756_0146_0FAA4812EBA395C8"/>
what then?</HI> then (saith he) you may be sure, he will not spare men that shall sin, and continue in their sins▪ and least of all, men who have had the offer of the Gospel, and yet have despised it. Men that have the Word of God Preached to them, and who hear Sermons wherein Christ and Salvation by him, is offered to them, and yet for all that continue in unbelief, they sin at such a rate, as the Devils never sinned. Oh! what a Condemnation will they bring upon themselves? Judgment without Mercy, or any hope of mer∣cy; because they have sinned against the Redee∣ming Blood and Bowels of Jesus Christ the Son of God, which the Angels that sinned have not done.</P>
<P>Wherefore let me conclude with <HI>Exhorting</HI> you <HI>to get your Souls clear of the guilt of sin.</HI> They that de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire to experience the sparing, pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>doning mercy of God, are concerned to get clear of sin, that God may look on them as without sin: and who is there, whom this Word of the Lord concern∣eth not? There is not a man in the whole world whom this Word of the Lord concerneth not, for that all men have sinned. Indeed, all the Angels have not sinned; there are innumerable Holy Angels that never sinned against God; but as for men, they have all sinned. <HI>The Scripture</HI> (God in his Word) <HI>has concluded all under sin, Gal.</HI> 3.22. without excepting so much as one. <HI>The whole world is become guilty before God:</HI> And therefore all men are concerned to consider of
<PB N="131" REF="000756_0147_0FAA481439F4F5B8"/>
this. Know then, that there is a way for men, though not for Angels, to become clear of sin. If a man shall by Faith have the Blood of Christ sprinkled on his Soul, he is clear of sin: They that have that Blood sprinkled upon their Souls, are pure from sin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, although they have been guilty of never so many, and never so great sins, if the Blood of Christ is sprinkled on them, the Lord looks on them, and deals with them, as if they had never sinned against him: They are then without fault before the Throne of God. Hence <HI>David</HI> prayed, saying, <HI>Purge me with hysop, and I shall be whiter than the Snow.</HI> Psal. 51.7. <HI>David</HI> had by sin made himself blacker than Hell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, but purge me with hysop, and I shall be clean, yea, whiter than the snow. He means, let the Blood of Christ be sprinkled upon me, which was typified by the Blood sprinkle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with hysop, and then all the sins that my soul hath been polluted and made abominable by, shall be taken away, and I shall become whiter than the Snow it self. When there is true Repentance to∣ward God, and unfeigned Faith in the Lord Je∣sus Christ, his Blood is sprinkled on the Soul. You read in the Gospel of one that had been a notorious infamous Sinner, a vile creature, doubt∣less an Harlot, a Strumpet, whose wickedness was known all the Town over. <HI>Luk.</HI> 7.37. This Sinner came to the Lord Jesus Christ, and did <HI>wash his feet in her tears</HI>▪ and (saith Christ) <HI>her Sins that were many, are forgiven.</HI> Now hear the
<PB N="132" REF="000756_0148_0FAA48146C31B498"/>
Gospel. Oh! that sinners would consider of this: What your sins have been I know not: God knows, and Jesus Christ knows, what secret sins any of you have been guilty of before the Lord, he knows. It may be some of you have been guilty of secret scarlet sins, of crimson abo∣minations, that the Heavens would blush to hear of. Nevertheless, God hath sent me to Preach the Gospel to you. I say then, Go thy wayes thou sinful Creature, and by Faith in Prayer fall down before God in Jesus Christ, and with a pe∣nitent Soul wash the Feet of the Lord Jesus in thy tears: and he will wash thy Soul in His Blood. Oh! give thy self up to the Lord Jesus in a perpetual Covenant, Heart, Body and Soul, and all to be his, his only, and his for ever. Ac∣cept of him, as he is offered in the Gospel, and he will accept of thee. And then suppose thy Sins to have been never so many and great, the Lord saith unto thee, as unto that great Sinner and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Name be it spoken to thee, <HI>Thy Faith hath saved the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></P>

<P>THIS Age has abounded with <HI>Atheists,</HI> not only in Practice but in Opinion. A late Author speaks of many thou∣sands of them in one Kingdom, nay in one City in <HI>Europe. Sadducism</HI> is a degree of <HI>Atheism,</HI> and commonly ends therein. The Learn∣ed Dr. <HI>Cudworth</HI> (in his <HI>Intellectual System,</HI> p. 703.) Observes that some who object that the Age wherein we live has n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Demoniacks,</HI> or possessed persons, <HI>do from thence suspect the whole Gospel of Fabulosity or Imposture.</HI> That there are in this age <HI>Energumens,</HI> late recent Examples amongst our selves, (and more than a few of them) are an awful Conviction. Some are willing to phansy all to be a strange natural disease. <HI>Plotinus</HI> relates that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of the <HI>Heterodoxies</HI> of the old <HI>Gnosticks,</HI> was, that they <HI>supposed diseases to be Devils,</HI> and that therefore the way to cure them was not by <HI>Phy∣sick,</HI> but by words and charms. The Opinion of these men who call <HI>Devils, diseases,</HI> is not unlike that of the <HI>Gnosticks.</HI> The lamentable objects which our eyes have beheld are sufficient to Con∣vince the most <HI>obdurate Sadduces</HI> in the World, that there are Evil Angels infesting the Earth. Nor is it to be doubted but that one reason why Providence has permitted such things to be done in the midst of us, is, that so men may be left without excuse for their <HI>Atheism,</HI> if they will not believe a future state, or that there is any World

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that which is visible, when such <HI>sensible de∣monstrations</HI> thereof have been set before them.</P>
<P>It is by some supposed that there are <HI>Angelical</HI> as well as <HI>Diabolical</HI> possessions. The Jewish <HI>Rab∣bis</HI> are of Opinion that the <HI>Prophets</HI> were acted by <HI>Angels.</HI> The divine influx (they say) came by their Ministry, who ordered and disposed the word in the mouth of the Prophet according to the mind of God. It is a Celebrated saying a∣mongst them, <HI>That every Prophet received his Pro∣phesy by the Ministry of an Angel, Moses only excepted.</HI> So <HI>Maimon</HI> and other of their <HI>Masters.</HI> They sup∣pose the Reason of that expression in <HI>Judg.</HI> 5.23▪ to be because <HI>Deborah</HI> being a Prophetess spake according to Angelical Inspiration. They say that the difference between a divine and a deceit∣ful dream, is, that the former is by the hand of an Angel, the latter by the hand of an evil Spirit. So do they reconcile, <HI>Numb.</HI> 12.6. with <HI>Zach.</HI> 10.2.</P>
<P>We in <HI>New-England</HI> have lately seen not only miserable Creatures Pinched, Burnt, Wounded, Tortured by <HI>Invisible Agents,</HI> but some <HI>Ecstatical</HI> Persons, who have strongly imagined that they have been attended with <HI>Caelestial Visitants</HI> revealing secret and future things to them which if it should appear to be Diabolical Imposture, or the effect of an hurt Imagination only, or both, it may (if not timely prevented) be of dangerous Consequence to themselves and others; on which Occasion▪</P>

<P>We shall endeavour a succinct Answer to the Enquiry proposed in the <HI>Conclusions</HI> following.</P>
<P>Conclusion I. <HI>Although it must be granted, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Dayes of the Gospel, Angelical Apparitions are not so frequent as under the Old Testament, neverthe∣less; some such there have been, and still may be▪</HI> What can he say that cometh after the King?

As the New-Testament Dispensation is more spiritual, so the Ministry of Angels is less visible than in for∣mer times. There were <HI>ANGELOPHANEIAI,</HI> many <HI>Appearings of Angels,</HI> as also a frequency of Miracles, until such time as the <HI>Canon</HI> of Scripture was compleated, and the Gospel sufficiently con∣firmed; but since that, both the one and the other are in great measure ceased, yet not so ceased as at no time or on no occasion to make themselves visible. That Learned and Worthy Divine, Dr.

<HI>Owen</HI> does (according to his wonted manner) in my apprehension express himself very judici∣ously as to the Question before us, in his Exposi∣tion on <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.14. <HI>p.</HI> 148. His words are these, <HI>For as many have pretended unto Revelation by An∣gels, which have been meer delusions of Satan, or ima∣ginations of their own Brains, so to say, that God does not or may not send his Angels unto any of his Saints, to communicate his mind unto them as to some particu∣lars of their own duty according to his Word, or to shew unto them somewhat of his own approaching work, seems in my judgment to be unwarrantably to limit the Holy One of Israel. Howbeit, such things in particular are to be duely weighed with sobriety &amp; Reverence.</HI> Thus the Judicious Doctor. It is true, that the World has been imposed on by fictitious and fabulous Relations concerning the Appearances of Angels. Some Writers have made themselves very merry with a comical Sto∣ry of a Nobleman in <HI>Portugal,</HI> who falling into a melancholly despair, phansied his sins were unpar∣donable. To care him, some used this Artifice: They privately caused the Tiles to be taken off from the roof of his House, and having clothed a man in white, with a Sword in his right, and a lighted Torch in his Left-hand, at midnight he appeared to him, and bade him be chearful, for he was an happy man, and so extinguishing his Torch departed. The melancholly man overjoy∣ed with the Vision, raised his House, who congra∣tulating his felicity, he from that time grew

well, being thus relieved by an <HI>Artificial Angel.</HI> See <HI>Zacut. Tusit. p.</HI> 34. Many pretenders to a con∣versation with Angels, and to a Spirit or Gift of Prophesy, have been great cheats. Some would have us believe, the <HI>Nostradamus</HI> (who was Coun∣seller to three of the Kings of <HI>France</HI>) had <HI>An∣gelical Apparitions.</HI> There are two Learned men▪ <HI>viz. Rensardus,</HI> and <HI>Monlucius,</HI> that have written in his Defence. But others (and not upon slight grounds) reckon him an Impostor, and with a little alteration of his name, have given him the Elogy of <HI>Monstradamus.</HI> There was one that made this ingenious Distick for him.</P>
<L>Nostra damus cum verba damus, nam fallere nostrum est,</L>
<L>Et cum verba damus, nil nisi nostra damus.</L>
<P>What more frequent in times of Popery then Miracles and <HI>Apparitions of Angels?</HI> The Lives of Saints are filled with sables about these things. There were some that gained by the Fable, tho many were impoverished thereby. A place in <HI>Cornwall</HI> bears the name of St. <HI>Michael's Mount,</HI> where was a Chappel Erected, because certain Monks affirmed, that <HI>Michael</HI> the Arch angel did there appear to them. The same is pretended by the <HI>French men</HI> concerning their <HI>Michael's Mount</HI> in <HI>Normandy.</HI> The <HI>Italians</HI> also challenge the like <HI>Apparition</HI> to have been in their Hill <HI>Garganus.</HI> See <HI>Cambden's Britannia▪ p.</HI> 188. Innumerable are the Instances of this kind: It would not only fill a Volumn but be loss of time to rehearse them. Bishop <HI>Hall</HI> in his Book of the Invisible World.
<PB N="7" REF="000756_0155_0FAA481DA7A5B438"/>
Sect. 8. has mentioned some of them. The Re∣lations published by <HI>Gregorius Magnus</HI> concerning the Apparitions of Angels to Saints in those times, were either fabulous or satanical illusions. In my opinion, Mr. <HI>Isaac Ambrose</HI> has wronged his Treatise of Angels (which is otherwise a good and useful Book) by quoting so many passages out of him, which may occasion his Readers to think, that the other Historical Narrations in his Book, are of no more credit than those of <HI>Gre∣gories.</HI> These things notwithstanding, we may not run into the other extream, or conclude, that all reports concerning Appearing Angels have no reality of truth in them. <HI>Luther</HI> in his Com∣mentary on <HI>Gen.</HI> 37. and Gen. 40. declares, that he was very much moved and offended <HI>at the infinite multitude of Satanical Illusions, with which the World was horribly deceived for a long time under the Papacy</HI>; and that for his own part he did <HI>con∣stantly pray to God,</HI> that he would not reveal any thing to him by Dreams or Visions, but by his Written Word; and <HI>that He would not send An∣gels to appear to him,</HI> knowing that when he was meditating on the Scriptures, God and His Holy Angels were near to him, who could instill irra∣diations on his mind without any visible Appari∣tions. Yet, he does acknowledge that some may have that which he never did nor desired to ex∣perience. <HI>Sint dona sed quae ego nec curo nec deside∣ro,</HI> says he. And the Truth is, that Authors worthy of Credit have given us an account of
<PB N="8" REF="000756_0156_0FAA482042C7A798"/>
very remarkable and memorable Instances here∣about. The Church of <HI>Smyrna</HI> in an Epistle directed to the Church in <HI>Philomilium,</HI> say, that it was revealed to <HI>Polycarp</HI> their Pastor by a Dream, that he should be burnt alive for the Name of Christ, that when he came to Dye, he gave thanks to God, not only for honouring him with such a Death, but in that he had been pleased before it came to pass to reveal unto him that he should Dye in that manner. They also say, that when he was brought before the <HI>Procon∣sul</HI> to be tryed for his Life, there was a voice heard from Heaven saying, <HI>ISKVE POLUKARPE KA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ANDRIZOU, Polycarp be of good courage, and play the man now.</HI> What could this be other than the voice of an Angel, which the Christians who were Members of that Church say that they did themselves many of them hear it. <HI>v.

The young man that appeared to <HI>Babi∣las,</HI> when he was tortured with an Engine for several hours, pouring cold water on him, which did wonderfully refresh him, (none but himself seeing the young man) must needs be an Angel. The like is reported concerning <HI>Theodorus,</HI> who was put to the torture in the dayes of <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate. What shall we think of that which our <HI>English</HI> Historines relate concerning K. <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the Confessor, that when he was sick of the sickdess of which he Dyed, after he had remain∣ed speechless two dayes, lying for a time in a slumber, there appeared two persons standing by

Instances of this nature of a far later date may be produced. In Queen <HI>Maries</HI> time, Mr. <HI>Robert Samuel,</HI> a faithful Minister of Christ, was by Bloody <HI>Bonner,</HI> then the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> cast into Prison, where he endured grievous hard∣ships, being allowed but three mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>els of Bread and three spoonfuls of water in a day, but falling asleep, one seemed to stand before him clad in a white Garment, saying to him, <HI>Be o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good cheer, for after this day thou shalt hunger and thirst no more,</HI> which accordingly came to pass, for the next day he ascended to Heaven in a Fiery Chariot. It is related concerning one Mr. <HI>Laremouth,</HI> who was Chaplain to the Lady <HI>Ann</HI> of <HI>Cleve,</HI> that being on account of the Gospel Committed to Prison,
<PB N="10" REF="000756_0158_0FAA4821E85CFA30"/>
he heard a voice, saying, <HI>Arise and go thy way</HI>▪ To which he gave no heed the first time, until he heard the same words again, upon which he went to Prayer, half an hour after which he heard the same voice again, immediately upon which part of the Prison Wall fell down, so that he went out at the breach, and meeting with a Beggar, changed his coat with him, and coming to the Sea found a Vessel ready to Sail, by which means he escaped the hands of his Persecutors. In the year 1629. one <HI>Adam Po,</HI> a <HI>Silesian</HI> in the City of <HI>Sprottavia,</HI> had his nerves and sinews so shrunk, that he could make no use of his legs, but for half a year together was confined to his Bed.

In <HI>April</HI> 1659. <HI>Samuel Wallis</HI> of <HI>Stamford</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> having been sick thirteen years, and given over by the Physitians, a person having a venerable Counte∣nance came to him on a Lord's Day (he not being able to attend the Publick Worship of God,
<PB N="11" REF="000756_0159_0FAA4822A74B6AF0"/>
spent his time at home as religiously as he could) told him the power of God would restore him to health and strength again, charging him above all things to fear God and serve him: directed him to no other means for his health, besides the use of <HI>Blood wort</HI> and <HI>Red Sage,</HI> steeped in small Beer. The report of this famous oure being noised abroad, several Ministers met at <HI>Stamford</HI> to consider and consult about it, and concluded, that it was effected by the Ministry of a good Angel. But of this I have given a more large account in my Remarkable Providences p. 205. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There is in Mr. <HI>Glanvils</HI> Collections <HI>p.</HI> 208. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a Relation like unto these two last mentioned. No longer since then <HI>October</HI> 1676. a woman in <HI>Am∣sterdam,</HI> whose name was <HI>Jesch Claes,</HI> having been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame fourteen years, one of her Legs being dead, there appeared to her a beautiful youth in white Garments, telling her, her Malady should leave her, and she should be made again to walk▪ Two dayes after which she heard a voice saying, <HI>It is given you to walk.</HI> Immediately upon which she went to the door, her Husband meeting her was affrighted, supposing he had seen a spirit; drew back from he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and could not believe that it was his Wife, until his daughter testifyed, that is was her Mother, &amp; that she had seen her walk before he came in. <HI>Fr. van Helmont</HI> being of a <HI>genius</HI> not apt to believe such things, made enquiry into the truth of this Relation, and found it to be really so. <HI>Limbergius</HI> in a Letter to Dr. <HI>More</HI> sayes, that this
<PB N="12" REF="000756_0160_0FAA4823695B0558"/>
person was reputed a very good Woman, &amp; that he believed there was no fraud at all in the mat∣ter. This Apparition then must needs be either of a good or of an evil Angel. I see no reason to ascribe it to the latter. To proceed. <HI>Amyraldus</HI> relates a remarkable passage concerning the Chan∣celler of <HI>Navar,</HI> which he had from <HI>Cameron,</HI> who received it from the Chancellers own mouth. He being in a Town belonging to <HI>Bern,</HI> one night as he was a sleep, heard a voice calling him by his name <HI>Calignon,</HI> whereupon awaking, he soon fell asleep again: a little while after, he heard the same voice, calling to him a second time, which made a greater impression on him, yet fell asleep again. The voice awakened him the third time, then advising him to retire speedily out of the Town, saying, that within a few days the Plague would be there and rage dreadfully: He follow∣ed the advice given him, whereby himself and Family were delivered; for within few dayes the Plague began, and a great part of the Town was swept away thereby: <HI>Amyrald</HI> concludes that this voce was from a good Angel. A decad of Years are not past, since invisible <HI>Psalmodists</HI> have been heard Singing in the Air, and making most har∣monious and ravishing melody there, as has been affirmed by not a few witnesses, of which M. <HI>Jurieu</HI> in his Pastoral Letters has given a well at∣tested account to the World: What ever those voices might be, they put me in mind of the <HI>Tar∣gumists</HI> Exposition of <HI>the still voice,</HI> 1 King. 19.12.
<PB N="13" REF="000756_0161_0FAA482423D77210"/>
<HI>viz.</HI> that it was <HI>the voice of Angels, Praising God in a gentle Harmony.</HI> I have else-where (in my <HI>Discourse</HI> about <HI>the Prevalency of Prayer,</HI> p. 16, 17.) mentioned a memorable passage concerning Mr. <HI>Patrick Simpson,</HI> an Eminent Minister at <HI>Sterling</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> unto whom, after he had spent a day alone in Prayer with Fasting, Angels came, and gave him an answer concerning the thing which he had all the day been praying about, of which he never spoke one word to any one, excepting only to one person, who hapned to over-hear something, whom he solemnly obtested, not to say ought of it, until after his Death, thus ex∣pressing himself, <HI>What am I dust and ashes, that the Holy Ministring Spirits should be sent by the Lord to deliver a Message to me.</HI></P>
<P>All these things considered, I conclude, that it is not impossible, but that Holy Angels may ap∣pear to some persons. And in case it should be really so, it would be a daring and dangerous boldness to entertain them with contempt. We should rather say as the Pharisees (who in that had the truth on their side) <HI>Act.</HI> 23.9. <HI>If a Spi∣rit or an Angel has spoken to him, let us not fight a∣gainst God.</HI> If this be taken with what follows, our having conceded thus far will do us no harm.</P>
<P>Conclusion II. <HI>Some Circumstances attending ex∣traordinary Apparitions pretended to be Angelical, have demonstrated them to be Diabolical, others have ren∣dred them justly suspicious.</HI> Let the Appearing Spi∣rits
<PB N="14" REF="000756_0162_0FAA4824F0342DF0"/>
pretend never so much to be good Angels; if they suggest any thing which is contrary to right reason, or the light of nature, they are cer∣tainly Devils. Hence <HI>Mahomet's</HI> Angel, from whom he pretended to receive his new Religion was a Devil: For in the <HI>Alcoron</HI> there are contra∣dictions, and therefore falshoods which cannot proceed from a good Spirit: No good Angel e∣ver told a lye. Hence that Spirit which shall be once found in a Lye, comes not from Heaven. If he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> say, such a thing shall happen, which yet does not come to pass at the time prefixed, or that he will do or not do such a thing, and yet shall act contrary, or shall in any thing falsify, to be sure that is no good Angel. Or, if it does perswade to any dishonest thing, it is an Evil Spirit. By this it was manifest, that the Spirits which Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> and <HI>Killet</HI> were so familiar with, supposing them to be good Angels, were unclean Devils: for although those Spirits did for a long time pretend to great Sanctity, they did at last advise to filthy <HI>Nicolaitism.</HI> Or, if the seeming Angels shall endeavour to establish any notions in Religion not grounded on the Scripture, they are not from Heaven. This sheweth, that the Apparitions so frequent and so much boasted of amongst the Papists, were in truth Diabolical Il∣lusions: For the design of them was to confirm the notion of Purgatory, the worshiping of Ima∣ges, praying for the Dead, and such like Doct∣rines, which the Scripture condemns: Spirits pre∣tending
<PB N="15" REF="000756_0163_0FAA4825C28BBFA8"/>
to be Angels, made way for the grossest Idolatries, by exhorting men unto a sinful venera∣tion of the Cross, the Relicks of Martyrs, and the like Superstitions. Or, if they shall speak a∣ny thing which is not grave and weighty, it is easy to judge what Spirits they are. It is beneath the majesty of an Angel to speak or do any thing which is trivial, mean, or little. Or, if they shall interrupt or divert the persons unto whom they appear, from a due attendance to the Publick Wor∣ship of God: Such things as these are infallible demonstrations, that the Appearing Angels are E∣vil Ones. There are other things which render the case very suspicious: To instance. If the Apparitions are frequent, and the Spirits that come▪ use familiar converse, it is much to be fea∣red, that they are not from Heaven, but from Hell. For if we search the Scriptures, we shall find, that when Holy Angels appeared, they soon delivered the Message which they were sent a∣bout, and then disappeared, and came no more. The same Angel seldome came more than two or three times (most commonly but once) to the same person. Twice did the Angel appear to <HI>Manoah's</HI> Wife, <HI>but the Angel of the Lord did no more appear to</HI> Manoah, <HI>and to his Wife.</HI> Judg. 13.21. When therefore Angels shall be daily Visitants▪ and continue so to be from one week, and from one month to another, the persons concerned have just cause to suspect, that they are imposed on by deceitful <HI>Daemons,</HI> pretending to be Angels of
<PB N="16" REF="000756_0164_0FAA4826666744B0"/>
light. Where is there an instance in all the Bible of a good Angel that became a Familiar to any man or wo∣man? Again, if what the Spirits reveal, does admit of a double &amp; doubtful interpretation, it is a sign, that they are Spirits of the same nature with those that spoke in the Oracle at <HI>Delphos</HI> of old This amongst other things gave just ground to suspect, that the pious young Woman <HI>Christina Poniatovia</HI> (of whom we shall have Occasion to speak more afterwards) was deluded by Satan, when she thought her self favoured with Angelical and Divine Revelations. The Spirit told her, that King <HI>F.</HI> should be exalted, and <HI>F.</HI> be made low. But he would not tell, who was meant by <HI>F.</HI> whether King <HI>Frederic</HI> or <HI>Ferdinand.</HI> What was this better then, <HI>Ajo te Aeacidae Romanos vincere posse?</HI> or then, <HI>Ibis, redibis, nunquam, per bella peribis.</HI> Good Angels do not hide themselves in the dark under ambiguities, but declare their messages clearly. If therefore the Spirits that appear under the notion of Angels from Heaven, shall leave those that de∣sire a Resolution of their doubts from them, just as wise as they found them, it is much to be doubted that they are deceiving Spirits. Again, <HI>Ecstasies</HI> attended with abreptions of mind, give just cause to suspect the Appari∣tions and Revelations. The followers of <HI>Montanus,</HI> pre∣tended to prophesy, but when the spirit of Prophesy came upon ehem they would be in <HI>Ecstasies.</HI> Now both <HI>Jerom</HI> and <HI>Chrysostom</HI> mention that as a sign of their being no Prophets divinely inspired. It is (says <HI>Chrysostom</HI>) the property of a <HI>Diviner</HI> to be <HI>Ecstatical,</HI> but its otherwise with a true Prophet, his understanding is awake and his mind in a sober orderly Temper. No doubt but that some of rhe false Prophets amongst the Jews were impos∣ed on by <HI>Daemons.</HI> They thought that they had Angeli∣cal or Divine Revelations, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 22.24. <HI>Jer.</HI> 29.8. The Hebrew Doctors say, it is a profound Question, <HI>How the true Spirit of Prophesy may be certainly known from
<PB N="17" REF="000756_0165_0FAA48276CDC0A10"/>
that which is false</HI>? Nor do they give any satisfactory Resolution concerning it: only they say, that all Prophe∣sy makes it self known to the Prophet by the strength &amp; vigour of the perception. And that false Prophesy do's proceed from the too great force of the Imaginative power, and the Imbecillity of the rational. The Pro∣phetical Spirit does never alienate the mind, since it seats it self in the rational as well as in the sensitive power. Again, If these <HI>White Angels</HI> appear to Females only, who are the weaker Sex, and more easy to be imposed on, that renders the case yet the more suspicious. It was part of the Devils subtilty in the first Temptation, which he assaulted mankind with, that he began▪ with the Wo∣man; and he hath found such success, as to hold on in the same course. How many Women have been fa∣mous in some former dark Ages on account of pretend∣ed Angelical Apparitions and Revelations? There was S. <HI>Hildegardis,</HI> with whose Revelations as wise a man as <HI>Bernard</HI> was deceived. There was <HI>Lutgardis,</HI> whose many Apparitions and Revelations are Commemorated by <HI>Surius.</HI> There was <HI>Christina</HI> Sirnamed <HI>Admirabilis,</HI> of whom <HI>Ferrarirus</HI> has written. There were St. <HI>Bridget, Elizabetha</HI> (a Q of <HI>Hungary) Liduina, Catharina, Raco∣nissa, Agnes, Politiana,</HI> and I know not how many more such, of whose converses with Angels, <HI>Possevinus, Sandeus, Delrio,</HI> and other such Authors have Published strange things▪ If ever an Age for Angelical Apparitions shall come, no question but men, and not women only, will be honoured with their Vis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s▪ of which I hear little or nothing at present. And this shall bring us to the last particular, which giveth ground of suspicion, that the per∣sons who suppose themselves to be attended with Angeli∣cal Apparitions, are only so imaginarily, or imposed on with Diabolical illusions, so. <HI>if they be diseased Persons.</HI> If they have been lately sick, and the disease wherewith they have been attended, has had any influence on the

brain, that &amp; Satan together will make them phansy very wonderful matters Dr <HI>Casaubon</HI> in his Treatise of <HI>En∣thusiasme as an effect of nature,</HI> (which Sir <HI>Will Temple</HI> in his Miscellanies <HI>p.</HI> 308. is pleased to call a <HI>Curious and Ʋseful Treatise</HI>) has some memorable Instances to con∣firm this <HI>p.</HI> 73. He sayes that in <HI>September</HI> 1655. there was in the Parish where he then dwelt, one <HI>John Carpen∣ter,</HI> who related to him what Visions and Raptures he had experienced the night before: how he had been car∣ried to hell, and what fearful things he had seen there; and also to Heaven, and what glorious things he had seen there. He was in transports of joy, not doubting but that thousands would be Converted by his Revelations. Nor could he bear it, that any should call his Revelations into question, which he was certain (as he thought) that they were of Divine Inspiration. But within a while all appeared to be the effect of a natural disease. That Learned man observes that some persons in the World by reason of an <HI>Ʋnaccountable Epileptic humour,</HI> have been strangely disposed to <HI>Enthusiastical</HI> raptures &amp; phancies. <HI>Paulus Eberus</HI> (a Lutheran Divine of great fame in <HI>Mis∣nia</HI>) writes of a Maid in <HI>Friburg,</HI> who had strange Ec∣stasies &amp; Visions. After her fits she was full of Religi∣ous Discourse, so that she was generally thought to be inspired, and her Speeches were Printed under the name of Divine Prophesies &amp; Warnings: but <HI>Eberus</HI> was much against the Publication of them, judging her <HI>Ecstasies</HI> to be a more gentle kind of <HI>Epilepsy,</HI> &amp; that her pious dis∣courses were a natural effect of her Religious Education, frequent hearing the Word, and having used her self to the exercises of Godlines<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Joh. Coboldus</HI> (a Learned Phy∣sician giveth an account concerning a Youth in <HI>Alterburg</HI> (a Town in <HI>Germany</HI>) whom his Master upon some great provocation did with his fists beat about his head unmercifully. The Lad fell sick of an <HI>Epilepsy,</HI> whereof he had diverse terrible fits, and was twelve dayes speech∣less.
<PB N="19" REF="000756_0167_0FAA482A73E7CBC8"/>
But then instead of them he had <HI>Ecstasies,</HI> in which he would continue without sence or motion for some houres. As soon as he was out of a fit, he would sing Hymns (though it was not known that he had learned any) very melodiously. When he had left singing, and was come to himself again, he would with much confi∣dence maintain, that Angels had carried his Soul to Hea∣ven, where he had seen things that he could not express. And when he perceived the fit was coming upon him, he would say, <HI>Now the Angels are come to carry me away.</HI> Ne∣vertheless, not a good Angel, but Satan was in all this. Persons attended with such fits are many times of a Me∣lancholy temper. And it is wonderful to see what power imagination has in them that are distempered with Me∣lancholy, in which doubtless evil Angels have a great o∣peration, that humour being <HI>Baelneum diaboli,</HI> a water which the Devils love to be dabling in. A certain man in this Country fourteen years ago, came to me in great horror &amp; amazement, declaring that as he was walking in the Woods, he heard a voice say to him, <HI>Sword, Fa∣mine and Pestilence beginning at</HI> New-England <HI>will make the Earth desolate.</HI> I laboured to perswade him, that it was only a phansy, and that he did not really hear any such words spoken: he told me, he was as certain of it, as he was sure that he was then speaking to me, and that they did at the Time when he heard them, <HI>put him into a Trembling fit,</HI> and that he came to me, because the first means of good to his Soul (as he said) was a Sermon which diverse years before that he had heard me Preach in <HI>Boston,</HI> &amp; because he thought I would use my best en∣deavours to prevent those evils, which it was revealed to him that without Repentance intervening they would short∣ly come to pass. The man then lived above an hundred Miles from <HI>Boston.</HI> What is since come of him, I know not.

Men that are <HI>Caetera sani,</HI> in all other things well, and as rational as any men in the world, yet in some one thing are really distracted by reason of their being under the power of a Melancholy humour. And what will they not then phansy? Examples con∣firming this may be seen in <HI>Fienus</HI> his discourse concerning the power of Imagination, &amp; in <HI>Lau∣rentius,</HI> and <HI>Sennertus,</HI> and in <HI>Burton's</HI> Melancholy: some of which are related by <HI>Wanley</HI> in his won∣ders of the little World. <HI>Book</HI> 2. <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. That of the noble <HI>Argive</HI> is an old story mentioned by the Poets,—<HI>fait haud ignobilis Argis,</HI> who strongly phan∣sied, that he saw <HI>Theaetrical delights:</HI> but when by the care of his friends he was cured of his disease, he complained, that they had wronged him by robbing him of the pleasure, which he had in that sweet error of his mind. This man recovered by the helps of Art.</P>

<P>But a more tragical and amazing Instance to the purpose in hand is related by <HI>Acosta (de tem∣poribus novissimis. lib.</HI> 2. c. 11.) concerning a very
<PB N="21" REF="000756_0169_0FAA482BA768D248"/>
Learned man in the Kingdom of <HI>Peru,</HI> in his time the Oracle of that part of the World. But a cer∣tain <HI>Muliercula</HI> (as <HI>Acosta's</HI> phrase is) there, pre∣tending to a conversation with Angels who did frequently visit her, and in her extasies would in∣form her of some secret things relating to this person, and told her of great future matters, in which he was to be concerned; he was so be∣witched as to believe all that she said; and at last fancied, that an Angel came to himself also, of whom he learned whatsoever he desired. It was revealed to him, that he should be a King and a Pope too; and that the <HI>Apostolical See</HI> should be translated to <HI>America,</HI> and that he should be con∣stituted <HI>a new Law-giver</HI> to mankind, with other things more insolent than these mentioned, which I forbear to relate, for they would grate upon pi∣ous and tender Ears. This man was in all other things sober and rational: When he was brought upon his Trial, he did plead his cause before the Judges with that liberty and eloquence, that was to their and all mens admiration: Only he won∣dred, that they did not believe his <HI>Revelations'</HI>: He was condemned to be bur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to Death. It seems the Angel that appeared to him, assured him, that when he came to the place intended for his Execution, fire would come down from Heaven, and consume his Adversaries, whereby he should be delivered: but he found to his cost, that lying Apparitions had deceived and ruined him. Whether his Judges would not have done
<PB N="22" REF="000756_0170_0FAA482C71C31320"/>
better to have sent him to <HI>Bedlam,</HI> and to have administred <HI>Hellebore</HI> rather than Fire as a more proper Remedy for his <HI>sober distraction,</HI> is not my work at present to dispute. To proceed. It seems <HI>Jerom</HI> had visions of Spirits and sometimes of Angels as he thought. One of which did se∣verely chastize him for his delighting to read <HI>Ci∣cero's</HI> Works: but another Angel interceded for mercy to him considering his youth. Now what can we impute this to, but melancholly, and the distempered imagination of a contemplative man that was always in his cell. The like I suppose concerning a later <HI>Hierom,</HI> viz. <HI>Savanarola,</HI> whom the Papists burnt to Death at <HI>Florence,</HI> in the year 1498. for his freedom and faithfulness in testify∣ing against some of the evils of those times: Se∣veral of his Books discover him to be a man of great Learning; and some of them manifest a pious Spirit. <HI>Gesner</HI> saith of his Books <HI>concerning the simplicity of a Christian Life,</HI> that they are wor∣thy to be read of every Christian man. But he has a little Book <HI>of Prophecies and Revelations,</HI> in which there are things vertiginous and fantastical. The same with this may justly be concluded con∣cerning diverse <HI>Modern Prophets,</HI> who were persons piously inclined, but Satan by reason of their Me∣lancholy tempers had a great advantage over them. This is the most favourable construction that we can make of <HI>Drabiciu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s</HI> being so imposed on by pretended <HI>Revelations,</HI> of which we shall under our next Conclusion speak more. <HI>Zeiglerus</HI> is an other
<PB N="23" REF="000756_0171_0FAA482D45ED3640"/>
famous Instance, who was by some cried up for a person divinely inspired. A strange <HI>Impetus</HI> com∣ing upon him at <HI>Frankfort,</HI> he threw down the Emperors Arms, upon which the Magistrates of the City sent him to the Hospital, supposing (as well they might) that he was out of his wits. It was revealed to him that <HI>Rome</HI> would be destroy∣ed in the year 1627: That <HI>Frederic</HI> the K. of <HI>Bo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emia,</HI> should become a King over thirteen King∣doms: That the Jews being converted, one of them should be an universal Monarch over all the World: That a general Council should meet at <HI>Constance,</HI> and continue sitting twelve years. It was also revealed to him, that he should go over into <HI>England,</HI> and as being sent from God require King <HI>James. I.</HI> to assist the Protestant Churches a∣broad. In obedience to his divine Mission he came into <HI>Holland,</HI> but before he could reach <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> he heard of K. <HI>James's</HI> death. Yet this <HI>Ze∣igler</HI> was <HI>Caetera vir probus et non indoctus,</HI> as <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tius</HI> (in his <HI>Disput de Prophetia</HI> p. 1080.) does acknow∣ledge, &amp; does therefo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e ascribe these extravagant Phansies and Revelations to the power of Melan∣choly, with something of a crazed intellect. I omit to speak of that Phantastical Monk <HI>Campanel∣la,</HI> who in his <HI>Metaphysics</HI> writes, that the Devil once appeared to him, and held a disputation with him. And (<HI>de sensu rerum &amp; Magia</HI> l. 3. cap. 10.) he says, that when ever any danger did attend him, he heard a voice in the Air calling to him by his name, which he believed was an Angel, or such

a good <HI>Genius</HI> as did attend <HI>Socrates.</HI> It is a dreadful thing, when men &amp; women are given up to Spiritual Possessions by evil Angels acting in their minds, and a great mercy to be kept there-from.</P>
<P>Conclusion III. <HI>Men ought to be very cautious of admit∣ting or hearkning unto pretended Angelical Revelations.</HI> We have an awful Instance in the Scripture, of a good man, and a Minister of God also, who was drawn into a snare to the Loosing of his Life by hearkening to, and being deluded by pretended Angelical Revelations. 2 <HI>King.</HI> 13▪ 18, 21, 22. If the circumstances attending them do not at present manifest of what nature they are, we ought to wait, until God and time shall make a discovery. Yea, though the person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> concerned in them should be of pious inclinations, and the messages brought to them should seem to be from Heaven, it is a duty rather to suspend a Judgment in the case, than to give any credit thereunto. And this for several reasons.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Because the Written Word of God is sufficient to di∣rect us in all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ases.</HI> If we do but rightly understand what is contained therein, we know enough. <HI>The man of God may be perfest and throughly furnished to all good works by the Scripture.</HI> 2 Tim. 3.17. It was for this reason that <HI>Luther</HI> never desired Visions or Angelical Apparitions. <HI>Pactus sum cum domino, ne vel visiones, vel etiam Angelos mihi mittat.

the Reformation the Devil has play'd the old game over again. <HI>Balduinus</HI> speaks of them in his time, who from the visions and conferences which they had with Angels, predicted mutations and eversions of several States and Kingdoms, and that the destruction of Antichrist, and the <HI>seculum spiritus sansti</HI> was then at hand.

But it is awful to consider that persons truly pious have been thus deceived by the old Serpent. He that crept into Paradise, will creep into Churches. <HI>Tertullian</HI> in his Book <HI>De Anima (p. mihi.</HI> 265) which was written before his lapse into <HI>Monta∣nism,</HI> relates, <Q>That there was in the Church unto which he did officiate, a <HI>Soror,</HI> who had the Gift of Revelati∣ons; That in the Church whilst they were solemniz∣ing the Worship of God, she would be in Extasies, <HI>et conversatur cum Angelis,</HI> she had conferences with An∣gels.

selves into Angels of Light. But I have not met with any Examples more astonishing than some that have hapned in our dayes. I pretermit the Revelations which some amongst the persecuted Protestants in <HI>France</HI> have lately been attended with, because I do not understand what those things are come to, so that whether they are <HI>Angelical</HI> or <HI>Diabolical, sub judice lis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st,</HI> is as yet unde∣termined.

Their feeling something come from their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eet to their throat before the fit takes them. One of them had his Leg broke by the Spirit which acted him, of which he felt nothing, till out of his fit. These things seem not to be the work of Holy Angels: Time will discover what they are▪ But amongst them of the Reformed and Persecuted Religion in <HI>Bohemia</HI> and <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> there have lately been no less than sixteen persons who have had <HI>Visions</HI> and <HI>Revelations.</HI> See the <HI>General Table of Europe.</HI> p. 205, 206. I shall here take notice of only two of them who have made a great noise in the World, and of whom <HI>Commenius</HI> has published a large and true account. One is <HI>Nicholas Drabicius,</HI> a Prote∣stant Minister of <HI>Moravia.

him. For <HI>Felinus</HI> the Pastor of the Church of Exiles in <HI>Puchow</HI> wrote a Book, endeavouring to prove that the Visions of <HI>Drabicius</HI> were an <HI>Ignis fatuus,</HI> no better than Satanical Delusions, and that therefore the Protestant Churches should be careful how they gave any heed to them. Hereupon <HI>Drabicius</HI> had a Revelation, that that Pastor should speedily dye. Now this sign came to pass; that Pastor dyed suddenly, and so did one <HI>Effron, Sapo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and other of his Adversaries, and afterwards <HI>Paul Lau∣rin</HI> a Minister that was young in years, and of a strong constitution of Body, which induced many to believe, that <HI>Drabicius</HI> was a real Prophet. Tho' had they con∣sidered <HI>Deut.</HI> 13.1, 2. they would not have taken such accidents for an infallible demonstration of a Prophet sent from God. <HI>Veterinus,</HI> another of the Reformed Pa∣stors was much dissatisfyed about <HI>Drabicius</HI>'s Visions, as <HI>Felinus</HI> had been: Nor did any Judgment overtake him, notwithstanding he persisted in his opposition to them. It was therefore thought necessary, that <HI>Drabicius</HI> should by an <HI>Oath and Execration</HI> clear himself from all suspici∣on of forgery in his p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended Revelations, which he did readily comply with, saying, there was no need for him to deliberate about it. The Oath was most solemnly administred to him, in the presence of nine or ten Mini∣sters, of whom <HI>Veterinus</HI> was one. Considering how fearfully he did in that Oath imprecate himself, they trem∣bled, and some of them we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t when the Oath was admi∣nistred to him: And so did he himself, when he came to that pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge in the Oath, wherein there is an imprecation against his Adversaries; but as to the Execrations on himself in case he had feigned any thing, he did pronounce them with a chearful countenance. Looking forth at the Window which was at that time open, he said, <HI>Do you not see, Friends, Do you not see!</HI> They being astonish∣ed, did not then ask him what he saw, but afterwards he

told one of the Ministers that enquired of him concern∣ing it, that <HI>He saw Angels.</HI> It would be too uncharitable for us to think, that <HI>Drabicius</HI> who suffered Persecution for the Gospels sake, and who was esteemed a pious well-meaning man, did counterfeit Visions and Reve∣lations. And yet it is now evident, that he was deceiv∣ed, and that he did very sinfully give way to <HI>Satanical Illusions,</HI> supposing them to be Divine Revelations. He declared that he was commanded to publish his Revela∣tions <HI>to all the Nations on the Earth, as the last will of God,</HI> which is contrary to <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.18, 19 some of the things which were revealed to him, were lies which never were, nor ever will be true. Yet he protested and swore, that although Angels appeared to him, his Revelations were from Christ Himself, who once shewed his hand pierced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrough with a nail, and made him to see both the Tor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents of the Damned in Hell, and the Joyes of the Elect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Heaven. He promised great Victories to Prince <HI>Ra∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tzi,</HI> and would have had the Princess been at the char∣ges of Printing some Books which he pretended a Com∣mand from Heaven that it should be done. But when his demands were not complied with, the mother with the father, the Son and the Uncle in that great Family being all taken away by death, he said the reason thereof was, because they had not complied with what he (as being sent from God) required them to do. These things are to be seen in his Protestation and Prayer writ∣ten <HI>July</HI> 5 1664 Twenty years before that, <HI>viz. April</HI> 12. 1644. it was revealed to him that the Lord was a∣bout so do to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> as he did to the House of <HI>Ahab,</HI> and to his Counsellers and Prophets as <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ias</HI> did to the <HI>Baalites.</HI> That the tenth Emperour of the House of <HI>Austria</HI> should be the last, whereas the pre∣sent <HI>Leopoldus</HI> who has been Reigning above thirty years, is the eleventh.

In reading the Narrative emi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ted by <HI>Commenius</HI> relating to this <HI>Drabicius,</HI> I could not but take notice of one vanity in him, which I am unwil∣ling to pass by without a Remark, <HI>viz.</HI> that he would snatch up the Bible, resolving that the first place which he light upon, should be the answer to his doubt. Thus to make a <HI>Fortune-Book</HI> of the Blessed Bible, is a very un∣warrantable Custome, however practised by many. It is indeed a paganish custome: The Heathen did in that way use Divinations. When <HI>Septimius Severus</HI> was in doubt concerning his obtaining the Empire, he would know his Fortune by trying what verse in <HI>Virgil</HI> he should first light upon, which hapned to be that in <HI>Aenead.</HI> 6. <HI>Tu regere imperio populos Romane memento.</HI> Such persons imitate that sort of Witchcraft which of old was known by the name of <HI>Sortilegium,</HI> more than becomes Christians to do.

A warning to all persons hereafter to take he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, how they believe Visions and Apparitions. I shall mention but one Instance more here, which likewise happened in our dayes. There was <HI>Christina Peniatovia,</HI> she was the pious Daughter of a pious Minister, who was of a noble Family in <HI>Prussia.</HI> This her Father was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and judicious Divine, and a great opposer of Revelations and Visions, who when he understood, that his Daughter pretended to them, he did with great solemnity and seve∣rity, lay obtesta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions on her, that she should not regard them. Nevertheless, he himself did at last think, that they were Angelical and Divine. Those super-eminent Di∣vines, <HI>Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius</HI> and <HI>Die<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> and other learned men in <HI>Ge∣neva</HI> had a favourable opinion of them. <HI>Commenius</HI> who was her Tutor and Spiritual Father, has related such things of her as are marvellous and unaccountable. Once when an aged Minister came to visit and comfort her being sick, as soon as he was gone she said to her Tutor, <HI>That good old man little thinks that he must be the first of all the Pastors that shall go into the Eternal Country.</HI> Her Tutor asked her, how she knew that. To whom she
<PB N="33" REF="000756_0181_0FAA484B35EDF820"/>
replied, <HI>I was with the Lord, and I saw the Pastors that live here coming one after another, of whom he was the first.</HI> She likewise told him, that she saw <HI>Stadius</HI> who was a young and a strong healthy man, come after him: And that because she did not see <HI>Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nius</HI> with them, she asked the reason. It was told her, that God had work for him to do on the Earth, and therefore he must not go to Heaven as yet. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se things happened accor∣dingly. That Pastor dyed first, and then the rest; and <HI>Stadius</HI> when he was but in the fortieth year of his Age. But <HI>Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nius</HI> lived above fourty years after. An Angel appeared to her, and told her she should speedily dy of an <HI>Apoplexy:</HI> She was that night smi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten with that disease. She made her will, and took her leave of all her friends: was for some time thought to be really dead: there was no breath perceived in her, but she was grown quite cold her hands &amp; feet were become stiff like a dead persons; All persons went out of the Room, leaving only two. Nurses to lay her out: But on a sudden she rose up in her bed, and called for her Clothes, and was in such per∣fect health as before she had not been in, her lame hand &amp; foot being made whole &amp; perfect, to the astonishment of all about her. The account which she her self giveth of this matter, is, that on the day before, there was a knocking or striking on the Table, first one stroke, and after that five, whence she concluded, that the next day she should dye at five a Clock in the afternoon: That she heard a voice saying, <HI>Come, come, come.</HI> When that evening came, her sight &amp; spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch failed, and (says she) <HI>I felt my self go forth with my Spirit, and be ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ried into hea∣ven, where surrounded with a great shining, I saw an huge company clothed in white: And the Lord stepping forth took me in his embrace.</HI> She added, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the Lord told her, she should return again, and behold his goodness in the land of the living, that her disease should leave her. She
<PB N="34" REF="000756_0182_0FAA484C19D7D070"/>
then desired to know how many the dayes of her life should be. But that the Lord told her, that should be hid from her, commanding her to live righteously, &amp; that He would no more visit her as formerly. Whereupon she worshipped him, and was restored to Life, &amp; to full vigor, health, and strength in that very moment. This surely is a strange Relation; yet reported as credible, by as grave &amp; learned a man as <HI>Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nius,</HI> who was an eye and ear witness of these things; Now I must confess, I am not easy to believe, that <HI>Christinas</HI> death or her Ascension into Heaven was <HI>real,</HI> but that they were both <HI>Phantasti∣cal.</HI> Nor do I know any cogent reason, why the Visions of one diseased with an <HI>Apoplexy</HI> should be thought to be of greater weight then the Visions of one diseased with a Fever or Calenture. <HI>Voetius</HI> (de <HI>Prophetia</HI> p. 1080, 1081) concludes that her Visions could not be Divine, because of some jocose passages attending some of them, trivial matters, and things inexplicable as to others of them. Besides, although what she did predict as to her self, usually hapned, her Revelations as to the publick and great concerns of the Church &amp; World were never fulfilled, but the contrary. Our Lord said to his Disci∣ples, <HI>You know not what manner of Spirit you are of.</HI> Luk. 9.55. Persons truly pious may think they are acted by a good, when it is by an evil Spirit. When they have Vi∣sions, they know not what manner of spirit it is that does appear to them. For which reason they ought to be very cautious and careful, how they hearken to them, least haply they be deceived as <HI>Eve</HI> was, when she conversed with the Devil in the Serpent, whom probably (as Dr. <HI>Lightfoot,</HI> and others have observed) she took to be a good Angel, and was thence the more easily seduced in∣to Error.</P>

There are many things mentioned by <HI>Carthusianus, Gerson, Tyraeus, Malderus,</HI> &amp; others, by which they suppose that Angelical Apparitions may be discern∣ed from those that are Diabolical. But I have met with no marks to judge by, either in them or in any other Authors, that are infallible. To instance here in some particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some say, That the Devil cannot appear without some deformity or other. That as he could not appear in the shape of a man before man had sinned, and therefore came to our First Parents in the shape of a Serpent; so now though he can put on <HI>Humane Shape,</HI> yet that it must be with some defect or other, a cloven foot, an ug∣ly countenance, or the like. See Mr. <HI>Mede's</HI> Works▪ fol. 282. <HI>Psellus</HI> supposeth not only that Angels have a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery or fiery Bodies so subtile as that they are to us invisible (of which opinion were many of the Ancients) but moreover, that the Angelical Body sends forth rayes and <HI>splendors</HI> which would dazle mortal eyes, but that the Bo∣dy of an Evil Angel is obscure and squalid. But the notion of Evil Angels always appearing with some deformity in their shape is a <HI>vulgar error</HI> con∣trary to the Scripture, which says expresly, that Satan can transform himself into an Angel of light. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.14.

with a Divine Majesty &amp; Brightness: he appeared like <HI>Elohim.</HI> This opinion has been often confu∣ted by experience. What were those <HI>Nymphes</HI> that the Gentiles of old were deceived with, but Devils appearing in a beautiful form?

That instance of Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> a Mr. of Art of <HI>Trin Colledge</HI> in <HI>Cambridge</HI> is remarkable. He had been a Magician &amp; a Conjurer: But God gave him repentance, and after he was reclaimed from the error of his way, he declared▪ that the <HI>Daemon</HI> whom he had been wont to converse with, always appeared to him in the form of a man of good fashion: nor did he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver require or propose the making of any Covenant with him. See <HI>Glanvils</HI> Philosophical Considerations <HI>p.</HI> 42.</P>
<P N="2">2. It has been said, that Good Angels are terri∣ble at their first appearance, but not at their de∣parture, whenas evil Angels do not appear fright fully at first but at last. This is no infallible rule to judge by; nor does it agree with the Scripture. When three Angels appeared to <HI>Abraham,</HI> &amp; two came to <HI>Lot,</HI> they were not at first terrifyed with the sight of them. <HI>Gen.</HI> 18.3. &amp; 19.1, 2. The An∣gel that visited <HI>Manoah</HI> and his Wife, was not at his first appearance terrible, but at his departure he was dreadful to them. <HI>Judg.</HI> 13.22. The Devils first appearance to <HI>Saul</HI> as well as his last was a∣mazing to him. The Scripture calls the Devil by the name of <HI>Seyir,</HI> whence the name of <HI>Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yr</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="000756_0185_0FAA484E4AC34B78"/>
seems to be derived. <HI>Lev.</HI> 17.7. <HI>Isa.</HI> 13.21. because <HI>Daemons</HI> have oft appeared to men in that horrid Shape. The Hebrew word which is translated <HI>Satyr</HI> the Seventy Greek interpreters express by <HI>Daimonia,</HI> i. e. Devils: the word in its original signification notes such an horror as does make the hai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a mans head to stand upright. For the most part there is an horror attending Diabolical Apparitions: but it is not alwayes so.</P>
<P N="3">3. Some have thought, that the Appa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ition of a good Angel leaveth no room for doubting. That persons visited by holy Angels cannot possibly have any hesitation in their minds, whether they are such o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no But this also is a mistake. Men may con∣verse with Angels, &amp; yet not be aware of it <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.2. Neither <HI>Abraham,</HI> nor <HI>Lot,</HI> nor <HI>Gideon,</HI> nor <HI>Mano∣ah's</HI> Wife, nor he himself did at first know that the persons who came and discoursed with them, were Angels <HI>Judg.</HI> 13.16. When the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> came to the Mother of our Lord, she was at first at a loss about what was spoken to her: <HI>She was troubled at his saying, &amp; cast in her mind, what manner of Salutation this should be.</HI> Luk. 1.29. As for the holy Prophets, they it is true neither did nor could doubt whether they were divinely inspired. For that Divine light which was implanted in their understandings, did shine with that power as made them certain that God spoke to them. There was an <HI>IDIOTES ARRETOS,</HI> an <HI>inexpressible peculiarity</HI> in them. No man that was a subject of that Irra∣diation, could be ignorant of it: nor could any
<PB N="38" REF="000756_0186_0FAA484EE3F0AF00"/>
persons be deceived besides such as had it not: which is more than can be affirmed of all Visions or Apparitions of Angels.</P>
<P N="4">4. No infallible Judgment can be made by the words which they speak, or the counsel which they give, whether the appearing Spirits are good or evil Angels. <HI>Jacobus Vitriacus</HI> speaks of one who was frequently visited in his sleep by a <HI>Daemon,</HI> that did reprehend him for some of his faults, and also excite him to acts of piety &amp; devotion: but the <HI>Daemon</HI> used this fraud with a design to instill some poysonous notions into his mind. <HI>Delrio</HI> writes of a Monk unto whom the Devil appeared in the likeness of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> exhorting him to read the Scriptures. The <HI>Daemon</HI> that acted <HI>Robert Church∣man</HI> (a deluded <HI>Quaker</HI> at <HI>Balsham</HI> in Cambridge∣shire, whom the Lord was graciously pleased to Convert from the error of his way) told him, that the Doctrine of the <HI>Trinity</HI> was true, and that God had an Elect People; that those whom the Father had Elected, the Son had Redeemed, and whom Christ Redeems, the holy Spirit Sanctifies; and directed him to go to a Minister for further In∣struction. Have not cursed Magicians pretended, that the Caelestial Spirits would communicate their secrets to none but Sanctified ones? That men who would have a familiar conversation with those Spirits to reveal secrets to them, must be careful to keep themselves from enormous sins, and pray daily to the most High, v. <HI>Boissard de secretis Ma∣giae</HI> Cap. 1. p. 30. We read in the Scripture of Ma∣gicians,
<PB N="39" REF="000756_0187_0FAA484FDCB549F8"/>
who have advised such as come to them, to give glory to God, and to beware of hardning their hearts as <HI>Pharaoh</HI> did. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 6.5, 6. How long did the <HI>Daemon,</HI> which appeared to Dr. <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> &amp; <HI>Kil∣let</HI> continue to give them good counsil in many things, before they advised them to that which was apparently wicked &amp; vile? <HI>Carthusianus</HI> does great∣ly mistake, when he supposeth, that those Revela∣tions must needs be Divine, which incite men to devotion and spirituality. The Devil has often taken that course, that so he might the more effe∣ctually deceive. <HI>Fallit di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s fuadendo bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m, prop∣ter majus malum inde o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rum.</HI> That so he may in∣sinuate himself into those whom he cannot other∣wise prevail with, he will exhort them unto acts of Piety &amp; Charity. There are some that will give no credit unto what <HI>Bodinus</HI> writes, because they say he was a Papist. Yet others say of him, that he was <HI>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m Protestanti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m doctrinae addictus, nec ab ea multum unquam poste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> alienus.</HI> v. <HI>Thua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

Papists have accused <HI>Bodinus</HI> for an Heretick, because he makes an ho∣nourable mention of <HI>Luther, Calvin,</HI> &amp; <HI>Melancthon.</HI> v. <HI>Possevin.

He was an ingenu∣ous &amp; judicious writer: Now in his <HI>Daemonomania,</HI> there are strange instances recorded which confirm what we assert. <HI>Remigius</HI> also speaks of a young man whose name was <HI>Theodore M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illot</HI> unto whom a <HI>Daemon</HI> appearing, exhorted him not only to abstain
<PB N="40" REF="000756_0188_0FAA4852C3E8DEA8"/>
from drunkenness, uncleanness, theft, and the like evils, but to be constant in his attendance on the Publick worship of God▪ to be very charitable to the poor, and to be frequent in fasting. Would not any man have taken this counseller for a good An∣gel? Let me here take notice of another Example, which many still alive do remember. In the Islands of <HI>Fer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> which are subject to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> there was in the year 1667. a young man whose name is <HI>Jacob Oluffso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>: he on <HI>January</HI> 7<HI>th.</HI> in that year, was afflicted with a disease that made him keep within doors a fortnight: on <HI>January</HI> 20<HI>th.</HI> be∣ing Lords day there appeared to him one in shining garments, and made the room where he was, full of splendor. He gave a kind Salutation to the young man, asking him about his pain, and then stroking him with his hand, the young man was presently healed. This shining Spirit used those words to him, <HI>Be thou whole and si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no more.</HI> He exhorted him to pray three times every day, and that he should admonish the people where he lived, that they should pray also, and that they should leave off their Cursing &amp; Swearing, &amp; desist from all other sins, that so the anger of God may be ap∣peased: So did the Spirit depart from him. But five dayes after he appeared again, and did then sing the 23. <HI>Psalm.</HI> The young man had a strong impulse on his Spirit to go abroad, where he saw in the Southwest the heavens opened, &amp; one com∣ing down thence, who at length came &amp; stood by him, habited like a Minister, &amp; told him he should
<PB N="41" REF="000756_0189_0FAA489DA7CF73B8"/>
not at all doubt, but that he came from God. The next Lords-day, being <HI>January</HI> 27, the glittering spirit appeared to him the third time, asking whether he had performed, what he was commanded. He said, <HI>Yes,</HI> he had. But this Spirit replied, <HI>You have not done it so ear∣nestly as ought to have been.</HI> He appeared several times after this. But at his third appearing, he told the young man that they must change the day of their keeping the Sabbath, from the first day to the last day of the week, withal adding, that whereas there had been on Saturday two Suns seen in the Heavens, that was sent as a sign that <HI>Saturday</HI> should be kept as an <HI>Holy Day.</HI> The news of these Apparitions became publick all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Country o∣ver, and many ignorant people (notwithstanding they were Protestants) put great faith in them, especially as to that of the new Holy-day. But the Ministers char∣ging their people to adhere to the infallible Word of God, and not to regard visions, in a while all vanished, and every one was satisfied, that this <HI>Shining Spirit</HI> was no other than a <HI>White Devil.</HI> The account of this mat∣ter was published by <HI>Lucas Jacobson</HI> Provost of the Churches in those Islands. Also <HI>R. B.</HI> has inserted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in his Book, Entituled, <HI>The Kingdom of Darkness,</HI> p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪11. &amp;c. It is moreover certain▪ that Evil Angels may pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tend a great kindness for those who are the faithful and eminent Servants of God, that so they may either draw them in∣to the snares of temptation, or bring a blast o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their re∣putation. There was a Maid possessed with a Spirit, which would discover hidden things, and yet this Spirit did cry up the most Eminent Ministers in the World, as the true Servants of God. He said concerning <HI>Paul</HI> &amp; <HI>Silas, These men are the Servants of the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igh God, which shew unto us the way of Salvation.</HI> Act. 16.17. some have thought, that Evil Spirits cannot exalt Christ. It is true, that the Blessed Name of Jesus is
<PB N="42" REF="000756_0190_0FAA489E73B9C688"/>
hateful and dreadful to them. Nevertheless, to serve a design of their own, they will extol him. Some Authors write of those who having had familiar Spirits, would speak highly of Christ, whenas thereby they intended him whom they had devoted themselves unto, who (not without the highest Blasphemy) called himself Christ, and would be worshipped above all that is called God. We know from the sacred and infallible Oracle, that a man who was possessed with many unclean Spirits, when the Master-devil in him beheld Christ, he fell down before him, &amp; said, <HI>Jesus thou Son of God most high, I beseech thee torment me not.</HI> Luk. 8.28. Another of them said, <HI>Thou Jesus of Nazareth, art thou come to destroy us, I know thee who thou art, the ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y one of God.</HI> Mar. 1.24. The Devils know &amp; con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess that Christ has power over them. <HI>Act.</HI> 19.15.</P>
<P N="5">5▪ In case they predict some future events, which hap∣pen to come to pass accordingly, we may not from that sole consideration conclude them to be good Angels. <HI>Deut.</HI> 13.1, 2, 3. <HI>Cicero</HI> in his Book of divination, relates that the Oracle of <HI>Apollo</HI> predicted that <HI>Cypsalus</HI> the Tyrant should reign at <HI>Corinth</HI> hundreds of years before it came to pass. An <HI>Augur</HI> when <HI>Rome</HI> was in building, from the flying of Twelve Vultars, presaged the continuance of that City would be 1200. years, which some learned men suppose was accomplished <HI>A.

What shall we think of <HI>Thomas Lermouth</HI> the fa∣mous Scotch Wizard, who predicted <HI>Bruce</HI> his succession to the Crown, and the union of the two Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> &amp; <HI>Scotland</HI> in the ninth degree of the <HI>Bruces</HI> blood? <HI>Daemon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> have seldom (though sometim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s) ventured to foretell events remotely distant: but very often they have p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted things near at hand, which they might easily do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a greater insight into the immediate causes of

things then men have. It was no difficult thing for the <HI>Daemon</HI> that appeared in the likeness of <HI>Samuel</HI> to Prophe∣sy the ruin of <HI>Sauls</HI> Family. All these things considered it is evident that when an Angel appears, the best Saint on earth may easily be mistaken as to some circumstan∣ces attending that Apparition. We see this in the Apostle <HI>John</HI> who thought the Angel that came to him, had bin the Lord himself, otherwise he would not have fallen down at his feet to have worshipped him, for which his Error that Holy Angel reproved him, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.8, 9.

<P>Conclusion IV. <HI>The best and the only way to prevent de∣ception in this case, is to keep close to the Scripture, and when thus tempted, by earnest Prayer with Fasting to seek unto God, that we may not be imposed on with Satanical Il∣lusions.</HI> The Scripture directs us to fight against Satan with spiritual weapons; and in so doing we shall at last be too hard for him. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.4. Extraordinary Temptations call for more than ordinary supplications before that God who has styled himself, <HI>The Hearer of Prayer.</HI> Because of this thing, we must beseech the Lord thrice.

When Evil Angels pretending to be good one<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, are in respect of bodily possessions or of Apparitions let loose upon men and women after such a rate as is truly prodigious, there ought to be Humiliation by Fasting with Prayer before the Lord; and it may be an happy deliverance from them will be obtained in no other way. <HI>Mat.</HI> 17.21. There was in <HI>Geneva</HI> a Senators Son, whom a pretended good spirit accosted with strange Visions and Revelations, saying, that he was the Angel that had shew∣ed

unto <HI>Christina</HI> the Virgin of <HI>Poland,</HI> things that were to come. Some Divines in that City did at first incline to think, that it was indeed a good Angel. But after a while one of them saying, he perceived the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ger of Sa∣tan in the business, the spirit who acted that youth, utter∣ed these words, <HI>They will not believe that I am a good Angel sent of God, but I will prove it by a miracle, and snatching some way or other a knife, thrust i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into his breast, and drew it out again without hurt, crying▪ behold a miracle</HI>▪ Senators with Ministers there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing and Prayer se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k unto God i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a case so solemn.
