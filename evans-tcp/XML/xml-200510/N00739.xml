<HEAD>His <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> THE Earl of BELLOMONT HIS SPEECH To the Representatives of his Majesties Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> the 21th of <HI>March,</HI> 1699.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THere had been no occasion for calling you at this time, if the last Assembly had answered the good ends I proposed to my self for the Kings Service, and that of the Province. But having sate a whole Moneth and done no business, I thought it adviseable to Dissolve them; and the rather, because there were great Heats and Divisions among them, which I found Impracticable for me to compose and put an end to.</P>
<P>You need not be told to what a degree Faction and Sedition have taken Root in this Town, 'tis a thing so generally known. And there has been the utmost Industry us'd by some ill Men to spread the Infection all over the Province, and to alienate the Affections of the People by false Suggestions and Notions of their Independance from the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and that 'tis a Violence and Wrong done 'em that <HI>England</HI> should put a Limitation on their Trade. How extravagant and wild is this Notion; does not <HI>England</HI> put a Restriction on its own Trade, in some Cases? And as for <HI>Pyracy,</HI> which some People are so fond of here, 'tis held in such Abomination as not to be known or practis'd there. People must not be so deceived, this Province is subject to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and 'tis its greatest Glory and Happiness that it is so. For by that means the People are entituled to the Protection of the Crown, and are under the best Constitution of Laws, and that in fellowship with the best and bravest People in the World, the People of <HI>ENGLAND</HI>; and they must be obedient to <HI>English Laws,</HI> 'tis their Duty and Interest so to be. And the Angry Men of <HI>New-York</HI> must not expect from me that Connivance at their ill Practices that they were accustomed to some years before my coming to the Government: The Oath of a Governour, the
<PB N="2" REF="000888_0002_0FAC96F0204EE790"/>
Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and the King's Instructions which are made to square with the Laws, are sacred Ties and Obligations with me.</P>
<P>I have observ'd great Marks of Irreligion and Immorality in this place, and I take it to proceed from a long Habit of breaking the Laws, which has introduced Liscentious and Dissolute Living: And nothing can rectifie and reform our Lives and Manners but Religion. <HI>Religion</HI> is of that admirable frame and temper, it inflames us with a true Devotion to our great Maker, which is our most reasonable Service. Then it fits us for all the ends of Civil Society, by uniting our Minds, Affections and Interests; it makes us good Men: And good Men will of course be good Friends, good Neighbours, good Subjects; and good Patriots, that is, Lovers of their Country, and obedient to its Laws.</P>
<P>Now that I have stated to you the unhappy Circumstances we are in by the contrivance of ill Men, <HI>I</HI> shall proceed to recommend to your Thoughts a few things which are necessary for the Support and Peace of the Government, and will be a manifestation of your Duty and Affection to the KING.</P>
<P>I therefore Propose to you, Gentlemen of the House of Representa∣tives, the Continuance of the present Revenue (which will otherwise shortly expire) for what Number of Years you shall think fit. I found the Government very considerably indebted when I came to it, and it cannot be expected that Debt should be much lessen'd in so short a time as I have been here: And I could wish you would put the Government on a clear foot, by finding a way to discharge that Debt The Publick Accounts I have order'd to be prepar'd for you, with an estimate of the Debts of the Government. I promise you I will be as good a Husband of your Money as 'tis possible for me to be: and when 'tis either mis-apply'd or mis∣mannag'd by my means, I shall not take it amiss if you put me in mind of m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> want of Care therein. To induce you to the continuance of the Revenue to the Crown, I cannot set before your Eyes a better Example than that of the great and glorious People of <HI>England,</HI> who out of a sence of the inestimable Advantages they were restor'd to by the King, freely, and without the least murmuring, supported him in a long and expensive War, well knowing he bravely fought for the Liberties of all the Christian World, and that they had as great a share as any others in that Quarrel; wherein also his Majesty often ventur'd his Royal Person with the meanest Souldier in his Armies. Besides the KING considering this Province as a Barrier between the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada,</HI> and his other Plan∣tations, and therefore most expos'd, was pleas'd to take a peculiar Care of you, having been at great Expence this last War, in paying for four Hundred Men, and maintaining a Man of War for your Defence, and constantly supplying you with Stores of War. These are such Obli∣gations as I hope you will not only remember in the manner I have now recommended, but also with your earnest Prayers to God for his Majesties long Life and prosperous Reign over you.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="000888_0003_0FAC96F0E2BF37C8"/>The next thing I recommend to you, is the Reconciling of People and Parties, which will be a glorious Work and will, I doubt not, be easily accomplish'd by your prudent Care. You all know the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> publick and private, that Feuds and Divisions bring on a People or Nation. They cause an Interruption in Trade, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they make in private Families and Friendships: and next to a Civil War, 'tis the most Unhappy state and Condition a Country can be in. I will heartily joyn with you in such Methods as shall be thought adviseable for the procure∣ment of a thorow Reconciliation of Parties. And that you may induce others to be peaceably and charitably minded, I earnestly recommend to you, Gentlemen Representatives, that you mannage your Debates and Proceedings in your House with that Calmness and Moderation that becomes the Prudence of Men, that are under such a Trust from their Country. The present Conjuncture requires it at your hands; The King will thank you, the World will applaud you for it, and God will bless and prosper you and your Affairs.</P>
<P>I must acquaint you with the Circumstances of our five Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> with whom I had a Conference this last Summer at <HI>Albany</HI> and then fix't their Friendship and Fidelity to the Crown by extraordinary Presents and kind Usage; and they parted with me in all the good Humor imaginable. But I am lately advised they are grown very uneasie and dis∣satisfied at the <HI>French</HI> Governour of <HI>Canada's</HI> detaining some of their Friends prisoners, notwithstanding the late Treaty of Peace, which is a very unfair Practice in that Governour. You shall have all the Memorials and Proceedings with our Indians laid before you, that you may advise me what measures to take for preserving them firm to the Interest of the Crown and this Province, which is a thing of very great consequence, and deserves as much as any thing whatsoever to be the subject of your Thoughts and Determination</P>
<P>I am ordered by the Kings Instructions to prepare and offer you two or three Bills for your passing, which will be for the Service of the Province And such other Bills as you shall judge proper to offer me for securing your Liberties, and advancing your Trade, I promise you my assent to their passing into Laws, provided they be not Repugnant to the Laws and Interest of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>BY Order of the House of Representatives, I do Appoint</HI> William Bradford <HI>to Print his Excellency's Speech.</HI></P>
