<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>The INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>GOOD News from Heaven, the day-spring from on high hath visited this undone world, after a Deluge of sin and misery, behold the bow in the Cloud; the Lord God hath made and established a new Covenant, and this is it that hath cast the first beam on the dark state of lost and fallen man; and hath brought life and immortality to light. This Covenant is <HI>the hope of Sinners, The Riches of Saints, the</HI> Magna Charta <HI>of the City of God.</HI> The forfeited Lease of eternity renewed; Gods Deed of Gift, wherein he hath on fair conditions, granted <HI>Sinners</HI> their lives, &amp; setled upon his <HI>Saints</HI> an everlasting Inheritance.</P>
<P>Hear, O ye forlorn Captives; who have sold your selves to eternal bondage, spoiled your selves of all your glory, sealed your selves up under everlasting misery; you are dead in your sins, guilty before God, under wrath, under a curse, bound over to eternal vengeance. But behold, there is yet hope in <HI>Israel</HI> concerning this thing; the Lord God hath taken
<PB N="2" REF="000857_0007_0FABB2837088C248"/>
compassion upon you, hath opened a way for you to escape out of all this misery &amp; bondage; Lift up the hands that hang down, comfort the trembling knees; An Ark, an Ark hath God prepared, in which is salvation from the Flood; A Covenant, a new Co∣venant hath he made and established, which (if you lay hold on it) will recover all you have lost, ran∣some you from death, redeem you from Hell, and advance you to a more sure and blessed condition, than your original state from which you have fallen. This is the hope of sinners; This is the Heritage of the servants of the Lord.</P>
<P>Glorious tydings, good news indeed! but what is this Covenant? or what is there that is given &amp; granted therein? Why, in sum, there's all that hea∣ven &amp; earth can afford; all that can be needed or desired: and this by a firm and irrevokable Deed, made over, and made sure to all that will sincerely embrace it.</P>
<P>Particularly, God hath in his Covenant, granted and made over,

<HEAD>CHAP. I. God in the Covenant.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1 THE Lord God hath made over <HI>himself</HI> in this Covenant. That's the great &amp; comprehen∣sive promise, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.33. <HI>I will be their God.</HI> I am God, and what I am, 'tis all theirs: my self, my glo∣rious incomprehensible Essence, all my glorious attri∣butes, my omnipotence, my omniscience, my wis∣dom, my righteousness, my holiness, mine all-suffi∣ciency, my faithfulness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I will make over my self to them to be henceforth and for ever theirs:</P>
<P>Their Friend, their Portion, their Sun, their Shield.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Their Friend,</HI> I was angry, but mine anger is turned away: I was an adversary, I had a controver∣sie with them, but I am reconciled, I have found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ransome, the quarrel is composed, my wrath is ap∣peased, I am friends with them; <HI>I will forgive their iniquities, and their sin will I remember no more; I will take away their iniquity and receive them graciously; I will heal their back sliding, I will love them freely; for mine anger is turned away from them,</HI> Jer. 31.34. Hos. 14.4. <HI>Glory be to God on high: on earth peace, good will towards men.</HI> Fury is not now in me: favour, and friendship, love, and good will, is all they may hence∣forth expect from me. Sinners, what is there to be feared? what is there dreadful, but an angry provok∣ed God? Thence is sorrow and anguish, thence is famine, and pestilence, and sword; thence is death and hell: he doth not know what the wrath of God means, that doth not see in the bowels of it, all the
<PB N="4" REF="000857_0009_0FABB287290E1DD8"/>
plagues above ground, and all the vengeance of eter∣nal fire. Whatever terrors, or torments have seized upon thee; upon thy body, upon thy soul; whate∣ver losses, crosses, vexations, afflictions, plague thee on this earth; whatever honour, and anguish, what∣ever amazing, confounding torments are like to meet thee, and feed upon thee in the lake beneath, thou mayest say of all this, <HI>This is the wrath of God.</HI> That day the Lord says to thee, <HI>Fury it not in me</HI>; he saith also, <HI>Fear shall be no more to thee.</HI> That hour the Lord saith, I am thy friend, Dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h and Hell vanish. The day is broken, the shadows fly away. And this is one thing included in that promise [<HI>I am their God</HI>] I am their friend.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Their Portion.</HI> Fury cease? Fears vanish? Frindship, favour, life granted? But what shall he have to live upon? Man was never intended to be a self sufficient; he was created under a necessity of dependance of something without him; not only for the continuation of his being, but of the com∣fort of his being: he cannot live upon the air, though he hath scaped the fire: the soul of man is too big for all the world; like <HI>Noah</HI>'s Dove, it can find no rest below, and where shall it find it, or on what shall it subsist? Why God will not starve his friends; he that hath saved their lives, will find them a live∣lyhood; because there is no other to be found, he himself will be a livelyhood to them; their portion, their maintenance, and their heritage for ever. As their deliverance is from him, so their dependance shall be on him; he is their substance, and on him
<PB N="5" REF="000857_0010_0FABB287D93068F8"/>
is their subsistence, <HI>Jer.</HI> 10.16. he writes himself <HI>the porti∣on of Jacob</HI>; and as such his Saints accept him, Psa. 16 5. <HI>The Lord is the portion of mine Inheritance</HI>; he is their bread, and their water, their stock and their store. The Lord [Gives] portions to his enemies; not only the young Ravens, but the old Lions, and Tigers, the worst of men do seek their meat from God, Psal. 17.14. they have their <HI>portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thy hid treasure</HI>: they have their portion: some of them have their portion in the <HI>City,</HI> others a portion in the <HI>Field</HI>: to some he gives a portion of <HI>gold,</HI> to others a por∣tion of <HI>worldly glory,</HI> to others a portion of pleasures; by all these he deals, as the father of the prodigal, he gives them their portion, and sends them away. But whilst he [gives] portions to these, he [is] the portion of his Saints, he makes over and settles himself upon them, as their inheritance for ever: they shall never be in want whilst there is in him to supply them; they shall never be in straits whilst there is in him to relieve them: all their wants be upon me.</P>
<P>The Lord is their Portion, and he is a sufficient porti∣on, <HI>With thee is the fountain of life,</HI> Psa. 36. <HI>In thy presence is fulness,</HI> Psal 16. The Lord God is all things to them, enough and to spare: <HI>In my Fathers house there is bread enough and to spare.</HI> He that hath all things below God, but not God, hath nothing; he that hath nothing be∣sides God, but hath God, hath all things; enough and to spare; filling up and running over; there's still more to be had, if more could be held: the soul hath never enough, till it hath more than enough; is never full till it runs over: while it can contain and measure and number all that it has, this is its judgment of all, <HI>Pauperis est numerare pecus</HI></P>
<P>In God is enough fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> filling up and running over; e∣nough there is in him to fill up all their <HI>faculties</HI>; their
<PB N="6" REF="000857_0011_0FABB288E1A18EE0"/>
<HI>understandings</HI>; there are infinitely beautiful perfections where we may gaze and glut our eyes with unspeakable delight; but when we have looked the farthest into them, when the most searching eye, the most greedy thoughts have searched and run their utmost, they come not near the end: they shall look, and look, and see, and see, and when they can reach no farther, then they shall ad∣mire at those treasures of light and beauty that are still beyond them. Admiration is <HI>the understanding full, and running over</HI>: when its non-plust, and can reach no fur∣ther then it wonders at what it perceives still beyond it. The Apostle tells us, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.18. that the Gospel (which presents God in flesh) hath in it, an height, and depth, and length, and bredth; and I may tell you from him, 'tis an height without top, a depth without bottom, a length without limits, a bredth without bounds; in one word, immensity, unmeasurable and therefore unspeaka∣ble, unsearchable glory. Whilst the blind world deride and despise the portion of the Saints, looking on God and all the things of God, as <HI>shallow</HI> things, that have no depth in them; they will be found by those that search into them, to be <HI>deep</HI> things that have no <HI>bottom</HI> in them, 1 Cor. 2. <HI>the deep things of God.</HI> All the raptures, and extasies of glorious joys of the Saints in the other world, are the running over of their eyes upon their hearts, and do break in upon them from their vision of God.</P>
<P>There's enough to fill up their <HI>wills and affection<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</HI> there's infinite goodness, incomprehensible love, marvel∣lous loving kindness, unspeakable delights, glorious joyes▪ Psa. 21.19. <HI>Oh! how great is, the goodness which thou hast laid up for those that fear thee!</HI> Oh! how great is the goodness! 'Tis <HI>vox admirantis,</HI> an admiring word; great beyond expression, great beyond imagination; <HI>Eye hath not seen, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hath not heard, neither have entred into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heart of man to conceive the things which God hath prepared
<PB N="7" REF="000857_0012_0FABB28C31FBBB08"/>
for them that love him:</HI> and 'tis <HI>vox exultantis</HI>; of an heart leaping for joy, rejoycing in hope of the glory of God, which is laid up for his Saints. Laid up! where▪ Why laid up in himself; that's the fountain, that's the treasury; there's love, there's joy, there's satisfaction, <HI>our life is hid with Christ in God.</HI> Oh love the Lord all ye his Saints. O bless the Lord all ye his Saints. He that is mighty hath done for you great things: <HI>since the begin∣ning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen oh God besides thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him,</HI> Isa. 64 4. or 'tis in the margin, <HI>There hath not been heard or seen a God besides thee, which doth so for him that waiteth for him, that waiteth for him.</HI></P>
<P>There<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> enough to fill up our <HI>time</HI>; there's admiring work, and praising work <HI>for ever:</HI> there's matter for love and joy, to live and feed upon for ever; endless praises, eternal pleasures, everlasting rejoycings, <HI>Isa</HI> 35. <HI>Everlasting joy.</HI> Psa. 16. <HI>pleasures for evermore.</HI> There's enough to <HI>reward all our labours,</HI> and repay all our expences: there's a full reward; Gen. 15.1. <HI>Fear not Abram, I am thy shield, and exceeding great reward.</HI> Christian, thou shalt not serve the Lord for nought, he will reward thee, and 'tis little in his eyes, that thou shouldst serve him for corn, and for wine, for sheep and for oxen; yea for the Crowns and Kingdoms of this world: these shall not be thine hire; the everlasting God will be thy reward, thine ex∣ceeding great reward: exceeding not thy work only, but thy very thoughts also: A little is too much for thy earn∣ings, but the whole world is too little for his bounty: less then nothing might satisfy for thy labours, but less than himself will not satisfie for his love: the eternal God will be thy reward Oh the unsearchable riches of the poorest of Saints! <HI>Onimium foelices,—bona si sua n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rint.</HI> Poor? what and yet hast a God! in want, what &amp; yet hast all things?
<PB N="8" REF="000857_0013_0FABB28C6D647BC0"/>
Is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a God that is thine, and art thou still in straits? Would a few sheep and oxen, vine-yards, &amp; olive-yards, make thee a rich man, and can a God leave thee a beg∣gar? Is not a pearl more than pebbles? Milk and Wine, than mud and water? Men use to say, <HI>Money is all things</HI>? meat, and drink, and clothes, and friends, and lands; vir∣tually all things. And is not God more than money? Sure he hath said to his Gold [thou art my god] that cannot say, <HI>Let God be mine, and then go thou thy way.</HI> Hast thou a God, and yet poor? Nay farther, would the fatness of the earth, and fulness of heaven, if thou hadst both, be enough for thee? Would corn, and wine, and houses, and lands, and pleasures here, and eternal life here∣after suffice thee? And is not God alone as much as all this? Dost thou want Star-light when thou hast the Sun? Is the Ocean more full for the Rivers that run into it? Or would there be any want there, if all these were stopp'd and dry? Can they contribute to it, which have their rise from it? Hath the Almighty God a self-sufficiency, and hath he not enough to satisfie a poor worm? Is he blessed in himself, and mayest not thou be blessed in him? He that thinks any thing less then God will suffice, under∣stands not a soul; and he that wants any thing more, un∣derstands not God. God alone is as much as God and all the world; and this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, God is their portion.</P>
<P>If enough be not yet said, look a while, and consider whence thou art taken up into this blessedness: What hast thou left? What an exchange hast thou made? Thou wert taken with the Prodigal from the trough, with the beggar from the dunghill, yea as a brand out of the burning; there thy lot was fallen. Oh where hast thou left the rest of the world? Blessing themselves in vanity, pleasing themselves with shadows, and apparitions, feed∣ing on ashes, warming themselves at their painted fires,
<PB N="9" REF="000857_0014_0FABB28D1A7865D0"/>
sporting themselves with the wind, rejoycing in a thing of nought: their crackling thorn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, their glozing pleasures, their drinkings, and dancings, and roarings, their horses, and their dogs, and their hawks, and their harlots; ma∣king a shift a while to make merry with these, whilst they are hasting to the pit, To that fire and brimstone which is the portion of their Cup.</P>
<P>Consider man, what is the chaff to the wheat? What is a Comet to the Sun? What is the night to the day? What are bubbles and childrens toyes to the durable riches? What are things that are not, to him whose name is [I am?] But Oh what is death, and wrath, and the curse? which was once all thine heritage; to that life, and love, and peace, and joy, and glory, which thou now possessest in that God that is thy portion? What a poor wretch wert thou once, when thou hadst nothing but sin, &amp; shame, and misery, that thou couldst call thine own? these thou mightest call thine, sin was thine, woe was thine, death, and the grave, and the curse, and the pit were thine own; but that was all thou hadst; thy good things thou livaedst upon had they been of never so great value, were none of thine; thine house, and thy lands are none of thine: thy gold, and thy silver, and thy substance are none of thine; they are all but borrowed, or committed to thee as a Steward, and all to be given up upon demand; and what thou hast spent of them, thou must be brought to a reckon∣ing for; a poor wretch thou wert, and hadst just nothing, all that thou hadst was none of thine.</P>
<P>But now God is thine own, all that he is, all that he has is thine; never couldst thou lay such a claim to any thing thou possessedst; to house, or wife, or child, or body, or soul, as now thou mayest to thy God. God is as surely thine, as thou art thy self: as sure as thou art a man, thou hast a God.</P>
<P>Come Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>n, here's now thy portion, the light of
<PB N="10" REF="000857_0015_0FABB28E47010B88"/>
thine eyes, the lifting up of thine head the joy of thine heart, the strength of thy bones, thy stock, thy treasure, thy life, thy health, thy peace, thy rest, thy all; <HI>Whom have I in heaven but thee &amp; in earth there is none that I desire besides thee. My <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and mine heart faileth, but God is the strength of mine heart, and my portion for ever. Psal.</HI> 73.25, 26. Here is thy portion, know it for thy good, take it for thy own; live up∣on it, and live up to it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Live upon thy Portion.</HI> Here thou mayest feed, herein thou mayest rejoyce, herein thou mayest bless thy self for ever. <HI>Let him that blesseth himself on the earth, bless himself in the God of Truth.</HI> Let him that re∣joyceth in the earth rejoyce in the God of Truth. Let the strong man live upon his strength, let the wise man live upon his wits, let the rich man live upon his lands, come thou, live upon thy God; come enjoy God and thy soul; enjoy God in thy soul, enjoy thy soul in God. Thou hast possession, what should hinder thy fruition? In fruition the Schools tell us there are three things, which go to the making it up; <HI>Cognitio, Delectatio, Quietatio.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Knowledge</HI>; according to the clearness or clou∣diness of our apprehensions of any good, we more or less take the pleasure or comfort of it; and there∣fore the full fruition of God is not till at last, when we shall know as we are known: Here we see as but in a glass, and darkly; we know but in part, &amp; while we know but in part, we love but in part; &amp; joy but in part; the dimness of our sight makes an abatement upon our joy: When the vail shall be taken away, when we shall come to see face to face,
<PB N="11" REF="000857_0016_0FABB28F121B7F80"/>
then we shall fully feel what it is to have a God. Christian, know thou the God of thy Fathers; the more thou knowest the more thou hast.</P>
<P>The carnal world enjoy not God at all: God is not known in their Tabernacles: <HI>In Jewry is God known, his Name is great in Israel: at Salem is his Tabernacle, and his dwelling in Zion.</HI> But what of God in <HI>Edom,</HI> or <HI>Ammon,</HI> or <HI>Amaleck,</HI> or <HI>Egypt,</HI> those dark Regions wherein neither Sun nor Star appears. Leave them to their dunghil gods to the gardens which they have, desired, and the Oaks which they have chosen. The Lord is before thee know it for thy good. Study thy God Christian, roul over his sweetness in thy mind, as thou dost the sweet morsel in thy mouth; see what he is, &amp; what thou hast laid up in him: read over daily his glorious names, walk through those chambers of his presence, his glorious Attributes; look into the chamber of his <HI>power,</HI> and see what thou hast laid up for thee there; go into the chamber of his <HI>wis∣dom,</HI> and see what that will afford thee, look into the chambers of his <HI>goodness, mercy, faithfulness, holi∣ness,</HI> and behold what treasures are laid up for thee in each of these: enter into thy chambers, they are all thine; enter into thy chambers, let thine eye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e there, let thy meditation be there, let thy soul be there every day; there's thy portion, search it out and know it for thy good. This is the first thing contained in Fruition, Knowledge.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Delight.</HI> Fruition is the taking the pleasure of what we have; <HI>Frui est cum gaudio uti: Augustine.</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="000857_0017_0FABB292F97175A8"/>
We cannot enjoy what we do not love, and love hath delight. We cannot enjoy that wherein we do not joy. <HI>Delight thy self in the Lord,</HI> Psal. 37.4. <HI>I sate me down under his shadow with great delight,</HI> Cant. 2.3. If his shaddow be so pleasant, what will his Sun-beams be? Psal. 34.8. <HI>O taste and see that the Lord is good.</HI> Our senses help our understandings; we cannot by the most rational discourse perceive what the sweetness of honey is, taste it &amp; you shall perceive it. His fruit was sweet unto my <HI>taste.</HI> Dwell in the light of the Lord, and let thy soul be always ravished with his love. Get out the marrow and the fatness that thy portion yields thee. Let fools learn by beholding thy face, how dim their blazes are to the brightness of thy day.</P>
<P>Let thy delights in God be <HI>pure</HI> and unmixed de∣lights. Let thy spirit be so filled with God, and so raised above carnal joys, and the matters of them, that it be no damp upon thee to have nothing but God. Thy Wine is the more sprightful when not mixed with water: Live above in that serene Ayr which is not incrassated with earthly exhalations. Sickly bodies, and so sickly souls, cannot live in too pure an Ayr. Be so wholly spiritual, that spiritual joys, spiritual delights, may be suited to thee, and sufficient for thee. Do not say I want the joy of the <HI>Vintage,</HI> and of the <HI>Harvest</HI>; I want the joy of the <HI>Bridegroom,</HI> and of the <HI>Bride</HI>; I want the <HI>sound of the Milstones,</HI> and the <HI>light of the Candle,</HI> to make my comfort full. Let the joy of the Lord be thy strength, and thy life: Say with the Prophet, Habbak. 3.17,
<PB N="13" REF="000857_0018_0FABB2931856B680"/>
18. <HI>Although the Fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the Vines, the labour of the Olive shall fail, and the Fields shall yield no meat, the Flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no Herd in the stalls; yet will I rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</HI> This is the second thing in Fruition. Delight.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Satisfaction.</HI> The quiet or resting of the soul in its portion: Therefore the Schools say, it is only the <HI>ultimus finis,</HI> the last end, that is the proper object of fruition. The carnal world, whatever they possess, yet they cannot be said properly to enjoy it; tho' they be their gods that they live upon (their dragg is their god, their yarn is their god, their plough, and their plenty, and their pleasure is their god, they burn incense to them) though they be their gods that they live upon, yet they cannot enjoy them; there is no rest for them in their god: <HI>Psal.</HI> 25.12, 13. <HI>What man is he that feareth the Lord? his soul shall dwell at ease.</HI> In the Original it is, <HI>shall lodge in goodness.</HI> The soul is never in ease whilst it is in want, every want wrings; it can never take up its lodging where it cannot take its rest. His soul shall be at ease, shall lodge, that is, shall take up its rest in the goodness of God: and when we find rest in our beds, then we enjoy them. Is thy soul lodged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God? O enjoy thy lodging: <HI>Soul, take thine ease, thou hast goods laid up for many years. Return to thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>est, O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ee.</HI> As it was said [to] so let it be said [by] the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hurch and every Saint, <HI>This is my rest,</HI> here will I
<PB N="14" REF="000857_0019_0FABB293D992CC78"/>
dwell for ever. Here thou mayst find rest, when thou hast no other rock to lean upon; thou mayest be at rest in thy God, in thy most restless state; in a weary land, in a bar∣ren wilderness, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>empestuous Ocean: however it was in the vision of the Prophet, yet thou mayst say, if the wind rise, the Lord is in the wind, if after the wind, an earth∣quake, the Lord is in the earthquake; if after the earth∣quake a fire, the Lord God is in the fire; and where-ever thou findest God, thou mayst find rest. If thou findes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God in a wilderness, thou wilt find rest in the wilderness; if thou find God in the earthquake, or the tempest, or the fire, e∣ven there also thy soul shall find rest: when thou canst not rest in thy bed, nor in thy house, nor in thy land, thou mayst still rest in thy God. Say, Christian, say again, <HI>Return to thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with me.</HI> Though my he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps fail me, and my friends fail me, and my flesh and my heart fails me, God is the strength of mine heart, and my portion for ever: this is my rest, here will I dwell for ever.</P>
<P>To these I might add a fourth thing wherein Fruition stands, The <HI>making use of our Portion.</HI> He enjoyes that uses what he hath; though the Schools distinguish betwixt <HI>frui</HI> and <HI>uti,</HI> yet in a sense (especially with a respect to our present estate) the latter may be comprehended under the former. We then enjoy our portion, when we have a power &amp; heart to make use of it on all occasions. I am thine, Soul, come and make use of me as thou wilt; thou mayst freely: I have nothing but it is for thee; thou mayst freely come to my store, &amp; the oftner the better welcome: have thou not a God lying by the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to no purpose; let not thy God be as others gods, serving onely for a shew: Have not a name onely that thou hast a God; since he allows thee, having such a friend, use him dayly: <HI>my God shall sup∣ply all your wants</HI>; never want whilst thou hast a God, never fear or faint whilst thou hast a God: go to thy
<PB N="15" REF="000857_0020_0FABB295F1C38468"/>
treasure, and take whatever thou needest; there is bread and cloaths, and health, and life, and all that thou needest. O Christian, learn the divine skill to make God all things, to make bread of thy God, and water, and health, and friends, and ease; he can supply thee with all these; or, which is better, he can be in stead of all these, thy food, thy cloathing, thy friend, thy life to thee. All this he hath said to thee in this one word, <HI>I am thy God</HI>; and hereupon thou mayest say, <HI>I have no husband, and yet I am no widdow; my Maker is mine husband: I have no father nor friend, and yet I am neither fatherless or friendless; my God is both my father and my friend. I have no child; but is not he better to me than ten children? I have no house, but yet I have an home, I have made the most High my habitation. I am left alone, but yet I am not alone, my God is good company for me; with him I can walk, with him I can take sweet counsel, find sweet repose; at my lying down, at my rising up, whilst I am in the house, as I walk by the way, my God is ever with me; with him I travel, I dwell, I lodge, I live, and shall live for ever.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Live up to your priviledge.</HI> Live according to your rank and quality, according to your riches laid up for you in God. The rich men of this world live like rich men, they sort themselves with persons of their own quality, at∣tend on the Courts of Princes, are employed about the <HI>magnalia regum:</HI> you may read their estates in the whole way of their life; they wear them on their backs, spread their Tables with them, fill their bellies with them; they live sumptuously, and fare delicately. Christians, feed not on ashes or husks, you have better meat; you have milk and honey, marrow and fatness, the hidden Manna, the bread that comes down from heaven, the water of life; you have blessed priviledges, precious promises, lively hopes, living comforts, glorious joys, the fountain of life to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your souls upon; come, out, O friends; drink, yea
<PB N="16" REF="000857_0021_0FABB29887DCD910"/>
drink abundantly, O my beloved; out-fare the rich man, <HI>Luk.</HI> 16. who fared deliciously every day: you have enough to maintain it; let every day be a gaudy-day, a feast day with you.</P>
<P>Let your cloathing be according to your feeding. Be <HI>cloathed with the Sun</HI>; put on the Lord Jesus. The Kings Daughter is (and so let all the Kings Sons be) all glorious within, let their cloathing be of wrought gold: Be cloathed with humility, put on love, bowels of compassion, gentleness, meek∣ness; put on the garments of salvation.</P>
<P>Let your <HI>company</HI> and converse be according to your <HI>cloathing.</HI> Live amongst the excellent, amongst the generation of the just: Get you up to the <HI>Gene∣ral Assembly and Church of the first-born, to that inmi∣enerable company of Angels, and the spirits of just men made perfect.</HI> Live in the Courts of the Great King, behold his Face, wait at his Throne, bear his Name, shew forth his Vertues, set forth his Praises, advance his Honour, uphold his Interest: let vile persons, and vile ways be contemned in your eyes, be of more raised spirits than to be companions with them, <HI>Disce ex hac parte, sanctam superbiam, scit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> te illis esse meliorem.</HI> Regard not their societies, nor their scorns, their <HI>Euge's</HI> or their <HI>Apage's,</HI> their flat∣teries or their frowns; rejoyce not with their joys, fear not their fear, care not their care, feed not on their dainties: get you up from among them, to your Country, to your City, where no unclean thing can enter or annoy. Live by Faith, in the power of the Spirit, in the beauty of holiness, in
<PB N="17" REF="000857_0022_0FABB29AD00C69E8"/>
the hope of the Gospel, in the joy of your God, in the magnificence, and yet the humility of the children of the great King.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Their Sun.</HI> He will discover and make ma∣nifest to them, the riches and glory of their Por∣tion: He hath <HI>granted</HI> them himself for their por∣tion, and he will <HI>reveal</HI> &amp; make manifest to them what a portion he is. He will make manifest both their blessedness they shall enjoy in him, and the way to it, and also the dangers that lie in the way, Psal 84 11. <HI>The Lord God is a Sun.</HI> The Sun is the light of the world, it discovers its self, and all things else: We cannot see the glory of the Sun but by its own light; the Moon, the Stars, the Firmament, and all this lower World, would all disappear, if the Sun withdrew its light: Beauty and Deformity, Safety and Danger, the Right way and the Wrong, are all brought to view by the light of the Sun: the Sun light makes the Day; Night is spread over the World when the Sun is set. God is glorious, but who would be ever the wiser did not this glory shine? Psal 36.9. <HI>In thy light we shall see light.</HI> Why is the glorious God apprehended, understood, admired, by so few a∣mongst the sons of men? Why, he is out of sight, the Sun is not risen upon them, nor shines unto them▪ they have Moon light, or Star light, some dimmer reflections of this glory at second hand from the Creatures, but they see not the Sun.</P>
<P>What's the reason that truth and falshood, good and evil, substances and shaddows, things perish∣ing,
<PB N="18" REF="000857_0023_0FABB29B5EC712F8"/>
and things permanent, are no better distin∣guished? What's the reason that men are so mi∣staken and misguided in their judgments, in their choice, in their way? That they are at such a loss such Wanderers from their bliss? What's the rea∣son that mens own sparks, the light of their own fires, their Candle light, or Torch light, their flesh∣ly imaginations, their carnal prosperity, their plea∣sures, their ease, their earthly glory, and their carnal joys that hence flash up to them, are so ado∣red and admired by them? Oh, they see not the Sun. God is out of sight, and thence are all their dotages, and foolish mistakes and miscarriages. God will be a Sun to his Saints [their] Sun. <HI>[Thy Sun] shall no more go down.</HI> They shall have both the <HI>propriety</HI> and the <HI>comfort</HI> of this glorious Sun; he will shew them his face, he will cause his glory to appear, he will lead them into himself by his own beams; he will shew them their end, and the means; the Goal and their way to it; he will shew them the good part, and the right path: good and evil duties and sins, realities and delusi∣ons, helps and hindrances, dangers and advantages, their snares and their succours, will all be discover∣ed to them by the light of the Lord.</P>
<P>Hearken, thou poor and dark soul, that hast chosen, but thou knowest not what; that art going, but thou knowest not whither; thou art wandring and stumbling on, but thou carest not how: that complainest thou canst not see, thou canst not va∣lue, thou canst not be affected with all the glory

and joy of the invisible world; that findest thy husk's and thy trash to be a greater pleasure to thee, than all the riches of immortality; that wouldst fain mind, and chuse, and love, and relish, and seek God, and things above, but thou canst not: thou seest so little of the beauty of them, that they do not entice thine heart after them; and when thou art seeking, thou art at a loss, and in the dark as to the way that thou shouldest take. Hearken Soul, thy God calls to thee; <HI>Come unto me, look unto me, and I will be thy Sun: I will shew thee all that glory, and the right way that will bring thee to it: I promise thee I will, trust me, I will be a light unto thee.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Their Shield,</HI> Psal. 84.11. <HI>The Lord God is a Sun and a [Shield.</HI>] The gods of the earth are so stiled, Psal. 47.9. <HI>The shields of the earth</HI>: much more the God of glory. <HI>Ephes.</HI> 6.16. Faith is called a shield: <HI>Above all taking the shield of Faith,</HI> it signi∣fies the same, as God is a shield. Faith is to the soul whatever God is. This is the grace that en∣titles the soul to God, and applies God to the soul, Gen. 15.1. <HI>Fear not, Abraham, I am [thy] shield.</HI> What is promised to the Father of the Faithful, stands sure to all the seed, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.16. The state of Christians in this life, is a <HI>militant</HI> state, a state full of hardships and hazards. By reason whereof, as richly as they are provided for, they are subject to fears of being undone, and spoiled of all: They are in fears about things <HI>eternal</HI>: they have spiritu∣al adversaries, that lie in wait for their souls, that

fight against their souls, that are tempting them, and en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icing them from their God; that watch their opportunities to steal away their God, by stealing away their hearts from him; &amp; such dan∣gerous attempts of this kind they meet withal, that they often are in great doubt what the issue may be. They are in fears about things <HI>temporal</HI>; their names are shot at, their liberties are invaded, their estates, with all the comforts of their lives, are in danger to be made a pray: to day they are a praise, to morrow a scorn: to day they are full &amp; abound, but to morrow they may have nothing left: they die dayly,; they are killed all the day long.</P>
<P>But whatever their dangers and their fears there∣upon are, here is sufficient provision made against all. God is their shield.</P>
<P>Christian, thou hast enough, and all that thou hast is in safety. Thou art <HI>compassed about</HI> with a shield, secured on all hands, there is no coming at thee.

<P N="2">2. <HI>A complication of Interests.</HI> As the head and body, as the Husband and Wife, so Christ and his Saints are mutually concerned: are rich or poor, must stand and fall, live and die together.

<P>O Christians, a sight of Christ in our sorrows, in our fears, in our thickest darkness, what day-light would it bring in? When thou lookest into thine heart, and art astonished and confounded at what thou findest there, at the blindness and the hardness, the poverty, and the emp∣tiness, the guilt and the guile, the pride and the peevish∣ness, the evil thoughts, the vile affections, the filthy lusts, that are swarming and working in thee: when thou look∣est into the world, and tremblest at what thou beholdest there; the malice, the craft, the power, that is engaged

against thee; the furious spirits, the fiery tongues, the fierce looks, the violent hands, that are flying upon thee, and the little relief the earth will af∣ford thee; when thy heart faints, and dies with∣in thee, at the sense of this thy woful and forlorn state: a sight of what thou hast in thy Lord pre∣sented to thee by his Spirit, Look thou here Soul, <HI>what thy Jesus hath sent thee down, a glance from his eye, a drop from his heart, a Mess from his Table; and all to tell thee, Yet I do not forget thee: behold the care I take of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> treasures I have for thee, to encourage thy love, and reward thy faithfulness.</HI> Oh! how will this make all thy darkness to de∣part, and turn the shaddow of death into the morning.</P>
<P><HI>Thus is the Holy Spirit given to the Saints, to be the light of their eyes, the death of their sins, the guide of their ways, the stay of their hearts▪ to uphold their grace, and to maintain their peace; to subdue their ene∣mies, or their fears; to secure them from temptations, or succour them when tempted; to wipe off their re∣proach, or make it their crown; to heal their diseases, or make them their cure; to help their infirmities, to work their works, to make their yoke easie, and their burthens <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight; to turn their sighs into songs, to form their groans into prayers, to send them up to their Lord, and bring down their returns; to comfort their hearts, to establish, strengthen, settle them, that they be neither offended at the chain, nor moved from the love of the Gospel.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>The good things present,</HI> Mark 10.30. <HI>Houses and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, &amp; lands now in this time.</HI> Prov. 3 16. <HI>Length of daye are in her right hand, and in her left hand are riches and honour.</HI> Houses, and Lands, and Riches, and Honours, where are they? who are the poor of this World, the houseless, harbourless, and friend∣less? Who have wo, and want, and shame, and sorrow? Who are Strangers and Pilgrims, dwel∣ling in tents, driven into corners, into dens and caves, hunted up and down upon the mountains of the earth? to whom is hunger and thirst, cold and nakedness, but to the meek of the earth? Is this to inherit the earth? All theirs, when nothing theirs? yet they do inherit the earth. For,</P>

Father knoweth that you have need of these things</HI>; and he knows how much they need. More than needs, is more than enough; and more than e∣nough, is a prejudice. Many men have too much; too much money, too much esteem, too many friends; more than they can bear; so much as to sink them, and drown them in perdition and de∣struction.</P>
<P>Christians shall have enough; they shall never be in such a needy state, but whatever is necessary for them in all the earth, they shall have it: <HI>The earth is the Lords, and the fulness thereof</HI>; &amp; he hath said, <HI>That those that seek him, shall not want any thing that is good,</HI> Psal. 34.10. If the whole world can supply them out of all its store, they shall be sup∣plyed.</P>
<P N="2">2. What they have, they have <HI>a better &amp; farther title</HI> to, than any others in the world. Though the dominion be not founded in grace, yet by grace it is established. What they have, descends upon them not barely by <HI>providence,</HI> but by <HI>pro∣mise,</HI> Heb. 1.2. Christ is <HI>heir of all things,</HI> &amp; they are fellow heirs with Christ A little coming from the <HI>Promise,</HI> hath more in it, than the great∣est abundance that is only handed down by com∣mon providence; that which comes in from the promise, comes in with a blessing; if thou hast but an handful, thou hast a blessing in thy hand; if thou hast but a corner, thou hast a blessing in thy corner. A little from love, is a great blessing. Thou hast God in every morsel thou eatest,

and in every drop that thou drinkest; a drop from Heaven will turn thy bran into the finest flower, and thy water into wine.</P>
<P>O what serene and quiet lives, how void of care (distracting care) might the Saints live in the world!

divided them; the curse he hath left upon sinners, and laid only the naked Cross on his Saints. The crosses of re∣probate sinners, are all curses. Every affliction is a curse; there is wrath in all their sufferings, there is venome upon every Arrow, there is vengeance in every, dart every rod is a serpent to them. Thou that art of the number of Christs implacable enemies, when he comes to fall upon thee, and to grind the under his hand, thou wouldst have a word of comfort to be spoken to thee in thy sorrow; no, no, there is no comfort can be spoken; thou mayst say of every dart he smites thee with, <HI>This is sent of God,</HI> to re∣venge himself upon me; The crosses of the impenitent are all curses: but the Saints curses are all come to be but, crosses. Though men curse, the Lord will not curse what∣ever troubles come upon thee, though there be Vinegar in them, yet there is no venome in them; though there be Angish in them, yet there is no wrath in them; though they be ill-looked, yet there is no ill will in them; they come upon no ill intent, nor shall have any evil Issue. the smitings of the wicked are tother, as the smiting of the righteous were to the Psalmist a precious Balm, Psal. 14.5. <HI>Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness, it shall be an excellent oyl; it shall not break mine head.</HI> And thou mayst say, Let the <HI>wicked</HI> smite me; smite me with the tongue, with the fist of wickedness, or what they will, it shall not break mine head, much less mine heart; it shall be a kindness to me, <HI>an excellent oyl.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Cross is sanctified to its ends.</HI> It hath many holy and excellent ends, and it shall prosper; it shall accom∣plish its ends. The cross is laid on the Saints, sometimes to prove them, sometimes to reprove them; to humble them, to purge them <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and whatever it is sent to them for, it shall not return in vain. <HI>As the word, so the rod, shall accomplish that for which he pleases that sent it.

Let him onely that is without sin, say, <HI>I have no need of shame and sorrow</HI> The Lord will nei∣ther over, nor under do; every one shall have his load and no more.

food nor medicine: If my disease be too strong for my Physick, let me have yet a stronger portion; if my wanton heart will not yet be tamed, put on more fetters, an heavier load; load upon load, weight upon weight, and till thou seest, let me never say it is enough. Let me never be sick of my remedy, till I be cured of my disease. Let me rather suffer by the hand of a Devil, then perish by the hand of a Lust. Spare not Lord, cease not Lord, to smite thy servant, till thou hast thereby smitten down all mine enemies.</HI> Peace? Plenty? Ease? what that I may have to spend upon my Lusts? to wax wanton against my God? <HI>hanc pacem nolo▪</HI></P>
<P>Pain, Trouble, Want, any thing rather than peace, upon such terms. <HI>Correct me, O Lord, yet in Judgment, but not in thy fury, lest I be consumed &amp; brought to nothing.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>The Cross hath its special comfort,</HI> 2 Cor. 1.3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <HI>Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who com∣forteth us in all our Tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort where∣with we our selves are comforted of God For as the suffer∣ings of Christ abound in us, so our Consolation also aboundeth by Christ. And whether we be afflicted, it is for your conso∣lation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings, which we also suffer; or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation: and our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.</HI></P>
<P>The comforts of the Cross are often the sweetest, and the fullest, that the Saints ever taste on this side the crown. The first draught is often bitter; the <HI>green Cross</HI> is heavy, and it is necessary it should be so. As it is with some Medicinal Waters, it works by its <HI>weight</HI>; it must be an heavy yoke that will tame an unruly neck; if it gall not, it will not heal; 'tis the smart of the rod that stills the Child. Think not your burthens will lie easie, when
<PB N="57" REF="000857_0062_0FABB2D15BA295C0"/>
first laid on, and think not much if they do not The first conflict with Temptations, may put you to an har∣der brunt than you are aware. It must be so, that it may be for your good afterward. So my Physick will work, I am content it make me sick. Tribulation wor∣keth Patience; that it cannot do, unless it pains. It a observable that it is not said, the Cross worketh patience but the tribulation, the pinching of the Cross, or the pain, the Cross puts us to; this is patience, a quiet bearing that pain, which the flesh when touched puts us to. When we [feel] the Thorns and the Nails, when the Iron enters into our <HI>souls,</HI> when it pricks and smarts, then it will work. The <HI>green cross</HI> is heavy; a prison, of a wil∣derness, will look uncouth at the first; but when your Lord comes in, and visits you, then the sweet the plea∣sure comes: and the more frowns at the threshold, the more kisses you may expect afterwards; Christ doth not always meet his Saints in the Porch; the Devils Parlour, the inner Prison, is his banquetting house; the Dungeon his Wine-cellar: there they drink and are satisfied. The Stocks, and the Rack, are the Organs that make them the sweetest Musick. Many a Saint hath been sadly disap∣pointed at the first, hoping to meet with Christ at the door; but behold! a dreadful sight; behold! sin lieth at the door; all his sins, all that ever he did against Christ, all his unthankfulness, unfaithfulness, unkindness, rebellion against his Lord, stand forth and stare him in the face. Christians, beware of sin now: it will meet you in the day of adversity, the Cross will tell you all that ever you did. <HI>I remember my faults this day</HI>; now I remember all my pleasant things; my Sabbaths, my Ordinances, my Liberty, the dear society I once enjoyed; but trifled and wasted away; O my pride and my wantonness, my I∣dleness, my Earthliness, my Hypocrisie, wherefore are you come thus to affright and torment me? Lord, whi∣ther
<PB N="58" REF="000857_0063_0FABB2D2201EDAC8"/>
am I come? O how dreadful is this place? Is this my Prison-entertainment? Are these my Prison-consorts? O what an hard lodging am I like to have with such companions? O the Wormwood and the Gall! a dark habitation, a bitter cup indeed is now given unto me. Is this the comfort of the Cross? Are these the sweets so much talked of? Yet be not dismayed, as roughly as thou art handled at the door, it is better within, the Devil is going out in this storm; thy sins meet thee now, but it is only to shake hands and part; after this Agony, expect the Angels to come and minister to thee. Complain not if thou yet find no sweet, thou hast not drank deep e∣nough; the next draught the Sugar may come; in the next Room thou mayst meet thy Lord; and then tell me if it be short of all that hath been told thee.</P>
<P>But shall I give you a more particular view of some of the special comforts of the Cross, or our sufferings for Christ? I shall only first premise a word, to let you un∣derstand what I mean by the sufferings of Christ. We then suffer <HI>for Christ, when we suffer for Christs Cause</HI>; when we suffer because we will be Christians, we will be holy and righteous; when we suffer because we will not sin; and when we suffer upon <HI>Christs call,</HI> when he cuts out a cross for us, and lays it on. Then Christ calls us to suf∣fering, when he puts us to this choice, <HI>Either to suffer or to sin</HI>; when our backs or our consciences must suffer; when we must suffer, or he must suffer by us. <HI>If any man will be my Disciple, let him take up [his] cross.</HI> Christ is not, &amp; Christians must not be prodigal of their blood; their blood is his; their estates, their names, their liber∣ties, are all his, and to him they must be accountable how they part with them. It is not every cross that thou canst call [thy] cross; we must not leave our way to seek a cross; when Christ hath laid a Cross athwart a Christians way that he should go, and he must either
<PB N="59" REF="000857_0064_0FABB2D2E1B33668"/>
make a stand, or turn aside, or submit his neck to it; then he says, <HI>There is [thy] cross, take it up, and get thee on</HI> Whatever cross be before thee, if thou hast a way open to avoid it without sin; that is none of thy cross, thou mayst not take it up; or if thou dost, thou wilt have no thanks for thy pains.</P>
<P>Christians should be w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y here Though it be an argument of a gracious spirit, to be always of a rea∣dy and forward mind to suffer for Christ; &amp; when he demands, <HI>Who will go with me? who will bear my cross</HI>? chearfully to answer, <HI>I will go, Lord, let me bear it</HI>; yet should we take heed, that as we hang not back, when he says, <HI>Go,</HI> so that we run not be∣fore he send us. Though it be an high honour to suffer for the Gospel <HI>yet no man taketh this honour up∣on himself, but he that is called of God.</HI> I would not go to a Prison without a <HI>Mittimus</HI> from Heaven, lest if my suffering be of my self, I be there left to shift for my self. If <HI>Christ</HI> should meet me in prison or in banishment, and demand of me, <HI>What dost thou here</HI> Elijah? <HI>Friend, how camest thou in hither?</HI> What should I say, if I could not say this, <HI>Thou, Lord, hast brought me hither? my conscience, my duty hath brought me in?</HI></P>
<P>But understand me here with this caution, That when the <HI>cause</HI> for the main is <HI>Christs,</HI> but the <HI>call</HI> seems doubtful; yet when the sufferer hath care∣fully enquired the mind of God, truly follows the dictates of conscience, sincerely designs the honour of <HI>Christ</HI> and his Gospel, although he should erre in some circumstances of his case, and for fear of ini∣quity
<PB N="60" REF="000857_0065_0FABB2D3ECC4C8F0"/>
should chuse affliction, when possibly he might have avoided both; God will surely wink at his mistakes, own his sufferings, and greatly accept &amp; reward his readiness of mind.</P>
<P>Yet still take heed of careless or wilful errours: take heed of preparing nails for thy own cross; thorns, scourges, spears for thine own head or heart. Take heed both how thou shunnest, and how thou espo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sest a suffering state.</P>
<P>Go not in upon heedless mistakes; go not in for good company, much less upon any carnal designs; let not thy pride, or ostentation, or the byass of any fleshly respects lead thee into the house of cor∣rection, lest thou find them the rods to lash thee when thou are there.</P>
<P>Christians consider, if there be not sometimes some uncomfortable miscarriages in this matter; and whether it hath not been the lot of some of Christs (with how much justice or charity, let the Lord be Judge) to be censured and reproached for unfaithful, or for fearful upon no other ac∣count but for walking by this rule, <HI>not to go to pri∣son without a warrant,</HI> that is, not to cast them∣selves into a suffering state, whilst God hath left a way open to escape, without sin. I confess the more dangerous, and the more ordinary errour is on the other hand; we are more apt (especially when afflictions are more sharp and bite in ear∣nest, and then will be the great trial) rather sin∣fully to shift our selves of them, than unwarranta∣bly to run our selves upon them; but yet let it be
<PB N="61" REF="000857_0066_0FABB2D4B391DFB0"/>
considered, whether there be not an errour on this hand also.</P>
<P>It is true, where the cause is the same as to the main different circumstances may make that to be one mans sin, which is another mans duty; yea, that may be a duty to the same man at one time, which (supposing him in differing circumstances) might have been his sin at another. And it is not seldome (through the unavoidable difference of our apprehensions, and the difficulty of discerning our cases) that Christians equally careful to know and do the will of God, when the case, and the circumstances also are mostly the same, do judge differently about their call to suffering. Here let no <HI>man</HI> be so tyrannical to others, as to expect that they should go cross to their own, to comply with their brethrens judgments and consciences. Let us not put one another on this unmerciful necessity, either to break our peace with God, or our Friends. Let it be sufficient to us, faithfully to follow our own light, without judging or quarrelling with those that are otherwise minded. Beware of bit∣terness. Be not cruel to consciences; smite not with the tongue, nor let an evil thought arise in thine heart, upon any such account as this. Thine arrows will recoyl, and fly back in thine own face. Blemish not thine own sufferings by blasting thy Brothers liberty. Let not the wariness of some be condemned for <HI>Cowardise,</HI> nor the forwardness of others for pride or hypocrisie; but let us be cloathed with humility, let us put on a spirit of self-suspition,
<PB N="62" REF="000857_0067_0FABB2D6CD974750"/>
and charity to our Brethren; and let this Christian frame be the more studiously maintained, by how much the more our differing practices according to the variety of our apprehensions seem to condemn each other, &amp; so provoke to uncomfortable schisms and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entions, &amp; by how much the more perni∣cious such schisms are like to prove in the issue.</P>
<P>These things premised, I shall now shew you what the special comforts of the Cross are▪ You may expect your suffering state to be sweetned with.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A more plentiful Diffusion of special Grace.</HI> Grace is a comfort; 'tis never better with the Saints, than when that flourishes. The joy of the harvest is howling to the joy of grace; he is not a Christian that cannot say, <HI>'Tis Summer,</HI> when these flowers appear in their beauty. Flourishing Faith &amp; Love, have their glorious joys▪ 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.8. The Springs of grace, are a resurrection from the dead; and there is no such spring as after a showre.

Saints are never more Saints, than in the house of bondage, or the Land of their pilgrimage; our Winter wea∣ther makes us warm at heart. <HI>As our outward man perishes, our inward man is renewed day by day,</HI> 2 Cor. 4 16 Persecution is the time of life. <HI>We are deli∣vered to death for Jesus sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifest in our mortal flesh,</HI> 2. Cor. 4.11. De∣cayed soul, comfort thine heart, the Cross comes▪
<PB N="63" REF="000857_0068_0FABB2D757196420"/>
now thou shalt live; now thou shalt recover. This weakness will strengthen the things that remain, &amp; are ready to die. Now Faith, &amp; Love, &amp; Patience, and Courage that have so long hung the wing, now lift up the head, the day of <HI>your redemption draweth nigh</HI>; this <HI>night</HI> is your <HI>day</HI> of hope.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A more clear revelation of special Love.</HI> Lovest thou me, Lord? there's enough. Let me hear thy voice, let me see thy face.</P>
<P>Kiss me with the kisses of thy mouth. Thy lov∣ing kindness is better than life: send forth thy light, and thy truth, let these tell me, thou lovest me. Thy love sick Spouse is sick for love; O when wilt thou say, <HI>Thou knowest that I love thee?</HI> Why, come up with me on the Cross; that withered tree bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s more blossomes of love, than all the green trees of the field. The whole Gospel is hung upon the Cross Where our Lord hung there is sin nailed, the Curse vacated, Death vanquished; Pardon, Peace Joy, Glory, shewed forth in open sight. There is love with all its tokens, go up and take. Fear not to be baptized with thy Lords Baptism, nor to drink of his Cup; this Cup also is the Communion of the Blood of Christ. Come with me into the wil∣derness, there will I speak comfortably to thee. When thou most wantest it, where thou wilt most value it, there will I shew thee my loves.</P>
<P>Our Lord loves not to have love slighted; the full soul loaths the honey comb; thou hast yet too many Lovers to bid thy Lord welcome; he keeps his best Wine till all thine own be sowred; then
<PB N="64" REF="000857_0069_0FABB2D976BA21C0"/>
it will relish, and then thou shalt have it. His oyl is for thy wounds The Child never knows so much of the Parents hearts, and bowels, as when it is sick, or in di∣stress; then every look is love; every word is pity and compassion. O the soundings of Christs bowels towards his swooning children! when thou knowest hatred, then look to know love. When thou art persecuted, when thou art cast out, and trodden under foot of men, then will be take thee in and cherish thee.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>A more full manifestation of glory.</HI> There is not <HI>a pri∣son</HI> into which the Saints are cast, but hath a window in the <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce. Calvary</HI> becomes a <HI>Tabor,</HI> where they have a sight of their Lord in his glory. <HI>Golgotha</HI> becomes a <HI>Pisgath,</HI> where they may look over <HI>Jordan</HI> into the Land of Pro∣mise. Hast thou known little of Heaven? thou hast not yet been in the deep.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Stephen</HI> the first Gospel Martyr it is said, <HI>Acts</HI> 7.55. <HI>He looked up stedfastly into Heaven, and saw the Glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right-hand of God.</HI> And Chap. 6.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>All that sate in the Council, saw his face, as the face of an Angel.</HI> Such an admirable splendor and se∣renity in his countenance, as spake him rather an Angel than a man. O what an Heaven was there within, that cast out such a Divine lustre on his face! His joy was too big for his heart, his face must have its share; yea his very adversaries, at second hand, behold the glory of God.</P>
<P>He looked up and saw heaven opened▪ Looking down he might see Hell opened, all his Tormentors about him; the jaws of death ready to devour and swallow him up; <HI>But looking up, he saw Heaven opened, and Jesus standing at the right-hand of God.</HI> O there he is, for whose sake is all this▪ My beloved my beloved is yonder. Behold the region of light, whither this dark Tempest is wafting me; his Hell▪ and his Heaven meets, but the light swallows up the dark. Hell ceases to be Hell, where Heaven appears
<PB N="65" REF="000857_0070_0FABB2DB8729D4F0"/>
to be Heaven. This is the Portion of suffering Saints. When you read what is written of those Armies of Mar∣tyrs that have gone before; of their unspeakable joys, their undaunted courage, their admirable boldness; of their chearing their friends, confounding their foes; their re∣joycing in their stripes, singing in their stocks, leaping in their chains, boasting of their Bonds, kissing their stakes, embracing the flames, riding up in triumph in their Cha∣riots of fire, not repenting of their Faith, nor accepting of deliverance; what doth this speak, but that their eyes, as well as their Anchor, are within the Vail, whither Christ their fore-runner is gone before them. Oh who would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be with them? who would fear sufferings?</P>
<P>Soul, what art afraid of? whither art thou running? from what art thou hiding thy self? what is thine ease, or thy liberty, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> quiet? why so loth to loose from this shore? lanch forth into the deep. Fear not transportation into thine house of bondage; when thou art once there, 'tis but look up and thou art in Paradise.</P>
<P>Such are the sufferings of Christ, This is the Cross of the Covenant.</P>
<P N="4">4. In summ; as that which comprehends all the rest, <HI>a more manifest exhibition of Christs special presence,</HI> Jer. 30.11. <HI>I am with thee to save thee,</HI> Isa. 43.2. <HI>When thou pas∣sest through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the Rivers, they shall not overflow thee, when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burnt, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.</HI> Through fire and water thou must go; <HI>We went through fire and water into a Wealthy place</HI>; but whi∣ther ever thou goest, he will go with thee.

<P>He is ever with them; to bear their burthens, and ease their shoulders; to plead their cause, and maintain their Innocence; to wash their stripes, to wipe off their tears, to heal their wounds, to bind up their broken bones, to revive their weary spi∣rits; to perfume their Prisons, to lighten their Dungeons, to lead them in their wandrings, to converse with them in their Solitudes; to give down from above, <HI>in divine Smiles, in Illapses of spi∣ritual joys, assurances of dearest love, tenderest Care, melting Sympathy, gracious acceptance,</HI> to give down from above whatever is wanting beneath. In fine, to preserve them from falling, by the presence of his Grace, till he present them faultless before the presence of his Glory. <HI>O its good being with Christ any where.</HI></P>
<P>Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest and causest thy flocks to rest at noon. Where thou feedest? yea, where thou [art] whe∣ther feeding or fasting, whether rejoycing or mour∣ning; where thou causest thy flocks to rest at noon? yea, and where thou sufferest thy flocks to be scattered in the night.

He feedeth among the Thorns; he feedeth with his Sheep, he feed∣eth with his Lambs wherever they feed; when darkness and desolation, and Devils, &amp; death feed upon them, even then he feedeth them, and takes his feeding with them.</P>
<P>O where ever my Lord is, there let my lot fall. Let me dwell amongst the Thorns, so my dwelling be with my Lord amongst the Lillies. Let me wander amongst the Mountains, whilst he is with me telling all my wandrings. Let me be scourged, so he will wash my stripes; let me weep, so he will wipe off my tears; I would not want wounds whilst I have such oyl to pour in.

<P N="1">1.

<P>LAstly, God hath put into the Covenant all the means of salvation. And all things on their parts necessary, to the obtaining the everlasting Kingdom.</P>
<P N="1">1. All the <HI>outward</HI> means of salvation. Ordinance, Word, Sacraments, and Prayer: <HI>Officers</HI>; Prophets, A∣postles, Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers▪ <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.11, 12. 1 Cor. 3.22</P>

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. A new heart. Ezek. 36.26. <HI>A new heart will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you.</HI></P>
<P>This new heart (I take it) is the <HI>genus</HI> of all the following graces; and therefore the less shall suffice to be spoken of it here. A new heart, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ not <HI>physically</HI> new in regard of substance, but <HI>morall</HI> onely, in regard of qualities.</P>
<P>This new heart signifies both <HI>another</HI> heart, and a more <HI>excellent</HI> heart. 'Tis said of <HI>Caleb,</HI> Num. 14.24. that he had another heart. And this other
<PB N="82" REF="000857_0087_0FABB2EF65FBB970"/>
heart is declared to be a more excellent heart than was in the rest of the people. Whilst they, either followed not the Lord, or but haltingly, he follow∣ed the Lord fully, Prov. 17 27. <HI>A man of under∣standing is of an excellent spirit.</HI></P>
<P>There is another heart, that is not a new heart. <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> had another, but no new heart; the heart of a beast, for the heart of a man; an evil heart grown worse, is not a new heart, but the old heart grown older.</P>
<P>We read 1 <HI>Sam</HI> 10.9. that when <HI>Saul</HI> was a∣nointed King, God gave (him) another heart; this was a more excellent heart, than he had before, <HI>and</HI> yet not the heart here <HI>promised.</HI> He gave to him another heart, that is <HI>the spirit of government</HI>; the <HI>heart</HI> of a King, for the <HI>heart</HI> of a private per∣son; a more publick, raised, heroick heart; the heart of a King fitted to the station and office of a King</P>
<P>The excellencies of this new heart are no natu∣ral, but spiritual excellencies, as will appear more in the handling of the particular graces promised; and are such as fit them for their new

<ITEM>state</ITEM>
<ITEM>work</ITEM>
<ITEM>reward.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. For their <HI>new state</HI>; Christians are made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> children of God, vessels of honour, a Royal prie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>hood, an Holy Nation, a peculiar people; and God gives them an heart, answering the dignity of their High calling.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="83" REF="000857_0088_0FABB2F086FB27B8"/>2. For their new <HI>work</HI>; a Christian hath other work to do, than other men; whilest their business lies all here below, in this Earth; in their Fields, and Vineyards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Christians work lies <HI>above,</HI> with their God, and their Jesus; and <HI>within,</HI> about their nobler, and immortal part; their work is spiritual, and such is the heart that is given to them.</P>
<P N="3">3. For their new <HI>reward.</HI> God intends better things to them; a better portion; a better hope, better comforts, joys, delights here; and a better inheritance hereafter; and he prepares them better hearts, to receive these better things; he will not put his new wine into old bottles.</P>
<P>The excellencies of this new heart may be re∣duced to these three:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A new Light</HI>; discovering the dignity of their state, the spirituality of their work, the glory of their reward.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A new Law,</HI> or frame, or bent of spirit; in∣clining disposing and fitting them to all that which they are made for. And this is the meaning of Gods writing his Law in the heart. The Law written in the heart, signifies, not onely the Law made known in the heart, but the heart made suita∣ble to the Law; and adapted to the obedience of it. There is a kind of connaturalness betwixt the new heart, and all that the Law requires.</P>
<P N="3">3. A <HI>new power.</HI> enabeling them for their new work. We have all these mentioned in one Scrip∣ture, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.7. God hath not given us <HI>a spirit of fear, but of Power, and of Love, and of a sound mind.</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="000857_0089_0FABB2F0DF42D690"/>
[A sound mind] there's the new light; [a spirit of Love] there's the new Law, or frame and with these, [a spirit of Power.]</P>
<P>In summ this new heart is the divine nature; the image of God renewed; the life of God begotten, Christ formed in them. An heart after Gods own heart, containing in it all those graces of the Spirit, wherein stands their likeness to God, and their capacity of serving, and enjoying of him This is the heart the Lord will give. <HI>A new heart will I give unto you.</HI></P>
<P>Against all those glorious things promised before, it would be objected; A Kingdom promised? glory and honour, and everlasting blessedness, granted? Alas, what is all this to me? to whom is it promised! or upon what terms? when I consider what is re∣quired, 'tis all one to me, as if there had been no∣thing promised. The way to this Blessedness is too narrow, the Gate is too strait for me ever to hope to enter. What ever the price be, the strictness, and severities of a Christian course, the very fore sight of them does amaze, and confound me. Live a new life? deny my self? take up my Cross? follow Christ? spend my dayes in Fasting, and Praying, and Mourning? live by Rule? look to every step, to every word, to every thought? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all these things are against me. A new life? a new course? if this be it, I shall never bear it. No man having tasted of the <HI>old,</HI> will endure this new way; for he saith, <HI>the old is better.</HI> 'Tis all one to me, as if there had been no Christ, no Gospel, no Kingdom pro∣mised,
<PB N="85" REF="000857_0090_0FABB2F1F4F5E068"/>
if it cannot be obtained upon other terms than these. I were even as good sit down as I am, and run the venture of what follows, as to feed my self with hopes, of that which I see, I can never obtain. If I do but move Heaven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wards, the stream carries me down; If I do but take up a thought, make an Essay, set a foot forwards towards this new course, I find mine old things hang in my heels. My old customes, my old companions, mine old pleasures, and ease, and liberties, quickly pull me back. O what shall I do? I must be undone, I must be a lost and damned wretch. Fain I would be happy, but I cannot be Holy. I dread, I often tremble to think of loosing Christ▪ and the blessings of his Gospel; but this wretched heart is too hard for me, and will not come on towards it. I am a∣shamed, I am plagued to think, what I am like to lose, and for how little; but I cannot help it; the way is such, that this Foolish heart will never en∣dure it.</P>
<P>Why hearken soul: The Lord that hath called thee to this new course, will give thee a new heart. And there is not any thing required in an Holy life so Irksome, and so contrary to thee; but this new heart is so fitted, &amp; suited to it, that it will become easie to thee. Its pain will be pleasant, its severity will be liberty, its very drudgery (as thou countest it) will be a great delight, Psal. 40 8. <HI>I delight to do thy will, O God, thy law is within mine heart.</HI> And <HI>Psal.</HI> 1.2. of the renewed soul us said, <HI>his delight is in the law of the Lord</HI>▪ In the original, his <HI>will,</HI> his
<PB N="86" REF="000857_0091_0FABB2F53338D6B8"/>
<HI>heart,</HI> is in the Law. The Law is in the Heart, &amp; his Heart is in the Law. Gods will end his are the same, Whatever God bids him do, his heart bids him do; and his hand will never say his heart nay, He that delights in the Law, and as it is a Law, commanding such things, will never grudge to do what it commands. Where tis a pleasure to be commanded, tis no pain to obey. Whatever work the Law cuts him out, it is work he loves. Bid him pray, bid him watch, bid him walk humbly with his God; 'tis work he loves; 'tis in his heart to do it. Bid a Saint draw nigh to God in any duty; 'tis as if you bid the hungry to eat, or the thirsty to drink, the naked to be cloathed, the beggar to come for an alms, or the poor labourer for a dayes work. Bid a Christian to deny himself, to crucifie his flesh; 'tis the same as if you bid him, deny thine enemy, revenge thy self on thine enemy; such revenge is sweet: but O how pleasant is it to him, to be called to a life of praise? to live above in the light, in the love, in the joy of the Lord? to be searching, and studying &amp; looking into, and admi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing those ever∣lasting treasures of spiritual and Heavenly delights laid up in God? to behold his face, to live in his presence, and to dwell in the light of his counte∣nance? it is true, there is some remaining difficulty and Irksomness in the sweetest works of Religion, as far forth as the heart is unrenewed and is yet car∣nal; deny my self? moritifie lust? forsake my com∣panions? withdraw from iniquity? Why what is this but to cut off my hand? to pluck out mine eyes?
<PB N="87" REF="000857_0092_0FABB2F95BFC2388"/>
to tear my flesh? walk with God? seek his face? dwell in his presence? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all one, as to bid me seed on the air, wander on the Mountains, dwell in the Wilderness; and as much pleasure can I find in the one, as in the o∣ther. 'Tis so indeed, as far as thou remainest carnal; the Lord God and all his ways are a <HI>Wilderness, a land of darkness</HI> to thee; but as much as thou hast of this new heart, so much ease and pleasure, thou wilt find herein.</P>
<P>Desponding Soul; thou saist, thou art yet ignorant, and hast little knowledge of the way of the Lord; but behold a new light to lead thee. Thou art yet carnal, and thy heart is contrary, and ever quarrelling at it; but the new nature will end the old quarrel. Thou art weak and impotent, the work is too hard for thee, if thou lovedst it never so well; but what will this be, when thou art endued with power from on high.</P>
<P>O Friend wouldst thou indeed live this new life, get this new heart. But oh there lies the difficulty; how or where shall I get it? Why, have recourse to the Cove∣nant, there it lies for thee. But how shall I get it thence? why hath the Lord promised to give it thee? take the word from his mouth, and put it into thine own; turn the <HI>word of promise,</HI> into a <HI>prayer?</HI> Doth he say [I will give] let thy soul answer, <HI>give Lord,</HI> give me this new heart. I am weary Lord, and thou art weary also of this wicked heart, at once ease thy self and me; Take away this, and give me a better heart. Turn the word of promise into a prayer, and then turn the <HI>word of prayer</HI> into a <HI>word of faith</HI> He says [<HI>I will give</HI>] let thy faith say [<HI>thou wilt give</HI>] I shall have it; since thou hast said, thy servant also may boldly say, <HI>Thou wilt do it.</HI> Thou wilt give me a better heart. Farewel my old sins, lusts and companions; farewell mine old pleasures, and ways; now for Heaven in earnest, now wellcome the strait gate, the new and living way. Old things are past a∣way,

all things shall become new. Turn the word of promise into a prayer, turn thy prayer into a word of Faith, and God will turn the word of Faith into a <HI>word of Command. Be it according to thy word.</HI> Let there be a new light, let there be a new Law, let there be a new Power; let there be no more a spirit of fear in his heart, but a spirit of Power, of love, and of a sound mind. And as when he said in the creation of the great world, <HI>Let there be light,</HI> let there be a Firmament, let there be a Sun and Moon, <HI>It was so</HI>: so when he shall say, in the New Creation of this little world, let there be light, let there be love, let there be power; let us again make man in our image, after our own likeness; <HI>It shall be so.</HI> The Lord hath said, <HI>I will,</HI> let thy Prayer say, <HI>Do it Lord</HI>; let thy Faith say, <HI>Thou wilt do it,</HI> and God will say, <HI>Amen,</HI> So be it.</P>

there's life in this light, it is no other than the light of life. The Knowledge of God comprehends in it, and is involved in, and spirits and animates every grace and duty; as the same Soul, in the eye sees, in the ear hears, in the palate tasts; as the same juyce which is in the Olive fatness, in the Fig-tree sweetness, in the Oak strength, in the Rose fragrancy, in the Lilly beauty; So the same grace, which in the mind, is light; in the heart, is love, holy desire, holy fear, holy joy; and one says, that as feeling is inseparable to all the Organs of sense; the eye feels and sees, the ear feels and hears, the palate feels and tasts, the nostrils feel and smell; So knowledge is involv∣ed in every grace; Faith knows and believes, Charity knows and loves, Temperance knows and abstains, Pati∣ence knows and suffers, Humility knows and stoops, Re∣pentance knows and mourns, Obedience knows &amp; does, Compassion knows and pities, Hope knows and expects, Confidence knows and rejoyces; And therefore we be∣lieve, and love, and obey, and hope, and rejoyce, be∣cause we know. God gives us this knowledge as the eye of our Souls, and by that eye, he enters with all his pow∣er and Glory, Eph. 3.19 <HI>That ye may know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, and be filled with all the fulness of God.</HI> Day-light is not that light we receive by reflection from the Moon and Stars, at second hand; when the Sun is risen, and come in among us, then it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay; When the Sun of Righteousness is risen in the heart there is the light of life; God is, and God dwells in this light, and where God dwells, every unclean thing vani∣shes; can Darkness dwell with the Sun? can Death dwell with Life? according to the measure of the mani∣festation of God in us, so far forth is sin necessarily va∣nished.

<P>He that hath known the Lord, hath more or less according to the measure of his knowledge, received in the relish and sweetness of it; and what he hath received in, he sends forth before men; he hath received, and he is a sweet savour. As the Preachers, so the Practioners of Piety, are a <HI>sweet savour of Christ unto God,</HI> and hand down the sweetness of God unto men.

Their ways stink, their words stink, their very breath smells of a rotten heart. Yea, the very best they have, their pleasures stink, their garments, their gallan∣try, their powders, and perfumes, &amp; sweet odours stink, of their proud and vain, and sensual hearts.

<P>The last of these, <HI>the savour of this knowledge,</HI> the pleasure that it brings into the soul, though taken <HI>alone,</HI> it is but of uncertain signification; there may be some pleasure and joy arise from the common knowledge of God; &amp; sometimes but little taste, where there is the truth of Religion. But taken <HI>in conjunction</HI> with the former, where is found both the <HI>power, and the savour,</HI> the evidence of its sound∣ness will be more full.

Their knowledge doth not lead them on to Religion, but must serve them instead of Reli∣gion: It is all the Religion they have, to know what it is: 'tis made to serve, and not suffered to guide, and govern; to serve their turns, to serve their interest, to serve their pride and their cove∣teousness; their knowledge of God makes them Devils, it helps them to play the Hypocrites, to be Deceivers of others, yea and of their own Souls: It will seek them out acceptable words, put prayers into their mouths, praises into their lips, spiritua∣lize their Language, furnish them with savoury Discourses; carry them plausibly through Duties; wherein, though God hath the Name, though Souls have the Name, yet are they all but sacrifices to their Lusts; The Knowledge of God humbleth, but this knowledge puffeth up, and lifteth up; puffeth them up in their own, and lifteth them up in others thoughts; and when it hath done this, it hath done them all the service they have for it to do, unless it may be, they have some worse

'Tis the very heart in the tongue that speaks; the heart in the eye that weeps; the heart in the hand that works; the heart in the foot, that walks; no, 'tis not so with the Hypocrite, he shews another heart in his tongue, in his ways than that which is within him He hath an heart, and an heart, one in his tongue or life, and quite another in his breast. His course speaks him another man, than he is: and thus one heart signifies a single or a plain heart.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>The place of the end</HI> God is its first and last. He's first in the eye, and it looks no farther. It makes him not onely the chief, but in a sense its onely aim. It will have no other God, and therefore no other end, but the Lord. It makes all things else, not onely to stoop and stand by, but to serve to him <HI>Get you hence, stand off,</HI> is its language to all that stands up in his room, or stands in his way. Evil men, whatever honour they pretend to have for the Lord, they do but make him a servant to their other gods. Religion they will take up, but it is onely to serve their own turns, to bring about their carnal ends; <HI>they serve not the Lord, but their own bellies,</HI> saith the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 16.18. <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.19. Nay they make the Lord their fellow-servant. They serve, and their Religion must serve their sensual appetites. He that will have so much Religion only, as he may live up∣on, (which is the measure of the most) makes the Lord no longer his God, but his servant A sincere Christian will set God upon the throne, and makes all things else his ser∣vants or his foot stool Whatever will not be serviceable, must be trodden in the dirt. Nothing will be loved, and embraced, but what will set God higher or bring God near∣er to his heart.</P>

<P N="1">1. It draws the heart to it; God who is a Chri∣stians end, is also his beginning. Our first step heaven ward, we owe to the influence of heaven upon us. <HI>Draw me, we will run after thee,</HI> Cant. 1. <HI>No man can come unto me, unless the Father which hath sent me, draw him.</HI> Nothing but God will do it, as nothing will draw the soul another way; the pleasures of sin, the wages of unrighteousness, are poor and low baits to entice a soul away from God; that is, so far as 'tis renewed; so it is no∣thing but God that draws the soul on its way, and he will do it. God draws the soul not by an act of power only, but by moral swasion, that is the proper casualty of the end. Not by <HI>efficiency</HI> on∣ly, but by <HI>sympathy</HI>; as by the water, the thirsty soul is drawn to the water-brooks.</P>

<P>Those only follow him, whose hearts <HI>God hath touched.</HI> It is not mans <HI>touching,</HI> but <HI>Gods touching</HI> the heart, that draws it heaven ward. The tongue of man may touch the ear, it is God only that touches the heart. And when he touches, then the heart will follow. As you know the Needle when it is touched with a Loadstone, then it turns after it. The Loadstone is not more natural at∣tractive of the Needle, than God is of that heart which he hath touched. Cant. 5.4. <HI>My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved in me.</HI> He did but touch the door, and her heart felt him, and moved towards him.</P>
<P>O Christians, when you have been waiting up∣on God in Prayer, Hearing, or any other spiritu∣al Duty, or Ordinance; consider, Hath mine heart been touched this day? My tongue hath been touched, mine ear hath been touched, mine heart hath been treated with, but hath the Lord touched it? hath there Vertue come forth from him, which hath enticed and drawn my Soul af∣ter him? Sometimes by a Message, or Visit from Heaven, the Lord hath drawn a good word from the lip, a tear from the eye; but O for touches upon souls, for turning of bowels, for the flowings out of hearts after the Lord; He is the only load∣stone that prevails on gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious Souls.</P>

gods it may be, in one man; because so many hearts. Their pleasures are their gods, their profits their gods, their belly their god; their wives, or their children, their gods; &amp; so many gods, so many ends. And every end is a loadstone to draw them after them. Every heart will after its god A Christian, that hath but one heart, hath but one God, and this is he that draws it on its way. Thou sayst, <HI>The Lord is thy God, thou acknowledgest, thou ownest, thou hast chosen him for thine</HI>; but what doth thy God whom thou hast chosen do upon thine heart? what will the sight of God, or thy love to God, or thy hope in God, do upon thee? how far will it carry thee? which way runs thy heart? which way dost bend thy course? dost feel thy God drawing thee? &amp; is thy heart running after him? Running, notes motion, and a swift or violent motion.</P>
<P>I shall lay before you these six or seven expres∣sions, the Scripture uses, to note the running of those hearts after God, whom he hath drawn.</P>
<P N="1">1. The desiring of the Soul after God. Isai. 26.8, 9. <HI>The desire of our Soul is to thy Name.—With my soul have I desired thee in the night, yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early.</HI> Desire is the soul in motion God wards. Towards him are their desires, and they come deep, <HI>ab intimis, ab imo pectore,</HI> from their inwards, from the bottom of the heart. <HI>With my soul have I desired thee, with my spirit within me will I seek thee.</HI> Psal. 38.9. <HI>Lord, all my desire is before thee</HI>: 'tis not all my desires, but my desire; thou seest all, and 'tis all but one
<PB N="110" REF="000857_0115_0FABB1E69FAECF30"/>
desire. He desires pardon, he desires peace, he desires help, and the healing of his wounds; but all this is but one desire. God is all. <HI>One thing have I desired,</HI> Psal. 19 4</P>
<P N="2">2. The thirsting of the soul. Psal. 42.2. <HI>My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God.</HI> Thirsting is the extremity of desire; hunger and thirst are the appetite of desire heightened; violent and painful appetites; <HI>My soul thirsteth, and is in pain till it be satisfied.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The longing of the soul. Psal. 63 1. <HI>O God, thou art my God early will I seek thee: my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is.</HI> Longing causeth languishing, and abortions, if it be not satisfied. Psal 119.20. <HI>My soul breaketh for the longing desire it hath to thy judgments. My heart panteth, my flesh faileth, the light of mine eyes is gone from me</HI> Psal. 38.10.</P>
<P N="4">4 Calling after God, Psal. 4.1. <HI>Hear me [when I call] O God of my righteousness.</HI> Calling upon God, is the voice of desires. The desiring soul will not keep silence; the tongue, the eye, the ears the hands, the knees, must all be Oratours, when the flame is once kindled within.</P>
<P N="5">5. Crying after the Lord. This is an expression answering the thirsting of the soul. Crying is a passionate, and importunate praying. <HI>I cryed unto the Lord with my whole heart,</HI> Psal. 119.145.</P>
<P N="6">6 Crying out after God. This is the manner of the longing soul. Crying out, notes more than bare crying; loud cries, strong cries, forced out by
<PB N="111" REF="000857_0116_0FABB1E761932F30"/>
a proxism of love, or an agony the soul is in. Psal. 84.2 <HI>My soul longeth, yea even fainteth for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh [cryeth out] for the living God.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Following hard after the Lord, Psal. 63.8 <HI>My soul followeth hard after thee.</HI> This expression is more comprehensive, it notes, both all the work∣ings, and breakings, and breathings of the soul within, and its diligent pursuing in the use of all outward means, and pressing on after the Lord. All those labourings, and watchings, and runnings, all that holy violence, wherewith a Saint presses <HI>into the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>Put all this together, and you will see the pow∣er and influence the Lord hath on holy Souls, to the drawing of them after him; they are in moti∣on Heaven-ward; desiring, thirsting, longing, cal∣ling, crying, crying out, following hard after him. What aileth these souls? what is the matter with them? what would they have? Judg. 19.23. <HI>What aileth thee,</HI> said the <HI>Danites</HI> once to <HI>Micah, that thou comest thus after us? What aileth thee? Why, you have taken away my gods, and what have I more. What aileth these crying, longing, running Souls?</HI> Why, it is after their God they cry, it is after their God they run. 1 King. 19.20. <HI>Go back Elisha,</HI> said once the Prophet to him, when he had cast his Mantle on him: <HI>Go back, for what have I done unto thee? What hast thou done? enough to hold me from going back</HI>: there went vertue with the Mantle; the Mantle fell on his heart, as well as his back, and drew it
<PB N="112" REF="000857_0117_0FABB1E81D309860"/>
after the Prophet. Should you say thus to these, <HI>Go back Soul, go back from following thy God, for what hath he done unto thee? Oh he hath gotten mine heart; No, no, I cannot go back, he is my God, and what have I more?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The end guides &amp; directs to means: <HI>Whither shall I go from thee? thou hast the words of eternal life.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The end <HI>governs</HI>; I shall put these both to∣gether: What is it that Governs sinners but their ends? this points them out their work, and their way; this holds them to their work, &amp; keeps them in their way; whatever fetters &amp; chains, their lusts are to them, 'tis their carnal ends to which they are in bondage; these are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey that lord it over them, &amp; hereupon it is impossible to perswade a sinner to make a through change of his way, till he hath changed his ends: herein stands the conversion of a sinner, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the changing of his ends; when he ceases to be any longer to himself, to his flesh, to the world, and for a worldly happiness, and is brought about to pitch on God as his portion and happiness, to whom he devotes and dedicates him∣self: there is conversion; Sin is our turning away, and conversion is turning back to our God. Belo∣ved, consider not barely <HI>how,</HI> but to <HI>what</HI> you live; not only what you <HI>do,</HI> but what you <HI>would have</HI>; and never count your selves truly godly, whatever of God be in your way, till God be in your heart and eye: He that hath first chosen God, &amp; there∣fore a godly life; whose godliness of life springs forth as the fruit of his choice of the Lord: that is a godly man.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="000857_0118_0FABB1EB9FA0DCE0"/>God governs as our King, and as our <HI>End</HI>; as our King by his Soveraignty, as our End by his <HI>Excellency</HI>; by his worthiness and goodness, as our King by <HI>Laws,</HI> as our End by love. Love will find out our way, will tell all our wandrings, will check us for our sins, sweeten our labours, quicken us on our course, cut out our way through dangers and difficulties, and keep us in our way, till we come to the fruition of our end. Therefore it is said by the Apostle, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.9. <HI>The Law is not for a righteous man.</HI> Love will save the Law a labour; <HI>the Law is not for a righteous man,</HI> not so much at least as for sinners; not as to the Coertion of it, though still as to its Obligation: the constraint of Love will much super∣sede the Coertion of Laws.</P>
<P N="4">4 The end, <HI>Rewards, they have their reward,</HI> Mat. 6. that is, they have their end <HI>the reputation for devout and charitable men,</HI> was the end of their Devotion and Chari∣ty. They prayed, and fasted, and gave alms, for no o∣ther end; and the obtaining that reputation, was their reward. <HI>Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.</HI></P>
<P>God is the reward of his Saints, Gen▪ 15.1. <HI>I am thy exceeding great reward,</HI> Isai. 46 4. <HI>My judgment is with the Lord, and my reward with my God.</HI> God is the re∣ward they [<HI>shall</HI>] receive, and the reward they look to receive, Heb 11.29. <HI>Moses had [respect] to the recom∣pence of reward.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore the Argument is weighty, which Christ used to disswade his Disciples from being in their Devo∣tions, in their Alms-deeds, as the Pharisees and Hypo∣crites are, who <HI>disfigured their countenances in their fasts, who sounded a Trumpet to proclaim their Alms; Be ye not like them, for they have their reward.</HI> The Argument was strong to the Disciples, who being men of another spirit, could not be satisfied with such a reward.</P>
<P>In these two things Saints greatly differ from the men

<P N="2">2. <HI>They dread it to have their reward here, they would dispatch their work, and are willing to go upon trust for their wages.</HI> Sinners would have their wages in hand, and be trusted for their work till hereafter; they would be hap∣py here, and can be content to stay for holiness till here∣after: it is soon enough to be Saints in Heaven. But Oh! it would be a dreadful word to Saints. <HI>There are thy good things; take them, these are thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> These are not their end; and therefore they cannot take them for their reward</P>
<P>Poor foolish Worldlings, how are you disjoynted? how are your weary hearts scattered through the ends of the earth? how many masters do you serve? how many matters have you to mind? you weary your selves in the greatness of your way, and what is your reward? What the fields can give, you have; what your sheep or your oxen can give, you have; what your beds or your tables, or your houses, or your cloaths can give, you have; here a little, and there a little, you get up, your beds give you ease, your houses shelter, your sports and companions pleasure, your parasites honour; and that little you can pick up here and there, this is your reward. Verily I say unto you, you have your reward; unhappy souls, you are troubled and careful about many things, for nothing; one <HI>thing is needful</HI>; and if yet ye wiil be wise, chuse that good part which shall not be taken from you.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>This one heart hath but one thing to do,</HI> Phil 3.13. <HI>This one thing I do.</HI> There are all things in that one thing; all things needful. How many things soever his hand findeth to do, all is but one He intends in all, God A renewed heart designs God, and is making God-wards in all he does. Whatever journey he goes,

'tis God is his home; whatever race he runs, 'tis God is his mark and prize. Whatever battel he fights, a∣gainst flesh and blood, against Principalities and Powers, 'tis that he may cut his way through all to his God. Whatever he does, he does it for God; whatever he suf∣fers, he suffers for God. When he hears, or Fasts, or Prayes, 'tis all for God. <HI>When ye fasted, did ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at all fast to me?</HI> Yes to thee, a Christian is able to say; he hath many things to pray for, and fast for; he hath bread and cloaths, and friends, and health, and safety, and li∣berty, to pray for; but in all, he prayes for God. He entitles God to all he hath, and marks it up for him, and he sees and enjoyes God in all he has; he will not own that for a mercy, that hath not God in it, and is not a foot or wing, to carry him on towards him And there∣fore whatever he begs to himself, 'tis that he may have it for God. What he gives, he gives to God; whom he forgives, 'tis for the Lords sake; whether he eats, or drinks, or works, or buyes, or sells, or whatever else he does, he does it all to the glory of God. 1 Cor. 10.31. For him he prayes, for him he waits, for him he labours, for him he suffers, for him he lives, to him he dies. <HI>To me to live is Christ,</HI> Phil. 1.21. <HI>according to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as alwayes, so now also Christ may be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death.</HI> This is the one thing he intends, this is the one thing he seeks, in all, take his whole course together, he can say with the Apostle, <HI>This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things that are before, I press toward the mark for the price of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</HI></P>

When God and the things of eternity are gotten so deep into the heart, when there is such a deep sense of the weight &amp; impor∣tance of the things that are eternal, abiding upon us, as over-powers carnal objects, &amp; loosens the heart from them; when we feel the evidence, &amp; the consequence of these things commanding our whole souls after them, then there's Religion in earnest; then we go on &amp; prosper. And thus 'tis with this one heart, there are not some light touches onely upon it; God is gotten deep into it, eternity is gotten deep into it, this is all; this is all I have to mind or do. My hope, my comforts, my life, my soul, all hang upon this one thing; if I speed well here, I am made for ever. <HI>What have I to do in the way of Egypt, or to drink of the waters of Sibor? what have I to ao in the way of Assyria?</HI> what have I to do in the way of pleasure? What have I to do in the way of the World? To build Taberna∣cles for my self here below, or to drink the wa∣ters of mine own Cistern? How little am I con∣cerned in the interest of this flesh? What matter's it, what becomes of it, or which way it goes? My God, my God, my Soul, my Soul, there lies my concernment; of these let my care only be. Get thee behind me Satan, hold thy peace sinful flesh, keep silence worldly cares; hinder me not, speak no more to me of hearkening to you, away from me ye evil doers, I will keep the commandments

of my God; Let others do what they will, run whither they please, chuse whom they will serve, what they will follow after; come my Soul, follow thou the Lord, gird up thy Loyns &amp; come away; for the other world, for the other world; make haste, linger not; let others loyter as they will, e∣scape for thy life, look not behind thee, get thee up to the Mountain and live.</P>

O Lord thou knowest. I cannot get rid of it, I cannot do the things that I would, I cannot pray as I would, nor hear as I would, nor think, nor speak, nor live as I would: whither I go, sin goes with me; where I lodge, it lodges; If I sit still, it abides with me; if I run from it, it follows me; I can neither rest nor work, I can do nothing for it, I can do nothing for it, and yet blessed be thy Name, this one thing I do; what I cannot attain, I follow after; I cannot conquer, yet I fight against it; I wrestle with it, though it so often give me the fall. I trust it not, though it flatter me; I love it not, though it feed me; I prostitute not my self unto it, though it commits so many a rape upon me: my heart is with thee, Lord, my foot is making after thee; I groan, I tra∣vel in pain, waiting for thy redemption; till I die I will not give over.

<P>And thus you have the description of this one heart. It pitches on one end, &amp; God is that end. It gives him the place of the end, he is its first and last. It gives him the power of the end: this one thing, the obtaining of God to be theirs, draws them on, guides, governs them, in their whole course, and is accepted by them as their onely and

exceeding great reward. This instructs them, this rules, and encourages them, calls them off from sin, calls them on to duty, carries them out in suffering; all their powers are united in this one business; all their arguments are resolved into this one argument, all their rewards are summ'd up in this one reward, <HI>God shall be glorified, and therein my soul shall be satisfied; God shall be mine, and glory shall be his.</HI></P>
<P>In all this we see what this one heart means, but Oh how little of this Grace have we received! how many hearts have we? how many gods have we, to divide these hearts betwixt them? how small a corner?</P>
<P>How low a place must the Lord take up with us it he will have any at all? how often is he made to stand aside, or to stoop to a lust, God made to give place to the Devil? Is God our All indeed? have we none else to please, have we none else to serve? have we no por∣tion, no inheritance, no other God but the Lord? Is he our <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega,</HI> our first and our last, our Spring and our Ocean, our sum and our scope, the rise and the rest of all our motions? Whatever our tongues speak, do our hearts also and our lives say, <HI>To me to live is Christ</HI>? None but God, none but Christ, nothing but Heaven and glory? when we are driving so hard for our flesh, for our pride, for our ease, for our gain, when we are so busie this way, and so hearty and so zealous this way; when these must have so great a share in our Re∣ligion, is this still the voice, <HI>To me to live is Christ</HI>? Oh how little power hath the Lord with us? how far is it that the single interest of God will carry our souls? how little is done purely for God? we have often many strings to our bow: there are some services, wherein there is something coming to the flesh, as well as to the Name of God. Some credit, or honour, some out∣ward advantage to be gotten by Religion; but when
<PB N="126" REF="000857_0131_0FABB2004DF24830"/>
all the other strings crack but this one; when there is nothing to move us but God, Oh how weak do our motions grow? The flesh often goes partner with God: there is a double trade driving in the same actions; a trade for Heaven, and a trade for Earth together: there is something to be gotten by our Religion, besides what is coming to God; there are Fields, and Vineyards, and Olive-yards, Friends and Honours, and Preferments: as it sometimes fall out, when Godliness is in the rising side and when it is thus we go smoothly and vigorously on. Come see the zeal <HI>that</HI> I have for the Lord of Hosts. But when the interest of God, and the flesh divide, and part asunder; when the flesh is like to be a loser by our Re∣ligion; when God pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s us on such duty, as will spend upon the flesh, and eat out and devour its interest; when our hearts tell us as <HI>Deborah</HI> did <HI>Barak,</HI> Judg. 4 <HI>This will not be for thine honour,</HI> or this will not be for thine ease, or thy safety; then what becomes of our zeal? Oh how heavily do we then drive on? how seldome is it that this word, [<HI>Yet God shall be glorified,</HI>] will balance all the prejudices, and confute all the cross reasonings of the flesh, and carry us on our way, without and a∣gainst it.</P>
<P>How little hath the Lord of the government of us? If he doth govern as a King, yet how little as our end? How little doth Goodness govern? how little will Love do with us? we must have Rigour and S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verity, we must have Spurs and G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ads, and Rods, and Stripes, &amp; Scorpions too, and all little enough to drive us back from those o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her gods which we have chosen, &amp; to bring us on after the Lord. If the Law be not made for the righteous, if they need not a Law, then what are we whom a Law will not suffice? If commands, threat∣nings, terrours, penalties, judgments, can do no more upon us; if we are yet so loose, and so carnal, and so

earthly, and so froward, and so false, &amp; so formal, under severest Discipline; if we will not be whipped into more humility, spirituality, self-denial, watchfulness, care, acti∣vity, zeal; but are such Drones, and such Sle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pers, such Earth-worms, and such Sensualists still, under all the corrections and compulsions of the Law; Oh what should we be, did we want a Law? where there no∣thing but love to restrain us from sin, and constrain and quicken us to duty?</P>
<P>Christians, have we but one thing to do, in all we do? sometimes we are busie in doing nothing Though there be a Prayer in our mouths, the praises of God in our mouths; Christ, Heaven, Holiness, Glory, a new heart, a new life upon our tongues; there's nothing within; no prayer, no praise, no Christ, nor Heaven; what have we been often doing in the Closet, in the Fa∣mily, in the Congregation, when we seemed to have been praying? Nothing, nothing, but sowing wind and good words. Sometimes we have too many things in our hearts; what a world of carnal devices, and fleshly projects have we wrapt up in the garment of our Religi∣on? <HI>Peters</HI> sheet had not a more heterogeneous miscella∣ny of creatures, four footed beasts, wild beasts, creeping things, and fowls of the air, than our religious duties have of designs and ends. We have men to please, our pride, our bellies, to offer sacrifice to; we bring our Farms, and our Oxen, &amp; our Trades before the Lord; are not our hearts, which should be the houses of pray∣er, the houses of merchandize? are we not talking, or pursuing, or in a journey, or asleep, or driving bargains? O Christians, if we were privy to one anothers hearts, as God is privy to them, what abominations should we see brought into the holy places? What monsters would our most sacred services appear? Which whilst the out∣side is only viewed, are applauded and admired. Is
<PB N="128" REF="000857_0133_0FABB2019DD26E10"/>
this our singleness of heart? Oh! for shame, and blush∣ing, and confusion of face; Oh! for a Vail to hide such hearts from the jealous eyes of the holy God: a varnish, a fair out-side, hides all from men; but noting but a dark Vail of shame, and sorrow, and tears, and repentance: a Vail dipt in blood, in the blood of Christ, will hide them from the eyes of the Lord.</P>
<P>Oh how little plainness and singleness of heart is there, in our ordinary course, in our dealings, and conversings in the World? How little Faith, or truth is there in us? How little Trust is there to us? What doubling, what deceitful dealing, defrauding, over-reaching, undermi∣ning, are we guilty of? how false are we in our promi∣ses? how insignificant are our words? what an uncertain sound do they give? Our Yea may often stand for Nay, and our Nay for Yea, Psal. 12.2. <HI>They speak vanity, e∣very one with his neighbour, with flatterings lips and a dou∣ble heart do they speak: trust ye not in a friend, put not confidence in a guide.</HI></P>
<P>Blessed be God, the Lord hath a Generation, on whom this cannot be charged <HI>Children that will not lye</HI> nor de∣ceive, though Satan and this evil world bind up all in a bundle, they are all naught, they are all false, vain boa∣sle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and deceitful workers, there is none upright, no not one: but thanks be to God, Satan is a lyar, the accuser of the Brethren, is a <HI>false accuser.</HI> God hath his children that will not lye. But wo be to those professors by rea∣son of whom the offence cometh.</P>
<P>Christians, hath God promised to give you one heart? Let it be once said, <HI>This day is the Scripture fulfilled</HI>; O may you be the accomplishment of this good word. Hath God promised to give you one heart? Do you not say, <HI>but I will not take it</HI>; two are better than one: I have found so much the sweet of deceit, that there is no life like it; Hath God said, I will give one heart? let not

any one among you say, <HI>but I fear he will not.</HI> Make not the promise of God of none effect, either by your impi∣ety or unbelief: Doth God promise to give this one heart? he that promised it, doth also require it. Be thy self Christian: Let it be said thou art what thou art, be true, be but one; have but one heart, and let thy one heart have but one tongue, but one face; and but one thing to do. Beware of Hypocrisie, beware of carnal policy; make not thy God to serve thy flesh; call not the serving of thy flesh, a serving of God, and make not thy s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ving of God to be a serving of the flesh. Be not divided betwixt God &amp; the World: O how easie would our lives be, did we find our whole Souls running one way? taking up with God as the adequate object of all our Powers? the mark of all our motions, and the re∣ward of all our labours? did all our streams empty them∣selves into this Ocean, and all our lines meet in this one centre? Did God only draw and allure our hearts, and the sincerity of our hearts, give motion to all our whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>? Guide our eyes, govern our tongues, order our steps, a∣nimate our duties, direct and quicken us in all out go∣ings? Oh how sweet, Oh how beautiful, were such a life? the Sympathy betwixt our hearts and end, there is sweetness; the Harmony of our hearts and wayes, there is beauty. O how sweet are the drawings of love, the free and full closure of our Spirits with God, dissolving themselves into his Will acquiessing, resting satisfied in his goodness, is a sweetness which no man knows, but he that tastes it; the harmony of the power of the Soul within it self of its motions and actions in the life, there is the beauty which will eclipse the glory of the world. Christian, be it thus with thee, and thou hast the blessing that covenant blessing, which the Lord hath promised, in saying, I <HI>will give them one heart.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>Ante factum.</HI> Or before the commission. Whilst it is under a temptation, or feels the first motion to sin. A tender heart startles, starts back at the sight of a sin▪ as at the sight of a Devil. Gen. 39.9 <HI>How shall I do this great wickedness and sin against God</HI>? the manner of the speech, presents <HI>Joseph</HI> as a man in a fright, startled a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the ugliness of the motion.

Is it not a little one? is no plea with it. Little or great, 'tis a sin, and that's enough.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Post factum.</HI> After the commission; if it hath been brought on upon sin, yet it cannot go out with it. The skirt of <HI>Sauls</HI> garment, was too heavy for <HI>Davids</HI> heart to bear.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Of Duty</HI> A tender heart will neither slight a sin, nor neglect a duty. <HI>It is loth to grieve &amp; offend, and careful to serve and please the Lord. It would not that he should suffer by it, nor so much as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ose his due. It watches against sin and unto duty. It cares how to please the Lord, and its care is tender It would not dis∣please by its neglects or performances; all must be done that ought, &amp; as it ought to be done. It will neither stand out with its offering, nor will it offer as unclean thing. It considers not only what, but how. Both matter &amp; manner, substance &amp; circumstance, all must be right, or it is not at ease. It will keep time, and as much as may be, keep touch with the Lord in every point.

<P N="3">3 In point <HI>of suffering.</HI> A soft heart will not be careful, what, or how much, but why, and upon what account, he suffers. Will neither sinfully shun the cross, nor run upon it unwarrantably. He waits for a call, and then follows. He is patient

Oh this hard heart, Oh this stubborn spirit; I cannot mourn, I cannot stoop, I cannot submit, Isa. 63.17. <HI>Why hast thou hardned our heart from thy fear?</HI> Or why hast thou left us, or given us up to an hard heart? why hast thou not softned, and humbled and broken us? thou hast humbled us, and we are not humbled; broken us, and we are not broken; thou hast broken our Land, broken our Peace, broken our Backs, but the stone is not yet broken; Oh for one b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>each more Lord; our hearts, our hearts, let these be once broken; our streets mourn, the Cities of our So∣lemnities mourn, the wayes of Sion mourn, Oh! when wilt thou give us a mourning Spirit?</P>
<P>Oh what sorrow bitten Souls are the Saints, for want of sorrow! <HI>I mourn Lord, I lament, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but it is because I cannot mourn, or lament as I should; If I could mourn as I ought, I could be com∣forted; if I could weep, I could rejoyce; if I could sigh, I could sing; if I could lament, I could live; I die, I die, mine heart dies within me, because I cannot cry: I cry Lord, but not for sin, but for tears for sin; I cry Lord, my Calamities cry, my Bowels cry, my

<P>The Rocks rent, the Earth quakes, the Heavens drop, the Clouds weep, the Sun will blush, the Moon be a∣shamed, the Foundations of the earth will tremble at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> presence of the Lord, but this heart will neither break nor tremble; O for a broken heart? If this were once done, might my Soul have this wish, thenceforth my God might have his Will; what would be hard, if my heart were tender? Labour would be easie, Pains would be a pleasure, Burthens would be light; Neither the Command nor the Cross would be any longer grievous, nothing would be hard but Sin.

<P>Oh Brethren, how little, how very little of the Ten∣derness is there to be found amongst the most of Chri∣stians? <HI>The Sacrifice of God is a broken heart</HI>; Oh how far must the Lord go to find himself such a sacrifice? we do but cast stones up to Heaven, when we lift up our hearts; it is a wonder, that such hearts as we carry do not break themselves; that our Marble weeps not; that if nothing else will do it, our Hardness doth not make us relent; that we should so labour under, and complain of, and yet not be sick of the Stone</P>
<P>Broken hearts, yielding and relenting Spirits, tender Consciences, Oh where are they? afraid of sin? tender of Transgressing? or mourning under it? when shall it once be? our Lusts no more broken? our Pride, our Passion, our Envy, our Earthliness no more broken?

<P N="1">1. Its Object. The Object of Divine love is God. God is good, and good is amiable.

In this one Attribute, all the rest of the Attributes of God are included, and this in each of them. However, the Scriptures, speaking to our capacities, de∣scribe God and his glorious Attributes, in several and distinct notions; yet in each one all are included; each one is infinite, and infinite perfection is essentially all per∣fection. <HI>God</HI> is <HI>originally</HI> good▪ the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ain and pattern of all that moral good that is in the creatures; he is bounti∣ful, and gracious, ready to do them good, and he is the felicitating end, or the blessedness of the soul.

<P>God himself is proportioned to us, consider us as <HI>rational</HI> creatures, and in our state of <HI>innocency</HI>; is both a sufficient and a suitable good; but God in Christ only, being con∣sidered as <HI>lapsed creatures,</HI> in a state of sin.</P>
<P>God in Christ, <HI>is a God of pity, and compassion to us; a God of patience, a God of mercy, with whom is plentious re∣demption. A God, pardoning iniquty, and passing by trans∣gression; loving us in our low estate, loving us and pitying us, loving us and pardoning us; loving us and washing us, loving us and saving us from our sins, and from the wrath to come.

<P N="3">3 <HI>Propriety</HI> What's good, good for us, and [our own] good, that carries our hearts. We most love our own good, because we most love our selves. Our love to God is hightened from our due self-love; there is a <HI>sinful</HI> self-love; when either we love that for a self, which is not our self; when we love our flesh and fleshly interest; or when we love our selves inordinately, more than God, and God on∣ly for our selves; and there is a <HI>lawful</HI> self-love; when we love our selves, <HI>in the Lord and for the Lord And the more we thus love our selves, the more is the Lord loved by us, &amp; the more be is our own, the more love he hath. Now in Christ the Lord is [our] God.</HI> Our own God; <HI>even our own God.</HI> Psal. 67.6. <HI>O God thou art [my] God, and I will praise thee. Thou art my God and I will love thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Lord is God, and we therefore love him; the Lord is good, gracious, merciful, and we therefore love him, yea, and ought to love him, whether he be ours or no; but when both meet, he is God and our God; he is good and our good; graci∣ous, merciful, all-sufficient, and all this to us; hence is our love made perfect in us,</HI></P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>Possession</HI>; we can love a distant, an absent good· A good that is only possible; there's love in hope; but by how much the nearer <HI>good</HI> is to us, (that is really so) by so much the more attractive and acceptable it is. 'Tis then most in our <HI>hearts,</HI> when 'tis most in our <HI>hands.</HI> In∣deed those things which have only <HI>speciem boni,</HI> that are <HI>fancied</HI> good; or those things that are <HI>finite</HI> good; and good over-rated; that are judged better than they are, are loved most at a distance; because when they come to hand, we see our mistakes But that which is what it seemed; much more, that which is above our thoughts, beyond our expectations, <HI>infinite</HI> good; by how much the nearer, it is ever the dearer to us. All worldly good is most valued, (at least by carnal hearts) at a distance;
<PB N="156" REF="000857_0161_0FABB230DA8FF510"/>
they promise themselves more contentment in it, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hath to pay them; their possession is their disappointment. Whilst they lusted, they Idoliz∣ed, they adored; but when they have tasted, and eaten, it comes out at their Nostrils. Or else they sit down, with the shame of the disappointed; they are either furfeited, or an hungry still. <HI>Is this all? all you can do for me? all the pleasure, and comfort, I shall have of you? is all my expectation of Delight, and Satisfaction, come to no more but this?</HI> Miserable Com∣forters are you all! possession and fruition is the proof of all things. And vanity proved, is the less loved. But God being an all-sufficient, incompre∣hensible good; by how much the nearer to us, by how much the more he is ours, by so much the more we prize and love, because now we find (when we have him, we enjoy him) that before, <HI>the one half was not told us.</HI></P>
<P>Now in Christ, we have not only a propriety in God, but in some degree, a present possession. <HI>He that hath the Son, [hath] the Father also.</HI> We see his light, we feel his love, we taste of his good∣ness, we enjoy his presence, we have God with us, we have God in us, we have felloship with him, he dwelleth in us, and we in him, and hence we love, and herein we rejoyce.</P>

these they love: They love the ways, and works, and all the dispensations of God, and it is God in them all they love, they see God in every thing, and they love God where ever they see him.

of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. The things of God, are the <HI>Off spring</HI> of God, as the Saints are born from above, so all the things of God, they come down from above, and there∣fore may also be called as the Apostle stiles them, things above, Phil 3.1, 2. <HI>If ye be risen with Christ, seek those things that are above, set your affections on things above</HI>; things above, and the things of God, come all to one whatsoever is from God, &amp; belongs to his Heavenly Kindgom, is divine, &amp; Heavenly; and he that loveth him that begets, <HI>therefore loveth those which are begotten, and whatsoever proceedeth from him.</HI></P>

in the Saints, &amp; the holy truths in the Word, are the very face of Christ, who is full of Grace and truth, and this is their Rule,</HI> love God, and love his Image.</P>
<P N="3">3. The things of God are the <HI>Chariots</HI> of God. He that makes the Clouds his Chariots, makes also his Word, &amp; his Ordinances, and his Ministers, his Chariots, wherein he rides down into those lower parts to give the world a meeting When Ministers come, &amp; the Word comes down, God comes down in them to visit his people; as 'twas said of <HI>Paul,</HI> so 'tis true of <HI>Apollos,</HI> and <HI>Cephas,</HI> and all the Dispensers of the Gospel, they are <HI>chosen Vessels to hear his Name,</HI> before the Sons of men; and as they are the Cha∣riots in which God comes down, so are they also the <HI>Waggons</HI> which he hath sent them, to fetch them up to him self; The Saints <HI>send up their hearts in their Duties, their hearts in their Prayers, in their praises unto God. Old</HI> Israel<HI>'s heart leap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, when he saw the Waggons which</HI> Joseph <HI>had sent. Oh what love doth the</HI> Psalmist <HI>express, to the House and Court of the Lord! O how amiable are thy Tabernacles! I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go up into the House of the Lord</HI> He was glad to go thither, <HI>because thence he hoped to be carried higher▪ from the mountain to the Mansion; form Mount</HI> Zion <HI>here below,</HI> to Jerusalem <HI>which is above.</HI></P>
<P>It's the Duty, and the delight of the Saints to be ascending Heaven wards, they are <HI>dead</HI> with Christ they are <HI>risen</HI> with Christ; and 'tis not as <HI>they</HI> would with them, but when they are <HI>ascending</HI> up with Christ, they are dead with Christ, <HI>by Repentance
<PB N="159" REF="000857_0164_0FABB23B07538CA0"/>
and Humiliation,</HI> they are risen with Christ, <HI>by Faith and Sanctification,</HI> and <HI>they ascend with</HI> Christ <HI>by Love and holy affection; this is their Chariot of fire, a Chariot within a Chariot, that through Duties and Ordinances rides up in its own flames to the God of Love</HI></P>
<P>Or if you will, the Ordinances of God, are our <HI>Jacobs Ladder</HI> reaching from Heaven to Earth; by which, Angels descend▪ and Souls ascend. God comes down, and hearts go up, Praises go up, &amp; Blessings come down; thou hast not prov'd what an Ordinance is, what Prayer means, or Preach∣ing means, or Sacraments mean, that hast not seen God coming down, nor felt thine heart ascend∣ing by them; he that hath felt this, will say, Here let me dwell; let others be where they will, a∣mongst their flocks, amongst their herds, upon their beds, or at their cups, amongst their Harlots, or in their Houses; <HI>It is good for me to be here.</HI></P>
<P>No wonder Christians, that carnal hearts are such strangers to the Word, can so well sit out at Duties, &amp; can want Ordinances; Preaching and Praying, and Sabbaths, they can spare, and not feel their want, what wonder? What is Heaven to Earth? What is God to Flesh? these Chariots would carry them away from their Gods, carry them out of their own Country, into a strange Land, where they have nei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her possession nor ac∣quaintance. But oh! what a sad wonder is it, that Saints should go up so often into the Chari∣ots and yet be gotten no nearer home, that they
<PB N="160" REF="000857_0165_0FABB23B9691BD90"/>
should be still so much on the Earth, that have been so often mounted for Heaven; that those hearts should still be on the dunghils, whose feet are so often on the Mountain of the Lord; that the Waggons should be so often sent down, and go up empty; scarce an heart sent up in them; yea, that they should be so far from God, when God is among them. Where's your love, Chri∣stians? how is it that it is still below? what have you here? your City is above; your home is a∣bove; your God, your Jesus, your Treasure is a∣bove: On how is it, that where your Treasure is, your hearts be not also? hear from God, and not God with the messenger? send up to Hea∣ven your eyes, your hands, your Prayers, your complaints, your promises, and still leave your hearts below? send up hearts to Heaven, and let them return again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own to this Earth? remain Earth, and Flesh, and Filth, and Vanity, after so much converse or pretence to it, with the holy God of Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>its? lovest thou God? when thou canst so often go where he is, and not care to see him? or if thou meet him, canst let him go without a blessing? or if he bless thee, canst go presently and exchange thy Fathers blessing for a mess of Pottage? canst lose a duty in a dinner, the comforts and revivings of a Sermon, of a Sacrament, of a Sabbath, in an hours carnal con∣verse in the world? did we love our God more, certainly we should be more with him, and to better purpose. His meetings would be more pre∣cious,
<PB N="161" REF="000857_0166_0FABB23DD2C52918"/>
and the fruits of them more lasting. We should neither go away without his blessing, nor throw it away when we had gotten it.</P>
<P><HI>Thus much for the object of Love.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Its Act. <HI>Love is a natural Affection. The love of God is the Souls clasping or closing with the Lord▪ It is the expansion, or going out of the heart, in its strength, after God, the uniting or knitting of the Soul with God, with a complacency and acquiescence in him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There are three things included in this love.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The strength of the heart making out after God.</HI> This is that which is commonly called our <HI>amor desiderii,</HI> or our love of desire, the breathing or thirsting, or panting of the heart, after God, <HI>Psal.</HI> 42.1. The hearts working God wards <HI>with its might</HI>; loving him above all things, desiring him above all things; and that both <HI>intensive</HI> with the greatest vigour and intention: and <HI>adaequate</HI> as its compleat and adequate Object. God is its All. <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon Earth that I desire besides thee.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The uniting of the Soul with God.</HI> Our clea∣ving to him. By love heart cleaves to heart, Soul cleaves to Soul. Its said of <HI>Shechem,</HI> Gen. 34.3. that his heart clave unto <HI>Dinah.</HI> He loved her with his heart, she was gotten into his heart, and there his heart holds her. Acts 11.23. <HI>Barnabas</HI> exhorts the Church, that <HI>with purposse of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.</HI> It is the <HI>knitting of the</HI> Soul with God. Its said, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1.18. <HI>That the
<PB N="162" REF="000857_0167_0FABB23FE176AA68"/>
Soul of</HI> Jonathan <HI>was knit with the Soul of</HI> David, <HI>and</HI> Jonathan <HI>loved him as his own Soul.</HI> And of <HI>Jacob, Gen.</HI> 44.30. to express his tender love to <HI>Benjamin,</HI> 'tis said, his life was bound up in the lads life. Of the multitude of believers we read, <HI>Acts</HI> 4.32. that they were all <HI>of one heart and of one Soul.</HI> Their love had knit them up all into one. By love we are one with God and he with us. It is the souls <HI>willing of God,</HI> as I may so speak. Willing of God to it self, and willing it self, and all to God. All praises, all honour, all blessedness to him. Be thou mine, Lord; no¦thing less, nothing else. Be thou mine, I need no less, I desire no more. Let me be thine, be to thee, be for thee, thy servant, thy sacrifice, or what thou wilt; and <HI>let all mine</HI> be thine; mine heart, and my hand, and my tongue, and my time, and mine interest. Let all <HI>thine</HI> be to thee; thy Heavens &amp; thy Earth, with every person, with every creature in them. Let every heart, every mouth, every limb, every creature be a praise to the Lord. <HI>Let the Lord live, and blessed be my rock; let the God of my salvation be exalted.</HI> Let every knee bow, let every tongue confess unto God. This is the <HI>amor unionis,</HI> our love of union, as 'tis called. And 'tis the heart, the very essence of saving love, wherein are included both our accep∣ting of God, and our surrender or resignation of our selves unto God. <HI>Amor non est nisi donum a∣mantis in amatum.</HI> And our wishing and willing all glory, dominion and blessedness to him. And so here also is our <HI>amor benevolentiae,</HI> our love of
<PB N="163" REF="000857_0168_0FABB2409DCF3DA8"/>
benevolence. All these may be included in that <HI>opening</HI> of the heart, mentioned, <HI>Acts</HI> 16.14. It's there said, that the Lord opened <HI>Lydia</HI>'s heart. The heart is then savingly opened, when it freely sets out its self upon God, all its streams run in to the Lord; and when it takes in, and takes down God into the depth of the soul. The heart thus opened to the Lord, when God is come in, will close upon him. Abide with me; thou hast entred upon thine habitation, Oh let this be thy dwelling for ever. Only this must be farther ad∣ded, that with God it takes in all things of God; his Word, his Ordinances, his Wayes, and all his Dispensations: With his Love, his Laws; with his comforts, his Counsels; with his Counsels, his Corrections; with thee, I accept of all that's thine; both thy yoke and thy cross, thy self, Lord, thy love Lord, and what thou wilt with thee.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The souls taking pleasure, and taking up its rest in him.</HI> This is call'd our <HI>Amor. complacentiae.</HI> Where we love, there will be a delightful <HI>stay</HI> or <HI>immoration</HI> of the mind upon God. <HI>Ubi amor, ibi oculus.</HI> The object dwells in the eye; we are still looking where we love. <HI>Anima est ubi amat.</HI> When I awake, I am still with thee; there his thoughts are, of him is his meditation all the day long.</P>
<P>My meditation of him shall be sweet. He that loves, <HI>dwelleth in God. I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.</HI> And why there? why there his God dwell, &amp; therefore there his soul takes up its
<PB N="164" REF="000857_0169_0FABB241ADF16DC8"/>
dwelling. There is also <HI>an acquiescence</HI> of the heart in him. <HI>Return unto thy rest, O my soul.</HI> But this is not felt, till love hath obtained: Till the soul feels it self to love, and to have what it loves; to love, and to be beloved; to accept, and to be ac∣cepted of God. When it comes to this, then I have enough. <HI>I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine.</HI> And here is the sweetness of Religion, the marrow and fatness of godliness, <HI>the pleasure of love:</HI> When I love, I can rest; when I can rest, I can rejoyce; when I feel my self to love, I know I am beloved; and then what is there wanting? Where love is a stranger, joy is not known; we can never take comfort in any thing, but in that which we love. When take we pleasure in eat∣ing, but when we have meat that we love? What is a friend, or a wife, or a child, when we love them not? What is society or communion, where love hath not first made an union? <HI>can two walk together except they be agreed?</HI> with little comfort sure; they would be better pleased, were they parted asunder. 'Tis love that is the pleasure of our lives. 'Tis love that makes Heaven sweet, there we shall have our fill of joy, because there we have our fill of love: Heaven would be no Heaven, God himself could not be the <HI>joy,</HI> if he were not the <HI>love</HI> of his Saints. What bitter draughts will love sugar? sin, and lusts, and all the filth of the flesh, are sweet morsels to carnal hearts; 'tis meat they love; God is nothing, Christ is no thing to them; <HI>What is thy beloved more than other
<PB N="165" REF="000857_0170_0FABB2447773E858"/>
beloveds?</HI> Religion is a bondage to them, holiness a weariness; not the labours only, but the joys of the Saints are empty and unsavoury things; <HI>there are no feasts but love feasts.</HI> Love is both the <HI>best dish,</HI> and the <HI>only sauce</HI> to every dish; 'tis the best dish; he that feeds on divine love, will never com∣plain of a short meal; and 'tis the only sauce for every dish; 'tis but unsavoury meat that is not seasoned with love; we may a little change the proverb, <HI>love is the best sauce</HI>: Be the meat never so excellent, it will not relish if it be not loved. Love will make any thing down. When it puts such a sweetness into sin, that even death and hell will down with carnal hearts for its sake, Oh what a feast will love make of holiness and glory! get love to Christ, love to Religion, and you will never demand, <HI>Where is the blessedness?</HI> where is the sweetness?</P>
<P>Love will sweeten both the comforts and the exercises of Religion; 'twill make duties sweet; yea, and sufferings sweet: there are two things that are naturally sweet to love,</P>
<P>To please. To praise.</P>
<P N="1">1. He that loves, will <HI>please,</HI> and observe whom he loves: How careful are such to watch them∣selves, that they grieve not their friend? what study does love put them upon, to find out what's grateful and acceptable? Acceptable looks, accep∣table language, acceptable entertainment? what wilt thou Lord? what wilt thou have me to be? a servant? a door-keeper? a servant of servants
<PB N="166" REF="000857_0171_0FABB24521A2A820"/>
for thee? I will be nothing but what thou wilt, any thing that thou wilt have me. What wilt thou have me to do, Lord? Let me know thy will, appoint me my work. <HI>Oh that my ways were so directed, that I might keep thy statutes.</HI> What wilt thou have of me? wilt thou have mine Idols, mine ease, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mine honour, or my pleasure, or my house, or mine estate? wilt thou have mine <HI>Isaacks</HI>? is there any thing dearer to me than other, that might be an offering to the Lord? wilt thou have my liberty or my life? behold all is at thy feet; I can keep back nothing thou cal∣lest for?</P>
<P>Hence love is said to be the <HI>fulfilling of the law</HI>; there is in this good will, radically every good work. It would <HI>walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work.</HI> Love is generous, it would do great things, noble things; what shall I do for him whom my soul honours? Oh for a gift that might be worthy of him! but I have nothing, my goodness extendeth not to thee; it would give more than it owes; but where it can∣not do so, where it cannot be generous, yet it would be just; it would level all accounts, &amp; pay all debts; love would have nothing but love ow∣ing. It would give to all their due; it would not dye in the debt of a servant, of a stranger, much less (could it help it) would it defaulk from the God of glory. That's the daily charge of love, <HI>pay what thou owest.</HI> Its receipts and re∣turns are a pleasure to it; any thing that comes
<PB N="167" REF="000857_0172_0FABB245E78E9640"/>
down from Heaven, and every present it has to send thither, is a joy to love. This is the mes∣sage that both speak, <HI>happy soul, thou lovest, and art beloved.</HI> It catches at all opportunities to send up Messages of Love, and knoweth no fitter Mes∣senger to send by, than by the hand of Duty; e∣very duty is dispatched with this superscription, <HI>The tribute of love.</HI></P>
<P>Love is the spring that sets all our wheels a go∣ing, the <HI>womb</HI> in which all our works are formed; the <HI>fire</HI> in the heart, that vents it self in our words and ways. <HI>The fire kindled; then spake I with my tongue.</HI> Love is to a Saint, what <HI>malice</HI> is to Sa∣tan; that which gives force to all his actings. Sa∣tans temptations are called <HI>fiery darts</HI>; and this not only because they are headed, and barbed with fire: as poysoned arrows, they burn where they hit; they set sin on fire, they set the soul on fire? burning with lust and wickedness, but because they are winged with fire, and forced with fire; the bullet is fired out of the Gun, and thence it flies so fiercely. 'Tis the malice of Satans heart, that fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es out all his darts. What malice doth with Satan, that doth love with Saints. It sets the heart in a flame of holy zeal and activity for God, Jer. 20.9. <HI>Thy word was in me as fire,</HI> (it hath kindled a fire there) <HI>I was weary with for∣bearing.</HI> An heart of love is weary, not of action, but of idleness. <HI>Weary with forbearing,</HI> not with doing; never weary of doing much, ever weary of doing nothing <HI>O God, my heart is fixed, my
<PB N="168" REF="000857_0173_0FABB2469B754818"/>
heart is fixed,</HI> saith the Psalmist, <HI>I will sing &amp; give thanks.</HI> Love will add, O God, mine heart is <HI>fier∣ed,</HI> my heart is fiered; there's a flame kindled; mine heart burneth in holy desires and zeal for thee; and where love hath set the heart a burn∣ing, the heart will set the hand a working and the feet a running.</P>
<P N="2">2. He that loves, will praise whom he loves. Praise is comely, and praise is a pleasure to the upright in heart. 'Tis the delight of love, to be speaking of the perfections, of the virtues, of the beauties, of the excellencies of her beloved. The Spouse in the Book of <HI>Canticles,</HI> whose whole lan∣guage is a love, her heart is so full, that her lips overflow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the mention of the excellencies of Christ: <HI>My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand</HI>: His head is fine gold, his eyes Doves eyes, his cheeks a bed of spices, his lips are lilies, his hands are gold rings, his legs pillars of marble, his countenance excellent, his mouth sweet, yea, he is altogether lovely; this is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> Cant. 5. <HI>Who is a God like unto thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, in the City of our God. Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the hea∣vens, thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds. Thy righteousness is like the great mountains, thy judgment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are a great deep. How excellent is thy loving kind∣ness, O Lord? therefore the sons of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings. I will speak of the

glorious honour of thy Majesty, and of thy wondrous works▪ the Lord is gracious, and full of compassion, slow to anger, and of great mercy. The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works. Let all thy works praise thee, O Lord; let thy Saints bless thee; let them speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; let them abundantly utter the memory of thy goodness, and sing of thy righteousness.</HI> O my God, thou art all love, all goodness, all grace, all glory: O let thy servant be all praise. Let this heart be an <HI>altar,</HI> and every service a <HI>sacrifice</HI>; let this mouth be a trumpet, and every word a <HI>Psalm</HI>; let my breath be as <HI>incense,</HI> and e∣very member a <HI>censer.</HI> Let all that is within me, my soul, with all its powers; let all that is with∣out me, my body with all its members, shout for joy, and sing forth the high praises of God. This is the voice of Love.</P>
<P>And now you have another excellency of the new heart laid open to your view; <HI>Love:</HI> An heart to love.</P>
<P>Christians, prize this precious grace, prize it, &amp; you will write down this word also among the great and precious promises; and if you would prize it aright, take your estimate of it from its <HI>worth,</HI> and its <HI>want</HI>; as we use to prize Jewels from their

would give all the substance of his house for love, it would be contemned.</HI> The whole world is not of that value, to be a price for love; no, it must come by gift; it's not to be bought for mony; love is worth as much as a <HI>soul</HI>; and that's more than all the world. <HI>What shall it profit a man to win the whole world, and lose his own soul?</HI> Love is as much worth as all Religion; 'tis the soul and the sub∣stance of all Religion; all the Graces, the duties and exercises of it, are only valued according to the love that is in them; What is knowledge, faith, hope, patience, without love? what is pray∣er, fasting, alms, without charity? They are worth nothing, shall I say? nay they are nothing; if I had all knowledge, and all faith, and were all prayer, and all labour, and all suffering, and had not charity, I were nothing. Love is worth as much as <HI>Heaven</HI> is worth, as <HI>Christ,</HI> as God is worth to us. God is love, and God is not, if love be not in us. Dost thou prize thy substance? Is thy house, or thy money, or thy lands, any thing to thee? Dost thou value thy soul? Is Re∣ligion, is Heaven, is Christ, is God himself, of any account with thee? Then prize the love of God; without love, God is no God to thee, Christ is no Christ to thee, Heaven is no Heaven for thee; better thou hadst no soul, no being, than no love.

Prize it according to its <HI>rarity.</HI> Things ex∣cellent are rated something the more for their scarcity; scarcity raises the Market, the Word of God was precious in those days, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3.1. that is, when there was a Famine of the Word, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> there was no open Vision: O were the love of God as precious as 'tis rare! What a spiritless carkass is the Religion of many Professors? what's become of the soul of it? Oh! we freeze in our Duties, we freeze in our Devotions, we are almost frozen out of them all; if we have a Sacrifice lest, what fire is there to offer it up? <HI>The God that answereth by fire, let him be God,</HI> said <HI>Elijah</HI>; the heart that <HI>asketh</HI> by fire, that ascendeth in fire, let that be the heart for God: <HI>Behold the wood and the fire, but where is the Lamb for the Sacrifice?</HI> We may say, Behold the wood and the sacrifice, but where is the fire to offer it up? our Spirits have taken a cold, the ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll of them appears in all our duties. <HI>Rabbi, where dwellest thou?</HI> Love, where dwellest thou? zeal of God, where is thy abode? how many houses must we search? how many hearts must we walk through, ere we find thine habitation?

<P>Oh! how little <HI>kindly warmth</HI> do we find in our spi∣rits? do we feel our hearts working upwards, ascending in our flames? we all pretend to love, but consider, are our hearts making out in their strength after God? We wish well to his Name and Interest, we wish he were ours, we wish our selves his: O! if wishing were loving, what Christians should we be?

<P>Oh how few hearty friends hath Christ in the world! and how little love from these few? so little that we can∣not tell our selves whether it be any thing or nothing; how hard are we put to it?

we love him? and yet at last are still in doubt whether we love him or not</P>
<P>When we love our carnal friends, our Wives, our Children, we can feel that we love them; when we love our Ease, or our Estates, or our Liberties, we can feel that we love them; but our God, we cannot tell whe∣ther we love him or no: How few of us can boldly make our appeal to him, <HI>Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.</HI></P>
<P>Oh how many wounds doth Christ receive in the house of his Friends! how many sleights must he put up? how often when he hath sate down in his own (in the highest) Room, have we said to him, <HI>Give this man place</HI>: Give this Friend, or this business place! and so made him take the lower room?</P>

The World can never come out of season, but Christ is fain to wait his seasons, when he can find us at leisure; if there be any other guest with us, our Lord must wait; <HI>Go thy way for this time, when I have a convenient season, I will send for thee</HI>; how often have we agreed and appointed to meet the Lord at such an hour, in our Chamber, in our Closet, to have converse and communion with him in duty; and if any thing come in to carry us another way, then presently, <HI>I pray thee, have me excused</HI>; or, if we do keep▪ our time, and shut in our selves with the Lord, and sit down to duty, what a multitude of thoughts presently fall a knocking at our doors? and away our hearts go presently with them to the ends of the earth, and leaves nothing but our car∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ass behind with the Lord.

<P>Oh! at what distance are we content to live from the Lord, sometimes for many days together? Our souls &amp; our God are grown strange, and yet we can be mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y and quiet; we can be without the presence of God, and yet never miss it; not a smile from his face, nor a look of love from us to him, and yet no trouble follows: The Sun may be eclipsed, or under a Cloud, and yet no darkness upon our spirits: we do not walk in dark∣ness when we have no light; sorrow and sadness is as far from us, as God is from us; we can warm our selves at our own fires, &amp; rejoyce in the light of our own sparks, as if these were the Sun; we can do as well in a mist, as in the sun-shine; day and night are both alike to us: The Children of the Bride-chamber do not Fast, but can Feast and make merry, when the Bridegroom is ta∣ken from them; their carnal contentments they can make a shift with, to supply the room of their Lord. Can we not sometimes go where our Lord feeds, and never find him? go to pray, or go to hear, or go to a Sacrament, and the Lord never meet us there, and yet can return well enough satisfied? When we thus want communion with God, and [can] want it; where's our love? what love is that which can so well bear the ab∣sence of her Beloved?

<P>Oh how little Conscience it there made of bestowing that on the Lord, which we have bestowed on him! We give and take; we pretend to have given all to God; but are we not often taking away what we have given, and bestowing it elsewhere? Love would have all we have, running into God, and would have nothing run besides; but oh what waste is there made of our time, of our parts, and other Talents, which were they well husbanded, would come to much, and be given to the Lord! when so many days and hours run out, and no account taken of them, on what, or on whom they are consumed; when our eyes, and our ears, and hands, &amp; tongues, which were made for God, the Devil &amp; Lust must so often have the using of them; when back and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elly, and friends and companions, must carry away what should be spent on God and Souls; when what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould be allowed for Religion, and Charity to have the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pending of, must be at the disposure of Pride, Prodiga∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity and Gluttony; when our Prayers, our Fasting, our Preaching and hearing; all our Duties must become sa∣crifices to our Lust, our Idols are suffered to devour the Sacrifices of the Lord; When our pride and fleshly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds must have the offering, and eating of our Sacrifices, his must make our Prayers, and preach our Sermons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd keep our Fasts, and give our Alms, and wear the credit and honour of them as its own Crown; When God is thus robbed, and we let the thief run away with

all, and is never pursued or questioned, Oh! where is our love?</P>
<P>Oh! how little pleasure do we take in the Lord? what a weariness is it to us, to wait upon him? how glad are we when we come [back] from the house of the Lord? When we come off our knees, come out of our Closets? When the Sabbaths are gone, and the new Moons are over, and we make our returns from Heaven to Earth? How much work have we to keep our hearts by the Lord? How do they slink away ere we are aware? And whilst we are in his presence, hovv seldome do we rejoyce in his presence? What hungry meals, what jejune feasts do we make before the Lord? We relish not his Dainties; his Wine is but Lees, his Mar∣row and his fat things, are but leanness to our Souls; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> little love would sweeten every drop, would season eve∣ry morsel that comes from his Table; would make our very Fasts to be pleasant bread: We feed upon the Dish or the Trencher, and not the Mea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; on the Bone, and not the Marrow; Ordinances, and the External Exercises of Religion, are but the bone, or the shell, or the dish, it is God that is the Kernel, the Marrow and Fatness. How little Communion have we with the Lord, in our approaches to him? And how little sweet∣ness do we find in the little we have? Communion is the Pleasure of Love, and Love is the sweetness of Com∣munion, Novv I am vvhere I vvould be. O! hovv amiable are thy Tabernacles? Very pleasant art thou to me, O Lord; that is the voice of Love. Had vve more love, vve should be more spiritual; and spiritual things vvould be more grateful to spiritual hearts: Divine love is like the fire, it ratifies and changes hearts into his ovvn likeness, and then there's svveetness.

<P>What do these hearts below? are they not still below? so cold, such clods of clay, and yet above? so carnal, so sensual, and yet in Heaven? so hungry, and so greedy in sucking the juice of this earth, in taking in its pleasures; so busie in digging out the wealth of the Earth, and search∣ing for its treasures, [hearts] so busie this way, and yet not here? how canst thou say, I am wal∣king with the God of glory, when thou art still worshipping the gods of the Earth?

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. An heart to fear the Lord.</HEAD>
<P>AN heart to fear the Lord. Jer. 32.40. <HI>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</HI> I shall proceed to the opening of this by these steps; I shall shew, 1. That the Lord God is a dreadful God. 2. That the Lord hath put the dread of himself upon the hearts of all the
<PB N="180" REF="000857_0185_0FABB25A1EF9B000"/>
earth. 3. That yet by sin the heart of man is much hardned from the fear of the Lord. 4. That God will recover his honour, and again put his fear into the hearts of his people. 5. What this fear of the Lord is that he will put into them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Lord God is a dreadful God; he is dreadful in the Excellency and Glory of his Ma∣jesty, Job 13.11. <HI>Shall not his Excellency make you afraid, and his dread fall upon you?</HI> His Power is dreadful. <HI>Fear ye not me, saith the Lord? Will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the Sand for the bound of the Sea, by a perpetual Decree, that it cannot pass it; and though the Waves thereof toss themselves, yet they cannot prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it.</HI> Fear ye not me, saith the Lord? He that did this, what can he not do? His wrath is a dread, Jer. 10.10. <HI>At his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the Nations shall not be able to abide his Indignation.</HI> Yea, his Holi∣ness, his Truth, his Righteousness, &amp; all his Name, Deut. 28.58. <HI>That thou mayst fear this glorious and fearful Name [the Lord thy God.</HI>] The Lord God is a dreadful God.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Lord God hath put the dread of him∣self upon the hearts of all the earth. Not the best only, but the worst of the sons of men. <HI>I am a great King, saith the Lord, and my Name is dreadful among the Heathen.</HI> This dread of the Lord breaks forth upon them.</P>
<P N="1">1. From the <HI>impress of God</HI> upon the natures of all men. As the Law, so the Being of God is
<PB N="181" REF="000857_0186_0FABB25B92C66D50"/>
written in their hearts, he hath his Witness in their Consciences. If the Atheists of the Earth could answer all the Arguments from without, proving that there is a God; yet they can never confute their own Consciences. If the works of God do not, their Reins shall instruct them; if they will not see, whether they will or no, they shall feel that there is a God; and where-ever God is felt, he is feared; even when their mouth speaketh proud things, their heart shall meditate terror; and when nothing else is, they shall be a terror to themselves.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is encreased by the <HI>great works of God,</HI> his wonders that he doth in the World; his Thun∣der and his Hail, his Wind and his Waves; his Earth-quakes, make an Earth-quake in hearts.</P>
<P N="3">3. It's further heightned, by <HI>his Judgments</HI> which he executeth on the Earth. The Judg∣ments of God, are God revealing himself from Heaven, against the ungodliness and unrighteous∣ness of men, and do then strike most terror, 1. When he smites <HI>suddenly,</HI> and makes quick work with sinners: as when <HI>Herod</HI> was smote by an Angel of God, <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hu</HI> consumed by fire from God, immediately upon their Sin. Sud∣den strokes shake secure hearts. 2. When he ex∣ecutes <HI>strange</HI> Judgments, makes a new thing, as in the case of <HI>Korah</HI> and his company, he made the Earth to open her mouth upon them, and swallow them up; so he made the flies and the frogs, and the lice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be the Executioners
<PB N="182" REF="000857_0187_0FABB25E4129ED88"/>
of his wrath on <HI>Pharoah.</HI> 3. When he executes <HI>great wrath for little sins,</HI> as men account them; as in the case of <HI>Uzzah,</HI> whom he struck dead for but touching the Ark when it shook 4 When he exercises <HI>great severity on his own,</HI> on those that are near him. If he spareth not his Sons, what will he do with his Enemies? <HI>If these things be done on the green Tree, what shall be done on the dry?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Yet further, By their <HI>Conscience of guilt,</HI> and their binding over to the Judgment to come. <HI>The sin of Judah is written with a Pen of Iron, with a point of a Diamond, it is graven upon the Tables of their heart.</HI> The sin of <HI>Judah</HI> is written; yea, &amp; the sin of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> also, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.15. <HI>Their Con∣science also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing.</HI> And where their <HI>sin</HI> is written, there their <HI>Judgment</HI> is written, which even nature it self will teach, doth inevi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ably follow upon sin; and this is the great dread that is upon them. The very mention of Judgment to come, made a <HI>Fae∣lix</HI> tremble at the face of a poor Prisoner. This is the terror of the Lord, mentioned by the A∣postle▪ 2 Cor. 5.10, 11. <HI>We must all appear before the Judgment-Seat. — Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we perswade men.</HI> Death is said to be the <HI>King of terrors</HI>: and this is the terror of death, <HI>after that the Judgment.</HI> All these, the impress of God upon their hearts, the wonders of God in the world, the vengeance of God executed on sin, the sence of guilt, and of a Judgment to come, do preach to the Consciences of sinners, that <HI>it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="183" REF="000857_0188_0FABB25EC032BC48"/>3. Yet by sin the hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of man is much <HI>hardned from the fear of the Lord.</HI> Sin blinds the eye, and hardens the heart, brings into danger, and puts out of fear. Who in such danger, and yet who so bold as the blind sinner? When the understan∣ding is darkned, the next word we read is, <HI>Past feeling,</HI> Eph. 4.19. There is included in the very nature of sin, a slighting of God▪ and by once slighting, we learn to slight him more. Slight the command, and you will quickly slight the Curse. Laugh at duty, and 'twill not be long ere you laugh at fear. And when sin hath thus hardned, God will also harden let's the sinner alone, sus∣pends his Judgments, smi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es the sinner with judici∣al blindness, and gives him up to a <HI>Reproba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e mind,</HI> Rom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.28. And when once they come to this, then Hell is broke-loose: For what follows? <HI>ver.</HI> 29. <HI>Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness, and what not,</HI> Psal. 36 1. <HI>The transgression of the wicked saith with∣in my heart, there is no fear of God before his eyes.</HI> Gen 20. When <HI>Abraham</HI> had such a thought, <HI>Sure∣ly the fear of God is not in this place,</HI> what thought he, was there then? Murther, Adultery, Rapes, all manner of Villany. <HI>What sawest thou amongst us, that thou hast done this thing?</HI> What hurt, what evil didst thou see among us? What evil? Evil enough to make me afraid: I thought the fear of God was not here, and there needs no more to make me afraid. Say of any person, <HI>The fear of God is not in this man,</HI> and you therein say, <HI>The
<PB N="184" REF="000857_0189_0FABB25F684AC9F0"/>
Devil is in him</HI>; here dwells sin, and all manner of wickedness.</P>
<P>Say of any place, <HI>The fear of God is not in this place,</HI> and if you find it an <HI>Egypt</HI> or <HI>Sodom</HI> for a∣bominations, you will not wonder, Psal 19 9. <HI>The fear of the Lord is clean</HI>; that is, not only, <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liter,</HI> but <HI>effective,</HI> it cleanseth: Where this is not, every unclean thing may dwell. The rea∣son why this world is such a world as 'tis, such a wicked world, such a treacherous, deceitful, un∣godly world; why there is so little Faith, or Truth or Mercy, or Charity, or Sobriety, is, Because there is so little of the fear of God. Sin hath cast out fear, and this hath brought forth sin in abundance. The Law is nothing, Threatnings are nothing, Conscience is nothing, God is no∣thing to men, because he is not their fear. Wick∣edness is as righteousness, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as honesty, pro∣digality, debauchery, as temperance and sobriety; yea, and hath gotten the start of it: it faceth the Sun, it lifts up the head, it wears the Garland; it paints it self Vertue, Generosity, Gallan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry, the beauty and ornament of the World, where the fear of God is departed.</P>
<P>God may promise, threaten, command, <HI>Heark∣en to my voice, turn at my reproofs, cast away your transgressions:</HI> Awake from your wine, be chaste, sober, be humble; let your merriment be turned into mourning your jollity into heaviness.

thus once and twice, and ten times, but is not re∣garded; his words have no weight, his counsels have no credit, his warnings are of no value with hardned, fearless hearts. If the Devil speak but once, he is heard; if Lust speak but once, 'tis o∣beyed; if a proud companion speak but once, he is followed, whilst the word of the God of glory is made a reproach and a scorn. O the intollera∣ble contempt that's poured out upon the Most High, by men that fear not God: Make thy pro∣mises, and give thy gifts to whom thou wilt; give Grace, and give glory where thou pleasest; the world for me; my Pleasures, mine Honours, my Liberty for me; this world for me, look after the other who will Let the Lord threaten, let the day of the Lord come; let it hasten that we may see it, let the Almighty do his worst, I will not hearken nor turn. This is the blasphemy of hard∣ned, fearless hearts.</P>
<P N="4">4 God will recover his Honour in the hearts of his People. He will put his fear in their hearts, whilst others are hardned, they shall tremble; whilst others kick, they shall stoop; whoever de∣spise me, of these will I be had in honour.</P>
<P N="5">5. What this fear of the Lord is, that he will put into their hearts. The fear of God is taken in Scripture.</P>
<P N="1">1. Sometimes more <HI>largely,</HI> as it comprehends all Religion. <HI>Job</HI> was said, <HI>Chap</HI> 1. to be a man fearing God, that is a godly man; but in this sense I shall not here speak of it.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="186" REF="000857_0191_0FABB260D7EBE6C0"/>2. Sometimes more <HI>strictly,</HI> as a distinct grace, as di∣stinguished from Faith, Love, Hope, and other graces of the Spirit. And being taken in this sense, there are these two things included in it.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A Reverence of God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. An Abhorrence of evil for God's sake.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. A reverence of God To fear God, is to have the awe of God abiding upon the heart, to be under a sense of the Majesty and Glory of the Lord, shining forth in all his Attributes, especially in his Holiness and Omnis∣cience; the glory of his Holiness; and the sense of such an holy eye upon the soul, strikes it with dread and con∣sternation. This is exprest in Scripture, by <HI>Sanctifying the Lord</HI> in the heart, <HI>Levit.</HI> 10.3. <HI>I will be sanctified in them that draw nigh me.</HI> Isa 8.13. <HI>Sanctifie the Lord of Hosts himself, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</HI> There is mention in Scripture of a <HI>Sanctify∣ing of God,</HI> and a <HI>justifying of God.</HI> As God doth justifie and sanctifie his people, so they are to justifie and san∣ctifie God. These two, the justifying and sanctifying of God, though they be much the same; yet there is some difference betwixt them: To sanctifie God, is to reve∣rence him in our hearts, and to represent him in the glo∣ry of his Holiness before men. To justifie God, suppo∣seth a sinful judging, and foolish charging of God in the hearts of men, and is our vindicating of him from such charges. Is God righteous? How is it then that he is so partial in his dealings with the righteous and unrigh∣teous? that he deals worse with those that fear him, than with those that fear him not? Is God good? How is it then that he is so hard, not only in imposing, but inflict∣ing such hard things upon his own? Is God true? How is it then that he fails his people so often, when he hath said, I will never fail them nor forsake them? Our flesh hath failed, and our heart hath failed, yea, and our God
<PB N="187" REF="000857_0192_0FABB261EC485590"/>
hath often failed us too; we have often called, and have had no answer; we have often trusted, and have had no deliverer. Yet God is righteous, yet God is good, yet God is true; he hath not been unrighteous, he hath not been an hard Master, he hath not failed nor forsaken; this is to justifie God.</P>
<P>Our justifying of God, hath some kinds of resemblance with Gods justifying of us. Gods justification of us, stands in his not imputing sin to us, and accepting us as righteous; and our justifying of God, stands in our not imputing evil to him, and our acknowledging him to be true, just and good. God hath justified me from my sins, and that's enough to proclaim him good and faith∣ful, whatever his other dealing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be: Let him afflict me, let him chastifie me, since he will not judge me, nor con∣demn me with the world. God hath justified himself in my Conscience. I have found that the Lord is gracious, I have found that God is faithful; he hath said he will not, and I must say he hath not forsaken: He hath not failed, when he hath most failed me; when he hath been farthest off from my help, he hath even then been a pre∣sent help in trouble: He hath answered, when he hath been most silent; he hath been most good, when he hath been most hard. I have never found more sweet, than in his bitter Cup. I must judge my self, not my God: I have sinned, I have sinned against him, and therefore I must justifie him when he speaketh, and clear him when he judgeth. Hold thy peace querulous heart, be silent all the earth before the Lord, for <HI>truly God is good to</HI> Israel, <HI>and to them that are of a clean heart.</HI> There be few among the worst of <HI>sinners,</HI> but if Conscience might be suffered to speak, it would justifie God. 'Tis Lust that quarrels, not Conscience; 'Tis vain to serve the Lord, and what profit is there to keep his Ordinan∣ces. His wayes are unequal and hard, his promise fails,
<PB N="188" REF="000857_0193_0FABB262C4E34438"/>
take one time with another, oftner than 'tis made good. Who is it that plagues and disappoints, and crosseth and vexeth us? This evil is of the Lord, why should I wait on the Lord any longer? Nay, whom doth he punish more than those that are nearest him? Who hath sorrow, who hath trouble in the flesh, who are reproach'd, scorn'd, hunted up and down the World but these? This they may thank God for, and their following of him 'Tis better being the servant of sin, than the ser∣vant of Christ. Thus <HI>Lust</HI> blasphemes. But speak <HI>Con∣science,</HI> Is God unrighteous? Is God false of his word? Are the pleasures of sin better than the gain of godliness? Have the children of this world made a wiser choice than the children of light? Speak sinner, let thy Con∣science speak whether it be thus or no. God hath not left himself without witness in the hearts of sinners, much more with his Saints, when they do speak their hearts, speak good of his Name. But this by the way.</P>
<P>To return to the matter in hand. To sanctifie God, is especially to reverence him in the heart; to have such an high, an holy and honourable esteem of him, as commands an awe upon the heart; and that</P>
<P N="1">1. At all times: <HI>My son, be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long.</HI> [My son] 'Tis not only for slaves, but for Sons to fear. [Be thou in the fear of the Lord] 'Tis not only, Let the fear of the Lord be in thee, habi∣tually in thy heart; but actuate, and stir up this holy fear, keep up an holy awe, a deep sence of God alwayes upon thee; let the fear of the Lord be before thine eyes; be possessed and swallowed up of this fear [all the day long] where-ever thou art, with whomsoever thou hast to do, remember thou hast still to do with God. A Christi∣an should stand always <HI>pro tribunali</HI>; every day should be as the last day, the day of judgment to him. <HI>So speak ye, and so do, as those that shall be judged, James</HI> 2.12,
<PB N="189" REF="000857_0194_0FABB265F7CB9D78"/>
The Judge stands at the door, yea and thou mayst see him through every window, yea, through e∣very wall; every wall is a window, through which God may see, and be seen. A Christian, (when he is as he should be) cannot wink God out of sight; can look no where, but he beholds that eye that strikes an awe upon his spirit.</P>
<P>This abiding reverence of God, what an influ∣ence will it have upon the whole course? we shall then serve God <HI>acceptably</HI>; when we fear, we shall please God: <HI>That we may serve God (acceptably) with reverence and godly fear.</HI> We shall then serve God universally in every thing. When we fear, we shall watch unto every duty, against every sin, Gen. 42.18. <HI>This do, and live, for I fear God,</HI> said <HI>Joseph</HI> to his brethren; as if he should have said, Do not you fear to find falshood or any evil deal∣ing from me, for I fear God. I dare not be false to you; you may trust me, you may take my word, for I fear God. We shall then walk be∣fore the Lord steadily. When we fear, we shall fix, and hold in an even frame and course. Fear will be our Ballast, whilst Love fills our Sails, Fear will Ballast our Vessel. How are slight and fro∣thy spirits, tossed up and down? Whither do they wander? How many hearts, and faces, &amp; frames have they every day? What contradictions are they to themselves? The reverence of God upon them, would fix them, and hold them in a more even and equal poise. We should then serve the Lord more <HI>honourably.</HI> When we fear, we shall
<PB N="190" REF="000857_0195_0FABB2661BABADE0"/>
shew forth the vertues of God before the world; so much of the reverence, so much of the holi∣ness of God upon us. The presence of a Christi∣an walking in the fear of the Lord, is as the pre∣sence of God; the reverence of <HI>God</HI> upon his heart, casts a beam of Divine Majesty into his face, and oftentimes begets an awe and reverence of him in the hearts of the worst of sinners; they reverence, even whilst they revile and perse∣cute him.</P>
<P><HI>John Baptist,</HI> who was a man of a just, holy, austere life; 'tis said of him, Mark 6.20. That <HI>He∣rod feared him, and observed him.</HI> The austerity and holiness of his life, commanded a respect from an <HI>Herods</HI> heart.

<P N="1">1. <HI>The wrong of God.</HI> The great &amp; only wrong of <HI>God,</HI> is sin. Sin is the <HI>turning away</HI> of the heart from God. The great thing in all the world which God respects, and requires as his own, is <HI>Hearts. My son give me thine heart. Keep thine heart with all diligence,</HI> Prov. 4.23. Keep thine heart, that is, keep it for me; keep it clean for
<PB N="193" REF="000857_0198_0FABB26F23C1D2E8"/>
God, and keep it safe for <HI>God</HI>; see that it be not defiled nor carried away. When the heart's gone, all's gone with it. If the world hath gotten hearts, if Satan hath gotten hearts, let them take all, saith God; let me have either an heart, or nothing; and all they are like to have, that have the heart. The heart where ever it goes, carries all with it. Where we bestow our hearts, we bestow all that we have. Sin is the <HI>turning away</HI> of the heart. This is the very nature of sin, The hearts departing from the living God, Heb. 3.12 And therefore this is the great wrong of God There is but one thing in the world that God re∣spects, and this sin steals away.</P>
<P>Sin is the <HI>insurrection</HI> and rebellion of the heart against God; it turns from him, and turns against him; it runs over to the Camp of the Enemy, and there takes up arms against God. Sin is a running from God, &amp; a fighting against God, it would spoil the Lord of all the Jewels of his Crown. It op∣poseth the <HI>Soveraignty</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> A sinful heart would set up it self in Gods Throne, it would be King in his stead, and have the command of all. Sinners would be their own gods; <HI>Our tongues are our own, who is Lord over us?</HI> God shall not be God, where sin is gotten up as Lord. It assaulteth the <HI>wisdom</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> Vain man would be wise, wiser than his Maker. It charges the Lord with folly, and proclaims it self the only wise. Sinners pre∣tend to know how to chuse for themselves, and order themselves to their advantage, better than
<PB N="194" REF="000857_0199_0FABB14C74CB7CD8"/>
<HI>God.</HI> If God would let me alone to my self, to be at mine own finding, at mine own ordering, it should quickly be better with me. If every thing might be with me, as I would have it, my case would be well mended from what 'tis now, that every thing must go as God will have it. All our quarrellings at Providence, all our murmurings and discontents at our Lot, are our hearts charging the Lord with folly. It casts di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> on the <HI>holiness</HI> of God, it disparages the <HI>goodness</HI> of God; it abuseth mercy, violates his Justice, despi¦ses his Power. In sum, it disgraceth the Throne of his glory, and layes his honour in the dust; sets the Almighty below the lowest of his crea∣tures.</P>
<P>Every companion shall be respected more than God; every pleasure shall be loved more than God; the Devil shall be feared more than <HI>God.</HI> Where is his love? Where is his fear? Where is his honour? Nay, where were the Lord, might sin carry it? Sin is the wrong of God, and this wrong is the especial Object of this abhorrence. A gracious heart would do no wrong, he would not wrong his Neighbour, he would not wrong his Servant, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Enemy, no not his Beast that he possesses. But oh! should I wrong my <HI>God</HI>? Hath he ever done me any wrong? Hath he not been just to me? Yea, hath he not been ever good to me? Kind, pitiful, patient, bountiful?

world? What Father, what Portion, what Hope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but the Lord? What were I, What had I, but vanity, but wo and misery, had I not a <HI>God? I</HI> cannot wrong my God, but I wrong my self, Prov. 8.36. <HI>He that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul.</HI> But if I did not, if my Arrows would not recoil, could I go out with all this injury, &amp; suffer nothing by it: Yet he is God whom I wrong; he is holy, he is righteous, he is good, he is glorious, he is excellent; he only is God, and shall I be injurious to him? He is worthy, he is worthy of all that I have, of all the service I can do, of all the respect I can give, of all the praise I can offer up; if I had a thousand tongues, if I had a thousand hands, if I had a thousand lives, if I had a thousand souls, if I had all the Earth for an offering to the Lord, all would be nothing to shew forth the praise that is due to his Name, as he is God, and I his creature: and when I owe so much, and have nothing to pay, shall I steal from him? shall I rise up against him? <HI>Wast thou not afraid to lift up thy hand against the Lords Anointed?</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1. Shall I not be afraid to lift up mine hand against the Lord himself? to kick against God? Oh the Lord forbid? what art thou O my soul? What servest thou for?

is thy loss, and more thine than his; though (no thanks to thee) the Lord will be no loser at last, when sinners have done their worst; he can get up his Honour out of Dishonour, he can recover his spoils out of the ashes; if he had lost all the world, he had lost nothing, he is all things in himself. When Earth and Hell have spent all their malice, God will be God, holy, wise, glorious, blessed for ever▪ Though such be the malignity of sin, that it would not give over, till God ceaseth to be God; yet God is above, too high for sin to reach; its Darts fall short of its mark; God cannot, God will not sit down a loser by all that sin can do.</P>
<P>But what dost thou suffer, what dost thou lose that sin∣nest against God? The carnal world understand not what, nor would make much reckoning of it, did they understand it. The loss of two-pence goes oftner near∣er them, than the loss of God. But now a Christian knows no other fear, fears no other loss; let God be se∣cure, and all is well, Sin will be the wrong of God, and the loss of God; it may be a total and eternal loss for ought he knows, at least if not assured; God lost, is the soul lost, the Kingdom lost; this is Hell, the loss of God. Better have no being; better be a Dog or Toad, than a man without a God; or if he be not utterly lost, yet to his present sence, 'twill be all one as if he had no God; his peace is lost, his comfort is lost, and his soul is often given for lost, from whom God is departed; though but for a season; he can take pleasure in nothing, he can find rest no where, whose God is out of sight. He knows not what a God mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who can spare him t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath or Judgment. A Christian cannot live a day without him; 'tis night, 'tis all dark, he knows no day while the Sun is set upon him, How grievous do they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd this loss, who have proved what it is? <HI>What wilt thou do for me, whilst I go childless</HI>? What can be done
<PB N="197" REF="000857_0202_0FABB1515B06A7C8"/>
for me, whilst I go fatherless? here is my house, here are my friends, and my lands, but where is my God? <HI>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me</HI>? now I see what this earth is without an heaven; now I see what ease, pleasure, and carnal friends are, and how little they can do for me; yea, what is Prayer? what are Sabbaths? what are Sermons, Sacraments, Promises, whilst God looks not down? Oh I was wont to meet with God here! these glasses were my windows into Heaven; and then how pleasant were they to me? Sabbaths were a delight, the Word was a Treasure, Sacraments were the clusters of <HI>Canaan.</HI> But now, now all's dark and dry; Ordinances are <HI>Wells without water</HI>; Promises are <HI>Breasts without Milk</HI>; Ministers are <HI>Stars without light:</HI> On the Stars are but Clods, whilst the Sun is a Cloud to me; wo is me, <HI>I had a God.</HI></P>
<P>I am pained, I am pained, my head is sick, my heart is faint, my bowels are turned, my liver is poured out, the light of mine eyes is gone from me. I am weary of my groaning, I am full of tossings and turnings there is no soundness in my flesh, no rest in my bones, while my soul says daily to me, <HI>Where is thy God</HI>? And if the sence of this loss worketh such grief, what wonder if the hazard of it worketh fear? Now sin divides, breaks the peace, makes God and the soul two; sin alienates, breeds a distance and estrangement betwixt God and the soul. That soul can either not see him at all, or not as a friend whom sin hath drawn away. Sin will either cloud the face of God, or clothe him with fury; will cause him either to turn his back upon the soul, or set his face a∣gainst it. He that knows what 'tis to enjoy God, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l dread his loss: He that hath seen his face, will fear to see his back; he loves, and therefore would not lose.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>His tenderness of his Honour.</HI> The Honour of God is very tender to him, he will not lose a tittle of it, Jer. 48 8. <HI>My glory will I not give to another, nor my praise to graven Images. I</HI> will not, and look you to it, that you do not give away my glory. What was the reason that God dealt so severely with <HI>Eli</HI> and with <HI>Merod</HI>? What was <HI>Eli's</HI> sin? Why, that he gave away the Honour of God to his Sons? 1 Sam. 2.29. <HI>Thou honourest thy sons above me.</HI> He was so tender to his sons, that though they were become sons of <HI>Belial,</HI> and dealt so wickedly before the Lord, yet they must be dealt gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly with; <HI>Nay, my sons, it is no good thing that I hear of you.</HI> Such a slight reproof must serve in so dreadful a case; he was afraid to displease his sons by a sharper reproof; this the Lord interprets an honouring of his sons above him. In∣dulgent Parents, stand and tremble, you that can see your children sin, and let them go out with a <HI>Nay my sons,</HI> it is not good; a slight or cold reproof; this is no other but your honouring your sons above your God.

The wrath of a King is as the roaring of a Lyon; when the Lyon roareth, the Beasts of the field tremble: what then are the terrors of the Lord? The <HI>threatnings</HI> of the Lord are terrible, Psal. 50.22 <HI>Consi∣der this, ye that forget God, lest he [tear you in pieces] and there be none to deliver.</HI> Hos 5.14 <HI>I, even I, will tear and go away.</HI> Tearing, and tearing in pieces, the very expectation of it is enough to tear the heart in pieces. I will tear them, saith God; I my self will do it, [I even I] will tear. It's terrible to be torn of men, or of wild beasts; but take heed of Gods tearing, I will tear [in pieces] I will not tear off their hair, or their garments, or their ornaments; I'le tear their flesh from their bones, limb from limb, yea soul from body; I'le tear them in pieces. I will tear them [and go away,] tear them, and leave them; wound and not heal; <HI>I</HI> will tear them, and deliver them who can; yea, I will tear them, and trample upon them, <HI>Isa.</HI> 63.3. <HI>I will tread them in mine an∣ger, &amp; trample them in my fury.</HI> Trampling notes contempt and indignation. <HI>I will make them as the dirt in the streets</HI>; the mark of my scorn and fury.</P>

behold the Monuments of his fury there. <HI>Go to Shiloh</HI> (saith God) <HI>and see what I did to it,</HI> Jer. 7.12.

This jealous God, this terrible God, is the God that his people fear; and they therefore fear him, because he is such a jealous God. <HI>Who would not fear thee, thou King of Nations? Who can stand before thee when thou art angry? My flesh trembles for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgments.</HI></P>
<P>Christians, Let none say, this fear is not the fear of his Children; this be to his Enemies and Slaves, not his Children; Fear ye not their fear. But are not all these things written for our learning? Is this written only for their sakes? Or saith he not also for our sakes? For our sakes no doubt this is written, saith the Apostle in ano∣ther case. Consider that full Scripture to this purpose, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.6. to the end of <HI>v.</HI> 12 <HI>Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted; neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them, as it is written, The people sate down to eat and drink and rose up to play. Neither let us commit fornicati∣on, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of Serpents. Neither mur∣mure y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the Destroyer. Now all these things happened unto them for examples, &amp; they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come. Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.</HI></P>
<P>Mark, these things are our examples. Are they exam∣ples to us, and not warnings too? Are they warnings to

us, and must we not by them learn to fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and beware? Let him that thinks he standeth, take heed lest he fall. My Soul standeth in a sure place, my mountain is so strong, that I shall never be moved. I am safe enough: I am in Christ, and shall not come into condemnation. But what ever thou thinkest, as sure as thou thinkest thou standest, take heed, take heed lest thou fall; that this is, not only into the same sins, but into the same condem∣nation; that's the sense of the place, <HI>Rom</HI> 11.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. <HI>Be∣cause of unbelief, they were broken off; thou standest by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear.</HI></P>
<P>No need of fear? No need of threatnings? What may we burn half our Bibles? Can we spare so great a part of what is written? Have we out-grown the use of judgment, as soon as ever we are partakers of mercy? Have we out-grown the use of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourge, as soon as e∣ver we are entred into Christs School? Do we find all too little, Mercies. Threatnings, Judgments, to keep our hearts in order? And yet is it more than needs? There are two Parties in us; we are flesh as well as spirit, and must not the flesh be frighted? Will Love prevail with lust? This salve sure, this son of the Bond-woman, must be kept in awe. Hath God no wanton children, no rebel∣lious children? And must these have no other Discipline, but stroakings and dandlings?</P>
<P>Believe it Christians, God will not have his terrors lost, nor lost to you; God will sometimes make his children feel, that he is a terrible God. He is <HI>Terrible out of his holy place.</HI> Beware you be not presumptuous children. There is a threefold Presumption. A Presumption upon Temptation, in confidence of strength. Upon sin, in con∣fidence of Mercy. Upon sin in contempt of Mercy and Justice.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A Presumption upon Temptation, in confidence of strength.</HI> Some unwary souls, not knowing what spirit they
<PB N="202" REF="000857_0207_0FABB15D0544A200"/>
are of, supposing themselves too hard for the De∣vil, will be venturing within his reach; as if they would dare him to try his skill and power; who having forgotten this Prayer, [<HI>Lead us not into temptation</HI>] put themselves into the Tempters hand; the falls of such will teach them to under∣stand their folly.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Presumption on sin, in confidence of Mercy.</HI> And that either in confidence of Mercy already <HI>obtain∣ed</HI>; I am in Christ, and my sin shall not separate me from him; whatever I do, I have a pardon in my hand. Or in hope <HI>of mercy at last</HI>; I have to do with a merciful God, and therefore may venture on a little farther: hereafter I will repent, and, then I need not doubt of remission.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Presumption on sin, in contempt of Mercy and Justice.</HI> I will have my sin, though I never find mercy. I will have my will and my way, &amp; run the hazard of what follows: I will take my course, and come on me what will.</P>
<P>This last sort, who presume to sin in contempt of Mercy and Judgment; who are so drunken with their sensual delights, and given over to the hardness of their hearts, that they neither value Mercy, nor fear Wrath: <HI>What do you talk to me of Mercy and Judgment to come? Give me my pleasures, and my liberties, and my mirth, and my money: think not to make me such a fool, to let go the pleasure and comfort of my life, for I know not what uncertain fears or hopes.</HI> Such as these have one foot already in Hell. If it be not yet thus with thee, thou darest
<PB N="203" REF="000857_0208_0FABB161674AB740"/>
not contemn either Mercy or Judgment; beware thou be not presumptuous neither in the former sense. Be not bold upon temptations; think not that thou art strong to overcome a temptation, when thou art so weak as not to fear it; he that fears not a temptation, understands not it, or him∣self. But especially beware thou presume not up∣on sin, in confidence of Mercy. Grow not over∣bold upon Love or Patience; <HI>Laesa patientia sit furor.</HI> God loves me, therefore I may be bold to take the more liberty, the less care, the less watch∣fulness, the less fear, because so much Love! Spit in thy Fathers face, because he weeps over thy neck! Smite him on the face, because thou hopest he will not strike again! Tear his bowels, because they are so tender towards thee! Be froward, stub∣born, wanton and idle, because thou hast found him so indulgent.</P>
<P>Christians consider, whether such wickedness hath not sometimes been found in some of our hearts. But take heed, you will find, though he be a tender, yet he will not be a fond Father; where he loves, he will be feared. Some as bold and as confident as you, have felt to their cost what '<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>use pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ience, and kindness; his Ar∣rows in their hearts, his Terrors in their souls, hath made them to know, that <HI>the God of love is a terrible God.</HI> And look to it, if thou wilt yet ad∣venture, wilt be a wanton still, froward, or idle, or heedless still, he will either lash thee into better manners, or cast thee out as no child of his, but
<PB N="204" REF="000857_0209_0FABB161E5903DD0"/>
a Bastard and Rebel. If thou wilt not take war∣ning by others, take heed lest he make thee a warning to them which shall come after.</P>
<P>Christians know, that though God be tender of his Saints, yet he is jealous for his Name; he tenders them as the apple of his Eye, but not a∣bove the least tittle of his Honour. As God will have us love our Neighbour, so he will love his child, but <HI>as himself</HI>; First himself, and then his child. He will not bate an <HI>Iota</HI> of his glory, to save a world. As little offences <HI>done to</HI> his little ones, so little sins <HI>allowed by them,</HI> are as <HI>Mill stones about the neck.</HI> If they allow it in themselves, yet Heaven and Earth shall pass away, and fall to nothing, ere he allow it in them. God will not, and therefore his children dare not indulge them∣selves in little sins. They therefore fear, because he whom they serve is a jealous God.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Their own ingenuity.</HI> This fear is from Love and good Nature, and is most properly the fear of children. Children fear, because God is jea∣lous, and so do Slaves; but only Children because God is good. Children fear, because they love; Slaves fear, although they hate. Children fear to be <HI>unworthy</HI>; Slaves only to be <HI>unhappy</HI> and mise∣rable. There's nothing more contrary to an in∣genuous nature, than to abuse goodness and kind∣ness; to abuse goodness, hath as black an aspect with him, as to provoke wrath. Hos. 3.5. <HI>They shall fear the Lord and his [goodness] in the latter dayes.</HI> But how can goodness be the Object of
<PB N="205" REF="000857_0210_0FABB1629C8A2ED0"/>
fear? We fear evil and not good. The meaning is, they shall fear to wrong or abuse goodness: They shall fear to wrong the Lord, because he is good. [In the latter dayes.] These latter dayes that this Promise refers to, shall be days of more grace; wherein there shall be, not only a more <HI>clear revelation</HI> of the goodness of God; they shall know the Lord and his goodness; but a more <HI>plentiful communication</HI> and diffusion of the good∣ness of God; they shall love the Lord and his goodness: They shall see themselves both more <HI>obliged</HI> by goodness, and shall feel themselves more <HI>seasoned</HI> with goodness. By grace they shall be better natured. Religion doth not make <HI>morose,</HI> but more <HI>generous,</HI> free and ingenuous. There's nothing more abhorrent to an ingenuous spirit, than to be base and unworthy. Abuse of good∣ness is an unworthiness, which an ingenuous na∣ture abhors as death to be guilty of; 'tis its de∣struction, 'tis disingenuity. The abuse of the goodness of God, is great unthankfulness; and unthankfulness is great disingenuity.</P>
<P><HI>Ingratum si dixeris omnia dixeris.</HI> Call me un∣thankful, and you call me all that's naught. Call me any thing else but unthankful. Indeed, were I all thanks, I should be still unthankful; I should still be behind hand with the goodness of the Lord; my debt is greater than I can pay; yea greater than I can acknowledge; but shall I re∣turn evil for his good? If I cannot pay, should I deny my debt? He that is unthankful, whatever
<PB N="206" REF="000857_0211_0FABB163635AE358"/>
God requires of him, saves wickedly, This is more than I owe thee. God I owe thee nothing, I care not for thee. Oh this is dreadful to a gra∣cious heart.</P>
<P>If this be in sin (for all sin is unthankfulness) if this be sin, if this be the signification of all my neglects of God, and my duty to him; then the Lord forbid, whatever I suffer, that I should yield to sin. How shall I do this wickedness? How shall I neglect this duty, and sin against God? How should I look my God, or my own soul in the face, should I be so unworthy? For thy sake, Lord, let me not sin against thee; thou art good, thou art kind, thou art gracious, thou art holy; O let me not be a Devil; what heart, where a Devil is not, but such goodness will charm it into love? Shall I sin? shall I re∣bel? For thy sake, Lord, I will not do it; I will not for mine own sake; for where then shall I appear? In sinning against God, I sin against mine own soul; I dare not for my life; Sin and Death, Sin and Hell are link'd together; but were it not so, might I sin and escape, sin and not dye, yet for thy sake, Lord, I will not do it: Thou art good, good in thy self, good to me; thou art my God, thou art my Father; love, care, tenderness, compassion, kindness, is all that is in thine heart towards me; what I am, what I have, what I hope for, that I breathe, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I live, all is thy goodness, thy bounty to me.

me, and the Paps that give me suck. I would not to my child, to my servant, to my friend; but oh let me never to my Father, to my God, return <HI>evil for good, and hatred for his good will.</HI> Let not this evil which I fear, ever come upon me; put thy fear into mine heart, O Lord, that I may not sin against thee.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. Obedience in the Covenant.</HEAD>
<P N="7">7. OBedience, Ezek. 36.27. <HI>I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my Sta∣tutes, and ye shall keep my Judgments, and do them.</HI> Obedience is of the <HI>Heart,</HI> or of the <HI>Life.</HI> In this Scripture God undertakes for both.</P>
<P N="1">1. For the obedience of the heart, he under∣takes in the former words, [I will put my Spirit in your heart] where the Spirit dwells, he rules. Where Satan dwells, he rules; and where the Spi∣rit of the Lord dwells, there God rules; the Spirit in the heart, is the Law in the heart. Those two Promises, <HI>I will put my Spirit in your hearts,</HI> and <HI>I will write my Law in your hearts,</HI> signifie the same thing. The Law in the heart is the will of man molted into the will of God. The Law of God may be in the mouth, and the heart a Rebel; its reception into the heart, notes the hearts subjection to it.</P>
<P>The Obedience of the heart includes two things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The opening of the heart to the Word.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The resolution of the heart for the Work of the Lord.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1"><PB N="208" REF="000857_0213_0FABB164E37750B0"/>1. <HI>The opening of the heart to the Word.</HI> What wilt thou have me to do, Lord? That's the voice of an obe∣dient heart. <HI>Veniat verbum &amp; submittemus.</HI> Speak Lord, command Lord, what wilt thou? And when he speaks, whatever it be, the word is embraced and accepted of the heart, <HI>Dan.</HI> 4.27. <HI>Let my counsel be acceptable to thee.</HI> The acceptance of the Word in the heart, is signified by its <HI>hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kening</HI> to it. To hearken, is more than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hear; though they sometimes note the same thing, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> hearing is of the ear, hearkening of the heart. <HI>Psal.</HI> 81.11 <HI>Israel would not hearken, my people would none of me.</HI> They <HI>heard</HI> what the Lord spake, but they would not <HI>hearken</HI> that is, as 'tis there interpreted, they would <HI>none of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord.</HI> They rejected the word of the Lord which h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spake unto them. When the Word is let come in with Authority, suffered to rule in the soul; when the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> gives up it self unto it, then it is accepted; there's its hear∣kening to it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The resolution of the heart for the work of the Lord</HI> Psal. 110 106 <HI>I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous Judgments</HI> I have vowed, and I will perform; I have covenanted, and I am determined to keep thy statutes. <HI>The word which thou hast spoken to us in the name of the Lord we will not do</HI>; that's the rebellious. <HI>Whatsoever the Lord shall speak we will do,</HI> that's the obedient heart.</P>
<P>Where the heart is thus resolved to obey, this is that obedience which shall be accepted unto salvation. Where this resolution is, as there is opportunity, there will be practice; and where there's not opportunity in Gods account, this is it. This is Praying, this is Hearing, this is giving, and feeding, and cloathing, and visiting, this is walking circumspectly, working righteousness, shew∣ing mercy, exercising faith; and patience, and repentance; this is our keeping the commandments of God and walk∣ing in his Statutes; an heart to obey, is our obeying;
<PB N="209" REF="000857_0214_0FABB1659BB0BAD8"/>
an heart to do; is our doing; an heart to suffer in Gods account, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our suffering for his Name.</P>
<P>But here it must be carefully noted, that though sincere resolution for Obedience, be Obedience; yet every resolution is not <HI>that</HI> resolution. Reso∣lution for Obedience is then sincere, where
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. It flows from an inward and rooted incli∣nation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. It's bottomed on a firm belief of Scripture Revelation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. It's built on the highest and weightiest Rea∣sons.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. It's the result of the most mature and deep deliberation.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A sincere resolution flows from an inward rooted inclination,</HI> Psal. 119.112. <HI>I have inclined mine heart to perform thy Statutes.</HI> Our new purpose is from our new nature: It is not produced by some sud∣den fright, or sense of danger; or meerly by a present force of Argument: but by a Divine pow∣er, working the heart to a suitableness to the will and ways of God, and an habitual propension &amp; inclination thereto. Resolution for holiness, with∣out an holy inclination, is a blade without a root; as fresh and as green as it looks, 'twill wither and come to nothing; no Root, no Fruit, nor lasting. The heart is the root of action, and grace is the life of the root: When our Resolutions are the blade sprouting forth of this living Root, then they will abide and bring forth the Ear, and an Harvest.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="210" REF="000857_0215_0FABB1665B6D58D8"/>2. <HI>A sincere resolution is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on a firm Assent to the truth of Scripture Revelation.</HI> A Christian resolves for godliness, because he believes God, that he is as he hath said, <HI>the Rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</HI> He is built on the Scrip∣tures; as his hopes, so his purposes have the foun∣dation of the Prophets and Apostles, on which they stand. Whatever Resolution hath not this Foundation, is but an house upon the Sands.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>A sincere Resolution is founded on the highest Reason▪</HI> Where we resolve without Reason, we will quickly find a Reason to change. Where we resolve we know not why, we shall change we know not how soon. To resolve we know not why, and to resolve on we know not what, will be alike unstable. Though there be Reason for Religion, yet Religion may be taken up with∣out Reason. Whatever Reason there be for it, yet if it be not understood, or considered, 'tis all one as if there were no Reason at all. And if there seem some Reason for it, yet if it be not the highest Reason, when a stronger than it comes we quickly change our purpose.</P>
<P>The Reasons we have for our serving and following God, are the highest of all Reasons; and that whether we respect it as our duty, or our happiness: For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There's none lay such claim to us as God.</HI> Whose am I? Who hath made me? Who hath bought me? 1 Cor. 6.20. <HI>Glorifie God in your bodies and in your spirits, which are his.</HI> Psal. 100.2, 3. <HI>Serve the
<PB N="211" REF="000857_0216_0FABB1675B3C4658"/>
Lord with gladness; for the Lord he is God; it is he that hath made us, not we our selves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.</HI> What reason have you to serve men, or to serve sin or the world? Men think they have reason for it, but what reason? Are any of these gods? Are men your gods? Is sin or the world God? Do you owe your selves to them? <HI>It is he that hath made us, and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e are.</HI> As the Apostle concerning o∣bedience to Parents, much more may it be said here; Children obey your God, for this is right: This is his due, and your duty; if any one can lay as good a claim to you, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him carry you a∣way for servants.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There's none can be better to us than God.</HI> None <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an require, none can reward our obedience I as he▪ Where can you be better than with God? He'l require no more, than that you serve him till you can find a better Master. He that saith, 'tis best to serve sin and the world, is a fool, and hath <HI>said in his heart, there is no God.</HI> If God be God, he is the chief, yea, the only good<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> If any thing in the world, upon what account<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> soever, he thought better than the Lord, that's set up for a God in his room.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Whomsoever we serve, 'tis God must pay us our wages at last.</HI> God is Judge, he is the Rewarde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> both of the evil and the good; both of those that serve him and those that serve him not. If you receive the Lord, he will be your reward; if you serve him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, he will reward you▪ but what
<PB REF="000857_0217_0FABB1682BC16698"/>
reward have you? <HI>These mine Enemies which will not have me reign over them, bring them and stay them before me</HI>; there's their reward. Sin hath its rewards, but what are they but vanity and vexation? Or if they were better, how long will they last? But when sin hath paid the most it can, Oh what a reward is there behind, that God hath to pay you! <HI>This shall ye have of mine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd, ye shall lye down in sorrow.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The wages which God will give, shall certainly be blessed or dreadful, according to our Obedience or Disobedience.</HI> The reward that God hath to give, is an eternal reward; Eternal salvation to them that obey him; everlasting destruction to him that serveth him not.</P>
<P>I have a soul; this carkass is the least part of me; there's another world, a world to come; a few years is the most I have to spend in this; I must abide eternally, eternally in the other world.</P>
<P>How inconsiderable is it, what I have here, whether little or more, better or worse? In a short time that will come all to one. But Oh my Eternity! whats that like to be? Why 'tis God that must determine it, and he will certain∣ly reward every man according to his works, Rom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <HI>Who will render to every man according to his deeds. To th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> which by pati∣ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ontinuance in well doing, seek for glory, honour and immortality, eternal life. But to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that are mention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and obey not the truth, tribulation and,
<PB N="213" REF="000857_0218_0FABB16BDA0E41F0"/>
anguish, &amp;c.</HI> There's glory and shame, mercy and wrath, li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and death set before me; there's no third state, one of the two must be my lot; and this is it that doth determine which, <HI>If I obey, I live; if I disobey, I dye for ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI></P>
<P>Now when my resolution is founded on such reasons as these, than which none can be imagi∣ned higher and more weighty; (till Eternity be∣come of less regard than time; and an immortal soul be set below a perishing body) and when the question being put, Shall I follow God or not? God or the world? God or my lust <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> speak soul, give in thy answer; when this is the answer it gives, Why there's none can lay such claim to me as God; there's none can be as good to me as God; whomsoever I serve, its God must be my Rewarder, my everlasting blessedness, or eternal ruine depends on him, and must be in∣fallibly determined, according to my obedience or disobedience: This is the plain case, Obey &amp; Live; Obey, or dye for ever. And therefore what can I say less or more, but that I am the Lords, and will be his Servant. Let others chuse whom they will serve, as for me, O my soul, serve thou the Lord. This resolution thus foun∣ded, is like to stand.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>A sincere resolution, is the fruit of mat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re dili∣beration.</HI> Deliberation gives Reason its full weight, makes the strength of it appear; it lays all things in the Ballance; it's the comparing of Reasons for, and against; the weighing of Arguments and
<PB N="214" REF="000857_0219_0FABB16EAAFD0CF8"/>
Objections, Encouragements &amp; Discouragements; casting the cost, as well as the gain, particularly. In this deliberation there must be a considering,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. What there is in this Obedience.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. What it is attended with, that may encou∣rage.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There must be a considering, What there is in this Obedience</HI>; or otherwise we resolve upon we know not what. Now there are five things in this Obedience:
<LIST>
<ITEM>Subjection.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Activity and Industry.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Integrity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Circumspection.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Spirituality.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Subjection.</HI> Servants must be subject, must not be at their own wills, but at the will of another: The heart of man naturally affects Dominion; that's the great controversie of sinners with God, <HI>Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall be Lord? We are Lords,</HI> (we would be at least) <HI>we will come no more unto thee,</HI> Jer. 2.31. Obedience yields that God should be Lord; yea, and all others also whom he hath made Lords o∣ver us. The servants of Christ must not be, and yet must be the servants of men; they must not serve the lusts, but must be subject to their righ∣teous Laws and Commands. God must be obey∣ed, and Magistrates, Ministers, Masters, Parents must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in the Lord, and for the Lord; yea, and they must be, when God will have it so, the Ser∣vant of servants.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="000857_0220_0FABB16F80C03320"/>While they must not serve the humours of the greatest, they must serve the necessities of the meanest, must stoop to the lowest of Offices, e∣ven to the washing of the feet of the least Disci∣ple: All this the Lord expects of them, and they must be subject. They must not dispute, but do his will; only it must be considered, that there is a double disputing the will of God. There is a disputing whether that which is pretended to be the will of God, be so or no; this ought to be done: And there is a disputing or questioning that which is granted to be the will of God, whether it be fit to be done, or safe to be done? Is it not better to let it alone? What advantage is there in it? What reason is there for it? No, they must not thus dispute; this is Reason e∣nough, God will have it so. Gods will is ever reason, and it must be our Reason. It's enough for thee to say, <HI>This is that which the Lord hath commanded,</HI> and must I be subject? This is one thing that must be considered, I will obey, but can I be Subject?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Activity and Industry.</HI> The servants of the Lord must be Active and Industrious. Whom he sends into the Vineyard, he sends to work, &amp; not to sleep. The life of a Christian is labori∣ous; whilst others are in their beds, he must be on his knees; whilst others take their pleasure, he must take pains; whilst others take their times, now a little, and then a little, he must sit to it, be ever about his Masters business. An active
<PB N="216" REF="000857_0221_0FABB171F62845E8"/>
spirit, is an excellent spirit, and 'tis necessary in a Christian.</P>
<P N="1">1. An Active spirit, is an Excellent spirit: slug∣gards are the refuse of the Earth.</P>
<P>But here it must be considered, that there is a double Activity, Gracious and Natural.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Natural,</HI> which arises from an innate vigour and vivacity of some mens spirits: There needs not industry in such, to bring forth action; 'tis but leaving nature to its course, and that will flye high enough of it self. It requires more industry to regulate, and sometimes to restrain, than to put forth into Action. Its more labour for them to rest, than to be doing.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Gracious:</HI> Which is either Natural Activity, managed and improved for God, turn'd into a right course, running into a right Channel; or a naturally unactive spirit, raised and quickned by Grace and Religious Industry. This gracious, this holy Activity, this is the Excellency; it is the extract of the spirits and life of all our parts and graces, and will go further, and do more high honour, and more abundant service to God &amp; his Gospel, than is done by a thousand others.</P>
<P>An Active sinner, is by accident the worst of men: How much service for the Devil will he dispatch in a little time?</P>
<P>An Active Sinner is <HI>life and death met together.</HI> He is all life, and yet dead; and the more he hath of death, because so much of life; like poy∣son in Wine, he destroys the more effectually:
<PB N="217" REF="000857_0222_0FADAB87223B9490"/>
Yet the evil is not in his Activity, but in the mat∣ter wherein he is employed; the good mettal, as keens of a Weapon, is its Excellency: but in a mad mans hand, better a wooden than an iron sword. An Active Spirit is so excellent, that it's pity that ever sin should have the using of it; 'twas well for Religion, if the Devil were a Drone, and had no other Servants, but the Slug∣gards of the Earth. But Activity when set right, is of great price in the sight of God, because it sets a great price upon God. Slothfulness puts a slight upon God; when the Scriptures have set forth a <HI>Magnalia Dei,</HI> the great things, and the deep things of God: when the Lord Jes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is e∣vidently set forth as crucified before our eyes, as the Propitiation for sin; when the preciousness of his blood, the tenderness of his bowels, the riches of his Grace, the sufficiency of his righte∣ousness, his satisfaction and pardons, are all held forth in open sight; when the beauties of holi∣ness, the joys of the spirit, that peace which pas∣seth all understanding, are laid forth to view; when the most glorious things are spoken of the City of God, <HI>Jerusalem</HI> which is above; when God in his Word calls to us, Awake sleepers, a∣rise sluggards, see what's before you; all this may be yours, if you will; slothfulness puts this slight upon all. Tush, all this is not worth the breaking my sleep for; 'tis not all worth my labour to seek after; my ease and my quiet is better to me, than God and all his glory.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="000857_0223_0FABB1725B90F220"/>We may best understand the value we put on things, by the pains and the cost we are content to be at, to purchase them. When sinners bestow themselves so upon the world, will bear such la∣bour and travel, are so constantly, so indefatiga∣bly industrious in the pursuance of it; and withal, run such hazards and dangers for it, they make it evident enough what rate they put upon it; he whose time and his strength, whose days and his nights, yea, whose soul, and his hopes, must all be laid out in a purchase, must all go for a piece of a Land, or a little money, or pleasure; we need no other proof, what a bargain he thinks this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ld to be. <HI>I care not much for this world; 'tis a vanity, a shadow, the fashion of it passeth away; I hope 'tis far enough off my heart, however I am charged with greediness after it.</HI> But what then mean all the expences of thy time, of thy strength, of thy spirits, that thou daily layest out upon it? What means so much hunting after, and heaping it up for thy self? What, hast thou been hunting all this while after shadows? Heaping up vanities? No, no, thou mistakest thy self, these shadows are thy substance; these vanities are the God whom thou adorest; if thou didst not prize, thou wouldst not venture so deeply for them.</P>
<P>And so on the other side, when so little is done for God; when any thing must suffice to be spent on souls, or Eternity; what cheap things do we count them! I love God above all, with all my heart, with all my soul; he is all my hope, and all
<PB N="219" REF="000857_0224_0FABB1751097E4F0"/>
my desire: What a miserable creature were I, if it were not for my hope in God? What would all the world be to me, should I lose my soul? But dost thou speak in earnest? Dost thou think what thou speakest? What, and so very a Drone in seeking of God? What, and so indifferent, so cold, and so spiritless in thy enquiries after him, in thy motions towards him? So sparing of thy labour, so negligent of duty, so seldom at it, so soon weary, so many delays, so many excuses: How many times hath God called thee after him, and all thine answer hath been an excuse? An excuse instead of an Ordinance, an excuse instead of a Prayer, an excuse instead of Action, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ex∣cuse instead of Alms, an excuse instead of an Ad∣monition or a Reproof; if he will be served with excuses, he shall have service enough, but little besides. I am weary, or 'tis too late, or 'tis cold, and so a short and hasty Prayer must serve, or none at all. I have much business upon me, a Family, a Farm, and the cares and troubles of it, that I cannot have so much time nor freedom to attend upon God, as others have, and so a Ser∣mon lost, a Sacrament lost. I live amongst ill neighbours, if I should be so froward, and so act∣ive for God, so zealous, and so spiritual in my Discourse, in my Way, I should be but a scoff and a reproach, and it may be a prey to evil men. I want ability to speak to the edification of others, I have not the boldness as others have, to reprove or admonish; I pray thee have me excused. Wise
<PB N="220" REF="000857_0225_0FABB1775A76E700"/>
men indeed, an Excuse instead of a Duty! 'Tis all one, as if when the Lord calls to thee, <HI>Come to me, and be saved,</HI> thy Answer should be, I pray thee excuse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I must to the Devil, and be damned.</P>
<P>But is this thy love? Is this thy zeal? Is this thy valuing of God above all?</P>
<P>Tremble sluggard; whatever excuses thou find∣est out, to substitute in the room of duty, this is that thou canst never excuse, nor acquit thy self of, <HI>a slighting of God.</HI> Thy very excuses will ac∣cuse thee for a slothful servant, and this for a sligh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of God; whilst the Apostle says, <HI>I reckon that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sufferings of this life are not worthy to be com∣pared with the glory that shall be revealed:</HI> But I reckon, sayst thou, that all that glory to come, is not worthy to be compared with the present la∣bour.</P>
<P>But now Activity and Industry puts a great price upon God; this is written upon all our la∣bours, <HI>He is worthy for whom I do all this.</HI> Some of the most humble, watchful, laborious Christi∣ans, do sometimes complain, Oh, I fear I love not God; his Favour, his Honour, is little set by, by me; but whence then is thy care to please God? Whence are all thy labours of love? Dost watch and pray, and work, and run? Canst spend and be spent for God, and yet not love him? Dost live to God, canst dye for God, and yet not prize him? What greater proof canst give of love, than such labour?</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="221" REF="000857_0226_0FABB1779A16E4E0"/>2. Activity is <HI>necessary.</HI> It is a vain thing to think of making any thing of Religion, without it; the work of it is too great to be done by ly∣ing still; the comforts of it lye to deep too be got∣ten out by a wish. There's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> poor man in this world, that would be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>est man in the Country, if riches may be go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n by a wish; he may as soon wish himself into wealth, as thou into grace and comfort. This one thing, mens not being able to bear the labour of Religion, is a Rock, at which many a soul hath split, and suffer∣ed an Eternal Wrack.</P>
<P>He that hath some love to holiness, &amp; yet not so much as to carry him through the work of Holiness, is short of sincerity; and short of since∣rity, short of salvation. He that sticks not at la∣bour, will not stick at suffering: He that slugs at doing, will shrink back from suffering. Say not, There's a Lyon in the streets; overcome the Ly∣on, and you will not fear the Bear. Get over (Difficulties) and there's but one style more (Di∣stress) betwixt thee and glory. Pass the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst, &amp; thou wilt be the more bold to venture the latter. Holy Activity will be a witness of thy sincerity; carry this witness in thine heart, and then which way ever the world does go, and what storms so∣ever may fall, thou wilt have this to uphold thee, <HI>Integrity and uprightness shall preserve me, and Eterni∣ty reward me.</HI> Where sincerity is the root, and holy activity the blossom, an eternal weight of glory shall be the fruit. Lye idle, and all will
<PB N="222" REF="000857_0227_0FABB1785F7C97B8"/>
be lost. Take heed of [<HI>Soul take thine ease</HI>] lest the next word thou hear, be, [<HI>This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall thy soul be required of thee.</HI>]</P>
<P>Well, this is a second thing included in O¦bedience, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and this also must be con∣sidered ere thou resolvest. I will Obey; but can I Labour.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Integrity.</HI> The Obedience which God ex∣pects, must be <HI>entire</HI> Obedience; not only the Obedience of the whole man, but to the whole will of God. <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.8. <HI>Then shall I not be a∣shamed, when I have respect to all thy Command∣ments.</HI> 1 Pet. 1.14, 15. <HI>As obedient children, be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> holy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> (all manner) conversation.</HI> Mat. 28.20. <HI>Tea∣ching them to observe all things, whatsoever I have commanded you.</HI> But of this having spoken more largely elsewhere, it shall suffice to give some short hints.</P>

And this rebellion of the Will, and so of the Passions a∣gainst the Reason, is the great Reason of the souls rebel∣lion against God.</P>
<P>When Conscience hath lost its Authority, Gods Au∣thority is gone. Whilst the Understanding and the Con∣science are maintained in their due Authority, where the Will &amp; Affections are held in their due subjection, there the Lord reigneth. While Conscience rightly inform'd, hath its due, God shall have his due: Where the Will and the Passions have no more than their due, he shall have his own. God shall be will'd the more, where nothing else is will'd too much, God shall be lov'd the more, and feared the more, where nothing else is lov'd and fear'd too much. The more Anger, the more Ha∣tred, the more Grief will be spent upon sin, if it be not inordinately spent elsewhere. Oh how much service might be done, and how much quiet would be enjoyed in the heart, were this Authority and Subjection main∣tained and held up.</P>

<P>Some persons may be found, who have taken up the Profession, and go far in the practice of Godliness, abstaining from gross sins, yea, and making attempts upon the mortification of in∣ward lusts; applying themselves to the duties of Religion, Praying, Hearing, Reading, Medita∣ting, Discoursing of God, and the things of God▪ exercising themselves in the works of righteous∣ness and mercy; being Meek, Temperate, Pati∣ent, and if all this do arise only from the advan∣tages of a good Nature, good Education, good Society or Acquaintance, a powerful Ministry, or the workings of natural Conscience; as possibly it may, and doth not spring forth from such a fixed, well bottomed resolution, it is short of sin∣cerity.

<P N="8">8. <HI>PErseverance.</HI> Jer. 32.40. <HI>I will make an ever∣lasting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</HI></P>
<P>The Perseverance of the Saints, is founded on the Election of God, and the Immutability of his Counsel; <HI>The foundation of the Lord standeth sure,</HI> Rom. 8 38. <HI>Whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</HI> This Golden Chain will hold, not a link of it shall be broken; on whomsoever the first link <HI>Election,</HI> hath taken hold, it will in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allibly bring him up to the last, <HI>Glory.</HI> God is not as man, that he should repent.

<P><PB N="236" REF="000857_0241_0FABB1899AD55AB0"/>There are two sorts of Promises concerning Perseverance. There are Promises

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. The Promise of Eternal Life is made to <HI>Perseverance.</HI> Hold out to the end, and be saved Overcome and reign. <HI>Be faithful to the death, and I will give thee a Crown of life.</HI> Rev. 2.10. <HI>If th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</HI> 1 Chron. 28 9. <HI>If any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</HI> Christians, beware of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ostacy, beware of Presumption; <HI>Pass the time of your so∣journing here in fear.</HI> Let it not be said of you, ye (did) run well.

<P N="2">2. There are Promises of <HI>Perseverance.</HI> The Covenant of God is an everlasting Covenant. He hath commanded his Covenant for ever, <HI>Psa.</HI> 111.5.</P>
<P>There are two things in the fore-mentioned Scripture, <HI>Jer.</HI> 32.40. secured to Believers, which secure their Perseverance.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. God will not depart from them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They shall not depart from him.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. God will not depart from them. <HI>I will not turn away from them.</HI> God is with me, but I fear I shall provoke him away: I shall weary him out by my sins, and drive him from me. No, saith the Lord, I will not turn away from them, to do them good. I will never fail thee, nor forsake thee.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="237" REF="000857_0242_0FABB18A5DFE67E0"/>2. They shall not depart from him. 'Tis true the Lord will be with me, but 'tis only while I am with him; if I depart, he will depart; it I forsake him, he will cast me off for ever. Here's my great fear, that I shall turn away from him; there is in me an evil heart of unbelief, that's e∣ver departing from the living God. Oh this false and fickle heart, I dare not trust it for an hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; I doubt it will be gone ere I am aware; my cor∣ruptions are strong, my temptations are many, every day brings its temptations; and I am in great fear, that by one means or other, one day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other, I shall fall before them, and depart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the living God! No, sayes God, fear not, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hou shalt not depart; <HI>I will put my fear in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earts, that they shall not depart from me. They shall be kept by my Almighty Power, through faith unto salvation.</HI> My grace shall be with them, and my grace shall be sufficient for them, and shall pre∣serve them to my heavenly Kingdom.</P>
<P>And here is the Sain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s security: The Lord God will not turn away from them, nor ever suffer them to run away from him If the Promise fail, then may their faith also fail. It's true, there may be gradual declinings and departures of the Saints from Christ for a season; but total or final there shall not be: They shall not be of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. Though they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all, they shall rise again; they may turn, but they shall return. As Hypocrites will not stay
<PB N="238" REF="000857_0243_0FABB18B1DD2D788"/>
(with) Christ alwayes, so neither will Saints al∣ways stay from him. And there's a like reason of both: Sinners sometimes will step aside, and salute Religion, and take some turns with Christ; but after a while, away they must again: And there is a double reason of it.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. There's that within them that will fetch them back.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. There's one without them that will fetch them back.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. There's that <HI>within them</HI> that will fetch them back. Corrupt nature, the power of unmortified Lust, this is it that bears the sway in their hearts▪ and however for the time, the stream may be somewhat turn'd out of its course, or bay'd up▪ however by the <HI>impetus</HI> of some external Motives or Arguments, or the <HI>impulses</HI> of an awakened Conscience, or some sudden heat of affection, they are carried on after, and in some fair com∣pliance with the Lord Jesus; yet when the Bay is removed, when the external force is spent, Conscience laid to sleep, the heat affection allaid, which is often almost as soon out as in, their very natures will reduce, and bring them back to their old course. What is it that pulls a Stone, or a lump of Clay down again, that that is thrown in∣to the Air? Why when the <HI>vis imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essa</HI> by which they were forc'd up, is spent, their natures, their innate gravities will bring them down to their place. Sinners need no other weights to pull them down to this Earth, than their earthly hearts.</P>
<P N="2">2. There's <HI>one without them</HI> that will fetch them off: Satan the god of this world, whose they are,
<PB N="239" REF="000857_0244_0FABB18BEBC0A730"/>
and whom they serve; who though he indulge them so much liberty for their Religion, as is consistent with their captive state, and may pos∣sibly secure them the more under his Dominion. (Hypocrites are often the faster to Satan, for being so near to Christ) the very Religion they have, is but the Devils snare, by which he holds them back from Religion; yet lest by venturing them too far, they should be lost to him at last, he that first tempted them so near to Christ, (Hy∣pocrites are often beholding to the Devil for the Religion they have) will quickly tempt them back again.</P>
<P>And so on the other side, there are the like Reasons why Saints cannot always wander, or stay away from Christ.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that within them, which will bring them back. <HI>The grace of God</HI> within them will bring them home. The Grace of God, is now their nature. Sinners whilest walking with Christ, and Saints whilest wandring from Christ, are both under a force, they are carried against the stream; when the winds are down that carried them on, they will return to their course. The grace of God is the seed of God, <HI>He that is born of God, sinneth not</HI>; (that is, not unto death) <HI>the seed of God remaineth in him.</HI> The seed of God is immortal seed; it may languish, and be ready to dye, but it shall not dye, it shall recover.</P>
<P N="2">2. There's <HI>one above them</HI> which will bring them back, though he suffer them for a time to wan∣der
<PB N="240" REF="000857_0245_0FABB18CA0577EC8"/>
from the way. <HI>Of those whom thou hast given me, have lost none. He hath</HI> lost none, and he will lose none. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sends <HI>a word of commandment</HI> after them, Jer. 3.14. <HI>Return O back sliding children, for</HI> I <HI>am marryed to you.</HI> Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her are you running?

<P>After the word of Command, he sends <HI>a word of pro∣mise,</HI> ver 22 <HI>I will heal your back slidings.</HI> Return from your back slidings, and I will heal them.

If you will turn, return and I wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> receive you.

<P>A good work may be said to be begun in a double sence.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>When there is some good thing a doing:</HI> O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when something is done towards i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; when it is <HI>in fieri.</HI> When the Lord hath been plo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghing up the fallow ground, making his Batteries against the strong Hold, shaking secure hearts, breaking false hopes, awakening Consci∣ences, convincing sinners, spreading sin, and death, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll before them, entring upon a Treaty with them, and perswading them over to Christ, to make an escape: There may be hopes in this, the pains of Travel gives hopes of a Birth. But this may go back, and after the

highest hopes, prove an abortion. Sinners, awa∣kened Sinners, beware you make not a stand at the Threshold; beware that your plough'd ground be not left to lie fallow. Beware that the Womb prove not the Grave of all your hopes. Mistake not Conviction for Conversion: make on, let not your God, nor your souls los<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the things which have been wrought.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>When there is some good thing done.</HI> When 'tis <HI>in facto esse.</HI> When the Rubbish is removed, and the first stone is laid; when the Plough hath been going, and the good Seed is sown; when the New-creature hath passed the Birth; when Christ is formed, and the light of life is newly sprung up in the soul; if there be but a <HI>grain of Mustard seed,</HI> the least and lowest degree of saving Grace broken forth in the heart, the question is not, whether it be much or little; if it be grace, there's the immortal seed, there's the good work begun, which shall be carried on till the day of Jesus Christ. <HI>Grace is a security for Glory:</HI> Yet be∣ware Christians, let not this security make you secure; though there be an Harvest in the seed, yet the seed must be cherished, watched &amp; well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooked to, that it may grow up to the Harvest: He that lets it dye for want of looking to, proves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat it was dead whilst alive. Let not your fall∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng short of Glory, prove that your Grace was not Grace.</P>
<P>Christian, lay hold on the Promise, and lift up your heads, you are under fears; however it be

with you for the present, you are in doubt how it may be; your way is long, and dangerous; yet your hearts are deceitful and unstable; you are going on at present, but doubt how you shall hold out: I may meet with Lyons in the way, which may fright me back; I may lose my way, and never recover; I may be a weary, and faint in the way, and lie down and give off: My Lord, and my soul, have been often upon the parting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in; I have been almost gone; and I tremble to think what may yet become of me: Yet remem∣ber who it is that hath said, <HI>I will no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> turn from you to do you good; I will put my fear in your hearts, and you shall not depart from me.</HI> Rise soul, take care for to day, and take no thought for to mor∣row.

Faith∣ful is he that hath called you, and will do it.</P>
<P>And now you have all▪ <HI>Let us hear the conclu∣si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of the whole matter.</HI> God hath made a Cove∣nant with his people, hath given <HI>himself</HI> for their Portion, <HI>his Son</HI> for their price, <HI>his Spirit</HI> for their guide in the way, <HI>his Earth</HI> for their accommo∣dation by the way, <HI>his Angels</HI> for their Guard, the <HI>Powers of darkness and death</HI> for their spoils, <HI>Ever∣lasting Glory</HI> for their Crown▪ And because their way is difficult, and their work is contrary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o them, he hath given them all that grace that is
<PB N="243" REF="000857_0248_0FABB18F5404C568"/>
necessary to bring them to Glory. In General, <HI>a new heart,</HI> in all things suited to their way, and throughly furnished for every good work. In Particular, <HI>Knowledge</HI> to guide; <HI>oneness</HI> to fix and intend; <HI>tenderness</HI> to sub∣mit to, and yield, <HI>love</HI> to constrain and bring on; <HI>fear</HI> to fence and hold in; <HI>obedience</HI> to perform and bring forth; and <HI>perseverance</HI> to go through, and hold out to the end; and there grace and glory meet. This is the Covenant of Grace, this is the word which by the Gospel is prea∣ched unto you.</P>
<P>It will be said, But if God hath undertaken all this for us, what is there then left on us to do? Here's a Doctrine according to sinners hearts; if this be Gospel, then soul take thine ease, take thy liberty, cast away care, make much of thy body, God will take care of the rest.</P>
<P>But is there nothing required of us? Let the Scrip∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ures speak, Ezek. 36 37. <HI>Yet for all this will</HI> I <HI>be en∣quired of,</HI> or sought unto <HI>by the house of</HI> Israel; otherwise let them look for no such things. He that will not ask in faith, <HI>let not that man think he shall receive any thing of the Lord,</HI> Jam. 1.7. And can he think to receive any think, that neither believes nor prayes? That neither prayes in faith, nor prayes at all, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.12, 13. <HI>It's God works in you, both to will and to do.</HI> What then? Therefore sit you still and do nothing? No such mat∣ter: therefore work out your salvation with fear and trembling, saith the Apostle. The promise of God was never intended to make the command of God of none effect. God in promising grace, promises a power for duty; and as he doth not give, so we must not receive that power or grace of God in vain. Whilst he gives what he requires, he still requires what he gives. That promise of God (<HI>ye shall be my people</HI>) though he un∣dertake to make it good; yet it is also the matter of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tipulation. And in this promise wherein the Lord as∣sures
<PB N="244" REF="000857_0249_0FABB19145F3A2C8"/>
us, what <HI>de facto</HI> we (shall) be, is included a Pre∣cept, wherein we may understand what <HI>de jure</HI> we (ought) to be.</P>
<P>In undertaking to give us a new heart, a tender and obedient, a persevering heart, the Lord doth promise, both to make us what we should be, and to help us in what we are bound to do; and gives us at once a clear hint, both of our mercy and duty. This is the sence &amp; sum of that promise, The Lord will work all that in us, and will help and cause us to perform all that which (is required) unto salvation; and so the <HI>Promissum</HI> on Gods part, doth not make void, but establish the <HI>Debi∣tum</HI> on ours, <HI>Do we then make void the Law through Faith? Nay, we establish the Law.</HI></P>
<P>Though it be certain as to the event, that all that's ne∣cessary to salvation, shall be accomplished in us; God hath undertaken that, yet it is altogether as certain, that God hath made our loving him, fearing him, obeying his whole will, and our sincerity and perseverance herein so necessary, that we cannot otherwise be saved:</P>
<P>Christians, mistake not, nor abuse the grace of the Gospel. The Lord never meant your mercy should make void your obligation to duty. Redemption from sin, was never intended as a toleration of sin. He gives not his Spirit in favour of the flesh. What he under∣takes to work for you, was never with a mind to main∣tain you in idleness, <HI>Tit.</HI> 2.11, 12. The Grace of God that bringeth salvation, teacheth us, that denying ungod∣liness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righte∣ously, and godly in this present world.</P>
<P>Though you are saved by grace, yet you are still (in a sense) debtors to the whole Law▪ Perfect obedience to the whole Law, even to the utmost <HI>Iota,</HI> is still due from you; and if it be not in your hearts to pay all that you owe, that is, if there be any duty commanded in the
<PB N="245" REF="000857_0250_0FABB191D73C5958"/>
whole Book of God, that you must be dispensed with, that you will not set your hearts to observe and obey; if there be any one sin that you mast be excused in, and will not part with; if there be any, the highest pitch of holy Care, Activity, Industry, Zeal for God and Holiness, that you will not be perswaded to press hard after; this is an evidence of such an unsound heart as hath no part in the Gospel, or the salvation thereof. Perfect∣ion is still due, though sincerity will be accepted. Sin∣cerity shall be accepted, but what is sincerity less than an hearty willingness to be perfect, attested by a striving &amp; pressing on to that mark which is set before us.</P>
<P>O admire and bless the Lord, the Lord for Grace; but do not turn the Grace of God into licentiousness Shall we continue in sin, because Grace that abounded? Will ye thus requite the Lord? Will ye thus deceive your selves, O foolish people and unwise? Will you slight him, because he hath loved you? Kick at him, because he hath cared for you? shake of his yoke, be∣cause he hath secured you the Crown! Will you serve his enemies, because he hath saved you from them? Will you nourish your diseases, because he hath said he will cure you? Will you live and not eat? Reap and not plough? Will you not eat, because he hath given you meat? Will you not run, because he hath given you legs? Nor work because he hath given you hands? Nor watch, because he hath given you eyes? Or will you tempt the Lord, and call that your trust in him? Awake from such madness.</P>
<P>Christians, say not (if God will, I shall) whether I take care or no, believe or no, repent or no, be obedi∣ent, or rebellious, whether I wake or sleep, work or be idle; my unbeleif, my disobedience, my negligence shall not make the faith of God of none effect. But rather, since God hath said, (you shall) let thine heart answer
<PB N="246" REF="000857_0251_0FABB1967B6B0B58"/>
(I will) walk in his statutes. Arise O my soul, up and be doing; work out thy salvation, because it's God that worketh in thee, to will and to do: shake off thy sloth, set to thy work, run out thy race, since God hath said, thou shalt not run, nor labour in vain. And look to it, for however thy Idleness, or greatest Unfaithfulness, will not make void the Covenant of God; yet will it make manifest, that thou hast no part nor lot in it.</P>
<P>But to all these glorious things that have been spoken, possibly some will reply; O, if all this be so, then happy Saints indeed: <HI>Happy are the people that are in such a case, yea blessed are the people whose God is the Lord.</HI> But will the Lord indeed do all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese things for Mortals? Will he take notice of Worms? shall such dry bones live? Will he set such vile dust as the Apple of his eye? Is not this too good to be true? Too great to be believ∣ed? Are we not all this while but in a Dream, or a fools Paradise? Oh that I were sure the one half were as it hath been told me. Too great to be believed? As if it must be questioned whether the Sun be light, because it dazles our eyes. But what certainty would you have? Is all this too great for the great and Almigh∣ty God to do, who hath said, Isa. 55.9. <HI>As the Heavens are higher than the Earth, so are my ways higher than your ways▪ and my thoughts, then your thoughts.</HI> Can he not do it, who can do all things? Will he not do it, when he hath said he will? Will the Lord mock? Can God deceive? Shall his word, yea and his Oath too, those <HI>two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lye,</HI> can these fail? If you should hear the Lord himself speaking to you from Heaven with audible voice, my Covenant I make with thee, and it is my intent and pur∣pose to perform every word that is written in it accord∣ing to the plain import and meaning thereof; there shall not a tittle fail, neither will I alter the thing that is gone

forth of my lip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Heaven and Earth shall fail, but my word shall not fail; trust to it, trust everlasting truth, trust to everlasting strength. Fear not, for there shall not fail one word of all that I have spoken by all my ser∣vants the Prohets.</P>
<P>If you should hear the Lord speaking thus to you from Heaven, what would you say? Would not this sa∣tisfie you? Why search the Scriptures, that <HI>more sure word of Prophesie,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.19.

<P>Let not the greatness, nor the strangeness of the be∣nefits bequeathed unto thee, put thee to a stand.

<P>O my God, I have believed thy report, and do look for all these things, according to thy Promise. I know thou intendest me but for a very little while in this lower Region.

And when my Absolution is read, and sen∣tence past upon the World, then must I be taken up to dwell with thee.</P>
<P>Let not my Lord be angry, that thy dust and ashes speaketh thus unto thee. Thou Lord hast raised my expectations, and hast made me to look for all these great things from thee.

<P>So shall my knowledge be perfected, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13 9, 10. and I shall see the inaccessible light; and my tender eye shall not water, nor my sight dazle; but I shall with open face look stedfastly on the Son of Righte∣ousness, and behold his glory.

I can say, My Lord, and my God, and that is enough; <HI>I</HI> thankfully quit my claim to all things else. I will no more say, My House is mine, or my Estate mine; I my self am not mine own: Yet it is infinitely better for me to be thine, than if I were mine own. This is my happiness, that I can say, My own God, my own Father. And O what a blessed exchange hast thou made with me! to give me thy Self, who art an infinite Summ, for my self, who a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> but an insignificant Cypher.</P>
<P>And now, Lord, do thou accept and own my claim. I am not worthy of any thing of thine, much less of thee.

It were infidelity to doubt it. I will not disparage the faithful¦ness of my Lord, nor be afraid to averr, &amp; stand to what he hath said and sworn. Hast thou said Thou art my God, and shall I fear thou art mine enemy? Hast thou told me, Thou art my Fa¦ther, and shall <HI>I</HI> stand aloof, as if I were a stran∣ger? I will believe.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX An Exhortation to Sinners.</HEAD>
<P>O Earth, Earth, Earth, hear the Word of the Lord. Ye Men of this World, Ye Spirits that are in Prison, held captive to iniquity, under the Prince of this World; in a Covenant with Death, at an agreement with Hell? without Christ, Aliens from the Common-wealth of <HI>Israel,</HI> Stran∣gers from the Covenant of Promise, having no hope, without God in the World; who have said, We will not have this man to rule over us;

let us break his Bonds asunder, and cast his Cords from us; who are joyned to Idols, have chosen you other Gods, are following after other Lovers; who walk after the course of this World, accord∣ing to the Prince of the Power of the Air, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Spirit that now worketh in the Children of Diso∣bedience; having your conversation in the lusts of the flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh, and of the mind, and being still as you were by na∣ture, the Children of wrath, in the gall of bitter∣ness and bond of iniquity.</P>
<P>O ye Sons of Death, ye Children of the Night, and of Darkness, Hear and your Souls shall live: to you also is the Word of this salvation sent; even the Strangers, and those that are afar off, that will lay hold on the Covenant, and choose the thing that pleaseth God, these also shall have a Name in his House, even the glorious Name of Sons and Daughters. The Lord hath sent a Word into <HI>Jacob,</HI> and it shall light upon <HI>Edom</HI> and <HI>A∣malek,</HI> and the uncircumcised <HI>Philistines,</HI> even as many of them as the Lord our God shall call, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.39.</P>
<P>Hearken, O People, you that are polluted in your blood, written in the Earth, free among the Dead; come in, let your Covenant with Death be made void, and your agreement with Hell be disanulled, strike a L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ague with the Almighty, &amp; your Names also shall be written amongst the li∣ving in <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></P>

the Word of Reconciliation, having hinted to you what's Law, so in the name of the Eternal God I publish to you the everlasting Gospel.</P>
<P>The Lord God having entred into a Covenant of life, with the first <HI>Adam,</HI> for himself and all mankind in him; this Covenant being broken, whereby sin hath entred, and death by sin, and all the world is now become guilty before God; bound over to the vengeance of eternal Fire, and under an utter impossibility of recovery, by ought that that Covenant can do; hath out of his abun∣dant grace, made a new Covenant, on which whosoever shall lay hold, shall be delivered out of the state of death, and wrath, into a state of Life and Blessedness, Rom 8.3. <HI>What the Law could not do, being weak through the flesh, God sent his Son in the likeness of sinful flesh</HI>; and with him this gra∣cious grant, <HI>that whosoever believeth in him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life, Joh.</HI> 3.16.

<P>And whoever among you all, who are persons under the Law, held by the cords of your sins, whose souls are fast bound in setters of Iron, who are willing that your Covenant with death be made void, and your agreement with Hell be dis-annulled, and will joyn your selves to the Lord, and be brought within the bonds of this Covenant, all the blessings of this Covenant are made over, and stand sure unto you.</P>
<P>The Grant is made, the Deed is drawn, and sealed; the Lord hath set to his Seal, come you in, and seal the Counter-part; set to your seal, and the match is made up▪ Christ, and with him all things are yours, and you are his. Accept and live, refuse and dye for ever.</P>
<P>Come on then, sinner, what sayest thou? Dost thou consent? Dost thou accept? Or as <HI>Laban</HI> to <HI>Rebeckah, Wilt thou goe with this man</HI>? Let me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spouse thee to this one Husband; only let me first tell thee, The matter is solemn, and thou must be serious.

<P N="2"><PB N="322" REF="000857_0333_0FABB1028FE45FE8"/>2. <HI>Ingenuous Subjection</HI>; by a free and chearful putting thy self under him, as thy Lord whom thou wilt obey, and be subject to, in all things.

<P>Consider then, what sayest thou? Doth thine heart choose, and accept, and resign up it self unto Christ? Dost thou choose him as an <HI>Husband</HI>?

Wilt thou be at <HI>his finding</HI>? Wilt thou look unto him, and lean upon him for all thou needest? Shall all thy desire be to him, and thy dependence on him?

Wilt do him this honour, to trust him for all this; to cast all thy burthens, thy care, thy fears, thy sins, thy guilt, thy hopes upon him?

slighted, I have fallen from thee, and run over to thine Enemies; I have fallen under thy displeasure, wrath is provoked, justice hath taken hold of me, my soul is un∣done? How dreadful is thy controversie with me? And I have nothing to answer, but this, My Jesus shall answer for me.</P>
<P>O my Jesus, thou hast wooed and invited sinners unto thee; thou hast sent forth thy Messengers, and thy Word, <HI>into the high wayes and hedges,</HI> into the Goals &amp; Hospitals of the world; among the poor, the blind, and the bound, and the diseased, and those that are in debt &amp; distress; to take from among them, <HI>a Wife for thy bosome.</HI> Behold, thy word hath found among the Captives this wretched Adulteress, my poor Harlot soul, which hath dealt treacherously with thee, and hath followed after other Lovers, hath fallen among Thieves and Robbers, is bruised, wounded, and undone; having prodigally spent and wasted all that I had.</P>
<P>But behold, I come at thy word; if thou sayest, I have no pleasure in thee, if thou spit in my face, and spurn me with thy foot, and trample me in the dirt, or send me back to my Prison, and leave me to bear the shame of my Whoredomes, I must be silent and speechless.</P>
<P>But wilt thou receive me? wilt thou take me into thine house? wilt thou spread thy s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irt over me? shall I be called by thy Name? wilt thou love me, and be joyned unto me? wilt thou be Surety for thy servant? wilt thou that my Debts be upon thee, my Bonds be upon thee; my wants, my sins, my sorrows, my fears, my plagues, my help, my soul be upon thee? Wilt thou Lord, and can I say thee Nay? Wilt thou take them, and can I refuse to lay them upon thee? I consent, Lord, I consent to thee; be thou mine Husband, and mine helper; love me, discharge me of this guilt, loose me from these fetters, cleanse me from this filthiness, and

then ask what thou wilt, impose upon me what∣ever thou pleasest. Love thee, honour thee, obey thee? Oh what is my Love, what is my obedi∣ence, that thou shouldest accept, or I should deny it to thee? 'Tis but little that <HI>I</HI> can do, this heart is so false, and so feeble that I am afraid how I undertake for it, but such as it is, take it to thee. I bestow it wholly upon thee, with this promise, that if thou wilt help me I will love thee, if thou wilt help me, I will be subject to thee, &amp; lay up all my hopes and expectations with thee. Now Soul, now that thou knowest what it means, now say, wilt thou have Christ for thine Husband?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Wilt thou take him for better for worse, for richer for poorer.</HI></P>
<P>Though thy Lord be a King, yet his Kingdom is not of this world. He came not to be mini∣stred unto, but minister; he came to serve, and to suffer, and all those that will follow him, must suffer with him. He came not to divide lands, and spoils, and crowns, and temporal dignities, &amp; honours amongst his Disciples; but crosses, and prisons, and scourges, and wants. Thou wilt joyn thy self to the Lord, but wilt thou take up thy lot with him? Thou wilt live with him, and abide with him; but dost know where he dwells, and what his Entertainment is? Sometimes he hath bread, and sometimes he is hungry; some∣times he hath cloaths, and sometimes is naked; sometimes he hath an house, and sometimes he hath none, sometimes he hath friends, and some∣times
<PB N="325" REF="000857_0336_0FABB1041A86B5E0"/>
he hath none; he is sometimes used kindly, and sometimes as coursly; sometimes 'tis <HI>Hosanna,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Crucifie</HI>; sometimes he is cried up as a King, sometimes cried out against as a Devil; and as it is with the Master, so it will be with the Scholar; as with the Lord, so with the Disci∣ple; where he is thou must be also. Canst thou say, Whither thou goest, I will go with thee; where thou feedest, I will feed with thee; where my Lord dwelleth, if in a tent, if in a cave, if in a dungeon, if in a wilderness, where∣ever my Lord dwelleth, let me dwell with him? Consider what thou sayest, and be not over hasty. May be thou dost not yet know, what hunger &amp; thirst, and nakedness mean; what the wrath of man, what their reproachings, and spittings, and stripes, and bonds means; may be thou hast thought, this may be far enough off, and may ne∣ver come upon me; or hast taken up a resoluti∣on through incogitancy, not weighing how sharp and how pinching they may be to thee. But suppose thou wert now just come to it; and that thou sawest, that thy first foot Christ ward, would be the parting point betwixt thee and all that is dear unto thee in the world; that thy first step Heaven-ward would be into the fire, or the wa∣ter, or into the camp of the Philistines, whose faces were all fill'd with fury against thee. Hast thou yet such a far deeper sence of the eternal sufferings, thou art in danger of; such a settled belief, of thy absolute necessity of Christ to thy escaping these; such an high value of the love of
<PB N="326" REF="000857_0337_0FABB104DB33DE00"/>
Christ, and the everlasting salvation thou expectest by him, as does over-ballance and swallow up the sharpest and the quickest sence thou hast or canst have of the greatest things thou shalt suffer by him? Hast thou cast up all afflictions imagina∣ble, and then put thy soul to it? Now resolve what to do; either this, or no Christ; either this, or no Crown; either this Cross, or the Curse, ei∣ther the wrath of man, or the wrath of God; Scorpions, and Dragons, and Devils; shrieking, and howling, and gnashing of teeth for ever and ever. Confess Christ, and be confessed by him; suffer with Christ, and reign with him; weep with Christ, and rejoyce with him; dye with Christ, and live for ever; deny Christ, forsake Christ, and perish for ever. Hast thou thus put thy self to it? And after the most solemn debate thou hast had, what is the result? Now tell me, Christ, or no Christ. Wilt thou have Christ for better for worse, how dear soever he cost thee.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Wilt thou forsake all others?</HI></P>

<P>To discover, To destroy it.</P>
<P N="1">1. To use all Gods means <HI>to discover it</HI>; to bring to light the hidden things of darkness.

Or of a covetous heart, there's another of them; or of an envious, mali∣cious, froward heart, there are more of them; or of an hard and hypocritical, ignorant, unbelieving heart, this is he, this is my great enemy; Or if thou canst not tell, dost ask, Is not this he? Are not these they? O that <HI>I</HI> could understand mine errours, Lord make me to know my transgressions.</P>
<P>Sinners, never make your selves believe you are enemies to sin, till you make narrow and par∣ticular enquiry after it; after all sin, the several kinds of it, whether of omission or commission, whether outward or spiritual, open or secret, grea∣ter or smaller, sins of ignorance or knowledge, of infirmities or presumption; your beloved, your most pleasing sins, your most gainful sins, whate∣ver they be, you never renounce, till you resolve to make a diligent search after them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX, and Last. An Exhortation to the Saints.</HEAD>
<P>COme ye people, beloved, you that are highly favoured; The Lord is with you. Blessed are you amongst men and women. The Lines are fallen to you in a pleasant place, yea, you have goodly heritage. Come and enter upon your Lot; let your hearts be glad, let your glo∣ry rejoyce, but that your joy may be full, hearken to those following counsels:</P>
<P><HI>Make sure your interest in the Covenant.</HI></P>
<P>Rejoyce not in that that's none of thine. Make sure, all lies upon this: Your life, and all the comforts and concernments of it, both your eter∣nal safety hereafter, and your success in all the parts of your Christian course here, depend on your interest in the Covenant. What have you if Christ be not yours? and what have you in Christ, if you be not in Covenant? whence are your hopes, either of mercy at last, or of prospe∣ring in any thing at present, but from the Covenant of Promise? And what have you thence, if your name be not in it? Oh give not rest to your selves, till this be put out of doubt; whatever duties you
<PB N="343" REF="000857_0354_0FABB12D0A3A0EA8"/>
perform, whatever ease or hope you find hereup∣on, whatever transportation or affection you feel in your hearts, in the midst of all enquiry.</P>
<P><HI>But am I in Covenant?</HI> How shall I know that, you'l say? why make a strict and narrow enqui∣ry, whether those special graces already mention∣ed, be wrought upon you. Common mercies, though even these be Covenant mercies to the Saints, yet will they not prove themselves so to be; but special graces will be their own evidence. Things outward, fall alike to all; <HI>No man knows love or hatred by ought that befals him, Eccles.</HI> 9.1. Thou mayest be a son or a bastard, notwithstan∣ding all that thou enjoyest or sufferest here; but not one of the fore-mentioned graces, but is a Childs portion, Gods mark upon the heart, to di∣stinguish children from strangers. Prove that thou truly knowest the Lord, hast one heart, a tender heart, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and thou therein provest thy self to be a child of Promise. Read over the de∣scriptions that have been given of these graces; observe diligently where the main difference lies betwixt common and special grace; compare thine heart with it, and thereby thou mayest give a judgment of thy state. If it be yet questiona∣ble, whether it be sound or no? sit not down till thou hast obtained; but having obtained;</P>

be but a poor livelihood you will get out of what's wasted and lost. Get you good evi∣dences that God is yours, and keep them by you, till you need them no more. Grace is your best evidence, cherish and preserve it. Get a seeing eye, and keep your eye open; get a single heart, and let it not be again divided; get a tender heart, and keep it tender; let the love and fear of God be acted in holy Obedience. An Obedient, Gracious, Watchful, Active life, will keep Grace in heart; and flourishing grace will speak for it self and you. Look not that the Lord should so far countenance your de∣clinings to a more fleshly careless state, as to smile upon you in such a state; God will not be an Abettor to sin. Count upon it, that your grace and peace, your duty and comfort will rise and fall together; suspect those com∣forts that accompany you into the Tents of wickedness, and forsake you not, when you forsake your God.
