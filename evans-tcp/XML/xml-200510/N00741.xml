<HEAD>An Abstract OF A LETTER From a Person of Eminency and worth in <HI>Caledonia</HI> to a Friend at <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have Received yoar kind Letter of the 26 <HI>December</HI> last, and Communicated it to the Gentlemen of the Council here; to whom your kind Sentiments, and Readiness were very ac∣ceptable.</P>
<P>Certainly the Work here begun is the most Ripened, Digested, and the best Founded, as to Priviledges, Place, Time, and other like Advantages, that ever was yet begun in any part of the Trading World. We Arrived upon this Coast the first, and took possession the third of <HI>November:</HI> Our Scituation is about Two Leagues to the Southward of <HI>Golden-Island,</HI> (by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> called <HI>Guarda</HI>) in one of the best &amp; most defenceable Harbours perhaps in the World. The Country is Healthful to a wonder; insomuch that our own Sick, which were many when we Arrived, are now generally cured. The Country is exceeding Fertile, and the Weather Temperate: The Country where we are Settled, is

dry, and rising ground, Hills but not High; and on the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and quite to the tops, three, four or five foot good fat mould, not a Rock or Stone to be seen. We have but Eight or Nine <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, where <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the South <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. The <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for Fifty <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> either side are in intire friendship and Correspondence with us; and if we will be at the pains, we can gain those at the greatest distance. For our Neighbour <HI>Indians</HI> are willing to be the joyful Messengers of our Settlement, and good disposition to their Country-men. As to the Innate Riches of the Countrey, upon the first information, I always believed to be very great: but now find it goes beyond all that ever I thought, or conceited in that matter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as we can understand, are very much surprize<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and alarm'd, and the more that it comes as a Thunder-clap upon the<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; ha∣ving had no notice <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f us, un<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> three days after our A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ival. We have Written to the Praesident of <HI>Panama,</HI> giving him Account of our good and peaceable intentions, and to procure a good Understanding and Correspondence; And if that is not condescended to; we are ready for what else he pleases. If Merchants should once Erect Factories here, this place will soon become the best and surest Mart in all <HI>America,</HI> both for In-land and Over-land Trade. We want here Sloops and Coasting Vessels; for want of which, and by reason we have been all hands at work in fortifying and fitting our selves (which is now pretty well over) we have had but little Trade as yet: most of our Goods Unsold. We are here a Thousand one hundred Men, and expect Supplies every day. We have been exceeding unhappy in loosing two Ministers who came with us from <HI>Scot∣land</HI>; and if <HI>New England</HI> could supply us in that, it would be a great and lasting Obligation.</P>

<P>THE said Company pursuant to the Powers and Immu∣munities Granted unto them, by His Majesty of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> our Soveraign Lord, with Advice and Consent of His Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI>: having Granted and Conceded unto us and our Successors in the Govern∣ment for all times hereafter, full Power to equip, set out, freight, and navigate, our own or hired Ships, in War-like, or other manner, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any ports or places in Amity, or not in Hostility with His <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; to any Lands, Islands, Countries, or places in <HI>Asia, Africa</HI>

and Country, with Promise and Contract to assist and join in de∣fence thereof against such as shall be their or our Enemies in any time to come. Which, besides its being one of the most Healthful Rich, and Fruitful Countries upon Earth, hath the advantage of be∣ing a Narrow ISTHMUS, Seated in the Heighth of the World, between the two vast Oceans, which renders it more convenient than any other for being the common Store-house of the Insearch∣able and Immense Treasures of the Spacious South Seas, the door of Commerce to <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> and the Emporium and Staple for the Trade of both <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>And now by Virtue of the before mentioned Powers to us given, We do here Settle, and in the Name of GOD Establish Our Selves, and in Honour, and for the Memory of that most Ancient and Renowned Name of our Mother Kingdom, We do, and will from hence-forward call this Country by the Name of <HI>Caledonia</HI>: and our selves, Successors, and Associates, by the name of <HI>Caledonians.</HI></P>
<P>And suitable to the Weight and Greatness of the Trust reposed, and the valuable Opportunity now in our hands; being firmly resolved to communicate and dispose thereof in the most just and equal manner for Increasing the Dominions and Subjects of the King Our Soveraign Lord, the Honour and Wealth of our Country, as well as the benefit and advan∣tage of those who now are, or may hereafter be concerned with us: We do hereby Publish and Declare, That all manner of Persons of what Nation or People soever, shall from hence forward be equally free and alike capable of the said Properties, Priviledges, Protections, Im∣munities, and Rights of Government Granted unto us; and the Mer∣chants, &amp; Merchants Ships of all Nations; may freely come to, and Trade with us; without being liable in their Persons, Goods or Effects, to any manner of Capture, Confiscation, Seizure, Forfeiture, At∣tachment, Arrest, Restraint or Prohibition, for or by reason of any Embargo, breach of the Peace, Letters of Mark, or Rep<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>izals, De∣claration of War with any Forreign Prince, Potentate or State, or upon any other account or pretence whatsoever.</P>
<P>And we do hereby not only Grant, and Concede, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a general and equal freedom of Government and Trade to
