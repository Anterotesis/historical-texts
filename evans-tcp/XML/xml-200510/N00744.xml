<HEAD>THE SECOND PART, Containing, A Preparation for Death.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THou Earthly Mortal Man, observe this well,</L>
<L>If thou in Wickedness on Earth do dwell:</L>
<L>Then in a dying Hour may'st thou find</L>
<L>The sad effects of a disquiet Mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For in this World we have not long to live,</L>
<L>And when we come to die, what would we give</L>
<L>To be assured of a Resting Place,</L>
<L>So soon as we have run out Nature's Race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nothing but Sorrows do our Life attend,</L>
<L>Therefore let us think of our latter End;</L>
<L>That when we on the Bed of Sorrow lye;</L>
<L>We may have nothing else to do, but die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! let not Folly steal thy Heart away,</L>
<L>Remember still that there will come a Day,</L>
<L>That we to GOD a just Account must give,</L>
<L>How, well or ill, we here on Earth did live.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He that a Holy, Upright Life will lead,</L>
<L>And fain would be a Christian now indeed,</L>
<L>Must still approach the Throne of Grace, by Prayer,</L>
<L>Making Religion here his constant care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In Blooming Youth 'tis best for to begin</L>
<L>To seek the Lord, and take our leave of Sin;</L>
<L>For having early took a Righteous Way,</L>
<L>We are not then so apt to go astray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But often do we see the Blooming Youth</L>
<L>Delight in Sin, neglect the Word of Truth,</L>
<L>And think it time enough for to amend</L>
<L>Our evil ways when Life is at an End.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No greater danger in the World can be</L>
<L>For our poor Souls, than such loose Liberty;</L>
<L>It causes Man Repentance to delay,</L>
<L>When we an't sure to see another Day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why should poor Mortals eagerly pursue</L>
<L>Those vain Delights, which will our Griefs renew;</L>
<L>For after Sinning Thirty, Forty Years,</L>
<L>It may occasion sad repenting Tears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And therefore now, before it is too late,</L>
<L>Let ev'ry one think of a Future State;</L>
<L>And on the Mercies of the Lord relie,</L>
<L>For who is he that lives, and shall not Die?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And from your Duty do not turn aside,</L>
<L>But mind the Holy Bible, more than Pride,</L>
<L>In which the Righteous Law of God's reveal'd,</L>
<L>And will in time of trouble Comfort yield.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I speak to all of High and Low Degree,</L>
<L>Serve ye the Lord with true Sincerity;</L>
<L>The Rich as well as Poor have Souls to save,</L>
<L>And there is no Repentance in the Grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Brows that sweat for Kingdoms &amp; Renown</L>
<L>To Glorifie their Temples with a Crown,</L>
<L>Must leave their Diadem when Death shall call,</L>
<L><HI>Memento mori</HI> is the end of all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Riches and Honour, Crowns and Dignity,</L>
<L>Those fading Glories most uncertain be;</L>
<L>Nothing substantial in this World we find,</L>
<L>But ev'ry thing is turning with the Wind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet if in God alone we put our Trust,</L>
<L>Who is both Gracious, Merciful, and Just,</L>
<L>Making his Holy Word our Rule and Guide,</L>
<L>'Tis better worth than all the World beside</L>
