<P><HI>FORASMUCH as the Building of Ships is a business of great Importance for the common good, and not only the safety of mens Estates, but Lives are nearly concerned in the well and orderly performing of the same. And forasmuch as Builders and Workmen imployed under them, are oft times remiss and negligent of their Duty in that regard, as has been found by experience; and it being therefore necessary and agreeable to the course and pra∣ctice of His Majesties Kingdom of</HI> England; <HI>That suitable provision be made, and effectual care taken therein.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Be it Enacted by the Lieutenant Governour, Council and Represen∣tatives in General Court Assembled, and by the Authority of the same,</HI> That when and so often as any Ship or Vessel of Thirty Tuns or up∣wards, is to be built and set up in any Town or Place within this Province, before any Plank be brought on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Warrant to be obtained &amp; Survey made before Planking.</NOTE> the Carpenter or Undertaker shall repair unto one of the Justices of the Peace within the same County, who, upon request made is hereby impowred to appoint and authorize one or more able Shipwrights to be Overseers and Surveyers of the said Building, and of all the materials and workmanship to be improved, made use of, done and to be done to, on and about the same from time to time, as often as the Carpenter or Undertaker shall see cause to call them thereto, and especially at such times as in and by this Act is hereafter directed and appointed; <HI>That is to say,</HI> Every Tear of Timbers shall be Surveyed before they be inclosed or covered with Plank, and the Floor Timbers before the Kealson be bolted down; The Beams and Timbers for the Decks shall be Surveyed after laying, before any Plank be fastned on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Special times for a Survey.</NOTE> and the Bottom to be Surveyed before Calk∣ing: Which Overseers and Surveyers to be appointed as aforesaid, shall take care that all the materials in said Building be sound, sufficient and suitable for the occasion, and that the works be done and performed strong, substantial and in workman like manner, according to the Rules of the Shipwrights art; and that all Trunnels be not only sound and well seasoned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Timber or Plank of Oak, other than white Oak to be used.</NOTE> but also without Sap. And shall have a particular care and regard that such Ship or Vessel be well Calked, and not to allow any Timber or Plank of Oak to be used there in, other than white Oak, and shall direct that all insufficient Materials be taken out, and that defective Workmanship be amended.</P>
<P>And the Surveyers and Overseers to be appointed as aforesaid, shall have an Oath Administred unto them to be faithful and indifferent between the Car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>penter or Builder, and the Undertaker,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Surveyers to be Sworn.</NOTE> and to observe the directions given them by this Act.</P>

And when the Surveyers or Overseers shall give their advice or judgment on or about any work unfi∣nished, that the same is faulty or defective, the Carpenter shall not thereby incur the Charge of Surveying, but only when the Surveyers or Overseers see reason to direct the taking out or shifting any Timber or Plank.</P>
