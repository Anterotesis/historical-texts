<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HOUGH I know no Reason why you should be solicitous about any Thing that happens to such a worth∣less Creature as I am, yet as your Love (Oh unmerited Kindness!) abounds ex∣ceedingly towards me, and I am positive you will give Thanks unto our good GOD, for all the Mercies he has confer'd upon me; I have sent you as full and particular an Account of the Remainder of my Voyage, as the little Leisure I have had from my Ministerial Offices would permit me to give.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, February</HI> 20, 1737. Spent the Morning on Board, in writing Letters to my dear Friends in <HI>England,</HI> to acquaint them of my safe Arrival. Went in the Afternoon on shore to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and was unspeakably delighted with the Prospect of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Place. My Friend <HI>H.</HI> and I, din'd at an Inn, and went afterwards
<PB N="4" REF="004453_0004_100D9E6018C9EAB0"/>
with Capt. <HI>W.</HI> and some other Company, to view one Side of the Fort; which to us seem'd impregnable, and at the Sight of which I could scarce avoid crying out, — <HI>Who is so great a</HI> GOD, <HI>as our</HI> GOD!</P>
<P>The seeing Persons of all Nations and Lan∣guages, gave me great Pleasure, and the Diffe∣rence of the Value of their Money and ours, gave me Occasion to reflect on the Stupidity of those, who place their Happiness in that which has no intrinsick Worth in itself, but only so much as we arbitrarily put upon it.</P>
<P>Went into a <HI>Romish</HI> Chappel; wherein were the Relicks of a vast deal of Pageantry, and se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>veral Images of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> dress'd up not like a poor <HI>Galilean,</HI> but in her Silks and Damasks. <HI>O,</HI> thought I, <HI>who has bewitch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> this People, that they should thus depart from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Simplicity of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>and go a Whoring after their own Inventions! Surely, was the great St.</HI> Paul <HI>to rise from the Dead, and come and view the</HI> Romish Church, <HI>his Spirit would be stirred within him, as it was at</HI> Athens, <HI>to see them thus wholly given to Idolatry.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, Feb.</HI> 21. After having read Prayers and wrote some religious Letters, to my Friends in <HI>England,</HI> went again to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> to pay my Respects to Governor <HI>S.</HI> being told by Capt. <HI>M.</HI> that he expected to see me. — The worthy old Gentleman received me with the utmost Candour, and gave me a general Invitation to come and dine with him every Day, during my Stay at <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> I thanked him for his Kindness, had
<PB N="5" REF="004453_0005_100D9E61E3881990"/>
about a quarter of an Hour's Conversation with him, and took my Leave for that Time.</P>
<P>At one o'Clock I r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>turn'd to dine with him, ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ding to his Appointment, and was well ple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lar Behaviour of the Officers a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble. We had what the <HI>Epicurean</HI> would call. <HI>Coena Dubia — super omnia Vultus accessere b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ni,</HI> — At Three I took my Leave, and walked about with Capt. <HI>W.</HI> and other Friends, to take a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>econd View of the Fort. Went on Board about Five. Read Prayers, and began expounding the Creed, in the Cabin. Wrote some more religious Letters, and went to Bed very thankful to GOD, for sending me abroad.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, Feb.</HI> 22. This Day I intended to stay on Board to write Letters; but GOD being pleased to shew me, it was not his Will, I went on Shore again, and paid both the Ministers of <HI>Gibraltar</HI> a Visit; who received me very af∣fectionately, and offer'd me the Use of the Pulpit. <HI>O, what a blessed Thing is it for the Clergy to dwell together in Unity!</HI></P>
<P>At Eleven, went to public Prayers; and was much pleased to see many Officers and Soldiers attend the General to Church. <HI>Methinks Religion looks doubly amiable in Soldiers!</HI> After Prayers, din'd again with the General; who gave me an Invitation, as I went out of the Church. He treated me with uncommon Civility, and desired me to preach the following. <HI>Sunday,</HI> which I promised to do. We had an elegant Entertain∣ment, but my Thoughts were mostly employ'd in pitying the Unhappiness of great Men, who
<PB N="6" REF="004453_0006_100D9E64282EF8D8"/>
are in such continual Danger of having their Table become a Snare unto them. I had an Opportunity of sending a Packet of Letters, with my Journal, to my dear Friends in <HI>England; May the good Lord give them his Blessing!</HI></P>
<P>Went in the Afternoon to visit a Deserter, who had sent me a Letter, desiring me to inter∣cede for him with the Governour, he being apprehensive he should die for Desertion, I intended to answer his Request, but the Gover∣nor was so merciful, that he order'd him to be whipp'd only, which I thought Punishment little enough. <HI>O Sin! What Mischief dost thou make in the World!</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening, I return'd as usual on Board. Read Prayers, and expounded in the great Cabin. Buried a Child; made an Exhortation to the Soldiers, proper for the Occasion. Wrote to some Friends at <HI>Deal,</HI> and went to Bed, with unusual Thoughts, and Convictions, that GOD would do some great Things at <HI>Gibraltar. O that I was a pure Vessel, fit for my Master's Use!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, Feb.</HI> 23. Continued all this Day on Board; did my usual Duty in the Ship; and put my dear Friend <HI>B</HI>—'s Sermon into the Hands of two Officers at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> who came to dine on Board with Lieutenant <HI>D.</HI> They behaved very much like Gentlemen, and seemed pleased with serious Conversation. <HI>May the</HI> GOD <HI>whom I serve, add the</HI> Christian <HI>to the</HI> Gentleman!</P>
<P><HI>Friday, Feb.</HI> 24. <HI>Blessed be God, who this Day has shewn me, that he has heard my Prayer,
<PB N="7" REF="004453_0007_100D9E664192C560"/>
and not taken his Loving Kindness from me!</HI> — Before I reached <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> I prayed that God would open an effectual Door, at the Place whi∣ther we were going, and direct me where I should lodge; and lo! this Day he hath an∣swered me! About Ten in the Morning Capt. <HI>M.</HI> came on Board, telling me that one Major <HI>S.</HI> a Person I never saw, had provided me a con∣venient Lodging, at one Merchant <HI>B</HI>—'s, and desired that I would come on Shore. I looking on this as a Call from Providence, received it with all Thankfulness, and went with Friend <HI>H.</HI> on Shore; but not without first praying GOD would direct us how to behave.</P>
<P>About the middle of the Town Major <HI>S.</HI> gave us the Meeting; conducted us to our new Lodgings, which were very commodious, and engaged us to dine with him, and Capt. <HI>M. When I sent you without Scrip, or Shoe, lacked ye any Thing? they said unto Him, Nothing, Lord.</HI></P>
<P>About Eleven was introduc'd by Dr. <HI>C.</HI> to General <HI>C.</HI> who was very desirous of seeing me: He receiv'd me exceeding kindly; and after a little serious Conversation, we went to Governor <HI>S</HI>—'s, and from thence to public Prayers; and was highly pleas'd to see so many Officers at∣tending on the Generals to Church. Dr. <HI>C.</HI> told me, he had not known Governor <HI>S.</HI> absent him∣self from Prayers once these seven Years; except when he was hinder'd by real Sickness. <HI>O that all others would let their Light so shine before Men!</HI></P>
<P>Retir'd in the Evening to our Lodgings. Had Family Prayer. Wrote some few Religious
<PB N="8" REF="004453_0008_100D9E681FD5D378"/>
Letters. Spent near half an Hour in serious Conversation with the People of the House. Gave Thanks for the Blessings of the Day, and was soon convinc'd that God had sent me hither of a Truth. <HI>Be careful for nothing; but in every,—even the minutest Thing, make your Wants known unto God; — for he careth for you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Feb.</HI> 25. About Six this Morning went with <HI>H.</HI> to the Church, to pray with some devout Soldiers, who I heard used to meet there at that Time, and with whom my Soul was knit immediately.— <HI>For all my Delight is in the Saints that are in the Earth, and in those that excel in Virtue.</HI></P>
<P>After we had finish'd our Devotions, I made Inquiry into their State; and found that their Society had been subsisting about twelve Years; and that one Sergeant <HI>B.</HI> (a devout Soldier in∣deed) now among them, was the first Beginner of it. At first (they told me) they used to meet in Dens, and Mountains, and Caves in the Rocks; but afterwards, on their applying for Leave to build a little Place to retire in, Dr. <HI>C.</HI> and Governor <HI>S.</HI> gave them the free Use of the Church, where they constantly meet three times in a Day; and pray, read, and sing Psalms; and at any other Season when they please. — They have met with much Contempt; and are now in Derision, call'd, THE NEW LIGHTS; and glorious Lights they are indeed! For I convers'd closely with several of them, and they made me quite asham'd of my little Proficiency in the School of Christ. Many have join'd with
<PB N="9" REF="004453_0009_100D9E6ACC10E1E8"/>
them for a Time, but a servile Fear of Man (that Bane of Christianity!) made them draw back. However, some continued stedfast and unmoveable, and tho' despised by the World, are, no Doubt, highly favour'd of GOD. Go∣vernor <HI>S.</HI> countenances them much; and has spoke of them often to me with much Respect. <HI>Blessed be</HI> GOD, <HI>even the Father of our Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>who hath not left himself without Witness at any Place; but hath some every-where who serve him, and work Righteousness!</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Sunday</HI> before we came hither, I was telling my Friend <HI>H.</HI> that I had Reason to think, by what had happen'd to me, that GOD had some Work for me to do at <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> He answer'd, there could not be much Good expected from among Soldiers. — I reply'd, No Doubt but God has some secret ones in all Places, who tremble at his Word. <HI>And, lo! he has this Day brought me to them. By this I know thou favourest me, O Lord, Thou King of Saints!</HI></P>
<P>There is also another Society of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Church, who in Contempt are called DARK LANTHORNS: It has subsisted about a Year, and is made up of many serious Christians, as I was inform'd. I did not think it proper to visit them; but I sent to them, as well as to the other Society, some proper Books. Had Religious Talk with several of them, and endeavour'd to unite both Societies together. <HI>O when will that Time come, when all Differences about Externals shall be taken away, and we all with one Heart, and one Mouth, glorify our Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST?</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004453_0010_100D9E6E2E4E37B0"/>About Eight, return'd to my Lodgings; and after having wrote some Religious Letters, went on Board the <HI>Amy</HI> (having first advised with Col. <HI>C.</HI>) to marry a Couple, who sent to me Yesterday, to come and celebrate their Nuptials. I took that Opportunity of exhorting them all to <HI>take Heed to the Things that belong to their Peace.</HI> Some, I believe, were affected; but the Gene∣rality of them behav'd so careless, that I could not see a Difference between those that have a Minister among them, and those that have not.</P>
<P>About Twelve, went on Board my own Ship▪ Din'd. Did some necessary Business. Read Prayers. Gave my Flo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k a warm Exhortation, and return'd about Five on Shore; where I spent near two Hours with the Devout Soldiers in the Church. Many of them convers'd most Spiritually; and seem'd well acquainted with the Pangs of the New-Birth. <HI>May God perfect the good Work begun in their Hearts! O how amiable are thy Servants, O Lord of Hosts! How would the World admire them, did they see their Beauties! But Satan does now, as formerly,— dress them up in Bear-skins, in order to have them baited.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Feb.</HI> 26. Between Five and Six in the Morning, went with Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and (which I did all the while I was at <HI>Gibraltar</HI>) sung Psalms; pray'd, and expounded the Lessons to the devout Soldiers in the Church, and was much inlarged. <HI>Thanks be given unto Thee, O Lord!</HI></P>
<P>Intended to go and preach to my People. Was prevented by the Violence of the Wind; but
<PB N="11" REF="004453_0011_100D9E6FC18ECDC0"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pleas'd to hear of some <HI>Gibraltar</HI> Officers, who din'd that Day on Board the <HI>Whitaker,</HI> that some of my Flock had the Courage to read Prayers, and sing Psalms themselves; and, as I found afterwards, continued to do so, during my Absence from them. <HI>Blessed be God! I hope I shall have some that dare to be singularly good, and will not be kept out by the Press!</HI></P>
<P>Preach'd in the Morning at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> before such a Congregation of Officers and Soldiers, as I never before saw. The Church, tho' very large, was quite throng'd; and GOD was plea∣sed to shew me, that he had given extraordinary Success to my Sermon. <HI>O how is the Divine Strength magnify'd in my Weakness! O God! why dost thou chuse to work by so unfit an Instru∣ment! O grant I may, like a pure Crystal, tran∣smit all the Light thou pourest on me, and never claim as my own, what is thy sole Property!</HI></P>
<P>Din'd, with Friend <HI>H.</HI> at Governor <HI>S</HI>—'s, who sent most kindly to invite us. The Law at his Table, was the same with that of <HI>Ahasuerus.</HI> No one was compell'd; and all the Officers be∣hav'd in such a decent, innocent manner, every Time I din'd there, that they surpriz'd me. <HI>Surely some Fear of God is in this Place!</HI></P>
<P>After Evening Prayers, (for there are none in the Afternoon) I went and expounded, pray'd, and sung Psalms with the Society, and had near thirty Hearers. <HI>May the Good Lord give it his Blessing!</HI></P>
<P>At Night had some devout Conversation with my Host and Hostess; who seem to love me as their own Son. Pray'd for absent
<PB N="12" REF="004453_0012_100D9E715400D1B0"/>
Friends; and went to Bed, asham'd I had done so little for GOD, on the Sabbath Day. <HI>But when we can't do as we would, we must do as we can.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, February</HI> 27. Went to the Society, and did as Yesterday; and was visited after∣wards by two of the <HI>Nonconforming</HI> Society, who seem'd to be <HI>Israelites</HI> indeed. I exhorted them to Love and Unity, and not to let a little Difference about a few Externals occasion any Narrow-Spiritedness to arise in their Hearts. I advised them to come and hear me expound in the Church, which they did; and providentially the Lesson was the 4th of the <HI>Ephesians</HI>; from whence I took Occasion to urge on them, the Necessity of loving one another, with a catho∣lic, disinterested Love; to be of one Heart, and of one Mind, and to join, without having Re∣spect to Persons, in hastening the Kingdom of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. I hope GOD gave a Blessing to what was said; for I observ'd they came constantly afterwards; and I was told, there was a perfect Harmony between them. <HI>What infinite Mischief have needless Divisions occasion'd in the Christian World!</HI> DIVIDE ET IMPERA, <HI>is the Devil's Motto.</HI></P>
<P>Din'd and Supp'd at General <HI>C</HI>'s, with Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and was receiv'd most cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. <HI>The Lord reward him in that Day!</HI> The Officers seem'd studious to oblige me; and to be sollicitous for my stay at <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> — But <HI>my Face is set to go towards</HI> GEORGIA; the <HI>Lord direct my going, in his Way!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004453_0013_100D9E74E173DF90"/><HI>Tuesday, Feb.</HI> 28. Expounded in the Church as usual. Went on Board. Read Prayers. Expounded to my own Flock. Din'd with Friend <HI>H.</HI> at Governor <HI>S.</HI>'s, who sent to invite us. Expounded to a large Number of Soldiers, in the Evening, at Church.</P>
<P>Was ask'd by Dr. <HI>C.</HI> in the Name of the Governor; Colonel <HI>C. &amp;c.</HI> to preach every Prayer-day, while I stai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Gibraltar</HI>; which I promised to do; and perceived the Word of God to run very swiftly. Many of the Inhabi∣tants press'd me to stay with them, and were exceedingly kind to those that were with me,— for my sake. <HI>Blessed be</HI> GOD, <HI>for thus giving me Favour in his People's Sight! Lord! What am I! or what is in me, that thou should'st so highly honour me! Grant, O Lord, the more thou exaltest me, the more I may abase myself, and always be looking to the Rock, from whence I was h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn!</HI></P>
<P>Conversed with one of the devout Soldiers, who was under strong Spiritual Trials, and GOD was pleased to give him Comfort. <HI>I find it neces∣sary, more and more every Day, that Ministers should be tempted, in all Things like unto their Brethren, that they may be able experimentally to succour those that are tempted.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, March</HI> 1. Expounded in the Morning; and was highly pleased, at my En∣trance into the Church, to see several Soldie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, kneeling in several Parts of the House of GOD, at their private Devotions.— <HI>O happy</HI> Gibraltar! <HI>that hath such a set of praying Men!</HI> Some I
<PB N="14" REF="004453_0014_100D9E789D5195B0"/>
hear come in, by two o' Clock in the Morning, to pour out their Hearts unto GOD. <HI>The Lord perform all their Petitions!</HI></P>
<P>Preach'd according to my Promise, to a nume∣rous and affected Audience of Officers; and of the Honourable Women,—not a few.— <HI>O that they may with Meekness receive the ingrafted Word! And that it may be a Means of saving their Souls!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, March</HI> 2. Spent Part of the Day in writing religious Letters. Din'd and Supp'd at Mr. <HI>A.</HI>'s, chief Civil Magistrate in <HI>Gibraltar</HI>; and was entertained with uncommon Love and Affection.</P>
<P>Expounded twice in the Church, as usual; and at Night had above three hundred Hearers. Among whom were many Officers, Ladies, and Doctor <HI>C.</HI> the Minister of the Church, him∣self; who would have had me went up into the Reading Desk, that I might have the greater Command of the People. But I declin'd it that Night.— GOD <HI>be prais'd, for sending me abroad, and prospering the Work of his Hands upon me!</HI></P>
<L>When all thy Mercies, O my God!</L>
<L>My rising Soul surveys,</L>
<L>Transported with thy Love, I'm l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st</L>
<L>In Wonder, Love and Praise!</L>
<P><HI>Friday, March</HI> 3. Still GOD lets me see greater Things than before. <HI>O that my Thanks may increase proportionably!</HI></P>
<P>This Morning, besides a great Number of Soldiers, near, if not more than a Dozen of the Town's People, came to Church, to hear me
<PB N="15" REF="004453_0015_100D9E7A2DF019F0"/>
expound. Afterwards we breakfasted with a Gentlewoman, who sent by Major <HI>S.</HI> to invite us, and most gladly received us, into her House. About Ten, I preach'd my Sermon against Swearing, and made a Farewel Application to the Soldiers that were going over to <HI>Georgia,</HI> out of that Garrison. The Governor had that Morning review'd them. I desired they might be order'd to come to Church, that I might have an Opportunity of telling them how to behave, in that Land, which they were going over the Sea to protect. The Colonel and Governor most readily consented, and there was a most thronged Audience. GOD was pleased to set his Seal to my Sermon. Many Officers and Soldiers wept sorely; and a visible Alteration was observ'd in the Garrison, for some Days afterward. <HI>O that their Convictions may end in their Conversion, and that they may bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit!</HI></P>
<P>Bought some Wine▪ with the Money I had collected for the Use of the sick Poor in <HI>Georgia. The Parsonage House ought to be — the Poor's Storehouse.</HI></P>
<P>Had above five hundred to hear me expound this Evening; and went up into the Desk, with the Advice of Dr. <HI>C.</HI> who now constantly makes one of my Hearers. After this we supp'd at Mr. <HI>B</HI>—'s, and return'd Home with Joy and great Gladness of Heart. <HI>Who can express the loving Kindness of the Lord, or shew forth all his Praise!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, March</HI> 4. Expounded in the Morning; more Hearers than ever, some of
<PB N="16" REF="004453_0016_100D9E7C1389C908"/>
which wept. — Din'd and Supp'd at General <HI>C</HI>—'s, who sent last Night to invite me and my Friend; treated us with particular Respect.</P>
<P>I went in the Afternoon to the <HI>Jewish</HI> Syna∣gogue, and was surprised to see one of the Head of them come from the further End, and put me into one of their chief Seats. But afterwards he told me, he had heard my Sermon yesterday against Swearing, and thank'd me for it. <HI>Not unto me, not unto me, O Lord! but unto thy Name, be all the Thanks and Glory.</HI></P>
<P>I continued with them their whole Service; and spent most of my Time in secret Prayer to GOD, <HI>that the Veil might be taken from their Hearts; and that blessed Time might come, when his chosen People should again be ingrafted into their own Olive-tree, and all</HI> Israel <HI>be saved!</HI></P>
<P>Visited an unhappy Man in Prison; who last Night, in a drunken Fit, murder'd a Fellow Soldier. I providentially met him just as he was apprehended, and laid before him the Terrors of the Lord. At first he seem'd unconcern'd; but in a short Time he was pricked to the Heart; desired me to come and see him, and to-day trembled, and wept bitterly. O <HI>Drun∣kenness! what Mischief hast thou done! Thy Name is Legion; for, behold! a Troop of Sins cometh along with thee.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening, I had near, if not more than a thousand Hearers; and I took Occasion from the poor Man's Wickedness and Misfortune, to warn the Soldiery, not to be drunk with <HI>Wine, wherein is Excess. A Sin that easily bes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts the
<PB N="17" REF="004453_0017_100D9E7E83A41D18"/>
Men of</HI> Gibraltar! <HI>May they hear and fear, and sin no more presumptuously!</HI></P>
<P>I had a great Hoarseness upon me, but not∣withstanding, GOD enabled me to speak with Power. <HI>When we are weak, then are we strong! What Mercies hath</HI> GOD <HI>shewn me this last Week! O that my Friends, when they hear of it, may praise Him! For surely,</HI> GOD <HI>hath hearkened to my Prayer!</HI> —</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, March</HI> 5. After Morning Exposition in the Church, went and saw the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholics at High Mass; and shall only make this Remark; —<HI>That there needs no other Argument against Po∣pery, than to see the Pageantry, Superstition, and Idolatry of their Worship.</HI></P>
<P>About Ten, went to the Church belonging to the Garison. Preach'd to a most throng'd Audience, and received what my Soul long'd after,— the Sacrament of CHRIST'S most blessed Body and Blood. Both the Generals were there, and near fifty more Communicants. The Weekly Collection for the Poor was larger than ever was known; and Dr. <HI>C.</HI> was so affected, that he wish'd himself a <HI>despised</HI> METHODIST. <HI>We are not fit for</HI> GOD <HI>to work by, till we are despised by Men; that the Excellency and Power of Preaching may be seen to be from</HI> GOD <HI>only.</HI></P>
<P>Din'd at Governour <HI>S</HI>—'s; and at the Request of the Inhabitants and Gentlemen of the Garison, preach'd a searching Sermon in the Afternoon. Expounded in the Evening, to above a thousand Hearers, of all Denominations. Supp'd with General <HI>C.</HI> and went Home betimes, full of
<PB N="18" REF="004453_0018_100D9E80C3519048"/>
unspeakable Comfort.— <HI>I am never better, than when I am on the full Stretch for</HI> GOD. <HI>Grant that I may not, like</HI> Jehu, <HI>drive furiously at first, and afterwards fall back; but, forgetting those Things which are behind, may I reach out to those Things which are before, and press forward to∣ward the Mark, for the Prize of my high Calling in</HI> CHRIST JESUS. Methinks I hear my dear Friends say, silently, AMEN; <HI>and may the Great</HI> GOD <HI>say so too!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, March</HI> 6. Had near, if not more than a Thousand, at Morning Exposition; and it being the last Day of my Sojourning at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> many came to me weeping, telling me what God had done for their Souls; desiring my Prayers, and promising me theirs in Return. Others both gave and sent me Tokens of their Love, — as Cake, Figs, Wine, Eggs, and other Necessari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s for my Voyage; and seem'd to want Words to express their Affection. — <HI>Surely they would have plucked out their own Eyes to have given me. — The good Lord note their Kindness in his Book, and reward them a thousand-fold!</HI></P>
<P>About Twelve, went to the Church, accord∣ing to Appointment; and made a farewel Ex∣hortation, as GOD gave me Utterance, to a great Number of weeping Soldiers, Women, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then kneel'd down, and having recommended each other to the Care of GOD, I left them; went out and took my Leave of the two Generals. Visited the confin'd Prisoner. Din'd at a Gen∣tlewoman's House in the Town. Left near fifty Letters to be sent to <HI>England,</HI> and about
<PB N="19" REF="004453_0019_100D9E8357B9D658"/>
Four went on Board; accompanied to the Sea-side with near 200 Soldiers, Women, Officers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who all sorrow'd at my Departure, and wish'd me good Luck, in the Name of the Lord. <HI>Surely I may now expect greater Success abroad, having such an Addition of Intercessors on my Behalf! O Lord, put their Tears into thy Bottle: and let their Cry come unto Thee!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Samson's</HI> Riddle has been fulfill'd at <HI>Gibraltar; out of the Eater came forth Meat, out of the Strong came forth Sweetness.</HI> Who more unlikely to be wrought upon, than Soldiers! — And yet, among any Set of People I have been, where has GOD made his Power more to be known! Many that were quite stark Blind, have received their Sight; many that have fallen back, have re∣lented, and turned unto the Lord again; many that were ashamed to own CHRIST openly, have waxen bold; and many that were Saints, have had their Hearts fill'd with Joy unspeakable, and full of Glory. <HI>This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our Eyes! May he give a Blessing to the Books dispersed among them, and perfect the good Work begun in their Hearts, till the Day of the Lord</HI> JESUS! <HI>May they be my Joy and Crown of Rejoicing at the last Day! And may</HI> GOD<HI>'s Mercies to me in every Place make me more humble, more zealous, more thankful, and more ready to do, or suffer, whatever my dear Redeemer has allotted for me. Into his Hands I commend my Spirit, as into the Hands of an all-powerful Preserver.</HI></P>
<P>About Five, came on Board, and was most
<PB N="20" REF="004453_0020_100D9E84E6A14458"/>
gladly received by my Flock; whom I hope to love better, for being a little absent from them. Interceeded, and gave Thanks (as usual) at Night upon Deck; and was pleased that I was again retir'd from the World. It rain'd much, but that made as the more fervent. <HI>Water us, O Lord, we beseech thee, with the Dew of thy heavenly Benediction!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, March</HI> 7. Went and conversed with, and dispersed some proper Books among the Soldiers that we took from <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> Three of them belonged to one of the Societies. and desired, with some others, to sail in our Ship. GOD <HI>sanctify my Ministry unto them!</HI> Most of them are of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Church, but seemed very willing to conform. <HI>What a Pity is it,</HI> CHRIST<HI>'s seamless Coat should be rent in pieces on Account of Things, in themselves purely indifferent!</HI></P>
<P>At Dinner we were like to be struck against, by the Man of War. I saw it coming, and composed my self for Death; but GOD had Mercy on us▪ commanded the Wind to shift about, and deliver'd us out of so great a Danger. <HI>O that we may shew forth our Thankfulness, not only with our Lips, but in our Lives! How ought Creatures to live, who are every Moment liable to be called by Death to Judgment!</HI></P>
<P>This Day set sail from <HI>Gibraltar</HI>; at first the Wind was fair, but afterwards blew contrary; which made both me and many others sick. I should have wonder'd if GOD had not sent me a Thorn in the Flesh, after such abundant Success. <HI>May I learn to</HI> SUFFER, <HI>as well as</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>thy Will, O</HI> GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="004453_0021_100D9E88170A25C8"/>Had useful Conference with Capt. <HI>M.</HI> who was an Instrument (under God) of introducing me at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and who, I trust, will make a devout Centurion. <HI>Grant this, heavenly Father, for thy dear Son's sake.</HI></P>
<P>Finish'd my Exposition on the Creed, in the great Cabin, and did my other Duty in the Ship as usual. The Wind blew hard, and GOD sent abroad his Lightnings great Part of the Day. <HI>J. D.</HI> my Friend <HI>H.</HI> and my self also, were sick, but not so, as to prevent our Intercession for absent Friends. <HI>Whatever befalls me, O Lord, may I never forget their Works and Labour of Love; as yet, blessed be</HI> GOD! <HI>they are always on my Mind, and I bear them on my Heart, when∣soever I go in, and from before the Lord.</HI> And nothing does and will support me more, under all Crosses, than the Hopes of seeing them grown in Grace, when I return to <HI>England. O</HI> GOD, <HI>prepare me for so great a Blessing!</HI></P>
<P>Gave my self (as much as my Indisposition of Body would give me Leave) to the Word of GOD, and Prayer; and was much affected with what is said of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> that because he was not thankful enough, <HI>for the great Things</HI> GOD <HI>had done for him, he was permitted to fall, thro' the Pride of his Heart. Alas! What Danger am I in of sharing the same Fate! O my Friends, cry mightily to</HI> GOD, <HI>that no such Evil come upon me!</HI></P>
<P>Married a Couple on Deck; Capt. <HI>M.</HI> Capt. <HI>W. &amp;c.</HI> attended very orderly. I endeavour'd to give them a suitable Exhortation, after the Solemnity was over; and hope this Couple did
<PB N="22" REF="004453_0022_100D9E8BB50D6BC0"/>
call CHRIST to their Marriage. <HI>It's through a Neglect of this, that we have so few happy Matches.</HI></P>
<P>The contrary Wind still continuing, my Sea-Sickness increas'd most bravely, so that I was obliged to omit reading Prayers to the Soldiers, and to go to Bed sooner than usual. I find this Sickness will purge my Body, and hope, thro' Grace, it will purify my Soul. — <HI>Every Branch that beareth Fruit, says Christ, my Father purgeth it, that it may bring forth more Fruit. May that Scripture be fulfilled in my Heart!</HI></P>
<P>My bodily Indisposition still increased. There was a great Storm without; but, blessed be GOD! a Calm within. Sometimes indeed my Will would inwardly rebel, which plainly shew'd me, what a Distance I was from GOD; but I hope through inward, and outward Sufferings, I shall at length be able to say in all Things, — <HI>Fat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, not my Will, but thine be done.</HI></P>
<P>Did my usual Duty in the great Cabin; and began expounding the ten Commandments. Interceded for Friends on Deck; and went to Bed, full of a Sense of my own Unworthiness. <HI>O that I could always see my self in my proper Colours! I believe I should have little Reason to fall down and worship myself. — God be merciful to me, a Sinner!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, March</HI> 11. Blessed be God, the Storm this Morning began to blow over, and Light broke in upon my Soul. Was enabled to read Prayers, and expound both in the Cabin,
<PB N="23" REF="004453_0023_100D9E8D46DD2808"/>
and to the Soldiers, with more Vigour than I have since I left <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> Had Reason to think that Capt. <HI>M.</HI> grew in Grace, and that my late Indisposition had been sanctify'd unto me. <HI>Suffering Times are Christians best improving Times; for they break the Will; wean us from the Creature; prove the Heart; and by them God teacheth his Children, as</HI> Gideon, <HI>by Thorns and Briars, taught the Men of</HI> Succoth.</P>
<P>All the Time of my Indisposition, my dear Friend <HI>H.</HI> mourn'd over me like a Dove. <HI>Blessed be God, Familiarity does not breed Contempt be∣tween us; but our Love to each other increases daily.</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>is the only Rock, whereon true Friendship can be built.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, March</HI> 12. Expounded with more Inlargement than usual; and gave my People Notice, that I intended to speak to them, one by one; to see what Account they could give of their Faith. — <HI>I have not ceased warning every one of you,</HI> says the Apostle. — <HI>May I follow his Steps!</HI></P>
<P>Preach'd the Sermon (GOD enabled me to make, in the Storm, before we came to <HI>Gibraltar</HI>) in the great Cabbin, and GOD was pleas'd to set his Seal to it. Had some close Conversation with some of my Companions, about their <HI>Interior.</HI> Interceded for absent Friends, and have Reason to hope, my weak Efforts had not been in vain in the Lord. <HI>May God give me a thankful Heart!</HI></P>
<P>Blessed be God, this is the most comfortable Day I have had since I came last on Board. Slept better than usual. Was enabled to compose
<PB N="24" REF="004453_0024_100D9E8F25F529C0"/>
freely. Perceiv'd my Appetite to return. Was inlarg'd more, in Intercession, and found I had Reason to give Thanks for my late Indispo∣sition.— <HI>O, how gently does my gracious Master deal with me! Tho' Sorrow may endure for a Night, yet Joy cometh in the Morning. Lord, grant that I may spend that Health thou hast now restored to me, to thy Honour and Service. 'Tis good for me, that I have been a little chastised; for who knows but that I might otherwise have perish'd, by being lifted up above Measure with my late Success! Lord, give me Humility, tho' it be by Sufferings; so shall thy Blessings never prove my Ruin!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, March</HI> 14. Began to put in Execu∣tion what I proposed on <HI>Sunday.</HI> Inquired into the Faith of those committed to my Charge; and tho' all of them were not so great Pro∣ficients as I could wish, yet I find they know enough to save them, if they put what they know into Practice. So that they can't charge GOD, if they miscarry. <HI>O that the Lord may give them all his Blessing!</HI></P>
<P>Had much of the Presence of GOD with me; and felt such a fervent Love for my Christian Friends, that I feared how I should behave, was GOD to call any of them from me. <HI>But I trust, sufficient for such an Hour w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld be the Strength thereof.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, March</HI> 15. Was pleased much with my present Situation; and had Reason to bless GOD for some farther visible Effects of my Ministry. Was highly delighted in seeing Friend
<PB N="25" REF="004453_0025_100D9E92371234A0"/>
<HI>H.</HI> active in teaching the Lambs of my Flock. He has now got a regular School, and the Children begin to come to it, at regular and set Hours. Several also of the Soldiers learn'd to write and read; so that my Friend is likely to make a useful Man. GOD <HI>make him more and more so every Day.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, March</HI> 16. Preach'd this Afternoon my Sermon against Swearing; at which several of the Soldiers wept. Blessed be God, that Sin is much abated among us; and I think a visible Reformation may be perceiv'd thro' the whole Ship. <HI>Not unto me, not unto me, but unto thy Name be the Glory, O Lord!</HI></P>
<P>Was much strengthen'd in my present Undertaking, by reading the Story of <HI>Ezra</HI>; and join'd in Intercession with those, who set apart this Day, as a Day of Fasting and Prayer, for the Sins of the Nation to which we belong. <HI>May they prove as effectual as those, which</HI> Moses <HI>put up for the Children of</HI> Israel.</P>
<P>The Sick increased to-day. Visited near <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Dozen. <HI>May I, by thus frequent visiting Sick-beds, learn to improve my Time of Health. For, alas! what can be done in Time of Sickness!</HI> I find but few that are able with any tolerable Patience to sustain their bodily Infirmities; but to have a wounded Spirit at the same Time, — <HI>Good</HI> GOD! <HI>who can bear it!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, March</HI> 17. Last Night God sent us a fair Wind, and we began to sail more pleasantly. I was comforted on every side, and enabled to
<PB N="26" REF="004453_0026_100D9E9543DD0768"/>
intercede fervently for all Mankind. <HI>O that the Love of</HI> GOD <HI>and Man was shed abroad in my Heart!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, March</HI> 18. The Weather being exceeding fair, and the Sea calm, I went with Capt. <HI>W.</HI> on board the <HI>Lightfoot,</HI> and din'd with the Gentlemen belonging to the Ship, and Col. <HI>C.</HI> who came on board to pay them a Visit. Marry'd a Couple. Dispers'd Bibles, Testaments, Soldier's Monitors, among the Men. Exchang'd some Books for some Cards, which I threw over∣board. Preach'd a Sermon against Drunkenness, which GOD enabled me to finish Yesterday; and returned in the Evening, highly delighted with seeing the Porpusses roll about the great Deep. <HI>O Lord! the Sea is full of thy Riches! Mar∣vellous are thy Works, and that my Soul knoweth right well! O that I may live to praise thee for them! What Mercies have I received this Week! They are more in Number than the Hairs of my Head! O that my Friends would give Thanks for me!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, March</HI> 19. Went on board the <HI>Amy</HI>▪ Read Prayers, and preach'd to above 200 Hearers, and marry'd a Couple, which did not behave so well as I could wish. The Bridegroom laugh'd several Times, in the midst of the Solemnity; on which I shut up the Book; but he shewing his Repentance by Weeping, I then proceeded, and gave to him and the Bride a Bible, as the best Present I could <HI>make them,</HI> and exhorted all to Holiness of Life. GOD <HI>give them a hearing Ear, and an obedient Heart</HI>!</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="004453_0027_100D9E985AB64990"/>Din'd with Col. <HI>C.</HI> who treated us with the utmost Civility; and took Care to dispose of some Books I brought with me, to proper Persons.</P>
<P>About Three we return'd to the <HI>Whitaker.</HI> Read Prayers, and preach'd my Sermon against Drunkenness. After which, Capt. <HI>M.</HI> made a useful Speech to the Men; and exhorted them to give Heed to the Things which had been spoken. <HI>Religion is likely to go on well, when both the Civil and Ecclesiastical Powers are engaged in keeping up the Purity of it. But, Lord, unless thou assist us, all our Endeavours are but in vain. Vouchsafe then, we beseech thee, to give us thy Blessing.</HI></P>
<P>Had above an Hour's close Conversation with my Companions, concerning their <HI>Interior,</HI> and walk'd with Friend <HI>H.</HI> upon Deck, till Twelve at Night, admiring GOD's Wonders in the Deep. <HI>Blessed be</HI> GOD, <HI>for sending us abroad!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, March</HI> 20. To-day Col. <HI>C.</HI> came to dine with us; and in the midst of our Meal we were entertain'd with a most agreeable Sight. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a Shark, about the Length of a Man, who followed our Ship, attended with five little Fishes, called the <HI>Pilot-Fish</HI>; much like unto a Mackarel, but larger. These (I am told) always keep the Shark Company; and, what is more surprising, tho' the Shark is so ravenous a Creature, yet, let him be ever so hungry, he never touches one of them, nor are they less faithful to him; for if at any time the Shark is hook'd, these little Creatures will not forsake
<PB N="28" REF="004453_0028_100D9E99ECE266F8"/>
him, but cleave close to his Fins, and are often taken up with him. — <HI>Go to the</HI> Pilot-Fish, <HI>thou that forsakest a Friend in Adversity; consider his Ways, and be abashed.</HI> — This single Sight (one would think) is sufficient to confute any Atheist, if there be such a Fool as a speculative Atheist in the World.</P>
<P>After Dinner I read Prayers, and expounded to my own People, and then went on board the <HI>Amy,</HI> with kind Col. <HI>C.</HI> who used me with uncommon Civility. Marry'd a Couple, and came back to the <HI>Whitaker,</HI> rejoicing to see the Works of the Lord in the Beauty of the great Deep. <HI>Who would but come abroad!</HI></P>
<P>Had near two Hours close Conversation with Capt. <HI>M.</HI> in whom appear'd many Marks of the <HI>New-Birth.</HI> Surely he will prove a devout Centurion. <HI>How shall I be constrain'd, 'till it be accomplished!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, March</HI> 21. Had fresh Reason to be thankful. Capt. <HI>M.</HI> made me a kind Present. The Weather exceeding pleasant, and, what was the greatest Blessing of all,— GOD's holy Spirit seem'd to be moving on the Faces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the Souls in the Ship. The Weather growing warmer, Friend <HI>H.</HI> had some Cloths hung over to cover his School. His Children come very regularly both to learn, and to say their Prayers at Night. Capt. <HI>W.</HI> takes great Delight in them. Capt. <HI>M.</HI> much encourages the Soldiers to learn to read and write; so that we begin to live as regular now, as we could wish to do on Shore. <HI>Blessed be</HI> GOD, <HI>for thus making his Power to be known!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="004453_0029_100D9E9CC6B7F0B0"/>Tho' GOD gives me so much Comfort, yet my dear <HI>England</HI>-Friends are seldom out of my Mind. Tho' absent in Body, I am present with them in Spirit. <HI>The Lord direct my Way unto them, and grant, if ever I return, it may be in the Fulness of the Blessing of the Gospel of Peace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, March</HI> 22. Saw a large Grampus rolling and spouting out Water, for a long while▪ at a short Distance from our Ship. It put me in mind of the Behemoth, spoken of by holy <HI>Job</HI>; and of the Leviathan mentioned by the Royal Psalmist. <HI>O</HI> GOD! <HI>who is like unto thee!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, March</HI> 23. This Morning began to have Prayers at Six o' Clock, and the Drum beat to call the People. Methinks we grow more and more regular every Day. GOD <HI>be praised!</HI></P>
<P>Was very fervent in Intercession for absent Friends, and all Mankind. <HI>O! Intercession is a most delightful Exercise! How does it sweeten and purify the Heart!</HI></P>
<P>Visited near twelve or fourteen sick Persons, and yet such is GOD's Mercy to me, that though the Place where they lie, is much confined, and they catch the Fever one of another, yet GOD keeps me from Infection. <HI>The Way of Duty is the Way of Safety. Now</HI> God <HI>hath sent his Visitation abroad among us, I hope we shall learn Righteousness!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, March</HI> 24. To-day the Sick still increased, and Friend <HI>H.</HI> very ready to assist and carry Things to them. <HI>Nothing more
<PB N="30" REF="004453_0030_100D9E9FCCFD2648"/>
useful than the visiting Sick-Beds. How are those to be pitied, who barbarously shun such im∣proving Sights!</HI></P>
<P>Had still fresh Reason to bless GOD for the Success of my Ministry, — <HI>Not unto me, not unto me, but unto thy Name, be all the Glory!</HI> We begin now to live so happy on Ship-board, that I believe we shall part from each other with Regret. <HI>By this may all Men know that we are</HI> CHRIST<HI>'s Disciples, that we love one another.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, March</HI> 25. Sail'd 154 Miles the last 24 Hours. Was much delighted in seeing many Porpusses playing about the Ship; one of which Capt. <HI>W.</HI> catch'd, and Part of its Liver we had dressed for Dinner. It had a Head much like a Pig, and about six Feet long. <HI>The Works of the Lord are exceeding great and to be admired of all them that have a Delight in Him.</HI></P>
<P>Church'd a Woman, who lately was deli∣ver'd of a dead Child; and afterwards gave her an Exhortation applicable to her Circum∣stances. GOD <HI>grant she may apply it to her Heart!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, March</HI> 26. This Day I hope GOD magnified his Power, in the Conversion of a young Gentleman on Board, whom he had been pleased to visit with a Fever. His Convictions were strong; and, as far as I could find, a thorough Renovation begun in his Heart. <HI>The good Lord perfect it, till the Day of his Dissolu∣tion! Now</HI> GOD <HI>begins to shew me wherefore He hath sent me. O that I was humble! that I
<PB N="31" REF="004453_0031_100D9EA1A6C041F0"/>
might be fit for the</HI> HIGH <HI>and</HI> LOFTY ONE, <HI>which inhabiteth Eternity, to work by!</HI></P>
<P>Preach'd a Sermon in the Afternoon, on <HI>Luke</HI> iii.14. <HI>And the Soldiers likewise came unto Him, and demanded, saying, And what must we do? And he said unto them, Do Violence to no Man, neither accuse any Man falsly, and be content with your Wages.</HI> I made it at the Request of Capt. <HI>M.</HI> who seems in earnest about the great Work of his Salvation. He has read <HI>Arnd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s True Christianity,</HI> and is now reading <HI>Law's Christian Perfection</HI>; Books worth their Weight in Gold, and which GOD has blessed to the Conversion of many. <HI>But what are Books without thy Spirit, O Lord! Do thou bless them unto him, and they shall be blessed.</HI></P>
<P>Exchanged some bad Books that were on Board, (which I threw immediately into the Sea) for some good ones. Blessed be GOD! all I have found them with, (as yet) have been ready to surrender them up; and I find it by daily Ex∣perience more and more, that People who are thoroughly awakened to a Sense of the divine Life, cannot bear to read any thing trifling; but throw away their useless Books, as those did the Books of Divination and curious Arts, which we read of in the <HI>Acts,</HI> who were converted by St. <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, March</HI> 27. Last Night GOD was pleased to take away a black Boy of Capt. <HI>Wh—'s,</HI> after he had been ill of a violent Fever for some Days. — He was never baptized, but I had a Commission from his Master (who
<PB N="32" REF="004453_0032_100D9EA3508B65B8"/>
seem'd much affected at his Death) to instruct and baptize him, if it pleased GOD he should recover; but GOD saw fit to order it otherwise: <HI>His holy Will be done!</HI> —</P>
<P>About Ten in the Morning, he was wrapped up in a Hammock, and thrown into the Sea. I could not read the Office over him, being un∣baptized; but Capt. <HI>M.</HI> order'd the Drum to beat, and I exhorted all the Soldiers, Sailors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as GOD gave me Utterance, to <HI>remember their</HI> CREATOR <HI>in the Days of their Youth, and prepare for the Time when the Sea should give up its Dead, and all Nations be called together, to appear before the</HI> SON <HI>of</HI> GOD. <HI>O that they may be made wise by it! that they may lay to Heart what has been said, and practically consider their latter End!</HI></P>
<P>Had our blessed Saviour been here, I believe he would have wept to see what Havock Sin has made among us. <HI>Do thou, Lord, teach us so to number our Days, that we may apply our Hearts to Wisdom.</HI></P>
<P>This Day Capt. <HI>M.</HI> began to come at Six in the Morning, and join in Prayers on Deck, instead of having Prayers in the great Cabin. Surely our Soldiers will be without Excuse, since their Captain leads so good an Example. Blessed be GOD, I have no Reason to complain of them, for they come very regularly twice a Day to Prayers; and an Oath seems to be a strange Thing among them. Many Marks of a sound Conversion appear in several on Board; and we live in perfect Harmony and Peace,
<PB N="33" REF="004453_0033_100D9EA5B0CEE368"/>
loving and beloved by one another. <HI>Surely, my Friends▪ your Prayers are heard; continue in∣stant in them, and you shall see greater Things than these; for</HI> GOD <HI>delights in the Prosperity of his Servants.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, March</HI> 29. Sail near 160 Miles every 24 Hours, for several Days. Most delightful pleasant Weather, and much of God's Presence among us.</P>
<L>Heav'n is, dear Lord, where-e'er thou art;</L>
<L>O! never, then, from us depart:</L>
<L>For to my Soul, 'tis Hell to be,</L>
<L>But for one Moment, void of thee.</L>
<P><HI>Thursday, March</HI> 30. Still more Fruits of a true Conversion being wrought in some in the Ship. I hope many of us shall have Reason to to bless GOD, for coming on Board the <HI>Whitaker. GOD grant, while I preach to others, I myself may not be a Cast-away.</HI> But God is Love; and he will not, if my <HI>Eye be single,</HI> let his Blessings destroy me. He preserved young <HI>David</HI> from <HI>Spiritual Pride,</HI> when the People cried out, Saul <HI>hath slain his Thousands, but</HI> David <HI>his Ten Thousands</HI>; and let the same Power be exerted in preserving me also, O my SAVIOUR!</P>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>Renew thy Likeness, <HI>LORD,</HI> in me;</L>
<L>Lovely and gentle may I be!</L>
<L>No Charms but these to thee are dear,</L>
<L>No Anger may'st thou ever find,</L>

<L>A patient and victorious Mind,</L>

<L>A Heart that no Desire can move,</L>

<P><HI>Friday, March</HI> 31. This being the Crucifixion of our blessed Lord, I preached a Sermon on the penitent Thief; and I hope God gave it his Blessing. We began Prayers later than usual; so, before I had done, Darkness came upon us, which put me in Mind of that Darkness which overwhelm'd the World, when the GOD of Nature suffer'd. <HI>O that our Hearts may rend like the Rocks, and our Souls arise from the Death of Sin, as the Bodies of those did from their Graves, to appear to many in the holy City, after our LORD's Resurrection!</HI></P>
<P>Had a good Instance of the Benefit of breaking Children's Wills betimes. Last Night, going between Decks, as I do every Night, to visit the Sick, and examine my People, I asked one of the Women to bid her little Boy, that stood by her, say his Prayers: She answer'd, his elder Sister would, but she could not make him. Upon this, I bid the Child kneel down before me, but he would not, till I took hold of his Feet, and forc'd him down. I then bid him say the Lord's Prayer, being informed by his Mother, he could say it if he would; but he obstinately refused, till at last, after I had given him several Blows, he said his Prayers as
<PB N="35" REF="004453_0035_100D9EAB2AECA9A8"/>
well as I could expect. I gave him some Figs for a Reward, and lo! this same Child, tho' not above four Years of Age, came to-night upon Deck, when the other Children came to say their Prayers, to my Friend <HI>H.</HI> and he burst out into a Flood of Tears, and would not go away till he had said his too.</P>
<P>I mention this as a Proof of the Necessity of early Correction. Children are sensible of it sooner than Parents imagine; and if they would but have Resolution to break their Wills throughly when young, the Work of Conversion would be much easier, and they would not be so troubled with perverse Children when they are old.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, April</HI> 1. Wonderful pleasant Sailing still; but, what was intirely better, had Reason to think several went forward in the great Work of their Salvation. <HI>O that we may be buried with</HI> CHRIST <HI>in Baptism, and rise with him to New∣ness of Life!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, April</HI> 2. Rose early this Morning, and join'd in Spirit with my dear absent Friends, who were receiving the Holy Eucharist, and celebrating our blessed Lord's Resurrection. I find my not being in Priest's Orders is a great Hindrance to my Ministry; which will oblige me to return to <HI>England</HI> as soon as possible. <HI>The good Lord prepare me for that second Imposition of Hands.</HI></P>
<P>Preached a Sermon in the Afternoon on <HI>Phi∣lippians</HI> ii.10. <HI>That I may know him, and the Power of his Resurrection. O that we may all experience it in our Hearts! for without it,</HI> Christ, <HI>as to us, is dead in vain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="004453_0036_100D9EACF60BE830"/><HI>Monday, April</HI> 3. Had some further Conver∣sation with the young Gentleman, whose Con∣version I mentioned before, and who, I hope, is quickened from above. He told me, he used to wonder to hear me talk, that all our Thoughts, Words and Actions, ought to be dedicated unto God; but now he perceived what I said to be true. <HI>How does the new Nature give us new Notions!</HI> It seems a difficult Task to the <HI>natural Man,</HI> to turn his whole Life into one continued Sacrifice; but the <HI>Spiritual Man</HI> does it with Ease. He feels a Divine Attraction in his Soul, which as sensibly draws his Heart towards God, as the Load-stone attracts the Needle. <HI>Draw us then, O GOD, and our Affections will ascend up after thee!</HI></P>
<P>About Eleven went on Board the <HI>Lightfoot.</HI> Pray'd with a sick Man. Preach'd my Sermon on the <HI>penitent Thief.</HI> Afterwards went on Board the <HI>Amy.</HI> Catechised the Children. Din'd of a Dolphin. Preach'd to the Soldiers. Return'd about Six. Read Prayers. Visited the Sick. Interceded for Friends, and went to Bed blessing and praising God.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 7. Great Enlargement of Heart has been given me for these four Days last past; par∣ticularly to-day, in which God hath vouchsafed me much of his Presence, and assisting Grace. Observed still strong Signs of a thorough Con∣version being wrought in some on Board. Had most delightful Sailing, and every Thing that is pleasant, as this vain World can afford. These are Preparatives for future Trials. <HI>Welcome
<PB N="37" REF="004453_0037_100D9EAF485C6180"/>
in the Name of</HI> God! <HI>He will uphold me, if it be not for the Corruptions of my own Heart, which are continually creeping up. What have I to disturb my Peace? But as long as those</HI> Amalekites <HI>remain in my Soul, I shall never be perfectly at Ease.</HI> LORD, <HI>keep me but striving, and I shall at last be more than Conqueror, through</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>that loved me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 8. Went on Board the <HI>Lightfoot,</HI> and <HI>Amy</HI>; and preached to the Soldiers of each Ship. Din'd with Colonel <HI>C.</HI> who continues extremely civil; and at my Return, found the Sick increase on my Hands. But few of the Ship escape! <HI>The good Lord make all their Beds in their Sickness!</HI> Had much of God with me to∣day. The Heat uncommonly temperate, as it has been for some time. The Ship sail'd all Day, as tho' she was carried on the Wings of the Wind. Preached two Sermons, besides my Exposition at Six in the Morning, and I hope God set his Seal to them. Was well pleased to hear by my Friend <HI>H.</HI> (who is very active in carrying Things to the Sick) that the poor People between Decks pray'd heartily for me and Capt. <HI>M.</HI> who seems to improve every Day. And now indeed we live more comfortably in the great Cabin, than can easily be imagin'd. We talk of little else but GOD and CHRIST. GOD has greatly blessed — the <HI>Country Parson's Advice to his Parishioners,</HI> to Capt. <HI>W.</HI> and scarce a Word is to be heard among us, when we are together, but what has reference to our <HI>Fall,</HI> in the <HI>First,</HI> and our <HI>new Birth</HI> in the <HI>second
<PB N="38" REF="004453_0038_100D9EB293D56868"/>
Adam,</HI>— the LORD from Heaven. So that we all (I trust) are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>solved to put my Afternoon's Text into Practice, and are determined not <HI>to know any Thing, save</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>and him crucified. Grant this, O Father, for thy dear</HI> SON<HI>'s sake! O that I knew how to be thankful! O that▪ Heaven and Earth would join with us, in praising God! For,</HI></P>
<L>I would not, <HI>LORD,</HI> alone</L>
<L>Thy Praises celebrate;</L>
<L>I'd call the blessed Angels down,</L>
<L>I'd move the World's united State,</L>
<L>Till they in Fervence, all</L>
<L>Thy gracious Acts relate.</L>
<P><HI>April</HI> 10, and 11. Spent good Part of these two Days in mending my Nets. Had ex∣ceeding pleasant Weather. Some more of the Sailors were convinced of Sin; and others send Notes to be prayed for, and give T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anks as regularly as in any Parish. <HI>Blessed be</HI> God, <HI>we live very comfortably!</HI></P>
<P>To-day Capt. <HI>Wh</HI>— caught a Dolphin, which was most beautiful when drawn out of the Water, but his Colours soon change. <HI>Just so is Man</HI>: He flourisheth for a little while, but when once Death cometh, how quickly is his Beauty gone! <HI>A Christian may learn a Lesson of Instruction from every Thing he meets with.</HI></P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 14. To-day I could have wished for some young Prodigal aboard the <HI>Whitaker,</HI> to see one of our Soldiers dying. Alas! How did his Breast heave, his Heart pant, and great
<PB N="39" REF="004453_0039_100D9EB4E8E14560"/>
Drops of Sweat trickle down his Face! His Eyes looked ghastly, and the whole Man was in a bitter Agony! Capt. <HI>Wh</HI>— went down be∣tween Decks with me once or twice to see him, and I used the last Prayer over him several times. About Nine at Night he expired, I fear, without Hope; for he killed himself with drinking. <HI>O that all Drunkards would learn from him, to be wise in Time, and practically consider their latter End!</HI></P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 15. This Morning I buried the dead Soldier, in Time of public Prayers. Chose pro∣per Lessons, and gave the Soldiers a suitable Ex∣hortation. But I was so affected with a Sense of the Misery of fallen Man, that I could not speak with my usual Vigour. JESUS <HI>wept!</HI></P>
<P>To-day was call'd in a Hurry to pray by one of the devout Soldiers, who came from <HI>Gibral∣tar,</HI> and who was suppos'd to be expiring. I came; I saw; I rejoiced in Spirit, for his Soul seem'd full of GOD. Instead of being affrigh∣ted at the Approach of the King of Terrors, he welcom'd it, and said he was going to his dear Redeemer. Then he fell, as it were, into a Trance, and pour'd out his Heart in repeating some very applicable Verses out of the Psalms, on which we thought he would have died. But lo! GOD brought him from the nethermost Hell! for that Instant the Fever left him, and he recover'd. <HI>O what Difference is there be∣tween him that feareth</HI> GOD, <HI>and him that feareth him not, in their last Hours!</HI> LORD, <HI>let me die the Death of the Righteous, and let my future State be like his.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="004453_0040_100D9EB7AC1EA1C8"/>Exercis'd a little Discipline this Evening on a Boy, whom Capt. <HI>M.</HI> had taken Notice of a∣bove a Week agone, for behaving ill at Church; and said he would deliver him up to me. I therefore, by the Advice of his Master, order'd him to be ty'd, 'till he could repeat the 51st Psalm, which he repeated to-night very solemn∣ly, in the midst of the Congregation. <HI>May it be a Warning to him for the future!</HI></P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 16. Read Prayers. Expounded at Six in the Morning, and preach'd at Ten to my own People. Then went and preach'd on board the <HI>Lightfoot,</HI> and afterwards din'd. Read Prayers, and preach'd on board the <HI>Amy.</HI> Return'd a∣bout Five in the Evening to the <HI>Whitaker.</HI> Read Prayers and preach'd. Visited the Sick, and went to Bed, blessing GOD for the Strength of the Day.—All the Officers continue extremely kind; and some, studious to oblige me all they can.—<HI>The Good Lord reward them a thousand-fold!</HI></P>
<P>This Evening I was sent for by a Sailor, who had been the most remarkable Swearer on board, and whom I in an especial manner warn'd about two Days agone; telling him, I believ'd GOD would remarkably visit him, as well as the o∣thers. He laughed and said, he hoped not. But to-night he sent for me trembling, and burning with a scorching Fever; told me what grievous Sins he had been guilty of, and pray'd most fer∣vently for Repentance.— Two or three of the same Stamp have been taken in the like manner. <HI>God grant they may flee from the Wrath to come! Sinner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must either bend or break.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="004453_0041_100D9EB962162688"/><HI>April</HI> 18. Greatly delighted in seeing two Water Spouts. One of which ran along for se∣veral Miles, and, by the especial Providence of GOD, escaped us. We saw it coming, and were surprised to observe a sudden Calm for a∣bout six Minutes round the <HI>Whitaker,</HI> when the other Parts of the Sea boil'd like a Pot. But surely the everlasting I AM said unto the Sea at that Instant, <HI>Let there be a Calm in that Place.</HI> For by that means our Ship was immediately stopp'd in her Course, and so the Water Spout passed by, before we came up to it; otherwise it would have torn our Sails in Pieces. GOD's Hand was so visible in this, that several said, they never beheld the like before. <HI>O how does Providence wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h over us, when we think nothing of it! Who would but live well, to be under the immediate Protection of such an over∣ruling Power?</HI></P>
<P>After this several Squalls came upon us, which afforded me glorious Matter for adoring that great GOD, whom Winds and Storms obey. — The Sailors were in great Hurry and Con∣fusion, but, to my Comfort, not one single Oath was heard all the while. — A Proof this, that Sailors may pull the Ropes, without swearing; and that the Words spoken to them, have not altogether fallen to the Ground. — <HI>Blessed be God!</HI></P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 22. Fled, as it were, on the Wings of the Wind, for some Days past. Sometimes 170, sometimes 178 Miles in 24 Hours. I find GOD generally sends us the strongest Winds,
<PB N="42" REF="004453_0042_100D9EBBCA5372A8"/>
when nearest our Port. <HI>May I learn from hence a Lesson of Instruction; and the nearer I come to my Haven of eternal Rest, the quicker may I move!</HI></P>
<P>Spent most of this Day in writing Letters to my dear Friends in <HI>England.</HI> In particular, Supplication for Direction how to act, in the Land whither I am going. The Thoughts of my own Weakness, and the Greatness of those Trials, which I must necessarily expect, fill me with an holy Dread. But wherefore do I fear? The Eternal, Almighty, I AM, hath sent me, and will, no Doubt, protect me.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 23. Preach'd twice to-day to my People, and spent most of the rest of the Day in earnest Prayer for the Divine Assistance, in my present Undertaking; being, as we imagin'd, near the Haven where we would be. The Morning Lessons were exceeding applicable, so that we could not help taking Notice of it. <HI>By this I know</HI> GOD <HI>favours me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 1. This Morning went out on Deck; after being confin'd to my Bed for a Week by a violent Fever, with which all, except three or four in the Ship, have been visited. I was blooded thrice; vomited once, and blister'd; and, blessed be GOD, can say, <HI>'tis good for me that I have been afflicted</HI>; for as Affliction abounded, Consolation much more abounded, and God enabled me to <HI>rejoice with Joy unspeak∣able and full of Glory. Satan desired to have me, to sift me as Wheat; but</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>pray'd for me, and my Faith fail'd not.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="004453_0043_100D9EBEAAFDDFE8"/>I have all the Conveniencies I could have on Shore. Capt. <HI>W.</HI> turn'd out of his own Bed for me. <HI>J. D.</HI> and Mr. <HI>H.</HI> sat up with me every Night, and nothing was wanting to make my Sickness comfortable and easy. <HI>Blessed be</HI> GOD, <HI>for these abundant Mercies in</HI> CHRIST JESUS!</P>
<P>I hope I shall now experimentally sympathize with those that are sick; and learn to be more tender-hearted to my Fellow Christians. I am <HI>now made whole. May I sin no more,</HI> but be more fervent in Spirit, serving the Lord, <HI>lest a worse Evil befal me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 5. About Ten o' Clock this Morning, buried the Cook of the Ship, who expired last Night. I could have wish'd for a thousand Tongues, to have sounded a loud Alarm to my People; but the Sight of the Corps, and the Weakness of my Body, would but just permit me to read out the Office. <HI>Lord what is Man! O! why are others taken, and I left, but that</HI> GOD<HI>'s Long-suffering should lead me to Repentance! Grant it, O Lord, for thy dear</HI> SON<HI>'s sake.</HI></P>
<P>In the Afternoon privately, I baptiz'd a new-born Infant. Thus it is; some coming into the World, others going out of it continually. <HI>Good God, who can desire to live here always.</HI></P>
<P>After having lain about the Coast for a Week, this Afternoon we saw <HI>Savannah River,</HI> and sent off for a Pilot. O what Joy appear'd in every one's Countenance! How infinitely more
<PB N="44" REF="004453_0044_100D9EC0412D0A68"/>
joyful will the Children of GOD be, when hav∣ing pass'd thro' the Waves of this troublesome World, they arrive at the Haven of eternal Rest! <HI>Hasten, O</HI> LORD, <HI>that blessed Time, and let thy Kingdom come!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, May</HI> 7. Last Night, by the Blessing of GOD, we cast Anchor near <HI>Tibby Island,</HI> about 24 Miles off <HI>Savannah</HI>; and to-day GOD gave me Strength to preach my Fare∣wel Sermon; which I have not sent you, and at which many wept. After this I took Boat with my Friend <HI>H.</HI> and arriv'd safe at <HI>Savannah</HI> (having a most pleasant Passage) about seven in the Evening; and how GOD is pleased to deal with me, I will endeavour to inform you hereafter.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, fail not to give Thanks for all the Mercies I have received, tho' we had a long, yet it was an exceeding pleasant Passage. GOD in Compassion to my Weak∣ness has sent me but a few Trials, and sanctified those he hath sent me. I am now getting forth among Wolves; but he that protected <HI>Abram,</HI> when he went out, not knowing whither he went, will also guide and protect me; and therefore I can't close this Part of my Journal better, than with Mr. <HI>Addis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n's</HI> Translation of the 23d Psalm▪</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Journals already publish'd, were printed without my Knowledge, yet as GOD has been pleased to let me see, by Letters sent to me, that he has greatly blessed them, I now upon the Importunity of Friends, consent to the publishing a Continuation of them, that those pious Persons who have interceded in my behalf, may see what GOD, in ansver to their Prayers, has done for my Soul.</P>
<P>I am sensible that this, as well as every Thing else of such a Nature, must necessarily meet with great Contempt from natural Men, who are Strangers to the Influences of the HOLY GHOST upon the Heart. But what have I to do with them? If any of GOD's Children receive the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast Consolation from my Experiences, <HI>Let al∣most, formal Christians be offended, and the Scoffers of these last Days mock on. — I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A CONTINUATION OF Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s JOURNAL, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SUNDAY, <HI>May</HI> 7. Arrived at <HI>Savannah</HI> Town about seven this Evening, and joined in Prayer, and a Psalm of Thanksgiving with Mr. <HI>Delamotte,</HI> and some pious Souls that were rejoiced at my Arrival: <HI>The good</HI> LORD <HI>sanctify our meeting to his Glory, and his People's Welfare.</HI></P>
<P>Spent the remainder of the Evening in taking sweet Counsel with Mr. <HI>Delamotte,</HI> who seems providentially left behind at <HI>Savannah</HI> against my coming. How sweetly does Providence order Things for us! <HI>Oh may I constantly follow it as the wise Men did the Star in the East.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, May</HI> 8. Begun to read publi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rayers and expound the second Lesson at Fiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Morning to seventeen Adults and twenty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Children. <HI>May</HI> GOD <HI>open their Hearts, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may attend to the Things that were spoken.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="004453_0049_100D9ECE07A945F0"/>In the Afternoon Mr. <HI>Causton</HI> sent Word that he and the Magistrates would wait upon me, but I chose rather to wait upon them. I was re∣ceived with great Civility, and our chief Con∣versation ran upon the Place of my Settlement; at last it was resolved that I should have a House and Tabernacle built at <HI>Frederica,</HI> and serve at <HI>Savannah,</HI> when, and as long as I pleased. I find there are many Divisions amongst the In∣habitants, but GOD, I hope, will make me an Instrument of composing them: <HI>Grant this, O LORD, for thy dear Son's sake.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, May</HI> 14. After another Week's Confinement, by the Return of my Fever, un∣der which GOD shewed me great Mercies, and which went off with a Fit of the Ague, I attempted to read Prayers, but was so exceeding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aint and weak, that I was obliged to leave off before I began the second Service. <HI>Oh that my Friends had seen me at that Hour, they then might have learnt not to have any Man's Person in Ad∣miration, and not to think more highly of me than they ought to think.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, May</HI> 16. Having by the Blessing of GOD gotten a little Strength, I went to see <HI>To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Chachi,</HI> who, I heard, was near expiring at a Neighbour's House. He lay on a Blanket thin and meagre, and little else but Skin and Bones. <HI>Senauki</HI> sat by fanning him with some <HI>Indian Feathers.</HI> There was no Body that could talk <HI>English,</HI> so I could only shake Hands and leave him.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="004453_0050_100D9ED055660700"/><HI>Friday, May</HI> 19. GOD still strengthening me more and more, I went this Morning to two little Villages, <HI>Hampstead</HI> and <HI>Highgate,</HI> about Five Miles off <HI>Savannah</HI>: The former consists of three Families, making in all eleven Souls, one Man a <HI>Jew</HI>; two Men, one Woman and seven Children <HI>Swissers.</HI> I was much delighted with seeing the Improvements a few pair of Hands had made in their respective Plantations, and was surprized to see what Industry will do. Surely they speak not Truth, who say that the <HI>Georgia</HI> People have been idle; for I never saw more laborious People than are in these Villages. They live exceeding hard, but with a little Assistance may do very well. I was at a Loss, because I could not talk <HI>French,</HI> but however I resolved, under GOD, to follow my worthy Predecessor's Example, and to visit them once a Week, and read Prayers to as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ny as could understand me. I also enquired into the State of their Children, and found there were many who might prove useful Members of the Colony, if there was a proper Place provided for their Maintenance and Education. Nothing can effect this but an Orphan-House, which might easily be erected at <HI>Savannah,</HI> would some of those that are rich in this World's Good contribute towards it. <HI>May</HI> GOD, <HI>in his due Time, stir up the Wills of his faithful People to be ready to distribute, and willing to communicate on this commendable Occasion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, May</HI> 20. Went once more to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Chachi,</HI> hearing his Nephew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="52" REF="004453_0051_100D9ED1E27FFC48"/>
who was there, who could talk <HI>English.</HI> I desired of him to enquire of his Uncle, Whether he thought he should die; who answer'd, He could not tell: I then asked where he thought he should go after Death? He replied, to Heaven. <HI>But alas, how can a Drunkard enter there!</HI> I then exhorted <HI>Tooanoowee</HI> (who is a tall proper Youth) not to get drunk, telling him, he under∣stood <HI>English,</HI> and therefore would be punished the more if he did not live better. I then asked him, Whether he believed a Heaven? He an∣swer'd, <HI>Yes.</HI> I then asked, Whether he believed a Hell? and described it by pointing to the Fire, he replied, <HI>No.</HI> From whence we may easily gather how natural it is to all Mankind to believe there is a Place of Happiness, because they wish it may be so, and on the contrary, how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verse they are to believe a Place of Torment, because they wish it may not be so. But GOD is true and just, and as surely as the Good shall go into everlasting Happiness, so the Wicked shall go into everlasting Punishment.</P>

Went to Day to <HI>Thun∣derbolt,</HI> a Village about six Miles off <HI>Savannah,</HI> situated very pleasantly near the River, and consisting of three Families, four Men and two Women, and ten Servants; I was kindly recei∣ved, expounded a Chapter, used a few Collects, called on a Family or two that lay near our Way, and returned home to <HI>Savannah</HI> very comforta∣bly, with my Friend <HI>Delamotte,</HI> about six o'Clock in the Evening. <HI>Blessed be GOD for strengthen∣ing my weak <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ody.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="004453_0052_100D9ED461988278"/><HI>Friday, June</HI> 2. This Evening parted with kind Captain <HI>Whiting</HI> and my dear Friend <HI>Delamotte,</HI> who embarked for <HI>England</HI> about seven at Night. The poor People lamented the Loss of him, and went to the Water-side to take a last Farewel. And good Reason had they to do so: For he has been indefatigable in feeding CHRIST's Lambs with the sincere Milk of the Word, and many of them <HI>(Blessed be GOD)</HI> have grown thereby. Surely I must labour most heartily, since I come after such worthy Pre∣decessors. The Good that Mr. <HI>John Wesly</HI> has done in <HI>America,</HI> under GOD, is inexpressible▪ His Name is very precious among the People; and he has laid such a Foundation, that I hope neither Men nor Devils <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill ever be able to shake. <HI>Oh that I may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llow him, as he has Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, June</HI> 5. Had a Conference with a certain Person of the Parish, who, I heard last Night, had been broaching many heretical Doctrines to one of my Friends, particularly in denying the Eternity of Hell-Torments. I therefore invited him this Morning to Breakfast; and after imploring God's Assistance in the Spirit of Meekness, I asked him, <HI>Whether he believed the Eternity of Hell-Torments?</HI> He answer'd frankly, No. I replied, <HI>What do you mean, Sir, when you repeat the</HI> 12<HI>th Article of our Creed?</HI> He said, he believed wicked Men were to be annihilated. I then read <HI>Pearson's</HI> Exposition of the last Article, but he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> all▪ said he thought himself in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="54" REF="004453_0053_100D9ED638B447F8"/>
believed it his Duty to inform Mankind, that they were to be annihilated. Upon which I repeated to him that Passage out of the <HI>Reve∣lations. If any Man sball take away from or add unto Words that are written in this Book, GOD shall take away his Name out of the Book of Life, and add unto him all the Plagues that are written in this Book.</HI> This he said he believed. Afterwards we discoursed afresh, but finding him resolute to propagate his Principles, I then told him with the utmost Calmness that I was sorry that I gave him the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> at the Sacrament; but for the futu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> pardon me if I refused ever to give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. This stagger'd him a little, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it pretty patiently, yet thought me unc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>table. But I told him I should meet him at the Judgment-Seat of CHRIST, and then he would see upon what Principles I acted. <HI>May</HI> GOD <HI>give me Grace not to regard the Faces of Men, but with an humble well guided Zeal and Courage to watch the Flock over which the Holy Ghost has made me Overseer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, June</HI> 10. Placed one that came with me, at <HI>Highgate,</HI> to teach the Children <HI>English,</HI> that belong to that Village and <HI>Hamp∣stead.</HI> They are about Twenty in all, of <HI>French</HI> Extraction, but some few of them are able to speak a little in our vulgar Tongue. I thought placing a Master there would be of great Con∣sequence. <HI>First,</HI> Because I cannot think Chil∣dren will ever be naturaliz'd to the Colony, till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> talk our Language. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Because
<PB N="55" REF="004453_0054_100D9EDA64B42228"/>
the present Generation will soon wear off, and these Children being well instructed in ours, will make them forget their own Tongue▪ and should they marry and have Children, they would naturally teach their Children the same; so that at Length we shall all be of one Speech. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> As they are but few in Number, and no likelihood of any <HI>French</HI> Minister to come amongst them; I or my Successors shall be un∣able to catechise or bring them to hear the Word of GOD at our Church, unless they are acquainted with the <HI>English</HI> Tongue.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, June</HI> 11, Opened a School to Day for the Girls of <HI>Savannah,</HI> a Friend, whose Heart GOD was pleased to touch on Board the Ship, having at my Request undertaken to teach them. The Work is for my Master, and therefore I doubt not of being supplied some Way or another with a sufficient Fund for the Support of it. <HI>May GOD enable him who is set over them to feed them with the sincere Milk of the Word, and give them Grace to grow thereby?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, June</HI> 22. Was taken (as all about me thought for Death) with a violent Purging and Vomiting, which in the Space of five Hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e quite exhausted my Spirits, and brought me in Appearance, almost to the Point of Death. But God supported me by his inward Comforts, caused me to rejoice in it; and cast me into a deep Sleep, out of which I awoke perfectly well, to the Surprize of all about me. <HI>O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> can express the loving Kindness of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

or shew forth all his Praise!</HI> My Parishioners in general shewed they loved me; for they seem'd most sollicitous for my Welfare. For their Sake, as well as for my own, I hope GOD has so suddenly restored me. <HI>GOD grant I may now begin to be active in my Master's Service, that whensoever he shall call I may be found so doing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, June</HI> 24. To the great Surprise of myself and People, was enabled to read Prayers and preach with Power before the Free-Masons, with whom I afterwards dined, and was used with the utmost Civility. <HI>May</HI> GOD <HI>make them Servants of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>and then and not till then will they be free indeed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, July</HI> 7. Being the Anniversary for opening the Court, I preached in the Morning at the Magistrate's Request, and endeavoured with all Plainness and Humility to shew both them and the People, what they ought to do to promote their Temporal and Eternal Welfare. <HI>O GOD, do thou bless it, and it shall be blessed thro'</HI> JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, July</HI> 11. Returned this Evening from <HI>Ebenezer</HI> (whither I went Yesterday) the Place where the <HI>Salizburghers</HI> are settled; and was wonderfully pleased with their Order and Industry. Their Lands are improved surprisingly for the Time they have been there, and I believe they have far the best Crop of any in the Colony. — They are bless'd with two such pious Mini∣sters as I have not often seen; They have no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Judicature, but all little Differences
<PB N="57" REF="004453_0056_100D9EDE4CEB7308"/>
are immediately and implicitly decided by their Ministers, whom they look upon and love as their Fathers. They have likewise an Orphan-House, in which are seventeen Children, and one Widow, and I was much delighted to see the Regu∣larity wherewith it is managed. — <HI>O that GOD may stir up the Hearts of his Servants to contribute towards that and another which we hope to have erected at</HI> Savannah. — Mr. <HI>Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zius,</HI> one of their Ministers, being with me on <HI>Saturday,</HI> I gave him some of my Poor's Store for his Or∣phans, and when I came to <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> he call'd them all before him, catechised and exhorted them to give GOD Thanks for his good Provi∣dence towards them; then prayed with them, and made them pray after him; then sung a Psalm, and afterwards the little Lambs came and shook me by the Hand one by one, and so we parted, and I scarce was ever better pleased in my Life. — Surely whoever contributes to the Re∣lief of the <HI>Saltzburghers,</HI> will perform an ac∣ceptable Sacrifice to our Blessed Master. They are very poor; but with a little Assistance might live comfortably and well. They want a Place for Public Worship, and Money to buy Cattle and other Necessaries for the Orphan-House and People. <HI>May the great GOD raise up In∣struments to assist and relieve them; for surely they are worthy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, July</HI> 18. About Ten o' Clock this Evening returned to <HI>Savannah,</HI> having set out from thence Yesterday to visit four or five Fami∣lies that live at some of the outward Settlement,
<PB N="58" REF="004453_0057_100D9EDFE20D6070"/>
about twelve Miles off. — Their Beginnings as yet are but small, but I cannot help thinking there are Foundations laying for great temporal and spiritual Blessings in <HI>Georgia,</HI> when the In∣habitants are found worthy. — Blessed be GOD, in <HI>Savannah</HI> they will hear the Word gladly, and People every where receive me with the utmost Civility, and are not angry when I re∣prove them. — <HI>May GOD keep them always thus minded, and prepare me for whatever Suf∣ferings he shall permit to fall upon me for doing my Duty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, July</HI> 25. I am now waiting for the Scout-Boat which Mr. <HI>Horton</HI> has sent to take me to <HI>Frederica,</HI> to preach the Gospel there also. For therefore am I sent. — I should part with regret from the People of <HI>Savannah,</HI> did I not know GOD call'd me from them. For they seem to have a sincere Affection for me, and flock (especially every Evening) to hear the Word of GOD.— I have endeavoured to let my Gentle∣ness be known amongst them, because they con∣sist of different Nations and Opinions. — And I have strove to draw them by the Cords of Love, because the Obedience resulting from that Prin∣ciple I take to be most genuine and lasting. My ordinary Way of dividing my ministerial Labours has been as follows, —</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning at Five o' Clock, I publickly expound the second Lesson for the Morning or Evening Service as I see most suited to the People's Edification; at Ten I preach and read Prayers, at Three in the Aftern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on I do
<PB N="59" REF="004453_0058_100D9EE32E2AEC88"/>
the same, and at Seven expound Part of the Church Catechism, at which great Numbers are usually present. I visit from House to House▪ read publick Prayers and expound twice▪ and catechise (unless something extraordinary hap∣pens) visit the Sick every Day, and read to as many of my Parishioners as will come thrice a Week,— and blessed be GOD, my Labours have not been altogether vain in the <HI>LORD.</HI> For he has been pleased to set his Seal to my Ministry in a Manner, I could not, I dared not, in <HI>America</HI> expect. <HI>Not unto me, O</HI> LORD, <HI>not unto me, but unto thy Name be the Glory.</HI></P>

<HEAD>At <HI>FREDERICA.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Tuesday, August</HI> 8. After a pleasant Passage of five or six Days arrived at <HI>Frederica,</HI> a Town situated southwardly above an hundred Miles from <HI>Savannah,</HI> and consisting of about an hundred and twenty Inhabitants. The People received me most gladly, having had a Famine of the Word for a long Season. <HI>May</HI> GOD <HI>give a Blessing to my coming amongst them.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening we had public Prayers, and expounding of the second Lesson under a large Tree, and many more present than could be expected. <HI>Blessed be GOD.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, August</HI> 9. Began to Day visiting from House to House, and found the People in Appearance, desirous of being fed with the sin∣cere Milk of the Word, and sollicitous for my Continuance amongst them. Poor Creatures! my Heart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ached for them, because I saw the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="60" REF="004453_0059_100D9EE5B44A5E28"/>
and their Children scatter'd abroad as Sheep having no Shepherd. LORD <HI>in thy due Time send forth some Labourer, in this Part of thy Vineyard.</HI></P>
<P>This Evening had Prayers in a House which Mr. <HI>Horton</HI> hired for us during my Stay, and most of the Inhabitants, I believe, were present. Blessed be GOD, Timber is sawing for the erecting a more commodious Place for publick Worship, 'till a Church can be built. <HI>GOD grant we may always worship him in Spirit and in Truth, and then we may be assured that at all Times and in all Places he will hear us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, August</HI> 11. Went in the Morning to, and returned in the Evening from the <HI>Darien,</HI> a Settlement about twenty Miles off from <HI>Frederica,</HI> whither I went to see Mr. <HI>Macloud</HI> a worthy Minister of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Church, and GOD gave me a most pleasant Passage.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, August</HI> 12. This Afternoon was alarmed with the News of a Family Disaster. My dear Friend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.'s Brother going to find a Horse that was lost in the Woods, was lost himself, and many Guns shot after him for several Days, but in vain. I endeavoured to give Thanks to GOD for this and every Thing that befals me, because it is his Will, and resolved to set out for <HI>Savannah</HI> immediate∣ly, knowing what Concern my dear Friend <HI>H.</HI> must be in at so sudden a Loss. <HI>Blessed be God, for this and all Crosses. Father thy Will be done in, by, and upon me for Time and for Eternity.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening, because I was to go about Midnight, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave Notice I would preach as well
<PB N="61" REF="004453_0060_100D9EE846323650"/>
as expound, as which almost all the Inhabitants were present; for many were obliged to stand without the Door. The Lesson was very ap∣plicable to my Circumstances. It was the first of St. <HI>James,</HI> wherein the Apostle bids us <HI>rejoice when we fall into divers Temptations.</HI> GOD enabled me to enlarge on it pretty much. I told the People that GOD called me and I must away, at which some wept. <HI>Oh GOD how dost thou follow me with thy Blessings wherever thou sendest me! I looked for Persecution, but lo! I am received as an Angel of God. Not unto me, O</HI> LORD, <HI>not unto me, but unto thy Name be the Glory!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, August</HI> 13. Being disappointed of going by the Boat last Night, I read Prayers and preached to my dear little Flock twice, which caused great Joy among them. Mr. <HI>Horton</HI> was extreamly civil and did every Thing he could to oblige me. This Afternoon after Sermon in∣tended to go with him to preach to the Soldiers at the Fort of St. <HI>Simon</HI>'s, and then the next Day to go to St. <HI>Andrew's, but Lord thou callest me elsewhere. Oh grant I may have no Will of my own, but whenever or wherever thou shalt be pleased to call me, may I without the least Reluc∣tance say, lo I come!</HI> Had an Alarm brought to <HI>Frederica,</HI> that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had taken Pos∣session of <HI>Fort St. George,</HI> and fired at one of our Boats: But this was quickly found to be entirely groundless.</P>
<P>About Two in the Afternoon having first read Prayers, and preached, most of the Inhabitants
<PB N="62" REF="004453_0061_100D9EEA8F3FD6D0"/>
accompanied me to the <HI>Bluff,</HI> and took their Leaves of me in an affectionate Manner, and laded me with Things convenient for my Journey. <HI>The good Lord reward them ten thousand fold, and make me thankful for his unmerited Mercies!</HI></P>

<HEAD>At <HI>SAVANNAH.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Wednesday, August</HI> 16. Arrived this Day at <HI>Savannah,</HI> and had the Pleasure of meeting my Friend who had been lost, he was from <HI>Tuesday</HI> 'till <HI>Friday,</HI> roving about the Woods, during which Time the great Guns were fired according to Custom, and the People shewed what a great Respect they had for me and my Friends. Many of them going out all Day and Night after him. — Assoon as I had refreshed myself I went and visited my Parishioners from House to House to return them Thanks for their Kindness to my Friends. An unusual Joy appear'd in their Faces at my unexpected Return, and they were ready to say, <HI>How beautiful are the Feet of him that bringeth the glad Tidings of Salvation!</HI> At Evening Prayers (and a very large Congregation was present) I returned my dear Hearers hearty Thanks for the late Instance of their sincere Af∣fection, I publickly exhorted my Friend that was lost to shew forth his Thankfulness not only with his Lips but with his Life, and desired their Prayers to GOD for me that I might now more and more devote myself to my Blessed Master's Service, and study daily to purify my corrupt Nature, that I might be made an Instrument under him, of winning their Souls to GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="004453_0062_100D9EECEBA5EF58"/><HI>Wednesday, August</HI> 23. A Necessity was laid on me to Day to express my Resentment against Infidelity by refusing to read the Burial Office over the most professed Unbeliever I ever yet met with. — GOD was pleased to visit him with a lingring Illness, in which Time I went to see him frequently. — Particularly about five Weeks agone, I asked him what Religion he was of, he answered, "<HI>Religion was divided into so many Sects he knew not which to chuse.</HI>" — Another Time I offer'd to pray with him, but he would not accept it, upon which I resolv'd to go see him no more; — But being told two Days before he dyed, that he had an Inclination to see me, I went to him again, and after a little Conversation, I put to him the following Que∣stions. "<HI>Do you believe</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>to be GOD, the one Mediator between God and Man?</HI>" He said, "<HI>I believe</HI> Christ <HI>was a good Man.</HI>" — "<HI>Do you believe the Holy Scriptures?</HI>"
<Q>I believe, <HI>replied he,</HI> something of the Old Testa∣ment, the New I do not believe at all.</Q>
—
<Q>Do you believe, Sir, a Judgment to come?</Q>
He turn'd himself about and replied,
<Q>I know not what to say to that.</Q>
—
<Q>Alas, <HI>said I,</HI> Sir, if all these Things should be true.</Q>
— Which Words I believe, gave him Concern, for he seemed after to be very uneasy, grew delirious, and departed in a Day or two. — Unhappy Man, how quickly was he convinced that all I said was true. Now he and I are of one Mind. The Day after his Decease he was carried to the Ground, and I refused to read the Office over
<PB N="64" REF="004453_0063_100D9EEE8A816078"/>
him, but went to the Grave and told the People what had passed between him and me, warned them against Infidelity, and asked them whether I could safely say, "<HI>as our Hope is this our Brother doth,</HI>" upon which I believe they were thoroughly satisfied that I had done right. — <HI>GOD grant this may be a Warning to surviving Unbelievers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, Aug.</HI> 24. This Day went to <HI>Highgate</HI> with a Friend or two more, and read Prayers, preach'd and baptized a Child, and and catechised in a House lately erected by the Inhabitants. For upon my sending a Master to teach their Children, one offer'd to give me a part of his Lot, and the rest to give their La∣bour. Accordingly I accepted of it, found Ma∣terials, and to Day it was sit to preach in, and be made a School-House of. The Children tho' Foreigners answer'd admirably well, which gave me great Hopes that the other foreign Children of the Colony may also learn our <HI>English</HI> Tongue when a proper Master is provided.—After Ser∣vice we refreshed ourselves together, thanked our good GOD, and eat our Bread with Glad∣ness of Heart.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, August</HI> 27. GOD having now shewn both me and my Friends that it was his Will I should return for awhile to <HI>England</HI>: This Af∣ternoon I preached my Farewel Sermon, to the great Grief of my dear Parishioners, for their Hearts I found were very full as well as mine, which they expressed by shedding many Tears. But a sensible Alteration appear'd in their Coun∣tenances,
<PB N="65" REF="004453_0064_100D9EF0F47E6A60"/>
when I promised them solemnly be∣fore GOD to return as soon as possible. <HI>May GOD enable me to perform my Promise and pre∣pare my Way before me.</HI></P>
<P>The Weather was exceeding hot, and the Greatness of the Congregation made it still hot∣ter, but GOD enabled me to preach with Power. <HI>Thanks be to GOD for the Strength he gives me through JESUS CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday August</HI> 28. This being the Day of my Departure, it was mostly spent in taking Leave of my Flock, who expressed their Affec∣tion now more than ever. For they came to me from the Morning to the Time I left them with Tears in their Eyes, wishing me a pros∣perous Voyage and safe Return, and gave me other Tokens of their Love. For they brought me Wine, Ale, Cake, Coffee, Tea, and other Things proper for my Passage, and their Love seem'd without Dissimulation.</P>
<P>About Four in the Afternoon I went into the Boat provided for me by Mr. <HI>Causton,</HI> who with the Recorder came to my House and took their Leave. A great Number of People came to the <HI>Bluff</HI> and wish'd me a good Voyage with all their Souls, and a speedy Return; I thanked them, and having desired their Prayers, blessed them in the Name of GOD and took my Leave.</P>
<P>My Heart was full and I took the first Op∣portunity of venting it by Prayers and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ I think I never parted from a Place with more Regret; for <HI>America</HI> in my Opinion is an ex∣cellent School to learn CHRIST in; and I have
<PB N="66" REF="004453_0065_100D9EF2981177F0"/>
great Hopes some good will come out of <HI>Savan∣nah,</HI> because the longer I continued there, the larger the Congregations grew. And I scarce know a Night, though we had Divine Service twice a Day, when the Church-House has not been near full.— A Proof, this, I hope, that GOD has yet Spiritual and Temporal Blessings in store for them. <HI>Hasten, O LORD that blessed Time.</HI></P>

<HEAD>At <HI>CHARLES-TOWN.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Sunday, September</HI> 3. Arrived last Night here, and preached twice to Day, I hope with some good Effect. The Bishop of <HI>London</HI>'s Commis∣sary, the Rev. Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> a good Soldier of JESUS CHRIST, received me in a most Christian Manner. He and several others offered me a Lodging, and were more than civil to me. <HI>How does GOD raise me up Friends wherever I go! Who is so good a</HI> GOD <HI>as our</HI> GOD?</P>
<P>Was much pleased with the Neatness of the Buildings, and the Largeness of the Place. The Church is very beautiful, and the Inhabitants seem to be excellently well settled. <HI>GOD's Judgments have been late abroad amongst them by the Spreading of the</HI> Small-Pox, <HI>I hope they will learn Righteousness!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, September</HI> 4. Was much delighted with a Packet of Letters I received from <HI>Savannah,</HI> not only as they were a Proof of the Writer's Affection for me, but also that the Holy Ghost was effectually moving on their Souls.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="004453_0066_100D9EF6B6426D38"/><HI>Saturday, Sept.</HI> 9. Received another com∣fortable Packet of Letters from <HI>Savannah</HI> Friends, and was soon hurried on Board, the Wind being fair for sailing.

<P><HI>Saturday, Sept.</HI> 9. About Noon came on Board with great Composure of Mind, and thought of my absent Friends, settled my Things, wrote my Journal, and finished some other Matters. The Wind being fair, weighed Anchor, and set sail about five in the Evening. <HI>The LORD send us a prosperous Voyage, and bring us in his appointed Time to the Haven where we would be!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Sept.</HI> 16. Had contrary Winds all the Week, and got but a few Leagues from <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> yet GOD shewed me great Mercies: For he enabled me to write several Things, and correct others. I have been but a little Sea-sick; and though I have not had my Cloaths off, and lay upon Deck or on a Chest every Night, yet the Goodness of GOD keeps me healthy and strong, and gives me a feeling Possession of his Holy Spirit. My Sphere of Action is now contracted into a narrow Compass. There are but few Souls on Board, and all that
<PB N="68" REF="004453_0067_100D9EF91B9DBB90"/>
I can do is to read public Prayers, and add a Word of Exhortation twice every Day, and catechise those I brought with me. The Cap∣tain and all are very civil, my Christian Friends have been much upon my Heart, and caused me some Dejections, but GOD was my Comforter.</P>
<P>Had I my own Will, I could wish myself a speedy Passage, that I may return the sooner to those few Sheep I have left at <HI>Savannah</HI>; but GOD knows best, and this Retirement, I hope will break my Will, purify my Heart, and fit me for the great Work that lies before me. <HI>Even so Lord</HI> JESUS, <HI>Amen,</HI> and <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Sept.</HI> 23. Still GOD is pleased to send us contrary Winds, except one Night about the Middle of the Week.— However he enables me to give Thanks — and great Reason have I so to do. — <HI>For the Holy Spirit has been with me of a Truth!</HI></P>
<P>I have observed, that before GOD calls me to a public Work, he always sends me into some Retirement, but never to so great a one as now. — A Sign this, I hope, that a greater Work is yet behind. <HI>Lord fit and prepare me for it.</HI></P>
<P>My Mind, blessed be GOD, has been com∣posed and easy. Only the Absence of my Friends, now and then struck a Damp upon my Spirits. — But the Friend of all is with and in me, and he by his Spirit I trust, will supply the Want of their dear Company. — <HI>Amen, Lord</HI> JESUS, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday,</HI> 24. <HI>Monday, Sept.</HI> 25. Was oppressed much in Spirit these two Days. The Wind was
<PB N="69" REF="004453_0068_100D9EFB58174838"/>
contrary, and the Sea wrought and was tempes∣tuous; but blessed be GOD, he enabled me to be resigned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his Will, this outward and inward Trial being only what was to be expected after my late Assistances. <HI>We must not always be upon the Mount in this Life.</HI></P>
<P>Ever since <HI>Monday</HI> Evening, GOD has been pleased to send us fair Winds, particularly to Day, when our Ship has sail'd seven Miles an Hour, <HI>Blessed be GOD.</HI></P>
<P>I have been chiefly busied about writing Let∣ters, to engage more Labourers, and to ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Contributions for my poor Flock.</P>
<P>Blessed be GOD! he has made me frequently rejoice in Spirit, and now quite reconciles me to my present Retirement. <HI>When shall I have no Will but</HI> GOD<HI>'s!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Octob.</HI> 1. Had very little sleep all Night, and was like to fall off the Chest where∣on I lay several Times, the Sea being very rough, and the Wind-turning in an Instant directly con∣trary. <HI>Oh that I could learn from Winds and Storms to obey my Master!</HI></P>
<P>Buried a young Man that came from <HI>Georgia,</HI> and died this Morning. LORD, What is Man? He solaced himself with the Thoughts of seeing his Friends in <HI>England.</HI> But GOD saw fit to prevent it by shortning his Days. <HI>LORD, thy Judgments are like the great Deep!</HI></P>
<P>When I buried him, I could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> say much, because of the rowling of the Ship▪ but at E∣vening-Prayer I took occasion fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Lesson which providentially was the 15th <HI>Chap.</HI> of
<PB N="70" REF="004453_0069_100D9EFE8EF062F8"/>
the first of <HI>Corinthians</HI>) to exhort all my Ship∣mates to consider so, as to prepare for their lat∣ter End. I believe my Words came with Power. <HI>GOD grant they may have a due Effect. Amen, LORD JESUS, Amen!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, Octob.</HI> 6. Before I left <HI>Savannah,</HI> the Lesson appointed for the Morning, was St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Shipwreck, out of the <HI>Acts,</HI> and before I left <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> the Lesson was the first of <HI>Jonah,</HI> both which made such a deep Impression upon me, that I wrote to my Friend <HI>Habersham,</HI> to acquaint him I was apprehensive we should have a dangerous Voyage: Since I have been on Board, what St. <HI>Paul</HI> said to his Companions,
<Q>That he perceived their Voyage would be to their great Damage,</Q>
has frequently been press'd upon my Heart; and GOD has now shewn me wherefore he gave me these previous Notices.—For on <HI>Tuesday</HI> Night last, after we had sailed 150 Miles, the last twenty-four Hours, about Eleven o'Clock arose a sudden violent <HI>East</HI> Wind, which continued till about Four in the Morning, and put all the Sailors to their Wits End.— Most of them declared they never had seen the like before. The main Sail was slit in several Pieces, and several of the other Sails, and much of the Tackling all to Tatters; not a dry Place was to be found in all the Ship: The Captain's Hammock, in the great Cabin, was half filled with Water; and though I lay in the most dry Part of the Ship, yet the Waves broke in upon me twice or thrice. In short, all was Terror and Confusion, Men's Hearts failing
<PB N="71" REF="004453_0070_100D9F0194FC8F00"/>
them for fear, and the Wind and the Sea ra∣ging most horribly. But GOD (<HI>for ever be a∣dored his unmerited Goodness</HI>) was exceeding gra∣cious unto me. For I felt a sweet Complacen∣cy in my Will, in Submission to his. Many particular Promises GOD has made me from his Word, that I should return in Peace, flowed in upon my Heart. And he enabled me greatly to rejoice.—This is the first Day we have ven∣tured to pull down any of our dead Lights, which put me in Mind of the long Night the <HI>Egyptians</HI> once saw. But I spent my Time in reading, and fervent Intercession for absent Friends, and com∣forted myself much with the Remembrance of them; most of fresh Provisions are washed over Board, and our Tackling much out of order, so that we have a Prospect but of an indifferent Voyage. But blessed be GOD, the Prospect pleases me. For now I shall learn, I trust, how to want as well as how to abound, and how to endure Hardship like a good Soldier of JESUS CHRIST. <HI>O LORD let thy Strength be magni∣fied in my Weakness, say unto my Soul,</HI>
<Q>It is I, be not afraid, and then let Storms and Tem∣pests do their worst.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Octob.</HI> 7. This has been a Week, blessed be GOD, though not of much Action, yet full of Opportunities of exercising my pas∣sive Graces! To Day, adored be the Divine Goodness, the Weather has cleared up more and more, and our Ship has sailed directly be∣fore the Wind, at the Rate of four or five Miles an Hour.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="004453_0071_100D9F03255F7D58"/>A Desire to see my Friends in <HI>England,</HI> to dispatch my Business, and to return to my poor Flock, prompt me secretly to wish for a Conti∣nuance of this prosperous Gale. <HI>But LORD I know not what to pray for as I ought. Do with me as seemeth good in thy Sight. Only I beseech thee to sanctify my present Retirement; that the longer I am upon the Sea, the more zealous I may be in thy Service, when I come upon dry Land.</HI></P>
<P>Saw a <HI>Jamaica</HI> Ship▪ Captain <HI>Philips,</HI> who has been out nine Weeks. <HI>What Reason have we to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>!</HI></P>
<P>Having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pportunity before, since the Storm, of getting many of our People together, gave a Word or two of Exhortation to my Ship-Mates, to bless GOD for our late Deliverance, and to sin no more lest a worse Storm should befal us.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, October</HI> 14. Sailed this Week about 600 Miles; but Yesterday GOD was pleased to send us a contrary Wind, which still continues. <HI>Father, thy Will be done.</HI></P>
<P>A few Days agone I flatter'd myself we should be soon at our desired Port, but GOD is pleased to defer the Accomplishment of my Hopes: However, <HI>blessed be his Name, He enables me to give Thanks.</HI></P>
<P>Most of this Week has been spent in search∣ing the Scriptures; and particular Retirements for Direction and Assistance in the Work before me. — GOD has been pleased to send me many inward Trials. And now my fresh Provisions are gone, and the People are put to the Allow∣ance
<PB N="73" REF="004453_0072_100D9F050DC2A8C8"/>
of a Quart of Water each Man for a Day▪ So that I hope now the spiritual Man will grow, having so little for the natural Man to feed on. <HI>Amen, Lord</HI> JESUS. — Blessed be GOD, I can by his Grace say that I rejoice in Necessities, and do in every Thing give Thanks. <HI>Keep me thus minded, O Dear Redeemer, till thou perfect thy Work in my Soul.</HI></P>
<P>Had this Sentence out of <HI>Henry</HI> much pressed upon my Heart to comfort me in my Retirement. — <HI>The Mower looses no Time whilst he is whet∣ting his Scythe.</HI> — Thus shall all <HI>Christians</HI> be taught of GOD.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, October</HI> 15. The Weather being calm, and I being kindly invited Yesterday, went on board the <HI>Constant,</HI> Capt. <HI>Philips,</HI> bound from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> who now sails in Company with us, and was kindly received both by the Captain and his Passengers, and not only so, but they spared me what they could of their Provisions▪ A most providential Supply; for ours was quite out. But our Extremity is GOD's Opportunity. <HI>Blessed be his Name for thus strengthning our Faith. May this be looked upon as a Pledge that He will never leave or forsake us.</HI></P>
<P>Our chief Discourse was about <HI>Georgia</HI>; and staying a little longer than was thought, my Shipmates were very suspicious I should be de∣tain'd on board. But tho' there was Provision for the Flesh, yet I like my own Situation best, because here are greater Opportunities of denying myself, and consequently of making farther Im∣provement in the Spirit. <HI>O that I may always walk by this Rule!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="004453_0073_100D9F08FAA0E558"/><HI>Saturday, October</HI> 21. Made but slow Ad∣vances in our Voyage, having had but one or two Days of fair Wind. But notwithstanding, I believe we shall now soon reach Shore; for GOD has been pleased to visit me all the Week with variety of inward Trials, which is a Sign to me that I shall experience yet more and more of his Mercies. <HI>How good is</HI> GOD <HI>thus to pre∣pare me by Sufferings, that so his Blessings may be my Ruin; these Things to the natural Man ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not joyous, but grievous, but GOD enables me to take Comfort only in him, to thank him sincerely for his loving Correction, and therefore when I am sufficiently exercised thereby, I hope it will bring forth in me the peaceable Fruits of Righteousness.</HI> Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, October</HI> 22. At the Desire of the Captain preached my Sermon on rash Anger, having hitherto used to expound only. In the Lesson were these remarkable Words, <HI>Return to thy own House, and shew how great Things God has done unto thee.</HI> And again, <HI>It came to pass that when Jesus was returned, the People gladly received him, for they were all waiting for him.</HI> These last Words were remarkably pressed upon me at <HI>Savannah,</HI> when I was consulting GOD by Prayer, whether it was his Will that I should go to <HI>England. Thus</HI> GOD<HI>'s Word is in particular Cases as well as in general, a Light unto our Feet and a Lanthorn unto our Paths.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, October</HI> 25. Was much comforted this Evening, in reading the 33d and 34th Chapters of <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> wherein I could not but
<PB N="75" REF="004453_0074_100D9F0A94139278"/>
observe many Circumstances of GOD's dealing with him corresponding with what I have ex∣perienced in myself: The following Verses in particular were set home to my Heart, — <HI>Also thou Son of Man, the Children of thy People are still talking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by the Wall and in the Doors of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> saying, Come I pray <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> what Word cometh from the LORD. — And they came unto thee as the People cometh, and they hear thy Words, but they will not do them, for with their Mouth they shew much Love, but their Heart goeth after Covetous∣ness. And lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely Song of one that hath a pleasant Voice, and can play well on an Instru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent: for they hear thy Words but do them not.</HI> — Who that knows how GOD has dealt with me since I have been in the Ministry, sees not that this Passage answers to my Circumstances, as Face answers to Face in the Water? However this I know, what I have spoken from GOD will come to pass (lo it will come) and then shall these Scoffers and Despisers know, that a Minister of CHRIST has been amongst them. <HI>O that I may never be brought forth as a swift Witness against any; but we must all appear before the Judgment Seat of CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, October</HI> 28. Sailed about 300 Miles the four first Days of this Week: Had a little Storm on <HI>Wednesday</HI> Night, and a great Calm ever since. We are now within 150 Leagues of Land, and our Provisions and Water very scanty, and our Ship very weak;
<PB N="76" REF="004453_0075_100D9F0CC1E67EF8"/>
but the Hour of our Arrival is not yet come. <HI>Lord, teach me to be resigned and thankful, and then deal with me as seemeth good in thy Sight.</HI></P>
<P>Blessed be GOD! he has this Week enlarged my Heart, and filled me with great Comfort, after great inward Conflicts. Is not all this to prepare me for further Trials we are yet to endure e'er we get to <HI>England?</HI> LORD, <HI>thy Grace I know will be sufficient for me, and there∣fore I rejoice in the Prospect of enduring Tribulation.</HI></P>
<P>Had Reason to believe one on board was offended at my enlarging one Night on the Sin of <HI>Drunkenness.</HI> — I always endeavour to speak with the Meekness and Gentleness of CHRIST. — But if People will account me their Enemy, because out of Love, I tell them the Truth, I cannot help that. <HI>Lo I have delivered my Soul.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, October</HI> 30. Still GOD is pleased <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Wind, what there is of it, should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>trary, and our Ship's Company are now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rought into great Streights. Their Allowance of Water is a Quart a Day, and our constant Food for some Time has been on Salt Beef and Water Dumplins, which do not agree with the Stomachs of some amongst us. But GOD enables me to rejoice in that and all other our Necessities, yea, He so comforts me that many I believe are surprised at my Chearfulness. But when we are destitute of outward Comforts, then does GOD more comfort our Souls. This Morning when I awoke, the Faith of <HI>Abraham</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="004453_0076_100D9F0E6B625E78"/>
was greatly pressed upon me; and the Example of <HI>Daniel</HI> and the three Children, who were fat and well favoured, notwithstanding they were fed with Pulse and Pease, is continually before my Eyes. Some say we are within a hundred Leagues of Land. But what does that signify, if GOD says, <HI>Hitherto shall you go, and no further. LORD, in thy due Time let that which now letteth be taken away, but not before this Trial has done what it was sent for, tho' it make us smart.</HI></P>
<P>I warm myself by smiling on, and exhorting them, and this Afternoon we joined in solemn Prayers suitable to our present Circumstances. <HI>LORD, let our Cry come unto thee.</HI> I know it will, and that we shall be answer'd, if it be best. But great Blessings await me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Shore, and great Trials must precede. <HI>Oh that I may by these small, be prepar'd for greater Suffering<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ Amen, Lord</HI> JESUS.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, October</HI> 30. Was comforted to Night in my present Circumstances, by these Verses out of this Evening's Lesson, — <HI>I have learnt in whatsoever State I am, therewith to be content. I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound; every where, and in all Things I am instructed, both to the full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer Need. I can do all thro'</HI> Christ <HI>which strengthneth me. Even so come, Lord JESUS.</HI> Amen <HI>and</HI> Amen.</P>
<P>Reading afterwards in the Book of <HI>Maccabees,</HI> and thinking of my present Situation, this Verse was pressed with unspeakable Comfort upon my
<PB N="78" REF="004453_0077_100D9F102978B300"/>
Soul,— <HI>After this they went Home, and sung a Song of Thanksgiving, and praised the</HI> LORD <HI>in Heaven; because it is good, because his Mercy endureth forever.</HI> I hope my Friends will take care to fulfil this when we meet together on Shore.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, November</HI> 1. This Afternoon, about four o'Clock, as I was in Secret, humbling my Soul before GOD, interceding for my Friends, and had been praying for a fair Wind, and Assistance in the great Work lying before me, News were brought that the Wind was fair; which put me in Mind of the Angel's being sent to <HI>Daniel,</HI> to tell him his Prayer was heard, when he was humbling his Soul with Fasting, and praying for the Peace and Resto∣ration of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> Indeed I cannot say I have purposely, for these three Weeks, eat no pleasant Food, or fasted, as he did; but our Food is so salt, that I dare eat but little, so that I am now literally in Fastings often. <HI>O that I may improve this blessed Season for Humiliation and extraordinary Acts of Devotion, that I may be duly prepar'd to approve myself a faithful Minister of JESUS CHRIST, whether by Honour or Dishonour, by evil Report or good Report.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as we found the Wind fair, we join'd in Thanksgiving, and in singing the first Part of the 34th <HI>Psalm</HI> (new Version) which was very applicable to our Circumstances. For they tell me they have not above three Days Water on Board, allowing a Quart to each Man a Day. But he, that at one Time, at the Request of his
<PB N="79" REF="004453_0078_100D9F14D5DEF408"/>
Disciples, consider'd the Multitude, and work'd a Miracle for their Relief; and at another Time, at the Intercession of <HI>Moses,</HI> gave Water to the wandring <HI>Israelites,</HI> I trust, now, has heard our Prayers, and sent this Wind with a Commission to bring us where he will supply all our Wants. <HI>If not, O Blessed</HI> JESU, <HI>thy Will be done. Give me Grace, I most humbly beseech thee, to hold out my three Watches, and at the fourth Watch I know thou wilt come. Even so come Lord</HI> JESUS.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday, Nov.</HI> 4. For these two Days last past, GOD has been pleased greatly to humble my Soul, and bring me low by Spiritual Deser∣tions. And to Day he has thought proper again to send us a contrary Wind, blessed be his Name. Our Allowance of Water now is but a Pint a Day; so that we dare not eat much Beef. Our Sails are exceeding thin; some more of them were split last Night, and no one knows where we are; but GOD does, and that is sufficient.</P>
<P>Last Night He lifted up the Light of his blessed Countenance upon me, and to Day fills me with Joy unspeakable, and full of Glory; so that though I have little to eat, yet I inwardly possess all Things. I am sometime afraid lest continued Abstinence may occasion a bodily Sickness. But wherefore do I fear? If it does, that and every Thing else I know will work for my Good. — What I most dread, is lest any on Board should charge GOD foolishly; but I check the first Motions I discern arising in any one's Heart, and endeavour to justify our good
<PB N="80" REF="004453_0079_100D9F16690A31F0"/>
GOD, in all the Evil that he hath brought upon us. I put before them the Example of the Widow of <HI>Sarepta,</HI> and caution them against murmuring like the <HI>Israelites</HI> at the Waters of <HI>Meribah, And thus I endeavour to comfort and support them with the Comforts wherewith I myself am comforted of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>This is now the eighth Week I have been Aboard. If my Friends ask me, why I arrived no sooner, I may truly answer, <HI>Satan</HI> hinder'd us. For I believe it is he who is permitted to do this; but this still gives me greater Hopes, that a more effectual Door than ever, will be be open'd in <HI>England,</HI> for preaching the ever∣lasting Gospel. <HI>O Satan, Satan, I defy thee to do thy worst; thou mayst toss me up and down, and bring me into Jeopardy on every Side; but JESUS CHRIST is praying for me on the Mount. And when the Time appointed by the Father is come, and my Soul hereby prepared, he whom Winds and Storms obey, will speak the Word; and then I shall have a happy meeting with my dear Friends!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Nov.</HI> 5. This Day we rejoiced with trembling. For though we thereon commemo∣rated our Deliverance from the <HI>Gunpowder-Plot,</HI> yet as our Circumstances call'd for Acts of Hu∣miliation, I used Part of the Office of Commina∣tion, (besides solemn Prayer and Psalms three Times) and enlarged on these Words of St. <HI>James,</HI>
<Q>My Brethren, count it all Joy, when ye fall into diverse Temptations; knowing this, that the trying of your Faith worketh
<PB N="81" REF="004453_0080_100D9F18DC699AF8"/>
Patience: But let Patience have her perfect Work.</Q>
I hope this had a good Effect upon my Hearers Hearts, and calm'd their Spirits. For indeed we are brought very low: But I can say with the penitent Thief,
<Q>That I suffer justly, and do not receive the ten thousandth Part of the Reward due to my Crimes.</Q>
<HI>LORD, remember me now thou art in thy King∣dom!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, Nov.</HI> 6. Last Night, about seven o'Clock, GOD was pleased to suffer a violent Wind to arise, which would not permit me to rise till this Afternoon, about which Time it be∣gan in some measure to abate. Blessed be GOD through the Precaution used by our Ship-Mates, we ship'd but little Water, only we were driven some Leagues back. The Weather was pretty cold, and a little Cake or two baked on the Coals, and a very little Salt-Beef was all my Provision for the Day; but thus <HI>Elijah</HI> lived for a long while, and why not I? Nay, he fasted forty Days and forty Nights. And though I dare not presume to do so, yet if GOD still brings me into greater Wants, I doubt not, but I shall find that Man liveth not by Bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of GOD. <HI>LORD, I desire not to be exempted from sufferings, but to be supported under them. If thy Glory can be promoted by my Tryals, lo, here I am, scourge me, try me as it seemeth good in thy Sight!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, November</HI> 8. Perceived my self Yesterday and this Morning, inwardly weak and fainting, and unable to read scarce any
<PB N="82" REF="004453_0081_100D9F1C63323930"/>
Thing. <HI>But blessed be GOD! though he kill me, yet will I put my Trust in him.</HI></P>
<P>When my Spirits are gone, I then find my Faith, as it were, less lively; But I trust that is only owing to the Frame of my Body. For at all other Times I have great Confidence in God! And was he now to put it to my Choice, whether this Trial should continue, or he should send us a fair Wind, I should humbly refer it to him again. <HI>For I know not what is best for me!</HI></P>
<P>Most in the great Cabin now begin to be weak and look hollow-Ey'd, yet a little while, and we shall come to Extremities; and then God's Arm will bring us Salvation. <HI>May we patiently tarry the LORD's Leisure!</HI> Amen, Amen.</P>
<P>Great Part of this Day I lay down, being weak and much oppressed in my Head; but at Night when some doubted what the End of this Visitation would be, the following Verses were with great Comfort pressed upon my Soul.
<Q>For I am in a strait between two, having a Desire to be dissolved and to be with CHRIST, which is far better. Nevertheless to abide in the Flesh is more needful for you. And having this Confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all, for your fur∣therance and joy of Faith: That your rejoic∣ing may be more abundant in JESUS CHRIST for me, by my coming to y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u again.</Q>
<HI>Thus Christians have Meat to eat, which the World knoweth not.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="004453_0082_100D9F1E8A509830"/>In confidence of this, and such like Texts, that have been from time to time applied to my Soul, I still (as often as my Strength will per∣mit) contine to write Letters ready to send when I come on Shore. Which reminds me of <HI>Jere∣miah</HI>'s being commanded to buy Land, when his whole Country was about to be carried into Captivity. <HI>Blessed are they that walk by Faith, and not by Sight.</HI></P>
<P>Though one in his haste the other Day cried out, "What <HI>Jonah</HI> have we here on Board?" And I answer'd, I am he; yet many now, I be∣lieve, bless GOD, that I am with them. For, say they,
<Q>How should we have been blaming and cursing one another, had not Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> been amongst us?</Q>
<HI>Blessed be GOD, if my Ministry or Presence can be instrumental to preven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sin against thee, O LORD, toss me on the Ocean as long as it pleaseth thee! O my dear LORD, I desire to be resigned!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, Nov.</HI> 9, Enjoyed great Peace of Mind to Day, and was stronger in Body than usual. <HI>Blessed be the LORD!</HI> We are now making for <HI>Ireland,</HI> and are advanced some Leagues towards it. Whether we shall arrive there or not, GOD only knows. I find all un∣easiness arises from having a Will of my own. And therefore I simply desire to will what GOD willeth. <HI>Oh, when will this once be?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, Nov.</HI> 10. Was much strengthened in our present Distress by the second Lesson for the Day. It was our Saviour's turning the Wa∣ter into Wine at the Marriage of <HI>Cana.</HI> We
<PB N="84" REF="004453_0083_100D9F201B5C2A68"/>
have applied to him as the Holy Virgin did and told him in Prayer, that,
<Q>we have but very little Water?</Q>
At present he seems to turn away his Face, and to say,
<Q>What have I to do with you?</Q> But this is only because the the Hour of Extremity is not yet come. When it is, I doubt not but he will now as richly sup∣ply our Wants, as he did theirs then. <HI>May we in Patience possess our Souls!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Nov.</HI> 11. Still we are floating a∣bout, not knowing where we are. But our People seem yet to have hopes of seeing <HI>Ireland.</HI> I know not whether I am out in my Conjecture, but I imagine some of those Ships we have seen, are arrived at <HI>England</HI> before us. Upon which, perhaps, my Friends will expect me, pray for me, and at last give me up for lost. <HI>And then GOD will restore me to them.</HI></P>
<P>The Weather now begins to be cold, so that I can say with the Apostle. <HI>I am in Hung∣rings and Thirstings, Cold and Fastings often.</HI> Hereafter, perhaps, I may add <HI>moreover in Bonds and Imprisonments.</HI> But I trust the Sufferings of this Life will not move me. <HI>For they are not worthy to be compared with the Glory that shall be revealed in us.</HI></P>
<P>My outward Man sensibly decayeth, but the Spiritual Man I trust, is renewed Day by Day. I have besought the LORD many times to send us a fair Wind: But now I see he does not think fit to answer me, I am wholly resigned, knowing that his Grace will be sufficient for me, and that his Time is best.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="004453_0084_100D9F224DB867C8"/>Our Ship is much out of repair, and our Food by no means, enough to support Nature in an ordinary Way, and that of the most indifferent Kind too: An Ounce or two of Salt-Beef, a Pint of Water, and a Cake made of Flower and Skimmings of the Pot. But I think often on him who preserved <HI>Moses</HI> in the Ark of <HI>Bul∣rushes.</HI> And so long as I look upwards my Faith will not fail.</P>
<P>Blessed be Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for these Things, I rejoice in them daily. They are no more than I expected, and I know they are Preparatives for future Mercies. <HI>GOD of his infinite Mercy humble and try me, till I am rightly disposed to receive them. Amen, LORD JESUS, Amen.</HI></P>
<P>It pities me often to see my Brethren, lying in the Dust, as they have done these many Weeks, and exposed to such Streights: For GOD knows both their Souls and Bodies are dear unto me. But thanks be to GOD, they bear up well, and I hope we shall all now learn to endure Hardships, like good Soldiers of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Nov.</HI> 12. This Morning the Doc∣tor of our Ship took up the <HI>Common-Prayer Book,</HI> and observed that he opened upon these Words, <HI>Blessed be the LORD GOD of</HI> Israel, <HI>for he hath visited and redeemed his People.</HI> And so indeed he has, for about 8 o'Clock this Morn∣ing News were brought, that our Men saw Land, and I went and was a joyful Spectator of it myself. The Air was clear, and the Sun a∣rising in full Strength, so that 'tis the most pleasant Day I have seen these many Weeks.

<HI>Now know I that the LORD will not always be chiding, neither keepeth he his Anger forever.</HI> For these two or three Days last past, I have enjoyed an uncommon Serenity of Soul, and given up my Will to GOD. And now he hath brought us Deliverance. —From whence I infer, that a Calmness of Mind, and entire Resignation to the Divine Will, is the best Preparative for receiving Divine Mercies. <HI>LORD evermore make me thus minded!</HI></P>
<P>As soon as I had taken a View of the Land, we joined together in a Prayer and Psalm of Thanksgiving, and already began to reflect with Pleasure on our late Streights. Thus it will be hereafter, the Storms and Tempests of this troublesome World will serve to render our Haven of eternal Rest doubly agreeable. — I fear now nothing so much as the Treachery of my Heart, lest like the ungrateful Lepers, I should not turn to GOD and give Thanks by leading a Holy Life. <HI>But all Things are possible with GOD, on whose rich Mercies and free Grace in</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>I alone depend for Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and Re∣demption.</HI></P>
<P>Spent a good Part of this Afternoon in walk∣ing upon Deck, and blessing GOD for the Pros∣pect I saw all around me. His good Providence has been pleased to bring us into a fine large Bay, surrounded on each Side with high Lands and Hommocks, much like those near <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and a large Light-House on the Fore-Land, from which in the Evening was shewn a Light.
<PB N="87" REF="004453_0086_100D9F274EE06538"/>
It lies on the North-West of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and most suppose we are near <HI>Limerick,</HI> but are not certain, only one of our Men having been here before. There are no Soundings till you come very near the Land. The Wind being against us (that little that was of it) we could not get much forward: <HI>But GOD in his due Time will bring us on Shore.</HI> Blessed be his Name, the Weather is exceeding clear, and this is the most comfor∣table Day I have seen a long Time. <HI>LORD make me mindful of these thy Mercies all the Days of my Life!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, Nov.</HI> 14. Let this Day, my Soul, be noted in thy Book, for GOD has visited thee with his Salvation, — On <HI>Monday</HI> midnight, as I was lying on my Bed, my Sleep departed from me, and I had no rest in my Spirit, be∣cause although the Weather was so exceeding calm, and we in so great Distress, yet no Boat was sent to fetch us Provisions. Upon this I spoke to the Captain, and he to the Mate, who in the Morning went with a Boat, and about Noon this Day returned loaded with Provisions and Water, and not only so, but told us, he was kindly intreated, by the People he met with, especially by a great Country Gentleman, who came from his Seat at Midnight, on purpose to relieve him and his Companions; furnished them with a fresh Boat and other Necessaries, most kindly invited me, though unknown, to his House, to stay as long as I pleased; and has order'd Horses to wait ready to take me thither.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="004453_0087_100D9F29ACAA3828"/>Who is so great, so good a GOD, as our GOD! Our Hour of Extremity was indeed come: For we had but half a Pint of Water left, and my Stomach was exceeding weak, through my long Abstinence; but now his Almighty Arm hath brought us Salvation.</P>
<LG>
<L>Thro' all the changing Scenes of Life,</L>
<L>In Trouble and in Joy,</L>
<L>The Praises of my GOD shall still</L>
<L>My Heart and Tongue employ,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of his Deliverance I will boast,</L>
<L>Till all that are distrest;</L>
<L>From my Example Comfort take</L>
<L>And charm their Griefs to rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fear him, ye Saints, and you will then</L>
<L>Have nothing else to fear;</L>
<L>Make you his Service your Delight,</L>
<L>Your Wants shall be his Care.</L>
</LG>
<P>As soon as the Provisions came, we kneeled down and returned hearty Thanks to our good GOD who has heard our Prayers, and sent his Angel before us, to prepare our Way.</P>
<L>Therefore my Life's remaining Years,</L>
<L>Which GOD to me shall lend,</L>
<L>Will I in Praises to his Name,</L>
<L>And in his Service spend.</L>
<P>A little before our Provision came, I had been noting in my Diary, that I believed Deliverance was at Hand; for last Night and this Morning, I had the most violent Conflict within my self that I have had at all. Thus GOD always prepares me for his Mercies. <HI>O that this may
<PB N="89" REF="004453_0088_100D9F2C15B77E78"/>
strengthen my Faith, and make me willing to follow the Lamb wheresoever he shall be pleased to lead me. Amen, Lord</HI> JESUS, <HI>Amen!</HI></P>
<P>Still greater Mercies GOD confers on his unworthy Servant. For after our Provisions were brought aboard, the Wind still continued fair, and by six at Night blew us to a little Place on <HI>Karrigholt</HI> Island, before which we cast Anchor. <HI>Praise the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me praise his holy Name!</HI></P>
<P>Ever since we have been on Board the <HI>Mary,</HI> these Words, "Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain Island" (which were Part of the Lesson I read last at <HI>Savannah</HI>) have been continually press'd upon my Heart, so that I have ofte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mention'd it to one of my Companions. Behold they are now fulfilled. <HI>O how un∣searchable are thy Doings, O LORD, and thy Ways past finding out</HI>▪</P>
<P>Why GOD dealeth thus with me, I know not now, but I shall know hereafter. However this I know, that this Voyage has been greatly for my Good. — For I have had a glorious Opportunity of searching the Scriptures, com∣posing Discourses, writing Letters, and com∣muning with my own Heart. — We have been on Board just nine Weeks and three Days. — A long and perilous, but profitable Voyage to my Soul: For I hope it has learnt me, in some measure, to endure Hardships as becometh a Minister of CHRIST. My Clothes have not been off (except to change me) all the Passage: Part of the Time I lay on open Deck, Part
<PB N="90" REF="004453_0089_100D9F2EBAED05A0"/>
on a Chest, and the Remainder on a Bed-stead cover'd with my <HI>Buffaloe</HI>'s Skin. These Things, though little in themselves, yet are great in their Consequences; and whoever despiseth small Acts of bodily Discipline, it is to be feared, will insensibly lose his spiritual Life by little and little.— Many inward Trials also GOD has been pleased to send me, which I believe, he has sanctified to my great Good. I am now going on Shore, to the House of a wealthy Gentleman, whom GOD has commanded to receive me. I may yet be exposed to many Perils by Land e'er I see my dear Friends: But his Grace who has preserved me from so many Perils by Water, will also be sufficient for me on dry Land. Whilst I continue on this side Eternity, I never expect to be free from Trials, only to change them: For it is necessary to heal the Pride of my Heart, that such should come: With a particular fear and trembling, I think of going to <HI>London.</HI> But he that preserved <HI>Daniel,</HI> in the Den of Lions, and the three Children in the fiery Furnace, will, I hope, preserve me from the fiery Trial of Popularity, and from the misguided Zeal of those, who without Cause, are my Enemies. <HI>Father, into thy Hands I commend my Spirit. Magnify still thy free Grace in me. Guide me by thy unerring Wisdom, receive, O receive me for thy infinite Mercies sake, in CHRIST JESUS, into Glory hereafter!</HI></P>
<P>As for the Success of my Ministry, whilst on Board, I shall only say, That I hope much Sin has been prevented, and one I hope effectually

converted, who is to be my Fellow Traveller to <HI>England. LORD if I can but be made instru∣mental to save one Soul, I care not if I am tossed on the Ocean through my whole Life. Glory be to GOD on High!</HI></P>
<P>It is observable, that just as we had cast An∣chor, a violent Wind rose, which (had it hap∣pen'd sooner) must have greatly hurt us. <HI>Mar∣vellous are thy Works, O LORD, and that my Soul knoweth right well!</HI></P>
<P>About seven at Night I dress'd myself and went on Shore, and was received into a strong Castle belonging to Mr. <HI>Mac Mahon,</HI> the Gen∣tleman who sent me an Invitation. He himself was not at home, having went some Miles up to meet me; but his Maid Servant kindly received us; <HI>I asked for Water, and she gave me Milk, and brought forth Butter in a lordly Dish</HI>: And never did I eat a more comfortable Meal: About ten the Gentleman (having missed of me at the Place appointed) came through the Rain, and entertain'd us most hospitably, and about One we went to Bed; I hope with Hearts full of a Sense of the Divine Love. <HI>My Song shall henceforward be always of the loving Kindness of the LORD. I will make mention of his Righte∣ousness and Truth, in the Assemblies of his Saints. Now our Water is turned into Wine!</HI></P>

<P>As I rode along, and observed the Meanness of the poor People's living in these Parts, I said, if my Parishioners at <HI>Georgia,</HI> complain to me of Hardships, I must tell them how the <HI>Irish</HI> live; for their Habitations are far more despi∣cable, and their Living as hard, I believe, as to Food; and yet, no doubt, Content dwells in many of these low Huts. <HI>A Man's Life does not consist in the Abundance of the Things which he possesseth.</HI></P>
<P>At my first coming into our Inn, we kneeled down and prayed; and again at Night sung Psalms, and prayed with the Captain and several of my Ship-mates. — The first Time I believe the Room was ever put to such a Use by a Ship's Crew and their Chaplain.</P>

moderate Computation thirty <HI>English</HI> Miles from <HI>Kilrush</HI>: But this is not the first Piece of <HI>Irish</HI> I have met with.— <HI>Their innocent Blunders often extort Smiles from me.</HI></P>
<P>As I stopped to have my Horses shoe'd, I went into one of the poor People's Cabbins, as they call them, but it may as well be called a Stye, a Barn, or a Poultry Coop. It was about twenty Feet long, and twelve broad, the Walls built with Turf and Mud. In it, was a Man threshing Corn, two Swine feeding; two Dogs, several Geese, a Man, his Wife, three Children, and a great Fire.— <HI>Georgia</HI> Huts are Palaces to it.— Indeed the People live very poorly in this Part, some walk barefoot with their Shoes in their Hands to save them from wearing out, others out of Necessity. And I observed many of their Feet to be much swell'd, and ready to gush out with Blood, through Extremity of Cold. — <HI>LORD, Why is my Lot cast into a fairer Ground? Thy free Grace alone has made the Difference!</HI></P>
<P>Whilst I was in the Cabin, as they call their little <HI>Irish</HI> Huts, I talk'd with the Woman in the House, and found she was a <HI>Roman Catholic:</HI> And indeed the whole Commo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lty almost, are of the <HI>Romish</HI> Profession, and seem to be so very ignorant, that they may well be termed the <HI>Wild Irish.</HI> No Wonder, when the Key of Knowledge is taken from them.

<P><HI>Saturday, Nov.</HI> 19. Presuming the People where I lay last Night, were <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> I neglected to call them in to join in Prayer, but to my great Grief found afterwards that some were Protestants, and expected Prayers from me. <HI>Oh base Ingratitude! Is this my Zeal for my late signal Deliverance? Oh treacherous Heart! Fye upon thee, fye upon thee. GOD be merciful to me a Sinner!</HI></P>
<P>About two this Afternoon we reach'd <HI>Limerick,</HI> a large Garrison Town, with a Cathedral in it, about twenty one <HI>English</HI> Miles from <HI>Fourth∣fargus.</HI> The Roads, as we came along, grew better; but the People much more subtle and designing. Here are also many Beggars, which I impute to the Want of Parish Provisions for them. — At Evening Prayer we went to the Cathedral, and returned public Thanks for our safe Arrival. The Remainder of the Night was spent in necessary Business, refreshing our Bodies, religious Conversation, and in writing some Things I stood in need of.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="004453_0094_100D9F3C02CD1250"/>Good GOD! Where was I last <HI>Saturday?</HI> In Hunger, Cold and Thirsting; but now I enjoy fullness of Bread, and all Things conve∣nient for me, GOD grant, I may not, <HI>Jeshurun</HI> like, <HI>wax fat and kick.</HI> Perhaps it is more difficult to know how to abound, than how to want. But I endeavour to receive both with Thanksgiving.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Nov.</HI> 20. Having sent last Night to inform Dr. <HI>Burscough,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Limerick,</HI> that I was lately arrived: At his Lordship's Appoint∣ment, I waited on him this Morning, and was received with the utmost Candour and Civility. At his Lordship's Request, I preached in the Morning at the Cathedral, to a very numerous Audience, who seem'd universally affected, and full of Expectation that I would preach in the Afternoon; but Providence did not seem to open a Door. But why should not a strange Mini∣ster always offer his Service? I think it is a wrong Piece of Modesty not to do it. For a Sermon from a Stranger, may do more good than many from those the People are constantly used to.</P>
<P>After Sermon the Mayor sent twice to invite me, but I was pre-engaged to the Bishop, who kindly invited both me and my Friend, thanked me for my Sermon, and offered me the free Use of his Palace, and would have insisted on my accepting of it, had I not told his Lordship I was to leave <HI>Limerick</HI> in the Morning: <HI>Oh into what a wealthy Place has my good GOD brought me?</HI> How does he every where command some or

other to receive me? As I was eating at Dinner, I was meditating on the Divine Goodness in spreading such a Table for me, when last <HI>Sunday</HI> I was in Danger almost of perishing with Hunger. But I thought at the same Time, if this was so great a Blessing, what an infinitely greater one will it be, after the Troubles of this Life, to sit down and eat Bread in the Kingdom of GOD. <HI>O that I may be accounted worthy of that heavenly Banquet!</HI></P>

<P><HI>Monday, Nov.</HI> 20. Went about <HI>Limerick</HI> Town this Morning, to dispatch some necessary Business. And found the good Seed sown yesterday, had received a Blessing from above. For all the Inhabitants seem'd alarmed, and look'd most wishfully at me, as I passed along. One substantial Tradesman in particular even compell'd me to come in, and shewed me and my Friend uncommon Civilities, and told me how sollicitous the People were for my staying longer.— Another came to my Inn, and begg'd me to come and see him, which I did. — And the good Bishop, when I went to take leave of his Lordship, kissed me, and said these Words, <HI>Mr.</HI> Whitefield, <HI>GOD bless you, I wish you Success abroad. Had you staid in Town, this House should have been your Home.</HI></P>
<P>About four in the Afternoon, against much Persuasion to the Contrary, we left <HI>Limerick,</HI> and reach'd <HI>Tuller-Bridge,</HI> about six Miles distant from thence, by six o'Clock, where I and my

<P>In my Way I had a short Conference with a <HI>Roman Catholic,</HI> who seem'd more knowing than the Generality of those of that Persuasion, but sadly misguided.

<P>As far as I can find by all I converse with, they place Religion in being of the <HI>Protestant</HI> or <HI>Roman Catholic</HI> Communion, and are quite igno∣rant of the Nature of inward Purity and Holi∣ness of Heart.— <HI>Lord, the Christian World is cast into a deep sleep, send forth, I beseech thee, some faithful and true Pastors to awaken them out of it.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Sunday, Nov.</HI> 26. Preached twice to Day at the Churches of <HI>Waborough</HI> and St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s▪ I believe with Success; for GOD enabled me to speak with Power.

<P><HI>Tuesday, Nov.</HI> 28.

<HEAD>A CONTINUATION OF Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s JOURNAL, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>LONDON.</HEAD>
<P>FRIDAY, <HI>December</HI> 8. About Noon I reached <HI>London,</HI> was received with much Joy by my Christian Friends, and joined with them in Psalms and Thanksgiving for my safe Arrival. My Heart was greatly enlarged hereby.</P>
<P>In the Evening went to a truly Christian Society in <HI>Fetter-Lane,</HI> and perceived God had greatly watered the Seed sown by my Ministry, when last at <HI>London. The Lord increase it more and more.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Dec.</HI> 9. Waited this Morning on the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> and met with a favourable Reception.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, December</HI> 10. When I was on Board the <HI>Mary,</HI> those particular Parts of the Book of <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> which relate to the Opposition he met with from the False Prophets, were deeply
<PB N="108" REF="004453_0107_100D825353971748"/>
impressed upon my Soul. And now I begin to see the Wisdom of God in it. For five Churches have been already denied me, and some of the Clergy, if possible, would oblige me to depart out of these Coasts. <HI>But I rejoice in this Opposition, it being a certain Sign that a more effectual Door will be opened, since there are so many Adversaries.</HI></P>
<P>However, I had an Opportunity of preaching in the Morning at St. <HI>Helen</HI>'s, and at <HI>Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ngton</HI> in the Afternoon, to large Congregations in∣deed, with great Demonstrations of the Spirit, and with Power.</P>
<P>Here seems to be a great pouring out of the Spirit; and many, who were awakened by my Preaching a Year ago, are now grown strong Men in CHRIST, by the Ministrations of my dear Friends and Fellow-Labourers, <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Charles W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sley. Blessed be God, I rejoice in the Coming of the Kingdom of his dear Son.</HI></P>
<P>The old Doctrine about Justification by Faith only, I found much revived, and many Letters had been sent concerning it to me, all which, I providentially missed of. For now, I come un∣prejudiced, and can the more easily see who is in the Right. And who dares assert that we are not ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tified in the Sight of GOD, merely by an Act of Faith in JESUS CHRIST, without any Regar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Works past, present, or to come?</P>
<P>In the Evening I went to <HI>Fetter-lane</HI> Society, where we had (what might not improperly be called) a Love-Feast, eating a little Bread and Water, and spending about two Hours in Sing∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g and Prayers, and I found my Heart greatly
<PB N="109" REF="004453_0108_100D9F465B1E2768"/>
united with the Brethren. <HI>Surely a primitive Spirit is reviving amongst us. May God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>it my Heart to theirs more and more!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, December</HI> 24. Preached twice, and went in the Evening to <HI>Crooked-lane</HI> Society, where GOD enabled me to withstand several▪ Persons, who cavilled against the Doctrine of the <HI>New Birth.</HI> But the Passion, wherewith they oppose, is a Demonstration, that they themselves have not experienced it. <HI>LORD make them Partakers of it, for thy dear</HI> SON<HI>'s sake.</HI></P>
<P>After I left <HI>Crooked-lane,</HI> I went and expounded to a Company at Mr. <HI>B</HI>—'s, in <HI>Little<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Britain</HI>▪ then I went to another Love-Feast at <HI>Fetter-lane</HI>; and, it being <HI>Christmas-Eve,</HI> continued till near Four in the Morning in Prayer, Psalms, and Thanksgiving, with many truly Christian Bre∣thren; and my Heart was much enlarged, and full of Love. — GOD gave me a great Spirit of Supplication. <HI>Adored be his free Grace in</HI> CHRIST JESUS, <HI>Amen</HI> and <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, Decemb.</HI> 25. About Four went and prayed, and expounded to another Society in <HI>Red<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ross-street,</HI> consisting of near two or three hundred People, and the Room was exceeding hot. I had been watching unto Prayer all Night, yet GOD vouchsafed so to fill me with his Blessed Spirit, that I spoke with as great Power as ever I did in my Life. My Body was weak, but I found a supernatural Strength, and the Truth of that saying, <HI>When I am weak, then I am strong.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="004453_0109_100D9F48E48E75A0"/>At Six I went to <HI>Crutched Fryar</HI>'s Society, and expounded as well as I could, but perceived myself a little oppressed with Drowsiness. <HI>How does the corruptible Body weigh down the Soul! When shall I be delivered from the Burden of this Flesh?</HI></P>
<P>Preached thrice, and assisted in administring the Sacrament the same Day without going to sleep. GOD will make his Power to be known in me. — This Day 24 Years, was I baptized, LORD! to what little Purpose have I lived? However, I sealed my Baptismal Covenant with my dear Saviour's most blessed Body and Blood, and trust in his Strength I shall keep and perform it. <HI>Amen, Amen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, December</HI> 30. Preached nine Times this Week, and expounded near 18 Times, with great Power and Enlargement. — Blessed be GOD! I am every Moment employed from Morning 'till Midnight. — There's no End of People's coming and sending to me, and they seem more and more desirous, like New-born Babes, to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fed with the sincere Milk of the Word. — What a great Work has been wrought in the Heares of many within this Twelve-month! Now know I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that though Thousands might come at first out of Curiosity, yet GOD has prevented and quickened them by his free Grace.—<HI>Oh that I could be humble and thankful.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Glory be to GOD that be fills me continually, not only with Peace, but also Joy in the</HI> HOLY GHOST. — Before my Arrival, I thought I should envy my Brethren's Success in the
<PB N="111" REF="004453_0110_100D9F4BA7AC5770"/>
Ministry; but Blessed be GOD▪ I rejoyce in it, and am glad to see CHRIST's Kingdom come, whatsoever Instruments GOD shall make Use of to bring it about. — Sometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> perceive my self deserted for a little While, and much op∣pressed, especially before preaching, but Comfort soon after flows in. — Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Kingdom of GOD is within me. <HI>O free Grace in</HI> CHRIST!</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, December</HI> 31. Preached twice to large Congregations, especially in the Afternoon, at <HI>Spittlefields.</HI> — I had a great Hoarseness upon me, and was deserted before I went up into the Pulpit; but GOD strengthened me to speak, so as to be heard by all.</P>
<P>After I left <HI>Spittlefields,</HI> my Cold being very great, I despaired of speaking much more that Night. — But GOD enabled me to expound to two Companies in <HI>Southwark,</HI> and I was never more enlarged in Prayer in my whole Life.— These Words, <HI>And the Power of the Lord was present to heal them,</HI> were much pressed upon my Soul, and indeed I believe it was. For many were prick'd to the Heart, and <HI>felt</HI> themselves to be Sinners. <HI>O that all the World knew and felt that!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, January</HI> 1. Received the Holy Sacrament, preached twice, and expounded twice, and found this to be the happiest <HI>New-Year's Day</HI> that I ever yet saw. Oh! What Mercies has the Lord shewn me since this Time Twelvemonth! And yet I shall see greater Things than these. <HI>O that my Heart may be prepared to see them! O that my old Things may pass away, and all Things become new!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="004453_0111_100D9F4EB5073DB8"/>Had a Love-Feast with our Brethren at <HI>Fetter-lane,</HI> and spent the whole Night in close Prayer. Psalms, and Thanksgivings.— GOD supported me without Sleep, <HI>Oh that our Despisers were Partakers of our Joys!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, January</HI> 2. Staid at Home o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> purpose to receive those, who wanted to consult me. — <HI>Blessed be GOD,</HI> from seven in the Morning, till three in the Afternoon, People came, some telling me what GOD had done for their Souls, and others crying out, <HI>What shall we do to be saved?</HI> Being obliged to go out after this, I referred several 'till <HI>Thursday.</HI>— GOD enabled me to give them Answers of Peace! How does God work by my unworthy Hands! His Mercies melt me down, <HI>O that I was thankful!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, January</HI> 4. Though my Cold continued, and I feared it would prevent my speaking, yet GOD enabled me to expound with extraordinary Power in a private Society; and then to preach at <HI>Wapping-Chappel,</HI> so that the Word pierced the Hearers Souls; and afterwards I expounded and prayed for an Hour and an Half with great Power and Demonstra∣tion of the Spirit, and my Heart was full of GOD. <HI>How immediately does</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>reward me for my poor Services! Assoon as my daily Work is done, he says, Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord, He commands, and it is done.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, January</HI> 5. Held a Conference at <HI>Islington,</HI> concerning several Things of very great Importance, with seven true Ministers of
<PB N="113" REF="004453_0112_100D9F5049454A80"/>
JESUS CHRIST, despised <HI>Methodists,</HI> whom GOD has brought together from the <HI>East</HI> and the <HI>West,</HI> the <HI>North</HI> and the <HI>South.</HI>— What we were in doubt about, after Prayer, we determined by Lot, and every Thing else was carried on with great Love, Meekness and Devotion.— We continued in Fasting and Prayer 'till three o' Clock, and then parted with a full Conviction that GOD was going to do great Things among us. <HI>O that we may be any way instrumental to his Glory! That he would make us Vessels pure and holy, meet for our Master's Use!</HI></P>
<P>Expounded twice afterwards in <HI>London</HI> with great Power, and then was much enlarged for near an Hour in Prayer, in <HI>Fetter-lane</HI> Society.— The Spirit of Supplication increases in my Heart daily.— <HI>May it increase ever more and more!</HI></P>
<P>Did not find the Pity I ought, upon seeing a Brother full of Self-love. <HI>Lord enlarge my narrow Heart, and give me that Charity which rejoices not in Iniquity, but in the Truth.</HI> — Perceived something a little bordering on Envy towards my Brother <HI>H.</HI> — I find more and more, that true Humility consists in being submissive to those, who are a little above, or a little below us.— <HI>Oh when shall I come to rejoice in others Gifts and Graces as much as in my own! I am resolved to wrestle with</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>by Faith and Prayer 'till he thus blesses me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, January</HI> 6. Preached six Times this Week, and should have preached a seventh Time, but one Minister would not permit me; which caused me to pray for him
<PB N="114" REF="004453_0113_100D9F5258F67CD8"/>
most earnestly, <HI>Blessed be God, I can say, I love mine Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>Expounded twice or thrice every Night this Week. The Holy Ghost so powerfully worked upon my Hearers, pricking their Hearts, and melting them into such Floods of Tears, that a spiritual Man said, He never saw the like before.—GOD is with me of a Truth. Adored be his unmerited Goodness, I find his Grace quickening me more and more every Day. My Understanding is more enlightned, my Affec∣tions more enflamed, and my Heart full of Love towards GOD and Man. — <HI>Oh! that the Scoffers of these last Days were not only almost, but altogether such as I am, except these indwelling Corruptions!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, January</HI> 7. Preached twice to Day, and expounded with great Power to three Societies, one of which I never visited before.— GOD <HI>grant I may pursue the Method of expounding and praying extempore. I find God blesses it more and more.</HI></P>
<P>Had another Love-Feast, and spent the whole Night in Prayer and Thanksgiving at <HI>Fetter-lane.</HI> — There was a great pouring out of the Spirit amongst the Brethren; but I cannot say I was so full of Joy as the last Night we spent together.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, January</HI> 8. Tho' I sat up all Night▪ yet GOD carried me through the Work of the Day with about an Hour's Sleep. — Expounded in the Evening, and confuted a virulent Opposer of the Doctrine of the <HI>New Birth,</HI> and Justifi∣cation
<PB N="115" REF="004453_0114_100D9F55544AFA10"/>
by Faith only. — But what can be said to those that will not be convinced? <HI>Lord, open thou their Hearts and Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>Spent the Remainder of the Evening with our Bands, which are little Combinations of six or more Christians meeting together to compare their Experiences. <HI>Build ye up one another, even as also ye do. — Confess your Faults one to another, and pray for one another, that ye may be healed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, January</HI> 10. Stay'd at home again to day, to talk with those that came to consult me, and found that GOD has awakened several, and excited in them a Hunger and Thirst after Righteousness by my Sermon on the <HI>Power of</HI> CHRIST<HI>'s Resurrection,</HI> and <HI>Have ye received the Holy Ghost?</HI> Every Day I hear of some∣body or another quickened to a Sense of the divine Life. — <HI>Oh what abundant Reason have I to be thankful.</HI></P>
<P>This Evening I preached a Sermon at <HI>Great St. Helens,</HI> for erecting a Church for the <HI>Salt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣burghers,</HI> and collected Thirty-three Pounds! <HI>Blessed be GOD!</HI> The People gave most readily, many wishing they had more to give; <HI>for which we afterwards prayed and gave Thanks.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OXFORD.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Wednesday, January</HI> 11. Slept about three Hours, rose at five, set out at ten, and reached <HI>Oxford</HI> by five in the Evening. As I entered the City, I called to mind the Mercies I had received since I left it. They are more than I
<PB N="116" REF="004453_0115_100D9F59031DDA00"/>
am able to express. <HI>Oh that my Heart may be melted down by a Sense of them,</HI> Amen, <HI>Lord</HI> JESUS! — Spent the Remainder of the Evening very agreeably with several Christian Friends.— <HI>May</HI> GOD <HI>sanctify our Meeting!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, January</HI> 12. Breakfasted with six∣teen or seventeen Christian Brethren; expounded and read Prayers at the Castle, to many devout Souls. Afterwards I waited on the Bishop of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> who received me very kindly. — Waited on the Master of <HI>Pembroke</HI>? afterwards on the Arch-deacon. — Went to public Worship at <HI>Pembroke.</HI> — Supp'd, prayed, and sung Psalms with a Room full of Brethren at Mr. <HI>F</HI>—'s; then adjourned to <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> College, where GOD assisted me to talk clearly of the New Birth, and Justification by Faith alone, with one that opposed it. — <HI>Lord, open thou our Eyes, that we may prove what is that acceptable and perfect Will of God!</HI> — Received the Holy Sacrament at St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s, expounded with great Power at Mr. <HI>F</HI>—'s, went with the other Candidates for Holy Orders to subscribe to the Articles, and secretly pray'd that we all might have our Names written in the Book of Life. — Drank Tea with a well-disposed Gentleman Commoner, and had close Conversation with many others at <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> College. — I enjoyed great Tranquility of Soul, and had much Reason to bless GOD for sending me to the University. <HI>Oh! that I may be prepared for receiving the</HI> HOLY GHOST <HI>to Morrow by the Imposition of Hands. Amen, Lord</HI> JESUS, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="004453_0116_100D9F5A935251D0"/><HI>Sunday, January</HI> 14. This, blessed be GOD, has been a Day of fat Things. — Rose in the Morning, and prayed and sung Psalms lustily, and with a good Courage; and afterwards was ordained Priest at <HI>Christ's Church.</HI> Before, I was a little dissipated, but at Imposition of Hands, my Mind was in an humble Frame, and I received Grace in the Holy Sacrament.— That I might begin to make Proof of my Ministry, I preached, and administred the Sacrament at the Castle; and preached in the Afternoon at St. <HI>Albans</HI> to a crowded Congre∣gation. — The Church was surrounded with Gowns-men of all Degrees, who, contrary to their Custom, stood attentive at the Windows during my Sermon. — GOD enabled me to preach with the Demonstration of the Spirit, and with Power, and quite took away my Hoarseness, so that I could lift up my Voice like a Trumpet. — After Sermon, I joined in giving Thanks to our good GOD for all the Mercies he had conferred upon me; then I read Prayers at <HI>Carfax,</HI> expounded to a large and devout Company both of Men and Women at a private House, and spent the Remainder of the Evening with thirteen more, where GOD gave me great Cheerfulness of Spirit.</P>

<HEAD>LONDON.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Monday, January</HI> 15. Took a most af∣fectionate Leave of my dear <HI>Oxon</HI> Brethren, set out at Seven, reached <HI>London</HI> by Five, spent the Evening in answering some Letters, especially
<PB N="118" REF="004453_0117_100D9F5D22F4F980"/>
one from <HI>Howel Harris,</HI> an Instrument, under GOD, of doing much good in <HI>Wales.</HI> — Read a Pamphlet wrote against me by a Clergyman, I bless GOD, without any Emotion; prayed most heartily for the Author; opened the Corruptions of my Heart to my Brethren in Bands, and felt great Peace consequent thereupon.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, January</HI> 16. After much Opposition, read Prayers, and preached to a thronged and affected Audience at St. <HI>Helens.</HI> — After this, I expounded twice to two Companies, and prayed by Name for the Author of the Pamphlet; left my Auditors in Tears, and went home full of Love, and Joy, and Peace, which passeth all Understanding. — <HI>Oh that he felt what I do! Happy, unspeakably happy, would he then be!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, January</HI> 17. Din'd with and convinced several that were prejudiced against extempore Prayer. — Waited on the Trustees, and was most kindly received. — Afterwards much assisted in expounding twice at Mr. <HI>C</HI>—'s. —<HI>The more I am opposed, the more</HI> GOD <HI>enlightens my Understanding. So it was formerly, so it is now.</HI> — Spent the Remainder of the Evening at <HI>Fetter-lane</HI> Society; and GOD enabled me to tell of some Experiences, which I hope comforted their Hearts.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday, January</HI> 18. Perceived myself much disordered, so that I was obliged to lie down to sleep. But afterwards GOD greatly enlarged my Heart, and enabled me to expound to two Societies. I made a Collection for two poor Housekeepers, — <HI>I find Action is the best

Way to take all Oppression off the Spirits. God w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll meet and bless us when doing his Work.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, Jan.</HI> 19. Did some necessary Business for <HI>Georgia,</HI> and spent the Afternoon in visiting some dissenting Brethren, who are Christians indeed. <HI>But, as such, I acknowledge all who love our Lord</HI> JESUS <HI>in Sincerity and Truth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Jan.</HI> 20. Preached three Times this Week, and expounded to about sixteen thronged Companies, wherein GOD gave me great Power and Success. — Had many Contri∣butions sent me in for the Orphan-house.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, January</HI> 21. Went this Morning and received the Sacrament at the Hands of the Minister who wrote against me. Blessed be GOD, I do not feel the least Resentment against, but a Love for him; for I believe he has a Zeal for GOD, though, in my Opinion, not according to Knowledge. <HI>Oh that I could do him any Good!</HI></P>
<P>Preached twice with great Power and Clea∣ness in my Voice to two thronged Congregations, especially in the Afternoon, when I believe near a thousand People were in the Churchyard, and hundreds more returned Home that could not come in. <HI>Thus GOD magnifies his Power, most when most opposed.</HI></P>
<P>Expounded twice afterwards, where the People pressed most vehemently to hear the Word. — GOD enabled me to speak with the Demonstration of the Spirit, and with Power, and the Remainder of the Evening, filled me with a humble Sense of his infinite Mercies. <HI>I
<PB N="120" REF="004453_0119_100D9F62A8FB3DD0"/>
think I am never more humble than when exalted. — By the Grace of GOD I am what I am. Oh that I could be thankful!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, January</HI> 22. Spent all the Day in necessary Business for my poor Flock, and in going about doing good. In the Evening I expounded to three several Societies, one of which was the most polite I ever yet saw; but GOD enabled me to speak upon the Doctrine of the New Birth; and however some might mock, yet others, I believe, were affected, espe∣cially three Quakers, who afterwards came and paid me a visit, and glorified GOD on my Behalf.— <HI>Oh how thankful, how humble ought I to be! — GOD fills me with Love, Peace and Joy in the</HI> Holy Ghost.— <HI>Such is his Free Grace in</HI> CHRIST JESUS!</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, January</HI> 23. Staid at Home to Day as usual, to receive People, and still had the Comfort of hearing many coming to me, who have been awaken'd to a Sense of the New-Birth. <HI>What Reason have I to bless GOD for sending me to</HI> England! <HI>How does he daily set his Seal to my Ministry! Praise him all the Host of his, let every Thing that hath Breath praise the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>Received a Packet of Letters from my dear Friend <HI>H—m,</HI> by which I find the infinite Wisdom of GOD more and more, in sending me to <HI>England.</HI>— The poor People of <HI>Savannah</HI> love me still most affectionately. But the Colony seems to be at a low Ebb. — <HI>Poor</HI> Georgia! <HI>When thou art universally d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,

and quite despairest of human Help,</HI> then <HI>will God manifest his mighty Arm in thy Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>Read Prayers and preached at St. <HI>Helens,</HI> with great Power to a crowded and attentive Audience. — Was enabled to expound to two Companies, and collected above Forty Shillings for the Orphan-house of <HI>Georgia.</HI> I could wish to have it built with Mites. — <HI>Oh how does the Holy Ghost cause me to joy in GOD! How does he bring me acquainted more and more with his faith∣ful Servants! Not unto me, O</HI> LORD, <HI>not unto me, but to thy Name be the Glory!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, January</HI> 24. Preached a Charity Sermon, went to <HI>Newington</HI> to see Dr. <HI>Watts,</HI> and returned in the Evening and expounded with Power to two Companies. — Wrote several Letters to my Friends at <HI>Savannah,</HI> and was filled with the Holy Ghost; and <HI>Oh that all that deny the Promise of the Father, might thus receive it themselves!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, January</HI> 25. Received the Sacra∣ment at <HI>Bow,</HI> where four of my Opposers administred; one of whom was the Person that wrote the self-answering Pamphlet against me. At first a Thought darted into my Mind that they were of a persecuting Spirit, but I soon checked it, and was filled with Love towards them. <HI>GOD grant they may be like minded towards me.</HI></P>
<P>At two in the Afternoon read Prayers and preached at <HI>Christ Church, Spittlefields,</HI> for the Orphan-house.— The Congregation was not so large as might be expected, and that of the poorest Sort, so that I began to doubt. But
<PB N="122" REF="004453_0121_100D9F668B35D7B0"/>
wherefore did I fear? For GOD enabled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to preach with Power, and twenty-five Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds were collected, to our great Surprise, and to the Glory of our great and good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>OD; for which we kneeled down and gave most hearty Thanks.</P>
<P>This done, I went and gave a Word or two of Exhortation, and prayed to a Comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny that waited for me. Then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> expounded with un∣common Power to another Society in <HI>Leadenhall-street,</HI> and collected very near five Pounds for the Orphan-house. <HI>Blessed be God through</HI> Christ.</P>
<P>About Eight I went to another Society, after Nine to a third, at both which I spoke with the Demonstration of the Spirit, and made Collec∣tions for the Orphan-house, and was filled with the Holy Ghost, which very much strengthned my Body, and make my Feet like Hart's Feet. <HI>The Strength GOD gives me would surprize me, did I not know what a gracious Master I serve.</HI></P>
<P>Received a Letter from <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> from a truly pious Gentlemen, who tells me his Heart was knit to me most strongly, upon the reading of my Journal. <HI>How many are there, whom I know not, praying for me in secret! Surely GOD intends to bring mighty Things to pass. — Is not his Strength made perfect in Weakness?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, January</HI> 26. Waited upon an opposing Clergyman, and had a Conference with him of near two Hours. His grand Objection was against our private Societies, and using extempore Prayer, which he grounded on the Authority of the Canons, and the Act of <HI>Charles</HI> II. In Answer, I shewed that that
<PB N="123" REF="004453_0122_100D9F68D62D2F60"/>
Act was entirely levelled against seditious schismatical Meetings, contrary to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> which confines us to a Form in public Worship only. He replied, that ours was public Worship; but this I deny; for ours were Societies never intended to be set up in Opposi∣tion to the public Worship, by Law established; but only in imitation of the primitive Christians, who continued daily with one Accord in the Temple, and yet in Fello<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ship building up one another, and exhorting one another from House to House.— Went with Mr. <HI>Seward</HI> to <HI>Bexly,</HI> about ten Miles off <HI>London,</HI> where I preached to a large Congregation, to their great Comfort, and afterwards spent the Evening most delight∣fully in religious Conversation, and in singing Psalms and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs with Mr. <HI>Delamot</HI>'s Family, who seem almost with one Accord, ready to receive JESUS CHRIST. <HI>A happier Houshold have I seldom found, or one that more resembles that of</HI> Martha, Mary, <HI>and their Brother</HI> Lazarus.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, January</HI> 27. Slept but little to Night, as well as the Night before, but was much strengthened without it by the Holy Spirit. Rose about Five, spent above an Hour most agreeably in Prayer, singing and reading the Scriptures with the Church in Mr. <HI>Delamot</HI>'s House; some of whom, after the Example of their Lord, passed the whole Night in the same delightful Employment.</P>
<P>Came to <HI>London</HI> about Nine in the Morning, and expounded twice in <HI>Beech-lane,</HI> where I
<PB N="124" REF="004453_0123_100D9F6C8595A448"/>
believe near seven hundred People were present; collected five Pounds for the Orphan-house.</P>
<P>Had extraordinary Comforts this Week, heard much of what GOD has done abroad for me in other Places, where I am not known in the Flesh, and desired greatly to be humble and thankful▪</P>
<P>Received the Sacrament at <HI>Crooked-Lane,</HI> but was a little dissipated; however I found I received CHRIST, and fed on him in my Heart, by Faith with Thanksgiving. Afterwards went and preached at <HI>Ironmongers</HI> Alms-houses at St. <HI>Catherine</HI>'s in the Afternoon; afterwards ex∣pounded to two large Companies in the <HI>Min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> with such Demonstration of the Spirit, as I never spoke with before. — I offered JESUS CHRIST freely to Sinners, and many, I believe, were truely pricked to the Heart. Now, my Friends, your Prayers are heard, GOD has given me a double Portion of his Spirit indeed. <HI>Oh free Grace in</HI> CHRIST JESUS. <HI>With what Love, Peace, and Joy does GOD fill this Soul of mine! LORD I am not worthy, but thy Mercie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in</HI> Christ Jesus <HI>are infinite.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday▪ Jan.</HI> 29. Expounded twice, and sat up till near One in the Morning, with my honoured Brother and Fellow-Labourer, <HI>Iohn Wesley,</HI> in Conference with two Clergymen of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and some other strong Opposers of the Doctrine of the New-Birth.— GOD enabled me with great Simplicity to declare what he had done for my Soul, which made them look upon me as a Madman. <HI>We
<PB N="125" REF="004453_0124_100D9F6E1A459600"/>
speak what we do know, and testify that we have seen, and they receive not our Witness. Now therefore I am fully convinced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here is a fundamental Difference between us and them. They believe only an outward</HI> CHRIST, <HI>we far∣ther believe that he must be inwardly formed in our Hearts also. But the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of GOD, for they are Foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, Jan.</HI> 30. Preached at <HI>Duke's-Place</HI> and St. <HI>Helens,</HI> to crouded Audiences, and after∣wards expounded twice on <HI>Dowgate-hill,</HI> where the People pressed mightily to come in. The Minister of the Parish threatens the Master of the House with a Prosecution, though it will be hard for him to prove such Societies any ways contrary to the Laws either of GOD or Man.</P>

<P><HI>Wednesday, January</HI> 31. Slept about two Hours, rose at Three in the Morning, and went with some Christian Friends in a Boat to <HI>Graves∣end,</HI> where I have been long expected. — GOD inclined the Ministers Hearts to let me have the Use of both the Pulpits, and I preached and read Prayers at Three in the Afternoon at the Church without the Town; and did the same at the Church in the Town, and the People, as elsewhere, hung upon me to hear the Word of GOD. — <HI>God is with me wherever I go.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, Feb.</HI> 1. Read Prayers and expoun∣ded on the third of St. <HI>John</HI>; expounded at a

<P>I spent the Remainder of the Evening in singing Hymns, and religious Conversation; took Boat about Eleven, spoke warmly to the Passengers, and came to <HI>London</HI> rejoicing about Five in the Morning. <HI>The Lord preserve my going out, and my coming in, from this Time forth for evermore.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Friday, Febr.</HI> 2. Slept about two Hours, rose and went and preached at <HI>Islington,</HI> and collected twenty-two Pounds for my Orphan-house.</P>
<P>Had a great Number of Communicants, and was told my preaching was attended with un∣common Power. This is the <HI>first</HI> Time I have preached without Notes, (for when I preached at <HI>Deptford</HI> and <HI>Gravesend,</HI> I only repeated a written Sermon) but I find myself now, as it were, constrained to do it.</P>
<P>Expounded in the Evening, and collected three Pounds for the Orphan-house, at Mr. <HI>Abbot</HI>'s; preached extempore with great Free∣dom at <HI>Wapping-Chappel,</HI> then expounded to another Society, and returned Home without Fatigue or Weariness. <HI>How does GOD deal

with me! He gives me a Heaven upon Earth, and makes my Heart leap for Joy almost continu∣ally. — Oh that all who now oppose it, were partakers of this Joy!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, February</HI> 3. Staid at Home this Day on purpose to settle my private Affairs; and, blessed be GOD, did it greatly to my Satisfaction. — Was very much composed in Spirit, began a new Society at the House of Mr. <HI>M—n</HI>; and was much assisted in expounding twice at <HI>Beech-lane</HI> to two Companies, making in all near a thousand People. — Visited a sick Brother, came home full of Peace, and Love, and Joy in the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P>Near nine Times has GOD enabled me to preach this Week, and to expound 12 or 14 Times; near forty Pounds, I believe, have been collected for the Orphan-house. — <HI>I find I gain greater Light and Knowledge, by preaching extempore. — So that I fear I should quench the Spirit, did I not go on to speak as he gives me Utterance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, February</HI> 4. Had a comfortable Night's Rest▪ was warmed much by ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king to an almost Christian, that came to ask me certain Questions. — Preached in the Morning at St. <HI>George's in the East,</HI> collected eighteen Pounds for the Orphan-house, and had, I believe, 600 Communicants, which highly offended the officiating Curate. <HI>Poor Man, I pitied and prayed for him sincerely.</HI></P>
<P>Preached again at <HI>Christ-Church, Spittlefields,</HI> gave Thanks, and sung Psalms at a private

House: Went thenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to St. <HI>Margaret's, West∣minster</HI>; but something breaking belonging to the Coach, could not get thither 'till the middle of Prayers. — Went through the People to the Minister's Pew, but finding it locked, I returned to the Vestry till the <HI>Sexton</HI> could be found. Being there informed that another Minister intended to preach, I desired several Times that I might go Home: My Friends would by no Means consent, telling me I was appointed by the Trustees to preach, and that if I did not, the People would go out of the Church; at my Request, some went to the Trustees, Church-wardens, and Minister; and whilst I was waiting for an Answer, and the last Psalm singing, a Man came with a Wand in his Hand, whom I took for the proper Church-Officer, and told me I was to preach; I not doubting but the Minister was satisfied, followed him to the Pulpit: And GOD enabled me to preach with greater Power than I had done all the Day before.</P>
<P>After this, prayed with, and gave a Word or two of Exhortation to a Company that waited for me, then took a little bodily Refreshment, and then went to a Love-Feast in <HI>Fetter-lane,</HI> where I spent the whole Night in watching unto Prayer, and discussing several important Points with many truely Christian Friends. About Four in the Morning we went all together and broke Bread at a poor sick Sister's Room, and so we parted, I hope, in a Spirit not unlike that of the primitive Christians.</P>

<P><HI>Monday, February</HI> 5. Went about gathering for my poor Flock, had a little Time to write my Journal, was somewhat weak part of the Day, but grew strong by expounding to four Companies at Night. <HI>I always get Strength by working.

<P><HI>Tuesday, February</HI> 6. Was refreshed much this Morning, and found that the Sleep of a labouring Man was sweet. — Waited on the Bishop of <HI>Gloucester</HI> with Brother <HI>John Wesley,</HI> and received his Lordship's liberal Benefaction for <HI>Georgia.</HI></P>
<P>Went to St. <HI>Helen</HI>'s, where <HI>Satan</HI> withstood me grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.

<PB N="130" REF="004453_0129_100D9F7AE4E4CB30"/>
Courage to begin, and before I had done I waxed warm and strong in Spirit, and offered JESUS CHRIST freely to all that would lay hold on him by Faith. Many, I believe, were touched to the Quick: For they seemed to feel what was spoken, and said hearty and loud <HI>Amens</HI> to my Sentences. The Church was greatly thronged, and after I had done, Prayers were put up on all sides for my safe Journey and return. — <HI>Surely these are not curious Hearers! If they are, why do they follow more and mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e for such a Continuance? No, many Conversions have bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wrought in their Hearts. GOD has set his Seal to my Minist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and I trust they will be my Joy and Crown of Rejoycing in the Day of the Lord</HI> JESUS.— <HI>Oh the Riches of GOD's free Grace in</HI> CHRIST, <HI>to the Chief of Sinners! Oh that I fully felt the Sense of these Words!</HI></P>
<P>After this the People waited in great Com∣panies to see and follow me; but I got from them by going out at a back Door. <HI>Perhaps hereafter I may be let out in the same Manner to escape the Fury of mine Enemies. As my good GOD pleases.</HI></P>
<P>In coming along I perceived myself more and more strengthened, and was much comforted in reading a Letter sent me by an excellent Saint, who loves me in the Bowels of JESUS CHRIST. About Nine at Night I expounded with great Enlargement at <HI>Dowgate-hill</HI> to a most crouded Audience. Tongue cannot express what Power GOD <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave me, or how the Hearts of the poor P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>le were affected. They sighed and

mourned, and wept sorely, when I mentioned my Departure from t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em, though but for a Season. I exhorted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em particularly not to forsake the assembling themselves toget<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> not∣withstanding the People of the House had been threatned with a Prosecution. — But so far as our Opposers are permitted to go, shall they go, but no farther. I never was more opposed, never met with so great Success, never was filled with such a Portion of GOD's holy Spirit. — My dear Christian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riends waited, at my coming Home, to salu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.— GOD filled me with Love and Joy, and I waxed stronger and stronger in Spirit, to their and my own un∣speakable Comfort in CHRIST JESUS our LORD. <HI>All Love, all Glory be to the ever blessed Trinity, now and for evermore.</HI> Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, February</HI> 7. Spent the Morning in providing Things for my Journey, and taking leave of my dear Christian Friends, whom I love as my own Soul. — Had several Presents made me by such as GOD had worked upon by my Ministry; and after having prayed and sung Psalms in several Christian Houses, about Two I set out for <HI>Windsor,</HI> desiring to be thankful for those marvellous great Kindnesses GOD had shewn me in this City. I perceived my Heart so nearly knit to my dear Friends, that was it the Divine Will, I should gladly continue here. But I must go into every Place and City where I have been already, for therefore am I sent. <HI>LORD, send thy Angel before me to prepare my Way. But wherefore should I doubt, since so

<P>Got hither about Six in the Evening, and was joyfully received by several Christian Friends, who were waiting for me. — About Seven I was taken very ill indeed, but GOD strengthened me to go out, and I expounded with great Freedom and Power in the School-house to a great Num<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of People, who were apprised of my comi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and, I believe, <HI>felt</HI> what I spoke; for some wept, and many ex∣pressed their Thankfulness for my Exposition. <HI>Not unto me, O LORD, not unto me, but unto thy Name be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all the Glory.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Thursday, Feb.</HI> 8.

<P>Left <HI>Windsor</HI> about Ten in the Morning, dined at <HI>Bagshot,</HI> and reached <HI>Basingstoke</HI> at Five in the Evening. — Not meeting with our Friends, who were to come from <HI>Dummer,</HI> I wrote to some Christian Brethren I had left behind me, and afterwards was agreeably surprised by seve∣ral who came uninvited to see me. — After a little Conversation, I perceived they were desi∣rous to hear the Word of GOD, and being in a large Dining-room in the Publick House, I gave Notice I would expound to as many as would come. In a short Time I had above a Hun∣dred very attentive Hearers, to whom I expoun∣ded for above an Hour, for which they were very thankful. <HI>Blessed be</HI> GOD <HI>for this Oppor∣tunity.

<P><HI>Friday, Febr.</HI> 9. After Breakfast and Prayer with the Family where we lodged, I set out for <HI>Dummer</HI> (a Parish once for a little while under my Care) and met with near a Dozen Christian Brethren, with whom we took exceeding sweet Counsel, prayed, and sung Psalms, and eat our Bread with Gladness and Singleness of Heart. I wish all knew how chearful we, that are Be∣ginning to be Christians, live! And if the Be∣ginning be so sweet, What must the End of Be∣lieving be? <HI>Oh the Goodness of</HI> GOD <HI>in thus bringing me back to the Places where I have been already!</HI> LORD <HI>melt down my frozen Heart with a Sense of thy unmerited Love.</HI> Amen, Amen.</P>
<P>After having wrote several Letters, I returned with my Friends to <HI>Basingstoke,</HI> where I had appointed to expound. Accordingly, in the Evening I went to a large Room prepared for that Purpose, and expounded for an Hour. — The Place was very much thronged, many were very noisy, and others did us the Honour of throwing up Stones at the Windows. But I spoke so much the louder; being convinced some Good must come out from a Place where Oppo∣sition is. <HI>I should doubt whether I was a true Minister of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>was I not opposed. And I find it does me much Good. For it drives me nearer to my</HI> LORD <HI>and Master,</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>with whom I long to dwell.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="004453_0134_100D9F87A95E6888"/>After Exposition, near Twenty Friends came to visit me, and Two young Men in particular, (once Leaders of the religious Society, but since fallen back.) They came, I believe, with a Design to puzzle me about the Doctrine of Re∣generation; But alas, they soon shewed what Strangers they were to it. — For one was so full of Zeal, that he could not keep his Seat; and both were entirely ignorant of the Indwelling of the Spirit. One Thing they took Care to shew as much as possible, <HI>viz.</HI> That they had read the Fathers, (I suppose the <HI>English</HI> Translations) but at the same Time denied Experience in Re∣ligion. Poor Men! I pitied and told them, how they rested in Learning, falsly so called, while they were Strangers to the Power of Godliness in their Hearts. At last, finding no Probability of convincing them, and being called away to Supper, I and my Friends took our Leave in Love, with true Concern to see what an unhap∣py Spirit our Opposers are of. Afterwards we prayed for them, and endeavoured to bless GOD for making us to Triumph, through his dear SON, in every Place.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Febr.</HI> 10.

greatly to praise him, and to pray for my dear absent Brethren. — <HI>Indeed I love them in the Bowels of</HI> JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>About Four in the Afternoon we returned to <HI>Basingstoke,</HI> in order to expound. And near Three large Rooms were filled. — We expected ill Treatment ere we returned home, and some did begin to interrupt me: But GOD enabled me to speak with such irresistible Power, that they were quite struck dumb and confounded. — Many said, We will never oppose again. Others said they would follow me whithersoever I should go; and the Hearts of GOD's Chil∣dren, as well as my own, were filled with Joy unspeakable. — <HI>This Night, I hope, Salvation is come to this Place.</HI></P>
<P>After Exposition, many Christian Friends came to see me in a most affectionate Manner, and about Nine at Night we set out for <HI>Dummer.</HI> But no one can tell what Enlargement of Heart GOD gave me. — My Soul was full of inef∣fable Comfort and Joy in the Holy Ghost. — I poured out my Heart before the Throne of Grace as I rode by the Way, and felt the Spirit of GOD working in me mightily, and enabling me to intercede most earnestly for my dear Friends. LORD <HI>hear my Prayers, and let my Cry come unto thee.</HI> — In a short Time we reached <HI>Dummer,</HI> and after having taken a little Re∣freshment, I went to Bed full of Love, and re∣joycing for the great Things GOD had done for my Soul.</P>

me, and to hear the Word of GOD. — How thankful ought I to be to my dear Master for sending me hither! — A most beneficial and comfortable Meeting have I had with my dear Christian Friends; and many, I hope, will have Reason to bless GOD for what they have seen and heard. — A Vestry, I find, was called to stop my Proceedings, and I hear I am to be presented to the Diocesan. — Several Lies have been told in the News about my Preaching at <HI>St. Margaret</HI>'s last <HI>Sunday. — Blessed be</HI> GOD <HI>that I can rejoyce in these lower Marks of my Discipleship. — Wherever I go,</HI> GOD <HI>causeth me to triumph, knits the Hearts of his People most closely to me, and makes me more than Conqueror through his Love. — The Comforts I enjoy within are inexpressible; they have a great Effect upon my outward Man, and make me of a chearful Countenance; which recommends my Master's Service much. — Oh Free Grace in</HI> CHRIST JESUS.</P>

<P><HI>Tuesday, February</HI> 13.

<P><HI>Wednesday, February</HI> 14. After Family-Prayer, and giving a Word of Exhortation, I set out for <HI>Bath,</HI> and was greatly comforted there with some Christian Brethren. — I then waited on Dr. <HI>C—y,</HI> desiring I might have the Use of the Abbey Church to preach for the Orphan-house, the Trustees having obtained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eave of the Bishop before I went to <HI>Georgia.</HI> But he was pleased to give me an absolute Refusal to preach either on that, or any other Occasion, without a positive Order from the King or Bishop.

<P>After Dinner, other Circumstances concurring, we thought GOD called us to <HI>Bristol.</HI> And with Chearfulness of Heart, we reached that Place about Seven in the Evening. — But who can express the Joy with which I was received?

<P><HI>Thursday, February</HI> 15. Sat up till past one in the Morning answering my dear Friends Letters, having no Time otherwise.— Received a Letter from a dear Christian Brother, wherein were these Words,</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I was told that Mr. <HI>B—n</HI> said to Mr. <HI>C—h, I believe the Devil in Hell is in you all.</HI> Whitefield <HI>has set the Town on Fire, and now he is gone to kindle a Flame in the Country.</HI> Shocking Language for one who calls himself a Minister of the Gospel! But, my dear Friend, I trust this will not move you, unless it is to pity him, and pray the more earnestly that he may experience the Power of those Truths he is now opposing, and have the same Fire kindled in his Breast, against which he is now so much enraged. For I trust, I am persuaded, it is not a Fire of the Devil's kindling, but an holy Fire that has proceeded from the Holy and Blessed Spirit. Oh that such a Fire may not only be kindled, but blow up into a Flame all <HI>England,</HI> and all the World over!</P>
</LETTER>
<P>After having breakfasted and prayed with some religious Friends, I went with Mr. <HI>Seward</HI>
<PB N="142" REF="004453_0141_100D9F9926E20A60"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o public Worship: from thence to the Rev. Mr. <HI>G—s,</HI> Minister of <HI>St. Mary, Ratcliff,</HI> who, as I was informed, had promised to lend me his Church to preach in for the Orphan-house. But he, in effect, gave me a Refusal, telling me, <HI>that he could not lend his Church without a special Order from the Chancellor.</HI>— Upon this, I immediately waited on the Chancellor, to whom I had sent the Night before. — But he told me frankly,
<Q>that he would not give any positive Leave, neither would he prohibit any one that should lend me a Church; but he would advise me to withdraw to some other Place till he had heard from the Bishop, and not preach on that or any other Occasion.</Q>
I asked him his Reasons. He answered,
<Q>Why will you press so hard upon me? The Thing has given a general Dislike.</Q>
— I replied, <HI>Not the Design of the Orphan-house, — Even those that disagree with me in other Particulars, approve of that. And as for the Gospel, when was it preached without Dislike?</HI>" Soon after this, I took my leave, and waited upon the Reverend the Dean, who received me with great Civility. When I had shewn him my <HI>Georgia</HI> Accounts, and answered him a Question or two about the Colony, I asked him, <HI>Whether there could be any just Objection against my preaching in Churches for the Orphan-house?</HI>" — After a Pause for a considerable Time, he answered, "He could not tell." But somebody knocking at the Door, he replied,
<Q>Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> I will give you an Answer some other Time; now I expect
<PB N="143" REF="004453_0142_100D9F9B6F567FF0"/>
Company.</Q>
<Q>Will you be pleased to fix any, Sir? said I.</Q> <Q> I will send to you says the Dean.</Q>
<HI>O Christian Simplicity, whither art thou fled! Why do not the Clergy speak the Truth, that it is not against the Orphan-house but against me and my Doctrine, that their Enmity is levelled. Had another</HI> came <HI>in his own Name, him they would have received. — But do thou, O</HI> LORD, <HI>behold their Enmity, and grant unto me, and all thy despised Servants, that with all Boldness we may speak thy Word.</HI></P>
<P>About three in the Afternoon, GOD having given me great Favour in the Jaylor's Eyes, I preached a Sermon on the <HI>Penitent Thief</HI> to the poor Prisoners in <HI>Newgate,</HI> and collected fifteen Shillings for them. — Many seemed much affected, and I hope the Power of the LORD was present to awaken them.</P>
<P>At seven I expounded for an Hour with very great Power to a young Society, which GOD has caused to be established since I was in <HI>Bristol</HI> last: And many, I heard afterwards, were pricked to the Heart, which was manifest enough by the Tears that were shed by almost all that heard me. — <HI>Blessed be</HI> GOD <HI>the good Seed sown by my Ministry, though but as a Grain of Mustard-Seed, is now, being watered by the Dew of Heaven, beginning to grow into a great Tree. LORD this is thy doing, and it is marvellous in our Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>The Lessons were very remarkable, and the People made an Application for me. — The first was the Opposition mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> against <HI>Aaron'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
<PB N="144" REF="004453_0143_100D9F9E0B4FB4C8"/>
Priesthood, and GOD's determining who was in the right, by causing his Rod to blossom when the other Rods produced nothing. <HI>So let it happen, O LORD, to me thy unworthy Servant.</HI> — The second was the Eleventh Chapter of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s 2d Epistle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> where the Apostle recounted his Sufferings for CHRIST, against the Insinuations of the false Apostles. <HI>Blessed be GOD, in most of the Things there recorded, I have, in some small Degree, had F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llowship with the Apostle, and before I die, I doubt not but I shall sympathize with him in most other Articles.</HI>— While I was reading it, I could not forbear blushing much. The People were intent upon me, their Eyes bespoke the Lan∣guage of their Hearts: Each seemed to say, <HI>Thou art the Man. Suffering is the best Prefer∣ment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, Feb.</HI> 16. Begun this Morning to settle a daily Exposition, and reading Prayers to the Prisoners in <HI>Newgate.</HI> I opened it by enlarging on the Conversion of the Jailor, and I trust the same good Work will be experienced in this Prison before I leave it.</P>
<P>Dined with a religious Family, spent a consi∣derable Time in singing Hymns, and Prayer, visited and prayed with two choice Servants of our blessed LORD, and expounded from Five 'till near Nine, to two thronged Societies, one of which chiefly consisted of young Men whom GOD seems to have called to shine as Lights in the World, in a crooked and perverse Generation.—<HI>Oh how thankful ought I to be, for seeing these Frui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of my poor</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>!</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="004453_0144_100D9FA107DA21C0"/><HI>Saturday, February</HI> 17. Read Prayers and expounded the Parable of the Prodigal Son at <HI>Newgate,</HI> to a great Number of People; and afterwards was much refreshed by the coming of a dear <HI>London</HI> Friend, and the Receipt of several Letters; for the Writers of which, I with many others immediately kneeled down and gave Thanks. One Thing affected me much in their Letters, <HI>viz.</HI> Their News of a great Opposer's being given over by the Phy∣sicians. — <HI>Alas poor Man! We all prayed most heartily for him, knowing how shortly he must give an Account of what he had most unjustly said and wrote against me and many true Servants of</HI> JESUS CHRIST. <HI>Father lay not this Sin to his Charge.</HI></P>
<P>About One in the Afternoon I went with my Brother <HI>Seward,</HI> and another Friend, to <HI>Kings∣wood,</HI> and was most delightfully entertained by an old Disciple of the Lord.— My Bowels have long since yearned toward the poor Colliers, who, as far as I can find, are very numerous, and yet are as Sheep, having no Shepherd.— After Dinner therefore, I went upon a Mount and spake to as many People as came unto me. They were upwards of two Hundred.— <HI>Blessed be</HI> GOD, <HI>that I have now broke the Ice; I belie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e I never was more acceptable to my Master than when I was standing to teach those Heare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in the open Fields. — Some may censure me. — But if I thus pleased Men, I should not be the Servant of</HI> CHRIST.</P>
<P>About five, we returned full of Joy; and I wrote to the Bishop of <HI>Bristol</HI> (as I had done
<PB N="146" REF="004453_0145_100D9FA29CA9FB70"/>
before to the Bishop of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells</HI>) for Leave to preach in his Lordship's Churches, for the Benefit of the Orphan-house. <HI>May GOD incline him to send me an Answer of Peace!</HI></P>
<P>At seven, I went to expound to a Society of young Men for near two Hours, and then came home with my Friends, blessing and praising GOD.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, February</HI> 18. Arose this Morning about six, being called up by near fifty young Persons, whom I appointed to meet me at my Sister's House, and with whom I spent above an Hour in Prayer, Psalm-singing, and a warm Exhortation. — Soon after this, I read Prayers, and preached at <HI>Newgate</HI> to a large and very attentive Congregation. At Ten, I preached at <HI>St. Warburgh</HI>'s with great Freedom, and to a large Audience. — Blessed be GOD, I thought yesterday I should not have the Use of any Pulpit; but GOD, who has the Hearts of all Men in his Hands, disposed the Reverend Mr. <HI>Penrose</HI> to lend me his, who thanked me for my Sermon; and the Reverend Mr. <HI>Gibbs</HI> sent to me, and offered me the Use both of <HI>St. Thomas</HI> and <HI>St. Mary Ratcliff.</HI> — The latter of these I accepted of, and preached to such a Congregation as my Eyes never yet saw, with great Liberty and Demonstration of the Spirit. — Many went away for want of room; and Mr. <HI>Gibbs</HI> and his Lady were exceeding civil both to me and Mr. <HI>Seward.— The LORD reward them for this their Love.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="004453_0146_100D9FA629A79EB8"/>After Sermon, and taking a little Refreshment, I hasted to a Society in <HI>Baldwin-street,</HI> where many Hundreds were assembled to hear me, so that the Stairs and Court below, besides the Room itself, were crowded. — Here I continued expounding for near two Hours. And then expounded for as long a Time at another Society in <HI>Nicholas-street,</HI> equally thronged, but with much greater Power. <HI>Surely, that same</HI> JESUS <HI>that came to his Disciples, the Doors being shut, when they assembled together, was with us of a Truth:</HI> For great Numbers were quite melted down, and GOD so caused me to renew my Strength, that I was better when I returned home, than when I began to exhort my young Fellow-soldiers at six in the Morning. <HI>I could not do this, except</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>did strengthen me. By his free Grace alone, I am what I am▪ Not unto me, but unto thy Name, O LORD, alone be all the Glory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, February</HI> 19. Read P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ayers and expounded as usual at <HI>Newgate,</HI> and preached in the Afternoon to a great Multitude at the Parish Church of <HI>St. Philip</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> and collected Eighteen Pounds for the Orphan-house. — Thousands went away, because there was no room for them within; and GOD enabled me to read Prayers and preach with great Boldness. — <HI>See ye not, ye opposers, how you prevail nothing? Why do you not believe that it would not be thus, unless</HI> GOD <HI>was with me? LORD, open thou their Eyes, that they may see that this is thy doing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="004453_0147_100D9FAA11B60EC0"/>About Six in the Evening I went to a new Society greatly thronged, and was enabled, notwithstanding I had exerted myself so much at <HI>St. Philip</HI>'s, to expound with great Freedom of Spirit for above an Hour. — Thence I went and expounded for near the space of two Hours to another Society in <HI>Baldwin-street,</HI> and much Power from above was amongst us. This done, I returned home full of Joy, which was kept up by conversing, singing and praying with many Christian Brethren. — We parted, re∣joycing that GOD caused us to go on from conquering, and to conquer.</P>
<P>Amongst the Letters I received from religiou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Correspondents, one writes to me thus,— <Q>Mr.—, who wrote that Letter in the Miscellany, died yesterday.</Q>
<HI>He is now gone to give an Account of the many hard Speeches contained therein. — And is convinced that Orthodoxy in Notions is not the whole of Religion.</HI>— In another Part of his Letter he writes thus,
<Q>We had such a remar∣kable and sensible Presence of GOD with us at <HI>Beech-lane</HI> this Evening, as my Eyes and Ears were never such Witnesses of before. In the midst of Mr. <HI>John Wesley</HI>'s Exposition, a Woman present had such Convictions of her lost Estate by Nature, and such a sense of Sin, that she could not forbear crying out aloud; upon which Mr. <HI>Wesley,</HI> breaking off, went to her, who earnestly desired him to pray for her, which he did in the Presence of 2 or 300 People, hardly one of whom, I think, could forbear Tears, upon which she had Comfort.</Q>
<PB N="149" REF="004453_0148_100D9FABA16B11A8"/>
<HI>Blessed be</HI> GOD, <HI>the more we are despised, the more he shews that we are Teachers sent by him. For no one could do these Things, except</HI> GOD <HI>was with him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, Feb.</HI> 20. This Day my Master honoured me more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ever he did yet.— About Ten in the Morning, in Compliance with a Summons received from the <HI>Apparator</HI> yesterday, I waited upon the Rev. Mr. <HI>R—l,</HI> the Chan∣cellor of <HI>Bristol,</HI> who now plainly told me, he intended to stop my Proceedings. — <HI>I have sent for the Register here, Sir,</HI> says he, <HI>to take down your Answer.</HI> Upon which he asked me by what Authority I preached in the Diocese of <HI>Bristol,</HI> without a Licence. I answered, I thought that Custom was grown obsolete: And why, pray Sir, replied I, did not you ask the <HI>Irish</HI> Clergyman this Question, who preached for you last <HI>Thursday?</HI> He said that was nothing to me. — He then read over Part of the Ordi∣nation-Office, and those Canons that forbid any Minister preaching in a private House, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>— And then he asked me what I said to them? I answered, that I apprehended those Canons did not belong to professed Ministers of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> — But he said they did. — There is also a Canon, said I, Sir, forbidding all Clergyman to frequent Taverns and play at Cards; why is not that put in Execution? Why does not somebody complain of them, says he, and then it would. — When I asked him why I was thus taken particular Notice of, (referring to my printed Discourses for my Principles) He
<PB N="150" REF="004453_0149_100D9FAD71983E48"/>
said, I preached false Doctrine. Upon which I answered him not a Word, but told him, notwithstanding those Canons, I could not but speak the Things that I knew, and was resolved to proceed as usual. — <HI>Observe his Answer then,</HI> sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he, <HI>Mr. Register.</HI> — And turning to me, added, <HI>I am resolved, Sir, if you preach or ex∣pound any where in this Diocese, till you have a Licence, I will first suspend, and then excommunicate you.</HI> — I then took my leave. — He waited upon me very civilly to the Door, and told me, <HI>What he did was in the Name of the Clergy and Laity of the City of</HI> Bristol.— And so we parted.</P>
<P>Being taken ill, just before I went to the Chancellor, in my Return home, I found I had not so much Joy as Peace. But however, I did not perceive the least Motion of Resentment to arise in my Heart. And to show how little I regarded such Threatnings, after I had joyned in Prayer for the Chancellor, I immediately went and expounded at <HI>Newgate</HI> as usual; where GOD gave me great Joy, and wonderously pricked many to the Heart, as though he would say, <HI>This is the Way, walk in it.</HI> — After this we dined with several Christian Friends with the kind Keeper of the Prison, and rejoyced ex∣ceedingly at the Thoughts, that we should one Day or other sing together in such a Place as <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> did. — GOD <HI>prepare us for that Hour. For I believe it will come. I shall be exalted, I must be humbled.</HI></P>
<P>At four there was a general Expectation of my preaching at <HI>St. Nicholas</HI>; thousands wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="151" REF="004453_0150_100D9FAFD0DB1BF8"/>
to hear me. — But the Lecturer sent Word, that Orders were given by Mr. <HI>B—r,</HI> that I should not preach in his Church; which rejoyced me greatly. <HI>Lord, why dost thou thus honour me?</HI></P>
<P>At five I went and expounded on the first of <HI>St. James,</HI> to a Christian Assembly indeed, who were much affected. — And afterwards I hasted to <HI>Nicholas-street,</HI> where was a great Crowd waiting for me upon the Stairs, Yard and Entry of the House, as well as in the Room itself. — I expounded the ninth of <HI>St. John,</HI> exhorted all to imitate the poor Beggar, and not to fear the Face of Men. — GOD was pleased to fill me with unspeakable Joy and Power. — All were wonderously touched, and when after my Expo∣sition I prayed particularly for the Chancellor, the whole Company was drowned in Tears, and said most earnest <HI>Amens</HI> to all the Petitions I put up for him. — It is remarkable, we have not had such a continued Presence of GOD amongst us, as we have had since I was threatned to be excommunicated. <HI>But thus it was formerly, so it will be now. When we are cast out,</HI> CHRIST <HI>will more clearly reveal himself to us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, Feb.</HI> 21. Had several come to me this Morning, to enquire about the State of their Souls, amongst whom was a little Girl of thir∣teen Years of Age, who told me in great Sim∣plicity, <HI>She was pricked through and through with the Power of the Word.</HI> And indeed a good Work, I believe, has been wrought in her Heart. <HI>Out of the Mouths of Babes and Suck∣lings hast thou perfected Praise.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="004453_0151_100D9FB3D5F66020"/>Preached at <HI>Newgate</HI> with uncommon Free∣dom and Power, and observed the Audience to be quite melted down, After this I made a Collection for the poor Prisoners, and at my Return home was much comforted by another gracious Soul, whom GOD brought unto me, and who was willing to follow me not only to <HI>Georgia,</HI> but also to Prison and to Death.</P>
<P>At three in the Afternoon, according to my Appointment, I went to <HI>Kingswood</HI> amongst the Colliers. GOD highly favoured us in sending a fine Day, and near two Thousand People were assembled on that Occasion. I preached on <HI>John</HI> ch. iii. ver. 3. and enlarged for near an Hour, I hope, to the Comfort and Edification of those that heard me. <HI>GOD grant the Seed sown may not fall on stony or thorny, but on good Ground.</HI></P>
<P>About six in the Evening, I expounded to a Society without <HI>Lawford's Gate,</HI> and afterwards to another in <HI>Baldwin-street</HI>; both were ex∣ceedingly crowded and attentive. At first I could not speak so strongly, because I had exerted myself so much upon the Mount; but after∣wards GOD gave me a fresh Supply of Grace, and I was enabled to go through my Work chearfully. <HI>Lo! I am with you always, even unto the End of the World.</HI></P>

<P>After Dinner, I was taken very ill, so that I was obliged to lie upon the Bed; but, looking upon it only as a Thorn in the Flesh, at three I went, according to Appointment, and preached to near four or five Thousand People, from a Mount in <HI>Kingswood,</HI> with great Power.

And, I think, he answered, he was to bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me. I then insisted on his proving I had preached false Doctrine, and reminded him of his threat∣ning to excommunicate me in the Name of the Clergy and Laity of the City of <HI>Bristol.</HI> But he would have me think that he had said no such Thing; and confessed, at this Time, that he had neither heard me preach, nor read any of my Writings. I asked him his Reasons for prohibiting my collecting for the Orphan-house. He answered, It would hinder the People's Benefactions to the <HI>Bristol</HI> Clergy. I replied, It would by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Means hinder their Contributions, and that the Clergy ought first to subscribe themselves for Example's Sake. — After much Conversation on this Subject, I, with all Meek∣ness, told him, I was resolved to go on preach∣ing, and that if Collections were not made here for the poor <HI>Georgians,</HI> I would lay it entirely upon him; adding withal, I would not be one that should hinder such a Design for the Universe.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="004453_0154_100D9FBB13ED8448"/>After I left the Chancellor, I went and preached at <HI>Newgate</HI>; and at three in the After∣noon, went to a Poor-house without <HI>Lawford's Gate</HI>; but the Room and Yard being full, I stood upon the Steps going up to the House, and preached to them from thence. Many that were passing along the Road on Horseback, stood still to hear me; and, I hope, many were bettered by what was spoken.</P>
<P>This Evening I declined going to any Society, that I might have a little Time to write Letters; amongst which, I wrote the following one to the Bishop of <HI>Bristol.</HI></P>

<P>I humbly thank your Lordship for the Favour of your Lordship's Letter. It gave abundant Satisfaction to me, and many others, who have not failed to pray in a particular Manner for your Lordship's Temporal and Eternal Welfare. — To day I shewed your Lorship's Letter to the Chancellor, who (notwithstanding he promised not to prohibit my preaching for the Orphan-house, if your Lordship was only neuter in the Affair) has influenced most of the Clergy to deny me their Pulpits, either on that or any other Occasion. Last Week he was pleased to charge me with false Doctrine, To day he has forgot that he said so. — He also threatned to excommunicate me for preaching in your Lordship's Diocese. I offered to take a Licence, but was denied. — If your Lordship should ask, What Evil I have done? I answer▪ None, save that I visit the

Religious Societies, preach to the Prisoners in <HI>Newgate,</HI> and to the poor Colliers in <HI>Kings∣wood,</HI> who they tell me, are little better than Heathens. — I am charged with being a Dissenter; though many are brought to the Church by my preaching, not one taken from it. — Indeed the Chancellor is pleased to tell me my Conduct is contrary to the Canons; but I told him those Canons which he produced were not intended against such Meetings as mine are, where his Majesty is constantly prayed for, and every one is free to see what is done. I am sorry to give your Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dship this Trouble; but I thought proper to mention these Particulars, that I might know of your Lordship wherein my Conduct is ex∣ceptionable. I heartily thank your Lordship for your intended Benefaction. — I think the Design is truly good, and will meet with Suc∣cess, because so much opposed. GOD knows my Heart, I desire only to promote his Glory. If I am spoken evil of for his sake I rejoyce in it. My Master was long since spoken evil of before me. — But I intrude on your Lord∣ship's Patience. — I am, with all possible Thanks,</P>

<P><HI>Sunday, Feb.</HI> 25. What Mercies has my good GOD shewn me this Day! When I arose in the Morning, I thought I should be able to do nothing; but the divine Strength was greatly magnified in my Weakness. — About Six in the
<PB N="157" REF="004453_0156_100D9FBFA67FD5C0"/>
Morning I prayed, sung with, and exhorted my young Morning Visiters, as I did last Lord's Day. — At Eight I read Prayers, and preached to a very thronged Congregation at <HI>Newgate,</HI> and from thence I rode to <HI>Bussleton,</HI> a Village about two Miles from <HI>Bristol,</HI> where was such a vast Congregation, that after I had read Prayers in the Church, I thought proper to go and preach in the Churchyard, that none might be sent em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty away. — The People were exceedingly at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ntive, and GOD gave me great Utterance; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d what was best of all, by the Leave of the Minister, who invited me thither, we had a S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crament; and, I hope, it was a Communion of Saints indeed. <HI>All Things, I find, happen to the Furtherance of the Gospel; Why then should I fear what Man can do unto me?</HI></P>
<P>At four I hasted to <HI>Kingswood.</HI> — At a mo∣derate Computation, there were above ten Thousand People to hear me. The Trees and Hedges were full. All was hush when I began; the Sun shone bright, and GOD enabled me to preach for an Hour with great Power, and so loud, that all (I was told) could hear me. Blessed be GOD, Mr. <HI>B—n</HI> spoke right. <HI>The Fire is kindled in the Country; and, I know, all the Devils in Hell shall not be able to quench it.</HI></P>
<P>Finding myself strengthened from above, I went and expounded at <HI>Baldwin-street</HI> Society. when above five Pounds were collected for the Orphan-house. — Afterwards I went to another; and about Nine at Night came home, rejoycing at the great Things GOD had done for my Soul.

<P>Our Lord's Hand is not shortned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mongst us. Yesterday I preached at <HI>St. Katharines,</HI> and at <HI>Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ington,</HI> where the Church was almost as hot as some of the Society Rooms used to be. I think I never was so much strengthened before. The Fields, after Service, were white with People praising GOD. About three Hundred were present at Mr. <HI>S—s</HI>; thence I went to Mr. <HI>B—s,</HI> then to <HI>Fetter-lane,</HI> and at nine to Mr. <HI>B—s</HI>; where also we only wanted room. — Today I expound in the <HI>Minories</HI> at four, at Mrs. <HI>W—s</HI> at six, and to a large Company of poor Sinners in <HI>Gravel-lane (Bishopsgate)</HI> at eight. The Society at Mr. <HI>Crouch</HI>'s does not meet till eight; so that I expound before I go to him near <HI>St. James's</HI> Square; where one young Woman has been lately filled with the Holy Ghost, and overflows with Joy and Love. On <HI>Wednesday</HI> at six, we have a noble Company of Women, not adorned with Gold or costly Apparel, but with a meek and quiet Spirit, and good Works.— At the <HI>Savoy,</HI> on
<PB N="160" REF="004453_0159_100D9FC710EDE0A8"/>
<HI>Thursday</HI> Evening, we have usually two or three hundred, most of them, at least, throughly awakened. Mr. <HI>A</HI>—'s Parlour is more than filled on <HI>Friday,</HI> as is Mr. <HI>P</HI>—'s Room twice over; where, I think, I have commonly had more Power given me than at any other Place. A Week or two ago a Note was given me there, as near as I can remember in these Words, <HI>Your Prayere are desired for a sick Child that is lunatick, and sore vexed Day and Night, that our Lord would heal him, as he did those in the Days of his Flesh; and that he would give his Parents Faith and Patience till his Time is come.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Saturday</HI> Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ennight, a middle aged, well dressed Woman at <HI>Beech-lane,</HI> (where I expound usually to five or six Hundred before I go to Mr. <HI>E</HI>—'s Society) was seized, as it appeared to several about her, with little less than the Agonies of Death. We prayed that GOD, who had brought her to the Birth, would give her Strength to bring forth, and <HI>That he would work speedily, that all might see it, and fear, and put their Trust in the LORD.</HI> Five Days she travailed and groaned, being in Bondage. On <HI>Thursday</HI> Evening our Lord got himself the Victory; and, from that Moment, she has been full of Love and Joy, which she openly declared at the same Place, on <HI>Saturday</HI> last; so that Thanksgivings also were given to GOD by many on her Account. It is to be observed, her Friends have accounted her mad for these three Years; and accordingly

<P>The Weather being fair, after I had preached and collected Thirty seven Shillings at <HI>Newgate,</HI> I went on the Mount at <HI>Kingswood</HI>; where, about fifteen hundred Colliers and Country People were gathered together, and were very attentive to hear me. Blessed be GOD I preached with Power, and have reason to believe, by what I have heard, that my Words have not altogether fallen to the Ground. Some of the Colliers, I find, have been much affected. <HI>Blessed be GOD.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Saturday, March</HI> 3. Returned before ten to <HI>Bristol,</HI> was greatly refreshed by a Packet of Letters from <HI>London.</HI> Expounded with great Power at <HI>Newgate,</HI> and preached in the After∣noon on the Steps before the Poor-house without <HI>Lawford's Gate,</HI> and perceived my Audience much increased since last <HI>Saturday. Blessed be GOD, many went affected away.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, March</HI> 4. Rose much refreshed in Spirit, and gave my early Attendants a warm Exhortation as usual. Went to <HI>Newgate,</HI> and preached with great Power to an exceedingly thronged Congregation. Then hasted to <HI>Hannam Mount,</HI> three Miles from the City, where the Colliers live altogether. GOD highly favoured us in the Weather. Above four Thousand were ready to hear me; and GOD enabled me to preach with the Demonstration of the Spirit. The Ground not being high enough, I stood upon a Table, and the Sight of the People covered the green Fields, and their deep Atten∣tion pleased me much. <HI>I hope that same LORD who fed so many Thousands with bodily Bread,
<PB N="163" REF="004453_0162_100D9FCE9479D628"/>
will feed all their Souls with that Bread which cometh down from Heaven: For many came from far.</HI></P>
<P>At four in the Afternoon, I we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to the Mount on <HI>Rose-green,</HI> and preached to above fourteen Thousand Souls; and so good was my GOD, that all could hear. I think it was worth while to come many Miles to see such a Sight.— I spoke, blessed be GOD, with great Freedom; but thought all the while) as I do continually when I ascend the Mount, That hereafter I shall suffer as well as speak for my Master's Sake. <HI>LORD, strengthen me against that Hour. LORD, I believe (O help my Unbelief! that thy Grace will be more than suf∣ficient for me.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening I expounded at <HI>Baldwin-street</HI> Society, but could not get up to the Room without the utmost Difficulty, the Entry and Court were so much thronged. <HI>Blessed be</HI> GOD, <HI>the Number of Hearers much increases; and as my Day is, so is my Strength.</HI> To Night I returned home much more refreshed in my Spirits than in the Morning when I went out. <HI>I was full of Joy, and longed to be dissolved, and to be with</HI> JESUS CHRIST; <HI>but I have a a Baptism first to be baptized with.

<P><HI>Monday, March</HI> 5. Had the Pleasure of having many, whom GOD has touched by my Ministry, come to me, enquiring about the <HI>New Birth.</HI> At eleven, I preached with

uncommon Freedom and Power at <HI>Newgate,</HI> and collected Thirty-nine Shillings for the poor Prisoners; and being invited by many Colliers, at three in the Afternoon I went to a Place called the <HI>Fishponds,</HI> on another Side of <HI>Kings∣wood,</HI> where about two Thousand were gathered together. The Sight pleased me much; and having no better Place to stand upon, the Wall was my Pulpit, and, I think, I never spoke with greater Power. <HI>My preaching in the Fields may displease some timorous bigotted Men; but I am throughly persuaded it pleases GOD, and why should I fear any Thing else.</HI></P>
<P>At my Return home, I was much refreshed with the Sight of two pious Friends. After some Conversation, they went with me to a Society, where I prayed and expounded for above an Hour, and then spent the Remainder of the Evening with them and many other Christian Brethren, in warming one anothers Hearts by mutual Exhortation, and singing of Psalms. <HI>Oh that Sensualists knew the Pleasure of a religious Conversation! I am sure they would no longer eat Husks with Swine, but return home to feed on the fatted Calf.</HI></P>

<HEAD>NEW PASSAGE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Tuesday, March</HI> 9. Having left my dear Brother <HI>Hutchins,</HI> whom I sent to for that Purpose, to supply my Place during my Absence; after many kind Salutations, Psalms and Prayers on both Sides, Mr. <HI>Seward,</HI> myself, and another Brother, took Leave of our <HI>Bristol</HI> Friends, and
<PB N="165" REF="004453_0164_100D9FD3069A6630"/>
got to the <HI>New Passage</HI> in a short Time. Here we staid and refreshed ourselves, and endeavoured to go off in the Boat about Noon; but the Wind not permitting us, we took this Oppor∣tunity of writing to many of our Christian Friends, and exhorting them to lay hold on JESUS CHRIST by Faith.</P>
<P>At the Inn where we put up there was an unhappy Clergyman, who (so far had his Corruptions dominion over him) would not go over in the Passage-Boat because I went in it. <HI>Alas!</HI> thought I, <HI>this very Temper would make Heaven itself unpleasant to that Man, if he save me there.</HI> I was likewise told, that in the publick Kitchin, he charged me with being a Dissenter; when a little after, as I passed by, I saw him shaking his Elbows over a Gaming-table. <HI>I heartily wish those who charge me causelesly with Schism, and being righteous over-much, would consider that the Canon of our Church forbids our Clergy to frequent Taverns, to play at Cards or Dice, or any other unlawful Games. Their indulging themselves in these Things, is a stumbling Block to Thousands.</HI></P>
<P>After Supper, in the Evening, I called the Family of the Inn together, and was pleased to see near twenty come to hear the Word. GOD enabled me to speak and pray with Power, and having dispersed some Extracts from our Church Homilies amongst them, I and my Friends went early to Bed, being apprized that we were to be called up betimes. <HI>Blessed be GOD, for any Opportunity of doing good.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CARDIFF.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Wednesday, March</HI> 8. Arose before twelve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Night, sung Psalms, and prayed; and the Wind being fair, we had a speedy Passage over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Welch</HI> Shore. Our Business being in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aste, GOD having of his good Providence, sent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to guide us, we rode all Night, stopped at <HI>Newport</HI> to refresh ourselves, where we met with two Friends, and reached <HI>Cardiff</HI> about eleven. in the Morning.</P>
<P>The Town, I soon found, was apprehensive of my coming; and therefore, whilst I was giving a Word of Exhortation to some poor People at the Inn, who hanged upon me to hear the Word, Mr. <HI>Seward</HI> went to ask for the Pulpit? but being denied, we pitched on the Town-Hall, which Mr. <HI>Seward</HI> got by his Interest; and at four in the Afternoon, I preached from the Judges Seat to about four hundred Hea∣rers. Most were very attentive; but some mocked: However, I offered JESUS CHRIST freely even to them, and should have rejoyced if they would have accepted of him; but their foolish Hearts were hardned. <HI>LORD, make them Monuments of thy free Grace.</HI></P>
<P>After I came from the Seat, I was much refreshed with the Sight of my dear Brother <HI>Howel Harris</HI>; whom, though I knew not in Person, I have long since loved in the Bowels of JESUS CHRIST, and have often felt my Soul drawn out in Prayer in his Behalf.</P>
<P>A burning and shining Light has he been in those Parts; a Barrier against Prophaneness and
<PB N="167" REF="004453_0166_100D9FD7B714E038"/>
Immorality, and an indefatigable Promoter of the true Gospel of JESUS CHRIST. About three or four Years GOD has inclined him to go about doing good. He is now above Twenty five Years of Age. Twice he has applied (being every Way qualified) for holy Orders; but was refused, under a false Pretence, that he was not of Age, though he was then Twenty-two Years and six Months. About a Month ago he offered himself again, but was put off. Upon this, he was, and is still resolved to go on in his Work; and indefatigable Zeal has he shewn in his Master's Service. For these three Years (as he told me from his own Mouth) he has discoursed almost twice every Day for three or four Hours together; not authoritatively, as a Minister; but as a private Person, exhorting his Christian Brethren. He has been, I think, in seven Counties, and has made it his Business to go to Wakes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to turn People from such lying Vanities. Many Ale-house People, Fidlers, Harpers, <HI>&amp;c. (Demetrius</HI> like) sadly cry out against him for spoiling their Business. He has been made the Subject of Numbers of Sermons, has been threatned with publick Prosecutions, and had Constables sent to apprehend him. But GOD has blessed him with inflexible Courage: Instantaneous Strength has been communicated to him from above; and he still continues to go on from conquering to conquer. He is of a most Catholic Spirit, loves all that love our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and therefore he is stiled by Bigots, <HI>a Dissenter.</HI> He is contemned by all
<PB N="168" REF="004453_0167_100D9FDBCD80D538"/>
that are Lovers of Pleasure more than Lovers of GOD▪ but GOD has greatly blessed his pious Endeav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs. Many call, and own him as their spiritual Father, and, I believe, would lay down their Lives for his Sake. He discourses generally in a Field; but at other Times in a House, from a Wall, a Table, or any Thing else. He has established near thirty Societies in <HI>South-Wales,</HI> and still his Sphere of Action is en∣larged daily. <HI>He is full of Faith, and the Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P>When I first saw him, my Heart was knit closely to him. I wanted to catch some of his Fire, and gave him the right Hand of Fellow∣ship with my whole Heart. After I had saluted him, and given a warm Exhortation to a great Number of People, who followed me to the Inn, we spent the Remainder of the Evening in taking sweet Counsel together, and telling one another what GOD had done for our Souls. My Heart was still drawn out towards him more and more. A divine and strong Sympathy seemed to be between us, and I was resolved to promote his Interest with all my Might. Ac∣cordingly we took an Account of the several Societies, and agreed on such Measures as seemed most conducive to promote the common Interest of our Lord. <HI>Blessed be GOD, there seems to be a noble Spirit gone out into</HI> Wales; <HI>and I believe, e'er long there will be more visible Fruits of it. What inclines me strongly to think so is, that the Partition Wall of Bigotry and Party Zeal is broken down, and Ministers and Teachers of different
<PB N="169" REF="004453_0168_100D9FDD6977EFB0"/>
Communions, joyn with one Heart and one Mind to carry on the Kingdom of</HI> JESUS CHRIST. — <HI>The LORD make all the Christian World thus minded. For till this is done, I fear, we must despair of any great Reformation in the Church of GOD.</HI> — After much comfortable and encouraging Discourse with each other, we kneeled down and prayed, and great Enlargement of Heart GOD was pleased to give me in that Duty.</P>
<P>This done, we eat a little Supper, and then, after singing a Hymn, we went to Bed, praising and blessing GOD, for bringing us Face to Face. I doubt not but <HI>Satan</HI> envied our Happiness. But, I hope, by the Help of GOD we shall make his Kingdom shake. GOD <HI>loves to do great Things by weak Instruments, that the Power may be of GOD, and not of Man.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, March</HI> 9. Was much refreshed by last Night's Rest, and spent the Beginning of the Morning in Prayer and private Discourse with the Members of the Religious Society. About ten, according to Appointment, I went to the Town-hall, and preached for about an Hour and a Half to a large Assembly of People. My dear Brother <HI>Howel Harris</HI> sat close by me. I did not observe any S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs within; but without, some were pleased to honour me so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as to trail a dead Fox, and hunt it about the Hall. — But, blessed be GOD my Voice pre∣vailed. GOD gave me great Strength, and I could have have heartily wished all such Scoffers had been present, that I might have offered them
<PB N="170" REF="004453_0169_100D9FE02C219B80"/>
Salvation through JESUS CHRIST. This being done, I went, with many of my Hearers, amongst whom were two worthy dissenting Ministers, and my Brother <HI>Howel Harris,</HI> to public Worship; and in the second Lesson were these remarkable Words, <HI>And the High Priests, and the Scribes, and the Chief of the People sought to destroy him, but they could not find what they might do to him: For all the People were attentive to hear him.</HI></P>
<P>In the Afternoon, about four of the Clock▪ I preached again to the People without any Scoffing or Disturbance. And at six in the Evening, I talked for above an Hour and a half, and prayed with the religious Society, whose Room was quite thronged. Indeed GOD was with us of a Truth. I think I never spoke with greater Freedom and Power, and never saw a Congregation more melted down.

<P><HI>Monday, March</HI> 12. Went in Company with seven more dear Friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to <HI>Bath,</HI> and had the Comfort of meeting with some true Followers of JESUS CHRIST, whom I knew not before.

<P>Finding many in <HI>Bath</HI> were desirous to hear me, having given a short Notice, about five in the Evening I preached out on the Town-Common, to a much larger Audience than could reasonably be expected.— It snowed good Part of the Time; but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ople staid very con∣tentedly.

<P>After Sermon, I returned to our Inn, and spent the Remainder of the Evening in sweet Conversation with a great Number of experien∣ced Christians. My Heart was much enlarged in Prayer; and I can say, the Love of GOD was shed abroad abundantly therein. <HI>For ever adored be the Riches of his free Mercy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, March</HI> 13. Preached again at the <HI>Fish-ponds</HI> with great Power, and observed all to behave exceeding orderly.</P>
<P>Had extraordinary Power given me at the Society in <HI>Nicholas-street,</HI> and exhorted them with all possible Earnestness, not to let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igotry, or Party Zeal, be so much as mentioned among

<P><HI>Wednesday, March</HI> 14. Being forbid preaching in the Prison, and, withal, being resolved not to give place to my Adversaries, no not for an Hour, I preached at <HI>Baptist-Mills,</HI> a Place very near the City, to three or four Thousand People, from these Words, <HI>"What think you of Christ?" Blessed be</HI> GOD, <HI>all Things happen for the Fur∣therance of the Gospel.

<P><HI>Thursday, March</HI> 15.

But after Dinner, I hasted to <HI>Thorn∣bury,</HI> where I was invited also, and preached with uncommon Power to a great Part of my Morning Congregation, and many hundreds besides. Mr. <HI>Willis,</HI> the Incumbent, lent me the Church, and used me with great Civility, as did two other Clergymen who were there present. The People were very desirous to have me stay; but I had promised to lie at <HI>Winten∣burn,</HI> at a Quaker's House, where three more of their Friends met us, and with whom we had agreeable Conversation. But I cannot say their Arguments for omitting the outward Signs of Baptism, and the Lord's Supper, and for having no outward Call to the Ministry, were at all convincing: However, they wished me good Luck in the Name of the LORD, and we parted from each other very lovingly.

There were about 4 or 5000, of High and Low, Rich and Poor, to hear. As I went along, I observed many Scoffers; and when I got upon the Table to preach, many laughed; but before I had finished my Prayer, all was husht and silent; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r I had concluded my Discourse, GOD, by his Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, seemed to impress a great Awe upon their Mind; for all were deeply attentive, and seemed much

Dined with many Quakers at <HI>French-hay,</HI> who entertained me and my Friends with much Christian Love; but we could by no means agree about the Disuse of the two outward Signs in the Sacrament, nor of their absolute refusing to pay Tithes. — But I think their Notions about walking and being led by the Spirit are right and good. <HI>I should rejoyce to find all Quakers thus minded. Much Sincerity and Simplicity seems to be amongst them. — But I think, at the same Time, they insist so much upon the inward Life, they place too much Religion in their not using Externals.</HI></P>
<P>After Dinner, I went and preached at the <HI>Fish-ponds,</HI> as usual, where were many Coaches, and about as great a Number of People as before. GOD gave me great Freedom and Power. I was longer than common both in my Prayers and Sermon. — Many, I believe, were affected. — After I came home, I visited two Societies, where GOD was pleased to give us great Tokens of his Presence; and the Way up to the last Room was so exceedingly thronged that I was obliged to go up by a Ladder through the Window.</P>

with their Mites, that I wanted somebody to hold up my Hands. — The Chearfulness with which they gave is inexpressible, and the many Prayers they joined with their Alms, I hope, will lay a good Foundation for the House in∣tended to be built. — After this, GOD brought me to some more of his own dear Children, and I spent the Remainder of the Evening in ex∣pounding to a Society, where almost all were drowned in Tears, when I mentioned my De∣parture to them. — <HI>The good LORD, send some∣body amongst them to water what his own Right Hand hath planted.

<P><HI>Sunday, March</HI> 25.

But GOD put it into the Hearts of some Gentlemen to lend me a large Bowling-Green, where I preached to about five Thousand People, and made a Col∣lection for my poor Orphans, till my Hands were quite weary. — <HI>Blessed be</HI> GOD, <HI>that the Bowling-Green is turned into a Preaching-place. This, I hope, is a Token that Assembly-rooms and Play-houses will soon be put to the same Use. O may the Word of GOD be mighty to the pulling down of these strong Holds of the Devil! All that love our Lord</HI> JESUS, <HI>I am sure, will say,</HI> Amen.</P>
<P>Preached at <HI>Hannam</HI> to a larger Congregation than ever, and preached again in the Afternoon to upwards (as was computed) of 23000 People.

I was afterwards told, that those who stood farthest off could hear me very plainly. <HI>Oh may</HI> GOD <HI>speak to them by his Spirit, at the same Time that he enables me to lift up my Voice like a Trumpet!</HI></P>
<P>About eight I went to the Society in <HI>Nicholas-street,</HI> I with great Difficulty, at last got up into the Room, which was extreamly hot. GOD enabled me to speak with much Freedom and Power; and at the Close of my Exhortation, I recommended a Charity-school, which was opened by this Society to-day. I collected at the Door myself, and few passed by without throwing in their Mites. — <HI>Yet a little while, and I hope</HI> Bristol <HI>will be as famous for Charity schools as</HI> London. <HI>We must not despise the Day of small Things. Blessed be</HI> GOD, <HI>for the Strength of this Day. The Lord make me humbly thankful.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, March</HI> 26. Still GOD has pleased to give me fresh Tokens of his Love. Letters are sent me, and People come to me continually, telling me what GOD had done for their Souls by my unworthy Ministry.</P>
<P>At four in the Afternoon, I preached again at the <HI>Bowling-Green,</HI> to, I believe, seven or eight Thousand People. The Sun shone bright, and the Windows and Balconies of the adjoining Houses were filled with H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arers. I was un∣commonly enlarged in Prayer, and so carried out beyond myself in preaching, especially when I came to talk of the Love and free Grace of JESUS CHRIST, that I heartily wished it was in my Power that Moment to place all my Enemies
<PB N="184" REF="004453_0183_100DA0051DA8C9E8"/>
at the Right Hand of GOD. The Concern the People were in is inexpressible. — An hearty Groan goes through them all when any Thing affecting is spoken; and I am sure, that Thousands come not out of Curiosity, but a sincere Desire of being fed with the Milk of the Word — Afterwards, I again collected for the Orphan-house, and it was near an Hour and a half before the People could go out. Many were very faint because of the Throng, which was so exceeding great, that they trod one upon another.</P>
<P>At eight I hasted to <HI>Weavers Hall,</HI> in <HI>Temple-street,</HI> which was procured me because the Society Rooms were too little. I was almost faint before I could get in through the Croud; but GOD enabled me to speak with uncommon Freedom, and was with us of a Truth. — I believe there might be a thousand Hearers.— <HI>Well may the Devil and his Servants rage horri∣bly. Their Kingdom is in Danger.</HI></P>
<P>After I had done, I went to a Christian House, where many waited for me; and, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my Return home, my Master paid me my Wages: For my Soul was filled with an Intenseness of Love, and I knew what it is not only to have Righteous∣ness and Peace, but Joy in the Holy Ghost. <HI>This is my continual Food.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, March</HI> 27. At four this Afternoon, being invited several Times, I preached in a Yard belonging to the Glass-Houses, where many dwell, who (as I was informed) neither feared GOD, nor regarded Man. The Con∣gregation consisted of many Thousands, and
<PB N="185" REF="004453_0184_100DA00780B8AD58"/>
GOD enabled me to lay before them his Threat∣nings and Promises; so that none might either despair or presume. <HI>O that I may be t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ught of GOD rightly to divide the Word of Truth!</HI></P>
<P>Whilst I was preaching, I heard many People behind me, hollowing and making a Noise, and supposed they were set on by somebody on pur∣pose to disturb me.— I bless GOD I was not in the least moved, but rather increased the more in Strength; but when I had done, and enquired the Cause of that Noise, I was informed, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gentleman (being drunk) had taken the Liberty to call me <HI>Dog,</HI> and say, <HI>That I ought to be whipped at the Cart's Tail, and offered Money to any that would pelt me.</HI> Instead of that, the Boys and People near him began to cast Stones &amp; Dirt at him. —I knew nothing of it till afterwards, when I expressed my Dislike of their Behaviour, but could not help observing, <HI>what sorry Wages the Devil gives his Servants.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening I expounded again in <HI>Weavers Hall,</HI> to a most crouded and attentive Assembly. — People follow more and more. — There is a divine Attraction in the Word of GOD — <HI>Still draw us, O LORD, and we shall still come after thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, March</HI> 28. Had the Pleasure of hearing, that above an Hundred People set apart a Day for Prayer, in Behalf of me and my dear Brother <HI>Howel Harris,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>While our Friends thus continue to hold up their Hands, our spiritual</HI> Amaleck <HI>will never prevail against us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="004453_0185_100DA00944FC17B0"/>Preached in the Afternoon at <HI>Publow,</HI> a Vil∣lage about five Miles from <HI>Bristol,</HI> to severa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thousands of People. —The Church was offered; but being not sufficient to contain a third Part of the Audience, by the Advice of Friends I preached in the Fields; which put me in mind of our Lord's saying, <HI>Go out into the Highways and Hedges and compel them to come in.</HI></P>
<P>Was blessed with two excellent Letters. Found out some more of God's secret ones. — Received some temporal Mercies, expounded to a Society in <HI>Baldwin-Street,</HI> and went to a Friend's House, where we eat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bread with Gladness and Singleness of Heart. <HI>Oh the Comforts of a spiritual Life!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, March</HI> 29. Blessed be God, I hope a good Work is begun to Day.— Having had several Notices that the Colliers of <HI>Kings∣wood</HI> were willing to subscribe, I went to Din∣ner with them near a Place called <HI>Two Mile Hill,</HI> and collected about twenty Pounds in Mo∣ney, and got above Forty Pounds in Subscrip∣tions towards building them a Charity-School. — It was surprizing to see with what Cheerfulness they parted with their Money on this Occasion.— Was I to continue here, I would endeavour to settle Schools all over the Wood, as also in other Places, as Mr. <HI>Griffith Jones</HI> has done in <HI>Wales.</HI>— But I have but just Time to set it on Foot.— <HI>I hope God will bless the Ministry of my honoured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riend Mr.</HI> John Wesley, <HI>and enable him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing it to good Effect. — It is a Pity so many little ones as there are in</HI> Kingswood, <HI>should perish

for Lack of Knowledge.—Stir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>up thy Power, O Lord, and come amongst them, for the Sake of</HI> JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>After Dinner I preached a farewel Sermon, and recommended the Charity-School to their Consideration; and they all seemed willing to assist either by their Money or their Labour, and to offer such Things as they had, <HI>I doubt not but the Lord will prosper this Work of my Hands upon me.</HI></P>
<P>Assoon as I came to Town, I took my leave of a Society in <HI>Castle-street</HI>; — but Tongue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nnot express the Sorrow they were in at the mention of my Departure. — After this, I did the same at a Society in <HI>Nicholas-street</HI>; and, I believe, for near an Hour, they wept aloud and sorely all over the Room, as though they were mourning for the Death of their First-born. — <HI>Oh how close are their Hearts knit to me! Blessed be God, there is one coming after me, who, I hope, will cherish the Spark of divine Love now kindled in their Hearts, till it grows into a Flame.</HI> Amen, LORD JESUS.</P>
<P><HI>Friday, March</HI> 30. Preached this Afternoon near <HI>Colepit Heath,</HI> seven Miles from <HI>Bristol,</HI> a Place to which I was earnestly invited, and where great Numbers of Colliers live. — I be∣lieve there were above two thousand People assembled on this Occasion. — The Weather was exceeding fair, the Hearers behaved very well, and the Place where I preached being near the <HI>Maypole,</HI> I took Occasion to warn them of mispending their Time in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evelling and dancing.
<PB N="188" REF="004453_0187_100DA00D438BDA28"/>
<HI>Oh that all such<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntertainments were put a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>op to! I see no other Way to effect it, but by go∣ing boldly, and calling People from such lying Va∣nities in the Name of</HI> JESUS CHRIST. — <HI>That Reformation which is brought about by a coercive Power, will be only outward and superficial; but that which is done by the Force of God's Word, will be i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ward and lasting. Lord make me meet by thy Grace for such a Work, and then send me. Lo! I come to do thy Will.</HI></P>
<P>About seven I returned to <HI>Bristol,</HI> and took Leave of the Society without <HI>Lawford</HI>'s <HI>Gate</HI>; but there were so many People, that I was ob∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged to stand and expound at the Window, that those in the Yard (which was full) might hear also.— <HI>Their Hearts were ready to burst with Grief; but I hope my dear Master will come and comfort them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, March</HI> 31. Went this Morning, and visited the poor Man who was misused at the Glass Houses. He seemed much concerned for what he had done, and confessed he knew not what he did: Upon which, I took Occasion to dissuade him from the Sin of Drunkenness, and parted from him very friendly.</P>
<P>At eleven, I went and gave the Prisoners a farewel Exhortation, and left Orders concerning the Distribution of the Money that had been collected for them.—At four I preached, as usual, at the Poor-house, where was a greater Congre∣gation than ever, and very near nine Pounds gathered for the Orphan-house.—<HI>Blessed be God, the longer I stay, the more my Hearers increase.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Saturday, April</HI> 1. Preached at the <HI>Bowling-Green, Hannam,</HI> and <HI>Rose-Green</HI>; at all which Places, the Congregations were much enlarged, especially at the latter. There were Twenty-four Coaches, and an exceeding great Number of other People, both on Foot and Horseback. The Wind was not so well set to carry the Voice as usual; but however, I was strengthened to cry aloud, and take my last Farewel.—As I was returning home, it comforted me exceedingly, to hear almost every one blessing me, and wishing me a good Voyage in the Name of the Lord.—And indeed my Heart is so knit to <HI>Bristol</HI> People, that I could not with so much Submission leave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> did I not know dear Mr. <HI>Wesley</HI> was left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to teach them the Way of God more perfectly. <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sper, O Lord, the Works of his Hands upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im.</HI></P>

<P><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onday, April</HI> 2.

<P>About one, I was obliged to force myself away. — Crowds were waiting at the Door to give me a last F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rewel, and near twenty Friends accompanied me on Horseback. <HI>Blessed be God for the marvellous great Kindness he hath shewn me in this City.</HI> Many Sinners I believe, hath been effectually converted. It is unknown what Numbers have come to me under Convic∣tions, and all the Children of God have been exceedingly comforted. — Various Presents were sent me as Tokens of their Love. — Several thousands of little Books have been dispersed among the People; about two hundred Pounds collected for the Orphan-house, and many poor Families relieved by the Bounty of my Friend Mr. <HI>Seward.</HI> — And what gives me the greater Comfort, is the Consideration, that my dear and honoured Friend Mr. <HI>Wesly</HI> is left behind to con∣firm those that are awakened; so that when I return from <HI>Georgia,</HI> I hope to see many bold Soldiers of JESUS CHRIST. <HI>Grant this, O Lord, for the same thy dear Son's Sake.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Thursday, April</HI> 5. Spent some Time very comfortably with my dear Friends at <HI>Pontypool,</HI> in singing, praying, and religious Conferences; and then, in Company with about thirty on Horseback, I came to <HI>Abergavenny,</HI> ten Miles from <HI>Pontypool,</HI> by eleven in the Morning. — All the Way as we journeyed, GOD strengthned me mightily in the inner Man, and I could think of nothing so much as <HI>Joshua</HI> going from City to City, and subduing the devoted Nations. — Here I expected much Opposition, having been informed, that many intended to disturb me.</P>
<P>But GOD impressed a divine Awe upon all; so that though there were many Opposers present when I preached, yet not any dared to utter a Word. — GOD caused me to speak with ex∣traordinary Authority, and I did not spare the polite Scoffers in the least. <HI>Oh that they may come to the Knowledge of the Truth, and be saved!</HI> The Place I preached from, was the Backside of a Garden, belonging to one Mr. <HI>W—s,</HI> who
<PB N="195" REF="004453_0194_100DA0202DA20990"/>
invited me to <HI>Abergavenny,</HI> and erected a Place very commodious for my standing upon; so that the People, (in Number about two Thousand) could all hear very well. Afterwards we retired, and sung a Hymn; and some Ladies having the Curiosity to come and hear us, I took that Opportunity of dissuading them against Ball<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Assemblies, and all other polite Entertain∣ments. I hope GOD intended them good: For afterwards, I heard they were the chief Mistresses of the Assembly in <HI>Abergavenny. Oh the polite World! How are they led away by lying Vanities.</HI></P>
<P>After Dinner, I went, according to Appoint∣ment, with about forty on Horseback, to <HI>Comihoy,</HI> five Miles from <HI>Abergavenny,</HI> and found the Minister of the Church to be a hearty Friend, and two or three others like minded with him. This rejoyced me exceedingly; and to see how loving the poor People were to me, much in∣creased my Joy. — The Church not being quite large enough to hold half the Congregation, I preached from the Cross in the Churchyard. — The Word came with Power. — Did not GOD call me elsewhere, I could spend some Months in <HI>Wales</HI> very profitably: The longer I am in it, the more I like it. To me they seem a People sweetly disposed to receive the Gospel. — They are simple and artless. They have left Bigotry more than the Generality of our <HI>Englishmen</HI>; and, through the Exhortations of <HI>Howel Harris,</HI> and the Ministry of others, they are hungring and thirsting after the Righteousness of JESUS CHRIST. — When I had done, I

About Noon we reached <HI>Carleon,</HI> fifteen Miles from <HI>Abergavenny,</HI> a Town famous for having thirty <HI>British</HI> Kings buried in it, and producing three noble Christian Martyrs. I chose parti∣cularly to go hither, because when my Brother <HI>Howel Harris</HI> was there last, some of the baser Sort beat a Drum, and huzza'd around him, on purpose to disturb him. — But GOD suffered them not to move a Tongue now, though I preached from the very same Place, and prayed for him by Name, as I have in every Place where I have preached in <HI>Wales.</HI> GOD <HI>forbid I should be ashamed either of my Master or his Servants.</HI> — Many Thousands were there from all Parts to hear me, and GOD gave me such extraordinary Assistance, that I was carried out beyond myself; and I believe the Scoffers <HI>felt</HI> me to some Purpose. <HI>Oh that the Love of</HI> CHRIST <HI>may melt them down.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="004453_0196_100DA025A20E0098"/>After Dinner, we parted with some of our Friends, who were obliged to return home, be∣cause they came from far.

I believe GOD was with us. Oh how swiftly has this Week passed off! To me it has been but as one Day. How do I pity those polite ones, who complain that Time hangs heavy upon their Hands!

Visited the religious Society last Night, preached at four in the Afternoon, to a great Congregation at <HI>St. Michael</HI>'s Church, visited a Society near the <HI>West-gate-Street</HI> at seven, and another at eight; the last of which was very much cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uded. <HI>Oh what unspeakable Pleasure does it give me, to see my own Townsmen receive the Word with Joy!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="004453_0199_100DA08F20FCE688"/><HI>Wednesday, April</HI> 11. Was treated this Day as I expected, and as I told my Friends I should be used, when I first entred the City. — The Minister of <HI>St. Michael</HI>'s was pleased to lend me his Church yesterday and to day, but some wealthy <HI>Demetrius</HI>'s being offended at the Great∣ness of the Congregations, and alledging that it kept People from their Business, he was influenced by some of them to deny the Use of his Pulpit any more on a Week Day. <HI>Alas! what an Enmity there is in the natural Man against the Success of the Gospel! How fond are they of</HI> Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raoh<HI>'s Objection,</HI>
<Q>Ye are idle, ye are idle; therefore ye say, Let us go worship the <HI>LORD.</HI></Q></P>
<P>About four I set out for <HI>Painswick,</HI> a Town four Miles distant from <HI>Gloucester,</HI> where the Pulpit being denied, I preached to a very large Congregation from the Stairs belonging to the School-house, in one of the Streets. Many were solicitous for me to come and preach at other neighbouring Places also. —At my Return to <HI>Gloucester,</HI> my Heart was much refreshed by the Reception of near thirty Letters from <HI>Bristol</HI>; all, I hope, from Persons whose Hearts GOD hath been pleased to touch, and powerfully con∣vince of Self-righteousness. — LORD, <HI>not unto me, but unto thy Name be all the Glory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, April</HI> 12. Spent the Morning in answering some of my dear Correspondents, and preached in the Evening to near three Thousand Hearers in a Field belonging to my Brother. Cry out who will against his my Forwardness, I cannot see my dear C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untrymen and Fellow
<PB N="201" REF="004453_0200_100D828599523168"/>
Christians every where ready to perish through Ignorance and Unbelief, and not endeavour to convince them of both.</P>
<P>Those who forbid me to speak to these poor baptized <HI>Heathens,</HI> that they may be saved, upon them I call to give a Reason for their so doing; a Reason which may satisfy not Man only, but GOD. And accordingly, I here cite them to answer it to our common Master. What their real Reason is, whether Envy, or <HI>Master, in so doing thou reproachest us</HI>; or ought else, shall, one Day, be manifested to Men and Angels.</P>
<P>I am, and prosess myself a Member of the <HI>Church of England.</HI> I have received no Prohi∣bition from any of the Bishops; and having had no Fault sound by them with my Life or Doc∣trine, have the same general Licence to preach, which the Rectors are willing to think sufficient for their Curates; nor can any of them produce one Instance of their having refused the Assistance of a Stranger Clergyman, because he had not a written Licence. — And have their Lordships, the Bishops, insisted that no Person shall ever preach occasionally without such special Licence? Is not our producing our Letters of Orders <HI>always judged sufficient?</HI> Have not some of us been <HI>allowed</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o preach in <HI>Georgia,</HI> and other Places, by no other than our general Commission? <HI>Take thou Authority to, &amp;c.</HI> nay, and therefore ordained that we might preach in <HI>Georgia?</HI> — His Lordship of <HI>London</HI> allowed of my preach∣ing there, even when I had only received Dea∣con's Orders; and I have never been charged
<PB N="202" REF="004453_0201_100D8287FB205270"/>
by his Lordship with teaching or living otherwise than as a true Minister, and true Son of the <HI>Church of England.</HI> I keep close to her Articles and Homilies; which, if my Opposers did, we should not have so many Dissenters from her. But it is most notorious, that for the moralizing Iniquity of the Priests, the Land mourns. We have <HI>preached</HI> and <HI>lived</HI> many sincere Persons out of our Communion.—I have now conversed with several of the best of all Denominations; many of them solemnly protest that they went from the Church, because they could not find Food for their Souls; they stayed among us till they were starved out.</P>
<P>I know this Declaration will expose me to the Illwill, not of <HI>all</HI> my Brethren, but of all my indolent, earthly-minded, Pleasure-taking Brethren. But was I not to speak, the very Stones would cry out against them. Speak therefore I must, and will, and will not spare. GOD look to the Event. <HI>Whatever becomes of the Pastors who feed themselves, and not the Flock, I have born my Testimony, I have delivered my own Soul.</HI></P>
<P>After Sermon, I visited two crowded Societies; many received the Word with Glad∣ness; and to day I felt such an intense Love, that I could have almost wished myself accursed for my Brethren according to the Flesh. <HI>Oh that they experimentally knew the Things that belong to their Peace before they are everlastingly bid from their Eyes!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="004453_0202_100D828ADFDF5CE0"/><HI>Friday, April</HI> 19. Was much delighted with some more Letters I received from some young Soldiers of JESUS CHRIST. — Redeemed what Time I could to answer some of them; preached at Noon to a much larger Congregation than yesterday in the Field; took a little Refresh∣ment, and went, upon Invitation to <HI>Chafford,</HI> eight Miles from <HI>Gloucester,</HI> where I preached with great Power to above 3000 Souls, all which behaved with great Decency, and like new-born Babes, seemed desirous to be fed with the sincere Milk of the Word. <HI>It rejoyces me much to find that my Countrymen also receive the Gospel. Oh that it may take deep Root in their Hearts!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, April</HI> 14. Lay at <HI>Stroud,</HI> about three Miles from <HI>Chafford,</HI> preached in the Fields belonging to the Inn, at Nine in the Morning, to about 600 People; went to <HI>Stone∣house</HI> to pay my dear Flock a Visit there; and being intreated most earnestly, as I passed through the Town yesterday, at three I preached again at <HI>Painswick,</HI> to double the Number I preached to before. And GOD was with us of a Truth. Assoon as I had done, I hasted to <HI>Gloucester,</HI> according to Appointment, and preached in the <HI>Boothall</HI> to, I believe, near 5000 People. Extraordinary Power GOD was pleased to give me. I was uncommonly enlarged in Prayer; and though I had preached twice, and rode some Miles, yet I think I never spoke with greater Demonstration of the Spirit. <HI>GOD will work, and who shall hinder?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="004453_0203_100D828D91C28240"/>After this, I received another Packet of Letters from <HI>Bris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol</HI> People, and was comforted by the coming of some more Friends, with whom I took sweet Counsel, and praised GOD lustily, and with a good Courage. <HI>How are his Mercies showered down upon me! What Enlargements of Heart have I experienced this Night! Oh that I had a thousand Tongues wherewith to praise my GOD! About three Days ago I was much hum∣bled, now am I exalted. Yet a little while and I shall be humbled again. Thus GOD acts ac∣cording as he seeth best for our Souls.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, April</HI> 15. Preached by eight in the Morning to a larger Congregation than ever in my Brother's Field; went to the Cathedral Service at Ten; and after Dinner went to <HI>Stonehouse,</HI> being invited thither by the Minister, as well as People. — It rained all the Way going thither; but notwithstanding that, I believe 3000 Souls were ready to hear me, and behaved with great Decency and Devotion whilst I was speaking to them. The Church not being large enough to contain a third part of the Auditory, I preached from a very commodious Place on the Outside; and though it rained the whole Time, yet I did not observe one Person leave the Place before I had done.—Afterwards many of the Children of GOD came to me. rejoycing that <HI>Free Grace in</HI> CHRIST had been preached unto them, telling me, it was Food to their Souls, and what they had experienced for some Years. — The other People also behaved most affectionately, and would have constrained
<PB N="205" REF="004453_0204_100D82909A2C0AF0"/>
me to abide with them all Night; but being engaged to return back to <HI>Gloucester,</HI> I hasted thither through the Rain, and expounded in the <HI>Boothall</HI> to above 5000 People. They behaved excellently well, and hung upon me to hear the Word. — All was husht and solemn. — And my delivering the Word from a Place just before where the Judges sit rendered it very awful. — <HI>Oh that I could plead the Cause of my Lord and King, even</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>with greater Power!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, April</HI> 16. Preached with an extra∣ordinary Presence of GOD amongst us at my Brother's Field about ten in the Morning. — Received a most comfortable Packet of Letters, giving me an Account of the Success of the Gospel; — visited the Prison, took a little Refreshment, preached to near a Thousand at <HI>Oxnell,</HI> seven Miles from <HI>Gloucester.</HI> being in∣vited thither by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Paunce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oot,</HI> a worthy Minister of JESUS CHRIST; then re∣turned, and preached my Farewel Discourse to more People than ever in the <HI>Boothall,</HI> and after∣wards found my Strength renewed, and my Soul filled with divine Love and Joy in the Holy Ghost. <HI>Oh what a Mystery is the hidden Life of a Christian!</HI></P>
<P>Had many merciful Deliverances in going to, and returning from <HI>Newent. Praise the LORD, O my Soul, and all that is within me, praise his holy Name.</HI></P>
<P>Received Letters from <HI>Abergavenny,</HI> acquaint∣ing me how many had been convinced since I was there. — Heard of one that had received
<PB N="206" REF="004453_0205_100D82949AC04058"/>
the Holy Ghost immediately upon my preach∣ing CHRIST. Received a Letter from one under strong Convictions; and, indeed, there is scarce a Day passes over my Head, but GOD shews me that he works effectually upon the Hearts of many by my Ministry. <HI>A Proof this, I am sure, that the Word preached is not my own, but GOD's. May he always own it in this Manner. Even so Lord</HI> JESUS.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, April</HI> 17. Spent this Morning in visiting a private Society, and conversing with many religious Friends, who came from far to take their Leave. — About eleven, by the Bishop's Permission, I baptized, at the Church of <HI>St. Mary de Crypt,</HI> Mr. <HI>Thomas W—d,</HI> a professed Quaker, about sixty Years of Age, who was convinced of the Necessity of being born again of <HI>Water</HI> as well as the <HI>Spirit.</HI> Many of CHRIST's faithful Servants a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ended on the Prayers around him; and, I believe, the Holy Ghost was with us of a Truth. — After the Solemnity was over, I gave a Word of Exhortation from the Font; and it being the Place where I myself not long since had been baptized, it gave me an Opportunity of reflect∣ing on my own frequent Breaches of my bap∣tismal Vow, and proving the Necessity of the <HI>New-Birth</HI> from the Office of our Church. <HI>GOD, I believe, gave it his Blessing.</HI></P>
<P>After this, we returned, and gave private Thanks; and having dined, prayed with, and taken Leave of my weeping Friends, and dis∣persed a great many of my Sermons amongst
<PB N="207" REF="004453_0206_100D82972165AEC0"/>
the Poor, I took Horse. <HI>But, Oh what Love did the People express for me! How many came to me weeping, and telling me what GOD had done for their Souls by my Ministry! Oh how did they pray for my Return amongst them! LORD, I dared not expect such Success among my own Coun∣trymen.</HI> When I came to the City, I found the Devil had painted me in most horrible Colours: For it was currently reported, that I was really mad; that I had said, I was the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> and that I had walked bareheaded through <HI>Bristol</HI> Streets singing Psalms. — But GOD was pleased to shew them that the Devil was a Liar, and that the Words that I spoke were not those of a Madman, but the Words of Soberness and Truth.— It often pleases me to think how GOD makes Way for me into the Hearts of his People; nay, even of his Enemies, wherever I go. — My first asking Leave for the Pulpit, and preach∣ing in the Fields, notwithstanding they are denied, puts me in mind of the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> first intreating Leave of <HI>Og, Sihon,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>To go quietly through their Land; but fighting their Way through, when Leave was denied. Like them, by the Strength of my Divine Leader, I shall, at last, be more than Conqueror over all the</HI> Canaanites, <HI>and carnal Teachers among the</HI> Israel <HI>of GOD.</HI></P>

<P>Being earnestly invited by several of the Inha∣bitants, I came hither, attended with about a dozen Friends, by five of the Clock; and the Use of the Pulpit being refused me, I preached
<PB N="208" REF="004453_0207_100D8299F1DD03C0"/>
on the <HI>Bowling-green</HI> belonging to the <HI>Plough-Inn.</HI> — When I came in, the Town, I per∣ceived, was alarmed, by the People standing at their Doors. At the first, I found my self quite shut up. — My Heart and Head were dead as a Stone; but when I came to the Inn, my Soul began to be enlarged. I felt a Freedom in my Spirit, and was enabled to preach with extraor∣dinary Power, to near two Thousand People. Many were convicted. One was drowned in Tears, because she had said I was crazy; and some were so filled with the Holy Ghost, that they were almost unable to support themselves under it. <HI>This, I know, is Foolishness to the natural and Letter-learned Men; but I write this for the Comfort of GOD's Children. They know what these Things mean.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, April</HI> 8. Preached this Morning with Power, to a much larger Congregation than we had last Night. Several Servants of GOD said, they never saw the like before.— Whilst I was preaching, I saw the People melted into Tears, and, by their Looks, shewed that the Divine Presence was amongst them.— We shall see greater Things than these: For almost every Day Persons of all Denominations come unto me, telling how they interceed in my Behalf. And it shall now be my particular Business, wherever I go, to bring all the Children of GOD, notwithstanding their Differences, to rejoyce together. <HI>How dare we not converse with those that have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>EVESHAM</HI> in <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> twelve Miles from <HI>Cheltenham.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Continued at <HI>Cheltenham,</HI> for the Sake of a little Retirement, and some private Business, till after Dinner, and got safe to <HI>Evesham,</HI> (where Mr. <HI>Seward</HI>'s Relations live) about seven at Night. — I found there had been much Talk about my coming, GOD wisely ordering it to engage and excite the People's Attention. — Several Persons came to see me, amongst whom was Mr. <HI>Benjamin Seward,</HI> whom GOD has been pleased to call by his free Grace very lately. —Both his Circumstances before, and in Con∣version, much resemble those of <HI>St. Paul.</HI> For he was bred up at the Feet of <HI>Gamaliel,</HI> being at <HI>Cambridge</HI> for some Years. As touching the Law, so far as outward Morality went, he was blameless; concerning Zeal, opposing the Church. My Proceedings he could not like, and he had once a Mind, he said, to write against Mr. <HI>Law</HI>'s Enthusiastic Notions in his <HI>Christian Perfection.</HI> — But lately it has pleased GOD to reveal his dear Son in him, and to cast him down to the Earth, as he did <HI>Saul,</HI> by eight Days Sickness; in which Time he scarce ever eat, or drank, or slept, and underwent great inward Agonies and Tortures. — After this, the Scales fell more and more from the Eyes of his Mind. — GOD sent a poor travelling Woman, that came to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell Straw Toys, to instruct him in the Nature of our second Birth, and now he is resolved to prepare for Holy Orders, and to
<PB N="210" REF="004453_0209_100D829F3A23A6D8"/>
preach CHRIST and those Truths straightway in every Synagogue, which once he endeavoured to destroy. — He is a Gentleman of a very large Fortune, which he has now devoted to GOD. And I write this, to shew how far a Man may go, and yet know nothing of JESUS CHRIST. — Behold, here was one who con∣stantly attended on the Means of Grace, exact in his Morals, humane and courteous in his Conversation, who gave much in Alms, was frequent in private Duties; and yet, till about six Weeks ago, as destitute of any saving expe∣rimental Knowledge of JESUS CHRIST, as those on whom his Name was never called, and who still sit in Darkness, and the Shadow of Death. <HI>Blessed be GOD, that although not many rich, not many mighty, not many noble are called, yet</HI> some <HI>are. — Who would but be accounted a Fool for</HI> CHRIST<HI>'s sake? How often has my Companion and honoured Friend Mr.</HI> William Seward <HI>been deemed a Madman even by this very Brother, for going to</HI> Georgia? <HI>But lo! GOD now has made him an Instrument of converting his Brother. This more and more convinces me, that we must be despised, e'er we can be Vessels fit for</HI> GOD<HI>'s Use.</HI> As for my own Part, I find, by happy Expe∣rience, the more I am contemned, the more GOD delights to honour me, in bringing home Souls to CHRIST. —And I write this for the En∣couragement of my fellow Labourers, who have all Manner of Evil spoken against them falsly for CHRIST's Sake. <HI>Let them not be afraid, but rejoice and be exceeding glad: For the Spirit of God, and of Glory, shall rest upon their Souls.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="004453_0210_100D82A2D8E26C20"/><HI>Thursday, April</HI> 19. Went to <HI>Badsey,</HI> about two Miles from <HI>Evesham,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Seward</HI>'s eldest Brother lives. — We were most kindly received, and, I hope, a true Christian Church will be in their House. — About four in the Evening, the Churches both at <HI>Evesham, Benge∣worth,</HI> and <HI>Badsey,</HI> being denied, I preached from the Cross, in the Middle of <HI>Evesham-street.</HI> to a great Congregation, and went to <HI>Badsey,</HI> and preached in Mr. <HI>Seward</HI>'s Brother's Yard to a great Number of People, many of which came from <HI>Evesham</HI> to hear me again. — <HI>GOD grant it may strike home to their Hearts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, April</HI> 20. Preached about nine in the Morning at the Cross, went to public Worship, and received the Sacrament. — Preached at <HI>Badsey</HI> at five in the Evening, and returned and expounded in the Town-Hall; which, though very large, was quite thronged.— The Recorder himself procured the Keys for us, and great Numbers of People were truly affected. The standing in the Judge's Place, and speaking from thence, gave me awful Thoughts of GOD; and the Consideration that I was speaking in the Name of our great High Priest and Judge, animated me very much. <HI>Oh that I had a thousand Tongues, they should all be employed in his Service.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Saturday, April</HI> 21. Preached in the Morning at <HI>Badsey,</HI> to a weeping Audience, joyned in Prayer, and set out for <HI>Oxon,</HI> which I reached about Ten at Night. I had been much pressed
<PB N="212" REF="004453_0211_100D82A59628F558"/>
in Spirit to hasten hither, and now I found the Reason for it. For alas! the Enemy had got great Advantage over three of our Christian Brethren, and driven them to deny CHRIST's visible Church upon Earth. They had so far influenced and deluded Mr. <HI>Kinchin,</HI> a sincere and humble Minister of JESUS CHRIST, that I found, through their Persuasion, he had actually quitted his Fellowship, and intended to resign his Living. — This, I must needs confess, gave me a great Shock: For I knew what dreadful Consequences would attend a needless Separation from the established Church.— As for my own Part, I can see no Reason for my leaving the Church, however I am treated by the corrupt Members and Ministers of it: For I judge of the State of a Church, not from the Practice of its Members, but its primitive and public Con∣stitutions. — And so long as I think the Articles of the <HI>Church of England</HI> are agreeable to Scripture, I am resolved to preach them up without either Bigotry or Party Zeal. — <HI>For I love all that love the</HI> LORD JESUS.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, April</HI> 22. Being much concerned about Mr. <HI>K</HI>—'s Conduct, this Morning I wrote him the following Letter.</P>

when we are afraid to be open to our dear Brethren. <HI>Satan</HI> has desired to sift you as Wheat: He is dealing with you as he did with me some Years ago, when he kept me in my Closet near six Weeks, because I could not do any Thing with a single Intention; so he would have you no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> preach till you have re∣ceived the Holy Ghost in the full Assurance of it, and that is the Way never to have it at all: For GOD will be found in the Use of Means, and our LORD sent out his Disciples to preach <HI>before</HI> they had received the Holy Ghost in that most plentiful Manner at the Day of <HI>Pentecost.</HI> Besides, consider, my dear Brother, what Confusion your separating from the Church will occasion. The Prison Doors are already shut, one Society stopped, and most afraid almost to converse with us. — I can assure you, that my being a Minister of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and preaching its Articles, is a Means, under GOD, of drawing so many after me.— As for objecting about the Habits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> good GOD! I thought we long since knew, that the Kingdom of GOD did not consist in any Externals, but in Righteousness, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost. Oh! my dear Brother, I travel in Pain for you. — Never was I more shocked at any Thing than at your Proceedings. I doubt not but you will pray to GOD that you may be kept from Delusion at the reading of this: For I am not ignorant of <HI>Satan</HI>'s Devices, and I know he never more successfully tempts us, than when

<P>Visited two Societies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the first of which many Gownsmen did me the Honour of coming to hear. — Before I began, I desired them to behave like Gentlemen and Christians. — I also prayed particularly for them, and applied myself in Meekness and Love to them at the End of my Discourse. I bless GOD, an Awe was impressed upon their Minds, and they behaved quietly; — but afterwards they followed me to my Inn, and came uninvited up into my Room.— How∣ever, I took that Opportunity of giving them a second Exhortation. — I found great Freedom and Sweetness in my Spirit; and though some, no doubt, mocked, yet I believe some will remember what was said. — <HI>Oh how is the faithful City become an Harlot! O that my Head was Water, and my Eyes Fountains of Tears, that I might weep Day and Night for the Members of this University! LORD send forth thy Light, and thy Truth, and make them Scribes ready instructed to thy heavenly Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>Blessed be GOD for sending me hither. — I find now it was his Divine Will. — For our dear Brother <HI>K</HI>— falling into such an Error, has given such a Shock, that unless I had come, in all Probability the Brethren would have been scattered abroad like Sheep having no Shepherd.

<P><HI>Tuesday, April</HI> 24. Perceived myself much strengthened yesterday and this Morning, and told my Friends how these Words were impressed upon me, <HI>And more than meet the gathering Storm.</HI>— About Nine of the Clock, after I had exhorted the Brethren, and pretty well established them in the Faith, the Vice-Chancellor came in Person to the House where we were assembled, having threatned to do so some Time ago, if they continued to build up one another in that Manner.— He sent for me down Stairs, being informed that I was in the House. — When I first saw him, I perceived he was in a Passion, which he soon expressed in such Language as this; <HI>Have you, Sir,</HI> says he, <HI>a Name in any Book here?</HI> Yes, Sir, said I,; but I intend to take it out soon. — <HI>Yes, and you had best take yourself out too,</HI> replied he, <HI>or otherwise I will lay you by the Heels. What do you mean,</HI> continued he, <HI>by going about, and alienating the People's Affections from their proper Pastors? Your Works are full of Vanity and Nonsense, you pretend to Inspiration. If you ever come again in this Manner among thes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> People, I will lay you first by the Heels, and these shall follow.</HI> Upon this, he turned his Back, and went away.— I desired the Brethren to joyn in Prayer for him. — Took my Leave, being just going to set out as the Vice-Chancellor came in. I soon found by the Comforts GOD
<PB N="216" REF="004453_0215_100D82B11F4E1D48"/>
gave me, how glorious it was to suffer any Thing for the Sake of JESUS CHRIST.— How∣ever, I must not forget mentioning, that I ex∣horted all the Brethren not to forsake the assembling themselves together, though no Pastor should be permitted to come amongst them; For so long as they continued stedfast in the Communion of the established Church, I told them no Power on Earth could justify hindring them from continuing in Fellowship, as the primitive Christians did, in order to build up each other in the Knowledge and Fear of GOD. <HI>Oh what Advantage has</HI> Satan <HI>gained over us, by our Brother</HI> K—<HI>'s putting off his Gown! However, though he is permitted to bruise our Heel, yet we shall, in the End, bruise his Head. — The Gates of Hell shall never prevail against the Church of</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>either visible or invisible.</HI></P>
<P>About Eight at Night, I, and my Friends, reached <HI>Uxbridge,</HI> where we were greatly re∣freshed by the coming of several Brethren, and the Receipt of some Letters from <HI>Savannah.</HI> Blessed be GOD, all is well; and I shall now thing the Time long till I embark for <HI>Georgia.

Assisted in administring the blessed Sacrament at <HI>Islington</HI>: where the Vicar, in Conformity to the Rubrick, takes Care to observe the Octaves of <HI>Easter.</HI>—After this, I expounded to a large Room full of People, and with such Power and Demonstration of the Spirit, as I never saw before. Surely the Hea∣rers Hearts were quite melted down by the preaching of the free Grace of GOD in CHRIST JESUS to poor Sinners. Floods of loving Tears flowed from their Eyes. — In the Evening I expounded to a Society at <HI>St. Mary's Hill,</HI> and then retired to Bed, wishing that all felt the Comforts GOD was then pleased to communicate to my Soul. <HI>Indeed I can say, that the LORD is gracious.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, April</HI> 27. Went this Morning to <HI>Islington</HI> to preach, according to the Appointment of my dear Brother in CHRIST, the Rev. Mr. <HI>Stonehouse</HI>; — but in the midst of the Prayers, the Church-Warden came, demanding me to produce my Licence, or otherwise he forbad my preaching in that Pulpit. I believe I might have insisted upon my Right to preach, being in Priest's Orders, and having the Presentation
<PB N="218" REF="004453_0217_100D82B61D4C7530"/>
of the Living at <HI>Savannah,</HI> which is in the Bishop of <HI>London</HI>'s Diocese, a stronger Licence than that implicite one, by which Hundreds of the inferior Clergy are by his Lordship permitted to preach: However, for Peace Sake, I declined preaching in the Church; but after the Com∣munion Service was over, I preached in the Churchyard; being assured my Master now called me out here, as well as in <HI>Bristol.</HI>— The second Lesson was <HI>Acts</HI> the xxiv. which contained the plausible Speech <HI>Tertullus</HI> made against <HI>Paul,</HI> a Ringleader of the Sect of the <HI>Nazarenes,</HI> which GOD applied closely to my Heart. And he was pleased so to assist me in preaching, and so wonderfully to affect the Hearers, that I be∣lieve we could have went singing of Hymns to Prison. <HI>Let not the Adversaries say, I have thrust myself out of their Synagogues: No; they have thrust me out. And since the Self-righteous Men of this Generation count themselves unworthy, I go out into the Highways and Hedges, and compel Harlots, Publicans and Sinners to come in, that my Master's House may be filled. They who are sincere, will follow after me to bear the Word of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Expounded at Night to a very large Society in <HI>Wapping,</HI> with great Power, and perceived that the <HI>London</HI> People were much improved since I left them; indeed their Hearts seem to be quite broken, and I believe they would pluck out their Eyes if it were possible to serve me. LORD▪ <HI>sanctify my coming to them, and grant that they may receive a second Benefit.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="004453_0218_100D82BA4637F6F8"/><HI>Saturday, April</HI> 28. Preached this Morning again in <HI>Islington Churchyard,</HI> and, blessed be GOD, the Congregation was near as large again as Yesterday, and the Word was attended with extraordinary Power. The second Lesson was very applicable, being <HI>Acts</HI> xxv. I can say with St. <HI>Paul, Neither against the Temple, nor against</HI> Caesar <HI>have I done any Thing, and yet I am put out of their Synagogues, and reviled as an evil Doer; but the Scriptures must be fulfilled,</HI>
<Q>If they have persecuted me, they will also per∣secute you.</Q></P>
<P>About six I expounded to a thronged Society of Women at <HI>Fetter-lane,</HI> and at eight on <HI>St. Mary's Hill.</HI> The Portion of Scripture that Providence directed me to, was the Nineteenth of <HI>Genesis,</HI> which was very applicable to what happened: For some wicked Men, Men of <HI>Belial,</HI> came and pressed, and broke down the Door; but GOD was pleased to give me such Power at the last, that they were forced into an awful Silence, and, I believe they really felt the Weight of GOD's Word. <HI>The Fierceness of Men shall turn to thy Praise, and the Fierceness of them shalt thou restrain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, April</HI> 29. Preached in the Morning at <HI>Moorfields,</HI> to an exceeding great Multitude.— At Ten, went to <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> and heard Dr. <HI>Trapp</HI> preach most virulently against me and my Friends, upon these Words, <HI>Be not righteous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver-much, why shouldst thou destroy thy self?</HI> GOD gave me great Serenity of Mind; but alas! the Preacher was not so calm as I wished
<PB N="220" REF="004453_0219_100D82BBD1A03500"/>
him. His Sermon was sounded upon wrong Suppositions, (the necessary Consequence of his hearing with other Men's Ears) not to say there were many direct Untruths in it. — And he argued so strenuously against all <HI>inward Feelings,</HI> that he plainly proved, that with all his Learning, he knew nothing yet as he ought to know. <HI>I pray</HI> GOD <HI>rebuke his Spirit, and grant that that Sermon may never rise up in Judgment against him.</HI></P>
<P>Being weakened by my Morning's preaching, in the Afternoon I refreshed myself by a little Sleep, and at five went and preached at <HI>Ken∣nington Common,</HI> about two Miles from <HI>London,</HI> where no less than thirty Thousand People were supposed to be present; the Wind being for me, it carried the Voice to the extremest Part of the Audience.</P>
<P>All stood attentive, and joined in the Psalm and Lord's Prayer most regularly, — and I scarce ever preached more quietly in any Church.— The Word came with Power. — The People were much affected▪ and expressed their Love to me many Ways. — All agreed it was never seen on this wise before. <HI>Oh what need have all GOD's People to rejoyce and give Thanks! I hope a good Inroad has been made into the Devil's King∣dom this Day. LORD, not unto me, but to thy Name be all the Glory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, April</HI> 30. Declined preaching to Day, that I might have Leisure to write to some of my Correspondents, and make Preparations for my poor Orphans at <HI>Georgia.</HI> — Received
<PB N="221" REF="004453_0220_100D82C011969428"/>
Letters this Evening from thence, telling me of the Affairs of that Colony. — At present they have but a melancholly Aspect; but our Extre∣mity is GOD's Opportunity. — <HI>LORD, thou calledst me; lo! I come to do thy Will.</HI> — Heard also that Mr. <HI>K—n</HI> had got over his Scruples, and of the wonderful Success of my honoured Friend Mr. <HI>John Wesley</HI>'s Ministry in <HI>Bristol,</HI> and of much Opposition at <HI>Oxon. Certainly</HI> GOD <HI>is about to bring mighty Things to pass.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, May</HI> 1. Preached after publick Service in <HI>Islington Churchyard,</HI> to a greater Congregation than ever. And in the Evening went to expound on <HI>Dowgate Hill,</HI> the House of Mr. <HI>C</HI>—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but when I came to the Door, no less than two or three Thousand People were gathered round it; so that to avoid a Noise, I was obliged to stand up in the Fore-street Win∣dow, and preach to them in the Street.— And I think they behaved well; and they would have behaved much better, had they not been disturbed. Now know I more and more, that the LORD calls me into the Fields: For no House or Street is able to contain half the People that come to hear the Word. — <HI>This is a Time for doing; yet a little while, and a suffering Time will come. I cannot follow him now; but I shall follow him afterwards.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, May</HI> 2. Preached this Evening again to above ten Thousand at <HI>Kennington Common,</HI> and spent the Remainder of the Even∣ing in Conference with our Brethren in <HI>Fetter-lane</HI> Society.—I hope we do build up one another
<PB N="222" REF="004453_0221_100D82C365049FA0"/>
in our most holy Faith. — Our Brethren that have fallen into Errors, have left us voluntarily. <HI>And now the old Leaven is purged out, we walk in the Comforts of the Holy Ghost, and are edified.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, May</HI> 3. Was fully employed all Day in making Preparations for my Voyage, and preached at six in the Evening (a Time I choose that People may not be drawn away from their Business) at <HI>Kennington,</HI> and great Power was amongst us▪ — The Audience was more numerous and silent than yesterday, the Evening calm, and many went affected away. <HI>Glory be to GOD, I begin to find an Alteration i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the People's Behaviour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>eady. GOD grant it may increase more and more.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, May</HI> 5. Preached Yesterday and to Day, as usual, at <HI>Kennington Common,</HI> to about twenty Thousand Hearers, who were very much affected. —The Remainder of my Time I spent in preparing Things for <HI>Georgia.</HI> — I am not usually so much engaged in Seculars; but I as readily do this as preach, when it is the Will of GOD. — It is a great Mistake that some run into, to suppose Religion consists only in saying our Prayers▪ but I think a Man is no further holy, than he is relatively holy. And he only will adorn the Gospel of our Lord JESUS CHRIST in all Things, who is careful to perform all the civil Offices of Life, whether Servant, Master, or Mistress, with a single Eye to GOD's Glory, and from a Principle of a lively Faith in JESUS CHRIST our Saviour. — <HI>This is the Morality which I preach, and which shall stand as long as
<PB N="223" REF="004453_0222_100D82C5EF4B1228"/>
the Rock on which it is founded; while all Mo∣rality set up in Opposition to this, shall sink, with its Professors, into Hell.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, May</HI> 6. Preached this Morning in <HI>Moorfields,</HI> to about twenty Thousand People, who were very quiet and attentive, and much affected.— Went to publick Worship Morning and Evening; and at six preached at <HI>Kennington</HI> —But such a Sight never were my Eyes blessed with before.— I believe there were no less than fifty Thousand People, near fourscore Coaches, besides great Numbers of Horses, and what is most remarkable, there was such an awful Silence amongst them, and the Word of GOD came with such Power, that all, I believe, were plea∣singly surprized. GOD gave me great Enlarge∣ment of Heart. I continued my Discourse for an Hour and a Half; and when I returned home, I was filled with such Love, Peace and Joy, that I cannot express it. — I believe this was partly owing to some Opposition I met with Yesterday. <HI>It is hard for Men to kick against the Pricks. — The more they oppose, the more shall</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>be exalted.</HI> Our Adversaries seem to be come to an Extremity, while for want of Arguments to convince, they are obliged to call out to the civil Magistrate to compel me to be silent; but I believe it will be difficult to prove our Assemblies in the Fields to be either disorderly or illegal. <HI>But they that are born after the Flesh, must persecute those that are born after the Spirit.— Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="004453_0223_100D82C77A1E5F48"/><HI>Monday, May</HI> 7. Had full Employment again to Day in preparing for my Voyage; did not preach, only expounded in a private House, where ten Pounds were collected for the Orpha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Though I kept it as secret as possible, yet Num∣bers of People crouded round the Door; so that I find myself more and more under a Necessity of going out into the Fields.</P>
<P>Received several Letters of the Fruits of my Ministry in several Places, and had divers come to me awakened, under GOD, by my preaching in the Fields.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, May</HI> 8. Preached in the Evening, as usual, on <HI>Kennington Common.</HI>— Some consider∣able Time before I se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out from Town, it rained very hard, so that once I thought of not going; but several pious Friends joined in hearty Prayer that GOD would be pleased to withhold the Rain, which was done immediately. — To my great Suprize, when I came to the <HI>Common,</HI> I saw above twenty Thousand People. — All the while, except for a few Moments, the Sun shone out upon us; and, I trust, the Sun of Righte∣ousness arose on some with healing in his Wings. For the People were melted down very much at the preaching of the Word, and put up hearty Prayers for my temporal and eternal Welfare. <HI>Oh that they may enter into the Ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, May</HI> 9. Waited at Noon upon the honourable Trustees for <HI>Georgia.</HI> — They received me with the utmost Civility, agreed to every Thing I asked, and gave me a Grant of
<PB N="225" REF="004453_0224_100D82C92848D208"/>
Five Hundred Acres of Land, to me and my Successors for ever, for the Use of the Orphan-House. — My Friend <HI>H</HI>— also writes me Word to Day from <HI>Georgia,</HI> that the General and Officers are very kind to him upon my Ac∣count; so that, blessed be GOD, there is a comfortable Prospect of all Things going on as I could wish.</P>
<P>About Four in the Afternoon I was taken ill and deserted, which I always look upon as a certain Preparative for some approaching Mercy. —And so this was; for after GOD had enabled me to preach to about Twenty Thousand for above an Hour at <HI>Kennington,</HI> he inclined the Hearers Hearts to contribute most cheerfully and liberally towards the Orphan-House. — I was one of the Collectors,—and it would have delighted any one to have seen with what Eager∣ness and Cheerfulness the People came up both Sides the Eminence on which I stood, and after∣wards to the Coach Doors to throw in their Mites. — Surely GOD must have touched their Hearts: —For when we came home, we found we had collected above Forty Seven Pounds, amongst which were Sixteen Pounds in Half∣pence; for which we endeavoured to give hearty thanks. — GOD was pleased to pour into my Soul a great Spirit of Supplication, and a Sense of his free distinguishing Mercies so filled me with Love, Humility, and Joy, and holy Confusion, that I could at last only pour out my Heart before him in an awful Silence.—It was so full, that I could not well speak. <HI>Oh the Happiness of a Communion with</HI> GOD!</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="004453_0225_100D82CBB4A9D3A8"/><HI>Thursday, May</HI> 10. Preached at <HI>Kennington</HI>; but it rained most Part of the Day. There were not above Ten Thousand People, and Thirty Coaches.—However, GOD was pleased so visibly to interpose in causing the Weather to clear up, and the Sun to shine out just as I began, that I could not avoid taking Notice of it to the People in my Discourse. Our mi∣nute Philosophers, nay, and our Christians, falsly so called, laugh at the Notion of a parti∣cular Providence. But to suppose a general, without holding a particular Providence, is as absurd, as to imagine there can be a Chain without being composed of Links.— Search the Scriptures, and we shall find, <HI>That not a Sparrow can fall to the Ground without our heavenly Father, and that the very Hairs of our Head are numbred.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, May</HI> 11. Preached at <HI>Kennington</HI> to a larger Audience than the last Night, and col∣lected Twenty Six Pounds Fifteen Shillings and Sixpence, for the Orphan-House.—The Readi∣ness wherewith the People gave is inexpressible. —Indeed I can say they offered willingly. — They could not have taken more Pains, or ex∣pressed more Earnestness, had they all been to have received an Alms from me. <HI>A Sign this, that the Word of God has taken hold of their Hearts.</HI> I found great Sweetness of Soul in myself; and being upon the <HI>Publican</HI> and <HI>Pha∣risee,</HI> I was very earnest in endeavouring to con∣vince the Self-righteous <HI>Pharisees</HI> of this Gene∣ration, and offering JESUS CHRIST freely to all, who, with the hum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le <HI>Publican, feelingly</HI> and
<PB N="227" REF="004453_0226_100DA02A66CAF438"/>
<HI>experimentally</HI> could cry out, <HI>GOD be merciful to me a Sinner.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, May</HI> 12. Agreed to Day for my∣self, and E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>even more, to go on Board the <HI>Eli∣zabeth,</HI> Captain <HI>Allan,</HI> to <HI>Pennsylvania</HI>; where I design, GOD willing, to preach the Gospel in my Way to <HI>Georgia,</HI> and buy Provisions for my Orphan-House. <HI>LORD send thy Angel before me to prepare my Way.</HI></P>
<P>Had many come to me this Morning, ac∣quainting me what GOD had done for their Souls by my preaching in the Fields.— And in the Evening preached to about Twenty Thou∣sand People at <HI>Kennington</HI> as usual, the Weather continuing remarkably fair whilst I was deliver∣ing my Master's Message.— Though I was full of Matter, yet I found a Restraint upon my Spi∣rits, which prevented my speaking with my wonted Freedom: However, I offered JESUS CHRIST to all that would apply him to their Hearts by Faith. <HI>Oh that all would embrace him! The LORD make them willing in the Day of his Power.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, May</HI> 13. Preached this Morning to a prodigious Number of People in <HI>Moorfields,</HI> and collected for the Orphans Fifty Two Pounds Nineteen Shillings and Sixpence, above Twenty Pounds of which was in Halfpence. — Indeed they almost wearied me in receiving their Mites; and they were more than one Man could carry home.—<HI>Thus will GOD make his Power to be known.</HI>—Went to publick Worship twice, and preached in the Evening to near Sixty Thousand
<PB N="228" REF="004453_0227_100DA02E5A986150"/>
People.—Many went away because they could not hear; but GOD enabled me to speak, so that the best Part of them could understand me well; and it is very remarkable what a deep Silence is preserved whilst I am speaking.—Af∣ter Sermon, I made another Collection of Twen∣ty Nine Pounds Seventeen Shillings and Eight∣pence, and came home deeply humbled with a Sense of what God had done for my Soul. — I doubt not but many self-righteous Bigots, when they see me spreading out my Hands to offer JESUS CHRIST freely to all, are ready to cry out,
<Q>How glorious did the Reverend Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> look to Day, when, neglecting the Dignity of a Clergyman, he stood venting his Enthusiastick Ravings in a Gown and Cassock upon a Common, and collecting Mites from the poor People?</Q>
But if this be to be vile, LORD grant that I may be more vile. — I know this Foolishness of preaching is made in∣strumental to the Conversion and Edification of Numbers. <HI>Ye Pharisees mock on, I rejoyce, yea, and will rejoyce.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, May</HI> 14. Spent most of this Day in visiting some Friends, and settling my <HI>Georgia</HI> Affairs. Spent the Evening very agreeably with several Quakers at the House of Mr. <HI>Hy—m. How much Comfort do those lose who converse with none but such as are of their own Communion!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, May</HI> 15. Preached this Evening at <HI>Kennington,</HI> and GOD was pleased to send us a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittle Rain. — But it rejoiced me greatly: — For the People, notwithstanding, stood very
<PB N="229" REF="004453_0228_100DA02FE8363850"/>
attentive; and assoon as the Rain came, I received uncommon Strength from above. <HI>The good LORD water us all with the Dew of his heavenly Blessing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, May</HI> 16. Sent a Quaker, whom GOD was pleased to convince, to be baptized by my dear Brother Mr. <HI>Stonehouse.</HI> Waited upon the honourable Trustees, who still treated me with the utmost Civility.—Dined with some more serious Quakers, and preached at <HI>Kenning∣ton,</HI> and have Reason to bless GOD more and more for the Order and Devotion of those that come to hear the Word. — <HI>Indeed they behave as though they believed GOD was standing at their Right-Hand.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, May</HI> 17. Preached, after several Invitations thither, at <HI>Hampstead-heath,</HI> about five Miles from <HI>London.</HI>— The Audience was of the politer Sort, and I preached very near the Horse-course, which gave me Occasion to speak home to their Souls concerning our spiritual Race — Most were attentive, but some mocked. Thus the Word of GOD is either a Savour of Life unto Life, or of Death unto Death. GOD<HI>'s Spirit bloweth when, and where it listeth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, May</HI> 18. Dined with several of the <HI>Moravian</HI> Church, and could not avoid admiring their great Simplicity, and deep Experience in the inward Life.— At six, I preached in a very large open Place in <HI>Shadwell,</HI> being much pressed by many to go thither.— I believe there were upwards of twenty Thousand People.— At first, through the Greatness of the Throng, there
<PB N="230" REF="004453_0229_100DA03280DE07D8"/>
was a little Hurry; but afterwards, all was hush'd and silent.— I perceived a d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vine Power come upon me from above. — The Word, I believe, made its Way into their Hearts, and very near twenty Pounds were collected for the Orphan-house.— Blessed be GOD, we now begin to surround this great City. <HI>As the Walls of</HI> Jericho <HI>once fell down at the Sound of a few Rams Horns; so I hope even this Foolishness of Preaching, under GOD, will be a Means of pul∣ling down the Devil's strong Holds, which are in and about the City of</HI> London.</P>
<P>Received several excellent Letters, amongst which was one from Mr. <HI>Ralph Erskine,</HI> a Field-Preacher of the <HI>Scots</HI> Church, a noble Soldier of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. <HI>Oh that all that were truly zealous knew one another!

<P>According to his Request I paid him a Visit, and found him in perfect Health both in Body and Mind. A Day or two after, I and Mr. <HI>Seward</HI> went and talked with his Sister, who gave me the three following Sy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tons of his being mad. <HI>First,</HI> That he fasted for near a Fortnight. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That he prayed so as to be heard four Story high. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That he had sold his Clo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hs, and given them to the Poor.— This the young Man himself explained to me before; and ingeniously confessed, that under his first Awakenings, he was one Day reading the Story of the young Man whom our LORD commanded to sell all, and give to the Poor, and thinking it must be taken in the literal Sense, out of Love to JESUS CHRIST he sold his Cloaths, and gave the Money to the Poor. —

<P><HI>Query</HI> 1. If Repentance does not include a Cessation from Sin, and turning to Virtue; and though notwithstanding I want that deep Contrition mentioned by some Divines, yet as I live not wilfully in any known Sin, and firmly believe the Gospel of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, may I not thereby be intitled to the Benefits of CHRIST's Death and Resurrection, in the Perseverance of Knowledge, and Practice of my Duty?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 2. If I am in Prison, whether I may not, without Offence to GOD, make use of Endeavours to be discharged, by which I may be enabled to get into a pious Christian Family, and consequently be grounded and firmly settled in the Love of GOD, it being my Desire; for I am surrounded with nothing but Pro∣phaneness and Wickedness?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 3. If my Objections to being impri∣soned are inconsistent or wicked, which are, that I am obliged to submit to the Rules of the House, in going to my Cell at seven or eight of the Clock at Night, and not let out till six or seven in the Morning, by which I am debarred the Use of Candle, and consequently Books; so that all that Time, except what is spent in Prayer and Meditation, is lost. Which Exercises, though good, are, by so constant Repetition, and for want of Change, deaden'd?</P>

<P>The Way to Salvation is by JESUS CHRIST, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.— The Way to CHRIST is by Faith. <HI>Whosoever liveth and</HI> believeth <HI>in me,</HI> says our LORD, <HI>though he were dead, yet shall be live.</HI> But this Faith, if it is a saving Faith, will <HI>work</HI> by Love Come then to JESUS CHRIST as a poor Sinner, and he will make you a rich Saint. This, I think, serves as an Answer to your first <HI>Query.</HI></P>
<P>It is, no doubt, your Duty, whilst you are in the House, to submit to the Rules of it; but then you may use all lawful Means to get yourself out. I have just now been with your Sister, and will see what can be done farther, <HI>Watch and pray.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Business of an Attorney, I think it unlawful for a Christian, at least exceeding dangerous. Avoid it therefore, and glorify GOD in some other Station. I am,</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I received your Letter, which was a full Answer to my Queries, and give you my hearty Thanks for the Trouble you have taken upon you (the only Gratitude I can at present pay) but he, whom I have perfectly at Heart, will supply the Deficiency to you, and will not suffer a meritorious Act to go unrewarded. O how do I daily experience the Love of CHRIST towards me, who am so vile, base and unwor∣thy! I pray GOD I may always be thankful, and both ready to do and suffer his most gra∣cious Will, which I trust, through your Prayers and GOD's Grace, I shall at all Times submit to.</P>
<P>My Father was with me last Night, when I shewed him your Letter. I told him, I utterly renounced the Business of an Attorney. He then asked what Profession I chose, which I submitted to him, on Condition it might prove agreeable to the Will of GOD. He was pleased to say, he thought me not mad, but very well in my Senses, and would take me out, on Condition Doctor <HI>Monro</HI> and the Com∣mittee were of his Opinion. Then he varied again, and thought it convenient for me to stay the Summer, and so to take Physick twice a Week, fearing a Relapse. I told him, as a Father, he should be wholly obeyed; but when at parting he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entioned my leaving Religion (or Words to that Purpose, at which I was somewhat stirred in Spirit) I told him,
<PB N="236" REF="004453_0235_100DA04214897628"/>
nothing should prevail upon me to leave JESUS CHRIST; upon which he left me. This is the Substance of what passed between us, which▪ I hope, is not amiss to let you know of, as you have been so kind as to plead for my Liberty.</P>
<P>Upon the whole of the Matter, Sir, GOD gives me perfect Resignation, and I trust when he shall see fit, will discharge me; and as I find his Love daily more and more shed abroad in my Heart, all Things will work together for my good. Pray, Sir, be thankful for me, and if Opportunity will let you, I should be sincerely glad to see you before you set out for <HI>America.</HI> And may Almighty GOD, in his infinite Goodness, prosper, guide and protect you, through this transitory Life, and hereafter receive you triumphantly into the heavenly <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> there to converse with, and see the ever blessed JESUS, that dear Lamb of GOD; to which that you may attain, are the hearty and fervent Wishes of</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Upon reading this, I was sensibly touched with a Fellow-feeling of his Misery; and, at my Request, Mr. <HI>Seward,</HI> and two more Friends, waited upon the Committee. But alas! they esteemed my Friends as much mad as the young Man, and frankly told them, both I and my Followers, in their Opinion, were really besides themselves. My Friend <HI>Seward</HI> urged the
<PB N="237" REF="004453_0236_100DA0443B5AE688"/>
Example of the young Persons, who called the Prophet that was sent to anoint <HI>Jehu</HI> King, a mad Fellow; — of our LORD, whom his own Relations, and the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees,</HI> took to be mad, and besides himself; — and <HI>Festus</HI>'s Opinion of <HI>St. Paul.</HI> — He further urged, that when young People were under their first A∣wakenings, they were usually tempted by the Devil to run into some Extremes. But all such Language confirmed the Gentlemen more and more, that Mr. <HI>Seward</HI> was mad also. And to prove that the young Man was certainly mad, they called one of the Attendants, who said, when Mr. <HI>Periam</HI> first came into the Place, he stripped himself to his Shirt, and prayed. — The Reason of this, as Mr. <HI>Periam</HI> said after∣wards, was, that he might i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ure himself to Hardship at once: For being brought from <HI>Bethnall Green,</HI> where he was taken great Care of, into a cold Place without Windows, and a damp Cellar under him, he thought it best to season himself at first, that he might learn to endure Hardness as a good Soldier of JESUS CHRIST. In the midst of the Conference, some Way or other, they mentioned his going to <HI>Georgia,</HI> and said, if I would take him with me, they would engage that his Father should give Leave to have him released. — A Day or two after, Mr. <HI>Seward</HI> waited upon his Father, who gave his Son an excellent Character, and consented to his going abroad. — After this, he waited upon the Doctor, who pronounced him well.— And to Day he waited again upon the
<PB N="238" REF="004453_0237_100DA045D26EE328"/>
Committee, who behaved very civilly, and gave the young Man a Discharge.</P>
<P>He is now with me, and I hope will be an Instrument of doing good.— The Hardships he has indured at <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> will, I hope, prepare him for what he must undergo abroad. — And being now not ignorant of <HI>Satan's</HI> Devices, he will be better qualified to prevent his getting an Advantage over others. Before I leave my Account of him, I cannot help telling what Usage he met with at his first coming into <HI>Beth∣lehem.</HI>— Being sensible within himself, that he wanted no bodily Physick, he was unwilling at first to take it; upon which, four or five took hold of him, cursed him most heartily, put a Key into his Mouth, threw him upon the Bed, and said (though I had then never seen or heard of him) <HI>you are one of Whitefield's Gang,</HI> and so drenched him. — I hear also, that there was an Order given, that neither I, or any of my Friends, should be permitted to come unto him. <HI>Good GOD! how shortly will that Day come when these unhappy Men shall be heard to cry out,</HI>
<Q>We Fools counted their Lives Madness, and their Ends to be without Honour! How are they num∣bred among the Children of GOD! How is their Lot among the Saints!</Q></P>
<P>Dined at <HI>Clapham</HI> with Mr. <HI>B—n,</HI> a Quaker. Preached in the Evening at <HI>Kennington Common</HI> to about 15000 People, who were very attentive and affected. Afterwards I spent two Hours in at <HI>Fetter-lane</HI> Society, where we had a most useful Conference concerning the Necessity every
<PB N="239" REF="004453_0238_100DA048B31F72B8"/>
Christian lay under to have some particular Calling, whereby he may be a useful Member of the Society to which he belongs. — We all agreed to this unanimously; as for my own Part, I think, if a Man will not labour, neither ought he to eat. <HI>To be so intent on pursuing the one Thing needful, as to neglect providing for those of our own Housholds, in my Opinion, is to be Righteous overmuch.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, May</HI> 20. Went with our Brethren of <HI>Fetter-lane</HI> Society to <HI>St. Pauls,</HI> and received the holy Sacrament, as a Testimony that we adhered to the <HI>Church of England.</HI></P>
<P>Preached at <HI>Moorfields</HI> and <HI>Kennington Common,</HI> and at both Places collected very near fifty Pounds for the Orphan-house. A visible Alte∣ration is made in the People's Behaviour:— For though there were near fifteen Thousand in the Morning, and double the Number in the After∣noon, yet they were as quiet during my Sermon▪ as though there had not been above fifty Person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> present. — I did not meet with a Moment's Interruption. I could say of the Assembly, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Jacob</HI> did on another Occasion, <HI>Surely GOD <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this Place.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Monday, May</HI> 21.

Left <HI>London</HI> about Three, — called and prayed at a House or two in the Way, and reached <HI>Hertford</HI> between eight and nine at Night.— I never saw a Town so much alarmed. — The Streets were
<PB N="240" REF="004453_0239_100DA04BD5054578"/>
every where crouded; and by the Behaviour of some, I thought we should have had many Scoffers. — But, blessed be GOD, I never preached to a more quiet Congregation. — The Hearers were in Number about Four or Five Thousand, and the Place I preached in was a Common near the Town. Afterwards a certain Gentlewom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, <HI>Lydia</HI> like, constrained both me and my Friends▪ if we judged her worthy, to come and abide in her House that Night, which we did to our great Comfort. <HI>The LORD reward her a Thousand-fold.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Tuesday, May</HI> 22. Preached about seven in the Morning from the same Place, and to near as large a Congregation as I did last Night.— GOD gave me uncommon Power, and all, I hope, went away convinced that my Doctrine was of GOD. Breakfasted with Mr. <HI>S—ds,</HI> a Dissenting Minister, who kindly invited and received me and my Friends. Dined at <HI>Hitchen.</HI> Promised, at the Request of many, to preach to them, GOD willing, on <HI>Friday</HI> Morning, and reached <HI>Oulney</HI> about Ten at Night, where I long since promised to come. Here also GOD had prepared a Table for us; and here I was not a little comforted with meeting with the Rev. Mr. <HI>Rogers</HI> of <HI>Bedford,</HI> who, like me, has lately been thrust out of the Synagogues, for speaking of <HI>Justification by Faith,</HI> and the <HI>New Birth,</HI> and has commenced a Field-Preacher. Once he was shut in Prison for a short Time, but
<PB N="241" REF="004453_0240_100DA04D658CC330"/>
Thousands flock to hear him, and GOD blesses him more and more. <HI>I believe we are the first professed Ministers of the</HI> Church of England, <HI>that were so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and without Cause, excluded every Pulpit. Whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Brethren can justify such a Conduct, the Last Day will determine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, May</HI> 23. Being denied the Pulpit, I preached this Morning in a Field near the Town, to about two Thousand People, with much Freedom and Power. They were very attentive, and I could have continued my Dis∣course much longer; but the Bells ringing for Prayers, I adjourned my Hearers to publick Worship, where many of them went, and GOD was pleased to speak to us much in the second Lesson.— <HI>How powerfully does the Word of</HI> GOD <HI>come to our Hearts, when we experience it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Otherwise, it is a dead Letter.</HI></P>

<HEAD>NORTHAMPTON.</HEAD>
<P>Reached <HI>Northampton</HI> about Five in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Evening, and was most courteously received by Dr. <HI>Dodridge,</HI> Master of the Academy there.</P>
<P>At seven, according to Appointment, I preached to about three Thousand Hearers on a Common near the Town, from the Starting-post.—Great Power, I believe was amongst us, and I preached with wonderful Pleasure; because I thought I had then actual Possession of one of the Devil's strong Holds. <HI>Oh that we may all run so as to obtain the Crown of Life, which</HI> GOD <HI>the righteous Judge, will give, at the last Day, to all that love our</HI> LORD JESUS <HI>in Sincerity.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="004453_0241_100DA04FF8E7DB18"/><HI>Thursday, May</HI> 24. Preached again at the same Place at about Eight in the Morning, but to a much larger Audience. Breakfasted with some pious Friends. Was greatly comforted by several choice Children of GOD, who came to me from different Parts, and left <HI>Northampton</HI> about eleven, rejoycing with my Friends at the mighty Things GOD had already done, and was yet about to do for us. <HI>Many righteous Souls live in and about</HI> Northampton; <HI>and nothing confirms me more in my Opinion, that GOD intends to work a great Work upon the Earth, than to find how his Children of all Denominations every where wrestle in Prayer for me.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OULNEY.</HEAD>
<P>Being much sollicited thereto, after Sermon yesterday, I hastned, in Company with near a dozen Friends, to <HI>Oulney,</HI> eight long Miles from <HI>Northampton,</HI> and got thither about Ten of the Clock. Great Numbers were assembled toge∣ther; but on account of its being a rainy Day it was judged inconvenient to preach in the Fields. I therefore stood upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Eminence in the Street, and preached from thence with such Power as I have not for some Time experienced. Though it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all the Time, yet the People stood very attentive and patient. All, I really believe, <HI>felt,</HI> as well as <HI>heard</HI> the Word, and one was so p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icked to the Heart, and convinced of Sin, that I scarce ever saw the like Instance. <HI>The Word of GOD is quick and powerful, and sharper than a two-edged Sword.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="004453_0242_100DA0529B1C4308"/>Hasted away as fast as possible from <HI>Oulney</HI> to <HI>Bedford,</HI> where I had promised, GOD willing, to preach to Night. About seven we got thither, and found the Town fully alarmed. — About eight, I preached from the Stairs of a Wind-Mill (the Pulpit of my dear Brother and Fellow Labourer Mr. <HI>Rogers</HI>) to about three Thousand People; and GOD was pleased to give me such extraordinary Assistance, that I believe few, if any, were able to resist the Power wherewith GOD enabled me to speak. My Heart was full of GOD, and I spake as one having Authority. GOD caused me to renew my Strength, and gave me such inward Support, that my Journey did not affect me. <HI>As my Day is, so shalt my Strength be.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, May</HI> 25. Preached at Seven in the Morning with great Power, and rather a larger Congregation than before.—Took an affectionate Leave of many gracious Souls, and reached <HI>Hitchin,</HI> ten Miles from <HI>Bedford,</HI> about one of the Clock at Noon.— The Town, I perceived, was much alarmed, and many devout Souls came from far to hear me.— About two, I got upon a Table in the Market-place, near the Church; but some were pleased to ring the Bells in order to disturb us. Upon this, not having begun, we removed into a most commodious Place in the Fields; but being a little fatigued with my Ride, and the Sun beating most intensely upon my Head, I was obliged, in a sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Time, to break off, being exceeding sick and weak. — A kind Gentlewoman offered me her House, where
<PB N="244" REF="004453_0243_100DA056A4E6D6A0"/>
I went, and lay down for about two Hours, and then came and preached near the same Place, and GOD was with us.— It was surprizing to see how the Hearts of the People were knit to me.— I could have continued longer with them; but being under an Engagement to go to <HI>St. Albans,</HI> I hastned thither, but could not preach on account of my coming in so late. Great Numbers had been there expecting me; and it grieved me to think how little I could do for CHRIST. <HI>For he is a gracious Master, and had I a Thousand Lives, they should be spent in his Service.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Saturday, May</HI> 26. Had a comfortable Night's Rest, which much refreshed me. Preached at seven in the Morning to about Fifteen hundred People in a Field near the Town with great Power, and got safe to <HI>London</HI> by two in the Afternoon.— Blessed be GOD, this has been a Week of fat Things. — Many further Inroads have been made into <HI>Satan</HI>'s Kingdom.— Many Sinners convicted, and many Saints much com∣forted and established in their most holy Faith. I find there are some Thousand secret ones yet living amongst us, that have not bowed the Knee to <HI>Baal,</HI> and this publick Way of acting brings them out. It much comforts me, where∣ever I go, to see so many of GOD's Children, of all Communions, come and wish me good Luck in the Name of the LORD. I perceive People would be every where willing to hear, if
<PB N="245" REF="004453_0244_100DA0583865F530"/>
the Ministers were ready to teach the Truth as it is in JESUS. <HI>LORD, do thou spirit up more of my dear Friends and Fellow Labourers to go out into the Highways and Hedges, to compel poor Sinners to come in.</HI> Amen.</P>
<P>Received an excellent Letter from the Rev. Mr. <HI>Ebenezer Erskine</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Brother to Mr. <HI>Ralph Erskine,</HI> acquainting me of his preaching last Week to Fourteen Thousand People. <HI>Blessed be GOD, there are more Field-Preachers in the World besides myself. The</HI> LORD <HI>furnish us all with spiritual Food wherewith to feed so great Multitudes.</HI></P>
<P>Preached in the Evening at <HI>Kennington Common</HI> to about Fifteen Thousand People, and we had an extraordinary Presence of GOD amongst us. <HI>Oh! that all who object against this Way of Preaching, would come and see, — all sincere Persons must go convicted away.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, May</HI> 27. Preached this Morning at <HI>Moorfields</HI> to about Twenty Thousand, and GOD manifested himself still more and more. My Discourse was near two Hours long. My Heart was full of Love; and People were so melted down on every Side, that the greatest Scoffer must have owned that this was the Finger of GOD. Went twice to public Worship, received the blessed Sacrament, and preached, as usual, in the Evening at <HI>Kennington Common,</HI> to about the same Number of People as I did last Lord's Day. Perceived I was a little hoarse; but GOD strengthned me to speak so as not only to be heard, but felt by most that stood near me. <HI>Glory be to GOD on high.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="004453_0245_100DA05A8E0AA290"/><HI>Monday, May</HI> 28. Preached, after earnest and frequent Invitation, at <HI>Hackney,</HI> in a Field belonging to one Mr. <HI>Rudge,</HI> to about Ten Thousand People. — I insisted much upon the Reasonableness of the Doctrine of the <HI>New Birth,</HI> and the Necessity of our receiving the Holy Ghost in its sanctifying Gifts and Graces, as well now as formerly. GOD was pleased to impress it most deeply upon the Hearers. Great Numbers were drowned in Tears; and I could not help exposing the Impiety of those Letter-learned Teachers, who say, We are not now to receive the Holy Ghost, and count the Doctrine of the <HI>New Birth,</HI> ENTHUSIASM. <HI>Out of your own Mouths will I condemn you, you wicked and blind Guides. Did you not, at the Time of Or∣dination, tell the Bishop, that you were inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost, to take upon you the Administration of the Church? Surely, at that Time, you acted the Crime of</HI> Ananias <HI>and</HI> Sapphir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>You lyed not unto Man, but unto GOD.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, May</HI> 29. Went to publick Service at <HI>Westminster Abbey.</HI> Afterwards dispatched Business for my Orphans, and preached at <HI>Kennington</HI> to a most devout Auditory with much Sweetness and Power. The Subject I treated of, was our LORD's Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes; and I hope he who fed so many Thousands with bodily Bread, did feed my Hearers Souls with the Bread of Life which cometh down from Heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="004453_0246_100DA05E11941770"/><HI>Wednesday, May</HI> 30. Waited upon the Bishop of <HI>Bristol</HI> (who treated me with the utmost Civility) and received his Lordship's Benefaction for <HI>Georgia.</HI> At the Request of many, I preached in the Evening at <HI>Newington Common,</HI> to about fifteen Thousand People. A most com∣modious Place was erected for me to preach from. The Word came with Power; and seeing a great Multitude, I thought proper to collect for the Orphan-house. Sixteen Pounds nine Shil∣lings and four Pence were gathered on that Occasion. <HI>Blessed be the Lord for thus prospering the Work of my Hands upon me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, May</HI> 31. Was taken very ill this Afternoon; but GOD was pleased to strengthen me to go to <HI>Kennington,</HI> where I preached to my usual Congregation; and three of my Brethren in the Ministry were pleased to accompany me, which filled the People with exceeding great Joy. <HI>Thou LORD of the Harvest, send forth, we beseech Thee, more Labourers into thy Har∣vest.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, June</HI> 1. Dined at <HI>Oldford,</HI> — gave a short Exhortation to a few People in a Field, and preached in the Evening at a Place called <HI>Mayfair,</HI> near <HI>Hyde-Park Corner.</HI> — The Congregation, I believe, consisted of near Eighty Thousand People.— It was, by far, the largest I ever preached to yet.— In the Time of my Prayer there was a little Noise? but they kept a deep Silence during my whole Discourse. An high and very commodious Scaffold was erected for me to stand upon; and though I was
<PB N="248" REF="004453_0247_100DA0608E241630"/>
weak in myself, yet GOD strengthned me to speak so loud that most could hear, and so powerfully, that most, I believe, could feel. <HI>All Love, all Glory be to God, through</HI> CHRIST.</P>

It rained some considerable Time, but almost all were unmoved; and I was so enlarged, by talking of the Love and Free Grace of JESUS CHRIST, that I could have continued my Discourse till Midnight. <HI>This Promise, They that wait on the Lord shall renew their Strength, is fulfilled in me daily.

When I mentioned my Departure from them, they were melted into Tears. — Thousands of Ejaculations and fervent Prayers were poured out to GOD on my Behalf, which gave me abundant Reason to be thankful to my dear Master. <HI>Oh what marvellous great Kindness has GOD shewn me in this great City! Indeed I have seen the Kingdom of GOD come with Power, and cannot but say, Blessed are the Eyes which see the Things that we see, and hear the Things which we hear; for many righteous Souls have desired to see the Things which we see, and to hear the Things which we hear, and have not heard them.</HI> I now go, I trust, under the Conduct of GOD's Holy Spirit, to <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Georgia,</HI> knowing not what will befal me, save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every Place, that Labours, Afflictions, and Trials of all Kinds abide me.
