<P>The Comet that appeared in 1680. comes to an Op∣position of <HI>Mars,</HI> and to a Quartile of <HI>Sol</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> in the great Conjunction 1603. <HI>Spain</HI> now and <HI>Portugal</HI> suffer much by the Sword, Plague, and scarcity of Food: <HI>France</HI> is still at division among themselves, that King∣dom is nigh to an Universal Catastrophe, many of her Towns will be laid wast now near these times.</P>

Oh! what Consultations are there, how to cut off the <HI>Pro∣testant</HI> Party by a Massacre, or some such means? but they shall make the Proverb good, <HI>he that diggeth a Pit for another, shall fall in it himself</HI>; for they have been the chief cause of all <HI>Europ's</HI> Troubles that are now on Foot, the Troubles that were from 1672 to 1682, were nothing to these that are like to be about these times, indeed the Trine of <HI>Saturn</HI> &amp; <HI>Jupiter</HI> last Year, did cause a great many to endeavour for to make a Reconci∣liation of those differences, but the Animosities among men were so great, that they were not able to compleat any thing; but it is possible, that some League was made there between some Princes, to joyn against others, <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Jupiter</HI> make this Year there first Opposition from <HI>Sagitarius</HI> and <HI>Gemini, Saturn</HI> being in 5.48 of <HI>Sa∣gitarius,</HI> and <HI>Jupiter</HI> in 5.48 of <HI>Gemini, Saturn</HI> being so near the place of the great <HI>Conjunction</HI> 1603, and there is opposed by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> this brings strange and unheard of Translations upon the Stage of the World: <HI>Spain</HI> still is a looser, and drinks deep of the Cup of affliction.

<P>IN this Year 1693. <HI>Mercury</HI> in the great Conjunction, comes to the Quartile of the Conjunction it self. And in this Year <HI>(viz) April</HI> the 22d. day, <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Jupiter</HI> make the third and last Opposition, <HI>Saturn</HI> be∣ing in 21.16. of <HI>Sagitarius,</HI> and <HI>Jupiter</HI> 21 16. And there is also an Opposition of <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Mars,</HI> in <HI>July</HI> following, <HI>Saturn</HI> 16.0 in <HI>Sagitarius,</HI> and <HI>Mars</HI> 16 in <HI>Ge∣mini:</HI> There are also Four Eclypses of the <HI>Luminaries</HI> this Year, two of the Sun, and two of the Moon; the first is of the <HI>Moon</HI> on <HI>January</HI> the 12th. day, at 4 of the Clock in the Morning in 1 degree of <HI>Leo</HI> visible, and a great one; the second will be of the Sun on the 23d. day of <HI>June</HI> near Noon, in 12 degrees of <HI>Cancer,</HI> this will be a very great Eclypse as has happened this 40 Years; the third will be of the <HI>Moon July</HI> the 7th. near 10 of the Clock in the Morning, in 25 degrees of <HI>Cancer</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the last will be of the <HI>Sun</HI> on <HI>December</HI> the 16th. day a Mid-night, it will be a great Eclypse, but not visible.</P>
<P>The Judgment of this Year differs but little from the last. <HI>Bohemia</HI> is afflicted with a scarcity of Grain and other Pro∣vision fit for Food. The Comit that appeared in 1680, has lately passed the Quartile of <HI>Saturn, Saturn</HI> is in <HI>Can∣cer</HI> and the Comit in <HI>Aries:</HI> Hence are <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scot∣land</HI> concerned, the last time that <HI>Saturn</HI> was in Opposi∣tion of <HI>Jupiter</HI> was in the Year 1634, and then there was a great Plague in <HI>Rome,</HI> some such like Distemper will rage there this Year, a great many of the great men will dye of that place, whether Cardinals or Popes, let time declare, they have before now had 2 or 3 Popes in a Year, I also fear that a many Towns about in <HI>England,</HI> will have a Plague or some Distemper as bad. <HI>Spain, Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> are still in a distraction, what must <HI>Spain</HI> still be a loser? Those places under <HI>Cancer</HI>

The City <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must expect to have share of this years Transactions, if some of thy <HI>Magistrates</HI> should be brought to <HI>Justice,</HI> then say I am a true Pro∣phet, many Villainies will be acted in thee, some Plots will be discovered, and the Actors brought to <HI>Punishment.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1694" TYPE="prediction">
<HEAD>Of the Astrological Judgment of the YEAR, <HI>1694.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN this Year there is no direction of the great <HI>Conjunction</HI> 1603, nor of the New Star 1604, but we have a nota∣ble <HI>Conjunction</HI> of <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Mars, December</HI> the 10, in 6 degrees of <HI>Capricornus.</HI> Besides there is a visible Eclypse of the Sun, in Opposition to the <HI>Conjunction</HI> of <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Mars</HI>▪ on the 12th. day of <HI>June</HI> at 5 of the Clock at Night. The second Eclypse of the Sun is on <HI>December</HI> 6, at 5 of the Clock at Night, in 25 degrees of <HI>Sagitarius,</HI> the place of the Sun in the great <HI>Conjunction.</HI> The first Eclypse of the Moon is <HI>January</HI> the first day at Noon, in 22 degrees of <HI>Cancer,</HI> not visible. The second of the Moon falls on the 26th. of <HI>June</HI> at 12 of the Clock at Night in 15 degrees of <HI>Capricornus.</HI></P>
<P>From these foregoing Configurations, I draw these fol∣lowing Judgments. The <HI>Sweeds</HI> and <HI>Tartarians</HI> are up in Arms, and so are the <HI>Muscovites</HI>; the <HI>Tartar</HI> Invades <HI>Mus∣covy, and brings great Calamity upon that Country</HI>; the <HI>Dane</HI> or some other Country invades <HI>Sweedland</HI>▪ there shall be a great destruction to a many Cities, and a great slaughter of their Inhabitants; the <HI>Hollender</HI> draws near to an end of that maner of way of Government▪ yet shall no Crown'd head ever conquer it, <HI>the Change will come by the Peoples Consent.

<P>IN this Year we have no Directions of the great <HI>Conjunct∣ion,</HI> nor of the New Star 1604, that are considerable; therefore we look to the other Configurations of the Planets and Eclypses. We have a famous Opposition of <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Mars, Saturn</HI> being in 8 degrees of <HI>Capricornus,</HI> and <HI>Mars</HI> 8 degrees in <HI>Cancer,</HI> it falls on the 12th. of <HI>Au∣gust.</HI> There are four Eclypses this Year. The first is of the Moon, which falls on <HI>May</HI> the 18th. day at 10 of the Clock in the Morning, in 7 degrees of <HI>Sagitarius</HI> the place of the great Conjunction 1603, but not visible. The second will be of the Sun on the first of <HI>June</HI> at 5 of the Clock at Night, in 21 degrees of <HI>Gemini,</HI> the Ascendant of <HI>London</HI> and visible. The third will be of the Moon on <HI>November</HI> the 10th. day <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 8 of the Clock at Night, in 28 degrees of <HI>Taurus,</HI> near the <HI>Pleiades</HI> and visible.

<P>From these Configurations, I find that the <HI>Sweed</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Arms against a <HI>Potent Enemy</HI> the <HI>Tarter,</HI> both afflic<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the <HI>Muscovite</HI> and the <HI>Polander,</HI> he doth great mischief <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Christendom, (viz)</HI> he will destroy a great many Towns in

those Countries lying next him, and carry their People Captive. The Eclypse of the Sun in <HI>Sagitarius</HI> brings great affliction to <HI>Spain,</HI> with the destruction of their small and great Cattel, great Out-rages, and Robberies, and Inhumane Murthers committed in <HI>Hungaria, Dal∣matia,</HI> yea, and in <HI>England</HI> too, if not in <HI>London</HI>; it de∣clares the Death of a many of the Nobility in these pla∣ces under <HI>Gemini, Mars</HI> is Lord of the Ascendant of the figure of the Eclypse, and is in <HI>Taurus</HI> in Opposition to it, from whence may be expected popular Insurrections in those places under <HI>Gemini; Ireland</HI> cannot as yet be free from trouble, nor <HI>Holland, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Burgundy.</HI></P>
<P>In this Year <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Jupiter</HI> makes their first Trine from <HI>Capricornus</HI> and <HI>Virgo, Saturn</HI> being in 8.8. of <HI>Ca∣pricornus,</HI> and <HI>Jupiter</HI> in 8.8. of <HI>Virgo,</HI> this Trine were it not for the weakness of <HI>Jupiter</HI> might produce peace to the World, there will be great Meetings and Trea∣ties for Peace, but the strength of <HI>Saturn</HI> and the Con∣junctions of <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Mars</HI> in <HI>Capricornus,</HI> hinders the good design of <HI>Saturn,</HI> and instead of Peace, flings <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> in worse<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Broyls than before.</P>

<P>IN this Year we have no Directions of the great Con∣junction, only we have the Mid heaven of the ap∣pearance of the New Star 1604, to this Conjunction of <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Jupiter</HI> 1682, we have also a famous Conjunction of <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Mars</HI> in 18 degrees of <HI>A∣quarius</HI> in Opposition to the Conjunction 1682, &amp; 1683. There is also a famous Conjunction of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Mars</HI> in 22 degrees of <HI>Scorpio, August</HI> 29. We have also two Eclypses of the Sun, the one in <HI>Aries, England's</HI> Sign, the other <HI>Libra.</HI> The first falls <HI>March</HI> the 31st. at 7 of the Clock at Night. in 21 degrees of <HI>Aries</HI> not visible.
