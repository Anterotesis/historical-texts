<P>TWenty Three Years have Rolled a∣way since the Nations of Indians within the Confines of <HI>New England,</HI> generally began a Fierce <HI>War,</HI> upon the <HI>English</HI> Inhabitants of that Country. The Flame of <HI>War</HI> then Raged thro' a great part of

Onely, the Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of our Northern and Eastern Regions in that <HI>War,</HI> was very dist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent from that of the rest.

<P N="2">2. Because they were Invaded in their <HI>Fishery,</HI> at <HI>Saco</HI> River, by certain Gentlemen, who stop'd the <HI>Fish,</HI> from coming up the River, with, their <HI>Nets,</HI> and <HI>Sains.</HI> This they were greatly Affronted at; saying, <HI>They thought (though the English had got away their Lands as they had, yet) the Fishery of the Rivers had been a priviledge Reserved Entire unto themselves.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Because they were Abused by the <HI>English,</HI> in Suffering, if not Turning, their Cattel over to a c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtain Island to destroy their Corn.</P>
<P N="4">4. But the <HI>Fourth,</HI> and <HI>Main,</HI> provocation was, the Granting, or <HI>Pattenting</HI> of their Lands, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> English; at which they were greatly Enraged; threatning the Surveyor, to knock him on the Head, if he came to lay out any Lands there.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="16" REF="000873_0015_0FAC92BEE1D3D9E0"/>
5. To these may be added, the Common Abuses, in <HI>Trading; viz.</HI> Drunkenness, mean∣ing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which such as Trade much with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are seldom Innocent of.</P></Q>
<P>Doubtless, these <HI>Indian</HI> Allegations may be an∣swered with many <HI>English</HI> Vindications. But I shall at present Intermeddle no further <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to offer another Account, which also I have in my Hands, written by a Gentleman of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>It runs in such Terms as these.</P>
<Q><P>Many were the Outrages and Insultings of the <HI>Indians</HI> upon the <HI>English,</HI> while Sir <HI>E. A.</HI> was Governour. At <HI>North Yarmouth,</HI> and other places at the Eastward, the Indians killed sundry Cattel, came into Houses, and threatned to knock the people on the Head; and at several Times gave out Reports, that they would make a <HI>War</HI> upon the <HI>English,</HI> and that they were ani∣mated to do so, by the <HI>French.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> behaving themselves so insultingly, gave just occasion of great suspicion. In order for the finding out the <HI>Truth,</HI> and to Endeavour the preventing of a <HI>War,</HI> Capt. <HI>Blackman,</HI> a Justice of Peace, with some of the Neighbourhood, of <HI>Saco</HI> River, Seized several <HI>Indians</HI> that had been bloody murderous <HI>Rogues,</HI> in the first <HI>In¦dian War</HI>; being the chief Ring Leaders, and most capable to do mischief. The said Capt. <HI>Blackman</HI> Seized to the Number of between Sixteen and Twenty, in order for their Ex∣amination,
<PB N="17" REF="000873_0016_0FAC92BF9FCA88D8"/>
and to bring in the rest to a Treaty. The said <HI>Blackman</HI> soon sent the said <HI>Indians,</HI> with a Good Guard, to <HI>Falmouth,</HI> in <HI>Casco bay,</HI> there to be Secured, until orders could come from <HI>Boston,</HI> concerning them. And in the mean Time, the said <HI>Indians,</HI> were well provided with Provisions, and Suitable Necessaries The rest of the Indians Robb'd the English, and took some English Prisoners: Whereupon Post was sent to <HI>Boston.</HI> Sir <HI>Edmond Andross</HI> being at <HI>New-York,</HI> the Gentlemen of <HI>Boston</HI> sent to <HI>Falmouth,</HI> some Souldiers for the Defence of the Country, and also the Worshipful Mr. <HI>Stoughton,</HI> with others, to Treat with the <HI>Indians,</HI> in order for the Settling of a <HI>Peace,</HI> and getting in of our English Captives. As soon as the said Gentle∣men arrived at the East-ward, they sent away one of the <HI>Indian</HI> Prisoners, to the rest of the <HI>Indians,</HI> to Summon them, to bring in the Eng∣lish they had taken; Also, that their <HI>Sachims</HI> should come in, to treat with the English, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rder that a Just Satisfaction should be made on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth sides. The Gentlemen waited the Return of the <HI>Indian</HI> Messenger; and when he Return∣ed, he brought Answer, That they would meet our English at a place, called, <HI>Macquoit,</HI> and there they would bring in the English Captives, and Treat with the English. And although the place appointed by the <HI>Indians,</HI> for the Meeting, was some Leagues distant from <HI>Fal∣mouth,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="000873_0017_0FAC92C259992960"/>
yet our English Gentlemen did conde∣scend to it, in hope of getting in our Captives, &amp; putting a stop to further Trouble. They Dis∣patch'd away to the place, and carried the <HI>In∣dian</HI> Prisoners with them, and staid at the place appointed, expecting the coming of the <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> that had promised a Meeting. But they like false perfidious Rogues did not appear. Without doubt they had been counselled what to do, by the <HI>French,</HI> and their Abettors; as the <HI>Indians</HI> did declare a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terwards; and that they were near the place, and saw our <HI>English,</HI> that were to Treat with them, but would not shew themselves, but did Endeavour to take an Opportunity to Destroy our English, that were to Treat them. Such was their Treachery! Our Gentlemen staid days to wait their co∣ming; but seeing they did not appear at the place appointed, they Returned to <HI>Falmouth,</HI> and brought the Indian Prisoners; expecting that the other <HI>Indians</HI> would have sent down some Reason, why they did not appear at the place appointed, and to make some excuse for themselves. But instead of any compliance, they fell upon <HI>North Yarmouth,</HI> and there kill'd several of our English. Whereupon the East∣ern parts were ordered to get into Garrisons, and to be upon their Guard, until further Or∣ders from Sir <HI>Edmond Andros</HI>; and that the In∣dian Prisoners should be sent to <HI>Boston</HI>; which
<PB N="19" REF="000873_0018_0FAC92C3AD6FED70"/>
was done with great care, and not one of them hurt; and care taken daily for provision. But Sir <HI>E. A.</HI> Returning from <HI>New-York,</HI> set them all at Liberty; not so much as taking care to Redeem those of our <HI>English</HI> for them, that were in their hands. I had kept one at <HI>Fal∣mouth,</HI> a Prisoner to be a Guide into the Woods, for our English, to find out the Haunts of our Heathen Enemies. But Sir <HI>E. A.</HI> sent an Ex∣press to me, that upon my utmost peril, I should set the said Indian at Liberty, and take care that all the Arms, that were taken from him, and all the rest of those Capt. <HI>Blackman</HI> had Seized, should be delivered up to them, without any Orders to Receive the like of ours from them.</P></Q>
<P>It will be readily Acknowledged, that here was enough done, to render the <HI>Indians</HI> Inexcu∣sable, for not coming in, upon the <HI>Proclamation,</HI> which Sir <HI>Edmond Andros,</HI> then Governour of <HI>New-England,</HI> immediately Emitted thereupon, requiring them, to Surrender the <HI>Murderers,</HI> now among them. A Spaniard, that was a Souldier, would say, <HI>That if we have a Good Cause, the smell of Gunpowder in the Field is as sweet as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncense at the Altar.</HI> Let the Reader judge after these things, what scent there was in the <HI>Gun∣powder</HI> spent for Nine or Ten years together in our <HI>War</HI> with the <HI>Indian Salvages.</HI></P>
<P>Now, that while we are upon this Head, we
<PB N="20" REF="000873_0019_0FAC92C474A4BAF8"/>
may at once dispatch it, I will unto these Two Accounts, add certain passages of one more; which was published in <HI>September</HI> 1689.</P>
<P><Q>Such were the <HI>Obscure Measures</HI> taken at that Time of Day, that the <HI>Rise</HI> of this <HI>War,</HI> hath been as dark as that of the River <HI>Nilus</HI>; only the Generality of <HI>Thinking People</HI> through the Country, can Remember <HI>When,</HI> and <HI>Why,</HI> every one did foretel, <HI>A War.</HI> If any <HI>Wild English</HI> (for there are such as well as of another Na∣tion,) did then, <HI>Begin</HI> to Provoke and Affront the <HI>Indians,</HI> yet those <HI>Indians</HI> had a fairer way to come by Right, than that of <HI>Blood shed</HI>; no∣thing worthy of, or calling for, any <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch</HI> Re∣venge was done unto them. The most <HI>Injured</HI> of them all, (if there were any <HI>Such</HI>) were af∣terwards dismissed by the <HI>English,</HI> with Favours, that were then Admirable even to <HI>Our selves</HI>; and <HI>These</HI> too, instead of Surrendring the <HI>Per∣sons,</HI> did increase the <HI>Numbers,</HI> of the <HI>Murderers</HI>▪ But upon the REVOLUTION of the Govern∣ment [<HI>April</HI> 1689.] the <HI>State of the War,</HI> be∣came wholly <HI>New</HI>: and we are more arrived unto <HI>Righteousness as the Light,</HI> and <HI>Justice as the Noon day.</HI> A great <HI>Sachim</HI> of the East, we the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> immediatel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Applied ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> selves unto, and with no small Expences to our selves▪ we Engaged <HI>Him,</HI> to Employ his Interest for a Good Un∣derstanding between us, &amp; the party of <HI>Indians</HI> then in Hostility against us▪ <HI>This</HI> was the <HI>Likely,</HI>

the <HI>Only</HI> way, of coming at those Wandring Salvages: But That very <HI>Sachim</HI> now treache∣rously, of an <HI>Embassador</HI> became a <HI>Traitor,</HI> and annexed himself, with his People, to the <HI>Heard</HI> of our Enemies, which have since been Ravag∣ing, Pillaging, and Murdering at a rate, which we ought to count, <HI>Intolerable.</HI> The <HI>Penacook</HI> Indians, of whom we were Jealous, we likewise Treated with; and while we were, by our <HI>Kindnesses</HI> and <HI>Courtesies</HI> Endeavouring to render them utterly Inexcusable, if ever they sought our Harm: Even <HI>Then</HI> did <HI>These</HI> also, by some <HI>Evil Instigation (the Devils,</HI> no doubt!) quickly Surprize a Plantation, where they had been Civilly treated a Day or Two before, &amp; Commit at once, more <HI>Plunder</HI> and <HI>Murder,</HI> than can be heard with any patience.</Q></P>
<P>Reader, Having so placed these Three Ac∣counts as to defend my <HI>Teeth,</HI> I think, I may safely proceed with our Story. But because <HI>Tacitus</HI> teaches us, to distinguish between, the meer <HI>Occasions,</HI> and the real <HI>Causes,</HI> of a <HI>War,</HI> it may be some will go a little Higher up in their Enquiries: They will Enquire, whether no body Seized a parcel of <HI>Wines,</HI> that were Landed at a French Plantation to the East ward? Whether an Order were not obtained from the King of <HI>England,</HI> at the Instance of the French Embassa∣dor, to Restore these <HI>Wines</HI>?

Whe∣ther Monsieur St. <HI>Caste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> flying from our En∣croachments, we did not Seize upon his Arms, and Goods, and bring them away to <HI>Pemmaquid?</HI> And, <HI>Who,</HI> were the <HI>We,</HI> which did these things? And whether, the <HI>Indians,</HI> who were Extremely under the Influence of St. <HI>Casteen,</HI> that had Mar∣ried a Sagamores Daughter among them, did not from this very Moment begin to be obstre∣perous? And, whether all the Sober English in the Country, did not from this very Moment, foretel a <HI>War?</HI> But for any Answer to all these Enquiries, I will be my self a <HI>Tacitus.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE. II. The first Acts of Hostility, between the <HI>Indians,</HI> and the <HI>English.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHen one Capt. <HI>Sargeant</HI> had Seized some of the principal <HI>Indians</HI> about <HI>Saco,</HI> by order of Justice <HI>Blackman,</HI> presently the <HI>Indians</HI> fell to Seizing as many of the <HI>English,</HI> as they could catch. Capt. <HI>Rowden,</HI> with many more, in one place, and Capt. <HI>Gendal,</HI> with sundry more, in another place, particularly fell into the Hands of these desperate <HI>Man catchers. Rowden,</HI> with many of his Folks, never got out of their
<PB N="23" REF="000873_0022_0FAC92C663DB2360"/>
Cruel Hands: but <HI>Gendal</HI> with his, got a Re∣lease, one can scarce tell, <HI>How,</HI> upon the Re∣turn of those which had been detain'd in <HI>Boston.</HI> Hitherto there was no Spilling of <HI>Blood</HI>! But some Time in <HI>September</HI> following, this Capt. <HI>Gen∣dal,</HI> went up, with Souldiers and others, to a place above <HI>Casco,</HI> called, <HI>North Yarmouth</HI>; having Orders to build <HI>Stookado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> on both sides the Ri∣ver, for Defence of the place, in case of any Sud∣den Invasion. While they were at work, an <HI>English Captive</HI> came to 'em, with Information, that Seventy or Eighty of the Enemy were just coming upon 'em: and he advised 'em, <HI>To yeeld quietly, that they might Save their Lives.</HI> The Souldiers that went thither from the Southward, being terrifyed at this Report, Ran with an Hasty Terror to get over the River; but with more <HI>Hast,</HI> than <HI>Good Speed</HI>; for they ran directly into the Hands of the <HI>Indians.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> dragging along these their Prisoners with 'em, came up to∣wards the <HI>Casconians</HI>; who, having but a very Little Time to Consult, yet in this Time Resolved; First, <HI>That they would not be Seized by the Salvages</HI>; Next, <HI>That they would free their Friends out of the Hands of the Salvages, if it were possible</HI>; Thirdly, <HI>That if it were possible, they would use all other Force upon the Salvages, without coming to down right Fight.</HI> Accordingly, They laid hold on their Neighbours, whom the <HI>Salvages</HI> had Seized, and this with so much Dexterity, that
<PB N="24" REF="000873_0023_0FAC92C7268D3F58"/>
they cleared them all, Except one or Two; whereof the whole Number was about a <HI>Dozen.</HI> But in the <HI>Scuffle,</HI> one Sturdy and Surly <HI>Indian,</HI> held his prey so fast, that one <HI>Benedict Pulcifer,</HI> gave the <HI>Mastiff</HI> a Blow, with the Edge of his <HI>Broad Ax</HI> upon the Shoulder, upon which they fell to't with a Vengeance, and Fired their <HI>Guns,</HI> on both sides, till some on both sides were Slain. These were, as one may call them, <HI>The Scower-pit,</HI> of a long <HI>War</HI> to follow. At last, the <HI>English,</HI> Victoriously chased away the Salvages, and Re∣turned safely unto the other side of the River. And Thus was the <HI>Vein</HI> of <HI>New England</HI> first o∣pened, that afterwards <HI>Bled</HI> for Ten years toge∣ther! The Skirmish being over, Capt. <HI>Gendal,</HI> in the Evening, passed over the River, in a Ca∣noo, with none but a Servant; but Landing where the Enemy lay hid in the Bushes, they were both Slain immediately. And the same Evening, one <HI>Ryal,</HI> with another man, fell un∣awares into the Hands of the Enemy; <HI>Ryal</HI> was afterwards Ransomed, by Monsieur St. <HI>Casteen,</HI> but the other man, was barbarously Butchered. Soon after this, the Enemy went Eastward, unto a place call'd, <HI>Merry Meeting,</HI> (from the Con∣course of diverse Rivers there,) where several English had a <HI>Sad Meeting</HI> with them; for they were killed, several of them even in Cold Blood, after the <HI>Indians</HI> had Seized upon their Houses &amp; their Persons. And about this Time, the Town

The People saved them∣selves by getting into the Fort, all but one Man, who going out of the Fort, for to Treat with 'em, was Treacherously Assassinated. Thus the place, which was counted, <HI>The Garden of the East,</HI> was infested by <HI>Serpents</HI>; and a <HI>Sword</HI> Expell'd the poor Inhabitants. Little more Spoil was done by the <HI>Salvages</HI> before <HI>Winter,</HI> Except only, that at a place called <HI>Kennebunk,</HI> near <HI>Winter harbour,</HI> they cut off Two Families, to wit, <HI>Barrows,</HI> and <HI>Bussies</HI>; but <HI>Winter</HI> coming on, the <HI>Serpents</HI> retired into their Holes.

Sir <HI>Edmond Andros,</HI> the Governour of <HI>New-England,</HI> that he might Express his Resolutions, to force the Wild Beasts of the East into order, in the <HI>Winter</HI> now come∣ing on, turned upon them as Effectual a <HI>Machin,</HI> as the <HI>Green Dragon</HI> of <HI>Florence</HI>; that is to say, An Army of near a Thousand men. With this Army, he marched himself in Person, into the <HI>Caucasaean</HI> Regions, where he built a Fort at <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> and another Fort at <HI>Pechypscot</HI> Falls, besides the Fort at <HI>Sheepscot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</HI> He, and his <HI>Army,</HI> underwent no little Hard ship, thus in the Depth of <HI>Winter</HI> to Expose themselves unto the Cir∣cumstances of a <HI>Campaign,</HI> in all the Bleak <HI>Winds</HI> and Thick <HI>Snows</HI> of that Northern Country.

Shedding of <HI>Blood</HI> by an ungoverned <HI>Mobile,</HI> some of the Gentlemen present, should appear at the Head of it, with a <HI>Declaration</HI> accordingly prepared.

<P>THE <HI>Sun,</HI> and the <HI>War,</HI> be again Returning! The year 1690. must begin, very Inaus∣piciously. In <HI>February,</HI> the <HI>French,</HI> with <HI>Indians,</HI> made a Descent from <HI>Canada,</HI> upon a Dutch Town called <HI>Sch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nectada,</HI> Twenty Miles above <HI>Albany</HI> under the Government of <HI>New York</HI>; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n that Surprizing Incursion, they killed about Sixty Persons, whereof one was their Minister, and carried about Half as many into Captivity; but the People there, assisted by the <HI>Maqua's,</HI> pursued them, and Recovered some of their Captives from them. Upon the Advice of this Mischief in the <HI>West,</HI> order was dispatch'd unto Major <HI>Frost,</HI> in the <HI>East,</HI> that the Towns there should stand upon their Guard. The Major did <HI>his</HI> Duty; but <HI>they</HI> did not Theirs: They Dream't that while the Deep Snow of the <HI>Win∣ter</HI> continued, they were Safe enough; but this prov'd as Vain as a <HI>Dream of a Dry Summer.</HI>

<HEAD>ARTICLE VIII. A Little Account of the Greatest Action, that ever <HI>New-England</HI> Attempted.</HEAD>
<P>I have Read or Heard, That when the Insuf∣ferable Abuses, which the English Nation suffered from the <HI>Abbeys,</HI> were in the Parliament complained of, the Total Dissolution of those <HI>Abbeys,</HI> was much forwarded, by a Speech of a Gentleman in the <HI>House of Commons,</HI> to this pur∣pose; That his own House had been much annoy'd by <HI>Rooks</HI> building in a <HI>Tree,</HI> near unto it, and that he had used many ineffectual way<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to disturb, and difroost these mischievous <HI>Rooks</HI> until at Last, he found out an <HI>infallible way</HI> to be delivered from the <HI>Rooks,</HI> and that was to cut down the <HI>Tree</HI> that Lodged 'em.

without any Hope of seeing an End of these Trou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lesome <HI>Tragedies.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> Co∣lonies to the Northward, were the <HI>Tree,</HI> in which those <HI>Rooks</HI> had their <HI>Nests</HI>; and the <HI>French</HI> ha∣ving in person first fallen upon the <HI>English</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> it was thought that the <HI>New-Eng∣landers</HI> might very justly take this Occasion, to Reduce those <HI>French</HI> Colonies under the English Government, and so at once take away from all the <HI>Rooks</HI> for ever, all that gave 'em any Ad∣vantage to Infest us. Accordingly, a <HI>Naval Force,</HI> with about Seven Hundred men, under the Conduct of Sr. <HI>William Phips,</HI> was dispatch'd away to <HI>L'accady,</HI> and <HI>Nova Scotia.</HI> This Fleet, setting Sail from <HI>New England, April</HI> 28. 1690. in a Fortnight Arrived at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> and Sir <HI>William</HI> having the Fort Surrendred unto him, took Possession of that Province, for the Crown of <HI>England.</HI> But this was only a step towards a far greater Action!

<P><PB N="62" REF="000873_0061_0FAC92EA663A1A30"/>In the very year, when the <HI>Massachuset<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Colo∣ny began, the English Attempted the Conquest of <HI>Canada,</HI> and though the <HI>First</HI> Attempt miscar∣ried, the <HI>Second</HI> prospered.

<P>While a Colony was forming it self at <HI>Canada,</HI> an English Fleet was Equipp'd, in the year, 1628. under the Command of Admiral <HI>Kirk,</HI> with a Design to take Possession of that Country. In their Vogage, having taken a French Ship, at the Isle <HI>Percee,</HI> they Sailed up the River, as far as <HI>Tadousac,</HI> where they found a Bark, in which they set ashore some Souldiers, to Seize on Cape <HI>Tourment.</HI> And here a Couple of Salvages dis∣covering them, ran away to advise the people of <HI>Quebeck,</HI> that the English were approaching. When the Fleet arrived, the Admiral Summon∣ed the Town to Surrender by a Letter to Mon∣sieur <HI>Champelin,</HI> the Governour: But the Go∣vernour notwithstanding his being so Surprised with the Invasion, made such a Resolute Answer, that the English, (though as the Historian says, <HI>they are a People that wilt sooner Dy than quit what they once undertake</HI>) did conclude the Fort <HI>Que∣beck,</HI> was in a much better Condition for De∣fence than it really was; and therefore desisting from any further Attempt at this Time, they returned into <HI>England,</HI> with Resolution further
<PB N="63" REF="000873_0062_0FAC92EB2A53D0C0"/>
to pursue their Design at a more favourable Op∣portunity.</P>
<P>Accordingly, on <HI>July</HI> 19. 1629. in the Morn∣ing, the <HI>English Fleet</HI> appear'd again, over against the Great Bay of <HI>Quebeck,</HI> at the point of the Isle of <HI>Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eans</HI>; which Fleet Consisted of Three men of War, and Six other Vessels. Admiral <HI>Kirk</HI> sending a Summons form'd in very Civil Expressions, for the Surrender of the Place, the miserable State of the Country, which had been by the English Interceptions, hindred of Supplies from <HI>France,</HI> for Two years together, oblig'd the Sieur <HI>Champelin</HI> to make a softer Answer, than he did before▪ He sent Father <HI>Joseph Le Caron,</HI> aboard the Admir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l to treat about the Surrender, and none of his Demands for Fifteen Dayes, and then for Five Dayes, Time to Consider on't, could obtain any longer Time, than till the E∣vening, to prepare their <HI>Articles.</HI> Upon the De∣livery of this Message, a Council was held, wherein some urged, that the English had no more than Two Hundred men, of Regular Troops aboard, and some others which had not much of the Air of Souldiers; and that the Courage of the Inhabitants was much to be reli∣ed upon, and therefore it was best for to run the risk of a Siege: But Monsieur <HI>Champelin,</HI> apprehending the Bravery of the English, re∣monstrated unto the Council, that it was better to make a Surrender on Good Terms, than be

Upon this, the Articles regulating all matters, were got ready, and Fa∣ther <HI>Joseph</HI> had his Commission, to carry them aboard the English Admiral, where the <HI>Signing</HI> of them was de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r'd until To Morrow.

<PB N="65" REF="000873_0064_0FAC92ECA744E6F8"/>
they were thoroughly Advised of what was a doing, and likely to be done, they did molest the Country with some Tragical Efforts of their Fury. Captain <HI>James Convers</HI> was Marching through the vast Wilderness, to <HI>Albany,</HI> with some Forces, which the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Colony were willing to send by Land (besides what they did send by <HI>Sea</HI> unto <HI>Quebeck,</HI>) for the Assistence of the Army, in the <HI>West,</HI> that was to go from thence over the <HI>Lake,</HI> and there fall upon <HI>Mount Real</HI>▪ but unhappy Tidings out of the <HI>East</HI> required the Diversion of those Forces thither. About the Beginning of <HI>May,</HI> the French and Indians, be∣tween Four and Five Hundred, were seen at <HI>Casco,</HI> in a great Fleet of <HI>Canoo's</HI> passing over the Bay: but not Seeing or Hearing any more of them, for Two or Three Weeks together, the <HI>Casconians</HI> flattered themselves with Hopes, That they were gone another way.

<P>A Vessel, the Name whereof I know not, [Reader, Let it be, <HI>The Charity,</HI>] being immediately dispatched unto <HI>Sagadehock</HI>▪ by the <HI>Charitable Compassions</HI> of the more Southward Neighbours, with Effects to accomplish it, hap∣pily Effected the Redemption of many that were taken Captives at <HI>York.</HI> But the rest of the Peo∣ple in that Broken Town, talking of Drawing off, the Government sent Captain <HI>Convers</HI> and Captain <HI>Greenleaf,</HI> with such Encouragements unto them, to keep their <HI>Station,</HI> as prevailed with 'em still to <HI>Stand</HI> their Ground. In <HI>February</HI> Major <HI>Hutchinson,</HI> was made Commander in Chief, &amp; Forces under the Command of Captain <HI>Convers,</HI> Captain <HI>Floyd,</HI> and Captain <HI>Thaxter,</HI> were by him so prudently posted, on the <HI>Frontiers,</HI> that by mentaining a continual Communication, it be∣came a Difficult Thing for the Enemy to make any more Approaches. Lieutenant <HI>Wilson</HI> parti∣cularly hearing of a man Shot at, in <HI>Quochecho</HI>-Woods, went out with a Scout of about Eighteen men, who came upon the <HI>Indians</HI> that had shot at the man; and killed and wounded <HI>all</HI> but <HI>one,</HI> of the whole Company. But now, <HI>Reader,</HI> the <HI>Longest Day</HI> in tne <HI>Year</HI> is come on, and, if I

mistake not, the <HI>Bravest Act</HI> in the <HI>War,</HI> fell out upon it. <HI>Modockawando</HI> is now come, according to his Promise a Twelve-Month ago. Captain <HI>Convers,</HI> was lodg'd in <HI>Storers</HI> Garrison at <HI>Wells,</HI> with but Fifteen men; and there came into <HI>Wells,</HI> Two Sloops, with a Shallop, which had aboard Supplies of <HI>Ammunition</HI> for the Souldiers, and <HI>Contribution</HI> for the Needy. The <HI>Cattel</HI> this Day came <HI>Frighted,</HI> and <HI>Bleeding</HI> out of the Woods, which was a more certain <HI>Omen</HI> of <HI>Indians</HI> a coming, than all the <HI>Prodigies</HI> that <HI>Livy</HI> reports of the <HI>Sacrificed Oxen. Convers</HI> immediately issued out his Commands unto all Quarters, but especi∣ally to the <HI>Sloops</HI> just then arrived. The <HI>Sloops</HI> were Commanded by <HI>Samuel Storer,</HI> and <HI>James Gouge,</HI> and <HI>Gouges</HI> being Two miles up the <HI>River,</HI> he wisely brought her down undiscovered, unto <HI>Storers,</HI> by the advantage of a Mist then prevail∣ing. A careful <HI>Night,</HI> they had on't! The next <HI>Morning,</HI> before <HI>Day-Light,</HI> one <HI>John Dia∣mond,</HI> a Stranger that came in the Shallop on a Visit, came to Captain <HI>Conver's</HI> Garrison, where the Watch invited him in; but he chose rather to go aboard the Sloops, which were little more than a Gun-shot off; and, alas, the Enemy issu∣ing out from their Lurking places, immediately Siez'd him, and haled him away by the Hair of the Head, (in spite of all Attempts used by the Garrison, to Recover him) for an <HI>horrible Story,</HI> to be told by'nd by concerning him. The Gene∣ral
<PB N="89" REF="000873_0088_0FAC93056E862418"/>
of the Enemies Army was Monsieur <HI>Burniff</HI>; and one Monsieur <HI>Labrocree</HI> was a principal Commander; (the Enemy said, he was Lieute∣nant General:) There were also Diverse other Frenchmen of Quality; Accompanied with <HI>Mo∣dockawando,</HI> and <HI>Moxus,</HI> and <HI>Egeremet,</HI> and <HI>Warum∣bo,</HI> and several more Indian Sagamores; The Army made up in all, about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive Hundred <HI>Men,</HI> or Fierce Things in the Shape of <HI>Men</HI>; all, to Encounter Fifteen <HI>Men,</HI> in one little <HI>Garrison,</HI> &amp; about Fifteen more <HI>Men,</HI> [worthily called <HI>Such</HI>!] in a Couple of open <HI>Sloops▪ Diamond</HI> having in∣formed 'em, <HI>How t'was,</HI> in all points, (only that for <HI>Fifteen,</HI> by a mistake he said, <HI>Thirty,</HI>) they fell to Dividing the Persons and Plunder, and A∣greeing, that such an <HI>English Captain,</HI> should be Slave to such a one, and such a Gentleman in the Town should serve such a one, and his <HI>Wife</HI> be a <HI>Maid of Honour,</HI> to such or such a <HI>Squaw</HI> proposed, and Mr. <HI>Wheelright</HI> (instead of being a Worthy Counsellor of the Province, which he <HI>Now</HI> is!) was to be the Servant of such a <HI>Netop</HI>; and the <HI>Sloops,</HI> with their <HI>Stores,</HI> to be so and so parted among them. There wanted but <HI>One Thing</HI> to Consummate the whole matter, even, the <HI>Chief Thing</HI> of all▪ which I suppose they had not thought of; That was, For <HI>Heaven</HI> to Deli∣ver all this prize into their Hands: But, <HI>Aliter Statutum est in Caelo</HI>! A man Habited, like a Gentleman, made a <HI>Speech</HI> to them in English;
<PB N="90" REF="000873_0089_0FAC930629E09C90"/>
Exhorting 'em to Courage, and Assuring 'em, that if they would Courageously fall upon the English, all was their own. The <HI>Speech</HI> being Ended, they fell to the <HI>Work,</HI> and with an horrid Shout and Shot, made their Assault, upon the Feeble <HI>Garrison</HI>: but the English answered with a brisk Volley, and sent such a Leaden Showre among them, that they retired from the <HI>Garri∣son</HI> to spend the Storm of their Fury upon the <HI>Sloops.</HI> You must know, That <HI>Wells-Harbour</HI> is rather a <HI>Creek</HI> than a <HI>River,</HI> for 'tis very Nar∣row, and at low water, in many places <HI>Dry</HI>: nevertheless, where the Vessels ride, it is <HI>Deep</HI> enough, and so far off the Bank, that there is from thence no Leaping aboard. But our <HI>Sloops</HI> were sorely incommoded, by a Turn of the <HI>Creek,</HI> where the Enemy could ly out of danger, so near 'em, as to throw Mud aboard with their Hands. The Enemy was also privi∣ledged with a Great Heap of <HI>Plank,</HI> lying on the Bank and with an <HI>Hay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Stock,</HI> which they Streng∣thened with <HI>Posts,</HI> and <HI>Rayles</HI>; and from all these places, they poured in their Vengeance upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> while they so placed Smaller parties of their Salvages, as to make it impossible for any of the Garrisons, to afford 'em any relief. Lying thus, within a Dozen yards of the <HI>Sloops,</HI> they did with their <HI>Fire Arrows,</HI> diverse times desperately set the <HI>Sloops</HI> on Fire: but the brave Defendents, with a <HI>Swab,</HI> at the End of a <HI>Rope,</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="000873_0090_0FAC9306E5CE9E90"/>
tyed unto a <HI>Pole,</HI> and so dip't into the <HI>Water,</HI> happily put the Fire out. In brief the <HI>Sloop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> gave the Enemy so brave a Repulse, that at Night they Retreated: when they Renewed their Assault, finding that their <HI>Fortitude</HI> would not assure the Success of the Assault unto them, they had recourse unto their <HI>Policy.</HI> First, an <HI>Indian</HI> comes on, with a <HI>Slab,</HI> for a <HI>Shield,</HI> before him; when a Shot from one of the <HI>Sloops,</HI> pierc∣ed the <HI>Slab,</HI> which fell down, instead of a <HI>Tomb∣stone</HI> with the Dead <HI>Indian</HI> under it: on which, as little a Fellow as he was, I know not whe∣ther some will not reckon it proper to inscribe the <HI>Epitaph,</HI> which the <HI>Italians</HI> use to bestow upon their <HI>Dead Popes; When the Dog is Dead, all his Malice is Dead with him.</HI> Their next <HI>Stra∣tagem</HI> was This: They brought out of the Woods, a kind of a <HI>Cart,</HI> which they Trim'd, and Rigg'd, and Fitted up into a Thing, that might be called, <HI>A Chariot</HI>: whereon they built a platform, shot-proof in the Front, and placed many men upon that platform. Such an Engine they understood how to Shape, without having Read, (I suppose) the Description of the <HI>Pluteus</HI> in <HI>Vegetius</HI>! This <HI>Chariot</HI> they push'd on, towards the <HI>Sloops,</HI> till they were got, it may be, within <HI>Fifteen yards</HI> of them; when, lo, one of the <HI>Wheels</HI> to their Admiration Sunk into the Ground. A <HI>French∣man</HI> Stepping to heave the <HI>Wheel,</HI> with an Help∣ful Shoulder, <HI>Storer</HI> Shot <HI>him</HI> down; Another
<PB N="92" REF="000873_0091_0FAC9307CC52B190"/>
Stepping to the <HI>Wheel, Storer</HI> with a well placed Shot, sent <HI>him</HI> after his <HI>Mate</HI>: So the Rest thought, it was best let it stand as it was. The Enemy kept Galling the <HI>Sloops,</HI> from their Several Batte∣ries, and calling 'em to Surrender, with many fine promises to make them <HI>Happy,</HI> which ours answered with a just <HI>Laughter,</HI> that had now and then a mortiferous <HI>Bullet</HI> at the End of it. The Tide Rising, the <HI>Chariot</HI> overset, so that the men behind it lay open to the <HI>Sloops,</HI> which im∣mediately Dispensed an horrible Slaughter among them; and they that could get away, got as fast, and as far off, as they could. In the Night, the Enemy had much Discourse with the <HI>Sloops</HI>; they Enquired. <HI>Who were their Commanders?</HI> and the English gave an Answer, which in some other Cases, and Places, would have been too true, <HI>That they had a great many Commanders:</HI> but the Indians Replyed, <HI>You ly, you have none but</HI> Convers, <HI>and we will have him too before Morning</HI>! They also knowing, that the <HI>Magazine</HI> was in the <HI>Garrison,</HI> lay under an Hill-Side, Pelting at <HI>That,</HI> by Times; but Captain <HI>Convers,</HI> once in the Night, sent out Three or Four of his men, into a Field of Wheat, for a <HI>Shot,</HI> if they could get one. <HI>There</HI> seeing a <HI>Black Heap</HI> lying together, Ours all at once let Fly upon them, a <HI>Shot,</HI> that Slew several of them that were thus <HI>Caught in the Corn,</HI> and made the rest glad, that they found themselves Able to Run for it. Captain <HI>Convers</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="000873_0092_0FAC930A2CCFE898"/>
was this while in much Distress, about a <HI>Scout</HI> of Six men, which he had sent forth to <HI>Newicha∣wannick,</HI> the Morning before the Arrival of the Enemy, ordering them to <HI>Return</HI> the Day follow∣ing. The Scout <HI>Return'd,</HI> into the very Mouth of the Enemy, that lay before the Garrison; but the <HI>Corporal,</HI> having his Wits about him, call'd out aloud, (as if he had seen Captain <HI>Convers</HI> making a Salley forth upon 'em,) <HI>Captain, Wheel about your men round the Hill, and we shall Catch 'em, there are but a Few Rogues of 'em!</HI> Upon which the <HI>Indians</HI> imagining, that Captain <HI>Con∣vers</HI> had been at their <HI>Heels,</HI> betook themselves to their <HI>Heels</HI>; and our Folks got safe into ano∣ther Garrison. On the <HI>Lords Day</HI> Morning, there was for a while, a Deep Silence among the As∣sailants; but at length getting into a Body, they marched with great Formality towards the <HI>Gar∣rison,</HI> where the Captain ordered his Handful of men to ly Snug, and not make a <HI>Shot,</HI> until every <HI>Shot</HI> might be likely to do some Execution. While they thus beheld a Formidable Crue of <HI>Dragons,</HI> coming with open mouth upon them, to Swallow them up at a Mouthful, one of the Souldiers began to speak of <HI>Surrendring</HI>; upon which the Captain Vehemently protested, <HI>That he would lay the man Dead, who should so much as matter that base word any more</HI>! and so they heard no more on't: But the Valiant <HI>Storer</HI> was put upon the like protestation, to keep 'em in good

Fighting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>im, a board the <HI>Sloops</HI> also. The E∣nemy now Approaching very near, gave Three Shouts, that made the Earth ring again; and Crying out, in English, <HI>Fire, and Fall on, Brave Boyes</HI>! the whole Body, drawn into Three Ranks, Fired at once▪ Captain <HI>Convers</HI> immediately ran into the several Flankers, and made their Best Gun Fire at such a rate, that several of the E∣nemy fell, and the rest of 'em disappeared almost as Nimbly, as if they had been so many <HI>Spectres.</HI> Particularly, a parcel of them got into a small Deserted House; which having but a Board-Wall to it, the Captain sent in after them, those <HI>Bullets</HI> of Twelve to the Pound, that made the House too hot, for them that could get out of it. The <HI>Women</HI> in the Garrison, on this occasion took up the <HI>Amazonian</HI> Stroke, and not only brought Ammunition to the <HI>Men,</HI> but also with a <HI>Manly</HI> Resolution fired several Times upon the Enemy. The Enemy finding that Things would not yet go to their minds, at the <HI>Garrison,</HI> drew off, to Try their Skill upon the <HI>Sloops,</HI> which lay still a brest in the Creek, lash'd fast one to another. They built a Great <HI>Fire Work,</HI> about Eighteen or Twenty Foot Square, and fill'd it up with Com∣bustible matter, which they Fired; and then they set it in the way, for the <HI>Tide</HI> now to Flote it up, unto the <HI>Sloops,</HI> which had now nothing but an horrible <HI>Death</HI> before them. Neverthe∣less, their Demands, of both the <HI>Garrison,</HI> and
<PB N="95" REF="000873_0094_0FAC930DA374DBC8"/>
the <HI>Sloops,</HI> to yield themselves, were answered no otherwise than with <HI>Death</HI> upon many of them, Spit from the Guns of the Beseiged. Having tow'd their <HI>Fire-Work,</HI> as far as they durst, they committed it unto the <HI>Tide</HI>; but the Distres∣sed Christians that had this Deadly <HI>Fire,</HI> Swim∣ming along upon the <HI>Water</HI> towards 'em, com∣mitted it unto <HI>God</HI>: and <HI>God</HI> looked from Hea∣ven upon them, in this prodigious Article of their Distress. <HI>These poor men Cryed, and the Lord, heard them, and saved them out of their Troubles</HI>; The <HI>Wind,</HI> unto their Astonishment, immediately Turn'd about, and with a Fresh Gale drove the <HI>Machin</HI> ashore on the other side, and Split it so, that the <HI>Water</HI> being let in upon it, the <HI>Fire</HI> went out. So, the Godly men, that Saw God from Heaven thus Fighting for them, Cryed out, with an Astonishing Joy, <HI>If it had not been the Lord, who was on our Side, they had Swallowed us up quick; Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us a prey to their Teeth; our Soul is Escaped, as a Bird out of the Snare of the Fowlers!</HI> The Enemy were now in a pittiful pickle, with Toyling, and Moyling in the <HI>Mud,</HI> &amp; black'ned with it, if <HI>Mud</HI> could add <HI>Blackness</HI> to such Miscreants: and their Ammunition was pretty well Exhausted: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o that now they began to Draw off, in all parts▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd with Rafts get over the River; some whereof breaking, there did not a few <HI>Cool</HI> their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Heat</HI> by falling into it. But first, they made
<PB N="96" REF="000873_0095_0FAC930E768E6670"/>
all the Spoil they could, upon the <HI>Cattel</HI> about the Town; and giving one Shot more at the <HI>Sloops,</HI> they kill'd the only <HI>Man,</HI> of ours, that was kill'd aboard 'em. Then, after about Half an Hours Consultation, they send a <HI>Flag of Truce</HI> to the Garrison, advising 'em with much Flatte∣ry, to <HI>Surrender</HI>; but the Captain sent 'em word, <HI>That he wanted for nothing, but for men to come, and Fight him.</HI> The <HI>Indian</HI> replyed unto Captain <HI>Convers, Being you are so Stout, why don't you come, and Fight in the open Field, like a Man, and not Fight in a Garrison, like a Squaw</HI>? The Cap∣tain rejoyned; <HI>What a Fool, are you? Do you think, Thirty men a Match for Five Hundred? No,</HI> (sayes the Captain, counting as well he might, each of his <HI>Fifteen</HI> men, to be as Good as <HI>Two!) Come with your Thirty men upon the Plain, and I'le meet you with my Thirty, as soon as you will.</HI> Upon this, the <HI>Indian</HI> answered; <HI>Nay, mee own, English Fashi∣on is all one Fool; you kill mee, mee kill you! No, better ly some where, and Shoot a man, and hee no see! That the best Souldier!</HI> Then they fell to Coaksing the Captain, with as many <HI>Fine Words,</HI> as the <HI>Fox</HI> in the Fable had for the Allurement of his Prey unto him; and urged mightily that Ensign <HI>Hill,</HI> who stood with the <HI>Flag of Truce,</HI> might stand a little nearer their Army. The Captain, for a Good Reason, to be presently dis∣cerned, would not allow <HI>Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>: wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>upon they fell to Threatning, and Raging, like so many
<PB N="97" REF="000873_0096_0FAC930F30B62378"/>
Defeated Devils, using these Words, <HI>Damn ye, we'll cut you as small as Tobacco, before to morrow Morning.</HI> The Captain, bid 'em to make Hast, for, <HI>he wanted work</HI>; So, the Indian throwing his Flag on the Ground, ran away, and Ensign <HI>Hiil</HI> nimbly Stripping his Flag ran into the <HI>Valley,</HI> but the Salvages presently Fired, from an Ambush∣ment behind an <HI>Hill,</HI> near the place, where they had urged for a <HI>Parley.</HI></P>
<P>And now for poor <HI>John Diamond</HI>! The Ene∣my Retreating (which opportunity the <HI>Sloops</HI> took, to Burn down the Dangerous <HI>Hay-Stock,</HI>) into the plain, out of Gun-shot, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell to Tor∣turing their Captive <HI>John Diamond,</HI> after a man∣ner very Diabolical. They <HI>Stripped</HI> him, they <HI>Scalped</HI> him alive, and after a <HI>Castration,</HI> they Finished that Article in the Punishment of <HI>Trai∣tors</HI> upon him; They Slit him with <HI>Knives,</HI> be∣tween his <HI>Fingers</HI> and his <HI>Toes</HI>; They made cruel <HI>Gashes</HI> in the most Fleshy parts of his Body, and stuck the Gashes with <HI>Fire-brands,</HI> which were afterwards found Sticking in the wounds. Thus they Butchered <HI>One</HI> poor Englishman, with all the <HI>Fury</HI> that they would have spent upon them <HI>all</HI>; and performed an Exploit, for Five Hun∣dred <HI>Furies</HI> to brag of, at their coming home Ghastly to <HI>Express</HI>! what was it then to <HI>Suffer</HI>? They Return<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> then unto the <HI>Garrison,</HI> and kept Firing at it now and then, till nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ten a Clock at Night; when they all marched off, leaving
<PB N="98" REF="000873_0097_0FAC93100934FEA0"/>
behind 'em some of their Dead; whereof one was Monsieur <HI>Labocree,</HI> who had about his <HI>Neck,</HI> a Pouch with about a Dozen <HI>Reliques</HI> ingeniously made up, and a Printed Paper of <HI>Indulgences,</HI> and several other Implements: but it seems, none of the <HI>Amulets</HI> about his <HI>Neck,</HI> would save him from a <HI>Mortal Shot</HI> in the <HI>Head.</HI> Thus in Forty Eight Hours, was Finished an Action as Worthy to be Related, as perhaps any that occurs in our Story. And it was not long before the Va∣liant <HI>Gouge,</HI> who bore his part in this Action, did another that was not much inferiour to it, when he suddenly Recovered from the French a valuable prey, which they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wly taken upon our Coast.</P>
<P>I doubt, Reader we have made this <HI>Article</HI> of our History a little too long. We will finish it, when we have Remark'd, That albeit there were too much <HI>Feebleness</HI> discovered by my Countrey∣men, in some of their Actions, during this War, at <HI>Sea,</HI> as well as on <HI>Shore,</HI> yet several of their Actions, especially a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Sea,</HI> deserve to be Re∣membred. And I cannot but particularly be∣speak a Remembrance, for the Exploi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> perform∣ed by some of my Neighbours, in a Vessel going into <HI>Barbadoes</HI>▪ They were in sight of <HI>Bar∣badoes</HI> assaulted by a <HI>French Vessel,</HI> which had a good number of Guns, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etween <HI>Sixty</HI> and <HI>Seventy</HI> Hands. Our Vessel had Four Guns, and <HI>Eight Fighting Men.</HI> [Truly <HI>such</HI>!] with

two Tawny Servants. The Names of these <HI>Men,</HI> were <HI>Barret, Sunderland, Knoles, Nash, Morgan, Fosdyke,</HI> and Two more, that I now forget. A desperate Engagement ensued: where∣in our <HI>Eight</HI> Marriners managed the matter with such Bravery, that by the Help of Heaven, they killed between <HI>Thirty</HI> and <HI>Forty</HI> of the <HI>French Assailants,</HI> without loosing one of their own little Number: And they sank the <HI>French Vessel,</HI> which lay by their side, out of which they took <HI>Twenty Seven</HI> prisoners, whereof <HI>some</HI> were wounded, and <HI>all</HI> crying for <HI>Quarter.</HI> In the Fight the <HI>French Pennant,</HI> being by the wind fastned about the Top Mast of the En∣glish V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssel, it was torn off by the sinking of the French Vessel, and left pleasently flying there. So they Sail'd into <HI>Barbadoes</HI>▪ where the <HI>Assembly</HI> voted them one Publick Acknowledge∣ment, of their Courage and Conduct, in this Brave Action, and our <HI>History</HI> now gives them Another.</P>

Slaughter some time in <HI>July</HI> made by the <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> on certain poor Husband-men, in their Mea∣dows, at the North Side of <HI>Merrimack</HI> River, put an Accent upon the Zeal of the Designs, which he was now vigorously prosecuting. He Raised about Four hundred and Fifty Men, and in pursuance of his Instructions from <HI>White∣hall,</HI> he laid the Foundations of a Fort at <HI>Pem∣maquid,</HI> which was the Finest Thing that had been seen in these parts of <HI>America.</HI> Captain <HI>Wing,</HI> assisted with Captain <HI>Bancroft,</HI> went thro' the former part of the Work; and the latter par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of it was Finished by Captain <HI>March.</HI> His Ex∣cellency, attended in this matter, with these worthy Captains, did, in a few Months, dis∣patch a Service for the King, with a <HI>Prudence,</HI> &amp; <HI>Industry,</HI> and <HI>Thirftiness,</HI> Greater than any <HI>Reward</HI> they ever had for it. The Fort, called, The <HI>William Henry,</HI> was built of Stone, in a <HI>Quadran∣gular</HI> Figure; being about <HI>Seven hundred and thirty seven</HI> Foot in Compass, without the <HI>Outer Walls,</HI> and an <HI>Hundred and Eight</HI> Foot Square, within the <HI>Inner</HI> ones. <HI>Twenty Eight</HI> Ports it had; and <HI>Fourteen</HI> (if not <HI>Eighteen</HI>) Guns mounted whereof Six were <HI>Eighteen-Pounders.</HI> The Wall on the South Line, fronting to the Sea, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Twenty Two</HI> Foot <HI>High,</HI> and more than <HI>Six</HI> Foo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Thick</HI> at the Ports, which were <HI>Eight</HI> Foot from the Ground.

<HI>Twenty Nine Foot</HI> High.

Yea, we were almost Ready to flatter our selves, that we might have writ on the Gates of this Fort, as the French did over that of <HI>Namur,</HI> (yet after∣wards taken by K. <HI>William) Redds, non Vinci po∣test.</HI> Now, as the Architect, that built the Strong Fortress at <HI>Narne</HI> in <HI>Poland,</HI> had, for his Recom∣pence, his Eyes put out, lest he should build such another; Sir <HI>William Phipps</HI> was almost as hard∣ly Recompenced, for the Building of This at <HI>Pemmaquid.</HI> Although this Fort thus Erected in the <HI>Heart</HI> of the Enemies Country, did so Break the <HI>Heart</HI> of the Enemy, that indeed they might have call'd it, as the French did theirs upon the River of the <HI>Illinois,</HI> The Fort of <HI>Crevecoeur</HI>; and the Tranquillity <HI>After</HI> Enjoy'd by the <HI>Country,</HI> (which was very much more than <HI>Before,</HI>) was, under God, much owing thereunto: yet the Ex∣pence of maintaining it, when we were so much impoverished otherwise, made it continually complained of, as one of the <HI>Countryes Grievances.</HI>

part of the English World, with a just Astonish∣ment: and I have met with some Strange Things, not here to be mentioned, which have made me often think, that this inexplicable <HI>War,</HI> might have some of its Original among the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> whose chief <HI>Sagamores</HI> are well known un∣to some of our Captives, to have been horrid <HI>Sorcerers,</HI> and hellish <HI>Conjurers,</HI> and such as Con∣versed with <HI>Daemons.</HI> The Sum of that Story is, Written in, <HI>The Life of Sir</HI> William Phipps; with such Irreproachable Truth, as to Defy the utmost Malice and Cunning of all our <HI>Sadducees,</HI> to Confute it, in so much as one Material Article: And that the Balant, and Latrant Noises of that sort of People, may be forever Silenced, the Story will be abundantly Justifyed, when the further Account written of it, by Mr. <HI>John Hale</HI> shall be published: For none can suspect a Gen∣tleman, so full of Dissatisfaction, at the proceed∣ings then used against the Supposed <HI>Witchcraft,</HI> as Now that Reverend Person is, to be a <HI>Super∣stitious Writer</HI> upon that Subject.</P>
<P>Now in the Time of that matchless <HI>War,</HI> there fell out a Thing at <HI>Glocester,</HI> which falls in here most properly to be related: a Town so Scitua∣ted, Surrounded, and Neighboured, in the Coun∣ty of <HI>Essex,</HI> that no man in his Witts, will ima∣gine, that a Dozen <HI>French men</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> would come, and alarm the Inhabitants for Three weeks together, and Engage 'em in several Skirmishes,

<P><HI>EBenezer Bapson,</HI> about midsummer, in the Year, 1692. with the rest of his Fa∣mily, almost every Night heard a Noise, as if persons were going and runing about his House. But one Night being abroad late, at his Return home, he saw Two men come out of his Door, and run from the end of the House into the Corn. But those of the Family told him, there had been no person at all there; where upon he got his Gun, and went out in pursuit after them, and coming a little Distance from the House, he saw the Two men start up from behind a Log, and run into a little Swamp, saying to each other,
<PB N="105" REF="000873_0104_0FAC9348A750D5A8"/>
<HI>The man of the House is Come, now Else we might have taken the House.</HI> So, he heard, nor saw, no more of them.</P>
<P>Upon this, the whole Family got up, and went with all speed, to a Garrison near by; and being just got into the Garrison, they heard men Stamping round the Garrison. Whereupon <HI>Bapson</HI> took his Gun, and ran out, and saw Two men again Runing down an Hill into a Swamp. The next Night but one, the said <HI>Bapson</HI> going toward a fresh Meadow, saw Two men, which looked like <HI>French men,</HI> one of them having a Bright Gun upon his Back, and both runing a great pace towards him, which caused him to make the best of his way to the Garrison, where being come several heard a Noise, as if men were Stamping and Running, not far from the Garrison. With∣in a Night or two after this, the persons in the Garrison, heard a Noise, as if men were throwing Stones against the Barn. Not long after this, <HI>Bapson,</HI> with <HI>John</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, saw Three men, about a Gunshot off the Garrison, which they endeavoured to Shoot at, but were disap∣pointed by their Running to and fro, from the Corn into the Bushes. They were seen Two or Three Nights together; but though the a∣bovesaid strove to shoot at them, they could never attain it. On <HI>July.</HI> 14. <HI>Bapson,</HI> and <HI>Bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> with the rest of the men in the Gar∣rison,
<PB N="106" REF="000873_0105_0FAC9349587DBEB0"/>
saw within Gun-shot, half a dozen men wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pon all the men, but one, made Hast out of the Garrison, marching towards them▪ <HI>Bapson</HI> presently overtook two of them, which run out of the Bushes, and coming close to them, he presented his Gun at them, and his Gun missing Fire, the Two men Returned into the Bushes. <HI>Bapson</HI> then called unto the other persons, which were on the other side of the Swamp, and upon his call, they made Answer, <HI>Here they are! Here they are! Bapson</HI> then run∣ning to meet them, Saw Three men walk softly out of the Swamp by each others Side; the middlemost having on a white Wast coat. So, being within Two or Three Rod of them, he Shot, and as soon as his <HI>Gun</HI> was off, they all fell down. <HI>Bapson</HI> then running to his suppo∣sed prey, cryed out unto his Companions, whom he heard on the other side of the Swamp, and said, <HI>He had kill'd Three! He had kill'd Three</HI>! But coming almost unto them, they all rose up, and one of them Shot at him, and hearing the Bullet whyss by him, he ran behind a Tree, and Loaded his Gun; and seeing them lye be∣hind a Log, he crept toward them again, tell∣ing his Companions, <HI>they were here!</HI> So, his Companions came up to him, and they all Ran directly to the Log, with all speed; but before they got thither, they saw them start up, and run every man his way; One of them run into the Corn, whom they pursued, and
<PB N="107" REF="000873_0106_0FAC9349A8256B88"/>
hemm'd in; and <HI>Bapson</HI> seeing him coming to∣ward himself, Shot at him, as he was getting over the Fence, and saw him fall off the Fence on the Ground, but when he came to the Spot, he could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> find him. So they all searched the Corn; and as they were searching; they heard a great Discoursing in the Swamp, but could not understand what they said; for they spoke in an <HI>unknown Tongue.</HI> Afterwards, looking out from the Garrison, they saw seve∣ral men Skulking among the <HI>Corn,</HI> and <HI>Bushes,</HI> but could not have a Shot at them.</P>
<P>The next morning, just at Day break, they saw one man come out of the Swamp, not far from the Garrison, and stand close up against the Fence, within Gun-shot. Whereupon <HI>Isaac Prince,</HI> with a long Gun, shot at him with <HI>Swan-shot,</HI> and in a moment he was gone out of sight, they saw him no more. Upon this, <HI>Bapson</HI> went, to carry News to the Harbour; and being about Half a mile in his way thither, he heard a Gun go off, and heard a Bullet whyss close by his Ear, which Cut off a Pine bush just by him, and the Bullet lodg'd in an Hemlock Tree. Then looking about, he saw Four men Running towards him, one with a Gun in his Hand, and the other with Guns on their Shoul∣ders. So he ran into the Bushes, and turning about, shot at them, and then ran away, &amp; saw them no more. About Six men returned
<PB N="108" REF="000873_0107_0FAC934A66C86FB0"/>
from the Harbour with him, searching the woods as they went; and they saw, where the <HI>Bullet</HI> had cut off the Pine-bush, and where it was lodg'd in the Hemlock Tree, and they took the Bullet out, which is still to be seen. When they were come to the Garrison, they went to look for the Tracks of the Strange men, that had been seen, and saw several Tracks; and whilst they were looking on them, they saw one, which look'd like an <HI>Indian,</HI> having on a Blue coat, and his Hair Ty'd up behind, Stand∣ing by a Tree, and looking on them. But as soon as they spake to each other, he ran into a Swamp, and they after him, and one of them shot at him; but to no purpose. One of them also saw another, which look'd like a <HI>French man,</HI> but they quickly lost the sight of him.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 15. <HI>Ezekiel Day,</HI> being in Company with several others, who were ordered to Scout the woods, when they came to a certain Fresh Meadow, two miles from any House, at some Distance from the said Meadow, he saw a man, which he apprehended to be an <HI>Indian,</HI> cloath∣ed in Blue; and as soon as he saw him start up and run away, he shot at him; whereupon he saw another rise up a little way off, who al∣so run with speed; which together with the former, were quickly out of sight; and though himself, together with his Companions, diligent∣ly
<PB N="109" REF="000873_0108_0FAC934B271F55C8"/>
sought after them, they could not find them. The same Day, <HI>John Hammond,</HI> with several other persons, Scouting in the woods, saw ano∣ther of these <HI>Strange men,</HI> having on a blue Shirt, and white Breeches, and something about his Head; but could not overtake him.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 17. Three or Four of these <HI>Unaccounta∣ble Troublers,</HI> came near the Garrison; but they could not get a shot at them. <HI>Richard Dolliver,</HI> also, &amp; <HI>Benjamin Ellary,</HI> creeping down an Hill, upon Discovery, saw several men come out of an Orchard, walking backward and forward, and stricking with a flick upon <HI>John Row's</HI> Deserted House, (the Noise of which, was heard by others at a Considerable Distance;) <HI>Ell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry</HI> counting them, to be Eleven in all; <HI>Dol∣liver</HI> Shot at the midst of them, where they stood Thickest, and immediately they dispersed themselves, and were quickly gone out of sight.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 18. Which was the Time, that Major <HI>Appleton</HI> sent about Sixty men, from <HI>Ipswich,</HI> for the Towns Assistance, under these <HI>inexplicable Alarms,</HI> which they had suffered Night &amp; Day, for about a Fortnight together; <HI>John Day</HI> testi∣fies, that he went in Company with <HI>Ipswich</HI> and <HI>Glocester</HI> Forces, to a Garrison, about Two miles and an Half, from the Town; and News being brought in, that Guns went off, in a Swamp not far from the Garrison, some of the men, with himself, ran to discover what they
<PB N="110" REF="000873_0109_0FAC934BE419CE58"/>
could; and when he came to the Head of the Swamp, he saw a man with a Blue Shirt, and bushy black Hair, run out of the Swamp, and into the Woods; he ran after him, with all speed, and came several Times within shot of him; but the woods being Thick, he could not obtain his Design of Shooting him; at length, he was at once gone out of sight, and when afterwards, he went to look for his Track, he could find none, though it were a low miry place, that he ran over.</P>
<P>About <HI>July</HI> 25. <HI>Bapson</HI> went into the Woods, after his Cattel, and saw Three men stand up∣on a point of Rocks, which look'd toward the Sea. So he crept among the Bushes, till he came within Forty yards of them; and then presented his <HI>Gun</HI> at them, and S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ap't, but his Gun miss'd Fire; and so it did above a Dozen Times, till they all Three came up towards him, walking a slow pace, one of them having a Gun upon his Back. Nor did they take any more Notice of him, than just to give him a <HI>Look</HI>; though he snap'd his Gun at them, all the while they walked toward him, and by him; neither did they quicken their pace at all, but went into a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cel of Bushes▪ and he saw them no more. When he came home, he snap'd his Gun several Times, sometimes with but a few Corns of Powder and yet it did not once miss Fire. After this, there occurred several
<PB N="111" REF="000873_0110_0FAC934CA423B968"/>
Strange Things; but now concluding they were but <HI>Spectres,</HI> they took little further No∣tice of them.</P>
<P>[Several other Testimonies, all to the same Effect, with the Foregoing, my Friend has add∣ed, which for brevity I omit; and only add, The most considerable of these passages, were afterward Sworn, before one of Their Majesties Council.]</P>
<P>Reverend and truly Honoured Sir, Accord∣ing to your Request, I have Collected a brief Account of the Occurrences, remark'd in our Town, the last year. Some of them are very Admirable Things, and yet no less True than Strange, if we may Believe the Assertions of Credible persons.

<P>I might have given you a larger Account; only several who Saw and Heard some of the most Remarkable things, are now beyond Sea. However, I hope, the Substance of what is written, will be enough to Satisfy all Rational Persons, that <HI>Glocester</HI> was not Alarumed last Summer, for above a Fortnight together, by real <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> but that the <HI>Devil</HI> and his Agents, were the cause of all the Molestati∣on, which at this Time befel the Town; in the Name of whose Inhabitants, I would take

<P>IN the year, 1693. His Excellency sent away Captain <HI>Convers,</HI> to draw off the fittest of the Officers and Souldiers, quartered in the East, for a March, and causing about Three Hundred and Fifty more to be Levied, gave him, what he had merited above a year ago; even a Com∣mission of <HI>Major</HI> and Commander in Chief over these Forces. While Major <HI>Convers</HI> was at <HI>Wells,</HI> hearing of some Indians, that were seen in the Woods, he Surprised them all, and finding that they had cut off a poor Family at <HI>Oyster River,</HI> he gave the chief of them, something of what <HI>they</HI> also had merited. Going to <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="000873_0113_0FAC934F04CC8BD0"/>
after some service there, they Sailed up <HI>Sheep∣scote</HI> River, &amp; then marched through the Woods to <HI>Taconet</HI>▪ which being Deserted by the <HI>Indians,</HI> they ranged through many other Woods; but could meet with none of their Enemies.

Rumours of <HI>Indians</HI> Lurking about some of the Frontier-Plantations, now be∣gan to put the poor people into <HI>Consternation</HI>; but upon an Imagination, that they were only cer∣tain <HI>Bever Hunters</HI> the Consternation of the people went off into <HI>Security.</HI> 'Tis affirmed by English Captives, which were then at <HI>Canada,</HI> that the Desolation of <HI>Oyster-River</HI> was com∣monly talk'd in the Streets of <HI>Quebeck,</HI> Two months before it was Effected; for the Spies had found no Town so Secure as <HI>That.</HI> And now, what was <HI>Talk'd</HI> at <HI>Quebeck</HI> in the month of <HI>May,</HI> must be <HI>Done</HI> at <HI>Oyster-River</HI> in the month of <HI>July</HI>; for on Wednesday, <HI>July</HI> 18. 1694. the Treachearous Enemy, with a great Army fell upon that place, about break of Day, and Killed and Captiv'd, Ninety Four, (or, an Hundred) persons; about a Score of whom, were men belonging to the Trained Band, of the Town. Several persons Remarkably Escaped this Bloody Deluge, but none, with more Bravery, than one <HI>Thomas Bickford,</HI> who had an House, a Little Pallisado'd, by the River Side; but no man in it besides himself. He dexterously put his Wife, and Mother, and Children aboard a Canoo, and Sending them down the River, he <HI>Alone,</HI> be∣took himself to the Defence of his House, against many Indians, that made an Assault upon him.

They first would have perswaded him, with many fair <HI>Promises,</HI> and then, terrified him with as many Fierce <HI>Threatnings,</HI> to yield himself▪ but he flouted and fired at them, daring 'em, to come if they durst. His main <HI>Stratagem</HI> was, to Change his <HI>Livery</HI> as frequently as he could▪ appearing Sometimes in one <HI>Coat,</HI> Sometimes in another, Sometimes in an <HI>Hat,</HI> and Sometimes in a <HI>Cap</HI>; which caused his Beseigers, to mistake this <HI>One</HI> for <HI>Many</HI> Defendents. In fine, The pittiful Wretches, despairing to <HI>Beat</HI> him out of his House, e'en left him in it; whereas many that opened unto them, upon their Solemn En∣gagements of giving them Life and Good Quar∣ter, were barborously butchered by them; and the Wife of one <HI>Adams,</HI> then with Child, was with horrible Barbarity Ripped up. And thus there was an End of the <HI>Peace,</HI> made at <HI>Pemma∣quid</HI>! Upon this, the Friends of Mrs <HI>Ursula Cutt,</HI> (Widow of Mr <HI>John Cutt,</HI> formerly President of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI>) desired her, to leave her Farm, which was about a Mile above the Bank Exposed unto the Enemy, on the South side of <HI>Piscataqua</HI> River. She Thank'd them for their <HI>Care,</HI> but added, that she believed, the Enemy had now done their Do for this Time; and however, by the <HI>End of the Week,</HI> her <HI>Business at the Farm</HI> would be all <HI>dispatched,</HI> and on <HI>Saturday,</HI> she would Repair to her Friends at the Bank. But, alas, before the <HI>End of the week,</HI> she saw the

<HI>End of her Life</HI>: On <HI>Saturday,</HI> about one or two a Clock, in the Afternoon, the <HI>Business at the Farm</HI> was <HI>Dispatched,</HI> sure enough! The Indians Then Kill'd this Gentlewoman, and Three other People, a little before they had Finished a point of Husbandry, then in their Hand. Nor did the Storm go over so: Some Drops of it fell upon the Town of <HI>Groton,</HI> a Town that lay, one would think, far enough off, the place, where was the last <HI>Scene</HI> of the <HI>Tragedy.</HI> On <HI>July</HI> 27.

Ne∣vertheless, in other parts of that Plantation, (when the Good People had been so tired out, as to lay down their <HI>Military Watch,</HI>) there were more than Twenty persons killed, and more than a Dozen carried away. Mr. <HI>Gershom Hobart,</HI> the Minister of the place, with part of his Family, was Remarkably preserved, from falling into their Hands, when they made themselves the Masters of his House▪ though they Took Two of his Children, whereof the one was killed, and the other some Time after happily Rescued out of his Captivity.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE. XXII. A Conference with an <HI>Indian-Sagamore.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BUt now <HI>Bommaseen</HI> is fallen into our Hands, let us have a little Discourse with him.</P>
<P>Behold, Reader, the Troubles, and the Trou∣blers of <HI>New-England!</HI> That thou mayst a little more Exactly Behold the <HI>Spirit</HI> of the matter, I'l Recite certain passages, occurring in a Discourse that pass'd between this <HI>Bommaseen</HI> (who was one of the <HI>Indian Princes,</HI> or, <HI>Chieftanes,</HI>) and a Minister of the Gospel, in the year. 1696.</P>
<P><HI>Bommaseen,</HI> was, with some other Indians, now a Prisoner, in <HI>Boston.</HI> He desired a Confe∣rence with a Minister, of <HI>Boston,</HI> which was granted him. <HI>Bommaseen,</HI> with the other <HI>Indians</HI> assenting and asserting to it, then told the Minister, That he pray'd his In∣struction in the <HI>Christian Religion</HI>; inasmuch as he was afraid, that the <HI>French,</HI> in the <HI>Christian Re∣ligion,</HI> which they taught the <HI>Indians,</HI> had Abused them. The Minister Enquired of him, What of the Things taught 'em by the <HI>French,</HI> appear'd most Suspicious to 'em? He said▪ The <HI>French</HI> taught 'em, That the Lord JESUS CHRIST, was of the <HI>French Nation</HI>; That His Mother, the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> was a <HI>French Lady</HI>; That they were the <HI>English</HI> who had Murdered him; and,
<PB N="128" REF="000873_0127_0FAC93B516645490"/>
That whereas He Rose from the Dead, &amp; went up to the Heavens, all that would Recommend themselves unto His Favour, must Revenge His Quarrel upon the <HI>English,</HI> as far as they can. He ask'd the Minister, whether these Things were so; and pray'd the Minister to Instruct him in the True <HI>Christian Religion.</HI> The Mini∣ster considering, that the Humour and Manner of the <HI>Indians,</HI> was to have their Discourses ma∣naged, with much of <HI>Similitude</HI> in them, Look'd about for some Agreeable object, from whence he might with apt <HI>Resemblances</HI> Convey the <HI>Idae's</HI> of Truth unto the minds of Salvages: and he thought, none would be more Agreeable to <HI>them,</HI> than a <HI>Tankard of Drink,</HI> which happened then to be standing on the Table. So he pro∣ceeded in this <HI>Method</HI> with 'em.</P>
<P>He told them, [still with proper Actions painting, and pointing out the <HI>Signs</HI> unto them,] That our Lord JESUS CHRIST, had given us, a <HI>Good Religion,</HI> which might be Resembled unto the <HI>Good Drink in the Cup,</HI> upon the Table.</P>
<P>That if we Take this <HI>Good Religion,</HI> (even that <HI>Good Drink,</HI>) into our Hearts, it will do us <HI>Good,</HI> and preserve us from <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P>That Gods <HI>Book,</HI> the <HI>Bible,</HI> is the <HI>Cup,</HI> wherein that <HI>Good Drink,</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> is offered unto us.</P>
<P>That the <HI>French,</HI> having the <HI>Cup</HI> of <HI>Good Drink,</HI> in their Hands, had put <HI>Poison</HI> into it; and then made the <HI>Indians</HI> to Drink that <HI>Poisoned Liquor,</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="000873_0128_0FAC93B5A6088E98"/>
whereupon, they Run mad, and fell to killing of the <HI>English,</HI> though they could not but know, it must unavoidably iss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in their own Destruction at the Last.</P>
<P>That, it was plain, the <HI>English</HI> had put no <HI>Poi∣son,</HI> into the <HI>Good Drink</HI>; for they set the <HI>Cup</HI> wide open, and invited all men, to <HI>Come</HI> &amp; <HI>See</HI> before they <HI>Tast</HI>; even, the very <HI>Indians</HI> them∣selves; for we Translated the <HI>Bible</HI> into <HI>Indian.</HI> That they might gather from hence, that the <HI>French</HI> had put <HI>Poison</HI> into the <HI>Good Drink</HI>; inas∣much, as the <HI>French</HI> kept the <HI>Cup</HI> fast Shut, (the Bible in an <HI>Unknown Tongue,</HI>) and kept their <HI>Hands</HI> upon the <HI>Eyes</HI> of the <HI>Indians,</HI> when they put it unto their mouths.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> Expressing themselves to be well-Satisfied, with what the Minister had hitherto said, pray'd him, to go on, with showing 'em, what was the <HI>Good Drink,</HI> and what was the <HI>Poi∣son,</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> had put into it.</P>
<P>He then set before them distinctly the chief <HI>Articles</HI> of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> with all the Sim∣plicity and Sincerity of a <HI>Protestant:</HI> Adding upon each, <HI>This is the Good Drink, in the Lords Cup of Life</HI>: And they still professed, <HI>That they liked it all.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon, he demonstrated unto them, how the <HI>Papists</HI> had in their Idolatrous <HI>Popery,</HI> some way or other Depraved, and Altered, every one of these <HI>Articles</HI>; with Scandalous <HI>Ingredients</HI> of
<PB N="130" REF="000873_0129_0FAC93B6714A0AC0"/>
their own Invention; Adding upon each, <HI>This is the Poison which the French have put into the Cup.</HI></P>
<P>At last, he mentioned this Article.</P>
<P><HI>To obtain the Pardon of your Sins, you must con∣fess your Sins to God; &amp; pray to God, That He would Pardon your Sins, for the sake of Jesus Christ, who dyed for the Sins of His People: God Loves Jesus Christ infinitely, and if you place your Eye on Jesus Christ only, when you beg the Pardon of your Sins, God will Pardon them. You need confess your Sins to none but God, Except in cases, where men have known your Sins, or have been Hurt by your Sins; &amp; then those men should know that you confess your Sins; but after all, none but God can Pardon them.</HI></P>
<P>He then added; <HI>The French have put Poison in to this Good Drink; They tell you, that you must confess your Sins to a Priest, and carry skins to a Priest, and Submit unto a Penance enjoyned by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Priest; and this Priest is to give you a Pardon. There is no need of all This: 'Tis nothing but French Poison, all of it.</HI></P>
<P>The Wretches appearing astonish'd, to meet with one who would so fairly put them into a glorious way to obtain the <HI>Pardon of their Sins,</HI> and yet take no <HI>Bever Skins</HI> for it: in a Rap∣ture of Astonishment, they fell down on their <HI>knees,</HI> and got his <HI>Hand</HI> into theirs, and fell to kissing of it with an Extream show of Affection.</P>
<P>He shaking them off, with dislike of their posture, <HI>Bommaseen</HI> with the rest of them stood
<PB N="131" REF="000873_0130_0FAC93B7B0750B68"/>
up; and first lifting up his Eyes, and Hands, to Heaven; declaring, That <HI>God</HI> should be <HI>Judge</HI> of his <HI>Heart</HI> in what he said; he then said, Sir, <HI>I thank you for these Things; I Resolve to Spit up all the French Poison; You shall be my Father; I will be your Son; I beseech you, to continue, to Instruct me, in that Religion, which may bring me to the Salvation of my Soul!</HI> — Now, God knows, what <HI>Heart</HI> this <HI>Indian</HI> had, when he so Expressed himself: To <HI>Him</HI> let us leave it.</P>

<P>ON <HI>March</HI> 15. 1697. the Salvages made a Descent upon the Skirts of <HI>Haverhil,</HI> Mur∣dering and Captiving about Thirty Nine Per∣sons, and Burning about Half a Dozen Houses. In this Broil, one <HI>Hannah Dustan,</HI> having lain in about a Week, attended with her Nurse, <HI>Mary Neff,</HI> a Widow, a Body of Terrible <HI>Indians</HI> drew near unto the House, where she lay, with Designs to carry on their Bloody Devastations.

to get away as fast as they could, unto some Garrison in the Town, he went in, to inform his Wife, of the horrible Distress come upon them. E're she could get up, the fierce <HI>Indians</HI> were got so near, that utterly despairing to do <HI>her</HI> any Service, he ran out after his Children; Resolving, that on the Horse, which he had with him, he would Ride away with <HI>That</HI>▪ which he should in this Extremity, find his Affections to pitch most upon, and leave the Rest, unto the care of the Divine Providence. He overtook his Children about Forty Rod from his Door; but <HI>then,</HI> such was the <HI>Agony</HI> of his Parental Af∣fections, that he found it impossible for him to Distinguish any one of them from the rest; wherefore he took up a Courageous Resolution to Live and Dy with them all.

But his House must in the mean Time, have more dismal <HI>Tra∣gaedies</HI> acted at it. The <HI>Nurse</HI> trying to Escape, with the New-born <HI>Infant,</HI> fell into the Hands of the Formidable Salvages; and those furious Tawnies coming into the House, bid poor <HI>Dustan,</HI>

to Rise Immediately. Full of Astonishment, she did so; and sitting down in the Chimney, with an Heart full of most fearful <HI>Expectation,</HI> she saw the Raging Dragons riffle all that they could carry away, and set the House on Fire. About Nineteen or Twenty <HI>Indians,</HI> now led these a∣way, with about Half a Score other English <HI>Captives</HI>; but e're they had gone many Steps, they dash'd out the Brains of the <HI>Infant,</HI> against a Tree; and several of the other <HI>Captives,</HI> as they began to Tire in their sad <HI>Journey,</HI> were soon sent unto their <HI>Long Home</HI>; the Salvages would presently bury their Hatchets in their Brains, and leave their Carcases on the Ground, for Birds and Beasts to feed upon. However, <HI>Dustan</HI> (with her Nurse) notwithstanding her present Condition, Travelled that Night, about a Dozen Miles; and then kept up with their New Masters, in a long Travel of an Hundred and Fifty Miles, more or less, within a few Days Ensuing, without any sensible Damage, in their Health, from the Hard-ships, of their <HI>Travel</HI> their <HI>Lodging,</HI> their <HI>Diet,</HI> and their many other Difficulties.

The Murderer was a fa∣mous kind of a <HI>Giant</HI> among the Indians; a Fellow Reputed Seven Foot High: This Fellow kill'd the poor old man in cold Blood, after he had Surrendred himself a Prisoner: But behold, Before many Hours were out, this famous and bloody Fellow accidently Shot himself to Death, by his Gun going off, when he was foolishly pulling a Canoo to the Shore with it.</P>
<P>The last Bloody Action, that can have a Room in our Story is This.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians,</HI> (though sometimes, it hath been

much doubted, <HI>What Indians!</HI>) have in this War, made several Descents upon some of the upper Towns, that were our most <HI>Northerly Set∣tlements</HI> upon <HI>Connecticut</HI> River. But the Pious, and Honest People in those Towns, have al∣ways given them a brave Repulse, and had a no∣table Experience of the Divine Favour to them, in their preservations. <HI>Deerfield</HI> ha's been an Extraordinary Instance of Courage, in keeping their <HI>Station,</HI> though they have lived all this while in a very <HI>Pihahiroth</HI>; and their worthy Pastor, Mr. <HI>John Williams,</HI> deserves the Thanks of all this Province, for his Encouraging them all the ways Imaginable, to <HI>Stand</HI> their ground. Once the Enemy was like to have Surprised them into a grievous Desolation; but <HI>he,</HI> with his Praying, and Valiant, little Flock, most hap∣pily Repelled them. And now, about the mid∣dle of <HI>July,</HI> 1698. a little before Sun set, <HI>Four Indians,</HI> killed a Man and a Boy, in <HI>Hatfield</HI> Meadows; and carried away Two Boys, into Captivity. The Advice coming to <HI>Deerfield</HI> in the Night, they presently Dispatched away Twelve men, to way lay the Enemy coming up the River; having first, Look'd up unto the Lord Jesus Christ, that they might find the <HI>Ene∣my,</HI> and harm none but the <HI>Enemy,</HI> and Rescue the Children which the <HI>Enemy</HI> had Seized upon. After a Travel of near Twenty Miles, they per∣ceived the <HI>Indians,</HI> in their <HI>Canooes</HI> coming up the
<PB N="152" REF="000873_0151_0FAC93CAC638E928"/>
River, but on the other side of it, within a Rod or Two, of the opposite Shore: Whereupon they so <HI>Shot,</HI> as to <HI>Hitt</HI> one of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and then they all Jump't out of the <HI>Canooes,</HI> and one of the Boyes with them. The <HI>wounded Salvage</HI> crawled unto the Shoar; where, his <HI>back</HI> being broken, he lay in great Angush, often Endea∣vouring with his Hatchet, for to knock out his own <HI>Brains,</HI> and tear open his own <HI>Breast,</HI> but could not: and another <HI>Indian</HI> seeing the Two Boyes getting one to another, design'd 'em a Shot, but his Gun would not go off: Where∣upon he followed 'em with his Hatchet, for to have knock'd 'em on the Head; but just as he come at 'em, one of our men sent a <HI>Shot</HI> into him, that Spoilt his Enterprize; and so the Boyes getting together, into one <HI>Canooe,</HI> brought it o∣ver to the Friends thus concerned for them. These good men, seeing their Exploit perform∣ed thus far; <HI>Two Indians</HI> destroy'd, and <HI>Two Children</HI> delivered, they fell to <HI>Praising of God</HI>; and one young man particularly, kept thus Ex∣pressing himself; <HI>Surely, Tis God, and not we, that have wrought this Deliverance</HI>!

That even in the Beating of a <HI>Pulse,</HI> the Dilating of the Heart, by a <HI>Diastole</HI> of Delight, may be turned into a con∣tracting of it, with a <HI>Systole</HI> of Sorrow: In the Beating of a few <HI>Pulse,</HI> after this, they sent five or six men, with the <HI>Canooe,</HI> to fetch the other,

<HI>Peace</HI> would continue long.

But that which makes it the more agreeable, to allow the <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> an <HI>Article</HI> in our <HI>History</HI> of the <HI>Indians,</HI> is, That a certain silly Scribbler, the very First-born of <HI>Non-sensicality,</HI> (and a <HI>First-born</HI> too, that one might Salute as the Martyr <HI>Polycarp</HI> once did the wicked <HI>Marcion,</HI>) One <HI>Tom Maule,</HI> at this Time Living in <HI>Salem,</HI> hath exposed unto the Publick, a Volumn of <HI>Nonsensical</HI> Blasphemies and Haeresies, wherein he sets himself to Defend

<P>In the mean Time, I owe unto the Publick, a piece of <HI>History,</HI> which it may be for the Safe∣ty of our <HI>Northern Towns,</HI> to be acquainted with∣al. Know, Sirs, That once the famous <HI>George Keith,</HI> undertook to be the Champion of our <HI>New-English</HI> Quakers; and bid fair to be the very <HI>Dalae,</HI> or <HI>Prester John,</HI> of all the English <HI>Tartars</HI>; but a Minister of <HI>Boston,</HI> upon that oc∣casion, publishing a Book, Entituled, <HI>Little Flocks guarded against grievous Wolves,</HI> could not but complain of it, as a very <HI>Scandalous Thing,</HI> in <HI>George Keith,</HI> to maintain the points of the <HI>Foxian
<PB N="165" REF="000873_0164_0FAC93D5DFA6DC08"/>
Quakerism,</HI> while he really differed from them. All this while, <HI>George Keith</HI> was admired by our <HI>Quakers,</HI> as an <HI>Apostle,</HI> or, an <HI>Oracle</HI>: but, he finding it impossible to mentain the gross Tenets of the common <HI>Quakers,</HI> preach'd unto them the Necessity of Believing on a <HI>Christ without,</HI> as well as a <HI>Christ within.</HI> Hereupon, there gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> such alienations between him, and the other <HI>Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kers,</HI> (who had been taught by <HI>George Fox,</HI> to say, <HI>The Devil is in them, who say, they are Saved by Christ without them:</HI>) that he not only ha's written diverse Learned Books, to confuse those very Doctrines of the Common <HI>Quakers,</HI> which the Pastors of <HI>New-England</HI> had, upon his Pro∣vocation, Written against, but also ha's therefore undergone a Storm of <HI>Persecution,</HI> from the Friends in <HI>Pensylvania</HI>: Yea, 'tis verily thought, that poor <HI>George</HI> would have been made a Sacri∣fice to Squire <HI>Samael Jennings,</HI> and the rest of the <HI>Pensylvanian Dragons,</HI> and that, since a crime which their Laws had made <HI>Capital,</HI> was men∣tion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in the <HI>Mittimus</HI> whereby <HI>Keith</HI> was com∣mitted, they would have Hang'd him, if a <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣volution</HI> upon their Government had not set him at liberty. Being by the Fines, and Gaols, and Fierce Usages of the <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>Pensylvania,</HI> dri¦ven over to <HI>England,</HI> the Wonderful Hand of God, hath made this very man, I think I may say, incomparably the greatest <HI>Plague,</HI> that ever came upon that Sect, of <HI>Energumens.</HI> Although
<PB N="166" REF="000873_0165_0FAC93D8440C1260"/>
he do himself still retain the Name of a <HI>Quaker,</HI> yet he hath in one Treatise after another, Ear∣nestly called upon the Divines, throughout the Nation, more Vigorously to Employ their <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lants,</HI> against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as a more <HI>Dangerous Generation</HI> of People than they are well aware; and he did in the year 1696. with the leave of the <HI>Lord Mayor,</HI> Challenge the <HI>Quakers,</HI> to make their Appearance at <HI>Turners Hall,</HI> in the chief City of <HI>Europe</HI>; where he proved unto the Satis∣faction of a vast Assembly, that the chief Writers of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> assert <HI>Christ</HI> neither to be <HI>God,</HI> nor <HI>Man</HI>; and that they deny <HI>Christ</HI> to be pray'd unto; and that they had affirm'd, <HI>Christs out∣ward Blood, shed on the Ground, to be no more than the Blood of another Saint</HI>; and that they had charged him with <HI>New-Doctrine,</HI> for directing to <HI>Faith</HI> in <HI>Christ without us,</HI> as well as <HI>within us</HI>; and that at their Meetings, they had censured him, for saying, <HI>That Christs Body came out of the Grave,</HI> which they say, <HI>It never did</HI>: And many more such horrid matters. To confirm these things, Besides the grievous <HI>Bites</HI> which <HI>Francis Bugg,</HI> one of their late Friends, hath given them, one <HI>Daniel Leeds,</HI> without wholly casting off the Profession of a <HI>Quaker,</HI> hath lately Printed a Book, wherein he produces above <HI>Threescore</HI> In∣stances, of the <HI>Flat Contradictions,</HI> which he hath observed in the Books of the <HI>Friends,</HI> that have most pretended unto <HI>Infallibility</HI>; and he demon∣strates
<PB N="167" REF="000873_0166_0FAC93D8F2DCBC98"/>
from evident matter of Fast, that though they declared unto the World, <HI>That their Suffe∣rings had been greater and more unjust, than the Sufferings of Jesus, and Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Apos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les</HI>; yet they themselves were no sooner mounted into the Seat of Government, than they fell to <HI>Persecuting</HI> as bad as any in the World. Albeit <HI>Fox</HI> writes, <HI>They that cause People to be put in Prison, and have their Goods taken away, are Disorderly Teachers, and shall be rooted out:</HI> Nevertheless <HI>Leeds</HI> proves by many Exemples, that the <HI>Pensylvanians</HI> did it, even upon their own Friends, for meer <HI>Scruples</HI> of their <HI>Consciences.</HI> 'Tis reported, The <HI>Quakers</HI> are so confounded at this Book of <HI>Leeds,</HI> that they have been at the charge to buy up the <HI>whole Impression</HI> of it, and so to Stiffle and Smo∣ther it: If it be so, I hope 'twill but produce a <HI>New Impression</HI> of so rare a Book. The <HI>Marvel∣lous Providence</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, having thus employ'd, the Pens of the <HI>Quakers</HI> them∣selves, to warn you, that you beware of <HI>Quaker∣ism,</HI> it will be a marvellous Infatuation in any of <HI>you,</HI> after this, to be led away with <HI>that Error of the Wicked.</HI> Reader, make a Pause, and here Admire the <HI>Marvellous Providence</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ!

<P>I say, The <HI>Spirit</HI> of Jesus Christ, in the A∣postle <HI>Peter,</HI> after our Lords Ascension, when it was Impossible for <HI>Johns</HI> Baptism (which was into the <HI>Messiah</HI> Suddenly to come, not, already come,) should have place, did say, in Act. 10 47. <HI>Can any man Forbid Water, that these should not be Baptised, which have Received the Holy Ghost?</HI></P>

<P><HI>How does this prove, That Jesus Christ Commanded these to be Baptised with water?</HI></P>

<P>Thus; —</P>
<P>If Jesus Christ had not <HI>Commanded Baptism with Water,</HI> any man might have then <HI>Forbid</HI> it.</P>
<P>But, no man could <HI>Forbid</HI> it.</P>
<P><HI>Therefore</HI> Jesus Christ Commanded it.</P>

<P>Friend, I perceive, the word, <HI>There∣fore,</HI> is a very dead doing sort of a Word to yee. I'le dismiss this Terrible Word. I'le only say, The Reason, why none could forbid Believers to be <HI>Baptised with Water,</HI> was meerly <HI>Because</HI> Jesus Christ Commanded it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>BECAUSE; <HI>Why, the word,</HI> Because <HI>is as bad as the word,</HI> Therefore.</P>

<P><STAGE>[Smiling.]</STAGE>
It may be so. But in the mean time, you are wonderfully unreasona∣ble! I say, why could none <HI>forbid Water,</HI> for the Faithful to be <HI>Baptised.</HI></P>

<P>I pray, Syrs; And is not this, <HI>None can.</HI></P>
<P>But I'l bring the matter to bear upon you, without those two Dangerous words, THERE∣FORE, and BECAUSE; at which you are so terrified.</P>

<P>I suppose, your refer to a Story▪ published by one <HI>George Bishop,</HI> a Quaker: He
<PB N="181" REF="000873_0180_0FAC93E6AC21E9A0"/>
Complains bitterly, of the <HI>New-England Persecu∣tion,</HI> because there came Two Quaker women Stark Naked, into our Publick Assemblies, and they were carried unto the Whipping post for it. This was in the Northern parts of the Country, as I have been told. These Baggages, I believe, were the persecuted women, you talk of!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well, and what if they did appear Nak∣ed, to show the People the Nakedness of their Sins?</HI></P>

<SP>

<P>For Shame, Sirs, let us have no more of This Talk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why didst thou treat</HI> George Keith <HI>so hardly?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>He deserved it, when I so Treated him. And you <HI>Quakers,</HI> have since Treated him Ten Times worse than ever I did. You write whole Books of Railing against him. I never got him into <HI>Goals,</HI> and under <HI>Fines.</HI> I should have been Troubled at any that would have done so. But <HI>you</HI> have done it. Therefore, I believe, 'tis best for you to leave that Subject.</P>
</SP>
<P>And so, after a few other small <HI>Pulls,</HI> the <HI>Saw</HI> stood still: The <HI>Conference</HI> ended.</P>
<P>There are Five or Six witnesses, which I have to attest unto the Truth of this Relation, which I have here given, of a <HI>Conference,</HI> with a <HI>Quaker,</HI> which had all the <HI>Friends</HI> far and near <HI>wondering</HI> (as well as <HI>wandring) after him,</HI> And yet these <HI>Cretians</HI> boasted among their Friends, how much they had confounded the Minister in this <HI>Con∣ference.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="000873_0181_0FAC93E75F24F238"/>All that I would presume now to Commend unto those <HI>Towns,</HI> which have such <HI>Quakers</HI> an∣noying of them, is This <HI>Brethren</HI> carry it <HI>well,</HI> even with all convenient <HI>Civility</HI> &amp; <HI>Humanity,</HI> towards this Poor Deluded People; while you Charge your <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Servants,</HI> that they do not go unto their <HI>Meetings:</HI> and cast not our selves also into <HI>Temptation,</HI> by needlessly being <HI>There.</HI> But after all, yea, <HI>before all,</HI> make an Experi∣ment, which the Good People at <HI>Lyn</HI> made a little while ago, with a Success truly observable and memorable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Quakers</HI> made a more than ordinary De∣scent upon the Town of <HI>Lyn,</HI> and <HI>Quakerism</HI> suddenly spread there, at such a rate as to A∣larum the Neighbourhood. The Pastor of the Church there, Indicted a Day, for <HI>Prayer with Fasting,</HI> to Implore the Help of Heaven▪ against the unaccountable <HI>Enchantment</HI>; and the Good People presented accordingly, on <HI>July</HI> 19. 1694. their servent Supplications, unto the Lord, that the <HI>Spiritual Plague</HI> might proceed no further, The Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ gave a Re∣markable Effect, unto this Holy Method of En∣counting the Charms of <HI>Quakerism:</HI> It proved a Better method, than any Coercion of the Civil Magistrate: <HI>Quakerism</HI> in <HI>Lyn</HI> received (as I am informed) a <HI>Death-Wound,</HI> from that very Day; The Number of <HI>Quakers,</HI> in that place hath been so far from <HI>Increasing,</HI> that I am
<PB N="183" REF="000873_0182_0FAC93E7DF728D68"/>
told, it hath since rather <HI>Decreased</HI> notably. Now let other Endangered Plantations; <HI>Go, and do likewise.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Quakers,</HI> are such Enemies, to the Holy <HI>Religion,</HI> which is the Life of <HI>New England,</HI> That you must Excuse my concern to have you For∣tify'd against <HI>their</HI> Attempts also, while I am giving you an <HI>History</HI> of your <HI>other Enemies.</HI> What <HI>all</HI> of them would be at, methinks, was a little intimated by what <HI>One</HI> of them once De∣clared. The <HI>Globe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Tavern</HI> was near our Publick and Spacious <HI>Meeting<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>House</HI> at <HI>Salem</HI>: and a No∣ted <HI>Quaker</HI> there caused a paper to be set up on the Door of that Meeting<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>House, which had such Stuff as this written in it.</P>
<Q><L>Beware, Beware, and Enter not:</L>
<L>But rather to the Globe, and spend a Pot.</L></Q>
<P>This is but like a passage mentioned in the Life, of that Excellent man Mr. P. <HI>Henry,</HI> lately published. A Debauched Gentleman, in his Re∣vels, Drinking and Swearing, at <HI>Malpas,</HI> was Re∣proved by a Quaker, then in his Company. Why, said the Gentleman, I'le ask thee one Question; Whether it is better for me to follow Drinking and Swearing, or to go and Hear <HI>Henry?</HI> The Quaker answered; <HI>Nay, of the Two, rather follow thy Drinking and Swearing.</HI> Behold, the Spirit of <HI>Quakerism</HI>! When I once compelled a <HI>Quaker</HI>
<PB N="184" REF="000873_0183_0FAC93E9DF729150"/>
to confess, that the Body of Jesus of <HI>Nazareth</HI> rose from the Grave, and went up into the Hea∣vens, he begg'd me that I would not improve his confession, as if made on the behalf of all his Friends. And another of them, as, I hear, pub∣lickly <HI>Held Forth</HI> by one of his late <HI>Stercorations,</HI> That the <HI>Husks</HI> of the <HI>Swine,</HI> on which the <HI>Pro∣digal</HI> fed in the <HI>Parable,</HI> were, The <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> in that which People call, <HI>The Sacrament.</HI></P>
<P>But what will become of those Forlorn Villages, that shall Resign themselves to the conduct of that <HI>Light within</HI>; which our Sa∣cred Scriptures indeed never expresly mention but once or twice, and then call it, <HI>Real Dark∣ness</HI>; and which may lead men to all this wick∣edness? There was among the <HI>Mahometans</HI> in the Eastern parts of the World, a Sect called <HI>Batenists,</HI> from the Arabic, <HI>Baten,</HI> which sig∣nifies <HI>within</HI>:) who were Enthusiasts that fol∣lowed, <HI>The Light within,</HI> like our <HI>Quakers</HI>; and on this principle, they did such Numberless Vil∣lanies, that the World was not able to bear them. None of all their Diabolical <HI>Raveries</HI> which I know I am now pulling on my self, and which I value no more, than if they came from the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iats</HI> of <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abar,</HI> shall frighten me from solliciting your <HI>Christian</HI> Cares &amp; Prayers, That you be not over-run with English <HI>Batenists.</HI> And I must sollicitously make the Observation, That although such a Number of <HI>Quakers</HI> in our
<PB N="185" REF="000873_0184_0FAC93EAA163ED88"/>
Nation, be a dreadful <HI>Judgment</HI> of God upon men, smiting them with <HI>Spiritual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Plagues</HI> for their Unfruitfulness and Unthankfulness under the Gospel; nevertheless, 'tis a special <HI>Favour</HI> of God, that the Number of <HI>Quakers</HI> is no Greater; for if they should multiply, not only would <HI>Christianity</HI> be utterly Extinguished, but <HI>Humanity</HI> it self Exterminated. It is well known, That when a <HI>Quaker</HI> had Stollen an <HI>Hour-glass,</HI> their <HI>Mahomet, George Fox</HI> (of whom <HI>Sol. Eccles,</HI> in a Sheet call'd, <HI>The Quakers Challenge,</HI> pag. 6. sales, <HI>He was the Christ,</HI>) thus vindicated it [<HI>Great Myst.</HI> pag. 77.] <HI>As for any being moved of the Lord, to take away your Hour glass from you, by the Eternal Power it is owned.</HI> Reader, Dost not thou even <HI>Tremble</HI> to think, what a <HI>Dark Land,</HI> we should have, if it should ever be fill'd with these pretended followers of the <HI>Light</HI>; who wear the Name of <HI>Tremblers?</HI> In Truth, I know not unto what better one might com∣pare them, than unto the <HI>Macheveliers</HI> growing upon St. <HI>Lucia</HI>; Trees which bear Apples of such an Odour and Colour as invites people to Eat thereof; but it is horribly Dangerous to do so; for there is no Antidote that can secure a man from speedy Death, who hath once tasted of them. The <HI>Leaf</HI> of the Trees, makes an Ulcer on any place touched with it; the <HI>Dew</HI> that falls from them fetches off the Skin; the very <HI>Shadow</HI> swells a man, so as to kill him, if he be not speedily helped.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE XXX. Things to Come.</HEAD>
<P>FRom <HI>Relating</HI> of <HI>Things past,</HI> it would no doubt, be very Acceptable to the Reader if we could pass to <HI>Foretelling</HI> of <HI>Things to come</HI> Our <HI>Curiosity</HI> in this point may easily come to a Degree <HI>Culpable,</HI> and <HI>Criminal.</HI> We must be Humbly content, with what the <HI>God</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whose <HI>Hands</HI> are our <HI>Times,</HI> hath <HI>Reveal'd</HI> unto us.</P>
<P><HI>Two</HI> Things we will venture to Insert.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> For <HI>our selves,</HI> at home, Let us Remem∣ber an awful Saying of our <HI>Goodwin,</HI> quoted by my Reverend Friend, Mr. <HI>Noyes,</HI> in his late Excellent Sermon at our Anniversary <HI>Election.</HI></P>
<P><Q>As you Look for <HI>Storms</HI> in <HI>Autumn,</HI> and <HI>Frosts</HI> in <HI>Winter,</HI> so Expect <HI>Judgments,</HI> where the Gospel hath been Preached; for the Quar∣rel of the Covenant must be Avenged.</Q></P>
<P>Secondly. For <HI>the Church</HI> abroad, I am far from deserting, what was Asserted, in the Sermon Preached at our Anniversary Election, in the year, 1696.
<Q>The <HI>Tidings</HI> which I bring unto you, are, That there is a <HI>Revolution,</HI> and a <HI>Reformation,</HI> at the very Door, which will be vastly more wonderful, than any of the Deliverances yet seen by the Church of God, from the Beginning of the World, I do
<PB N="187" REF="000873_0186_0FAC93EE0A136438"/>
not say, That the <HI>Next year</HI> will bring on this <HI>Happy Period</HI>: but this I do say, The Bigger part of this Assembly, may, in the course of Nature, Live to see it. These Things will come on, with horrible Commotions, and Concussions, and Confusions: The mighty Angels of the Lord Jesus Christ, will make their Descent, and set the World a <HI>Trembling</HI> at the Approaches of their Almighty Lord: They will <HI>Shake</HI> Nations, and <HI>Shake</HI> Church∣es, and <HI>Shake</HI> mighty Kingdoms, and <HI>Shake once more, not Earth only, but Heaven also.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Unto these <HI>Two</HI> Things, my Reader will not misimprove it, I hope, if I add a <HI>Third,</HI> lately fallen into my Hands; and never yet so Expo∣sed unto the Publick.</P>

<HEAD>A Wonderful Matter Incontestably Demonstrated, and much Desired by some Good men, to be in this place Communicated.</HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>John Sadler,</HI> a very Learned and a very Pious man, and a most Exempla∣ry Christian, Lay Sick in his Bed, at his Man∣nor, of <HI>Warmwell</HI> in <HI>Dorset</HI> Shire: In the year, 1663.

<P>He then Sat up in his Bed, and asked Mr <HI>Bound</HI> and the Attendent <HI>Gray</HI>; Whether they <HI>Saw</HI> no body? and, whether they did no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>hear,</HI> what a person said, that stood at the cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner of the Chamber?

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHen the <HI>Israelites</HI> were Engaged in a WAR, they made choice of a <HI>Priest</HI> among them, to Serve some of their greatest Occasions in it, and after a <HI>Sacred Unction</HI> bestow'd upon him, we are told by <HI>Maimonides,</HI> he was call'd <HI>Mashuach Milchamah,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Unctus Belli</HI>; which was as much as to say, <HI>The Priest of the War.</HI></P>
<P>To bring unto a People profitable Advices &amp; Reflections upon a WAR, wherein they are En∣gaged, and sound the <HI>Silver Trumpet,</HI> of the Gos∣pel, with agreeable Notes unto them in it, is to do in some sort, the Office of the <HI>Mashuach Mil∣chamah</HI>▪ and this Office the Ensuing Discourse presumes to do, with Endeavours that the Voice of Heaven by the <HI>Trumpet</HI> of our late <HI>War,</HI> may he heard giving a <HI>certain Sound,</HI> in these <HI>Echo's</HI> of it.</P>
<P>The History of a long <HI>War,</HI> hath, with all pos∣sible care of <HI>Truth,</HI> been given you. The Author Earnestly prayes, that if the least material <HI>Mistake</HI> have happened in the History, <HI>He</HI> may be Ad∣vised, &amp; <HI>It</HI> may be corrected. The Noise that may be made, by a few Sordid People, here &amp; there, in a Room <HI>Tophetized</HI> with Smoke, and Rhum, and Spittle, and Malice, and <HI>Lyes,</HI> crying out concerning the most Conscientious Essayes, to preserve <HI>Memorable Truths, They are a parcel of Lies</HI>! He values not. But he now tenders to the Acceptance of the more <HI>Civilized Readers,</HI> an Improvement of <HI>Memorable Truths,</HI> which it was <HI>His</HI> Duty to <HI>make,</HI> &amp; it will be <HI>Theirs</HI> to <HI>mind.</HI></P>

<P>IF a <HI>Book</HI> of some Consequence, be laid open before one that cannot <HI>Read,</HI> he may Look, and Gaze upon it; but unto what purpose, as long as he cannot un∣derstand it? This very Comparison, is by the Great <HI>Austin</HI> well applyed unto, The <HI>Judgments</HI> of God. And I will therefore so far Improve the Comparison, as to observe, That the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, under which we have been Languishing for <HI>Ten years</HI> together, are a sort of a <HI>Book</HI> put into our Hands; a <HI>Book</HI> indeed all writ∣ten in <HI>Blood</HI>; a <HI>Book</HI> yet full of <HI>Divine Lessons</HI> for us. But can every man Read this Terrible
<PB N="202" REF="000873_0201_0FAC9359CB310D20"/>
<HI>Books</HI>? No, Methinks, I see the <HI>Book</HI> managed like the <HI>Book</HI> brought unto the Blessed Prophet of old, in Isa. 29.12. <HI>The Book is delivered unto him that is not Learned, Saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I am not Learned.</HI> It will cer∣tainly Be a work, well becoming a <HI>Minister</HI> of the Gospel, and every Serious <HI>Christian</HI> will be glad of seeing the Work done; To take this <HI>Book,</HI> and help you, as well as we can to <HI>Spell</HI> the <HI>Di∣vine Lessons</HI> contained in it.</P>
<P><HI>Christians,</HI> Let us now do a work, for which the Great God hath given us, that Warrant, and that Command, in
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSAL. CVII.43.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Who is Wise, and will observe these Things?</P></Q></P>
<P>THe various and marvellous Dispensations of the Divine Providence, towards the Chil∣dren of men, are in this Elegant <HI>Psalm</HI> admirably set before us. Among those Dispensations, there is a particular mark set upon this, That the God of Heaven <HI>Turns a Fruitful Land into Barrenness, for the Wickedness of them which dwell therein</HI>; &amp; tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh men have <HI>Sown Fields there and have multiplied greatly, yet they are again Diminished, &amp; brought Low through Oppression, Affliction, and Sor∣row.</HI> Of such Dispensations, is this passage to be understood, as a Quaestion, <HI>Who is wise, and will observe these things</HI>? But if you will rather take it

<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> In the WAR that hath been upon us, <HI>Whoso is Wise, may observe</HI> the Consequence of Entertaining the <HI>Gospel</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and Obtaining and Mentaining the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of that Glorious Gospel. The <HI>Gada∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ens</HI> of old, were loath to have any thing of CHRIST in their <HI>Coast:</HI> And anon comes a <HI>Roman War</HI> which distress'd all the Land: But the woful Town of <HI>Gadara</HI> was the very first place besieged in that <HI>War,</HI> and Sad Things were done unto it. Alas, How little of an <HI>Evangeli∣cal Church-State,</HI> was there to be seen among all our <HI>Eastern Settlements</HI>! It hath been for the want of this, that the Judgments of God, have more than once forbidden them to be called <HI>Settlements.</HI> The Towns were generally with∣out <HI>Preachers</HI> of CHRIST, and much more ge∣nerally

without <HI>Churches</HI> of CHRIST, for to Irradiate 'em: Yea, not one of the Towns, that are utterly broken up, had any <HI>Minister</HI> in it, for a long while before their Final Darkness came upon them. Such a <HI>Way of Living</HI> did content many of them, that it were horrible to Tell, what Ignorance of CHRIST they were thereby sunk into. I would never have told you, That some young men, twenty years old, in this Land, never so much as <HI>once</HI> heard the Name of CHRIST, in all their Lives, if I did not think, that the God of Heaven required us, all to mourn before Him, for such an <HI>Horrible Thing in the Land.</HI> Indeed the Strange Disast∣ers which attended the First Essayes, to Settle that Good Country, made many people, Ima∣gine the <HI>Indian Sorcerers</HI> had Enchanted the Ground so that no English could Thrive on such an Enchanted Soyl. But had they carried the <HI>Gospel</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ with them, doubtless they had confuted that vain Imagina∣tion; all the <HI>Spells</HI> of Hell would have been insignificant; there would not have prevailed any <HI>Enchantment</HI> against a <HI>Gods-Spel</HI> which we have in our <HI>Gospel.</HI> The <HI>Original Design</HI> of NEW-ENGLAND, was to Settle <HI>Congregations,</HI> wherein the Lord Jesus Christ, should be known and serv'd according to His <HI>Gospel</HI>; and Instruct <HI>Families,</HI> that should be the Nurseries of those Congregations. The Plantations of the East,
<PB N="206" REF="000873_0205_0FAC93615EEF6730"/>
had little of this <HI>Illustrious Design</HI> in their Eye; The Enjoyments of <HI>Gadarens</HI> did seem too much to Satis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y too many of them. <HI>For This cause,</HI> we may Believe it is, that our Lord JESUS CHRIST looking down from Heaven upon these <HI>Unchristi∣an an Undertakings,</HI> Thunder-struck them with His Indignation: <HI>He saw the Foolish taking Root, but suddenly He Cursed their Habitation.</HI> When some of our <HI>Eastern People</HI> have been Pining away un∣der the Fatigues of their <HI>Captivity</HI> among the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> who had Stript them of all they had, <HI>Then</HI> they cryed out, <HI>Now, Now the Lord▪ is punishing of us, for our Leaving of His Ordinances, and removing to a place of no Gospel for larger Accommodations in the World, and Exposing our Children to be bred up like the very Indians, into whose Hands we are fallen!</HI> That which Invites one to think, it may be <HI>For this Cause,</HI> is the Singular <HI>Distinction</HI> and <HI>Protection,</HI> which the CHURCHES of our Lord, have Enjoyed, throughout the whole progress of our Calamity.

and no further</HI>! But here let me add a very ob∣servable Thing: The Lord had some of His <HI>Elect</HI> among our <HI>Eastern People</HI>; but He ha's brought those <HI>Elect Home</HI> unto Himself, by burn∣ing them out of their <HI>Homes</HI> and Habitations. The <HI>Indians</HI> have driven 'em hither, and here they have met with the Gospel of Christ, and been effectually Called unto the Lord, and Joyn∣ed unto our Churches, and Blessed the Name of God for bringing them unto these Churches. <HI>Periissent nisi Periissent!</HI> Now, <HI>Whoso is Wise, and will observe these things,</HI> cannot but wish, That the <HI>Folly</HI> of Erecting Plantations, without the worship of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, may be no more committed among us.

<Q>Let Christians no where sit down without Good Ministers, but let them rather tarry where they are, as <HI>Ezra</HI> tarryed by the River <HI>Ahava,</HI> till he had got some <HI>Levites</HI> to go with them.</Q>
And it was even Then observed, That places which made Begin∣nings any long while without Ministers, were with miserable <HI>Unsettlements</HI> broken all to pieces. I sup∣pose, our Eastern Country, will shortly again be peopled: But let the people which intend there to Settle themselves, in the Fear of God Remem∣ber this Admonition; Don't venture to form <HI>Towns</HI> without the <HI>Gospel</HI> in them any more.

<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> In the WAR that hath been upon us <HI>who∣so is wise, may observe,</HI> in the very <HI>Instruments</HI> of our Calamity, shrow'd Intimations of the <HI>provo∣king Evils,</HI> for which the Righteous God hath Chastised us, by such <HI>Instruments.</HI></P>
<P>When the Miseries of the <HI>Sword</HI> are inflicted on a people, it becomes them to consider what <HI>Provocations</HI> they have given to the Almighty God, who <HI>makes peace, and creates Evil; for 'tis He, the Lord, who doth all these things.</HI> The <HI>Sword</HI> by which we have been so grievously harassed, hath been in the Hands of God: and if our Father had not been very Angry, would He have taken a <HI>Sword</HI> into His Hands? We are Blind before Lightning, we are Deaf unto Thunder, if we do not sensibly perceive the <HI>Anger</HI> of God, in the Tremendous Rebukes that we have suffered: And we are unaccountably, and inexcusably stupid, if we do not E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quire, <HI>What means the Heat of this Anger?</HI> It was once the Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ination of God, in Ezek. 7.24, 27. <HI>I will bring the worst of the Heathen, and they shall possess their Houses, and the Hands of the people of the Land shall be Troubled:</HI> Such <HI>Trouble</HI> hath come upon us, from the <HI>worst of the Heathen!</HI> But what was the cause of all?

<PB N="210" REF="000873_0209_0FAC9363E08F6F18"/>
I am the Lord.</HI> It is but seasonable for us now to Look back upon our own <HI>way,</HI> and see how much we have <HI>Deserved</HI> all this Vengeance, by going out of the <HI>way.</HI> Two persons in their Travels beholding the horrid Ruines of <HI>Germa∣ny,</HI> one of them said, <HI>Hic fuit Hostilitas</HI>; Behold the Fruit of <HI>Hostility!</HI> his Friend answered, <HI>Hic fuit Iniquitas</HI>; Behold the Fruit of <HI>Iniquity</HI>! If you will Travel over our <HI>East Countrey,</HI> how fre∣quent, how dismal occasions will you see, to Sigh, <HI>See what has been done by Hostility</HI>! But there will be as many occasions for a sadder Sigh than that; Namely, <HI>See the sad Effects of Iniquity!</HI> Now, in this Contemplation, I do not go to charge them that were once Inhabitants of the Now Ruined Plantations, with any <HI>Sins,</HI> but what are more or less to be found in all our Colonies. I ask no more from our Bre∣thren who yet Survive the Desolations that have come upon their Estates and Neighbours in those Plantations, but that they join with the rest of us all, in <HI>Searching and Trying of our ways,</HI> and in <HI>Judging of our selves.</HI> For, alas, <HI>Every mouth must be stop'd, and all the Land is become Guilty before God!</HI> Let us all then <HI>Enquire,</HI> What may have been those <HI>provoking Evils,</HI> for which the <HI>Holy and Blessed God,</HI> hath given the <HI>Sword</HI> a Commission so dreadfully to devour us? But then, Let us be sure <HI>to Enquire wisely concerning that matter.</HI> And here, I will not <HI>Enquire,</HI> whe∣ther
<PB N="211" REF="000873_0210_0FAC9364D37E3C00"/>
those that went before us, might never be too forward in any <HI>Unjustifyable Encroachments,</HI> to possess and command those Lands, which have since proved so Expensive unto us? <HI>Older men</HI> then I, are best able to manage that <HI>Enqui∣ry,</HI> though I also have heard it made. But that whereupon I rather bespeak your Thoughts, is This: Will you please to <HI>Enquire</HI> into the <HI>Pro∣perties</HI> and <HI>Qualities,</HI> of our <HI>Adversaries?</HI> 'Tis possible, that in their <HI>Properties</HI> and <HI>Qualities,</HI> we may read something of those <HI>Miscarriages,</HI> for which our God, hath Raised them up to be our Adversaries. It hath been commonly seen, That when the people of God have sinfully come to <HI>Imitate</HI> the <HI>Evil manners</HI> of <HI>other Nations,</HI> God hath made <HI>those</HI> very Nations to be a sore scourge unto them. And the sense of This was that which long ago caused many sensible persons, to foretel, which of the <HI>Neighbour Nations,</HI> would bring our dear <HI>England</HI> Low. Now, since the INDIANS have been made by our God, <HI>The Rod of His Anger,</HI> 'tis proper for us to <HI>Enquire,</HI> whether we have not in some Instances too far Imitated the <HI>evil manners</HI> of the <HI>Indians</HI>? The <HI>Indians</HI> are Infamous especially for Three Scan∣dalous Vices. First, They are <HI>Lyars</HI> of the first magnitude; One cannot believe a word they speak. Secondly, They are <HI>Sluggards</HI> to a proverb; they are for any way of Living rather than work. Thirdly, They are abominably

Indulgent unto their <HI>Children</HI>; there is no <HI>Fami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly Government</HI> among them. Will you now <HI>En<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quire,</HI> Sirs, how far we have <HI>Indianized</HI> in every one, but especially, the last of these <HI>Evil Manners</HI>▪ If we find these <HI>Indian-Vices</HI> to grow Epidemica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> among us, Oh! don't wonder, that our God hath been, with <HI>Indian Hatchets</HI> cutting down the <HI>Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>▪ that brings forth <HI>Fruits</HI> thus disagreeable to Him that Planted it.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Whoso is wise, will Observe these thing</HI>▪ And yet the <HI>Observation</HI> may Extend it self a little further. Sometimes, the Soveraign God chooses a Nation Remarkably laudable, for some <HI>Good Thing,</HI> to punish His own people, for the want o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Thing. Thus, when the <HI>Christian Churches</HI> fell into <HI>Idolatry,</HI> God sent the <HI>Mahome∣tans</HI> upon them, to <HI>Torment</HI> them with one <HI>Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> after another horribly; and the <HI>Mahometans</HI> are very Remarkable for this, That they are Great Haters of <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and wherever they come, they destroy those <HI>Idols, and works of mens Hands,</HI> which are Adored in the <HI>Antichristian Apostacy.</HI> Well, But can any <HI>Good Thing</HI> be reported of our <HI>Indian</HI> Invaders? Yes, there is one <HI>Good Thing</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> have taught them; There is <HI>Family-Prayer</HI> among them, a daily <HI>Family-Worship</HI> uphold among them. <HI>I Fear, I Fear,</HI> this is more than can be said of many <HI>English</HI> Suffe∣rers, that have been annoy'd by those <HI>Indian</HI>-In∣vaders.

And first of all, You that are our Honoured <HI>Shepherds</HI>; Will you <HI>Observe</HI> how many of our <HI>Shepherds</HI> have been worried unto Death, by the <HI>Scythian Wolves</HI> of our Wilder∣ness? Two of our MAGISTRATES, have been Treacherously and Barbarously Killed by the <HI>Indian Murderers:</HI> They whom God En∣trusted with the <HI>Sword of Justice</HI> have had their Lives taken away by the <HI>Sword of the Wicked.</HI> I perswade my self, that the rest will be so wise as to <HI>Observe these things,</HI> and <HI>Observe</HI> how to answer the just Expectation of God, in their Administrations. After this, Oh! Why should not our <HI>Civil Rulers,</HI> with more zeal than ever set themselves to ponder, <HI>How may I most Glorify God, and Christ, and Serve his dear people with my Opportunities!</HI></P>
<P>Two of our MINISTERS▪ have been <HI>Struck down</HI> into the Earth by the <HI>Indian Dragons.</HI> They that have used nothing but the <HI>Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God,</HI> for the Sa∣ving of all about them, have had the <HI>Destroyers coming upon them,</HI> and have been <HI>Waited for of the Sword.</HI> I assure my self, that the rest will be so <HI>wise,</HI> as to <HI>Observe these things,</HI> and <HI>Observe</HI> how to fulfil our Ministry, with a very Excited Watchfulness. May all our <HI>Settled Pastors,</HI> upon such a thing befalling our Brethren, Resolve with themselves; <HI>Am unworthy I spared? I will

do more for my Lord, and more for my Flock, and more for all the Churches, than ever I did.</HI></P>
<P>We will pass on, There have been some <HI>Rich men,</HI> that were finely Scituated, and <HI>had all things Richly to Enjoy</HI>: But this <HI>War</HI> has reduced them to such Necessity, that within Less than One year, they have come to <HI>Beg their Bread</HI>: All their <HI>Treasures</HI> have been <HI>Treasures of Snow</HI>; One Summer has melted all away to Nothing. I Remember, the Jewish <HI>Talmuds</HI> tell us, of a Gentlewoman, who had a Thousand Thou∣sand pieces of Gold▪ given with her, at her Marriage, by her Father <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> for her Portion; and yet she was reduced unto such penury, that she pick'd Barley-Corns out of the Cattles Dung for her Food. Have not we seen almost such Vicissitudes? <HI>Rich men,</HI> If you are <HI>Wise,</HI> (which the <HI>Rich</HI> are <HI>not alwayes!</HI>) You will <HI>Observe these things,</HI> and upon the <HI>Observation</HI> say, <HI>Well, What man in his Right Wits, will now set his Heart upon such Transitory, as all Sublunary Vanities! Oh! my Soul, Do thou make sure of a Better and a Last∣ing Substance in Heaven; for Earthly Riches, take themselves Wings, and flee away towards Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Again, There have been abundance of <HI>Poor men,</HI> who have been by this <HI>War</HI> plunged still into deeper <HI>Poverty</HI>: They have gone without a <HI>Bit of Bread,</HI> for many dayes toge∣ther.
<PB N="220" REF="000873_0219_0FAC936E6187A228"/>
The Straits, the Wants, the Cares of <HI>Widows,</HI> and <HI>Orphans,</HI> or of those that have had many mouths to Feed, especially in our Exposed Frontiers; None can Express them, None can Conceive them, but They, (Nor <HI>They</HI>!) who did Endure them all. <HI>Poor men,</HI> If you are <HI>wise,</HI> (which the <HI>Poor</HI> may be!) You will <HI>Observe these things,</HI> and upon the <HI>Observation,</HI> say, <HI>Well, I had need make sure that my Soul may not be Starved by wanting the Bread of Life, and that my Soul may not be Na∣ked without the Garments of Righteousness; How dolefully am I circumstanced, if I go down from one Hell unto another at the Last!</HI></P>
<P>Once more; How many <HI>Women</HI> have been made a <HI>prey</HI> to those <HI>Bruitish men,</HI> that are <HI>Skil∣ful to Destroy?</HI> How many a <HI>Fearful Thing</HI> has been suffered by the <HI>Fearful Sex,</HI> from those <HI>men,</HI> that one would <HI>Fear</HI> as <HI>Devils</HI> rather than men? Let the <HI>Daughters</HI> of our <HI>Zion</HI> think with themselves, what it would be, for fierce <HI>Indians</HI> to break into their Houses, and brain their <HI>Hus∣bands</HI> and their <HI>Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dren</HI> before their Eyes, and Lead them away a Long Journey into the <HI>Woods</HI>; and if they began to <HI>fail</HI> and <HI>faint</HI> in the Journey, then for a Tawny Salvage to come with Hell fire in his Eyes, and cut 'em down with his Hatchet; or, if they could miraculously <HI>hold out,</HI> then for some Filthy and ugly <HI>Squaw's</HI> to become their <HI>insolent Mistresses,</HI> and insolently

to abuse 'em at their pleasure a thousand inex∣pressible ways; and, if they had any of their <HI>Sucking Infants</HI> with them, then to see those Tender Infants handled at such a rate, that they should beg of the <HI>Tygres,</HI> to dispatch 'em out of hand. Such things as these, I tell you, have often happened in this Lamentable <HI>War.</HI> And now, O ye Handmaids of the Lord; will you not be so <HI>wise,</HI> as to <HI>Observe these things?</HI> But upon the <HI>Observation,</HI> say, <HI>Well, I will Bless God, for my Enjoyments; my Afflictions, be they never so many, are not such as my Neighbours have seen: My Enjoyments are more than my Afflictions. But, Oh! Let me Love and Serve the Good God, that has distinguished me with His Mercies.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be added; We have had our <HI>Old men</HI> whose <HI>Gray Hairs have not come down to the Grave in peace. Young Indians</HI> have with grievous Flouts and Wounds, Butchered many of our <HI>Old English men.</HI> The <HI>Gray Hairs</HI> of our <HI>Old men,</HI> have been Dyed Red with their own Blood; and their Carcases have been thrown unto the <HI>Swine,</HI> to mangle them. <HI>Old men,</HI> If you are <HI>Wise men,</HI> you will <HI>Observe</HI> these things; but <HI>Observing</HI> of them, say, <HI>Oh! Let my Hoary Head be found in the way of Righ∣teousness</HI>!</P>
<P>But our <HI>Young men</HI> are they whom the Fury of <HI>War,</HI> hath been chiefly poured out upon. Alas, Alas, for our <HI>Young men!</HI> They are the

persons, with whom, it seems to have been the very Errand of this <HI>War,</HI> to manage the terrible Controversy of God. <HI>New-England</HI> sets a pe∣culiar Accent of Grief upon this, among all her Lamentations; <HI>The Lord has trodden under foot my mighty men in the midst of me, He hath called an Assembly against me, to crush my young men.</HI> Come then, My <HI>Young men</HI>; Be so <HI>Wise,</HI> as to <HI>Observe</HI> these things; and upon the <HI>Observation,</HI> say, <HI>Lord, Let not me, and the rest of my Generation, continue among the Generation of thy Wrath.</HI> Yea, to have done; <HI>Children</HI> also have not been Ex∣cused from a share in the Blows of this hideous <HI>War.</HI> Little <HI>Boyes</HI> and <HI>Girls,</HI> even these Little <HI>Chickens,</HI> have been Siezed by the <HI>Indian</HI> Vul∣tures.

the Soveraignty of Heaven In the Things that have been done to our <HI>Captives,</HI> the Great <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> hath dealt with us as <HI>Generals</HI> use to do, upon the Sedition and Mutiny of <HI>Military Le∣gions</HI>: He makes a sort of <HI>Decimation</HI> among the Offenders, and by what He does to some, He declares what He might justly do to all the rest. We must all ascribe it unto the meer <HI>Soveraign mercy</HI> of God, that we are not every one of us, <HI>broken in the place of Dragons,</HI> as these desolate Captives were. That which the Scripture calls, <HI>The place of Dragons,</HI> I Remember one of the Jewish Rabbi's Expounds, <HI>A Wilderness.</HI> Truly our <HI>Wilderness</HI> hath been, <HI>The place of Dragons.</HI> But, while we <HI>Observe these things,</HI> we shall not be <HI>Wise,</HI> if we do not Learn, <HI>Oh! what an E∣vil and a bitter thing is our Sin!

<P N="6"><HI>VI.</HI> In the WAR that hath been upon us, <HI>Whoso is wise, may observe,</HI> a <HI>Work,</HI> a <HI>Strange Work</HI> of Heaven, as it were <HI>Devising</HI> of wayes, very strangely to Distress all sorts of people, in all sorts of Interests. Truly the very Character of our Calamity, hath all along been This; The Great God has written still upon it, we may Read upon it in a very Legible Character, those words, in Jer. 18.11. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I Frame Evil against you, I devise a De∣vice

against you.</HI> It hath been, as if wayes had been deliberately, and exquisitely <HI>Studied,</HI> and as if with much <HI>Contrivance</HI> plotted for to bring us all within the Reach of the general Calamity. We have now Languished thro' <HI>Ten Years,</HI> which have been the Saddest, and the Darkest, and the <HI>Stormiest Years,</HI> that ever we saw. If the <HI>History</HI> of these <HI>Ten Years</HI> were to be written, I am thinking, What should be the <HI>Title</HI>; Truly, It might be Entituled, as <HI>Ezekiels</HI> Roll was, <HI>La∣mentation, and Mourning, and Wo.</HI> Yea, you shall now have the <HI>History</HI> of these <HI>Ten Years</HI> written for you; I'l give it you, in as Expres∣sive words as can be; even in those words, 2 Chron. 15.5, 6. <HI>In those Times, there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great Vexations were upon all the Inhabitants of the Countreys, for God did vex them with all Ad∣versity.</HI> There is a Variety of <HI>Adversity,</HI> with which the tedious <HI>War</HI> it self hath <HI>vexed</HI> us. The General Fate of the <HI>War,</HI> hath involved <HI>Numberless Families</HI> in several circumstances of <HI>Adversity</HI>; and the <HI>Expensive</HI> part of the <HI>War</HI> hath been an heavy Scourge of <HI>Adversity</HI> upon those that could not be reach'd by the <HI>Destruct∣ive</HI> part of it. You could not but <HI>Observe these things</HI>: But then, have you not <HI>observed,</HI> what a further variety of <HI>Adversity</HI> hath been <HI>Contem∣porary</HI> with this <HI>Vexatious War.</HI> Alas, There hath been such a <HI>Complication</HI> of other Distresses add∣ed

unto the <HI>War,</HI> in the Time of it,, that <HI>no-bo∣dy,</HI> No, I say, <HI>No-body</HI> hath been left free from those Dolorous Ejulations, <HI>I am one that hath been Afflicted by the Rod of the Wrath of God.</HI></P>
<P>A Great King of <HI>Persia,</HI> having by Death lost the nearest Relation he had in the world, and being too passionate a Mourner for his Loss, an Ingenious man undertook, to Raise the Dead Relation, unto Life again, if the King would but furnish him in one point, that he apprehended necessary; It was demanded, <HI>What that was?</HI> and it was replied, <HI>Furnish me but with the Names of Three persons, who have never met with any Sadness and Sorrow, and by Writing those Names on the Monument of the Dead, I'l bring the Dead per∣son to Life.</HI> Truly, The <HI>Ten Years</HI> of our <HI>War</HI> have set many <HI>Ten Hundreds</HI> of persons a Mour∣ning over their <HI>Dead Friends</HI>; we have seen e∣very where, <HI>The Mourners go about the Streets</HI>: Now, I durst make you this offer; that if you can find <HI>Three persons,</HI> who have met with no matter of <HI>Sadness</HI> and <HI>Sorrow</HI> in these <HI>Ten Years,</HI> with the Names of them, we'l fetch your <HI>Dead Friends</HI> to Life again. It was said, in Job 21.17. <HI>God Distributeth Sorrows in His Anger.</HI> You may <HI>Observe</HI> a marvellous <HI>Distribution of Sorrows</HI> made among us, by the <HI>Anger</HI> of God.</P>
<P>And here, first, I say nothing of that Amazing Time, when the <HI>Evil Angels</HI> in a praeternatural and in an unparallel'd manner being Let Loose
<PB N="228" REF="000873_0227_0FAC9377A2F63DB8"/>
among us; <HI>God cast upon us the Fierceness of His Anger, &amp; Wrath and Indignation and Trouble.</HI> It was the Threatning of God against a peo∣ple, which He had call'd His <HI>Children</HI>; in Deut. 32.23, 24. <HI>I will Heap Mischiefs upon them, I will Spend my Arrows upon them, they shall be Devoured with a Bitter Destruction</HI>; What was the <HI>Bitter Destruction</HI> thus Threat∣ned unto an Apostatizing People? I remem∣ber, the famous Jew <HI>Onkelos</HI> renders it, <HI>They shall be vexed with Evil Spirits</HI>; and indeed, that Sense well agrees with what follows, <HI>I will send upon them the poison of the Serpents of the Dust.</HI> Syrs, For our <HI>Apostasy</HI> (which is the very Sin of the <HI>Evil Spirits</HI>!) the God of Heaven, a while ago turned in the <HI>Armies of Hell</HI> upon us; and in that matchless Dis∣pensation of God, we underwent a <HI>Bitter De∣struction,</HI> from the <HI>poison of the Serpents of the Dust.</HI></P>
<P>But there are other points, not a few, where∣in the Great God hath <HI>Heaped Mischiefs</HI> upon us; and fulfill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d unto us that Holy Commi∣nation, Ezek. 7.26 <HI>Mischief shall come upon mis∣chief.</HI> What shall I say? While the <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> hath been against us, the <HI>Hosts of Lord</HI> have been so too; All the <HI>Elements</HI> have as it were been up in Arms against us.</P>
<P>Particularly; You may <HI>Observe,</HI> That Epide∣mical <HI>Sicknesses,</HI> have in these years, been once
<PB N="229" REF="000873_0228_0FAC9378250ECD18"/>
and again upon us; wherein <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Angels of Death,</HI> have Shot the <HI>Arrows of Death,</HI> into such as could not be reached by the <HI>Bullets</HI> of the <HI>Indian</HI> Ene∣my. This one Town, did in one year, loose, I suppose, at least Six or Seven Hundred of its People, by one conragious Mortality. And tho' of about Three and Twenty Hundred men, that we Employ'd in one Action, we did, in that Action, loose hardly Thirty men, yet how many Hundreds did afterwards miserably perish?</P>
<P>Again; You may <HI>Observe,</HI> That the <HI>Harvest,</HI> hath once and again grievously failed in these years; and we have been <HI>Struck thro' with the Terrible Famine,</HI> almost as much as if the <HI>Indian</HI> Enemy had been all the while Skulking about our Fields. The very <HI>Course of Nature</HI> hath been altered among us; A Lamentable cry for, <HI>Bread, Bread</HI>! hath been heard in our Streets: The Towns that formerly Supplyed other places with <HI>Grain,</HI> had now been <HI>Famished,</HI> if other places had not sent in a Supply to Them, and had a black prospect of being Famished, notwithstanding that Supply.</P>
<P>Once more; You may <HI>Observe,</HI> That the <HI>Sea</HI> hath in these years been Swallowing up our <HI>Neighbours,</HI> and their <HI>Estates,</HI> far more than the <HI>Sword of the Wilderness.</HI> Alas, The Devouring Displeasure of God, hath said concerning us, <HI>Though they go to hide themselves from my Sight afar
<PB N="230" REF="000873_0229_0FAC9379262DD1A8"/>
off upon the Sea, Thence will I command the Serpent, and he shall bite them.</HI> And here, hath it been <HI>Enough,</HI> that our Vessels, enough to make an huge Fleet, have been taken by the <HI>French Ene∣my?</HI> A certain Writer hath computed it, That in only the First Two or Three years of the <HI>War,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> Nation lost unto the <HI>French,</HI> more than Fifteen Millions or Pounds Sterling. But no part of the <HI>English</HI> Nation hath been more frequently or sensibly prey'd upon, by the <HI>French,</HI> than what hath gone out of <HI>New England,</HI> eversince the <HI>War</HI> began. I say, Ha's this been <HI>Enough?</HI> No, The wrath of God said, <HI>This is not Enough!</HI> I appeal to you, that have been <HI>Owners</HI> of Vessels, or <HI>Sailors</HI> in them, whether horrible <HI>Shipwracks</HI> have not been multiplied since the <HI>War</HI> began, very much more than ever they were before? <HI>Ah, Lord!</HI> How many of us, have Shed <HI>Rivers of Tears,</HI> over our dear Friends that have been <HI>Buried in the Ocean!</HI></P>
<P>Moreover; You may <HI>Observe,</HI> That in these years, those very Things which were intended for our <HI>Defence,</HI> have oftentimes been so much Improved for our <HI>Damage,</HI> that it was hard for us to say, which was the Greater, the <HI>Defence,</HI> or the <HI>Damage,</HI> which we had from them. It was a Lamen∣table Time with the <HI>Jewes,</HI> when that <HI>Curse</HI> came upon them, <HI>That which should have been for their Wel∣fare, Let it become a Trap, &amp; pour out thine Indignation upon them.</HI> Truly, The <HI>Indignation</HI> of God hath been <HI>poured out</HI> upon us, in this Fruit of the <HI>Curse,</HI> no

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess frequently then sensibly, that some things which should have been <HI>for our Welfare,</HI> have at the same time, served also to <HI>Entrap</HI> the <HI>Persons,</HI> and <HI>Interests</HI> of many people, into sore Incon∣veniencies. There is no need of Explaining this Article; They that have been under this <HI>Indig∣nation</HI> of God, know the Explaining of it!</P>
<P>Finally, You may <HI>Observe,</HI> What <HI>Untimely Ends,</HI> and what <HI>Surprizing Fates,</HI> have come up∣on our <HI>Sons,</HI> in these <HI>Years of the Wrath of the Right-Hand of the Most High.</HI> When <HI>Craesus</HI> was in <HI>War</HI> taken by <HI>Cyrus,</HI> this Captive made unto the Conqueror, this Remark upon the Diffe∣rence between <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>War; O Syr, I see, that in a time of Peace, the Sons Bury their Fathers, but in a Time of War, the Fathers Bury their Sons.</HI> Truly, Sirs, our Time of <HI>War</HI> has in <HI>Various Wayes</HI> of Morta∣lity, been Embittered with this Remark, <HI>The Fa∣thers have been Burying their Sons, all the Countrey over!</HI> Many of us, have had our <HI>Sons,</HI> even those very <HI>Sons,</HI> of whom we said, <HI>This same shall Comfort us!</HI> We have had them violently snatch'd away from us, and Cropt in the very Flower of their <HI>Youth</HI>; and they have Lest us deploring, <HI>Oh, my Son, with all my Heart could I have Dy∣ed for thee, my Son, my Son</HI>! But in the midst of these Deplorable Things, God hath given up several of our Sons, into the Hands of the Fierce <HI>Monsters</HI> of <HI>Africa. Mahometan</HI> Turks and Moors, and Devils, are at this Day oppressing many of

our Sons, with a <HI>Slavery,</HI> wherein they <HI>Wish for Death, and cannot find it</HI>; a <HI>Slavery,</HI> from whence they cry and write unto us, <HI>It had been Good for us, that we had never been Born.</HI></P>
<Q><L>—Quis talia fando</L>
<L>Temperet a Lacrymis?—</L></Q>
<P>Thus, as <HI>Job</HI> sometimes complained, Chap. 10.17. <HI>Thou Renewest thy Witnesses against me, and increasest thine Indignation upon me; Changes and War are against me:</HI> Thus, in our Long <HI>War,</HI> we have seen those <HI>Changes</HI> on all Hands, and in all Kinds, which have <HI>witnessed</HI> against us, the Dreadful <HI>Indignation</HI> of God. God Threatned His people, (so I read it,) Amos 2.13. <HI>Behold, I will press your place as a full Cart presses the Sheaf:</HI> ['Tis an Allusion to the old way of Threshing the <HI>Corn,</HI> by drawing a Loaden <HI>Cart</HI> with <HI>Wheels,</HI> over the <HI>Corn. q. d..</HI> You shall undergo <HI>Tribula∣tion.</HI>] Ah, <HI>New<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>England,</HI> Thou hast been under such a <HI>Tribulation.</HI></P>
<P>Syrs, Have you not <HI>Observed</HI> these things? But you must <HI>wisely Observe</HI> them. And a <HI>wise Observation</HI> of these things, will cause you to see, <HI>That the War which hath been upon us, hath been a War of GOD.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> have been but a small part of those <HI>Armies,</HI> which the Great GOD, hath been bringing out against us, for <HI>Ten Years</HI> together; and we may conclude,
<PB N="233" REF="000873_0232_0FAC937B4E8646E8"/>
that <HI>all the Land</HI> have been more or less con∣cerned in those Crimes, for which the Almighty GOD, hath been with these <HI>Armies</HI> managing His Controvesy with us▪ Our Confession must be, <HI>Peccavimus omnes; We have all gone astray</HI>! But shall we not upon this <HI>Observation,</HI> take up some <HI>Resolution</HI>? If we are <HI>Wise,</HI> we shall thus <HI>Resolve; 'Tis Time, 'Tis Time, 'Tis High-Time for us, to make our Peaee with God, Oh, Let us not go on to Harden our selves against God; we are not Stronger than He: But let us all Fly to the Lord Jesus C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rist, who is our Peace, and so lay down the Arms of Rebellion, that God may be Reconciled unto us.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><HI>VII.</HI> In the WAR that hath been upon us, <HI>Whoso is wise, may Observe</HI> those <HI>Dispensations</HI> of Heaven towards us, that have carryed more than Ordinary <HI>Humiliations</HI> in them.

Numb. 12.14. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f her Father had Spit in her Face, should she not be Ashamed?</HI> Ah <HI>New England,</HI> Thy <HI>Father</HI> hath been <HI>Spitting in thy Face</HI>▪ with most <HI>Humbling Dispensations</HI>; God hath been bringing of thee <HI>down to Sit in the Dust.</HI> When the <HI>War</HI> commenced, <HI>New-England</HI> might say, <HI>My God will Humble me</HI>!</P>
<P>For, First; Shall our Heavenly <HI>Father</HI> put a <HI>Rod</HI> into the Hands of base <HI>Indians,</HI> and bid <HI>Them</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="000873_0233_0FAC937DE5F6B448"/>
to Scourge His <HI>Children</HI>! Oh! the <HI>Humiliation</HI> of such Rebellious <HI>Children</HI>! Oh! the <HI>Provocation</HI> that certainly such <HI>Sons</HI> and such <HI>Daughters</HI> have given Him! It was a very <HI>Humbling</HI> thing, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Lord Threatned unto His <HI>Provoking Sons &amp; Daughters,</HI> in Deut. 32.21. <HI>I will move them to Jealousy, with those which are not a People; I will provoke them to Anger with a Foolish Nation</HI>▪ Should a Child of yours be Refractory, and you, Sir, should bid a <HI>Negro</HI> or an <HI>Indian</HI> Slave in your House, <HI>Go, Take that Child, and Scourge him till you fetch Blood of him</HI>! Surely, this would be to <HI>Humble</HI> him <HI>unto the Uttermost.</HI> Thus doth thy God <HI>Humble</HI> thee, O <HI>New-England,</HI> by putting thee over, into the Vile Hands of those which are <HI>not a People, but a Foolish Nation.</HI></P>
<P>Again; <HI>Who</HI> are they, by whose means we are now crying out, <HI>We are Brought very Low</HI>? When the most High God, was determined Effectually to <HI>Humble,</HI> His People, He said, in Jer. 37.10. <HI>Though ye had Smitten the whole Army of the Caldeans, that fight against you, and there re∣mained but wounded men among them, yet should they Rise up every man in his Tent; and burn this City with Fire.</HI> Truly, we had <HI>Smitten the whole Army,</HI> of the <HI>Indians</HI> that <HI>Fought</HI> against us Three and Twenty years ago, from one end of the Land unto the other; only there were left a few <HI>Wounded men among them</HI> in the East; and now, they have <HI>Risen up every man,</HI> and have set the
<PB N="235" REF="000873_0234_0FAC937F53FD89D8"/>
whole Country on <HI>Fire.</HI> Certainly, A more <HI>Humbling</HI> matter cannot be Related!</P>
<P>Moreover; Is it not a very <HI>Humbling</HI> Thing, That when about an <HI>Hundred Indians</HI> durst Begin a <HI>War,</HI> upon all these Populous Colonies, an Army of a <HI>Thousand English</HI> raised, must not kill one of them all; but instead thereof, more of our <HI>Souldiers</HI> perish by Sickness and Hardship than we had <HI>Enemies</HI> then in the world? <HI>Our God ha's Humbled us</HI>!</P>
<P>Is it not a very <HI>Humbling</HI> Thing, That when the Number of our <HI>Enemies</HI> afterwards Increased, yet an Handful of them should, for so many Summers together continue our <HI>Unconquered Spoilers,</HI> and put us to such Vast Charges, that if we could have Bought them, for <HI>an Hundred Pound an Head,</HI> we should have made a Saving Bargain of it? <HI>Our God ha's Humbled us</HI>!</P>
<P>Is it not a very <HI>Humbling</HI> Thing, That we should have had several fair <HI>Opportunities,</HI> to have brought this <HI>War</HI> unto a <HI>Final Period,</HI> but we should still by some <HI>fatal Oversight</HI> let Slip those <HI>Oppor∣tunities? Our God ha's Humbled us.</HI></P>
<P>Is it not a very <HI>Humling</HI> Thing, That whatever <HI>Expeditions</HI> we have undertaken, for the most part we have come off <HI>Loosers,</HI> and indeed but plunged our selves into <HI>deeper Straits,</HI> by our <HI>Undertakings? Our God ha's Humbled us</HI>!</P>
<P>Is it not a very <HI>Humbling</HI> Thing, That more than One or Two of our <HI>Forts</HI> have been Sur∣rendred,
<PB N="236" REF="000873_0235_0FAC93818F3979E8"/>
and one of them that was almost Im∣pregnable, given away with a most <HI>Shameful Sur∣render,</HI> by one that hath since Received Some∣thing of what he Deserved? Thus, <HI>Our God ha's Humbled us.</HI></P>
<P>Is it not a very <HI>Humbling</HI> Thing, That we should have <HI>Evil pursuing of us</HI> at such a rate, that in other Lands afar off, and on the <HI>Exchange</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> Strangers have made this Reflection, <HI>Doubtless,</HI> New-England <HI>is a Countrey in Ill Terms with Heaven?</HI> But so, <HI>Our God has Humbled us.</HI></P>
<P>What shall I say? Is it not a very <HI>Humbling</HI> Thing, That when <HI>Peace</HI> is Restored unto the whole <HI>English Nation,</HI> and when <HI>Peace</HI> is Enjoy'd by all <HI>America,</HI> poor <HI>New-England</HI> should be the <HI>Only Land</HI> still Embroil'd in <HI>War</HI>? But thus, <HI>Our God, Thou hast Humbled us, and shown us great and sore Troubles, and brought us down into the Depths of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>O my dear People; How can I <HI>Observe these Things,</HI> and not like <HI>Joshua</HI> now <HI>fall to the Earth on my Face before the Lord,</HI> and say, <HI>What shall I say?</HI> But if you will <HI>wisely observe these Things,</HI> you will now <HI>get up, and Sanctify your selves,</HI> and <HI>put away the accursed thing from among you,</HI> O New-English <HI>Israel</HI>!</P>
<P>Certainly, The <HI>High and Lofty One,</HI> who <HI>dwells in the High and Holy place,</HI> Expects that we should be a very <HI>Humbled People.</HI> I beseech you, Sirs, <HI>Observing these Things,</HI> let us in all the Methods
<PB N="237" REF="000873_0236_0FAC9381F4A03AA0"/>
of Repentance <HI>Humble our selves under the Mighty Hand of God.</HI> After such <HI>Humbling</HI> Things, as have befallen us, God forbid, that it should be said of us, as in Jer. 44.10. <HI>They are not Humbled, even unto this Day</HI>!</P>
<P N="8"><HI>VIII.</HI> In the WAR that hath been upon us, <HI>Whoso is Wise, may Observe</HI> the <HI>Compassions</HI> of God, wonderfully Exercised, and Manifested, and Magnified, in the midst of our <HI>Confusions.</HI> There was a Time, when a <HI>Bush Burned with Fire, and yet the Bush was not consumed</HI>: whereupon said <HI>Moses,</HI> in Exod. 3.3. <HI>I will now Turn aside and see this Great Sight!</HI> Sirs, I am now to call upon you, <HI>O Turn aside, and see such a Great Sight as that!</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, in the midst of all our <HI>Lamentations,</HI> we must own, with the Church, in Lam. 3:22. <HI>It is of the Lords Mercies, that we are not Consumed, because His Compassions fail not.</HI> But there are ma∣ny Particular and Astonishing <HI>Articles</HI> of <HI>Mercy,</HI> which, we have seen in this Tedious <HI>War.</HI> Sirs, Come now to <HI>Observe</HI> some of those Things, with prepared <HI>Hallelujahs</HI>!</P>
<P>It was the Petition, in Hab. 3.2. <HI>O Lord, In Wrath Remember Mercy. New-England,</HI> Thy God hath heard this Petition for thee, in very wonderful Instances!</P>
<P>For, First, After a very Amazing manner ha's <HI>Mercy</HI> been <HI>Remembred</HI> in the midst of <HI>Wrath,</HI>
<PB N="238" REF="000873_0237_0FAC9382B8EC76C8"/>
when we have been Rescued by the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God, at the very point of our being else Ruined by <HI>His Wrath.</HI> Lord, <HI>Thou hast shewed thy People hard Things, and made us Drink the Wine of Asto∣nishment.</HI> But our <HI>Extremity</HI> hath been Gods <HI>Opportunity,</HI> to Relieve us. Several Times in the late years of our Affliction, we have been brought unto a dismal <HI>Non-plus</HI> in our Affayrs, and we would scarce imagine i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> possible for us to subsist any longer. But just <HI>Then</HI>! the Bowels of our Compassionate God have been moved for us; He hath said, <HI>How shall I give thee up, O</HI> New-England? <HI>How shall I give thee up,</HI> O Massachusetts? And so, He would not <HI>Execute upon us the Fierceness of His Anger,</HI> but with some unexpected Succours from the <HI>Machin of Heaven</HI> He hath Relieved us. We have several times been, Like a Little Vessel in a <HI>Storm</HI>; the Swelling Waves have Dashed, &amp; Ra∣ged, and Roared; the Rude Billows have been going over us, and we have been ready to <HI>Sink.</HI> But just <HI>Then</HI>! Our Compassionate Lord Jesus Christ, hath <HI>Awaked</HI> for our Safety, and mar∣vellously calmed our Circumstances. O thou Land, strangely Saved by the Lord, say now, as in Psal. 136.23. <HI>O Give thanks unto the Lord, who Remembred us in our Low Estate, because His Mer∣cy Endureth for ever.</HI> When our <HI>Debts</HI> have be∣come Insupportable, God has then <HI>Remembred us in our Low Estate, because His Mercy Endureth
<PB N="239" REF="000873_0238_0FAC938372DBC680"/>
for ever,</HI> and strangely Extricated us. When our <HI>Foes</HI> have been as an <HI>Overflowing Scourge,</HI> like to carry all before them, God has then <HI>Remembred us in our Low Estate, because His Mercy Endureth for ever,</HI> and strangely Lifted up a Standard a∣gainst them. When fearful <HI>Divisions</HI> have arisen among us, and horrid <HI>Convulsions</HI> have been rea∣dy to pull all to pieces,—I don't care to <HI>Remem∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er</HI> them, any farther than to say, God has then, <HI>Remembred us in our Low Estate, because His Mer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Endureth for ever,</HI> and strangely healed those <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reaches,</HI> that set the Land a <HI>Trembling.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover; It hath been a very <HI>Strange Thing,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd a Wondrous <HI>Remembrance</HI> of <HI>Mercy</HI> in the midst of <HI>Wrath</HI>; That the <HI>Indians</HI> have been <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>naccountably Restrained,</HI> from giving us, an Hun∣dredth part of the Trouble, which the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> might have done, had they but <HI>known, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> their own Advantages. This One Thing, Whosoever does <HI>wisely Observe</HI> it, must needs ascribe it unto a Special Operation of that God, who <HI>Forms the Spirit of man within him.</HI> It was the promise of God, unto His people, Exod. 34.24. <HI>No man shall Desire thy Land, when thou shalt go up to ap∣pear before the Lord thy God.</HI> The Faithful God strangely Fulfilled this promise, for many Hun∣dreds of years together; <HI>No Enemy desired the Land</HI> of that people, at the Time of their going up to Worship the Lord in His Temple. And whereas, the <HI>Roman Enemy,</HI> did at length <HI>Desire
<PB N="240" REF="000873_0239_0FAC93841FBEB580"/>
their Land,</HI> at the Time of their going up to the <HI>Passover,</HI> this one bring, was enough to prove, that the <HI>Messiah</HI> was come, and the <HI>Passover</HI> no longer commanded. It shows, That there is a <HI>Strange Operation</HI> of God, upon the <HI>minds</HI> of men, to curb and check, and blind the <HI>Evil-min∣ded.</HI> Well; We have had our <HI>Frontier Towns,</HI> in many of which, the Lord Jesus Christ hath been Worshipped, and Sought, and Serv'd con∣tinually. Had the Lurking <HI>Enemy</HI> done as they might have done, how easily might one dozen of them, have kept the Towns in such perpetu∣al and perplexing <HI>Alarms,</HI> as would have caused them, even to have broken up! And what <HI>un∣known mischiefs</HI> might a few more of 'em, have brought upon our Scattered Plantations. I do again, and again say, This is from the <HI>Strange Operation</HI> of God, upon the <HI>Minds</HI> of the Ene∣my, that they have no more <HI>Disturbed our Land.</HI> For my own part, I will <HI>observe</HI> it, and <HI>Admire</HI> it, in such Terms as <HI>Austin</HI> used upon a Remar∣kable Providence; <HI>Quisquis non videt, Caecus; Quisquis videt, nec Laudat, Ingratus; Quisquis Laudanti reluctatur, Insanus</HI>: They are <HI>Blind,</HI> and <HI>Mad,</HI> that are Insensible of it!</P>
<P>Yet again, Have not our <HI>English Prisoners</HI> been favoured with such a <HI>Remembrance of Mer∣cy,</HI> in the <HI>midst of Wrath,</HI> as ought never to be <HI>Forgotten</HI>? The <HI>Mercy</HI> of God, inclined the <HI>French</HI> to Buy 'em out of the Hands of the
<PB N="241" REF="000873_0240_0FAC9384E415DE88"/>
<HI>Indians,</HI> and use them with an Exemplary Hu∣manity and Civility. The <HI>Mercy</HI> of God pre∣served many of them alive, under prodigious and incredible Hardships, and at length Return∣ed many scores of them Home. And may not our <HI>English Women,</HI> that were <HI>Prisoners,</HI> take No∣tice of one Singular <HI>Mercy</HI> shown by God unto them, in preserving them from Violations by the <HI>Outrageous Lusts</HI> of the Salvages? This <HI>One Thing</HI> will be thought by some, almost as Great and Strange an Instance of an Immediate Interposition of the <HI>Angels</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> as the muzzling of the Lions in the Den of <HI>Daniel! O ye Redeemed of the Lord, you, whom He hath Redeemed from the Hand of the Enemy; Give Thanks, to the Lord, for He is Good?</HI> Charge your own Souls, That you <HI>never forget His Benefits</HI>; Ask your own Souls, What you <HI>shall render to the Lord for all His Benefits:</HI> and <HI>Remember</HI> that Admonition of the Lord Je∣sus Christ unto you, <HI>Sin no more, Lest a worse thing do come unto thee.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore; Who could not see <HI>Mercy Re∣membred,</HI> in the midst of <HI>Wrath,</HI> when God hath put it into the Hearts of His people in the <HI>Southern</HI> parts of the Countrey, to make <HI>Liberal Contributions</HI> of <HI>Money,</HI> and <HI>Corn,</HI> and <HI>Men,</HI> for the Relief of the <HI>Northern</HI> parts? More than once, has the Noble <HI>Charity,</HI> of our Brethren in <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> as well as of this
<PB N="242" REF="000873_0241_0FAC9386709E5D88"/>
Town, been Expressed in such <HI>Contributions.</HI> Their <HI>Alms</HI> are <HI>Gone up for a Memorial before the Lord!</HI> The <HI>Blessing</HI> of many that have been <HI>Ready to perish,</HI> hath come upon you, <HI>O ye Merci∣ful Children of God,</HI> and you shall <HI>obtain mercy</HI> from Him.</P>
<P>Once more: Was ever <HI>Mercy Remembred</HI> in the midst of <HI>Wrath,</HI> more conspicuously than when powerful <HI>Adversaries</HI> Designing Inroads upon us, have been Diverted wonderfully. Ad∣vice hath been seasonably Dispatched unto us, of the Intentions in our Enemies to fall upon our Frontiers, and this <HI>Advice</HI> hath proved our <HI>Safety.</HI> Yea, sometimes when we have had no <HI>Advice,</HI> a Strange Direction from Heaven has Led us to those Actions, which have as much defeated the Intentions of our Enemies, as if we had Received the fullest <HI>Advice</HI> in the world. Besides this, <HI>Boston,</HI> and <HI>Salem,</HI> and <HI>Portsmouth</HI> especially: Will they ever forget the <HI>Last year?</HI> It was a <HI>Year of Salvations</HI>; yea, It was a <HI>Year of Miracles!</HI> Never, Never such a <HI>Year</HI> passed o∣ver us. The Almighty show'd that Favour to His people of old, <HI>Zech.</HI> 9.8. <HI>I will Encamp a∣bout my House, because of the Army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that Returneth. Alexander</HI> in an Expedition to the <HI>Southward</HI> did <HI>pass by</HI> the Land of <HI>Israel,</HI> and he did <HI>Return</HI> a∣gain to the <HI>Northward,</HI> without Hurting that Land, that had the <HI>House of God</HI> in it.

<HI>French</HI> Squadrons, have more than once <HI>pas∣sed by,</HI> to the <HI>Southward,</HI> and have <HI>Returned</HI> again to the <HI>Northward,</HI> intending doubtless a <HI>Destroy∣ing Visit</HI> into this Land by the way; but Our Lord Jesus Christ hath <HI>Encamped about His House here, because of the Navy.</HI> Yea, once, O <HI>New-England, the Lord thy God,</HI> He that would be the <HI>Holy One of</HI> New-England, gave <HI>Carthagena</HI> for thy <HI>Ransome,</HI> He <HI>gave men for thee, and</HI> Spani∣ards <HI>for thy Life.</HI> Another Time, when a <HI>Force</HI> likely enough to have carried all before them, were almost arrived unto us, we are advised, that God sent such a sudden, and such a wasting <HI>Sickness</HI> among them, as to make them for want of Hands, to desist from their Attempt. These were Illustrious <HI>Deliverances</HI>! And yet give me leave to say, We did the last year, see another <HI>Deliverance,</HI> that for ought I know, may be aequal to any of the rest. There was an <HI>English Fleet</HI> of our Good Friends with a di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eful Plague a∣board 'em, intending <HI>Hither.</HI> Had they <HI>Come,</HI> as they intended, what an horrible Desolation had cut us off, Let the Desolate places that some of you have seen in the Colonies of the <HI>South,</HI> declare unto us; And that they did <HI>not come,</HI> it was the Signal <HI>Hand of Heaven,</HI> by which the <HI>Goings of men are ordered.</HI></P>
<P>In Fine; Because God, <HI>being full of Compassion,</HI> would not <HI>Stir up all His Wrath,</HI> He hath <HI>Re∣membred Mercy</HI> to us, in the midst of <HI>Wrath,</HI> by
<PB N="244" REF="000873_0243_0FAC9387E0000828"/>
Raising us up Generous <HI>Benefactors,</HI> who have been able and willing to oblige us, with their <HI>Benefits.</HI> It must be with shame acknowledged, Our Usage of our <HI>Publick Servants</HI> has common∣ly been such, that for any <HI>Thinking man,</HI> to be willing at all to <HI>Serve</HI> the <HI>Publick,</HI> seems to be a Mark and Fruit of no little <HI>Generosity.</HI> Never∣theless, we have had persons of Exemplary <HI>Pa∣tience,</HI> and <HI>Prudence,</HI> and <HI>Self denial</HI>▪ Sitting at the <HI>Helm</HI> of our <HI>Government,</HI> all this while that the <HI>Horrible Tempest</HI> hath been enough to make any man living <HI>Sick</HI> of being there.

Yea, we have had, and still have, [I can at this moment fasten my Eye upon some of them, in the Assembly where I am now speaking,] <HI>Brave men,</HI> who have <HI>Bravely Jeoparded their Lives in the High places of the Field,</HI> for our Defence.

'Tis affirm∣ed, That several Times in this <HI>War,</HI> our <HI>Enemies,</HI> have in the Woods met with Parties of <HI>Indians,</HI> which were their <HI>own Friends,</HI> but by a mistake apprehending each to be Enemies unto each o∣ther, they have hotly fallen upon one another, and many have been kill'd on both Sides before the mistake was discovered. Yea, 'Tis affirmed, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> not a few of the Chief <HI>Murderers</HI> among our <HI>Enemies,</HI> have accidentally killed hemselves; the most Murderous <HI>Indians,</HI> have in a little while been their own Executioners. Who can tell, what <HI>Strange Wayes,</HI> the God <HI>unto whom Vengeance belongeth,</HI> hath to inflict it, on a Generation of His <HI>Curse</HI>?</P>
<P>Only, Let us Remember to plead the <HI>Sacrifice of our Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST, in our <HI>Prayer,</HI> with our <HI>Faith,</HI> for the <HI>Perfection</HI> of our <HI>De∣liverance.</HI> Our Lord JESUS CHRIST, hath been a <HI>Sin-Offering for the Congregation,</HI> and a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> pleadeable, not only for <HI>Persons,</HI> but also for <HI>Peoples</HI> that belong unto Him. We read in 1 Sam. 7.9, 10. <HI>Samuel Offered a Burnt-Offering wholly unto the Lord, and Samuel Cryed unto the Lord of Israel, and the Lord heard him; and the Lord Thundred with a Great Thunder on that Day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them.</HI>

When we Cry to the Lord, Let us plead the <HI>Burnt-Offering</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, &amp; plead, That God has more Glorifyed His <HI>Justice</HI> in the Sufferings of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, than if our Houses were all Fill'd with the Cryes of our People Massacred by <HI>Indian</HI> Sal∣vages. <HI>Then</HI> will our God <HI>Thunder with a Great Thunder</HI> of His Consuming Wrath upon our <HI>Indian Philistines</HI>!

Prayers will never be lost!</HI> It will much oftner be Repeated in our Blessed <HI>Experience,</HI> if our <HI>Prayers</HI> do present before God that Blessed <HI>Sa∣crifice,</HI> of which He sayes, <HI>'Tis a Sweet odour o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Me</HI>!</P>

Surely, Thou hast not <HI>hearkened unto Him,</HI> nor <HI>Walked in His Wayes!</HI> In that which was called, <HI>The Holy War,</HI> the Embassadors of a <HI>Saracen Prince,</HI> demanded of a Famous Christian General, How he came to have, <HI>Manus tam Doctas ad Praeliandum, Hands</HI> that were so Able to <HI>Fight</HI>? The Christian General replied, <HI>Quia Manus Semper habui puras,</HI> Because I never de∣filed my <HI>Hands,</HI> with any <HI>Notorious Wickedness.</HI> Alas, our <HI>Hands</HI> have made but poor work at <HI>Fighting.</HI> 'Tis Time for us, then to <HI>Reform</HI> all the <HI>Notorious Wickedness</HI> in our <HI>Hands</HI>!

The Roman Emperour Upbraided his General <HI>Terentius,</HI> for Loosing a Battel; but the General, having too much occasion to say so much, replyed, <HI>Sir, I must tell you, that it is you that L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st the Day for us, by your open Fighting against the God of Heaven as you do.</HI> If it be asked, How 'tis come to pass, that we have Sped so Ill in many a Battel, since this <HI>War</HI> began?

Ungodly Life, <HI>Syrs, 'Tis to you, that we owe all our Ill Success</HI>! I need not quote one of the Ancients, namely, <HI>Ambrose,</HI> for that <HI>Observation, Graviores Inimici sunt mores pravi, quam Hostes Infensi</HI>: We have had enough in our own Ex∣periments to convince us, <HI>That our worst Enemies are our Vices, which provoke Heaven to Chastise us with all our other Enemies:</HI> And indeed, If our <HI>Wayes did please the Lord, our Enemies would be at peace with us. Observe wisely,</HI> and you cannot but <HI>Observe,</HI> the Language of Heaven, in the Circumstances thro' which we have passed for a whole <HI>Decad</HI> of years together, to be That, in Lev. 26.23, 24. <HI>If ye will not be Reformed by me, by these things, but will walk contrary unto me, Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and I will punish you yet seven Times for your Sins.</HI> And that the Demand of REFORMATION may be Loud enough, it arrives to us now with a more than Ordinary Accent of <HI>Authority</HI> upon it. We have seen, and, Blessed be God, that we have seen, the Greatest Monarch that eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sat upon the <HI>British Throne,</HI> Issuing Out His Royal <HI>Proclamation,</HI> upon the Pious Address of the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> assemble in <HI>Par∣liament</HI>; a <HI>Proclamation,</HI> wherein that Illustrious Prince declares His Royal <HI>Resolution</HI> to Discoun∣tenance all <HI>Vice</HI> whatsoever, and requires all <HI>Of∣ficers</HI> whatsoever to be vigilant, in the Discove∣ry, Prosecution, and Punishment thereof. We

have seen a most Excellent GOVERNOUR, who is the Greatest Person that ever set Foot on the English Continent of <HI>America,</HI> beginning His Government, with proclaiming for the Sup∣pression of all Vice in One of His Provinces: That Noble Person has therein done, Like a <HI>Vicegerent</HI> of GOD! His very Honourable <HI>Lieutenant,</HI> hath worthily done His part, with the Advice of His <HI>Council,</HI> in another of His Provinces. If these things prove but meer <HI>For∣malities,</HI> among a people, <HI>Hating to be Reformed</HI> after all, what will they be, but more Terrible Prognosticks of Tremendous and Amazing De∣solations at hand, than so many <HI>Blazing Stars</HI> on Fire, in Heaven over us. It is to be hoped, the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel, will do what be∣longs to Them, for the Assistence of all <HI>Holy Essayes</HI> about <HI>Reformation</HI>; and their <HI>Churches,</HI> if call'd upon, will join with them, in the Me∣thods of <HI>Covenant,</HI> and of <HI>Discipline,</HI> for the pro∣moting of it.
