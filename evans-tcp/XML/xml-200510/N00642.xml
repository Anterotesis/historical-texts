<P>And finding <HI>Disciples,</HI> we tarryed there seven days, Who said to <HI>Paul,</HI> through the <HI>Spirit,</HI> that <HI>he should not go</HI> up to <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> And when <HI>We</HI> had accomplished those days, we departed, and <HI>went our Way,</HI> and <HI>They</HI> all brought us on our Way, with Wives and Chil∣dren, till we were out of the City: And we <HI>KNEELED DOWN ON THE SHORE AND PRAYED.</HI> And when We had taken our Leave, one of another, We took Ship, and They returned home again.</P></Q>

bears the richest <HI>Mines</HI>; Nor can a Child of GOD fall into such a <HI>Case</HI> or <HI>Strait,</HI> as for a plentiful <HI>Relief</HI> whereof, this wonderful Trea∣sury and Store-house is unprovided; So Ado∣rable is the <HI>Fulness</HI> of the <HI>Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>To make an Experiment hereof, I have produced <HI>this Text</HI> at <HI>this</HI> Time, when we are upon taking our Leave of sundry of our dear Brethren, <HI>Ministers</HI> and other <HI>Christians,</HI> now ready to depart from us, unto <HI>divers Places,</HI> upon the Service of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>CHRIST</HI>; Nor am I altogether without hope, that it may prove a <HI>Word in Season,</HI> and useful, at least, to instruct us in some considerable part of our <HI>present Duty</HI>; although between our Case, and the Case in the Text, in some parti∣culars, there be no <HI>Comparison,</HI> or <HI>Parallel.</HI></P>
<P>Our Text is a small Paragraph of the Hi∣story of <HI>Pauls</HI> Adventures: He had been a <HI>Persecutor,</HI> Acts 9 1. but now is a <HI>Propagat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> of the Gospel: and through Soveraign <HI>Good∣ness</HI> He is chosen and made a First Rate Vess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l to bear <HI>Christ's</HI> Name before the <HI>Gentiles</HI> far and near. Yet Rectoral Paternal <HI>Holiness</HI> will shew Him how great things he must suf∣fer, himself, not from <HI>Others</HI> only, but from <HI>Christians</HI> also, <HI>whom</HI> He had made before, the Subj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts of Sufferings.

that Son of Consolation, [Acts 11▪ 1, 2. &amp; 15.39, 40.] But, when, after a large Circuit, (being called by the Spirit from one place to another) He is now bound, in the <HI>Spirit, to go to Jerusalem,</HI> (Acts 20.16, 22, 23.) Behold! the Disciples at <HI>Tyre,</HI> said to <HI>Paul,</HI> by the <HI>Spirit,</HI> that He should <HI>not go</HI> up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> What a perplexing exercise was this to the mind of <HI>Paul!</HI> And doth the <HI>Spirit</HI> indeed first <HI>Bid,</HI> and then <HI>Forbid</HI>? Doth he say <HI>one</HI> thing at <HI>Miletum,</HI> and <HI>another</HI> thing at <HI>Tyre</HI>? I suppose it not: But that when the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> certifyed Them of the Bonds and Afflictions which <HI>Paul</HI> must endure at <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> [as He had before-hand, and did after∣wards also certify <HI>Paul</HI> and other <HI>Saints</HI> of the same, Acts 20.23▪ &amp; 21.11.] then the Dis∣ciples at <HI>Tyre</HI> did [as did the Disciples at <HI>Ce∣sarea,</HI> Acts 21.12.] <HI>by their own Spirits</HI> en∣deavour to disswade Him from this Adventure. Thus, as our Blessed LORD Suffered afflicti∣on from the irregular fondness of <HI>Peter</HI>▪ Mat. 16 22, 23. So <HI>Paul</HI> suffers no small perplex∣ity from his Christian <HI>Friends,</HI> who having a clearer sight and discerning of his <HI>Danger,</HI> than of his <HI>Duty,</HI> and knowing but in part, did ve∣ry ill to intangle the Sacred <HI>Text</HI> of the SPI∣RIT, with their ignorant and fallible, though well meant <HI>Commentarys.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="11" REF="000780_0011_0FAA50609DEF1218"/>But from their Affectionate and Devout Prayers at their last Parting, we may gather this DOCTRINE.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<P>¶ That the very best thing that Disciples of Christ, at taking leave one of ano∣ther, can do one for another, is to turn their Cases into Prayers.</P>
<P>I shall endeavour by the Lords Help, to demonstrate this Doctrine from these three Considerations</P>
<P N="1">1. That 'tis the best we can do, in that it is most highly Lawful, and always possible and practicable.</P>
<P N="2">2 In that it is as Needful as Lawful.</P>
<P N="3">3. In that it is the most powerful and suc∣cessful of any thing that we can do.</P>
<P>First of all, It is most <HI>Lawful</HI> and <HI>Possi∣ble.</HI> We have <HI>Precept, Promise</HI> and <HI>Example</HI> to convince us, that we may Lawfully as well as Possibly turn one anothers Cases into Pray∣ers. <HI>I</HI> exhort saith <HI>Paul,</HI> by the <HI>Spirit,</HI> 1 Tim 2.1. <HI>that Intercessions be made for all men,</HI> [He intends not the Damned, nor such as have Sinned against the Holy Ghost:] <HI>All men</HI> that Christ <HI>Offers</HI> His Blood and Benefits unto, <HI>we ought to offer</HI> our Prayers for them; see <HI>verse</HI> 4, &amp; 8. But especially, we may and must Pray, with and for the Brethren. <HI>Jam.</HI>

14, 16. <HI>Pray one for another.</HI> Although we are unworthy of liberty to make Petition for <HI>our selves,</HI> yet the Grace of <HI>God</HI> allows, yea injoyns us to put in requests for <HI>others</HI> also: <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Samuel,</HI> and <HI>Daniel,</HI> may speak a good word for <HI>all Israel:</HI> &amp; the Debt of Love to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> is to be discharged in the lawful and current Coin of Prayers.

<P>Thus we have proved, that this Way is highly warrantable; and very Possible and Practicable also; for <HI>Ab Esse ad Pos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> valet consequentia,</HI> That that hath <HI>actually</HI> been done, is <HI>possible</HI> to be done; <HI>Coelius</HI> [lib. 20▪ cap. 25.] Relates, that when <HI>Themistocles,</HI> upon a severe demand of Moneys from the Inhabitants of <HI>Andrios,</HI> told them that he brought two Gods with him unto them, <HI>viz.</HI> Persuasion and Force: They replied, that they had two great Gods among themselves, that hindred them, to wit, Poverty, and Impossibility.

Some such Instances are recorded in faithful History, and more are ready at hand to be produced.
