<P>TELL me not, that the Peoples being Taken with <HI>Publicola's</HI> Funeral Oration in Praise of the Dead <HI>Brutus,</HI> or the Decree of the <HI>Roman Senate,</HI> That it should be Lawful to make a Funeral Oration on such as deserved well of the Common wealth, made <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI> say, <HI>Hinc mortuos Laudandi mos fluxit, quem nos hodie Servamus.</HI> The Book of <HI>Lamentations,</HI> on the Death of <HI>Josiah,</HI> is of an Elder Date; The Roll of <HI>Lamentations,</HI> on the Death of <HI>Jonathan,</HI> is of yet an Elder; And cer∣tainly, to be Imitated among the faithful People of God. Tell me not, that some Eminent <HI>Non-conformists</HI> have therefore Scrupled, the Preaching of any <HI>Funeral Sermons</HI>: that in some <HI>Reformed Churches,</HI> the Practice of them is wholly omitted; that in the <HI>Primitive Churches,</HI> they were not practi∣ced until the <HI>Apostasy</HI> began; and that there have been <HI>Decrees of Councils</HI> against them. I readily grant, That the Custome of <HI>Praising the Dead,</HI> ha's been Scandalously Abused; but I cannot grant, That the Abuse is best Corrected, by taking away all <HI>Publick Meditations,</HI> on the <HI>Funerals</HI> of Those, in whose <HI>Deaths</HI> God from Heaven speaks Great Things unto the <HI>Living.</HI> We do but wisely Ful∣fil our Ministry, by <HI>Watching,</HI> to suit the <HI>Words</HI> of

The best sort of <HI>Reliques,</HI> are those which we have here preserved, &amp; proposed; &amp; it will be no <HI>Superstition,</HI> to hope, that a cure of Spiritual Ma∣ladies too generally prevailing, may be promoted, by Repairing unto them. And, I do not more question the Opinion of a very Learned man, concerning the <HI>Angels,</HI> whom we find mention'd in the Scriptures as doing very <HI>Humane</HI> Actions, <HI>Veros Homines fuisse, qui a Spiritu Messiae, et a Spiriti∣bus Angelicis agebantur; et movebantur ad ea Agenda, quae ipsi non intelligebant, phantasia Eorum obsessa, et a Cogitationibus consuetis abducta: Qui Homines, Ne∣gotio peracto ad quod fuerant a Deo adhibiti, discusso veterno, et cossante Ecstasi, ad Consueta munera reversi sunt, immemores eorum, quae Impulsore Spiritu Divino, aut Angelico, egerant</HI>: Than I do believe, That in our <HI>Actions,</HI> there is an Imitation of the Holy <HI>Angels</HI> to be endeavoured, by which a man, may become another <HI>Stephen.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>Acts VI.<HI>15.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Looking Stedfastly on him, they saw his Face, as it had been the Face of an ANGEL.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SInce the <HI>Oracles</HI> of Heaven, have (with a most significant Admonition!) allow'd a well served Church, to call its <HI>Pastor,</HI> by the Name of its <HI>Angel,</HI> we may now say, <HI>The Angel of the Church of</HI> Portsmouth, <HI>has newly taken wing!</HI> Yea, not the Least of the <HI>Angelical Chariots and Horsemen of</HI> New England, have de∣parted from us, in the <HI>Withdraw</HI> of One, after whom that Bereaved Church, is crying, <HI>My Fa∣ther, My Father!</HI></P>
<P>To praeserve the <HI>Idea,</HI> and <HI>Memory,</HI> of his <HI>Face,</HI> as far as the Infirmities of this <HI>Mortal State</HI> per∣mitted any Approaches to the <HI>Angelical</HI> Chara∣cter in it, is that whereto not only <HI>Nature</HI> does Invite us, but also <HI>Scripture</HI> does oblige us: 'Twill be but a compliance with that Edict of Heaven, <HI>Remember them who have spoken to you, the Word of God; whose Faith follow, considering the End of their Conversation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="000797_0005_0FAA525FADA63BC8"/>'Tis well known, That among the chief Works of the Most High, Created by the Son of God, at the First Beginning of Time, there were His <HI>Good</HI> ANGELS: <HI>Angels,</HI> which are Spiritual and Rational Substances, Created by the Lord, for His own Immediate Service and Honour. None Deny, None Dispute, the Existence of those <HI>Good Angels,</HI> but men that are under a more than ordinary Possession of <HI>Evil</HI> Ones.</P>
<P>Our Lord Jesus Christ, has given it, as a De∣scription of that <HI>Future State,</HI> wherein He will make us Happy for ever, Math. 22.30. <HI>They are as the Angels of God in Heaven.</HI> And if we Hope, to be <HI>Happy</HI> in that <HI>Future State,</HI> we must endeavour to Anticipate it, by being very <HI>Holy</HI> in our <HI>Present State.</HI> But the way for us, to be very <HI>Holy,</HI> is to Resemble, and Imitate, the <HI>An∣gels of God in Heaven,</HI> while we are on Earth, as far as we are able. Every <HI>Holy man</HI> does a <HI>Little</HI> of This; and <HI>how much</HI> of it, was done by that <HI>Holy man,</HI> who is now gone to Live, and Praise, and see CHRIST, among the <HI>Angels</HI> for ever, may be proposed with some Advantage unto the <HI>Exhortation,</HI> wherein I have a <HI>few Things to Preach unto the People.</HI></P>
<P>But my <HI>Exhortation</HI> must be introduced, with a Report of that <HI>Glory,</HI> which the Martyr <HI>Ste∣phen,</HI> while he was yet on Earth, attain'd unto.</P>
<P>There being occasion to choose <HI>Deacons</HI> in the Primitive Church, that so they who were to give themselves continually unto the <HI>Ministry of
<PB N="7" REF="000797_0006_0FAA52601B126F68"/>
the Word,</HI> might be Released, by the faithful Cares of those <HI>Deacons,</HI> from Secular Encumbran∣ces; <HI>One</HI> of them was the Blessed <HI>Stephen</HI>; who being the First that arriv'd unto the <HI>Crown of Martyrdome</HI> for our Lord Jesus Christ, in the New-Testament, had in the Name of <HI>Stephen,</HI> which signifies, <HI>A Crown,</HI> a notable Specification, of the <HI>Event</HI> and <HI>Reward,</HI> which will attend all our <HI>Sufferings</HI> for the Lord.</P>
<P>It was then an Age of many <HI>Miracles</HI> wrought by the <HI>Spirit</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ; and such a <HI>measure</HI> of that <HI>Spirit,</HI> possessed this Excellent man, that by the <HI>Impulse</HI> of that <HI>Spirit,</HI> He could, with all Assurance, perceive when the <HI>Spirit</HI> was going to work <HI>Miracles,</HI> and apply himself to ac∣company the <HI>Miracles</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> by some wonderful <HI>Actions</HI> of his own. This Illustrious Worker of <HI>Miracles,</HI> was Accused before the <HI>Council</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> for saying, That it was the Design of <HI>Jesus,</HI> to destroy the <HI>Temple,</HI> and the <HI>City,</HI> and alter the <HI>Rites,</HI> which <HI>Moses</HI> had, from God, commanded unto <HI>Israel.</HI> When he appear'd before the <HI>Council</HI> to answer this Accusation, 'tis here said, <HI>They saw his Face, as it had been the Face of an Angel.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the <HI>Face of an Angel,</HI> we have a Remarkable Account, in what we read about one of the <HI>Angels,</HI> in Mat. 28.3. His <HI>Countenance was like Lightning.</HI> And we read concerning a Great man, who had got the <HI>Face of an Angel,</HI> by being much with the <HI>Angels,</HI> in Exod 34.10. <HI>Behold,
<PB N="8" REF="000797_0007_0FAA5260E9DBF140"/>
the skin of his Face shone.</HI> If we carry the passage now before us, unto the Highest sense, which it would lay claim unto, we are to suppose, That such a <HI>Splendor</HI> was discernible upon the <HI>Face</HI> of <HI>Stephen</HI>: And surely, if they who discerned it, had not had the <HI>Heart of a Devil</HI> in them, they durst not have gone on, to Abuse a <HI>man,</HI> that Appeared before them, with the <HI>Face of an Angel.</HI> Alas, the more of an <HI>Angel</HI> there is in any <HI>man,</HI> the more <HI>Stones</HI> will the <HI>Devil</HI> procure to be thrown at such a <HI>Man!</HI> But, behold, the <HI>Agreeableness</HI> of the matter; <HI>Stephen</HI> was persecuted for vilifying of <HI>Moses</HI>; and, behold, at this very Time, he is vindicated with a <HI>Shine</HI> upon his <HI>Face,</HI> like that once upon the <HI>Face</HI> of <HI>Moses.</HI> The Things here spoken by <HI>Stephen,</HI> were those very Things, which the <HI>Angel Gabriel,</HI> had formerly spoken unto the <HI>Prophet Daniel</HI>; and behold, the Aspect of an <HI>Angel</HI> adorns him, in his Discourse.</P>
<P>We may from hence, take Leave to Observe,
That a <HI>Saint on Earth,</HI> may arrive to those Attain∣ments, that shall make him Look like an <HI>Angel of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>There are <HI>Angelical Excellencies,</HI> a Degree whereof, poor <HI>man,</HI> sorry <HI>man,</HI> sinful <HI>man,</HI> even while such, may very much attain unto.</P>
<P>But now, this CASE calls for our Attention;
What are those Excellencies, that would make a Saint, Look like an <HI>ANGEL</HI>?</P>
<P>And the General Answer hereunto is, The <HI>Excellencies of Holiness</HI>▪ For,</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="000797_0008_0FAA5261689052B8"/>First, The <HI>Angels</HI> of God, have many <HI>Excel∣lencies,</HI> the Imitation whereof cannot by men in this Life, be Reasonably proposed. The <HI>Angeli∣cal Majesty,</HI> as a <HI>Mortal Eye</HI> would not be able steadily to <HI>Behold</HI> it, much less, in this <HI>Mortal State,</HI> may we <HI>Affect</HI> it. A man may not wish to <HI>Shine</HI> like <HI>Stephen,</HI> in this World, and have a <HI>Face,</HI> that may dazzle the Spectators. Or, what would it avail, if a man could make a Glare on his <HI>Face,</HI> by smearing it with some of the <HI>Noctilu∣ca's</HI> invented by the <HI>Modern Chymistry</HI>? A <HI>Devil</HI> has before now, pretended unto such a <HI>Face.</HI> 'Tis not the <HI>Face,</HI> but the <HI>Grace,</HI> of an <HI>Angel,</HI> which is here to be Aspired after. It were a Foolish, and a Faulty Thing, for any man, to be ambitious, of wearing in this World, such a Figure, as that in Dan. 10.6. <HI>His Body like the Beryl, and his Face as the Appearance of Lightning, and his Eyes as Lamps of Fire. Immortality</HI> it self, is one of the <HI>Angelical Excellencies.</HI> But, while we are among <HI>Mortals</HI> here, we must submit unto the Laws of <HI>Mortality,</HI> and be willing to <HI>Dy,</HI> When, and How, the So∣veraign God shall order it. There are also, those Flights of <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and those Heights of <HI>Power</HI> among the <HI>Angelical Excellencies</HI>; wherein, 'tis not for us, to Dream of being <HI>Like</HI> them, until we are become, <HI>The Children of the Resurrection</HI> It was the Ruine of our <HI>First Parents,</HI> to imagine, in Gen. 3.5. They <HI>might be as Elohim!</HI> No, this cannot be, until our Lord Jesus Christ, has by a <HI>New Birth</HI> brought us into that <HI>World to come,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="000797_0009_0FAA52626BDED5C0"/>
where, the <HI>Wise Converters of many to Righteousness,</HI> will be those, who shall <HI>Shine as the Brightness of the Firmament, and as the Stars for ever and ever!</HI> Our Lord Jesus Christ, will make <HI>us</HI> the <HI>Angels</HI> of the <HI>New World.</HI> Indeed the <HI>Angels</HI> now turn and move all the <HI>Wheels</HI> of the <HI>Kingdoms</HI> of <HI>this World,</HI> but <HI>we</HI> are they that shall <HI>Receive the Kingdom that cannot be moved.</HI></P>
<P>But, Secondly, The <HI>Excellencies of Holiness,</HI> [For, the <HI>Saints,</HI> are the <HI>Excellent!</HI>] These are They, wherein the Imitation of the <HI>Angels</HI> by <HI>men,</HI> may be very far proceeded in. The <HI>Angels</HI> of God, are styled, in Mat. 25.31. <HI>The Holy Angels</HI>; and in Dan. 4.17. <HI>The Holy Ones.</HI> 'Tis not as they are <HI>Mighty Angels,</HI> but as they are <HI>Holy Angels,</HI> that we must propound our coming to Look like unto them. These <HI>Holy Angels,</HI> never did, and never will Sin against their God; but are conti∣nually Serving of Him; <HI>They Serve Him Day and Night in His Temple!</HI> And it may be, the <HI>Bright Garments,</HI> wherein these <HI>Angels of Light,</HI> have ap∣peared, may be an Emblem of their <HI>Holiness</HI> and their <HI>Purity.</HI> Now it hath been the <HI>Will of God in our Lord Jesus Christ concerning us,</HI> that there should be set before us, the Greatest Exemples of <HI>Holiness</HI> for our Imitation. And hence, as we have the Greater <HI>Exemple</HI> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST Himself given unto us, to Direct and Excite and Promote our <HI>Holiness,</HI> with a Charge, <HI>To be Holy, as He that hath called us is Holy</HI>; So, we have also the <HI>Exemple</HI> of the <HI>Holy Angels</HI> given unto us, That
<PB N="11" REF="000797_0010_0FAA526327703CB8"/>
we may strive as far as may be, to be Like unto them in their <HI>Holiness.</HI> Hence when the Psamist of old saw the <HI>Angels</HI> praising of God, he cryed out, <HI>O my Soul, do Thou so too</HI>! Yea, some Inter∣preters Judge, That when the <HI>Face</HI> of <HI>Stephen</HI> Look'd like an <HI>Angel,</HI> it was no more than what you and I may <HI>thro' Christ who strengthens us,</HI> reach unto. <HI>q d.</HI> The <HI>Consolations</HI> of the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> of God, so filled him, that he discovered not the least <HI>Consternations</HI> in his <HI>Face</HI>: His <HI>Face</HI> was as Joyful, and Serene, as if he had stood free from all the <HI>Sorrows</HI> of this World, among the <HI>Angels</HI> of God.</P>
<P>I remember the Apostle Enjoins the <HI>Woman</HI> in the Church to have a covering on her Head, in Token of Subjection to her <HI>Husband; Because of the Angels.</HI> [2 Cor. 11.10.] Why, if you turn to the Beginning of the sixth Chapter of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> you'l find the <HI>Angels</HI> before their Superiour, the Lord Jesus Christ, in the <HI>Temple</HI> assuming a <HI>Cover∣ing,</HI> out of the Reverence which they pay unto Him. Hence then, says the Apostle, it becomes <HI>Women</HI> to take <HI>Example</HI> by the <HI>Angels</HI>; let them consider, how the <HI>Angels</HI> behave themselves in the Presence of the <HI>Son</HI> of God, who is the Grand Representative of the <HI>Image</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of God; and let them in their <HI>Habit</HI> show some Analogy to the <HI>Habit</HI> of the <HI>Angels</HI>: betokening their Sub∣jection to the <HI>man,</HI> who is under the Lord Jesus Christ, the <HI>Image</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of God, while <HI>They</HI> the <HI>Women,</HI> are so of the <HI>man.</HI> But I only touch
<PB N="12" REF="000797_0011_0FAA5263B21040F0"/>
on this gloss, by the by. What I insist on, is, That the <HI>Angelical Example</HI> is to be imitated.</P>
<P>Indeed, we shall, as long as we Live in this World, come far short of the <HI>Original,</HI> when we go to Write after the <HI>Angelical Example.</HI> In this <HI>Present Evil World,</HI> we cannot approach near to the <HI>Holiness</HI> of the <HI>Good Angels</HI>: Much of Sin, and Fault, &amp; Folly, will unavoidably cleave unto us: That <HI>Leprosy</HI> will never wholly out of the <HI>Walls,</HI> until the <HI>Clay-house</HI> be utterly demolished: There will be as much Distance between the <HI>Blessed Spi∣rits</HI> and <HI>Us,</HI> as between <HI>Giants</HI> and <HI>Children,</HI> as be∣tween <HI>Stars</HI> and <HI>Gloworms,</HI> as between the <HI>Cedars</HI> of <HI>Lebanon,</HI> and the <HI>Hysop</HI> that <HI>Grows out of the Wall</HI>; Thus it will be, until we come at length to dwell [And, <HI>Oh! Why do we no more Long for it!</HI>] with the <HI>Innumerable Company of Angels,</HI> in another World.</P>
<P>However, to Attempt the Imitation, is the rea∣dy way to be <HI>Excellent.</HI> Particularly in the En∣suing Instances.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> If a man could have his <HI>Eye</HI> upon the <HI>Face of God</HI> continually, would not that procure the <HI>Face of an Angel</HI> for him? It would make a man Look like an <HI>Angel,</HI> if he were Looking unto God, in the Lord Jesus Christ continually. Of the <HI>Angels</HI> there is that Account given, in Mat. 18.10. <HI>In the Heavens, they do always behold the Face of my Father which is in the Heavens.</HI> The <HI>Angels</HI> do converse with GOD continually. And, why may not we press after a converse with GOD, a
<PB N="13" REF="000797_0012_0FAA52648B5EFED8"/>
little Emulating the <HI>Angelical</HI>? To be <HI>Heavenly-minded,</HI> by having the <HI>God of Heaven</HI> almost al∣ways in our minds, and by being <HI>in the Fear of God all the Day Long; This</HI> were to be as the <HI>An∣gels</HI> are! Oh! That we were thus, <HI>Filled with all the Fulness of God.</HI></P>
<P>First, We may have a continual <HI>Apprehension</HI> of GOD in our minds. In every <HI>Place,</HI> we may Apprehend GOD Wherever we are, we may Subscribe to that Article of the Ancient Faith, in Psal. 139.7. Lord, <HI>Whither shall I flee from thy Presence</HI>? What if we should never be from un∣der the Awe of such a Thought as that, <HI>The Om∣nipresent God observes all my wayes!</HI> And we may Apprehend GOD, in every <HI>Thing.</HI> We need not stay at any <HI>Second Causes</HI>; but we may with a <HI>Spiritualized Soul,</HI> Soar up to some Notice of <HI>God</HI> in all. Upon all the Works of <HI>Creation</HI> we may say, <HI>The Finger of God is here!</HI> And we may make the Positions of the <HI>Pauline</HI> Philosophy, in Acts 17.24, 28. <HI>God made the World, and all Things therein; In Him we Live and Move and have our Being.</HI> Upon all the Works of <HI>Providence,</HI> we may say, <HI>This comes from that God, whose Kingdome Ruleth over all.</HI> And we may make the Conclu∣sions once taught by our Lord, no doubt alluding to the <HI>Two Birds,</HI> whereof one was to be <HI>killed,</HI> the other to be <HI>Let Loose into the Open Field,</HI> at the cleansing of the <HI>Leper,</HI> in Mat. 10.29. <HI>Two Spar∣rows, one of them shall not fall on the Ground without our Father.</HI> To be Led unto some Notice of
<PB N="14" REF="000797_0013_0FAA526536837D78"/>
GOD continually, This, O This, it is <HI>Angelical.</HI> 'Tis <HI>Godliness.</HI> What is <HI>Holiness,</HI> but <HI>Godliness</HI>? This were a little of the <HI>Angelical Holiness.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Our continual <HI>Apprehension</HI> of GOD, may bring a continual <HI>Dedication</HI> to GOD, upon all that we <HI>Have,</HI> and all that we <HI>Do.</HI> If we <HI>Glance</HI> at <HI>Inferiour Ends,</HI> yet we may not <HI>Stop</HI> there: All our <HI>Ends</HI> are to be Swallowed up in GOD. We should not, with any patience consent unto it, that any but GOD, should have our <HI>Strength,</HI> our <HI>Time,</HI> our <HI>All.</HI> Whatever <HI>Possessions</HI> are bestow'd upon us, we may put them under that Considera∣tion, which the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>David</HI> had, in Psal. 30. <HI>Tit. Dedicated Things.</HI> All our <HI>Possessions,</HI> all the Powers of our <HI>Spirits,</HI> all the Members of our <HI>Bodies,</HI> our <HI>Estates,</HI> our <HI>Credit,</HI> our Desireable <HI>Friends</HI>; we may contrive with our selves <HI>What Acknowledg∣ments may GOD have out of these Things!</HI> And Improve them no farther, than as <HI>Instruments,</HI> whereby GOD may be <HI>Acknowledged.</HI> Yea, and our daily <HI>Actions</HI>; may we not be driving a <HI>Trade</HI> for GOD in all? As 'tis said, in 1 Cor. 10.31. <HI>Whatever ye do, do all to the Glory of God:</HI> So, our <HI>Eating,</HI> our <HI>Drinking,</HI> our <HI>Sleeping,</HI> what is it for? We may distinctly say, <HI>I do This, that I may be supported in the Service of God.</HI> Thus, our <HI>La∣bours,</HI> our <HI>Travels,</HI> our <HI>Visits,</HI> and our Exercises of <HI>Religion,</HI> we may thus Ennoble them, <HI>I do This, I will do it carefully and cheerfully, because God hath Commanded my doing of it.</HI> A <HI>Dedication</HI> to GOD, is the proper meaning of <HI>Holiness:</HI> And very <HI>An∣gelical</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="000797_0014_0FAA5265F58D7900"/>
would be our <HI>Holiness,</HI> if we could be fre∣quent, and constant in such Acts of <HI>Dedication.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly; Our continual <HI>Apprehension</HI> of GOD, may produce our continual <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in GOD, under all His <HI>Dispensations.</HI> Whatever <HI>Enjoyments</HI> are by God conferred upon us, where lies the <HI>Re∣lish,</HI> where the <HI>Sweetness</HI> of them? Truly, we may come to Relish our <HI>Enjoyments,</HI> only <HI>so far</HI> as we have something of GOD in them. It was requi∣red in Psal. 37 4. <HI>Delight thy self in the Lord.</HI> Yea, And what if we should have no <HI>Delight,</HI> but the <HI>Lord?</HI> Let us ponder with our selves, over our <HI>Enjoyments; In these Enjoyments I See God, and by these Enjoyments I Serve God</HI>!

the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of that GOD, <HI>whose Judgments are Right</HI>; the <HI>Goodness</HI> of that GOD, who <HI>Punishes us less than our Iniquities do deserve.</HI> Let us behave our selves, as having to Do with none but GOD, in our <HI>Afflictions:</HI> And let our <HI>Afflictions</HI> make us more conformable unto GOD; which Conformi∣ty being Effected, Let us then say, <HI>'Tis Good for me that I have been Afflicted.</HI> Sirs, what were this, but a pitch of <HI>Holiness,</HI> almost <HI>Angelical</HI>!

When we have Solemnly Consecrated our selves unto this Work, Then, whatever <HI>Commands</HI> our Lord JESUS CHRIST layes upon us, Let us Readily, Joyfully, Universally yield <HI>Obedience</HI> thereunto.

are like the <HI>Angels,</HI> that wait upon our Lord Je∣sus Christ. The <HI>Angels</HI> are alwayes Employ'd in some Service, for our Lord Jesus Christ, and for those that belong unto Him. 'Tis said, in Heb. 1.14. <HI>Are they not all Ministring Spirits?</HI> Oh! Let it, in like sort, be our Ambition, to <HI>Minister</HI> some way or other, for the <HI>Good</HI> of them, that are to be the <HI>Heirs of Salvation</HI>; and let us be much and oft, in studying with our selves, <HI>What Good may I do, with those Talents, where with my Lord Jesus Christ ha's betrusted me?</HI> How many <HI>Good Offices,</HI> does the <HI>Bible</HI> Report, as done by the <HI>Angels</HI> of God, for the <HI>People</HI> of God? And, how many such <HI>Good Offices</HI> are still done, for the <HI>People</HI> of God, by the <HI>Angels</HI> of God, which <HI>Encamp as an Host about them that Fear Him</HI>? Christians, If we are advised of any <HI>Opportunity</HI> to <HI>Do Good,</HI> Let us be as Ready to do it, as the <HI>Angel</HI> that came down to the <HI>Pool</HI> of <HI>Bethesda,</HI> was to help the Misera∣bles assembled there. Yea, though they should be never so Poor, never so Small, never so <HI>Mean People,</HI> that we may <HI>Do Good</HI> unto, Let us be ready to Do it, with all our Hearts. The First Appari∣tion of an <HI>Angel,</HI> that we Read in the Scripture, was to Relieve a <HI>Poor Maid,</HI> in Trouble of Spirit. The Martyr <HI>Bradford,</HI> That man had the <HI>Face</HI> of an <HI>Angel,</HI> concerning whom it was Noted, <HI>He was alwayes, either with Purse, or Tongue, or Pen, do∣ing of Good.</HI> Whatever <HI>Company</HI> we fall into, tis easy for us, ordinarily to Think, <HI>What Good may I do in this Company before I Leave it</HI>? That man

<HI>Speaks with the Tongue of Angels,</HI> who will never dismiss his <HI>Company,</HI> without some Conscientious Essay, to <HI>Speak</HI> what shall be <HI>Profitable</HI> unto them.

<P N="4"><HI>IV.

Notably thus, when men do often set apart <HI>whole Dayes,</HI> for their <HI>Prayers,</HI> and their <HI>Praises,</HI> and are <HI>With God in the Mount,</HI> for <HI>whole Dayes</HI> together. Great Things did the <HI>Angels</HI> do for <HI>Moses,</HI> Great Things for <HI>Elias,</HI> who often spent <HI>whole Dayes</HI> a∣lone with the Lord; And what said an <HI>Angel</HI> un∣to <HI>Daniel,</HI> when he had been spending <HI>whole Days</HI> at such a rate, <HI>Thou art a man of Desires, and an Angel thinks not much to fly down from Heaven unto thy Conversation</HI>! Such <HI>Dayes,</HI> do leave an <HI>Angeli∣cal Savour</HI> upon the <HI>Souls</HI> of men; they Leave our <HI>Souls,</HI> for many Dayes afterward, under such a Gracious, and Generous, and Serious, &amp; Watch∣ful, and Useful <HI>Biass,</HI> as has the <HI>Face</HI> of an <HI>Angel</HI> thereupon. And therefore, the <HI>Lords Dayes;</HI> Let us keep <HI>them</HI> with a peculiar Sollicitude, a singular Elevation, of <HI>Sanctity.</HI> It was the privi∣ledge of <HI>John,</HI> in Rev. 1.10. To be <HI>in the Spirit on the Lords Day.</HI> Syrs, If we are so, we shall be <HI>with the Angels on the Lords Day</HI>; And if <HI>with</HI> them, then <HI>like</HI> them.

Angels</HI> have strang∣ly visited and comforted some on the <HI>Rack</HI>; but never such as complain'd, that a strict <HI>Lords Day</HI> put 'em on a <HI>Rack.</HI> During the whole Day, Let our <HI>Thoughts</HI> be full of <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>Hea∣ven</HI>; During the whole Day, Let our <HI>words</HI> be

<HI>Few,</HI> and <HI>Fitt,</HI> and <HI>Savoury,</HI> and such as may <HI>Mi∣nister Grace unto the Hearers</HI>; During the whole Day, Let our <HI>Earthly Defilements</HI> be Banished from us; Let our Hearts, be every Hour Sallying forth with Numberless <HI>Ejaculations</HI> to the Lord. Such <HI>Lords Dayes,</HI> will <HI>Ripen</HI> men into <HI>Angels</HI> at the Last! But on the <HI>Lords-Day,</HI> there sometimes does Recur, a most special and signal opportunity to <HI>Draw near unto God</HI>; namely, <HI>The Lords Supper;</HI> an Ordinance of the <HI>Nearest Fellowship</HI> with Heaven; an Ordinance, wherein a CHRIST Suffering for us, is, by the Symbols of <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> so tendred unto the Faithful, that in their Obeying His Appointment thereof, they do with Ineffable Advantage partake of Him. Well then, Let our <HI>Preparations</HI> for this Great Ordinance, be with as much of Solemnity, as if we were to <HI>Dy</HI> our selves, at the Time, when we do <HI>Annun∣ciate</HI> here the <HI>Death of our Lord.</HI> Let us <HI>Examine</HI> our selves, &amp; <HI>Supplicate</HI> our God, before we come to the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord, as if we were to <HI>Dy</HI> when we come. And at this <HI>Holy Table,</HI> where <HI>Man Eats Angels Food,</HI> Let us <HI>Fix</HI> our <HI>Meditations</HI> on our Lord JESUS CHRIST, with all possible <HI>Attention,</HI> with all suitable <HI>Affection.</HI> Thus, <HI>Behol∣ding, as in a Glass, the Glory of the Lord, we shall be Changed into the same Image, from Glory to Glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> Now, 'tis that <HI>Glory</HI> that makes an <HI>Angel!</HI></P>

unto the <HI>man,</HI> who hath an <HI>Heart</HI> so affected. Unto the <HI>Angels,</HI> there is nothing so precious, &amp; nothing so glorious, as the Lord JESUS CHRIST; yea, 'tis our CHRIST, that makes the best part of their <HI>Heaven</HI> for them.

Truly, <HI>Seen</HI> with Wonders, and <HI>Seen</HI> with Raptures, and <HI>Seen</HI> with Endless <HI>Hallelujahs.</HI> Would we be Like the <HI>Angels</HI>? Then Let our Lord JESUS CHRIST be <HI>Seen</HI> by us, as the <HI>Best Thing</HI> in Heaven and Earth, and as infinitely <HI>Better</HI> than the very <HI>An∣gels</HI> themselves. At the <HI>Incarnation</HI> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. What were the Songs of <HI>An∣gels?</HI> in Luk. 2.14. <HI>There was a multitude of the Heavenly Host, praising of God, and saying, Glory to God in the Highest</HI>! Would we be like the <HI>Angels</HI>? Let us then join in a Consort with those <HI>Morning Stars,</HI> and <HI>Sons of God.</HI> It was with <HI>Joy Unspeak∣able and full of Glory,</HI> that the <HI>Angels</HI> attended up∣on our Lord JESUS CHRIST, f<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st throughout His <HI>Humiliation,</HI> and then, unto His <HI>Exaltation</HI> Let the whole of <HI>That,</HI> be the most Ravishing Subject of our <HI>Contemplation</HI>; Let us Love to see our Lord JESUS CHRIST, first <HI>Suffering,</HI> and then <HI>Entring into His Glory.</HI> And let our Acclamations, be like those of the <HI>Angels,</HI> upon those marvellous Dis∣pensations of the Grace of God!

<HI>Holy, Holy, Holy Lord of Hosts, all Heaven, is full of thy Glory!</HI> And shall not <HI>we</HI> so Look on that our <HI>Lord of Glory</HI>? When the <HI>Angels</HI> do <HI>Speak</HI> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, they make a most Reve∣rent mention of His <HI>Holy and Reverend Name,</HI> and say, <HI>Oh! there is none among the Sons of the Mighty, that may be compared unto this Lord.</HI> And shall not <HI>we</HI> so speak of that Great <HI>King,</HI> with a <HI>Tongue, like the Pen of a Ready Writer?</HI> Something of <HI>Christ,</HI> the <HI>Angels</HI> must have; they would think them∣selves to be <HI>Starved,</HI> if they had not this <HI>Manna</HI> to Feed upon!

What shall I say? The <HI>Mystery of CHRIST,</HI> is the most grateful Contemplation of the <HI>Angels:</HI> Those <HI>Cherubims</HI> about the <HI>Ark of God,</HI> we are told, in 1 Pet. 1 12. <HI>They Desire to Look into these Things.</HI> I say then, <HI>Go and do Likewise.</HI></P>

as bad as <HI>Balaam</HI> himself, yet the bare suspicion of having the Eye of some <HI>Angel</HI> upon him, would be enough to stop him from Rushing on to <HI>Sin. Why shouldest thou Sin,</HI> says the Wise man, in Eccl. 5.6. <HI>Before the Angel?</HI> If we were <HI>Wise,</HI> we should often think, <HI>I am now before some Angel!</HI> and that Thought would make us <HI>Wise.</HI> The Aged Apo∣stle said unto a younger Minister, <HI>I charge thee be∣fore the Elect Angels</HI>: from whence 'tis infallibly sure, That the <HI>Elect Angels</HI> take notice, how we Acquit our selves, each one in his <HI>Charge.</HI> Said the Psalmist, in Psal. 138.1. <HI>Before the Gods I will Sing praise unto thee:</HI> The LXX translate it, <HI>I will sing praise unto thee, before the Angels.</HI> Christi∣ans, The <HI>Angels</HI> take Notice of us, in all our <HI>Em∣ployments,</HI> yea, in our Closest <HI>Retirements.</HI> We give no <HI>Praises</HI> to God, we Perform no <HI>Duties,</HI> we En∣dure no <HI>Troubles,</HI> we Resist no <HI>Temptations,</HI> but the <HI>Angels</HI> of God, are the <HI>Witnesses</HI> of what we do; we are a <HI>Spectacle to Angels</HI> in all of our <HI>Encounters.</HI> Well, Now Let our <HI>Deportment,</HI> be mightily under the Influence of this Consideration; <HI>The Angels take Notice; What Report will the Angels of God, give of my Behaviours!</HI> It has been propounded as a <HI>Rule of Prudence,</HI> for a man, wherever he comes, to Imagine, that there is present some Eminent, Wise, and Good man, to see and hear all that passes. <HI>Man,</HI> There is an <HI>Angel</HI> to see and hear all that passes, wherever thou comest; This is no <HI>meer Imagination.</HI> Could we, like the Servant of the Prophet, in the Mount, see the unseen Regi∣ment

of the World, by the Subordinate Govern∣ment of <HI>Angels,</HI> what an <HI>Awe,</HI> what an <HI>Awe,</HI> what an <HI>Awe</HI> would it strike us with! The <HI>Angels</HI> of the Lord see, how men are Disposed, and Em∣ployed, for the Service of Their Lord, and gladly contribute their unknown Assistences unto that Service. But it cannot be any other than a Grief unto those <HI>Angels,</HI> to see <HI>Enormities,</HI> in those, for whose welfare they are concerned. If they have <HI>Joy</HI> over a <HI>Paenitent</HI>▪ they must needs have some sort of <HI>Grief</HI> over a <HI>Transgressor.</HI> Yea, in all pro∣bability, the miscarriages of such offenders, work in them a sort of <HI>Distast,</HI> which inclines them, on many accounts, to withdraw from the Offenders, until they have <HI>Washed</HI> themselves over again, <HI>In the Fountain set open for Sin &amp; for Uncleanness.</HI> Now, Let this consideration accompany us, in all our Walk; and let the <HI>Eye</HI> of an <HI>Angel</HI> be more to us, than the <HI>Eye</HI> of a <HI>Cato,</HI> could be to any <HI>Roman.</HI> The <HI>Face of Angels</HI> will at last be gain'd, by such a Consideration!</P>

Of the <HI>Devils,</HI> we find in Jude 6. <HI>They kept not their First Estate:</HI> They once joined, it seems, in Praising of God, with the <HI>Angels</HI> of the Blessed Regions; but they <HI>Left</HI> it all. You that have <HI>Left</HI> the <HI>Societies,</HI> and the <HI>Exercises,</HI> of Christianity, wherein you were <HI>at First</HI> Engaged; Behold, who your <HI>Leader</HI> is! The first and great <HI>Apostate,</HI> the <HI>Devil,</HI> is your <HI>Leader,</HI> in this <HI>Desertion</HI>; And, alas, whither will he <HI>Lead</HI> you? There is much of the <HI>Devil</HI> also, in <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> under Good Professions. When there was a Secret, Rotten <HI>Hypocrite,</HI> among the Disciples of our Lord. Our Lord said, in Joh. 6.70. <HI>He is a Devil</HI>: Indeed, the <HI>Devil</HI> is never so much a <HI>Devil,</HI> as when <HI>Transformed</HI> into <HI>an Angel of Light.</HI> When strict pretenders, and pleaders, and it may be, Preachers of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> shall yet <HI>Cloak some

Hidden Practices of Dishonesty</HI> under their fair pre∣tences, Behold, Men playing the <HI>Devil</HI> horribly. What shall I say more? The <HI>Devil</HI> is an <HI>Unclean</HI> Spirit, a <HI>Lying</HI> Spirit, a <HI>Proud</HI> Spirit, a Spirit full of <HI>Envy.</HI> Oh! Take heed lest you be of such a <HI>Spirit,</HI> and so, Lest you Perish <HI>with the Devil and his Angels,</HI> throughout Eternal Ages.</P>
<P>Thus, the <HI>Rules</HI> of becoming <HI>Angelical,</HI> have been set before us.</P>
<P>But if we do now Humbly Reflect upon our selves, for our not Living up to these <HI>Rules</HI>; we cannot easily be more Humble in such Reflections, than was that MAN OF GOD, the Reverend, JOSHUA MOODEY, who from his <HI>Essayes</HI> to obtain the <HI>Face of Angels,</HI> is now gone unto the <HI>Place of Angels.</HI></P>
<P>All the Churches of <HI>NEW-ENGLAND,</HI> Consi∣dered him, as a Person, whom an Eminency both in <HI>Sense,</HI> and in <HI>Grace,</HI> had made Considerable.

The Church of <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> (a part of the Country that very much ow'd its <HI>Life</HI> unto him!) Cryes out, of, <HI>A Dead∣ly Wound,</HI> in his <HI>Death</HI>; and is ready to cry out, <HI>Our Breach is Great like the Sea; who can heal it?</HI> His <HI>Labours</HI> in the Gospel, were frequent and fervent; whereof the <HI>Press</HI> hath given some <HI>Last∣ing,</HI> as the <HI>Pulpit</HI> gave many <HI>Lively</HI> Testimonies: and unto his Cares to Edify his Flock by <HI>Sermons,</HI> he added more than Ordinary Cares to do it by

<HI>Visits</HI>: No man Perhaps being a kinder <HI>Visitant.</HI> He was not only Ready to <HI>Do Good,</HI> but also to <HI>Suffer</HI> for doing it; and as he was Exemplarily Zealous for a <HI>Scriptural Purity</HI> in the Worship of the Lord Jesus Christ, so, he cheerfully Submitted unto an <HI>Imprisonment,</HI> for that <HI>Cause of God, and of this Country</HI>▪ wherein, like <HI>Stephen,</HI> he had the Honour to be the <HI>First,</HI> that Suffered in that way for that <HI>Cause,</HI> in these parts of the World. Briefly, For <HI>Piety,</HI> for <HI>Charity,</HI> and for <HI>Faithfulness</HI> to the main Interests of our Churches; all that knew him, and know the worth of these things, wish that among the <HI>Survivers,</HI> he may have many <HI>Followers.</HI></P>
<P>He was of a very Robust and Hardy Constitu∣tion, and a notable Exception to the General Re∣mark, <HI>Raro solent Ingenia insigniter faelicia, Robusta sort<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri Corpora</HI>; and, it may be, too <HI>Prodigal</HI> of his <HI>Athletick Strength,</HI> in doing the Service, whereto a Good Master called him. Nevertheless, when a <HI>Complication</HI> of Distempers, was diverse Months before his Dissolution, brought thereby upon him, he Exceedingly Lamented, <HI>His Neglect,</HI> (as he ac∣counted it) <HI>of his past Opportunities to be Serviceable.</HI> At Length, Coming to <HI>Boston,</HI> for Advice about the Recovery of his Lost Health, his Distempers here so grew upon him, as to Threaten a Quick <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eriod unto his Pilgrimage. His Distressed Church at <HI>Portsmouth</HI> now Importunately made their <HI>Prayer</HI> with <HI>Fasting</HI> before the <HI>Great Shepherd of the Sheep,</HI> that they might not be deprived of

so Rich a Blessing; And he was himself Excee∣dingly desirous to have Returned unto <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> that he might establish his Flock yet further a∣gainst all Temptations to forsake <HI>the Right wayes of the Lord.</HI> But Heaven determines otherwise.</P>
<P>When the Last Summons of <HI>Death</HI> came to be Served upon him, he had neither <HI>Time,</HI> nor <HI>Strength,</HI> to speak very much; and they that have spoken much while they <HI>Live,</HI> sometimes must not speak very much at their <HI>Death.</HI> His Discourses, were generally full of <HI>Self Condemna∣tion</HI>; and indeed, that man knows not how to <HI>Dy,</HI> who thinks to Dy otherwise, than <HI>Condemning of himself,</HI> Exceedingly. The most of what he said, was, I suppose, unto a Minister, who Visited him, the Day before his Expiration. Unto that Minister, he Signifyed, That he <HI>was Rejoycing in the Hope of the Glory of God</HI>; That he <HI>was Longing to Go to the Precious Christ, whom he had Chose and Serv'd</HI>; That <HI>the Spirit of Christ, had Comfortably taken away from him the Fear of DEATH.</HI> When that Minister urged him, to Leave with him, any special Desire, that he should Judge pro∣per to be mentioned, He said, <HI>The Life of the Churches! The Life of the Churches! and the Dying Power of Godliness in them; I beseech you to Look af∣ter that</HI>! The Minister at last said, <HI>The Lord Jess Christ, is now, Sir, going to do for you, as once</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Joshua <HI>[your Names-sake!] He is just going to take from you, your old, sorry, ragged Garments, Those of

your Flesh; and clothe you with change of Raiment with the Garments of Heavenly Glory, and give you a place among His Angels:</HI> Whereto he Replied, with some Transport, <HI>I Believe it! I Believe it</HI>! After this, he said little, but Lay in an uneasy Drowsiness, until the Afternoon of the Day following; which was, <HI>The Lords Day</HI>; and then, even on the Day, whereon he had so often been <HI>in the Spirit,</HI> he went unto the Blessed <HI>World of Spirits</HI>; on the Day, which he had so often Sanctifyed in a <HI>Sa∣cred Rest,</HI> he went into his <HI>Eternal Rest.</HI> A <HI>Fatal Day</HI> was this Day unto our Land! It is an Omen of a sad Fate unto a Land, when the <HI>Angels</HI> do say, <HI>Migremus hinc</HI>; Let us be gone! How far he had the <HI>Face of an Angel,</HI> while he Sojourned here, no doubt <HI>Envy</HI> may <HI>Cavil</HI>; and I have sometimes, with wonder seen it, in the poor <HI>E∣nergumens</HI> among us, that when the <HI>Minister,</HI> who might be the most likely to do them Good, came unto them, the Fiends that possessed them, would make the Ministers <HI>Face</HI> Look so Dirty and Swarthy, that they must by no means acknow∣ledge him. This I may venture to say, with∣out Flattery: It is Long ago, that in another Sense than <HI>Aquinas,</HI> we call'd him, <HI>An Angeli∣cal Doctor</HI>; And he has now attained, <HI>The Face of an Angel,</HI> without the least <HI>Wrinkle</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.
