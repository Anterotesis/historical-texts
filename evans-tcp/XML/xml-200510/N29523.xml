for our Delinquencies. Who is there to <HI>Number</HI> the Blowes? Yea, <HI>The Anger of God, is not for all this Turned away, but His Hand stretched out still!</HI> It is but proper, while we are thus under our Pu∣nishment, for us, to have a <HI>Text</HI> of the Sa∣cred Oracles, agreeable unto our present State, Read unto us. Behold, an <HI>Agreea∣ble Text,</HI> now singled out, for our Enter∣tainment; &amp; I do the rather single it out because the next Week, a General HU∣MILIATION is to be attended among us; for which, I cannot easily do a more <HI>Useful</HI> Thing, than to give you a <HI>Praepa∣rative</HI>; while I am speaking unto th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christians of many Churches, here come together, in One Great Assembly.</P>
<P>In our Context, we find the People of God, beginning to <HI>Forsake the Law of the Lord</HI>: They many wayes <HI>Tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sgressed</HI> a∣gainst Him. Sad <HI>Calamity</HI> overtook them, for this their <HI>Iniquity,</HI> and <HI>Apostasy</HI>; But God bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed the Preaching of His Prophet <HI>Shemaj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h</HI> unto them, under this <HI>Calamity</HI> to produce a Notable <HI>Humiliaiion</HI> in them.

from <HI>Destruction,</HI> was, by that Pro∣phet of the Lord, when they <HI>Humbled</HI> themselves, brought from the Lord unto them.</P>
<P>The Truth which Lies plainly before us, is, <HI>That when a Sinful People Humble themselves before the Almighty God, it is an Hopeful and an Happy Symptom, that He will not utterly Destroy such a People.</HI></P>
<P>Now, The CASE, which this Encou∣raging Truth, does at this Time Encou∣rage us, to speak unto, is,</P>
<P>After what manner is the <HI>Self-Humilia∣tion</HI> of a Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ple that w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld Es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ape a <HI>Sore Destruction,</HI> to be Expressed and Excited?</P>
<P>Which to speak yet more pertinently and profitably, is to say.</P>
<P>After what manner are we our selves, <HI>O our Dear People,</HI> to Humble our selves before the Lord?</P>
<P>Give your Attention.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I</HI> Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Confess <HI>our

Sins</HI>,</HI> and much more, when we vigo∣rously <HI><HI>Reform</HI> our Sins,</HI> we <HI>Then</HI> do to good purpose <HI>Humble</HI> our selves, before the God, against whom we have Sinned. More distinctly;</P>
<P>First, A <HI>Paenitent Confession of Sin,</HI> is that <HI>Self Humiliation</HI> which our God ex∣pects from such a people as our selves. Thus, in Luk. 18.13, 14. He that said, <HI>God be merciful to me a Sinner,</HI> is, <HI>He that Humbleth himself.</HI> Thus, Lev. 26.40, 41. They that <HI>Confess their iniquity, and the I∣ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uity of their Fathers,</HI> have their <HI>Uncir∣cumcised Hearts Humbled</HI> in their doing so.</P>
<P>Accordingly, First, In our <HI>Humiliations,</HI> we ought seriously to <HI>Confess</HI> ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Provoca∣tions</HI> to the Most Holy God, and the <HI>Ini∣quities</HI> that we have done, before Him who is <HI>of purer Eyes than to behold Iniqui∣ties.</HI> But, what a sad <HI>Catalogue</HI> of <HI>Provo∣cations,</HI> have we to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing forth before the Lord.</P>
<P>When we <HI>Humble</HI> our selves,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, That th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> People of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Land, in a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from that R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ligio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Dispositi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n that Signaliz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Co∣lonies,

have with multiplied Rebellion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> against the Almighty, Sinned exceeding∣ly.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, That the <HI>Spirit of this World,</HI> hath brought an Epi∣demical Death, upon the Spirit, and <HI>Pow∣er of Godliness.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, That the Glorious <HI>Gospel</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, here Enjoy'd, with much <HI>Plenty</HI> as well as <HI>Purity,</HI> hath not been <HI>Thankfully</HI> and <HI>Fruitfully</HI> Entertained by those that have been <HI>Blessed</HI> with the <HI>Joyful Sound.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, That the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> Recognized in our Churches, hath been by multitudes not submitted unto; and of them that have submitted unto it, multitudes have not walked according to the Sacred <HI>Obligati∣ons</HI> thereof.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, That the Unreasonable Vices of Rash and Vain <HI>Swearing,</HI> with Hellish <HI>Cursing</HI> in the Mouths of many, have rendred them <HI>Guilty Sinners.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><HI>VI.</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, That a <HI>Flood</HI> of <HI>Excessive Drinking,</HI> hath begun to <HI>Dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn</HI> much of <HI>Christianity,</HI> yea, and of
<PB N="9" REF="039325_0005_10146B32C847A8D0"/>
<HI>Civility</HI> it self, in many places among us.</P>
<P N="7"><HI>VII.</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, That some <HI>English,</HI> by Selling of <HI>Strong Drink</HI> unto the <HI>Indians,</HI> have not only prejudiced a∣mong them, the Successes of the <HI>Word of Life,</HI> but also been the Faulty &amp; Bloody Occasions of <HI>Death</HI> unto them.</P>
<P N="8"><HI>VIII.</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, That a <HI>Vanity of Appar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el,</HI> hath been affected by many persons, whohave been so <HI>vain,</HI> as to <HI>Glory in their Shame.</HI></P>
<P N="9"><HI>IX.</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, That wicked <HI>Sorceries</HI> have been practised in the Land; and yet in the Troubles from the <HI>Devils,</HI> thereby brought in among us, those <HI>Errors</HI> on both Hands were com∣mitted, which, <HI>Who can understand?</HI></P>
<P N="10"><HI>X.</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, That the Dayes of <HI>Sacred Rest</HI> among us, have been disturbed with so many Profanati∣on. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we may not wonder if we <HI>See no Rest.</HI></P>
<P N="11"><HI>XI.</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, That the woful Decay of good <HI>Family Discipline,</HI> hath opened the Flood Gates, for Innu∣merable, and almost Irremediable <HI>Woes,</HI> to break in upon us.</P>
<P N="12"><HI>XII.</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, That <HI>Ma∣gistrates,
<PB N="10" REF="039325_0006_10146B35EBA55700"/>
Ministers,</HI> and others that have served the <HI>Publick,</HI> have been but great <HI>Sufferers</HI> by their <HI>Services,</HI> and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t with Unrighteous Discouragements.</P>
<P N="13"><HI>XIII.</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, That the <HI>Pyracies,</HI> which, 'tis to be feared, some who belong to these, have perpetrated in other parts of the World, are <HI>Scandals,</HI> that call for much Lamentation.</P>
<P N="14"><HI>XIV.</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, That we have in former years used <HI>Unjustifia∣ble Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dships,</HI> upon some that have Con∣scientiously Dissented from our perswasi∣ons in Religion.</P>
<P N="15"><HI>XV.</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, That we have treated one another, very Ill, in the Various <HI>Temptations, Contentions,</HI> and <HI>Rev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns,</HI> which have been upon us.</P>
<P N="16"><HI>XVI</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, That the Sins of the most <HI>Filthy Uncleanness,</HI> have horribly <HI>Defiled the Land.</HI></P>
<P N="17"><HI>XVII</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, That the <HI>Joy of Harvest,</HI> hath been filled with Foll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and Lewdness, and Forgotten the <HI>Glad Service</HI> of God, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om we should have Served <HI>in the Abundance of all things.</HI></P>
<P N="18"><HI>XVIII</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, That much <HI>Fraud</HI> hath been used in the Deal∣ings
<PB N="11" REF="039325_0006_10146B35EBA55700"/>
of many, and the <HI>Spirit of Oppression</HI> hath made a <HI>Cry.</HI></P>
<P N="19"><HI>XIX.</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, That <HI>Falsehood</HI> and <HI>Slander</HI> hath been common∣ly carrying of <HI>Darts</HI> through the Land and the <HI>Wounded</HI> have been many!</P>
<P N="20"><HI>XX.</HI> And, Let us Humbly Confess,, That the Successive and Amazing Judg∣ments of God upon us, for our thus Tres∣passing, have not Reclamed us, but we have prodigiously <HI>Gone on still in our Tres∣passes.</HI></P>
<P>In our <HI>Humiliations,</HI> Let these things be Reflected on; and with our most Hum∣ble Reflections, Let us do like them, in 1 Sam. 7.6. <HI>Gather together, and Draw water, and pour it out,</HI> [in a Showre of Tears] <HI>before the Lord, and Fast on that Day, and say, we have Sinned against the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But that this our <HI>Confession</HI> of our <HI>Provo∣cations,</HI> may be <HI>Penitent,</HI> we must, Secondly, Incorporate thereinto, a <HI>Confession</HI> of what we have <HI>Deserved</HI> by these <HI>Provoking Evils.</HI> Particularly.</P>
<P>We have seen many <HI>Troubles:</HI> but on our Day of <HI>Humi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iation,</HI> concerning all our <HI>Troubles,</HI> Let us Humbly make that
<PB N="12" REF="039325_0007_10146B38A0C93040"/>
<HI>Confession,</HI> in Ezra 9.13. <HI>Thou, our God, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st punished us, less than our Iniquities De∣serve.</HI></P>
<P>Have we lost many Thousands of Pounds, by the <HI>Disast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs</HI> of the <HI>Sea?</HI> Let us Humbly Confess, our Sins have <HI>Deserv∣ed,</HI> tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> instead of making one Good Voyage, we should have been stript of all the Little that is left unto us.</P>
<P>Hath one <HI>bad Harvest</HI> after another, di∣minished our <HI>Ordinary Food?</HI> Let us Hum∣bly Confess, our Sins have <HI>Deserved,</HI> that the Earth which hath been thereby <HI>Defi∣led,</HI> should have yielded us n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thing at all.</P>
<P>Have Bloody, Popish, and Pagan <HI>Ene∣mies,</HI> made very dreadful Impressions up∣on us, and Captived and Butchered mul∣titudes of our Beloved Neighbours? Let us Humbly Confess, our Sins have <HI>Deserved,</HI> that we should be all of us, altogether giv∣en up, unto the will of our Enemies, to <HI>Serve our Enemies in the want of all things, and have our Lives continually hanging in Doubt,</HI> under their furious Tyrannies.</P>
<P>Have we been <HI>Broken sore in the place of Dragons, and Covered with the Shadow of Death?</HI> Say Humbly before the Lord, with them, in <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.39. <HI>Why should a
<PB N="13" REF="039325_0007_10146B38A0C93040"/>
man Complain, for the punishment of his Sin?</HI></P>
<P>And yet, we have had <HI>Comforts,</HI> to mi∣tigate and moderate, our <HI>Troubles:</HI> In the <HI>midst of wrath,</HI> God ha's <HI>Remembred Mer∣cy.</HI> Now concerning all our <HI>Comforts,</HI> on our Day of <HI>Humiliation,</HI> Let us Hum∣bly make that <HI>Confession,</HI> in Lam. 3.22. <HI>It is of the Lords mercies, that we are not Consumed.</HI></P>
<P>Have we not the Tidings of <HI>Salvation</HI> by our Lord Jesus Christ, Preac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d unto us, to sweeten the <HI>Bread of Adversity,</HI> and the <HI>Water of Affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction,</HI> which the Lord hath given us? Let us Humbly Confess, 'Tis <HI>of the Lords Mercies,</HI> that this Coun∣trey ha's the <HI>Bread of Life,</HI> and the <HI>Wa∣ters of Life,</HI> yet con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inued unto it, and that it is not become a <HI>Region of the Valley of the Shadow of Death.</HI></P>
<P>Are our <HI>Poor,</HI> though greatly Increased and Afflicted, yet more Comfortably pro∣vided for, than in many other parts of the World? Let us Humbly Confess, 'Tis <HI>of the Lords Mercies,</HI> that we are not all Scat∣tered, and fami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hed, and peri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hed in our Poverty.</P>
<P>Do we see less of the <HI>Distress of Nati∣ons, and Perplexity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Sea, and the

Let us Humbly Confess, 'Tis <HI>of the Lords Mercies,</HI> that all the Things, which the <HI>fainting Hearts</HI> of men any where do <HI>fear, coming on the Earth,</HI> are not come upon our selves.</P>
<P>Why do not our <HI>Adversaries</HI> use the Advantages which they have to Con∣found us, but are themselves in such Con∣fusion, that we Endure not an Hundredth part of the Disturbance from them, which they might give unto us? Humbly say before the Lord, with him, in Gen. 32.10. <HI>We are not worthy of the least of all these Mercies!</HI></P>
<P>This, This would be the Language of a True <HI>Humiliation.</HI></P>
<P>But a Second Admoni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, must be added unto <HI>This.</HI> What Signifies <HI>Confession,</HI> without <HI>Reformation?</HI> Tis all but <HI>Hy∣pocrisy,</HI> all but <HI>Impiety.</HI> We are told in Prov. 28.13. Tis <HI>he that Confesseth &amp; For∣saketh, who shall have Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>The Ancients, would well call the <HI>Con∣fession</HI> of Sin, <HI>The Vomit of the Soul.</HI> But now, if we return, and proceed, unto the <HI>Commission</HI> of the Sins, which we have by our <HI>Confession,</HI> as it were <HI>Vomited</HI> up; what

<P>And Let <HI>Justices, Grand Jury men, Con∣stables, Tything men,</HI> have their mutual <HI>Con∣sultations,</HI> to procure the <HI>Executions</HI> of Good Laws, and Remember the <HI>Oath of God</HI> upon them.</P>
<P>Were such an <HI>Humiliation</HI> once obtain∣ed, Then would our God say, <HI>I see, they have Humbled themselves, I will not utterly Destroy them</HI>!

<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> The Exercises of a Sacred <HI>Fast</HI> have a particular and peculiar Character of <HI>Humiliation</HI> in them, and we are to <HI>Humble</HI> our selves with <HI>Fasting</HI> before the Lord.

a Fast, Call a Solemn Assembly, Gather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Elders; and all the Inhabitants of the Land, into the House of your God, and Cry unto the Lord.</HI> And I perswade my self, that we generally concur in the General Princi∣ple, hitherto Espoused, by the Church of God, in every Generation, That a <HI>Reli∣gious Fast,</HI> is a Needful Duty, (<HI>pro Temporibus et Causis,</HI> as <HI>Tertullian</HI> long since well stated it,) on Just and Great Occasions for it. That <HI>Merry Sect,</HI> who Explode <HI>Fasting,</HI> as a thing not Agreeable to our <HI>Gospel Times,</HI> appear not among us. We know, that <HI>Fasting</HI> hath, in all Ages, been esteem'd, a Duty incumbent on the People of God. We find such <HI>Fasting</HI> used in Elder Times, [Judg. 20.26. and 1 Sam 7.6.] Both more <HI>publickly,</HI> [2 Chron. 20.30. and Eze. 8 21] And more <HI>privately</HI>; [2 Sam. 12.16 &amp; <HI>Neh.</HI> 1.4.] What tho these things were in the Dayes of the <HI>Old-Testament</HI>? I hope, the <HI>Old Testament</HI> is not become <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, with any of us. But in the <HI>New-Testament</HI> also, we have a <HI>Praedicti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> of our <HI>Fasting,</HI> [M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h. 9.15.] Yea, and a <HI>Praescripti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> for it, [M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th. 6 16] For d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing it more <HI>publickly,</HI> we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> War∣rant,

[Act. 14.23.] and more <HI>privately</HI> too. [1 Cor. 7.5.] Yea, we are told, that there are certain Blessings, which cannot now be obtained, but in such a way. [Mar. 9.29.] And I am sure of one thing more; when the Apostles, and the Believers in the Primitive Times, were most <HI>Filled</HI> with the Holy Spirit of Christ, <HI>then</HI> it was that they were most in <HI>Fast∣ing</HI> before the Lord!</P>
<P>Now, if our <HI>Fast,</HI> be <HI>such a Fast as the Lord hath chosen,</HI> we shall therein <HI>Humble</HI> our selves, most acceptably, most profita∣bly, most efficaciously. And because, the Right <HI>Performance</HI> of this Duty, is a thing of great <HI>Consequence</HI> in <HI>Christianity</HI>; 'tis what is frequently required, and much <HI>Weal</HI> or <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> will follow upon the manage∣ment of it; I will set before you, the <HI>Rules</HI> of that <HI>Sacred Fast,</HI> wherein we are to <HI>Humble</HI> our Souls.</P>
<P>Having first, <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pared</HI> our selves for our <HI>Fast,</HI> as one would for an <HI>Extraordi∣nary Sabbath,</HI> we have these things to do.</P>
<P>First; There is the <HI>Internal Humiliati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> of our Fast; The Duties of <HI>Praying, R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>penting</HI> and <HI>Believing,</HI> are the <HI>Soul</HI> of that <HI>Fast</HI> wherein we are to <HI>Humble</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="039325_0010_10146B40154F6220"/>
our <HI>Souls</HI>; and we are to Labour in those Duties. The Duties of a <HI>Fast,</HI> are those, in 2 Chron. 7.14. <HI>My People s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll then Humble themselves, and Pray, and Seek my Face, and Turn from their wicked wayes.</HI> For men to think, that they Serve God, by a <HI>Fast</HI> wherein they do nothing but <HI>Fast</HI> from Corporal Sustenance, and they draw not near to God in <HI>Devotions</HI> all the Day long, 'tis a piece of Ignorance; yea, more than one <HI>Commandment</HI> of God is broken, by this piece of Ignorance.</P>
<P>When we Celebrate a <HI>Fast,</HI> we are in more than ordinary <HI>Prayers,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Ac∣knowledge our own <HI>Sinfulness,</HI> and the <HI>Greatness</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> of God, in Chasti∣sing our Sinfulness; and we are to Sup∣plicate those Favours of Heaven, which our <HI>Sins,</HI> our <HI>Wants,</HI> and our <HI>Fears,</HI> make Necessary for us. The Thing which we have to do, on a <HI>Fast,</HI> is what the Pray∣ing <HI>Daniel</HI> did; in Dan. 9.3. <HI>I set my Face unto the Lord God, to seek by Prayer, and Supplications, with Fasting.</HI> And ha∣ing thus Quoted, the <HI>Ninth Chapter</HI> of <HI>Daniel,</HI> I may Remark, That there are Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nths,</HI> which admirably well describe t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Task of a <HI>Fast</HI> unto us; the

<HI>Ninth</HI> Chapter of <HI>Ezra,</HI> the <HI>Ninth</HI> Chap∣ter of <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> and the <HI>Ninth</HI> Chapte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Daniel.</HI> When the <HI>Fast</HI> comes, Re∣member, Christians, to consult those <HI>Thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Chapters,</HI> with Lively Meditations there upon. A Day of <HI>Fast,</HI> is to be a Day of <HI>Prayer.</HI> As in Act. 13.3. so elsewhere, <HI>Fasting</HI> and <HI>Praying,</HI> are what <HI>God has joyn∣ed,</HI> and here, <HI>Man may not separate them.</HI> Would you <HI>hear,</HI> what you have to <HI>Do,</HI> when a <HI>Fast</HI> is to be kept? The words of an <HI>Order for a Fast,</HI> once ran so, in Jon. 3.8. <HI>Cry mightily unto God. Prayer,</HI> 'tis That, whereof the Jewes in one of their Ancient Adagies, tell us, <HI>Nulla est pulchrior virtus hac ipsa</HI>; There is no <HI>vertue</HI> like it. It is beyond all <HI>Oblations.</HI> But <HI>Repenting</HI> and <HI>Believing</HI> as well as <HI>Praying,</HI> must signalize our <HI>Fast. Reconci∣liation</HI> with God, is the End of a <HI>Fast</HI>; without <HI>Repenting</HI> and <HI>Believing,</HI> this <HI>Re∣conciliation</HI> is not applied unto us.</P>
<P>A <HI>Fast,</HI> is but a <HI>Form,</HI> an Hungry and Empty <HI>Form,</HI> if we do not therein hear∣tily <HI>Repent</HI> of our Miscarriages. Thus we are advised, in Isa. 58.6, 7, 8. <HI>Is not this the Fast, that I have chosen? To Loose the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds of Wickedness.</HI> On a <HI>Fast,</HI> Let

us be those <HI>Ephraimites,</HI> who shall <HI>bemoan themselves; Thou hast Chastised me,</HI> O Lord, <HI>and I was Chastised, Turn thou me, and I shall be Turned!</HI> On a <HI>Fast,</HI> Let us take those <HI>Directions,</HI> in the midst of our <HI>La∣mentations, Let us Search and Try our ways, and Turn again unto the Lord.</HI> A <HI>Fasting</HI> Day must be a <HI>Soul</HI> grieving Day, and a <HI>Sin</HI> killing Day, or 'tis nothing. Our <HI>Fasts</HI> are to Slay our <HI>Lusts</HI>; those are the <HI>Beasts,</HI> which are then to be slaughtered. Indeed, when ever a <HI>Fast</HI> recurrs, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould go the whole <HI>Work of Conversion</HI> over again! Our <HI>Fast</HI> will notably be, <HI>Ci∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us virtutis,</HI> if we do so.</P>
<P>Again; The <HI>Satisfaction</HI> and <HI>In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ercession</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, must on a <HI>Fast</HI> be Repaired unto; and we must <HI>Be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieve</HI> in it for our <HI>Atonement.</HI> It was the <HI>Rite</HI> appointed for a <HI>Fast,</HI> in Lev. 16.27 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>The Blood of the Sin Offering, must be▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rought in, to make Atonement; On that Day all the Priest make Atonement for you, to cause you, that you may be clean from all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Sins before the Lord.</HI> Our Lord Jesus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrist is our <HI>Priest</HI>; What He hath done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our <HI>Atonement,</HI> must be this Day, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith a strong Faith Laid hold upon.

<HI>Fast</HI> is a Day of <HI>Expiation</HI>; but we know it is only the Lord Jesus Christ, that hath by His <HI>Unknown Sufferings</HI> (as the Greek Church at this Day expresses it) made <HI>Expiation</HI> for our Sins. Hence on a <HI>Fast,</HI> we must Renew the <HI>Dependance</HI> of our Souls, on the Obedience which our Lord Jesus Christ, our <HI>Surety,</HI> hath yielded un∣to God for us. Our <HI>Sin</HI> has procured the <HI>Death</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ; In a <HI>Fast,</HI> our <HI>Faith</HI> is to Feed upon it. A <HI>Fasting</HI> Day, is with <HI>Faith,</HI> a <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eding</HI> Day. In our <HI>Fasts,</HI> we are to Imitate the Acti∣on of the <HI>Molossians,</HI> who seeking the Kings Good will unto them, took the Son of the King into their Arms, and pre∣senting themselves thus before him, said, <HI>Syr, For the sake of this your Son, we hope, you'l be favourable to us.</HI> Thus, Let us present our selves before the Eternal King of Heaven, on our <HI>Fast,</HI> with His Only Begotten, His Dearly Beloved <HI>Son,</HI> in the Arms of our Faith, and plead, <HI>Oh! for the Sake of this thy Son, do Good unto us.</HI> But then,</P>
<P>Secondly; There is the <HI>External Hu∣miliation</HI> of our <HI>Fast</HI>; when we <HI>Humble</HI> our selves in a <HI>Fast,</HI> we are to <HI>Abstain</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="039325_0012_10146B4599D77698"/>
from all our Secular <HI>Pleasures</HI> and <HI>Af∣fayrs,</HI> that we may the better go tho∣rough our Duties. Like Silly Children, we know not when to <HI>Feed,</HI> and when to Forbear <HI>Feeding.</HI> But our Good God, in His Word ha's taught us! We are Taught, that we must sometimes have a Day for <HI>Fasting,</HI> which must be a Day of <HI>Restraint</HI> upon us; and this <HI>Restraint</HI> must Extend unto the Dimensions of a <HI>Sabbath.</HI> Of a <HI>Fast,</HI> it is prescribed, in Lev. 23.32. <HI>It shall be unto you, a Sabbath of Rest, and ye shall Afflict your Souls; from Evening un∣to Evening shall ye Celebrate your Sabbath.</HI> The Design of the <HI>Abstinence</HI> thus to be used on a <HI>Fast,</HI> is, not only that we may be more <HI>free</HI> for the several Spiritual Employments, which are then incumbent on us, (our Lord, like a wise Falconer, will by keeping of us a little <HI>Sharp,</HI> fit us for the <HI>Highest Flights</HI> in our <HI>Prayers</HI>!) but also to <HI>Show,</HI> and <HI>Speak,</HI> the <HI>Humilia∣tion</HI> of our Souls in those Employments. Tis a <HI>Ceremony</HI> of Gods Appointment, a <HI>Symbolical Ceremony,</HI> which God Himself hath appointed, and a part of Worship, whereby we are to Signify, <HI>That we own our selves utterly unworthy of all those Bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣sings,
<PB N="24" REF="039325_0013_10146B480A6DA998"/>
which we now Deny unto our selves, and therefore of all other Blessings whatsoe∣ever.</HI> And the <HI>First Sin</HI> of man, which Lay in <HI>Eating,</HI> is to be considered, as ve∣ry particularly herein referred unto.</P>
<P>Now, First, A <HI>Fast</HI> is to be kept with an <HI>Abstinence</HI> from the <HI>Pleasures</HI> of this Life. Our usual <HI>Diet</HI> must on a <HI>Fast</HI> be Abstained from. It was there∣fore said, in Esth. 4.16. <HI>Fast, and neither Eat nor Drink.</HI> The very Term of a <HI>Fast,</HI> implies thus much; and it hath been of old said, <HI>They that will not so Fast with the Children of God, must Eat and Drink of the Furious Wrath of God, with the Wicked</HI> There are indeed <HI>Ca∣ses of Necessity,</HI> wherein our merciful God call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for, <HI>Mercy rather than Sacrifice</HI>; and in those Cases, doubtless the <HI>Abstinence</HI> may be somewhat Abated and Relaxed. Some cannot Encounter a severe and a total <HI>Abstinence,</HI> it would utterly Disable them, for the Service of the Day: the Severity may then be mitigated. Yet ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Abstinence</HI> must be such as to pro∣duce our <HI>Affliction.</HI> Of a <HI>Fast,</HI> it is said▪ in Isa. 58.5. <HI>It is a Day for a man t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Afflict his Soul</HI>; and it is said, in Lev.
<PB N="25" REF="039325_0013_10146B480A6DA998"/>
23.29. <HI>Whatsoever Soul it be, that shall not be Afflicted in that same Day, he shall be cut off from among his people.</HI> We may not Eat or Drink <HI>so much,</HI> nor may we Eat or Drink <HI>so well,</HI> on such a Day, as at a∣nother Time. In the <HI>Fast</HI> of a <HI>Daniel,</HI> we have this <HI>Abstinence</HI> observed, ch. 10.3. <HI>I ate no pleasant Bread, neither came Flesh nor Wine, into my mouth, neither did I anoint my self at all</HI>: And in <HI>Tertullians</HI> Time, they had their <HI>Xerophagiae,</HI> a Dry sort of Repast, for such as found that a <HI>Rigid Fast,</HI> was too hard for them. But by consequence, all other Delights of the <HI>Senses,</HI> are then also to be avoided. If you read, Joel 2.16. and 1 Cor. 7.5. You'l find a particul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r prohibition of this Im∣portance. Hence likewise, our <HI>Sleep</HI> is then to be Ret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enched. If we are in∣clinable to <HI>Sleep</HI> so long on a <HI>Fast,</HI> as we do on another Day, we are to <HI>Awaken</HI> our selves, with such a Call from God, as that, <HI>What meanest thou, O S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeper, A∣rise, and Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> upon thy God!</HI> And it is not improper here to be noted, That our <HI>Alms</HI> are to be one Concomitant of our <HI>Fasts.</HI> It was said, in Isa. 58 7. <HI>Is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this the Fast that I have Chosen? Is it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="26" REF="039325_0014_10146B4B71CFE078"/>
to deal thy Bread to the Hungry?</HI> When we come to seek <HI>Mercy</HI> of God, we should, in Thankfulness for our Hope to find what we seek, show <HI>Mercy</HI> to men. In our <HI>Fasting,</HI> we <HI>Deny</HI> to our selves our u∣sual <HI>Nourishments</HI>; and we should then <HI>Bestow</HI> on others at least as much as we <HI>Deny</HI> to our selves, in Token of our Sense, That we are more Undeserving of the Divine Bounty, than any that we know in our Neighbourhood. Our <HI>Alms</HI> are to go up with our <HI>Prayers,</HI> as a <HI>Memorial,</HI> (we <HI>Remember</HI> who's did so!) <HI>before God.</HI> But there is yet one thing more to be added; <HI>Fine Cloathes</HI> must in a <HI>Fast,</HI> be <HI>Abstained</HI> from. If there were no <HI>Scripture</HI> for this, why might not meer <HI>Nature</HI> teach it unto us, as well as unto the <HI>Ninivites?</HI> But we have <HI>Scripture</HI> for it, in Exod 33.4. <HI>The people mourned, and no man did put on him his Ornaments.</HI> I have see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Fault in this place, and <HI>My Neighbours, 'Tis utterly a Fault among you</HI>; That on a <HI>Fast,</HI> many people, will come to the Worship of God, in as Gay Cloaths, as if they were going to a <HI>Feast.</HI> Methinks, I hear, the Holy An∣gels of God thus uttering their Indigna∣tion
<PB N="27" REF="039325_0014_10146B4B71CFE078"/>
against such Offenders; <HI>What? will those vain people, never have any sign of an Abased, and an Afflicted Soul up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n them?</HI> Truly, to be arrayed in Gorgeous Appar∣rel on a <HI>Fast,</HI> is very offensive unto God. <HI>Rags</HI> are fitter than <HI>Robes,</HI> for the Children of men therein to appear as <HI>Malefactors</HI> before <HI>God the Judge of all.</HI> They that come to the Assembly, in a splendid, and flanting Attire, on such a Day, do but <HI>Affront</HI> the God, whom they profess to <HI>Humble</HI> themselves before. Would you Speed in a <HI>Fast</HI>? Then be able to say, if not with him, in Psal 35.13. <HI>My Cloath∣ing was Sackcloth, when I Humbled my Soul with Fasting,</HI> yet, <HI>My Cloathing is Sober, Modest, Proper, and very Humble!</HI></P>
<P>And, Secondly, A <HI>Fast,</HI> is to be kept with an <HI>Abstinence,</HI> from the <HI>Affayrs</HI> of this Life. The <HI>Works</HI> of our particular Vocations are to be laid aside, when a <HI>Fast</HI> is Indicted; and <HI>All Servile Labour on the said Day is Inhibited.</HI> A <HI>Fast,</HI> is to be kept with the strictness of a <HI>Sabbath.</HI> It is Enjoined in Lev. 23.28, 30, 32. <HI>Ye shall do not work in that same Day, for it is a Day of Atonement. Whatsoever Soul it be, that doth any work in that same Day, the same
<PB N="28" REF="039325_0015_10146B50941EF870"/>
Soul will I destroy from among his people. It shall be unto you a Sabbath of Rest; from Evening to Evening shall ye Celebrate it.</HI> When the Services of the Congregation are over, we are not presently at <HI>Liberty</HI> to do what we will: Those persons do but help to Debauch the Land, who take such a <HI>Liberty.</HI> The Edicts of Heaven run so, in Joel 2.14. <HI>Sanctify a Fast.</HI> The whole Day of the <HI>Fast</HI> is to be <HI>Sanctified,</HI> or, set apart, for Communion wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h God: When we <HI>keep a Day,</HI> we must <HI>keep it un∣to the Lord.</HI> The Expectation of our God, is intimated unto us, in Isa 58.13. <HI>Turn away thy Foot from the Sabbath,</HI> (take no long Journeys on it) <HI>from doing thy pleasure on my Holy Day: Honour him, not doing thine own wayes, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words.</HI> In∣deed, the <HI>Weekly Sabbath</HI> lays a claim to all the things here spoken of; neverthe∣less, I suspect that a <HI>Fasting Sabbath</HI> is here more peculiarly intended. A <HI>Fast,</HI> is no less than twice in one verse, Lev. 23.32. called a <HI>Sabbath</HI>: and why may not that be the <HI>Sabbath</HI> more especially meant throughout the whole <HI>fifty eighth</HI> Chapter of <HI>Isaiah?</HI> An Expression twice used in
<PB N="29" REF="039325_0015_10146B50941EF870"/>
the verse newly quoted, namely, <HI>Doing thy pleasure,</HI> and <HI>Finding thy own pleasure,</HI> on the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> occurs in the third verse, <HI>In the Day of your Fast, you find pleasure</HI>; which <HI>finding of pleasure</HI> is opposed unto the <HI>Affliction,</HI> both of <HI>Spirit</HI> and of <HI>Body,</HI> wherein we are to <HI>Judge our selves</HI> on such a Solemnity. Because we do not <HI>Fast,</HI> with a due conformity, to the <HI>Edicts</HI> of Heaven, therefore as of old, <HI>Pompey</HI> Siezed the Jewish Temple, on their <HI>Fast-Day,</HI> and <HI>Sosius</HI> on their <HI>Fast-Day</HI> took the City, so we in this Land, have on, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> near our <HI>Fast-Dayes</HI> often felt such <HI>Rebukes</HI> of Heaven, that it has become the just <HI>Astonishment</HI> of many that have <HI>wisely ob∣served</HI> it, and it should be the <HI>Humiliation</HI> of us all.

<HEAD>APPENDIX. A NARRATIVE of <HI>Hannah Swarton,</HI> Containing <HI>Wonderful Passages,</HI> relating to her Captivity, and her Deliverance.</HEAD>
<P>I Was taken by the <HI>Indians,</HI> when <HI>Casc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Fort was taken, (<HI>May</HI>) 1690. My Husband being slain, and Four Chil∣dren taken with me. The Eldest of my Sons they killed, about two Months after I was taken, and the rest Scattered from me▪ I was now left a <HI>Widow,</HI> and as Bereaved of my Children; though, I had them alive, yet it was very seldome that I could see them, and I had not Li∣berty to Discourse with them, without Danger either of my own Life, or the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; for our Condoling each others Conditi∣on, and shewing Natural Affection, was so displeasing to our <HI>Indian Rulers,</HI> unto whose Share we fell, that they would threaten to kill us, if we cryed each to

other, or discoursed much together. So that my Condition was like what the Lord threatned the <HI>Jews,</HI> in Ezek. 24.22, 23. We du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st not <HI>Mourn</HI> or <HI>Weep,</HI> in the sight of our Enemies, lest we lost our own <HI>Lives.</HI> For the first Times while the Enemy feasted on our English Pro∣visions, I might have had some with them: but then I was so fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led with <HI>Sor∣row</HI> and <HI>Tears,</HI> that I had lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le <HI>Stomach</HI> to Eat; and when my <HI>Stomach</HI> was come, our English Food was spent, and the In∣dians wanted themselves, and we more: So that then I was pined with want. We had no Corn, or Bread, but sometimes <HI>Groundnuts, Ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rns, Pursl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, Hogweel,</HI> Weeds, Roots, and sometimes <HI>Dogs Flesh,</HI> but not sufficient to sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isfy Hunger wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h these; having but little at a Time. We had no success at Hun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing; save that one <HI>Bear</HI> was killed, which I had part of; and a very small part of a Turtle I had at o∣ther time, and once an Indian gave me a piece of a <HI>Mooses</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iver, which was a sweet Morsel to me; and <HI>Fish,</HI> if we could catch it. Thus I continued with them, hurried up and down the Wilder∣ness, from <HI>May</HI> 20. till the middle of

<HI>February</HI>; Carrying continually, a Great <HI>Burden</HI> in our Travels; and I must go their pace, or else be killed presently; and yet was pinched with Cold, for want of Cloathing, being put by them into an <HI>Indian Dress,</HI> with a sleight Blanket, no Stockings, and but one pair of <HI>Indian-Shoes,</HI> and of their Leather Stockings for the Winter: My Feet were pricked with sharp Stones, and prickly Bushes some∣times; and other times Pinched with Snow, Cold, and Ice, that I travelled upon, ready to be frozen, and faint for want of Food; so that many times I thought I could go no further, but must¦ly down, and if they would kill me, let them kill me. Yet then, the Lord did so Renew my Strength, that I went on still further, as my Master would have me, and held out with them. Though many English were taken, and I was brought to some of them, at times, while we were about <HI>Casco Bay</HI> and <HI>Kennebeck</HI> River, yet at <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rridgawock,</HI> we were Se∣parated, and no English were in our Company, but one <HI>John York</HI> and my self, who were both, almost Starved fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> want, and yet told, that if we could not

hold up to travel with them, they would kill us. And accordingly, <HI>John York,</HI> growing Weak by his wants, they killed <HI>him,</HI> and threatened <HI>me</HI> with the like. One time, my Indian Mistress, and I, were left alone, while the rest went to look for <HI>Eeles</HI>; and they left us <HI>no Food</HI> from <HI>Sabbath day</HI> Morning, till the next <HI>Sature-day</HI>; save that we had a <HI>Blad∣der</HI> (of <HI>Moose</HI> I think) which was well filled with <HI>Maggots,</HI> and we boiled it, and drank the Broth▪ but the <HI>Bladder</HI> was so tough, we could not eat it. On the <HI>Saturday,</HI> I was sent by my Mistress, to that part of the Island, most likely to see some <HI>Canoo,</HI> and there to make Fire and Smoke, to invite some Indians, if I could spy any, to come to Relieve us; and I espied a <HI>Canoo,</HI> and by Signs in∣vited them to come to the Shore. It proved to be some <HI>Squaw's</HI>; who under∣standing our wants, one of them gave me a Roasted <HI>Eel,</HI> which I eat, and it seemed unto me, the most Savoury Food, I ever tasted before.

once in so bitter a Cold season, that I was not able to bring my Fingers to∣gether, to hold them fast: yet under all these Hardships, the Lord kept me from any Sickness, or such Weakness as to disenable me from Travelling, when they put us upon it.</P>
<P>My <HI>In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an Mistress,</HI> was one that had been bred by the English at <HI>Black point,</HI> and now Married to a <HI>Canada</HI> Indian, &amp; turned Papist; and she would say, <HI>That had the English been as careful to instruct her in our Religion, as the French were, to instruct her in theirs, she might have been of our Religion</HI>: and she would say, <HI>That God delivered us into their Hands to punish us for our Sins</HI>; And, This I knew was true as to my self. And as I desired to consider of all my Sins, for which the Lord did punish me, so this Lay very heavy upon my Spirit, many a Time, that I had Left the Publick Worship and Ordinances of God, where I formerly Lived, (<HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Beverley</HI>) to Remove to the North part of <HI>Casco-Bay,</HI> where there was no Church, or Minister of the Gos∣pel; and this we did, for large Accom∣modations in the World, thereby Expo∣sing
<PB N="56" REF="039325_0029_10146C25D3CF0F68"/>
our Children, to be bred Ignorant∣ly like Indians, and our selves to forget what we had been formerly instructed in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and so we turned our Backs upon <HI>Gods Ordinances</HI> to get this <HI>Worlds Goods.</HI> But now, God hath stripped me of these things also; so that I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must Justify the Lord, in all that has befallen me, and acknowledge that He hath punished me less than my Iniquities deserved. I was now Bereaved of Husband, Children, Friends, Neighbours, House, Estate, Bread, Cloaths, or Lodging suitable; and my very <HI>Life did hang daily in Doubt,</HI> being continually in danger of being killed by the Indians, or pined to Death with Fa∣mine, or tired to Death with hard Tra∣velling, or pinched with Cold, till I dy∣ed in the Winter season. I was so ama∣zed with many Troubles, and hurried in my Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it from one Exercise to another, how to preserve my self in dange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and supply my s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf in the want that was present; that I had not time or leisure so composedly to consider of the great Concernments of my Soul, as I should have done; neither had I any <HI>Bible</HI> or <HI>Good Book</HI> to look into, or Christian

Friend to be my Counsellor in these Distresses. But I may say, The <HI>Words of God,</HI> which I had formerly heard or read, many of them came oft into my mind, and kept me from <HI>perishing in my Afflictions.</HI> As, when they threatned to Kill me many times, I often thought of the words of our Saviour to <HI>Pilate,</HI> Joh. 19.11. <HI>Thou couldest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave no power at all a∣gainst me, except it were given thee from above.</HI> I knew they had <HI>no power</HI> to kill me, but what the <HI>Lord gave</HI> them; and I had many times Hope, that the Lord would not suffer them to slay me, but deliver me out of their Hands, and in His Time, I hoped, return me to my Country again. When they told me, that my <HI>Eldest Son</HI> was killed by the In∣dians, I thought of that in Jer. 33.8. <HI>I will cleanse them from all their Iniquities whereby they have sinned against me, and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pardon all their In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quities.</HI> I hoped, though the Enemy had barbarously kil¦l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d his <HI>Body,</HI> yet that the Lord had <HI>Par∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ned</HI> his Sins, and that his <HI>Soul</HI> was safe. When I thought upon my many Trou∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les, I thought of <HI>Jobs</HI> complaint, chap. 14 16, 17. <HI>Thou numbrest my steps, and
<PB N="58" REF="039325_0030_10146C28DA572618"/>
watchest over my Sin; my Transgression is sealed up in a Bag, and thou sowest up my Iniquity.</HI> This was for my Humiliation, and put me upon Prayer to God, for His <HI>Pardoning Mercy</HI> in Christ; and I thought upon <HI>Davids</HI> complaint, Psalm 13.1, 2 and used it in my Prayers to the Lord; <HI>How Long wilt thou forget me, O Lord for ever! How long wilt thou hide thy face from me? How long shall I take counsel in my Soul, having sorrow in my Heart! How long shall my Enemy be Exalted over me</HI>? I sometimes bemoaned my self, as <HI>Job</HI>; chap. 19.9, 10. <HI>He hath stripped me of my Glory, and taken my Crown from my Head; He hath de∣stroyed me, on every side, and I am gone, and my Hope hath he removed like a Tree.</HI> Yet sometimes Encouraged from Job 22.27. <HI>Thou shalt make thy Prayer to him, and He shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy Vows.</HI> I made my Vows to the Lord, that I would give up my self to Him, if He would accept me in Jesus Christ, and pardon my Sins; and I desired and endeavoured to <HI>Pay my Vows</HI> unto the Lord. I Pray'd to Him, <HI>Remember not against me the Sins of my Youth</HI>; and I
<PB N="59" REF="039325_0030_10146C28DA572618"/>
besought Him, <HI>Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an Ungodly Nation; deliver me from the Deceitful and Unjust man: Why go I mourning because of the Oppression of the Enemy?</HI> And by many other Scriptures, that were brought to my Remembrance, was I instructed, di∣rected and comforted.</P>
<P>I Travelled over steep and hideous <HI>Mountains</HI> one while, and another while over <HI>Swamps</HI> and Thickets of Fallen Trees, lying one, two, three foot from the ground, which I have stepped on, from one to another, nigh a thousand in a day; carrying a great Burden on my Back. Yet I dreaded going to <HI>Ca∣nada,</HI> to the <HI>French,</HI> for fear lest I should be overcome by them, to yield to their Religion; which I had <HI>Vowed</HI> unto God, <HI>That I would not do.</HI> But the Ex∣tremity of my Sufferings were such, that at length I was willing to go, to pre∣serve my Life. And after many weary Journeys, through Frost and Snow, we came to <HI>Canada,</HI> about the middle of <HI>February,</HI> 1690. and Travelling over the River, my Master pitch'd his <HI>Wigwam</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight of some <HI>French</HI> Houses Westward

But the Snow being knee deep, and my Legs and Hams very sore, I found it very tedious to Travel; and my so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es bled, so that as I Travelled, I might be Tracked by my Blood, that I left be∣hind me on the Snow.

when I had breakfasted with the Family, and the men kind were gone abroad, as I was about to go to my Indian Master, the French Woman stept out, and left me alone in her House; and I then staid her Return, to give her thanks for her kindness; and while I waited, came in two men, and one of them spake to me in English, <HI>I am glad to see you Country woman!</HI> This was exceeding∣ly Reviving, to hear the voice of an English man; and upon Enquiry, I found, he was an English man, taken at the <HI>North West Passage</HI>; and the other was a French <HI>Ordinary Keeper.</HI> After some Discourse he asked me to go with him to <HI>Quebeck,</HI> which he told me, was about four miles off: I an∣swered, my Indian Master might kill me for it, when I went back.

Then was I comforted from that in 2 Cor. 1.8, 9, 10. <HI>We were p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of Life; but we had the sentence of Death in our selves, that we should not trust in our selves, but in God, who raises the Dead; who delivered us fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m so great a Death, and doth deliver; in whom we trust that He will yet d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liver us.</HI> I knew, God was Able to <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liver</HI> me, as He did <HI>Paul,</HI> and as He did the <HI>Three Children</HI> out of the Fiery Furnace; and I believed, He would either <HI>Deliver</HI> me from them, or <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itt</HI> me for what He called me to suffer, for His Sake and Name. For their Pray∣ing to <HI>Angels,</HI> they brought the History

of the <HI>Angel,</HI> that was sent to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> in the First of <HI>Luke.</HI> I answered them, from <HI>Rev.</HI> 19.10. and 22.9. They brought <HI>Exod</HI> 17.11. of <HI>Israels</HI> prevail∣ing, while <HI>Moses</HI> held up his Hands. I told them, we must come to God only by Christ, Joh. 6.37, 44. For <HI>Purgatory,</HI> they brought Mat. 5.25. I told them, To agree with God while here on <HI>Earth,</HI> was, to <HI>Agree with our Adversary in the way</HI>; and if we did not, we should be Cast <HI>into Hell,</HI> and should not come out until we <HI>Paid the utmost Farthing,</HI> which could never be paid. But its bootless for <HI>me</HI> a poor Woman, to acquaint the World, with what Arguments I used, if I could now Remember them; and many of them are slipt out of my me∣mory.</P>
<P>I shall proceed to Relate, what Tri∣als <HI>I</HI> met wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, in these Things. <HI>I</HI> was put upon it, either to <HI>stand</HI> to the Reli∣gion <HI>I</HI> was brought up in, and believed in my Conscience to be True; or to <HI>Turn</HI> to another, which <HI>I</HI> believed was not Right. And <HI>I</HI> was kept from Tur∣ning, by that Scripture, Mat. 10.32, 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Whosoever shall confess me before men, him
<PB N="65" REF="039325_0033_10146C31E8E51DC0"/>
will I confess before my Father which is in Heaven, and whosoever denies me before men, him also will I deny before my Father▪ which is in Heaven.</HI> I thought that if I should <HI>Deny</HI> the <HI>Truth,</HI> and own their Religion, I should <HI>Deny Christ.</HI> Yet up∣on their perswasions, I went to see, and be presen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at their Worship, sometimes▪ but never to Receive their Sacrament. And once, when I was at their <HI>Worship,</HI> that Scripture, 2 Cor. 6.14. to the end▪ came into my mind: <HI>What Communion hath Light with Darkness! What Concord hath Christ with Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al! What part hath he that believeth with an Infidel? and what Agreement hath the Temple of God with I∣dols? Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye Separate, and touch not the Un∣clean Thing, and I will Receive you, and I will be a Father to you, and you shall be my Sons and Daughters, saith the Lord Almigh∣ty.</HI> This Scripture was so strong, upon my Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, that I thought I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of my way to be present at their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Worship,</HI> and I Resolved never to come unto it again. But when the time drew nigh that I was to go again, I was so Restless th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Night, that I could not
<PB N="66" REF="039325_0034_10146C351C815148"/>
sleep; thinking, what I should say to them▪ when they urged me to go again, and what I should Do. And so it was in the morning, that a French woman of my Acquaintance, told me, if I would not be of <HI>Their</HI> Religion, <HI>I</HI> did but <HI>mock</HI> at it, to go to their Worship, and there∣fore bid me, That if <HI>I</HI> would not be of <HI>their</HI> Religion, I should go no more. I answered her, <HI>That I would not be of their Religion, and I would go no more to their Worship</HI>: and accordingly, I never went more, and they did not force me to it.</P>
<P>I have had many Conflicts in my own Spirit; fearing that I was not truely <HI>Converted</HI> unto God in Christ, and that I had no Saving Interest in Christ I could not be of a <HI>False Religion,</HI> to please men; for it was against my Conscience: And I was not fit to suffer for the <HI>True Religion,</HI> and for Christ; for I then feared, I had no Interest in Him. I was neither fit to <HI>Live,</HI> nor fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to <HI>Dye</HI>; and brought once to the very pit of <HI>Despair,</HI> about what would become of my Soul. In this Time I had gotten an <HI>English Bible,</HI> and other Good Books, by the Help of my Fellow Captives. I
<PB N="67" REF="039325_0034_10146C351C815148"/>
Looked over the Scripture, and settled on the Prayer of <HI>Jonah,</HI> and those Words, <HI>I said, I am cast out of thy sight▪ yet will I Look again towards thy Holy Temple.</HI> I Resolved, <HI>I</HI> would do as <HI>Jonah</HI> did: And in the Meditation upon this Scrip∣ture, the Lord was pleased, by His <HI>Spi∣rit,</HI> to come into my Soul, and so fill me with Ravishing Comfort, that <HI>I</HI> can∣not Express it. Then came to mind, the History of the Transfiguring of Christ, and <HI>Peters</HI> saying, Math. 17.4. <HI>Lord, It is Good for us to be here!</HI> I thought, it was Good for me to be here; and <HI>I</HI> was so full of Comfort and Joy, <HI>I</HI> even Wished <HI>I</HI> could b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so al∣wayes, and never sleep; or else Dy in that Rapture of Joy, and never Live to Sin any more against the Lord. Now <HI>I</HI> thought God was my God, and my Sins were pardoned in Christ; and now <HI>I</HI> thought, <HI>I</HI> could <HI>Suffer</HI> for Christ, yea, <HI>Dye</HI> for Christ, or do any thing for Him. My Sins had been a Burden to me: <HI>I</HI> desired to see all my Sins, and to Re∣pent of them all, with all my Heart, and of that Sin which had been especially a Burden to me, namely, <HI>That I Left the

<P><HI>I</HI> found much Comfort, while <HI>I</HI> was among the <HI>French,</HI> by the Opportunitie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>I</HI> had sometimes to <HI>Read</HI> the Scriptures▪ and other Good Books, and <HI>Pray</HI> to the Lord in Secret; and the <HI>Conference</HI> that some of us Captives had together, about things of God, and <HI>Prayer</HI> together sometimes; especially, with one that was in the same House with me, <HI>Marga∣ret Stilson.</HI> Then was the Word of God precious to us, and they that <HI>feared the LORD, spake one to another</HI> of it, as we had Opportunity. And Colonel <HI>Tyng,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Alden,</HI> as they were per∣mitted, did speak to us, to Confi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m and Strengthen us, in the wayes of the Lord.

<P>These are some of the Scriptures, which have been my Support and Com∣fort, in the Affliction of my Captivity, among the <HI>Papists.</HI> That in Ezek. 16.6.— 8. <HI>I</HI> applyed unto my self; and <HI>I</HI> de∣sired to <HI>Enter into Covenant</HI> with God, and to be <HI>His</HI>; And <HI>I</HI> Prayed to the Lord, and Hoped the Lord would Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urn me to my Country again, That <HI>I</HI> might <HI>Enter into Covenant</HI> with Him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mong His People, and Enjoy Commu∣nion with Him, in His Churches, and Publick Ordinances.
