</EPIGRAPH>
<P><HI>SIckness</HI> having for some Time In∣disposed us, it is very seasonable for us, now we are come toge∣ther again, to consider, <HI>What Im∣provement we should make of our late Indisposition?</HI> And the Text now Laid before us, will notably Assist us, to Im∣prove it suitably!</P>
<P>The Great God, by his Holy Prophet
<PB N="6" REF="000829_0006_0FAB4054A80CF5D0"/>
<HI>Isaiah,</HI> does here foretel, the wonderful Salvation of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> from the Invasion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. And here is foretold, a <HI>double Blessing,</HI> which the Inhabitants of the Town, should Enjoy, at the Time of that wonderful Salvation.</P>
<P>First; A <HI>Temporal Blessing,</HI> is promised. <HI>The Inhabitant shall not say, I am sick.</HI> The Town was to suffer such <HI>Hardships,</HI> as use to bring <HI>Sickness</HI> with them. Yea, but saies the Lord,
<Q>I will so <HI>Preserve</HI> and <HI>Restore</HI> the <HI>Health</HI> of the Town, that they shall not complain of <HI>Sickness:</HI> And, particularly, they shall not by <HI>Sickness</HI> be disabled, from Seizing and Sharing the <HI>Prey</HI> of the Defeated Ene∣mies.</Q></P>
<P>Next; A <HI>Spiritual Blessing</HI> is also pro∣mised: <HI>The people which dwell therein, shall be Forgiven their Iniquity.</HI> There was a Blessed <HI>Esaias</HI> among them, to plead the <HI>Great Sacrifice for the Congregation.</HI> Hence, tho' there were much <HI>Iniquity</HI> in the Town, yet God so <HI>Forgave</HI> it, for the sake of the pleaded <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> that He would not inflict on them the Deadly Desolations which their <HI>Iniquity</HI> deserved.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="000829_0007_0FAB40556843F7D8"/>King <HI>Hezekiah</HI> seems to have seen, a very peculiar <HI>Fulfilment</HI> of this <HI>Prophecy.</HI> The Memorable <HI>Sickness</HI> of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> was as 'tis thought, in that very Juncture of Time, when the City was Besieged by the <HI>Assyrians.</HI> But God, in mercy to <HI>all the people who dwelt therein,</HI> did, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a few dayes Heal the <HI>Malignant Squinancy</HI> of this Eminent <HI>Inhabitant.</HI> Yea, (as there had now passed <HI>Fifteen</HI> Jubilees of years from the Conquest of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and there were to be just <HI>Fifteen</HI> Weeks of years from hence to the Captivity in <HI>Babylon,</HI> and as <HI>Hezekiah</HI> himself, was the <HI>Fifteenth</HI> King from the Beginning of the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Mo∣narchy!) <HI>Fifteen Years</HI> were added unto the Dayes of this Great man, after the <HI>Sickness,</HI> which had now been upon him.</P>
<P>We have Two Things that now ly be∣fore our <HI>Observation</HI>; and shall in a Di∣stinct▪ tho' Feeble, manner, discourse, with all Brevity upon them.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>The First Observation.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Forgiveness of Sin</HI> is a Blessed∣ness▪
<PB N="8" REF="000829_0008_0FAB405628EF7630"/>
that may be <HI>Attained,</HI> and should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Desired,</HI> by the Sinful Children of Men.</P>
<P>What the <HI>Angel</HI> said unto the <HI>Shepherds</HI> of <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> is now proper to be spoken unto the <HI>Sinners,</HI> [And, <HI>Ah Lord, Such, even Such we are, every one of us!</HI>] which are here met before the Lord: <HI>Behold, I bring you Good Tidings of Great Joy!</HI> Those <HI>Good Tidings</HI> we have thus Expressed unto us, in Psal. 130.4. <HI>There is Forgiveness with thee, that thou mayst be Feared,</HI> O Lord.</P>
<P>The <HI>Oracles</HI> of God assert this Truth a Thousand times over unto us; And, He has Appointed <HI>Sacraments</HI> to assure us of it. Yea, This most comfortable Truth, is Evident from the <HI>Religion,</HI> wherein God has commanded <HI>Sinners</HI> to <HI>Draw Near</HI> unto Him. 'Twould be to no pur∣pose, for <HI>Sinners</HI> to be Directed and In∣vited as they are, unto the <HI>wayes</HI> of <HI>Com∣munion</HI> with God, if they could not be <HI>Forgiven</HI> their past Rebellion against Him; or, if His <HI>Name</HI> were not, as He hath Himself proclaimed it, <HI>The Lord For∣giving
<PB N="9" REF="000829_0009_0FAB4056EA5DA460"/>
Iniquity, and Transgression, and Sin.</HI></P>
<P>Let this vast matter of <HI>Meditation</HI> and <HI>Consolation,</HI> be with all possible concise∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess, now summarily set before us, in <HI>Three Conclusions.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> In the <HI>Forgiveness of Sin,</HI> the Sinner is not only <HI>Absolved,</HI> from his cursed <HI>Guiltiness,</HI> but also possessed of a perfect <HI>Righteousness,</HI> thro' the <HI>Imputation</HI> of that <HI>Obedience,</HI> which our Lord JESUS CHRIST, as our <HI>Surety,</HI> hath yielded un∣to God, for his <HI>Chosen</HI></P>
<P>Let, first, a few <HI>preparatory Assertions,</HI> make our Thoughts ready to take in a Right Notion of this Illustrious Benefit▪ <HI>The Forgiveness of our Sins.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be Asserted, That we are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Sinners</HI> against the <HI>Law</HI> of God, &amp; have brought horrible Ruines on our selves by our <HI>Sins.</HI> We have this Assertion, in <HI>Ro.</HI> 3.23. <HI>All have sinned, and come short of the Glory of God.</HI> We have by our <HI>Sins,</HI> For∣feited all the <HI>Blessings,</HI> which the <HI>Law</HI> of God promised unto the Keepers of that <HI>Law</HI>; yea, we have by our <HI>Sins</HI> Incur∣red all those <HI>Wants</HI> and <HI>Woes,</HI> &amp; <HI>Plagues,</HI>
<PB REF="000829_0010_0FAB4057E7E0C168"/>
which the Law has denounced unto them that keep it not.</P>
<P>Again; It is to be Asserted, That the <HI>Chosen</HI> of God, cannot be <HI>Rescued,</HI> as He has <HI>purposed,</HI> out of their Horrible Ru∣ines, except the <HI>Law</HI> of God be Answer∣ed. We have this Assertion, in Heb. 1.13. <HI>Thou canst not Look upon Iniquity.</HI> God by His most wise <HI>Law,</HI> hath secured the Interests of His Glory; and He is a <HI>Judge,</HI> that will by no means have the <HI>Equity,</HI> and the <HI>Verity,</HI> of His <HI>Law,</HI> Impeached.</P>
<P>Furthermore; It is to be Asserted, That our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> hath under∣taken to <HI>Answer</HI> the <HI>Law</HI> of God, as a <HI>Surety,</HI> on the Behalf of His <HI>Chosen.</HI> We have this Assertion, in Heb. 7.22. <HI>Jesus was made a Surety.</HI> The <HI>Son</HI> of God, assuming our <HI>Nature,</HI> became a <HI>Mediator</HI>; and by becoming a <HI>man,</HI> He became ca∣pable of being Responsible to the <HI>Law</HI> of God, for us; for which cause, He actually put Himself, into the Capacity of our <HI>Surety,</HI> that by answering the Ex∣actions of the <HI>Law,</HI> in our <HI>Stead,</HI> He might Accomplish the <HI>Atonement</HI> with God, for which He was, as our <HI>High
<PB N="11" REF="000829_0011_0FAB40599A5A3740"/>
Priest</HI> concerned: So that He said, unto His <HI>Father</HI> concerning <HI>Us,</HI> as <HI>Paul,</HI> (no doubt with some sense of <HI>That</HI>!) said unto <HI>Philemon,</HI> about his Run away Ser∣vant, <HI>If he has wrong'd thee, or owes the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a∣ny thing, put that on my Account</HI>!</P>
<P>Moreover; It is to be Asserted, That it was with a <HI>mutual Agreement,</HI> between <HI>God the Father,</HI> and our <HI>Lord Messiah,</HI> that our Lord Jesus Christ became a <HI>Surety,</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nswer the <HI>Law,</HI> for His Chosen. We have this Assertion, in Psal. 89.3, 30, 32. <HI>I have made a Covenant with my Chosen,— If His Children forsake my Law,—Then will I visit their Transgression with the Rod.</HI> God has indeed bound himself by His <HI>Law,</HI> That He will be Acknowledged, either in the <HI>Obedience,</HI> or in the <HI>Destruction,</HI> of His Creatures. But God has not, by His <HI>Law,</HI> so bound Himself, that He may not Admit of a <HI>Surety,</HI> whose <HI>Obedience</HI> may go for <HI>ours.</HI> Tho' the Old <HI>Covenant of Works</HI> do not mention a <HI>Surety,</HI> yet a <HI>Surety</HI> was mentioned, and engaged and ordered, in the Ancient <HI>Covenant of Re∣demption,</HI> whereto <HI>That</HI> was but Subservi∣ent, and wherein <HI>God</HI> is become, <HI>The God of our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="000829_0012_0FAB4059E84F1F50"/>Finally; It is to be Asserted, That our Lord Jesus Christ, ha's according to <HI>Agree∣ment,</HI> answered the <HI>Law</HI> of God, as our <HI>Surety</HI>; both by Enduring the <HI>Penalty</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> whereto we had by our <HI>Sins</HI> Ex∣posed our selves, and by Fulfilling the <HI>Precept</HI> of it, in doing the whole will of God. We have this Assertion, in 1 Joh. 5.6. <HI>Jesus Christ came, not by Water only, but by Water and Blood.</HI> He came, not on∣ly with a <HI>Purity,</HI> and <HI>Sanctity,</HI> conformed, unto the <HI>Law</HI> of God, in all things, but also with <HI>Expiatory Sufferings,</HI> to make A∣mends for our Breaches of the <HI>Law.</HI></P>
<P>Being furnished with these <HI>Preparatory Assertions,</HI> Let us now see, what is done for us in the <HI>Forgiveness of our Sins.</HI></P>
<P>First; In the <HI>Forgiveness of our Sins,</HI> the God of Heaven, does Release us, from the <HI>Guiltiness,</HI> wherein we are bound over, to undergo▪ His Infinite Wrath. The <HI>Law</HI> of God, by a <HI>Just Sentence,</HI> has condem∣ned us to Endure Endless and Easeless <HI>Miseries:</HI> But wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hout any prejudice to the <HI>Law,</HI> God Himself now <HI>Acquits</HI> us from that Condemnation and Obligation. 'Tis said▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Rom. 8.1. <HI>There is now no
<PB N="13" REF="000829_0013_0FAB405AA877E0E8"/>
Condemnation to them which are in Christ, Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, more than so; Secondly; In the <HI>Forgiveness of our Sins,</HI> the God of Hea∣ven does Invest us with a <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which is according to <HI>Law,</HI> the very <HI>Con∣dition</HI> of Happiness; Even a <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which the <HI>Law</HI> has annexed <HI>Life Eternal</HI> as a <HI>Reward</HI> unto: a <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which in all things does come up to the De∣mands of the <HI>Law.</HI> 'Tis therefore said, in 2 Cor. 5.21. <HI>We are made the Righte∣ousness of God.</HI></P>
<P>But, How comes this to pass? Third∣ly; In the <HI>Forgiveness of our Sins,</HI> the God of Heaven, graciously <HI>Imputes</HI> unto us, the <HI>Obedience</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ. There was an <HI>Habitual Rectitude of Nature,</HI> which our Lord Jesus Christ was Born withal; There was a <HI>Course of an Holy Life,</HI> which our Lord Jesus Christ Led for many years together; There was, Lastly, the Exquisite <HI>Pain,</HI> and <HI>Shame,</HI> and <HI>Horror,</HI> of the <HI>Curse</HI> due for Sin, Suffered by our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, God <HI>Imputes</HI> to us, all this <HI>Obedi∣ence</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the <HI>For∣giveness of our Sins</HI>: That is to say; He
<PB N="14" REF="000829_0014_0FAB405B6B5F1E70"/>
looks on it, as belonging unto <HI>Us,</HI> in or∣der to our being Judicially dealt withal, according to the <HI>Merit</HI> of it. Hence, tho' it be our <HI>Duty</HI> still our selves to <HI>Obey</HI> the <HI>Law</HI> of God, and all our coming short thereof, is a <HI>Sin,</HI> for which we are to loath and judge our selves, as worthy of <HI>Death</HI> for ever, yet we now <HI>Stand as with∣out Fault before the Throne of God!</HI> This 'tis to be <HI>Forgiven our Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> By <HI>Faith</HI> in our Lord Jesus Christ▪ and not <HI>Without Faith,</HI> and not <HI>Before Faith,</HI> is that <HI>Blessedness,</HI> the <HI>Forgiveness of Sin,</HI> to be Attained. In our <HI>Bible,</HI> which we may call, <HI>The Justification-Office,</HI> we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every where told, as we are in Rom. 5.1. <HI>We are Justified by Faith.</HI> But, <HI>Faith!</HI> What is <HI>That?</HI> It is to <HI>Receive</HI> the <HI>Forgiveness of Sin,</HI> as the <HI>Gift of God,</HI> by our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and <HI>Rely</HI> upon the Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> for this <HI>Forgiveness.</HI> It is heartily to say, with him, in Phil. 3.9. <HI>I suffer the loss of all things, that I may win Christ, and be found in Him, not having my own Righteousness, which is of the Law, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut that which is thro' the Faith of Christ,
<PB N="15" REF="000829_0015_0FAB405C2800B518"/>
the Righteousness which is of God by Faith</HI>▪ Indeed, <HI>Faith</HI> does not <HI>Justify</HI> us, as it is a <HI>Work</HI>: 'Tis but <HI>Relatively,</HI> and <HI>Instru∣mentally,</HI> that it <HI>Justifies</HI> us. <HI>Faith,</HI> and only <HI>Faith,</HI> has the Honour, to <HI>Justify</HI> us, because it carries us unto our Lord Jesus Christ for our <HI>Justification,</HI> and ascribes unto the Lord Jesus Christ the Honour of it all. 'Tis true, we read, That <HI>Faith is Reckoned unto the Faithful for Righteous∣ness.</HI> One thing in it, may be; That tho' <HI>Faith</HI> be from the <HI>Operation of God</HI> upon us, yet God <HI>reckons</HI> it <HI>unto us, reckons</HI> it <HI>as our own,</HI> accepts it as <HI>our Act</HI>; else it could not bring the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, or any thing else, to be <HI>ours.</HI> But when 'tis said, <HI>Faith is Reck∣oned for Righteousness,</HI> 'tis the Object of our <HI>Faith,</HI> which is thereby intended; e∣ven the <HI>Obedience</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, on which our <HI>Faith</HI> is placed. The Soveraign God, has fixed things in this <HI>Method</HI>; That upon our being Enabled by Him, to <HI>Believe</HI> on our Lord Jesus Christ, our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ Himself</HI> be∣comes <HI>ours,</HI> and so, His <HI>Obedience</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o God, becomes pleadable by us▪ as our <HI>Title,</HI> to
<PB N="16" REF="000829_0016_0FAB405CE8F06860"/>
all the priviledges of the <HI>Righteous</HI> for ever.</P>
<P>Don't Imagine, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Forgiveness of Sin</HI> granted, <HI>Withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> or <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, Believ∣ing</HI> on the Lord Jesus Christ for it. In the <HI>Golden Chain of Salvation,</HI> the Links have this Conne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion: Rom▪ 8 30. <HI>Whom He called▪ them He Justifyed.</HI> Now, <HI>Faith</HI> is given to us, in our <HI>Effectual Calling.</HI> That we are <HI>Actually Justified from Eterni∣ty</HI>; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is but a vain Imagination! As well say, <HI>Sanctified from Eternity,</HI> and <HI>Glorified from Eternity.</HI> Do! go on, and say, That the people of God never were in any <HI>State of Sin</HI> at all! But the <HI>Scrip∣ture of Truth,</HI> will every where confute you, if you say so. What is the State of every man, while yet an <HI>Unbeliever</HI>? Truly, [Joh. 3, 18, 36] <HI>He is condemned, and the Wrath of God abideth on him.</HI> A Rueful State. But how contrary is this, to a State of <HI>Justification,</HI> I beseech you? Does not the Scripture say of <HI>Believers,</HI> That once they were [Eph. 2 3.] <HI>Chil∣dren of Wrath</HI>? Now, I pray, when was This? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was Before they were <HI>Believers.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would ask, Whether every <HI>Justified man</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="000829_0017_0FAB405DA86B2330"/>
does not <HI>please God?</HI> Yea; But I am sur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> [Heb. 11 6.] <HI>Without Faith, it is not pos∣sible to please God.</HI> Then, <HI>Without Faith it is not possible to be a Justified man!</HI> What shall I say? If, <HI>Justified By Faith,</HI> certainly we are not <HI>Justified,</HI> BEFORE <HI>it,</HI> or WITH∣OUT <HI>it.</HI></P>
<P>There was a Time, when this Coun∣trey, was much Infested with <HI>Antinomian</HI> Er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs; but a <HI>Synod</HI> of our Churches then Damned those Errors, with Deciding▪
<Q>That we are not <HI>Married</HI> and <HI>United</HI> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, without <HI>Faith</HI> giving an <HI>Actual Consent</HI> of Soul unto it; and, That Gods <HI>Effectual Cal∣ling</HI> of the Soul unto the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Souls Apprehending by an Act of <HI>Faith,</HI> the offered <HI>Righ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>∣ness</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, is in or∣der of Nature, before Gods Act of <HI>Jus∣tification</HI> upon the Soul.</Q>

<HEAD>The Second Observation.</HEAD>
<P>The Consideration of <HI>Deliverance</HI> from <HI>Sickness,</HI> is particularly to provoke our Diligence in Seeking after such a Blessedness.</P>
<P>Now, there is a CASE, upon which it will be profitable for us, to bestow a few Reflections.</P>
<P>After what manner are we, to Consider the Forgiveness of Sin, in its Relation to a Deliverance from Sickness?</P>
<P>And we will thus Reflect upon it.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> Let us look upon <HI>Sin,</HI> as the <HI>Cause</HI> of <HI>Sickness.</HI> There are, it may be, <HI>Two Thousand Sicknesses</HI>; and indeed, <HI>any one of
<PB N="22" REF="000829_0022_0FAB4111AA6B7388"/>
them, able to Crush us!</HI> But what is the <HI>Cause</HI> of all? Bear in mind, That <HI>Sin</HI> was that which First brought <HI>Sickness</HI> up∣on a Sinful World, and which yet conti∣nues to <HI>Sicken</HI> the World, with a World of Diseases. Our <HI>Sickness</HI> is in short, <HI>Fla∣gellum Dei, Pro Peccatis Mundi.</HI></P>
<P>First. Remember, That the <HI>Sin</HI> of our <HI>First Parents,</HI> was the <HI>First Parent</HI> of all our <HI>Sickness.</HI> All our <HI>Sicknesses,</HI> are but the Execution, of that Primitive Threatening, in Gen. 2.17. <HI>In the Day, that thou sinnest, thou shalt surely Dy,</HI> If <HI>Crudities,</HI> and <HI>Ob∣structions,</HI> and <HI>Malignities,</HI> are the <HI>Parents</HI> of our <HI>Sicknesses,</HI> 'tis very sure, that <HI>Sin</HI> is the <HI>Grand Parent</HI> of them, and the <HI>Sin</HI> of our <HI>First-Parents</HI> is the <HI>First Parent</HI> of them all. We read, in Eccl▪ 9 18. of, <HI>ONE Sin∣ner destroying much Good.</HI> I find, some Jewish <HI>Rabbi's</HI> take our Father <HI>Adam,</HI> to be meant by that <HI>ONE Sinner.</HI> Our <HI>Health</HI> is no small part of the <HI>Good,</HI> which ha's been <HI>Destroy'd</HI> by him. Had our <HI>First Parents</HI> Eaten of the <HI>Tree of Life,</HI> doubtless a confirm'd State of <HI>Perfect Health,</HI> both in Themselves and their Off spring, had been the <HI>Fruit</HI> of it. But our <HI>First Parents</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="000829_0023_0FAB41126A49A730"/>
criminally apply'd themselves to the For∣bidden <HI>Tree of Knowledge</HI>: This proved a <HI>Tree of Death</HI> both to Themselves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Off-spring; and <HI>Sicknesses</HI> are among the <HI>Punishments</HI> of that nefandous Crime. Alas; <HI>Our Father Ate Sowre Grapes, and our Teeth are set on Edge!</HI> When that Ex∣pression is used about our Lord Jesus Christ, [Heb. 2.9.] <HI>He TASTED Death for us</HI>; I make no doubt, that it is an Elegant Allu∣sion, unto the <HI>Way,</HI> whereby <HI>Death</HI> at first came into the World; This was by <HI>Tasting</HI> the <HI>Forbidden Fruit.</HI> As <HI>Death,</HI> so <HI>Sickness,</HI> the Inchoation of <HI>Death,</HI> is but the Bitter Tast of that unhappy Action! Yea, The <HI>Breath</HI> of the <HI>Old Serpent,</HI> whereto Mankind in our First Parents hearkened, has <HI>poisoned</HI> us all. The <HI>poison,</HI> which that <HI>Serpent,</HI> who is, <HI>The Angel of Death,</HI> has insinuated into us, has disturbed our <HI>Health,</HI> as well as depraved our <HI>Heart. Sin, Sin,</HI> was that which opened the Flood Gates for a Flood of <HI>Wretchedness,</HI> to rush in upon the World; and <HI>Sickness</HI> is one Instance of that <HI>Wretchedness. Cursed SIN; I Indict thee, this Day, for Murdering of the World.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="000829_0024_0FAB411329F24800"/>Secondly. Remember, That the <HI>Sin</HI> of every <HI>Individual man,</HI> does but <HI>Repeat</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enew</HI> the <HI>Cause</HI> of <HI>Sickness</HI> unto him. We are informed, in Psal. 107.17. <HI>Fools, because of their Transgression, and because of their Iniquities, are Afflicted,</HI> with Sickness. Indeed <HI>Sin,</HI> sometimes is <HI>Naturally</HI> the cause of <HI>Sickness.</HI> A <HI>Sickness</HI> in the <HI>Spi∣rit,</HI> will <HI>Naturally</HI> cause a <HI>Sickness</HI> in the <HI>Body.

Hence, our <HI>Sicknesses,</HI> are in the New Testament, called by a Name, that hath, <HI>Scourges,</HI> in the Signification of it. [Ponder, at <HI>Liesure,</HI> Exod. 15.26. and Deut. 28.21, 22, 27; 35, 60.61. And say not, as he to whom the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Hap∣piness,</HI> was presented, <HI>I am not at Liesure</HI>!] Ah! <HI>Sin</HI>; How mischievous art thou? A man may say of every <HI>Sin,</HI> when he meets with it, <HI>Have I found thee, O mine Enemy</HI>! The <HI>Soul</HI> and the <HI>Body</HI> constitute <HI>one person</HI>; and the <HI>Body</HI> is unto the <HI>Soul,</HI> the <HI>Instrument</HI> of Iniquity: hence for the <HI>Sins</HI> of the one, there come <HI>Sufferings</HI> on the other. <HI>Syrs,</HI> Be afraid of <HI>Sin:</HI> I tell you, 'Tis a very <HI>Unwholsome Thing.</HI> When you are going to drink the <HI>Stolen Waters</HI> of <HI>Sin: There's Death in the Pot.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="000829_0026_0FAB4114AB6C8FD8"/>Thirdly. Hence under <HI>Sickness,</HI> we should make a solemn Enquiry after <HI>Sin.</HI> A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Disasters,</HI> there was that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> given, in Hag. 1.5, 7. <HI>Consider your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>yes</HI>: 'tis to be heard most sensibly in our <HI>Sicknesses.</HI> There is a <HI>Self-Examinati∣on</HI> incumbent upon <HI>All</HI> men; upon <HI>Sick</HI> men, 'tis peculiarly incumbent. Pray, Let our <HI>Sickness</HI> be it self such an <HI>Emetic</HI> as to make us <HI>Vomit</HI> up our <HI>Sin,</HI> with a penitent <HI>Confession</HI> of it. A Time there was, when <HI>Sacramental Profanations,</HI> were Chastized with <HI>Sicknesses</HI> among the <HI>Co∣rinthians</HI>; They had not come in an or∣derly manner to the <HI>Body</HI> of the Lord, and God Rebuked it, with <HI>Disorders</HI> up∣on Theirs. (Compare 2 Chron. 30 20.) Now, says the Apostle, <HI>Judge your selves.</HI> Indeed, <HI>Sickness</HI> does not always come, to manage a <HI>Controversy</HI> of God with us, for some <HI>Iniquity.</HI> A <HI>Job,</HI> that <HI>Perfect and Upright man,</HI> may have his <HI>Ulcera Syriaca,</HI> [so tragically described by <HI>Aretaeus,</HI> and admirably answering the <HI>Diagnosticks,</HI> which the Sacred Writ has given us of <HI>Jobs</HI> Distemper:] to <HI>Try</HI> his Patience.

<P>Our Excellent <HI>Mitchel,</HI> being but In∣commoded with an <HI>Hoarse Cold,</HI> wrote thus upon it, in his Diary.

<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> Both Under <HI>Sickness,</HI> and After it, we should be more concerned for being Saved from <HI>Sin,</HI> than from <HI>Sickness.</HI> Our <HI>Sins,</HI> what are they, but the Terrible <HI>Sick∣nesses,</HI> under which our <HI>Souls,</HI> are fearfully Languishing and Perishing.

in the Soul. Whenever we have Sin∣ned, we have cause to say, <HI>Lord, HEAL my Soul, for I have Sinned</HI>! Now, <HI>Sickness</HI> is to Awaken our concern, first for the <HI>Pardon</HI> of such Maladies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our Souls, and so for a <HI>Power</HI> against them all.</P>
<P>First; <HI>Under Sickness,</HI> what should be our chief concern? It should be <HI>That,</HI> in Psal 25.18. <HI>Lord, Look upon my Affliction and my Pain, and Forgive all my Sin.</HI> If it be then put unto us, <HI>What lies heaviest now upon you?</HI> Say not, <HI>My Sickness</HI>: but say, <HI>My Sinfulness! That I have done so little Service for my Lord Jesus Christ: That I have mispent so much of my Precious Time: That I have made no more Provi∣sion for Eternity: And, That I am still so Selfish, and Slothful, and Sensual, and Carnal, and Alienated from the Life of God!</HI> And for to Quicken this our concern under our <HI>Sickness,</HI> we are to think, <HI>What will become of us, if we Dy Unpardoned; what will become of us, throughout Eternal Ages?</HI></P>
<P>Next; <HI>After Sickness,</HI> What should be our chief concern? It should be <HI>That,</HI> in Psal. 103.3. <HI>Bless the Lord, O my Soul, who Forgiveth all thine Iniquities, who
<PB N="30" REF="000829_0030_0FAB4117AAA64238"/>
Healeth all thy Diseases.</HI> The <HI>Iniquities</HI> are to be taken away <HI>First,</HI> and <HI>Then</HI> the <HI>Diseases.</HI> Let us not count our <HI>Sickness</HI> well gone, Except our <HI>Sin</HI> be gone too. But let us now put this unto our selves, <HI>Am I now more Assured of my being Pardon∣ed, than I was before? Am I in better Terms with Heaven? Can I see and say, Tis in Love to my Soul, that God ha's brought me back from the Pit of Corruption?</HI> It should now be more of our care, That our <HI>Sickness</HI> be Removed in <HI>Mercy,</HI> than ever it was, That it should be <HI>Removed at all.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, In Fine; To this End, the <HI>Sickness</HI> which <HI>Enfeebles</HI> us, must make us Fly more <HI>Vigorously</HI> than ever, to the <HI>Expiatory Sacrifice</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, for the <HI>Forgiveness of our Sin.</HI> My Brethren, Our <HI>Sickness</HI> is utterly lost upon us, if it render not a CHRIST more <HI>Precious</HI> unto us than ever He was, and instruct us not how to make more <HI>Use</HI> of Him. As the <HI>Sick,</HI> in the Gospels, much cryed out for, <HI>A Christ</HI>! So <HI>Sickness,</HI> is to Teach us, the <HI>Worth</HI> of a <HI>Christ,</HI> and cause us more to see, that without a <HI>Christ,</HI> we are undone
<PB N="31" REF="000829_0031_0FAB411869FE1770"/>
for ever. There is a <HI>Ransome,</HI> which a <HI>Sick man</HI> is to be minded of; that <HI>Ran∣some,</HI> in Job 33.34.— <HI>He is chastened with pain upon his Bed, his Flesh is consumed away, his soul draweth nigh to the Grave, — Then God is gracious to him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the Pit, I have found a Ransome.</HI> Sirs, When we are <HI>Sick,</HI> let us Behold our Lord Jesus Christ, as <HI>Going down into the Pit</HI> for us, and plead that <HI>Ransome</HI> that we may not our selves <HI>Go down.</HI> In the <HI>Directories</HI> for <HI>Visiting the Sick,</HI> used many Ages ago, the <HI>Sick</HI> were directed to say, <HI>Lord, I place the Death of my Saviour Jesus Christ, between Thee and my Sins.</HI> Tis Impossible to say a Better Thing than <HI>That!</HI></P>
<P>Upon <HI>Sickness,</HI> our Addresses must be made unto our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom 'tis said, in Math. 8.17. <HI>Himself Bare our Sicknesses.</HI> Indeed, we cannot say, That there were any proper <HI>Sicknesses,</HI> among the <HI>Sufferings</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ; We do not find, that He was ever properly <HI>Sick.</HI> His <HI>Body</HI> being form∣ed, by a Special Efficacy of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> seems to have been of so Exact a <HI>Temper,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="000829_0032_0FAB411929D653C0"/>
as to be less liable unto <HI>Diseases</HI> than other men.

Creature. But, O Admirable and Amiable matter, and a thing full of Compassionate Goodness! [<HI>Fusus est Sanguis medici, et factum est Medicamen∣tum Phrenetici!</HI>] The <HI>Blood</HI> of the <HI>Phy∣sician</HI> being shed, becomes the <HI>Cure</HI> of the <HI>Patient!</HI></Q></P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> Being <HI>Delivered from Sickness,</HI> Let us not be content without the <HI>Marks</HI> of <HI>Sin Forgiven</HI> upon us. When we no more say, <HI>I am Sick,</HI> Let us make sure of those <HI>Marks,</HI> which will help us with Good As∣surance to say, <HI>I am Forgiven my Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>Now the <HI>Marks,</HI> by which we may discern, that we come out of <HI>Sickness,</HI> with our <HI>Iniquity Forgiven</HI> unto us, will be found in our Answering the <HI>Ends,</HI> for which our <HI>Sickness</HI> came upon us: And our coming out of <HI>Sickness,</HI> as <HI>Gold out of the Fire.</HI> Wherefore, let us thus <HI>Question</HI> our selves.</P>
<P><HI>Quest. I.</HI> After our <HI>Sickness,</HI> do we sin∣cerely set our selves, to <HI>Reform</HI> all our <HI>Sin,</HI> more than ever in our Lives before? It was <HI>wholesome</HI> Advice unto a <HI>Sick-man,</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="000829_0034_0FAB411B6C86CDC0"/>
in Job 34.31. <HI>Surely, It is meet to be said unto God, I have born Chastisement, I will not offend any more.</HI> Truly, one main <HI>Er∣rand</HI> of <HI>Sickness,</HI> is to <HI>Embitter</HI> our <HI>Sin</HI> unto us; the <HI>Language</HI> of it, is, <HI>Thy way, and thy Doings have procured these things un∣to thee, this is thy Sinfulness, because it is Bitter.</HI> As the famous <HI>Olevian,</HI> upon a <HI>Sickness</HI> could say, <HI>Ex hoc morbo didici, quid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> peccatum;</HI> By <HI>Sickness</HI> I have Lear∣ned what <HI>Sin</HI> is! Thus, under our <HI>Sick∣ness,</HI> we have been worse than <HI>Delirious,</HI> if we have not argued at this Rate;
<Q>My <HI>Sin brought this my Sickness upon me</HI>; I may thank my <HI>Sin</HI> for <HI>This</HI>; Now if the <HI>Effect</HI> be so <HI>Bitter,</HI> what is the <HI>Cause</HI>? My <HI>Sins</HI> are worse than all the <HI>pains</HI> of my <HI>Head,</HI> my <HI>Side,</HI> my <HI>Feet</HI>; for my <HI>Sins</HI> brought these my <HI>pains</HI> upon me.</Q>
Well then; Are we grown more <HI>Sick</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> by being Laid on a <HI>Bed of Sickness?</HI> Do we see our <HI>Commissions</HI> of what is <HI>Forbidden,</HI> in the Commands of God, and <HI>Reform</HI> them? Do we see our <HI>Omissions</HI> of what is <HI>Required,</HI> in the Commands of Good, and <HI>Reform</HI> them? If it be not so, Then take, O man, that Awful Warning
<PB N="35" REF="000829_0035_0FAB411B7A981388"/>
of Heaven, <HI>Thou art made whole, Sin no more, Lest a worse Thing do come unto thee.</HI> But if our <HI>Sickness,</HI> have by an Holy <HI>Dia∣phoresis,</HI> carried off our <HI>Sin,</HI> Then we that no longer say, <HI>I am Sick,</HI> are, <HI>Forgiven our Iniquity!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quest. II.</HI> After our <HI>Sickness,</HI> do we more zealously than ever, set our selves to <HI>Glorify</HI> our Lord Jesus Christ? One that had been <HI>Brought Low,</HI> but been <HI>help'd,</HI> thought it R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asonable then to say, in Psal. 116.12. <HI>What shall I Render to the Lord, for all His Benefits towards me?</HI> Let us not come out of <HI>Sickness,</HI> without such an Ingenuous, <HI>Quid Retribuam?</HI> We owe our <HI>Lives</HI> unto our Lord Jesus Christ; Are we now more studious, <HI>How to Live unto Him?</HI> Being Rescued from <HI>Sickness,</HI> do we study to be more <HI>Fruitful</HI> in our whole <HI>Conversation,</HI> That our Lord Jesus Christ may be more Acknowledged, by every part of our <HI>Good Conversation in Him?</HI> And, Do we Study to be more <HI>Useful</HI> in every <HI>Capa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity,</HI> That in every <HI>Relation,</HI> which we sustain, we may do <HI>more Good</HI> than ever we did? Yea, Do we Study now, to do some <HI>Special Thing</HI> for the
<PB N="36" REF="000829_0036_0FAB411C2A52F218"/>
Name of our Lord Jesus Christ? Of old, They that were Cured of any <HI>Sickness,</HI> were bound for to pay a price, which they called, a ΣΩΣTPON, unto their <HI>Healer.</HI> It is our Lord Jesus Christ, that hath been, <HI>The Lord our Healer.</HI> Do we gratefully think, <HI>What special Thing shall I now do, for the Honour of my Healer</HI>? Then, we that no longer say, <HI>I am Sick,</HI> are, <HI>For∣given our Iniquity!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quest. III.</HI> After our <HI>Sickness,</HI> are we more <HI>Sick</HI> of this <HI>vain World,</HI> than ever we were, since we c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me into the <HI>World</HI>? Of the <HI>Sick,</HI> 'tis said, in Psal. 107.18. <HI>Their Soul abhors all manner of meat,</HI> when they <HI>draw near unto the Gates of Death.</HI> Has our <HI>Sickness</HI> made us to <HI>Abhor,</HI> or to <HI>Despise,</HI> those Gratifications of our <HI>Flesh,</HI> which once were as the <HI>chief Good,</HI> unto us? As <HI>Esau</HI> said, when he was <HI>Faint, Behold, I am at the point of Death, and what Good will this Birthright do unto me</HI>? Thus, has the <HI>Faintness</HI> of <HI>Sickness,</HI> brought us to say, <HI>Behold, I shall Dy shortly, and what Good is there in all the Pleasures, and all the Riches, and all the Honours of this Deceitful World?</HI> And are these Dispositions conti∣nued
<PB N="37" REF="000829_0037_0FAB411CEA4C8590"/>
and confirmed in us, after we com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out of <HI>Sickness?</HI> We are too ready, to account this <HI>present Evil World</HI> our Home, and promise our selves Long <HI>Rest</HI> and <HI>Peace,</HI> and much <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in <HI>this World.</HI> But, <HI>This our way is our Folly!</HI> And a Fault it is, that our God will never En∣dure in those, for whom He hath <HI>Reserv∣ed an Inheritance in Heaven, Uncorrupted and Undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</HI> Now, upon our <HI>Sickness</HI> is this <HI>present World,</HI> made so <HI>Evil</HI> unto us, that we are even <HI>Sick</HI> of being here; and has it fill'd us with such Thoughts as these:</P>
<P><Q>My Lord Jesus Christ, hath <HI>bought</HI> for us, a <HI>better World</HI> than <HI>This.</HI> Wherefore, <HI>Awake,</HI> O my Soul, <HI>Awake!</HI> Rouse up▪ <HI>Dream</HI> not of Abiding in such an <HI>Evil World</HI> as <HI>This</HI>: But, <HI>Set thy Affections up∣on the Things that are above!</HI></Q></P>
<P>Then, We that no Longer say, <HI>I am Sick,</HI> are, <HI>Forgiven our Iniquity!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quest. IV.</HI> After we have been <HI>made Low,</HI> by <HI>Sickness,</HI> are we more <HI>Lowly,</HI> and Humble in our <HI>Spirit,</HI> than ever hereto∣fore? <HI>Morbi Corporis ad Inhibendam Animi superbiam, sunt Accommodatissimi.</HI> We are
<PB N="38" REF="000829_0038_0FAB411DAA233758"/>
never fit, for either <HI>Comfort</HI> or <HI>Service,</HI> but when Lying very <HI>Low,</HI> before the Lord. Now, we are <HI>brought Low</HI> by <HI>Sickness,</HI> that so we may Lay our selves <HI>Low.</HI> Is this the Issue of it! When <HI>Sickness</HI> has been Threatning to Lay us in the <HI>Dust,</HI> has it caus'd us, to Lay our selves there, and made us with Humility to say, with <HI>Job,</HI> after he had been <HI>Sick, Now I abhor my self as in Dust and Ashes? Luther</HI> noted it, That when he had any <HI>special piece of work</HI> to do for the Church of God, some Fit of <HI>Sickness</HI> usually came to <HI>Humble</HI> him, and <HI>prepare</HI> him for it. This, This was the occasion of the <HI>Thorn in the Flesh,</HI> with which that Great Ser∣vant of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> was Exercised. [2 Cor. 12.7.] There has been much Asking, What was the Apostles <HI>Thorn in the Flesh?</HI> There have been some Expositions given of it, which carry in them, an unjust Affront unto that Heavenly and Laborious Man of God. Whereas, there is nothing so probable, as a Fit of <HI>Sickness,</HI> to be in∣tended in it. I will not be positive, with <HI>Austin,</HI> and <HI>Jerom,</HI> That it was a grievous
<PB N="39" REF="000829_0039_0FAB411E6AD604C8"/>
<HI>Head ache</HI>; or, with <HI>Tertullian,</HI> That it was a <HI>pain</HI> from a Cold, in one side of his <HI>Head</HI>; or with <HI>Aquinas,</HI> That it was the <HI>Ilia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Passion:</HI> or with some others, That it was the <HI>Ephialtes,</HI> or the <HI>Vertigo,</HI> or the <HI>Gout.</HI> Nevertheless, it seems most probably, to be some sore <HI>Sickness</HI> upon his <HI>Body,</HI> that was the Apostles, <HI>Thorn in the Flesh.</HI> He pray'd, That he might be set at Liberty from that <HI>Sickness</HI>; but God would not wholly set him at Liber∣ty, God would Employ a <HI>Sickly man,</HI> in the work of the Gospel, and neither his <HI>Labour,</HI> nor <HI>Success</HI> therein should be hin∣dred, by his being so <HI>Sickly</HI>: but his be∣ing <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kly,</HI> made him so <HI>Humble,</HI> as to <HI>Fit</HI> him for his Work exceedingly. Let a man be never so Eminent an Instrument, for the Glory of the Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Sickness</HI> will cause him to contemn all the Applause of his Admirers, and it will cause him to Ascribe unto the Lord Jesus Christ, the whole Glory of all that shall be done by him. To make this, the more Efficacious, a Minister of a <HI>Pauline Soul,</HI> must have, <HI>A Messenger of Satan to buffet him,</HI> with his <HI>Thorn in the Flesh.</HI> I
<PB N="40" REF="000829_0040_0FAB411F2B8674C0"/>
suspect, that the Apostle, in <HI>that,</HI> may allude unto the Story of <HI>Micajah.</HI> That Minister of God, had a <HI>Rapture into Hea∣ven,</HI> where he had a Vision of wonder∣ful Things. After this <HI>Abundance of Re∣velations,</HI> he was <HI>Buffeted</HI> by a <HI>Messenger of Satan</HI>; A <HI>Zedekiah,</HI> a man full of <HI>Sa∣tan,</HI> then <HI>Smote him on the Cheek.</HI> Thus, <HI>Quaere,</HI> Whether, the <HI>Messenger of Satan,</HI> accompanying the <HI>Thorn in the Flesh,</HI> unto this Minister of God, may not be a <HI>Wicked</HI> man, whom <HI>Satan</HI> had permission to Possess and Inspire, for the Reproach∣ing of that Faithful Preacher of Christ? I Leave it.</P>
<P>And I only say; Has our <HI>Sickness</HI> made us more Apprehensive of our <HI>Mean∣ness</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>?

the <HI>Sickness,</HI> which was bringing us to <HI>Nothing?</HI> Then, We that no longer say, <HI>I am Sick,</HI> are, <HI>Forgiven our Iniquity</HI>!</P>
<P>Yes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Be of Good Cheer, Thy Sins are Forgiven thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quest. V.</HI> Hath God made us careful to ascribe the whole <HI>Honour</HI> of our <HI>De∣liverance from Sickness,</HI> unto our Lord Je∣sus Christ alone? It is the property of a man that has had <HI>many Sins Forgiven</HI> him, to <HI>Love much</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ, through whom it is that we receive our <HI>Forgiveness</HI>: But <HI>much Love</HI> to our Lord Jesus Christ, will teach us to set upon His Head alone, the <HI>Crown,</HI> as of every other Enjoyment, so of that <HI>Cure,</HI> wherein any <HI>Sickness</HI> has been relieved. It is to be hoped, That <HI>Before</HI> we had our <HI>Cure,</HI> we plac'd our <HI>Hope</HI> on our Lord Jesus Christ alone, for our <HI>Help.</HI> It was a great over∣sight of King <HI>As<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> when Sick, in 2 Chron. 16.12. <HI>In his Disease, he sought not unto the Lord, but unto the Physicians.</HI> It ha's been Conjectured, that some of <HI>Asa's</HI> Ancestors had been <HI>Medically</HI> disposed, and Students in the <HI>Art of Healing.</HI> From hence they might have their <HI>Name</HI>; for <HI>Asa,</HI> is the
<PB N="42" REF="000829_0042_0FAB4120AA196F70"/>
Chaldee word for a <HI>Physician.</HI> Possibly for this Cause, this King had the higher Esteem for those who were skill'd in <HI>Medicine,</HI> and put such Confidence in them, as to neglect, <HI>The Lord,</HI> the Author and Giver of Health. Be this, how it will; 'tis to be hoped, that, though we have been found in the use of <HI>Means</HI> for our Health, and prudently made use of the <HI>Physician,</HI> as an <HI>Ordinance of God,</HI> yet we have not Relyed upon these <HI>Means,</HI> but upon the Lord Jesus Christ alone, who is the <HI>Health of our Countenance, and our God.</HI></P>
<P>And now, <HI>After</HI> we have our <HI>Cure,</HI> Don't we <HI>Forget</HI> the Hand that hath <HI>Healed our Diseases</HI>? Are we not like the Nine <HI>Lepers,</HI> who being brought out of their <HI>Sickness,</HI> by the Lord Jesus Christ, went away without ever taking any more Notice of Him? and so, without being <HI>Forgiven</HI> their <HI>Iniquitie</HI>! Or, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we come out of our <HI>Sickness,</HI> instead of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing <HI>Forgiven</HI> our <HI>Iniquity,</HI> as a <HI>Dog</HI> Scrambling out of the <HI>Water</HI> which he has been thrown into, Shaking himself a little, and running away, as much a <HI>Dog</HI> still as ever?</P>
<P>Sirs, If we come <HI>Forgiven,</HI> out of a
<PB N="43" REF="000829_0043_0FAB41219F87C700"/>
<HI>Sickness,</HI> we shall be mindful of the <HI>Ex∣periences,</HI> which we have had, of the Di∣vine Benignity towards us in it. It may be, there ha's been some Remarkable <HI>Answer of Prayer,</HI> in our Deliverance: It may not be Forgotten. Truly, I cannot without some Delight read one passage, in the <HI>Great Austin,</HI> upon the occasion of a Malady, so common, that People Scarce count <HI>Prayer</HI> to have any concernment about it. His words, (in his, <HI>Confessions</HI>) are these.</P>
<P><Q>Lord, Thou didst Afflict me, with <HI>Pain of the Teeth</HI>; and when it was so great, that I could not speak, it came into my mind, to admonish my Friends present to Pray for me, unto the <HI>God of all Health.</HI> Writing this on <HI>Wax,</HI> I gave it 'em to Read; and as soon as we kneeled down, the pain went away. I was amazed, I confess, my Lord, my God; for I had never found any thing like it, in all my Life.</Q></P>
<P>All that I have now to say, is;</P>
<P>Ha's God given us, an Heart, for to Acknowledge the <HI>Merit</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, as <HI>Purchasing</HI> our Deliverance from
<PB N="44" REF="000829_0044_0FAB41230C7C7110"/>
<HI>Sickness</HI>? It is said, in 1 Pet. 2.24. <HI>By His Stripes ye were Healed.</HI> All we have been like <HI>Run away Servants,</HI> [and the Apostle is there discoursing to <HI>Servants</HI>▪] and we deserve <HI>Stripes</HI> for our thus Run∣ning away from the <HI>Service</HI> of God. In <HI>Sickness</HI> there are some of our Deserved <HI>Stripes</HI> laid upon us; but when we come out of <HI>Sickness,</HI> do we, with a Thankful Soul make this Acknowledgment; <HI>My Lord Jesus Christ, ha's felt the Stripes that were due to me, and thus tis, that I am Healed!</HI></P>
<P>And ha's God given us an Heart, for to Acknowledge the <HI>Power</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, as <HI>Bestowing</HI> our Deliverance from <HI>Sickness</HI>? It was said in Mal. 4.2. <HI>To you that Fear my Name, shall the Sun of Righteousness arise, with Healing in His Wings.</HI> In the Eastern parts of the World, it ha's been a Custome among the poor Pagans there, That when they have Ineffectually Tryed all ordinary wayes, for the Succour of their <HI>Sick Folks,</HI> they would Expose them abroad unto the <HI>Sun,</HI> Expecting that the Beams of the <HI>Sun,</HI> would perform for them, what could be no other wayes ob∣tained.
<PB N="45" REF="000829_0045_0FAB4123AA9E6A68"/>
Yea, but instead of this, do's our Soul, now make this Thankful Acknow∣ment; <HI>Nothing would Save me out of my Sickness, until that Sun of Righteousness, my Lord Jesus Christ, arose upon me, with Heal∣ing in His Wings!</HI> Truly, These Disposi∣tions in us will argue, that when we no longer say, <HI>I am Sick,</HI> we are also <HI>Forgiven our Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>And if this be our Case, how happily are we <HI>Prepared,</HI> for the <HI>Next Sickness</HI> that shall <HI>Visit</HI> us? Perhaps, it will not be long, before another <HI>Sickness</HI> be upon us; but being <HI>Forgiven our Iniquity,</HI> We may Refresh our selves, with such Thoughts, as I find the famous Mr. <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tton,</HI> before ever he stood in the Pulpit, of the Church, where I now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

<Q>of your Fainting Fits, and Wearisome▪ Nights, are weighed, and limited by His Hand, who hath given you the Lord Jesus Christ, to <HI>take upon Him your Infirmities, and bear your Sicknesses.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And then, my Brethren, if our <HI>Sickness</HI> come upon us, while we have yet <HI>Youth</HI> or <HI>Strength</HI> enough in our years, to do any more work for our Lord Jesus Christ, we may sweetly Express that Lovely <HI>Contradiction</HI> in <HI>Christianity; Vitam habere in patientia, mortem in Desiderio</HI>: To say, on the one side, <HI>I know that the Hour of my Departure, will be the best Hour that e∣ver I saw: when I Depart, I shall be with Christ, which is by far the best of all: I shall be then Lodg'd among the Angels of God; and I Long to be so! I Long for it, with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory!</HI> To say, at the same Time, on the other side, <HI>Yet for all this, I ask to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that I may Serve Him who is my Lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ I am heartily, most heartily willing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stay among the Bit∣ter Temptations of this Evil World, that I may Serve the dear Name of my Lord Jesus Christ, in a World, where I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a∣gainst</HI>
