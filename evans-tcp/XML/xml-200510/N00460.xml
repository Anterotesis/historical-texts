<P>WE live in a dying World. Our dear∣est Friends and most precious Rela∣tions are ever and anon bidding us a sorrowful farewel. To sanctifie God in a duly moderated Mourning at such a time, is a great but difficult Duty. God is most dishonoured by our admit∣ting our passions to carry us beyond bounds; and a Christian never more needs relief, than on such occasions, when Nature influenced by cor∣ruption carries him into unbecoming transports of ungoverned Affections. God hath therefore, in his word, provided excellent Cordials to revive the Spirits of his Children, and keep them from fainting under these trials. One of them, and none of the least, is presented you in the follow∣ing Discourse. These Sermons were Preached in a time when Death rode in Triumph among us; when many were carried dayly <HI>to their long home, and Mourners went thick about our streets;</HI> and they were not, through Gods bles∣sing, without their desired effect. And since there will be frequent occasions for you to make use of this <HI>Receipt,</HI> as long as you converse with Mortality, it hath been desired to be expo∣sed

<P>MAN, who in his Creation was made of dissoluble Principles, is by his Apostasy subjected to that Dissolu∣tion, which, had he retained his Integrity, should never have actually siezed upon him: whereas now the whole race of fallen men are daily exposed to be made a prey to De∣vouring Death, which comes armed against them in a thousand shapes; and without fa∣vour or respect to persons, snatcheth them a∣way from among the living: sometimes it comes on foot, taking here one and there a∣nother, in an easy progress; as in times of health and peace: other whiles it comes on. Horseback, <HI>Jehu</HI>-like, driving furiously, hur∣rying men away by Shoals to the <HI>Land of Darkness:</HI> In which it dissolves the most sa∣cred Ties, and makes a separation between the nearest Relations, which occasions Mankind's

being so often put into mourning. Now, as Nature prompts men to mourn over their Deceased Friends, and we may as well root out the Affections planted in Humanity, as to deny them the liberty of venting them∣selves when there is an occasion offered; so the Christian Religion giveth us Rules for the due bounding, and right regulating of these passions, and it is a point of Christian Wisdom to be well instructed therein at all times, much more when the Providence of God orders it to be a time wherein the Sword abroad, and mortal sickness at home, are so often calling us to the exercise thereof: and he that is acquainted with the extravagant exorbitancy of his own Affections, will see a∣bundant reason to take pains in learning of this Lesson. No man in his right mind can be so fond of sorrow, as not to be willing to have some lenitives applied to it, for the ca∣sing of the grief of it. <HI>Heathen Morality</HI> hath laid it self out very much upon this Subject; but alas! the best dose that ever that could provide for men, was nothing but a few <HI>Narcoticks,</HI> to stupify, and not in the least to cure that Malady. He that would be well provided for his relief in this case, must consult <HI>Paul</HI> and not <HI>Seneca</HI>; the Word of God, and not Pagan Philosophy, and here is one excellent <HI>Receipt</HI> prepared to our hand in the Text and Context.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="000583_0006_0FA712C8E94815B0"/>This <HI>Chapter</HI> belongs to the <HI>hortatory</HI> part of the Epistle; and from this <HI>verse</HI> to the end of the <HI>Chapter,</HI> he gives precious and profitable advice to the people of God about their <HI>mourning</HI> over their Deceased Friends: The advice it self is given in the <HI>Text,</HI> the arguments to strengthen it, and render it profitable to them, is in the following <HI>verses.</HI> The advice it self is, not to mourn despair∣ingly over them▪ the reasons why they should not so do are three; taken from the conside∣ration of the glorious Resurrection they shall ere long arrive at, the happy meeting which they shall then have with the Lord Jesus Christ, and their being thenceforth made to live with him for ever in glory; and one would think this were enough to set men down compleatly satisfied, could they embrace all this with Faith.</P>
<P>In the words then we may take notice of,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Subject to whom the advice is gi∣ven, <HI>Brethren</HI>; he applies it to such as were by profession Christians, and in the judgment of Charity, true believers. This Cordial is only provided for such, and if any other shall take it, it may prove to be poyson un∣to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Subject concerning whom this ad∣vice is given; <HI>Them which are asleep</HI>: sleeping is an expression which the Spirit of God makes frequent use of in the Scripture to express
<PB N="4" REF="000583_0007_0FA712CB05EABD70"/>
dying by; and it is for the most part applied to the death of the Godly, thereby to take away the formidableness of it, and make it more welcome to us; he therefore intends such as are dead in Christ, or those whom we are well perswaded of, that they had a title to him by a living faith: such, of whose death we have encouragement to believe that it is but a sweet sleep.</P>
<P N="3">3. The subject matter about which the advice is given, <HI>viz. Sorrow:</HI> It refers to the Affection of <HI>grief,</HI> which is apt to break forth into, and vent it self in bitter mourn∣ing upon such sad and solemn occasions as these.</P>
<P N="4">4. The advice it self which he gives in this case, wherein he doth not forbid all sor∣row, but only regulates it. The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> was no <HI>Stoick</HI>; the Spirit of God never advised men to <HI>Apathy</HI>: there is danger in <HI>despising</HI> as well as in <HI>fainting under</HI> affliction, and therefore they are both cautioned against <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.9 and there is a double limitation here set to it; or rather a limitation with an explication.</P>
<P N="1">1. The limitation it self is, <HI>as do others: Gr. as the rest, or residue</HI>; i. e. of mankind: by these he intends such as are not Christi∣ans, nor have been instructed in the Doctrines of the true Religion: and the comparison may be referred either to the <HI>Heathenish
<PB N="5" REF="000583_0008_0FA712CCA9163BF8"/>
modes</HI> used by them in their mourning, or else to the <HI>degrees of sorrow</HI> which they were wont to express in it.</P>
<P N="2">2. The other limitation or explication of the former, is, in these words; <HI>which have no Hope. Hope</HI> is an Affection very service∣able for the alleviating of sorrow, and where that is not active, g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ief will grow up to despair.</P>
<P N="3">3. Here is also one general help offered a∣gainst this irregular and unbounded mourn∣ing, <HI>viz. Knowledge: I would not have you to be ignorant.</HI> Implying that it was Gentile ignorance, which made them so to mourn; the knowledge and the thorough perswasion of sound Principles will help to fortifie us against the imitation of them.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="000583_0009_0FA712CCBA1026A8"/>
it may be taken up in several Propositions, which may serve for the explication and confirmation of it to us.</HI></P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION I. That Gods People have consolations which others are strangers unto.</HEAD>
<P><HI>God hath provided those comforts for his Children, which he hath not made common to the World: they have their</HI> Joys <HI>which a</HI> stranger <HI>may not meddle with without presumption, be∣cause he hath nothing to do with them. The Apostle, applying of himself to his</HI> Thessaloni∣ans, <HI>makes a plain difference between them, and others who did not believe: he leaves wicked men to sorrow without hope if they will, yea and he reckons that they have reason enough so to do; but he wholly disallows it in the Children of God, as a thing that is altogether unreasonable, and that must be because they have something pe∣culiar to support their spirits withal, or else what should make the difference? The world indeed make high pretences to their comforts, but they are of another stamp and character than those that belong to the people of God, and no way comparable with them: and we may observe these four differences between them.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Those are but <HI>seeming</HI> comforts, where∣as
<PB N="7" REF="000583_0010_0FA712CE4EED9050"/>
these are <HI>real.</HI> They are but the shadow▪ these are the substance of Consolation. Of the worlds comforts, we have the Wis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mans observation upon them, <HI>Prov.</HI> 13.14. <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en in Laughter the heart is sorrowful</HI>; they think they have some refreshments, but indeed they have none. But the comforts of Gods Children are realities: they are therefore said <HI>to inhe∣rit substance</HI>: there are true setled refresh∣ments in the <HI>Joys of the Holy Ghost,</HI> which these partake in: there is neither delusion nor deceit in them.</P>
<P N="2">2. They are of <HI>mens</HI> own <HI>making,</HI> but these are of <HI>Gods providing.</HI> Ungodly men arrogate them to themselves they snatch at, and take them without any leave, or title to them; <HI>they walk in the light of their own fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and by the sparks which they have kindled, Isai.</HI> 50.11. But the Children of God have theirs given to them, <HI>it is God that comforts them in all their afflictions,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.3, 4. He hath made this Consolation for them in the pro∣mise, and he applies it unto them by his Ho∣ly Spirit, who imprints it upon their hearts indelebly, and makes them to tast the sweet∣ness and satisfaction there is in it. And Hence,</P>
<P N="3">3. Those are <HI>groundless,</HI> but these are <HI>grounded.</HI> The ungodly man <HI>builds without a foundation,</HI> whereas Gods Children are <HI>built upon the Rock.</HI> Sinners are under a curse,
<PB N="8" REF="000583_0011_0FA712CEE94F8408"/>
and <HI>there is no peace unto them,</HI> if God may be believed, for he hath said it, <HI>Isa.</HI> 57.1. and where there is no peace, how can there be any solid comfort? If they enjoy any favour Providentially, yet they have no security of it, being exposed to lose it every day, yea every moment; and while they have it, it is attended with a fearful curse: But the people of God have the assurance or security of theirs given to them. It is called <HI>strong Consolation, Heb▪</HI> 6.18. not only in regard of its prevalency over the greatest Tempta∣tions of afflictions, but also as it is well laid and immoveable. It hath its strength in the Everlasting Covenant, secured by the im∣mutability and fidelity of God; and eviden∣ced by those things that are wrought in them, which accompany salvation, attested by the Spirit of God in them, so bearing witness unto their Sonship.</P>
<P N="4">4. Those are but <HI>during this life</HI> at the far∣thest reach, but the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e are both <HI>in and</HI> after Death. Our Saviour Christ, speaking of wicked men, saith that <HI>they have their conso∣lation, Luk.</HI> 6.24. <HI>i. e.</HI> they have already as much as ever they are like to have. Their personal comforts will reach no farther than so, <HI>Psal.</HI> 49.17. <HI>for when he dies, he shall carry nothing away.</HI> Their relative comforts do now also cease: whilst they live with them, they solace themselves in them, and
<PB N="9" REF="000583_0012_0FA712CFB0CDC258"/>
make merry, but when they dye, they have now no more comfort of them: whereas the Children of God have their consolations ly∣ing beyond death, this <HI>moth</HI> cannot eat them out, this <HI>thief</HI> cannot rob them of them: their joy for themselves is, that <HI>their Names are written in heaven</HI>; their solace in their relations, when they are dead, is, That they are gone to Christ.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="application">
<HEAD>VSE I.</HEAD>
<P>Hence then, how little cause have the world to scorn Gods people, or they to envy ungodly men? these do both herein appear to act preposterously, and altogether unwar∣rantably. Let scornful men flout as long as they will at the children of God, because they comfort themselves in the Word and Promise, and settle themselves on an Hope which they derive from thence: it will be found one day that they had no cause so to do. Let them boast and brag of their grea∣ter and better comforts, they will shortly know themselves to have been grosly mista∣ken. Let them look never so well of it to an eye of carnal reason, and seem to be the only darlings of Providence; yet Gods Children have no just cause to malign them upon this account, or to <HI>fret</HI> and be <HI>disquiet∣ed</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="000583_0013_0FA712D0A17867B8"/>
by reason of it; for God hath provided <HI>better things</HI> for them which the others have nothing to do withal, nor shall ever be made the partakers of: when at any time you are assaulted with this Temptation, and it is like to be too hard for you, then read and ponder well upon these two precious portions of the Word of God in, <HI>Psal.</HI> 37▪ and 73.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="application">
<HEAD>VSE II.</HEAD>
<P>Let this warn every one to beware how they apply to themselves the consolations of the Word of God. There are some whom they do belong unto, but they are not all who may make this claim: there are terrors there also, which are the portion of many: and it is not a little perilous in this case, for men to arrogate to themselves that which is not their own: when God is about to speak comfort to his people, he then saith unto ungodly men, hands off; he would have them to stand by and hear, but not to presume: if their hearing of them pronoun∣ced upon his people, may awaken them to see their own misery in being without them, and excite them to diligence in seeking after an interest in them according to the Gospel directions; this is proper, and will be pro∣fitable; but if they take them as spoken to
<PB N="11" REF="000583_0014_0FA712D139F38E58"/>
them, run away with them, and never re∣gard what it is that can only give a title to them, this will prove a woful delusion; and there are none that perish more fearfully than these do: Our business, when we hear of these things, is to enquire seriously, what manner of persons are they to whom they belong? and then to reflect and ask, am I one of these? if indeed we are, we may then safely live upon them, they are our portion; but if it be otherwise, they will not prove Cordials, but poysons to us. It is as dange∣rous to take comforts un-given as to refuse them when they are offered.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="application">
<HEAD>VSE III.</HEAD>
<P>Hence then what a shame is it that Gods Children should sink under troubles like o∣ther men? How much more then that they are not able to bear up so quietly under them as others can? that a shadow shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d seem to do more than the substance? It must needs be here granted, or else we shall do in∣justice to good men, that there is a vast dif∣ference between the contempt of afflictions, which the men of the world make such a flourish withal, and the humble sense and patient submission of the children of God, which makes less shew and noise: but still
<PB N="12" REF="000583_0015_0FA712D388292068"/>
there is a decorum to be observed by us; and <HI>if we faint in the day of adversity,</HI> who have such a cordial to support and refresh our spirits withal, it saith that we are not in the right exercise of Faith. Let them despond who have nothing to trust to, but let not those sink in their spirits at any thing who have Gods comforts to support them: know it therefore that there is one in the Word of God which is suted to every condi∣tion that you can be in; and it is strong e∣nough to do the thing it is prepared for, if you would but take it.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION II. That Grace doth not secure any against Dying▪ <HI>or,</HI> Gods Children must dye as well as other men.</HEAD>
<P>A bodily death is the common lot of all sorts of men, and Piety is no more a Bail a∣gainst it than wealth or honour, or pleasures. Our Apostle doth not here go about to en∣courage his <HI>Thessalonians</HI> by telling them that they shall not lose their godly friends by death, no, but he endeavours to give them relief against oppressing sorrow in case they do lose them, presuming it to be a thing which they are daily to expect. The truth
<PB N="13" REF="000583_0016_0FA712D49C00F5E8"/>
of this, in <HI>Thesi,</HI> is confirmed unto us by daily observation, we see the best, the most holy, the most desirable to be going off the stage from time to time: all men may make that observation, <HI>Psal.</HI> 49.10. <HI>He sees that Wisemen dye</HI>: when therefore Christ promi∣seth that some, <HI>viz.</HI> such as had believed on him, should never die, it is not meant of a bodily but of a spiritual Death. Nor do some extraordinary instances of those that were translated that they should not see Death, as <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Elias,</HI> invalidate the the generl Truth of this assertion, being only special exceptions from the rule. But that which calls for our observation and en∣quiry here, is, why Gods Children who are united to Jesus Christ, whose sins are par∣doned, and from whom the Curse is remov∣ed, must yet die as well as other men, upon whom the curse of Death lies in its weight? and we may take a summary account of it in the following <HI>Conclusions.</HI> For although there is enough to stop our mouths, and silence our cavillings, to consider that Infinite Wisdom hath seen meet in soveraign pleasure so to determine it: yet this Wisdom hath its rea∣sons, and if we know them not all, yet it hath told us sufficient not only to silence, but to satisfie us too: here then let us observe.</P>
<P N="1">1. That Death at first came into the world as a curse of sin. It was not a condition of
<PB N="14" REF="000583_0017_0FA712D51B4E3C00"/>
mans nature, (as some do falsly suppose, and frivolously plead) but a consequent up∣on the great Transgression, and a moral ef∣fect of it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12. <HI>By one man sin came into the world, and death by sin.</HI> God had laid a restraint upon Mortality in mans Creation, but he took it off again upon mans Apostasy, and left him to be a prey in the hands of it. If mankind had never sinned, he had never died. It is therefore a <HI>curse</HI> in its first intro∣duction into the world, being in it self an evil which mans nature is grievously averse unto, and being brought in as a penalty up∣on the creature, and therein a clear disco∣very of Gods righteous Displeasure at man: the Apostle therefore makes that an argu∣ment undeniably to prove that <HI>Sin was in the world from Adam to Moses,</HI> because <HI>men died</HI> all that while, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.13, 14.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the whole Curse of the first Co∣venant is taken off from a man in his Justi∣fication. It is of the very nature of this benefit, that it removeth the Curse from that person to whom it is applied. The nature or essence of the Curse consists in that sen∣tence of Condemnation which is past upon the sinner: now in Justification that very sentence is taken off from the man, and there is no more of it lying out against him, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.1. <HI>There is now no condemnation to them that are in Christ.</HI> The forgiveness of sins
<PB N="15" REF="000583_0018_0FA712D6C8169268"/>
is contained in it, and where sin is forgiven, the punishment of it is removed; such there∣fore are said <HI>to be past from death to life.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Hence the believers Death is spoiled of it's <HI>sting.</HI> It ceaseth to be unto them a cur∣sed Death. God can suffer Death it self to continue, and yet take the malediction out of it: he doth so by all the other afflictions which befal his people in this life, in that he cau∣seth them all <HI>to work together for their good, Rom.</HI> 8.28. and he doth so by Death it self too, for what saith <HI>Paul, Phil.</HI> 1.21. <HI>to dy is gain.</HI> When the poyson is taken out of it, it becomes an innocent and a serviceable thing, as will be seen afterward: and thus it is to all Gods people, so that <HI>Paul</HI> could make that challenge in behalf of all the regenerate, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.45. <HI>O Death where is thy sting</HI>? he doth not say where is Death? but where is its sting? and this is the very thing which makes a Child of God not to be afraid to dy.</P>
<P N="4">4. Yet there are many reasons why God sees it convenient that believers should die, and some of them are these following.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is fitting that they should tast something of the fruit of sin. Though this be not in the way of a curse, yet they must have some experiment of it in the way of Providence: The Apostle tells us, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.10 <HI>The b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy is dead because of sin.</HI> One thing designed in this expression is, that because
<PB N="16" REF="000583_0019_0FA712D72B06FBF0"/>
Gods people were once sinners, therefore God will have them to tast of a bodily death. This becomes to them a witness that once they were Transgressors, and serves to keep them humble under all the grace they have received, and the sense of Gods love in Christ, which they enjoy, to think that they still must die. It is true, if there were nothing else of advantage to them by dying but only this, God would not have thus continued it to them: but still, this is a Remembrancer to them as long as they live; and it is one profitable use of it to them, <HI>to bring sin to remembrance.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Death is sometimes a fatherly correcti∣on which God inflicts upon his Children. There must be acknowledged a vast difference between a curse and a chastisement: the matter of the one and the other may be the same, but the design which denominates them, is vastly divers. A <HI>curse</HI> is ever the fruit of hatred, but a <HI>correction</HI> hath always love in the bottom of it: there is indeed anger in it; and it consists well enough with the love of God, for him to be angry with his children, and when he is so, he can lay hard blows upon them, and love them still, because they are for their good and not hurt; yea, <HI>because he loves them he chastens them, Heb.</HI> 12:6. And sometimes he strikes so hard that he kills them. God is angry with <HI>Moses</HI> for his
<PB N="17" REF="000583_0020_0FA712D95D2C1BF0"/>
unadvised carriage at <HI>Meribah,</HI> and he must die for it: <HI>David</HI> provokes him in the mat∣ter of <HI>Vriah,</HI> and he must lose his Child on the account: and though such a stroak hath a great deal of smart in it, yet there is no harm comes of it.</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>Gods people must die, that sin may be root∣ed out of them. Sin is beyond dispute the worst evil, and the greatest misery; that Gods people are for the present subjected in it, and have the remains of it in them, they wofully experience: and it is no little infelicity that abides them to consider that they will be sinning as long as they continue in this life: this makes them to cry out dolefully of their</HI> wretchedness; <HI>with him,</HI> Rom. 7.24. <HI>and it is Gods good pleasure not to destroy this sin all at once, nor totally as long as they live; but they must know it to be an</HI> evil and bitter thing <HI>by sad experience in themselves. But when they die, then they sin no more; that unhappy work is at an end with them for ever; so then, their death is to them a passage into a sin less estate: and henceforth God will be no more dishonoured nor their souls wounded by their sin.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. And they must die that their Grace may be perfected, and this is consequent up∣on the former: for till sin be totally abolish∣ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the man, his Grace must needs labour under imperfection. All the sanctification of a believer in this life is but <HI>in part,</HI> and be∣cause of this, he practically comes short in

every thing that he sets about: and it is no little trouble upon his spirits to find so much of the mixture of sinful defect in e∣very thing which he takes in hand: but now Death passeth him over to the fulness of a perfect man in Christ; the Souls that are gone through Death unto Glory, are called <HI>The Spirits of Just Men made perfect</HI>: Heb. 12.23. there are they arrived unto entire Holiness; and this also they get by Dying.</P>
<P N="5">5. By Death Gods People are delivered from Satan and ungodly men, as long as they are here in this life, they dwell with∣in the reach of these enemies, and they give them no little molestation; partly by Per∣secution, putting them to all the trouble they can; partly by Temptation, endea∣vouring to draw them aside into sin, that so they may wound their Souls; and partly by their ungodly lives, whereby they are to these a continual <HI>vexation,</HI> as the <HI>Sodomites</HI> were to <HI>Lot,</HI> whilst he dwelt among them; so that their life is a meer <HI>dwelling in Mesech, and sojourning in the Tents of Kedar</HI>: and these <HI>Daughters of Heth,</HI> makes them <HI>weary of their lives</HI>: but when they come to die they are then removed from them, and shall be molested with them no more for ever: they are now called away and carried to that

place where no such creatures as these shall ever come.</P>
<P N="6">6. Death puts an end to all the sorrows of Gods Children which they encounter withal here. This world is <HI>a vale of tears,</HI> sin hath made it to be so; and the Saints of God have a very large share in the troubles of this life; the <HI>few days</HI> which are allowed to them to live in, are <HI>full of trouble</HI>: and very often do they meet wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a great deal more of this uncomfort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e entertainment than others do: tiresome days and <HI>weary nights are appointed</HI> for them: the curing of the wantonness of their flesh, and the trial of their Graces do call for this, and the Wis∣dom of God sees it meet that they should be thus exerc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed; but though it be for their benefit, it is yet troublesome, and will be an happiness to be rid of it, when we are fit for such a delivery: and this shall be when they dy; now shall all their <HI>tears be wiped away,</HI> and their cheeks shall be dried: their bodies will now <HI>rest</HI> in their <HI>graves,</HI> when sickness and pain shall hurt them no more: and their Souls are conducted into that place, where trouble is a perfect stranger, where grief and molestation were never known.</P>
<P N="5">5. Death also finisheth all their labour. The work of a Christian is a great work▪ and hard too; the remains of strong and active corruption in them, together with the weak∣ness
<PB N="20" REF="000583_0023_0FA712DE02809448"/>
of every Grace they have, and the op∣position which they encounter both from without and within, makes it to be so: and though it be the delight of the new man to be engaged in Holines<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, yet the employment it self is work, and wrestling and fighting. Now, as God hath appointed this life to be unto his people a time of labour; so the o∣ther life is for rest, and it is Death which wafteth them over into it, <HI>Rev.</HI> 14.13. <HI>They rest from their labour.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. It removes them to the place of their compleat Happiness. Sin hath spoiled this lower world from being a place for the en∣joyment of perfect felicity, it is now in hea∣ven alone that it is capable of being posses∣sed. That is the Kingdom of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ory, there are the <HI>fulness of joys and pleasures for evermore,</HI> that is the place where o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r portion is laid up and reserved for us, and we must go thi∣ther in order to our inheriting of it: thi∣ther is our Bridegroom gone, the Lord Jesus Christ, in whose embraces our felicity doth consist, and thither must we go to meet and enjoy h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m: there is our everlasting employ∣ment and fruition; there is all our company either gone or going, for that is the place of the <HI>General Assembly</HI>; we are strangers here, there is our home, so that we must ei∣ther <HI>die</HI> or be <HI>translated,</HI> there being no other way to come at our Happiness; this latter

God sees not meet to indulge us withal, and therefore it must needs be by the former.</P>

<P>I earn hence that Death gives us no rule of judging whether men be good or bad.

It is true, if there be an apparent reason to be read in the lives of men, a sober Judg∣ment may be made about the manner of their dying, so far as to put us upon ado∣ring of the Righteousness of God in it: but meerly from thence to conclude them to be either good or bad, is to argue from a false Topick, <HI>Luke</HI> 13. <HI>begin.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PROPOSITION III. The Death of the Godly is but a sort of sleep.</HEAD>
<P>The Spirit of God takes delight in ex∣pressing it by this Metaphor in Scripture; hence also their grave is resembled unto a <HI>Bed,</HI> and their abiding in it unto <HI>Rest, Isa.</HI>

57.2. and there are many respects in which the resemblance s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tably expresseth the thing; only we must here cautiously observe, that it refers only to the bodies of the Saints; for their Souls sleep not, but do immediately pass over to actual perfect blessedness in the Kingdom of Glory. It is the body properly that <HI>dies,</HI> it is that therefore which <HI>sleeps.</HI> The Heathen Poets were wont to call sleep the <HI>Image of Death,</HI> and the <HI>Brother of death,</HI> because of the similitude between them, but more especially doth the resemblance hold in the Death of Godly ones. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. Sleep is a binding up of the senses, and thereby it takes off the apprehension of pain and trouble. A man that is asleep doth not feel his sorrow. If it be Bodily pain, or if it be any grief oppressing the spirit, by fall∣ing asleep he loseth the present sense of it: as long as it keeps him waiting he is molest∣ed with it, but now it is to him as if it were not; and Death puts a real end to all the molestations and sorrows of the people of God. In this life they are ful of them, and they accompany them to their dissolution▪ but at the Grave they leave them, and they know them no more: <HI>All their Tears are now wiped away,</HI> sighing and sorrow now cease for ever.</P>
<P N="2">2. Sleep gives a suspention to labour Men that work must be awake, when they
<PB N="26" REF="000583_0029_0FA712E3F05536F8"/>
go to sleep they leave off labouring; it puts an end to present business; men lay aside their work, when they lay themselves down to rest: and the death of Gods Children gives a cessation unto their work: the time of life is working time for Gods People, and they have a great deal of business to be em∣ploying themselves in, whilst they are here, in glorifying of God, and in working out of their own Salvation; this is enough to employ all their time, if they had a great deal more than they have; but when once they come to dy, they have done with this, there is no <HI>business</HI> to be done in <HI>the Grave, Eccl.</HI> 9 10. and this is one part of the hap∣piness of Believers in their Death, That <HI>they rest from their Labours, Rev.</HI> 14:13.</P>
<P N="3">3. Sleep is a very comfortable and desira∣ble thing to them that are weary. It gives them rest; when a man hath been to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling and turmo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling all the day long, and tired himself out at his business, it is a desirable and pleasant thing for him to lay himself down to sleep, so saith the Wise man, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 5.12▪ <HI>The sleep of a labouring man is swee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>; and the death of godly men must needs be comfortable to them, when they have born the heat of the day, and gone through many wearis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me troubles of life in a weary world; and every gracious soul finds it to be so, who hath been ready to faint under his burden:

It is an Encomium which is put upon the Grave, <HI>Job</HI> 3.17. <HI>there the weary are at rest</HI>; and of righteous men it is said, that now <HI>they rest in their beds,</HI> Isa. 57.2.</P>
<P N="4">4. The night is the most proper time to sleep in. Then it is that all things are wont to be at quiet; and there is no work to be done, when the darkness invites men to rest; we therefore read, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5.7. <HI>they that sleep, sleep in the night.</HI> The day is accom∣modated for labour, and the night for re∣pose, and the time of death is compared to a <HI>night</HI>; the Grave in which the Dead are laid, is called a <HI>land of Darkness</HI>: and also the troublesome condition of men in this life is compared to a night. There is a great deal of darkness upon the present con∣dition of Gods People whilst they are in this world; and the more troubled the affairs of this life are to them, by reason of mani∣fold afflictions which they encounter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ the more desirable and pleasing it must needs be unto them, to turn aside into the Grave, as into a bed of rest, where they may be got∣ten out of it, and be quiet.</P>
<P N="5">5. Sleep is in order to waking again, and that refreshed; men that lay themselves down to take a sleep, do propose to them∣selves to awake and to rise again, and no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only so, but also to have their spirits resto∣red, and their strength renewed, and them∣selves

to be rendred more lively and vigo∣rous by the benefit they have gotten by it: and thus it shall be in respect of the children of God that die: their death is therefore but a longer sleep, and when the time of it is over, they shall assuredly awaken again, and that to their compleat satisfaction: this the Psalmist, in contemplation of his disso∣lution, comforts himself withal, <HI>Psal.</HI> 17.1▪ <HI>I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness</HI>; and this is the Prophets encourage∣ment, <HI>Isa.</HI> 26.19. <HI>Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise.</HI></P>

<P>Let it serve to direct Gods people, what to do, that their death may be comfortably thought of, and expected by them: and that is by endeavouring to get this secured, that it shall be no other than a sleep to you. This is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of all Gods Children: but though Death shall be really thus to every true Be∣liever, yet there is something to be done by them, that it may be sensibly so to their minds, and they may be able thus to enter∣tain it when it comes: and for this end there are these three things which you are to be ad∣vised about, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Labour to feel the weariness of this life. They are the <HI>weary,</HI> that would fain <HI>be at rest.</HI> As long as life and the concerns of it are not tiresome to us, so long we are loth to dy, and the thoughts of it are un∣grateful to us; but when it is thus with us, then the very forethoughts of it will afford u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> matter of refreshment: <HI>Job</HI> could say, that <HI>he would not live always,</HI> if he might have such an indulgence granted him; and there are a great many things which have e∣nough in them to make us weary, if they were well pondred: there is that sin which we must be always dragging after us, and
<PB N="31" REF="000583_0034_0FA712EB754465F8"/>
putting us to continual grief: and there are the sins of others, which we must see and hear, which will wring tears from our eyes: there are also the sorrows which this life is burdened withal, and will not be at an end whilst that lasts: yea and the very difficulties with which a Christi∣an doth any thing for God here, by rea∣son of his weak grace, and the strong corruption which makes resistance to it; yea, and the dismal days that are expect∣ed to come: it is an happiness to be at rest out of the noise and bitterness of such things: that therefore was a merci∣ful promise which was made to the godly King <HI>Josiah,</HI> 2 Chron. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.28.</P>
<P N="2">2. Be sure to get your work done. The child or servant who hath loitered all the day is loth to come home at night, because he can give so poor an account of his business: but he that hath followed his labour with dili∣gence, and improved his time carefully in the work he was set about, goes home to his rest with a great deal of chearfulness. There is nothing which makes a Child of God more unwilling to dy, than to look back and see how wofully he hath neglected the work of God which he was called unto, and how unhappily he hath been diverted from it; <HI>he is blessed whom his Lord finds so doing.</HI> To have our great Master come to us &amp; say, you
<PB N="32" REF="000583_0035_0FA712ED19698DE0"/>
have laboured sufficiently for the day; come now and lay you down to your rest, is a most comfortable thing: <HI>be you faithful unto the death,</HI> and it shall be so.</P>
<P N="3">3. Endeavour to get this assurance that your souls shall be safe lodged when you dy. This is the great concern of all men. The soul is every wise mans principal care, and when that is secured all is well: he that can say as <HI>Paul,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.1▪ <HI>We know that if our earthly house were dissolved, we have a build∣ing of God, eternal in the heavens,</HI> hath enough to satisfy him; and when death comes he may say with the <HI>Psalmist; Psal.</HI> 116; 7. <HI>Return unto thy rest O my Soul!</HI> Make sure of your union unto Christ, and it shall be so: then shall your Soul go to Christ, and <HI>Be with him which is best of all</HI>: and you may then with greatest freedom and chearfulness re∣commend your body to it's bed, where it shall rest, till it be called to the same blessed eternity of Glory with it's companion in the Resurrection.</P>

<P>Sorrow for the Death of Pious relations,

is, so far from being a sin, that the Omissi∣on of it would be so. Our Apostle doth not here tell them, that he would not have them to sorrow at all: but he only regu∣lates this Mourning; we have therefore in the Scripture the examples of the most eminent and holy men recorded for this without any the least reflection made upon them for it; yea <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> himself <HI>wept</HI> at the grave of <HI>Lazarus:</HI> we shall farther∣more find, that it is one Judgement, which God hath in his word threatned to befal some, that <HI>they shall die unlamented.</HI> We may take this brief account of the ground or reason of this conclusion.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Sorrow or Mourning is nothing else but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ting of the Affection of Grief. To grieve, to sorrow, and to mourn do all intimate one and the same thing. Grief is the inward principle, and sorrow is the expression or exertion of this princi∣ple, by the influence of it upon the spirits, oppres∣sing and dejecting of them, and mourning out∣wardly, which discovers it by sighing,</HI> &amp; <HI>weeping,</HI> &amp; <HI>bitter complaints, that persons make, or whatso∣ever other outward symbols of it men are wont to signalize it by, as by solitariness,</HI> &amp; <HI>walking soft∣ly, putting on Sack Cloth, lying in the Dust, which kinds of practices we find recorded in Scripture.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2</HI> Grief is an affection which is stirred by the apprehension of a present evil, that op∣presseth
<PB N="34" REF="000583_0037_0FA712EE6D58A868"/>
one, and cannot be remedied. <HI>Grief</HI> derives principally from <HI>Hatred,</HI> which is an aversation from evil, and will always some way or other discover its dislike of it; which various ways of expressing it self, according to the different Postures of it, give denomina∣tion to the several Derivarive Affections. Now there are three respects which the evil bears, that give occasion for the stirring of Grief: it is a <HI>present evil,</HI> for if it be future, it moves <HI>fear</HI>; It is something that is upon one that makes impression upon this affecti∣on And it is an <HI>oppressing</HI> evil: a <HI>mans spi∣rit will sustain</HI> a great deal of <HI>infirmity,</HI> but when it overbears, then it makes it begin to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: and it is an evil that <HI>connot be reme∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed</HI>: as long as the man hath any hopes that he may bear it down and repel it, <HI>An∣ger</HI> takes place, and fortifies against it: but when there is no such expectation, then it sets grief on work: the Spirit is now strait∣ned and burdened by it.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Death of Friends and Relations gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es a proper occasion for the excitation of Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ef in us. It hath all of that in it which is proper to the object of such an Affection. <HI>It is an Evil</HI>; it is one of those things which are greatly averse to our natural inclinations; it deprives us of those good things in which a great deal of our love was laid up: it is a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>reavement,</HI> so <HI>Jacob</HI> accounted it, <HI>Gen.</HI> 43
<PB N="35" REF="000583_0038_0FA712EF36175210"/>
14. <HI>It is a pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt evil:</HI> it is that which makes an actual separation between us, and our chiefest comforts, <HI>and it is an oppressing evil</HI>; the most of our delight which we place in any Creat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Objects, is wont to be carried forth unto these; it therefore rends our very Cauls, and streins our heart-strings. Yea, and it is an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rremediable evil</HI>; they are now gone from us, and they must never come to us again; Death makes a total and utter separation; there is no returning again to have any converse among the Living, when we are once gone from hence; all hopes of any farther communion in this world is now wholly cut off, <HI>Job</HI> 14.7. with 10. <HI>there is hope of a Tree,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>but man dies and wasts away; yea man gives up the Ghost, and where is he?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Hence mourning upon such an occasion is but a rational improvement of a natural aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction. All the Affections were put into men by God when he Created them, and so they belong to the very nature of Humani∣ty; now there was an use and serviceableness that these were put into man for; and that was to help him to carry himself suitably to all the occasions of his life. Sin indeed hath put these much out of order, and made them very unruly: but still there is a rati∣onal use to be made of them, which is in it self lawful for men, yea and a moral duty;
<PB N="36" REF="000583_0039_0FA712EFF4823320"/>
and by such an application or improvement, the Affection doth attain the moral end which it was placed in the man for: the thing it self therefore is warrantable; tho' the corrupt heart of sinful man, alwayes spoils his lawful actions, and they, being un∣sanct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fied, <HI>are not pleasing to God, nor can be</HI>: yet the things themselves are justifiable: and hither belongs this of mourning over our dead Friends.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Death of godly Friends hath in it the greatest occasion of all for our grief.

<P N="1">1. The loss it self is upon this account the greater: and that both <HI>personally</HI>; we must needs suffer the more by it, by how much the more profitable they were unto u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and soul advantage is the greatest of all: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore of benefit that we enjoyed by having their presence and company with us, so much the more must we lose in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sing of them: and upon a <HI>publick</HI> account also, in which we are jointly concerned with others: the Death of the Godly is an uni∣versal loss; all that they lived among are suffere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> by it; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea though it be of a private Christian, for he was a publick good; and this cannot but afford us the greater

reason and matter for sorrow: <HI>There is al∣ways some of the glory of a people goes away when a godly man dies.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The more of Gods anger oftentimes discovers it self in such a loss. God takes away his own Children from us, because he is angry at us: we lose our Friends b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cause we had provoked God against us, and be herein testifies unto us that he is displeased at us: and there are no Deaths that carry so much testimony of the Divine Displea∣sure in them, as those of the righteous: for usually his taking of them out of the way, is that he may thereby make way for more Calamities to break in upon us; <HI>Isa.</HI> 57.1. <HI>The righteous is taken away from the evil to come.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Not to lay the Death of such to heart is in it self a provocation given to God. When godly men go off the stage, and there is little or no notice taken of it; it is scarce any matter of grief or trouble to others, they pass it over and are hardly concerned at it, God makes a critical remark upon it, and puts it down as an evil Omen, hence that complaint which he makes about it, Isa. 57.1. <HI>The righteous perisheth, and no man lays it to heart.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PROPOSITION V. Christians in their mourning ought not to imitate the rest of the World.</HEAD>
<P>Although they may irreprehensibly sor∣row at the death of their Friends, yet <HI>not as others do:</HI> These <HI>Thessalonians</HI> to whom the Apostle directed his Epistle, lived a∣mong a company of Heathen, who had not the Knowledge of God nor Christ, and had many Heathenish and Idolatrous Customs a∣mong

them, and particularly in their mour∣ning over their dead: he here gives the people of God warning against imitating of them, or obliging themselves to all their vain and superstitious customs upon this ac∣count; and that we may take up a right notion of the caution here given, let us ob∣serve a few things</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Negatively,</HI> take these two observati∣ons;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That it doth not follow from hence, that because the Heathen mourn for their Dead, therefore Christians are bound not to mourn at all. It is not the thing it self, but the manner of it that is here cautioned against: none but</HI> Stoicks <HI>ever prohibited this, and that upon a false</HI> Hypothesis: <HI>it hath been already taken notice of, that the Law of nature and of Reli∣gion concurr in it; and there are some things which meer Gentiles do, that are morally good, and commendable, and performed according to the light of nature, and dictates of right reason.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Nor doth this caution forbid us to use all outward expressions of our sorrow in our mourning. Such as <HI>weeping</HI>; when our Saviour said to the woman at the bier of her dead Son, <HI>weep not</HI>; it was not a reproof of her action, but a preparatory to her comfort, in the restoring of him to life again: and the putting of themselves into a mourning garb; although there be a great

<P N="2">2. Positively, three things may be obser∣ved.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Heathen are not to be imi∣tated in their excessive Mourning. The A∣postles drift in this place is, to perswade them to moderation in their sorrowing; and so not to follow the courses which such used as did exceed all bounds therein Gods People are too prone to be overwhelmed with immoderate Grief on such occasions as these befalling them in the Providence of God. <HI>Rachel weeps for her Children, and will not be comforted, because they are not</HI>; the Gentiles were accustomed to do too much, but those that profess Christ should set bounds to themselves, and ende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vour not to go be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond them: the reason of this dif∣ference will afterward follow; but here this Rule is to be attended, <HI>viz Gods Children should beware of indulging themselves in their sorrow.</HI> They have a great deal more need

The <HI>object of hope is good</HI>; it is one of those affections which carries us after our object, and enables us to embrace it: <HI>it is derived from love</HI>; and the good which it doth embrace is some∣thing <HI>future</HI>; it hath it not in hand or pre∣sent possession, the man need not hope for that which he hath; but he sees it at a di∣stance; but yet Hope carries the Soul to the thing, as far off as it is, enableth him to entertain it; and for this reason the anci∣ent Patriarchs are said to <HI>see the promise afar off,</HI> and yet to <HI>embrace it,</HI> Hebr. 11.13. and in this respect it makes absent things to be present. The <HI>hand</HI> wherewith this affection lays hold upon its object, is <HI>expectation</HI>; it looks for it, the man presumes and promiseth
<PB N="52" REF="000583_0055_0FA713014F6709F8"/>
himself, that although at present he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> without it, yet he shall in due season enjoy it; that it will undoubtedly come to him, if he can but have patience to tarry for it, until the proper season: he therefore sees it not only absent but future too; that it is coming, and will be present before it be long: and this expectation is not a meer fansy, but is built upon reason; the strength therefore of this hand is the ground upon which the expectation is built, according to the measure of stability there is in that, is this Hope either stronger or weaker.</P>
<P>Now these grounds of expectation are fetched from three <HI>Topicks,</HI> in which also there is a gradation, or so many degrees of settlement.</P>
<P>There is <HI>Possibility</HI>: this is the lowest, and yet it hath its support; for Hope is willing to live, though it have the meanest and thinnest maintainance to live upon; if it can but have a few crumbs, it will not starve: it will keep it self up upon no more than a <HI>who knows?</HI> Jon. 3.9. if it doth not see the matter to be clogged with an utter impossib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lity, it will not give up: Though the man ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h a great deal of fear upon him, and a great many improbabilities are in his view, making him to question, that he is willing to hope too Then there is <HI>Probability,</HI> and this hath a great deal more
<PB N="53" REF="000583_0056_0FA71301E9CED5C8"/>
of life and nourishment in it; Hope can quarter it self pretty comfortably upon this, though there is also a gradation in this, and the more likelihoods there are of the things <HI>obtaining</HI>; the better Table Hope <HI>is</HI> able to keep: and <HI>with these discoveries it is</HI> able to <HI>suppress those</HI> fears <HI>which</HI> may make any <HI>motion in him</HI> by reflecting upon the <HI>pos∣sibility</HI> that the <HI>thing</HI> may <HI>miscarry; especial∣ly</HI> if <HI>things</HI> be not near an <HI>equipoise,</HI> but e∣very <HI>thing bids fair</HI> for a good Issue <HI>likely</HI> to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsue.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Finally there is Certainty; and this is the top of all; when the thing is so secure, that there is no possibility of its failing, the futuriti∣on of it is built upon such grounds as cannot mis∣carry, or in the least be prevented; this furnisheth Hope with such a rich Table, that it is able to feast it every day, and make merry in spite of all that can interpose to disturb it; compare,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.16. <HI>where the Apostle tells us how they bare up chearfully under afflictions, in hope of better things</HI>; with chap. 5.1. <HI>where he gives an account of the strength of this,</HI> for we know, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And now we may easily discover what in∣fluence this must have upon sorrow to at∣temper it, and make it moderate, <HI>viz.</HI> by giving us a prospect of good with relation to that very evil which hath put us to trou∣ble: and there are these effects which are
<PB N="54" REF="000583_0057_0FA71303C6E1C7A0"/>
the natural result of it, all of which are very serviceable unto this purpose.</P>
<P N="1">1. It makes the affliction look less then it did before: it hath not so much in it now as appeared to us at the first aspect: for by this hope entertained, we begin to discern that it is not so great an evil as we had reckoned it to be: the man had over∣rated it, whilst he was looking upon it thro' the spectacles of despair; but Hope puts a sweeter colour and countenance upon it; it makes him to resolve that it is nothing near so bad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s he had been perswaded by his misgiving thoughts: it takes off many of those evil circumstances which he thought it to be attended withal; and this greatly heightens it, and makes it be far more por∣table; thus the Psalmist eased himself when he found the burden ready to sink him with its weight, <HI>Psal.</HI> 43. ult. <HI>Why art thou cast down O my soul, hope thou in God,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It moderates the affection of fear which before did exceed. Fear in excess affords con∣tinual nourishment unto sorrow; if this passion be but moderated, the other will be far better dealt with: moderate fear is an help to men, be∣cause it puts caution into them, and employs them in a diligent using of means to redress their troubles; but if it grows beyond the bounds of moderation, it then drives men from endeavour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
<PB N="55" REF="000583_0058_0FA71305DD3E01F8"/>
and betrays them into the hands of despair, which is the bitterest ingredient of Sorrow: now Hope is a preventive to this; because, how sore soever the present distress be, it com∣mands the man to expect a good issue of it, and to resolve with him,</HI> Psal. 56.3. what time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.</P>
<P N="3">3. It diverts the mind with better thoughts, sorrow takes a great deal of pleasure in fee∣ding it self with poring upon black and bit∣ter speculations; it findeth a kind of a sul∣len contentment in representing every thing to it self with Sable Colours, and thereupon to sink it self yet lower with its own thought whereas Hope interposeth more bright and lightsome things for the mind to be looking upon, and by such an entertainment as this is, gives unto it a very happy diversion; the heart is hereby opened, and hath liberty gi∣ven it to fetch breath and recover spirits &amp; life again.</P>
<P N="4">4. It puts men upon the exereise of Pa∣tience. Impatience under sorrow, makes it to be a great deal more burdensom than o∣therwise it would be: now the genuine fruit of Hope is patience: when expectation is raised in a man, it puts him upon waiting, and makes him quiet in waiting; and this is proportionable to the degrees that hope hath arrived to; so that when the good ex∣pected is certain to come without fail, and
<PB N="56" REF="000583_0059_0FA71307444EEF90"/>
there is a clear prospect that when it doth come, it will make a full compensation for all the trouble which hath been susteined, toge∣ther with the removal of it from him; a com∣fortable perswasion that it shall be so, makes him to be earnestly looking out for it, and to satisfy himself for the present with the ex∣pectation of it. This may suffice for the consideration of Hope in general; it follows to enquire.</P>
<P N="2">2: What ground of Hope the people of God have, concerning their Dead, more then other men have.</P>
<P>A. The Apostle here intimates concerning others, that they have none at all: not as if there were none but Gods children that make any pretence to an hope concerning such as these. If we speak of the Hea∣then Nations, to which our Text hath a more immediate respect, they enterteined divers sentiments concerning the state of the dead, and made answerable improvement of these notions. The <HI>Epicurean</HI> Sect in∣deed thought man to be utterly mortal; their tenent was <HI>Cum sumus, non est mors; cum mors est, non sumus.</HI> And hereupon they pleased themselves with this, that death puts an end to all miseries: But the <HI>Platonists</HI> held the Immortality of the soul, and the communion of souls in a future state, and would take a great deal of satisfaction in
<PB N="57" REF="000583_0060_0FA71307EC5C2BB0"/>
the forethoughts of that happy day when they should come to enjoy one another again in a better condition. The <HI>Peripateticks</HI> also verged this way, though not without some hesitancy. But as to the Resurrection of the Body, it agreed not with their principles, and seemed an impossibility to their way of reasoning, and therefore they exploded it with all manner of scoffs and scorns: If we speak of the visible profession of Christiani∣ty, and such as have been acquainted with the Word of God, these do for the genera∣lity acknowledge the same Truths upon which the Hope of Gods Children is built▪ and do also support themselves with such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ope from the consideration thereof, as af∣fords them a great deal of present quiet▪ But the intendment of the expression is, that there are none else but the people of God who have a good ground for their Hope; that all others, how confident soever they may be, do build without a foundation.</P>
<P>Now if we would take a right scantling of this matter, there are three things which must be considered in conjunction?</P>
<P N="1">1. The persons hoping; and they are such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s are not barely Christian by profession, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e also true believers in State. For tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this hope is offered to all persons where the Gospel comes, yet there are none that have really embraced it but they, and though
<PB N="58" REF="000583_0061_0FA71308D7210158"/>
the goodness of the person hoping, doth not contribute any thing to the good estate of the person for whom this hope is con∣ceived, (for every one must be saved by his own faith, and not that of another, which is of Gods free-giving, and not o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our meriting,) yet there is an hope which godly men may entertain with respect un∣to their dead, which others cannot do upon the same reason: yea and there are argu∣ments of comfort to be drawn from their hope, by such as these, which others can∣not derive unto themselves without false∣hood; as will be made to appear in the sequel of this discourse.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The persons hoped for: they are such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> sleep: i. e. <HI>such as we have any grounded hope concerning, that they</HI> died in Christ; <HI>and this is not the lot of all men; nor yet of all such as live under the Dispensation of Gospel Ordi∣nances, and have been externally related to the Covenant: and it is a thing very evident that the hope here intended hath all its strength from Christ; and therefore the thing hoped must de∣rive from an interest in him, and by consequence it must hold proportion with the reason which we had to conclude that they had such an interest, for, to be</HI> without Christ, <HI>and to be</HI> without hope, <HI>do run parallel, Eph.</HI> 2.12.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The things upon which our Hope feeds it self concerning them, and from which it sup∣plies
<PB N="59" REF="000583_0062_0FA7130971BA7418"/>
us with our consolation: and they must be such things as are in themselves hopeable, and upon a presumption that they shall come to pass, do contain matter of good consolation in them. Now that which must comfort us in our mourning for those that are dead, must give us particular relief against those very things which are the grounds of our Sorrow: and the proper reason of this sorrow is, a supposed loss which there is sustained by their death: and this must be either</HI> with <HI>respect to our selves, or unto them</HI>: That which is with respect unto our selves is, that we have lost them, and that which refers unto them is that they are lost: here∣upon the evil which we apprehended to be suffered by this loss, is that by which we take the measure of our sorrows: all the hope then which we can entertain about it, either that the thing is not so as we think, or that it is not so bad as we did suspect it to be, will give us mitigation here: and that is it which we are to make enquiry af∣ter. Let us then for the present take it for granted upon supposition, that we that are Mourners are true believers; and they for whom we are in mourning, are such as are <HI>dead</HI> in Christ: and in this case, the Word of God is fully stored with abundant provi∣sion to establish our Hope, against those very things which Christians are wont to make the greatest arguments of their grief.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="000583_0063_0FA7130A4FED9B30"/>Here then observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This Hope doth not take away all occasion of mourning wholly from us; because there is un∣doubtedly a present grievous loss sustained by us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sers by the Death of all such on a tem∣poral respect▪ for we are bereaved of their desi∣rable and delectable company; we can no farther enjoy them, and solace ourselves with them in this life; we have no hopes ever to see them any more among the living; all the benefit which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had by their sweet company, pleasant entercourses or whatsoever was dear to us in their presence with it, is now utterly gone, and wee must see their faces and hear their voices no more; yea and many times there is a great deal of the sense of the anger of God imprinted upon our minds, up∣on the taking of such away from us; and a sad and sorrowful remembrance is left behind of the fearful provocation that we had given to God to bereave u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and that carries a sad and smar∣ting sting in it, which makes deep wounds in our consciences, and ingeminates our grief. And they are lost also as to themselves in many respects They are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in respect of the present life, which is in it self a very desireable blessing, but now they are cut off from it, and it may be in the very bud, or in the blossom of their age, before they have had the opportunities to do much of their work; and their bodies are lost as to any capacity of being serviceable to their souls in their natu∣ral employments and rational services, being now
<PB N="61" REF="000583_0064_0FA7130BF6238710"/>
laid by in a rotting grave, deprived of all life and motion, they are therefore lost as to any far∣ther oportunity of glorifying God among the living: might they have been spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed and suffered to have lived a litle longer, they might have been precious instruments of the Honour of God, been capable of doing much good in their generation, and how much would this also have also tended to their everlasting benefit, but now they are lost as to all this,</HI> the deal praise thee not, &amp;c. Psal. 115.17. <HI>and these things do carry evil, and matter of mourning in them but.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> There is something to compensate this loss which our Hope may safely stay it self upon; and that both in consideration of our selves and of them too; neither is our nor their case <HI>desperate</HI> or irreparable: it may be made up, the loss repaired in a good measure <HI>for the present,</HI> and to be sure in measure full and running over <HI>for the fu∣ture,</HI> and what more is there to be desired to make our hope full? here then;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>For the present</HI> there is good Hope, and that</P>
<P N="1">1. In respect of our selves in waiting for the accomplishment of that Promise, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.28. <HI>all things shall work together for good to them that love God.</HI> The Apostle is there speaking of afflictions, and the loss of friends and relations is none of the least of these. God is able to repair us to the full and run∣ning

over, and that both by his Grace and his comfort, he can sanctifie such a loss to us for our very great gain: there is many a Child of God that finds honey in this Lion▪ they are by such a Providence weaned a great deal more from Creatures, and drawn nearer unto God; they experience how poor things these are to lean upon or make the objects of our delight, and to find that none but God can be a portion suitable and suffici∣ent: God also useth this to put them upon serious reflection upon their former ways and courses; and leads them to repentance and reformation of those things that had provoked God thus to deal by them: they learn to love earth the less, and heaven the more by this, and accordingly they are put upon the pursuit of heavenly things with intenseness; and this is an exceeding great benefit; and God is able to reveal more of himself to their souls upon it, and give them spiritual comforts in the room of tem∣poral, the light of his countenance in ex∣change for the delight which they had in the creature; and God is frequently wont thus to do, which is a very happy and advante∣geous exchange to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. With regard to them who are Dead. Though a lifeless body, which they leave upon our hands lying by the Walls, to be commended to the cold and silent Grave,
<PB N="63" REF="000583_0066_0FA7130D4BC90378"/>
where it must be entertained with Worms and Rottenness, and be turned into putre∣faction and dust, are sad entertainments to our Melancholy thoughts; yet God hath provided our hope with a comfortable re∣past for the present, when we look off from this sad spectacle, and remember that their immortal soul no sooner took their flight from their dying bodyes, but they imme∣diatly fell into the hands of glorious Angels, and were by them royally guarded to the Palace of delight, and are now sweetly en∣tertained in the bosome and embraces of the Lord Jesus Christ; perfectly freed from all sin and sorrow, which shall never more molest them; filled with joys and pleasures in that blessed Kingdom: that they went from hence directly into <HI>Paradise,</HI> and are now, whiles we are in heaviness for them, singing of endless <HI>Hallelujahs</HI>: that they have but broken their prison, and obtained the greatest and most blessed enlargement: that their better part now lives, <HI>and is with Christ which is best of all.</HI> And this for the present.</P>
<P N="2">2. For the Future: <HI>And here there is a victorious Hope in both the forementioned respects: and there are more especially three Articles of the Christian Religion, which affords life and nourishment to this hope, all of which are urged by our Apostle in the context of
<PB N="64" REF="000583_0067_0FA7130E1DF1C968"/>
this Chapter, for the whetting on of his Exhor∣tation upon these he writes to; and they are of equal use to the People of God, in all the Ages of the World.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Happy <HI>Resurrection</HI> which all those that sleep in Christ shall partake in. It is true, all the Dead, both good and bad shall rise again; but ungodly men have no hope in the Resurrection: nor yet their friends for them on this account; because their rising is only in order to their having the more fearful fall: whereas the Resurrection of the Just is a Doctrine full of all Consolation this therefore is urged, <HI>context, verse,</HI> 14▪ <HI>them that Sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</HI> And it is greatly enlarged upon, in▪ 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 15, Where both the thing it self is asserted, and the precious qualities of it are declared. For Gods people to think with full perswasion that these very bodies which we had been so intimate withal, and of whose Communion we are now depri∣ved shall not only rise, but so rise as is de∣scribe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>verse,</HI> 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.43. Changed so excee∣dingly for the better, is a very precious thought: the Psalmist thought this truth believed and pondered by him, was enough to make his <HI>flesh to rest in hope, Psal.</HI> 16.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.10. he thought he could dye chearfully: well then may we quiet ourselves in hope, concerning them, by observing and believe∣ing
<PB N="65" REF="000583_0068_0FA71311A4FA7DE0"/>
what a change for the better shall then be made.</P>
<P N="2">2. Their happy meeting of Christ when he shall come to the last Judgement. That he will so come, the Scriptures of truth have given in a full Testimony unto: that all these shall meet him at his coming, is asser∣ted, <HI>context. ver.</HI> 15. where it is given as another ground of Consolation to the Chil∣dren of God▪ and there is a great deal of reason for it, because they shall then meet him in the quality of his Favourites and Redee∣med ones. It is true they shall meet him as their Judge: but this also is their great Pri∣viledge, because he will then come to acquit them from all that was here laid to their charge, openly to Justify them, to declare them to be his redeemed, to <HI>confess them be∣fore his glorious Angels,</HI> and to adjudge them to be the heirs, and appoint them to the possession of that Kingdom, and those felicities which he hath purchased and pro∣vided for their everlasting entertainment: others indeed shall meet Christ at his Tribu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al, and there they shall be judged by him, but it is to be condemned, to receive a fear∣ful Sentence, adjudging them to eternal mi∣series; whereas these being acquitted, shall be made honourable Assessors with Christ in his Judging the world, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.2.</P>
<P N="3">3. Their everlasting abode with him in
<PB N="66" REF="000583_0069_0FA713EC22657B20"/>
his glorious Kingdom, after the Judgment is over; this encouragement is expressed, Context, verse 17. <HI>and so shall we be ever with the Lord</HI>; when Jesus Christ shall have finished that great Affair, and that High Court shall be broken up, then shall he re∣turn to Heaven again, attended with the pompous Train of Holy Angels, which waited upon him in that Transaction, toge∣ther with all his Redeemed Saints, who in Soul and Body shall go with him to the hea∣venly Kingdom, and there be filled for ever with his presence, and be made blessed by his Communion through all Eternity; where as all others shall be excluded from his Pre∣sence, and suffer everlasting miseries in that Separation. Now these hopes are sufficient to swallow up all sorrows, and to dry up our tears▪ at least to keep them within the bounds of a due moderation, in either re∣spect▪ now is the happy time when we shall come together again, and when we are there met, we shall part no more: and then our mutual fruitions shall be entirely per∣fect, and without any dregs or mixtures of sorrow or fear; we with them being toge∣ther made compleatly blessed in the full enjoyment of all that which we have hoped for: and here lies the strength of a believ∣ers hope in this respect: The things them∣selves which are to feed and nourish it are
<PB N="67" REF="000583_0070_0FA713ECAB63B250"/>
full, and there is nothing wanting in them; and they are also certain with respect to all those that are so qualified, as we have been considering; we have the infallible Testimony of the Spirit of God recorded in the Holy Scriptures giving us a full confir∣mation of these things.</P>
<P>But there is a great enquiry whieh still remains, and it is about the strength of this hope in reference to the Subject about which it is to be conceived by us: Though the things themselves be indubitable conclusions concerning all such as are so qualified; yet what room is there to exercise this hope in particular, respecting this and that person? and how may our sorrow be mode∣rated thereby? for, suppose we our selves are true believers, and consequently heirs of the Promise, yet except we have some encouragement to hope and believe that those who are gone, <HI>died in Christ,</HI> we must remain hopeless concerning them. <HI>I</HI> know that there are divers serious Souls, that would desirously have something be offered for their satisfaction in this great case; I shall therefore endeavour to discuss it according to Scripture Light; and to make way for a more full resolution, let these things be premised.</P>
<P N="1">1. That Christian Hope is a Grace which is exercised by the influence of Faith. Faith
<PB N="68" REF="000583_0071_0FA713ED73F529A8"/>
is the leading Grace of all those that are wrought in Sanctification, and a Child of God lives by it, <HI>Hebr.</HI> 10.38. <HI>the Just shall live by his Faith i. e.</HI> it is to influence the hope of a Christians conversation: it is that whereby he depends upon Christ, and by the promise, derives from him all that which e∣nableth him to serve God in the improvement of every vertue that is in him: and this is that which principally makes Christianity to differ from meer morality: Hope must have its grounds, and Gods people must have the help of Faith to establish them on these grounds.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence we infer, that a Believers hope hath a good foundation to build upon, which it is fully assured of. For if it be built upon Faith, it hath the same foundation in the bot∣tom with Faith, and that must needs have its Evidence in it, which supposeth assurance: for that cannot be called Evidence or Demonstrati∣on, which is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sure; hence we have that Encomium given to Faith,</HI> Heb▪ 11.1. it is the Evidence of things not seen; <HI>i. e. it gives a full discovery that the things hoped for, though they lie out of our present sight, are no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> meer suppositions, but realities. If there were not a certain future happy estate of the People of God, if this proposition were not in∣fallibly true, both with respect to the thing, and also to the subjects for whom it is provided,
<PB N="69" REF="000583_0072_0FA713EE43042FB0"/>
Faith could give unto Hope no evidence at all; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut these things are unquestionably true, being confirmed by the Testimony of him</HI> who cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; <HI>so that the Doctrines forementioned are not things that may come under dispu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, but are confidently to be belie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by all that will not de∣ny their Religion: and these are they which hope makes use of,</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That the application of this Hope is in re∣spect of something future. For such a thing, we observed, is the proper object of hope, accord∣ing to that of the Apostle,</HI> Rom. 8.24 Hope that is seen, is not Hope, for what a man sees, why doth he yet hope for? <HI>There is something that is expected to come, upon the as∣surance of these premises; and that is the eternal felicity of such as are under the shadow of this promise: either they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot yet happy, or we are not as yet fully assu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> that they are▪ either the thing is future, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> perfect knowledge of it is so; and we are in the mean while encou∣raging of our selves by this Hope.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. This application is not in respect of every one for whom we Hope, of equal evi∣dence. Though the general Rule of faith be sufficiently Demonstrable, <HI>viz. chat all the Dead are blessed which dy in the Lord:</HI> yet the particular inference of hope, hath its different degrees with respect to the persons concerning whom it is execised: and the reason of this difference lieth here, because
<PB N="70" REF="000583_0073_0FA713EEEA6345C8"/>
we have not a like evidence of the being of the thing in those whom we hope for, which is the reason of our Hope; for,</P>
<P N="1">1. In regard to our selves, we may have a sensible assurance of our future good e∣state: such as may set us down fully satis∣fied, and which shall not deceive us: <HI>Paul</HI> could say, <HI>we know,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.1. <HI>and we are always confident, ver.</HI> 6. I do not say that e∣very true believer hath this apprehensively; godly men have many clouds that intercept this light, and there are some <HI>that sit in darknes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>; but he may have it, it is a thing attainable, and he hath the grounds of it in him. That every one that dies in the faith shall rise again in a glorious state, meet Christ coming to Judgment with comfort, and live for ever in his presence, is certain: now they that are united to Christ by a li∣ving faith, shall assuredly so dy: and there are those discoveries to be made of the tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h of this faith which are undeceiving, for it hath its properties which belong to it, and are no where else to be found: they are <HI>the things which accompany salvation</HI>: so that upon the experience of them in him∣self, a believer may safel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> assume, and say, I am united to Christ, <HI>by a faith certain,</HI> and therefore I shall rise in glory, stand in the Judgment, and eternally possess the incor∣ruptible Inheritance.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="71" REF="000583_0074_0FA713EFAC3A0580"/>2. In respect of others the case is far other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wise: for though the <HI>Hypothesis</HI> is certain, <HI>viz</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f they are in Christ, then all the felicity we have heard of is their portion, yet the <HI>Assum∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion</HI> is not directly of <HI>Faith</HI> which always hath the Divine Testimony to confirm it, but of <HI>charity,</HI> for.</P>
<P N="1">1. No man can infallibly know anoth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs good estate without divine revelation. The dif¦ferencing notes by which Sincerity and Hypo∣crisy are to be distinguished are latent; God only knows them certainly. A man may make a great shew, and carry it with a great deal of strict preciseness, and yet be rotten within. There are a great many that pro∣fess and walk orderly for along time, and yet they fall at last into some soul Apostasy; and it is not to be questioned but that there are others that never discover themselves to the world, but go off fairly to our apprehen∣sion, who yet dissembled, and deceived o∣thers, and it may be themselves too. The day will discover many mistakes and wrong guesses that were here made by the most discerning Christians. It is Gods alone prerogative to judge the heart.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There are greater hopes concerning some than others, of some there are such probabilities as give us a great deal of settled satisfaction concerning them▪ their lives are so holy, their
<PB N="72" REF="000583_0075_0FA713F06A038610"/>
Testimonies are so clear, their conversation so shining, that we hope without any doubt con∣cerning them, having as much to set us down; as can rationally be expected for our satisfacti∣on in their good state, others give only slight and more weak encouragements to our hope, and mix it with many occasions of fear and jea∣lousie concerning them: and yet hope hath at least so much to say, that there is some pro∣bability, at least a possibility that they may be well, and this gives some relief, though not so much as the other.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. This Hope is only given us for our pre∣sent support in this life. The truth is there will be no occasion for it afterwards: The Children of God are while they live here very anxious and sollicicions about the ever∣lasting estate of their friends and relations▪ they know a great deal more then others do, concerning the terrors of the Lord, and the affairs of another world, and their natu∣ral affection put them upon much inquisitive∣ness about them; the present thoughts which they have of their being under the impression of those doleful miseries that are denounced in the curse, are killing thoughts, and they cannot tell how to support their spirits un∣der them, but they are ready to sink, God is therefore pleased to afford them this Hope for their present relief. When a Child of God is made perfect, as he shall then
<PB N="73" REF="000583_0076_0FA713F38E666E90"/>
be fully informed and assured about these things, so he shall be compleatly satisfied in them; there shall be no unruly unmortified affections then to be wrested withal, but an entire acquiescence in the Justice and Righ∣teousness of God: and as there will be no more room for hope, either for one or for another, because every ones state shall be put beyond it, so there will be no occasion for it: but whilst we are here in this life, there is no doing without it, God hath therefore set it before us, together with the grounds of it, and they that make a right improvement, shall never be ashamed of it: the use of our hope, is not to do them any good, for they are gotten past the advantage of receiving any benefit by us; but it is to do our selves good, and it serves suitably to that end, when it is helpful to put us into a quiet and submissive frame to the hand of God upon us.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>We are to rest in the revealed will of God for our Hope, and not to pry into his secret will. It is to be granted, that concerning our selves, we may come to know our Election by our vocati∣on, and we ought to endeavour to arrive to that assurance</HI>; 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.10. <HI>but we can have no such knowledge concerning others. We are apt to say, oh! if we were but sure of their well-being, we could then be quiet and contented; but this is to fight against God▪ it is his pleasure
<PB N="74" REF="000583_0077_0FA713F601840020"/>
to keep these things secret for the present; and it is good for us that he so doth, we are not fit to be acquainted w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th the particular estate of these and those in another life; when we are, we shall know; and that will be when there are no more remainders of flesh and corruption in us. In the</HI> Interim, <HI>God hath so far reveal∣ed his mind unto us in his word, as to give us those grounds of hope, in which we ought to bear up, and comfort, at least sustain our souls: but we must ever remember that of,</HI> Deut. 29.29. the secret things belong to God. <HI>It is Gods will that we should pry no farther, than into his word, for our direction; and it is our duty to comply with his will, and there can be no profit in doing otherwise.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. All the Arguments of our Hope, are to be fetched f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om the new Covenant. It is in that Covenant that the only foundati∣on for fallen mans hope is laid: It is one <HI>Epithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> that is put upon that legal estate, or the relation which men have to the first Co∣venant, that it is <HI>without Hope, Eph.</HI> 2.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. The unhappy fall hath brought the whole race of mankind under the sentence of Con∣demnation: man, woman, and child are so many dead persons according to the tenour of that Covenant: the curse of Death is fallen upon them, which hath bound them over to the suffering of all misery. It is in the new Gospel Covenant that <HI>life and im∣tality
<PB N="75" REF="000583_0078_0FA713F7562E0250"/>
are brought to light</HI>; and as the only way to Salvation is there made known to us, so the foundation upon which Salvation is to be hoped for, is there alone to be found &amp; it is according thereunto that we have solid encouragement.</P>
<P>From hence therefore I shall endeavour to draw those Rules upon which our hope is to Proceed in the Present case. And here also there are two sorts about whom we are wont to be concerned and very thoughtful, <HI>viz.</HI> such as dy in their infancy, and such as dye adult, or after they are come to years of understanding: <HI>I</HI> shall speak of each distinct∣ly.</P>
<P N="1">1. Concerning Children that dye in their infancy. <HI>I</HI> understand all that age wherein they are not grown up to these years of knowledge, wherein they are able to im∣prove the word of God, and the ordinances of the Gospel, for the good of their own Souls, in the ordinary course of Gods provi∣dence; for some extraordiaary instances are not here to be drawn into a general Rule. There is great reason why we should not mourn for these as that have no <HI>Hope</HI>; for there is a great deal to be pleaded, and that which is abundantly satisfying, upon their score. And we may take a brief discovery of it in these particulars.</P>
<P N="2">2. Negatively take these three Conclu∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="76" REF="000583_0079_0FA713F7EFBF3C70"/>1. That Saving Grace is not absolutely tied to the visible covenant. It doth not ascertain Conversion and Salvation to every one that is under it. The Gospel Cove∣nant requires such conditions to be found in us, as God alone is able to work by Al∣mighty power, and he is Soveraign in his dispensations; <HI>he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, Rom.</HI> 9.8. His Grace is free. So that being in the Covenant and under the terms of it, doth it not make an infallible truth that such an one must &amp; shall be Saved. We know that God hath a Glory for his revenging <HI>Justice,</HI> as well for his Grace, to be gained in his visible Church; there are therefore threatnings as well as promises put into the Covenant; and the promises themselves are Conditional, and will argue no farther than from the Condition being wrought in the person, which God is not under any possitive engagement to this or that person to do it for him:</P>
<P N="2">2. The innocency of Children cannot save them. Nor is it any reason or ground of Salvation: It is not that which makes any impression, or becomes any motive on the heart of God to save them rather than o∣thers. It is then a very poor Hope that is built upon this Consideration. This, as it raiseth prejudices in some at the providence
<PB N="77" REF="000583_0080_0FA713F8ACFB4628"/>
of God to think that such poor innocents must dy, and they are ready to murmure on this account; so it is the strength <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Hope of a great many other; they comfort themselves after such a manner, poor Babes▪ they never did any harm in this world, In∣nocent Lambs that never sinned in their lives, surely then God cannot but pity and have mercy upon them, and is this all? alas! there is no reason nor plea at all in this. <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bilons Children</HI> were every whit as innocent as ours are, and yet see what is declared concerning them, <HI>Psal.</HI> 137▪ <HI>ul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> By innocence we can intend truly no more but only this, <HI>viz.</HI> that they never actually did any harm, that they have not committed any actual sin since they were born; and this is a very poor sort of innocence: why did they not so do? it was because they could not; they were not arrived to a capacity of doing either good or hurt: as not hav∣ing the liberty or power of using their ra∣tional faculties for the performing of Hu∣mane acts: but in the mean while let us re∣member, they were only <HI>innocent vipers,</HI> that were as full of the poyson and malignity of sin as ever they could hold, and would have vented this venome of theirs as soon as they had gotten a little strength and understand∣ing; we should soon have seen what brood they were of; and therefore in themselves
<PB N="78" REF="000583_0081_0FA713F985BA8998"/>
deserved to be killed in the nest; we are told what all <HI>Adams</HI> posterity are, in their birth, Psal. 58.3. <HI>they are estranged from the womb, they go astray as soon as they are bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, speaking lies</HI>; and what an innocency is this?</P>
<P N="3">3. Nor can the piety of the parents merit the application of saving grace to the Chil∣dren. God is not obliged or brought in debt unto us, by any thing of ours. We ourselves when we have done all we can, and served God with the greatest integrity, are still <HI>saved by grace, Eph.</HI> 2.8. And so must our Children too: God hath the liberty to do with his own what he will, we cannot be before hand with him. They greatly err, who think that infants are saved by the Faith of their Parents, as the Condition of their salvation; much less can it be the procuring cause of it: The qualification to which Salvation is ascerteined, or the condition re∣quired in the new covenant in order to Sal∣vation must be found. Habitually at least, in every one that partakes in the good of it; <HI>The Just shall live by his Faith</HI>; and as a god∣ly Parent can neither Propagate it by Gene∣ration, nor produce it by all his most careful endeavours, so neither can he make God a Debtor of it to his Children by any thing that he can do, for <HI>when he hath done all he is
<PB N="79" REF="000583_0082_0FA713FA333B20A8"/>
an unprofitable Servant, hath done but his duty, Luk.</HI> 17.10.</P>
<P N="2">2. Positively, take these following conclu∣sions;</P>
<P N="1">1. That godly parents have a better hope concerning their Children than those that are Unconverted. Though both are in the Gospel Covenant outwardly, and under the external dispensations of it: and though a gracious man can no more merit for his Children then an ungracious man; nor can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e any more work saving grace in them than the other; yet his hopes are far better than the other: and the reason of this is e∣vident; because we have observed that the hope of Gods Children is a result of their faith; we are therefore said to be <HI>be∣gotten to a lively faith,</HI> i. e. in <HI>Regeneration,</HI> The Hope of Godly ones is not a meer Affection, but a sanctified Affection; and therefore it cannot be but there where this sanctification is wrought.</P>
<P>Though God can as well save the Child of an unbeliever, as of the most eminent Saint in the world, yet the unbeliever cannot so well hope for it: and the reason is because this soul satisfying Hope, is a fruit of the spirit, and is wrought in none but such whom he sanctifies. An unregenerate man is under the Covenant threatning, and there∣fore all the Hopes that he maintains himself
<PB N="80" REF="000583_0083_0FA713FB24D6A618"/>
withall in that state, are no better then pre∣sumptions; he is ready under a curse, and so cannot challenge an interest in any promise▪ what hath he to do with Gospel Consola∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons as long as <HI>he goes on in his Transgressi∣ons.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The more fruitful and conscientious Gods people are in their Duties to their Children▪ the stronger hopes they may en∣tertein concerning them. There are some Duties which we ow to our Children in their infancy; others are to be attended as they grow up to understanding: the for∣mer of these are under our present consi∣deration. Now, though all our care and conscience that we exert in these Duties, cannot work the saving change in them; yet▪ as it is certein, that in order of the means, doing of duty is neerer to the blessing then the neglect of it; so a man hath a great deal more of inward tranquility upon his mind, in the faithful discharge of it, than in the omission or sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghty performance, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.165. <HI>great peace have all they that keep thy law, and nothing shall offend them.</HI> And be∣cause there is a connexion between the pro∣mise and the precept, the more fruitful we are in our obedience to God, the clearer is our evidence that the promise belongs unto us: Now there are Duties to and for our Infants: God hath put them under our
<PB N="81" REF="000583_0084_0FA713FBAAFFB890"/>
care, and expects this of us: They are to be presented to God in <HI>Baptism,</HI> that they may have the sign and the seal of his Covenant bestowed upon them: and they are to be continually brought to God in our ardent importunate prayers; and we are to begin early with tyem to instruct them, and drop into them the things of God, and the great things, of Salvation, according as they are capable of imbibing the same. The neglect of these things will not a little obstruct the exercise of our hope: it will be a great damp to our minds, to have such a reflection upon them as this, I did not so much as pray earnestly to God for the Soul of this Child, and now it is gone past all prayers. I do not say, that those of Gods people that have not been so solicitous as they ought, have no hope; God can give us hope too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but to be sure every such consideration will cast a damp upon our spirits.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Infants of Professing Parents are in the Gospel Covenant. By professing Parents I understand, such as do openly own the truths of the Gospel, and do walk orderly in subjection to the Government of Christ therein appointed; and that the Children of such as are within the Vineyard, are brought under the terms of the Covenant, and priviledged with the outward be∣nefit of it, is a great Scripture Truth, and a ground of abundance of consolation to the souls
<PB N="82" REF="000583_0085_0FA713FC99664608"/>
of serious Parents, then they can look into the Word of God, and there satisfie themselves in this, that God hath so far owned their Children to be his, as to take them under the shadow of his Covenant. This was not only a priviledge conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed upon</HI> Israel <HI>in the days of the Old Testament; but it belongs to the visible Church in the days of the New Testament too: It be∣longed not restrictively to</HI> Moses<HI>'s; padagogy, but it was put into</HI> Abrahams <HI>Covenant,</HI> Gen. 17.7, 9. <HI>It is therefore revived in the days of the Gospel,</HI> Acts 2.3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>the promise is to you</HI> and to your Children, 1 Cor. 7.14. your Children are holy; <HI>and certainly it cannot but be some relief to a sorrowful Christian, when his Infant dies, to think with himself, this Child of mine wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Covenant with God; es∣pecially if he consider how much there is in this; and therefore,</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That the direct aim of the New-Cove∣nant is life and Salvation. <HI>I</HI> do not say that all who are any way comprehended under it shall certainly obtain Salvation, the Scripture assures us that the case stands far otherwise: the fig tree which is planted in the vineyard may prove barren, and be a <HI>cum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er to the ground,</HI> &amp; for that reason may be cut down: the Gospel may, and very frequently doth e∣ventually, prove to be a <HI>savour of death in them that perish,</HI> 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.15.16. Many are at last found unbelievers and so procure
<PB N="83" REF="000583_0086_0FA713FE56433418"/>
Damnation to themselves. But this is cer∣tain that God introduced the New-Covenant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the deficiency of the Old-One, in point of being able to give life to fallen men, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.21, <HI>If there had been a law that could have given life, verily Righteousness should have been by the law.</HI> It was because man had destroy∣ed himself, and there was no remedy provi∣ded for him in the first Covenant, that God revealed another in which there was one: and what could the direct aim of this be, but that a number of that unhappy race might be delivered from eternal death, and made par∣takers in Salvation? There was enough to destroy all mankind in the former Covenant, the curses of it were amazing: if it had not been for the Salvation which is provided in this it had never been promulgated; <HI>life</HI> therefore and <HI>immortality</HI> are said to be <HI>brought to light by the Gospel,</HI> 2. Tim. 1.20. And this consideration also gives no little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ift to the Hope of Godly Parents: it must have some comfort in it, to think that the Cove∣nant in which my Babe died, was a Covenant of life and peace. And yet farther.</P>
<P N="5">5. That the Babtism which is appointed for and applied unto infants is not to no pur∣pose. It would be too large a digression here to insert what may be said to make it evident that infant Babtiism is a Divine in∣stitution, appointed by God to be applied
<PB N="84" REF="000583_0087_0FA713FEAA983C60"/>
to the Infants of his professing people. That they are included in Gods Covenant, and have the qualifications rendring them capable of this Ordinance, hath been so often and sub∣stantially made good against all the attempts that have been used to undermine this Do∣ctrine, that I hope duly considerate persons will not call it in question: Now upon the supposition, which I reckon to be sufficiently evident, That these Infants are Baptised by Gods Command, and that this Baptism is a visible seal of the Gospel Covenant unto them, as Circumcision was of the Covenant of Grace under a more legal dispensation of it; certainly then God had some end in this appointment; for we know that he doth nothing, he commands nothing in vain: and this design must have a respect either to the Children, or to the Parents, or to both, mediately; and to the Glory of God ultimate∣ly: This very thing must bring some glory or other unto God, either from the one, or the other, or both. In respect of the Chil∣dren who are made the Subjects of this Or∣dinance; we cannot readily conceive that it should encrease their Condemnation upon the supposition that they dy in their Infan∣cy; and the reason is because, as they cannot unders<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and the nature and design of it, so they are incapable of actually abusing it: and how it can possibly have a moral influ∣ence
<PB N="85" REF="000583_0088_0FA713FF997113A8"/>
upon them to draw them unto Christ, is beyond our ability to conceive, in as much as they have not any present knowledge of it: and a physical operation, it can have none at all, it being purely Sacramental: and we have reason to think that the Spirit of God worketh faith and holiness in them, at least habitually, immediately. In the Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents, it hath a very good end and design, <HI>viz.</HI> not only to lay them under a strong obligation of Duty, but also potently to en∣courage them to be strenuous in the doing of it, upon the good Hope which they do hence entertain, because it hath pleased God to make them his Sealed Ones, and to ap∣point that his name should be called upon them; and herein they glorify God, and the Apostle thought it a great encouragement to believing Parents for them to be acquainted that <HI>their Children were holy,</HI> 1 Cor. 7.14: but still,</P>
<P N="6">6. Infants dying in their Infancy cannot be charged with rejecting of Gods Covenant. It is true, <HI>they are by nature Children of wrath as well as others.</HI> They have a relation which they bear to the first <HI>Adam,</HI> and derive both Guilt and Pollution from him, by vertue whereof the Justice of God hath a righteous plea against them; they have a corrupt na∣ture cleaving to them in their very concep∣tion and birth, and they sadly shew it as
<PB N="86" REF="000583_0089_0FA71400513B3970"/>
soon as they come to a capacity of doing a∣ny humane actions. But if we look to the Gospel Covenant, which God hath seen meet in his Soveraign Pleasure to extend unto them, they have for the present done nothing at all against it: they have never despised a Saviour, nor turned their backs upon Sal∣vation, they have never said unto Christ, depart from us: they have indeed a nature in them prone enough to do this; they have congenerate principles which adhere to them by vertue of Original Sin, which would lead them unto all this in time, if not graci∣ously prevented: but the act they are at present incapable of, and this also affords a good supply of encouragement unto parents, to consider that God hath taken away their Children before they ever d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d practically renounce his Covenant which he had taken them under; and hereby hath prevented them of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any such consideration to exercise their minds withal.</P>
<P N="7">7. We no where read in the Scripture that the Children of Godly ones dying in their infancy did eternally perish. Tho' we know that Gods Electing Grace is free, and that there is no express word of promise upon this account, God having seen meet to reserve his own Counsels in this affair within his Bo∣some; yet there is this farther to encourage our hopes, that we do not find in the Word
<PB N="87" REF="000583_0090_0FA7140342B71568"/>
of God, either such a Doctrine delivered, or such an example recorded, that any one such did miscarry. That <HI>David</HI> had any particular revelation extraordinary we read not, (and we may well enough, according to the tenour of Faith suppose that he had not) about that Child of his, and yet, tho' it were begotten in Adultery, and he had followed that with Murder, and other grie∣vious sins; upon his true repentance, and his fasting and praying in particular for that Child, he is enabled to Comfort himself with this Hope, 2. <HI>Sam.</HI> 12.23. <HI>I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</HI> For it would be a poor argument of comfort we must think him to draw, if we suppose he argued only from a consideration of his own Death; nor could he expect or desire to go to him, but upon the Hope that he was gone to Glory.</P>
<P N="8">8. We are fully assured that there are multitudes of such as these are now in the kingdome: The word of God is very clear and plain for this▪ It was the argument which our Saviour Christ used to encourage their bringing of little children to him, when his Disciples would have prohibited them, <HI>math.</HI> 19.13.14. <HI>of such is the kingdom of Heaven</HI>; which text of Scripture assures us both that Jesus Christ hath a special favour for children, and that they are the Subjects
<PB N="88" REF="000583_0091_0FA71404E28908B0"/>
of his Grace and Glory; By the word [Such] cannot be meant such in quality, or dispositi∣on, as some would go about to put us off, for why did Christ take these little Children into his arms, &amp; Bless them? they whom he Blesseth are Blessed indeed: the meaning therefore plainly is, of such as dy in that age, that are taken away in their infancy: and there is a great deal of reason to draw this inference from it, that there are more of that than of any other Age, in Heaven.</P>
<P N="9">9. And they are not incapable of haveing the Gospel condition wrought in them, it is true, they are not in a capacity of being regenerated by the ordinary means which are appointed for the conversion of adult per∣sons; they cannot attend upon the Preach∣ing of the word, they cannot be taught by the counsels and instructions of parents, be∣cause they are not able to understand any thing in this way; but there are some means which they are capable of having used for them, and because God hath appointed them, we may hope for his Blessing upon them; they may be Baptized, and they may be pray∣ed for; and the Spirit of God is able to do all that for them which they want in order to their being made meet for the Inheritance. They have Humane Souls which are subjects capable of being Sanctified, aad purged by his Holy Operation upon them; and tho'
<PB N="89" REF="000583_0092_0FA71406582F5478"/>
he hath tied us to the use of the means ac∣cording to our advantage, yet he is not himself tied up, so as not to do it for them: Divines Generally suppose that <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> and <HI>John Baptist,</HI> were Sanctified in the womb: I dispute it not, but I am sure this is not too hard for God, &amp; he hath done it, because there are many such Glorified.</P>
<P N="10">10. And there have been some Children that even in their Infancy made a good disco∣very of their seriousness, according to the measure of their capacity of understanding the things of God, yea and beyond what could ordinarily be supposed to have been in them: though their understanding hath been small, yet there hath appeared in them the favour of some breathings after Christ, herein hath God been pleased to shew his power; Possibly <HI>Jeroboams</HI> Son was such an one; in whom <HI>There was some good towards the Lord God of Israel.</HI> And this also is a great encouragement to Hope; and when all these things are put together, they will certainly af∣ford matter of releif.</P>
<P N="2">2. We may now proceed to consider this with respect to adult persons. Or such as dy after they are grown up to years of under∣standing; and see what Hope there is which we may entertain ourselves withal concer∣ning them, and how far there may be the ex∣ercise of it for our support under the sorrow
<PB N="90" REF="000583_0093_0FA71406F5C2D528"/>
that we feel for the loss of them: and here I shall first give some general Rules, and af∣terwards apply them to the particular respects▪ In general then.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Covenant promise is made to man upon Condition. It hath been already observed: that it is the New-Cove∣nant which gives men all their hopes: from thence they do derive; Now that as well as the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d-one, is a conditional Covenant. The Promise, according as it is revealed in the Gospel, is not absolute, it is not there decla∣red to be made to these and those men par∣ticularly and personally, but it is offered un∣to all where the Gospel comes, upon terms which are proposed for their acceptance: and indeed it could not be a Covenant Promise if it did not bear such a tenour: for it is Essen∣tial to a Covenant that it always hath in it a mutual stipulation. Gods Decrees are ab∣solute but his Covenant, in which he transacts with the Children of men, is exhibited with Articles in it, which are proposed, in which God requires of men that they should thus do and makes a promise of Salvation to them upon their complyance w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th him; thus there∣fore were the Apostles commanded to Preach the Gospel, <HI>Mark.</HI> 16.15 16. And thus <HI>Paul</HI> proposeth it <HI>in Rom.</HI> 8.13. The Precept therefore and the promise connected together exhibit the Covenant.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="91" REF="000583_0094_0FA71407BA53A400"/>2. That except this Condition be wrought in them, they cannot be saved. That with∣out it they cannot lay any claim unto salva∣tion; and there is neither injury nor false dealing in God, if he with-hold it from them: this is very evident, because the Gos∣pel promise which is declared unto men, hath brought him no farther under obligation unto them, than according to the terms of it. If he should deny Salvation unto him that doth believe, he would not be so good as his word, because he hath ingaged it to all such, and made it their encouragment to be∣lieve, Joh. 3.16. <HI>that whosoever believes in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life</HI>: but if he with-hold it from an unbeliever, he is just, because he hath not performed the condition upon which it was tendered to him. But besides this, there is no hope that he ever will save such an one; nay he can∣not bestow salvation upon any without the condition wrought in them: no unbeliever can be saved in his unbelief, because God should be equally false to his Creature in sa∣ving such an one, as in denying Salvation to the other; in as much as there is a Co∣venant threatning which includes this man in it, and hath something to say to him which must be accomplished upon him, and that is, <HI>he must be damned, Mark</HI> 16.16. there is no room therefore for any indul∣gence
<PB N="92" REF="000583_0095_0FA714087279A568"/>
to such an one, nor will Gods Holi∣ness or Truth allow of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This also must be before they dy. The working of the Gospel condition in us, depends upon the Grace of God, and except he puts it in▪ to us we shall never have it: and he gives to none but here in this life,</HI> this is the only ac∣cepted time, and day of salvation; <HI>there is no business to be done in the grave, and nothing of this nature left to be accomplished in another world: now only is working time, then every one comes to have his reward, and that is to be di∣stributed to every one</HI> according to the things done in the flesh, 2 Cor. 1.10. <HI>Death dis∣poseth of men to their everlasting Vnchangeable Estate. It puts an end to the Gospel treaty, and brings every man to, and lodgeth him in</HI> that place from whence he shall return no more·</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The reality of this work is a secret which no other can infallibly discern: The Saving change in a man is somthing inward: the sincerity of it lies in the heart; and that must be much out of our knowledge; It is Gods alone preroga∣tive to</HI> Search <HI>and</HI> judge <HI>of that. All that l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves within our compass to do about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, is at most but conjectural, and the best conclusion that we can draw, is no more than that it is strongly p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>obable that it m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y be so: though saving grace hath its marks or characters, yet because they are spiritual, there is none that can certainly know them, but he that gives them, and he
<PB N="93" REF="000583_0096_0FA714092E2E6EF8"/>
that</HI> hath received them: But as to what is visible to us. Grace hath its counterfeit; and there are those that can ape it so handsomly, that a discerning Christian, with all his ob∣servation cannot see into the imposture: &amp; by reason of this, there is many a false Hypo∣crite that passeth with him for a sincere Christian, and many an upright soul, because of his great infirmities is suspected by him, he doubts of him whether he be right or no.</P>
<P N="5">5. Yet there are the fruits of this change which are brought forth by such as live after their Conversion. They can bring forth no∣thing before, for where there is no grace, there can be no exercise of it; and if they dy immediately upon it, as it may be pre∣sumed that some do, they are deprived of the opportunity to discover it in an holy life, and God will accept of the will, and not deny his own Grace which he hath cre∣ated in them by his Almighty power; but if they are spared, and have a season allow∣ed to them, they will more or less discover some encouraging symptoms of a work of God wrought in their hearts, by a life and conversation ordered according to the will of God, therein <HI>shewing forth the vertues of him that hath called them.</HI> They are regene∣rated to this end; and the Spirit of God will aid them in it; and so far as we disco∣ver any of these things, our hope will receive
<PB N="94" REF="000583_0097_0FA71409EFE27028"/>
a lift from thence, to conclude that they have received the Grace of God, and that there∣fore <HI>the well ordered and Everlasting Covenant</HI> is made with them; and the inferences which we shall draw from thence must needs be comfortable.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Hence, as these fruits are more or less apparent, so will the strength of our hope con∣cerning them be more or less. This being the ground of the Evidence which affords to our hope its support, it can be no stronger than the ground is upon which it is built: and because this doth not shew it self forth in all alike, our hopes concerning them must have different degrees of clearness and comfortableness: concerning some therefore we can have but weak and faint hopes, and those that are mixt with a great deal of fear and suspicion; whereas in respect of o∣thers they are strong, prevailing, comforting and satisfying hopes, which enable us to rejoyce in them, and rest with abundance of quiet upon our spirits, that it is now well with them, and that their Change is for the better. The particular application of these things will now follow.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. There are some who have been Re∣ligious from their very Childhood, and held on so until their death. They began early <HI>to seek after God,</HI> and have led a pious and exemplary life ever since, faithfuly serving of God in a careful and conscientious obser∣ving of his commands; they have not on∣ly
<PB N="95" REF="000583_0098_0FA7140D15B49848"/>
been blameless, but patterns for others imitation: they have <HI>made a good Profession,</HI> and brought a great deal of Honour to God in their place and generation, <HI>their light hath so shined that men have seen their good works and glorified God for them</HI>: They have chear∣fully both done and suffered for Christ: have been exceeding watchful over themselves, &amp; taken a great deal of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d in the discharging of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> relative and personal Duties incumbent on them, in obedience to God: and mean while have solemnly professed to renounce utterly all reliance upon themselves or their own righteousness, depending upon Christ a∣lone for the acceptance of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r persons and services: and they have lived very humbly as well as Conscientiously, When such as these are come to dy there is abundant Hope, concerning them, for they have all the disco∣veries upon them, by which we are advanta∣ged to Judge of mens being truly pious, and in a good estate: these are the visible Cha∣racters which the Scripture gives us to look upon as the notes of good and Holy men, yea of such as are eminently so: they do there∣fore command this Hope from us, they leave a precious name behind them, their very memory is blessed, and we have a good confidence concerning them; &amp; tho it is not impossible but that men may dissem∣ble Holiness so artificially as to impose up∣on
<PB N="96" REF="000583_0099_0FA711E66C23FCE0"/>
the credit of the Godly, and the dissimu∣lation never be discovered in this life, yet we have no reason to suspect such as these, or to entertein doubts and jealousies in our minds about them, since there is nothing else to be seen by us in them, but what calls for our good opinion of them. Our Saviour Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rects us to Judge of them by <HI>their fruits Math.</HI> 7.16. they <HI>keep faith and a good conscience</HI> to our observation; and such as these are declared to be happy in their Death, <HI>Psal.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7.37. <HI>Take notice of the per∣fect man, mark the upright for the end of that man is peace.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Others there be who have had a very great visible change wrought upon them. It may be they have spent a great part of their life in vanity and debauchery; they wasted away their youthful dayes in folly, and spent many of their riper years in notorious wick∣edness; they lived in a woful neglect of Du∣ty, and would not hearken to the Counsels give<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them whether in private or in publick; they have fallen into gross and scandalous sins, such as Drunkeness Whoredom, Theft, Sabbath-Breaking, Scoffing at Godliness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And they refused to be reformed, they would not bear to be reproved, but would rail, and revile at those that offered to check them in their Carreer's, But God at length met with them in their Career, and stopt them in it,
<PB N="97" REF="000583_0100_0FA711E73524E390"/>
knockt them down, as he did <HI>Paul,</HI> brought them to his foot, made them to taste the bitterness of their sin, humbly and through∣ly to confess and bewail all their former fol∣lies, and utterly to renounce them with their whole heart, and to betake themselves to him in Christ for pardon and healing: and hereupon there is a very notable change apparent in them to the observation of all they converse with; they do now as much hate their sins as formerly they delighted in them, and they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re as eagerly set for the ways of God and Holiness, as formerly they slighted and abominated them; and are as zealously engaged to promote the interest of Christ in the world, as they sometimes were to serve the designs of Satan and their own lusts. An eminent instance of such an one was <HI>Man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sseh</HI>; see 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 33. <HI>beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</HI> com∣pare, <HI>verse</HI> 15, 16. and though <HI>Paul</HI> were not a Debauch, yet he had been a virulent enemy of Christ, see what he saith of him∣self, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.19. and yet afterwards be <HI>la∣bour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for Christ, more than all the Apostles,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.10. and indeed there is no one in the world that affords more matter for hope than such an one; there being so eminent a change brought about in him from one contrary to another; that it must needs be so much the more observable: and although it is not to be denied but that legal co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vi∣ctions
<PB N="98" REF="000583_0101_0FA711E7ED285550"/>
and terrors, may work a great moral change in a mans Conversation, without the product<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of a real saving change in his heart; yet it speaks to us as fair for it▪ as any one thing that we can know: the Church <HI>glorified God for Paul,</HI> when they heard what an alteration was made in him, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.24. and such as these will be illust∣rious instances of the rich Grace of God in the great day of Accounts: when therefore such persons dy, we may and ought to have strong hopes concerning them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>There are some who only lead a sober and civil life among men. They make no great o∣pen profession of piety, they are not in their ca∣riage and dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtment of themselves, zealous for the promoting of the interest of Religion, though they discover nothing against it, but shew a fa∣vour for it; they live honestly and quietly a∣mong men; they are neither drawn into d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bau∣cheries with lewd men, nor to the strict duties of pie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y with Godly men; though they attend upon the commodities of Religion: thus they live, and thus they dy; there is very little can be said for them, and very little against them.</HI> Con∣cerning such as these let these two things be observed.</P>
<P N="1">1. Here is very little if any ground for a positive and concluding Hope concerning such as these are. And why? because there wants something that is positive for such an
<PB N="99" REF="000583_0102_0FA711E8B6DC6B18"/>
Hope to build upon: and such as the ground are, such the Hope must needs be. It is cer∣tain that where there is no Saving Grace wrought in men, there is no Foundation of Salvation laid in them; and Grace, where∣ever it is, is an active princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ple: and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it be not alike active in all men, yet it can no further appear than we make the discovery of the actings of it, or of something that c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rries such a resemblance in it, that we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> able to argue concluding and affirmatively concer∣ning any: If we know nothing by them, it follows that we can determine nothing con∣cerning them. Restraint from enormous sins, and doing of moral duties to men among whom they live, and maintaining of a form of Godliness &amp; practised duties in the profes, sion of Religion, as, going to hear the word preached, reading the Scriptures and praying in the Family, and externally Sanctifying the Sabbath: though they are in themselves commendable, yet they are such common things among professors, that they speak ve∣ry little positively, especially where in con∣junction with them there is nothing made of any thing more than a kind of ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffe∣rency.</P>
<P N="2">2. Yet there is a considerable deal of a neg∣ative Hope that may be entertained for such as these; in as much as they have had a great deal of Gods restraining Grace on them, and
<PB N="100" REF="000583_0103_0FA711E9DD9764C8"/>
though that may be where there is no Sa∣ving Grace, yet many times it is a fruit of such an inward principle: Besides, there is corruptton in the best, and that many times hath not only a great influence into but also much of Prevalency upon the natural temper or constitution which is in men. There are some constitutions in men, which will make a great deal of shew with a little Grace and there are others that can make but a very small appearance of a great deal: and if we give to men these allowances, which Christian Charity requires from one to ano∣ther, we may lawfully Hope, that there might be the root of the matter in them, al∣though they did not make so great a dis∣covery of it as could have been desi∣red.</P>
<P N="4">4. Some there be whose conversation is good and commendable, and their profession is very desireable: only they stand off from holding Communion with the Church of Christ at the Lords Table: and under this circumstance they live and dy: and there are too many who so do, and this consideration becomes a stumbling block, and occasion of many heart searchings in their friends when they come to dy in this Condi∣tion: and truly it is not without a great deal of reason: for out of doubt it is a duty in∣cumbent on all adult persons living under
<PB N="101" REF="000583_0104_0FA711EA6551C5A0"/>
the means of Grace, and making profession of the true Religion, not to rest satisfied without a due preparation for, and actual fellowship in all the ordinances of the Gos∣pel: every one that is at years of discre∣tion who turns his back upon a Sacra∣ment, doth therin offer an open contempt to the Lord Jesus Christ. If he be not sit∣ted for it, <HI>the sin lies at his own door,</HI> if he be and doth not come, how can he answer it? and therefore it must needs bring a cloud upon all his other profession, which will much darken it: and for a person to live and dy under the neglect of a known duty, and that of so great importance as this is, which Christ hath required every one that hath the least love for him, to attend upon <HI>in remembrance of him,</HI> hath not a little of reflection in it: many therefore, when they come to lie upon a Death-bed, have terrible agonies in their thoughts about it, and make little complaints against them∣selves upon the account, promising that if ever God gives them a further opportunity they will reform it: and if persons do live without this Communion contentedly, and carelesly, it speaks as much against them, as all their other Religious Conversation can speak for them. But still there may be that which will give encouragement to our Hope
<PB N="102" REF="000583_0105_0FA711EEB7CD2800"/>
concerning such as do dy in such a condition as this.</P>
<P N="1">1. If their abstinence from this Commu∣nion be not from contempt of the Ordi∣nance, but a jealousie which they have con∣cerning themselves, There are those that have upon them a deep sense that they want the benefit of this Ordinance, and that Jesus Christ hath made it their duty to seek after it; but they are possessed with a great deal of fear, they apprehend in themselves a great deal of unworthiness: and unfitness for such a thing as this; and they are a∣fraid that if they should come they should abuse it, and thereby eat and drink their <HI>own Damnation:</HI> the danger of that afrights them, and they cannot tell how to get over it. Though this be sinful, yet it may be allowed by us to their infirmity, and that which they are striving against: yea it argues positively thus much, <HI>viz.</HI> that there is something of seriousness in these persons; and if God please to take them away before they can obtain to have their minds cleared and satisfied in this point, he knows how to pardon this infirmity to them.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> If the Church Communion be clogged with unwarrantable terms. And such are all those that are not of Christs own in in∣stituting, what plausible pretence soever they
<PB N="103" REF="000583_0106_0FA711EF6F139AF0"/>
may carry in them. There are some which men cannot comply with, unless they will sin against the precept directly: and there are others which men can see no warrant for their being required of them, nor can they find a willingness in their own minds to do such things as Jesus Christ hath no where made their Duty; and this keeps them off. For the former, their abstinence is their commendation, and that man who can live without the Sacrament, rather than defile his conscience for enjoyment of it, commends his sincerity to the Consciences of others. For the latter, I would say: though <HI>I</HI> verily be∣lieve that the terms of Communion are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Ordinance of Christ, and must have a word of Institution to warrant them, and that accor∣ding to the Gospel, Orthodoxy in the profes∣sion of the Truths of the Christian Religion, under which is comprized a knowledge of these truths; and this attended with a <HI>Conversation that becomes the Gospel of Christ,</HI> is that which is the ground of our reputing them believers and receiving them into our fellowship: and whatsoever more is required as a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est</HI> is <HI>supra stat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tum</HI>; yet I also believe that there are some things, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch, though not regularly re∣quired, may with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut sin be complied with, and never trouble him that doth so, either li∣ving or dying: and it will be no comfort in a dying hour to think, I kept my self off need∣lesly:
<PB N="104" REF="000583_0107_0FA711F14BF35768"/>
but here also there is hope, where it is not done upon open Contempt.</P>
<P N="3">3. They have given Testimony on their Death-bed of their sincere Repentance of such neglects, and sought to God for his forgiveness of them through Christ, herein they have manifested to us that they have tasted the bitterness of such a sin, and God knows how to pardon them, and we may Hope that he hath remitted it to them, and accepted of them in his rich grace.</P>
<P N="5">5. There are some that dy with a great deal of Comfort, &amp; professed Hope, &amp; possi∣bly assurance of their good estate, and joyful expectation of the Glory to be revealed in them. They are both ready and willing to dy, and speak very comfortably concerning their after estate in another world; and this gives abundance of encouragement and comfort to their friends, and they are often ready to solace themselves in it. But the ground of this Hope is warily to be conside∣red. It is indeed a very desireable thing in it self, to stand by and hear our dying Friend testifying of a good hope, for a blessed eter∣nity. But then that which must derive strength to our Hope from hence must be gathered, not from the meer confidence of such a profession made by them, but by put∣ting other circumstances thereto: And
<PB N="105" REF="000583_0108_0FA711F28848FCA8"/>
there are these two more Especi∣ally.</P>
<P N="1">1. If there be a good agreement between their life and their Death. For us to hear one that hath <HI>lived in all good Conscience,</HI> and hath approved himself <HI>faithful unto God in his generation,</HI> now at last bearing a full Testimony to the love of God to him, in his life, and <HI>rejoycing in Christ his Saviour,</HI> and the expectation of his Glory at his death, singing with Good <HI>Simeon, Luk.</HI> 2.29.30. <HI>Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy Salvation.</HI> This is a precious and Heart-Ravishing thing and gives abundant cause of boasting Hopes concerning such an one. <HI>But to hear one that hath lived wickedly, vainly, profanely, all his days, that hath neglected duties to God and men, never testified any love to Jesus Christ and his ways all his life long, while he enjoyed health, and strength, and opportunity, nor yet so much as witnessed Godly sorrow and repentance for his formerly mispent life.</HI> On his sick-bed▪ Talking of his Comforts and Assurances, and discoursing of Death and Eternity with a Sedate and Composed frame, is a most Asto∣nishing thing, and so far from strengthning, that it weakens, nay let me say it extinguish∣eth the Hopes of any considerate Christian concerning such an one: and serves to fill him with doubts and despairing fears about
<PB N="106" REF="000583_0109_0FA711F33207C128"/>
him. We read of those who▪ despise God in their lives, and yet have <HI>no bonds in their death,</HI> and he looks just like one of these▪ and this looks like the effect of a <HI>seared con∣science,</HI> accompanied with the delusions of Satan.</P>
<P N="2">2. If it be accompanied with a Suitable Frame of Spirit, When this professed con∣fidence is waited upon with great <HI>self</HI> abase∣ment, and <HI>self</HI> abhorrency, with adoration of, and admi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation at the riches of free Grace <HI>which</HI> hath appeared <HI>in</HI> the <HI>giving</HI> of <HI>Him this</HI> Hope; acknowledging his utter unworthi∣ness of it, and ascribing <HI>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> all to the undeser∣ved mercy of God <HI>in Jesus Christ,</HI> extended to him who was as bad as others, and had done nothing to merit this, but the quite contrary: here <HI>is</HI> good matter of thinking well of, and rejoycing with such an one; Whereas when men draw <HI>their</HI> comforts, and <HI>satisfying</HI> conclusions from themselves: they thank God they have loved <HI>him</HI> always, they <HI>have kept his Commandments from thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> youth,</HI> they never sinned as these and those have done, and the result of all centers <HI>in</HI> what they have been and done, and they seem to rest upon <HI>their</HI> own Righteousness, or only upon the general notion of Gods mercy, and his good will to mankind, and they there∣fore conclude that he will have mercy upon them, these confidences are poor and shallow,
<PB N="107" REF="000583_0110_0FA711F3FA824198"/>
and may be exprest by an <HI>unjustified Phar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>, Luk.</HI> 18.11. <HI>with</HI> 14.</P>
<P N="6">6. There are some that dy in a Cloud. They labour of a great deal of doubting and jealousy, and fear about their own everlast∣ing <HI>estate,</HI> by reason of which disquietment they cannot dy with that willingness, and chearfulness, and resignation unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od, that many others do: they are wofully afraid of mistakes, presumptions, false and deceiving Hopes, and this terrifies them, and indeed, this cannot but afford grief and trouble to those that sit about them: But yet it may be no impediment to our good Hopes concerning them, whiles there are other substantial argu∣ments to fortify them withal, for.</P>
<P N="1">1. Actual Assurance proceeds from the joynt <HI>witnessing of the Spirit of God with our Spirit, Rom.</HI> 8.16. till therefore he seals, and confirms, and testifies to our evidences, we shall for all them remain in suspense. A man may have really in him <HI>the things which accompany salvation,</HI> and have also such a discovery made to him, of their being in him, which he dares not to deny, and yet be much afraid of himself, suspect a mistake, and question whether they be not counter∣feit: his confident and comfortable perswa∣sion of the truth and reality of these things depends upon the confirmation given by the Spirit of God to his soul: but this not∣withstanding,
<PB N="108" REF="000583_0111_0FA711F4AB9A1048"/>
his State is mean while as safe and secure, as if he had the greatest sa∣tisfaction about it, though it be not so clear to him; he shall as certainly be saved as another, though he be not so well satisfied in himself concerning it; where God gives Grace, he will without fail give Salvation.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Spirit of God is soveraign in the giv∣ing in this Testimony of his to the soul. He acts in it according to his own Wisdom and good pleasure. Gracious Souls have, in their life∣time felt of his with-drawing this witness from them upon these and those occasions, yea some∣times the most holy and consciencious men may be without it, they may</HI> fear the Lord, and o∣bey the voice of his Servant, and yet sit in darkness and see no light, <HI>Isa.</HI> 50.10. <HI>and the same holy wisdom of his may see meet to sus∣pend it at their death, as well as any other time; for who shall prescribe or set limits to him, who is not to be taught or directed by the creature, nor giveth</HI> to us an account of his <HI>acti∣ons.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence, if such an one hath liued like a Christian, and so as becomes Godliness. This can be no ground of weakning our Hope about their everlasting welfare: his latter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd shall be peace for all this: though we observe nothing but doubts and fears, yet he shall find to his eternal joy, that the very moment in which his soul de∣parts from his body, he is put out of all his fears,
<PB N="109" REF="000583_0112_0FA711F5726D5510"/>
and when it falls among the Blessed Life-guard of Glorious Angels, who are sent to bring him home to the Kingdom, and lay him in the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣some of his Blessed Redeemer, he shall then know himself happy: we may believe that God hath gracious ends in this thing, to humble him, and to do him good by it.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Though such cannot express that boast∣ing confidence which others can, yet they may discover to our charity as much grace as others do. They may under this very cloud and darkness, express their endeared love to the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Jesus Christ, their earnest longings to see his face and be with him, their humble sense of their own unworthiness of his mercy, Justifying of him in this very dis∣pensation of his unto them; their entire hatred of sin, and their deep self loathing by reason of it: their insatiable desires after Christ, and everlasting communion with him, the earnest breathings of their souls after more holiness, and whatsoever else is the proper fruit of Saving Grace in the Souls of Gods Children: and the observation of these things will give us a better founda∣tion to build our hopes in respect to them upon, than the great confidence which many do express; because it is from such things as these are, that we fetch our arguments to perswade us that that is right and not deceiving.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="110" REF="000583_0113_0FA711F6FA955080"/>7. Some that have lived soberly in their Child-hood, have afterwards been drawn into leud courses, and would not hearken to counsel, neither of their Godly Parents, nor faithful Ministers, till God came to lay them upon a sick and Death-bed, and then they have had terrible awakenings and Con∣victions, and made solemn confessions both to God and man, taken shame to themselves earnestly begged of God for pardon, and possibly also have testified some hopes that they have conceived hereupon of mercy and acceptance with God, and we have occasion to take notice of several such cases as these are; and concerning our Hopes about such, I would offer these two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. They cannot be so strong but that they must needs be attended with no small fears too▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this is not without reason: they cannot be so prevailing because we had not the opportunity to see the trial of the sin∣cerity of this repentance of theirs. The terrours of Death, and the apprehensions of eternity just now to be entred into, and the consideration of the dreadful miseries of ungodly men, may well put men into ter∣rible agonies, and bring their sins to remem∣brance, and make them to vomit up their morsels which before lay indigested upon their Consciences, drive them to making Confessions, to begging of pardon, and war∣ning
<PB N="111" REF="000583_0114_0FA711F9C9DB3950"/>
of others, in particular their Compa∣nions to beware of the like; and yet this may be but a legal work: we have seen some that under the terrors of Death have done the like, and yet recovering again, they <HI>Re∣turned to their vomit, and wallowing in the mire</HI>; and that God should make it a com∣mon thing to give Repentance unto life up∣on a Death-bed, to such as despised his Grace all their lives before, is a thing scarce∣ly to be thought of.</P>
<P N="2">2. Yet may we have some support to our hearts under this. To be sure it it is a thou∣sand times better to see a sinner dye under the sense and burden of his sins, bitterly be∣wailing of them, than in a senceless stupid frame, as too many are observed to do; and not only so, but though we may not dare to assert a frequency of this manner of applica∣tion, lest sinners should be encouraged to de∣lay until then: so we may not deny a Sove∣raignty to the Grace of God, extendible hi∣therto, that he can take his own time, and if it be at last who shall forbid him? yea and farther than so too, for God also hath some∣times done such a thing, there is instance for it in the Scripture, that so all our hopes may not uttterly be cut off▪ from encouraging us about such as those over whom when they are ready to depart we stand with bleeding Hearts: the very example of the Thief upon
<PB N="112" REF="000583_0115_0FA711FA5A11FB10"/>
the Cross, whose dying repentance was ac∣cepted, declares it to be possible: and God is able to glorify his Grace more peculiarly by Saving of <HI>such</HI> an one who is born out of time, and called into his Kingdom, after the <HI>eleventh hour</HI> is current. And farther more if <HI>such</HI> an one hath been a Child of a great many prayers, and tears, and heart-breakings, <HI>if it be such</HI> an one unto whom you have been very faithful in Duty? and for whom you have been very impor∣tunate with God that he would turn him, and though you have with grief and sorrow taken notice how he hath slighted your Counsels and trampled upon your reproofs, yet this hath not made you leave off doing your duty, to him, or to be willing to let God alone upon his account, but made you the more urgent and earnest; you may well Hope that God is now at last come to an∣swer your prayers and endeavours, and sig∣nalize his grace to them, by <HI>plucking them out of the fire</HI> which they were just drop∣ping into.</P>
<P N="8">8. Some there be who have spent their days in wickedness, and have given no Te∣stimony at all either at or before their death of their Repentance, either God hath taken them away by some sudden stroak, in a speedy and violent death, they have gone in a moment to the grave; or they have
<PB N="113" REF="000583_0116_0FA711FCA4F99380"/>
fallen into some violent sickness, which hath at once bereaved them of the use of their understanding, and they have died distracted without any the least capacity ei∣ther of receiving counsel, or of giving glory to God by a free and humble confession of their sins: or, with <HI>Nabal,</HI> they have <HI>lain like a stone,</HI> and had no sense at all of any spiritual thing upon them. Such instances also there are not a few; and the Friends of such may well enquire, what Hope can we have?</P>
<P>Concerning such as these it must needs be confessed, that their fears are very great and amazing, and their hopes can be but very small: but yet give me leave to offer these rules to be considered.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is the duty of all such silently and submissively to adore the Divine Soveraign¦ty, God is free in the dispensing of his grace, and <HI>he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy</HI>; and it is too much boldness for the Chil∣dren of men to call him to give <HI>an account of any of these matters.</HI> It is recorded con∣cerning <HI>Aaron,</HI> that when his two elder Sons were slain <HI>by a fire from Heaven,</HI> in the very act of <HI>offering strange fire unto God, that he hold his peace, Lev.</HI> 10 3▪ and of <HI>Eli,</HI> that when the most dismal threatning of the fear∣ful destruction of his two wicked Sons was delivered unto him, he said, <HI>It is the Lord,
<PB N="114" REF="000583_0117_0FA711FCEC6E11B8"/>
let him do what seemeth him good,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3.18 <HI>David</HI> indeed was excessive in his mourning for his fondling▪ <HI>Absalom,</HI> but he met with a sharp rebuke for it: God hath required it of us as a great duty, to fall down before him and worship him in the most severe of his dispensations towards us.</P>
<P N="2">2. Not only is Gods absolute Supremacy, but his Righteousness to be acknowledged by us in such a case. Though the thing be terrible, yet he hath done nothing but what is just and equal in what he hath done; no∣thing but what we had reason to live in continual expectation of: he hath warned us of, and threatned such things as these, that such as go on boldly in their trans∣gressions and will not be reclaimed, shall pe∣rish, and that quickly too; <HI>Prov.</HI> 29.1. <HI>He that being often reproved, hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy</HI>; he hath declared that <HI>strange Judg∣ments</HI> do wait for, and shall fall upon such refractory ones as these: and they that will live wickedly under all the means of grace, and strivings of Gods Spirit with them from time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o time, have a great deal of reason to look for Gods Hand to overtake them every day, and when it doth thus fall out, it is no new or strange thing. <HI>God is holy</HI> in all these ways of his, and just in all these doings.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="115" REF="000583_0118_0FA711FF1B2639D0"/>3. Such providences do loudly call us to a more serious and deep reflection upon our selves and our own ways. This is a crying voice from God unto us, to put us upon the taking of a more str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct account how we have carried our selves towards God, and towards them too: whether we have not given him provocation by some grievous sin so to smite us, and whether we have not been greatly negligent in the doing of our duty towards them, when we had the opportunity and many fair advantages for it. This should humble us low before God, and put us upon the renewing of our Repentance, and peace with him; and by thus doing we shall have hope concerning our selves, that such an aw∣ful Providence as this is, shall <HI>work for our good</HI>; and so it shall <HI>turn also to our account,</HI> and make us the more careful to our selves, and over others, who are yet within the reach of our using the means with and for the bringing of them to obtain salvation.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It may be no little relief and support to the spirits of Gods Children even at such a time as this is, to be able to say that they have been faithful in doing of their duty to such. If whilst they were with us, and we had the oppor∣tunity, we prayed earnestly for them, carefully endeavoured to set before them a pious exam∣ple in all the duties of Religion, and godly con∣versation; if we have taken unwearied pains
<PB N="116" REF="000583_0119_0FA711FF2B4D3098"/>
with them in counselling, reproving, restraining them, according to our best discretion, and as we have had opportunity; it will be a great relief unto us; for God will acknowledge our sincerity, and our</HI> labour shall not be lost, <HI>nor</HI> our prayers return empty.</P>
<P N="5">5. We do not know what God may have done for them by a secret work in the <HI>interim.</HI> This is not to be doubted of▪ but that he can do his work suddenly; though woe to them who will boldly run the risque of such a thing. But he may have had mercy upon them, <HI>inter pon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em &amp; fon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em,</HI> it is not impossible but that his spirit may have wrought in them ef∣fectually; though if he have, it is not fit∣ting that it should be known by us, lest the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e should be a shameful abuse made of it; yet the thing is not in it self an impossibility: and though it can be but a very languishing one, yet where there remaineth a <HI>who knows</HI>? hope is not without all relief.</P>
<P N="6">6. And if we are those that fear God (and it is of no other that I am now speak∣ing) it will but a little while before we shall be fully satisfied. If we should go mourning to the grave under the remem∣brance of such a thing as this is, yet it should be a support to us under that mour∣ning; so as that it may not sink us, &amp; dis∣tract us in the work God calls us to, to consider, that when we come to the King∣dom,
<PB N="117" REF="000583_0120_0FA712006E61BBC8"/>
and shall there have all our weaknesses and imperfections done away, we shall then take everlasting satisfaction in all that God hath done; and the eternal glory which he will have by every one of the Children of Men, will be matter of our endless praises: and the hope of this should not be despised by us, in the deepest dumps that we are oppressed with all, by reason of such stupen∣dous Judgments of God.</P>
<P>The Doctrinal handling of this Truth ha∣ving been so much practical, the particular application may be very briefly dispatched: Here then,</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="application">
<HEAD>VSE I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>For Information; learn hence▪</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The great advantage that Gods people enjoy by the Gospel; and truly it is that which gives the Gospel no small commenda∣tion to the hearts of the Children of men; the consideration that it affords to men such an hope, from whence they may be deriving of those conclusions, the right improvement whereof will help to swallow up a great part of their sorrow, and make their Mourning to be comparatively next unto none: it pro∣vides and supplies us with such matter for hope to live upon, as hath solidity in it: hu∣mane

minds. Let us then be thankful to God, that we are born in times and places of Gospel light; and let us improve this ad∣vantage for our help and consolation, on all such distressing occasions as these which may befal us.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the composed Carriage of Gods people at the death and interment of their friends and relations, is to be commended. One great usefulness of Hope is to moderate Grief; and the moderating of that will pro∣duce a more sedate frame of Spirit, which will be discovered in the deportment of our selves: and not to improve it to this end and use, is <HI>to despise the Consolations of God▪</HI> which he hath provided for us, and therefore provided, because he would not have his people to be transported into excesses of sor∣row on s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch occasions. It is true, God hath allowed us to mourn; and it is an Honour that is put upon the remembrance of those that are departed, not to let them go without making it to appear that they were desired, and that the loss of them is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> af∣fliction to us; and it is a curse th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> hath been denounced against some, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they <HI>shall dy unlamented</HI>; it is also a blessing pro∣mised to others that they shall be mourned for, 1 Kings 14.13. <HI>all Israel shall mourn for him.</HI> But still, the Affecti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought to be under the Government of Reason, and much

</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="application">
<HEAD>VSE II.</HEAD>
<P>This may also serve to reprehend the im∣moderate mourning of Christians, <HI>as if they had no hope.</HI> It is true▪ we ought to bear a great deal one with another in Infirmities, and not to insult over such as are over much born down by them: but Gods People ought not to allow themselves in any such thing, but willingly admit of a reproof for it: and I hardly know any one thing in which they do more deserve it: how many be there who are like <HI>Rachel, they mourn for their Dead, and refuse to be comforted, because they are not?</HI> who seem to take a kind of a sullen contentment in nourish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng and giving way to sinking reflections on their spirits, whereby they may aggravate instead of mi∣tigating their Grief, and that both by inde∣cent words, and uncomely gestures? In words they express themselves so as if their loss were insupportable, their bereavement irreparable, murmuring against Gods Provi∣dence, charging him with hard dealing, and expressing prejudices against him: and in
<PB N="121" REF="000583_0124_0FA71203C1005900"/>
gestures carrying of themselves after such a manner as carries abundant reason to make them ashamed of. In summe, this rebuke speaks to such who;</P>
<P N="1">1. Mourn too much. Their lamentations are excessive, they out do in quantity: they can set no bounds to their sorrow, but suffer themselves to be quite over-whelmed; their grief drinks up their Spirits: leaves them no room or liberty to take any comfort in any of the other many mercies and blessings of God which are yet continued to them, or gi∣ving to him the due acknowledgement of them, but, as if their comforts were all gone at one stroak, they cast themselves into the current, and suffer themselves to be carried away in the stream of sorrow: and there is not one word to be thrust in or spoken to them which they will hear, they cannot bear to be told of any thing that might relieve them in the least, or convince them of their Duty of patient and submissive bearing the hand of God that is upon them; the very mention of such a thing puts them into the most violent transports of an ungoverned passion.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mourn too long. If it were only for the present, whilst their spirits are under a sudden surprize, and by reason thereof their sorrows are too hard for them, having got∣ten an advantage over them; although this
<PB N="122" REF="000583_0125_0FA71204A4BBF228"/>
is not to be Justified, yet it might better be allowed; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t when they settle themselves to it, and resolve to bid adieu to all joys any more; they go mourning from day to day, and year to year, and never strive to get themselves into any composed frame, and their minds stayed: this is altogether a fault to be reprehended, it calls for a sharp rebuke; this is at least Heathenish, if it be not a great deal worse.</P>
<P N="3">3. Their mourning puts them by their Du∣ties which they ow the constant performance of unto God. Any thing that obstructs a Christian Conversation, and takes men off from the service of God is to be reproved, and there are the Duties which we are called to a constant upholding of, and in so doing we express our faithfulness to God. The sorrow which drives us to more care and di∣ligence in these than before we used, is pro∣fitable for us; but that which puts us off from them, and so gives a check to our pro∣gress in holiness, is to be reprehended. All Christians are by Duty called to be spiritual <HI>Priests unto God,</HI> i. e. they are to offer up Sacrifices of Thanksgiving unto him in an holy life: now the <HI>Priest</HI> of old, was not <HI>to lay off his garments for mourning,</HI> i. e. he was not to unfit himself for the service of the Altar. If Gods Children do by their sorrow put themselves out of any disposi∣tion
<PB N="123" REF="000583_0126_0FA712054A90ECF0"/>
for the duties incumbent on them, they do amiss; and that this reproof may take effect upon us, let us consider;</P>
<P N="1">1. By thus doing you bring reproach up∣on Christianity. Every Christian ought to be concerned more for the honour of God, and credit of his Religion, then for any thing that respects himself. If it were a truth, that you should gratifie your selves by comply∣ing with your own inclinations in so doing, yet if in the mean while you di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shonour God and wound the credit of your profession, it is to be seriously thought of: and thus you do not a little, whatever you may think of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: the world will be ready to say, what is their profession better than ours, it will not teach them to carry it better in all conditi∣ons than we do? If we can manage our selves no more composedly with our Grace, than other men can do with meer Morality, what are we bettered by it? and indeed, all the discredit we thus get to our selves will refl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct upon the profession that we make.</P>
<P N="2">2. By this you put away those comforts from you, which God hath provided for, or at least makes the offer of unto you, what are those Gospel discoveries made for, wher∣in God doth so abundantly acquaint us with the happiness of his People after Death; those precious entertainments which they find with him, that glorious Heaven which
<PB N="124" REF="000583_0127_0FA7120602184CF8"/>
he hath prepared for them, those Eternal Joyes which they shall swim in in the King∣dom, that precious company, and those per∣fectly happifying fruitions which they are there advanced unto, but only to give us an occasion thereby to comfort our selves in consideration of those that are gone to that place? God would have his Children to live comfortably under all their losses, and hath provided abundantly for it; but you thrust all away from you, and thereby offer contempt to these comforts, and put an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣front upon God himself who offers them to you; and how unworthy a carriage is this?</P>
<P N="3">3. Thus also you give Satan very great advantage against you. They who give place to over bearing sorrow, do therein <HI>give place to the Devil.</HI> This is the reason that <HI>Paul</HI> gives why he would not have that scandalous person dealt over rigedly withal, 2 Cor. 2.7, 11. <HI>lest Satan should take advan∣tage</HI>; when we are in such a frame we lie dangerously open to his assaults, and he may easily batter us with his Temptations, a∣gainst which we then have but little heed to stand upon our guard: and if we refuse Gods consolations, we shall readily be brought to entertain Satans prejudices; then, how far he may draw us into sin by them, is not easy for us to determine, and that
<PB N="125" REF="000583_0128_0FA71206AD0B43E8"/>
will be sure to cost us sorrow in the sequel. Let Gods Children then be humbled for, and beware of indulging themselves in such things.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="application">
<HEAD>VSE III.</HEAD>
<P>Let it now be for a word of Exhortation to all that hear this Truth, that we labour to get, strengthen, and improve this Hope. Hath God graciously provided such an Hope for his people? let us then make it our own, and when we have gotten it, let us nourish it, and be in a readiness to make use of it at all times when Gods Provi∣dence calls us to have the occasion to im∣prove it.</P>
<P>To move us hereto, consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. You cannot well live without it in this world of change; and it will be very uncomfortable Travelling through this Wilderness without such a cordial to refresh your tired Spirits; for you must expect to meet with such occasions of sorrow as well as other men. Gods people are not to promise themselves <HI>a discharge from this War</HI> any more than other men: if they should be so foolish as to feed themselves up with an expectation of it, their experience would in a little time confute these expect∣at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons.
<PB N="126" REF="000583_0129_0FA712076F92BDD0"/>
Good men lose their Friends as well as bad; <HI>we see that wise men dy, as well as the foolish and bruitish, Psal.</HI> 49.11. and the more of these comforts that you do enjoy in this life, the more such bereavements you must expect to undergo: every one of them is mortal, and exposed to the common ca∣sualties by wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch God is wont to take men out of the world: and so much room as they have now gotten in your affections, so much sorrow you will be liable unto when they shall be taken away. Death hath as many ways to seiz them as it hath for o∣thers; and though godly men have more reason to hope for the sparing of the lives of theirs in a time of great Mortality by the judgments of God upon a sinning people, than the wicked and ungodly have; yet it must be acknowledged that in these things God doth his pleasure, <HI>That his Judgments are unsearchable, and his ways past our finding out.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 Such times will be hours of Temptation. All the affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctions in this life, are called <HI>Temptations, James</HI> 1.3. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.6. because where there is a trial in the things them∣selves, and that which both Satan and our own corrupt part in us are ready to make use of to tempt us withal, and draw us into some sin thereby; and when we lose our choicest comforts, there will be the sorest
<PB N="127" REF="000583_0130_0FA712082E040B68"/>
Temptations on that account: now we shall be ready to be full of thoughts about them, and our selves, and about God too, and that will hurry us, and put us out of hope, if we be not the more careful to our selves.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence your Affections will now have spe∣cial need for something to moderate them. When such Providences have set them on working, and given vent to them, yea opened a great Flood-gate for them to run out at, you will now be sure to find great occasion for something to give check to the exorbitancy of them; they will else be very unruly, and bear down your Rea∣son and Religion too before them, so as to preci∣pitate you into strange exorbitancies. Now there is nothing more proper or suitable for this purpose, than to have this hope by you, ready to clap in and stop the breach: if any thing will do, this will. If yoa can swim ashoar upon this plank, you will not need to fear drowning in the torrent of sorrow: the People of God ne∣ver made use of this really, but they found it profitable for their help at such a time.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is not the portion of all that live un∣der the Gospel to enjoy this Hope. There are indeed the offers of it made to all that sit under the Ordinances, and a way is pointed out unto them how they might come by it, but it is not every one that hath obtained a title to it so as to
<PB REF="000583_0131_0FA7120BCC2A3648"/>
be owner of it. It hath been before shewn, that it is the portion of none but such as have tru∣ly believed in Christ, but</HI> all men have not faith; <HI>no not all that are visible believers, they have not that faith which is here requisite: It is proper to Gods Elect; it belongs to Gods Is∣rael,</HI> but all are not Israel that are of Isra∣el: <HI>and it is a foolish thing to presume of it, except you have made it yours by coming under the Covenant promise: and it will be a woful unhappiness now to arrogate it, and when you come to have urgent occasion to make use of it, then to find that it doth not belong to you.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Those that have it may obstruct the exer∣cise of it, if they be not very careful to them∣selves. Besides the Habits of Graces, there are also dispositions requisite for the vigorous exerting of them, and though a saving Holiness can never be lost, yet this disposition may be either off or on, and this hath a great deal of dependance upon a Christians right improving of himself in his endeavouring to excite, and quick∣en, and envigorate his Habits. If a gracious Habit comes to be neglected, it will grow rus∣ty and unfit for use, whereas if it be careful∣ly nou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ished and strengthned, it will usually be very prompt and ready for the service which it is useful for; and it is an experi∣enced Truth, that as there are many things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en may do which will dead<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n and ener<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate

their Hopes, if they be not the more watchful over themselves, so there are several things which they may do, which will greatly actuale them, and this therefore is your great prudence to consider of, and practice, for;</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The exercise of this Hope will be ve∣ry comfortable and profitable to you in such an hour. It will greatly heighten your spi∣rits when they are ready to sink under the weight of sorrow; it will revive you when you are almost fainting with Grief; it will give the Soul a standing, and enable it to feel the ground when it is in the Flood; <HI>we live by Hope, Rom.</HI> 8.24. It was <HI>Davids</HI> Catholicon against all despondencies, as we find, in <HI>Psal.</HI> 42, 43. this will be to us, light in darkness, joy in sorrow, comfort in heaviness, yea life in death it self: it will help you over the dashing billows which threaten to drown you, and afford you re∣newals of strength to enable you to hold on your course, and chearfully to travel thro' all the vicissitudes of time: by this you shall live comfortably in the midst of all these Storms, which will sink them that want it.</P>
<P>For Direction.</P>
<P N="1">1. Make sure of your own good estate.
<PB N="130" REF="000583_0133_0FA712105FA90E88"/>
There is no man can challenge the Gospel Consolations to himself, any farther than he hath this perswasion, that he is entitu∣led to the New Covenant: he that will take the promise as belonging to him, and not arrogate what is not his own, must see that the condition be wrought in him: those on∣ly can assure themselves <HI>that all things shall work together for their good</HI>; all others may expect, and shall find all to turn to their harm: How shall that man comfort himself with such an Hope that this or that person is in Eternal Glory, who hath no ground∣ed hopes that he himself shall ever come there? He may be in his conscience perswa∣ded that such an one is gone to Heaven, but it is another thing to entertain such a per∣swasion with Hope: Hope is that in the exercise whereof the Soul is relieved, but what relief can an unbeliever have by such a perswasion, yea it is the Spirits work to give us the Consolation of our Hope, that it may have real refreshing in it, but such have not received the Spirit, and therefore can be under no such influence.</P>
<P>To think our departed friends are in Hea∣ven, and to expect ourselves when we dye to go down to the Pit of Destruction, can give no Hope at all. Where Faith doth not lie in the Foundation, there can be no Spiritual
<PB N="131" REF="000583_0134_0FA712107346E460"/>
Hope in the Soul; Would you then enjoy it, get into Christ by a <HI>true and living Faith,</HI> who is the Author of all our Hope, and so you shall have one <HI>that will not make you asha∣med.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Be very Faithful in doing of your Duty to your Friends whiles they live with you. As God is wont very often to give his blessing unto the use of means, by making it successful in the thing intended, so usually he affords the greatest comfort to those who being bound in Duty so to use them, are accordingly most careful and conscientious therein. And on the other Hand, it oftentimes so falls out, that God brings about his Holy Purposes of destroying some sinners, by suffering of those under whose care and watch they were, to be remisse and negligent in the discharge of their Duty to them. <HI>Eli,</HI> in a great measure neg∣lects his Duty to his Sons, and God tells him of it, but he mends it not, and the reason is, because <HI>God would destroy them</HI>; and it is not recorded for nothing concerning <HI>Ado∣nijah,</HI> 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 1.6 <HI>that his Father had not displeased him at any time, in saying why hast thou done so?</HI> and this becomes not only a righteous punishment of them that perish, but a just chastisement of the others neglect; there are the Relative Duties which we owe one to another, and when they are sincerely discharged, this will afford good nourishment
<PB N="132" REF="000583_0135_0FA712112EE9E340"/>
unto hope: we owe to our Children, when they are grown up to a capacity of it, in∣struction, good example, a restraining them from exhorbitant courses, a teaching of them the good word, and ways of God, and this is the way in which God hath said he will bestow the blessing upon them, <HI>Gen.</HI> 18.19. let us then be careful in this matter; &amp; here;</P>
<P N="1">1. Do it speedily. Take the season whilst you may; use the opportunity while it is in your hand. Their lives are uncertain, their times are in Gods Hand, and if we use unnecessary delays, feed our selves with purposes to do it afterwards, thinking that it is now too soon; the time may be lapsed, and they may be gone to the grave; and then to be sure they will be out of the reach of our ever doing any thing more for them.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> Do it throughly. Be not perfunctory in this matter; be very serious in the work; it is a great thing, and of unspeakable mo∣ment: it is not to be done to the halves. How shall we expect them to be in good ear∣nest in minding these things, if we are not so in our pursuit of them? let not careless∣ness, fond indulgence, sinister ends, or worldly affairs put us by any part of our Duty which we ow to them; Think not our care of their Souls to be the least or last care incumbent on us: what Christ bids us to do for our∣selves, we should endeavour for ours also▪

<HI>Math.</HI> 6.33. <HI>Seek first the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Do it perseveringly; though you should meet with a great many lets and discourage∣ments lying in your way, yet resolve to break through them all: though you can see no present good coming of all your pains and endeavours, though they should slight and despise, and grow more vain and obstinate under and after all; yet do you commend your endeavours to God, and set to it afresh▪ think with your selves, if at the last you may but obtain what you long for, your la∣bour will be satisfactorily recompensed: we are bidden <HI>not to be weary of well doing,</HI> and <HI>in the morning to sow our seed,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. Take all the encouragements that God hath given you to strengthen your Hope by▪ God hath seen meet to afford his people a great deal, to establish their hope withal; and if we would have it in exercise we must make use of it accordingly: In particular▪</P>
<P N="1">1. Live upon the New Covenant promi∣ses. Though God hath not given us any particular absolute promise, that this or that relation of ours shall be made happy in the everlasting enjoyment of himself when they dy, yet he hath afforded to us many encou∣raging promises concerning them, as hath been exemplified in the explication. He hath promised that <HI>our labour shall not be in
<PB N="134" REF="000583_0137_0FA71212CF54B690"/>
vain</HI>; he hath promised to be <HI>a God to our Children</HI>; he hath promised, that if <HI>they seek him he will be found of them</HI>; and now there is occasion for our making use of these and the like promises; and though they will not amount to full assurance, yet they will give strength to Hope.</P>
<P N="2">2. Eye and observe the Providence of God in his answering of your endeavours with them. Take notice what effect your labour and pains have upon them. It is not enough for us to sow the seed, but we are to be watchfully looking for its coming up, and to observe how it thrives: and if you can discern them to be serious, willing to take counsel, and hearken to your advise; if you can find that they bring forth any fruit which is becoming them; and according to the Word of God, you are to receive this as an answer of your Prayers, and a token for good: and now you may comfortably recollect the remembrance of this, when they are gone; and bear up your spirits therewithal: and the more memorials you have of such things as these the more let your hearts be encouraged, and your hopes strengthned thereby: the neglect of thus doing, many times leaves us at a loss, and under prevailing fears.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="135" REF="000583_0138_0FA71213732C6720"/>4. Be not ignorant. Our Apostle ascribes the immoderate sorrow of Christians to this. <HI>Text.</HI> where under <HI>Ignorance</HI> is comprehend∣ed, a <HI>not knowing, a not believing, and a not considering:</HI> for that which we do not give credit to, or do not apply our thoughts un∣to, we may be said practically not to know; and for help against this in particular;</P>
<P N="1">1. Do not fix their happiness, or your comfort in them to life and time; what the Apostle saith, 1 Cor. 25.19. <HI>If our hope in Christ were for this life only, we were of all men most miserable,</HI> is applicable not with respect to our selves only, but to ours too. If all the comfort, and ioy, and hope which we have in our relations, be only temporal; if we look no farther than the present, their Death will cut all off at one stroak. This was one great reason why the <HI>Heathen</HI> sor∣rowed so hopelesly; because they knew so little about the after-state of men: but God hath given his People full assurance in his Word about these things: believe then firm∣ly, and meditate frequently in the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of the <HI>Resurrection</HI>; think of the state of men after time, and draw what you may from thence. Hence,</P>
<P N="2">2. Believe and much meditate upon the
<PB N="136" REF="000583_0139_0FA712142A7C4050"/>
future happy condition of the People of God. It is not enough to believe that there is an after-state, but our hope lies in think∣ing what that shall be: The Word of God hath told us as much of it, as is meet for us to know in this life; and let us be pon∣dering often upon it: think what great glo∣ries they must be, of which <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, that it is not <HI>lawful to utter them</HI>; what it is to dwell with God and Christ for ever; what is that <HI>Eternal Life</HI> and those <HI>Joyes for evermore,</HI> which shall entertain them after <HI>they are here no more.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Think your selves now with them in that happy state. The Apostle gives that enco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ium of faith, <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 1.11. <HI>it is the substance</HI> (or present subsistence) <HI>of things H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ped for.</HI> Pass then over this little spot of time, which must soon flee away; and say to your self, why should I mourn for their De∣parture, who am looking in a very few days to be called away hence to be with them? Suppose your self now to be out of this Ta∣bernacle gotten to the Kingdom, and sola∣cing your self in their company, in the Bo∣some and Embraces of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>st; and would you mourn if it were indeed so? think it so already, because you hope it will be so short∣ly.</P>
<P N="5">5. Resolve to leave all dark things to
<PB N="137" REF="000583_0140_0FA71216753717B8"/>
the time when God shall satisfie you sul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. Satan &amp; a troubled mind, will offer a great many perple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing questions and doubts; may it not be otherwise than I hope; is it not possible that I may be mistaken in my expe∣ctation? but are they well indeed? how shall I know? these are things which you have nothing to do withal now: Take those encouragements which God hath given you in his Word; put away the fears that Satan and your own corruptions would put upon you; and leave Secret Things to the day of Revelation; so shall you be able to carry it as becomes the People of God, and nothing shall offend you.</P>
