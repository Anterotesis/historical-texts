The PRINTERS of the city of Philadelphia, therefore, sensible of the advantages which may be derived from such institutions, when wisely planned, and conducted with prudence and fidelity, have formed themselves into a society for the above purposes, subject to the following re∣gulations, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
