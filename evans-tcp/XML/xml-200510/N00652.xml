<P>THAT Great Preacher of the Gosp<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and <HI>Insatiable Admirer of the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ,</HI> our Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> in all <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Writings, but especially in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which he wrote unto the <HI>Romans,</HI> [which was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Melancthon</HI> well called, <HI>The Protestants Confession <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Faith,</HI>] as well as his Epistle to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> does abundantly maintain this Article of our <HI>Faith, That a man is not Justified by the works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jesus Christ. <HI>Justi∣fying Faith</HI></HI> is a Receiving of, and a Relying on, the <HI>Gift of Righteousness</HI> from God, by our Lord Jesus Christ; or, the Consent of a Distressed Soul▪ to be <HI>Justified,</HI> by Gods <HI>Graciously Imputing</HI> unto him, the <HI>Obedience</HI> which the Lord Jesus Christ, as our <HI>Surety,</HI> yielded unto God, on the behalf <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> His Elect. This <HI>Faith</HI> doth <HI>Justify</HI> a Sinner, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>as</HI> it is a <HI>Work</HI>; but <HI>Organically</HI> &amp; <HI>Relatively</HI>; In∣asmuch as it is the <HI>Instrument,</HI> by which a man apprehends the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, as freely Tendred unto the Sinner in the
<PB N="4" REF="000791_0004_0FAA53D3F1EC8C50"/>
Gospel; Tis only in this Regard, that <HI>Faith,</HI> &amp; no <HI>Grace,</HI> but <HI>this Faith,</HI> ha's the Honour to <HI>Justi∣fy</HI> us. This is the <HI>Good old way,</HI> of arriving unto <HI>Rest</HI>; and, <HI>Aliter qui Vadit, cadit.</HI></P>
<P>But every <HI>Jewel</HI> ha's a <HI>Counterfeit.</HI> And, <HI>How shall a man know, that his Faith in the Righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ, for his Justification, is not a Counterfeit?</HI></P>
<P>To answer that Case, the Blessed Apostle <HI>James,</HI> under the <HI>Inspirations of the Almighty,</HI> de∣clares unto us, the <HI>Marks</HI> of a <HI>Justifying Faith</HI>; and those <HI>Marks</HI> are, the <HI>Works</HI> which it per∣petually disposes the Believer unto.</P>
<P>Now among the Admonitions of the Apostle <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> purpose, there <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a special Remark due to that, <HI>Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t thou know, O vain man, that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> without works is Dead</HI>?</P>
<P>The Reader will presently observe in this Re∣markable passage; both the Character of the <HI>Faith,</HI> which does not produce and promote <HI>Good Works,</HI> in the <HI>man</HI> that hath it: It is a <HI>Dead Faith</HI>; it will be of no use unto the man in whom it is; it can do nothing for him: and then, the Character of the <HI>Man</HI> who ha's this <HI>Faith</HI>; He is a <HI>vain man</HI>; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e seems, and he boasts, to <HI>have,</HI> what he hath <HI>not</HI>; and he flatters himself with <HI>Hopes</HI> that ne∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er shall be made Good unto him. So that, we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> now Assured, <HI>A Workless Faith is a Worthless Faith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> who Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essedly handles the Doctrine of <HI>Justification,</HI> does plainly assert, That no man
<PB N="5" REF="000791_0005_0FAA53D4C1D617C0"/>
living is <HI>Justified</HI> by <HI>Works,</HI> but a man is <HI>Justifyed</HI> only by <HI>Faith. James</HI> does nevertheless assert, That a man is <HI>Justified</HI> by <HI>Works,</HI> and a man is not <HI>Justified</HI> by <HI>Faith</HI> only. And yet, however some of the Ancients, as well as <HI>Luther,</HI> stumbled at this <HI>Appearance of Contradiction,</HI> the Assertions do not Contradict one another at all. <HI>Paul</HI> treats of our <HI>Justification</HI> before <HI>God,</HI> and the Right unto Everlasting Life, therein granted unto us, which is only by <HI>Faith</HI> in our Lord Jesus Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> treats of that which may manifest our <HI>Iustifica<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></HI> unto <HI>men,</HI> that See &amp; Hear, our Profession of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Faith</HI>; and here <HI>Works</HI> are significant. The <HI>Con<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>science</HI> of a man, may be distressed with a two<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fold <HI>Accusation.</HI></P>
<P>First, A man may be Accused of <HI>Iniquity</HI>; It may be said, <HI>Thou hast broken the Law, and thereby wronged the Name, of God, and the terrible penalty of that Law, now belongs unto thee.</HI> The Answer to this <HI>Accusation</HI> is to be, <HI>My Lord Jesus Christ ha's fully obey'd the will of God, and suffered the penalty due to me for my Disobedience; and I do by Faith de∣pend on this Righteousness of my Lord Jesus Christ, for my Acceptance with God for ever.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, A man may be Accused of <HI>Hypocris<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>▪ It may be said, <HI>Thou Talkest of thy Faith; but is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not meer Talk? How canst thou prove, that thy Faith is any more, than what is in the very Devils them∣selves</HI>? The Answer to this <HI>Accusation</HI> is, <HI>The works of a Sanctified man, which I am doing every Day, are the Proof of my Faith</HI> According <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="6" REF="000791_0006_0FAA53D5813F0BC8"/>
by <HI>Paul,</HI> That a man is <HI>Justified alone by Faith:</HI> but it is asserted by <HI>James,</HI> That a man is <HI>not Justified by a Faith which is alone.</HI> The Question discoursed by <HI>Paul</HI> is, <HI>How a Guilty Person may come to be Acquitted by the Lord, from all the Guilt that lies upon him?</HI> The Answer to this Question, is, Not by any <HI>Works</HI> of our own, but only by the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is, on our part, only by <HI>Faith</HI> applied unto us. The Question discoursed by <HI>James,</HI> is, <HI>Whether a man pretending to Faith in the Righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ, shall be saved, though he continue without the works of an Holy Life, agreeable thereunto</HI>? The Answer to this Question is, <HI>No,</HI> Such a man ha's no <HI>Saving Faith</HI> at all. And that <HI>James</HI> is to be taken in that sense, is evident from. This: He does insist upon the Instance of <HI>Abraham</HI>; and yet <HI>Abraham</HI> was a <HI>Justified man,</HI> Thirty years, before those <HI>Works,</HI> which are said here to <HI>Justify</HI> him. Upon the whole then, we see <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>James,</HI> Recon∣ciled, or, indeed, never contrdicting. And we are Advised after all; Tis a <HI>Vanity</HI> in any man to <HI>Profess,</HI> that he ha's a <HI>True Faith</HI> in the Lord Jesus Christ, if his <HI>Faith</HI> be not <HI>Fruitful</HI> in those <HI>Good Works,</HI> which may <HI>Justify</HI> the mans <HI>Profession.</HI></P>
<P>There are Two very Important <HI>Cases,</HI> about which the Thoughts of every Christian, cannot but be Exercised; and we will here bestow some of our Thoughts thereupon.</P>
<P>The first <HI>Case</HI> which a Christian, must Consider, if he would be a <HI>Christian,</HI> is,
<PB N="7" REF="000791_0007_0FAA53D629B53348"/>What are those <HI>Good Works,</HI> which a True Faith, will Quicken &amp; Incline the Believer unto?</P>
<P>Now we may thus conceive of them; <HI>Good Works,</HI> are <HI>Sincere Essayes</HI> to observe the <HI>Law of God.</HI> Our God hath given us a <HI>Rule of Life,</HI> in that which we call, <HI>The Moral Law.</HI> None of our <HI>Works</HI> are <HI>Perfectly Good,</HI> if in any point they fall short of that <HI>Rule.</HI> But none of our <HI>Works</HI> do <HI>Perfectly</HI> come up to the <HI>Rule,</HI> as long as we are lodg'd in <HI>this Body which is to Dy.</HI> The <HI>Best me<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> alive, when they look upon the <HI>Best Works</HI> of the<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Lives, may cry out, with one of the Ancients▪ <HI>Terret me tota vita mea, nam apparet mihi, aut Pec∣catum, aut tota Sterilitas</HI>; The <HI>Sinfulness,</HI> and <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rann<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss,</HI> of all my <HI>Life,</HI> strikes me with a <HI>Deadly Terror</HI> of Soul! Nevertheless, there are <HI>Sincere Essays</HI> towards <HI>Perfection,</HI> which all Believers are Conscientiously making every Day. Now these <HI>Essayes</HI> are <HI>Good,</HI> in the Merciful Reckoning of God, our <HI>Father</HI> in our Lord Jesus Christ. Tho' none of our <HI>Sincere Essayes</HI> at <HI>Well-doing</HI> are such <HI>Good works</HI> as to <HI>Justify</HI> us, before that Thrice <HI>Holy God,</HI> who is of <HI>Purer eyes than to behold Evil,</HI> &amp; whose <HI>Pure</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yet <HI>behold</HI> in our <HI>Good Works,</HI> a world of <HI>Evil</HI>: Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our <HI>Sincere Essayes</HI> are pleasing unto our God, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by His Good <HI>Spirit</HI> ha's Excited them, &amp; Assist<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> them; and, <HI>Whose workmanship we are, Created <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ Jesus unto Good works, which God hath before ordained, that we should walk in them.</HI> Such Good <HI>Works,</HI> as our <HI>Prayers,</HI> are, as tis said, in Prov. 15.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪
<PB N="8" REF="000791_0008_0FAA53D967B085C0"/>
<HI>The Delight of the Lord</HI>; and such Good <HI>Works,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s our <HI>Alms,</HI> are, as tis said, in Heb. 13.16. <HI>The Sacrifices where with God is well pleased.</HI></P>
<P>But now, to speak strictly, <HI>Good Works</HI> must have these Four Ingredients to render them <HI>such.</HI></P>
<P>First; The <HI>Matter</HI> of our <HI>Works</HI> must be, ac∣cording to the <HI>Law</HI> of God, or, His <HI>Will</HI> Revealed in His <HI>Word.</HI> The Prophet could say, in Mic. 6.8. <HI>He hath shewed thee, O man, the thing that is Good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to Do Justice, and to Love Mercy, and to walk Hum∣bly with thy God. Good Works</HI> must be such, as the Lord hath <HI>shewn</HI> to us, that He hath <HI>Required</HI> of us. They are no <HI>Good Works,</HI> whereof our God may say, <HI>Who hath required 'em</HI>? Works of <HI>Piety,</HI> are <HI>Good Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>; for we have the <HI>Word</HI> of our God for them; as in Psal. 92.1. <HI>It is a Good Thing to give Thanks unto the Lord.</HI> Works of <HI>Charity</HI> are <HI>Good Works</HI>; for we have the <HI>word</HI> of our God for them; as in Heb. 13.16. <HI>To Do Good, and to Communicate, forget not.</HI> No works are <HI>Good,</HI> but such as are contained in the <HI>Two Tables</HI> of the <HI>Ten Commandments</HI>; the Command∣ments of <HI>Love</HI> to <HI>God,</HI> and of <HI>Love</HI> to <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>But unto the Constitution of <HI>Good Works,</HI> it is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot enough, that the <HI>matter</HI> of what we do, be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccording to the <HI>Law</HI> of God. Men may do <HI>Works</HI> that shall be <HI>Good</HI> for the <HI>matter</HI> of them, and yet, <HI>Every work of their Hands be unclean, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith the Lord. Plowing</HI> is Lawful, and <HI>Praying</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="000791_0009_0FAA53DA69913C40"/>
is Lawful; and yet these <HI>works</HI> may be sinful in the Doer of them. Wherefore,</P>
<P>Secondly, The <HI>Manner</HI> of our <HI>Works,</HI> must be Right, as well as the <HI>Matter</HI> of them. A man may incur the Wrath of God, by his <HI>Good Works,</HI> if he do them not in any <HI>manner</HI> accor∣ding to the <HI>Law,</HI> as they should be done. We find, in 1 Chron. 15.13. <HI>The Lord our God</HI> is offended at those who <HI>Seek Him not after the due Order.</HI> No meer <HI>External Actions</HI> are to be E∣steemed <HI>Good Works</HI>; there must <HI>Internal Cautions</HI> go along with them; else they are but the <HI>matter</HI> of <HI>Good Works,</HI> without the <HI>Form. Good Works</HI> must be done with <HI>Regular Circumstances,</HI> if they would be called, <HI>Good.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, The <HI>Design</HI> of our <HI>Works</HI> must be Right, as well as the <HI>manner</HI> of them. The <HI>De∣sign</HI> which the <HI>Law</HI> of God has assigned for our <HI>Good Works,</HI> is, That the Great God, may be acknowledged, and magnified, and glorified: And the <HI>Gospel</HI> of God, coming in, has assigned a further <HI>Design</HI> for them; namely, To express our <HI>Gratitude</HI> unto our Lord-Redeemer, for His Redeeming of us. Thus 'tis Enjoined, in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.30. <HI>Whatever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</HI> An <HI>Evil Intention</HI> will utterly spoil any <HI>Go<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Works,</HI> tho' they were otherwise never so <HI>Go<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> And a meerly <HI>Selfish Intention</HI> is an <HI>Evil</HI> one <HI>Good Works</HI> must all be done, with an Eye, to the <HI>Honour</HI> of God, and the <HI>Service</HI> of Christ before any <HI>Temporal Advantage</HI> to <HI>Self</HI>: else the
<PB N="10" REF="000791_0010_0FAA53DAB677B9C0"/>
<HI>Best Sacrifices</HI> are but an <HI>Abomination.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>Good Works</HI> must proceed from a <HI>Good <HI>Principle</HI></HI>; or otherwise they will have no <HI>Real Goodness</HI> in them. Waters that Flow from a bitter and a poison'd <HI>Fountain,</HI> can't be <HI>Good.</HI> A <HI>Good Heart,</HI> Like a <HI>Good Fountain,</HI> must be the <HI>Principle,</HI> from whence <HI>Good Works</HI> are to flow. We are told, in Mat. 12.35. <HI>A Good man, out of the Good Treasure of the Heart, bringeth forth Good Things.</HI> A <HI>Good Principle</HI> within, is a <HI>Good Trea∣sure of the Heart. Works</HI> done meerly from a Principle of <HI>Slavish Fear,</HI> or <HI>Fleshly Love,</HI> are not <HI>Good,</HI> tho' they be never so <HI>Good.</HI> There must be a <HI>Principle</HI> of <HI>Respect unto God in Christ,</HI> woo∣ing us unto all our <HI>Good Works,</HI> or else they are <HI>Stark Naught.</HI> Yea, the <HI>Spirit</HI> of our Lord Je∣sus Christ, must be in us, as a <HI>Vital Principle,</HI> for our <HI>Good Works,</HI> or else they are <HI>Dead Works,</HI> every one of them. Hence, no <HI>Good Works</HI> were ever done by any one <HI>Unregenerate</HI> man, since the World began; for every <HI>Unregenerate</HI> man is destitute of the <HI>Principle,</HI> which is to be acted in them: the most <HI>Splendid Works</HI> of the Unregenerate, are but (as <HI>Austin</HI> call'd them) <HI>Splendid Sins</HI> before the Lord.</P>
<P>And now there is a Second <HI>Case</HI> which a Christian has to consider, that so he may be stirred up, and helped on, to do those <HI>Good Works</HI> by which he may approve himself indeed a Christian.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="000791_0011_0FAA53DB9370B710"/>Where Lies the <HI>Necessity</HI> of Good Works, in a Justi∣fied Believer, to Justifie the Faith, which he is a Professor of?</P>
<P>Now we do know this; That our <HI>Good Works</HI> are not <HI>Antecedently</HI> necessary unto our <HI>Ju∣stification</HI> before the God of Heaven. For <HI>Good VVorks</HI> cannot be done by any man, <HI>until</HI> he be <HI>Justified.</HI> Until a man be <HI>United</HI> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, who is our <HI>Life,</HI> he is a <HI>Dead man:</HI> and what <HI>Good Works</HI> can a <HI>Dead man</HI> do? This is a thing <HI>Livelily</HI> Preached unto us, by our Lord Himself, in the fifteenth Chapter of <HI>John; The mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</HI> Hence that common saying of <HI>Austin, Bona Opera sequuntur Justificatum, non praecedunt Justificandum.</HI> No, nor is <HI>Faith</HI> it self, <HI>As</HI> doing of <HI>Good Works,</HI> that which Entitles us unto the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, for our <HI>Justification</HI>; 'Tis <HI>Faith,</HI> only <HI>As</HI> it Layes Hold on the <HI>Righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the chief of Sinners,</HI> that <HI>Justifies</HI> us; And until this be done, we cannot be carried forth unto any <HI>Good Works</HI> at all.</P>
<P>But then, <HI>Good Works,</HI> are <HI>consequently</HI> necessa∣ry upon our <HI>Justification.</HI> 'Tis indeed said, That <HI>God Justifies the Ungodly</HI>; but then, He does not Leave them <HI>Ungodly</HI> when He hath <HI>Justified</HI> them. Well, And where Lies the <HI>Necessity?</HI> Truly, if we would not be <HI>vain men,</HI> we must <HI>Know</HI> such Things as these.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="000791_0012_0FAA53DC2DD86B70"/>First, <HI>Wilt thou know, O man?</HI> That it is in the very <HI>Nature</HI> of a <HI>Justifying Faith,</HI> to put a man upon the Doing of <HI>Good Works. Faith</HI> is a <HI>Purifier</HI> of the <HI>Heart</HI>: [Acts 15.9.] and so, it cannot but be a <HI>Purifier</HI> of the <HI>Life.</HI> The same <HI>Faith,</HI> which Embraces the Lord Jesus Christ, as a <HI>Priest,</HI> for <HI>Atonement,</HI> (and <HI>As</HI> doing this it <HI>Justifies!</HI>) Embraces Him also, as a <HI>Prophet,</HI> &amp; as a <HI>King:</HI> Now this <HI>Prophet</HI> will <HI>Instruct,</HI> &amp; this <HI>King</HI> will <HI>Injoin,</HI> our doing of <HI>Good Works</HI> for e∣ver. A <HI>Justifying Faith,</HI> Receives Christ the <HI>Sa∣crificer,</HI> and the <HI>Intercessor</HI>; and in that Notion, it <HI>Justifies</HI>: But is this all? No, it also, accor∣ding to Col. 2.6. <HI>Receives Christ the Lord.</HI> Now <HI>Good Works</HI> are by that <HI>Lord</HI> Required. 'Tis no <HI>True Faith,</HI> which any man hath, if it be not for a <HI>whole Christ.</HI> The Devil said unto our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>What have we to do with thee, Thou Holy One</HI>? If a man would be concerned with our Lord Jesus Christ, only as a <HI>Merciful</HI> One, and a <HI>Gracious</HI> One, and not likewise as an <HI>Holy</HI> One, that man has no more <HI>Faith</HI> than a <HI>Devil! Justifying Faith</HI> is a <HI>Tree,</HI> which cannot but have the <HI>Good Fruits</HI> of <HI>Good Works</HI> growing upon it. It is the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> of God, that <HI>Creates,</HI> and that <HI>Bestows,</HI> a <HI>Justifying Faith,</HI> wherever it is; and that <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> cannot suffer any Soul, in which He dwells, to be wholly Remiss about the <HI>Good Works</HI> which are agreeable unto His <HI>Holiness.</HI></P>
<P>Briefly; 'Tis in the very <HI>Nature</HI> of a <HI>Saving
<PB N="13" REF="000791_0013_0FAA53DCF74097A0"/>
Faith</HI> to be a <HI>Working Faith.</HI> The Scriptures of Truth, assure us, in Gal. 5.6. <HI>Faith works, by Love.</HI> It was well said, therefore by <HI>John Hus, Ubi Bona Opera non apparent ad extra, ibi Fides non est ad intra: Faith</HI> is not <HI>within,</HI> if <HI>Good VVorks</HI> are not <HI>without.

<P>Furthermore; <HI>Wilt thou know, O man?</HI> That the <HI>Commandment</HI> of Heaven hath made <HI>Good works</HI> incumbent on every man on Earth.

<HI>Contrition</HI> of Heart, make our Confession, <HI>That we come short of our Duty.</HI> Indeed, because we cannot but continually Transgress, and, <HI>In many things we offend all,</HI> therefore the <HI>New-Covenant</HI> ha's provided a <HI>Remedy</HI> for us: Tis only the <HI>Good works</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ Reputed <HI>Ours,</HI> that cause us to <HI>stand as without Fault before the Throne of God.</HI> But we must own it still, as a <HI>Fault</HI> in us, a <HI>Fault</HI> worthy of Death, whenever we miss of doing any Thing, that is demanded as a <HI>Duty,</HI> in the <HI>Old Covenant</HI>: There is a <HI>Sin,</HI> in <HI>Every Transgression of the Law</HI>; a Sin to be Confessed, Bewayled, Abhorred.

Repeat those Precepts; in Math. 5.16. <HI>Let your Light so shine before men, that they may see your Good works:</HI> and in Tit. 3.8. <HI>This is a Faithful saying, That they which have Believed in God, should be careful of Good works</HI>: and in 1 Joh. 2.1. <HI>These Things write I unto you, that ye do not Sin.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover; <HI>Wilt thou know, O man</HI>?

shall I render to the Lord, for all His Benefits?</HI> Now the Reply that <HI>Faith</HI> makes to this Enquiry, is the same that our Lord Himself makes; <HI>Let those Good works be done, which may adorn the Doctrine of God the Saviour!</HI> It was argued, in Rom. 12.1. <HI>I beseech you Brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your Bodies, a Living Sacrifice, Holy, Ac¦ceptable to God, which is your Reasonable Service.</HI> Even so, All the Return, which our Lord Jesus Christ expects from us, for all His <HI>Mercies,</HI> is, <HI>That we Devote our selves unto the Service of our Lord</HI>: And <HI>Faith</HI> says, That this is a Thing infi∣nitely <HI>Reasonable.</HI> Where <HI>Faith</HI> has been infused into the Heart of any man, there is no <HI>Motive</HI> unto <HI>Good VVorks</HI> more powerful than this upon him.

<P>Now what should be the Result of our Thoughts upon these Two <HI>Cases</HI> thus offered, but This?</P>
<P>We are to be advised, first of all; That we do not Expect, to be <HI>Justified</HI> by our <HI>Good works,</HI> or to Do any <HI>Good works</HI> until we are <HI>Justified,</HI> in our Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ.
