<HEAD>By the <HI>PROPRIETARY</HI> of the Province of <HI>PENSILVANIA,</HI> and Counties annexed With the ADVICE of the COƲNCIL: A PROCLAMATION</HEAD>
<P>WHereas several <HI>Piracies</HI> and <HI>Robberies</HI> at Sea and on Sea-Coasts have of late years been committed in Many parts of the World, to the great Injury of Trade, the Terrour and Ruine of many peaceable honest People under Governments in Amity with the Crown of England, and to the horrid Scan∣dal of the English Nation: And whereas divers Persons justly suspected to be guilty of having practised the Aforesaid Crimes, as well by the Nature and Quantity of the Treasure about them, as by their being unable to give any good Account of them∣selves, their Residence or Commerce, have for some time been observed to land on, and scatter themselves through these Northern <HI>English</HI> Colonies of <HI>America,</HI> with a manifest Design of enjoying with Impunity and Safety their ill gotten Riches.</P>
<P>Now to the End that All such Persons may be effectually discouraged from taking shelter <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this Province, and They that attempt it may be speedily detected, and no longer escape the hand of <HI>Justice</HI>; I have thought fit, and do hereby <HI>strictly</HI> Charge and Command all <HI>Magistrates</HI> and <HI>Officers</HI> within this <HI>Province</HI> and <HI>Counties</HI> annexed, as they will answer the Contrary at their Peril, to use their utmost Diligence vigorously to <HI>Pursue, Apprehend</HI> and <HI>Secure</HI> every such <HI>Person,</HI> that may be thus suspected; and not only such <HI>Persons,</HI> but also to prosecute all <HI>Others,</HI> who shall knowingly <HI>Harbour</HI> any of Them or their <HI>Goods,</HI> or by any means directly or indirectly <HI>Protect</HI> them, or shall be Aiding or Assisting to Them to make their Escape or to withdraw themselves from <HI>Justice.</HI> And more Es∣pecially I do hereby Require and Command All the <HI>Kings</HI> Loving Subjects the Inhabitants of this <HI>Province</HI> &amp; Territories, &amp; particularly all <HI>Keepers</HI> of <HI>Public Houses,</HI> to have a watch∣full Eye over, and strictly to Observe all <HI>Strangers</HI> coming among them, and such to Apprehend, or cause to be Apprehended and Secured, as they find unable to give a Reasonable and Credible Account of their former Abode and Conversation, and about whom is found any such Quantity of <HI>East-India, Arabian</HI> or other Foreign <HI>Goods</HI> or <HI>Coins,</HI> as may render them justly suspected as aforesaid: Whether they pretend to have got their wealth by Privateering against Ships under <HI>French</HI> Commissions, which for some time past has been happily at an End, or by an open Trade to <HI>Madagascar,</HI> known to be the <HI>Magazine</HI> of Spoils and Plunders committed on the <HI>East-India-Seas</HI>: And to take care that the said Persons in safe Custody be kept, till upon due Information thereof given to me, they shall receive my further Orders. And the better to Encourage a due Prosecution of these my Commands; It is hereby Promised that whosoever shall Discover, Secure and Deliver into the Hands of <HI>Justice,</HI> any such suspected Person, who shal be afterwards Convict∣ed of the aforesaid Crime, shall receive the Sum of Ten Pounds, as a Reward of their good Service. Given under my Hand and Seal at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> the 23d. day of the Tenth Month, in the Eleventh Year of the Reign of WILLIAM the Third of Great <HI>Britain, France</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> King &amp;c. And the Nineteenth of This Government. <HI>Anno{que} Domini.</HI> 1699.</P>
