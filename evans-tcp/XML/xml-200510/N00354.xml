<HEAD>The preface.</HEAD>
<P>IT was the Observation which judic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous <HI>Ca∣pel</HI> began a <HI>Preface</HI> to a good Book with the mention of, <HI>Books are more neces∣sary in a State than Arms.</HI> Let it pass for a <HI>Conveniency</HI> among us in this <HI>Scythian Desart,</HI> That the Gentlemen who handle <HI>Arms</HI> may be also presented with <HI>Books</HI> accommoda∣ted unto their <HI>Instruction</HI> and <HI>Encouragement.</HI> It is reported of an unparallel'd Souldier, no less an <HI>Hero</HI> than <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> that being forc'd to swim for his life in an extremity, he employ'd one hand to preserve from the damage of the wa∣ter, certain <HI>Books</HI> which he had a special value for. Nor is it any Disparagement unto men of a <HI>military</HI> Disposition or Improvement, that in all ages the most accomplisht of them, have been willing sometimes to make <HI>Books</HI> the entertain∣ment of their vacant hours: Even a mighty <HI>Alexander</HI> must have a <HI>Book</HI> under his pillow, or he cannot sleep. Perhaps it is from some∣something
<PB REF="000431_0003_0FA5B3EBD9B77F00"/>
of this <HI>Bookish Temper</HI> that this poor <HI>Sermon</HI> preached unto the <HI>Artillery</HI> of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> is by some Members of that wor∣thy <HI>Company</HI> now desired to be printed; that their <HI>eyes</HI> may dwell upon those things which <HI>He who gives favour to them that are not men of Skill</HI> made not altogether unaccepta∣ble unto their <HI>ears.</HI> It was a <HI>Souldier</HI> that found out the happy art of <HI>Printing</HI> at first; and it seems that <HI>Souldiers</HI> will now and then press the <HI>Press</HI> into their <HI>Service</HI> still.</P>
<P>My Education among <HI>Libraries,</HI> my Con∣cernment only in such a <HI>Warfare</HI> as <HI>Timothy</HI> had recommended unto him, and my impatient Longings for the Revolution of a <HI>Golden Age</HI> wherein there shall be (as about the Time of our Lords first coming it is noted by the Roman Hist∣orian that there was) <HI>Totius Orbis aut pax, aut pactio,</HI> a general <HI>Peace</HI> or <HI>Truce</HI> through∣out the whole world, have made me the unfittest of all men to read <HI>Military Lectures▪ Aelian</HI>'s <HI>Tacticks</HI> shall stand in the <HI>Rore</HI> of my Authors, and will perhaps be left unstudied by me, till I have nothing else to do. That <HI>military</HI> mis∣chievous Invention of <HI>Guns,</HI> and the <HI>Nitrous, Sulphureous, Charcoal'd</HI> matter which they vo∣mit was indeed first hit upon by a <HI>Clergy-man,</HI>
<PB REF="000431_0004_0FA5B3ED933ED970"/>
yet one that I never would care to be akin unto. But a <HI>Request</HI> from the Honoured Persons, at whose Invitation the ensuing <HI>Thoughts</HI> have been <HI>Spoken</HI> and <HI>Written,</HI> was a strong <HI>Sum∣mons</HI> not to be gainsaid by me, who ought to count <HI>Opportunities</HI> of <HI>doing Good</HI> among the best of all my <HI>Treasures.</HI> They asked me to lay before them their Dutyes, as farr as my <HI>Armory,</HI> the <HI>Bible,</HI> would inform me what they are: and I have with <HI>brief Hints</HI> attempted to let them know what those <HI>Words of Command</HI> are which come unto them back'd with a, <HI>Thus saith the LORD.</HI> They have also asked me to give them a Copy of those <HI>Words</HI> for the <HI>Publica∣tion</HI> of them; and I consider'd that this being all, my case was not so hard as that of the Expedition against <HI>Sisera,</HI> wherein out of <HI>Ze∣bulon</HI> were engaged <HI>they that handled the</HI> pen <HI>of the Writer,</HI> Gow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-men became <HI>Sword∣men,</HI> and Pen-knives (as one saith on it) were turned into Swords. But in this thing they had not found me ready to gratify them, if it had not been for the sake of Communicating those <HI>Me∣ditations</HI> in the Close of the Discourse, which render <HI>every</HI> man a <HI>Souldier,</HI> and call upon all to <HI>encounter</HI> the <HI>invisible Enemies</HI> of their own souls. This part of the <HI>Discourse</HI> is no
<PB REF="000431_0005_0FA5B3EE0A599CC8"/>
Diversion from the work which my <HI>Hand finds to do,</HI> however the other may: of <HI>this,</HI> if I had a voice as loud as the <HI>last Trumpet</HI> I must say, <HI>Let him that hath ears to hear, hear.</HI></P>
<P>Thousands of <HI>Praises,</HI> whole Ages of <HI>praises</HI> be given unto a good God, for the <HI>Abundance of peace</HI> wherein we in this Wilderness do delight our selves. 'Twere well if the blessed leisure which <HI>Deus fecit,</HI> is given by God unto us, were employ'd unto <HI>spiritual Advantages</HI> by us all; and particularly by them that have a kindness for the affairs of <HI>Souldiery.</HI> It would be an incredible benefit to the Church of God, for men to have their houses furnished with <HI>Treatises</HI> which shall teach them how to <HI>Spirituallize</HI> the outward occurrents of their <HI>Occupations,</HI> and set <HI>Pulpits,</HI> and faithful <HI>Preachers</HI> for them in every <HI>Business</HI> that they have to meddle with. I find that the <HI>Husband-man,</HI> and the <HI>Shepherd,</HI> and the <HI>Mariner,</HI> yea, and the <HI>Weaver</HI> too, are thus provided for, by the ingenious Labours of some heavenly-minded men. A Reverend Person a∣mong our selves, has in this way been an Obliging Friend unto the <HI>Souldier also;</HI> His, <HI>Souldiery Spirituallized,</HI> well deserves the Perusal of them to whom it is directed, and hath given a just <HI>Super-Sedeas</HI> unto those Enlargements
<PB REF="000431_0006_0FA5B3EEB6909CD8"/>
of that kind here which else might have been endeavoured. That they who will be <HI>Souldiers</HI> may likewise be <HI>serious;</HI> That there may be <HI>Glory to GOD in the highest,</HI> and that there may be <HI>Peace on earth,</HI> and <HI>Good Will among men,</HI> is the grand Scope of this little Essay.</P>

<P>THat elegant Resemblance of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the close of His last Letter from Heaven to the Church on Earth, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.2. <HI>A tree of Life which bears twelve manner</HI> (a blessed variety) <HI>of Fruits, the leaves whereof also are for the heal∣ing of the Nations,</HI> hath been sometimes not unfitly apply'd unto the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> those pre∣cious <HI>Leaves</HI> of the Bible, which <HI>testify of Him.</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="000431_0008_0FA5B3F00A5802A0"/>
There is in these <HI>Oracles</HI> of God, a delicious Entertainment for the innumerable sorts of Readers to whom <HI>these presents come</HI>; and the Benefit of the <HI>Souldier</HI> particularly is not left unconsulted in them. The blessed <HI>Suitableness</HI> of this <HI>miraculous Book</HI> unto the Affayrs and Concerns of all men, is, to be found (as the Philosopher saith, of the <HI>Soul in the Body</HI>) in <HI>every part</HI> thereof; but the Book of <HI>Psalms</HI> (a <HI>Little Bible,</HI> as <HI>Luther</HI> styl'd it) in pecu∣liarwise, is so remarkable on this score, that it was no imprudence in old <HI>Jerom</HI> to bid his Friend make This his <HI>Vade mecum,</HI> his constant Companion, it was no folly in the holy Mi∣nister of <HI>Constantinople</HI> being driven out of that City, to take no part of his Treasures but This, which was unto him <HI>pro et prae Divitiis,</HI> instead of and better than all the <HI>Riches</HI> of the World; the renouned <HI>Basil</HI> therefore very rightly recommended it as <HI>A Divine Treasure,</HI> and the eloquent <HI>Chrysostom</HI> no less appositely reputed it as, a <HI>Panoply for the Christian.</HI> From this <HI>Panoply,</HI> from this well-furnished <HI>Armory,</HI> give me leave to offer something for the Use of this <HI>Armed,</HI> and much honoured Auditory. For this cause the name which the Holy Spi∣rit <HI>in a certain place</HI> (in <HI>Col</HI> 3.16.) putteth upon these <HI>Psalms</HI> is that of <HI>spiritual Songs</HI>;
<PB N="3" REF="000431_0009_0FA5B3F0FB27E7D8"/>
partly because the <HI>Spirits</HI> of men are most sin∣gularly <HI>suited</HI> therein: every man may con∣ceive, as <HI>Athanasius</HI> long ago observed, That they speak <HI>de se, in re sua,</HI> to his <HI>own case</HI> directly. Tis to be hoped that the <HI>Spirit</HI> of the <HI>Souldier</HI> especially will anon herein meet with what shall not be impertinent unto <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>That inspired person, whoever he were, that <HI>marshalled</HI> the Psalms into the <HI>Method</HI> wherein we now enjoy them, seems to have had some respect unto the Affinity of <HI>Subjects</HI> therein handled, in his doing of it. Hence this Hundred-and-forty-fourth Psalm, with the rest unto the <HI>end</HI> of our Psalter, is employ'd in that business which we expect at the <HI>end</HI> of our pilgrimage to be put upon; even <HI>The magnify∣ing of the LORD JEHOVAH.</HI> The <HI>Penman</HI> of this Composure, is by the <HI>Title</HI> of it, deter∣mined to be <HI>David,</HI> the <HI>sweet singer of Israel.</HI> Indeed some passages of it are by <HI>Him</HI> again repeated in both h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s first and his second Edi∣tion of the <HI>Eightee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Psalm;</HI> and if the Pri∣mitive Christians in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Pub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ique Worship, are reported to have had no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommon satis∣faction when they heard <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vidi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um,</HI> any thing of <HI>David,</HI> sounded among them, tis

to be suppos'd, that we shall not therein come behind them. But the <HI>Occasion</HI> of the Composure is to be variously guessed at, as an <HI>unwritten thing.</HI> Those whom we (upon un∣certain grounds) reckon the <HI>Seventy</HI> Greek <HI>Translators,</HI> or rather <HI>Interpreters</HI> of the Old Testament, have so inscribed it, <HI>A Psalm of David against Goliah</HI>; so the <HI>Ethiopi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> like∣wise, and so the <HI>Vulgar Latin.</HI> And perhaps <HI>David</HI>'s victory over <HI>Goliah,</HI> may be one thing referr'd unto in this <HI>Song of Zion.</HI> I find a <HI>Jewish Commentary</HI> particularly favouring such a Sentiment. But good old <HI>Hilary</HI> for one, justly and honestly declames against the foist∣ing in of this clause, where it should not be. Thus much then is all the <HI>Conjecture</HI> for which we have room left unto us: We may ap∣prehend that the amiable <HI>David</HI> was now ar∣rived thro an <HI>Iliad</HI> of Mischiefs and whole Seas of Difficulties, unto a Settlement in his Kingdom over <HI>Israel</HI>; and that hereupon he now presents unto the Lord, both his <HI>Praises</HI> for the Vanquishent of the Enemies who had hitherto disquieted him, and his <HI>Prayers</HI> for the Continuance of his Tranquillity, maugre all future Opposition.</P>
<P>The Rapturous <HI>Thanksgivings</HI> of the <HI>Psal∣Psalmist</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="000431_0011_0FA5B3F85A8039B8"/>
begin as soon as was possible; even at the verse now before us. The <HI>gracious Saint</HI> is here uttering of his Wishes that the great GOD may forever be well-spoken of by all the world, and this on a double account. Something God hath <HI>been</HI> to him, and some∣thing God had <HI>done</HI> for him.</P>
<P>Firstly, For Something that God <HI>was</HI> to him. He ascribes to the Lord that Title, <HI>my Strength,</HI> or (Heb. <HI>Tzuri) my Rock.</HI> q. d.
<Q>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Almighty God has afforded a better <HI>Defence</HI> to me in all dangers than the ragged <HI>Rocks</HI> and Caves and Thickets did unto my poor Countrey men, before I by slaying the <HI>tall Pagan</HI> occasion'd the Routing of the <HI>Phi∣listines,</HI> who had driven them thereinto.</Q></P>
<P>Nextly, For something that God <HI>did</HI> for him. He celebrates this Kindness of God un∣to him, <HI>He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaches my hands to war and my fingers to Fight.</HI> i. e.
<Q>The good God en∣ables me to go through the <HI>Military</HI> Perfor∣mances which I am put upon. These <HI>Hands</HI> of mine that were once wont to hold the <HI>Shepherds Crook,</HI> and these <HI>Fingerr</HI> of mine which were wont to solace me with their soft <HI>Notes</HI> upon my <HI>Harp,</HI> are now expert in
<PB N="6" REF="000431_0012_0FA5B3F8A30B6F80"/>
those <HI>Martial</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which God hath bin my <HI>Teacher</HI> in.</Q>
There is a divine <HI>Teach∣ing</HI> herein acknowledged, and the Twofold <HI>Subject</HI> of it is taken notice of. The Good man first declares the <HI>Subject</HI> which <HI>received</HI> this Teaching: This was his <HI>Hands</HI> &amp; his <HI>Fingers.</HI> These are by a <HI>Synecdoche</HI> put for not only all the <HI>Members</HI> of his body, but also all the <HI>Pow∣ers</HI> of his mind. These may be singled out, because there is a <HI>special Vse</HI> of these parts in all warly Encounters. There was so parti∣cularly, first in <HI>Choosing</HI> and then in <HI>Casting</HI> the <HI>Stone</HI> which laid the <HI>Philistean</HI> Champi∣on sprawling on the ground. In the <HI>Hands</HI> also <HI>Strength</HI> is seated, and <HI>Skill</HI> is shewed by the <HI>Fingers.</HI> So both of those Qualifications may herein be glanced at. The good Soul next declares the <HI>Subject</HI> which this Teaching was <HI>Occupy'd</HI> about: This was <HI>Warring</HI> and <HI>Fighting.</HI> The former Expression [<HI>Lakrob</HI>] comes from a Root that signifies to <HI>Draw near</HI>; the Latter [<HI>Lammilchama</HI>] comes from a Root that signifies to <HI>Eat up</HI>; because in War∣ly Engagements, persons first <HI>Approach</HI> and then <HI>Devour</HI> one another.</P>
<P>From hence then the <HI>Doctrine</HI> which Sum∣mons our present Attention is</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="000431_0013_0FA5B3F99AC2DC50"/>
DOCT.</P>
<Q><P>That <HI>The Almighty GOD is to be ac∣knowledg'd as the Author of whatsoever Military</HI> SKILL <HI>or</HI> STRENGTH <HI>any Children of men do excel in.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the Worthy <HI>Company</HI> who call'd me to this place and work, may not be too long detained from the <HI>Field,</HI> where no doubt, they love to be, all due Brevity shall be en∣deavoured, in our present Discourse.</P></Q>
<P>Only two Propositions shall be call'd upon, to ripen this <HI>Doctrine</HI> for it's Application.</P>

He was abundant in Reading the Scriptures, &amp; sundry Treatises both of <HI>Divinity</HI> and <HI>History,</HI> and penning down in his pri∣vate papers the memorable passages which he found pertinent &amp; profitable to himself therein. Yea, it was common with him to spend whole <HI>Days</HI> in the Austerities of a <HI>Fast.</HI> He moreover kept a constant <HI>Diary</HI> wherein (to use his own Phrase) he had on one Side, a page <HI>For the Old man,</HI> on the other side, a page <HI>For the</HI> New <HI>man</HI>; in these he did every day note down on the one side, <HI>How far the Inter∣est of Sin decayed in him,</HI> on the other s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de, <HI>How far he grew in his</HI> Conformity <HI>to Jesus Christ.</HI>

the <HI>Sin which doth most easily beset you.</HI> The Emperour <HI>Valentinian</HI> when he was dy¦ing, had his Friends comforting of him with the Remembrance of his past <HI>Victories</HI>; he told them that he gloried in <HI>one</HI> Victory above all the rest, <HI>Inimicorum nequissimum vici</HI> (said he) Carnem <HI>mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> I have had a <HI>Victory</HI> over my <HI>Flesh</HI> the enemy in the world.

<P>The Enemies of our Souls would, all of them together, be able to do us <HI>little</HI> harm, if there were not some peculiar <HI>Lust,</HI> like <HI>Tro∣jan Horse,</HI> within us, assisting of all their En∣terprizes. It was the Priviledge of the Man Christ Jesus alone to say, <HI>The Devil finds</HI> no∣thing <HI>in me,</HI> when the <HI>Legions</HI> of Hell made an Attacque upon him. The <HI>Father of Lies</HI> utter'd a real <HI>Truth,</HI> when from the Throat of a possessed man, he said unto Mr. <HI>Balsome, If God would let me loose upon you I should find enough in the</HI> Best <HI>of you to make you all mine.</HI> And so truly there is in the best of us all, a party of <HI>Lusts</HI> which would <HI>resigne</HI> us up un∣to the power of all our other Enemies if the <HI>Grace</HI> of God prevent it not.

<HI>Faction in us,</HI> every man hath, as a sort of <HI>Master-Bee</HI> in the <HI>Hive,</HI> one <HI>peculi∣ar Lust,</HI> which he may call, as <HI>David</HI> did in Psal. 18.23. <HI>My own Iniquity.</HI> There is in every one of you, a <HI>Lust</HI> which above other you are most impatient to have <HI>Reproved</HI> or <HI>Restrained.</HI> A <HI>Lust</HI> which above other doth most <HI>Disquiet</HI> you and <HI>Discompose</HI> you in the Service of God; a <HI>Lust</HI> which gives most fre∣quent <HI>Eclipses</HI> unto the <HI>Light</HI> of God's Coun∣tenance upon your souls. Of <HI>This</HI> let me say as he about the King of <HI>Israel</HI> in 1. <HI>Reg.</HI> 22.31. <HI>Fight neither with small nor great</HI> in compari∣son of This. The <HI>Braining</HI> of this <HI>Giant</HI> is of as much Importance perhaps as any one thing in your <HI>Warr-fare,</HI> as having an Influ∣ence upon the Prosperity of it all.</P>
<P>However they that write <HI>De re Militari,</HI> lay this down as a Maxime, <HI>Quicquid tibi prodest, Adversario nocet</HI>; Whatever is <HI>profi∣table</HI> for you is <HI>pernicious</HI> for your Adversa∣ry: That <HI>This</HI> is <HI>both,</HI> who can make any Doubt?</P>
<P>Now what shall be done in order here∣unto? <HI>This,</HI> Follow the <HI>Teachings</HI> of the <HI>Lord.</HI> Let the <HI>Death</HI> of Him that is <HI>Gene∣ralissimo</HI> of all the Celestial Armyes <HI>teach</HI> you what to do; He has <HI>Dyed</HI> in part for this

Reason, that he might instruct you in the right way of <HI>Warring</HI> and <HI>Fighting</HI> against the Enemies whom His <HI>Death</HI> hath also been the <HI>Price</HI> of your <HI>Redemption</HI> from. This then you have to do. Let your <HI>Principal Corrup∣tion</HI> be put unto such a <HI>Death</HI> as your Dy∣ing Saviour has given a <HI>Semplar</HI> of. It is said by the Apostle in <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.4. That we must be <HI>dead to Sin,</HI> even as Jesus Christ <HI>dyed for sin.</HI> This is the <HI>sanctified Way</HI> of Dealing with that Son of <HI>Anack</HI> which creates the most <HI>Warr</HI> and <HI>Evil</HI> for you; Handle it with <HI>Severities</HI> analogous to those which Jesus Christ was Crucifyed withal. O then Receive this <HI>Mystery</HI> of <HI>Warring</HI> and <HI>Fighting</HI> against your <HI>own Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>Did not the <HI>Jews</HI> with uninterrupted and unwearied Clamours, urge their <HI>Governour,</HI> a∣gainst our Lord Jesus Christ, never ceasing their Out-cries, <HI>Let him be crucified!</HI> until they had their Will? Thus do you never leave <HI>Seeking</HI> and <HI>Sighing</HI> and <HI>Shouting</HI> unto God, <HI>Lord, this</HI> Corruption <HI>is worthy to dye; it is a Traiter to thy Kingdom in me; O by no meanes let it</HI> Reign <HI>and</HI> Rave <HI>in me as for∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery</HI>: Thus beg until God give Order, <HI>The Rebel shall dye.</HI></P>

Well, so do <HI>you</HI> lay unto the Charge of your <HI>Lust</HI> all the Dis∣honour to GOD, and all the Destruction to you and yours, which it has procured, Say,
<Q>Thou vile Corruption, <HI>Thou</HI> art it that hast made a Partition-Wall between me and my GOD; <HI>Thou</HI> art it that hast exposed me unto all the Curses in the <HI>Flying Roll</HI>; Nothing has done so much wrong to GOD, or to me, or to all Heaven and Earth, as <HI>Thou.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Speak and think the worst of it.</P>
<P>Moreover, Did they offer unto our Lord Jesus Christ all the <HI>Indignityes</HI> that possibly they could devise; Binding of Him, Spitting on Him, Jeering at Him, preferring a barba∣rous <HI>High-way man</HI> before Him, and at last <HI>hanging</HI> Him up <HI>naked</HI>? between the worst of Malefactors. In like manner do you cast heaps of Shame upon your <HI>Lust</HI>; Upbraid it as the <HI>Quintessence</HI> of <HI>Madness,</HI> as the <HI>Exaltation</HI> of <HI>Folly,</HI> as a most <HI>Loathesome Object,</HI> worthy to be <HI>Buffetted</HI> by all Hands, to be abhorred by God and man for ever; and a <HI>Swine,</HI> in no

<P>Once more, Did they with-draw all <HI>Refresh∣ment</HI> from our Lord Jesus Christ in His rue∣ful <HI>Agonies,</HI> and count a Cup of <HI>Gall</HI> good enough for Him? Just so Do you withhold from your <HI>Lust</HI> that <HI>Sustenance</HI> which may enable it to hold out in its Insurrections. Be sure to <HI>make no provision</HI>▪ for this <HI>Flesh</HI> to feed upon. <HI>Starve</HI> it out, and so <HI>Tame</HI> it; Keep it under, and keep it <HI>bare</HI> of those things which you see to be the <HI>Support</HI> or <HI>Fuel</HI> of it.</P>
<P>To say no more, Did they <HI>Torture</HI> our Lord Jesus Christ, until by the <HI>Dolours</HI> of His Wounds they hunted that <HI>Hind of the morn∣ing,</HI> his precious Soul, out of His Body? Agree∣ably to this, Do you make your <HI>Lust</HI> under∣go the <HI>Pains</HI> of an <HI>evil and a bitter thing.</HI> Let it Cost you those <HI>Prayers</HI> and those <HI>Tears,</HI> and manifold <HI>Austerities</HI> which may meer∣ly <HI>tire</HI> it out, and Discourage it from <HI>haunt∣ing</HI> of you.</P>
<P>By these means cripple that <HI>Delictum dilect∣um,</HI> which is your most <HI>Darling Iniquity.</HI> And while you are thus in the <HI>Field,</HI> derive all the <HI>Virtue</HI> which may be, from abundant <HI>Thoughts</HI> on the <HI>Death</HI> of Jesus Christ.
