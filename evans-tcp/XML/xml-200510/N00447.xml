<OPENER><SALUTE>To all the Honest LORDS and COMMONS of ENGLAND.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GEntlemen, the great God, by his Wonder∣ful Providence, hath brought about such a Revolution in <HI>England,</HI> as doubtless no Hi∣story can parrallel, unless that in Sacred Writ, of delivering the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> out of <HI>Egypt</HI>; and this, I think, is little Inferiour to that, if we consider it in all its circumstances: And now, Gentlemen, having a <HI>King</HI> after our own Hearts, one that is as Truly and Rightfully our <HI>King</HI> as ever was in <HI>England,</HI> I know not what can be more clearly De∣monstrated, unless God had sent us one immediately from Heaven it self, and said from thence, by a loud Voyce, <HI>You Good Men of</HI> England, <HI>this Man I have sent down to be your</HI> King: We have the Voyce that is next unto this, that is, <HI>Vox Populie,</HI> The Voyce of the People; and that by a common saying is <HI>Vox Dei,</HI> the Voice of God: And you Gentlemen, the Good Peo∣ple of <HI>England,</HI> have engaged this our <HI>King</HI> upon as Good and Glorious a Work as ever by a Man was undertaken; that is, to pull down the Great <HI>French Bear,</HI> that <HI>most Christian Turk,</HI> the Great Tyrant of the Earth, and Hater of Mankind; you have pro∣mised to this our Good <HI>King,</HI> to stand by him with your Lives and Fortunes; and he in order to facilli∣tate this Great and Good Work, hath engaged potent Allyes both by Sea and Land to help you; and now things stand in so fair a way, and you have laid your Hand to the Plough, look not back; for not only our <HI>King</HI>'s Honour, but Yours, and all that is dear to you is Engaged to go on; and leave not off until by Gods help you have finished the Work; it is a so∣lid, great and good Work; and no Trifling and Jest∣ing
<PB N="2" REF="000569_0002_0FA7114252903280"/>
Business; therefore it concerns you Highly, Faith∣fully and Dilligently, without loss of any more time Heartily to assist the <HI>King</HI> in this Business; and your Assistance must be a threefold Assistance. The First, with advice; the <HI>Second,</HI> with <HI>Money</HI> and the Third with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if other of these in their place and time is wanting, you cannot expect to have the Work done. All Men agree, that <HI>Money</HI> is the Sinnews of <HI>War,</HI> and <HI>Men</HI> the <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Bones</HI> to these Sinnews; but it is <HI>good Advice</HI> that is the <HI>Blood</HI> &amp; <HI>Brains</HI>; that makes these <HI>Sinnews, Flesh</HI> and <HI>Bones</HI> to move regularly; therefore says the Wise-man, <HI>With good Advice make War</HI>; and when once begun, I am sure <HI>Good Advice</HI> is absolutely necessary to carry it on: therefore I say, Advise the <HI>King</HI> what Men to chuse as most fit to be used in all <HI>Places</HI> and <HI>Offices,</HI> both <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Milita∣ry</HI>; its not beneath the <HI>King</HI> in this Great and Weigh∣ty Affair to take your Advice, as believing him to be a Wise-man; and the wisest of Kings has said, <HI>In the multitude of Councellors there is safety</HI>; you have seen the false steps that have been already taken, and what Loss and Dammage, besides Disgrace, that has been thereby; and who have been the Advisers therein, nor only in the never to be forgotten miscarriage in the Fleet last Year, but those before in <HI>Yrland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> it self, and else where; I say, it is your duty to Advise the taking in of Faithful Labourers into this Harvest, Men of approved Honour, Courage, Ho∣nesty and Integrity; the <HI>King</HI> will stand in need of the help of all the Hands and Hearts of his Good Sub∣jects in this Work, here will be Work for all the Dogs to Bait this Bear. 'Tis not all the <HI>God Dammy-Dogs</HI> in <HI>England</HI> that will take this <HI>French Bear</HI> by the Nose and pull him down; no, it must be all the Dogs to∣gether whether <HI>Episcopal, Presbyterian, Independant, Annabaptist, Quietist</HI> and <HI>Jansenist</HI>; all sorts must have a Hand in this Work; yea, <HI>Papists</HI> themselves, all but that one sort of <HI>Jesuited Papists,</HI> and those are the fast Friends of this great <HI>French Tyrant,</HI> and will be∣tray all to him where ever they are Intrusted; there∣fore if any such be in <HI>England,</HI> in any disguise, they are not to be Trusted, but a watchful Eye ought to be upon them. A <HI>Second</HI> Sort, not to be Employed nor Trusted, are those that have been the <HI>Betrayers of the Nation</HI> under the late Reigns, those that in for∣mer Reigns had brought the Nations almost to <HI>Deaths Door,</HI> are the Men that would make the Cure and Re∣covery of them as Tedious and as Chargeable as they can, that so the Nations might never have time to call them to a Reckoning: I will never chuse him to be my Doctor, that has once endeavoured to Poyson me: I will never put him in a great Post to help pull down <HI>France,</HI> that has been a chief Instrument to raise him up to his Greatness; that has been a <HI>Pen∣sioner</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> and made his own Fortunes by Betray∣ing the Nations to him, as far as was in his Power. I hope, Gentlemen, amongst the <HI>Honest Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> there is not such a Barrenness a∣mong you, but that a Number sufficient may be found out as may be able with the <HI>King</HI> to carry on this great Work with Courage and Conduct; such as have been Faithful to the Nations Interest under the late Reign and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are; It is the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Pur∣ses of the <HI>Honest Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>King,</HI> wi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat must <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d if any be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in faithfulness <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what will soon follow; that is, you will become <HI>Vas∣sals and Peasants to France,</HI> which then to be, is bet∣ter to be out of the World; for matters are now so Constituted, there is no medium: Have a care of taking any more false steps, lest you tumble down, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ketch you in his <HI>Teeth</HI>; if he does, he will Te<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to pieces, without mercy; for he knows none; and then, as we have an <HI>English</HI> Pro∣verb, <HI>Instead of ketching a Tarter, a Tarter has caught you</HI>; which God prevent. Your Neighbours will be soon weary in helping you, if you play any more foul play with them, and will not take right mea∣sures to help your selves; and if it be Work enough for you altogether, I doubt you will find it too hard a Task for your selves alone, if they be justly pro∣voked to leave you to his Rage; for the <HI>Bear</HI> would willingly give them Honourable Terms, so that they would but leave you alone, to be under his Paws; therefore shew your selves Wise and Honest Men whilst you have so good Neighbours to help you: In order therefore to the speedy carrying on this Great and Good Work, lay a good foundation, clear away all the <HI>Rubbish,</HI> begin first amongst your selves, see your own House first swept and cleansed; from all Filth of Dust and Rubbish, and cleansed from Cob∣webs and Spiders, and other Vermin: chuse such to Represent you that are Men of <HI>Honour, Vertue, Cou∣rage, Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Honesty</HI>; and not by the <HI>Great Estate,</HI> the <HI>Great Titles,</HI> the <HI>fine Laced Coats,</HI> the <HI>fine smoothed Tongues,</HI> who only can make thereby fine Speeches, to make the better Bargains for them∣selves by making Markets of you. Chuse none to Re∣present you that are of little narrow Souls, Self-de∣signing and Self-seeking Fellows, that will Sell you to the <HI>French King</HI> for a Place or Pension; Let none Represent you that have had either: Sell not your <HI>Birth-Right</HI> for a <HI>Mess of Pottage</HI>; Sell not your <HI>Li∣berty</HI> for <HI>Strong-Beer</HI> and ROST BEEF: Let not the <HI>Black-Gown</HI> of <HI>Lawyer</HI> or <HI>Gospeller</HI> be Consulted by you, in your choice, but if they will make a Noyse for this or the other, unless you know them well in your own Judgment to be Honest Men; be you sure otherwise to go contrary to them; for those two sorts are seldom in the right, if they are, its for the most part against their Wills: without you make a good Choice your selves, and cleanse your own House of the Dust and Rubbish, you cannot expect to perswade the other House to cleanse theirs.</P>
<P>We have now a <HI>King</HI> that is Hearty with us in this Great and Good Work, not only to help pull down the Great <HI>Tyrant of France,</HI> but also is desirous to have us well Established at Home, upon a <HI>Good, Honest</HI> and <HI>Just Foundation</HI>; I mean, our <HI>Antient</HI> and <HI>Just Rights</HI> and <HI>Priviledges</HI> and I am sure, no Honest
<PB N="3" REF="000569_0003_0FA711430A9C2408"/>
<HI>English</HI> Man desires more; and therefore let us be Hearty and Honest to the <HI>King</HI> in sticking close to him to help, that both these Great and Necessary Works may be both finished in His Time: In order to it, pull down those amongst your selves that stand in the Way, and hinder both; it is the Work of those that betrayed Us and our Liberties under the Late Reigns to hinder a Reformation in this all they can; therefore let none of them Represent you: if you would have a good and easie pair of Shoes, you will chuse the best Workman you can; if you are Sick, you will have Advice of the most skilful Doctor; so now, while we have a <HI>King</HI> that is Hearty with us in this Great and Necessary Work engaged in against this <HI>French Tyrant,</HI> chuse <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Represent you as will be Courageous in this Great Work, and will go on Roundly in it; and by faithful Advising Him, make the Work as easie to Him and as speedy as may be; chuse not such as have been old State Quacks, and tried Experiments upon you, and Robbed you of your <HI>Treasure</HI> and <HI>Liberties,</HI> and which is worst of all, of your <HI>best Blood,</HI> which is never to be reco∣vered again: Chuse such as will serve you Heartily out of <HI>Love to their Country</HI> and <HI>Good of the Publick,</HI> without <HI>Little Self-designing Ends</HI> and <HI>Tricks</HI> of <HI>Places</HI> and <HI>Preferments</HI>; if you neglect this Opportunity, God knows whether ever you may have another: if it be not now done in this <HI>King's</HI> time, Your Attempts e∣ver after may be in vain, and to as much purpose as giving <HI>Aqua vitae</HI> to a Dead Man; if you do not the Work now, while we have such Powerful Alleys, we cannot expect to do it when we are alone; but may justly expect to be pulled down our selves, as a Just Judgment of God upon us. You have Spectacles of this <HI>Bear</HI>'s Clemency to His own Subjects with you; do you expect better Quarter from His <HI>Apo∣stolical Dragoons</HI> then Born <HI>French-men</HI>? do you believe <HI>Father Peters</HI> and the Rest of His <HI>Brethren</HI> have more Tenderness for you than He had for them? do you believe the Devil is turned Saint since then? You can have nothing but Fire and Sword if that day comes; but the Lord give you Wisdom to Act as Men, to pre∣vent it; therefore take <HI>Time</HI> by the Forelock, that it may not be said of <HI>England, Post est Occasio Calva.</HI> A <HI>House of Commons,</HI> rightly and wisely Chosen, under such a Wise and Valliant <HI>King</HI> as we now have, what Great Works may they not do in a little time; may not only break the Yoak of the <HI>French Tyrant,</HI> but al∣so make His Dear Brother and Alley the <HI>Great Turk</HI> to pull in His Horns; this is a Brave and Honour∣able Work becoming the <HI>Commons of England.</HI></P>
<P>But it may be Objected, <HI>There is a Sort of a dead Weight of Spiritual and Temporal Wickedness in High Places in a few little Men, laden with a great deal of Sin and great Titles, and these will hinder the Good Work all they can.</HI> Do but you take care of a Good <HI>House of Commons,</HI> and then the other will purge of it self; a Good <HI>House of Commons,</HI> full of the Living Weight of Honour and Honesty, that will weigh down all the Dead Weight of the other, and affright them into their two little Senses; if the Head be good, and the Body sound at Heart, its no matter whether there be a fine Laced Coat on, or a Feather in the Cap; keep the Fountain clean, and then the Streams will be sweet and clean; for it is the <HI>Commons</HI> make the Good Lords, as the Clark makes the Justice; therefore Honest Brother Commoners, see you well to your Duty, and take this along with you, <HI>You can never serve your God tru∣ly, if you vvill for private Gains and Ends be a Traytor to your Country:</HI> Let him be Clothed with what Ti∣tles he pleases, and have a Cloak with what Badges of Honour can be given, yet it will not hide his Kna∣very, the Devil cannot hide his cloven Foot; and tho' an Ill Man be Cloathed like an Angel of Light, yet his Work will shew him to be a Child of Darkness, and a Son of Perdition; and his Words, tho' smooth as Oyl and Butter, yet will be discovered to be as drawn Swords.</P>
<P>When Kings took the Cream of the Milk, the best and choicest of the <HI>Commons,</HI> and conferred Titles of Honour on them, they became their Honour well, and made good <HI>Lords,</HI> and things went on well, and good Laws were made, when both Houses studyed the publick Good; but in the late Reigns, when the Scum of the Pot, the Dregs and Dross of the <HI>Com∣mons</HI> were advanced to Titles of Honour, as too many were, what can you expect from such Crea∣tions of such Creatures to such Honours? Surely <HI>Trim Tram,</HI> like Master like Man; <HI>when the Righ∣teous beareth Rule, the People Rejoyce; but when the wicked beareth Rule, the People Mourn. Wo to that man, or that Nation, that shall call Good Evil and Evil Good; and that shall call Light Darkness, and Dark∣ness Light.</HI> All the Priests in the World shall never make me believe, that in the little Wafer of Bread, after the Priest hath in a few words conjured with a <HI>Hocus Pocus</HI> over it, that it contains the Real and whole Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ, as it was offered up upon the Cross; no more than I will be∣lieve all the <HI>Irish</HI> Evidences in Swearing a Plot of the <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> to seise the Body of <HI>King Charles</HI> the Second at <HI>Oxford</HI>; nor no more will I believe those will help to save us under this Reign, that helped to ruin us in the former; but that, (on the contrary) they will do all they can to embarras the present King's and Nation's Affairs, and make our Deliverance as difficult as they can; every Tree is known by its Fruit; I will see good Fruits of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Repentance before I will believe their Conversion i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> true, and that they are hearty in with us: <HI>Men tha<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are in Honour, and understand not, are like the Beasts tha<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> perish;</HI> and <HI>A Man that is in Honour for Betray<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing his Country, it becomes him exactly as well as A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mour doth a Hogg on Horsback, or a Jewel in a Swine Snout</HI>: And here I will subjoyn the Speech of Noble and Brave Lord, spoken in the <HI>Lobby</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>House of Lords,</HI> just after he came out of the Hous<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as I supposed, in a heat, and not well pleased; what was then debating in the House, he spake the purpose following, and as near as I can reme<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ber

will give you his own words, I being then pre∣sent;
<Q>To God! we shall have such a House shortly, that a man of Honour or Honesty will scorn to come within their Walls; one is made a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for a Court Job, and another for Betraying his Country, and a third for Ten Thousand Pound, and a fourth because he is the Son of a whore; that shortly the honest Mob will come and tear us all to pieces for being a Company of Rogues: whereas formerly the Nobility were the Honour of the Nation in screening the people from Arbitrariness and Tyranny, and go forth in the Heads of the People in fighting <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eir Battles, and for doing them Justice, when by other Courts they were oppressed, whereas now they are for Suppressing and Destroying the People &amp; their Liberties.</Q>
It is the Honour <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bear to this Noble Lord that makes me mention it, to show the World the Opinion of an Honest Lord, and to quicken you the Honest <HI>Commoners</HI> to cleanse your House, and then you may help your Neighbours to cleanse theirs. <HI>How can you see the Moa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that is in your Brother's Eye, and cannot see the Beam that is in your own Eye.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I Repine not at the Ruin of my self and Family in your Service, for your Sakes, and for the preserving of you; No, I am so far from it, that I bless God for it; and count it all Honour that I was born for your sakes, and for your service, and that God so wonderfully call'd me out in it in so crittical an hour, and that he enabled me faithfully (I thank him for it) to discharge my Duty therein to you; and I am still ready with my Life to serve you, if that will do you good, if you will but be doing your Duties to help to serve and save your selves, now God has put an Opportunity into your Hands; but if you will not, you cannot say but you have had fair warning. I am at present in the midst of a peo∣ple that will, I hope, do the part of honest and rea∣sonable Men to keep and preserve their Liberties, and consider the dear Price their Forefathers paid for them: I know some of our Crack-brains call them <HI>a sort of Thick-scull'd People, Dull,</HI> and <HI>Phlegmatick;</HI> but they have shewed to the world they are a <HI>brave thinking</HI> and <HI>wise People</HI>; though but a little spot of Ground to the rest of the world, yet have not only in some measure, though hardly on all sides, envied and be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et by the Tyrants of the Earth, preserved their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iberties, when our Generation madly parted with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll theirs at once, which our Fathers but just before <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad so hardly strugled for. I wish it might not be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>id by other Nations of our Nation in this Genera∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on, <HI>that we are an Unthinking People</HI>; and that (like <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>French) Our Sculls are so thin that our Brains are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vaporated, and are become a Bedlam Land, rather than wise and Sober People.</HI> I say, these People have not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> preserved with great Struglings good part of their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>berties, but procured us an Opportunity to have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> keep ours, if we have but wisdom to see it. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hank God and Them for preserving my Life when <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for; therefore (as in gratitude bound) I will <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their good and service with all the little ta∣lents that are left me, and that God hath entrusted me with, to the utmost of my power, whilst I have a day to live. I find among these people a sense of the Evils and Mischiefs of the growing Power of <HI>France</HI> here; even the <HI>Papists</HI> themselves are sorry at the French's taking of <HI>Monts,</HI> all but such as are <HI>Jesuited Papists</HI>; whereas I hear in England you have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, who call themselves Protestants, that Rejoice in the taking of <HI>Monts</HI>; I cannot but believe they are <HI>Jesuited Papists</HI> in M<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>uerade, to be sure are no Friends to <HI>King William</HI> and <HI>Queen Mary,</HI> and the <HI>Protestant Religion</HI> and <HI>Interest,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the <HI>general Liberty</HI> and <HI>Good of Mankind</HI>: Have a strict and watchful Eye upon such men in your Choice of your Repre∣sentatives; be sure oppose whom they are for. If two things were truly and honestly done, it would go a great way towards your speedy coming into good order of Settlement in Government; and that is, Impartially to have laid open the Cheats and Tricks of the <HI>Lavvyers</HI> and <HI>Gospellers</HI>; for the latter of them I can lay my finger and point to a man that promi∣sed it on this side the Water; there are two of them that well understand it, and can do it to the life; but for one of them, I give him over, as being past hope of recovery to do any good thing, like as in another case a man said of himself, <HI>vvhen he vvas</HI> Cardinal, <HI>he had a little hope of his being saved; but vvhen he vvas</HI> Pope <HI>he had none at all.</HI> But for the other person, I have some little hopes that he is not past Grace, but hath some sparks yet left to serve his Country, and Mankind in general. For a man to display the Lawyer and his Tricks, that I leave amongst you to find out an honest man, that is wil∣ling and able to do it to the life. God grant it may not as truly be said of <HI>England</HI> in this day as our Sa∣viour Christ said of <HI>Jerusalem, O! that thou hadst seen the things that belong to thy Peace in this thy day, but novv they are hid from thine Eyes.</HI> Gentlemen, do but what is in your Power, and what is your Du∣ty to do, required both by the Law of Nature and the Law of the Land; when you do that, you shall have Peace in your selves, though you miss of the Good you aimed at: When your <HI>ovvn House</HI> is clean∣sed, you may impeach the Ill Men in the other; and until you do that, you cannot expect to do any Great Things: but on the contrary, while your Represen∣tatives should be doing their Duties in their places for the Nation, they make use of your Sholders to lift them up into an Office, whereby to make their own Houses Great, and yours Little, and care not if yours were burned, so they might but warm their hands by it: if you make not some of these Exam∣ples of your Justice, you must never expect to be well served, but on the contrary always betray'd; without a due Regulation be in these great Points, you will be always groping in the Dark, and never come to Light: <HI>If the Blind lead the Blind, they must all fall into the Ditch at last</HI>: and without speedy Care taken, you must fall into the Ditch the <HI>French King,</HI> the <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Jesuits,</HI> with the <HI>Lavvyers</HI> and <HI>Gos∣pellers,</HI>

and our old State Quacks, have made for you: if you effectually cleanse your two <HI>Houses,</HI> and lay a good Foundation, then you may hope the Su∣perstr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/> will stand fast; but if you build upon a Sandy Foundation, that must be blown down in a Storm, and such a Storm as never yet the like was seen in the World, that I believe is near at hand; God grant it be not a <HI>Hurricane</HI> to poor <HI>England</HI>; the Clouds are very thick and dark; God give you Wisdom.</P>
<P>But methinks I hear some Object, and say, <HI>The</HI> Commons <HI>of</HI> England <HI>are for a</HI> Common-Wealth.</P>
<P>If by a <HI>Common-Wealth</HI> is meant a <HI>Common Good,</HI> that I dare say every honest man is for; but if by a <HI>Common Wealth</HI> is meant <HI>a Government vvithout a</HI> King; that I do believe is not meant nor designed by any honest Man: But I do believe, that there are a sort of persons that do buz such things into the King's Ears, to make him jealous of his People, and there∣by to disable him from doing any great things, and by that means serve the <HI>Interest</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> and may have good store of <HI>Levvedores</HI> for their pains: but I doubt not but the King will see through the Designs of this sort of men, that they are nothing but Shams and Lyes, done on purpose to abuse him, and to secure themselves from the Justice of the Nation. This farther I will boldly say, Those that buz these things in the Kings Ears, if any such be, they are the Kings greatest Enemies, and would Mislead the King to follow the Course of the last Reigns, on purpose to bring all into Confusion, knowing no other and better way to serve their dearly beloved <HI>French King,</HI> and themselves escape Vengeance. I doubt not but the King sees his rtue Interest, and will stick by those good Motives that in∣duced him to hazard all to Rescue these Nations from Popery and Slavery; and the King is so wise a Man, that no old or new <HI>treacherous corrupted Courtiers</HI> shall ever make a <HI>Division</HI> and <HI>Jealousie</HI> between <HI>him</HI> and his <HI>People</HI>; it is that which they foment for their own In∣terests, but hope they shall never attain it: I dare be bold to answer for the honest People of <HI>England,</HI> they are willing to keep in their old state of <HI>Kingly Govern∣ment</HI>; between a <HI>Common VVealth,</HI> and an <HI>Absolute Government of Tyranny</HI>: but the old <HI>Troublers</HI> of our <HI>Israel</HI> will prevent our Peace and good Settlement, if they can.</P>
<P>I know, in some forreign parts it hath been cast in the Teeth of the <HI>English, That they are a Quarrelsome, Disquiet, and Troublesome People, and are never satisfied, but are almost every Age Quarrelling vvith their</HI> Govern∣ment, <HI>falling-out vvith their</HI> Kings, <HI>and no</HI> King <HI>can please them.</HI></P>
<P>For Answer, I dare affirm, that the plain honest People of <HI>England</HI> are as <HI>Quiet</HI> and as <HI>Governable</HI> a Peo∣ple, as any People in the World; but if in an Ill-de∣signing <HI>King</HI>'s Reign, he shall, with the Help of his <HI>Flattering</HI> and <HI>Ill designing Courtiers</HI> and <HI>Evil Councellors,</HI> with some pickt out of the Scum of the <HI>Commons,</HI> shall with them endeavour to undermine their <HI>Liberties,</HI> and invade their <HI>Properties,</HI> and by <HI>Oppressing</HI> some and <HI>Destroying</HI> others, by illegal Practices, then none can wonder if the <HI>Commons</HI> stir in defence of their <HI>Religion, Lives</HI> and <HI>Liberties,</HI> as was our Case under the late Reigns; and some evil men are so impudent already as to be nibling at the same sport again; but I hope the King sees it, and will hearken to the Voice of his <HI>Com∣mons,</HI> and then things will go well; for it is the Strength of the Bodies and Purses of the <HI>Commons</HI> must do the <HI>French</HI> Business, and not a few flattering <HI>Scicophants,</HI> that were <HI>against</HI> his being <HI>King,</HI> and would now lift Him out of the Throne again, if the <HI>Commons</HI> did not stand by Him; those <HI>false Flatterers,</HI> with the help of the Jesuits Journey men, are making way for the French King as fast as they can; they some of them above board make a Noise for King <HI>James,</HI> but in reality join with the Jesuits for King <HI>Levves</HI>; He that has but half an Eye may see it; and most of the Priests are at that lay now, that they care not if the <HI>Devil vvere King,</HI> for then they cannot miss of being his Priests and Favorites, and have Power from him to plague the rest of M<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣kind besides; Therefore, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> when you have swept your House, order your Representatives to look among the Laws, and see where the <HI>Jesuits</HI> and <HI>Priests</HI> have had a Hand in making any of them▪ away with them, abrogate them out of Hand: and for my part, I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against any Bloody Laws barely for Religion; I am not for <HI>Hanging, Dravving</HI> and <HI>Quartering</HI> of a <HI>Priest Qua∣tinus</HI> as such, unless He disturb the Government; but I think it would be an excellent Law, <HI>to Geld all Priests that busie themselves about Government and State Affairs</HI>; it is the only way to tame them: if You do not some such thing, you must never expect to have Quiet. And some others also must feel your Justice in <HI>Terrorem</HI>; it seems to me, without it the Vengeance of God against the Nation cannot be appeased, nor any thing Prosper you undertake until that be done.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, was it not high time for the <HI>Commons</HI> to stir in this last Revolution, when all lay at the last gasp, brought to pass by the then Evil Ministers of State and Evil Councellors, with the Help of the Priests and Je∣suits? The Kings themselves could never have carried on the Metaphor without such Tools. And do you think, if the same Hands are again used, they will not be for doing again the same things? Yea, and bring the Na∣tion into a more Desperate Case than before, or they will miss of their aim. And will the Jesuits with their Partners and Journeymen, and their Friends in <HI>England,</HI> let go their Hold in <HI>England</HI>? No, not until their Fin∣gers are chopped off; there is a way will break all their Measures, and that very quickly too, if you can but once hit on it; but Temporizing will never do the Work; the Plough will never do good Work, and go on cleverly, that is drawn by an Ox and an Ass, let one Plough be drawn all by one Sort, and another by an∣other Sort; and see which makes best Work, and most riddance; a faithful, willing, dilligent Servant will dispatch more in a Day, than he that is only an Eye-Servant will do in two; if you will do fine Work, you must use fine Tools; and if you will do Honest Work, you must imploy Honest Men.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="000569_0006_0FA711452B7A5348"/>Is it not a fine sight (as I have seen) to have a Priest come into a Coffe-House, &amp; set himself at upper-end of the Table, &amp; there to hold forth for an Hour or two toge∣ther upon the Topicks of Politicks, &amp; never a Word of God all the while, unless it be to strengthen the Belief of his Assertion with a <HI>God damn me;</HI> and then <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> instruct their Auditors, who they must chuse for <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>liament Men,</HI> and who for <HI>Mayors</HI> and <HI>Sheriffs,</HI> and who for <HI>Aldermen</HI> and <HI>Common-Council-men,</HI> and the like? And others that do it not so publickly, but come in lesser Numbers to carry on the Metaphor, that are the <HI>Plurality men,</HI> and go to Taverns, and bowse good Sack.

<P>It is plain to me, that many of the Priests in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> are the <HI>Jesuites Journey-men,</HI> and carrying on their Work: when the Fox <HI>Preaches,</HI> then it is high time for the Geese and Hens to look to themselves; and when the Priests <HI>Preach</HI> upon Topicks of Polli∣ticks, and make a noise of the <HI>Church,</HI> then it is high time for the <HI>Commoners</HI> to look to their <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Priviledges,</HI> and to have a care of their Beef and Pud∣dings, and their Cabbidge and Bacon: You see plain enough in the late <HI>Revolution</HI> what made the <HI>Great men in the Church</HI> make a noise, and cry out <HI>Murder, Murder, Popery, Popery, Help, Help,</HI> when their own Pudding <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me to be touched, <HI>Magdalen-Colledge</HI> seized, and the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>London</HI> turned out, and the rest ex∣pected to follow after; then they began to make a Noise, but never before; when they could Domi∣neer, and Lord it over the Bodies and Consciences of the rest of Mankind; and they could <HI>Hang, Whip</HI> and <HI>Pillory, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ain</HI> and <HI>Destroy</HI> as many as they pleased, all was well <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them: the Honest People of <HI>England</HI> made a Noise <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> before of <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Slavery,</HI> but the <HI>Priests</HI> saw it not, they felt it not; nay, by most of them it was accounted a <HI>Plot of the Fanaticks against the Church, that did then but talk of Popery and Slave∣ry;</HI> they then could <HI>hold the Clothes of St. Steven Col∣ledge, and vvarm their hands at the Fire that burned his Bovvels,</HI> and Sing, <HI>O be Joyful,</HI> to see him Quar∣tered; but when the dear <HI>Magdalen-Colledge,</HI> their great <HI>Goddess Diana</HI> comes to be touched, then all the <HI>Church</HI> cries out, <HI>Help, Help, Murder, Murder, Good</HI> Prince of Orange <HI>come help us; O! help, help</HI>; but when that was done, they were quickly weary of him again; when their turn was served, they were for sending him back again; they only wanted to <HI>have King</HI> James <HI>put into a Box, tied Hand and Foot, locked fast up, and the Key in their keeping, and so to take him out to speak at their pleasure, and to put him in again at their pleas<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, when he had done their Work</HI>: but the <HI>Honest Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> were there too cunning for the <HI>Priests</HI>; in setting up <HI>King William</HI> and <HI>Queen Mary</HI> to be <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Queen,</HI> and they declared <HI>for the Birth-Right</HI> and <HI>Natural Liberty</HI> of all Mankind, the <HI>Liber∣ty of Conscience in the Worship of God:</HI> Alas!
