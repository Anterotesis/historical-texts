<P>In the Sacred Oracle now before us, behold, such a <HI>Fear</HI> Exemplified! <HI>Solomon</HI> the <HI>Wise,</HI> once wrote that <HI>Maxim</HI> of <HI>Wisdom, Happy is the man that Feareth alwayes.</HI> And he had the Exemple of his Blessed <HI>Father,</HI> to Inform him of, and confirm him in, such a <HI>Maxim.

of that <HI>Religion,</HI> whereto the <HI>Will of God</HI> obligeth us.

<P>First, There is in the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> a Reverent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>espect and Regard, unto all that ha's the <HI>Name</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God upon it.

In Allusion hereunto, the Apostle, speaking unto Believers, that are to be as the <HI>Angels,</HI> in the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>which cannot be moved,</HI> sayes, in Heb. 12.28, 29. <HI>Serve God Ac∣ceptably, with Reverence and with Godly Fear: For our God is a Consuming Fire</HI> In the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> we must Renounce the <HI>Service</HI> of all our <HI>Idols</HI>; We must no more Humour the <HI>Flesh,</HI> no more Follow the <HI>World,</HI> no more Gratify the Devil. And we must now so <HI>Devote</HI> our selves unto the <HI>Service</HI> of God, that we may be able to say, <HI>Lord, I am thy Servant, Devoted unto thy Fear</HI>! He is to be our <HI>Master</HI>; and we should leave no Room for that Expostulation, <HI>Where is my Fear?</HI> And, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> we must Address Him with our <HI>Worship.</HI> The <HI>Proselytes,</HI> which came in to Embrace the True <HI>Worship</HI> of God, have this Distinction, in Psal. 115.11. <HI>Yee that Fear the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord.</HI> In the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> we must <HI>Worship</HI> Him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho is <HI>Worthy to be Feared</HI>; and both the <HI>Natural,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the <HI>Instituted</HI> Worship of God, is to be con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inually performed with us, we are to be, as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce was, <HI>Devout Persons, who Fear God, and Pray <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lwayes</HI> unto Him.</P>

Divine Displeasure at Sin, as Drives us to our Lord Jesus Christ, for Salvation from Sin, and from the Displeasure of God against us for it.</HI> There never was any true <HI>Fear of God,</HI> in the Dayes of the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> but such as thought of and ran to a <HI>Messiah,</HI> as the Deliverer from the <HI>Wrath of God</HI>; and all the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> in the Dayes of the <HI>New Testament</HI>▪ acknowledges our Blessed <HI>Jesus</HI> as that <HI>Messiah.</HI> This is that <HI>Fear of God,</HI> which is the <HI>Beginning of Wisdom:</HI> This is tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Fear of God,</HI> wherein all men should be <HI>all the Day Long.</HI> This is the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> wherein we should continue <HI>all the Dayes that we Live upon the Earth.</HI> If thou dost not <HI>Walk in this Fear of God,</HI> O Man, Let thy <HI>Flesh Tremble for Fear,</HI> and be <HI>afraid of the Judgments,</HI> whereto thou dost make thy self ob∣noxious.

<P>Let us with a very <HI>Trembling Fear,</HI> be Afraid of the <HI>Judgments</HI> that are pronounced against the Ungodly, in the <HI>Book</HI> of God. There are used in our <HI>Longest</HI> and <HI>Sweetest</HI> Psalm, no less than Twelve several words, to signify the Reve∣lation which God had made of His Purpose, to Save men, by that <HI>Son of a Virgin,</HI> who was to <HI>break the Old Serpents Head</HI>: And one of those words, is, JUDGMENTS. This then is the In∣fluence, which the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, or the Discoveries which He has made of Himself in this Book of His, must have upon us: we should be able to say, as in Psal. 119.161. Lord, <HI>My Heart stands in Awe of thy Word.</HI> Are there any <HI>Prae∣cepts</HI> in this Book? we should <HI>Fear the Command∣ment: Fear,</HI> and Cry, <HI>Lord, I am afraid of break∣ing thy Holy Laws, that are so Holy and Just and Good!</HI> Are there any <HI>Promises</HI> in this Book? We should <HI>Fear, Lest we fall short of them.</HI> Are there any <HI>Threatnings</HI> in this Book? We should <HI>Fear, Lest they take hold of us.</HI> Before every thing in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Book of God, we should have the same Dis∣position, that <HI>Josiah</HI> had, when the Book of <HI>Deu∣teronomy</HI> was Read unto him; [The Jews have a Tradition, that by the special Disposal of Di∣vine Providence, the first place, which the <HI>Reader</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itt upon, was Deut. 28.36.] That it may be said unto us, <HI>Thy Heart was Tender, and thou didst Humble thy self before God, when thou didst Hear
<PB N="11" REF="000795_0009_0FAA5319EC983E98"/>
His Words.</HI> We should be Apprehensive of the Almighty <HI>God,</HI> speaking in every Line of this Book; and then, be <HI>Afraid,</HI> Lest all the <HI>Plagues written in this Book,</HI> overtake us, if we sin against such a God. It was the Character of our Lord Jesus Christ, in Isa. 66 2. <HI>He that is o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a poor and a contrite Spirit, and who Tremb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth at my Word.</HI> When we see what <HI>Judgments,</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> of God has Threatened against the <HI>Children of Disobedi∣ence,</HI> we should even fall a <HI>Trembling</HI> at them. And especially they that are conscious to a course <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f <HI>Disobedience</HI> against God, should be <HI>Afraid of these Judgments.</HI> When <HI>Belshazzar</HI> saw upon the Wall, an <HI>Hand-writing,</HI> which he could not Read, (because, perhaps, the Letters were so in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olded one among another, that except a man had the Key of the <HI>Cyphar,</HI> the Sentence was not easy to be <HI>Uncyphared,</HI>) he was wonderfully <HI>Terrified</HI> at what he saw. <HI>Unbelievers</HI> may Read <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat <HI>Hand-writing</HI> in this Book, <HI>If any man Believe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot the Son, the Wrath of God abideth on him:</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill you not be <HI>Afraid</HI> of that <HI>Wrath?

<P>There is one thing in the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, whereof we should alwayes be <HI>Afraid</HI>; that is, Lest we do make an Injudicious Interpretation of them. It is a caution given to us, in Psal. 36.6. <HI>Thy Judgments are a great Deep, O Lord</HI>;
<PB N="15" REF="000795_0013_0FAA531DB3665B10"/>
And we should be very cautious, Lest we drown our selves in such a <HI>Deep,</HI> when we go to Fathom it. The <HI>Judgments</HI> of God are those things, whereof 'tis said, <HI>Whose is Wise will Observe those things</HI>; but then we must be careful to proceed <HI>wisely</HI> in our observing of them. 'Tis a Dange∣rous Thing for us, to indulge our own <HI>Fancy,</HI> &amp; much more, for us to indulge our own <HI>Passion,</HI> in making of <HI>Glosses</HI> upon the <HI>Judgments of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d:</HI> God will not <HI>hold the man guiltless,</HI> who shall so <HI>take His Name in vain.</HI> Very sad Things may befal the <HI>People</HI> of God, which if we should call them the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, upon them, for some crime or other, this would be as great a crime in us▪ as to <HI>Adulterate</HI> the <HI>Coin</HI> of the Nation. The Soveraign God, has made a <HI>Cross,</HI> to be necessary for all the Disciples of Him, who Dy'd upon the <HI>Cross</HI>; and He will in His Infinite Soveraignty, make choice of their <HI>Cross</HI> for them, to Exercise their Virtue, and prepare them and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipen them, for His Heavenly Kingdom.

<HI>Judgments:</HI> It cannot but be a Satisfaction unto the Good <HI>Angels</HI> of the Lord, who are oftentimes the <HI>Executioners</HI> of these <HI>Judgments</HI>: It is an <HI>Holy</HI> Undertaking, and it cannot but Serve the Interests of Holiness; to make our modest Observations, upon the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, which have been Executed among us. As far as it may be Conve∣nient in this Discourse, I will now Address my self unto this undertaking. Sirs, Give me your <HI>Attention.</HI></P>
<P>When that Great Man, the Emperour <HI>Mauritius,</HI> beheld his Family overwhelmed in terrible Cala∣mities and Five Hopeful Branches of his Family Slain before his Eyes, he humbly Recited those words of the Psalmist, in Psal. 119 137▪ <HI>Righteous art Thou, O Lord, and Right are thy Judgments.</HI> My Neighbours, We have ever now and then, those Calamitous Things before our Eyes in our Neighbourhood, which, if we are not blind, we must pronounce, <HI>The Right Judgments of a Righte∣ous God.</HI> And I must now ask you, to take some Notice of those <HI>Judgments.</HI></P>
<P>I do most readily grant, that, <HI>Lubricus hic L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cus ac difficilis,</HI> tis no easy matter to <HI>Observe</HI> the <HI>Judg∣ments</HI> of God; We shall easily fall into the <HI>Extreams,</HI> of being either too <HI>Censorious,</HI> and <HI>Fanciful,</HI> or else too <HI>Negligent,</HI> in our <HI>Observation</HI> of the <HI>Divine Judgments.</HI> But yet the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, some∣times and so circumstanced, that, <HI>He who runs may Read them</HI>; and our Duty thereupon is described,
<PB N="28" REF="000795_0026_0FAA5329AB83D8C8"/>
in Psal. 64.9. <HI>All men shall fear, and they shall de∣clare the work of God, for they shall wisely consider of His doing.</HI> Learned men have complain'd of it, as a Defect in the Historical part of Learning, that there is not Extant an Impartial and a well-attested <HI>Historia Nemeseos,</HI> or, Account of Remar∣kable <HI>Judgments</HI> on Scandalous &amp; Notorious Of∣fendors. Yea, the God of Heaven Himself com∣plains of it, when men <HI>do not Regard His works, e∣ven, the operation of His Hands.</HI></P>
<P>I will now therefore, with all <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> lay before you, some of those <HI>Remarks,</HI> which I have made upon the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, that have been Executed in this Land. Sirs, <HI>The Lord ha's been Known by His Executing of</HI> these <HI>Judgments</HI>; Ac∣company them, with your <HI>Meditations</HI>!

<P>Take a due and a deep <HI>Notice,</HI> I beseech you, of the <HI>Notable Judgments</HI> with which we have seen the <HI>Contempt of the Glorious Gospel,</HI> Revenged by the God of Glory.

Truly, A very Terrible Event. I Re∣member a passage of Scripture, which runs thus in
<PB N="29" REF="000795_0027_0FAA532A6B97B6B8"/>
our Translation, Isa. 2.22. <HI>Cease ye from man, whose Breath is in his Nostrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of</HI>? But, if you please, you may thus understand it. The Prophet is denouncing the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, upon the Jewes, for their Des∣pising of the <HI>Messiah</HI>; and the Denunciati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n is thus Concluded: <HI>Now forbear as to that man,</HI> [or, cease from Offending and Provoking of Him,] <HI>who is now very Angry,</HI> [which the Hebrewes Express, by <HI>Breathe in the Nostrils,</HI>] for none is able to de∣clare, how <HI>high an Account is to be made of Him.</HI> Sirs, We have seen the God of Heaven <HI>very Ang∣ry</HI>; He ha's Breathed the Hot Lightnings of Death, out of His <HI>Nostrils</HI>; when People have made <HI>no Account</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of His Gospel.

engaged in Acts of Hostility against our people. Whereupon, ours, with a Force much Inferiour unto theirs, but with a marvellous valour and suc∣cess, in the Depth of Winter, made a Descent up∣on them. The Glorious Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> whom they had Slighted, was with our Army, and the Day was wonderfully carried against the Tawny Infidels. Their <HI>City</HI> was Laid in Ashes; Above Twenty of their <HI>Chief Captains</HI> were Killed; a proportionable Desolation cut off the Inferiour Salvages: Mortal <HI>Sickness,</HI> and Horrid <HI>Famine,</HI> pursued the Remainders of them: So that we can hardly tell, where any of them are left alive up∣on the Face of the Earth. <HI>Such was thy speedy Vengeance,</HI> O Blessed JESUS, <HI>on the Heathen that would not know thee, nor call upon thy Name.</HI></P>

<P>And there is another <HI>Contempt of the Gospel,</HI> which we have often seen another way chastised among us.

<P>There was an Old Professor, in one of our Churches, who being under the <HI>Admonition</HI> of the Church for some Offences, was by his Friends called upon, to Repent, and Reform, and Hum∣ble himself.

<P>A Reverend Minister of Christ, that often Served Him, in that very Pulpit, where these words are uttered, once observed a Son, to behave himself undutifully towards his Father, in the Ferry boat, which was carrying them over the River.

<P>I have <HI>Marked</HI> it, That those <HI>Places,</HI> which have kept up <HI>Divisions,</HI> and <HI>Strifes,</HI> and <HI>Schisms,</HI> have been direfully Smitten with <HI>Spiritual Plagues,</HI> the <HI>Plagues</HI> which are of all the direfullest. The most <HI>Lively Saints</HI> in those places, have been soon Snatch'd away by <HI>Death,</HI> one after another: The <HI>Power of Godliness</HI> hath been Lamentably lost a∣mong the Survivers, and a <HI>Leanness hath been sent into their Souls</HI>: The Work of <HI>Conversion</HI> hath been at a deadly stand, and the Rising Generati∣on hath <HI>pined away in their Iniquities.</HI> Yea, there was one Church among us, wherein an uncom∣fortable Rupture happened: and a Young man
<PB N="42" REF="000795_0040_0FAA5338D33BB0D8"/>
in the Town was left unto an horrid <HI>Self-Murder</HI>; he Drowned himself: But he left behind him a Writing directed unto his <HI>Father,</HI> wherein there was this among other passages; <HI>Father, My Ruine was, the Stubborness and Unfaithfullness of my Tender years; and Evil Counsil, and Evil Company; and, The Differences in the Church, by reason whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>of I grew Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and did not carry it in my place, as I ought, which is the wide way to Ruine.</HI> God make this Young man, our <HI>Warner</HI>; His Name was, <HI>Warner</HI>!</P>
<P>Again, I have <HI>Marked</HI> it, That those <HI>Persons,</HI> who have been the Grand Incendiaries, in <HI>Divi∣sions,</HI> have been often <HI>branded,</HI> with some Symp∣tomes of the Displeasure of God. Those Persons, have, been very Industrious to <HI>Blott</HI> the Names of other men; and at last, they themselves have Dy'd with a <HI>Blott.</HI> This indeed, is a point wherein we must be sparing; yet I may not forget, That a <HI>Council</HI> Sitting at a Town, for the Composing of some Ecclesiastical Differences, Our Venerable Old Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> saw one man to be Extreamly perverse above the rest, and most unreasonably, to disturb the Peace of the Church. Whereupon, that Zealous man, told the Council, he was Con∣fident, <HI>That the Jealously of God, would set a Mark upon that man, and that the Ordinary Death of men should not befal him.</HI> It happened a little while after this, that the man was barbarously Murder∣ed by the Salvages!</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="000795_0041_0FAA533A272C32C0"/>Again, There was a Quarrelsome <HI>Woman</HI> in a Church not far off; who having Accused a man in the Church, of a Fault that she could not prove, She yet remained so Irreconcileable, that she would never come to the <HI>Lords Table,</HI> as long as that man Lived. He Dying, she brag'd unto her Friends, That now she would go to the Sacra∣ment, at the Lords Table. One of them solemn∣ly told her, <HI>That she might yet Fear a Testimony of the Displeasure of God against her, for her Unchristian Absenting her self so long from that Ordinance.</HI> And, Lo, She Dyed Suddenly, Just before the <HI>Next Sa∣crament</HI> was to be Administred: [though she had the Repute of a Godly Woman.] Don't then, Don't <HI>Sow Discord</HI> any of you, lest you be an <HI>Abomination to the Lord.</HI> Be not Unpeaceable, or Unplacable; God is not pleased with the Froward.</P>

<P>We have made <HI>Idols</HI> of our <HI>Lands,</HI> and for the sake thereof, neglected almost all that is Holy, and Just and Good. There was a Time, when through the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, our <HI>Titles</HI> to them all were contested.</P>
<P>Litigious <HI>Law-Suits,</HI> were Scandalously multi∣plied among us. The <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, brought us into a Time, when the Extortions of the <HI>Law</HI> made a Cry among us.</P>

<P>Many people have <HI>Sinned Horribly,</HI> upon a pre∣sumption that they <HI>Sinned Secretly</HI>: But the <HI>Judg∣ments</HI> of God, have been wonderfully and pro∣digiously, and stupendously Display'd, in the Discovering of <HI>Secret Sinners,</HI> among us. <HI>David</HI> no doubt, promised himself, an Everlasting <HI>Se∣crecy,</HI> of his Transgression: <HI>Thou didst it Secretly,</HI> said the Prophet; And the Psalmist, calling to mind that word, own'd in Psal. 51.4. <HI>Against Thee, Thee only have I Sinned; And the Evil I have done in Thy Sight.</HI> None was <HI>privy</HI> to the Crime, except one man, who was a <HI>Partner</HI> in it.

<P>How many <HI>Secret Murders,</HI> have strangly been Discovered among us! And, I believe, there are yet more to be Discovered.</P>

<P><HI>But I'le never Confess,</HI> thinks many an Hard-hearted Sinner. <HI>No</HI>! So thought another man, whose Name I could mention.
