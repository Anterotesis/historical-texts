<Q>We are Distressed for you, <HI>O our BRETHREN,</HI> We are Distressed for you!</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>OUR Neighbourhood is, with Bitter An∣guish, pouring out the <HI>Lamentations,</HI> that were of old heard among the Peo∣ple of God, in Lam. 1.18. <HI>The Lord is Righteous, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> have Rebelled against His Command∣ment: Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> you, all people, and behold my Sorrow; My <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> men are gone into Captivity</HI>: And when we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, what a dreadful and what a doleful, and how inexpressibly miserable, <HI>Capti∣vity</HI> it is, that you are <HI>gone into</HI> the <HI>Lamentations</HI> of our <HI>Sorrow,</HI> do indeed become Inexpressible. But though we cannot Express the <HI>Agony</HI> of mind, that seizes us, when we do at our Full <HI>Tables,</HI> and in our Soft <HI>Lodgings,</HI> with all our <HI>Friends</HI> about us, call to mind, as we often do, <HI>How 'tis with you?</HI> yet we would Express a little of that <HI>Affection</HI> that we bear you, by Letting you know, <HI>That we Re∣member you.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="000830_0003_0FAB41276A7873A8"/>And as the <HI>Remembrance</HI> which we have of you, causes us, <HI>Without ceasing to make mention of you in our prayers,</HI> and our ardent and constant cries unto the <HI>God of all Grace,</HI> that you may have <HI>Grace</HI> to <HI>Help</HI> you, in your <HI>Time of Need,</HI> so, it puts us upon Writing unto you, those things, which may help to <HI>Instruct,</HI> &amp; <HI>Strengthen,</HI> &amp; <HI>Com∣fort</HI> you, in the midst of your Terrible <HI>Temptati∣ons. Jeremiah the Prophet,</HI> thought it his Duty, to Write a <HI>Letter</HI> unto those of his people, that were carried <HI>Captives,</HI> by a <HI>Bitter and Hasty Nation.</HI> Any from a sense of Duty it is, that we now send a <HI>Letter</HI> unto you, for your Consolation, in that <HI>Cap∣tivity,</HI> where you are now Languishing under <HI>Bitter,</HI> and <HI>Heavy,</HI> Afflictions. Indeed, When the <HI>Israelites</HI> of old, were in the cruel and grievous Hands of their <HI>Egyptian Task Masters,</HI> we read, <HI>They hearkened not unto Moses, for Anguish of Spirit, &amp; for cruel Bondage.</HI> But we hope, that all the <HI>Anguish of Spirit,</HI> &amp; <HI>Cruel Bondage,</HI> which you suffer from worse than <HI>Egyptian Task masters,</HI> will not hinder you, from <HI>Hearkening</HI> to those Admonitions which must now be given you.</P>
<P>Now in the first place, We must let you know, That we are very much concerned, for your be∣ing preserved <HI>Faithful unto the Death,</HI> in that <HI>Chri∣stian Faith,</HI> which you have hitherto professed. We earnestly beg it of God for you, that what∣ever <HI>Miseries</HI> you undergo, you may not, in a vain Hope of <HI>Deliverance</HI> from those Miseries, Renounce the <HI>Christian Religion.</HI> Those Wretch∣ed

<HI>Renegado's,</HI> who have abandoned the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> Expecting thereby to mend their Condi∣tion in the World, have not always had their Ex∣pectation answered; The dreadful Vengeance of God, hath sometimes filled them with confusion, by causing their Oppressors afterwards to sleight them, and vex them, and more barbarously than ever to multiply Oppressions upon them. Or, if you should get any Abatement of your <HI>Daily Bur∣dens,</HI> by becoming <HI>Apostates</HI> from the <HI>Christian Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gion,</HI> yet the Jealous God can smite you with such Horror of <HI>Conscience</HI> in this World, for your <HI>Apo∣stasy,</HI> as would be more Intollerable than all the Torments that you ever yet Endured; and He will certainly punish it with the <HI>Vengeance of Eter∣nal Fire in the World to come, where the Smoke of your Torments will Ascend for ever and ever.</HI> We do, with a most unutterable <HI>Sympathy,</HI> feel your mise∣ries; and we would gladly do and spend all we can, to Rescue you, from them: Nevertheless, we had rather you should Endure all manner of <HI>Tem∣poral Miseries,</HI> than Incur <HI>Eternal</HI> Ones: We had rather a <HI>Turk</HI> or a <HI>Moor</HI> should continually Tram∣ple on you, than that the <HI>Devil</HI> should make a <HI>prey</HI> of you. The Great God hath said concerning His <HI>Christian Religion, If any man draw back from it, my Soul shall have no pleasure in him.</HI> Nor, can you do a Thing more <HI>Displeasing</HI> to <HI>our Souls,</HI> or, <HI>Destructive</HI> to <HI>your own,</HI> than to Backslide from that <HI>Holy Religion.</HI> Truly, Its being as we have called it, <HI>An Holy Religion.</HI> That one Thing is
<PB N="5" REF="000830_0005_0FAB4128EA3B6E90"/>
enough to give you, an Everlasting Assurance of its being, <HI>The way of Truth,</HI> and the <HI>only Religion</HI> worthy to be Embraced and Maintained, with a <HI>Reasonable man.</HI> There is nothing in that <HI>Religion,</HI> wherein you have been Educated, but what hath a Tendency to promote <HI>Vertue:</HI> it allows no such vicious <HI>Pride,</HI> and <HI>Revenge,</HI> and <HI>Selfishness,</HI> and <HI>Fil∣thiness,</HI> and <HI>Sensuality,</HI> as is countenanced in all other <HI>Ways of Worship.</HI> If men would live in all things according to that <HI>Religion,</HI> which you have had the Happiness to be acquainted withal, they would be <HI>Angels</HI> rather than <HI>Men</HI>; and they are <HI>Bruits</HI> rather than <HI>Men,</HI> that would not count them so. It is impossible, that any but <HI>God,</HI> should be the <HI>Author</HI> of such an <HI>Holy Religion.</HI> And, What <HI>Religion</HI> else can you meet withal, that makes any such <HI>Reasonable Provision</HI> for the <HI>Recon∣ciliation</HI> of a Sinner to the God, whom he hath offended by Sin? The <HI>Superstitions</HI> practised a∣mong the desolate Nations of the Earth, to obtain the <HI>Pardon of Sin,</HI> are so Idle, so Absurd, so Ridi∣culous, that it is an admirable Enchantment on a∣ny part of mankind, which has made them con∣tented with such practices▪ But now, when you see the Methods for the <HI>Pardon of Sin,</HI> in that <HI>Re∣ligion,</HI> wherewith you have been Illuminated; when you see the Son of <HI>God,</HI> becoming a <HI>Man,</HI> and this <HI>God man,</HI> gloriously Living, and Dying, and Rising again, for to furnish poor Sinners Be∣lieving on Him, with a <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which will Entitle us unto Everlasting Blessedness, you cannot
<PB N="6" REF="000830_0006_0FAB4129AA252F40"/>
but say▪ There is a wonderful Majesty in this way of <HI>Reconciling</HI> a Sinner unto God; and the Glories of the <HI>most High,</HI> are therein display'd un∣to the <HI>Heighth.</HI> If you should be so Foolish, as to forego your Blessed <HI>Religion,</HI> for the sake of any other, you will by that Folly leave your selves, without all <HI>Hope</HI> of a <HI>Pardon</HI> for your Sins; for none other will put you into any <HI>way</HI> for a <HI>Par∣don,</HI> that you can justly think-sufficient or agreea∣ble. 'Twere better a thousand times to <HI>Dy,</HI> with such an <HI>Hope</HI> of a <HI>Pardon</HI> for <HI>Sin,</HI> as your Glorious <HI>Religion</HI> sets before you, than to <HI>Live</HI> in all the <HI>pleasure</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> under the <HI>Blackness of Darkness,</HI> which every other must Leave upon you. But God hath done enough, &amp; enough, to satisfy you in the <HI>Truth</HI> of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> by what was done for &amp; by the Illustrious JESUS, the Author of this <HI>Reli∣gion</HI>▪ The <HI>Resurrection</HI> of our dear JESUS from the Dead, is an Incontestable Demonstration, That this <HI>His Religion,</HI> must be the <HI>way of Truth,</HI> and the <HI>Truth of God.</HI> There were many Irrefragable proofs, of our Lords being the <HI>Messiah,</HI> whom God had promised for to be the <HI>Redeemer of the World.</HI> Our JESUS <HI>Came,</HI> when the <HI>Messiah</HI> was to Come: Our JESUS <HI>Did</HI> all the <HI>Messiah</HI> was to Do; The Characters of the <HI>Messiah</HI> were fully answered in our JESUS. But His <HI>Resurrection from the Dead,</HI> This most of all effectually proved our JESUS to be the <HI>Messiah</HI>; This <HI>Declared Him to be the Son of God with power.</HI> Now, that our Lord <HI>Jesus,</HI> Rose from the <HI>Dead,</HI> you must needs own; because <HI>He
<PB N="7" REF="000830_0007_0FAB412A6A051098"/>
show'd Himself alive after it, by many Infallible proofs.</HI> After His <HI>Resurrection,</HI> He Exhibited Himself, un∣to those Good men, who <HI>Saw</HI> Him, <HI>Heard</HI> Him, <HI>Felt</HI> Him, and convinced all their <HI>Senses,</HI> that it was <HI>He.</HI> This He did, no less than <HI>Ten</HI> several Times, and unto no less than <HI>Five Hundred</HI> at a Time; &amp; the <HI>Witnesses</HI> thereof, went over the <HI>Earth,</HI> asse<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting it, in such a manner, that the most Judi∣cious Examiners of their Testimony, could not but acknowledge, that they were neither <HI>Deceiver</HI>; nor <HI>Deceived,</HI> in the Thing which they Asserted. Yea, our Lord, since His <HI>Ascension</HI> into the Hea∣vens, and as a <HI>Fruit</HI> and a <HI>Proof</HI> of His Ascension▪ sent His Church a Letter, (which we have in the Book of <HI>The Revelation,</HI>) wherein He foretold a Thousand Things, that we have seen exactly come to pass; but He particularly foretold, The Rising of the <HI>Mahometan Religion</HI>; its being propagated by the <HI>Arabian Arms</HI>; its obscuring the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> with an horrid <HI>Smoke,</HI> and its Torment∣ing the Professors of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> after the Union of the <HI>Four</HI> Turkish Kingdoms in the one <HI>Ottomian Family,</HI> for Three hundred &amp; Nine∣ty seven years together. Besides all this; The <HI>First Publication</HI> of the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> was atten∣ded, which the <HI>Mahometan Religion</HI> has never been, with <HI>Miracles,</HI> that were a <HI>Demonstration</HI> given by the Holy <HI>Spirit</HI> of God unto it. Astonishing <HI>Mi∣racles</HI> were done by our JESUS, before His Reti∣ring from us, into the Heavenly Regions. Those Astonishing <HI>Miracles</HI> are so undeniable, that the
<PB N="8" REF="000830_0008_0FAB412BE5287F38"/>
Writings both of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and of the <HI>Turks,</HI> do at this day confess them; nor were the Pagans, of the First Ages, in the Volumns which they wrote against <HI>Christianity,</HI> still Extant, able to deny them. And the like <HI>Miracles</HI> were continued among the Apostolical Preachers of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> after our Lords Departure from us, for Two hundred years together: They spoke with <HI>Tongues,</HI> which they had never Learnt before; they Help'd the <HI>Blind,</HI> they Heald the <HI>Sick,</HI> they Rais'd the <HI>Dead,</HI> and they Cast out the <HI>Devils</HI> from the Possessed. <HI>No History</HI> can be True, if This be not so. Now these things are <HI>Seals</HI> from God, unto the <HI>Christian Religion.</HI> I beseech you, Do not harbour the least suspicion of a <HI>Religion,</HI> so <HI>Sealed</HI> by the God of Heaven, with Ungainsayable Confirmations. But if any <HI>Mahometan</HI> Tempters do assault you, Let the words of their own <HI>Alcoran</HI> serve to Answer them; The words of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> (or Turkish BIBLE) are: <HI>The Spirit of God hath given Testimo∣ny, to CHRIST, the Son of</HI> Mary; <HI>He is the Messen∣ger of the Spirit, and the Word of God: His Doctrine is perfect.</HI> And <HI>Mahomet,</HI> in this his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> calls the Gospel expresly, <HI>The Right way to Fear God</HI>; &amp; says, <HI>That God sent the Gospel for no other end, but that they might obtain by it, the Love and Grace of God.</HI> Let the <HI>Mahometans</HI> now know, That you cannot forsake your <HI>Christ,</HI> because the <HI>Spirit of God hath given Testimony to Him</HI>; and that you cannot forsake His <HI>Doctrine,</HI> because it is <HI>perfect</HI>; and that you cannot forsake His <HI>Gospel,</HI> because
<PB N="9" REF="000830_0009_0FAB412BF69FF688"/>
'tis the <HI>Right way to Fear God</HI>; as They Themselves▪ have confessed. My dear Friends, The Lord preserve your Souls▪ chast unto Him! and <HI>make you Faithful to the Death,</HI> and <HI>give you a Crown of Life!</HI> May you be able to say, <HI>Lord, Tho' thou hast sore broken us in the place of Dragons, yet have we not forsaken thee, nor dealt falsely in thy Covenant.</HI></P>
<P>But, while you hold fast the <HI>Profession</HI> of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> it is of infinite concern for you, to Experience also the <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> of it. And it may be, the dismal Affliction of your pre∣sent <HI>Captivity,</HI> is come upon you, to Convince you of, and Convert you to those things in <HI>Religion,</HI> whereof you were too insensible, when your heard them dispensed unto you, in the Ordinances of the Gospel, which you sometimes Enjoyed. Yea, t'wil be an happy <HI>Captivity,</HI> that is now come upon you, if the Ears of your Souls be now open to the <HI>Discipline</HI> of <HI>Christianity,</HI> of which it may be, the Lord from Heaven saves unto you, <HI>I spake unto thee in thy Prosperity, and thou wouldest not hear me.</HI> You have been particularly told, of your <HI>Misery</HI> by reason of your <HI>Slavery</HI> to your <HI>Interiour Adversaries</HI>; being, <HI>Sold under Sin,</HI> and being, <HI>Ta∣ken Captive by the Devil at his Will.</HI> But, alas, alas, have you hitherto been deeply sensible of that <HI>Mi∣sery</HI>? You were in the worst sort of <HI>Slavery,</HI> be∣fore ever the <HI>Corsaires</HI> of <HI>Africa</HI> Siezed upon you; Every Sinful Child of <HI>Adam,</HI> is by Nature so. It is an horrible thing, to be continually at work for <HI>Satan,</HI> Tempted and Blinded by him, and held salt
<PB N="10" REF="000830_0010_0FAB412CB5C05C58"/>
in the Chains of <HI>Lust</HI>: And it is of more than a Million Times greater Consequence to be Re∣deemed from this cursed <HI>Slavery,</HI> than from that other, wherein <HI>Turks,</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> do now trample upon you. Your <HI>Slavery</HI> to the <HI>Monsters</HI> of <HI>Africa</HI> will be but short, and you may <HI>Serve God</HI> under it, and <HI>See God</HI> after it: But your <HI>Slavery,</HI> to the <HI>Powers of Darkness,</HI> whereinto you are by your Fall from God, precipitated; This alienates you, from the Knowledge and Favour of <HI>God,</HI> and Eternal Confusions in another World, will be the <HI>Wages</HI> of it. And that which ha's left you, in this Con∣dition of <HI>Slavery,</HI> is, The <HI>Justice</HI> of the Holy God, which hath arrested you, in dreadful <HI>Bonds,</HI> for the <HI>Wrongs</HI> that your Sins have done, in Denying, &amp; in Defying of His Majesty. Methinks, It should fill your Hearts with wonderful Joy, to have the Tidings &amp; Offers, of a <HI>Redemption</HI> from that your Spiritual <HI>Slavery,</HI> This Letter now brings them to you. The Lord JESUS CHRIST is that <HI>Strong Redeemer,</HI> who is, <HI>Able to Save you unto the uttermost,</HI> and who ha's Engaged, <HI>Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI> This gracious Lord, hath paid a Sufficient <HI>Ransome</HI> unto the <HI>Justice</HI> of God, for the Souls of His Chosen; His very <HI>Life,</HI> even the <HI>Life</HI> of that Man, who is <HI>God</HI> as well as <HI>Man,</HI> and therefore One of infinite Value, has been given by Him, as a <HI>Ransome</HI> for them▪ They, to whom the Vertue of this <HI>Ransome,</HI> is actually ap∣plyed, are set at <HI>Liberty,</HI> from the Hellish <HI>Thraldome,</HI> wherein the Enemies of their Souls have <HI>Enslaved</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="000830_0011_0FAB412D6A6AEAD0"/>
them; <HI>The Prey is taken from the Mighty, and the Lawful Captive is delivered.</HI> Come then, my Afflicted Friends; In your <HI>Captivity,</HI> let it be your first Care, to Commit your <HI>Enslaved Souls</HI> into the Hands of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, <HI>With whom there is Plenteous Redemption,</HI> for <HI>He will Redeem His People from all their Iniquities:</HI> And Cry unto God, that through the <HI>Ransome,</HI> which the Lord JESUS CHRIST hath paid for you, even that <HI>Blood,</HI> which is more <HI>Precious</HI> than <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Gold,</HI> and all the <HI>Corruptible things</HI> of this World, you may have your Souls <HI>Redeemed,</HI> from all the <HI>Destruction,</HI> and <HI>Slavery,</HI> that Sin ha's brought upon them. When you have Sincerely thus, Believed on the Lord JESUS CHRIST, then you may Joyfully Sing, <HI>I know that my Redeemer Lives</HI>! Though you Dy in your <HI>African Captivity,</HI> yet you may Dy, Praising of God, for Saving you, from your <HI>Spiritual Captivity.</HI> Yea, 'tis possible, that you may Live to see us again, in this World, and Bless God with us, that ever you were sent into such a sad part of the World, as <HI>Africa</HI>; for if you <HI>Seek First,</HI> the <HI>Redemption</HI> of your Souls, the other will the sooner be <HI>Added unto you.</HI></P>
<P>Especially, if you go on, more particularly to Express that <HI>Repentance,</HI> with which a True <HI>Faith</HI> in the Lord Jesus Christ, will be accompanied. It is one of the Oracles in the Word of our God; <HI>If they Confess their Iniquity, &amp; that they have walked Contrary unto me, and I also have walked Contrary unto them, and have brought them, into the Land of
<PB N="12" REF="000830_0012_0FAB412E2AC52478"/>
their Enemies, if then their Uncircumcised Hearts he Humbled, and they then accept of the Punishment of their Iniquity, then will I remember my Covenant.</HI> My Distressed Friends; Now you are <HI>in the Land of your Enemies,</HI> 'tis Time for you, Humbly to <HI>Con∣fess</HI> unto the Lord, all that <HI>Iniquity,</HI> which He is <HI>Punishing,</HI> in this your <HI>Captivity</HI>: For the Lord, in His Oracles also forwarned His People, <HI>Because thou Servedst not the Lord thy God, with Joyfulness, There∣fore shalt thou Serve thine Enemies, which the Lord shall send against thee, in Hunger, and in Thirst, and in Nakedness, and in the want of all Things.</HI> It may be said, <HI>Who gave you to the</HI> African Pyrats? <HI>It was the Lord, against whom you had Sinned.</HI> Have you forgotten the Story of <HI>Menasseh?</HI> Of <HI>Menasseh</HI> the Story is famous; That his <HI>Enemies took him, and bound him with Fetters, and carryed him to Babylon: and when he was in Affliction, he besought the Lord his God, and humbled himself greatly, and Prayed unto Him, and He was Entreated of him, and heard his Supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem.</HI> Truly, my Brethren; your Enemies have <HI>taken</HI> you, and <HI>bound</HI> you, and <HI>Carried</HI> you to <HI>Africa</HI>: Now, in your <HI>Affliction,</HI> if you will <HI>Beseech the Lord your God,</HI> and <HI>Humble your selves greatly,</HI> who can tell, what He may do for you? It was a Good proposal, made by the poor <HI>Captives</HI> of old, among their <HI>Lamentations; Let us Seach and Try our Wayes, and Turn unto the Lord Solomon</HI> said, <HI>Captives are to Bethink themselves, and Repent!</HI> I advise you, To set before your selves the <HI>Commandments</HI> of
<PB N="13" REF="000830_0013_0FAB412EEF44C0F8"/>
God and what is <HI>Required</HI> and what is <HI>Forbidden,</HI> in every one of the <HI>Commandments</HI>; and very De∣liberately Examine, how far you have in your own Conversation, <HI>Omitted</HI> what is <HI>Required,</HI> and <HI>Committed</HI> what is <HI>Forbidden</HI>; and Loath &amp; Judge your selves before the Lord, for all the Evil that ha's been in all your wayes. It may be your <HI>Conscences,</HI> will now (as it was with <HI>Joseph's</HI> Bre∣thren, when they saw themselves becoming <HI>Prison∣ers</HI>▪) accuse you, with a more special Remorse, for your <HI>Unthankfulness,</HI> and Perhaps <HI>Discontentment,</HI> under the Mercies of God, that formerly Surround∣ed you, and for your <HI>Unfruitfulness</HI> and <HI>Misbehavi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> under the means of Grace that once Enriched you; or, perhaps, for some Singular Acts of <HI>Wick∣edness</HI> against God, or <HI>Injustice</HI> towards your Nigh∣bours. Bewayl it all, before that God, who <HI>Forgives Iniquity, Transgression &amp; Sin</HI>; and fly to the <HI>Blood</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, as a <HI>Fountain set open for Sin and for Uncleanness.</HI> Do not imagine, That it is too late for you, to obtain the <HI>Pardon</HI> of your Sins, now the <HI>Judgment</HI> of God ha's overtaken you for them; for it is not so: You may yet, thro' a CHRIST, come to Sing, <HI>Who is a God like unto thee, that Par∣dons Iniquity? He retains not His Anger for ever, be∣cause He delighteth in Mercy</HI>?</P>
<P>This therefore is the <HI>Fourth,</HI> and a <HI>Great</HI> Thing to be press'd upon you: PRAYER, <HI>Prayer without Ceasing.</HI> Your fierce Masters, lay heavy <HI>Burdens</HI> enough upon you; The Things, which <HI>we</HI> now lay upon you, are <HI>Burdens</HI> indeed unto an Unregene∣rate

Heart, but they are to <HI>Ease</HI> your <HI>Burdens</HI> I am sure, <HI>Prayer</HI> will do it marvellously. Our Bible men∣tions one, who was of a <HI>Sorrowful Spirit</HI>; but it is added; <HI>Having poured out her Soul unto the Lord, she was no more sad.</HI> Oh! Let not the <HI>Angels</HI> of God, who are the Spectators of your <HI>Sorrows,</HI> and of your <HI>Actions</HI> under your <HI>Sorrows,</HI> have cause to make that Complaint of you, that the Prophet made of the People, that had been Slaves to the <HI>Babylonians, All this Evil is come upon them, yet they have not made their Prayer before the Lord their God.</HI> You cannot now make your Moans, to your <HI>Con∣sorts,</HI> to your <HI>Parents,</HI> to your tender hearted Rela∣tions; You wish, <HI>Oh! that I could</HI>! But you may make your moans to God in the Lord JESUS CHRIST, before whom, there comes, <HI>the Sighing of the Prisoner.</HI> Oh! Get alone, as often as you can, to pour out your <HI>Souls,</HI> and Spread all your <HI>Wants,</HI> all your <HI>Griefs,</HI> all your <HI>Fears,</HI> before that God, who is, <HI>The Hearer of Prayer.</HI> And, when you are at <HI>Prayer</HI> unto God, in the Lord Jesus Christ, I know, you will Importunately Cry to Him, for your De∣liverance out of your doleful <HI>Captivity.</HI> We, a great way off, adjoyn our, AMEN, to that <HI>Prayer</HI> of yours. But then, to assist it, I counsel you, to look out, Suitable <HI>Promises</HI> of God, in His Word, for to plead with Him, in your <HI>Prayer,</HI> till your <HI>Faith</HI> be raised, even unto some Assurance. I hope, you will do all that is possible, to preserve your <HI>Bibles,</HI> and prize them, and love them, and <HI>Read</HI> them, as much as ever you can; and find in them those <HI>Delights,</HI> that

<P>Such as fit in darkness, and in the shadow of Death, because they Rebelled against the words of God,—there∣fore He brought down their Heart with Labour,—They cried unto the Lord in their Trouble, and He saved them out of their Distresses.

<Q><BIBL>Deut. 30.2.</BIBL>
<P>When thou shalt Return unto the Lord thy God, -Then the Lord thy God will turn thy Captivity, &amp; have Com∣passion upon thee.—If any be driven out, unto the utmost parts of Heaven, from thence will the Lord thy God ga∣ther thee.</P></Q>
<Q><BIBL>Jer. 29.14.</BIBL>
<P><HI>Ye shall Seek me, and Find me, when ye shall search for me, with all your Heart: And I will Turn away your Captivity, and gather you from all the places whi∣ther I have driven you, saith the Lord.</HI></P></Q>
