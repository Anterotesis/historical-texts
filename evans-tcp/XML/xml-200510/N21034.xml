<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM lxxvii.11.</HI></BIBL>
<L>I WILL REMEMBER THE WORKS OF THE LORD;</L>
<L>SURELY I WILL REMEMBER THY WONDERS OF OLD.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO contemplate the being and the works of GOD, is an employment at once the most noble, the most satisfying and delightful, that can possibly engage▪ the minds of intelligent crea∣tures. Indeed this is the great end of their being. This is the employment of angels, and of all the heavenly hosts. Their distinguished powers, are constantly engaged in "looking into," and admi∣ring "the manifold wisdom," order and beauty, which shine with peculiar glory in the works of their Maker. And after all the discoveries they have made, still new, and increasing wonders arise,
<PB N="6" REF="027629_0004_0FD554FCC114CB60"/>
which add fresh ardor to their desires, and grow∣ing delight and happiness to their minds. And thus it will continue to be, to all eternity.—And the nearer we resemble these heavenly intelligences, the greater pleasure shall we take in viewing and contemplating these objects: until, lost in won∣der, we shall be ready to exclaim,
<Q>Great and marvellous are thy works, LORD GOD ALMIGHTY, just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints!</Q></P>
<P>That which principally engages the pious mind in this delightful employment, is, that in the dis∣covery of the glory of the divine character, display∣ed in his works, he is led to more high and exalted ideas of the blessed God, and is thence excited to praise and adore him, to love and trust in him as the alone SUPREME GOOD—the only soul-satisfying Object, "in whom is all his salvation and all his desire."</P>
<P>It was on this ground, the Psalmist uttered the pious resolution in the text, "I will remember the works of the Lord—surely I will remember thy wonders of old." No object afforded him so much delight—no hours were so agreeably employed, as those spent in meditating upon, and recalling to his mind, the great things GOD had done for the chil∣dren of men; and particularly, the mighty acts of his power and grace, in favour of his ancient chosen people, in times of old.—He refers here, doubtless
<PB N="7" REF="027629_0005_0FD6197938D8CBA0"/>
to the <HI>wonders</HI> which were wrought by the almighty hand, in the emancipation of <HI>Israel</HI> from their cruel bondage in Egypt, and the great salvation they ex∣perienced afterwards.</P>
<P>The passage before us would lead us into a wide and delightful field for serious and useful medita∣tion. But the time allotted me, and the present season, will only permit me to consider some of them, which I shall endeavour, under this general DOCTRINE—</P>
<P>That it is a <HI>duty</HI> incumbent on ALL, and it will be the <HI>delight</HI> of the truly <HI>pious mind,</HI> frequently to <HI>recollect</HI> the WORKS of GOD, and to acknowledge with gratitude his ancient WONDERS to our FATHERS.</P>
<P>Since, by the providence of God, my brethren, this day falls out on the <HI>anniversary</HI> of the landing of our FOREFATHERS in this place, this subject seems well calculated to afford us some agreeable and profitable improvement of that great and astonish∣ing event—an event, which has been followed with such great and important consequences to this land; which has laid the foundation of this NEW WORLD; and all those surprising scenes which have <HI>already</HI> taken place in it—as well as those still greater ones which are <HI>now</HI> in action, and others which <HI>will</HI> succeed them, to the end of time.</P>
<P>We who are <HI>now</HI> on the stage, have seen so much in <HI>our</HI> day, that, it is hoped, we shall never forget
<PB REF="027629_0006_0FD55500A90D56A0"/>
"the works of the Lord;" besides those ancient "wonders" which
<Q>we have heard with our ears, and of which our fathers have told us.</Q></P>
<P>It will be proper for us to consider</P>
<P N="1">I. FIRST, what these <HI>works of the Lord</HI> are, which we should remember.</P>
<P N="2">II. What is implied in the <HI>remembrance</HI> of them.</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>benefits</HI> which result from a due remem∣brance of the works of the Lord.</P>
<P N="1">I. We are first to consider what those <HI>works of the Lord</HI> are, which demand our devout recollection.</P>
<P>The WORKS of God are great and manifold, and none of them are to be forgotten, or excluded from pious observance. For "ALL <HI>his works praise him.</HI>" They are all wonderful, and loudly proclaim the glory of their divine Author.—But when we speak of the <HI>works</HI> of the Lord, they are usually distribu∣ted under these three heads—the work of <HI>creation</HI>— the works of <HI>providence</HI>—and his works of <HI>grace.</HI> All these bear the most evident and glorious signa∣tures of God.</P>
<P>The work of CREATION exhibits such a display of the divine perfections of its Author, as demands the most explicit acknowledgement and praise of all rational intelligences. How astonishing must be the power of that Being, who, by a single <HI>act</HI> of his <HI>will,</HI> could cause this glorious fabrick of the UNI∣VERSE, in a moment, to spring from <HI>nothing</HI> into
<PB N="9" REF="027629_0007_0FD555019EB41B80"/>
existence; and in such beautiful order, grandeur and harmony! How striking and how solemn are those words, God said, "LET there be light, and there WAS light!" "He <HI>spake</HI> and it was <HI>done</HI>— he commanded, and it stood fast." How is the serious, reflecting mind struck with amazement, likewise, at the vast <HI>number,</HI> and almost infinite <HI>va∣riety</HI> of created existences, in every part of the uni∣verse! "The heavens" above us, with all their shining train, "declare" in the most expressive language, "the glory of their Creator." "The firmament sheweth his handy work." Wherever we turn our eyes, divine <HI>power, wisdom</HI> and <HI>goodness</HI> meet them. All creatures, animate and inanimate are full of glowing evidences of Deity. Our own <HI>bodies</HI>—"how fearfully and wonderfully are they made!" Our immortal <HI>souls</HI> bear a still nearer re∣semblance to, and more clearly display the wisdom and glory of their great Original.—Thus, by the work of <HI>creation,</HI> and "by the things that are <HI>made,</HI> are to be seen and understood his ETERNAL POWER and GODHEAD."</P>
<P>The works of PROVIDENCE are no less remarkable, than those of creation. Indeed, so necessary is a DIVINE <HI>power</HI> for the <HI>preservation</HI> of the world in existence and order, that this has been, and not improperly, called a <HI>continued act of creation.</HI> None but the same omnipotent hand, which <HI>made</HI> the
<PB N="10" REF="027629_0008_0FD6193DDB162C70"/>
world, could uphold it, a moment, in being. The constant <HI>preservation</HI> of created existence, is there∣fore, as strong an argument for the being of a GOD, as the first production of them from nothing. It is as much "<HI>in</HI> HIM" and <HI>from</HI> him, that "we <HI>live</HI> and <HI>move,</HI>" as that we "<HI>have our being.</HI>"—But the <HI>providence</HI> of God, is not only concerned in uphold∣ing creation, and continuing all things in being, but in the special <HI>ordering</HI> and <HI>directing</HI> all creatures and things, so as to answer the great and wise ends for which they were made. And this extends to all things in the <HI>moral,</HI> as well as the <HI>natural</HI> world: and comprehends all <HI>events</HI> which take place in both. Accordingly God is said to "work all things according to the counsel of his will." And that he hath not only "the <HI>sparrow,</HI>" and the <HI>hairs</HI> of our heads, and all <HI>material</HI> things, but even "the <HI>hearts</HI> of all in his hand, and turneth them whither∣soever he pleaseth, as the rivers of water are turn∣ed." And that he "worketh in men, both to <HI>will</HI> and to do, of his own good pleasure.</P>
<P>DAVID justly received it as a most joyful consider∣ation (and so do all good men) that every thing was under God's direction and controul. That all creatures and all events were entirely and abso∣lutely at his disposal. "The <HI>Lord reigneth,</HI> let the <HI>earth rejoice.</HI>" The government of the universe is in safe hands, because in the hands of a Being who is
<PB N="11" REF="027629_0009_0FD61947ED80D978"/>
infinitely just and wise—who cannot err, and who will direct all to the best ends possible. "The Judge of all the earth will do right"—however dark many things in providence, may now appear to us. For he is as wise as he is powerful, and as good as he is wise.</P>
<P>In considering <HI>this</HI> part of the subject, the works of <HI>providence,</HI> a very large field opens to our view; in which, it is my purpose principally to walk, at this time; and to endeavor to aid our mutual contempla∣tions, on so pleasing a theme. And I have no doubt, that before we shall have finished our <HI>mental</HI> walk, we shall see what abundant reason we have, to unite with the Psalmist in the text, and say,
<Q>we will remember the works of the Lord; surely we will remember his wonders of old.</Q></P>
<P>If the divine PROVIDENCE extend to the smallest, and most minute events, as we have heard; how much more to those <HI>great</HI> revolutions and those important affairs, which have, and which are contin∣ually, taking place in the world, in all ages: and especially to those which more immediately respect MAN, as the subject of moral government. But we will pursue <HI>this path</HI> a little further.—</P>
<P>In "remembring the works of the Lord," in the government of <HI>providence,</HI> our minds are carried back to the commencement of ages—to the earliest dawn of time. For no sooner had JEHOVAH spoke crea∣tion
<PB N="12" REF="027629_0010_0FD555080765CC80"/>
into existence, but he began to exhibit his own glorious character on its theatre; and to give the most clear evidences of his wisdom, goodness and power, in his conduct towards his new world; and particularly, his noble creature MAN—the brightest image of himself, among all the creatures of this lower world. Here we are led to take a view of the ori∣ginal <HI>covenant,</HI> which God made with the first father of our race—His <HI>holy</HI> and <HI>happy</HI> condition, at his first formation—the delightful <HI>situation</HI> assigned him in the garden of <HI>paradise</HI>—and the more delightful <HI>communion</HI> he enjoyed with his Maker, GOD—in full possession of his <HI>love,</HI> and of all the joys of <HI>innocence</HI>— a <HI>stranger</HI> to <HI>want</HI> and <HI>sorrow,</HI> because a stranger to sin.</P>
<P>But, alas! from this pleasing scene, this state of primitive happiness and moral rectitude, we are led, by the history of <HI>providence,</HI> soon to behold a melan∣choly reverse of things—in that awful catastrophe, presented to us, in the guilty <HI>apostacy</HI> of man from his God, by a transgression of his law.—Thence to the deplorable state of the whole human race, in conse∣quence of his sin—the death and ruin which have overwhelmed the world, "by one man's disobedi∣ence," by which, "many were made sinners."</P>
<P>But in the midst of this scene of darkness, and woe, we are led to behold the first <HI>beam of hope,</HI> which shone upon this ruined world, in the gracious <HI>promise</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="027629_0011_0FD5550922E2C558"/>
of a SAVIOUR, under the character of "<HI>the seed of the woman.</HI>"—In further looking into the records of <HI>providence,</HI> we are carried on to view the sad effects of the apostacy of man, in the dreadful <HI>destruction of the old world,</HI> by a universal flood of water, for their daring wickedness, and their awful defection from God.—After this, to the divine kindness to NOAH, in preserving him and his houshold from the common desolation, by means of an <HI>ark</HI>; precious emblem of that glorious <HI>sanctuary</HI>—that <HI>ark</HI> of safety, JESUS CHRIST—the only "hiding-place" for guilty sinners, from a more terrible flood of divine indignation, coming upon all the finally impenitent.—Thence we are led to see the exemplary vengeance which fell on the devoted cities of <HI>SODOM</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> which were
<Q>turned into ashes, and condemned with an overthrow, for an example to those, who, after, should live ungodly.</Q>
—With pleasing wonder, we then contemplate God's gracious calling of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and his distinguished regard to this Father of the faithful, and to his <HI>seed</HI> after him—The miraculous preservation of <HI>Moses</HI>; and his call and commission to be the messenger of God's mercy to his afflicted people, and the instrument of their deliverance from bondage.—Thence we come to the amazing story of the hardened <HI>monarch of Egypt</HI> who
<Q>knew not the Lord, nor would he</Q>
though at Heaven's order, "let Israel go:" And whose signal obduracy would
<PB N="14" REF="027629_0012_0FD5550CA5D4E7F0"/>
not be overcome by all the <HI>plagues</HI> of Egypt.— From thence to the final <HI>rescue</HI> of the armies of <HI>Israel,</HI> from his oppressive hands—The institution of the <HI>passover,</HI> an instructive rite, to be observed in grateful commemoration of their deliverance— Their distress, soon after at the <HI>Red sea</HI>—Their miracu∣lous <HI>escape</HI> from their enraged enemies—the <HI>song of praise,</HI> they then sung, and their <HI>seeming gratitude</HI> to their God, for this signal salvation—but—their speedy <HI>revolt,</HI> and awful
<Q><HI>murmuring</HI> against the Lord and his servant Moses.</Q>
—The <HI>anger</HI> of God against their ingratitude, and yet his astonishing <HI>patience</HI> towards them, under all their rebellion—Their long wanderings a 40 years journey, in the wilderness— where thousands of their carcases fell, for their unbe∣lief—Their safe arrival at last, and their happy settle∣ment in the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> the Lord "driving out, by little and little, the Heathen nations, and thus fulfil∣ing his promise made 400 years before, to <HI>Abraham</HI> their FOREFATHER.—</P>
<P>THESE, which I have but briefly hinted at, are some of those "<HI>works of the Lord</HI>" which belong to his <HI>providential</HI> government of men—and these are "<HI>the wonders of old,</HI>" which ought to be remembered with devout acknowledgment and praise to God.</P>
<P>But besides these, the Lord, "whose hand is not shortened," hath wrought great and <HI>marvellous works</HI> in PROVIDENCE, towards <HI>other</HI> nations and people; and
<PB N="15" REF="027629_0013_0FD6193F788D10E8"/>
that, in every successive generation, down to the present eventful period. And we may justly view, as none of the least of these, the great and astonishing events, which have taken place in our <HI>own land,</HI> within eighteen years past—and which have been attended with <HI>consequences,</HI> so important not only to <HI>this</HI> country, but to <HI>others,</HI> and most probably, will be in the event, to all the nations of the world. To the revolution in <HI>America,</HI> as a <HI>mean,</HI> in the hand of providence, may probably, be ascribed, the surpri∣sing scenes which are acting on the <HI>European</HI> Conti∣nent at the present day; where
<Q>the nations, like a <HI>potters vessel,</HI> are <HI>dashing to pieces,</HI></Q>
one against another. The present period appears to be big with as important events, as ever the world has witnessed, as it respects the <HI>political</HI> state of mankind; and I believe, ultimately, the <HI>moral</HI> state too.—The grand contest between <HI>freedom</HI> and <HI>tyranny—liberty</HI> and <HI>slavery,</HI> is carried on with amazing ardour—with the most obstinate resolution. And the event must be, soon, either glorious or dreadful.—But it is a sweet and quieting consolation to the friends of religion, that "the <HI>Lord God omnipotent reigns</HI>"—that events are entirely in his hands—That he sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers—that he bringeth the PRINCES to <HI>noth∣ing,</HI> he maketh the JUDGES of the earth as <HI>vanity.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. xl.22.</NOTE>
<PB N="16" REF="027629_0014_0FD619443135AFD0"/>
And it is matter of unspeakable thankfulness and satisfaction that God is the unalterable friend of righteousness, and "abhorreth the oppressor and evil doer." And that, "wherein any deal <HI>proudly,</HI> the Lord is above them."</P>
<P>It was observed just now, that these great revolu∣tions in <HI>providence,</HI> will, most likely, produce great changes in the <HI>moral</HI> as well as political state of the world.—It seems to have been, for a number of years past, my brethren, the evident design of Heaven, by these convulsions and overturnings in the world, to bring on, or at least, to prepare the way for ushering in those glorious and important events, which are so frequently foretold in scripture, respecting the ad∣vancement of the cause of truth and righteousness— the more universal spread of the gospel, and the enlargement of the kingdom of our divine Redeemer on earth—when "the kingdom of this world shall be given to Christ—and all the ends of the earth shall see and rejoice in his salvation.—And when the Lord shall <HI>build up Zion,</HI> he will appear in his GLORY."—</P>
<P>But to return—among other various "works of the Lord" in <HI>providence,</HI> let us, on this occasion▪ more particularly look into the history, of our <HI>own country,</HI> and this day call to "remembrance, those wonders of old" which the Lord wrought for our
<PB N="17" REF="027629_0015_0FD61945257CD8F8"/>
<HI>pious progenitors,</HI> whose <HI>bodies</HI> lie mingled with the <HI>dust,</HI> in THIS PLACE, where we <HI>their children</HI> dwell— but whose <HI>souls,</HI> have long time no doubt been <HI>at rest</HI> with GOD.</P>
<P>As, in the <HI>first discovery</HI> of AMERICA, the hand of God was most visibly seen, and ought forever to be remembered with gratitude—so, it has evidently been the object of the peculiar care of Heaven, through every successive period of time, to the <HI>present day.</HI> It seems to have been, from the beginning, a remarkable <HI>Theatre</HI> of great and astonishing "works of the Lord." Our history, from the <HI>first landing</HI> of our FATHERS in this town, has been a history of wonders; and will furnish, to every generation, per∣haps, as much matter for pious reflection and grati∣tude, as that of any nation or people that ever existed on earth. That of the children of <HI>Israel</HI> seems the nearest to resemble it: as any one may observe, who is acquainted with them both.</P>
<P>I propose here, agreeably to the words of our text, to give a brief narration of some of "the wonderful works of God, towards our <HI>ancestors,</HI> which we, their posterity, ought to remember," and which, it is peculiarly proper, we should call to mind, on this <HI>anniversary.</HI> In doing this, although the accounts chiefly must be derived necessarily from historical facts, the substance of which some of you, perhaps, may have been already acquainted with—yet, I shall
<PB N="18" REF="027629_0016_0FD6188E29E261B0"/>
bring to your view, <HI>some</HI> circumstances—some an∣cient anecdotes, which, I presume, have never yet been made public, at least, which I have never seen. I shall take them from the first book of the very an∣cient <HI>records</HI> of this church, now in my hands. And I hope some useful entertainment, may be afforded at least to the <HI>rising generation</HI> among us; and on the present occasion, it will not be improper to have the minds of <HI>all,</HI> even of those who
<Q>once knew them, to be stirred up by way of <HI>remembrance.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I would begin, by observing to you, that the mov∣ing cause of our <HI>fathers</HI> leaving ENGLAND, their native land, and transplanting themselves, finally, in these then "dark corners of the earth," was, the cruel persecution and religious oppression, they met with in their own land: originating in a spirit of intoler∣ance which then prevailed, especially in the <HI>Episcopal</HI> hierarchy; a spirit, now abhorred, as much by the enlightened and pious members of <HI>that</HI> communion, as perhaps by any others whatever; and which is viewed as a miserable relick of ancient popish su∣perstition and bigotry. Our <HI>fathers</HI> were not indul∣ged the reasonable liberty of worshipping their God agreeably to their own consciences. And though they made no disturbance in the State, but were peaceable members of society, yet because they could not, in conscience, submit to unscriptural im∣positions, nor bow their necks to the yoke of human
<PB N="19" REF="027629_0017_0FD55515EE334D10"/>
inventions, they were loaded with heavy fines and for∣feitures—nay, hunted about like "partridges on the mountains," and persecuted as pests to society. And merely for exercising that Christian liberty, which Christ hath given them, they were seized and many of them imprisoned—others had their houses beset, and watched night and day, and with difficulty escaped their hands; and most of them were obliged to fly and leave their habitations, and all means of subsistence.</P>
<P>Under these burdens they groaned for a consider∣able time, but still continued, as they had done, to meet as often as they could for the worship of God, (though privately for fear of their enemies) under the pastoral care of that famous and learned divine, Mr. <HI>John Robinson,</HI> the FIRST PASTOR of this ANCIENT CHURCH: until at length, their burdens became intolerable; and they, by joint consent, resolve to fly their native country, and seek an asylum in <HI>Holland,</HI> where they had heard, was a gen∣eral toleration given to all denominations of Christ∣ians; and where some of their own countrymen had gone before, under like troubles. The undertaking, they knew, was hazardous, and likely to be attend∣ed with great expence and difficulty. For their enemies watched them continually, and would do every thing in their power to prevent their escape. What a dreadful situation! They can neither be
<PB N="20" REF="027629_0018_0FD6194BD6432860"/>
suffered to live at home, in peace, nor to go abroad for it. The ports and harbours are watched: strict orders given by authority, not to suffer them to escape. They are obliged to use the most private methods possible, and give extravagant fees to the sailors—and yet were often betrayed by them. Twice they attempted to remove, and though with the utmost possible privacy, yet they were discover∣ed before they could get away.—One instance of this, I find, which is very affecting, and which I shall here mention, in the words of the records.</P>
<P>"There was a large companie of them purposed to gett passage att <HI>Boston</HI> in Lincolnshire, for HOL∣LAND; and for that end, had hiered a ship wholly to themselves, and made agreement with the master, to be ready att a certaine day, and take them and theire goods in at a convenient place appointed; where they all, accordingly, attended in reddiness. After longe waiting, and large expences, the master, thô he kept not his word as to the <HI>day,</HI> yett came at last, and tooke them in, in the night—and when hee had got them and theire goods aboard, he betrayed them; having before-hand, complotted with the searchers and other officers soe to doe, whoe took them and putt them into open boates, and there rifled and ransacked them, searching them to theire shirts for money—" offering the most brutal violence
<PB N="21" REF="027629_0019_0FD6194D41E03598"/>
to the women, such as is not fit to be named: "and then carrye'd them backe into the towne, marching them aboute the streets, and making them a spectacle and wonderment to the multitude, who came fflock∣inge on all sides to behold them."</P>
<P>Thus their design is broken up, and they come off with loss, indignity and shame.</P>
<P>The next year, however, they made another at∣tempt, though with little better success than the former. There are some circumstances attending <HI>this</HI> also, which are so very peculiar and affecting, that it may not be amiss to give a particular account of them, which I shall do likewise, nearly in the words of the records.</P>
<P>"These adventurers, not willing to trust their own countrymen the <HI>second</HI> time, after they had met with such base treatment from them, heard of a <HI>Dutch</HI> shipmaster at <HI>Hull,</HI> having a ship of his own, belonging to ZEALAND. They made an agreement with him, and acquainted him with their condi∣tion and design, hoping to find more friendship in him, than in those of their own nation. He bad them not fear, for he would do well enough. He was, by appointment, to take them in between <HI>Grimsley</HI> and <HI>Hull,</HI> where was a large <HI>common,</HI> a good way dis∣tant from any town. Now against the time pre∣fixed, that they might be in less danger of being discovered, they divide their company, and send on
<PB N="22" REF="027629_0020_0FD5551BA43CD718"/>
the <HI>women</HI> and <HI>children,</HI> with the goods, to the place first, in a small <HI>barque,</HI> which they had hired for that purpose. And the <HI>men</HI> were to go by land and meet them there, at the day appointed. But it so fell out, that they were all at the place, a day or two before the ship came. When she arrived, they found the <HI>barque,</HI> with the women, &amp;c. aground, near the shore, it being low water. The shipmas∣ter perceiving this, in order to lose no time, sent his boat to take the <HI>men</HI> aboard, whom he saw walking along the shore. But after the <HI>first</HI> boat∣ful was got aboard, and she was ready to go for more, they lift up their eyes, and behold a large company of horse and footmen coming with full speed upon them. For by some treachery, their enemies had got notice of it, and the whole country thereabout was raised to take them. The men on the shore, had just time, by flight, to escape their pursuers.—But think, reader, of the sorrowful fate of the poor, piteous <HI>mothers</HI> and <HI>children</HI> in the <HI>barque,</HI> who fall a prey into their merciless hands! Canst thou think of this scene of heart-felt distress, with∣out a tear of sympathy for them!</P>
<P>'But what becomes of the few that had just been carry'd aboard the ship? Here is presented another scene, courteous reader, almost too much for the writer to narrate.—The <HI>Dutchman,</HI> seeing they were detected by the English, swore his country's oath
<PB N="23" REF="027629_0021_0FD61951B030BF08"/>
(sacrament!) he would not wait a minute longer. And having a fair wind, he gave orders to weigh anchor, hoist sail, and away for <HI>Holland.</HI>—Our men on board, in vain represent to him, their <HI>own,</HI> and the distress of their <HI>wives</HI> and <HI>children</HI> left behind in the barque. And with their parting eyes, they saw them taken by their enemies, and could give them no relief. Themselves also, were in the most destitute condition, not having a shift of clothes, more than they had on their backs, and some of them scarce a penny to help themselves withal— All they had being put aboard the <HI>barque.</HI> O what would we give, said they, to be on shore again! but all in vain—there is no remedy. They must sadly part, rent from their families and friends, and going to a strange country, where they know neither people nor language.—Yet this is but, in a sense, the beginning of sorrows to this desolate few. A terrible storm comes on, in their passage, which continued for seven days and nights together, in which they saw neither sun, moon nor stars, and were driven to the coast of <HI>Norway.</HI> At length it increased to such violence, that all hopes of life seemed gone—the mariners themselves despairing of ever seeing land. After some time, a doleful shriek is heard—"she founders—she sinks—she sinks!"—But behold, "in the mount the Lord is seen!" when man's hope and help wholly falleth,
<PB N="24" REF="027629_0022_0FD6195367C8B140"/>
then the Lord's power and mercy appeared. And while the poor sailors, with trembling, yield to des∣pair, our pious company on board are <HI>plying the oar of prayer.</HI> And with great faith and fervency, but calm and "without distraction," even while the <HI>water ran into their mouths and ears,</HI> are heard to cry, "<HI>Yet LORD thou canst save!—yet LORD thou canst save!</HI>" When, to the astonishment of the whole crew, the ship rises—the wind lessens, and the storm abates; and the mariners get courage to manage the ship. Their spirits revive, and the Lord fills the afflicted hearts of our brethren, with such comforts, as every one cannot understand, or conceive of. And now, in a short time, they arrive at their desired haven, where the people come flocking about them, being amazed at their deliverance." And while their hearts overflow with gratitude, their mouths repeat the words of David,
<Q>O that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, for his wonderful works to the children of men!</Q></P>
<P>Let us now return to the scattered company that were left on the English shore. The most of them, as we have observed before, made shift to escape and hide themselves from their pursuers—a few only tar∣rying in order to afford, if possible, some little com∣fort to the women and children. But pitiful it was, indeed, to see the condition of these poor creatures. What weeping and crying on every side—some for
<PB N="25" REF="027629_0023_0FD555205C9BC6B8"/>
their husbands, who were carried away in the ship— others melted in tears to see their poor <HI>little ones</HI> hanging about them, crying for fear, and quaking with the cold. Being thus apprehended, they are hurried away from one place to another, and from one justice to another; until, in the end, they know not what to do with them. To imprison so many women and innocent children for no other crime or cause than their being obliged to go with their hus∣bands, seemed to be unreasonable, and they knew, all would cry out against them. And to send them home again, was as difficult; for, as the truth was, they alledged, they <HI>had</HI> no homes to go to; for they had sold, and otherwise disposed of their houses and livings. In short, after they had been thus '<HI>tur∣moiled</HI>' and harrassed a long time, and conveyed from one constable to another, the officers being weary'd out, were glad, in the end, to get rid of them on any terms.</P>
<P>A pious <HI>remark</HI> is made here, in our records, worthy of notice, which I give, as there recorded.— The writer says,</P>
<P><Q>I may not omit the fruite that came heerby; for by these foe publicke troubles, in soe many eminent places, theire cause became famous, and occationed many to looke into the same. And theire godlye carryage and christian behaviour was such as left a deep impression in the mindes of ma∣ny.
<PB N="26" REF="027629_0024_0FD61954E4266CD0"/>
And altho some few shrunke att those first conflicts and sharp beginninges, (as it was noe marvell,) yett many more came on with ffreshe corrage, and greatly anymated others. And in the end, notwithstanding all these stormes of op∣sition, they all gott over to <HI>Hollande</HI> at length, some att one time, and some att another, and mett together againe accordinge to theire hearts desires, with noe small rejoiceing.</Q></P>
<P>They, having thus arrived, minister and people, to a land, though of strangers, yet, of peace and liberty, stayed the first year at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> a large city, full of trade and people. But on account of some unhappy disputes and contentions of a religious nature, that prevailed there at that time, which had well nigh ruined <HI>Mr. Smith</HI>'s church, who had gone over thither from England before them, they pru∣dently resolved, in season, to remove, lest the con∣tagion should spread among <HI>them</HI> also. They accordingly, did remove to <HI>Leyden,</HI> a city about 20 miles south of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> where they were kindly received, and here they settle themselves, and live, in the greatest harmony, as brethren, for about <HI>eleven years</HI>; where they enjoyed much com∣fort, under the ministry of their beloved and faithful pastor, <HI>Mr. Robinson.</HI> It seemed like a kind of heavenly rest to them, after the storms and troubles they had passed through. For here they
<Q>walked in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the
<PB N="27" REF="027629_0025_0FD619566EAE4970"/>
Holy Ghost, and were edified.</Q>
And here many more were added to them. For the flames of relig∣ious tyranny and persecution continued so to increase in <HI>England,</HI> that many more fled over to them, for the sake of enjoying liberty and the rights of conscience. So that they became a very large congregation.</P>
<P>But time and changes render every thing uncer∣tain, even our most precious enjoyments, in this world. And they found, at length, that this place was not to be their "continuing city." There were a number of things concurred as reasons for their removal to some other place or country—the hard∣ness of the land—the difficulty of getting a living from it, and the dearness of provisions—These were very discouraging to them, and caused many of their children to leave them and become soldiers or sailors, to the great grief of their parents. Besides, the im∣morality and loose way of living among that people, especially the prophanation of the sabbath, set∣ting a bad example to their children—was very griev∣ous. But above all, the desired hope they had of spreading the gospel of <HI>CHRIST,</HI> and laying a founda∣tion for the advancement of religion and the king∣dom of <HI>CHRIST</HI> in this remote part of the world.— <HI>These,</HI> were some of the chief reasons which induced our ancestors to determine on a removal from <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly, previous to so great an undertaking, and agreeably to their pious character, they first of all,
<PB N="28" REF="027629_0026_0FD555259A00A978"/>
set apart a day for <HI>prayer,</HI> to seek <HI>direction</HI> from God, in the important affair now under consideration. That scriptural direction being always their maxim,
<Q>In all thy ways acknowledge GOD, and <HI>he</HI> will direct thy paths.</Q>
And after due deliberation, they come to a resolution of removing to <HI>America</HI>; and accord∣ingly set about the necessary preparations for it. They make application to the king, for permission to go under the royal sanction, but are refused. They renew their request, and endeavour to engage some of the great men of the nation, to aid their cause. Sometimes they meet with encouragement, and again are disappointed. Some speak well of them, others misrepresent and villify them; and thus they are tossed between hope and fear—spend a great deal of time, are at vast expence and labour, until, at last, they gained their point so far, as that they are encouraged to make preparations for their voyage.</P>
<P>They hired two ships for the purpose, concluded upon the number who should go over first; for all could not go at this time. And as the major part of the company tarried behind, their <HI>pastor</HI> stay∣ed with them. While the others, with their pious <HI>elder,</HI> Mr. BREWSTER, prepare to embark. And now comes on another most trying scene, viz. their <HI>parting.</HI> This is almost too affecting to think of, when we consider the cordial love and unanimity which bound them together, as with the tenderest
<PB N="29" REF="027629_0027_0FD55528F1A50F88"/>
cord. This, still more strengthened by the mutual sorrows and distresses they had gone through—con∣sidering also what dangers on the sea they were going to encounter—and that, like <HI>Abraham</HI> of old, they were "going they know not whither," into a new world—and especially, as this would probably be, as it was, a <HI>final</HI> parting, with many of them. These considerations served to make this a most affecting occasion to them all.</P>
<P>But before they separate, they conclude to spend one day more together in religious devotion, as a day of <HI>humiliation</HI> and <HI>prayer.</HI> On this occasion, besides pouring out their souls to the Lord in fer∣vent prayer, supplications and tears, Mr. ROBINSON preached to them, from those words in EZRA viii.21.
<Q>Then I proclaimed a FAST there, at the river AHAVA, <HI>that we might afflict ourselves there before GOD,</HI> to seek of him a right way for US, and for our LITTLE ONES, and for all our substance.</Q>
—"And now, the trying time being come, that they must depart, (say the records) they were accompany'd by most of their brethren out of the city, into a town called <HI>Half-Haven,</HI> where the ship lay readye to receive them. So they left that goodlye and pleasant city, which had been theire resting-place, near twelve yeeres. But they knew they were <HI>pilgrimes,</HI> and looked not much on those things, but lifted up theire eyes to Heaven, theire dearest country, and quieted
<PB N="30" REF="027629_0028_0FD619592A2CA180"/>
their spirits. When they came to the place, they found the ship, and all thinges readye. That night was spent with little sleep by most, but with christian discourse and other like real expressions of true christian love. The next day, the wind being faire, they went aboard, their friends accompanying them —but truly doleful was the sight of that sad partinge —to see what <HI>sythes</HI> and <HI>sobbes,</HI> and prayers did sound among them, what teares did gush from every eye, and expressions which soe piersed each others harte, that sundrye of the Dutch strangers that stood on the Kees as spectators, could not refraine from teares. Yett comfortable and sweete it was, to see such livelye and true expressions of deare and unfeigned love.— But the tyde calling them to departe, theire Rev. Pastor falling downe on his knees, and they all with him, with watery cheeks commended them, with most fervent prayers to the Lord, and his blessinge, and then with mutual embraces, and many teares, they took their leaves of one another, which proved to be their last leave, with manye of them. Then hoysinge sayle, with a prosperous wind, they came, in a short time to <HI>Southampton,</HI> where the other ship lay, and the rest of the companye waitinge for them."</P>
<P>They now put to sea—but had not proceeded far, before one of the ships proved so leaky, that they found it was, by no means safe to proceed on the voyage;
<PB N="31" REF="027629_0029_0FD5552C128DB5C8"/>
and finally they are obliged to leave her behind, with a number of their companions who had embarked in her. But they had been inured to disappointments, and bore it with great patience, and concluded that as many as could, should take passage in the other larger ship, and on <HI>Sept.</HI> 6<HI>th,</HI> they sailed the last time from <HI>England</HI> for AMERICA.—It reminds us of <HI>Noah</HI> and his little family, housed in the ark, secure in the arms of divine protection and love, while storms and billows roar around them. The same GOD protected our <HI>fathers,</HI> while they cheerfully commit themselves, under his care, to the boisterous element, in search of an unknown land. He had, in his providence, raised up a number of men of sin∣gular piety and superior wisdom and fortitude, to go before them in this great undertaking; among whom, the names of <HI>Carver—Bradford—Winslow—Prince— Standish—Brewster—Morton,</HI> and others, are never to be forgotten by the inhabitants of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> or by the sons of <HI>New-England.</HI> These were raised up by divine providence to encourage and lead them, in this important enterprize and "on they come, all alone, a small and feeble band, through contrary storms and boisterous seas, which they were never used to; late in the year—a terrible winter approaching, their wives and poor piteous children with them—going to a strange land.—But the Lord is with them, and is their guide.—he divides the seas before them, and leads
<PB N="32" REF="027629_0030_0FD6195EFADC2550"/>
them through in safety."—And thus they are brought, after a tedious passage of more than <HI>nine weeks</HI> to this long-expected shore.</P>
<P>"But Oh! how horrid and dismal, do these new-found regions appear! on the rivers and shores, nothing but sights of wretched, naked and barbarous savages, adorers of devils—the earth covered with hideous thickets, which will require infinite toil to subdue—a cold winter for a third part of the year— no friends to welcome them—no inns to entertain or refresh them, no houses, much less towns to repair unto, to seek for succour.—It is recorded in scrip∣ture, as a great mercy to the apostle Paul and his shipwrecked companions, that
<Q>the <HI>Barbarians</HI> shewed them no small kindness</Q>
in refreshing them. But <HI>these</HI> savage <HI>Barbarians</HI> when they met them, (as after will appear) were readier to fill their sides with arrows, than otherwise to comfort them."</P>
<P>What could be more terrible to human appear∣ance, than their situation and prospects at this time! surely had not "the everlasting arm" supported them, they must have sunk in despair, amidst this gloom, at their first arrival. But 'tis evident the whole design was of God, and he was determined to compleat it—for, "as for GOD, his way is perfect."</P>
<P>They arrived at <HI>Cape-Cod,</HI> Nov. 10th. 1620, where, on their bended knees, they, first of all, give
<PB N="33" REF="027629_0031_0FD619630B5CB100"/>
thanks to their guardian God, for his kind protec∣tion over them through a long and dangerous voyage. In the next place, they wisely formed a sett of laws and regulations, for the well ordering of the compa∣ny, and enter into, and sign a solemn contract before they went ashore; and this was the foundation of their <HI>civil government.</HI>—The whole number belonging to their company, great and small, was 101 souls. One, indeed, had died on their passage, but they had anoth∣er born at sea, so that the same number arrived, that embarked in England.</P>
<P>And now they enter upon a new scene. Though past the dangers of the seas, yet there are other, and greater difficulties to surmount, before they can gain a peaceable settlement. They are wholly unac∣quainted with the country. They find the place where they first landed, by no means suitable for them. They travel with their arms in their hands, from place to place, through wet and cold, in this late season of the year—often, for days and nights, lying exposed, in the wilderness, to the open air and in∣clement sky. And to add to their affliction, the <HI>master</HI> of the ship grows impatient and fretful— threatens that if they do not speedily find a place for settlement, he will turn their families, goods and effects upon the naked shore. The <HI>Indians,</HI> several times, surprize and fall upon them with their bows and arrows, which pierce their <HI>clothes</HI>—but their
<PB N="34" REF="027629_0032_0FD55531340CAD30"/>
God suffered them not to touch their <HI>lives.</HI>—After many days spent in a fruitless search for a convenient place, they at length, conclude, by the advice of one of their company, to come in quest of <HI>this harbour.</HI> And he engages, (having touched here once before, in a voyage of discovery) to be their Pilot. They accordingly man their boat for the enterprize, with some of their principal men, and set out.</P>
<P>The particular circumstances of this affair, having so immediate a connexion with this anniversary oc∣casion, although minute, yet may be deemed worthy of recital—which I shall give in the words of the writer.</P>
<P><Q>They are now in the Bay, in a small shallop. After some hours sailing, it begins to snow and rain. It is now <HI>Friday</HI> afternoon. The wind rises, and blows with great violence. The sea grows rough— they brake their rudder. It is as much as two men can do to steer her with oars. The storm increa∣ses, and night coming on, they carrying what sail they can, to get into the harbour, broke their mast in three pieces—their sails fall overboard, in a very grown sea, and they are like to founder suddenly. Yet, by the mercy of Heaven, they recover, and the flood being with them, they strike into the <HI>sup∣posed</HI> harbour. But the pilot was deceived—and cries out, "Lord be merciful, my eyes never saw
<PB N="35" REF="027629_0033_0FD61963E8250DC8"/>
this place before."—They, with some difficulty, get her about soon as possible, and providence shewing a fair sound before them, though very dark and rainy, they get under the lee of a small island, in our harbour, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Called <HI>Clark's Island,</HI> from the man who first stepped ashore.</NOTE> but are still divided about going ashore, lest they fall into the midst of savages. Some keep the boat—but others, worn out with wet, cold and fatigue, venture ashore, and with great difficulty kindle a fire. After midnight, the wind shifting, and the weather growing very cold, the rest are glad to get to them; and here they stay that night. In the morning they discovered it to be an island, secure from Indians; and it being the last day of the week, here they dry their clothes, rest themselves, and give thanks to God for their many deliverances.</Q></P>
<P>And here, I find, the next day, they kept the Christian sabbath, being about 20 in number. The <HI>first sabbath</HI> ever observed in a religious manner, in this town, and in this part of the world.</P>
<P>The next day, they proceeded to sound out the harbour, find it commodious for their purpose, came ashore at <HI>this place</HI>—found several running brooks and old <HI>cornfields,</HI> but no inhabitants: a dreadful <HI>plague,</HI> as they were afterwards informed, having broke out among the <HI>Indians</HI> in this place, a little
<PB N="36" REF="027629_0034_0FD555349EE02CC0"/>
before, which carried off the inhabitants. Thus divine providence, in a signal manner seemed to go before them, to prepare a place for them.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, they judge this a suitable spot for settlement; and return to the ship at the <HI>Cape,</HI> with the news of their discovery, to the rest of their compan∣ions. Upon which, the ship sails for this harbour; where our worthy and pious ANCESTORS, in this month <HI>December,</HI> and on this day of the month, as our history dates it, <HI>just</HI> 173 <HI>years ago,</HI> here, on <HI>this very spot</HI> which we now inhabit, began their settle∣ment.</P>
<P>It would take up more time than is alloted for the present discourse, to attempt a further enumeration of the many hardships they endured the following winter, and afterwards; by hunger and cold, by open enemies, and false friends, here and abroad; as well as by wasting sickness; by which, <HI>more than half</HI> their number were carry'd off, within a year after their landing.</P>
<P>It may suffice to have comply'd with the particu∣ular design of this discourse; which was, to give a brief account of some of the <HI>principal</HI> occurrences, relating to our <HI>forefathers,</HI> until their <HI>landing</HI> in this place. I will only observe in general, that as the first settlers of this country, evidently, were actuated, not by worldly motives, but by those of religion
<PB N="37" REF="027629_0035_0FD61965EEBB7488"/>
and conscience, by an ardent zeal for the glory of God—the pure worship and unadulterated doctrines of the gospel; and an earnest desire, <HI>themselves</HI> of enjoying, and leaving to their <HI>children</HI> the enjoyment of those rights and liberties which God had given them; so it has remarkably appeared that a peculiar blessing of heaven has followed them and their pos∣terity, in that this land has been the special care of God's kind and gracious providence, from genera∣tion to generation down to our day. And although their descendants have been called to witness some scenes of distress and trouble; and enemies of various descriptions, and in various ways, have risen up against us; and at certain periods, we have seemed to be threatened with destruction; yet the Lord God of our <HI>fathers</HI> hath from time to time appeared in a most wonderful manner, for our deliverance. He hath
<Q>saved us by his right hand, and his holy arm hath gotten us the victory.</Q>
So that we have had occasion to
<Q>stand still and see the salvation of God—</Q>
and may, with the utmost propriety <HI>this day,</HI> set up our "<HI>Ebenezer,</HI>" and say, with thankful∣ness "hitherto the Lord hath helped us."</P>
<P>As it is not to the purpose of the present occasion, so I shall not proceed to mention particularly, at this time, the many "wonderful works" which "our fathers' God" hath wrought for us of <HI>later years</HI>; which ought ever to be remembered with equal grati∣tude
<PB N="38" REF="027629_0036_0FD555385D0784C0"/>
and admiration. And our admiration may well be increased when we contemplate the <HI>moral</HI> state and character of this people—our manifold pro∣voking abominations—our ingratitude—our abuse of peculiar privileges—and our great degeneracy and defection from the pious ways of our <HI>forefathers.</HI>— Yet God hath not dealt with us according to our deserts, but he has saved us; "not for our righteous∣ness sake, but for his own name's sake." So that we are now become a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>independent NATION</HI>; enjoying the <HI>happiest constitution</HI> and the <HI>freest govern∣ment</HI> in the world. A government, the farthest removed from civil and religious imposition and tyranny, of any people under Heaven.</P>
<P>And now brethren, can we reflect upon this se∣ries of remarkable events in the government of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ROVIDENCE, and not say, with the deepest grati∣tude, in the language of the text, "we will remem∣ber the <HI>works of the Lord</HI>; surely we will remember his <HI>wonders of old.</HI>"</P>
<P>We now proceed, as was proposed, briefly to consider</P>
<P N="3">III. Thirdly, his <HI>works of GRACE.</HI> And these 'demand a noble song.' Here we shall see such glorious displays of the divine perfections, as are far more astonishing than, either the work of <HI>crea∣tion,</HI> or those of <HI>providence.</HI> In <HI>this</HI> view of our text, we are led to contemplate those stupendous
<PB N="39" REF="027629_0037_0FD61966E39D6A98"/>
works of love and power, of wisdom and grace, which employ the inquisitive minds of holy angels, who "desire to look into them," and are filled with heavenly admiration when they behold them. <HI>These</HI> are the works which will employ the praises of unnumbered myriads of the "redeemed from among men," to all eternity. Here the whole mys∣tery of redemption by Jesus Christ, opens to our view, and exhibits the united splendor of all the perfections of Deity. In <HI>this work,</HI> we behold "Christ crucified," the only ground of the hope of guilty man. In <HI>this work,</HI> are included, all the <HI>means</HI> of salvation—the blessed WORD of God—the ORDINANCES of the gospel—<HI>sabbaths</HI> and all the pre∣cious <HI>days</HI> and <HI>means of grace</HI> which we enjoy. In a special manner, to <HI>this</HI> belongs the <HI>gift of the HOLY SPIRIT,</HI> which is the SUM of the Redeemer's pur∣chase, and of all spiritual blessings—his gracious operations and <HI>saving influences</HI> upon the hearts of men—awakening the secure, convincing and con∣verting sinners—opening the eyes of the blind— sanctifying and comforting his own people. To the <HI>same work</HI> also, belong, Christ's erecting a <HI>visible Church</HI> and <HI>kingdom</HI> in the world—making continual additions to it—guarding and defending it from its powerfull enemies, so that
<Q>the gates of hell, have not, nor ever will prevail against it.</Q></P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>this</HI> branch of the subject comprehends
<PB N="40" REF="027629_0038_0FD61973B65A7590"/>
all those merciful <HI>restraints</HI> which God lays upon the lusts of men; whereby they are prevented from run∣ning to the greatest excess, and committing the most open daring, constant acts of wickedness—but for which restraint, this world would become a mere hell—as there is no act of impiety and wickedness too bad for the depraved heart of man, to be guilty of.</P>
<P>God's <HI>works of grace,</HI> also include all those re∣markable <HI>reformations</HI> and <HI>revivals of religion,</HI> which take place at any time, through the wonderful pour∣ing out of the HOLY SPIRIT; whereby Satan's king∣dom is weakened, and the interest of our blessed <HI>LORD JESUS</HI> gloriously advanced—the souls of men delivered from the awful bondage of sin, and from that dreadful state of guilt and condemnation, in which all unrenewed sinners are involved—and are brought into the glorious
<Q>liberty of the sons of God.</Q></P>
<P>And I may add, this branch of the subject also includes all those <HI>works of grace</HI> which WILL take place in <HI>future times,</HI> before the end of the world— all those astonishing things which shall come to pass in that remarkable period called the MILLENIUM— a period so much, and so frequently spoken of in the holy scriptures; when the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> will be poured out in such copious effusions, and in so glo∣rious a manner, that this present wicked world will,
<PB N="41" REF="027629_0039_0FD619752BF449F0"/>
in a great measure, re<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mble HEAVEN.—No wars nor contentions—all will be love and peace and brotherly harmony—"<HI>The wolf shall dwell with the lamb,</HI> and the <HI>leopard</HI> shall <HI>lie down with the kid</HI>—the <HI>calf</HI> and the <HI>young lion</HI> and the <HI>fatling</HI> together, and a <HI>little child</HI> shall lead them; and there shall be none to hurt or destroy—" and when holiness to the Lord shall be written upon all our enjoyments. What a glorious day will this be! The Lord hasten it in its time!</P>
<P>Thus I have considered the <HI>first</HI> which was the principal head intended to be insisted on, upon the present occasion.</P>
<P N="2">II. With respect to the <HI>manner</HI> in which we are to "<HI>remember</HI> the works of the Lord," it should be, by a serious attentive observance of them—by a firm belief of God's universal government, and that all these works are the effects of his wisdom, his power and goodness—together with a disposition to give him the glory due to his name, by a hum∣ble, devout, grateful acknowledgement of God in them, and a studious desire and care to live in some measure answerable to such discoveries and mani∣festations of his perfections.</P>
<P N="3">III. As to the <HI>benefits</HI> resulting from a due <HI>re∣membrance</HI> of the works of God, which was the <HI>last</HI> thing proposed—they are very many and great. It will excite us to a humble and joyful <HI>adoration</HI> of
<PB N="42" REF="027629_0040_0FD61977669215A0"/>
him—to <HI>supreme love</HI> to him, as the fountain of all excellence and goodness—a reverential <HI>fear</HI> of him as being a great and holy, a just and powerful God; also, to lively <HI>gratitude,</HI> for such astonishing displays of his love, wisdom and benevolence, for which▪ we shall feel our immense obligations to him—likewise to a humble <HI>resignation</HI> to his government, and a quiet <HI>submission</HI> to his will; as he is a Being on whom we, and all creatures are absolutely depend∣ent, and to whom, it is our highest happiness to be intirely and for ever devoted.—In a word, it will excite in us an ardent <HI>desire</HI> for the ENJOYMENT of him, both <HI>here</HI> and <HI>hereafter,</HI> as the only supreme felicity—the only satisfying portion. And thus, as the result of all, we shall be ready to adopt the language of <HI>DAVID,</HI> as the true expression of our hearts,
<Q>Whom have I in heaven but THEE, and there is nothing on earth, which I desire besides THEE.</Q>
I proceed to the</P>
<P>IMPROVEMENT.</P>
<P N="1">I. In the view of the preceding subject, we may well exclaim, what a MONSTER is an <HI>Atheist!</HI> is it possible, that a rational creature should deny the <HI>being</HI> and the <HI>providence</HI> of GOD; when he has, all around him, such a full blaze of evidence of <HI>both</HI>; from all the works he beholds—from his own existence, and from every creature and thing he is daily conversant with?—
<PB N="43" REF="027629_0041_0FD555421A683160"/>
Surely, such creatures, if any such there are, deserve not the name of <HI>rational</HI>—with utmost propriety are they therefore, in scripture, stiled <HI>fools.</HI> For none, certainly but "the <HI>fool</HI> will say, there is no God."</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It must be an evidence of deep <HI>depravity</HI> in man—of amazing stupidity and hardness of heart, <HI>not to be affected</HI> with gratitude and love, at the consider∣ation of the <HI>wonderful works</HI> of GOD. Especially his works of <HI>grace.</HI> And yet, alas! how common are the instances of this depravity! how many are there, who enjoy the gospel, in which are displayed the brightest evidences of divine wisdom—of infi∣nite love and grace; and yet they treat it as an idle tale—although it reveals to them, the only possible way of salvation for them. Oh! how great must be the guilt—and how aggravated the condemna∣tion of such sinners, finally remaining in this con∣dition! The Barbarians of <HI>Africa</HI> will rise up in judgment against them. For, if the <HI>Heathen,</HI> who have only the volume of <HI>creation</HI> to read, by which to discover the being and will of their Maker; if <HI>these</HI> will
<Q>be found <HI>guilty</HI> before God, for not glo∣rifying him as God,</Q>
where shall the <HI>gospel-sinner</HI> appear; and what must be his guilt and punishment!</P>
<P N="3">3d. We may infer from our subject, the <HI>peculiar</HI> obligations which <HI>we,</HI> the inhabitants of <HI>this</HI> ANCIENT TOWN are under to reflect, with adoring gratitude, upon those "wonders of old," which the Almighty
<PB N="44" REF="027629_0042_0FD6187F27F7BC38"/>
wrought for our <HI>forefathers,</HI> of blessed memory— his tender care and goodness to them, through all their singular dangers, and distresses, both <HI>before— at,</HI> and <HI>after</HI> their landing in <HI>this place.</HI> Perhaps there never was a dispensation of providence to∣wards any body of people under heaven (except the Israelitish nation) so full of wonders as <HI>this,</HI> towards our <HI>ancestors.</HI> They are first persecuted in their own land; by this, they are driven to take refuge in a neighbouring state; but not able to continue there, they are at length, directed and encouraged to seek an asylum in this, then howling, <HI>wilderness.</HI> And all this, to lay a foundation for those sacred and inestimable blessings, civil and religious, which <HI>we</HI> their children this day enjoy. What dangers, yea, what "deaths oft," did they undergo, that they might leave us in the quiet and peaceful en∣joyment of the rights of conscience, and of that liberty wherewith the Lord of nature hath made us free. No hazards could discourage them—no dif∣ficulties were too great to endure—no obstacles or enemies were powerful enough to damp the ardour of their resolution, or cause them to give over the design. They began it with God▪ and heaven, all along, smiled on the great undertaking.</P>
<P>It is worthy of particular remembrance, that this country had been discovered <HI>a hundred and ten years</HI> before their arrival here, and before any effec∣tual
<PB N="45" REF="027629_0043_0FD6197F2D69AFC8"/>
settlements were made in it. Several attempts had, indeed, been formed with this view, but they were by persons who appear to have been actuated merely from worldly motives, and mercenary views; and their designs were all blasted by the hand of providence—They met with a series of crosses of one kind and another, till they gave over the attempt. Until at length, this pious people, forced by cruel oppression, from their own land, are spirited to attempt a settlement in this country. "To this end," says a pious remarker, "how did the Lord bear them as on eagle's wings—He made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed of the Lord to pass over," and brings them with joy, to the place of their desire. And having cast out multitudes of the heathen before their arrival, he gives them favour in the eyes of the rest, so that they dwell in peace, in the midst of many power∣ful nations, who could, otherwise, have swallowed them up for a great many years together. He builds them houses to dwell in, and prepares them fields for planting—he greatly increases their sub∣stance, and multiplies their housholds, so that
<Q>the wilderness soon became a fruitful field, and the desart rejoices and blossoms as the rose.</Q></P>
<P>We are now enjoying the fruit of their labors. And how should our hearts glow with gratitude to heaven, when we reflect upon the amazing difference
<PB N="46" REF="027629_0044_0FD55548DA49E778"/>
between our circumstances and theirs! while <HI>they</HI> were persecuted for righteousness sake, <HI>we</HI> enjoy the worship and ordinances of God without molestation or danger. While <HI>they</HI> were obliged to wander about, in a great measure friendless and destitute— <HI>we</HI> are surrounded with friends and have comfortable habitations. While <HI>they</HI> were often pinched with <HI>hunger</HI> and <HI>want,</HI> WE have even a luxuriant affluence of all the comforts of life. In a word, while <HI>they</HI> were in perpetual fear from savage enemies, and often waked out of sleep, by the noise and terror of them, <HI>we</HI> may rest on our beds in safety, enjoy peace, and quietness, and have none to make us afraid.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. In reflecting on the foregoing subject, we may infer, that no length of time should efface from our memory, or cause us to forget the noble <HI>princi∣ples,</HI> both <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>religious</HI> which actuated our FATHERS in their glorious and arduous undertaking.</P>
<P>As to their <HI>civil</HI> principles, an ardent <HI>love of liberty</HI>— an unshaken attachment to the <HI>rights of men,</HI> with a desire to transmit them to their unborn race—were those which governed them. And they were willing to hazard every thing dear to them, that they might secure these blessings for them and us.</P>
<P>And with regard to their <HI>religious</HI> principles, <HI>these</HI> are well known by all, who have any tolerable ac∣quaintance with their history. It is known, with what sacred zeal, and unwavering perseverance they
<PB N="47" REF="027629_0045_0FD61981CC6B17A8"/>
believed, professed, taught and defended the glorious truths of God's word—the great, fundamental doc∣trines of the gospel. Such as the <HI>apostacy</HI> and total <HI>depravity</HI> of human nature by sin. Man's utter <HI>ina∣bility</HI> to deliver himself from that state of guilt and ruin, in which he is involved by transgression—or to satisfy the divine law—work out righteousness, or make atonement for sin.—The absolute necessity of <HI>regeneration,</HI> by the supernatural agency of the Holy Spirit—the <HI>sovereignty</HI> of divine grace in the conver∣sion of sinners—the <HI>true</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> DEITY of the Lord JESUS CHRIST—the necessity of <HI>faith</HI> in Christ, as the only condition of an interest in him, and in all the benefits of his purchase—the <HI>righteousness</HI> of Christ the only meritorious ground of our justifica∣tion before God—<HI>obedience</HI> and <HI>good works</HI> as abso∣lutely necessary, and the never-failing <HI>fruits</HI> and evi∣dence of a <HI>true faith—holiness</HI> of heart and life, with∣out which no man can see the Lord"—and the final and unfrustrable <HI>perseverance</HI> of true Christians in grace and holiness, to eternal life, through the <HI>promise</HI> and <HI>power</HI> of God, and the all-prevalent <HI>intercession</HI> of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>A person must be a great stranger to the character and history of our <HI>fathers,</HI> who does not know <HI>these</HI> were their avowed sentiments and principles, as to the <HI>doctrines</HI> of religion. <HI>These</HI> were truths, dearer to them than their estates—yea, than life itself. And
<PB N="48" REF="027629_0046_0FD6198365CB7210"/>
they are but the <HI>same</HI> doctrines which have been held and preached by the most famous PROTESTANT DI∣VINES in <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> since the REFORMATION from popery. <HI>Divines</HI> as eminent for learning and piety, perhaps, as ever adorned the Christian world.</P>
<P>And, in this connexion, I may observe farther, without impropriety—That it is not a little remark∣able, that through the singular goodness and watchful care of divine providence towards the <HI>children</HI> of our <HI>forefathers, these same doctrines</HI> have, invariably, from generation to generation, been preached in <HI>this town,</HI> the fear of our ancestors, with becoming boldness, zeal and affection, by <HI>all my predecessors in office,</HI> who now "rest from their labors, and their works follow them."—And if I may take the liberty, I will hum∣bly add—that <HI>these</HI> great and infinitely important truths, I have <HI>endeavoured,</HI> according to my capacity, to preach and declare, with all plainness, to <HI>you</HI>— to your <HI>fathers</HI> and to your <HI>children.</HI> For the truth of this, I hope I have a witness in your own breasts. —And as I am bound to "watch for your souls, as one that must give an account," so I am determined, by the grace of Christ enabling me, still to declare them to you. And, as I hope to live and die in the belief and comfort of them, myself—as I am satisfi∣ed they have been a sweet support to many of <HI>your</HI> and <HI>my</HI> departed friends, in a dying hour, and their
<PB N="49" REF="027629_0047_0FD5554EA2CD0EC0"/>
<HI>only</HI> ground of hope—so I am fully persuaded they are the only foundation, on which <HI>we</HI> can leave the world in peace. I may therefore, under these views, with great propriety, adopt the words of the apostle— "Necessity is laid upon me, and woe unto me; if I preach not this gospel."</P>
<P N="5">5thly. Our subject naturally reminds us of the peculiar obligations we are under to "remember" with highest praise and gratitude the <HI>works of grace,</HI> which God hath wrought—the wonderful work of <HI>re∣demption</HI> by Jesus Christ—the application of it by the Holy Spirit, in the conversion of sinners from age to age; bringing them out of the dark, misera∣ble and wretched kingdom of Satan, into the king∣dom of the Lord Jesus—subduing the enmity of their minds, and bringing them to a cordial reconcil∣iation to God. Thankfully should we "remember, likewise, all those gracious seasons of <HI>revival</HI> of <HI>reli∣gion,</HI> by the out-pouring of the spirit of God, where∣by poor sinners are delivered from the cruel bondage of the Devil, and vindicated into the glorious liberty of the children of God." And while speaking on this subject, I might justly be chargeable with crimi∣nal ingratitude, should I neglect to mention, with deep humility and thankfulness, the wonderful work of God's grace and power which we in <HI>this place</HI> have witnessed the year past. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Appendix.</NOTE> We humbly hope
<PB N="50" REF="027629_0048_0FD6198533AE54D8"/>
and trust, that through the infinite mercy of God, many have experienced that divine, renewing <HI>work of grace</HI> upon their hearts, which they will "remember" with grateful praises to all eternity. May their hope "<HI>purify</HI> them, even as Christ is pure." To conclude, let us ever retain a thankful "remem∣brance of the works of the Lord, and the wonders" he has wrought both for our <HI>fathers</HI> of old, and for <HI>us</HI> their children, in later times—and consider the amazing ingratitude we shall be guilty of, should we, either forget, or not live answerable to our obliga∣tions. Let us set a high value upon those privileges, civil and sacred, which we now enjoy, as we would avoid the guilt of the blackest ingratitude to Heaven— and of casting a sacrilegious contempt upon the memory and blood of our <HI>ancestors.</HI> We are bound by the most sacred ties of duty to GOD—of esteem and gratitude to our <HI>fathers</HI>—and of affection and concern for our <HI>children,</HI> to maintain a religious and inviolable regard for those invaluable blessings, which have been handed down to us, through such a chan∣nel of sufferings, labour and danger.</P>
<P>May the Lord God of our <HI>fathers</HI> still delight to dwell with us, and to do us good as he did to them▪ may the divine Spirit be poured out more and more upon us, for the revival of pure and primitive Christ∣ianity! may his loving kindness never depart from
<PB N="51" REF="027629_0049_0FD5555232776348"/>
us or from our children. And may we strive to be "followers of them who through faith and patience are now inheriting the promises." And O! may we and ours, at last, with them, in a world of perfect love, see and adore, with wonder and delight, the mysteries of providence, and grace▪ which shall then be opened up, to our everlasting joy and satisfaction; and with them, and all the heavenly hosts, may we join in anthems of praise and hallelujahs to the FATHER, to the SON and to the HOLY GHOST, one God over all, blessed for ever-more.—AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the foregoing sermon was prepared for the press, it was suggested, that perhaps, some more particular account of what is hinted at in the Improvement, relative to a <HI>revival of religion</HI> in this place, might be gratifying to <HI>some,</HI> particu∣larly to those who, living at a distance, may have heard something of it, but from imperfect represen∣tations, may not have been able to form just concep∣tions of it—and hoping it will not be offensive to any; especially since it coincides so naturally, with the preceeding text and subject—it is concluded to subjoin the following, by way of appendix; which is taken from a particular account of this matter, which the writer has recorded, in the <HI>records of this church:</HI> which is as follows—</P>
<P>"<HI>Nov.</HI> 9<HI>th.</HI> 1793. After the example of my ven∣erable and pious predecessor, the Rev. <HI>Mr. Leonard,</HI> (on an occasion, in some respects, similar) I think it may be for the glory of God, the honour of the Redeemer, the comfort of his children, and the bene∣fit of posterity, to mention here, and leave upon record, the wonderful displays of God's rich and sovereign grace towards this people, in a remarkable <HI>revival of religion,</HI> through the blessed out-pouring of the Spirit of God, this year—which first began to appear, the latter part of <HI>Dec.</HI> and beginning of <HI>Jan.</HI> last. No uncommon dispensation of provi∣dence—no public calamity, or any thing of that nature, had taken place, which might be assigned as an awakening cause of it. It seemed, apparently, to
<PB N="53" REF="027629_0051_0FD619880B0E98D0"/>
be by the still, small voice of the Spirit of God, the Author of all true religion—by his secret, but power∣ful operation upon the minds of one and another; until, from small beginnings, it became more and more extensive; and at length, a general solemnity and serious concern seemed visibly to prevail through the town. The minds and attention of the greater part of the people appeared to be, in a greater or less degree, arrested on the subject of religion and the great concerns of another world. Besides the stated worship on Lord's days, we had frequent lectures in public and in private, on week days; and religious meetings for conference and social worship in pri∣vate houses, several evenings in the week, in different parts of the town. Among which, it was remarka∣ble, that the <HI>young children,</HI> from seven or eight, to fifteen years old, voluntarily agreed to meet once or twice a-week under the patronage, and by the consent of their parents and guardians; at which times they prayed, sang, read and conversed upon the great things of another world; and behaved with great decency, order and unusual solemnity; commonly to the number of 30 and 40—oftentimes more, even to 70 and 80—several times to upwards of 90—and yet, surprising it was to observe, with what silence, they behaved, in coming to, and going from, as well as at their meetings. Most certainly, for a considerable time—even for several months, there was a visible and happy alteration among the youth and children— and there is reason to hope, some have been made partakers of a saying change.—Besides these, great numbers, of different ages, in the town, have been seriously engaged and deeply impressed with the infi∣nitely important concerns of their souls and of eter∣nity. And we have abundant reason humbly to hope, that a goodly number have really been made the happy subjects of the infinitely rich, free and sove∣reign
<PB N="54" REF="027629_0052_0FD6198AE33AEBC0"/>
grace of God—who have
<Q>witnessed a good confession before men,</Q>
and who hitherto, all have appeared to be of blameless life and to walk agreeably to their profession—O that they may continue, and endure to the end! more than 50 have, within a few months, been added to our communion, and many more, it is expected, will join, who have expressed their desires, and who entertain a hope of their being the subjects of real religion, at this time.</P>
<P>It is also to be remarked, with gratitude and satis∣faction, that during this wonderful season of divine power and goodness here, the work has been remark∣ably free from those irregularities, disorders, enthu∣siastic reveries, and those corrupt mixtures, which, in times past, have been the unhappy occasion of great stumbling to many serious minds, and of bitter opposition from others, and which have brought great and indeliable reproach upon religion.—And although it is not to be expected, while the world stands, and while the church of <HI>Christ</HI> is in its mili∣tant state, but that there will be every where, <HI>some,</HI> who disregard religion wholly,
<Q>caring for none of these things—</Q>
<HI>others</HI> who are enemies to <HI>Christ</HI> and his kingdom, and will be opposed to the truths and cause of God—and <HI>others</HI> again, who profess to be friendly to religion, but have different conceptions of <HI>some things</HI> relating to it, from others; towards whom, we would be very far from feeling an uncharitable disposition—yet, I say, we have reason to speak of it with thankfulness, there hath been <HI>less visible opposition</HI> to this work, than has been usual, at such times: which may probably (under a divine influence, and the restraining grace of God) be, in some measure, the effect of that Spirit of liberty, of toleration and free inquiry, more prevalent at this day, than in for∣mer times.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="027629_0053_0FD6198C983EF478"/>It is very pleasant to behold many, who formerly led vicious, careless and ungodly lives, and who ap∣peared to live without God in the world; nor had any thought or concern about their souls and an another life, now become serious and reformed, delighting themselves in religion, and of a holy, heavenly de∣portment and conversation. And 'tis beautiful to see many who are quite <HI>young,</HI> publickly owning Christ before the world, and engaged in practical religion, devoting themselves to the service of God in the days of their youth—thus crying "<HI>Hosanna</HI> to the Son of David." That passage has been truly veri∣fied amongst us,
<Q>Out of the mouths of babes, and children, the Lord hath ordained praise.</Q></P>
<P>It is likewise a pleasing consideration to observe that fervent, Christian <HI>love</HI> and <HI>unity,</HI> and that sweet communion, which subsists among the professed friends of CHRIST; who frequently meet together, and "speak often one to another," of the great things of CHRIST's kingdom, and his glorious pow∣er and grace, to their mutual edification, comfort and quickening. And we have found unspeakable benefit from such private <HI>conferences</HI>; and have rea∣son to believe, they have been remarkably owned of God, as a means of keeping alive a sense of God, and a savour of religion and eternal things, in our own souls; agreeable to that word
<Q>As iron sharpeneth iron, so doth the countenance of a man his friend.</Q>
We have often been, on these occasions, constrained to believe and say, "Surely God is in this place—" and with the disciples, "It is good for us to be here." And blessed be the name of God, that we <HI>still</HI> have the gracious and evident tokens of the divine pres∣ence among us, and the influences of his Holy Spirit; when it is now more than <HI>ten months,</HI> since the awa∣kening and attention began. And with regard to my∣self
<PB N="56" REF="027629_0054_0FD55560245E93D0"/>
(if I may be allowed to speak so personally) I am sure I have the utmost reason to remark, with lively and humble gratitude, the goodness of God, to an un∣worthy creature, in strengthening, and supporting him (naturally of a very feeble constitution) under arduous labours, in preaching more abundantly—visiting— conversing with persons under spiritual trouble— conference-meetings, &amp;c. for so long a time together. It is to be ascribed alone to the goodness and power of God, whose "strength has been made perfect in weakness." And to him be all, all the praise and glory for ever; and may his name be magnified more and more—and his work be still carried on here and throughout the land! And may these drops of mercy be a happy prelude of a more glorious and plentiful shower of divine grace, and may the world be filled with the glory of the Lord!—This record is here made, as a grateful memorial, to the honour of the blessed <HI>REDEEMER:</HI> and may the generations which shall come after us, see it and praise his name.— Let them "remember the works of the Lord; surely let them remember his wonders of old."</P>
