<P>THis Prophet was the last in the Old Testament, his name signifies Angel, there be some Conjecture he was so and Assumed a Body, others that it was <HI>Erra,</HI> and this name offends his Office, and his faithful discharge of it, when the Priests so generally declined, <HI>chap</HI>: 2.7. He was indeed a Messenger of the Lord.</P>
<P>But he sems to be after that time, and in whom Prophesies with them did cease, a person eminently and extraordinarily raised.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="2" REF="000425_0005_0FA5AEFA80BF3538"/>1.

<P N="1">1. We have the Prophesie of Christs first coming in the flesh, verse 1. to 7.</P>

<P N="2">2 The Exhortation to Repentance, <HI>v</HI> 10 to 13 with directions to the duty, is to be done, and Motives to the doing it, which we shall open and improve in the Use.</P>
<P>The Ceneral Doctrine hence is,</P>
<P>Doctrine, <HI>True and General Repentance is the only remedy of pub∣lick Judgments upon a Professing people, or the only way to Remove them.</HI></P>
<P>Q 1. <HI>What is this true Repentance</HI>?</P>
<P>Q 2 <HI>When it is, and why it must be general</HI>?</P>
<P>Q 3 <HI>How this appears to be the only and sure Remedy of publick Judgments.</HI></P>
<P>Q 1 <HI>What is this true Repentance</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>Answer,</HI> It consists in these three things.</P>
<P N="1">1 It lies in a through Conviction of sin, especially that Evil whereby the Lord is most provoked.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="4" REF="000425_0007_0FA5AEFC9A93C5A0"/>1 Sin is the cause of all publick Judgments, <HI>Isa</HI> 59.1, 2. It is true in personal afflictions, the Lord sometimes useth Soveraignty, and may do it for trial and many other holy ends, as in <HI>Job, Ha∣mon, &amp;c.</HI> but when upon a people it is always for sin. The Rea∣son is, because outward mercies and Judgments are the proper re∣wards and punishments of a people as visible▪</P>
<P N="2">2 It is some special sin of a people the Lord is most provoked with when he sends his Judgments upon a people, the Lord is a God of Judgment, <HI>by him Actions are weighed,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2 3. And there are some sins cast the scale for some particular judgments, see <HI>Amos</HI> 1·3.6. <HI>chap.</HI> 2 4, 6.</P>
<P N="2">2 This sin must be known, as there can be no Repentance <HI>with out</HI> Conviction, so where it is only of generals, that is not true: there is some special sin end of a person that is leading &amp; ruling so among a people, this must be known in order to the Confession and Reformation of it as evident by the enquiry, <HI>v</HI> 8. and the Prophets reply to it, and by the charge the Lord gives about it, <HI>Josh.</HI> 7.11·12</P>
<P>Two things necessary to be known here.</P>
<P N="1">1 The evil in the nature of it, <HI>v</HI> 8. Offence against God, and that of an heinous nature; it is a robbing of him, taking away by force.</P>
<P N="2">2 In the effects, the mischief it brings, its that curseth all your blessings, and that upon a whole Nation, by Gods violent taking away that which they had, fair hopes and expectation to have enjoyed, which they are to look upon as the fruits of the Curse for this sin: It is Gods seizing that which your sin had forfeited into his hand.</P>
<P N="2">2 Another part of true Repentance is deep humiliation, as for all, so especially for this sin, which though it is not so plainly ex∣prest, yet it is fully implied in the <HI>Text</HI>; for there will be no tho∣rough Reformation when there is not a heart separated from it, Which is in this way.</P>
<P>This lies in these three things.</P>
<P N="1">1 An humble and penitent Confession of it, <HI>Psalm</HI> 51.4· In self-condemning, and justifying God in all his Proceedings with you,
<PB N="5" REF="000425_0008_0FA5AEFD550AD740"/>
upon the provocation given, so great a part this is that it is som∣time put for the whole, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3: 13. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.9: It being the most difficult where it is sincere, and will certainly be attended with the rest.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Inward shame and confusion,</HI> Ezra 9 4 Jer. 3.22. Rom. 6.21 <HI>it speaks the sinner duly affected with the offence to God, and mischief to himself.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>Dislike and hatred of it, your self aborrence,</HI> Job 42 6, 7 Isai. 64 6 <HI>this is called the knowing the plague of the heart.</HI> 1 Kings 8.38, 39.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>Knows it to be a plague, his sickness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Deadly one is at the heart, without he have Divine Relief.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>At his heart; this is one case you must needs confess and open un∣to the Phisitian of Souls, and feel it, and cannot but bewayl and abhor it. It is also an accepting the punishment of his iniquity,</HI> Lev. 26.41.</P>
<P N="3">3 Reformation, <HI>Prov</HI> 28.13. doing contrary, <HI>Mal.</HI> 3 <HI>verse</HI> 10▪ <HI>Isai.</HI> 1 21</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> 2 Why this must be general?</P>
<P>Answ. 1 <HI>The Judgment is general, verse</HI> 9 <HI>this whole Nation therefore Repentance must: for when judgment is general, sin is pub∣lick; Judgment declareth the provocation to be so▪ not that every particular person is guilty, there be many Holy Ones there among peo∣ple that yet may suffer with them that are not personally guilty, yet in∣volved in the affliction and common calamity: so if the Re<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enting and Reforming part be the Ruling Part, a lesser number will not hinder the blessing, nor will some few, though eminent prevail to remove such publick afflictions; many times where it is not generally seen and be∣wailed though they may obtain some peculiar favours to themselves,</HI> yet not for the whole, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 14 13, 14 <HI>Jon</HI> 3 8</P>
<P>Q 3 Why this is the sure and only Remedy.</P>
<P>Answ <HI>That it is so is so fully attested in Scripture, and made good by Providence, and a subject you are so well acquainted with that I shall not insist upon it.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1 But that it is a sure way will appear,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="000425_0009_0FA5AEFE4B0B83C0"/>1 In that God hath prescribed it as the remedy; and promised that it shall be so, <HI>Mal.</HI> 3.7.</P>
<P N="2">2 When the very Judgments have been threatned in severest manner, it is with this exception, <HI>Jer.</HI> 18.7, 8 <HI>Jon.</HI> 3.10.</P>
<P N="3">3 Yea when he hath begun to execute, it hath been effectual to remove them, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 12.4, 5, 6, 7 <HI>Amos▪</HI> 7.1, 2, 3.</P>
<P N="2">2 And the only.</P>
<P>Reason 1.</P>
<P><HI>Because this is the only Remover of the cause of the controversie; such Judgments are effects of Gods displeasure, which is not against his creature but the Sinner,</HI> Lam. 3.33. <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.25. <HI>Creatures come to execute the curse upon a People of Gods Wrath, but where true Re∣pentance, they are not the Subjects it unvalidates their Commission▪ dis∣arms them, his condition is changed where such a changed disposition is, Jer</HI> 50 20.</P>
<P N="2">2 It is a duty highly pleasing to God, its new Covenant Obedience, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.19, 20. <HI>Lev.</HI> 26.41.</P>
<P>Improvement of this Truth is my main design, and I shall fol∣low the method of the Prophet in it, my whole Text being an Exhortation to Repentance of this evil especially, urged by cogent Arguments, and furthered by suitable Advice and Counsel; which also gives us sufficient ground of Conviction and Humiliation.</P>
<P>The Uses then shall be,

<HEAD>USE 1.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Of Conviction and Humiliation which is the main work of such a day as this, and that such Providences call for, and must proceed, for there will never be through Roformation without deep Humiliation▪ This is that we acknowledg, and do openly profess before God to intend in Fasting Days, otherwise they will not be Days of Atonement but of provocation,</HI> Lev. 23.27, 29. <HI>our business with God, under testimo∣nies of his displeasure, is Atonement, our peace with God through the blood of Jesus Christ, the way to which is sence of sin, and the need of pardon.</HI></P>
<P>Two things are requisite in order to this:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Enquiry into the cause of the Judgment, or to find out sin, that sin that God is most displeased with.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 A search into our own hearts, whether we are the persons under the guilt of it, <HI>Lam</HI> 3.40.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1 The first of these is that <HI>I</HI> shall endeavour to further you in, this being a great part of Ministerial work in such a day, <HI>Isa</HI> 58 1 To tell the people of their sins; as it is every christians to en∣quire of the Lord to show him his sin, <HI>Job</HI> 10.2 <HI>Job</HI> 34 32 sear∣ching out of sin is the great duty in days of affliction, and in that search, its the christians duty.</P>
<P N="1">1 To acknowledg their own ignorance and darkness about sin, and especially those God is chastening for, the best may be igno∣rant, and the humble Soul sees it.</P>
<P N="2">2 To desire Gods teaching:</P>
<P N="1">1 By his Word, that is the ordinary and visible way of Gods teaching in an Ordinance, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 21.1.</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> did by the <HI>Ephod</HI> enquire for this teaching, <HI>Psal.</HI> 22.4 en∣quire in the Temple, <HI>Mal.</HI> 2.7. he is the Messenger of the Lord, enquire at his mouth.</P>
<P N="2">2 By his Providence, that also is a way of Gods teaching.</P>
<P N="3">3 But especially by his Spirit, <HI>Isa</HI> 14 26 2 <HI>Cor</HI> 3 6 <HI>in the word</HI> to give full and an humbling sight of it, that the Spirit only can
<PB N="8" REF="000425_0011_0FA5AEFFA1298850"/>
do, and when he doth it, its ordinarily by the Ministry of the Word, he brings it home, and carries it to the heart, and sets the soul upon its own searching, and bringing it self to the searching of the Word.</P>
<P>To help on this work, we have a plain discovery in my Text.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>What is that Sin which provokes the Lord, to inflict such Judg∣ments as we are now under, why he sends Devourers to lay your fields waste? It is because the House of God lies waste, it is the neglect of upholding and maintaining Gods Holy Institutions, and the Ordinances of his House,</HI> verse 7 Hag 1 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 <HI>Set your <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to your ways, be humbled for that sin that is the cause of your scarcity, and curse in your enjoyments, viz the House of God lies waste.</HI></P>
<P>Two evils the Lord is very angry with his people for, with re∣spect to his right in mens Estates▪</P>
<P N="1">1 Their laying it out upon False-worship, <HI>Hos</HI> 2 8</P>
<P N="2">2 Denying it, or witholding that which is his due to his own Worship that is charged here.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> But what is Gods due, is there any such thing in New-Testa∣ment Times.</P>
<P>Answ <HI>To avoid all Controversie, I shall not meddle with the measure and way: but clear b<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the New-Testament, that there is a due, &amp; that which God requires by the rule of Justice to be given</HI></P>
<P>1 <HI>Cor</HI> 9 13.14 The Morality of that appointment is perpetual, that those that serve in the House should be maintained in that ser∣vice, as by attending the Altar, so in Preaching the Gospel; now they should live of it, have their outward sustentation by those to whom they Minister, <HI>Mat</HI> 10 30 there the Lord hath said it, and put it under a rule of Justice as due to that Service, <HI>Gal</HI> 6 6, 7 it is to be from all good things, those that here do partake in them selves, and from all that have any thing of their own, 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 16 2 <HI>In proportion to any mans increase,</HI> 1 tim 5 17 must be that is ho∣nourable and becoming such a Service, and may testifie that you do esteem of it.</P>
<P N="1">1 God hath a right in every mans Estate, which is given to Je∣sus
<PB N="9" REF="000425_0012_0FA5AF00892BE298"/>
Christ, and by him to his Officers, <HI>Psal</HI> 16 3 He did reserve such an acknowledgment of his Soveraignty in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, one of the trees were his propriety, and forbiden to be medled with upon the highest penalty.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>The further discovery my Text gives for your Conviction and Hu∣miliation, is that it is a very heinous sin.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>Its a robbing of God, a sin of the highest injustice, a Theft, yea a Violence &amp; Fraud against the first Table, where God is more immediate∣ly injured; which is called Sacriledg, Prov</HI> 20 25 <HI>its a snare a sin that entangles him, and holds him under the guilt of it, Prov</HI> 5 22</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Its</HI> against the light of nature, will a man that acts like <HI>a man</HI> in free use of his reason do thus? sins against the light of nature, are very great, especially in them advantaged with Gospel light, that which Heathens acting by the sight of nature will not do, so the Lord exagerates the sin of <HI>Israel, Jer</HI> 2 10, 11 is then such a thing; will the Nations change their God, which are now, yet <HI>Israel</HI> hath changed their glory when they forsake his true Worship, so it is in the undervaluing of it▪</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>Nature dictates there is a God, Rom</HI> 1 20</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>This God is to be worshipped, Acts</HI> 17 23 <HI>whom they worship ignorantly, they did worship, though ignorant what God was</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 That this worship be maintained and that honourably, and therefore though Heathens were mistaken about the object of worship and means, yet what they did think to be; so they by the light of nature were stirred up to a liberal support of it, <HI>Isa</HI> 46 10 lavish gold out of the bag; and what a tumult was there in <HI>Ephesus, Acts</HI> 19 24 when they feared their worship should be set at nought.</P>
<P><HI>So it is with Superstitious Persons that are wrong in the means of Worship, though right in the object, Exod</HI> 32 3 <HI>part with their Jewels to the worship of Jehovah by a Calf,</HI> Judg 17 3 <HI>This sin then is worse then the Heathens that have not extinguished the exercise of natural light to despise Gods own Institutions that have them, and then those that are superstitious in this thing,</HI> Heb 12 15 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>is cal∣led
<PB N="10" REF="000425_0013_0FA5AF02F07C1FE8"/>
a Prophane Person, that despised his birth-right, that is such an one that sober Heathen did Excommunicate from their Communion in their Worship.</HI> Procul hinc estote prophani.</P>
<P N="3">3 The greatness of this sin appears in this, that its from an e∣vil root, an heart of unbelief, <HI>Heb</HI> 3 12 where there is a forsa∣king God, and undervaluing him, and overvaluing the Creature, <HI>Jer</HI> 2 12, 13 God and Christ are despised, in contempt cast up∣on his Ordinances.</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>It is the cause of great and sore Judgments, this is or should be a sencible evidence; its that brings the Curse of God upon all your bles∣sings? as here you are cursed with a Curse, that blasts your fairest hopes of increase, the Lord sends his Devourets to take it away in the sea∣son of it: That God who hath blessed your Fathers, and taken your Children into a blessing Covenant; this sin marrs all, and provokes him to curse your blessings,</HI> Jer 5 24 <HI>It is your sin witholds good things from you,</HI> Deut 29 24, 25 <HI>and make you a reproach and misera∣ble to a Proverb.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5 It opens the door to all other evils, even spiritual judgments which are the sorest, 2 <HI>Thes</HI> 2 12 because they love not the truth, so if you love not Gods Holy and Pure Institutions, you may be given up to receive mens inventions &amp; temporal evils, <HI>Neh</HI> 13.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. where there was neglect of bringing the Tithes into Gods House, those empty chambers were fit to be prepared for <HI>Tabiah</HI> and his Goods, Be convinced its a grievous sin and just∣ly provoking to God, yea to such an heat of his anger; and la∣bour to quench it with faith in the blood of Christ, the fruit where of may appear in the tears of true Repentance.</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>That which may further lay this sin before you is, that the profes∣sing People of God under the highest and purest Profession of Religion, are most Prone to it, and this evil they are more fearfully under the guilt of, and it is charged u<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on Israel, when under greatest Reformation, as here after their coming out of Babilon, and when the Altar of God was set upon its Basis, and they had been Purged from their Whoredoms, and Idolatry in false means of Worship, that they did ab∣hor
<PB N="11" REF="000425_0014_0FA5AF03D6A27EA0" MS="y"/>
it, that which was not found among them when Idolaters, the abuse of Gods Portion was not by their using it themselves, or withholding it from the Lord, but bestowing it on false Worship.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Luther</HI> when he read these Scriptures, urging the care of the Ministry, thought there had been no need of it, he found people rather to exceed when he was a Monk in maintaining Shrines to <HI>Diana,</HI> but when he was a Preacher of the Gospel, he professed he saw need of all that was said, and that contempt of the Gos∣pel brought these sore judgments after his time, which he did fore¦tel would befal them upon that account.</P>
<P>Reason: <HI>And the Reason is, because true Worship is Spiritual and supernatural, and cross to corrupt nature, whereas mens inventions are suited to it; hence where men are not truly converted and spiritual, they see no beauty in them at all, where they do keep up outward visible Ordinances, they will do no more than that they may keep up the credit of such a Profession.</HI></P>
<P>And where they are spiritual, its but in part, and unless it be in Eminency, it will grow remiss here, where any declining in the power of Religion, there is no love and esteem of Ordinances, as may be seen and found by sad experience i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>New-England</HI> Chil∣dren; who do not rise up in the same spirit with their Godly and Eminent Predecessors, the first Planters in this Country, who like <HI>Jeremiah</HI> in the Wilderness, when newly freed from <HI>Egyptian</HI>-bon∣dage, and had set up the Worship of God, and when so <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ee to the Ta∣bernacle, that they needed a Proclamation to restrain them, <HI>Exod</HI>: 36.5. But as Love to God hath declined, so hath this to his House.</P>
<P><HI>The Errand into this Wilderness was for Purity of Worship, the Lord was highly pleased with it, it was a Love of Espousals: but be∣hold what degeneracy, many can be content to live without them, those under them at great indifferency about them. Let this be an awaken∣ing word, bring your hearts to the Bar of it, for Conviction and Hu∣miliation. The Lord may be at peace with you, and so Good may come to you.</HI></P>

<HEAD>USE II. Of Exhortation.</HEAD>
<P><HI>To stir you up to a Reformation herein,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="000425_0015_0FA5AF0412B31048"/>Two things wherein this will lie: As,</P>
<P N="1">1. In giving your selves up to God, and so to his people, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.5. when he had commended their liberality, he tells you the be∣ginning of it, it was in giving themselves to God, and to his peo∣ple according to his Will; all our offerings to God will not avail without this.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Then bring your offering, that which is yours,</HI> Mal. 3.10. <HI>bring your Tithes, that there may be meat in my house</HI>: And let this be done,</P>
<P N="1">1 Chearfully, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.7. the Lord loves a chearful giver, espe∣cially in this case, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.16, 17, 18. that is of Gods giving, and is a singular mercy where it is.</P>
<P N="2">2 Faithfully; do not withdraw any of what is Gods due, let there be meat in my house, let it be as the case needs. I might urge and move to this duty by considering,</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>That it is the only wa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now to preserve Pure Worship and Ordi∣nances. God is trying this Love, it is far more like that your want of Love to the House of God will endanger your loss more than the hatred of the Enemy.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>It is a way in which you most honour God with your Estate, which is your Duty,</HI> Prov. 6.3.9.</P>
<P N="3">3 It will manifest your real benefit by Ordinances, and they are blest to you, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.3. <HI>Job</HI> 23.11, 12. that any love they will be at cost to enjoy.</P>
<P N="4">4 Let not Heathens and Superstitious Persons out do you in their false way; will you not show as much esteem to that God hath Instituted? as men will to what they have invented? if true Christians you will.</P>
<P N="5">5 <HI>It will turn to your spiritual advantage,</HI> Rom. 15 17. Gal. 6.7. <HI>It is Spir<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>l Trading, and your exchange and turning will be of Earth¦ly Commodities into Spiritual, brass into gold.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7 Nay it shall be your advantage to outward prosperity, and that is the Argument in the Text which <HI>I</HI> shall a little enforce.</P>
<P>The Lord calls you to prove and try him, whether he will not be as good as his word, and promise, you are willing to try other
<PB N="13" REF="000425_0016_0FA5AF05061F46A8"/>
means if from skilful and faithful men; try and prove the Lord.</P>
<P>There are three ways m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> do try and prove the Lord, but one good one that is here inte<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>By sinful ways, whethe<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will be as good as his threatning: so Flagitious Sinners <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him every day,</HI> Deut. 29.19.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>By disapproving and despising the means God appoints for our Good,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 10 2 see Num 21 6 Isai 7 12</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>There is a Proving of him by Obedience to his Command, and in that way expecting the good of his Promises, and this is a way God would be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roved, and in which way he hath abundantly approved himself</HI> Josh 23 14 <HI>Yea <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> confidentl<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Joshua <HI>asserts</HI> that <HI>God had never failed in any thing he hath promised,</HI> Jer 2 5 <HI>the Lord challengeth that Nation to charge him if the<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could of any failure on his part.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1 To further your willingness to trust him and believe, you have not only his faithfulness engaged, but the Lord obligeth his power, and shews how able he is to make good his word, what e∣ver he promiseth, for he is the Lord of Hosts.</P>
<P>All Creatures are at his Command and are blessings or curses, as they are Commissioned by him, and are absolutely under his Rule and Government; therefore you have no reason to question the fulfilling what he promiseth.</P>
<P N="2">2 That he is as willing as able, he satisfies in this, by his free engagement of himself to Obedience in this thing.</P>
<P><HI>Mal</HI>: 2.8.9 <HI>Let us then prove the Lord in way of Obedience to this Command, especially when he hath freely engaged himself by such Encouraging Promises.</HI></P>
<P>As 1 <HI>That he will open the Windows of Heaven, this is the first Promise: that is, he will give abundance, or plenty of the fruits of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Gods ordinary way of blessing his people, is by ordering and governing second causes, which he hath ranked in their order, and
<PB N="14" REF="000425_0017_0FA5AF059E46E678"/>
set in subordination each to other, of which he hath the sole com∣mand, they are all his Host, and among these the Heavens have the chief place, <HI>Hos.</HI> 2 18, 19, 20 when there the Lord promiseth plenty of outward blessings, he doth it in this way, the Earth shall hear the Corn, the Heavens the Earth, and the Lord his people; so that the opening Heaven, implies the fruitfulness of the Earth, when that gives full and seasonable showers and benign influences; the Earth will yield its increase as subordinate to them: Its an He∣brew Phrase and Figure for giving plenty of Showers, and here in mercy not in Judgment, as <HI>Gen</HI> 7.11 but in fulness of mercy to his Land and People, and withholding, is called a shutting heaven, the cause of Famine, and giving Rain the opening of it, <HI>Rev.</HI> 11 6 &amp; this the cause of Plenty, and the Lord himself he explains it, and Pours out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to <HI>receive</HI> it, the like we have, <HI>Hag</HI> 1.17, 18. and upon the same account, yea and hath given proof of his faithfulness herein, 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 31 5, 9, 7, 10 As soon as <HI>Hezekiah</HI> that Eminent Reforming Prince did provide for the maintainance of the Levites, and they brought their Tithes to Gods House, the Lord blessed his People. <HI>It</HI> was the first Fruits did sanctifie the Lump; the Excuse and Plea of people, is that they are Poor, and their Land doth not yield its increase.</P>
<P><HI>But whence is it, but for withholding Gods due,</HI> Hos 1▪ 8 <HI>put into a Bag with Holes: the Turks have a Proverb in their justice to man, that if an Asper deta<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned, or taken from another be in their bag, it will make an hole in it, this is true in iniustice to God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But if you pay your Quit Rent to your</HI> great <HI>Landlord,</HI> you will find him a beneficient one, <HI>Prov·</HI> 3.9. honour the Lord with your sub¦stance, and your barns shall be full, paying his reserved due, is that honour by which you acknowledg him the great Proprietor and your dependance on his favour.</P>
<P>The other Arguments you look over with your harvest minds, here methinks you should be fixt, that this is the only way to thrive in outward blessings, <HI>Joel</HI> 2 24, 25.26. if there be Re∣pentance

and Reformation of this Evil, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.32, 33. seek first that is, to have chief respect to Christs Kingdom, and these things shall be added.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> But temporal promises were indeed such as God did fulfil and deal with the Nation of the Jews in, but under the Gospel he fulfills even those more spiritually.</P>
<P>Answ <HI>It is true, to believers personally, it is so, and outward mercies are promised more conditionally, so far as Gods Glory and their best</HI> good may <HI>be promoted.</HI></P>
<P>But to a Communitie and a Body of his People, and as such, so he doth fulfil outward Promises literally in the way of their visi∣ble obedience, as most suited to them in their Community.</P>
<P>The second Promise is, the Rebuking the Devourers, that they shall not destroy the fruits of the earth, when second causes have concurred to make the earth fruitful, and there may be the fairest appearance of great increase, the Lord can take it away in the sea∣son, send his Messengers and Army to gather in your Harvest, Hos. 2.9 and that is a sorer Judgment; this the Lord threatned this year: And it is credibly Reported, that a Person in one of these Colonies was blessing himself in that appearance of a great Harvest, and said, now shall I pay my Debts and get afore-hand, for I shall have a full Crop, and am free from paying any thing to the Minister; the Lord sent these Devourers upon his field<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and destroyed his vain hopes.</P>
<P>But if God hath his due, he promiseth that as a gracious Re∣ward of their Obedience, these shall be Rebuked, they shall not destroy their fruits, <HI>Isai.</HI> 65.23, 24, 25. shall not plant for o∣thers but themselves, they shall enjoy the fruits of their own la∣bour, <HI>Jer·</HI> 2.3 When <HI>Israel was holiness unto the Lord</HI> he suffered
<PB N="16" REF="000425_0019_0FA5AF0889BB3600"/>
none to injure them, and when your Estates are so, they and you shall be under Gods Protection, <HI>Isa.</HI> 54.13.</P>
<P N="3">3 As the issue of all, you shall be blessed to a Proverb; yea, your Land shall be desirable, God will delight in it, and dwell a∣mong you in and with his Holy Ordinances, and have Communion with you in them, where you esteem and delight in them, and o∣thers shall delight in it, and desire to dwell there as seeing God a∣mong you, <HI>Zech.</HI> 8 <HI>ult</HI> Take hold of the skirts of a people under <HI>Gods</HI> apparent &amp; visible blessing, this is the way to true Felicity on earth; if you do it in true Love to God and his House, <HI>Psal.</HI> 144.14, 15. as abounding in all outward blessings, so in spiritual and eter∣nal. Oh then try the Lord and prove him by this, and see if he make you not a people so happy that all Nations shall call you so, Deut 33 29 <HI>Happy Israel who is like thee, a People saved by the Lord.</HI></P>
