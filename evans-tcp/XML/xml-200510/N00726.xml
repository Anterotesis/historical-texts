<P>ONE thing that Satisfies Ʋs <HI>Christians,</HI> in the Truth of <HI>Christianity,</HI> is <HI>Your</HI> Obstinate Aversion to that Holy Religion. Our Blessed <HI>JESUS,</HI> the <HI>Author of our Faith,</HI> foretold your continuance under the Circumstances now come upon you, un∣til the <HI>Times of the Gentiles</HI> in the <HI>Four Monarchies,</HI> just now Expiring, are Expired. And your own Inspired Prophets, who are now more <HI>Ours,</HI> than <HI>Yours,</HI> foretold your being poenally given up to the <HI>Deafness, Blindness, and Hardness</HI> now upon you. But, behold, a Proclamation here sent you from Heaven, invi∣ting you, to persist no longer in your Damnable <HI>Rebellion</HI> against the <HI>CHRIST</HI> of God!
