<P>For David, after he had served his own Generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his Fathers, and saw corruption.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words are part of a <HI>Sermon</HI> which was Preached by <HI>Paul</HI> an <HI>Antioch,</HI> wherein he demonstrates the Resurrection of the Lord Je∣sus Christ, by what is written in the 16<HI>th.</HI> Psalm, where it is said, <HI>thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see Corruption.</HI> That must needs be meant either of <HI>David</HI> himself or of the <HI>Messiah</HI>: But it cannot be so affirmed of <HI>David</HI> himself, for ha saw Corruption. <HI>Davids</HI> Body had been turned to Dust in the Grave for some Ages before that Time; therefore that passage in the Psalm must be meant of Christ, whose Holy Body did not lie long enough i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Grave to see Corruption. This is the Apo∣stles
<PB REF="000831_0003_0FAB4063AF64ACD8"/>
scope and design in the words before us, which are a Compe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dious History of the Life and Death of <HI>David.</HI> 1. We have his Life. It was a Life of Service to his own Generation, and that by the Will of God. The Greek word <HI>HUPERETESAS,</HI> here Translated <HI>he had Served,</HI> is a <HI>Metaphor</HI> taken from <HI>Rowers,</HI> who se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve the Pi∣lot in the safe passage of the Vessel. This World is a Sea, the Church is like a Ship tossed on the Sea, God is the Pilot, by whose Skill and Provi∣dence that Ship is Steered: He is pleased to make use of men as <HI>Under-Rowers</HI> to Serve his Providence. Whereas <HI>David</HI> is here said to Serve <HI>his own Generation</HI>; That Expression may imply two things. (1.) That he Served the People who Lived in the same Age in which he Lived; for in that sense is the word frequently used in the Scripture. No man can do Service for a Generation of men who were gone out of the World before he came into it. No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can a∣ny man do Service for those that shall come in∣to the World, after he is gone out of it, except∣ing what he did whilst himself was here. (2.) A Generation is sometimes taken for <HI>the Age of one man,</HI> as well as for the men of one Age. Thus when 'tis said, <HI>David</HI> Served his own Generation, this is intended, <HI>sc.</HI> that as long as he Lived in the World, he continued to Serve those that were his Contemporaries. He Lived to be Seventy years old, and so long did he con∣tinue
<PB N="5" REF="000831_0004_0FAB4064681BFD78"/>
a Servant of his Generation. Moreover, when it is affirmed, that He Served them <HI>by the Will of God,</HI> that may import: (1.) That he fulfilled the Decree of God in that his Service. He did all ths Service which God from Eterni∣ty had willed that <HI>David</HI> should do. As no Servant of the Lord can Dy before the appoint∣ed time, so neither shall he Dy until he has finish∣ed all that work which God has asore determi∣ned that that man shall do. Every Servant of God is Immortal, until his work is done. (2.) The Expression imports, that the Precep∣tive Will of God was that according to which <HI>David</HI> acted in his Serving his own Generation. As he used to Pray that he might know, and that he might do the Will of God. We hear him praying, <HI>Give me Understanding,</HI> shew me the way wherein I should go, Lord, <HI>Teach me to do thy Will,</HI> so he did Practise according to his own Prayers. Thus did <HI>David</HI> Live.</P>
<P N="2">2. We have a description of the Death of this Faithful Servant of God, and of his People. (1.) <HI>He fell Asleep.</HI> That Expression and De∣scription of Death when applied to Holy men, intimates an happy Death: In this World (as 'tis said of <HI>Judah</HI>) they <HI>find no rest</HI>; but Death puts an end to all their hard Service and Suffer∣ings. (2.) <HI>He was Laid unto his Fathers.</HI> This is true both in respect of his Body which was Laid in the Grave, as his Fore fathers who
<PB N="6" REF="000831_0005_0FAB4065F7638CD8"/>
were Dead had been. And in respect of his Soul, which which was carried to that Heaven, where his good Father <HI>Jesse</HI> (whom the Jews are wont to call <HI>Jessai the Righteous</HI>) and his Fore-fathers, <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> were gone before. Often in the Scripture when men dy, they are said to be <HI>Gathered unto their People</HI>; which Expression implies the Immorta∣lity of the Soul. At the Hour of Death men pass out of this World into the World of Souls. (3.) <HI>David saw Corruption</HI>; which is to be un∣derstood not of his Spirit, but of his Body on∣ly. That Corruption is in order to a Resur∣rection unto a Glorious Incorruption. As Grain, it may chance or Wheat or some other Grain, is sown under the Earth, and then it corrupts, but after that riseth again with a great addition of beauty; so it is as to the Dead Bo∣dies of Saints, they are sown in Corruption, but raised in Incorruption. This may serve for the opening of the words.</P>
<P>The Doctrine from them is,</P>
<P>That the Grave will be a Blessed Bed of Rest to that man who shall Serve his own Generation ac∣cording to the Will of God.</P>
<P>In order to the Explication and Confirmati∣on on the Doctrine mentioned, I shall only Answer this practical Case of Conscience. <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="000831_0006_0FAB4066B384EF30"/>What is to be done in order to our so Serving ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Generation, as that when we Dy, we may go int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Blessed Rest.</P>
<P>For Answer.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This is to be laid in the Foundation, we mus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be Principled and Spirited aright, or we shall no Serve the Generation wherein we Live so as to fin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Acceptance with God.</HI> They that have not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> principle of Grace in their Souls, whose <HI>heart</HI> are not <HI>Established with Grace,</HI> either will not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Service which the Lord requi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of them or if they do, they will not so perform it as t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> please him. All acceptable Obedience spring from two principles.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>From a principle of Faith in Christ.</HI> If th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> person is under the Curse and Wrath of God the Service done by him is not pleasing. N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> man is accepted with God, but the Believer o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christ. It was by Faith that <HI>Abel</HI> offered a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Acceptable Sacrifice, and <HI>without Faith it is im¦possible to please God.</HI> Heb. 11.4, 6.</P>
<P N="2">2. All acceptable obedience proceeds fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>a Principle of Sincere Love to God.</HI> He shew mercy to thousands of them that love him an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> keep his Commandments. <HI>Exod.</HI> 20.5. Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> keeping of the Commandments which proceed from a slavish fear, and not from love, is no pleasing. A small matter that proceeds fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hearty love, will be accepted. History tell us of a poor man, that when he had nothing
<PB REF="000831_0007_0FAB406768649B50"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etter to give, presented to his King a Cup of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old Water, which because it was from hearty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove was accepted and rewarded. To be sure the King of Heaven will reward small Services <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the best of ours are such) which he sees flow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom a principle of love to his Name. Heb. 6.10. <HI>God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love which you have shewed to his Name.</HI> We see this in that instance of the poor widow, whose two Mites being cast into the Lords Treasury were highly acceptable, because an evidence of great love to his Name. Whenas the most splendid Services not proceeding from these principles are of no account. King <HI>Amaziah</HI> did notable things in his Generation, which the Church of God in that age was benefited by. He destroyed no less than twenty thousand of their Enemies: but God did not approve of him, because his heart was not rightly principled in what he did. It is noted of him that <HI>he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart.</HI> 2 Chron. 25.2. He wanted faith in Christ, &amp; a sincere love to God in what he did. There have been amongst the Gentiles famous <HI>Heroes,</HI> who have done mighty things for their Country in the age wherein they lived, but since they had not faith in Christ, all those Services were (as <HI>Austin</HI> truly speaks) no better than <HI>Splendida peccata,</HI> glistering sins.</P>
<P>Moreover, Men will be spirited and inclined
<PB N="9" REF="000831_0008_0FAB406828493F68"/>
according as they are principled. The man that has faith which worketh by love in his heart, can not be of a meer selfish Spirit. It is private Interest and Selfishness which makes men un∣serviceable to the World in their Generation. Whenas it is impossible that the same Person should be a true Believer oh Christ, and yet a meer self-seeker. Faith and Love will make a Christian deny himself, that so he may pro∣mote the Interest of Christ, and the good of his People. This we see in <HI>Timothy</HI> of whom the Apostle writing to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> giveth this Character, <HI>For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state: for all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christs.</HI> Phil. 2.20, 21. He that would do Service for his Ge∣neration must be of a publick Spirit. He must have a large Soul that shall design and endeavour not so much his own particular profit, as the good of many. A man can't Serve his Gene∣ration without Serving many: for there is no Generation wherein there are not many whose welfare is to be endeavoured. For this we have a great Example in <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cai,</HI> who <HI>was accepted of the Multitude of his Brethren, seeking the wealth of his People.</HI> Esth 13 3. And no less an Instance of a publick Spirit we see in <HI>Paul,</HI> who did not only Exhort Christians, <HI>not to seek their own,</HI> that is to say, not that only, but <HI>every man anothers wealth,</HI> but did himself practise accordingly.
<PB N="10" REF="000831_0009_0FAB4068E8297A98"/>
I (sayes he) <HI>Please all men in all things,</HI> (he meaneth so far as in duty he was bound to) <HI>not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many that they may be Saved.</HI> 1 Cor. 10.24, 33. He that will Serve his Generation must be willing to spend and be spent to promote the welfare of others It is reported of one of the <HI>German</HI> Princes, that he took for his device a Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> burning, with this <HI>Motto</HI> under it, <HI>Alijs Servi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, meipsum Consumo,</HI> in Serving others, I consume my self. The like unto which was that of Doctor <HI>Sibs,</HI> who had for his device, a light burning with this <HI>Motto, Praelucendo pereo</HI>; in giving light to others, I wast away. The man that is principled, and well stored with Faith and Love, will certainly be of a publick Spirit, and so Serve his Gene∣ration.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In order to Serving our Generation, it is necessa∣ry that we should make the will of God as revealed in the Scriptures our Rule.</HI> The written word of God is the Rule according to which we must believe. It was well replyed by our famous English Martyrologist, when some urged him to Subscribe certain <HI>Ecclesiastical Canons,</HI> he pro∣duced a Greek Testament, saying, <HI>I'le Subscribe to all this,</HI> with all my heart, but if your <HI>Canons</HI> are not according to this Book of God, I dare not Subscribe them. And this was but accor∣ding to <HI>Pauls</HI> profession, Act. 24.14. <HI>Believing all things that are written in the Law and the Pro∣phets.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="000831_0010_0FAB4069A8329A88"/>
The will of God as revealed in the Scrip∣ture, is a Rule of Obedience as well as of Faith. It is a perfect directory, shewing us how we must Serve God, and how we must Serve the Generation wherein we live: Nor will any man Serve his Generation aright, if he does not make that his Rule. This was the Rule that <HI>David</HI> acted by, as the Apostle in the words be∣fore us does Testify, <HI>He Served his Generation by the will of God.</HI> No man is to make his own will his Rule. Kings themselves may not do it. <HI>David</HI> was a King: nevertheless, the Rule by which he Served his Generation, was not his own will, but the will of God. The Kings o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Israel, where with their own hands to Copy out the Divine Law, that so they might from thence take direction how they should Govern It is reported to the everlasting honour of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christian King <HI>Alphonsus,</HI> that he read over th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whole Bible with Comentaries fourteen times that so he might be the better able to Serve hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Generation, and that too as a King.

Word of God. So the Psalmist, Psal 119.24. <HI>Thy Testimonies are my Counsellors.</HI> A man may likewise do singular Service for the Generation wherein he liveth, by <HI>Suffering in a good cause.</HI> Some will thereby be confirmed in the Faith▪ That Consideration was one thing which made the Holy Apostle willing to Dy a Martyr. Phil. 2.17. <HI>If I be offered upon the Sacrifice and Service of your Faith, I joy and rejoyce with you all</HI>: since they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ould have benefit by his Sufferings, he was willing in that way to Serve them: or, it may be others will be Converted thereby. The Martyrs were instruments of Converting many in the Generation in which they lived &amp; dyed, by their Sufferings. The Papists said concern∣ing one of the Martyrs in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that was burnt to Death for his Religion, that the smoke of that fire infected all that it was blown upon, and made them turn Protestants. But in passive as well as active Obedience we must have respect to the will of God. Christians must be careful that they do not suffer as evil doers▪ Nor ought they to bring Sufferings on themselves further than as God shall call them thereunto: A regard must be had to the will of God in all. Where∣fore the Apostle sayes, <HI>Let them that suffer accor∣ding to the will of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommit the keeping of their Souls to him, in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</HI> 1 Pet. 4.19.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="13" REF="000831_0012_0FAB406B2826E288"/>3. <HI>In order to Serving our own Generation, so as to be able to give a Comfortable account at Death, it is necessary that we should improve the Talents which God betrusteth us with, for the good of others.</HI> There is great variety as to the Talents which the Lord of all seeth meet to commit unto men. There are some whom he blesseth with Estates above others: They are in that respect more able to promote the publick good; and the Lord expects it from them. Men are apt to think that their Estates are given to them fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> themselves, or for their own Relations only but they ought to do good in their Generation therewith, devoting some part of their Estate unto Publick, Pious, and Charitable uses. 1 Tim▪ 6.17, 18. <HI>Charge them that are Rich in this world that they do good, that they be rich in good work ready to distribute, willing to Communicate.</HI> A ric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> man if he has an heart may do a world of goo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with his Estate, which will be Comfortable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Death, and augment his glory after Deat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> There are some that God has blessed them wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Excellent parts, both natural and acquired.

one man that has Excellent gifts and parts with a Sanctified heart to improve them to the utmost for God and for his People. A man of Eminent parts and ability may possibly do great Service for a whole Generation, by speaking a few words: That accomplished Persom, Sir <HI>William Fitz James,</HI> by a speech in Parliament made way for the Reformation in <HI>England,</HI> begun <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Reign of K. <HI>H.</HI> 8.

So have Faithful Ministers whom Christ has fixed in the Firmament of his Church an happy influence on the World, in their several Generations. As the Stars are common Blessings to all the World, so are they They are <HI>the Salt of the Earth</HI>▪ Mat. 5.14. should there be but one Age in which were no Faithful Ministers of Christ, the whole World would purify for want of this Spiritual Salt by which Generations are preserved from Corrup∣tion. Ministerial Gifts are a great Talent; whoever shall improve them faithfully in Serv∣ing his own Generation, will find the Grave to be a Blessed Bed of rest to him, and his Works will follow him to Heaven. <HI>Daniel</HI> did not on∣ly do great Service for the People of God in the Court of <HI>Persia,</HI> but as a Prophet. And an Angel from Heaven said to him, <HI>Thou shalt Rest, &amp;c.</HI> at the End of this World, he shall have a Glorious Lot in the First Resurrection. Dan. 12.13. Thus then do we Serve our Generation by improving the Talents which God has given to us. There are some that have many Talents committed to them As in the Parable, one had two Talents, another one, another Five. <HI>David</HI> had so. He was a P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ince and a Prophet too, a man that was va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly Rich, and one of extraordinary Parts, <HI>Wise like an Angel of God.</HI> All these Talents did he use for the be∣nefit

of his own Generation. There are none but they have some Talent or other whereby they may be Serviceable. Tho men in Publick Place have greater Talents than others, never∣theless, they that sustain only a Private Capaci∣ty, are for all that in a Capacity to Serve the Generation which they are of. He that has a Family, by giving a good Education to his Chil∣dren, Serveth the Common wealth which will be advantaged by those Children. A private man that has a Calling, and is diligent therein, Serveth the Publick. He that is a Sincere God∣ly man, by his Prayers and by his Exemplary Conversation does good to others in his Gene∣ration.</P>

In the Dayes of <HI>Noah,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Crying Sin of the Old World was Sensuali∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. The World was Drowned in Sensual Lusts, while the Flood came and Drowned them all. The Earth was corrupt before God; all Flesh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad Corrupted his way. Only <HI>Noah</HI> was found <HI>Righteous in that Generation. Gen.</HI> 7.1. He Preach∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d against the Sins of the Times; the Scripture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alls him a <HI>Preacher of Righteousness.</HI> 2 Pet. 2 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> He Preached that men should Turn from Sin, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Live an Holy, Righteous Life. In that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay did he Serve his Generation according to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he will of God. When the Children of Israel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere in the Wilderness, the sin which they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hiefly guilty of was Unbelief and Murmurings, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he fruit of their Unbelief: That whole Gene∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation was guilty, excepting <HI>Joshua</HI> and <HI>Caleb,</HI> who were of another Spirit; and did a good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervice for that Generation, in endeavouring to Convince them of their Evils. After they were settled in the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI>: Idolatry was the Reigning Sin in divers Ages. The Holy Prophets Served their Generation in bea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing witness against the Idolatries and Supersti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions of the Times. After the Return from Captivity, neglect of Divine Institutions and Worldliness were the special Sins of that Gene∣ration.

of no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a few in that Generation, did thereby do singular Service for God and for them. None have done greater Service for the Age wherein they Lived, then Eminent Reformers. <HI>David</HI> was such an one. Things were much out of order when he first came to the Throne; his Pre∣decessor <HI>Saul</HI> was a man of little Religion. The Ark of God was not regarded in the Dayes of <HI>Saul.</HI> 1 Chron. 13.3. He was a bloody ha∣ter of the most Holy men, and one that put the Wickedest in the Nation into Places of Power and Trust; and as long as it was so, there was no possibility of the Nations being Reformed; but <HI>David</HI> no sooner had power to do it, but he Turned Ungodly men out, and put better in their places. Such did he make to be <HI>Pillars</HI> in the Civil State, and did himself Judge uprightly. Psal. 75.2, 3. And he Settled Religion according to the mind of God. Thus did he cause a great Reformation, Serving his own Generation by the will of God. Several of the Kings of <HI>Ju∣dah</HI> were great Reformers. So <HI>Jehosaphat, Asa, Hezekiah, Josiah</HI>; and in their being such, they Served their Generations. The Reformers who lived in the last <HI>Century,</HI> were great Servants of their Generation.

there are the special Sins▪ of the Times to be Testified against, and that we should endeavour the <HI>Reformation</HI> of; so there are the more pecu∣liar Truths and Duties of the Times, which men that would Serve their own Generation, must witness unto. That Truth which is re∣ceived in one Age, is Persecuted in another. There are <HI>Labouring Truths,</HI> which meet with the greatest opposition from Satan and from the World. There is that which is called the <HI>pre∣sent Truth.</HI> 2 Pet. 1.12 In the Apostles Dayes, the present Truth was, <HI>That Jesus of Nazareth is the promised Messiah, the Son of God, and the Savi∣our of the World.</HI> The Holy Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ by Preaching and Propagating that Glorious Truth throughout the World, Ser∣ved their own Generation according to the Will of God. After that Christianity had prevailed and triumphed over <HI>Judaism</HI> and <HI>Heathenism,</HI> the great Truth most opposed in the World, was that which concerns the Eternal <HI>Deity</HI> of Jesus Christ the Son of God. <HI>Athanasius</HI> did singular Service for his Generation, in standing up as a Champion for the Truth, when (as that Ancient speaks) the whole World sighed to see it self become an <HI>Arian.</HI> After this, <HI>An∣tichristianism</HI> (that is <HI>Popery</HI>) sprung up, and got head, and then the Truths which concern the Offices of Christ were invaded and violated by the Man of Sin. There have been many Con∣fessors

and Martyrs, whom the Lord Jesus has raised up in the last Ages of the World, who by their Preaching, Writing, and Sufferings, have born witness to the Truth relating to the Pro∣phetical Office of Christ, in asserting the per∣fection and fulness of the Scripture, against all Traditions and Canons devised by men; and to the Priestly Office of Christ, in maintaining Justifica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion by the alone merit of that one Sa∣crifice of the Humane Nature of Christ, but once offered; and by maintaining those Bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed Truths, they Served their own Generations. The Truths of this Age wherein it has been the Will of God that our Lot should be cast, are those which concern the Kingly Office and Power of the Lord Jesus Christ. That He is the only Head of his Church: That no Officers, no Ordinances, no Sacraments, or Religious Ce∣remonies ought to be there, besides what Christ himself has appointed. And as such as these are the Truths of the Age, so in a very special manner of the place wherein the Divine Provi∣dence has cast our Lot to be. What was it that our Fathers came into this Wilderness for? It was pure Conscience to the Second Command∣ment that brought them hither. It was that so they might build Sanctuaries for the Name of the Lord. It was, that so they might measure the Temple according to the Golden Rule of the Scripture. It was with respect unto Purity

as to all Church Administrations, that they fol∣lowed the Lord into a Land which was not Sown. Wherefore notwithstanding too many of <HI>this Generation,</HI> who are lamentably Degene∣rated from the Principles and Spirit or their Fa∣thers and Grandfathers, will rage at it, we can∣not easily do a better Service, than to withstand Innovations which would prove fatal to the Churches, and to the Interest of Christ's Holy Kingdom among them. And let not those enter into the Sanctuary, which thou, O Lord didst Command that they should not enter into thy Congregation. <HI>Lam.</HI> 1.10.

good to all, but especially to the house hold of Faith: The more good we do, the more like are we to Christ. Examples are many times more prevalent than Precepts.

was the Speech and Spirit of our English <HI>Josiah</HI> (as he is commonly and deservedly cal∣led) King <HI>Edward</HI> 6. who after he had promo∣ted the Building of <HI>Christ Church</HI> Hospital, and other Works for the benefit of the City &amp; Na∣tion, and with his own hand, both Signed a Charter, &amp; contributed liberally, in the presence of his Council, Lifting his Eyes to Heaven, said, <HI>O Lord God,</HI> I <HI>thank thee, in that thou hast spared my life to do this Service for thy Name before I Dy.</HI> Two days after which he dyed, having in a few years done wonderful Service for God and for his People.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>We should in a singular manner take care of those things wherein the Welfare of the Generation is con∣cerned.</HI> The Spiritual and Eternal Welfare of those we live amongst, we ought most of all to desire and endeavour. And therefore to do what in us lieth, that the Gospel of Salvation may be Preached to them. Alas, there are dark Corn∣ers in this Country, which are perishing for lack of Vision. It is said, (Cant. 8.8.) <HI>We have a little Sister that has no Breast, what shall we do for her!</HI> So there are little places (and some consi∣derable ones too) in <HI>New-England,</HI> that have no Breasts, no Ministers from whom they may re∣ceive the sincere milk of the Word. What shall be done for them? There are some especially in this Town of <HI>Boston,</HI> who have Contributed li∣berally unto so good a Work, by which they
<PB N="32" REF="000831_0031_0FAB410AE9B805F0"/>
have done a real Service for Christ, and for the Souls of men, and so it will be acknowledged a∣nother day. In taking yet further care, as for the Gospellizing of <HI>Heathen Indians,</HI> so of <HI>Hea∣thenish English,</HI> we shall do an acceptable Service in our Generation. Let me also say, That the Welfare both of this present, and of succeeding Generations, is very much concerned in the E∣stablishment of the <HI>Colledge,</HI> which is the Foun∣tain from whence must flow those Streams which will make glad the City of God. By taking care that the Government thereof be confirmed in faithful hands, that will transmit it unto such Successors; we may be instrumen∣tal to make Generations happy. Whoever shall be instrumental in obtaining so great a Good, will do a singular Service both for the present, and After Generations. What a doleful Case had <HI>New-England</HI> been in before this day, had it not been for that Blessed Nursery, almost all the Churches being supplied from thence. Nor do I know wherein I or any man can do a greater Service for this Generation, than by taking effectual care that the <HI>Tutors</HI> there be such as shall make Conscience to Establish the Young Scholars in those Holy Principles of Truth, for a Testimony whereunto their Blessed Fathers came into this Wilderness, and for the Defence and Propagation whereof they Erect∣ed a <HI>Colledge</HI> here.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="000831_0032_0FAB410BAA6637B0"/>But thus for Answer to the Case proposed.</P>
<P>All that I shall say by way of <HI>Application</HI> is only this.</P>
<P><HI>We see that no Eminency of Usefulness can keep men out of the Grave.</HI> A <HI>David</HI> that Serveth his Generation with the greatest industry and fidelity, must fall asleep, and see Corruption. When his work is done, he must go to Rest in the Bed of the Grave; and a sweet Rest and Repose will it be. It is said of Merciful men, &amp; Righteous men; yea, of Serviceable <HI>Josias</HI>'s, that they <HI>Enter into Peace.</HI> So they do at the Hour of Death in respect of their Souls, and <HI>they shall rest in their Beds,</HI> namely in respect o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Bodies, which are Laid in the Grave. Isa 57.1, 2. The Psalmist takes notice that Wise men Dy as well as the Fool, and the bruitish person. Psal. 49.10. So the most Useful me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dy, as also those who are <HI>telluris inutile pondus</HI> Burdens on the Face of the Earth, and it may be Scandals to the Generation whereof they are. Yea, it is one of the Mysteries of Divine Providence, that eminently Useful men are ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken away by Death, when others that only number the Ground, are suffered to live. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Holy Minister, (who has lived Sermons as wel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as Preached them) Dyes, when others wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

have been a reproach to the Gospel, and to all Religion, are living still.</P>
<P>And truly, every year does sadly confirm the Truth of what you hear. Have we not seen very Afflicting Instances of it in the year that is past. Look over into <HI>London,</HI> and we shall see that eminently Faithful and Useful Mini∣sters of God, are lately removed from thence. I forbear to speak of a Brother of mine, who had his Education in this <HI>Colledge,</HI> and after that Served his Generation in the Work of the Gospel for the space of Forty Seven Years in <HI>England, Holland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI>; and now he is Fallen asleep. But there is Blessed <HI>Anstey, Cole, James, Vincent,</HI> all within this twelve-month Gone to <HI>the Spirits of Just men made perfect</HI>; and a little before them, <HI>Buris, Fincher, Laurence, Mayo,</HI> these were all Eminent Ministers of Christ. And I have the rather mentioned them because I had not long since a dear Acquain∣tance with them all. One such stroke seldom goes alone. An ingenious Writer on occasion of many Ministers Dying in the same year, ob∣serves, <HI>That when a Generation of Contemporary persons begins to Crack, it quickly falls. The Leases of their Earthly Cottage Commencing at the same date, oft at the same Term Expire.</HI> And I remem∣ber that Twenty years ago, an Eminent Person in <HI>London,</HI> sent me a Catalogue of no less then Forty Two Ministers belonging to that City,
<PB N="35" REF="000831_0034_0FAB410D2A4E4E98"/>
who Dyed in the space of about ten years. But we need not look so far off as <HI>London</HI> for a tre∣mendous Verification of the Truth before us, since amongst our selves in less then half a year, besides several young Ministers, three others of principal Note, and Use, are Laid in the Grave. In the Neighbouring Colony, no lon∣ger since than the last month, that Serviceable <HI>Hooker,</HI> (who was the worthy Son of a most worthy Father) is gone to his Rest. He was eminently Useful on more accounts than one. The Lord Jesus Christ had made him a Pillar in the Temple of his God: (And without Envy be it spoken) there is not a greater Pillar remaining in all the House of God throughout that Jurisdiction. The Churches there are all weakned by his Fall, The manner of his Death was very much like unto that of our Precious and forever famous <HI>Juel,</HI> whom Death found in the Pulpit Preach∣ing to a Congregation at <HI>Lacock</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire.</HI> I observe that many Super eminent Ministers of the Gospel have dyed suddenly: So Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> the never to be forgotten Teacher of <HI>this Boston:</HI> And in <HI>England</HI> of late years; Mr <HI>Hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingsworth</HI> in <HI>Manchester,</HI> Mr. <HI>Wills</HI> and Mr. <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edger</HI> in <HI>London</HI>: And when a few years since I Sojourn∣ed in that City, Mr. <HI>Hurst</HI> (my dear friend) and Mr. <HI>John Oakes,</HI> (faithful and eminent Mi∣nisters of Christ both of them) were taken ill in the Pulpit, from thence carried home and
<PB N="36" REF="000831_0035_0FAB410DEB764438"/>
dyed suddenly. It was an honour and a favour from God to them, that they were <HI>found so doing.</HI> Mr <HI>Capel,</HI> Mr. <HI>Vines,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Gouge,</HI> (that Eminent Servant of his Generation, who was the Son of famous Doctor <HI>Gouge,</HI> and in Exemplary Piety not inferiour to his Father (all these (honourable men of God) dyed in their sleep, on a Lords day night: Thus did they fall asleep after they had Served their Generation according to the will of God: What hapned to them was more like a <HI>Translation,</HI> than a <HI>Death.</HI> Such a Death as theirs was, and as our <HI>Hookers</HI> was, is sometimes a sign of Gods special Love to his Servants, but of his Anger kindled against that People, out of whose hands he has snatched his Jewels. But we see then that the dearest Servants of Christ are Subject to the arrests of Death. Yea, if we look into this very Congregation, we see it, one that often spoke in the Name of the Lord from this Pulpit, and (as I take it) the words which I am now upon, were the last which he Preached on in this Place; six months ago he Rested from all his La∣bours. God made him very Serviceable, espe∣cially in that part of the Country where for the greatest part of his Time, he had Served his Generation. <HI>Portsmouth</HI> oweth more than a lit∣tle to his Memory. No longer since then the last Week, another Faithful Ambassador of Christ is called Home, who if he had been Li∣ving,
<PB N="37" REF="000831_0036_0FAB410EA99AF0A0"/>
and in Health, should have spoken in the Name of the Lord here this day. It is said in Prov. 10.7. <HI>the memory of the Just is blessed,</HI> which words the Jews constantly apply to their Dead Deceased Friends that have been of eminent Use among them. The Seventy Greek Inter∣preters express it by saying. The Memory of the Just is <HI>[met enkomione] with Praises.</HI> It is not my work this day so much to Praise the Dead, as to Instruct the Living: Nor shall I enlarge on his Character of whom you heard many things the last Lecture. Only I must say of him, as is here said of David, <HI>He Served his Generation according to the will of God.</HI> He was truly a very faithful Servant of God. Considered as a Christian. He kept a strick Watch over the frame of his own heart every day. If he had hapned to speak but so much as one unprofitable word, so tender was his Conscience as that he would se∣verely reflect upon it, and mourn before the Lord in Secret, afore he slept that night. He was of a Peaceable temper; and would do any thing which he thought was not repugnant to the will of God, rather than make a Schism in a Church of Christ. Considered as a Mini∣ster, he was Eminently Faithful and Servicea∣ble. God honoured him, in making him one of the <HI>Confessors</HI> of these last dayes. The Spirit of a <HI>Martyr</HI> was in him. He endured a sore
<PB N="38" REF="000831_0037_0FAB410F9DBF2878"/>
Imprisonment in <HI>Limrick</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> for his bearing witness unto <HI>the present Truth,</HI> which the Lord would have his Servants in this Gene∣ration to stand up for. And on that account (as our Fathers, &amp; we our selves, some of us did) he became Subject unto a Voluntary Exile into these goings down of the Sun. I have been informed, that the unhappy man, who was the chief Instrument and Instigator of his Imprison∣ment in <HI>Limrick,</HI> was afterwards himself by the Papists made a Prisoner there, and that then he Cryed out in horror; <HI>This misery is come upon me, for my causing</HI> Mr. Baily <HI>to be cast into Prison.</HI> When his Ministry found great acceptance in the World, his Soul would tremble lest haply his <HI>Reward</HI> should be (like that of the Pharisees) only a <HI>Reputation</HI> amongst men in this World. His very heart was ingaged in desires and endeavours to promote the Con∣version of Souls: And God made him Eminent∣ly Successful therein. There are many who will bless God to Eternity, that ever they knew him: And at the day of Judgment (which the Lord hasten) we shall no doubt see verified in him that Scripture in <HI>Daniel,</HI> where it is laid, <HI>They that turn many to Righteousness shall shine as the Stars for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="000831_0038_0FAB41110DCFC440"/>The Use which we should all make of such a Death, is, to Prepare to follow: And there∣fore to make all the hast we can in finishing our work. If we serve our Generation accord∣ing to the will of God; If we Glorify him on the Earth, when we have finished the work which he has given us to do, he will glorify us with Himself, and that not for one Gene∣ration, but throughout the never ending dayes of ETERNITY.</P>
