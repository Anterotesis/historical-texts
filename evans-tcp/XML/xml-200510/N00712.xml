<P>THese Sermons were earnestly desired of me, and Copies of them to be Exposed to publick view: I was the more unwillingly willing▪ since by my former frequent Preaching when alone in this Church, (that is the Ancientest in the Town) as their only Officer; the whole work lay up∣on me, and thereby much lost and impaired my strength and voice in the clearness and vi∣vacity

I have adventured to Expose to Your Lordships Eye, what I was not so fit to say to Your Hearing: These brief Discourses that are intended for practise, and have been affecting to some, which I acknow∣ledge is not from the manner of their delivery, nor quaintness of the stile, nor worth of the Instrument: But the Great God delights to manifest his Wisdom and Power in Saving Dispensations, to do it by weak and in the worlds account foolish Instruments, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.21, 24. I look on my self as the least of Saints, much more the meanest of Gods Servants in the Ministry. It is my Comfort that God hath counted me faithful putting me into his Ministry: And that I may be so, and may have that Honour to be at last so counted, is my highest ambition. Next to that is any Esteem from those God hath highly Honour∣ed; As he hath Your Excellency, both with respect to Your Illustrious and Noble Family, highly Honourable among men: But especial∣ly as it is made Eminently so with God and man, in the grace and special favour of God:

God delights in Exalting his own wisdom and power in this work, and therefore makes use of such as may not Eclipse but brighten this Glory. What is weak in it, reckon it to the Instrument, not with toe severe Censure, but with pitty, and further your Prayer for him: what is of use and benefit, let God have all the Glory.

<HEAD>Mans Self-Reflection, Is the Special Means to further his RECO∣VERY from his APOSTASY FROM GOD.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM 119.59.</HI></BIBL>
<P>I thought on my Wayes, and turned my Feet unto thy Testimonies.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Psalms if the Scriptures be Com∣pared to a Body, may well be cal∣led the heart of it; in other parts of it God mainly speaks to man: In this there is the gracious mans pouring out his
<PB N="10" REF="000858_0006_0FABF14670616BF8"/>
Soul to God, and manifests his holy affections to others, especially in this Psalm. It is parted into Twenty Two Paragraphs, each begin with an Hebrew Letter Alphabeticaly, the first with <HI>Aleph,</HI> and so on; so that we have it thus repeated eight times in the whole, and may well be called the true Christians Instru∣ctor, in which God Teacheth him not only by his Word, but the Examples of Saints the true practise of Godliness. By his Precepts he tells us, what we ought to do, and the way we should walk in to Salvation, by Recorded Ex∣amples what Saints did that were in this way of Salvation, which we are to Enquire after for our Imitation. <HI>Jer.</HI> 6.16. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the wayes, and see and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your Souls.</HI> This Example before us is thought to be <HI>Davids,</HI> who probably was the Pen man of the Psalm. In this Paragraph which is the Eighth in or∣der, &amp; begins &amp; ends with the Letter <HI>Cheth.</HI> The Psalmist begins with asserting his right in God <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his <HI>Portien, verse</HI> 57. which he proves.</P>
<P>First. By his Esteem of his Word, and Sub∣jection to his Soveraignty.</P>
<P>Secondly. By the high Esteem of his Fa∣vour, which he proves by his Reverend Sincere and Earnest Supplication for it as an effect of his faith in his promise, <HI>verse</HI> 58.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="000858_0006_0FABF14670616BF8"/>Thirdly. It is further proved by his Conside∣ration and Thoughtfulness of his ways to fur∣ther his Repentance and Return to God after <HI>straying from him, verse</HI> 59.</P>
<P>This is both a proof of his Interest in God, and direction to the Cure of a Professing Peo∣ples Apostasy from God, where it is total or partial; and of use therefore to Saints and Sin∣ners, to further their true Repentance and Re∣formation. So I shall now Improve it.</P>
<P>In the words.</P>
<P N="1">1. The means he used, <HI>I thought on my ways,</HI> or, Consideration of his ways.</P>
<P N="2">2. The success of it: <HI>I turned my feet unto thy Testimonies.</HI> First, The means used, where</P>
<P>First, The Person that did use it, I <HI>David,</HI> a King, a Prophet, a Saint, a man after Gods Heart. So that it concerns Rich and Poor, High and Low, Good and Bad; as all need Repentance, so should use this means.</P>
<P>Secondly. The act, <HI>I thought.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. The Object, <HI>My wayes.</HI> The word in Hebrew used as Criticks tell us, it signi∣fies a curious viewing of a thing on every side, &amp; round about it; or exact Consideration of a curious work; if one thing were amiss or not: So he did his ways, that is, his actions or way of his heart, the inward movings of his will &amp; affections in its desire &amp; resolutions. And his External Walk &amp; Conversation, whether accor∣ding to Gods Rule of them or not.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="12" REF="000858_0007_0FABF14A6CF2E5A0"/>2. The success of it, <HI>I turned my feet to thy Testimonies.</HI> I will or shall turn: It was a Re∣solution stirred up in him, which he acknow∣ledgeth to God as giving success to this means, and his Encouraging Promise, he depended on his faithfulness in it, to turn the affections of his Soul; and his External Conversation to Gods Testimonies, the right way and rule of all his Actions; in which is described his true Repentance and Reformation after wandring from Duty; or the Cure of his Apostasy.</P>
<P>Whence the Observation is:</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>That due Consideration or thoughtfulness on their ways, is a special means for the Cure of the Apostasy of Gods Professing People from their due Obedience to him.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Apostasy is a Disease Gods Professing People are subject unto. A Reforming People are so, that have made the highest profession of Reformation and Recovery from the first and grand Apostasy in our First Parents. Some to a total, where not a Saving Change. And the best of Saints to that that is partial; a <HI>Da∣vid,</HI> as he says, <HI>verse</HI> 176. <HI>I have gone astray like a lost sheep, seek thy Servant.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. God hath appointed means for the cure
<PB N="13" REF="000858_0007_0FABF14A6CF2E5A0"/>
of it that they should use, though God only can succeed it. As the Ministry of the Word, <HI>Isa.</HI> 58.1. <HI>Jer.</HI> 8.22. <HI>Is there no Balm in Gi∣lead? Is there no Physician there?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. This of Consideration is a special one, mans own applying to himself, Job 5.27 <HI>See it and know it for thy good.</HI> Hag. 1.5.7. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, Consider your ways,</HI> which is Reitera∣ted. Mans Self Application of what he hears, that Inward Preacher in stirring up Thought∣fulness of a mans own wayes.</P>
<P><HI>Reason</HI> 1. This Consideration of our ways, is necessary by Gods Precept requiring it, in order to Repentance. <HI>Hag.</HI> 1.5. and his dislike where it is not. Deut. 32.29. <HI>O that there were such in heart, that they would consider their latter end.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reason</HI> 2. Thence ariseth an acknowledgment of Sin, and Aversation to God, which is the beginning of Returning, as he, <HI>I turned,</HI> where∣in is an acknowledgment of a need of turning, as being out of the way; this is sometimes put for the whole of what God requires. <HI>Jer.</HI> 3 13. <HI>Psal.</HI> 32.5. And ariseth from bethinking them∣selves, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 6.37. <HI>only acknowledge your Ini∣quity. I confessed my sin, and thou forgavest</HI>; if they bethink themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Reason</HI> 3. It is perfected our Saving Return to God, by Gods Efficacious Grace in this way, both in first and after Repentance; so it
<PB N="14" REF="000858_0008_0FABF14CB30923C8"/>
was here: <HI>And I turned,</HI> I will or shall do it, hi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Resolution was stirred up by the work <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Powerful Grace, and Encouraged to Endeavo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it by the same promised grace. Hosea 6.1, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 3. <HI>Come, and let us Return unto the Lord; for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hath torn, and he will heal us: he hath smitte<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and he will bind us up. After two dayes will he revive us, in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight. Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.</HI> 1 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oh. 1.9. <HI>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</HI></P>
<P>The further clearing and Improving this Text and Doctrine, shall be in Answer to this practical Question.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What is this Thoughtfulness of our wayes or actions that is such a special means for the cure of Apostasy in a Professing People of God?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. In general take this description of it.</P>
<P>It is the Exercise of all the powers of the Rational Soul by mans Self Reflection for the knowledge of his ways or actions, and for his right Judgment of them with reference to Gods final approving Judgment.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is the Exercise of all the Powers of the Rational Soul, the Understanding, Will and Affections.</P>
<P N="2">2 In way of Self-Reflection for the know∣ledge of his actions, which is peculiar to a
<PB N="15" REF="000858_0008_0FABF14CB30923C8"/>
Rational Creature, and mainly intends his mo∣ral actions, as under the direction of a moral Rule for his Obedience, and Happiness, in Enjoyment of God, according to his promise, to his obedience. <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.9.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is for his Right Judgment of them. Man hath a Judicature in himself, God hath Authorized in him, and is the supream and highest on Earth; subordinate only to God about his own actions in reference to God, and his inward duty to him. Rom. 14.4. <HI>Who art thou that judgest another mans servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth.</HI> None are to judge others in things that are indifferent in matters of Religion, or doubtful to true Chri∣stians, but themselves, about the sincerity in them or not. <HI>vers.</HI> 13. <HI>Let us not therefore judge one another any more, but consider our own wayes.</HI> The Judge is Conscience. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.12. That is a Witness as well as a Judge, having the best knowledge of what is in man, next to God. 1 Cor. 2.11. <HI>For what man knoweth the things of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n man, save the Spirit of man which is in him?</HI> And hath Authority in the man to stir up all the powers in it, for its right judgment, therefore the Psalmist here saith, <HI>I thought,</HI> be∣ing set on work by Conscience that is seated in the heart or practical judgment, that influ∣enceth the whole. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.20, 21. <HI>If the heart condemns,</HI> (that is Conscience) God is greater,
<PB N="16" REF="000858_0009_0FABF14DE8C16920"/>
and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>till much more condemn; but if it does not there may be Appeals to God to Justify, and confidence in it through Christ. Psal. 130.4. <HI>But there is forgiveness with thee that thou mayst be feared.</HI> Its Knowledge and Authori∣ty to stir up the activity of the Rational Pow∣ers is in order to this Judgment.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is with reference to Gods final approv∣ing judgment of them. This is the chief end of the power of Conscience in man. It is to be approved of God; all our Actions may in his final judgment. 2 <HI>Cor</HI> 5.11. It was so in mans Innocency, to prevent sin, to justify in way of perfect Obedience; and since the Fall under the Gospel its main use is to further es∣caping Gods Condemnation of them. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.32. by judging themselves, and appealing to Gods Gracious Throne for approbation and pardon through Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. More particularly, I shall endeavour to shew what are those Exercises of the powers of the Soul when Conscience is awakened to its duty, in order to true turning to God, are stirred up by it, and in what order.</P>
<P>First. The understanding power of the Soul, it sets that a work, which is the first Ope∣ration of the Soul in order to Returning to God; a seeing and knowing of our wayes or actions▪ None can rightly judge of what he doth not know, and right knowledge of them
<PB N="17" REF="000858_0009_0FABF14DE8C16920"/>
must go before any serious thoughts about <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ending them, or returning to a right way; we must see we are wrong. For clearing this, take these Remarks about it.</P>
<P>First. That in mans first Creation. God gave man an Excellent Understanding; not only into the natures of all other Inferiour Creatures, to give them suitable names there∣unto, but also to know his own duty to God as the way to his Happiness; not only by the written Law of God in his heart, but his posi∣tive Law in the Sanctions of the Covenant with him: He Reveals what is good, and his way to his Happiness. <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.9, 17. and what is evil, that which God forbids. And he had a freedom and power to will and choose the one, and refuse the other, but Created and Mutable; and so by the abuse of that power hath lost it, and his knowledge with it of mo∣ral good and evil, wholly as saving, and any right judgment of it in order to it.</P>
<P>Secondly. In Fallen man there are some Remains, as some call them, of the light of nature in their Consciences; or as others ra∣ther would call them, common gifts to fallen man; God gives to all men as benefits in com∣mon from Christs Death to all mankind, that are beneficial to Humane Society, though not
<PB N="18" REF="000858_0010_0FABF14DEC24EB28"/>
saving to the person. Thus we read, Rom. 1.18. <HI>Who hold the truth in unrighteousness,</HI> (that is, sin against the light of Conscience) The Heathens had a natural light about good and evil, as beneficial or destructive to Humane Society. <HI>Verse</HI> 29. <HI>who know that they that do such things are worthy of death.</HI> And some know∣ledge of duty to God by the help of the works of Creation. <HI>verse</HI> 19, 20. <HI>Because that which may be known of God, is manifest in them, for God hath shewed it unto them, For the invisible things of him from the Creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God head, so that they are without excuse,</HI> which though not saving, yet l<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t them without excuse; and Sins against it, deprived them of much of Gods common Goodness, and brought them under much of present displeasure, and the effects of it, which might have been avoided. Rom. 2.14, 15. <HI>For when the Gentiles which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the Law:</HI> (That is in that Law written, the Scriptures) <HI>these ha∣ving▪ not the law, are a law unto themselves. Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing, or excusing one another.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. But God hath provided further
<PB N="19" REF="000858_0010_0FABF14DEC24EB28"/>
help for the knowledge of our ways, and fur∣thering Saving Returning out of that Apostasy, and after-strays from his Rule. And that is the Dispensation of his Word. Rom. 2.4. <HI>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbea∣rance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the good∣ness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</HI> Psal. 147.19, 20. <HI>He sheweth his word unto Jacob: his sta∣tutes and his judgments unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with every nation.</HI> Which hath the pro∣mise of the Spirit in the right dispensation of it. <HI>Isa.</HI> 30.20, 21. <HI>Their eyes shall see their Tea∣chers, and shall hear a voice behind, saying this is the way walk in it.</HI> and the success of it depends thereon.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is a further outward light and dis∣covery of Sin, in the sinful and penal evil of it; the written Law of God makes discovery of the evil nature of it in that original pravity of our natures since the Fall, and of all our evil practices. Rom. 3.20. <HI>By the Law is the knowledge of Sin,</HI> and by the Gospel of the Re∣medy. <HI>verse</HI> 23, 24. <HI>all have sinned and come short of the glory of God▪ Being justified freely by his grace, through the Redemption that is in Jesus Christ.</HI> The Law strips you naked, and lets you see sin and misery. And the Gospel discovers the way out of it. Rev. 3.17, 18. <HI>and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. Buy of me gold tried in the
<PB N="20" REF="000858_0011_0FABF14EB27C2DD8"/>
fire, that thou mayest be rich, and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear, and anoint thine eyes with eye-salve, that thou mayest see.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. There are common gifts of the Spirit, which much heightens the light of nature in thus seeing Sin and the Remedy, and some∣times powerful Convictions and Awakenings of Conscience thereby. Acts 2.37. <HI>They were pricked in their hearts, and said, Men and Brethren, what shall we do to be saved?</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up Enqui∣ry after the Remedy.</P>
<P N="3">3. There are saving illuminations of the Spi∣rit in the Dispensation of the Word, whereby man Fallen is Restored to a true, though not a perfect knowledge of God and himself, so of the evil of Sin, and good of Obedience, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.6. which is necessary to a right judgment of our ways, to a saving-turning to him. <HI>Acts</HI> 26.18. called, <HI>a turning from darkness to light, and the power of Sin and Satan to God</HI>; a sanctifying all the powers of the Soul, and begins with this, in giving a spiritual eye, fit to discern a spiritual object. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.15. <HI>The spiritual man discerneth all things.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. This is the knowledge to be sought and waited for in the Reading the Word, &amp; Dispen∣sation of it. <HI>Mat.</HI> 20.32, 33. for Christs open∣ing them as to the blind men he did. <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.39.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is to be exercised in the knowledge of
<PB N="21" REF="000858_0011_0FABF14EB27C2DD8"/>
your ways or actions. <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.34. <HI>Wait at Wisdoms gates,</HI> both inward and outward, by seeing them in the glass of the word. <HI>Jam</HI> 1.25. <HI>Whoso look∣eth into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, will be a doer of it, and blessed therein.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Making a through search into your hearts, and trial of your ways thereby, especially un∣der Afflictive Dispensations for sin, an allusion to Judicial Proceedings, that is in <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.40. <HI>Search and try your ways, and turn to the Lord.</HI> Find out the sin, and all the aggravations of it, by searching and trying your ways, or Exami∣ning. And there is need of Calling in Gods search. <HI>Psal.</HI> 139.23, 24. <HI>Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts. And see if there be any wicked way in me: and lead me in the way everlasting.</HI> To avoid de∣ceits of our sinful and deceitful hearts. Jer. 17.7, 10. <HI>The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, who can know it? I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins.</HI></P>
<P>The second operation of the Rational Soul to be exercised, is the Memory, whereby things known are kept and recalled when actu∣ally forgotten, and is of special use in turning to God; and in fixing the thought upon our ways. This is helped in the first operation of it, retaining things to be thought on.</P>
<P>First. By the right, clear and practical know∣ledge of them. A good memory depends on

the good Understanding. Those that have the clearest understandings have the happiest memories, especially where it is practical about sin and duty, when under the powerful Con∣victions by the Word and Spirit, to a deep sense of sin, in its sinfulness and penal evil of it, to stir up to a Concernedness for delive∣rance, see <HI>Act.</HI> 2.37▪ As they were at <HI>Peters</HI> Sermon that were pricked at the heart. The Apostle <HI>James</HI> tells us, <HI>Jam.</HI> 2 25▪ That such an Hearer of the Word, that looks into the Law of God, (that is his Word) that Reveals the whole mind of God for Salvation, as the Angels do into the Mysteries of mans Redem∣ption, revealed, 2 Pet. 1.12. where is the same word, exerciseth his understanding to know it, enquires after it, and hath impressions of the worth and weight of it; <HI>he is not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of it.</HI> It is a proverb concer∣ning old men, <HI>Quod curant se<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es meminerunt.</HI> What old men love, they will remember in old age, when memory fails them in other things. Answerable to that Counsel of <HI>Solo∣mon.</HI> Prov. 22 6. <HI>Train up a Child in the way he should go, and he will not depart from it when he is old.</HI> The Experience of Christians testifie to it, those that most complain of their weak memories, yet words they have understood, and had impression of on their hearts, they never forget. <HI>David</HI> had such a Remembrance

of it; that he puts God in mind of it. <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.49. <HI>Remember the word, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.</HI> And encourageth his own faith in him about it, endeavour after such a knowledge. 2 Pet. 3.18. <HI>But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,</HI> as the way to the Remembrance of them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Conscience Records all a mans actions in the memory, good and bad together, with Gods Dispensations to him by his Word and Provi∣dences. It is the Recorder, and Memory is the Book where they are written in order to Gods judgment of them finally, and for our judgment to prevent his Condemning judgment. <HI>Jer.</HI> 17.1. <HI>It is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a Diamond.</HI></P>
<P>Hence 2. The second act of memory is needful and useful to the cure of Apostasy, which is recalling to mind that which, is actu∣ally forgotten concerning Gods Law, his Or∣dinances and Providences, and our own sins.</P>
<P N="1">1. This God helps in by his Word written, by frequent requiring it in his people to Re∣member his word. Prov. 4.4, 5. <HI>Let thine heart retain my words: keep my Commandments and live. Get wisdom, get understanding, forget it not.</HI> His works▪ <HI>Exod.</HI> 13.3. <HI>Remember this day in

which you came out of Egypt.</HI> both merciful and afflictive also. <HI>Deut.</HI> 24.9. So their own sins▪ Deut. 9.7. <HI>Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the Lord thy God to wrath in the Wil∣derness.</HI> So by the Ministry of it, it is one great use of it to put thee in remembrance. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.13. <HI>I think it meet, so long as I am in this Taber∣nacle to put you in remembrance.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. By his Providences. 1. Afflictive. Gen. 42.21. <HI>They said one to another, we are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear: therefore is this distress come upon us.</HI> 2. By merciful Providences. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.63. Then you shall Remember your sins, <HI>when I am pacified to you,</HI> and loath your selves for them.</P>
<P N="2">2 It is our duty to stir up our own remem∣brance of our wayes. And that</P>
<P>First. By looking over the Record of Con∣science, as <HI>Ahasuerus</HI> did the Records of his Kingdom. Esth. 6.1, 3. <HI>When the King could not sleep, and he called for the Records, which were read before him; and enquired what honour had been done to</HI> Mordecai <HI>for saving his life.</HI> To see his neglect of his duty, in Rewarding faith∣ful Service to him; so should we, to see our Omissions of Duty, and Commissions of Sin, with the aggravations of them, as against the
<PB N="25" REF="000858_0013_0FABF15055DB0438"/>
Justice or Mercy of God to us; see them as written in your heart. <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.25. see that Law written in the heart, is a setting sin before you. <HI>Psal.</HI> 51.3. <HI>My sin is ever before me.</HI> As disco∣vered in the glass of the Law, and bringing your ways to the discovery of it.</P>
<P>Secondly. Stir up the activity of memory to its duty in it. <HI>Deut.</HI> 16.12. <HI>Thou shalt remember thou wast a Bond man in Egypt.</HI> Isa. 63.7. <HI>I will remember the loving-kindness of the Lord, accord∣ing to all the Lord hath bestowed on us.</HI> Psal. 77.11, 12. <HI>I will remember the works of the Lord, surely I will remember thy wonders of old.</HI> Resolve on it, you will remember the words and works of God, to humble for sin, and encourage to duty.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another operation of the Soul needful to the Recovery from Apostacy, is Thoughtful∣ness or Consideration of our ways, which fol∣lows that of memory; as we cannot remember what we do not know, so cannot think of it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f we do not remember; this affords matter for consideration and meditation. Truth is the food of the Understanding, which it commends to, and stores in the Memory; and meditation concocts for use and nourishment to the whole man, the will and affections of the Soul to live and walk in the strength of it, and is prin∣cipally here intended and expressed by; I thought or considered my ways, and turned.
<PB N="26" REF="000858_0014_0FABF155487223D0"/>
The thoughts are the perfecting acts and ope∣rations of the Soul, whereby the Idaea and I∣mage of things are framed in it, which it un∣derstands and remembers, and hath the most immediate influence on the will and affections, as they have on the actions.</P>
<P>As things we outwardly see are represented by the phansie and common sense to the un∣derstanding; so when they are practically known and remembred it is conceived in the will and affections, as a Child in the womb, and are therefore called the first born of the understanding. And though a man doth not always outwardly practise and bring forth to outward view all such thoughts to mans judg∣ment of him, yet they as in the thoughts are in Gods view▪ and he judgeth his state thereby as good or bad; so he saith of fallen man as in his natural estate. Gen. 6.5. <HI>The imagination or figments of his heart are evil, and that continually.</HI> Prov. 23.7. <HI>As he thinketh, so is he.</HI> And there∣fore he calls for thy change, as the begining of our true turn to him. Isa. 55.2. <HI>Let the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous his thoughts, and Return.</HI> Jer 4 14. <HI>Wash thy heart, O Jerusa∣lem▪ how long shall vain thoughts lodge in you.</HI> And he judgeth of his true Conversion to him by this begining of it. 2 Chron. 6.37. <HI>If they be∣think themselves and turn.</HI> So that it is necessa∣ry and useful in Recovery from Apostasy, as
<PB N="27" REF="000858_0014_0FABF155487223D0"/>
that God stirs up Conscience to excite in them that do turn into the right way. I shall not further enlarge upon what, thoughts are, being limited by my Text, to the Activity of them in our own ways, as the special subject or ob∣ject of them, to further turning into Gods ways. And more specially that it is on the sinful ways of heart and life in us, those that must be turned, from which God by his Pro∣phet calls his people to do▪ <HI>Hag.</HI> 1.5 7. as a means of Repentance, and was successful, <HI>verse</HI> 12. In my Text we have an eminent Exam∣ple of it, and in the duty and success of it. To direct and help in imitation of it.</P>
<P>First. Think or meditate on the sinfulness of your ways, as you should know the evil of them by the Word, and remember the Con∣victions by it, with all the aggravations of them. So think on it, and keep your hearts to it. <HI>Psal</HI> 51.3. let sin be always before you to humble you, and further seeking pardon and mortification of it, by seeing your selves in the glass of the Word. <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.25.</P>
<P>Secondly, Meditate on the penal evil of it, what your sin deserves? What Afflictions and Effects of Gods Displeasure for your sins? So meditate on Gods present Providences, as the punishments of your evil ways, <HI>Hag.</HI> 1.8, 9,
<PB N="28" REF="000858_0015_0FABF157B8377AC0"/>
10, 11. bids them consider the neglect of their duty to God, and his carriage to them, which was for their sin that he frustrated their expectations of his common benefits. They did sin in unfruitfulness to him. <HI>Isa.</HI> 5.4, 5.</P>
<P>The grounds of this meditation or consi∣deration, or helps in it are,</P>
<P N="1">1. A consideration of Gods Mercy, Good∣ness and Patience; think on this, Rom. 2.4. <HI>Despisest thou the Riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long suffering, &amp;c.</HI> You that live under Gospel means have more advan∣tage than others have by the light of nature, having also the Gospel Revelation of the Remedy against sin, and a continu∣ance in his world, notwithstanding provoca∣tion by often abusing his mercies, all of them in Rebellion against him, using of them against him, not only his common mercies, but despising that which is the richest Mer∣cy; Discovery of the way to your being the Subjects of his Reconciled Favour, that should lead you to the way of it. This highly aggravated sin in those under the means of Salvation. Deut. 32.6. <HI>Do you thus requite the Lord, O foolish people and unwise?</HI> It is not only the greatest ingratitude, but the highest folly to despise your own mer∣cies Ezek. 18.30. <HI>Turn why will you dye, O

House of Israel?</HI> Jonah 2.8. <HI>A forsaking your own mercies.</HI> Those that might be so, if you did improve the means, and get into the way of it. Especially, it is a meditati∣on true Converts should most think of, that are under greater mercy in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Sub∣jects of his special goodness. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12.7, 8, 9. Thus the Prophet did awaken a <HI>David</HI> to this duty, to think of what God had done for him. <HI>verse</HI> 13. And would do fur∣ther in renewing his pardon to him. This appears in the discovery of his nature. <HI>Exod.</HI> 34.6. <HI>And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.</HI> In his making his glory pass before <HI>Moses,</HI> he hath discovered his gracious nature, the free and full pardoning mercy that is in him. And promises. 1 <HI>Job</HI> 19. <HI>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins.</HI> And he is faithful in his promise to Christ, and that is owing to him, and all in him to encou∣rage this duty.</P>
<P N="2">2. Meditate &amp; think on the Justice of God. He is just as well as merciful and holy, 1. In his nature. Exod. 34.7. <HI>I will not clear the guil∣ty.</HI> In the Threatnings of his word. <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. <HI>He that sins shall dy the death.</HI> Psal. 7.11. <HI>He will what his Sword against the Impenitent.</HI> And his

Providences Recorded in his Word. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.4, 5, 6. He spared not the old world, nor <HI>So∣dom,</HI> which are fearful instances of it. Nay, the Heathens that improved not the light of nature. Rom. 1.18, 26. he manifested his wrath from heaven against them by spiritual and outward Judgments; nay, his only professing people in the world. Rom. 11.22. <HI>If he spared not the natural branches, will be spare you.</HI> Nay, the severest outward Dispensations of Provi∣dence is usually on such. <HI>Amos</HI> 3.2, 3. nay▪ his own Children. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12 11. Beside consider his Providential Dispensation among your selves for neglect of duty he calls to, or commission of sin, <HI>Hag.</HI> 1.8, 9. He directs to think of the Judgments they were under, in disappoint∣ing their expectations of the good and useful∣ness of the Creatures to them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Meditate on the Day of Judgment. <HI>Acts</HI> 17.31. <HI>He hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world.</HI> This is a meditation to Re∣pentance, that there is a fixed day of Gods Final Judgment of all mens ways, good and bad, and their states, manifesting thereby a Revelation of his Righteous Judgment. <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.6. It shall go well with the Righteous in their state and way of Gospel Obedience; but it shall not go well with the wicked. <HI>Isa.</HI> 3.10. This is that the Lord after the

manner of men affectionately wisheth their consideration of. Deut. 32 29. <HI>O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end.</HI> There will be an end of your living in this World, the thing is certain. <HI>Heb.</HI> 9 28. the time to us uncertain: And there an end of Gods patience and forbearance, and space of Re∣pentance to the Impenitents, and the lon∣ger it is, the greater treasure of wrath <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.5▪ And an end of the patience and ex∣ercise under troubles and difficulties to the Godly in their way of Obedience to God. 2 Thes. 1.6, 7, 8. Think on this day which will be a day of Refreshing. Acts 3.19. <HI>When the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.</HI> To the penitent and gracious reward of your Obedience.</P>
<P>Having given some special helps and grounds of meditation, let me further help and move to the duty by some Directions and further motives in it under this Head.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD>DIRECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>Keep your hearts to it, the heart is ve∣ry loth and averse to it naturally, especial∣ly on such serious thoughts as these are: Therefore set Conscience to its work, to

apply those things home, and affect the soul with it. Job 5.27. <HI>Know it for thy good,</HI> and watch your hearts. <HI>Prov.</HI> 4.23.</P>
<P N="2">2 Avoid hindrances, especially wandring and vain thoughts. Jer. 4.14. <HI>O Jerusalem, how long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee</HI>: Get your hearts free from that: Let them not have lodging; possess the heart, that thoughts are sin, and though not open to man, yet under Gods observance and judgment. Eccles. 12.14. <HI>God shall bring e∣very work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether is be good, or whether it be evil.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Avoid Companying with vain and idle persons, and often converse with the Godly. <HI>Mal.</HI> 3.16. <HI>They that feared the Lord, spake often one to another, and thought upon his Name.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Take sit seasons and times for it, and places, (times) the morning and nights are fit times, sometimes oftner. Psal. 1.2. <HI>He meditates on the Law of God, day and night. Psal.</HI> 5.2, 3 <HI>My voice shalt thou bear in the morning, in the morning will I direct my pray∣er unto thee, and will look up.

<P N="1">1. It is the way to have Gods Grace given where it is not, and unlooked for Blessings; though God is not tyed to it, yet his ordinary way it is to work on Rational Creatures sui∣tably to their Reason. And stirs up the exercise of it. <HI>Acts</HI> 2.37. <HI>Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter, and to the rest of the Apostles, Men and Brethren, what shall we do?</HI> And to revive it where it is. <HI>Psal</HI> 39.3. <HI>My heart was hot within me, while I was mu∣sing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue.</HI></P>
<P>The success here in my Text: <HI>I turned,</HI> which is an acknowledgment to God of his turning Grace, not only being there, but acted by him, effectually to turn him.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is the ordinary way of Wise men,
<PB N="34" REF="000858_0018_0FABF159EDD8A608"/>
in their Concerns of this World. The Merchant thinks on his way in his Trade, whether right, and how he prospers, by looking over his Accounts. The Marriner hath his Compass and Observation how he Steers his Course by it, to mend it where it is otherwise then it should be. And shall we more exercise our Rational Powers for Earth, than for Heaven?</P>
<P N="3">3. Consider. It is an evidence of Gods thoughtfulness of you of Peace and Salva∣tion, and that from Eternity. Jer. 29▪10, 11, 12. <HI>I will visit you, and perform my good word towards you, in causing you to return to this place. For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken un∣to you.</HI> And it is pleaded here by <HI>David,</HI> as a sign of his Integrity and Effectual Vocation. Jer. 31.3. <HI>I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with loving-kind∣ness have I drawn thee.</HI> So it is presented for the Consideration of Gods People, to further their Repentance, as encouraging to Consideration as a means to it.</P>
<P N="4">4. The fourth and last operation of the
<PB N="35" REF="000858_0018_0FABF159EDD8A608"/>
Rational Soul in exercise for Returning to God, are his judging thoughts, to make a right judgment of them, to prevent Gods condemning for them, 1 Cor. 11.31. <HI>For if we would judge our selves, we should not be judged with the World.</HI> Prov. 28.13. <HI>He that confesseth and forsaketh, shall find mercy.</HI> This is the turning act, so far as in mans pow∣er, and he doth it as under the influence of Gods Grace, therewith he makes a judg∣ment of his ways, as in or out of Gods Testimonies.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is a judgment of his own ways to be evil, and out of the way of Gods way of his Testimonies, which is supposed in his tur∣ning his feet into them; this is the first part of true Repentance and Reformation, of their turning from sin, not only in his outward pra∣ctice, but also the inward affections also, that are the feet of the Soul; he sees all is wrong, his heart, his life, he is going in the way to his destruction, from God as his por∣tion, as his Soveraign. And as he sees this, so he judgeth and passeth sentence on this his evil way, and condemns it as that deserves Gods Condemnation, and Justifies God in his Righteous Sentence in the Law. Gen. 2.17. And justifies God in all the lesser Executions, Psal. 51.4 Silenceth complaint of them. <HI>Ezra</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="000858_0019_0FABF15AF6E6EA98"/>
9.13. <HI>Seeing that thou our God, hast punished us les<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than our iniquities deserve.</HI> And assures them without Repentance, and the Gospel Remedy, they shall be Condemned at the Higher Court. 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 3.20. And not only passeth this Sen∣tence, if you turn not, you shall dye eternal∣ly, but begins Execution in Gods Name and Authority on the Soul, as <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d</HI> on <HI>Eglon. Judg.</HI> 3.20, 21. <HI>And Ehud came unto him, and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for him∣self alone: And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat. And E<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly.</HI> So saith Conscience to the Sinner, and runs the Threatnings to the heart, this is that which is called pricking to the heart. <HI>Acts</HI> 2.37. at the heart of sin, and wounds it in its course, &amp; sets it a bleeding, which the Law cannot; he also kills sin and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> confidence.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is a turning the feet to Gods Tes∣timonies, this is the returning to the right way, by judging aright of Gods way, which he testi∣fies of him, in his Gospel Revelation of par∣don and grace in Christ, for Returning Sin∣ners: this he judgeth to be right, the only way of Life, and Salvation. So the smitten Soul is at first put on Enquiry about it, and mourning for sin, and after the healing balsome
<PB N="37" REF="000858_0019_0FABF15AF6E6EA98"/>
of the Gospel, for pardon and grace in first Conversion, and so in after Return∣ing, this moves the affections to the getting into this way, and Renouncing all other, and to be willing to confess and for∣sake Sin. <HI>Prov.</HI> 28.13. <HI>Whose confesseth and forsaketh, shall find mercy.</HI> 1 Joh 1.9. <HI>If we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our sins, he is faithful, and just to for∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</HI> And to be in love with thank∣ful Obedience to the Commands of the Gospel. 1 Joh. 5.3. <HI>For this is the love of God, that we keep his Commandments, and his Commandments are not grievous</HI>; his f<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et and affections will be carried this way of Gos∣pel Obedience. Thus think on your ways to such a turning, pray for Gods directing of you. Jer. 10.23. <HI>O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh, to direct his steps.</HI> And enlargeth the heart to Run the wayes of Gods Commandments.</P>
<P>Oh! That what hath been said, might stir up to this Duty, to think so on your ways, that your hearts may be turned to Gods Testimonies. I have directed to the way, and I shall pray that God would put you into it: Do your Duty in waiting on him for his assistance to do it as you

<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould. Jer. 31.18, 19, 20. <HI>I have heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus, Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: Turn thou <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and I shall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God. Surely after that I was turned, I repent∣ed: and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth. Is Ephraim my dear son? Is he a plea∣sant Child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bow∣els are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the Lord.</HI> Oh! that you may so think on your ways, that you may turn your feet unto Gods Testi∣monies; that so you may have Gods ac∣ceptance, and manifestation of his Fatherly Love to you.</P>
