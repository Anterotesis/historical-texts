<P>And in the first place it was by them agreed and ordered, Forth-with to fortifie the City of New-York.</P>
<P>And that for the better Security of the Fort (since the Garrison was weak, and to prevent all manner of Doubts and Jealousies) a competent Number of the City Militia should keep Guard in said Fort, and <HI>Nicholas Bayard,</HI> Coll. of said Militia recommended to give suitable Orders accordingly.</P>

<P>It was also recommended to said Coll. <HI>Bayard</HI> to hasten to fortifie the City with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l possib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e speed, who upon the Credit of the Revenue did advance what Money was need∣ful for Materials.

sort of the Inhabitants (affirming, <HI>That King</HI> James <HI>being fled the Kingdom, all manner of Government was fallen in this Province</HI>) to rise in Arms, and forcibly possess themselves of the Fort and Stores, which accordingly was effected whilest the Lieut. Governour and Council, with the Con∣vention, were met at the City Hall to consult what might be proper for the common Good and Safety; where a party of Armed Men came from the Fort, and forced the Lieut. Governour to deliver them the Keys; and seized also in his Chamber a Chest with <HI>Seven Hundred Seventy Three Poun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Twelve Shil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ings</HI> in Money of the Govern∣ment. And though Coll <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard,</HI> with some others ap∣pointed by the Convention, used all endeavours to prevent those Disorders, all proved vain; for most of those that appeared in Arms were Drunk, and cryed out, <HI>They disown'd al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> manner of Government</HI> Whereupon, by Capt. <HI>Leysler</HI>'s perswasion, they proclaimed him to be their Commander, there being then no other Commission Officer amongst them.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Leysler</HI> being in this manner possest of the Fort, took some Persons to his Assistance, which he call'd, <HI>The Committee of Safety.</HI> And the Lieut.

<P>Two days after, a printed Proclamation was procured by some of the Council, dated the 14th of <HI>February,</HI> 1688. whereby their Majesties confirmed all Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, Collectors and Receivers of the Revenues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being <HI>Protestants</HI>; which was forth-with published at the City Hall by the Mayor and Alder men, accompanyed with the Council, and most of the chief Citizens and Merchants. And pursuant thereunto the Collector, <HI>Mat.

<P>But as soon as those Gentlemen entered upon the Office, Capt. <HI>Leysler</HI> with a party of his Men in Arms, and Drink, fell upon them at the Custom-House, and with Naked Swords bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them thence, endeavouring to Massacree some of them, which were Rescued by Providence.
