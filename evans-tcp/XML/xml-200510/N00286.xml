<P>This Court doth Order, That it shall and may be lawful for any Person or Persons to Erect any small Building; Pro∣vided, it do not exceed eight Foot square, and seven Foot Studd, of Wood or Timber; any Law to the contrary not∣withstanding: Provided they have the Approbation of the Select-men of said Town.</P>
