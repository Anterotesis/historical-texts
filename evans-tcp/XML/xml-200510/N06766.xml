<HEAD>A LETTER ADDRESSED TO Two GREAT MEN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORD, <HI>and</HI> SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will be surprised at an Address made to you jointly in this Manner; but as I have not the Honour to be much acquainted with ei∣ther of you, though I esteem you both, (at least while you remain connected) I hope you will for∣give me for troubling you, in this public Way; and the rather, as I think the Matters I shall write upon, to be of very great Importance; and as you will discover by what I am going to suggest to you, that I am a true Friend to Old <HI>England,</HI> and a sincere Lover of my Country.</P>
<P>I have long thought that our <HI>Ministers of State</HI> may be much assisted, in their Deliberations, by Persons who have not the Honour of sitting at the Council Board. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wisest Measures have often
<PB N="2" REF="008585_0004_102F8AEBF1608C78"/>
been pointed out, in the Course of parliamentary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and Members of either House, perhaps those l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>d by Government, have fre∣quently been earliest in suggesting such Plans of public Policy, as Government itself has been glad to adopt. The Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inction of factious Opposition, the Un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nimity of every Party, and the Acquies∣cence of every Connection, in whatever Scheme is proposed by his Majesty's Servants, while it hath produced infinite Advantages to the Public, hath deprived those who direct the Cabinet, of all such Parliamentary Instruction, as their Predecessors in Power used to receive. You, my Lord, of late, scarcely hear any Speech in the House of Lords, but that of a Lawyer on a <HI>Scotch</HI> Appeal; and the hereditary Council of the Nation rarely assemble for higher Purposes than to alter <HI>Settlements</HI> and de∣liberate on Bills of <HI>Divorce.</HI> And you, Sir, in the other House, where so many skilful Champions used formerly to engage and struggle for Victory, remain single in the Field of Battle; and your Speaker takes the Chair only to vote <HI>Millions</HI> and levy Thousands, without the least Debate or Op∣position.</P>
<P>The Channel of Parliamentary Instruction being thus stopt, no other but that of the Press is left open, for those Heads of Advice to which it may be worth your While to attend. For this Reason it is, that I have thought of addressing you in this Manner. Who I am, it matters not. Let it suf∣fice, that, unpe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sioned and unemployed, I can vie, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Zeal for the Public, with those who taste the Sw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ets of exorbitant Salaries, and unfathomed Per∣quisites. Whether my Knowledge be equal to my Zeal; whether my Acquaintance with the World, and Experience in Business, have enabled me to offer any Thing that may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> real Utility, must
<PB N="3" REF="008585_0005_102F8AEEE9608B68"/>
be determined by you, and by the Public. This I am certain of, that my Intention is honest; and while I please myself, I shall endeavour, at the same Time, not to offend either of you. Some Produc∣tions, in which you have, of late, been jointly taken Notice of, proceeded from a <HI>fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tious</HI> Disposition, which I am unacquainted with, and detest. For, far from wishing to disunite and separate your In∣terests, I am fully persuaded that without your per∣fect Harmony and Union, the great Events which have happened under your Administration, will not have those permanent good Consequences so much to be wished for: And it is only from your joint Concurrence, that we can hope for any of those prudent, spirited and national Measures con∣cerning which I propose to offer you a few Hints, in this Address.</P>
<P>Considering the present distressed Condition of <HI>France,</HI> fallen from its alarming Power, and Great∣ness, into the lowest State of Distress and Impotence; unfortunate in its military Operations in every Quar∣ter of the Globe▪ beaten all <HI>Europe</HI> over by Sea and Land; its Fleets sailing, only to be destroyed; its Armies marching, only to run away; without Trade; no Credit; stopping Payments, protesting Bills, and to all Intents and Purposes a Bankrupt Nation; their King, the Princes of the Blood, the Nobility, and the Clergy carrying in all their Plate to be coined, for the present extreme Exigency of their Affairs; disappointed and baff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in all their Schemes on the Continent, and taught to think no more of <HI>Invasions,</HI> by the Destruction of the only Fleet they had left;—I say, considering all these Circumstances, which I have not exaggerated, in the least, it is not unnatural to imagine, that a Period will soon be put to the Troubles of <HI>Eu∣rope. France,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> on the War, must
<PB N="4" REF="008585_0006_102F8AF1F6BFEE20"/>
soon be reduced to the Necessity of suing for Peace.</P>
<P>We have had Bloodshed enough. God forgive those who have occasioned this terrible Destruction of the human Species, and spread Misery, and De∣vastation, for so long a Time, in almost every Corner of the Globe. The great Success with which the Arms of <HI>Britain</HI> have been blessed, puts it in our Power to give Peace to <HI>Europe:</HI> and it is to the Honour of his Majesty and those who di∣rect his Councils, that the Distresses of our Ene∣mies have only enabled him to give the World a Proof of his Moderation; and to shew that his In∣clination to make Peace, keeps Pace with the Ina∣bility of <HI>France</HI> to prolong the War.</P>
<P><Q>As his Majesty entered into this War, not from Views of Ambition, so he does not Wish to continue it, from Motives of Resentment. The Desire of his Majesty's Heart is, to see a Stop put to the Effusion of Christian Blood.</Q></P>
<P>What was declared in the above Paragraph of his Majesty's Speech from the Throne, to our own Parliament, at the Opening of this Session, has since that, been notified in Form to our Enemy. The Readiness of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Prussia,</HI> to enter into a Treaty, and to give Peace to Christendom, which Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Wolfenbuttle</HI> hath been authorized to communicate to the <HI>French</HI> Minister at the <HI>Hague,</HI> will, no Doubt, open the Door for a Negotiation, in a Manner the most likely to be embraced by the Court of <HI>Versailles</HI>; whose Disgraces and Distresses, (too great to be dissembled, and too extensive to be remedied) will dispose them to listen with At∣tention to every Proposal of Accommodation, made to them by an Enemy whose Sword was unsheathed only to punish Perfidy; and whose Successes, as appears from their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> first Advances
<PB N="5" REF="008585_0007_102F8AF4C6EA0500"/>
towards a Treaty, have not infatuated them to prefer unnecessary and ruinous Conquest, to a rea∣sonable and solid Peace.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, to be hoped, and to be believed, that Peace is not at a great Distance; and upon this Supposition I shall beg Leave to offer a few Considerations to <HI>you,</HI> as to the Persons on whom the Fate of this Country depends; Considerations which are equally important as they are seasonable; and an Attention to which, before you enter upon any Negotiation, may, perhaps, assist you (if I may be allowed to suppose you stand in Need of any Assistance) in directing this Negotiation to such an Issue, as may be equally honourable to yourselves, and useful to the Public.</P>
<P>In this Situation of Affairs, one of the first Mat∣ters relative to the future Negotiation, which, no doubt, must occur to you, will be the Choice of those Persons who are to be trusted with the great Concerns of this Nation as <HI>Plenipotentiaries.</HI> As much will depend upon this Point, I shall beg Leave to begin with giving you my Thoughts upon it, and the other Topics on which I propose to trouble you will naturally arise from each other without observing any other <HI>Order,</HI> or Connection, besides that in which they shall pre∣sent themselves to a Mind intent upon its Subject.</P>
<P>With regard then to the Choice of <HI>Plenipoten∣tiaries,</HI> I cannot but lament the Difficulties you have to encounter, before you will be able to find such as the Public will have Reason to thank you for.—I am not totally unknowing in the Charac∣ters and Capacities of many among the great. But when I cast my Eyes around me, I own that I am surprized, greatly sur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>zed, but still more grieved, to find so few among us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pable of conducting the arduous Task <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Peace. Whether this
<PB N="6" REF="008585_0008_102F8AF67503D2B8"/>
hath arisen from Neglect in the Education of our Men of Quality; or whether the Qualifications which fit them for Statesmen, have been neglected, in Comparison of such as fit them for <HI>Arthur</HI>'s or <HI>Newmarket</HI>; or whether it be owing to the State Policy so systematically adopted, of late Years, of giving Places, not to Persons who can best exe∣cute the Business—but to those who can best do a Job; whatever be the Cause, the Fact is certain; and it is Matter of Amazement that there should be so few in this Island, who have given any Proofs that they are capable of conducting with Ability, much less with Dexterity, this important Business of a Nego∣tiation with <HI>France.</HI> Men who are versed in Trea∣ties, knowing the Interests, Pretensions, and Con∣nexions of the several Princes of <HI>Europe</HI>; skilled in the Principles of public Law, and capable of ap∣plying them on every particular Occasion; ac∣quainted with the Commerce, the Colonies, the Manufactures of their own Country; Masters of all the Instances of Infraction of former Treaties, which occasioned the War we are now engaged in: In a Word, Men whose Rank and Consequence amongst ourselves, may command Respect, and procure them Authority, amongst our Enemies; and who, to every other Qualification, already enumerated, can boast of an Integrity not to be cor∣rupted, and a Steadiness in supporting the Inter∣ests of their Country, which no Difficulties can dis∣courage, and no Temptations can shake:— Such are the Men, whom you must endeavour to employ, in the approaching Negotiation, and such, I hope, ye will be able to find; though, I own, I am puzzled to guess on whom the Choice will fall, none being, as yet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ointed out by the pub∣lic Voice, nor, perhaps <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> upon by yourselves. Times have been, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> have expected,
<PB N="7" REF="008585_0009_102F8AFAEEE06590"/>
to see <HI>One</HI> named to such an important Office, meerly because he was a Favourite, or a Favourite's Fa∣vourite; because he was connected with this Mini∣ster, or was a Relation of that great Man. But if we have too frequently trifled with our national Concerns, by trusting them in such Hands, I need not say that there are Circumstances at present which give us reasonable Ground for hoping that the same Sagacity, and Desire to serve the Public which hath found out, and employed the properest Persons to conduct the Operations of the War, will be exerted to find out the properest Persons (few as there are to be found) to conduct the Delibera∣tions of the Treaty.</P>
<P>Very deplorable indeed must be the Inabili∣ties of the Persons we shall employ, if their Nego∣tiations for Peace be conducted so awkwardly as to rob us of the Advantages we have gained by the War. If we may judge from late Events, <HI>France</HI> seems as little to abound with Wisdom in the Ca∣binet, as it doth with Courage and Conduct in the Field. And if the Negotiations at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> in which almost all the Advantages of War equally successful with the present, were given up, be urged as an Instance of the superior Dexterity of <HI>French</HI> Politics, it ought to be remembered that this was more owing to our own Divisions, than to <HI>their</HI> Sagacity, and the Inabilities of our Plenipotentia∣ries at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> tho' we had no great Reason, God knows, to brag of them. What, therefore, may we not expect from a Negotiation to be begun in very different Circumstances; when there exists no Faction whose Interest it may be to perplex and de∣feat it; and when that national Unanimity to which we, in a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> owe the Success of the War, will still <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it's blessed Effects, till it make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and honourable
<PB N="8" REF="008585_0010_102F8AFD8C417F38"/>
Peace?—However, favourable as these Circum∣stances are, the Choice of such Plenipotentia∣ries as may be likely to conduct the Negotiation, with Dignity, Dexterity and Integrity, becomes a Consideration which the Public will expect should be weighed with the utmost Attention. And, if such Persons cannot be found amongst us (which I hope may not be the Case) there is a very desirable Alternative still in your Power. Fix the Scene of Negotiation, where, indeed, for the Honour of our Country, I could wish to see it fixed. Name no other Plenipotentiaries to conduct the Peace but those Ministers who directed the War: And a Treaty of <HI>London,</HI> in such Hands, will make ample Amends for our wretched Management at <HI>Utrecht.</HI></P>
<P>But let Peace be ever so well made; let Mi∣nisters plan Treaties with the greatest Sagacity, and Plenipotentiaries negotiate the Articles with the ut∣most Skill and Dexterity, yet we know from Histo∣ry and Observation, that they never can be perpetual, and, most commonly, are not lasting. Princes, too frequently, seem to own no other Rule of Action, than present Convenience; and the Law of Nations is seldom appealed to, but to sanctify Injustice, and save Appearances. Nor are the positive Compacts solemnly agreed upon between Nation and Nation, better observed. For how seldom do we see a Treaty religiously adhered to, by the Parties whose Interest it is to break it, and who think they are in such Circumstances as to be able to break it with Impunity?—If such Infidelity be too common a∣mongst Princes in general, Experience, long Ex∣perience teaches us, that the Nation with whom we are soon to treat, excel us, at least, in this Part of Policy. For no Cord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are strong enough to bind them.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="008585_0011_102F8AFF20452778"/><HI>Gallic Faith</HI> is become proverbial, and the Neigh∣bours of <HI>France</HI> can reproach her with innumerable Instances of a most profligate Disregard to the most solemn Treaties. And the Reason seems to be ob∣vious, without supposing that Nation more perfi∣dious than others. The Power, the Populousness, the Extent, the Strength of the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy, free them from those Apprehensions which bind the weaker Side to be faithful to it's Engagements; and depending upon the Inability of their Neigh∣bours, considered singly, to procure to themselves Justice, this, too frequently, has tempted them to the most shameful and barefaced Instances of na∣tional Breach of Faith.</P>
<P>It well becomes us, therefore, at this Juncture, when the Distresses of the <HI>French,</HI> we may hope, will oblige them to consent to Terms of Peace, unfa∣vourable to the Interest, and disgraceful to the Glo∣ry of their Monarch, to take every Method in our Power to secure the Observance of those Con∣cessions they may make; and to insist upon their giving us such Proofs of their Sincerity, before any Negotiation be entered upon, as may give us some Assurance that they mean to be more faithful to their future Engagements.</P>
<P>What Proof of their Sincerity, I would recom∣mend it to you to demand, what Concessions it will be necessary to insist upon, I shall beg Leave to mention; after having first satisfied you by a De∣tail of some Particulars, that such Demands as I would propose cannot be looked upon as the Inso∣lence of a Conqueror, but as the wise Foresight of a People whom dear-bought Experience hath taught the proper Way of doing itself Justice.</P>
<P>It may not, therefore, be unnecessary to place before your Eyes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the most remarkable In∣stances of <HI>French</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ich have give Rise

<P>The Peace of <HI>Westph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lia</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1643.</NOTE>, while it secured the Liberties and Religion of <HI>Germany,</HI> also laid the Foundation of that Power which hath made <HI>France,</HI> ever since, the Terror of <HI>Europe.</HI> By this Treaty <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Article 73, &amp; seq.</NOTE>, the Upper and the Lower <HI>Alsace,</HI> a Country of great Extent, and of infinite Consequence in Point of Situation, was ceded to <HI>France.</HI> In this Country there were Ten <HI>Imperial Cities,</HI> whose Privileges and Liberties were in the most solemn Manner se∣cured by the same Treaty, which expressly says, <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Article 88. Le Roi de France ne s'arroger<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> les villes de la Prefecture, que le simple Droit de Protectio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> appartenoit à la Maison d'Au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>che.</NOTE> <HI>that they shall preserve their Freedom, and that the King of</HI> France <HI>shall not assume over them, any Thing more than the bare Right of Protection.</HI> How was this Article observed? The ten Imperial Cities have been humbled to receive the <HI>French</HI> Yoke, equally with the Rest of <HI>Alsace,</HI> and remain now, lasting Monuments, what others may expect from Power unrestrained by Justice.</P>
<P>The Treaty ‖ of the <HI>Pyrenees</HI> still enlarged the Boundaries of <HI>France,</HI> especially on the Side of <HI>Flan∣ders</HI>; and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> thought themselves safe from farther Losses, by the Marriage of their In∣fanta to <HI>Louis</HI> the XIV. who, upon that Occasion, jointly with her, made a formal Renunciation of all her Rights, to succeed to any Part of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Possessions. And yet, with unparalleled Insolence, seven Years had scarcely elapsed before <HI>Flanders</HI> was again attacked, on Pretence of those very Rights which had been so lately renounced, and which even tho' they had not been renounced, must have

appeared chimerical, unless a Sister can have a Right to succeed in Preference to her Brother.</P>
<P>The Peace of <HI>Nimeguen</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1679.</NOTE> restored the Tranquil∣ity of <HI>Europe,</HI> which the Invasion of <HI>Holland</HI> by the <HI>French</HI> had disturbed. But scarcely was the Peace signed before it was shamefully violated. The Decrees of the Chambers of Re-union, by which <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIV. seized so many Territories, to which he had not the least Right; the Surprisal of <HI>Strasburg,</HI> and the Blockade of <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> shew∣ed such a Wantonness of Perfidy, as no History of the most barbarous and unpolished Savages could well exceed; and justly drew upon the common Oppressor, the joint Vengeance of offended <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI></P>
<P>Who is ignorant of the Story of the <HI>Partition</HI> Treaty? Solemnly entered into to preserve that Tranquility which the Treaty of <HI>Reswick</HI> had just restored to <HI>Europe,</HI> it was no sooner made than it was shamefully abandoned by the Court of <HI>France</HI>; and for such Reasons as will, upon every Occasion, justify every Injustice. The <HI>Letter</HI> of the Treaty, indeed, was violated, they must own; —but the <HI>Spirit</HI> of it was what ought to be attend∣ed to. And by such a Comment, worthier of a pitiful Sophister, than of a most Christian King, his Grandson was assisted in placing himself on the Throne of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>The Politics of <HI>Lewis</HI> the XV. have been faith∣fully copied from those of his Great-Grandfather; and the Behaviour of <HI>France,</HI> upon the Death of <HI>Charles</HI> the VI. is a fresh Proof, of how little Use are the most solemn Treaties, with a Power that knows no Ties but those of Interest.—The Treaty of <HI>Vienna</HI> had but two or three Years before <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In 1738.</NOTE>, an∣nexed to the Crown <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, the Dutchy of <HI>Lor∣rain</HI>;

But how was the Engagement fulfilled? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will scarcely believe such bare-faced Per∣fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> possible, as our Times saw was actually a∣vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed upon that Occasion. <HI>Germany</HI> was instant∣ly, covered with the Armies of <HI>France,</HI> to as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> in an Attempt to overturn the <HI>Pragmatic Sanction</HI> so lately guaranteed by <HI>France</HI> and to dethorne that Princess whom the <HI>French</HI> were bound by a Treaty, sworn to in the Name of the Holy Trinity, to protect and defend from all her Enemies.</P>
<P>I have brought down this Sketch of <HI>French</HI> Faith to the present Times; imperfect indeed; but, as far as it goes, strictly conformable to Historical Truth.—What Confidence, then, can <HI>France</HI> ex∣pect any of its Neighbours will put in her, after so many and such flagrant Instances of national Per∣jury, as she appears to be guilty of?—The Ca∣talogue of her Infidelities will still be increased; and the little Reason that our Island, in particular, has to trust Her, will still be more apparent, by reminding you of some of the many Proofs, which <HI>Great Britain</HI> itself can appeal to, of <HI>French</HI> Inge∣nuity in Treaty-breaking.—I shall go no higher than the Peace of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> because the Instances in which it hath been violated by <HI>France,</HI> have produ∣ced the present War; and because the Enumera∣tion of them will lead me, naturally, to those Hints which I mean to throw out, as necessary to be at∣tended to, in our future Negotiations; and which, if neglected, will lose to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Nation all the Fruits

of those Successes, to gain which, we have strained every Nerve, and loaded ourselves with a Burthen under which it is a Miracle that we have not alrea∣dy sunk.</P>
<P>The War which was closed by the Peace of <HI>Utrecht</HI> had been undertaken with Views confined, altoge∣ther, to the Continent of <HI>Europe,</HI> and carried on, though at an immense Expence, more to gain Con∣quests for our Allies, than for ourselves. However, in the Treaty of Peace, some Advantages and Con∣cessions were stipulated in Favour of the Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and its commercial Interests.</P>
<P>By the 12th Article, <HI>All</HI> Nova Scotia <HI>or</HI> Acadia, <HI>with its ancient Limits, and with all its Dependencies, is ceded to the Crown of</HI> Great Britain.</P>
<P>And by the 15th Article, <HI>The Subjects of</HI> France <HI>Inhabitants of</HI> Canada, <HI>and elsewhere, shall not disturb or molest, in any Manner whatever, the</HI> Five Indian Nations <HI>which are subject to</HI> Great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Britain, <HI>nor its other</HI> American <HI>Allies.</HI></P>
<P>Let us now see how these Articles have been ob∣served. The <HI>French</HI> seem to have had two <HI>Capital Views</HI> in all their <HI>American</HI> Schemes, ever since they have thought Trade and Commerce an Object worthy of their Attention. The first was to ex∣tend themselves from <HI>Canada,</HI> Southwards, through the Lakes along the Back of our Colonies; by which Means they might answer a double Purpose, of cutting off our Communication with the <HI>Indian Nations,</HI> and of opening a Communication for themselves, between the Rivers <HI>St. Lawrence</HI> and <HI>Missisippi,</HI> and thus to join, as it were, their Colo∣nies of <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>Louisiana.</HI> The other Part of their Plan, equally important, and more immedi∣ately fatal to our Interests in <HI>North America,</HI> was to gain a Communication with the Ocean; the only
<PB N="14" REF="008585_0016_102F8B0C032D3798"/>
Access they now have to <HI>Canada,</HI> through the Ri∣ver <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> being shut up half the Year.</P>
<P>Full of this favorite Project of <HI>American</HI> Em∣pire, soon after the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> they began to enlarge their Boundaries on that Continent, in direct Violation of the solemn Concessions they had so lately made.</P>
<P>As long ago as 1720, they seized and fortified the most important Pass in <HI>America,</HI> at <HI>Niagara</HI>; in that very Country of the <HI>Five Indian Nations,</HI> from which the 15th Article of the Treaty of <HI>U∣trecht</HI> had excluded them. The infinite Conse∣quence of <HI>Niagara</HI> made them less scrupulous, no Doubt, about Treaties. For by Means of this U∣surpation they, in a Manner, became Masters of the Lakes, and could, at Leisure extend them∣selves to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> and carry their Chain of Forts and Settlements down to the <HI>Missisippi.</HI></P>
<P>The Plan of Usurpation on the Back of our Colonies went on gradually and successfully from Year to Year; the <HI>Indians</HI> owned by the Peace of <HI>Utrecht</HI> to be our Subjects, were debauched from our Interest, and spirited up to massacre, and scalp the <HI>English</HI>; and in 1731, the Insolence of the <HI>French</HI> grew to such an Heighth, that they erected their Fort at <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> in a Country indisput∣ably ours; whether considered as in the Center of the <HI>five Nations,</HI> or as actually within the Limits of <HI>New-York.</HI> And whoever casts his Eye upon the Situation of this Fort, in the Map, will see how greatly the Possession of it facilitated the Comple∣tion of the great Object of opening a Communica∣tion with the Ocean; and how much it exposed our most valuable Colonies to <HI>Indian</HI> Massacres and <HI>French</HI> Invasions.</P>
<P>If it should be asked, what was our Ministry in <HI>England</HI> employed about, during such Instances of
<PB N="15" REF="008585_0017_102F8B0F534428D0"/>
<HI>French</HI> Perfidy—the Answer must be, (tho' I wish I could draw a Veil over this Period) that our Af∣fairs were then conducted by a Minister who was awake, indeed, to every Scheme of Corruption; eager to buy a Borough, or to bribe a Member; but slow to every Measure of national Importance and Utility. His first, his only Object, was to preserve himself in Power; and as, in Prosecu∣tion of such interested and mercenary Views, he had actually engaged this Nation in an Alliance with <HI>France,</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> (to pull down the exorbi∣tant Power of our old and natural Ally) it was no Wonder that he heard unmoved, and suffered with Impunity, the <HI>French</HI> Usurpations in <HI>North-America.</HI></P>
<P>Let us next trace the <HI>French</HI> Infidelity with Re∣gard to <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> or <HI>Acadia.</HI> Tho' that Pro∣vince had been yielded to us at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> we had taken very few Steps to settle it effectually, till 1749, after the Peace of <HI>Aix-la-Chapelle.</HI> And then the <HI>French</HI> Court gave us a Specimen of <HI>Chi∣cane</HI> worthy indeed, of those whom no Treaty ever bound, in Opposition to their Convenience. They began to speak out, and to tell us, nay to insist upon it seriously in Memorials, that the Country ceded to us under the Name of <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> comprehended only the <HI>Peninsula,</HI> and did not extend beyond the <HI>Isthmus.</HI> Whereas the Charters of King <HI>James</HI> I. to Sir <HI>William Alexan∣der</HI>; and Sir <HI>William</HI>'s own Map, as old as the Charter, demonstrate that the <HI>ancient Limits</HI> of the Country so named included a vast Tract of Land, beyond the <HI>Peninsula,</HI> reaching along the Coast till it joined <HI>New England</HI>; and extending up the Country till it was bounded by the South Side of the River <HI>St. Lawrence.</HI> Of such an Extent of Country they had formed a Plan to rob us; hop∣ing, no Doubt, to find the same Supineness in the
<PB N="16" REF="008585_0018_102F8B12AEED32E8"/>
<HI>British</HI> Administration which had overlooked their former E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>croachments. With this View they de∣sired that Commissaries might meet to settle the Limits, promising not to act in <HI>America,</HI> till those Commissaries should agree, or the Conferences break up. But how was this Promise observed? While the Commissaries trifled away their Time at <HI>Paris,</HI> the Usurpations went on in <HI>America</HI>; Incursions were frequently made into the Peninsula of <HI>Aca∣dia,</HI> the Possession or which they did not pretend to dispute with us; Forts were built by them in several Places, and particularly a most important One to command the <HI>Isthmus</HI>; thus decid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng by the Sword, in Time of full Peace, that Contro∣versy which they themselves had agreed should be amicably adjusted by their Commissaries; and fur∣nishing a lasting Warning to us, that a Treaty which leaves Points of Consequence to be de∣termined by any After-Conferences, only serves to light up another War.</P>
<P>While the <HI>French</HI> Usurpations went on so inso∣lently in <HI>Nova Scotia</HI>; the Plan was carrying on with equal Perfidy on the Banks of the <HI>Ohio</HI>; a Country, the Inhabitants of which had been in Al∣liance with the <HI>English</HI> above an hundred Years ago; an Alliance frequently renewed; to which also we had a Claim as being a Conquest of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and from which, therefore, the <HI>French</HI> were excluded by the 15th Article of the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI> above recited. But what avail Treaties when Interest comes in Competition? The Possession of the <HI>Ohio</HI> was absolutely necessary, that the great Plan of connecting <HI>Canada</HI> with <HI>Louisiana</HI> might succeed: And, therefore, they began their Hostilities against us, in that Country very soon after the Peace of <HI>Aix-la-Chapelle</HI>; in∣sulted our Traders, plundered and made them Pri∣soners; erected Fortresses, and established Settle∣ments;
<PB N="17" REF="008585_0019_102F8B1575A6AE20"/>
and our Governor of <HI>Virginia</HI> having sent <HI>Washington,</HI> in 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3, to complain of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ese Hostili∣ties, he returned with an Answer from the <HI>French</HI> commanding Officer on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> which only shewed how much in earnest they were to main∣tain themselves in their new Usurpations.</P>
<P>From this Period we may look upon the War as begun. Our Governors in <HI>North-America</HI> had Orders from <HI>England,</HI> to oppose the <HI>French</HI> En∣croachments by Force of Arms; and, in 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4, <HI>Washington</HI> was sent again to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> with some Troops; but being defeated, by the superior Num∣bers of the Enemy, who had just before taken the <HI>English</HI> Fort, they made themselves Masters of this important Country.</P>
<P>No Doubt the <HI>French</HI> Ministers flattered them∣selves that <HI>England,</HI> inattentive to the Interests of its Colonies for so many Years before, and who, so lately, had submitted to a Disadvantageous Peace, would not have the Spirit to oppose Force to Force, and do itself Justice by other Weapons than the Complaints of Lord <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>marle,</HI> and the Memorials of Mr. <HI>Mildmay.</HI> But the Hour of Vengeance was, at last, come; the Interests of the Kingdom were attended to by those in Power; the infinite Importance of our <HI>American</HI> Colonies was understood, and a Resolution taken to have Re∣course to Arms. And thus <HI>England,</HI> which, for half a Century, had been wasting its Millions, and lavishing its Blood, to obtain a Barrier in <HI>Flanders,</HI> which those for whom we conquered it could not defend, or rather did not think it worth while to keep; began the present War, a War truly <HI>NA∣TIONAL.</HI></P>
<P>If there be Merit in this spirited Conduct of the <HI>British</HI> Administration, from the Peace of <HI>Aix-la-Chapelle,</HI> to the breaking out of the present War,

<P>The <HI>spirited</HI> Remonstrances of Lord <HI>Stair</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> on the Accession of <HI>George</HI> I. concerning this Infraction of the Peace, were the last Instances of Humiliation which <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. saw himself exposed to; and, perhaps, he would have found himself obliged to do us that Justice, by Neces∣sity, which the <HI>Regent,</HI> who soon after came into Power, willingly agreed to from Views of <HI>private Interest.</HI> Tho' the Peace of <HI>Utrecht</HI> had obliged the <HI>Spanish</HI> Branch of the <HI>Bourbon</HI> Family to re∣nounce their Right of Succession to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> who, by this Regu∣lation, saw only an Infant's Life between him and the Throne, knew well, that tho' the Renunciation had been solemnly sworn to, the Doctrine of its Invalidity, of its being an Act, void, <HI>ab initio,</HI> had been publickly avowed. <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> as appears by his <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the Report of the secret Committe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, P. 13.

<Q>The Renunciation desired would be null and invalid by the fundamental Laws of <HI>France</HI>; according to which Laws the most near Prince to the Crown is, of Ne∣cessity, the Heir thereto.—This Law is looked upon, as the Work of him who hath established all Monarchies, and we are persuaded in <HI>France</HI> that God only can abolish it.

frankly made no Scruple of telling the <HI>English</HI> be∣fore-hand, that this Expedient, which had been devised to prevent the Union of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> under one Monarch, would be of little Force, as being inconsistent with the fundamental Laws of <HI>France</HI>; by this Declaration giving us a very re∣markable Instance of the Weakness, or of the Wickedness of our then Ministers, who could build the Peace of <HI>Europe</HI> on so sandy a Foundation, and accept of Terms which <HI>France</HI> itself was honest enough to own were not to be kept.</P>
<P>However, the <HI>Regent</HI> was resolved to support his Claim to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> in Exclusion to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Branch; and, as the Support and Assistance of <HI>England</HI> was necessary for this Pur∣pose, it is not to be wondered at that he should court the Friendship of a Nation from whom he had so much to expect; and therefore, he was wise enough to do us Justice, by carrying into Execution, in some Degree, the Article relating to <HI>Dunkirk.</HI></P>
<P>The personal Interest of the Regent was the on∣ly Reason for this Compliance: But succeeding Administrations in <HI>France</HI> not being influenced by the same private Views to adhere to Treaties so∣lemnly ratified, <HI>Dunkirk</HI> began gradually to rise from its Ruins; its Port again received Ships; its Trade flourished; <HI>England</HI> saw itself deprived of this favourite Advantage gained at <HI>Utrecht</HI>; and such was the Ascendency of <HI>French</HI> Councils over those of this Island, at the Period I speak of, that we were actually engaged in Alliances with <HI>France,</HI> while that Nation was thus openly insult∣ing us, and insulting us, without Obstruction, in so essential an Article. We all remember what passed in Parliament in 1733, relating to the Point now before us.—Such was the tame Acquies∣cence of the <HI>British</HI> Administration, that <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> by this Time, stood upon our Custom-House Books as a Port▪ from whence great Imports were
<PB N="22" REF="008585_0024_102F8B20CEA3D168"/>
made; and when an Inquiry concerning this was proposed in the House of Commons by a great Parliament Man <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sir W. Wyndham.</NOTE> since dead, the then Minister hung his Head, in the House, for Shame. And who could have believed it possible, that the same Person who had been so ready to promote a Par∣liamentary Inquiry into this Violation of the Peace in 1713, should obstruct such an Inquiry, when he himself was in Power, though the Reasons for it had become much stronger? Who could see Him, without Indignation, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut his Eyes to the Re-esta∣blishment of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and obstruct the proposed Inquiry, by getting from Cardinal <HI>Fleury</HI> (who then governed <HI>France,</HI> and, I blush to say it, <HI>England</HI> too) a delusive, ministerial Letter, promising what he knew would not be performed;—and obtained, perhaps, only because the Cardinal was assured, that the Breach of the Promise would not be resented.</P>
<P>While <HI>England</HI> remained so averse to do itself Justice, no Wonder that <HI>France</HI> improved the Opportunity. At the Time when that <HI>Minister</HI> was obliged to retire from Power, the Re-establish∣ment of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was compleated. For, in a little more than a Year after <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Memorial is dated <HI>July</HI> 1, 1742.</NOTE>, we find a Memorial presented by Lord <HI>Stair</HI> to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> com∣plaining of this Violation of the Peace of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> and urging it as a Reason for their joining us against <HI>France.</HI> And as it was for the Honour of the new Administration, that they began with Measures so spirited and national, it is equally remarkable, that the same Person, who had threat∣ened <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. in his own Palace, for his Slow∣ness in demolishing <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> lived to be again employed by his Country at the Distance of near thirty Years, when the Restoration of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> be∣came an Object of national Resentment.</P>
<P>The two Nations had not, as yet, begun the late War, when we saw, in <HI>One</HI> Instance, both a
<PB N="23" REF="008585_0025_102F8B225CA21FB8"/>
Proof that <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was again a <HI>Port,</HI> and a Port which may be made Use of, to endanger the Safe∣ty of <HI>Britain.</HI> At the Time I now speak of <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 1743-4.</NOTE>, we beheld the Harbour of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> crowded with Transports to embark Count <HI>Saxe</HI> and the <HI>Preten∣der</HI> to invade us. And, if that Invasion had then taken Effect, from that very <HI>Port</HI> which was to be no <HI>Port</HI> (happily the Winds were contrary to the Fleet from <HI>Brest</HI>) the infinite Mischief which this Nation may suffer from its Re-establishment, would have been fatally experienced.</P>
<P>Though we have no great Reason to brag of the Treaty made at the Conclusion of the last War (which I am ashamed to call a Peace, as it settled nothing that was before in Doubt between the two Nations) the Peace of <HI>Utrecht</HI> concerning <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> was, nevertheless in its most essential Part, re∣stored to its full Force. I say, in its most <HI>Essen∣tial Part</HI>; because, though the 17th Article of the Treaty of <HI>Aix-la-Chapelle</HI> left <HI>Dunkirk</HI> in the State it then was, with Regard to its Fortifications to the Land; the same Article revived our Right, to the Demolition of its Port, by stipulating <HI>That ancient Treaties are to be observed in regard to the Port, and the Works on the Sea Side.</HI></P>
<P>Little or nothing was done between the Conclu∣sion of the Peace, and the breaking out of the pre∣sent War, towards carrying into Execution this fresh Promise. On the contrary, the enlarging of the Fortifications of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> is mentioned in his Majesty's Declaration of War, three Years ago, as one of the fresh Heads of Injury offered to <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> And whoever reflects upon the Transactions, since that Period, will see that <HI>Dunkirk</HI> is restored to its original Importance. Its Privateers have done infinite Mischief to our Trade; a Squadron of his Majesty's Navy, in vain blocked up its Har∣bour lately, to prevent the sailing of <HI>Thurot</HI>'s

Fleet: and, it is well known, that the long threatened Invasion of these Kindoms, which <HI>France,</HI> in Despair, certainly meditated, would have been attempted from this Place, if the De∣struction of their Ships of War by <HI>Hawke,</HI> had not taught them the Absurdity of invading us in their much celebrated <HI>flat bottom Boats,</HI> which, we may well suppose, will hardly be tried, when their Fleets, really formidable, have been destroyed in the Attempt.</P>
<P>The above Enumeration of <HI>French</HI> Infidelities, in general, and in particular their Behaviour to <HI>England</HI> with regard to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and with regard to <HI>North-America,</HI> so naturally points out the <HI>Expediency</HI> and <HI>Necessity</HI> of the Hints I shall now offer, that, in pro∣posing them, I may well hope not to have them ridi∣culed as the Reveries of a chimerical <HI>St. Pierre,</HI> but rather attended to, as the sober Dictates of Prudence, and of a Zeal not altogether devoid of Knowledge.</P>
<P>First, Then, <HI>my Lord and Sir,</HI> before you enter upon any New Treaty, or listen to any plausible Proposals whatever, insist that Justice may be done this Nation, with regard to former Treaties. Shew <HI>France</HI> the strong, the solemn Engagement she entered into at <HI>Utrecht</HI> to demolish <HI>Dunkirk</HI>; put her in Mind of the amazing Perfidy with which she, from Time to Time, eluded the Perfor∣mance of that Engagement; and demand <HI>imme∣diate</HI> Justice on that Article, as a preliminary Proof of her Sincerity in the ensuing Negotiation.</P>
<P>Be not deceived any longer in this Matter. The <HI>French</HI> will, no doubt, assure you that the Demo∣lition of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> shall be an Article in the New Treaty. But let them know, you are not to be <HI>so</HI> imposed upon. They wlll, to be sure, when this becomes a new Article, reckon it a new Conces∣sion on their Side, and expect something in return for it,—perhaps <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI> or some such Trifle, as they will call it. But tell them with the Firm∣ness of wise Conquerors, that the Demolition of
<PB N="25" REF="008585_0027_102F8B27CFD75FC8"/>
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> is what you are intitled to by Treaties made long ago, and violated; and that it shall not be so much as mentioned in the insuing Negotiation, but complied with before that Negotiation shall commence.</P>
<P>Or, admitting that no Concession should be re∣quired by <HI>France</HI> in the New Treaty, in Consider∣ation of a new Article to demolish <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> place to them, in the strongest Light, the unanswerable Reasons we have against putting any Confidence in them, that such an Article would be better executed, than that in the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI> has been.</P>
<P>If they refuse doing us this immediate Justice, previous to the Peace; ask them how they can ex∣pect that we should have any Reliance on their Sin∣cerity to fulfil the New Engagements they may enter into, when they afford us so strong, so glar∣ing an Instance of Infidelity, in an Article of such Consequence, made so many Years ago? Can you have any Dealings with a Power, who, if he refuses this, at the very Time he is treating, affords you such manifest Proof, that his Word is not to be re∣lied upon, and that you cannot trust to the Execu∣tion of any Promise ever so solemnly made?</P>
<P>Perhaps <HI>France</HI> may think it a Disgrace to them, to comply with any Thing previous to the Begin∣ning of a Negotiation. Tell them, that acting honourably, and doing what Justice requires, can never be disgraceful. But if it be a Disgrace, tell them, with the Spirit of honest Men, that we owe it them, for the greater Disgrace they put, not long ago, upon us, by requiring us to send two Peers of this Realm to remain in <HI>France</HI> as <HI>Hostages,</HI> till we surrendered <HI>Louisbourg</HI>; an Indignity which I cannot call to Mind without Pain, and which, I always thought, was submitted to without Neces∣sity.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="008585_0028_102F8B2A2F089E70"/>It is now our Turn to vindicate the Honour of our Nation; and as <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was put into our Pos∣session before the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> as a Pledge of the <HI>French</HI> Sincerity, and to continue in our Possession, till the Demolition should be completed; let some such Expedient be now agreed upon; with this Diffe∣rence only, that instead of <HI>five Months after the Peace,</HI> the Time fixed, for the Demolition, at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> let no Peace be signed, at present, till this Right acquired to us by former Treaties, and of which we have been so perfidiously robbed, be actually carried into full Execution.</P>
<P>However, if any insuperable Difficulties should attend the doing ourselves Justice, on this Head, before the Peace; if, for Instance, which perhaps may be the Case, it should be found that it cannot be complied with, unless we consent to a <HI>Cessation of Arms,</HI> during the Time of Negotiation; rather than give <HI>France</HI> that Opportunity of recovering from its Distresses, and of being protected from the Superiority of our Arms, before we have, finally, obliged them to accept of our own Terms of Peace (which was one Cause of the Ruin of our Negotiation at <HI>Utrecht</HI>) I would wave insisting upon the Demoli∣tion of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> before the Treaty, and think it sufficient to demand <HI>Hostages</HI> from them, as a Secu∣rity that it shall be faithfully complied with, within a limited Time after the Treaty shall be concluded. The <HI>Parisians</HI> had two <HI>English Milords</HI> to stare at, upon the last Peace; and I do not see why the Cu∣riosity of our <HI>Londoners</HI> should not be gratified, in the same Way; and Two <HI>Ducs</HI> and <HI>Pairs</HI> of <HI>France</HI> be sent as Hostages to <HI>England,</HI> till <HI>Dunkirk</HI> cease to be a Port.</P>
<P>I know well, that Political Opinions, concerning the Importance of any particular Object, are as frequently dictated by Whim and Fashion, as built
<PB N="27" REF="008585_0029_102F8B2CF391A900"/>
on solid Reason and Experience. Perhaps, some may think, that this is the Case, with Regard to the Necessity of demolishing <HI>Dunkirk.</HI> But, tho' it may not at present be so favourite an Obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct of National Politics, as it was in the Queen's Time; this has not b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n owing to any real Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Cir∣cumstances; but to another Cause, to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Disputes betw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n the two Nations, which have been the great Object of the present War, and scarcely permitted us, hitherto, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, in what other Instances, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>France</HI> must be checked at the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Peace.—But as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> ef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣able Event now approaches, we cannot forget, or forgive the Behaviour of our Enemies with Regard to <HI>Dunkirk</HI>; and it will be equally necessary for the <HI>Honour</HI> and for the <HI>Interest</HI> of this Nation to make no Peace, without obtaining full Satisfaction on this Head. It will be necessary for the <HI>Honour</HI> of the Nation to insist upon this, if it were only to shew to <HI>Europe</HI> in general, and to <HI>France</HI> in parti∣cular —That we have too much Spirit not to resent Injuries; and too much Wisdom not to take Care, when we have it happily in our Power, to prevent them for the future.—But the Demolition of <HI>Dun∣kirk,</HI> is also necessary, if we would take Care of <HI>the Interest</HI> of the Nation. Such hath been our Success, in destroying the Navy of <HI>France</HI>; and so unable doth that Kindom now appear, to carry on its ambitious Projects by Land, and to vie at the same Time, with <HI>England,</HI> for Dominion on the Sea; that we may reasonably suppose, there is an End of <HI>Brest</HI> and <HI>Toulon</HI> Squadrons, to face our Fleets; and a future War with <HI>England,</HI> will leave the <HI>French</HI> no other Way of distressing us by Sea, than to lie in watch for our Merchant Ships, with numberless Privateers. In such a piratical War, <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> if its Harbour be not now destroyed,
<PB N="28" REF="008585_0030_102F8B3019424730"/>
will, too late, be found to be of infinite Conse∣quence; and we shall fatally experience it again, what it was in the Queen's Time, and in the Lan∣guage of her Parliament, a <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t of Pyrac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, in∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssing the Ocean, and doing infini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hief to Trad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, P. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>For these Reasons, therefore, I am so <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-fashion∣ed</HI> to as expect that our Plenipotentiaries will have this Point properly stated to them in their Instruc∣tions, and that <HI>Del<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nda est Cart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age, Demolis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Dun∣kirk,</HI> will be a Preliminary Article in the ensuing Negotiation.</P>
<P>The War having begun, principally, with a View to do ourselves Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tice in <HI>North America,</HI> the Regulation of Matters, on that Continent, ought to be, and no Doubt, will be, the capital Article relating to <HI>England,</HI> in the coming Treaty. It will be necessary, therefore, to give you my Senti∣ments, on this Head; and while I do it, with all becoming Diffidence, I shall, at the same Time, support what I may offer, with Reasons appearing so strong to me, as may perhaps recommend it to your farther Consideration, though it should fail of producing Conviction.</P>
<P>Now it is with the greates<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pleasure, I would observe, that with Regard to <HI>North America,</HI> we have nothing to ask, at the Peace, which we have not already made ourselves Masters of, during the War. We have been blessed by Heaven, with a Success, in that Part of the World, scarcely to be paralleled in History.

Troops; and that steady Perseverance in our Mini∣sters, as hath not only recovered from the Enemy all his Usurpations, but <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bourg</HI> is an <HI>English</HI> Harbour; <HI>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ebec,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Canada,</HI> is al∣ready in our Possession; and the Rest of that Country will fall of Course. It is a Prospect still more agreeable; that by destroying the Naval Force of <HI>France</HI> our <HI>North American</HI> Conquests cannot be retaken; and the Principle I would now lay down, and which I would recommend it to you to adopt, <HI>is, not to give up any of them.</HI> And I shall now endeavour to prove to you, that such a Demand may be insisted upon, without giving the Enemy any Pretence for accusing us of Insolence to∣wards them▪ and cannot be omitted without giv∣ing the Nation just Reason to complain, that we have consented to a <HI>treacher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> and <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lusive</HI> Peace.</P>
<P>It cannot, surely, ever enter the Imagination of a <HI>British</HI> Administration, to make Peace, without, at least, keeping in our Possession, all those Places, where the <HI>French</HI> had settled themselves, in Viola∣tion of former Treaties, and from which we have, fortunately, driven them. Upon this Plan, then, we shall, at the Peace, be left in Poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion not only of the <HI>Peninsula</HI> of <HI>Acadia,</HI> but of all <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> according to its old Limits; the Bay of <HI>Fundi,</HI> and the River <HI>St. John.</HI>—The important Conquests of <HI>Crown Point</HI>▪ and <HI>Niagara,</HI> will not be relinquish∣ed; and <HI>Fort du Quesite,</HI> and the Country near the <HI>Ohio,</HI> will remain Ours.—They are already Ours; the <HI>French</HI> know they cannot get them back during the War, and they do not expect that we shall give them up at the <HI>Peace.</HI></P>
<P>But though Care should be taken to keep all those Places just mentioned; something more must be done, or our <HI>American</HI> Colonies will tell you, you
<PB N="30" REF="008585_0032_102F8B35E5882F50"/>
have done <HI>Nothing.</HI> In a Word, you must keep <HI>Canada,</HI> otherways you lay the Foundation of ano∣ther War.</P>
<P>The Necessity of this may be placed in so strik∣ing a View, as to silence the <HI>French</HI> Plenipotentia∣ries, and to convince all <HI>Europe,</HI> of the <HI>Justice</HI> of our Demand.</P>
<P>Ask the <HI>French,</HI> what Security they can give you, if we restore <HI>Canada</HI> to them, however re∣strained in its Boundaries, that they will not again begin to extend them at our Expence? If the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI> could not keep them from En∣croachments, what Reason can we have to suppose the future Treaty will be better observed? If the <HI>French</HI> are left at <HI>Montreal,</HI> and the <HI>three Rivers,</HI> can we be certain they will not again cross the <HI>Champlain Lake,</HI> and attack <HI>Crown-Point?</HI> If the North Side of the River <HI>St. Lawrence</HI> be still theirs, what is to in∣sure us against an Expedition to <HI>Niagara?</HI> Can we flatter ourselves, that a People, who in full Peace, erected those two Fortresses, in direct Violation of their Faith plighted at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> will be restrained by any future Treaty, from attempting, also in full Peace, to recover them? After having seen the <HI>French</HI> carrying on a regular Plan of Usurpation, in <HI>North America,</HI> for these Forty Years past, shall we be so weak as to believe that they will now lay it aside? No, depend upon it, if the <HI>French</HI> think it worth their while to ask back that Part of <HI>North America,</HI> which was their own, they mean to take a proper Opportunity, of <HI>Elbowing all our Colonies round about,</HI> and of resuming the same ambitious Views of Enlargment which the most sacred Ties of former Treaties could not restrain.</P>
<P>The Truth of the Matter is, they were tired of <HI>Canada.</HI> The Inclemency of the Climate, the difficult Access to it; and a Trade scarcely defray∣ing
<PB N="31" REF="008585_0033_102F8B3890CBA308"/>
the Expence of the Colony, would long ago have induced them to abandon it, if the Plan of extending its Boundaries, at the Expence of the <HI>English</HI>; and of opening its Communication with <HI>Louisiana</HI> and with the Ocean, had not made them persevere.—<HI>Canada</HI> itself is not worth their ask∣ing; and if they do desire to have it restored to them, it can only be with a View to repeat the same Injuries and Infidelities, to punish which, we en∣gaged in the present War. Unless, therefore, we be resolved, <HI>with our Eyes open,</HI> to expose our∣selves to a Repetition of former Encroachments; unless we would choose to be obliged to keep great Bodies of Troops, in <HI>America,</HI> in full Peace, at an immense Expence; we can never consent to leave the <HI>French</HI> any Footing in <HI>Canada.</HI> If we do not exclude them, <HI>absolutely</HI> and <HI>entirely</HI> from that Country; we shall soon find we have done Nothing. Let the Treaty be drawn ever so accurately; let the Boundaries between <HI>Canada</HI> and our Colonies be described ever so precisely, and regulated ever so much, in our Favour; what has happened al∣ready, ought to teach us what we may expect a∣gain; the future Treaty will be observed no bet∣ter than the former have been; Usurpation and Encroachment will gradually revive; and thus shall we have thrown away all our Successes; so many Millions will have been expended to no Purpose; and the Blood of so many Thousands of our brave Countrymen spilt, only to remind us, that though we knew how to conquer, we knew not how to im∣prove, perhaps, the only Opportunity we shall ever have, of putting it out of the Power of <HI>France</HI> to violate its Faith.</P>
<P>I take it for granted that, in the future Nego∣tiation, the Island of <HI>Cape Breton</HI> will follow the Fate of <HI>Quebec:</HI> I shall only observe with Regard
<PB N="32" REF="008585_0034_102F8B3BC8D9EE20"/>
to it, that though the Harbour and Fortification of <HI>Louisbourg</HI> be of infinite Service to <HI>France</HI>; it can be of little or no Use to <HI>England,</HI> if <HI>Canada</HI> be left to us. It is of Consequence to <HI>France,</HI> as a Retreat to their Ships fishing on the neighbour∣ing Banks of <HI>Newfoundland</HI>; and as a Security to the Entrance of the <HI>Gulph</HI> of <HI>St. Laurence.</HI> But the Possession of <HI>Newfoundland</HI> itself, makes <HI>Louisbourg</HI> of no Utility to the <HI>English,</HI> in the former Respect; and <HI>Halifax,</HI> where we have a good Harbour, an∣swers very nearly the latter Purpose. Upon this View therefore, may we not hope and expect, that, the Necessity of garrisoning <HI>Louisbourg</HI> having end∣ed with the Conquest of <HI>Quebec,</HI> its Fate will be de∣termined, without troubling the <HI>French</HI> Plenipoten∣tiaries? Without waiting for a Congress, let Orders be forthwith sent to demolish it, so as not to leave one Stone upon another, of the Fortifications; to remove the Inhabitants to <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> a better Country; and to leave the Island, a bare and bar∣ren Rock; the State it was in, before the Peace of <HI>Utrecht</HI> gave Leave to <HI>France</HI> to fortify it. If the Right given to the <HI>French</HI> by the 13th Article of the same Peace, to fish in some Parts of those Seas should be continued (and I could wish to see it continued, as the Refusal of it would be rather un∣reasonable) let <HI>Cape Breton</HI> unfortified, and ungar∣risoned be left open to them; and a few Men of War kept at <HI>Halifax,</HI> will effectually prevent <HI>Lou∣isbourg</HI>'s being again made a Place of Strength.</P>
<P>If you adopt this Measure, I should be inclined to think, <HI>France</HI> will see that you know your true Interests; and that you are resolved steadily to pur∣sue them. And if they should make any Remon∣strances against it, tell them they may follow <HI>our</HI> Example, and demolish, if they please, the Forti∣fications of <HI>Mahon</HI>; which we see them possess
<PB N="33" REF="008585_0035_102F8B3E46DB43A8"/>
with as great Indifference as we remember the Cir∣cumstances of its Loss, with Shame: Which, as being of no Use to them they will not desire to keep, and which, having been kept, by us, at an Ex∣pence, not counterbalanced by its Utility, we shall not be very sanguine about recovering. Or rather tell them, that in demolishing <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> before the Peace, we only copy a former Example given us by themselves, when their Troops were employ∣ed in dismantling the Frontier Towns in <HI>Fland<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs,</HI> at the very Time that their Plenipotentiaries at <HI>Aix la Chapelle</HI> were consenting to give them up.</P>
<P>The Plan which I have had the Honour of sketch∣ing out to you, besides being so reasonable in itself, is perfectly agreeable to that Moderation expressed by his Majesty in his Speech, of <HI>not having entered into the War with Views of Ambition.</HI> The Pos∣session of <HI>Canada,</HI> is no View of Ambition; it is the only Security the <HI>French</HI> can give us, for their future Regard to Treaties. We have made other Conquests, of great Importance, our Management of which will give us sufficient Means of shewing our Moderation. And though I shall not presume to give any Opinion about the future Disposal of them, I think, however, I may be allowed to hint, that "the Possession of <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI>" an additional Sugar Island, when we have so many of our own, ought not to be insisted upon so strenuously as to make it a necessary Condition of the Peace. And though "<HI>Senegal</HI> and <HI>Goree,</HI>" are of real Import∣ance in the Slave and Gum Trades, our own <HI>Afri∣can</HI> Settlements have hitherto supplied us with Slaves, sufficient for our <HI>American</HI> Purposes: And the Trade for Gum is, perhaps, not of Conse∣quence enough to make us Amends for the annual Mortality which we already lament, of our brave Countrymen to guard our <HI>African</HI> Conquests. The
<PB N="34" REF="008585_0036_102F8B3FDC23C028"/>
People of <HI>England,</HI> therefore, will not, I believe, blame the giving them back, for a valuable Consideration,—provided <HI>Canada</HI> be left to us.</P>
<P>To consider this Affair in its proper Light, it will be necessary to reflect on the infinite Conse∣quence of <HI>North America</HI> to this Country. Our Colonies there contain above a Million of Inhabi∣tants, who are mostly supplied with the Manufac∣tures of <HI>Great Britain</HI>; our Trade to them, by em∣ploying innumerable Ships, is one great Source of our maritime Strength; by supporting our Sugar Islands with their Provisions, and other Necessa∣ries, they pour in upon us all the Riches of the <HI>West Indies</HI>; we carry their Rice, and Tobacco, and Fish, to all the Markets of <HI>Europe</HI>; they pro∣duce Indigo, and Iron; and the whole Navy of <HI>England</HI> may be equipped, with the Products of <HI>English America.</HI> And if, notwithstanding our having lost several Branches of Commerce, we formerly enjoyed in <HI>Europe</HI> and to the <HI>Levant,</HI> we have still more Commerce than ever; a greater De∣mand for our Manufactures, and a vast Increase of our Shiping; what can this be owing to, but to the Trade to our own <HI>American</HI> Colonies; a Trade which the Successes of this War, will render, every Day, more and more advantageous? If this Matter, then, be considered, in the above Light, by those whom I now address, they will make our <HI>North American</HI> Conquests, the <HI>sine qua non</HI> of the Peace, as being the only Method of guarding our <HI>invaluable</HI> Possessions there, from Usurpations and Encroachments; and they will look upon every other Conquest, we have made, <HI>or may make,</HI> in other Parts of the World, as Instruments put into our Hands by Providence, to enable us to settle Affairs on the Continent of <HI>Europe,</HI> as advantage∣ously to our Allies, as <HI>our</HI> Gratitude could wish, and as <HI>their</HI> Fidelity doth deserve.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="008585_0037_102F8B428A8377A0"/>Here, then, let me change the Scene, and hav∣ing settled our Affairs in <HI>Canada</HI> (would to God they were so settled at the Peace!) permit me to fi∣nish my Plan of Negotiation, by giving my Senti∣ments on the Part we ought to act, to obtain a pro∣per Settlement of Affairs in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>If a great Number of Allies can make them∣selves formidable to a common Enemy, during the Operations of the War, they are apt to ruin every Advantage they may have gained, by quar∣relling amongst themselves, when they begin their Negotiations for Peace. Like an <HI>Opposition,</HI> in our Parliament carried on against an overgrown Minister, all Sorts of Parties and Connections, all Sorts of disagreeing and contradictory Interests, join against him, at first, as a common Enemy; and tolerable Unanimity is preserved amongst them, so long as the Fate of this Parliamentary War con∣tinues in Suspence. But when once they have dri∣ven him to the Wall, and think themselves sure of Victory; the Jealousies and Suspicions, which, while the Contest depended, had been stifled, break out; every one who shared in the Fatigue, expects to share in the Spoils; separate Interests counter∣act each other; separate Negotiations are set on Foot; till at last, by <HI>untimely</HI> and <HI>mercenary</HI> Divi∣sions, they lose the Fruits of their Victory, and the Object of the common Resentment is able to make Terms for himself <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The true History of the Transaction here alluded to, may, possibly some Time or other, appear; though, as yet, we are persuaded, the World knows very little of it.</NOTE>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his was exactly the Case in the Contest between <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. and the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> united against him, before the Peace of <HI>Utrecht</HI>; and the unhappy Divisions of the Allies (Divisions too likely to have sprung up,
<PB N="36" REF="008585_0038_102F8B44237C3698"/>
even tho' there had not been a Party in <HI>England,</HI> who to gratify their private Resentments, blew up the Coals of Dissention) gave the <HI>French</HI> the Means of procuring more favourable Terms of Peace, than they could well have hoped after so unsuccessful a War.</P>
<P>I have mentioned this with a View to observe, that the Circumstances of the present War on the Continent are very different; no such unfortunate Disunion seems possible to happen to us though it may happen amongst the Confederates who are en∣gaged on the same Side with <HI>France,</HI> against <HI>Hano∣ver</HI> and the King of <HI>Prussia.</HI></P>
<P>It may be collected from more than one Hint dropt in the Course of this Letter, that I am no Friend to <HI>Continental Measures</HI> in general; especi∣ally such continental Measures as engaged us dur∣ing the three last Wars, as Principals; when we seemed eager to ruin ourselves, in Support of that <HI>Austrian</HI> Family whom we now find, with unparal∣leled Ingratitude, and incredible Folly, in close Alliance with <HI>France.</HI>— But the <HI>Continental Mea∣sures</HI> now adopted by <HI>England</HI> were <HI>necessary,</HI> both with Regard to▪ Our Honour and our Interest. <HI>Hanover</HI> has been attacked by <HI>France,</HI> on a Quar∣rel entirely <HI>English</HI>; and tho' Care was taken, by the Act of Settlement, that <HI>England</HI> should not be involved in Wars on Account of <HI>Hanover</HI>; yet Gra∣titude, Honour, the Reputation of our Country, every Motive of Generosity, bound us, not to al∣low the innocent Electorate to be ruined for <HI>Eng∣land</HI>'s <HI>American</HI> Quarrel with <HI>France.</HI> In Regard to our Interest, no <HI>English</HI> Minister, however in∣flexible, in his Attachment to his native Country, could have devised the Means of making the best Use of our <HI>American</HI> Conquests, if the <HI>French</HI> could have treated with <HI>Hanover</HI> in their Hands. It was

with a View to prevent this, to oppose the <HI>French</HI> in their Projects in <HI>Germany,</HI> the Success of which would have been so detrimental to <HI>England,</HI> that we <HI>honestly</HI> and <HI>wisely</HI> have formed and have main∣tained the Army <HI>now</HI> commanded by Prince <HI>Fer∣dinand</HI>; and have entered into an Alliance with the King of <HI>Prussia.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' this was a Measure of Prudence, it was scarcely possible for the wisest Statesmen to foresee all those great Consequences which it hath already produced. The Efforts which the <HI>French</HI> have made in <HI>Germany,</HI> and the Resistance they have there met with by the Care of the <HI>British</HI> Administration; have contributed more than perhaps we could ex∣pect, to our Success in <HI>America,</HI> and other Parts of the World. Full of the Project of conquering <HI>Ha∣nover, France</HI> saw herself obliged to engage in ex∣orbitant Expences; Armies were to be paid, and maintained in <HI>Westphalia</HI> and on the <HI>Rhine</HI>; vast Sums were to be advanced to the Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> always as indigent as it is haughty; the ravenous <HI>Russians,</HI> and the degenerate <HI>Swedes,</HI> would not move, unless allured by Subsidies; and the Mouth of every hungry <HI>German</HI> Prince was to be stopt, with the <HI>Louis D'ors</HI> of <HI>France.</HI> Involved in Ex∣pences thus enormous, our Enemies have been pre∣vented from strengthening themselves at Sea, where <HI>England</HI> had most Reason to dread their becoming strong.</P>
<P>The infinite Advantages which this Nation hath reaped from the <HI>German</HI> War, are indeed now so so well understood, that we have seen the greatest E∣nemies of this <HI>Measure</HI> acknowledge their Mistake.</P>
<P>They now confess that if we had not resisted <HI>France,</HI> in her Projects of <HI>German</HI> Conquests, her best Troops had not been destroyed; her own Coasts would have been better protected; she would
<PB N="38" REF="008585_0040_102F8B4AD5EEBB18"/>
have been able to pay more Attention to her <HI>Ame∣rican</HI> Concerns; <HI>England</HI> might have been threat∣ened, so seriously, with Invasions, as to be a∣fraid of parting with those numerous Armies which have conquered at such a Distance from Home. In a Word, that universal Bankruptcy, which hath crowned the Distresses of <HI>France,</HI> and gives <HI>England</HI> greater Reason of Exultation, than any Event of the War, might have been prevent∣ed. It is entirely owing to the <HI>German</HI> Part of the War that <HI>France</HI> appears thus low in the political Scale of Strength and Riches; that she is found to be a sinking Monarchy, nay a Monarchy already sunk. And, perhaps, it might be an Inquiry worthy of another <HI>Montesquieu,</HI> to assign the <HI>Causes of the Rise and Fall</HI> of the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy; and to point out those silent Principles of Decay which have, in our Times, made so rapid a Progress, that <HI>France,</HI> in 1712, after upwards of twenty Years, almost constant War, maintained against all <HI>Europe,</HI> was still more respectable, and less exhaust∣ed than she now appears to be, when the <HI>single</HI> Arm of <HI>Great Britain</HI> is lifted up against her, and the War has lasted no more than three or four Years.</P>
<P>If this then be the State of the War, in <HI>Germany</HI>; if <HI>England</HI> be bound to take a Part in it, by every Motive of Honour or Interest; and if the infinite Advantages it hath already produced, be stated by me fairly—the Inference I would draw, and which, I believe, the whole Nation will also draw, is, that we should continue to exert those Endeavours which hitherto have been so effectual, in defeating the De∣signs of <HI>France</HI> to get Possession of <HI>Hanover.</HI></P>
<P>His Majesty, as Elector of <HI>Hanover,</HI> has no Views of Ambition: His <HI>Country has been attacked only because it belonged to the King</HI> of <HI>Great Britain:</HI> and nothing more is required of us, but to be true to ourselves, by neglecting no Step that may pre∣vent
<PB N="39" REF="008585_0041_102F8B4F9403BFB0"/>
<HI>Hanover</HI> from falling again into the Hands of <HI>France,</HI> after having been so miraculously rescued from the Contributions of the rapacious <HI>Richli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u,</HI> and saved from the <HI>Military Desert</HI> of <HI>Belleis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</HI>—I need not say any Thing of the Glory acquired by that Army, which notwithstanding it's great Inferiority, hath driven the <HI>French</HI> twice from the <HI>Weser</HI> to the <HI>Rhine.</HI> I shall only observe, that the next Cam∣paign (if another Campaign should preceed the Peace) will, in all Probability, lose us none of the Advantages we have gained, <HI>on that Side</HI>; if our Army, still headed by Prince <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> who has already gained so many Laurels, be rendered more formidable, as I hope it will, by sending to it <HI>some Thousands</HI> more of our national Troops; who now, since the Conquest of <HI>Canada,</HI> and the Defeat of the long threatened Invasion, have no other Scene of Action left, but to contribute to another Victory in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>It would be a very pleasing Prospect, if we could speak with equal Confidence, and Probability of Success, concerning the future Operations of the King of <HI>Prussia.</HI> However, when we reflect on the amazing Difficulties he has had to struggle with; attacked on every Side by a Number of Confederates, each of whom, singly, one would have thought, an equal Match for his whole Strength; bearing up, at the same Time, against the formidable Power of the House of <HI>Austria</HI>; the brutal Ferocity of the <HI>Russians</HI>; the Attacks of the <HI>Swedes</HI>; the Armies of the Empire; and, at one Time, having the ad∣ditional Weight of the <HI>French</HI> Arms upon him; when, I say, we reflect on the uncommon Difficul∣ties this magnanimous Prince has to resist, we must rather express our Wonder, and our Satisfaction that his Situation is still so respectable, than indulge
<PB N="40" REF="008585_0042_102F8B51376E98F8"/>
our Fears, that it is likely to be worse. The sever∣est Checks he has me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with during this War, have only served to shew how calm he possesses himself under Distress, and how ably he can extricate him∣self. The Hour of Adversity has called forth all his Abilities, and if he has failed some Times, from too great an Eagerness to conquer, he has always been able to retrieve his Affairs, and like <HI>Ant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us,</HI> gained fresh Strength from every Overthrow.</P>
<P>And, upon this Principle, I flatter myself, his <HI>Prussian</HI> Majesty will still be able to secure to himself the greater Part, if not the whole of <HI>Saxony</HI> for his Winter Quarters, and to recruit his Army, no Doubt much shatte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with its Losses and Fatigues, before the Opening of an∣other Campaign. It is to be hoped also, that besides the amazing Resources He has still left in his own unbounded Genius, and the generous and effectual Support which his Connection with <HI>England,</HI> affords him; the Power of the Confede∣racy against him may be broken, by disuniting the Confederates. History satisfies us how seldom a Con∣federacy of many Princes, has ever ruined a single Power attacked. I have give one Instance of this already, when I spoke of the Grand Alliance against <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. and the League of <HI>Cambray</HI> against the <HI>Venetians,</HI> in the 16th Century, is an Instance still more remarkable.</P>
<P>But, if contrary to our Hopes, our Wishes, our Endeavours, this should fail; if his <HI>Prussian</HI> Maje∣sty, like a Lion caught in the Toils (after a Re∣sistance already made, which will hand him down to Posterity as the greatest of Men) should at last be unable to defend himself; let him not despair while he is in Alliance with <HI>Britain:</HI> For I would inculcate a Doctrine, which I think will not be
<PB N="41" REF="008585_0043_102F8B52D32BC6A0"/>
unpopular amongst my Countrymen, and which, therefore, I hope, will not be opposed by our Mi∣nisters, <HI>That whatever Conquests we have made, and whatever Conquests we may still make, upon the</HI> French, <HI>except</HI> North America, <HI>which must be kept all our own; should be looked upon as given back to</HI> France <HI>for a most important Consideration, if it can be the Means of extricating the King of</HI> Prussia <HI>from any unforeseen Distresses.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps my Notions on this Subject may seem to border on Enthusiasm; but, however, I can∣not but be persuaded, that Things are come to that Pass in <HI>Germany,</HI> that the Ruin of the King of <HI>Prussia</HI> will be soon followed by the Ruin of the Protestant Religion in the Empire. The blind Zeal of the bigotted <HI>Austrian</HI> Family will have no Check, if the Head and Protector of the <HI>German</HI> Prote∣stants be destroyed; and the War begun only to wrest <HI>Silesia</HI> from him, will, in the End, be found to be a War that will overturn the Liberties and Religion of <HI>Germany.</HI> If, therefore, the noble Perseverance of the King of <HI>Prussia</HI> deserves the Esteem of a generous People; if his Fidelity to his Engagements, which has contributed to save <HI>Hanover</HI> and to ruin <HI>France,</HI> can demand our Gra∣titude; if the Danger of the only Protestant So∣vereign in <HI>Germany,</HI> able to preserve the Privileges of his Religion from being trampled under Foot, can call forth the warm Support of this Protestant Nation; may I not hope, may I not be confident, that our Ministers will dictate, and our People approve, of Terms of Peace in his Favour, though they should be purchased by relinquishing some of our Conquests; while the Possession of <HI>Canada</HI> will be so reasonable a Bound to the Demands we may make for ourselves?</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="008585_0044_102F8B5472AEF9C0"/>I have stated this Point upon a Supposition that the Event of the War may turn out to the Disadvantage of the King of <HI>Prussia.</HI> But if the Fortune, the Capacity, the Perseverance of that Great Prince should enable him (as I think we may still hope) to extricate himself from the Dan∣gers that surround him—it may be asked, What is to be done with the Conquests which, besides <HI>Canada,</HI> we shall be in Possession of when we treat of a Peace? — My Proposal is honest, and, per∣haps, will not be treated as chimerical: Employ them to recover, out of the Hands of <HI>France,</HI> those Towns of <HI>Flanders,</HI> gained for the <HI>Austrian</HI> Family by the Valour, and at the Expence of <HI>England</HI>; and which have been so perfidiously sacrificed. A <HI>British</HI> Administration must tremble at the Pros∣pect of seeing <HI>Newport</HI> and <HI>Ostend</HI> become <HI>French</HI> Property, and, therefore, should use their utmost Endeavours to prevent this at the Peace; though those Endeavours may serve the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> whose Ingratitude to <HI>Bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain</HI> never will be forgot∣ten; though, at the same Time, I must own we shall draw no small Advantage from it. We shall learn, for the future, to prefer our own Interest to that of others; to proportion our Expences on the Continent, to the immediate Exigencies of our own Country, and never to assist a <HI>new</HI> Ally, without remembering how much we did for <HI>our Old one,</HI> and what Return we have had!</P>
<P>I have, now, nearly executed my principal De∣sign, in the present Address; which was to give my Thoughts on the important Business of the ap∣proaching Treaty. And if it be conducted with as much Ability, as the War has been carried on with Spirit and Success, there is great Room for flattering ourselves, that the Voice of the Publick demands no Advantages or Cessions in Favour of
<PB N="43" REF="008585_0045_102F8B586955CD68"/>
<HI>England,</HI> which the Ministers of <HI>England</HI> are not resolved to insist upon.</P>
<P>But amidst the signal Successes of our Arms, which give us so reasonable an Expectation of an honourable Peace, and have exalted our Country to the highest Pinnacle of Glory and Reputation abroad—I wish it could be said that our <HI>Constitu∣tion</HI> was not greatly in Danger of being hurt, and al∣most lost, at <HI>Home.</HI>—I shall beg Leave to take this Occasion of touching this equally melancholy and im∣portant Subject; with a View, not to blame, but to lament; not to bring any railing Accusation against those who are now in Power, but to exhort and to excite them to endeavour, before it be too late, to add to the Services they have done their Country, in saving it from the open Attacks of <HI>France,</HI> the still more important Service of saving our Consti∣tution, which some unhappy Circumstances of our present Situation have already greatly changed, and seem to threaten with entire Destruction;—Nay, I may say, would have actually destroyed, if it were not for the good Heart of our gracious Sovereign, who scorns to take Advantage.</P>
<P>Considerably above an hundred Millions of Debt, the Sum we must be obliged to sit down with, at the End of the present War, is the Burthen which, however immense, Experience has taught us, con∣trary to all Theory, we shall be able to bear with∣out <HI>Bankruptcy.</HI> As our Expences have increased, we have found, contrary to the Predictions of gloomy Politicians, that our Abilities to bear them have increased also.—But tho' our Debts be not too great for the Riches of our Country, they are much too great for the Independency of its Consti∣tution. For, when I consider the infinite Depen∣dence upon the Crown, created by Means of Them, throughout the Kingdom, amongst all Degrees of
<PB N="44" REF="008585_0046_102F8B5C7948CF68"/>
Men; when I reflect on the many Thousands of Placemen, of every Denomination, who are em∣ployed in the Collection of the vast Variety of Taxes now levied on the Public; and take a Re∣view of a far greater Number of Servants of the Crown, both Civil and Military, for whose Sup∣port so considerable a Share of the public Revenue is set apart, too many of whom, I fear, might be tempted to assist in extending the Influence of the Prerogative to the Prejudice of public Liberty; when I consider our vast Load of Taxes, in this Point of View, I cannot help observing the amaz∣ing Revolution in our Government which this sin∣gle <HI>Article</HI> has brought about; nor enough lament the unhappy Circumstances of Affairs, and the Necessities of the War which have forced us to an annual Expence, unknown to former Times, and which will almost be incredible to Posterity. I believe I can venture to say upon Memory, that the Expences of the War, for all King <HI>William</HI>'s Reign, about 13 Years, were not, at a Medium, above 3 Millions and a half a Year; and Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s, tho' the last Years were exorbitant, were little more than 5 Millions. What they are <HI>now</HI> I sigh to think on. Twelve or fourteen Millions are demanded without Reserve; and, what is still more, voted without Opposition. Nay, of so lit∣tle▪ Consequence it is now thought, by our Repre∣sentatives, to deliberate on the weighty Business of raising Money on the Subject, that scarcely can <HI>Forty</HI> of them be got together, to hear the Esti∣mates for at least <HI>One hundred and fourscore Thousand</HI> Men, for so many have we now in our Pay; and to borrow <HI>Eight Millions,</HI> the Sum of which our Expences exceed our Income.</P>
<P>These are alarming Considerations; but another Object, no less threatning the Ruin of our Consti∣tution, also presents itself.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="008585_0047_102F8B5E1F2528E8"/>I am old enough to remember what Uneasiness and Jealousies disturbed the Minds of all true Pa∣triots, with regard to standing Armies, and mili∣tary Establishments. Principles of Liberty in ge∣neral, and, in particular, Whig Principles▪ excited this Uneasiness, and produced those Jealousies, which from Time to Time, have been a fruitful Source of Parliamentary Debate. It was no longer ago than the late King's Time, that the vesting <HI>Courts Martial,</HI> in Time of Peace, with the Power of pu∣nishing <HI>Mutiny</HI> and <HI>Desertion</HI> with <HI>Death,</HI> was car∣ried in the House of Commons by a small Majority<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In 1717-18 the Numbers on the Division were 247 to 229.</NOTE>. Nay, that a Court Martial, however limited in its Jurisdiction, was inconsistent with the Liberties of a free People, in Time of Peace, was the Doctrine of Whigs in those Days; it was the Doctrine, in par∣ticular, of Sir <HI>Robert Walpole</HI> then in Opposition; whose remarkable Expression, in this great Debate,
<Q>That they who gave the <HI>Power of Blood, gave Blood,</HI> never can be forgotten.</Q>
And though afterwards when he became to be a <HI>Minister,</HI> he was better reconciled to standing Armies and Mutiny Bills, in Time of Peace, <HI>seventeen</HI> Thousand Men, was all the Army he <HI>durst</HI> ask; yet even that Demand produced an <HI>annual</HI> Debate; and the <HI>annual</HI> Reason, on which he founded the Neces∣sity of his Demand—being the Danger from the Pretender and the Jacobites; was the strongest Proof, that even in Sir <HI>R. Walpole</HI>'s Opinion, the Reduction in the Army should take Place, when this Danger from Disaffection should cease. But how are Things changed?—I own indeed that a∣midst the Dangers of this War, and the Threats of an Invasion, the vast Army now on our Esta∣blishment;
<PB N="46" REF="008585_0048_102F8B5FB03E76C0"/>
is necessary: But what I lament is to see the Sentiments of the Nation so amazingly re∣conciled to the Prospect of having a far more nu∣merous Body of regular Troops, kept up, after the Peace, than any true Lover of his Country in former Times thought, could be allowed without endangering the Constitution. Nay, so unaccount∣ably fond are we become of the military Plan, that the Erection of Barracks, which, twenty Years ago, would have ruined any Minister who should have ventured to propose it, may be proposed safe∣ly by our Ministers now a-Days, and, upon Trial, be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound to be a favourite Measure with our Patriots, and with the Public in general.</P>
<P>But what I lament as the greatest Misfortune that can threaten the public Liberty, is to see the Eagerness with which our Nobility, born to be the Guardians of the Constitution against Prerogative, sollicit the Badge of <HI>military</HI> Subjection, not meerly to serve their Country, in Times of Danger, which would be commendable, but in Expectation to be continued <HI>Soldiers,</HI> when Tranquility shall be re∣stored, and to be under <HI>military Command,</HI> during Life. When I see this strange, but melancholy Infatuation, so prevalent, I almost despair of the Constitution. If it should go on in Proportion as it has of late, I fear the Time will, at last, come, when Independence on the Crown, will be exploded as unfashionable. Unless another Spirit possess our Nobility; unless they lay aside their Military Trap∣pings; and think that they can serve their Coun∣try more effectually as Senators than as Soldiers, what can we expect but to see, the System of mili∣tary Subordination extending itself throughout the Kingdom, universal Dependence upon Government influencing every Rank of Men, and the Spirit,
<PB N="47" REF="008585_0049_102F8B614D7BACE8"/>
nay, the very Form of the Constitution destroyed? We have generally beaten the <HI>French,</HI> and always been foolish enough to follow their Fashions; I was in Hopes we should never have taken the Fashion of <HI>French</HI> Government; but from our numerous Armies, and the military Turn of our Nobility, I am afraid we are running into it as fast as we can. And, unless something can be done, to bring back our Constitution to its first Principles, we shall find that we have triumphed, only to make ourselves as wretched as our Enemy; that our Conquests are but a poor Compensation for the Loss of our Liber∣ties; in a Word, that, like <HI>Wolfe,</HI> falling in the Arms of Victory, we are most gloriously—<HI>undone!</HI></P>
<P>But though I have drawn so melancholy a Pic∣ture, of the Dangers which threaten us with the Loss of our Liberties, it is with no other Design, than to exhort those who are placed at the Helm, to set about the Repairs of our shattered Vessel, as soon as she can be brought safe into Har∣bour. After the Peace is once settled, it ought to be the great Object of our Ministers, to devise every Expedient, and to adapt every Plan, that may extricate this unhappy Constitution from the Dangers I have described. Considering the low Ebb of <HI>France,</HI> we have some Reason to hope that when Peace is once restored, upon solid Terms, it will not soon be interrupted. Much, therefore, may be done during those Years of Tranquility; if our Ministers be diligent and faithful in this great Work of reviving the Constitution. The sacred and inviolable Application of the <HI>Sinking Fund,</HI> which the Increase of our Trade, and other Circumstances, have so greatly augmented, and must still augment, will operate gradually, and ef∣fectually. Universal and unvariable Oeconomy,
<PB N="48" REF="008585_0050_102F8B63AB960520"/>
must be introduced into every Branch of Govern∣ment; the Revenues of the Kingdom may be vastly increased by adopting Schemes that will pre∣vent Frauds, and lessen the Expence of Collec∣tion; innumerable unnecessary Places may be abo∣lished, and exorbitant Perquisites, in those we leave, may be restrained; Attention must be had to the Morals and Principles of the Nation, and the Revival of Virtue and of Religion will go Hand in Hand, with the Revival of Liberty. But no Object will deserve more Attention, than our Military En∣croachments on Constitutional Independence. When this War shall be over, there will be less Reason, than ever, for numerous Armies. The Kingdom now happily being united, and Disaffec∣tion to the Royal Family at an End, we need fear no Rebellions among ourselves; and Invasions from <HI>France</HI> are less likely than ever. Besides, by the Care and Perseverance of some Patriots, we have acquired a new internal Strength, a Militia trained up to be useful, and consequently, we may without any Danger to the Public, reduce the Number of our Guards and Garrisons, so low, as to destroy great Part of the huge Fabrick of Military Influ∣ence and Dependence. But whatever you do, if you mean to restore the Constitution, you must secure the Dignity and Independence of Parliament. After passing such Laws as may still be necessary to preserve the Freedom of Elections, from Influence of every Sort; to punish Bribery both in the <HI>Elec∣tors</HI> and in the <HI>Elected</HI>; something, perhaps, may still be done by Way of Place-bill, to lessen Mini∣sterial Influence over Parliaments, without having Recourse to an <HI>Oliverian</HI> Self-<HI>denying</HI> Ordinance; or to so total an Exclusion of Placemen, as was established, in the original Act of Settlement.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="008585_0051_102F742103C81808"/>And an House of Commons thus chosen, and thus made independent, now that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is rooted out, can never be formidable but to those who have Reason to tremble. Such an House of Commons, will co-operate with the Administration in every Plan of publick Utility, and at the same Time inquire carefully into the Abuses of Govern∣ment; Supplies will be voted; but only in Pro∣portion to the real Income and Abilities of the Na∣tion; and we may expect to see, what we have not seen above these forty Years, a Parliamentary Commission of Accounts erected to inquire into the Disbursement of near <HI>Two Hundred Millions.</HI> And unless we see this soon, I shall look upon our Con∣stitution, as lost, for ever.</P>
<P>These, and many such Regulations, as these, may, under an honest and virtuous Administration, be adopted when once Peace is restored: And the Prospect of seeing them adopted, and steadily pur∣sued, keeps me from despairing altogether of the <HI>Commonwealth.</HI></P>
<P>To you, therefore, whose Power, most likely, will not terminate with the War; and whom I have presumed to address with Regard to the Terms that should be demanded, to secure us from a perfidious Foe; To you, <HI>My Lord,</HI> and <HI>Sir,</HI> let me earnestly recommend, the still more impor∣tant Care, of saving us, from <HI>ourselves</HI>; and as you have with an Unanimity, that doth you both great Honour, directed our Councils, so as to humble <HI>France,</HI> let me intreat you to preserve your Union, till it re-invigorate the almost lost Powers of the <HI>British Constitution.</HI></P>
<P>If you have any Regard to Virtue, to Liberty, to your Country; if you would live great, and die lamented; if you would shine in History, with our <HI>Clarendons</HI> and <HI>Southhamptons</HI>; let not this Oppor∣tunity,
<PB N="50" REF="008585_0052_102F8ACA6FBC90D8"/>
perhaps, this last Opportunity of saving <HI>British</HI> Liberty, and Independence, be thrown a∣way. You, <HI>My Lord,</HI> whose Rank, whose exten∣sive Influence, and personal Authority, have given you the Pre-eminence, in public Affairs, as it were by Prescription; much will depend upon you, in the carrying on this important Work. But when I direct my Address to you, <HI>Sir,</HI> you must be con∣scious that besides the general Expectations we have from you, as a Lover of your Country, we have your own repeated Promises and Declarations, to make us flatter ourselves that you will not stop short, in your Schemes of national Reformation. Not tutored in the School of Corruption, but listed, from your earliest Years, under the Banner of Pa∣triotism; called into Power, by popular Approba∣tion, and still uniting, the uncommon Characters of <HI>Minister</HI> and <HI>Patriot</HI>; Favourite of the Publick, and Servant of the Crown; be not offended, <HI>Sir,</HI> if I remind you, not to disappoint that Confidence the Public places in your future Endeavours to prop the sinking Constitution. Nor let it ever fall from your Memory, that the Nation expects from your Virtue, your Oeconomy, your Plans for Li∣berty, during the future Peace, as great Advantages as we have already gained, from your Spirit, your bold Councils, and vigorous Efforts, in carrying on the present War.</P>
<P>Perhaps I grow too warm, on a favourite Sub∣ject; and, therefore, from Schemes which cannot take Effect, till the War be closed, let me turn your Attention again, for a little While longer, to the Object immediately before our Eyes—the in∣suing Conferences for Peace. And, with Regard to these, though I suppose, they will <HI>begin</HI> before the Winter be over, I think there is some Reason for being of Opinion that we must have another
<PB N="51" REF="008585_0053_102F8ACFB9623B38"/>
Campaign, before they can be finally closed. <HI>France</HI> is too low, to think seriously of a Peace, without making some desperate Effort. She never would have exposed her Weakness to all <HI>Europe,</HI> by so shameful and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umbling a Bankruptcy; She never would have ruined her public Credit, and melted her Plate, the last Resource, when every other has been exhausted, only to receive Terms from <HI>England.</HI> No, she knows she is un∣done, for ever, if she gets no Footing in <HI>Hanover</HI>; and, therefore, we may expect to see another At∣tempt made for that Purpose. But, if we are not wanting to ourselves, another Attempt, will end, as unfortunately for her, as the former have done; and her Ruin only be more confirmed. In the mean While, I make no Doubt, the Plenipotentiaries will meet at a Congress; but the Events of the Field, must regulate the Deliberations of the Cabinet. We, no Doubt, shall be <HI>firm</HI> in our Demands, <HI>whatever they are</HI>; and the <HI>French</HI> will endeavour to gain Time, to know whether there is any Likeli∣hood of obliging us to offer them <HI>better.</HI> In this Situation, then, <HI>France</HI> must hear with Terror, that without breaking our national Faith, without injuring private Property, without giving exorbi∣tant Premiums, we have already provided <HI>immensely</HI> for the Supplies of <HI>another</HI> Year (and Supplies for <HI>Years</HI> may still be had) to meet them;—not in <HI>Ame∣rica</HI>; there they are no more;—not on the <HI>Ocean</HI>— the Destruction of their Fleets leaves that Empire free to us—but once more, on the Plains of another <HI>Minden,</HI> again to feel and to confess the Superiority of <HI>British</HI> Valour.</P>
<P>I have only a Particular or two, to add, before I conclude. And I cannot help congratulating the Public, on the Wisdom of our Manner of Open∣ing the Negotiation for Peace. I mean to observe,
<PB N="52" REF="008585_0054_102F8AD279DCF530"/>
that our Ministers have happily got rid of a set of very <HI>useless,</HI> or very <HI>pernicious</HI> Gentlemen called <HI>Mediators,</HI> by applying directly to the Enemy him∣self. Nothing can be more ridiculous than the Fi∣gure of the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Nuncio, and the Ambassador of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rce of Mediation at <HI>Munster,</HI> for several Years, while the War went on, till its Eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s regulated the Terms of Peace. The Media∣tion of <HI>Insignificant</HI> Powers is therefore absurd; and the Danger of calling in a <HI>powerful</HI> Mediator, who may threaten to declare against you, if you do not submit to his <HI>partial</HI> Decisions, is too obvious to be insisted upon. You have done wisely, therefore, to keep the Negotiation in your own Hands; the Nation, from this Instance, has a full Confidence that her Interests are skilfully conducted; and, therefore, I shall only add, another Particular, which however subordinate, will, no Doubt, be at∣tended to by you; though <HI>some late</HI> Negotiators of ours, with <HI>France,</HI> neglected it.</P>
<P>The <HI>French,</HI> by taking the Lead in <HI>Europe</HI> of late, have, of Course, been able to introduce their Lan∣guage in all public Negotiations; so that, perhaps, the <HI>French</HI> is the only Tongue, by the Channel of which Plenipotentiaries and Ministers of different Countries, can converse. But when the Negotiation is to be put into Writing, to be drawn up in that Form which is to be binding upon all the Parties, and signed jointly by the treating Powers, neither the Honour, nor the Interest of the State, ought to allow us, to accept of the Original Treaty in the <HI>Native Tongue</HI> of our Enemies. The Honour of the Nation forbids this; as it would be a Con∣fession of Superiority, to which <HI>Britain,</HI> at no Time, much less after so glorious a War, should submit; especially as we cannot submit to it, without giving the Enemy a real Advantage, and laying the Foun∣dation

for future Cavils.—Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> in his Letters, boasts, that by a latent Ambiguity and Nicety in the <HI>French</HI> Stile, he had been able to out∣wit <HI>Don Louis de Haro,</HI> in the Conferences at the <HI>Pyren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es.</HI> And a much later Instance, in which we ourselves were partly concerned, should confirm us, in our Refusal to treat with the <HI>French</HI> in their own Language.—I mean the famous Capitulation of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Garrison of <HI>Tournay</HI> in 1745; which, though only restrained from acting, for a limited Time in any of the Barrier Towns <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I have not the original Capitulation before me, but I remember pretty exactly on what the Cavil turned. The Troops were not to act, I think, for two Years, in any of the Places <HI>le plus reculées de la Barriere.</HI> The <HI>Dutch,</HI> no Doubt, un∣derstood, <HI>de la Barriere</HI> to be the <HI>Genitive</HI> Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, but the <HI>French</HI> said they meant it in the <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lative.</HI></NOTE>, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> believed, when they accepted of the Capitulation, was soon after interpreted by <HI>France,</HI> as tying them up from acting in any Part of the World; and might have been fatal to this Country, if the Re∣bellion in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to assist in quelling which the <HI>Dutch</HI> lent us those very Troops, had been so suc∣cessful, as to oblige us, to put our foreign Allies to the Test.</P>
<P>We have no great Reason, no more than other Nations, to trust <HI>Gallic Faith,</HI> as appears from the many Instances of their <HI>unp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lliated</HI> Perfidy which I have collected above. Let us not, therefore, be so weak as to give them Room for obtruding upon us, any fallacious Interpretations of the Words, in which they plight their Faith. They are too ready to break it when the Terms are ever so clear; and, therefore, let us take Care not to give them that Advantage which superior Skill in their own Lan∣guage, naturally confers, and which upon some future Occasion, they may improve to our Detriment.

Let the <HI>original and authentic</HI> Copy of the Treaty, therefore, be in a dead Language, the Phrases of which cannot vary, and whose Meaning is equally understood by both Parties. We had once a very learned Plenipotentiary in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, who, in a Negotiation with <HI>Spain,</HI> when it came to be debated in what Language the Treaty should be made, ludicrously enough proposed to the <HI>Spa∣niard,</HI> who was giving himself Airs of Superiority, to treat in the Language of his Master's Kingdom of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> But, leaving the <HI>Hebrew</HI> for our Divines, I would only have our Negotiators treat in <HI>Latin:</HI> Which seemed, as it were by Prescrip∣tion, to have a Right to be the Language of the Public Law of <HI>Europe</HI>; till some late▪ Instances have shewn that the <HI>French</HI> was beginning to be substituted in its Room; by the Laziness or Ne∣glect of those who treated. As we are sanguine in our Hopes of a much better Peace than we had at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> with Regard to the Terms, let it not be worse than that at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> which preserved the Old Custom of settling the Negotiation in <HI>Latin.</HI> We then had a Bishop indeed, as Plenipotentiary; but without having Recourse to the very learned Bench, or choosing a Plenipotentiary from <HI>Cambridge</HI> (I hope in a little Time one may join the other U∣niversity without giving Offence) the Negotiators at the ensuing Peace, may be accommodated with <HI>Latin</HI> enough for the Purpose I mention, at a very moderate Expence—If their Secretary or Chaplain cannot assist them.</P>
<P>But when I begin to be ludicrous on so serious a Subject, it is Time to have done: And my Ad∣dress has already swelled to such a Size as surprizes myself, as much, as I fear it will tire the Reader. However, the vast Variety of Facts and Particulars which naturally offered themselves to me, and which
<PB N="55" REF="008585_0057_102F8AD97B1F3160"/>
could not be omitted without hurting the Con∣nection, and weakning my Argument, will, per∣haps, procure Indulgence for so long a Pamphlet: And, for the same Reason, I flatter myself, that if I should happen to have been mistaken in any Thing I advance, to have erred in a Date, or to have misquoted a Treaty, some Allowances will be made to me, as I have been obliged to trust much to my Memory, for Want of a proper Opportuni∣ty of consulting many of those Books, which fur∣nish the Materials I have made use of. However, I believe a candid Reader will find no <HI>capital,</HI> at least, no <HI>wilful,</HI> Mistake.</P>
<P>I am far from the Vanity of thinking that my Notions on the important Subject of the Peace, are a regular Plan or System for the Administra∣tion to proceed upon. I throw them out, only as loose Hints for my <HI>Superiors,</HI> to improve as they may think proper. Should there be any Weight in all, or any of them, you, <HI>My Lord</HI> and <HI>Sir,</HI> will be able to work them into Utility for this Kingdom. If they are not worth your Notice; as I am an anonymous Writer, and hope never to be known, I can neither loose nor gain Reputation by them. All I can say, if they are neglected, is, <HI>Operam et Oleam perdidi.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Short <HI>SPEECH</HI> and <HI>CHARACTER</HI> of Mr. <HI>PITT,</HI> extracted from <HI>Smollett</HI>'s History.</HEAD>
<P>IN 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>40 a very hot Contest arose, in Parliament, from a Bill relating to the Impress of Seamen. Mr. H. WAL<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>OLE thought proper to attack Mr. PITT with some personal Sarcasms. He reflected upon his Youth; and observed that the Discovery of Truth was very little promoted by pompous Diction and theatrical Emotion, These Insinuations exposed him to a severe Reply. Mr. PITT, standing up again, said
<Q>He would not undertake to determine whether Youth could be justly imputed to any Man as a Re∣proach: But he affirmed, that the Wretch, who, after having seen the Consequences of repeated Errors, continues still to blunder, and whose Age has only added Obstinacy to Stupidity, is surely the Object of either Abhorrence or Contempt, and deserves not that his grey Head should secure him from Insults. Much more is he to be abhorred▪ who, as he has advanced in Age, has receded from Virtue, and be∣comes more wicked with less Temptation; who pro∣stitutes himself for Money which he cannot enjoy; and spends the Remains of his Life in the Ruin of his Country.</Q></P>
<P>WILLIAM PITT, Esq. had been originally designed for the Army, in which he act∣ually bore a Commission; but Fate reserved him for a more important Station. In Point of For∣tune he was barely qualified to be elected Member of Parliament, when he obtained a Seat in the House of Commons, where he soon outshone all his Compatriots. He displayed a surprizing Extent and Precision of political Knowledge, and irresisti∣ble Energy of Argument, and such Power of Elocution, as struck his Hearers with Astonishment and Admiration: It flashed, like the Ligh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning of Heaven, against the Ministers and Sons of Cor∣ruption, blasting where it smote, and withering the Nerves of Opposition. But his more substantial Praise was founded upon his disinterested Integrity, his incorruptible Heart, his unconquerable Spirit of Independence, and his invariable Attachment to the Interest and Liberty of his Country.</P>
