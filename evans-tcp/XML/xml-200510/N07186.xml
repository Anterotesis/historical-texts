<HEAD>JOURNAL of the Siege of the <HI>Havannah,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1762. <HI>June</HI> 6<HI>th.</HI></NOTE>AFTER a very fortunate passage thro' the old Straits of Bahama, the fleet arrived within sight of two small forts to the Eastward of the Havannah, situated upon two rivers about three miles distant from each other. The whole fleet brought to, &amp; Sir George Pocock, with 12 sail of the line, some fri∣gates, and all the store ships, bore away for the mouth of the harbour, to block up the Spanish Men of War that were there and to make a feint on the other side, in order to facilitate our landing on this. Commodore Kep∣pel, with several sail of the line, and several small frigates, was ordered to remain with the transports, to protect and conduct the debarkation of the troops, which was deferred 'till day. There was too much wind, and too great a surf from the shore to effect it at that time.</P>
<P N="7">7<HI>th.</HI> By break of day this morning, the army landed without opposition between the two forts Bacarans and Coxemar. The one was silenced, and taken possession of by the Mercury and another frigate; the other was taken by the Dragon, of 74 guns. They were defended by a considerable number of peasants and negroes in arms, who very soon abandoned them, and fled into the woods. The Earl of Albemarle, with the light infantry and grenadiers of the army, passed the river Coxemar, where his lordship took his quarters that night. The rest of the army lay upon their arms along the shore, with the picquets advanc∣ed into the woods.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="4" REF="009165_0003_1030FD175B38FE80"/>8<HI>th.</HI> Lord Albemarle marched the main body of the army early in the morning to a village called Guanamacoa, about 6 miles from the landing place, and sent Colonel Carleton through the Coxemar wood, with a finall corps of troops, to the same village, to endeavour to cut off the re∣treat of a corps of the enemy, said to be assembled there, and which his lordship determined to attack. The enemy were drawn up to receive us, and very advantageously post∣ed upon a rising ground between us and the village. Their cavalry marched down in a large body to the light infant∣ry who were upon the right of Col. Carleton's corps. They were very soon repulsed, and the whole body dis∣persed-before the army got up. They were about 6000 in number, chiefly militia mounted, with the regiments of Edinburgh dragoons, two companies of grenadiers, and many Spanish officers. This morning Col. Howe, with two battalions of grenadiers, was sent thro' the woods to the Moro, to reconnoitre, and secure the communication to that fort from the Coxemar.</P>
<P N="9">9<HI>th.</HI> Lord Albemarle marched the army from Guana∣macoa, and encamped in the woods between the Coxemar and the Moro, leaving a corps at Guanamacoa, under the command of Lieut. General Elliot, to secure the avenues on that side, and a large tract of country, which could sup∣ply the army with water, cattle, and vegetables. We now discovered the enemy dismantling their ships in the har∣bour, at the entrance of which they had laid a boom.</P>
<P N="10">10<HI>th.</HI> The Moro hill, called the Cavanno<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, where the enemy were said to have a post well fortified, was recon∣noitred: and in the evening Col. Carleton, with the light infantry and grenadiers from Coxemar, went and invested that hill and the Moro fort.</P>
<P N="11">11<HI>th.</HI> Col. Carleton attacked the redoubt about one o' Clock in the afternoon, and carried it with very little loss, and little resistance on the side of the enemy. Here was a post established, and the work called by the name of the Spanish redoubt.</P>
<P N="12">12<HI>th.</HI> The Moro fort was further reconnoitered by his lordship's order. It was difficult to reconnoitre it with
<PB N="5" REF="009165_0004_1030FD1930ACFBB8"/>
much accuracy, it being surrounded with thick brushy woods, which could not be seen through, and we<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> mostly impossible. It was observed the parapet was thin, and all of masonry, and it was threfore judged adviseable to erect a battery against it, as near as the cover of the woods would admit of; there was accordingly a plan fixed upon, at a∣bout 250 yards distance, and preparations were accordingly made, and parties ordered out for fascines, and collecting earth, which was a work of great labour, the soil being ex∣ceedingly thin and scarce. The landing of the stores was, at the same time, carried on with great dilligence by the fleet.</P>
<P N="13">13<HI>th.</HI> The battery mentioned yesterday was begun, as also a howitzer battery beyond the Spanish redoubt, to re∣move the shipping further off up the river. They threw a great deal of random fire into the woods, and annoyed us very much. Col. Howe, with 300 light infantry, and two battalions of grenadiers, was detached to land at Cho∣rera, about 7 miles to the Westward of the town, to secure a footing, and engage some part of the enemy's attention upon that side.</P>
<P N="19">19<HI>th.</HI> There was a mortar battery begun upon the right near the sea, for one 13 inch, and fourteen royal mortars.</P>
<P N="20">20<HI>th.</HI> Parallels put in the woods to the right and left battery, and a fascine line begun, to secure the guards from the enemy's fire.</P>
<P N="23">23<HI>d.</HI> Another battery made upon the beach, to advance the royals in the battery on the 19th, nearer the fort.</P>
<P N="24">24<HI>th.</HI> A battery for two howitzers begun near the lime kiln; likewise against the shipping, to remove them fur∣ther up the harbour, which had its effect.</P>
<P N="25">25<HI>th.</HI> A battery for a 13 inch mortar begun near the lime kiln, against the shipping.</P>
<P N="26">26<HI>th.</HI> A battery begun against the fort for four guns and two mortars, upon the left of the first battery.</P>
<P N="29">29<HI>th.</HI> The enemy, at day break, landed two detach∣ments of 500 men each, of grenadiers and chosen men, with a detachment of armed Negroes and Mulattoes, with each corps, one upon the right under the Moro, the other
<PB N="6" REF="009165_0005_1030FD1C61012478"/>
upon the left of the lime kiln. The picquets and advanc∣ed posts, prevented the success of these detachments, by repulsing them, killing, and taking near 200, besides wounding a great number of them, who mostly got of by the favour of the woods. Our loss was only ten men killed and wounded.</P>
<P N="30">30<HI>th.</HI> This day was chiefly taken up in carrying ammu∣nition and carriages to the several batteries to provide for their opening next morning, which was done by the sold∣iers and 500 Blacks purchased by Lord Albemarle, at Martineco and Antigua, for that purpose.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 1. This morning we opened two batteries of can∣non, which, with our mortars, made up a fire as follows, viz.

<P>The enemy's fire exceded ours upon the front at∣tacked, in the number of guns, which amounted to 16 or 17 from 6 to 12 pounders. They played one mor∣tar of 8 inches, and that very seldom. Upon the whole, we reckoned our fire superior to theirs considerably, be∣sides the difference of the security of our works, theirs being only a parapet of thin masonry.</P>
<P>About ten o'clock the Cambridge of 80 guns, the Dra∣gon of 74, and the Marlborough of 66 went in and lay against the fort; the Cambridge lay within grape shot. They continued firing for above three hours, which the fort received and returned with great steadiness: At length the ships were ordered off. The Cambridge and Dragon suffered much, particularly the former. The attacked front of the fort did not seem to suffer much from their fire, it was so much above them; but they
<PB N="7" REF="009165_0006_1030FD1DEC0349C8"/>
still did us a consideaable service in taking up the enemy's attention for that time, which gained us a superiority in the number of guns.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d.</HI> Our batteries continued their fire with great suc∣cess, and beat down the front attacked, as fast as could be wished or expected, particularly the eight gun bat∣tery; but unhappily about noon, we were obliged to slacken, that battery being in danger of catching fire, from the constant fire kept up, and the dryness of the fascines, having had no rain for 14 days; however, be∣fore the evening, the enemy's fire was reduced to two guns, which fired but seldom.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>d.</HI> We flattered ourselves the fire was quite out, but about two in the morning it broke out again with great violence. Both water and people were sent as fast as pos∣sible, but unhappily too late; the fire had insinuated itself where water could not reach it, nor earth stifle it. Thus 17 Days labour of 5 or 600 Men, and which must have let us into the fort in a few days, was now baffled, and to do over again. There was another embrazure added this night to William's battery.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>th</HI> and 5<HI>th.</HI> These two nights our endeavours still continued to extinguish, and with much difficulty, there were two embrazures saved upon the right, and the e∣paulment for mortars upon the left. The fire of these two embrazures was continued until the guns was disa∣bled, and two mortars served en barbette, until the enemy's fire obliged the men to give it up. It was now determined to convert the mortar battery, in the left parallel, into a battery for cannon, which according∣ly begun, with some improvements to the other works, which the enemy's fire from the town, Fort la Punta, ships of war, and floating batteries, had render'd necessary.</P>
<P N="6">6<HI>th.</HI> Two more embrazures were added this night to Williams's battery, and a place fixed upon near the stone redoubt for another battery of four guns.</P>
<P N="9">9<HI>th.</HI> This morning we had 12 guns in battery, viz. Williams's battery of seven guns, and the left parallel of five guns, besides our mortars. The enemy fired with about eight or nine.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="8" REF="009165_0007_1030FD1F77846700"/>10<HI>th.</HI> At night a battery of four guns begun in the right parallel.</P>
<P N="11">11<HI>th.</HI> This morning the four gun battery, near the stone redoubt, and two guns upon the saved part of the grand battery newly repaired, opened and played with success. We now had 18 guns in play to 8 or 9, which the enemy still kept up; for, by their uninterrupted communication with the town, and the great assistance of their sailors, who serve their guns, they always made the losses of the day good at night. This afternoon two guns in the left parallel battery failed, one by running, the other by cracking; the carriages of a third was disabled upon Williams's battery. In the after∣noon the merlons of the grand battery again caught fire, and extended from right to left, and the whole was ir∣reparably consumed.</P>
<P N="12">12<HI>th.</HI> The disabled guns in the left parallel, and in Williams's battery were replaced last night, so that we still had 16 guns in play: Towards noon the carriages of the three guns in the stone redoubt battery were disabled.</P>
<P N="13">13<HI>th.</HI> This morning there was a battery of four 32 pounders opened on the right parallel against the left bas∣tion, and made considerable havock. There was ano∣ther battery of four guns ordered to be made upon the right of it as soon as materials can be collected. The ruins of the burnt battery was ordered to be converted into a line for musquetry at the same time. There were two guns remounted in the night upon the bat∣tery near the stone redoubt, but there were two more dismounted immediately afterwards.</P>
<P N="14">14<HI>th.</HI> The four guns in the stone redoubt battery were last night mounted on sea-carriages: We now had 20 guns mounted against five or six, which the enemy began with in the morning: They were reduced to two before dark. The whole front attacked appeared in a most ruinous condition, yet the enemy, tho' kept in a constant hurry and confusion, behaved with spirit.</P>
<P>Preparations for carrying on approaches had now been in hand some days. The 40th regiment was employed
<PB N="9" REF="009165_0008_10303239AF48EB60"/>
in making gabions, and several men of war in making junk, blinds, or mantelets, and some bales of cotton pur∣chased to serve as wool-packs. As our approaches must be entirely raised above ground on account of rocks, these precautions were necessary.</P>
<P N="15">15<HI>th.</HI> We played with the same number of guns as yesterday. The enemy fired in the morning with 6 or 7 guns, but were totally silenced before night.</P>
<P N="16">16<HI>th.</HI> Our fire as yesterday. The enemy fired in the morning with two guns, and only twice with each. They fired the rest of the day with musquetry and wall-pieces, but not much with either. This evening the ma∣terials for the approaches began to be advanced. The guns and ammunition are carrying up for the new bat∣tery, which is to open to-morrow morning. The ene∣my seemed to be employed in making up fresh merlons upon the face of the right bastion.</P>
<P N="17">17<HI>th.</HI> The Valiant's battery opened this morning be∣tween 10 and 11; the enemy had no fire on the front attacked, but fired two guns from the left face of the left Bastion upon Williams's battery, and up along the Ca∣vannos. This afternoon we began to stuff Gabions with Fascines for advancing our Sap. In the evening our Sap was begun, but there being a thick thorny wood to cut through, was advanced but a little way.</P>
<P N="18">18<HI>th.</HI> The enemy's fire this morning was the same as yesterday. We had two howitzers put in Dixon's bat∣tery to fire into the breaches; the Sap was carried on this night about two thirds of the way to the small bat∣tery at the foot of the Sorties before the right Bastion. There was likewise a small lodgement made at the edge of the wood, before the point of the west Bastion.</P>
<P N="19">19<HI>th.</HI> The enemy fired this morning with three guns from the front attacked, but they were soon silenced. About noon we took possession of the covered way, be∣fore the point of the right Bastion, and the former Sap carried on at night, and another begun along the cover∣ed way before the right face, where we made a lodgment.</P>
<P N="20">20<HI>th.</HI> This morning the miners were entered under
<PB N="10" REF="009165_0009_1030FD21581859A8"/>
the right or sea face of the right Bastion, the only place Where there was a practicability of doing it, at the foot of the wall, for the ditch of the front attacked is 70 feet deep from the edge of the Counterscarp, and upwards of 40 feet, of that depth, sunk in the Rock, but fortunately there was a thin ridge of the Rock left at the point of the Bastion, to cover the extremity of the ditch from being open to the sea, and to prevent surprizes, and by means of this ridge the miner past, with some difficulty, to the foot of the wall, which he could do no where else without the help of Scaling Ladders, an operation which would be both tedious and dangerous. This ridge was so narrow that there was no possibility of covering a pas∣sage upon it, from the fire of the opposite flank, but we took our chance, and were glad to find it, even with that disadvantage. It cost us but only three or four men during the whole time. We began the same after∣noon to sink a Shaft without the covered way, for mines to throw the Counterscarp into the ditch to fill it up in case of occasion. We continued our Sap along the Glacis, and got a gun into the Saliant Angle of the co∣vered way against the opposite flank. In the day-time we had parties for making Fascines and other preparati∣ons against the town, after the Moro should be taken.</P>
<P N="21">21<HI>st.</HI> Our Sappers and Miners continued to carry on their work; in this they were much retarded, by meeting often with very large stones, which cost them much labour to remove. In the night there being a suspicion that there were very few men in the Fort, there was a Serjeant and 12 men that scaled the sea line a little to the right of the mine, and found only about nine or ten men asleep in that part of the work: they wakened before our men got to them, and ran off immediately to alarm the rest: the Ser∣jeant and his party then came down, and being ordered up a second time, found they had taken the alarm, and a con∣siderable number assembled, and ready to make an opposi∣tion. Had it been practicable to succour them briskly, the Fort might have been carried at that time, but the attempt was not to be repeated.</P>
<P N="22"><PB N="11" REF="009165_0010_1030FD27D72C01C0"/>22<HI>d.</HI> About four this morning there was a sally made by the enemy from the town, which, by the information or prisoners, amounted to 1500 men, divided into three different parties; one pushed up the bank behind the Shephard's battery; they were stopped for near an hour, by the guard posted there, consisting only of about 30 men, commanded by Lieut. Col. Stuart, of the 90th regiment, until he was joined by about 100 sappers, and the 3d batt. of Royal Americans; the fire continued hot all the time; the enemy were then driven down the Bank with great slaughter; as many as could, got in their boats, and many leapt into the water, where there were 150 drowned. Another party endeavoured to push up by the saliant an∣gle of the Moro to attack our Sappers upon the Glacis, and their Covering Party, but they were beat off in a very short time; the third party went up the Bank of the Spa∣nish Redoubt, but finding our people ready to receive them, they returned very peaceably from whence they came. The alarm was entirely over, and our people re∣turned to their work by eight o'clock. The enemy's loss was said to be near 400 men killed, drowned and taken; besides the wounded that got off. We had about 50 men killed and wounded. The enemy canonaded up most vi∣olently, when their troops were beat down the bank, from the Punta, West Bastion, and from the lines and flanks of the entrance, and from their shipping; they even killed some of their own men, so eager were they to kill us. At the same time that their troops wete attacking, we saw they had great numbers paraded in the town, and some of them going into boats to sustain the attack; but when they perceived the rough treatment their comrades had met with, they prudently dropt the attempt.</P>
<P N="23">23<HI>d.</HI> The former works continue in hand, viz. Sap∣ping, Mining, and making Fascines. This day a sketch of the batteries against the town, and defences of the har∣bour, to be erected along the cavannos after the Moro should be taken, were laid before the Earl of Albemarle, and approved of by his Lordship.</P>
<P N="24">24<HI>th.</HI> The former works in hand, and the materials
<PB N="12" REF="009165_0011_1030FD2B6D361CA8"/>
collecting for a four gun battery, to the left of the Spa∣nish redoubt, to be called — This battery to be opened against La Fuerza, and to enfilade the two next flanks, facing the entrance of the harbour. There was a party of 600 Negroes ordered this day for fascine making, and to be continued upon that service, but they seldom amounted to above half, or even a third of that number, occasioned by sickness, and other pressing duties.</P>
<P N="25">25<HI>th.</HI> The same work in hand as yesterday. There was a road made from the rear of William's battery, up to the Spanish redoubt, covered from the town, to serve as a communication to the new designed batteries upon the Cavannos. This afternon there was a battery for five guns begun, to the right of the rear of Dixon's bat∣tery, to open against the Punta. This battery is called —</P>
<P N="26">26<HI>th.</HI> The former works in hand, and the battery be∣gun, to the left of Spanish redoubt. This morning a two decked Merchant's frigate, across the entrance be∣fore the West Bastion, within the Boom, and near the sunk ships, was sunk by a howitzer, near Dixon's battery; this ship had annoyed us very much.</P>
<P N="27">27<HI>th.</HI> The former works in hand, and a mortar battery begun at a Spanish redoubt; there was likewise a battery begun for three guns to fire upon boats landing at the Moro, which would have been of considerable use all a∣long, if it could have been served without erecting other batteries to check the fire of the Moro itself, upon that side: But that could not be undertaken, as our troops were already sufficiently employed in the works of the real attack. Brigadier Burton arrived with the first of the troops from North America, and was ordered to the west side.</P>
<P N="28">28<HI>th.</HI> The former works in hand. This afternoon a large merchant ship of the enemy's caught fire by light∣ning within the Harbour, and blew up in ten minutes. At night there was a battery for two mortars begun to the right of the Spanish redoubt: And one for five guns a∣gainst Fort La Punta upon the left of our Sap, near the point of the Moro.</P>
<P N="29"><PB N="13" REF="009165_0012_1030FD2CF8BD7B70"/>29<HI>th.</HI> The former works in hand. The mines were this day preparing for being sprung to-morrow morning.</P>
<P N="30">30<HI>th.</HI> About two this morning the enemy sent two boats and a floating battery out of the Harbour, to fire into the ditch where our Mines were at work: They fired grape and small arms, but without any other effect, than a short interruption of the work: The covering party fired so smartly upon them that they were obliged to retire: About two o'clock in the afternoon the mines were sprung; that, in the counterscarp had not a very considerable effect, but that in the Bastion having thrown down a part of both faces, made a breach, which the Ge∣neral and Chief Engineer thought practicable; upon which the troops under orders for the assault, were or∣dered to mount, which they did, with the greatest reso∣lution; and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rming very expeditiously upon the top of the breach, soon drove the enemy from every part of the ramparts: The Spaniards had about 130 men, with several officers, killed; about 400 threw down their arms, and were made prisoners; the rest were either killed in boats or drowned in attempting to escape to the Havannah. Our loss in this glorious affair, amounted to two officers killed, and about 30 men killed and wounded.</P>
<P N="31">31<HI>st.</HI> Our preparations were carried on with all pos∣sible diligence, for erecting the intended batteries upon the Cavannos. The enemy's fire continued very hot a∣gainst the Moro; they pointed chiefly at that part of the work where the cistern was, in hopes no doubt, of letting out the water. Lord Albemarle went this evening to the west side of the town to reconnoitre the ground there, and see in what manner attacks might be carried on with advantage on that side, in case of occasion.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 1<HI>st.</HI> The enemy's fire still continued against the Moro. This evening General Keppel determined to erect the remainder of the batteries to be erected upon the Cavannos; some by the 1st and 2d brigades, and some by the sailors, and to begin them to-morrow night.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d.</HI> This morning, before day, the enemy, sent down a 74 gun ship into the Entrance, and moored her opposite
<PB N="14" REF="009165_0013_1030FD337B240B90"/>
to the Fuerza; she directed her fire likewise against the Moro: There were two howitzers run into the battery to fire at her, which incommoded her a good deal. The batteries mentioned yesterday were begun this night, by the two brigades, and sailors; they consisted of thirty-five pieces of cannon.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>d.</HI> The former works in hand, and carried on with diligence. This morning the Chief Engineer was order∣ed to the westward of the town, to reconnoitre the ground, for attacking that side in case of occasion. This evening the enemy's ship opposite to the Fuerza, menti∣oned yesterday, was removed by our howitzers, with a good deal of confusion.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>th.</HI> The chief Engineer reported to Lord Albemarle, that as the Moro, was now in our possession, there was, to the westward of the town, a very advantageous attack to be formed against the poligons next the Punta, by the cover of a bank running along shore from the Lazaro to Fort la Punta, supposing that fort silenced: That there was a road upon the bank which was, for a con∣siderable way, covered both from Fort la Punta and every part of the town, that the road was at present stopped up by trees felled on each side, but might be easily clear∣ed; but as attacks upon that ground would in some de∣gree stand in the line of fire of our batteries upon the op∣posite side, it would be most adviseable to delay them until these batteries had in some measure effected their de∣sign; and especially, as they might of themselves, per∣haps, answer the end without further trouble.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>th.</HI> The works and batteries on the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> in hand as before, and some of the platforms begun to be laid: It was now difficult to get materials for that pur∣pose, those from England and Martinico being expend∣ed; but by the Admiral's assistance, the materials were got. Lord Albemarle took up his head quarters this evening the other side.</P>

from the provincial troops, lately arrived, now employed in making platforms. There was a command of Engineers, and a proportion of entrenching tools or∣dered to the west road, the former to go as soon as the batteries and works on the east side should be ready, and the tools to be shipped immediately: The chief en∣gineer was ordered to repair to that side, and there re∣main.</P>
<P N="7">7<HI>th.</HI> The former works upon the east side were going on, and Fascine parties ordered to work on the west side.</P>
<P N="8">8<HI>th.</HI> The former works in hand on the east side, but Fascine-making was retarded considerably on the west-side for want of tools. This afternoon the ship arrived on the west-side with the intrenching tools, but the ship being very sickly, there were none landed. In the evening Lord Albemarle went himself to reconnoitre the road and ground between the Lazaro and the Punta, and ordered some posts to be taken up farther advanced.</P>
<P N="9">9<HI>th.</HI> The intrenching tools were landed this day, by the assistance of the men of war, in the afternoon. The enemy having discovered our reconnoitring towards the Punta for some days past, set some houses near the road on fire to prevent their being a shelter for us. In the evening there was a party of 200 men ordered to make a redoubt upon the roads to the Punta, with a co∣vering-party of the same number; the place intended for the redoubt, which was partly upon the road, being much encumbered, as mentioned before, all they could do was to clear off the trees, and form an Abbates in the front and flanks for present defence.</P>
<P N="10">10<HI>th.</HI> At day break this morning the enemy having discovered the covering party, and suspected our hav∣ing been at work, began to cannonade along the road pretty warmly, but with little execution. About ten in the morning, our batteries being ready to open on the east side, and we to open ground on the west side, Lord Albemarle sent a flag of truce by an Aid de Camp to acquaint the Governor with the ruin that threatened the place, and summoned them to capitulate. The

Governor after keeping the flag from till between three and four in the afternoon, in the open fields, at some hundred yards distance from the works, sent him back, and before he got two thirds of the way, began to fire: we at the same time saw many people leaving the town with loads; in the evening there was a party sent to car∣ry on the works as before.</P>
<P N="11">11<HI>th.</HI> At day break this morning, all our batteries opened consisting of 43 pieces of cannon, and 8 mortars. The advantage of position, as well as superior fire, be∣came visible very soon. Fort Punta was silenced between nine and ten. The north bastion almost, in about an hour afterwards; but now and then fired a shot. Be∣tween 1 and 2 we discovered a great number of the ene∣my running off from the Punta, as if they had aban∣doned it. About two o'clock there were flags of truce hung out all round the garrison, and on board the Ad∣miral's ship: soon after, there arrived a flag of truce at our head quarters, by Don—Fort Major, his son, and an interpreter, which proved to be with proposals for a capitulation. Sir George Pocock was then sent for, and the business entered upon, as soon as he came. The works were stopt for this night, and the flag re∣turned about dusk.</P>
<P N="12">12<HI>th.</HI> The truce continued. This day the flag was sent in, and returned; and sent in again in the evening. The works were ordered to be carried on as before, which gave room to expect the hostilities were to be re∣newed in the morning; but the capitulation was settled before that time.</P>
<P N="13">13<HI>th.</HI> This day the capitulation was signed and seal∣ed; the long time it took to be settled, is said to be ow∣ing to an unreasonable earnestness in the enemy to save their shipping, which they at length gave up.</P>
<P N="14">14<HI>th,</HI> About ten this morning, General Keppel with —men, took possession of Fort la Punta, and about noon, of the Punta gate and bastion, at both which places there were British colours hoisted, having been eva∣cuated by the enemy. Brigadier Howe took possession of the land gate, with two battalions of grenadiers, much about the same time,</P>
