And from the Experience that men have had of these
<PB N="5" REF="000812_0005_0FAA56F378C9A4B8"/>
Benefits, as well as from Gods Over-ruling Influ∣ence upon their Hearts, it comes to pass, that there is such a willingness and Disposition in the most, to submit to those Powers that God in his Providence placeth over them.</P>
<P>Indeed we read of those that <HI>Despise the Go∣vernment,</HI> 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2 10. who, in defiance of this Subjection, <HI>Speak Evil of Dignities</HI>; [And what Ordinance of God is there, that hath not met with such as dare despise and condemn it?] Yet that many, even of These, [whatever their pre∣sumption and willfulness, (which infamous Notes the Apostle doth there brand them with,) may prompt them to say, or do against Govern∣ment specifically considered, or rather against the Person vested with it,] are not so void of common Understanding, as to condemn such Authority in General; appeareth, (if from no o∣ther Reason, yet at least) from the over wean∣ing conceit they ordinarily have, of their own Abilities, to rectifie the Male-Administrations of those that are in Authority, and so mend the Faults, they accuse the Government of, had they but their Advantages. It must be confessed, that some, such (I may call them) Monsters of Men and Sinners there have been, as have openly pro∣fessed themselves Mortal Enemies, to the Nature and Being of Civil Government (loading it with the odious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nders, of an Antichristian Strata∣gem, Limb of the Beast, and such as these) But that man, who shall oppose the Furious Notions,
<PB N="6" REF="000812_0006_0FAA56F49F98AF20"/>
of such Frantick men, against the concurring voice of all Nations, consenting to the Necessity and Usefulness of this Ordinance, will truly me∣rit the Character, which the Apostle in the 12<HI>th. verse</HI> of that fore cited Chapter, gives those De∣famers, <HI>viz. Of Natural Bruit Beasts</HI>; and justly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncur the Judgment he declareth concerning them in that same verse; in those words, <HI>Made to be taken and destroyed,—and shall utterly perish.</HI> And surely whatever Detractions from the Ho∣nour and Excellency of Civil Authority, This or any other Set of Opposers, (blinded by their own willfulness) are guilty of; such as have wisdom to discern the Circumstances of Men in General, with the present State of these Mun∣dane Affairs, can't but as highly magnifie it; As the great Buckler (when rightly managed) both of Religion and Property, and the best Expedi∣ent to Save a People from becoming a Prey to those who hate them. The want of which Au∣thority, (whether we understand it of a total Failure, or of an undue, lame, and ineffectual Management) hath ever been of fatal conse∣quence, and opened a Gap for Ruin upon Ruin to break in upon a people. Whence, whosoever shall well weigh, the no less natural than usual Concomitants and Consequents of this State de∣ficiency, and shall consider, what Irreligion and Profaneness, Unrighteousness, and Oppression, Disorder, and Confusion, do use to invade a People, when the Rod of Dominion is broken,
<PB N="7" REF="000812_0007_0FAA56F52E6C23D8"/>
the Bands of Authority dissolved, and every man is his own King, will soon see reason to reckon Government in the prime Rank of God's Mer∣cies. In the close of the Book of <HI>Judges, Chap. ult. ult.</HI> We have, as the <HI>very</HI> Reason, both of the great Abominations that had defiled the Land of <HI>Israel,</HI> and of the great Devastations that had ra∣ged in it, This given us; <HI>In these Dayes there was no King</HI> (or Chief Magistrate) <HI>in Israel.</HI></P>
<P>Now, by how much greater the Blessing of Civil Government is (which is designed for the Prevention and Removal of those Grievances that are incident to men) by so much the more intollerable is it, when it is either not improved at all, or not to any good purpose or effect, or mis-improved; when, either Wit or Will to pro∣secute the Ends of Rule are wanting; and such as have the managing of it, are either Unskilful, &amp; know not; or Weak, and cannot; or perverse and will not consult the Peace and Weal of those they bear rule over. Though the Calami∣ties, and Confusions of Anarchy, are very dread∣ful, yet the Instances of such as have been ruin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by the abuse, rather than the want of Civi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Authority, are more frequent, and as formida<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble. It is a sad case that a People is in, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there are no Rods at all, for a Scepter to Rule and it is not much (if it be any thing) bette<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when those Rods that are, are not strong Rods and those Scepters, Scepters of Righteousnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> This hath a very ominous Aspect upon a Peopl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="8" REF="000812_0008_0FAA56F5B5C1A860"/>
This affords a pleasing Prospect to their Ene∣mies, and will not be long in bringing the whole State of their Affairs into a lamentable Confu∣sion.</P>
<P>This is it which the Prophet in our Text ob∣serves, to be the miserable case of the State of <HI>Judah</HI>; They that once had Men of Piety, Wisdom, Truth and Majesty, to adorn the Throne of Soveraignty, and Seats of Justice, were brought to that deplorable pass, that they had not a strong Rod to Rule them. And this was, to all that understood the worth of so great a Mercy, or should feel the want of it, such mat∣ter of sorrow, that we have it ingeminated by the Prophet. <HI>This is a Lamentation, and shall be for a Lamentation.</HI></P>
<P>There are two things (mutually illustrating each the other) which from these words of the Prophet, may be recommended to your Conside∣ration; and I hope not unsuitably to the pre∣sent Occasion.</P>
<P>The first is, The much to be lamented Cir∣cumstances of a State or People, over whom, there are None▪ or None such as there should be, holding the Reins of Authority, with a just and steady, strong and impartial Hand: This is expressed; This is it which the Prophet so bewails.</P>
<P>The second is implied, <HI>viz.</HI> The Happiness of a People who have <HI>Strong Rods, for Scepters to Rule them.</HI> And so far as we shall find, (in the
<PB N="9" REF="000812_0009_0FAA56F6B1DA7380"/>
handling of these cases) either of them to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> co-incident with our own, There will arise a va∣riety of Duties, belonging to us respectively in our several Stations; and those of great Impor∣tance, both for the preventing and removing of that Misery, and for the procuring and perpetua∣ting this Happiness</P>
<P>This Chapter (wherein is our Text) doth contain a Description of the Present, with the next Preceding State of the Kingdom of <HI>Judah,</HI> (ascending, as is generally concluded, as far as to the end of King <HI>Josiahs</HI> Reign) in a Twofold Parable.</P>
<P>The First, of a Lioness and her Whelps, catching the Prey, and devouring until they▪ were taken in the Pit. From <HI>verse</HI> 2. to the 9<HI>th</HI> inclusively. Which Parable refers to the Time of the Two Kings, successively following <HI>Josiah▪ Jehoahaz</HI> and <HI>Jehojakim.</HI></P>
<P>The Second (from the 10<HI>th verse</HI> to the end) of a Vine, fruitful and full of Branches, but pluck'd up at length and cast to the Ground. Which sets forth the augmented Miseries of that declining State, under the two next Kings <HI>Jeho∣jachin</HI> and <HI>Zedekiah.</HI></P>
<P>This last verse, seemeth to be not only a Nar∣rative of the Low Ebb, that the Regal Authori∣ty of the Kings of <HI>Judah,</HI> was already fallen in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to; (who were rather Princes than Kings, and those Tributaries to the King of <HI>Babylon</HI>) Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> also, a Prediction what a lamentable pass, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="10" REF="000812_0010_0FAA56F957C35408"/>
Civil Affairs of that Kingdom (already so per∣plexed) should come to, after <HI>Zedekiahs</HI> Captivi∣ty, which was now at Hand. Concerning which (to shew the certainty of it) the Prophet here speaks of it as already come: <HI>And Fire is gone out,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>which hath devoured her Fruit</HI>: verified considerably by what they dayly saw and sustai∣ned; but afterwards, more in those horrid Tu∣mults, Murders and Confusions, that fell out in <HI>Gedaliah's</HI> Time; whom <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> had ap∣pointed Governour over the Residue of the <HI>Jews,</HI> permitted to abide in the Land.</P>
<P>In the words themselves we may Observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. How the <HI>Judaean</HI> State came to be invol∣ved in these Calamities. <HI>And Fire is gone out of a Rod of her Branches.</HI> This was it which had ru∣ined them: All the Fruits of this Vine, were by this means devoured.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Calamity it self, here noted by the Prophet, in which they were involved. <HI>So that she hath no Strong Rod, for a Scepter to Rule.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Prophets Reflection thereupon; <HI>This is a Lamentation, and shall be for a Lamentation:</HI> The two last I principally design to speak to.</P>
<P>The Political State of the Jews, is here resem∣bled to us by a Vine; Their Kings (who were from among themselves, an ancient Blessing which God had promised them. <HI>Deut.</HI> 17.15.) were the <HI>Rods</HI> of the <HI>Branches of this Vine</HI>; and these were They, that by their Sin and Folly, kindled the Fire which consumed, both themselves and
<PB N="11" REF="000812_0011_0FAA56F976F1DF48"/>
the State. This is the Summ of the first part of the verse; And belongs, as to its Application, to the three Kings or Princes, preceding <HI>Zedeki∣ah</HI> (all of them gross Idolaters:) And especially to <HI>Zedekiah's</HI> revolting from, and afterwards refu∣sing to submit to the King of <HI>Babylon</HI>; (as the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> counselled him: <HI>Jer.</HI> 38.17, 23.) This set Fire to the Rage of that Potent Monarch, and that Fire destroyed the City of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the Temple, and (in a great mea∣sure) the Ancient Civil Politie of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>The Figurative Terms in the latter part of the verse are obvious; and need not much to be said for their Explication. I shall add what is needful in a few words.</P>
<P><HI>Rod.</HI>] The same word is rendred <HI>Staff.</HI> The word according to the Notation of it, signifieth a Thing to Lean upon. Hence it is Metaphori∣cally put for whatsoever is necessary for the Sub∣sistence of another. So <HI>the Staff of Bread,</HI> in <HI>Lev.</HI> 26.26. and <HI>Ezek.</HI> 4.16. is that supply of such Kind, which a Person or People hath dependance upon, and cannot subsist without: Hence it sig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nifieth Power, Authority, or Government; <HI>Isa▪</HI> 9.4 and 10.24 <HI>Per. Metaph.</HI> Because Govern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment is the very Prop and Support of a Stat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and that by which it doth subsist. Or, (as som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would have it) It may be put for Governme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> or Authority, <HI>Per Metonymiam Adjuncti,</HI> the si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> being put for the Thing signified. Because su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="12" REF="000812_0012_0FAA56FA718300C8"/>
<HI>Rods</HI> were an Ancient Badge of those that were in Authority. Whence the same word signifieth <HI>a Tribe. Psal.</HI> 78.7. Because every <HI>Tribe</HI> had a <HI>Rod,</HI> with the Name of that <HI>Tribe</HI> on it, which the Princes of the <HI>Tribes</HI> used to carry in their Hands as Ensigns of their Authority. So that by <HI>Rods,</HI> we are to understand Persons in Autho∣rity; the Adjunct being put for the Subject.</P>
<P><HI>Scepter.</HI>] Is a word of the same Import: A <HI>Scepter</HI> is a Mark of Majesty and Severity which Kings of old, as well as now, were wont to use. Yet it is not to be restrained to Kingly Domini∣on only: (<HI>in Amos</HI> 1.8. It is used concerning the State of the <HI>Philistines</HI> which was <HI>Aristocrati¦cal</HI>:) And it signifieth, by the same <HI>Metonymie,</HI> any Power or Majesty, of Government or Rule, under what form or Name soever. This then explaineth the former word; <HI>No Rods for a Scepter; i. e.</HI> Men in Authority, or Civil Govern∣ment; for the Term <HI>Scepter</HI> is no where applied to any other kind of Government exercised by Men over one another.</P>
<P><HI>To Rule.</HI>] The word is of great Extent, im∣plies a Right and Authority over Persons and Actions, and whatever can be Governed: In a word, it comprehends here, whatever belongs to the Exercise of Civil Power: as to Enact Laws, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o assure Rewards to the Obedient; to determine Penalties for the Disobedient, and to distribute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth Rewards and Punishments. <HI>No Rod for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cepter to Rule; i. e.</HI> Such were wanting as should
<PB N="13" REF="000812_0013_0FAA56FB416E8BF0"/>
hold the Reins of Government, manage Affairs of State, preserve Order and Peace.</P>
<P>But, How so? Was not <HI>Zedekiah</HI> King? And had he not Officers under him? This Difficulty will easily be removed, by considering the Quali∣ty of these <HI>Rods</HI>; which the Prophet adds; and is principally to be taken notice of, and observed here. <HI>Rods</HI> they had, but not <HI>Strong Ones.</HI></P>
<P><HI>No Strong Rod.</HI>] or Rod of strength. Com∣monly applyed to Kings &amp; Kingdoms, which are for the most part, won and held thereby. This the Prophet adds to compleat the Description of those, whose help the state wanted: and that very agreeably with the Metaphor of a Rod or Staff, here used. If a Staff have no strength in it, it will prove but a Deceit, Cheat and Dis∣appointment, to whomsoever make use of it: it is its strength that makes it Serviceable. The same is true also, in this figurative use of the Word; or of those whom the Prophet here stileth Rods. Whatsoever is requisite to accom∣plish Those that bear Rule, that the state may safely have dependance upon them; and without hazard lean upon their Conduct, whether it be Wisdom, Justice, Piety, Prowess; that is the strength of these Rods, the Prophet here speaks of. And it is evident, he speaks of them under this Consideration (<HI>viz.</HI> as so accomplished) for men in Authority there were; <HI>Zedekiah</HI> was now King; after him the King of <HI>Babylon</HI> ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pointed <HI>Gedaliah</HI> Governour; (the time was no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="14" REF="000812_0014_0FAA56FBD98562E0"/>
yet come for <HI>the Scepter to depart from Judah, Gen.</HI> 49.10.) But these Rods, were not strong ones; accomplished for their places, and the Service of their Generations.</P>
<P>Thus you have the Prophet's Representation of their calamitous Circumstances. Next follows his Reflection upon them. <HI>This is a Lamentation</HI>] It is a word that signifyeth the deepest <HI>Mourning,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1.16. But how was this a Lamentation? It was so, both. (1.) <HI>Formally.</HI> It was of it self ground of great Sorrow; That a State, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce famous and flourishing, and (which is more) so peculiarly favoured of God above all others, should be thus cast down to the Ground. <HI>v.</HI> 12. (2.) <HI>Effectively.</HI> It would open a Gap to numberless Ruins; which both they that now lived should smart under; and they also should rue, who were yet unborn.</P>
<P>It is, and shall be for a Lamentation: noting both the <HI>Certainty</HI> and <HI>Duration</HI> of these Calami∣ties and Sorrows. For evils that come in at the Door of a Weak, Remiss, Lax Government, don't use to be speedily turned out again.</P>
<P>So you have the case of this People opened (so far as concerns their Civil State) and you have it lamented as very sorrowful. Whosoever shall look back to the times of King <HI>David,</HI> with those next following, and, shall take a view of the Conquests of that Reign; of Enemies sub∣dued; Cities taken; Countries subjected; People made tributary; Religion and Justice flourishing;
<PB N="15" REF="000812_0015_0FAA56FC87D0E678"/>
and the Nation formidable to all that were round about them; together with the peacefull Policy and Glory of <HI>Solomon</HI> his Son and Successor; and shall consider further, what all this was at length come to, in the times of our Prophet, through the grievous Sins, and gross Imprudence, of the highest Ranks and degrees of men accompanied with the wretched Degeneracy of the whole People (a natural consequent of the former) will without Hesitation subscribe to this of the Prophet; and acknowledge it to be just matter of Lamentation. It were enough to make a sensible mans heart ake, to compare the <HI>Miseries</HI> of this time wherein the Prophet wrote, with the <HI>Glories</HI> of the former.</P>
<P>These things, are they not written for our Learning? Certainly, It is an obvious Truth that from hence lies before us; <HI>Viz.</HI> That no great∣er Misery can well befall a People (considered in their politick Capacity) than to be destitute of such Rulers as the Prophet here speaks of; or to be under the Government of others. It is this that the Prophet here Laments, as that which was and would be, a dreadful inlet to undoing Evils. And consequently, the happy state of a People, is hence inferred, who have Strong Rods for Scepters to rule them.</P>
<P>This is the Lesson; And we shall be happy, if we can learn it from the Harms of others, and not our own. <HI>Faelix quem faciunt aliena Pericula cautum.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="000812_0016_0FAA56FD62AAF830"/>This therefore give me leave to recommend to you at this Time, in this general Inference from the Words, as the Doctrine to be considered and improved. <HI>Viz.</HI></P>

<P>I do not say, That none do or may, legally, or justly rule over others, who are not so quali∣fied, or have not this fear: it is an undeniable Truth, that, <HI>Temporal Dominion is not founded on Grace.</HI> Such men may by an indisputable Right, sway the Scepters of <HI>Earthly Kingdoms,</HI> who do not belong themselves to the <HI>Spiritual Kingdom</HI> of Christ; I am not speaking of mens <HI>Right</HI> to Govern others; but of their being <HI>qualifyed</HI> for it.

<P>Let me here instance in a few things, wherein this Fidelity of Rulers should, and will be disco∣vered. It will be seen in:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A sedulous applying themselves to the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k of their Office.</HI> The Apostle saith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.8. <HI>He that ruleth, let him rule with Diligence.</HI> And it is as needful in Civil, as in any kind of Govern∣ment. Whatever it is, that God calls us to Serve him in, we are to wait upon that thing. And a Heathen could say; <HI>Spartam quam nactus es, hanc orna.</HI> Civil Rulers are (by the Ordinance both of God and man) not only set apart <HI>from,</HI> but set <HI>above</HI> others, for a Special and Honourable Service; which cannot therefore with a good Conscience be neglected. King <HI>Jehosaphat</HI> gave this Instruction in special, with the Commission he had granted to those Judges that were to set at Jerusalem, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19.9. <HI>Thus ye shall do</HI>: q. d. mind the thing that you have now in Commissi∣on, and let it be done without fail. And for this reason, God hath provided, that such as thus Serve the Publick, should have not only the Honour of Reverence, but also of Tribute; <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.6. <HI>For this cause pay you Tribute also; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey are Gods Ministers, attending continually on this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very Thing.</HI> That, as the former relates to the Dignity; so the latter should honourably sup∣port
<PB N="27" REF="000812_0027_0FAA5707B1250A18"/>
them, and supply the necessities arising from that attendance. Thus, the same right that Ru∣lers have to these civil Dues, Tribute, or Salary, (call it by which name you please) than which right, nothing can be more indisputable, as being the express command of God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.7; The same reason have they to attend to that Service which acquires it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A diligent Enquiry into all Causes depending before them.</HI> The Judges saith <HI>Moses,</HI> Deut. 19.18. <HI>shall make diligent Inquisition</HI>; and <HI>Job</HI> saith, <HI>chap.</HI> 29.16. <HI>The Cause that I knew not, I searched out</HI>; yea, <HI>It is the Honour of a King to search out a matter. Prov.</HI> 25.2. And before this is well done, before consideration had, and Examination made, of all Witnesses and Circumstances, Proofs and Pleas (with whatever else may be worthy of it, or serve to give Light in the Case) It is not safe but shameful to determine any thing <HI>Prov.</HI> 18.13. <HI>He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.</HI> The Truth many times lies deep, and can't be discovered without this course be taken, and diligently followed. This therefore is none of the least difficult parts of a Rulers Task; it requires a great deal, both of pains and patience, and must be undergone. There is the <HI>Onus,</HI> as well as the <HI>Honos,</HI> the Bur∣then as well as the Honour of Government; &amp; they that will not bear the one, are not worthy to wear the other. When such men as have the Rule of others, are either slowthful in the Busness
<PB N="28" REF="000812_0028_0FAA5708898921B0"/>
which belongs to them as such, or careless about it, and (<HI>Gallio</HI> like) value not whether Matters go right or wrong, so they can but Serve them∣selves, and get rid of the trouble of being con∣cerned with them, they are not only injurious to particulars, but the very disgrace of their Places, so long as they hold them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>An upright and impartial Judging in every Cause occurring:</HI> not warp'd in the least, from the streight Rule of Just and Right, either by Flattery or Bribery, Favour or Affection. They must not respect persons in Judgment. <HI>Deut</HI> 1.17. <HI>Prov.</HI> 24.23. No not the poorest man in his Cause, if he hath not Right on his side. <HI>Exod,</HI> 23.3. Justice is to be <HI>Given,</HI> not <HI>Sold,</HI> and that with an equal steady hand; so that, neither a foolish Compassion on the miserable when they are cul∣pable, nor affection to Friends, nor the Insinuati∣ons of the Crafty, nor the Daubings of Flatte∣rers, the Gifts of the Wealthy, the Favour of Great Ones, nor yet the Frowns or Threats of the Mighty, should make it incline in the least to either side. Whatever Difference in respect of Dignity there may be between the Parties con∣cerned in the Justice to be Administred, yet Just∣ice remains one and the same; and the Law by which it is to be Administred, ought to be duly regarded, and kept unto; and not bow'd and bent on every turn, as may serve Occasion: This will maintain the Honour of the Laws, &amp; of him who Executes them; whereas if this be n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>glect∣ed, they will be both despised.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="29" REF="000812_0029_0FAA57093A9CCE78"/>4. <HI>A conscientious regulating themselves, according to those Laws by which they Rule.</HI> For although they owe this Obedience, considered in a more private capacity, yet their yielding of it, not a little conduceth to their faithful management of their publick Office; since they can't be more false to that Trust, than when they are them∣selves Actors of that Evil, which they are intrust∣ed to punish in others. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Custodes tam Pi∣etatis, quam Justitiae inter Homines.</HI> Keepers, Preservers, Promoters of Piety and Righteousness among men: This is it which they have in Charge from God and men; this is the great Matter committed to them. And for men to violate that thing (whatsoever it be) which is committed to their Care, is among the highest Notes of Infidelity. Good and Faithful Rulers, will be far from thinking, that their Authority (which is to suppress Evil in others) serveth as a Dispensation to themselves, to be, and do as they please. They will not esteem themselves at such a liberty; or think that they are as much above the <HI>Law</HI> they are to Rule <HI>by,</HI> as they are above <HI>those</HI> they are to Rule <HI>over.</HI> But, they know that (considering the Places they stand in) it doth as much concern them, to approve themselves worthy Patterns of all Holiness Righ∣teousness and Obedience, as to punish the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ult of these in others. They know that their bad Examples, will be more followed (and by more) then their Authority will be feared. <HI>Prov.</HI> 29 12.
<PB N="30" REF="000812_0030_0FAA5709FB7ECA08"/>
And that therefore, they can never be honest in their Places, unless they labour to be Instances of that Reverence themselves, which they expect all others should shew to the Laws under their Administration. And (to add no more) when they that should be a Terror to Evil Doers, set themselves up for an Example to them; and do the very things, that they should bear wit∣ness against in others, we may be sure, <HI>The Wicked will walk on every side Psal.</HI> 12.8. without Fear either of God or man. But when those that are in Authority, do by their own Obedi∣ence, practically honour the Laws they admini∣ster, this is not only an Encouragement to those that do well, but a Terrour to all that do otherwise; and utterly takes away the Hope of Impunity from the most presumptuous. For this Instance of a Rulers Fidelity is the best Assu∣rance that he hath taken up <HI>Davids</HI> Resolution. <HI>Psal.</HI> 75.10. <HI>To cut off all the Horns of the Wicked</HI>; and <HI>that he will not bear the Sword of Justice in vain.</HI></P>
<P>Thus you see, who are the <HI>Strong Rods</HI>; and what it is makes them so: Wise and Just, Cou∣ragious and Pious Rulers: Devoting themselves to the work or their Office, diligently enquiring into, and impartially judging in Causes depend∣ing, and of Exemplary Conversation.</P>
<P>It remains that we shew them to be rich Bles∣sings.</P>
<P>And that we may make a right Estimate of
<PB N="31" REF="000812_0031_0FAA570AD0216500"/>
the worth of such men, and come to know what Blessings they are to the Publick; we may <HI>first</HI> consider, wherein the Publick Weal consists; and <HI>then</HI> what Influence they have upon it: And from their Serviceableness to that great End of Government, we may fairly compute what value we ought to put upon them. Wherein this Weal doth lie, the Apostle tells us, 1 Tim. 2.2. <HI>viz. in a quiet and peaceable life in all Godli∣ness and Honesty.</HI> In which words, he points out to us the two great things, that are the grand Interests of a People; <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Property.</HI> When a people have the liberty of professing the True and Orthodox Faith of the Gospel, and of Worshipping and Serving the Lord in the ways of his own Appointment, according to the prescription of his blessed Word; &amp; when a people may enjoy their proper Rights and Privi∣ledges, according to Gods Laws and their own; when they have that liberty secured to them, a∣gainst the Invasions of Error, Profaneness and Superstition; and these Rights and Priviledges maintained both against the Annoyances of a Foreign Power, and against the Attempts of Do∣mestick Oppression, Fraud and Violence, so that as the Psalmist speaks, Psal. 144.14. <HI>There is no breaking in, nor going out, nor complaining in their Streets.</HI> Then they enjoy this Quietness and Peace, in all Godliness and Honesty; <HI>And that People is happy, that is in such a case.</HI></P>
<P>Now therefore, if it can be evinced, that A∣ble
<PB N="32" REF="000812_0032_0FAA570BEA931028"/>
and Faithful Rulers, are the great means un∣der God, for the attaining these great ends of Government, and for the procuring and esta∣blishing this Happiness: the matter will be out of all doubt; and that People must be confessed happy, that have such to rule them. And here.</P>
<P>Whosoever shall well weigh the Condition of a People under other Circumstances; whether we consider them as wholly destitute of Rulers; or their Rulers destitute of such Qualifications; shall never want Conviction in this Particular.</P>
<P N="1">1. For, <HI>As to the first of these Cases,</HI> viz. <HI>When it is the condition of a People to be destitute of Rulers</HI>; their case is woful. The Consequents of Anar∣chy are so manifestly fatal to the whole and to particulars, that the very Authors of it, have blush'd to be it's Advocates. Nature it self al∣lows us not to imagine, that the Civil Felicity of a People can subsist without Government. Whatever Dissatisfaction men have conceived, against the Powers that are, they are rather a∣gainst <HI>the Person,</HI> than the <HI>Authority</HI>: Yea, they, that being weary of any present Powers, are given to Change, do ever pretend to hope for better; which shews, that the Necessity of Go∣vernment to the common Good of a People, is such a conclusion of the Light of Nature, as cannot be concealed, no not in the most Disaffected. And (which brings to the other case) the same Light that commends some Government as ne∣cessary, condemns a bad one.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="33" REF="000812_0033_0FAA570C3B68EC60"/>2. <HI>Nor (Secondly) doth it mend the matter much, if a People have such to rule them, as are not suitably qualified</HI>: Who have either no Wisdom to dis∣cern Time &amp; Judgment; or if they have Wis∣dom, that Wisdom is not regulated by Justice; or that Justice not strengthened by Courage; or this Courage not influenced by Piety; but they are though ambitious of the Honour, yet careless of the cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge of Government; impatient in Ex∣amination; rash in Judging; partial in their Sen∣tence; culpable in their Deportment; Examples of that Impiety which they should suppress in others. And what can be expected from such, but the Ruin of a People? They don't know, or if they do, they will not regard the Interest of the Publick; and be sure, <HI>will never Expose themselves in the Defence of it.</HI> They have more advantage than others to wrong the Publick, and as little conscience as any, to restrain them. <HI>These are they that will justify the wicked for a Re∣ward, and take away the Righteousness of the Righte∣ous from him.</HI> Isa. 5.23. instead of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighting those that are injured, they will add to the wrong. Religion suffers deeply by them, and especially by their Immoralities; &amp; the crafty Oppressor takes heart in his wickedness; presuming either to escape their observance, or to have their Con∣nivance. Whoever seek the Hurt of their Peo∣ple, these will do little (to purpose) to prevent them; but if a fair opportunity present, they will become Parties in the Design; and please them∣selves,
<PB N="34" REF="000812_0034_0FAA570D30122318"/>
if they may have but the luck to build their own private Fortunes on the Publick Ru∣ins: Or (at least) if they do not thus of set purpose, they'l do the same out of ignorance, sluggishness or cowardize, that others do out of desi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ and that's every whit as mischievous to the Publick. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>mon</HI> paints these men to the life. <HI>Prov.</HI> 28.15. <HI>As a Roaring Lion, and a Ran∣ging Bear; so is a Wicked Ruler over the poor People.</HI> This is the character of <HI>Folly set in great Dignity.</HI> Eccles. 10.6. And these are some of the many miseries that flow from such a Conduct.</P>
<P>I shall not need to enlarge much in so plain a case. Give me leave to add two or three Con∣siderations further, concerning those Rulers in special that have been characterized in this Dis∣course; and I come to the Application.</P>
<P N="1">1. Consider, <HI>Such Rulers will study and promote those things that make for the Weal of their People</HI>; and in this regard are rich Blessings to them. It was for their sake as well as his own, that <HI>Solomon</HI> in 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 1.10. begg'd Wisdom of God; <HI>Prudentiam Regitivam,</HI> that he might <HI>know to go out, and come in before his People.</HI> They know that for this end, God hath given them their Promotion, with all the advantages that at∣tend it; and that unless they do accordingly im∣prove it, they shall never be able to yield an ac∣count of the Price that is in their Hands; they esteem the <HI>Salus Populi,</HI> the Publick Good, to be one of the Chief <HI>Subordinate Ends</HI> of Govern∣ment;
<PB N="35" REF="000812_0035_0FAA570DAE00B008"/>
and that whosever doth not faithfully endeavour the same, can never attain the <HI>Ulti∣mate.</HI> And though the Lord hath advanced them above their Fellow Creatures, and made them Gods among (&amp; in a sence over) men; yet they will remember that they are <HI>Ministers for their Good; Rom.</HI> 13 4. And accordingly do whatsoever lies in their Power, that it may be advanced under their management; that if God bless them therein, they may live the Desire of their People; their Deaths, whether Civil or Natural, be lamented; or their Memories Bles∣sed.</P>
<P N="2">2. Consider, <HI>As they have the greatest Advan∣tage to keep out, and to keep off Evil from their Peo∣ple; so they will diligently and vigorously improve it.</HI> They may do much (none more) to shut the Door against approaching Evil. And they will do as much as they can; especially the greatest Evil of Sin, which opens the Door to all the rest they will conscientiously oppose, not only by strict Laws, and severe Punishments; but al∣so, by labouring to be such a Pattern of Piety themselves, as shall be a powerful Incentive to the well-minded, and as great a dread to those that are otherwise. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ough when such Ru∣lers have done their best, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may be very heinous Transgressions among their People; yet they will endeavour that those Transgressions shall remain personal; and not amount to pub∣lick Crimes▪ by being allowed of, or winked at.
<PB N="36" REF="000812_0036_0FAA571085E5C018"/>
And when at any time the Wall of Gods Pro∣tection about a People is broken down, these are the Men <HI>to Stand in the Gap, to repair the Breach</HI>; and they may, by their Zeal for Gods Glory, seasonably shewn, in a suitable Witness-bearing against the crying Sins that kindled the Lord's Anger, turn away his Wrath from such a People. So did <HI>Phinehas. Numb.</HI> 25.7, 8.</P>
<P N="3">3. Consider. <HI>The success of the most Excellent Forms of Government, and most suitable Laws, doth under God, mainly depend upon the Ability and Fide∣lity of those that are in the Government.</HI> Which fur∣ther shews such as these to be exceeding great Blessings. Though there are diverse Forms of Government lawful, and many Laws just in themselves; yet all are not equally expedient for every People. As it is a great part of Prudence in Rulers, to know and consider what is most fitting for, and what manner of Goverment and Laws is most accomodable to the State and Condi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of those that are under them; so also it cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibutes not a little to the Happiness of a People when they are under such a Method of Government, and under such Laws, as suit them in regard of their proper Circumstances and Design. But yet, let all this be supposed of a People, it is all nothing, if such Rulers as these I am speaking of be wanting. If they that have the Sword of Justice in their Hands, want either Skill or Courage or Conscience to manage it a∣right; the Government will soon become inef∣fectual,
<PB N="37" REF="000812_0037_0FAA57118D7A7850"/>
and <HI>the Law be but a dead Letter</HI>; which hath its Life and Power, from an honest and vi∣gorous Execution of it. And whatever a Peo∣ples Priviledges are, though▪ they have the best contrived Model of Government in the World, and Laws as suitable as can be made for them; yet if they that have the Rule of them, are not men of such Principles as those that have been mentioned, they will be miserable notwithstand∣ing. Lamentable Instances of which do abound in the Chronicles of the Monarchies of <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Judah</HI>; which though they had a Body of Judi∣cial Laws, compiled for them by God himself; yet, never any Common Weal, fuller of Fraud, Oppression, Injuries, Violence, and Wickedness of all sorts, (as the frequent complaints of the Pro∣phets do testifie) than these were, when unable, or unfaithful Rulers had the Administration of those Laws among them.</P>
<P N="4">4. Consider. <HI>The Lord by whom Princes rule and Nobles even all the Judges of the Earth,</HI> Prov. 8▪16. <HI>Doth warrant able and faithful Rulers to us, for Publick and great Blessings; and condemn others as the Causes of a Peoples ruine.</HI> What an honourable Character doth the Spirit of God give us, of <HI>Moses, Joshua</HI> and <HI>Samuel</HI> among the Judges? Of <HI>David, Solomon, Jehosaphat</HI> (and some others) among the Kings? And what an everlasting Brand of Infamy, the Scripture hath set upon those Kings of <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Israel,</HI> that were not so qualified, as you have heard, is obvious to e∣very
<PB N="38" REF="000812_0038_0FAA571238FAA798"/>
one that reads the Chronicles of those times with Observation.</P>
<P>To this therefore I shall add only these two or three Particulars, wherein you may see the Lord commending able and faithful Rulers to us as rich Blessings, and condemning others as ruinous.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is recommended in Deut.</HI> 1.13. and <HI>Exod.</HI> 18.21. to all that have the liberty and power of Electing Civil Rulers, that in their designation of Persons to Places of Authority, they should have special regard to their being so qualified. And that which then contributed to the happi∣ness of a People, cannot now be thought to cross it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Lord gives such Rulers in Mercy to a Peo∣ple.</HI> In 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 9.8. It is said concerning <HI>Solo∣mon; Because thy God Loved Israel▪ to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee King over them, to do Judgment and Justice.</HI> It was a blessed Pro∣mise, that God supported his people with, when they were languishing under the miseries of a Government, not regarding the Administration of Justice; <HI>That he would restore them Judges as at the first, and Counsellers as at the Beginning; Isa.</HI> 1.26. <HI>i. e.</HI> such as <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Joshua; David</HI> and <HI>Solomon.</HI> And when such as these are removed from a People, their case is awful, and God threatens it as a sore Judgment. <HI>Isa.</HI> 3.1, 2.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>God sends other Rulers in wrath to a People. I gave thee a King in mine anger</HI> saith the Lord con∣cerning
<PB N="39" REF="000812_0039_0FAA5712F5E4A950"/>
<HI>Saul; Hos.</HI> 13.11. And again <HI>Isa.</HI> 3.4. God threatens that People with this Curse, <HI>I will give Children to be their Princes, and Babes shall rule over them.</HI> Dreadful are the consequents of this mentioned in the next verse. <HI>The people shall be oppressed every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: The Child shall behave himself proudly against the Ancient, and the base against the honoura∣ble.</HI> In a word, Violence and Insolence will bear down all before them.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Able and Faithful Rulers have the Promise of God's Presence and Blessing</HI>: Prov. 29.14. <HI>The King that faithfully judgeth the Poor, his Throne shall be established for ever.</HI> 2 Chron 19 <HI>ult. Deal Couragiously, and the Lord shall be with the good.</HI> And God in blessing them, blesseth the whole People. When their methods are Prudent, their aimes Right, their endeavours Vigorous, their hearts Valiant, their hands Strong, and God is pleased to be Crowning them with Success; the Publick will reap the benefit. It is said, <HI>Judges</HI> 2.7. <HI>The People served the Lord all the days of Joshua. Joshua</HI> faithfully endeavoured it, and God smiled upon his endeavours; God was with him, and the People flourished in Piety and Pros∣perity: but it was not long after <HI>Joshua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Head was laid in the Grave, before they knew the difference.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of Direction,</HI> and <HI>of Exhortation;</HI> USE II. Of Direction.</HEAD>
<P>This Doctrine affords Excellent Counsel to all such as have the Power of Choosing, and Li∣berty (by divine Providence, and the Royal favour) of Electing Persons into any Office of Civil Rule and Government among this People.

I may well conclude my self very much a Stranger to the
<PB N="42" REF="000812_0042_0FAA57154FD5CD70"/>
particular Methods and Customs usual in the manner of your Elections: But, I suppose (what∣ever steps have been already taken in other places of this Government) there are many in this As∣sembly who are still to give in their Suffrage. To whom therefore I would more particularly recommend this Rule, that the Doctrine layes before us) and in them to all others, that may hereafter be concerned in the same, or like affai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) as that which you ought to attend to. If you would not this day, do that which will be for a Lamentation to this People, and remain so. <HI>Let your Care then be, to Elect such as may be Able for their Places, and Faithful in them.</HI> Don't think your Voices are so your own, that you may bestow them upon whom you will, meerly because you will.

Beware of those corrupt and sinister Ends, which are too too apt to blind your Judgments, and biass your Affections, from the Rule thus set before you. I shall but hint at some of them.</P>
<P>There are some (of plausible pretences indeed but ungoverned Spirits) who in Affairs of this nature, consult only their own Humours; and choose for such as they hope will most indulge them. These had rather they should be in Au∣thority, then such as have Wisdom and Spirit to controul them; &amp; if they have any secret Grudge against a man of Worth, besure it shall weigh

<P>Some are wholly Swayed by the Favour they have received from, and the Friendship and Ac∣quaintance they have with these and those men; they think it but a point of Civility, to Vote for such as have been civil, kind, and obliging to them: But we ought to consider that our <HI>good Friends</HI> may be <HI>poor Patrons</HI> of the Common-Weal; they may be as bad Counsellers for the State, as <HI>Jobs</HI> were Comforters to him; Good men should have other ways to express their Gratitude to their Friends, than by the publick Injury; and <HI>(if it must needs be so) we had bet∣tor disgust them, than do that which is worse.</HI></P>

Your Ability is under God our strength; your Fidelity, our Security: <HI>If these Foundations are destroyed what shall the Righteous do? Psal.</HI> 11.3. If these Foundations are out of course, nothing will go right, or stand long among us. It is a great Trust which is this day to be commit∣ted to you; your Advantages hereupon to do much for the Glory of God among his People, by going before them, and leading them in the way of the Lord, are very Eminent: And God hath answerable Expectations concerning you; you may be for a Name and a Praise unto him; (and we may be so too, by God's blessing on your Conduct.)

You have our hearty Wishes that God would be with you, as he hath been with those that are gone before you: That you may be as the Mountains that bring Peace, and as the Hills that produce Righteousness to his People: That your Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Piety, may be the safeguard of our Land, and the Stability of our Times: These are the things, which duely improved, will make you <HI>Rich Blessings.</HI> Be intreated therefore to shine in the Improvement of them.

And if this be a Day wherein the Lord is coming out against us in Judgment; Oh! How should you that are the Lords Substitutes bear witness in your places a∣gainst the Transgressions which provoke him? If you are thus a Terrour to Evil Doers, it may be God will do no more terrible things in Judgment against us: If you do wisely and courageously Execute Judgment, who knows but it may divert the Lords. <HI>Phinehas</HI> did so, and the <HI>Plague was stayed, Psal</HI> 106 30.</P>

When the Lord by whom Princes rule, maketh them Nursing Fathers to his People, it openeth a wide door of Liberty and Power, to all that derive Authority from them to be in their respective places, <HI>Rods of Strength,</HI> for defending and encouraging the Good, for sup∣pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng and punishing the Wicked, for promoting Piety and Righteousness; and if there be an heart wanting to improve such an advantage, we may probably repent it, when we can do nothing else.</P>
<P>Suffer then the Exhortation, I beseech you in the words of the Lord, which you have in <HI>Hag.</HI> 2.4. <HI>Be strong O Zerubbabel and work</HI>: Do the work of your publick Capacities, with Prudence, Honour and Fidelity: <HI>I am with you saith the Lord of Hosts.</HI> Thus if you approve your selves, it will be Honour to God, your Comfort, our Weal, and the rejoycing of all that love God &amp; his People.</P>
<P>There are a few things, which I would crave your Patience (Honoured and much Respected) that I may briefly recommend unto you; as need∣ful to be much in your Eyes, and upon your Hearts, if you would thus acquit your selves; &amp; be Strong Rods to us at such a Day as this.</P>

When the Church had reckoned up the Loving-kindnesses of God, ma∣ny ways expressed; we have in the following verse the consideration intimated, upon which the Lord proceeded in doing those great things for his people, verse 8. <HI>For he said, surely they are my People, Children that will not lie, so he was their Sa∣viour; q. d.</HI> They will not be false to my Cove∣nant, they will walk in my ways, and keep my Commandments, they will remember their En∣gagements and fulfil them; and upon their so doing, he had and would shew them his Sal∣vation. In this way they might hope for it; but if they should prove lying, unholy, backsliding Children, they would but deceive themselves to expect it. Upon this ground hath the Lord been proceeding with our Fathers in time past; and upon the same will he deal with us at this Day. If we consider the things that were at the begin∣ning, when God first laid the Foundations of Gospel work in these Ends of the Earth; if we remember the Wonders of old, which we have heard, and our Fathers have told us; we may say of those Providences, whereby God through

Alas! How many are there that have forgotten &amp; forsaken this great Interest of the Lord among us? Be you intreated therefore (who shall have the rule of this People) to consider it, and engage your hearts to the advancing of it. Remember that there is a Solemn Covenant be∣tween God &amp; this his People; God hath taken them to be his, &amp; they have owned themselves to be the Lords; upon this Foundation stand all our

Legislative Power among us (which I submit to your most serious consideration) we may be sure it will be a good Improvement of it.

How long the price (the Liberty &amp; Authority for this) which you now have, will be in your hands, the Lord only knoweth: And besides, when things are once going down hill, the further they go, the harder it is to stop them. We may rationally look that if what is amiss in a matter of so great Concernment as this, both to our selves and ours, be not rectified speedily, it will grow worse and worse, and be beyond all Remedy at last.</P>

They are Sins which God hath often warned us of, long humbled us for; yea, and for these, is not the Hand of the Lord stretched our against us still? For the Lords sake therefore, for your own sakes, and for ours, Do you that have the Sword of Ju∣stice in your Hands, strike at, and spare not these Transgressions: Let the wholesome Laws already provided against them be fearlesly.

<P N="6">6. <HI>Be impartially just to all that have occasion to seek for Justice at your Hands.</HI> When you have heard the Cause, judge according to the merit of it.

These snares are some of them more obvious, and can take none but such as are willing to be caught; some are more out of view, and therefore most to be feared and watch'd a∣gainst, by those that have a Principle of Justice in them. There's a sort of Bribery more gross by gifts; &amp; there's another sort more private &amp; subtil, when men by secret arts and flatteries do whee∣dle and insinuate themselves into the Affections; which, whensoever it takes, is as great a disho∣nour to the Dignity of Magistracy, and tends as much to the corruption of Judgment, and per∣verting of Justice and Right, as any. By this means, a man may for less than <HI>a piece of Bread,</HI> buy Injustice enough to starve and ruin his ho∣nest Neighbour. Again, there are some, who would perhaps baulk at the grosser Temptations of Flattery or Bribery, who may be unawares snared by others; and do very unjustly, when they are far from suspecting it. They may be
