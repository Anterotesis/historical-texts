upon Complaint they gave another Meeting: But <HI>T Lloyd▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Jenings,</HI> and the rest are so far short of the Justice of the <HI>Baptists,</HI> that they never so much as acquainted G.

when its well known the most of them were his great Oppo∣sers: They might be sure this way to condemn him, when only a Faction o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them get toge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her, and accuse him, and he nor any for him be present to speak for him. But that which still hightens the Crime of <HI>Tho.
