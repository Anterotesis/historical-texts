<P>Who hath despised the day of small things? For they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of <HI>Zerubbable,</HI> with those seven, they are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</P></Q>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT <HI>Isaiah</HI> should speak of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> as the person designed of God to restore the <HI>jewish capti∣vity,</HI> and call him by <HI>name</HI> near two hundred years before he was born, is truly remarkable. It has been thought this extraordinary prophecy was shewn to <HI>Cyrus,</HI> by the prophet <HI>Daniel;</HI> which
<PB N="8" REF="013696_0005_0F91B5CF77A938C8"/>
excited the <HI>Persian</HI> monarch to favor the restoration of the jewish ecclesiasti∣cal and civil state.</P>
<P>ZERUBBABLE, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was called also, by the <HI>Chaldeans, Sheshbaz∣zar,</HI> and so named, perhaps on occasion of his being promoted to be one of the King of <HI>Babylon</HI>'s life-guards. It was an antient cus∣tom for Princes to give <HI>new names</HI> to those whom they saw fit to promote and distin∣guish; as appears by a number of instances in the old-testament; to which custom there may be an allusion in our Lord's promise to the church in <HI>Perg<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mos,</HI> that he would give to him that should <HI>over come, a white stone, and in the stone a new name written.</HI></NOTE> is supposed to have been grandson to <HI>Jeconiah</HI> King of <HI>Ju∣dah,</HI> and the eldest surviving branch of the royal family of <HI>David;</HI> and for that reason appointed by the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> to be the <HI>first Governor</HI> of the returning <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P>MANY of the <HI>Jews</HI> had so little con∣fidence as to the success of the enter∣prize, that they chose rather to conti∣nue still at <HI>Babylon,</HI> where they had formed connections, and some of them had acquired estates, than to engage

<PB N="10" REF="013696_0006_0F91B5D0194A6168"/>
<HI>heartless, concerning the success of their en∣terprize, in it's infancy, should have occasion of rejoicing, if their lives were spared, on seeing the temple rise into a noble finished structure, in spite of all opposition, under the conduct of Zerubbable, supported of God, and assisted by concurrent aids of the divine super-intending gracious universal providence.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>seven,</HI> here mentioned, are the <HI>seven eyes,</HI> before spoken of in this pro∣phecy, to be engraved on the <HI>head-stone</HI> of the temple, as emblems of the <HI>Hea∣venly Angels,</HI> called <HI>the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth,</HI> to signify, that he uses the <HI>instru∣mentality</HI> of <HI>Angels,</HI> in taking the provi∣dential <HI>oversight</HI> of the world, and that his care and government of the world, by <HI>their ministry,</HI> in concurrence with other methods, is <HI>universal.</HI></P>
<P>THE jewish temple and common∣wealth could not rise without the bless∣ing of <HI>providence. Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it.
<PB N="11" REF="013696_0007_0F91B5D0E77BB638"/>
This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubba∣ble, saying, not by might, nor by power; but by my spirit</HI> [my providence] <HI>saith the Lord of hosts,</HI></P>
<P>THE Governer of <HI>Judah,</HI> and his peo∣ple, accompanied <HI>with those seven, the eyes of the Lord,</HI> i. e. aided by divine providence, might joyfully hope for prosperity; and that, by divine assist∣ance, they should succeed, is the pro∣phet's encouraging voice, in this pas∣sage of holy scripture?</P>
<P>SIMILAR, in their animating design and tendency, are the following ex∣pressions of this public spirited <HI>Man of God. Who art thou oh great mountain? Before Zerubbable thou shalt become a plain; and he shall bring forth the head</HI> [chief] <HI>stone thereof with shoutings, crying, GRACE! GRACE! unto it,</HI> in acknowledgment of it's denoting the <HI>Messiah,</HI> that great instance and dispenser of <HI>grace</HI> to the world, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been supposed, that this <HI>head-stone</HI> with the <HI>seven eyes</HI> engraved on it, was designed to represent <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> attended by angels, in the gracious care and government of the church and world. The thought may re∣ceive an illustration from Christ's being called, the <HI>stone</HI> which <HI>is become the head of the corner,</HI> and a <HI>chief corner stone, elect, precious, laid in Sion;</HI> as also, from the following words in Revelation, <HI>And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spi∣rits of God sent forth into all the earth.</HI></NOTE> in testimony of desire, that
<PB N="12" REF="013696_0008_0F91B5D1F2118140"/>
the divine <HI>gracious</HI> blessing might ever attend the temple service; and in de∣monstration of gratitude, for the <HI>savor</HI> of God, in prospering the work. <HI>The hands of Zerubbable have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN our <HI>fathers</HI> crossed the atlan∣tic, to escape being subjected, either to the iron jaws of <HI>English</HI> civil and prelatical tyranny, or the insupportable difficulties of residing on the eastern continent; and settled in <HI>this place</HI>▪ to erect a <HI>temple</HI> of freedom and religion; it was indeed with them, in certain respects, <HI>a day of small things.</HI> In emi∣grating from <HI>England,</HI> maintaining
<PB N="13" REF="013696_0009_0F91B5D25D2768D0"/>
themselves in <HI>Holland,</HI> and transporting themselves to these shores, their <HI>interest</HI> was <HI>diminished.</HI> Their numbers were small: their company, when they arriv∣ed, including every person pertaining to their families, scarcely exceeding one hundred people; and nearly one half of <HI>them,</HI> God saw fit to remove by death, within the space of a few months after their landing. <HI>Small</HI> were their ac∣commodations of life, and means of sub∣sistance: it was, at times, with great difficulty they could procure the essen∣tial necessaries of life. And <HI>small</HI> was their <HI>power,</HI> compared with that of their cruel <HI>Indian</HI> neighbors, and (I wish I could say less cruel) <HI>European</HI> perse∣cutors.</P>
<P>BUT in other lights <HI>the day was great.</HI> Our ancestors are not to be represent∣ed as perfect; but while they were not rude in knowlege, and in doctrinals not inferior to the church of <HI>England,</HI> with regard to piety and virtue they in general deserve an <HI>excellent character.</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="013696_0010_0F91B5D31FA2A5E8"/>
For <HI>the great and fearful name of God,</HI> and for the <HI>Lord</HI>'s <HI>day,</HI> their veneration was truly <HI>great.</HI> They discoverd a principle of <HI>strict justice,</HI> particularly towards the <HI>natives</HI> of the country. Their <HI>willingness to communicate</HI> among themselves, re∣sembled the spirit which prevailed in the primitive church, <HI>when no man said that ought that he possessed was his own; but they had all things common;</HI> a spirit which, in <HI>extraordinary</HI> situations, may be most highly virtuous. They were temperate.</P>
<P>THEY were full in the great protest∣ant principles, concerning the right of private judgment, and making the <HI>word of God</HI> the <HI>only rule</HI> in religion. Their desire was to <HI>build</HI> not on human inventions, but <HI>on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.</HI> So far as they adopted the instructions and spirit of their excellent minister, Mr <HI>Robinson,</HI> they were divested of bigotry, and friends to free inquiry. They were
<PB N="15" REF="013696_0011_0F91B5D4633E6A48"/>
zealous advocates for religious liberty. If they have been thought, nevertheless, to have discovered a little too much asperity towards those who differed from them in religious sentiment, we may be disposed to make an apology for them, if not to justify them, in that regard, when we consider the exaspe∣rating things they had suffered; and how easy it was for them to judge, that severity was essential to their preserva∣tion, in their <HI>peculiar</HI> circumstances. But if they deserve censure on this head, we shall be able to administer it with a better grace when we have so tho∣roughly studied and adopted the spirit of protestantism and charity, as not to attempt unscriptural impositions on our fellow christians.</P>
<P>THEIR <HI>design,</HI> in coming over to this inhospitable shore, was <HI>great</HI> and hono∣rable; to enjoy for themselves and theirs, civil, and especially sacred free∣dom, to worship God, without moles∣tation, agreably to the dictates of
<PB N="16" REF="013696_0012_0F91B5D4CF524590"/>
their own consciences, to enlarge the Kings dominions, and to pave the way for the conversion of the <HI>heathen:</HI> They had
<Q>an inward zeal and great hope of laying some foundation, or making way for <HI>propagating the king∣dom of Christ,</HI> to the remote ends of the earth; though they should be but as stepping stones to others:</Q>
And they came to remove their child∣ren, their posterity, from the snares, oppressions, and corruptions of the old world; which, however, have been permitted to follow them hither, like <HI>a flood of waters, cast forth out of the dra∣gon's mouth.</HI></P>
<P>THEIR <HI>ecclesiastical plan</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I have thought proper to insert it here, as I have taken it from Mr. <HI>Prince</HI>'s Chronology, 91st 92d and 93d pages.</P>
<P><Q>As to <HI>ecclesiastical matters,</HI> they held the fol∣lowing articles to be agreable to scripture and reason.</Q></P>
<P N="1"><Q>1. That no <HI>particular church</HI> ought to con∣sist of more members than can convenient∣ly watch over one another, and usually meet and worship in <HI>one congregation.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="2"><Q>2. That every particular church of Christ is only to consist of such as appear to believe in, and obey him.</Q></P>
<P N="3"><Q>3. That any competent number of such, when their consciences ablige them, have a right to <HI>embody into a church</HI> for their mutual edifi∣cation.</Q></P>
<P N="4"><Q>4. That this embodying is by some certain <HI>contract</HI> or <HI>covenant,</HI> either <HI>expressed</HI> or <HI>implied,</HI> though it ought to be by the <HI>former.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="5"><Q>5. That being embodied, they have a right of <HI>chusing</HI> all their <HI>officers.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="6"><Q>6. That the <HI>officers</HI> appointed by <HI>Christ</HI> for this embodied church, are in some respects of <HI>three</HI> sorts, in others but <HI>two,</HI> viz.</Q></P>
<P N="1"><Q>(1.) <HI>Pastors</HI> or <HI>teaching elders,</HI> who have the power both of overseeing, teaching, ad∣ministring the sacraments, and ruling too: and being chiefly to give themselves to stu∣dying, teaching and the spiritual care of the flock, are therefore to be maintained.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><Q>(2.) <HI>Meer</HI> ruling elders, who are to help the pastors in overseeing and ruling; that their offices be not temporary, as among the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> churches, but con∣tinual: and being also qualified in some degree to teach, they are to <HI>teach</HI> only <HI>occa∣sionally,</HI> through necessity, or in their pas∣tor's absence or illness; but being not to give themselves to study or teaching, they have no need of maintenance.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That the <HI>elders</HI> of <HI>both sorts</HI> form the <HI>presbytery</HI> of overseers and rulers, which should be in every particular church: and are in scripture called sometimes <HI>presbyters</HI> or <HI>elders,</HI> sometimes <HI>bishops</HI> or <HI>overseers,</HI> sometimes <HI>guides,</HI> and sometimes <HI>rulers.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="3"><Q>(3.) <HI>Deacons,</HI> who are to take care of the poor and of the church's treasure; to dis∣tribute for the support of the pastor, the supply of the needy, the propagation of religion, and to minister at the Lord's table, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="7"><Q>7. That <HI>these officers</HI> being chosen and ordain∣ed, have no <HI>lordly, arbitrary</HI> or <HI>imposing power;</HI> but can only rule and minister <HI>with the con∣sent</HI> of the <HI>brethren;</HI> who ought not in con∣tempt to be called the <HI>laity,</HI> but to be treat∣ed as men and brethren in Christ, not as slaves or minors.</Q></P>
<P N="8"><Q>8 That no <HI>churches</HI> or <HI>church officers</HI> whatever, have any power over any other church or officers, to controul or impose upon them; but are all <HI>equal</HI> in their rights and pri∣vileges, and ought to be <HI>independant</HI> in the exercise and enjoyment of them.</Q></P>
<P N="9"><Q>9 As to <HI>church administrations,</HI> they held, that baptism is a seal of the covenant of grace, and should be dispensed only to visible believers, with their unadult children; and this in primitive purity, as in the times of <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Apostles,</HI> without the sign of <HI>the cross,</HI> or any other invented ceremony: that the <HI>Lord's supper,</HI> should be received as it was at first even in Christ's immediate presence, in the <HI>table posture:</HI> that the el∣ders should not be restrained from praying <HI>in public</HI> as well as private, according to the various occasions continually offering from the word or providence, and no set form should be imposed on any: that <HI>excommunication</HI> should be wholly <HI>spiritual,</HI> a meer rejecting the scandalous from the communion of the church in the holy sa∣craments, and those other spiritual privi∣leges which are peculiar to the faithful: and that the church or it's officers have no authority to inflict any penalties of a <HI>temporal</HI> nature.</Q></P>
<P N="10"><Q>10. And lastly, as for <HI>holy days,</HI> they were very strict for the observation of the <HI>Lord's day,</HI> in a pious memorial of the incarnation, birth, death, resurrection, ascention and benefits of <HI>Christ;</HI> as also <HI>solemn fastings</HI> and <HI>thanksgivings,</HI> as the state of providence re∣quires: but all other times not prescribed in scripture they utterly relinquished: and as in general, they could not conceive any thing a part of Christ's religion which he has not required; they therefore re∣nounced all human right of <HI>inventing,</HI> and much less of <HI>imposing</HI> it on others.</Q></P>
<P><Q>These were the <HI>main principles</HI> of that scriptu∣al and religious liberty, for which this people suffered in <HI>England,</HI> fled to <HI>Holland,</HI> traversed the ocean, and sought a danger∣ous retreat in these remote and savage de∣sarts of <HI>North-America;</HI> that here they might fully enjoy them, and leave them to their last posterity.</Q></P></NOTE> was, in the
<PB N="17" REF="013696_0013_0F91B5D6C632CEA8"/>
main, rational and scriptural; it was noble, founded on the principles of <HI>the
<PB N="18" REF="013696_0014_0F91B5D6E47C58E8"/>
perfect law of liberty.</HI> Whether their choice of <HI>meer</HI> ruling elders, can be justified by the bible, may indeed be disputed.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="013696_0015_0F91B5D7993FF958"/>THEIR dissapprobation of the estab∣lished church, in respect to <HI>hierarchy discipline and ceremonies,</HI> we are fully persuaded was reasonable: their dissent, in respect to such things, was honor∣able. They have been reproached as being <HI>schismatics,</HI> with as much reason as <HI>England</HI> might be stigmatized as
<PB N="20" REF="013696_0016_0F91B5D8D36B5428"/>
schismatical, for departing from the church of <HI>Rome;</HI> and no more. If the church of <HI>England</HI> was schismatical in leaving <HI>Rome,</HI> we could heartily wish they had carried their schism to a great∣er length. The punctilious tenacity, wherewith the church of <HI>England</HI> estab∣lishment is retained and upheld, appears the more surprizing when we reflect, that the worthy English reformers la∣mented that they could not carry the reformation to perfection, by reason of the peculiar difficulties of the times.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="013696_0017_0F91B5D9E1A4AFA8"/>WHEN we consider that Mr. <HI>Robinson,</HI> their minister, was a celebrated oppos∣er of the <HI>Brownists;</HI> and
<Q>that the <HI>Brownists</HI> [at <HI>Amsterdam</HI>] would hard∣ly hold communion with the people at <HI>Leyden,</HI></Q>
our <HI>ancestors,</HI> having been charged with <HI>Brownism</HI> appears won∣derful.</P>
<P>THFY have been blamed as being <HI>independents;</HI> but we will forbear to censure them, on that score, at least till it is a little more clearly determined, that the plan of <HI>independency</HI> is disagre∣able to the <HI>christian institution.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> of <HI>Boston,</HI> in regard to Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI>'s being called the <HI>author of inde∣pendency, said,</HI>
<Q>That the <HI>new-testament</HI> was the author of it; and it was received in the times of purest, primitive antiquity, many hundreds of years before Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI> was born.</Q>
<BIBL><HI>Vid.</HI> Prince's Chron. p. 90.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>THEIR self-denials and deadness to the world, their <HI>magnanimity</HI> and per∣severance in troubles, straits and dan∣gers, at once command our admira∣tion,
<PB N="22" REF="013696_0018_0F91B5DBD9119A40"/>
and give us the highest pleasure. Let us reflect upon the hardships, and remarkably disheartening circumstances of their voyage, their being disap∣pointed of their intended place of set∣tlement, their being destitute of a pub∣lic engagement for the security of that freedom which was so near their hearts, their landing at such a season as <HI>this,</HI> where the winters are more severe, than they, in their early years, had been inured to; without an house to screen them from the rigid inclemen∣cies of the climate and season; all friendless strangers; not having, at that juncture, an European within hundreds of miles; but attended with natives, savage, and at certain times cruel as beasts of prey! Let us reflect upon their being thrown,' by their hardships, into a scene of mortal sick∣ness; which did, at once, most sorrow∣fully diminish their number, and weak∣en them in comparison with their hea∣then neighbors: let us consider them moreover, as struggling through all
<PB N="23" REF="013696_0019_0F91B5DC19D89F78"/>
these things, with such fortitude, such spirit and patience, that we can scarce∣ly discern in them, so much as a symp∣tom of discouragement, in their most perilous circumstances; and then let us be charmed with the power of christianity, and praise the gospel; let us adore <HI>the God of all grace,</HI> who was pleased to replenish them with such love to liberty, and posterity, such faith and hope, and, as the effect of these things, such astonishing firmness, in one of the grandest of causes. Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI> and Mr. <HI>Brewster</HI> spake with <HI>great sobriety,</HI> when they said of their <HI>church in Leyden.</HI>
<Q>It is not with us as with other men; whom small things can discourage, or small discontents cause to wish ourselves at home again.</Q>
Had we generally inherited but a single portion of their spirits, we might not have suf∣fered so. But it has happened to us, in some measure, as to the church in early ages: at first our graces were brightned by adversity; but when the country became more prosperous, we have grown corrupted.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="013696_0020_0F91B5DCF041F548"/>THE fortitude and heroism of our fore-fathers, when we consider them as surmounting the <HI>peculiar</HI> difficulties and perils of making the <HI>first</HI> settlement in <HI>New-England,</HI> appear with <HI>distinguish∣ed lustre:</HI> we do however, by no means intend by this, to derogate from the high praises which are justly due to the first planters of the <HI>Massachusetts Colony;</HI> we gladly acknowlege their accomplish∣ments and merits, and with great re∣spect and affection think on them, as <HI>brethren</HI> of our fathers, <HI>their companions in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>IN regard to wonderful appearances of providence, for the preservation and success of our ancestors, it was truly <HI>a day of great things.</HI> Contrary to their own intention, they were diverted from a place where the natives were numer∣ous, to a place where they had been a few years before greatly diminished by a wasting sickness; and though the remaining numbers of the natives
<PB N="25" REF="013696_0021_0F91B5DDA300AD98"/>
in the vicinity, were sufficient to have swallowed up our infant settlement, as it were in a moment; yet possibly, <HI>that God</HI> who knows the proper means for <HI>restraining the wrath of man,</HI> by such a judgment on the savages, might abate the ferocity of such of them as survived the calamity, and render them more moderate and pacifick. Providence brought them to a place, where the woods were stored with venison, and the waters happily enlivened with fish and covered with foul, things of no trivial importance to <HI>them,</HI> in their <HI>critical</HI> circumstances. Providence brought them to a place, where the soil, very near to the shore, is good, as well as of easy culture; though the circumjacent territory is poor. Provi∣dence preserved them through a long and hazardous voyage! preserved them through the extreme perils of aproach∣ing and landing upon a coast, so danger∣ous at <HI>this season,</HI> that sea-men who have been the longest acquainted with it,
<PB N="26" REF="013696_0022_0F91B5DE8249EC18"/>
find it sufficiently perilous to come upon it at this time of the year, notwith∣standing all the hospitable arms which are open for their reception immediate∣ly in case of their arrival. Provi∣dence procured them a <HI>patent</HI> from the King, when they entertained no expect∣tation of it. When they were ready to perish, providence ever sent them sea∣sonable supplies. Providence was their safeguard by day and by night, and effectually prevented their being destroyed by <HI>the sword of the wilderness,</HI> to which they were exposed, in <HI>getting their bread,</HI> as well as in their sleeping hours; while it equally prevented their being ruined, by insiduous foes, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some of the <HI>principal</HI> of these were, <HI>Lyford</HI> a minister, and a man whose name was <HI>Oldham.</HI> Their conduct resembled that of <HI>Rehum</HI> and <HI>Shimshai, Tatnai and Shethar, Boznal and their com∣panions the Apharsashites,</HI> in old time. They secretly wrote <HI>letters</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> to subvert the immunities of the Colony. The letters were intercepted by the vigilence of Governor <HI>Bradford.

And providence has, by their means, transmitted to us this fair in∣heritance we now enjoy; wherein we live in ease and happiness; and though it be with pain, I must say, wherein many of us live in great degrees of God-offending excess, prophanely rioting on the dearly bought fruits of our ancestor's toils, treasures and lives; and most un∣gratefully requiting that benign provi∣dence, which supported them, and made them the instruments of convey∣ing to us the blessings we thus wantonly abuse. On the whole, the spiritual grace and watchful care of Heaven, in the case of our ancestors, have gained a <HI>triumph</HI>; manifesting in how gloomy scenes people may sustain spirits, and in
<PB N="28" REF="013696_0024_0F91B5DFF167EF18"/>
what extreme situations they may hope Heaven will effectually interpose for the preservation of men. Unless we amuse ourselves with vain ideas, concerning fu∣ture excellence, the <HI>day</HI> was <HI>great,</HI> as being pregnant with empire.</P>
<P>IN a retrospection upon the spirit wherewith God was pleased to animate our fathers; their <HI>patience</HI> in the cause of God and freedom; and the <HI>singular care</HI> he was pleased to take of them; while he intended to make them the <HI>first planters</HI> of such a country as <HI>New-England;</HI> in which we their posterity live in so much felicity; and which promises to become so glorious; every little circumstance, relating to them and their adventure, seems to contract a dignity and importance, and is dwelt upon with satisfaction; we take a pleasure in imitating, annually, the <HI>sim∣plicity</HI> of their <HI>tables;</HI> and we <HI>glory</HI> in their very <HI>infirmities</HI> and sufferings.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="013696_0025_0F91B5E098286708"/>LET us, in the midst of these reflecti∣ons, have our hearts enlarged in thanks∣giving to God, for his merciful favor to our fathers, and to us by their in∣strumentality. Let us piously acknow∣lege <HI>the hand of God,</HI> in all that has been done for them and us, and to the whole, <HI>cry, grace, grace.</HI> With what <HI>strange gloom</HI> are our hearts filled, when we make the supposition, that all our fathers had been left to perish in their attempt! Proportionable to the dread∣fulness of such a supposition, let our gratitude be, to our father's God and our's. And, out of gratitude to God, let us improve the blessings of life with <HI>sobriety,</HI> and maintain our <HI>liberties</HI> with an honorable christian <HI>firmness.</HI></P>
<P>MAY we deeply imbibe the spirit of piety, charity, and liberty, wherewith our fathers were blessed, dignified and adorned; and not, like children of wantonness, for worldly triflles relin∣quish those privileges, which are so <HI>sacred,</HI> and were so <HI>dearly purchased!</HI> And
<PB N="30" REF="013696_0026_0F91B5E16B3DE2A0"/>
let us exercise such good judgment, godliness, virtue, and merited filial re∣spect to the precious honorable memo∣ry of our fore-fathers, as to abhor the most distant thought of a <HI>reversion</HI> to that politico-ecclesiastical, half reform∣ed church, oppressive as well as un∣scriptural, from whose cruelty they suffered such bitter things!</P>
<P>IT ought indeed to be noticed, to the reputation of the old <HI>Plymouth</HI> Co∣lony, that they have not relapsed to the established church, in so great a degree, as some other parts of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>OUR <HI>beginnings</HI> may have been thought by some, not ill-affected towards us, to be unpromising, and in certain respects inconsiderable; while we, like the <HI>Jews</HI> on their re-settlement, have been at∣tended with persons who have treated us and our enterprize, with envenom∣ed contempt. But, <HI>whosoever have des∣pised our day of small things,</HI> if they are

now alive, and are enriched with a a christian spirit of benevolence, may <HI>rejoice,</HI> in <HI>seeing</HI> that we, with our <HI>associates,</HI> have indulged to us by Heaven, one of the fairest prospects that ever a com∣munity was blessed with. Saith the worthy Bishop of St. <HI>Asaph,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his sermon, preached before the society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts. <HI>Feb.</HI> 19. 1773.</NOTE>
<Q>Per∣haps the annals of history have never afforded a more grateful spectacle to a benevolent and philosophic mind, than the growth and progress of the british Colonies in <HI>North-America.</HI></Q></P>
<P>WE have a sufficient extent of terri∣tory, and variety of soils and climates. Our manufactures prosper and increase in a pleasing manner, and promise to rise to the highest perfection. Agricul∣ture is studied. Arts and sciences in general flourish. Literature, which has been journeying westward, has made at last, a welcome visit to these shores: and perhaps having performed the tour
<PB N="32" REF="013696_0028_0F91B5E2E54C5AE8"/>
of the globe, it may here fix a more settled residence, and arise to singular perfection. There is among us a pre∣valent spirit of inquiry concerning the rights of the country, and a prevalent disposition to assert them; which things afford a pleasure, proportionable to the known richness of liberty, and the known destructive nature and tenden∣cy of slavery. The rapidity of our <HI>po∣pulation</HI> is surprizing. Had our <HI>New-Plymouth</HI> settlers been told, that the British <HI>North-American</HI> Colonies would contain <HI>several millions</HI> of people, before their grand-children should all of them be laid in their graves, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Capt. <HI>Samuel Alden,</HI> grandson to Mr. <HI>John Alden,</HI> who was one of the signers of the covenant at <HI>Cape-Cod</HI> harbor, and was, for many years, chosen an <HI>assistant</HI> in the government of <HI>New-Plymouth,</HI> is now living in <HI>Duxbury,</HI> aged 85. His father, deacon <HI>David Alden,</HI> arrived to the age of 73. And his grandfather lived 88 years. He has a sister, now living as I suppose, in <HI>Barnstable</HI> county, whose age is equal to that of her grandfather.</NOTE> could they have believed the information? If it should please God to allow a population for

the future, in any measure similar to what is past, some of <HI>our</HI> grand-children may live to see more people in these Colonies, than are now in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>AS the country has been growing more populous, godliness and friendship have decayed, and iniquities have pre∣vailed. We trust in <HI>the God of all grace,</HI> that, on the contrary, all christian and moral accomplishments, will for the future increase with our growing numbers. We chearfully hope, that all the absurd popish doctrines and wicked devices of spiritual and civil oppression will fall into utter contempt: that the spirit of liberty will be perfected; and that, as there will be constant need of such a spirit, while any sons of pride, ambition and avarice remain, so it will be perpetuated▪ that the country will be blessed with <HI>magistrates,</HI> who shall esteem it their greatest glory and inter∣est to excel in piety and public virtues, and in the promotion of every thing conducive to the prosperity and happi∣ness of society; that the clergy of the
<PB N="34" REF="013696_0030_0F91B5E45902C948"/>
land (in the judgment of some, if one of their number may say it with decency) deserving, at present, of an excellent character, will obtain the most correct understanding of <HI>the truth as it is in Jesus,</HI> and arrive to all the highest ministerial accomplishments; that the <HI>plummet</HI> for adjusting the line, between the power of rulers and privileges of the people, in matters civil and ecclesiastical, will be held with a steady, wise and unerring hand; and <HI>North-America</HI> rise unto the noblest <HI>structure</HI> the sun has ever beheld; and which shall be a pattern and source of instruction and happiness, to the rest of mankind. I cannot prevail with myself to censure it, as vanity and en∣thusiasm, to form such an alotment. There is this at least in reason to coun∣tenance it, that when God has seen fit to appear for a people, for several ages, in a <HI>remarkable manner,</HI> there is a certain degree of probability, according to the known rules of <HI>analogy,</HI> that he will <HI>con∣tinue</HI> thus remarkably to favor them. When we consider <HI>Rome,</HI> as founded by a rude uncultivated collection of peo∣ple; but yet, without christian princi∣ples
<PB N="35" REF="013696_0031_0F91B5E64F6B24C0"/>
to form and animate the patriot, arriving to such an eminent pitch of glory among the nations, we stand amazed; and ought to consider our∣selves as reproached: If God will grant that <HI>North-America,</HI> shall exceed <HI>Rome</HI> in it's highest perfection, as much as our ancestry and our advantages exceed theirs, our highest expectations will be answered; and the most sanguinary wishes of the warmest patriot will be completely gratified. Imagining such happiness to be in reserve for future generations, we may be tempted to re∣gret that we were born so soon; but that need give us no uneasiness. Inlarg∣ed with that christian spirit, whereby the disciples of Jesus <HI>possess all things,</HI> we are trasported into futurity; we live with posterity; we see all their religion, virtue, catholicism, love, peace, unity, beneficence, sobriety, learning, liberty, wealth and greatness; and enjoy all their happiness.</P>
<P>AFTER all, we are not to imagine that God sets before us any prospect, which may not be blasted by our irre∣ligion and vices; any <HI>hope,</HI> but such
<PB N="36" REF="013696_0032_0F91B5E6A17BF5E0"/>
as may be <HI>cut off,</HI> by a neglect to pur∣sue the proper measures for the pub∣lic welfare. I rejoice in all the christi∣an piety and holiness among us; am conscious of no malevolent inclination to exaggerate the degeneracy of the times; but confess myself unable to point out a country, founded in oeco∣nomy industry frugality and temper∣ance, that has arrived to such a degree of luxury, in so short a time as ours. Our <HI>singularity,</HI> in this regard, may in∣deed be accounted for, in a great mea∣sure, by our <HI>intaminating</HI> connections; but ought to be viewed as a most me∣lancholy threatning circumstance. In this <HI>fluctuating</HI> earthly scene, states, when by various means they have ar∣rived to power and wealth, are by pros∣perity thrown into luxury; and luxury operates slavery and political death! Such is the course of this world! No doubt, late and present dispensations of providence towards us, have been designed in part, to put us in mind of such a truth, for our warning to repent and become temperate; while they were designed also, to quicken us to a
<PB N="37" REF="013696_0033_0F91B5E7ABC64898"/>
laudable inquiry, into <HI>all</HI> the proper means for establishing and perpetuat∣ing our freedom and happiness. May the divine admonition be properly re∣garded; and oppression, which occa∣sioned our being planted, be made, in effect, to contribute to our safety and perfection. If no additional laws are enacted, for a check to vitious extra∣vagancies, we hope the higher ranks of people will combine to lead in the ne∣cessary reformation. And may God <HI>pour out his spirit</HI> upon his people, and <HI>his blessing on their offspring;</HI> that the inhabitants of the land may return, to be a godly virtuous temperate com∣munity; and have the <HI>singular</HI> honor among the nations, of <HI>knowing how to abound;</HI> and the glory and happiness of pursuing <HI>that</HI> on which their deliver∣ance depends, and in which their <HI>life consisteth.</HI> Is it impossible that there should <HI>once</HI> be a people, wise enough to withstand the temptations of afflu∣ence?</P>
<P>WE admire at the growth of our loved country: <HI>freedom</HI> is a thing, which, under God, has been princi∣pally
<PB N="38" REF="013696_0034_0F91B5AE5CA01448"/>
instrumental of it's arriving to be what it is; and freedom must still, in the hand of God, be one of it's main pillars; or it will fall, with as great a celerity, as ever it has risen.</P>
<P>IN a view to the <HI>edification,</HI> and per∣manent liberty and happiness of our land, it must be thought of the last im∣portance, that the <HI>youth be educated,</HI> as in general, in the principles of <HI>our most holy faith;</HI> so, particularly, in that spi∣rit of heavenly contempt of <HI>the pleasures of sin</HI> and <HI>wages of unrighteousness,</HI> and in that spirit of freedom, which christi∣anity naturally inspires. Liberty is the happiness, and slavery the misery, depopulation and destruction of any land. A <HI>spirit</HI> of liberty is necessary to the preservation of the <HI>thing.</HI> And the character of the world, as to a spirit of liberty, and every thing else, we can∣not but perceive, is ever mainly form∣ed by <HI>education.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this light it may possibly appear to gentle∣men of large estates and public spirit, a dis∣position of the surplusage of their wealth not injudiciously made, if they should found <HI>pro∣fessorships of liberty in universities.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="013696_0035_0F91B5AF354C8FD0"/>NOR is it by any means of trivial consequence, that a laudable care be taken to prevent the establishment of an <HI>episcopal hierarchy</HI> among us. As <HI>episcopacy,</HI> in the modern sense of the word, is disagreable to the gospel; so, it is to be considered, as an engine of civil, as well as ecclesiastical slavery. NO BISHOP! NO KING! was a <HI>max∣im</HI> with a British Prince, whose ideas of <HI>royal power,</HI> and what <HI>we</HI> call <HI>tyranny,</HI> appear to have been the <HI>same;</HI> and who, perhaps, had no vast regard for <HI>Bishop,</HI> church or religion, farther than he thought they might be subservient to his <HI>arbitrary</HI> views. It might not be greatly amiss if, NO BISHOP, NO TY∣RANT! Should be ever held <HI>a sacred maxim with this people;</HI> and a propor∣tionable vigilence be used that episco∣pacy may never take place in this country. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>When Bishops are immediately and highly dependant on the Prince, and at the same time are Lords over the rest of the clergy, the whole power and influence of the clergy is apt to be thrown into the prerogative scale; and this, when a Prince is disposed for a stretch of power, may have a most unhappy aspect on the liberties of a land.</P>
<P>Moreover, to prevent the appropriation and confinement of the landed interest, and posts of honor, profit and influence, to a few par∣ticular families in the country, demands the vigilence of the patriot. If such things are not prevented, <HI>honor</HI> will be too apt to alight on those for whom it is not <HI>seemly: power</HI> will be too apt to fall into the hands of those, who want the understanding or the heart to make a good use of it: there will not be proper encouragement for the geniuses, which the <HI>God of nature</HI> scatters promiscuously among the people; hope of rising will be cut off; laudable and useful emulation will be cramped: there will not be that exer∣tion for liberty, which may be seen, where there are great numbers of freeholders in a country, who have real estates to preserve un∣embarrassed: bribery in elections (if any such things as elections remain) will take place more easily and successfully, than it would if the number of freeholders was very great: there will not be such a spur to in∣dustry, as where men have a prospect of ob∣taining good farms, for themselves and for their children: a great part of the people will be very poor, and therefore ignorant, irreligious and vicious; they will be untaught to read, or they will have but little leisure for reading the <HI>word of God,</HI> or other useful writings; they will be callous and insensible; the friendly instructions and warnings of the patriot's pen, will not reach their understand∣ings and hearts; they will be low lived, mean spirited and servile in their tempers, and they will be slaves.</P>
<P>We ask leave to subjoin, that instead of endea∣voring to keep the people in ignorance, and under hard bondage, under a pretence of it's being necessary for keeping them in order, and to prevent their ruining themselves; rulers, of any kind, if they would act the truely human and christian part, should strive to enlighten them as far as possible; and, leaving them in the enjoyment of their liberty, endeavor to correct their morals, and bring them to <HI>choose</HI> that respectfulness and submission to regular government, in which their interest will forever be involved.</P>
<P>The care that has been taken to support more public or more private <HI>schools</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> is high praiseworthy; and we hope there will, in time to come, be much larger room for commendation, in this respect.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="013696_0036_0F91B5AFD9A34B20"/>WE please ourselves in a prospect of the future greatness and happiness of our country, and devise means for per∣petuating it's liberty and felicity; but when we come to think of our present political embarrassments, together with our sinfulness, our rejoicing is damp∣ed, and our hearts are filled with con∣cern. What further calamities may be

in reserve for us, God only knows: however, if we <HI>put away our sins by re∣pentance,</HI> in conformity to the disciplin∣ing intention of the rod of God; if we are believing, pious, <HI>just, holy, temperate;</HI> if we wait on God with trust and prayer, and live in his fear; if we
<PB N="42" REF="013696_0038_0F91B5B1CEED9C08"/>
nourish that spirit of christianity, which implies the spirit of liberty and <HI>union,</HI> and will form us to such disinterested grandeur, and persevering firmness of mind, as were possessed by our fore-fa∣thers, we may humbly hope that God, by that gracious providence which is essential to our relief and prosperity, will appear for our deliverance out of all tribulation, so that we shall not be ruined thereby; that he will make our adversities, in effect, to serve us; and cause all things to conspire for our preservation, and becoming a great and happy people! <HI>For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards him.</HI></P>
<P>IN fine, might we suppose our ances∣tors present, raised from the dead; and all their numerous descendants, who are now living, convened in at∣tentive silence; it is not unnatural to think, that one of the venerable sires should, in the name of the whole, ad∣dress the assembly, to the following purpose. It is, our much respected

offspring, parental affection, and there∣fore affection which is <HI>real,</HI> that has brought us from the unseen world. We heartily congratulate you, in a re∣flection upon all the great things which God has done for you; and (in the sense, in which our present state of happiness will admit the exercise of sympathy) we as heartily compassionate you under your present sufferings: for the exercise of which sympathetic tenderness, we are in a better capacity, as having learnt, by bitter experiment what oppressions mean. They are not unimportant things, wherewith we are desirous to impress your hearts. You are not insensible of the arduous dif∣ficulties we were called to encounter, the sea of troubles we waded through, as advocates for Heaven-born liberty; and that some of us lost our lives in freedom's sacred cause. It was, in a great measure, for <HI>your sakes,</HI> that we thus suffered; and, in a benevolent regard to <HI>your good,</HI> we suffered <HI>cheerful∣ly.</HI> That the church, from whose bi∣gotry and malevolence our sufferings chiefly proceeded, is an imperfectly

reformed one, constitutionally calcu∣lated to serve the cause of spiritual and civil thraldom; and that the cause of liberty is one of the noblest that can employ human attention and care, are <HI>truths,</HI> which will endure the severest, and most impartial scrutiny of all ages. Can you reflect upon such things, and with unpained hearts relapse to the established church? Or can you <HI>sell the truth,</HI> and relinquish your birth-right <HI>liberty,</HI> for <HI>such things</HI> as captivate <HI>the children of this world</HI>? With what care, with what pains, with what self-deni∣als and sufferings, with what tender zeal, with what alotments, did we <HI>lay up</HI> for <HI>you</HI>! We know indeed that, in such a world as this, the provision made by tender industrious frugal pa∣rents, is not seldom consumed, by the riot prodigality and dissipation of their posterity: but, considering how <HI>near</HI> you live to <HI>our</HI> time, with every other circumstance that merits attention in the case, if <HI>you</HI> are found so immersed in worldly-mindedness and sensuality, so dead to a sense of the importance of liberty, and so void of all religious and

virtuous principles, as to be now ripe for squandering away the inheritance which we procured for you, we must beg leave to consider it as one of the most astonishing of all events! If it might be a means of your <HI>standing fast</HI> in the cause of liberty and dissenting religion, which is the cause of God, of truth and righteousness; if it might be instrument∣al of your recovery from the sinfulness into which many of you are fallen; if it might be instrumental of the universal prevalence of those real regards to Christ, on which the relief and lasting good of this our loved country, and the eternal happiness of individuals, are suspended; we say it with great sincerity, that se∣vere as our sufferings were, we should be heartily willing to suspend our present happiness, and undergo a repetition of those sufferings, or even submit our∣selves to much heavier woes. With all the respect, tenderness and fidelity of the parental breast, we say, that if an effectual, speedy check, be not given to your thriving <HI>luxury;</HI> but the vices, which come under that general <HI>deno∣mination,</HI> increase among <HI>you,</HI> and in

Your effeminacy, intem∣perate drinking, and other sinful ex∣travagancies, have, in late times, oc∣casioned a scene of venality and pros∣tration of principle, to the no small hazard of your valuable liberties! But if you will return, penitently renounc∣ing all your sinfulness; if you will re∣turn to hope in God through Christ, and unitedly to love and fear and serve him, <HI>with the whole heart;</HI> and to ex∣ert yourselves with honor and perseve∣rance for the public good, he will par∣don your sins, and deliver and <HI>heal your lana;</HI> he will raise you to <HI>singular emi∣nence; he will give his</HI> tutelar <HI>angels charge over you,</HI> and you will be protected free and happy, in this good land, which God, in his mercy and grace, has been pleased to make us instrumental of conveying into your possession.
