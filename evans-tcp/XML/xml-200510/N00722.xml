By His EXCELLENCY, Richard, Earl of Bellomont, Captain General and GOVERNOUR in Chief of His Majesties Province of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> in <HI>New-England, &amp;c.</HI> and Vice Admiral of the same. A Proclamation.</HEAD>
<P>FORASMUCH as the Sanctification of the Lords Day is of Divine Institution, and enforced by many gracious Promises made unto the Observers thereof; as well as divers severe Threatnings denounced against the violaters of the same. Notwithstanding which, and the good and wholsome Laws made and enacted within this Province, and under the Sanction of the Royal Authority, in that case provided, It is observed that not only Children and Youth, but many persons of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> years, do too often prophane the said Day by frequenting of Taverns and Ale-houses for Tipling and Drinking, walking abroad in the streets and fields for diversion and recreation, and otherwise mispend the said Holy Time.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> do therefore by and with the advice and consent of His Majesties Council of this Province, upon the Address of the Assembly, hereby command and require the strict Observation of the Lords Day from time to time. And that all Justices of the Peace, Grand-jurors, Constables, Tything-men, and other Officers whom it doth or may concern in their several places, do take effectual care, that the Laws made for the Observation of the said Day, be vigorously put in Execution against all persons that shall transgress the same, or prophane the said Day in any way or manner whatsoever.</P>
