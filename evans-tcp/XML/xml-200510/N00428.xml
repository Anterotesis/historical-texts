<HEAD>To my Countrey.</HEAD>
<P>ABove Seventy Years have Rolled a∣bout, since a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> who was by a Ship-wreck made a Captive among the <HI>Indians</HI> of this Countrey, did before his <HI>Expiration,</HI> as if under some <HI>Inspiration,</HI> tell those tawny Pagans, <HI>That God being angry with them for their wickedness, would not only destroy them, but also people the Place with another Nation, which would not live after their Bruitish manners.</HI> And accord∣ingly, thô those Infidels blasphemously Replyed, <HI>God could not kill them</HI>; yet the Almighty God immediately after this vi∣sited them with a Pestilent and Prodigi∣ous Disease, which swept them away in such vast multitudes, that our first Plant∣ers thereby found the Land marvelously <HI>Emptied</HI> of its Primitive <HI>Inhabitants,</HI> and yet almost <HI>Covered</HI> with their unburied <HI>Carcases</HI>; while the Survivers were smit∣ten into awful and humble Regards of the <HI>English,</HI> by the Terrors which the <HI>Prophe∣sie</HI> had Imprinted on them. Thus, <HI>Thou hast brought a Vine out of</HI> Europe, <HI>O Lord, Thou hast cast out the Heathen and Planted

it</HI>! But we are very stupid, if we do not read an <HI>Admonition</HI> to our selves, in this Ancient and Famous Providence. Indeed <HI>I</HI> am not without my lively and ground∣ed Hopes, That our <HI>Good God</HI> will not <HI>ever</HI> (or at least, <HI>as yet</HI>) Remove the People which is now enriching this part of the New World, for <HI>Another Nation</HI> to suc∣ceed in the room thereof; however there are <HI>Ill men</HI> enough that have desired it. But we are surrounded with <HI>myriads</HI> of <HI>Dangers,</HI> and whether we consider our <HI>Cor∣ruptions</HI> within us, or our <HI>Enemies</HI> without us, we may see our selves in a <HI>Storm,</HI> that calls for the <HI>Help</HI> of every man aboard. Never did my distressed Countrey more want the Service of all that are in the least capacity to <HI>Do</HI> for us, than <HI>At such a time as this</HI>! Be∣hold therefore one little Sermon more sent a∣broad for the Direction and Encouragement of us all, to <HI>Do</HI> all we can for the Service of a People which is well worthy of our <HI>All.</HI> I now take no further care about it, but Recom∣mend it unto the Blessing of Him, who is the <HI>Hope of</HI> New-England, <HI>and the Saviour thereof in the Time of Trouble.</HI></P>

a part of your Obedience to their Majesties, who upon the Address of our Convention to Them, Declaring, <HI>That they accepted Govern∣ment of this People according to the Rules of the Charter,</HI> did in answer thereunto, Order <HI>A Continuance in the Administration thereof:</HI> than it is a part of your Deference to so great and just a Judgment, as that of the <HI>English Na∣tion</HI> Assembled in Parliament, <HI>That the Invasion of our Charters was Illegal and a Grievance, and that they ought to be restored unto us.</HI> Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Word of the Almighty God has been still one usual stroke in our Annual <HI>Solem∣nities,</HI> and something of that are you now to attend unto.</P>
<P>In the Words now Read, we find not only the <HI>Prayer,</HI> but also the <HI>Picture</HI> of a no les<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worthy than famous <HI>Magistrate,</HI> and it will be no unprofitable Meditation, to reflect a little upon the occasion of it.

But the <HI>Fruit</HI> and <HI>Event</HI> of it is now related in a Supplement unto that History, written by <HI>Nehemiah</HI> a Renowned Governour of that Restored People; for whom it was no mor<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> improper to Record <HI>His own Acts,</HI> than it wa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="3" REF="000538_0007_0FA6B4B205EA1578"/>
for the Great <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> to write his <HI>Com∣mentaries.</HI> This inspired Historian, was doubtless a very <HI>young</HI> man, when he first ap∣ply'd himself unto the more open and public service of his Countrey; for the Transactions of more than <HI>fifty</HI> years are comprized in this Narrative of his Administrations; neverthe∣less God made him a true <HI>Nehemiah</HI> to his Countrey men; that is, <HI>A comforter from the Lord.</HI> The good Providence of God, had made this <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> a blessed Instrument of Rebuilding and Resettling <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which had been miserably Ruined by <HI>Chaldean</HI> Inva∣sions and Oppressions; from whence, in the twelfth year of his Government, he goes back into <HI>Persia,</HI> where he had been an eminent Officer in the Court of <HI>Artaxerxes Longima∣nus</HI>; but from thence he soon repeats his Journey of above <HI>nine hundred miles,</HI> and revisits his beloved <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> with a new Commission, by vertue of which he sets him∣self to Redress divers Disorders, under which that little Common-wealth was labouring.</P>
<P>The common People at this time were ve∣ry <HI>Poor</HI> and <HI>Low</HI>; for they had usually many <HI>Children</HI> in their Families that call'd for more <HI>Bread</HI> than their single hands could pur∣chase for them; and yet they had heavy <HI>Taxes</HI> which the the Necessity and Calamity of their
<PB N="4" REF="000538_0008_0FA6B4B2E3BA0EA0"/>
Affairs <HI>compelled</HI> them to the payment of. The People had no way, but the Borrowing of <HI>Money</HI> to defray all these Charges; but the Rich Lenders took them at this Disadvantage, so as not only to squeeze the cruel Int'rest of <HI>twelve in the Hundred</HI> from them, but also to seize up∣on their <HI>Lands</HI> which they had Mortgaged for the <HI>Principal</HI>: Yea they hook'd the very per∣sons of their Brethren into Slavery. Very loud complaints were now made, of these op∣pressions; whereupon the Governour called a <HI>General Court,</HI> and procured the Relaxation of these Difficulties; he seems to erect a <HI>Bank of Credit</HI> among them, and render <HI>Credit</HI> so <HI>pas∣seable,</HI> that the indigent people might still enjoy their Livings, and yet have <HI>Credit</HI> enough to demand from one another what their Exi∣gencies called for. In the Speech which this Honourable Person made upon this occasion, he mentions his own <HI>Exemple</HI> as one <HI>Article,</HI> for the conviction of those who did in this time of Distress Exact upon their Neighbours. They had just before been under a Governour who not only made his Domestick Expences to stand the People in <HI>Five Pounds a Day,</HI> besides large quantities of Provisions, for his Table; but also he had his little creatures about him, whom he used as <HI>Tools</HI> for the getting of <HI>Money,</HI> as often as he
<PB N="5" REF="000538_0009_0FA6B4B3B307CFF0"/>
or they found a want thereof. But sayes our <HI>Nehemiah: So did not I, because of the fear of God!</HI> No, he would make none of those great Bargains, for which he had an opportunity in the Poverty and Penury of the People; but instead thereof, <HI>He</HI> denied himself of what was his <HI>Right.</HI> He refused the <HI>Salary</HI> which was due unto him as a <HI>Magistrate</HI>; and this, tho' he spent more time than ordinary in the Af∣fairs of the Government: yea, He employed his own <HI>Servants</HI> in those matters for which there seem'd a lack of <HI>Hands</HI>; and He fed many scores above an hundred, of those that were proper Subjects for his Invitations, out of his own Estate. It was not with any <HI>Va∣nity</HI> that He mentioned these things, but he brought them as a demonstration of his Desire, to ease the People of their <HI>Burdens.</HI></P>
<P>Our Text, is the <HI>Epiphonema</HI> of this Narra∣tive. No prudent <HI>Magistrate</HI> needs to be told that he ought to be a <HI>Man of Prayer:</HI> They that are to <HI>Act for</HI> God in Government should very much <HI>Be With</HI> God in Devotion. One of the greatest <HI>Magistrates</HI> that ever lived, could give that account of himself, in <HI>Psal.</HI> 109 4. <HI>I give my self unto Prayer</HI>: but the Words in the Original are so elliptical, as to be only thus much, <HI>I Prayer,</HI> as if he had
<PB N="6" REF="000538_0010_0FA6B4B4C280E268"/>
been all made up of <HI>Prayer.</HI> Such a <HI>Magis∣trate</HI> was our <HI>Nehemiah</HI> here; every business would he both begin and conclude with <HI>Prayer</HI>; and <HI>Prayer</HI> was like his very Breath, issuing from him with a constant Respiration. Tis one of his <HI>Prayers</HI> that we are now to be entertained with: We will suppose that he <HI>Pray'd in Faith</HI>; and so there are two or three things in the Prayer.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> We have the <HI>Declaration</HI> of a pious Ruler. He says, <HI>I have done for this people</HI>; he had been serviceable to the People of God. What had he <HI>done</HI>? Why, he had <HI>Addressed</HI> the King, on the behalf of his Ruined Coun∣try-men; he had undergone a Travel of many <HI>Leagues</HI> to promote their Safety; he had entred upon the Administration of the <HI>Government,</HI> when it would have broke the Heart of any man alive to have medled with it; he had parted with a large portion of his <HI>Riches,</HI> for the use of the Publick; he had born with great <HI>Abuses</HI> from his Enemies; and whatever he saw amiss in <HI>Church</HI> or <HI>State,</HI> he courageously set himself upon the Reformation of it· This had he <HI>done</HI>! But then,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We have his joint <HI>Supplication</HI> and <HI>Expectation</HI> thereupon. Sais he, <HI>Think upon me, my God, for Good, according to all this.</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="000538_0011_0FA6B4BA14619B08"/>
That Expression, <HI>Think upon me,</HI> may also be Translated, <HI>Remember me.</HI> And we may not imagine, that any thing is look'd for in a way of <HI>Merit,</HI> but all in a way of <HI>Mercy</HI> here. Hence we have it in those Terms, in Neh. 13.22. <HI>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and spare me according to the Greatness of thy Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>This prayer, is the Result of an observati∣on made, upon that <HI>Goodness,</HI> and <HI>Kindness, Pitty,</HI> which appears in the usual Providence of the most High, towards them that are ser∣viceable to the people of God.</P>

<P N="1">I. 'Tis to be taken for granted, as we go a∣long; That our God has, <HI>A People</HI> in the World; and indeed He <HI>ever</HI> had so. The World has always been Blessed with a <HI>People,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="000538_0012_0FA6B4BA481C62B0"/>
who have chosen the Lord Jehovah for their Best Good, and their Last End; <HI>a people</HI> who have chosen the Lord Jesus for the Redeemer of their Souls, <HI>a people</HI> who have Believed and Practised according to the Scriptures of Truth: 'tis the <HI>people,</HI> whose Denomination is that, in Isa. 63.18. <HI>The people of thy Holi∣ness</HI>; or Gods Holy People. The people of <HI>Israel</HI> was once His people, but upon their Abdication from God; we have now among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> a <HI>Surrogate Israel.</HI> Such a <HI>people,</HI> and a <HI>Church</HI> of them too, there has been upon Earth, in all Ages <HI>Visible.</HI> If the Ex∣istence of such a people were ever to be que∣stioned, it was when the barbarous and hor∣rible Darkness of <HI>Popery,</HI> had covered the face of <HI>Europe</HI>; and yet even then too, we are not at a loss to find such a <HI>people,</HI> in the very Bowels of the <HI>Papal Empire.</HI> The Po∣pish Historians themselves do confess, that the <HI>Waldenses</HI> were a <HI>people</HI> who from the ve∣ry days of <HI>Constantine</HI> had withdrawn from the conceived Corruptions in the Apostatical Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> Nor were they called <HI>Waldenses,</HI> because <HI>Waldo</HI> was their Father, but because they had their Dwellings in the <HI>Vallies,</HI> that are ever famous for them.</P>
<P>A <HI>People,</HI> implies a <HI>Multitude</HI> of men, and therewithal some <HI>Combination</HI> or <HI>Association</HI> of
<PB N="9" REF="000538_0013_0FA6B4BCD3642068"/>
them. Blessed be our God, there is a Num∣ber among the children of men, who by A∣greement, may be called, <HI>His.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. 'Tis also to be taken for granted, That every man should study to be <HI>Serviceable</HI> un∣to the people of God. This people, in its Militant Condition here, has many things to be <HI>Done</HI> for it; and our God hath so Dispo∣sed of us, as to make us need the Help one of another. The people of God may say unto us, as in Philem. 19.. <HI>Thou owest unto me, even thine own self.</HI> We owe the utmost Service unto the Great God, as our <HI>Creator</HI> and <HI>Preserver</HI>; but He has made His People the Receivers of his Rents; they have His Letter of <HI>Atturney</HI> for all the <HI>Goodness</HI> that <HI>we can extend unto them.</HI> The people of God are continually in circumstances, that call for the Assistence of all that are <HI>Well-affected unto the Dust of Zion.</HI> We cannot with any face pretend to be <HI>of them,</HI> if we now with∣hold, any of that care, or cost, or Time, with which we may be Serviceable to them. They make up, <HI>The Mystical Body of Christ</HI>; and we are worse than silver <HI>Hands,</HI> or woo∣den <HI>Legs,</HI> in that <HI>Body,</HI> if we are not so <HI>sen∣sible</HI> of, as to be <HI>Serviceable</HI> in, their <HI>Difficul∣ties</HI> It was for the <HI>Good</HI> of this people, that the Son of God, underwent all the Troubles
<PB N="10" REF="000538_0014_0FA6B4BDE7833048"/>
and Sorrows of His deep <HI>Humiliation</HI>; and we are None of <HI>His,</HI> if we count it any <HI>Humiliation</HI> unto our selves, to do any thing that may be for the <HI>Good</HI> of such a people.</P>
<P N="3">III. But the <HI>Main Assertion,</HI> which lies before us, is, That the God of Heaven has <HI>Good Thoughts</HI> for the men that study to be service∣able unto His People.</P>
<P>We are not so carnal, as to dream of a strict <HI>propriety</HI> in the Expression, when <HI>Thoughts</HI> are ascribed unto the Infinite God: The <HI>Thoughts</HI> are properly, those <HI>Conceptions</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Characters</HI> of Things, which the <HI>Under∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="7 letters" DISP="〈7 letters〉"/>g</HI> fetches out of the <HI>Imagination,</HI> in our Souls. But there is no such <HI>Composition</HI> in our God, as to Admit of any such Successive or Dependent <HI>Motions</HI> in Him, He is a <HI>pure Act,</HI> and when we call Him so <HI>pure</HI> a Thing as a <HI>Spirit,</HI> it is too <HI>Gross</HI> a Name to be taken without a Figure; 'tis but by way of <HI>Analogy</HI> and <HI>Similitude.</HI> By the <HI>Thoughts</HI> of God, then are meant, only those <HI>Acts</HI> of Him, which pass upon his Creatures. When we enquire, <HI>What Aspect the Almighty bears unto us,</HI> or rather, <HI>What Aspect He makes us bear unto Him,</HI> we ask after His <HI>Thoughts</HI> con∣cerning us. Well then; The <HI>Thoughts</HI> of God about the men that are serviceable to
<PB N="11" REF="000538_0015_0FA6B4BE0DD9DA48"/>
His people, are, <HI>For their Good</HI>; it imports, that God will favour such men as those, with such <HI>Acts</HI> of His, as may demonstrate his Good-will unto them. The Serviceable Man may say, <HI>My God will think upon me for Good</HI>; i. e. my God will <HI>Say</HI> that of me, and will <HI>Do</HI> that for me, which will be marvel∣lously comfortable. If we would know the <HI>Thoughts</HI> of God, we must look into the <HI>Words</HI> of God; there is a Rule Revealed un∣to us, by our God, according to which He will <HI>Judge</HI> of us, and He will <HI>Deal</HI> with us all; and if we would know the <HI>Thoughts</HI> of God, it is but seeing what that Rule does pronounce upon us. To that <HI>Rule</HI> therefore we will now repair; and we shall find that this <HI>Rule</HI> will enable Serviceable Men, to say as in Psal. 40.5. <HI>Many, O Lord my God, are thy Thoughts to us-ward: If</HI> I <HI>would speak of them, they are more than can be Num∣bred.</HI></P>
<P>Particularly,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The <HI>Good Judgment</HI> which God passes on them, is part of his <HI>Good Thoughts</HI> for the men that are <HI>Serviceable</HI> to his people. Our God is considered as a <HI>Judge,</HI> when <HI>Thoughts</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="000538_0016_0FA6B4BF4BBC3A08"/>
are Attributed unto Him here. What is the <HI>Good Thought,</HI> which God has for a man that studies to be Serviceable? It is, <HI>This man i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a good man.</HI> When <HI>Barnabas</HI> was endeavou¦ring to be <HI>Serviceable</HI> with a very mighty In¦dustry, there was that <HI>Thought</HI> presently en∣tred in the Book of God upon him, in Acts 11.24. <HI>He was a good man, and full of the Ho∣ly Ghost.</HI> Every man undergoes a Trial, by that God, whose <HI>Flaming Eyes do search and knit Eyelids T<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the Children of Man</HI>; and in this Trial, those men that study to Do much for the people of God, have a sentence passed on them, like that on <HI>Job, Behold, a perfect and an upright man!</HI> or like that on <HI>David, Behold, a man after Gods own Heart!</HI> or like that on <HI>Nathanael, Behold, an Israelite indeed!</HI> An Inclination to be <HI>Serviceable</HI> proceeds from such a <HI>Love</HI> to God, and such a <HI>Love</HI> to Christ, and such a <HI>Sympathy</HI> with His People, as will procure to a man, that place in the Divine Account, (1 John 3.14.) <HI>This man is passed from Death to Life; in as much as he Loves the Brethren.</HI> When a man shall always be <HI>Doing of Good,</HI> the God of Heaven gives this as a censure of him, <HI>Behold a man that has the Spirit of the Lord Jesus in him</HI>! The Ser∣viceable man discovers a <HI>good principle</HI> Reign∣ing in him; a principle of great Respect
<PB N="13" REF="000538_0017_0FA6B4C1A2836748"/>
unto the Interest of God; thence our God <HI>Thinks well of</HI> such a man; His <HI>Thoughts</HI> are, <HI>Here are one of those good men that are upright in Heart.</HI> It is not only a <HI>just</HI> man, but also a <HI>good</HI> man, that shall always be seeking to make many others the better for him.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The <HI>Good Purpose</HI> which God ful∣fils to them, is a further part of the <HI>good Thoughts,</HI> which He has for the men that are Serviceable to His People. Our God has <HI>Thoughts,</HI> that is, He has made both <HI>Purposes</HI> and <HI>Promises,</HI> to bestow wonderful Blessings upon the Serviceable man! The <HI>Thought</HI> of God is Transcribed into <HI>Prov.</HI> 28.20. <HI>A Faith∣ful man shall abound with Blessings.</HI> And who is the <HI>Faithful</HI> man, but one that studies to Do much for the People of God? Let us particu∣larly put into our own Language, a few of those <HI>good Thoughts,</HI> which God will have con∣cerning the men that are truly Serviceable.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> One <HI>Good Thought</HI> in the <HI>Purposes</HI> of God concerning them that are serviceable to His People, is, <HI>I will be the God of that ser∣viceable man.</HI> Behold, the most comprehen∣sive <HI>Good</HI> that can be <HI>Thought</HI> of! When our <HI>Nehemiah</HI> could say, <HI>I have done for this People,</HI> he could also say, <HI>Think upon me for good, O MY God.</HI> Why <HI>That</HI> is the <HI>Good</HI> which God
<PB N="14" REF="000538_0018_0FA6B4C1C00A2D78"/>

The Almighty God says to th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Serviceable man, as in Gen. 15.1. <HI>I am thy Exceeding Great Reward.</HI> He says, <HI>my power
<PB N="15" REF="000538_0019_0FA6B4C280E93B08"/>
shall be His to Releeve Him,</HI> and, <HI>my wisdom shall be His to Direct Him,</HI> and, <HI>my goodness shall be His to comfort Him.</HI> Such a man is wholly for <HI>God,</HI> and thereupon <HI>God</HI> will be for him; hence ever now and then in the Scripture, when a man was beginning to be more eminently <HI>Serviceable</HI> unto the People of God, we find the Lord comforting him with such a word as that. <HI>Fear not, I am with thee!</HI> Now who can wish for more than this? Here may I make a stop and say, <HI>Behold this is all my Salvation, and all my Desire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Another <HI>Good Thought</HI> in the <HI>pur∣poses</HI> of God, concerning them that are Ser∣viceable to His People is, I <HI>will make that Serviceable Man to be an Honourable Man.</HI></P>
<P>There are no small <HI>Honours</HI> in <HI>This World,</HI> which God <HI>Thinks</HI> to confer upon the man that shall study to be Serviceable. I will mention some of the <HI>Honours</HI> and the <HI>Roses</HI> that shall be cast upon such a man; whereof the <HI>First</HI> shall be This, That Wicked Men will Tra∣duce, Abuse, Malign such a man at a mon∣strous Rate; those Vassals of the Devil, can∣not but be in a Hellish Rage at any man that shall be <HI>Serviceable</HI> unto the Flocks of the Lord Jesus▪ of whom they would fain make a prey. 'Tis the property of those <HI>Tories,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="000538_0020_0FA6B4C340CE8B00"/>
that as in Neh. 2.10. <HI>It grieves them exceed∣ingly, if there come a man to seek the Welfare of the Children of Israel.</HI> Hence an <HI>Elijah</HI> shall be rail'd at as, <HI>A Troubler of Israel</HI>; a <HI>Paul</HI> shall be storm'd at, as. <HI>A mover of Sedition.</HI> They will invent all the ways imaginable to fix Reproach upon such a man; they will make <HI>Stories,</HI> and Forge <HI>Letters,</HI> and contrive a thousand shams; in hopes that some <HI>Dirt</HI> will stick, whereof they have <HI>Cart loads</HI> to spare. Such a man shall be, <HI>The Song of the Drunkard,</HI> and those people whose <HI>Tongues are no Slander,</HI> will try whether a <HI>Slander</HI> can't be fastned on him by the venemous <HI>Tongues,</HI> which they use as, <HI>their own.</HI> An <HI>Athanasius</HI> must be called a <HI>Sathanasius</HI>; A <HI>Calvin</HI> shall be made a Name for a <HI>Dog</HI>; An <HI>Huss.</HI> must be dressed with pourtraictures of <HI>Devils</HI> round about him; a <HI>Luther</HI> long since, and since <HI>him,</HI> a <HI>Voetius,</HI> may live to see horrible tra∣gical Romances printed of the Confusions befalling of them. If a <HI>Jeremiah</HI> be drawn forth into Service, notwithstanding that ex∣cuse of his, <HI>I am a Child</HI>; he shall soon have cause for that complaint, in Jer. 20.50 I <HI>heard the defaming of many, Report, say, they and we will Report it</HI>; if you will but form some <HI>Ill-Report,</HI> say they, Let us alone to blow it all about the Town▪ Pardon me,
<PB N="17" REF="000538_0021_0FA6B4C41D7DD9B8"/>
that I enumerate This among the <HI>Honours</HI> of a Serviceable Man. I should seriously exam∣ine, whether I had not been guilty of some great fault, if I should receive any Terms but those of <HI>Reproach</HI> from those <HI>Asps</HI> that rarely meet together but only to exchange <HI>Poisons</HI> with one another▪ And the Apostles were of this Opinion long before me, in <HI>Acts</HI> 5.41 <HI>They rejoyced, that they were counted worthy to suffer shame.</HI></P>
<P>But there is another <HI>Honour</HI> that the Ser∣viceable man is the Subject of; and that is, the <HI>Service</HI> it self, which God helps him to do: When God singles out a man for this and that <HI>Service</HI> to His People, 'tis an <HI>Honour</HI> from Heaven bestow'd upon him; the very <HI>Angels</HI> of the third Heaven do account it so. Tis a <HI>Disgrace</HI> inflicted by God upon a man when He so layes him aside, as to accept of no <HI>Ser∣vice</HI> at his hands; very dishonourable was the Fate of an unhappy Prince, whose Name you know, in <HI>Jer.</HI> 22.28 <HI>Is He a Vessel, wherein is no pleasure? wherefore they are cast out, he and his Seed.</HI> So tis a special and signal <HI>Honour,</HI> for a man to be remarkably serviceable in his Generation. They are the <HI>Atchievements</HI> or the <HI>Services</HI> of men, which afford unto them their only <HI>Honours.</HI> When the <HI>Honours</HI> of a worthy Person were to be recounted, we read
<PB N="18" REF="000538_0022_0FA6B4C504D98808"/>
in <HI>Acts</HI> 9.39. <HI>They shew'd what she had made.</HI> It is not, <HI>what we have got,</HI> but it is <HI>what w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have done,</HI> that renders us truly <HI>Honourable</HI> Now this is the priviledg of the <HI>Serviceable Man</HI>; when once the Heart of a man comes to be set upon the <HI>doing of good,</HI> commonly the good God will say upon it, <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, it shall be so: thou shalt e'en do what I see thy heart set upon.</HI> Tis the word of our Saviour, <HI>To him that has it shall be given.</HI></P>
<P>There is yet a further <HI>Honour</HI> befalling the Serviceable man; and that is, a preciou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Room</HI> in the Hearts of godly men. Those that are themselves <HI>the Excellent in the Earth</HI>· will count this man more singularly excellent, and will say of him, <HI>Thou art worth ten thousand of us.</HI> It was the comfort of a very Serviceable man, in <HI>Esth.</HI> 10.3. <HI>He was accepted of the multitude of his Brethren, and seeking the wealth of his People.</HI> Now <HI>Accept∣ance</HI> among truly godly men, is the truest <HI>Hon∣our</HI> in the World; and no perfume so sweet, as a good Reputation among them that have in them <HI>the Spirit of God. Austin</HI> I remem∣ber tells us, That the Emperour <HI>Theodosius</HI> reckoned this a greater Honour than his be∣ing <HI>Emperour.</HI> There is this peculiar Advan∣tage in it, That the Serviceable man, will have many <HI>vehement</HI> and <HI>effectual</HI> Prayers of

<HI>Righteous</HI> men, continually employ'd unto Heaven for him; of one such man 'twas said in <HI>Psal.</HI> 72.15. <HI>Prayer shall be made for him con∣tinually.</HI> The people of old, spoke a good word unto the Lord Jesus, for a certain Cap∣tain that had obliged them by being Service∣able; said they, <HI>He is a Worthy Man, that now wants thy pitty; for he loveth our Nation.</HI> If such a Man come into a <HI>Sickness</HI> they'l pray him well again, as once they did <HI>Epaphroditus</HI>; if he come into a <HI>Prison</HI> they'l pray him out again, as they did <HI>Peter</HI> once; whatever <HI>Di∣stress</HI> comes upon him they'l do him the <HI>Hon∣our</HI> to meet and <HI>pray</HI> for his Deliverance. Be∣hold an <HI>Honour,</HI> which all the Grandeurs of a Princes Court, are not to be compared with! It was thus esteem'd, by a Person of Quality <HI>once</HI> in this very place; who having been to visit a <HI>mean</HI> but a <HI>good</HI> man in his Diary for that day left this Reflection upon it; <HI>A glorious Saint makes a mean Cottage, a stately Pa∣lace.

<P>This <HI>Honour</HI> will attend him, while he is <HI>Alive</HI>; but after he shall be <HI>Dead</HI> and <HI>Gone,</HI> his <HI>Honour</HI> shall still out-live his Funeral; with considerable Augmentations of it. We

read of one very <HI>Serviceable</HI> person, in 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 32.33. <HI>All did him Honour at his Death</HI>; and we read of an Holy Minister, who had set himself to Serve the people of God, with great Hazard and Trouble, in the Princes Court, 2 Chron. 24.16. <HI>They buried him</HI> very Honourably, <HI>because he had done good in Israel.</HI> Men that are greatly Serviceacle, have this <HI>Honour,</HI> that as they <HI>Live Desired,</HI> so, they <HI>Dy<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lamented.</HI> The Tears of the most Honou∣rable Peasons in the Kingdom were once dropt at the Death of a Prophet which had been the <HI>Chariots</HI> and <HI>Horsemea of Israel.</HI> A Serviceable <HI>Josiah,</HI> shall be Honoured at his Death, with a <HI>Mourning,</HI> bitter enough to be made a <HI>Proverb</HI> for future Ages.

When <HI>Those that are of us, do build the old wast pla∣ces,</HI> and serve the Generations that come after us. But this is not all.</P>
<P>There are more glorious <HI>Honours</HI> in <HI>The World to come,</HI> which God <HI>Thinks</HI> to confer upon the Serviceable man. During the <HI>Day of Judgment,</HI> there are amazing <HI>Honours</HI> that such a man shall be partaker of. All the <HI>Service</HI> which is now done by him, shall then be <HI>published</HI> and <HI>proclaimed</HI> throughout the whole Church Triumphant; and as we are told, 1 Pet. 1.7. shall it be found unto <HI>praise and Honour and glory, at the appearing of Jesus Christ</HI>· We have not given a <HI>Cup of Water</HI> to a Disciple of the Lord Jesus, much less have we done a <HI>piece of Service</HI> for many such, but we shall hear of it again, at <HI>That Day,</HI> which, <HI>Do thou hasten, O our God!</HI> One of the chief Things then done in the <HI>New Jerusalem,</HI> will be to recount the <HI>Services</HI> that we have here been doing of; and the Lord Jesus will then make the Streets of that Hea∣venly City to ring with such Notices as

these; <HI>Behold, what Services were done for my people, by this my Servant, when he was a Soul∣dier in the former World</HI>! Yea, you must per∣mit me to tell you, Tha the <HI>Service</HI> which is now done, will be Requited with an Admis∣sion to a far <HI>greater Service</HI> in that <HI>great Day</HI> of God; for then shall be fulfill'd that Song of the Redeemed, Rev. 5.10. <HI>We shall Reign on Earth!</HI> Those dear men, whose Ambition here 'twas to be the <HI>Servants</HI> of every one, shall then be the <HI>Rulers</HI> and the <HI>Judges</HI> of the World; God will make them the <HI>Angels</HI> of the New World, as a Remuneration of their <HI>Services</HI> unto this; and they shall <HI>sit down with the Lord Jesus in his Throne.</HI> In my saying of which, I allow you to take me for such a <HI>Chiliast,</HI> as old <HI>Papias</HI> and <HI>Jrenaeus,</HI> and <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> professed themselves to be.

<P>That I choose to Rank the <HI>Good Thoughts</HI> of our God, mostly under the Head of <HI>Ho∣nour,</HI> is but an <HI>Accommodation</HI> of my Discourse unto the work of the Day before us. But</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> To speak summarily; There are all kinds of <HI>Gracious Thoughts,</HI> in the <HI>purposes</HI> of God for the Serviceable man; and it is easier to touch a little upon the <HI>general Quali∣ties</HI> of those <HI>Thoughts</HI> than to enumerate more <HI>specal Instances.</HI></P>
<P>In short then; The serviceable man may be brought into sore <HI>straits</HI>; and indeed, whoever plunges himself into the Interests of mankind, must find himself enough perplex∣ed and entangled with them. But yet he may refresh his own Soul with such a <HI>Thought</HI> as that, in Psal. 40.17 <HI>I am poor and needy;
<PB N="24" REF="000538_0028_0FA6B4CE879BB160"/>
yet the Lord Thinketh upon me</HI>· God has <HI>Thoughts</HI> for him; &amp; what kind of <HI>Thoughts</HI>?</P>
<P>Briefly,</P>
<P>They are <HI>Fatherly Thoughts</HI> which God has for the serviceable man; the Lord says of him, as in Jer. 31.20. <HI>He is my dear Son, he is my pleasant Child, I do earnestly Think upon him.</HI> The Beneficence of a serviceable man, renders him indeed the Genuine. Child of such a <HI>Father</HI>· Hence they are also very <HI>Merciful</HI> and <HI>Bountiful</HI> and Compassionate <HI>Thoughts</HI> which God has for him. 'Tis a full Text, in Jer. 39.11. <HI>I know the Thoughts that I think towards you, saith the Lord; Thoughts of Peace and not of Evil.</HI> The Lord seems to please Himself with His <HI>Thoughts</HI> for such a man; and calls him aside, as a Father will a Child, saying, <HI>Little do you know what I think to do for you.</HI> If one would in one word <HI>speak</HI> all that we can wish for, it were <HI>Peace</HI>; but <HI>That</HI> is it which God <HI>Thinks</HI> to bestow upon us.</P>
<P>More than this, They are <HI>Omnipotent Thoughts.</HI> It is said in Prov. 19.21. <HI>There are many Thoughts in a mans Heart; neverthe∣less the Counsel of the Lord, that shall stand▪</HI> Our <HI>Thoughts</HI> one for another are little fee∣ble insignificant things; but the <HI>Thoughts</HI> of our God are Effectual, and He sais, I <HI>will do all my pleasure.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="000538_0029_0FA6B4CF49A2A108"/>Once more; they are <HI>Everlasting Thoughts.</HI> The Lord says, in <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.20. <HI>I Remember him still</HI> that is, <HI>for ever.</HI> The Blessed God never has cause to say, <HI>my purposes are broken off, even the Thoughts of my Heart</HI>; nor is He liable to that Mischance which befalls the biggest Mo∣narch of the World, by the coming of a Day <HI>Wherein his thoughts do perish.</HI></P>
<P>To say no more, God will so <HI>Think</HI> of the Serviceable man, as to <HI>Hear</HI> him, <HI>Save</HI> him, <HI>Own</HI> him, <HI>Do</HI> all for him, that his <HI>matters may require.</HI> He is one that has many <HI>Thoughts</HI> of God; and we are told, in <HI>Mal.</HI> 3.16. There is <HI>A Book of Remembrance for him,</HI> and <HI>He shall be mine saith the Lord, in the Day when I make up my Jewels.</HI> It is reported of <HI>Tamerlain</HI> the War-like Scythian, that he had alwayes by him a Catalogue of the <HI>Services</HI> which any of his Followers had performed for him; the <HI>perusing</HI> of which, was his daily business in or∣der to the <HI>Requiting of them.</HI> A more de∣sirable <HI>Book of Remembrance,</HI> has our God, for those that are serviceable to His People.

There are Terrible <HI>Threats</HI> in the Book of God, which will discover the more Terrible <HI>Thoughts</HI> in the Heart of God against men of your Complexion: It is the Thundring voice of the Great God, in Psal. 34.21. <HI>They that Hate the Righteous shall be Desolate</HI>; and yet the Great Quarrel with <HI>New England</HI> has been, its having so many <HI>Righteous</HI> in it.

But why do I descend unto particular instances? All the Bible is full of that vengeance which falls upon the Heads of those that are Enemies to the people of God. We are assured in Psal. 105.14. <HI>He hath suffered no man to do them wrong, Yea, He has Reproved Kings for their sakes!</HI> What got the <HI>Egyptians</HI> by pursuing after the people of God into the <HI>Wilderness,</HI> whither they Reti∣red, that they might worship him?

<P>But if the <HI>Scriptures</HI> will not affect you; then I pray, look upon your own unhappy <HI>Predecessors,</HI> unto whom God has made this poor People such a <HI>Burdensome Stone,</HI> as to break the Backs of all that have been heaving at it.

<P>There are These Questions then which the rest of my Discourse must be placed on.</P>
<P>Our First Question is,</P>
<P><HI>What</HI> is to be Done for this People?</P>
<P>And the First Answer, That I should offer unto it is, <HI>We should set ourselves to Think, what we have to Do.</HI> We all have our <HI>Talents</HI> that ly by unoccupied, because we do no oftner <HI>Think</HI> what they be, and what is to be <HI>Done</HI> therewith. May we now like <HI>David</HI> of old, <HI>Sit down in our Houses,</HI> and Think, <HI>What is there that I may do for the House of my God</HI>? To be often contriving with our selves, <HI>What may I do for this people of God</HI>? is to have <HI>Good Thoughts</HI> in <HI>Our</HI> Hearts; and the Great God will have none but <HI>Good Thoughts</HI> in <HI>His,</HI> for the men that are much used unto such Noble meditations. Might we all be prevailed with all to <HI>Do This,</HI> we should soon see what <HI>Else to do</HI>; and I might spare all the rest that I have to say.</P>
<P>But if I must pass to a further Answer, it shall be This, <HI>Be sure Those things are to be Done for us, that Ill men, are most loth to have us do.</HI> The <HI>Antipathies</HI> of them that Hate us, will be a Notable Direction unto our <HI>Services:</HI> thus one of the Ancients argu∣ed,
<PB N="47" REF="000538_0051_0FA6B4F1CFD6EE80"/>
<HI>Christianity must needs be a good thing</HI>; why? <HI>Because</HI> Nero <HI>could not endure it.</HI> Those are usually the <HI>Best men,</HI> and the <HI>best things</HI> that are most bark'd at by men of a visible Impiety. We may then make our worst E∣nemies to <HI>Do</HI> for us, whether they will or no; and seth a Treacle out of the <HI>Vipers</HI> that are gnawing out our Bowels. We say, <HI>Malice is a Good Informer</HI>; may we take <HI>Information</HI> from the <HI>Malice</HI> of evil men; For, <HI>Fas est &amp; ab hoste doceri.</HI></P>
<P>But if you press me to a more particular Answer still; I will in one word express the most considerable Thing that is to be done for us; Tis, <HI>Reformation! Reformation! Re∣formation!</HI> We have many and many a time confessed, <HI>That our Apostasies from God have procured unto us all the Calamities, which we are now Groaning under.</HI> And we have lately had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very large Admonition from our Ho∣nourable Rulers, to <HI>Reform</HI> our many <HI>provo∣king Evils.</HI> O that all ranks and kinds of people among us, were in earnest about the universal <HI>Reformation</HI> of our Manners. When the French recovered <HI>Calice</HI> from the Hands of the English, a French Captain insultingly asked an English Officer, <HI>When shall we see you at</HI> Calice <HI>again?</HI> but he made that wise Repartie upon him, <HI>Sir, when your Sins come

to be greater than ours.</HI> Truly so, it must be ascribed unto the <HI>Greatness of our sins,</HI> that we are brought into any of our inconvenient Circumstances: and 'tis the voice of our God unto us, Lev. 26.23, 24. <HI>If ye will not be Reformed,</HI> I <HI>will punish you yet seven times for your Sins.</HI> We are beset with Devourers on every side of us, and the subduing of them all, would be to <HI>Do</HI> for us a great thing indeed▪ Behold an effectual way to <HI>Do</HI> it, in Prov. 16.7. <HI>When a mans Ways please the Lord, He makes even his Enemies to be at peace with him.</HI> A Prince in <HI>Germany</HI> hearing that a Neighbour Prince intended a <HI>War</HI> upon him, immediately set himself upon the <HI>Re∣forming</HI> of the people under his Govern∣ment; but this Adversary of his within a while after Enquired, What <HI>Preparation</HI> his Neighbour was making to oppose him, and being informed, <HI>That his chief Preparati∣on was Reformation,</HI> He Reply'd, <HI>Nay, then, let the Devil Fight him for all me, if he be at that, he'l be too hard for me to meddle with him.</HI> O That in like manner we were all very Busy, at <HI>Finding,</HI> and <HI>Mending,</HI> whatever the Holy God may be offended at us for; tis the sigh that the Compassionate God, is making over us, <HI>O that my people had hearkened unto me, and</HI> New England <HI>had wal∣ked
<PB N="49" REF="000538_0053_0FA6B4F338A97A58"/>
in my ways! I should then soon have sub∣dued their Enemies, and have turned my Hand against their Adversaries!</HI> Believe it, we don't begin at the <HI>right End,</HI> if here be not the Beginning of our Services for our Countrey.</P>
<P>If I might go on, to a second particular a∣mong the Things to be <HI>Done</HI> for us, I would propound, <HI>Vnion,</HI> and applaud <HI>Union,</HI> and I would invite you with a Blessed <HI>Harmony,</HI> to sing that Song, <HI>Behold, how good and how plea∣sant it is, for Brethren to dwell together in Uni∣ty! There the Lord commands the Blessing!</HI> The unreasonable <HI>Quarrels, Contentions, Animosi∣ties,</HI> that have been among us, must be apace extinguished, or <HI>silly Chickens</HI> that we are, we make our selves a <HI>prey</HI> to the Roman <HI>Eagles,</HI> and the Indian <HI>Vultures.</HI> Travel to the <HI>East</HI> or to the <HI>West,</HI> and see whether our Invaders have made any Impressions, but where the Divisions of the people had made them <HI>vul∣nerable.</HI> I remember old <HI>Austin</HI> tells us, that he came once into a City, where the people had a custome one day in a year to meet, and <HI>throw stones</HI> one at another, till many of them were killed; and yet because it was a <HI>Custome</HI> they would not leave it off. <HI>I</HI> beseech you let no <HI>such</HI> Thing be among the <HI>Customes</HI> of <HI>New-England</HI>! and let not the <HI>perverse Spirit</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> be found among us. 'Twas said, in
<PB N="50" REF="000538_0054_0FA6B4F56A785C38"/>
<HI>Hos.</HI> 10.2. <HI>Their Heart is divided, now they shall be found Faulty</HI>; and upon such a <HI>Fault</HI> it will soon be added, <HI>Now they shall be found undone.</HI> It was an Ancient Remark upon <HI>Old-England, Singuli pugnant, &amp; universi vin∣cuntur</HI>; it will be well if <HI>New-England</HI> may not imitate her Mother in it. Is there no <HI>Balm</HI> for our Wounds? Behold, The God of Heaven has been pouring <HI>Blood</HI> into them; and shall <HI>they</HI> Rankle and <HI>we</HI> Rangle still▪ The Romans had a Temple Dedicated <HI>Jovi Depositorio</HI>; the Senators went thither, and laid down their mutual Dissensions before they went into the Senate-house. O That we could now <HI>Depose</HI> all our own Little Hu∣mours, and <HI>Forgive</HI> one another, <HI>Love</HI> one a∣nother. <HI>Help</HI> one another, and Sacrifice all our passions to the Common Good!</P>
<P>There should have been at least one thing more entred into the Catalogue of our <HI>Fa∣cienda,</HI> and that is, The <HI>Regulation</HI> of our <HI>Plantations,</HI> as to several <HI>Disorders</HI> prevailing in them.</P>
<P>Of those <HI>Disorders,</HI> there is none more fa∣tal, than that so many of them, have Lived without the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of God among them. 'Tis probable, that a large part of the <HI>Americans</HI> are the Posterity of those <HI>Cana∣anites,</HI> who after the Wars of <HI>Canaan,</HI> did
<PB N="51" REF="000538_0055_0FA6B4F7BB629360"/>
set up their Pillars in <HI>Africa,</HI> with that Inscrip∣tion on them, <HI>We are of those that Fled from the Face of Joshua the Robber.</HI> But alas, there are found among us that are newly become <HI>Americans,</HI> Those of whom it may be said, <HI>They Fly from the Face of Jesus the Saviour</HI>; for they take pains to get where they can Enjoy Nothing of Him. God from Heaven has lately wit∣nessed against this wickedness, by destroy∣ing those <HI>Plantations,</HI> that had not His <HI>Defence,</HI> because they had not his <HI>Glory</HI> with them; and we are immeasurably sin∣ful, and absurd, if the Warnings affect us not. But is it not also possible to Settle and Endow <HI>Schools</HI> in all our <HI>Plantations</HI>; and therefore to <HI>Compact</HI> them from time to time into closer Cohabitations? Doubt∣less, men of ingenuity, might instruct us how at once we may <HI>Advance</HI> our Husban∣dry, and yet <HI>Forbear</HI> our Dispersion; and moreover at the same time fill the Countrey with a <HI>Liberal Education</HI>; the want of which, has a more <HI>Threatning Aspect</HI> on us, than the worst of our other circumstances. What more Desirable Thing is there to be <HI>done</HI> for us, than <HI>This?</HI> That our people may be, <HI>all Taught of God.</HI> And while we are thus <HI>Do∣ing</HI> for our selves, may we not leave <HI>Undone</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="000538_0056_0FA6B4F948C73528"/>
the work of Christianity among the poor naked woful <HI>Indians,</HI> that remain in our Neighbourhood; nor forget in the first place to <HI>Civilize them,</HI> that so we may the better <HI>Christianize them.</HI> A no less <HI>Honoura∣ble</HI> than <HI>Profitable</HI> Thing will be <HI>Done</HI> for us, if we suffer not that work to Dy, with the Late Reverend <HI>Apostle</HI> of it; and I therefore beg, <HI>That a Committee may immediately be Or∣dered to inspect and direct and report that Affair.</HI></P>
<P>There is one thing more to be <HI>Done</HI> for us; and I shall propound it in words like those of the Prophet, <HI>Deliver thy self, O</HI> New-England, <HI>from every thing that may make thee look like a Daughter of Babylon.</HI> I have the confidence to tell you, That the <HI>Mystical Babylon,</HI> is just entring into that <HI>Vintage,</HI> which will cause horrible and fiery plagues to im∣pend over the Heads of those that shall have the <HI>Superstitions</HI> of <HI>Popery</HI> polluting of them. We cannot more consult our own Welfare, than by such an entire and open Departure from <HI>Rome,</HI> as the Holy God will now speedily dispose the <HI>European</HI> World unto. I dare publish it, as my Humble Conjecture and Perswasion, <HI>That the last Slaughter of the Lords Witnesses, is over</HI>; and that we are got more than two years Depth, into those <HI>Earth quakes</HI> which will shake yet, until they have <HI>shaken</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="000538_0057_0FA6B4FA016B1538"/>
the <HI>Papal Empire</HI> to pieces, and <HI>shaken</HI> out the very Hearts of them, that shall not <HI>come out of her.</HI> If therefore we would be safe, at such a Time, the best thing to be <HI>Done,</HI> is this, <HI>Let us not so much as Touch the Unclean Thing, nor hide so much as a Rag or Pin of a</HI> Babylonish <HI>Garment</HI> with us. For the Children of this Countrey to maintain any part of the <HI>Romish Worship,</HI> would indeed be not only a wild <HI>Indiscretion,</HI> but also a vile <HI>Apostasie</HI>; and those persons are far from <HI>discerning the Signs of the Times,</HI> who think it worth the while for them now to forego that Great Antipapal Principle, <HI>That no party of men whatever, calling themselves, The Church have any just Authority, to appoint any parts or means of Divine Worship, which the Lord Jesus Christ has not in the Sacred Bible Instituted.</HI> Let us keep the <HI>second Command∣ment,</HI> and our God will <HI>show Mercy</HI> to us, for more than one Generation. If we cannot find that any <HI>Forms of Prayer</HI> were used in any part of the Church, until about <HI>Four Hundred</HI> years after Christ; nor any made for more than some single Province, until <HI>six hundred</HI> years; nor any <HI>imposed,</HI> until <HI>Eight hundred,</HI> when all manner of Abomi∣nations were introduced; surely it becomes <HI>Us</HI> to be particularly Averse unto <HI>such</HI> as may
<PB N="54" REF="000538_0058_0FA6B4FAC8B120D0"/>
have somewhat worse than their <HI>Novelty,</HI> to Create our suspicion of them; and it becomes us much more to be <HI>Non Conformists</HI> unto such other <HI>Church Rites</HI> therein advised, as were not so much as conceived, until the <HI>Man of Sin</HI> was born▪ Could I speak with a voice as loud as the <HI>Last Trumpet,</HI> I should not feat to tell you, The <HI>God of our Fathers</HI> will blast that <HI>Worldly Wisdom</HI> which counts it a con∣veniency for us to Dissemble our <HI>Non Confor∣mity</HI> to whatever <HI>vain Worship,</HI> has nothing but the <HI>Traditions of men,</HI> to be a Warrant for it.</P>
<P>But is there Nothing else to be <HI>Done</HI> for us? Yea, much more, than the Languish∣ments and Anguishes, which a sharp Sickness has newly cast me unto, have left me strength enough to mention. And some Things to be <HI>Done</HI> for us, were perhaps not so fit to be mentioned by one, whose profession obliges him chiefly to the <HI>Silver Trumpets</HI> of the Gospel. Nor will I think, with <HI>Cato,</HI> That I may not make a Speech, without that Conclusion, <HI>Carthage est Delenda</HI>; or saying, <HI>A Neighbour Country must be subdued.</HI></P>
<P>I shall therefore add no more, but what was required to be <HI>Done,</HI> in Isa. 37.4. <HI>This is a day of Trouble and Rebuke, wherefore Lift up thy prayer.</HI> O that the <HI>Spirit of Prayer</HI> were
<PB N="55" REF="000538_0059_0FA6B4FB817AEFD0"/>
mightily Awakened, in every corner of the Land! If our <HI>sinning</HI> (as one says) do not make us leave <HI>Praying,</HI> our <HI>praying</HI> will make us leave <HI>Sinning</HI>; and then <HI>All is well.</HI> We are in a Storm, wherein that call is justly gi∣ven to us, <HI>O awake, and call upon thy God:</HI> May we then <HI>awake,</HI> and be sending up that cry continually, <HI>Awake, awake, O Arm of the Lord, for our Help.</HI> May our Closets, our <HI>Hou∣ses,</HI> our smaller <HI>Meetings,</HI> and our greater <HI>Congregations,</HI> be filled with all sorts of <HI>Pray∣er</HI>; and may we with most Ardent Supplica∣tions represent the whole case of this Land, unto Him that is the <HI>Hope of</HI> New-England, <HI>and the Saviour thereof in the Time of Trouble!</HI> These are the Things to be <HI>Done</HI> for us.</P>
<P>But it is more than time to call for our Se∣cond Question; which is,</P>
<P><HI>Who</HI> are to <HI>Do</HI> these things?</P>
<P>Now in General, Here is <HI>Work</HI> for us <HI>All.</HI> We ought Every one of us to <HI>Serve our Gene∣ration,</HI> before we fall <HI>a sleep,</HI> or it will be but an uncomfortable <HI>Sleep</HI> that we shall fall into. We are, <HI>in Publico Discrimine,</HI> and that man is a <HI>Wen</HI> or a <HI>Scab,</HI> rather than a <HI>member</HI> of this <HI>Body Politic,</HI> who shall decline the Service of his Countrey.</P>

May <HI>That</HI> be <HI>Done</HI>; and may you contemn all the Opposition of Ill men in doing of it, what tho' you hear Hard Things?

<P>We are told in 2 Chron. 21.12. <HI>There came a Writing to Jehoram from Elijah the Pro∣phet; saying, Thou hast not walked in the ways of thy Father.</HI> It ha's been by all Interpreters Commonly Judged, <HI>That Elijah was now in Heaven when this Letter came from him</HI>; and <HI>I</HI> was my self of that Opinion, till the old Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, written, <HI>I</HI> suppose, by

<HI>Eusebius,</HI> ha's Inclined me to the Contrary· But, if our <HI>Fathers</HI> were to <HI>write</HI> unto us from that Heaven, unto which they are gone, I am thinking, <HI>What they would say?</HI> Would they not write in very Disgracing Terms unto us, and say, <HI>Alas, you don't walk in our wayes: we left in your Hands, a work to be done for the Peo∣ple of God; but you have thrown by that work, &amp; found something else to be concern'd about. We hop'd that you would have trod in our Steps, &amp; that we should have shortly congratulated your Ar∣rival to the Glorious place, which we are Triumph∣ing in; But we now fear, That we have dropt you and lost you forever: and that we shall never see you more, till we behold you wringing your Hands and Gnashing your Teeth among the Goats at the Left Hand of the Lord. Jesus in the Day of His Appearing.</HI></P>
<P>My Brethren, Tho' it may be said of us, <HI>They are a Generation of Sinful men risen up in the stead of their Fathers.</HI> Yet Oh Let it not be said, <HI>They Arose a Generation which knew not the Lord.</HI> It was a pungent word used by one on such a Day as this, <HI>That the Books to be opened at the last Day, will contain Gene∣alogies in them.</HI> How, How shall we hold up our Faces, when out of those Books it shall be Read; <HI>Such an one, the Son of such an one; His Father did much for the People of God; but he, Nothing at all?</HI></P>

<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> But the Things that are to be done for this people, come into no Hands either with more <HI>Opportunity,</HI> or with more <HI>Impor∣tunity,</HI> than into those Honourable Ones, which the <HI>Government</HI> of this Territory is now devolved into.</P>
<P>Tis to YOU, much Honoured, that I now Address my self; and I know not what better message to bring you, than This; That whereas you are the <HI>Ministers of God unto us for Good,</HI> He will certainly <HI>Think upon you for Good,</HI> according to all that you <HI>Do</HI> for His People here.

We do this Day commit ourselves unto your Care, and we will now look upon you as our <HI>Fathers.</HI> The first Thing that we ask you to do for us, is, <HI>Bless us, even us also O our Fathers</HI>; tis that you would carry us in the Arms of your prayers, unto that God, who has made us <HI>Yours.</HI> We besech you to take a froward and a sinful <HI>Congregation</HI> into your Arms, as <HI>Moses</HI> did of old; and not let the Great God <HI>Alone,</HI> till by your means He be∣come Favourable to us.

The Best and the Most that you can Do for us, is vigorously, and impartially to Execute the wholsome <HI>Laws,</HI> which the Successive <HI>General Courts</HI> have Enacted for the Suppression of all Vice among us; and to Encourage all Inferiour <HI>Officers,</HI> as Con∣stables, Jury-men, Tything men, in the Dis∣covering of all <HI>Offenders</HI> against those Holy <HI>Laws.</HI> You are doubtless perswaded, That a <HI>Feeble Executor</HI> of the Laws, is more Crimi∣nal than a <HI>Direct Violater</HI> of them; and it is the Expectation of the Almighty God, that e∣very man of you should approve himself a <HI>Phinehas,</HI> for zealous Testimonies against the Sins that bring Humane Society under the Blows of His provoked wrath.</P>
<P>Indeed, there is but onely this one word of
<PB REF="000538_0065_0FA6B5094D15A3D0"/>
God, that I am Sollicitous now to Entertain you with; tis that in Josh. 1.5, 6. <HI>I will not fail thee, nor Forsake thee; Be Strong, and of a Good Courage.</HI> May there be that <HI>Courage</HI> in you, as to forbear no Legal and Righteous <HI>Act,</HI> notwithstanding the Opposition of our In∣cendiaries; that <HI>Courage</HI> as to be Affrighted by no little Bug-bears from the doing of what <HI>must</HI> be done for the <HI>Common safety</HI> of us all. While you are obtaining the <HI>Good Thoughts</HI> of God for your selves, you will have cause to say before Him, as in Neh. 6.14. <HI>My God, Think thou upon those, that would have put me in Fear.</HI> But Oh let your <HI>Faith</HI> be above your <HI>Fear,</HI> in your doing of your Duty; and Re∣member that you are the <HI>Heart</HI> as well as the <HI>Head</HI> of all the People.</P>

more Emphasis, than that which both my <HI>Granfathers</HI> long since chose for the subjects of the Sermons they Preach'd upon such oc∣casions as that which we now have before us; that in Hag 2.4. <HI>Be Strong, Be Strong, Be Strong, for</HI> I <HI>am with you, saith the Lord of Hosts.</HI> May you be so <HI>Strong,</HI> as to wade through all that may be formidable to Flesh and Blood, and Exercising unto Patience; and so <HI>Strong</HI> while you sit at our <HI>Helm,</HI> as to Beleeve, that tho' the Divel may be so much a <HI>Divel</HI> still (for as <HI>Austin</HI> said unto the <HI>secure Chris∣tians,</HI> under the <HI>Christian princes</HI>; Let me tell you, <HI>The Divel is not turned Christian yet!</HI>) as to raise an horrible storm, for sinking of this Little Vessel, which ha's the Interests (not only of <HI>Cesar,</HI> but) of <HI>Jesus</HI> in the bottom of it, yet our Glorious Lord will sea∣sonably Awake for our Deliverance.</P>
<P>And at the same time also, may you <HI>Be Quick,</HI> and in all your Applications use that <HI>Expedition,</HI> which we so often miscarry by our failing in.

<P>These things have I spoken in <HI>Gods</HI> Name, and the <HI>Mountains of Israel</HI> will easily <HI>Hear</HI> what has been said; but, Much Honoured, vouchsafe to Hear a word or two in <HI>Mans</HI> Name, and I shall have done▪</P>

<Q><HI>Nothing</HI> that you do shall <HI>satisfie</HI> us; Let the <HI>Justice</HI> and the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of your Actions be never so profound, we will Calumniate all you do; All the <HI>Requital</HI> that we will make you for your indefatigable Endeavours to make us happy, shall be to <HI>Reproach</HI> you, and <HI>Expose</HI> you; whatever <HI>Disaster</HI> happen to us, we will presently say, <HI>'Tis you</HI> Moses <HI>that have killed the Congregation</HI>; and because the <HI>Indians</HI> Lay but as quiet in the Winter be∣fore the Revolution, as they have done a∣nother Winter since, we'l say, <HI>That the co∣ming of the Government into your Hands, is the cause of all the mischief which in the Sum∣mer they saw a Time to Do.</HI> We'l Refuse to bear any part of the <HI>Public Charges,</HI> and yet if the Drought of the <HI>Public Treasures</HI> make it imposible for you to do many Things that you are more forward than any of us to do, wee'l <HI>Article</HI> against you, because those

things are left undone. In a word, If we could but find a <HI>Captain,</HI> we would return into any <HI>Egypt,</HI> rather than under your Gui∣dance, Encounter the Difficultes of a <HI>Wil∣derness.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But, Blessed be God, There is among us, <HI>I</HI> Judge a Greater party of Sober, Discreet, Re∣ligious men; men that are True <HI>Englishmen</HI> and Right <HI>New-Englanders.</HI> Tis in <HI>Their Name,</HI> that <HI>I</HI> presume to say,</P>
<P><Q>From the very Bottom of our Souls, we Thank you, <HI>Our most worthy Patriots,</HI> for all your Studies in the Prosecution of our Pros∣perity. We will Beleeve your Actions to be <HI>Just</HI> and <HI>Wise,</HI> tho' our Distance at some times do not admit us to see the <HI>Reason</HI> of them. We will think; that you have <HI>Un∣derstanding in the Times,</HI> to <HI>know what we ought to do,</HI> and we will <HI>be at your Com∣mandment</HI>; nor will we be such Foolish and Absurd <HI>Members</HI> as to fall out with our <HI>Vitals.</HI> We will pray to our <HI>Wonderfull Councellor</HI> for your Direction in your Arduous Affairs every Day that comes over our Heads: and if in any thing you take a wrong Step, we will impute it unto the Defects of our <HI>Prayers.</HI> We will <HI>obey</HI> your Government while you <HI>Live,</HI> we will <HI>Embalm</HI> your Memory when you <HI>Dy</HI>; &amp; we will Hope to Spend a Blessed Eternity with you in Praises to God, for the <HI>Good</HI> which by your means, He ha's done unto us here</Q>
These are the Things which this Great Assembly, will add their Joyfull, <HI>A∣MEN,</HI> unto.</P>
