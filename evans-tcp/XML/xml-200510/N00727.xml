<P>AS the Great God, who at the Beginning said, <HI>Let US make man after our Image,</HI> hath made man a <HI>Sociable</HI> Crea∣ture, so it is evident, That <HI>Families</HI> are the <HI>Nurseries</HI> of all Societies; and the
<PB N="4" REF="000875_0003_0FAC943D6B5E4B80"/>
First Combinations of mankind. <HI>Well-ordered Families</HI> naturally produce a <HI>Good Order</HI> in other <HI>Societies.</HI> When <HI>Fa∣milies</HI> are under an <HI>Ill Discipline,</HI> all o∣ther <HI>Societies</HI> being therefore <HI>Ill Disci∣plined,</HI> will feel that Error in the <HI>First <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oncoction.</HI> To Serve the <HI>Families</HI> of our Neighbourhood, will be a Service to all our <HI>Interests.</HI> Every serious Chri∣stian is concerned, That he may be <HI>Serviceable</HI> in the World; And many a serious Christian is concerned, because he sees himself to be furnished with no more <HI>Opportunities</HI> to be <HI>Serviceable.</HI> Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> art thou not a Member of some <HI>Fami∣ly?</HI> If that <HI>Family</HI> may by thy means, O Christian, become a <HI>Well-regulated Family,</HI> in that point thou wilt become <HI>Serviceable</HI>; I had almost said, <HI>Incompre∣hensibly</HI> Serviceable. They that have the Government of some <HI>Family,</HI> do make up no Little part of this Great Assembly▪ And, Syrs, are there any of you, that would forfeit that Honou∣rable Title, of all the Faithful, <HI>The Chil∣dren of Abraham.</HI> Give your Attenti∣on, ye <HI>Children of Abraham,</HI> while I set before you, the Example of your <HI>Fa∣ther,</HI> for your Imitation.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="000875_0004_0FAC943E20599DC0"/>Our Glorious <HI>Lord-Messiah,</HI> is here going to Communicate unto <HI>Abraham</HI> some of His Heavenly Counsels. And we have a Text before us, that assigns a <HI>Reason</HI> for that gracious Communica∣tion. The <HI>Reason</HI> is, the care which this Good man, would thereupon take to bring up his <HI>Family</HI> in the Fear of God. In this Text there are some Remarkable Things: and things that some Wise men have often Remarked. There was an Excellent man, sometimes a Preacher of the Lord Jesus Christ, in this very place; whose custome it was, not only to Read a portion of the Scripture before his <HI>Prayers</HI> with his <HI>Family,</HI> but also to In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er and Apply brief <HI>Notes</HI> out of what he Read. He professed, That he found none of all his weary Studies in <HI>Divinity,</HI> so profi∣table to him, as this one Exercise, for the Rare and Rich Though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, which he therein found himself supplied withal▪ And he Declared,
<Q>That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Looked on it, as an Accomplishment of this very word; <HI>Shall I hide from Abraham, the thing which I do? I know him, That he will command his Children, and his Houshold.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="000875_0005_0FAC943FD96F8538"/>Moreover, You may here Observe a most comfortable Connexion, be∣tween, <HI>He will,</HI> and <HI>They shall.</HI> Saies the Lord, <HI>He will Command his Chil∣dren, and They shall keep the way of the Lord.</HI> It seems, If every one that is Owner of a <HI>Family,</HI> would faithfully <HI>Command,</HI> and manage those that be∣long unto him, thro' the Blessing of God, they would generally <HI>Keep His Way,</HI> and His Law. I find a famous Writer in the Church, therefore thus expressing himself;
<Q>If <HI>Parents</HI> did <HI>their</HI> Duties as they ought, the <HI>Word</HI> publickly Preached, would not be the ordinary means of <HI>Regeneration</HI> in the Church, but only <HI>without</HI> the Church, among Infidels: God would so pour out His, Grace upon the Children of His people, and Hear Prayers for them, and bless Endeavours for their Holy Education, that we should see the Promises made Good unto our Seed.</Q></P>
<P>We will now Dismiss these Reflecti∣ons; and Repair to that <HI>Grand Case,</HI> which hence offers it self unto us.</P>

<HEAD>CASE.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>What may be done by Pious Parents, to pro∣mote the <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Salvation</HI> of their <HI>Children</HI>?</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>The <HI>Case</HI> Enquires, <HI>What may be done</HI>? You'l take it for granted, that the Answer to it, will tell you, <HI>What should be done</HI>? For you'l readily grant, that in such an Important <HI>Case</HI> as this, All that <HI>may</HI> be done, <HI>should</HI> be done.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Case,</HI> We Enquire after what is to be done, by <HI>Pious</HI> Parents. <HI>Other</HI> Parents will take no due Notice, of the Injunctions that God has Laid upon them concerning their <HI>Children. Parents,</HI> If you don't first become your selves <HI>Pious,</HI> you'l do nothing to purpose to make your <HI>Children</HI> so. Except you do your selves walk in the <HI>Way of the Lord,</HI> you will be very careless about bringing your <HI>Children</HI> to such a Walk. It is not a <HI>Cain,</HI> or a <HI>Cham,</HI> or any E∣nemy of God; that will do any thing to make his Children become the <HI>Chil∣dren</HI> of God. The Psalmist, in Psal. 34.1, 4, 11. could first say, <HI>I'l bless the
<PB N="8" REF="000875_0007_0FAC94419F229C90"/>
Lord,</HI> and, <HI>I sought the Lord,</HI> and then he saies, <HI>Come ye Children, and I'l teach you the Fear of the Lord.</HI> O <HI>Parents,</HI> In the Name of God, Look after your own miserable <HI>Souls</HI>; How should those wretched people do any thing for the <HI>Souls</HI> of their <HI>Children,</HI> that never did any thing for <HI>their own</HI>?</P>
<P>In the <HI>Case,</HI> we Enquire, after what is to be done by <HI>Parents</HI> for their <HI>Chil∣dren.</HI> But let it be Remembred, That our <HI>Servants</HI> are in some sort likewise our <HI>Children.</HI> Our whole <HI>Houshold,</HI> as well as the <HI>Children</HI> that are our <HI>Off∣spring,</HI> are to be taught the <HI>Way of the Lord.</HI> An <HI>Abraham</HI> will have his <HI>Train∣ed Servants.</HI> We read concerning a certain Person of Quality, in 2 King. 5.13. <HI>His Servants came near and spake unto him, and said, My Father.</HI> Let not those of my Hearers, that are without such Invaluable Blessings of God, as <HI>Children,</HI> count themselves unconcerned in our Discourse, if they have any <HI>Ser∣vants</HI> under them. A considerable part of what is to be done for our <HI>Children,</HI> I pray, <HI>Masters,</HI> Think, as we go along; <HI>Think,</HI> without our particular Inculcati∣on, whether nothing of This may be
<PB N="9" REF="000875_0008_0FAC944236A814A8"/>

<HI>Education,</HI> that we should bestow upon our <HI>Children</HI>; They should <HI>Read,</HI> and <HI>Write,</HI> and <HI>Cyphar,</HI> and be put unto some Agreeable <HI>Callings</HI>; and not only our <HI>Sons,</HI> but our <HI>Daughters</HI> also should be taught such <HI>Things,</HI> as will afterwards make them Useful in their places.

<P>Now, Syrs, You will do well, to sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gle out some singular <HI>Charges</HI> of God, and calling your <HI>Children</HI> one by one before you, Lay those <HI>Charges</HI> upon them, in the Name of the God that made them, and obtain from them, if you can, a promise that they will Ob∣serve those <HI>Charges,</HI> with the Help of that God. I'l set before you, Three or Four of those <HI>Charges.</HI></P>
<P>Let one of your <HI>Charges</HI> upon your <HI>Children,</HI> be That in 1 Joh. 3.23. <HI>This is His Commandment, that we should Believe on the Name of His Son Jesus Christ. Charge</HI> them to carry their poor, guilty, ignorant and polluted and Enslaved Souls, unto the Lord Jesus Christ, that
<PB N="27" REF="000875_0026_0FAC958533747858"/>
He may <HI>Save</HI> them from <HI>their Sins,</HI> and <HI>Save</HI> them from the <HI>Wrath to come. Charge</HI> them, to mind how the Lord Jesus Christ Executes the Office of a <HI>Prophet,</HI> and a <HI>Priest,</HI> and a <HI>King,</HI> and Cry to Him, that He would Save them in the Execution of all those Blessed Offices.</P>
<P>Let another of your <HI>Charges</HI> be that in Hag. 1.5, 7. <HI>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Consider your Wayes. Charge</HI> them to set apart a few minutes now and then, for <HI>Consideration</HI>; and in those minutes, <HI>Charge</HI> them to <HI>Consider,</HI> what they have been doing, and what they should have been doing, ever since they came into the World, &amp; if they should immediately go out of the World, what will become of them throughout Eter∣nal Ages. I have Read of a <HI>Dying Pa∣rent,</HI> who laid this <HI>Charge</HI> upon his wild <HI>Son,</HI> That he would allow one quarter of an Hour every Day to <HI>Consider</HI> on something or other, any Thing, as his Fancy led him. The Young man ha∣ving for some while done so, at last began to <HI>consider,</HI> why his <HI>Dying Parent</HI> should lay such a <HI>Charge</HI> upon him This brought on so many Devout

Thoughts, that e're long, in the Con∣version of the Young man, the Desire of the <HI>Dying Parent</HI> was accomplished. Oh! If you could Engage your <HI>Chil∣dren</HI> to <HI>Think upon their Wayes,</HI> there would be Hopes of their <HI>Turning to God.</HI></P>
<P>But, Let a Third of your <HI>Charges,</HI> be that in Mat. 6.6. <HI>Enter into thy Clo∣set, and when thou hast shut thy Door, pray to thy Father that sees in secret. Charge</HI> them to Retire for <HI>Secret Prayer,</HI> every Day that comes over their Heads. Talk with them, till you see, that they can tell, what they should <HI>pray</HI> for: And then, often <HI>charge</HI> them to <HI>pray</HI> every day; yea, sometimes <HI>Ask</HI> them, <HI>Do you Remember the charge I Laid upon you</HI>? Ah, Parent, Thy <HI>Children</HI> will do well, while it can be said, <HI>Behold, They pray.</HI> And thy House filled with thy <HI>Childrens Prayers,</HI> would be better accommodated, than i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it were filled, with all the Riches of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>Let a Fourth of your <HI>Charges</HI> be That, in Prov. 9.6. <HI>Forsake the Foolish and Live. Charge</HI> them to avoid the snares of <HI>Evil Company</HI>; Terrify them with Warnings of those Deadly Snares.
<PB N="29" REF="000875_0028_0FAC9586CE653610"/>

<P>Shall I add; It is here intimated, That an <HI>Abraham,</HI> is to <HI>Command</HI> his <HI>Children,</HI> very particularly, about, <HI>The Way of the Lord. The Way of the Lord,</HI> is the <HI>Way</HI> of his Right, pure, <HI>Instituted Worship.</HI> Well then, <HI>Command</HI> your <HI>Children,</HI> That they don't Forsake the Holy <HI>Institutions</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, and Embrace a <HI>Vain Worship,</HI> consisting of Things that <HI>He</HI> never In∣stituted. There are some clauses in the <HI>Second Commandment,</HI> which in i∣mate, That if <HI>Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> would see the <HI>Mercies</HI> of God upon their <HI>Children,</HI> they must <HI>Charge</HI> them, to Worship God, only in those <HI>Wayes,</HI> of Worship, that God hath Appointed.</P>
<P>Thus keep <HI>Charging</HI> of your <HI>Chil∣dren,</HI> while you <HI>Live.</HI> And, if you are
<PB N="30" REF="000875_0029_0FAC958789B536D8"/>
capable so to Do, Do it once more with all possible Solemnity, when you come to <HI>Dy.</HI> The words of a <HI>Dying Parent,</HI> will probably be <HI>Living</HI> Words, and <HI>Lively</HI> Ones. When our Excellent <HI>Mitchel</HI> was a Dying, he let fall such a Speech as This, unto a Young Gentle∣man, that Lodg'd in his House, <HI>My Friend, As a Dying man, I now charge you, that you don't meet me out of Christ in the Day of Christ.</HI> This one Speech, brought into Christ, the Soul of that <HI>Young Gentleman!</HI> Truly, If your <HI>Dying Lips,</HI> may utter such <HI>Dying Words</HI> unto your <HI>Children,</HI> who can tell, but they may then be brought into <HI>Christ,</HI> if they were never so before! But, lest you should have no opportunity, to <HI>Speak</HI> in a <HI>Dying Hour,</HI> why should you not <HI>Write</HI> such Things, as you would have them to Think upon, when you shall be <HI>Dead</HI> and Gone?

Lord, and Implore His Blessing upon it. Let the <HI>Child,</HI> hear the Groans, &amp; see the Tears, and be a witness of the Agonies, wherewith you are <HI>Travailing</HI> for the Salvation of it. The <HI>Children</HI> will never Forget what you do; It will have a marvellous Force upon them.</P>
<P>Thus, O <HI>Parents,</HI> You have been told, what you have to do, for the <HI>Sal∣vation</HI> of your <HI>Children</HI>; and certainly, their <HI>Salvation</HI> is worth all of this!</P>
<P>Your <HI>Zeal</HI> about the <HI>Salvation</HI> of your <HI>Children,</HI> will be a symptome of your own <HI>Sincerity.</HI> A total want of that <HI>Zeal,</HI> will be a <HI>Spot</HI> upon you, that is not a <HI>Spot of the Children of God.</HI></P>
<P>God will Reward the <HI>Zeal.</HI> 'Tis very probable; That the <HI>Children</HI> thus cared for, will be the <HI>Saved</HI> of the Lord.

<P>And let it be Remembred, That the <HI>Fathers,</HI> are not the only <HI>Parents</HI> obli∣ged thus to pursue the <HI>Salvation</HI> of their <HI>Children</HI>: You that are <HI>Mothers,</HI> have not a little to do for the <HI>Souls</HI> of your

<HEAD>THE Duties of CHILDREN To their Parents.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>DEUT. XXVII.14, 16.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The Levites shall speak, and shall say unto all the Men of Israel, with a loud voice:</P>
<P>Cursed is he that setteth Light, by his Fa∣ther or his Mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Am going to Entertain you with a Discourse, that cannot have a fitter praeface, than those words, in Psal. 34.11. <HI>Come, ye Children, Hearken unto me, I will teach you the Fear of the Lord.</HI> The <HI>Children</HI> of my Neigh∣bours,
<PB N="39" REF="000875_0038_0FAC958EF533E368"/>
are now appearing among us; Yea. Our <HI>Little Ones</HI> are no <HI>Little part</HI> of the Assembly. And very many of these, are the <HI>Children</HI> of pious <HI>Parents,</HI> the <HI>Children</HI> whose Piety has therefore been fervently desired and required by their <HI>Parents. Come, ye Children, Hear∣ken to me</HI>; I will tell you, what you shall do, that your <HI>Parents</HI> may be Hap∣py in you, and that your own Happi∣ness may be secured and increased.</P>
<P>There was a Solemnity sometimes observed upon the Two Mountains of <HI>Ebal,</HI> and <HI>Gerizzim,</HI> in the Land of <HI>Is∣rael.</HI> On the Top of Mount <HI>Ebal,</HI> there stood <HI>Six</HI> of the Israelitish Tribes, and <HI>Six</HI> on the Top of Mount <HI>Geriz∣zim.</HI> Certain Levites with the Ark of God, in the Valley between them, di∣recting themselves unto Mount <HI>Ebal,</HI> with a Loud Voice, uttered very Di∣stinctly, no less than Twelve terrible <HI>Curses</HI>; unto which the Tribes on that Mount, made the very Heavens ring, with a dreadful, <HI>Amen,</HI> unto them. But between each of these <HI>Curses,</HI> the Le∣vites directed themselves unto Mount <HI>Gerizzim,</HI> with <HI>Blessings</HI> directly oppo∣sed unto those <HI>Curses</HI>; and the Tribes
<PB N="40" REF="000875_0039_0FAC958FE4795F30"/>
on that Mount, gave the Shout of a Joyful, <HI>Amen,</HI> upon them. 'Tis true, the Order prescribing the <HI>Blessings,</HI> is not so distinctly Recited by <HI>Moses,</HI> as that of the <HI>Curses</HI>; because 'tis Reserv∣ed as the Special Glory of our Blessed Lord Jesus Christ, and of His <HI>Glorious Gospel,</HI> to bring in the <HI>Blessings</HI> of Obe∣dience. Until the <HI>Gospel</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ arrive unto us, the <HI>Law</HI> does pronounce unto us nothing but <HI>Curses,</HI> we hear nothing but a <HI>Thunder of Wrath Cursing</HI> of us</P>
<P>The Second of the Direful <HI>Curses</HI>▪ which the <HI>Levites</HI> of God▪ facing to Mount <HI>Ebal,</HI> pronounced was, <HI>Cursed be he that sets Light by his Father or his Mother.</HI> Doubtless, when the vast Bo∣dy of people, as one man, replied, <HI>A∣men,</HI> upon it, it sounded like an horri∣ble Thunder-clap. Yea, but the Thun∣der-clap is not yet over; the peals of it, are this very Day to be again Sounded, in the midst of you, O Congregation of God. We read, that when the thing thus Appointed, was first observ∣ed, by the Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> in the Days of <HI>Joshua,</HI> [Josh. 8.35.] There were the <HI>Little Ones,</HI> in the <HI>Congregation.</HI> It
<PB N="41" REF="000875_0040_0FAC9590A123F688"/>

<Q>The Heavy Curse of God, will fall upon those Children, that make Light of their Parents.</Q>
<P>To <HI>Set Light</HI> by ones <HI>Parents,</HI> is in other words, to Treat them with any Ungodly <HI>Contempt:</HI> And, you mind it, <HI>My Children,</HI> that the <HI>Curse</HI> of God is denounced, not only upon <HI>Children,</HI> which cast Contempt upon their <HI>Fa∣thers</HI>: Oftentimes the <HI>Fathers</HI> have the Wisdom to keep up their Authority, and keep themselves above the <HI>Con∣tempt</HI> of their <HI>Children.</HI> But the <HI>Mo∣thers</HI> do more frequently by their Fond∣ness, and Weakness, bring upon them∣selves, the <HI>Contempt</HI> of their <HI>Children,</HI> and Lay themselves Low, by many Impertinencies. Now, behold, the Admonition of Heaven; the <HI>Children</HI> which cast Contempt upon their <HI>Mo∣thers,</HI> do also bring themselves under the <HI>Curse</HI> of God.</P>

Chil∣dren,</HI> I must be a little particular with you.</P>
<P>First. <HI>Undutiful Children,</HI> for the <HI>Sin</HI> of the <HI>Contempt</HI> they cast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon their <HI>Parents,</HI> are often <HI>Cursed</HI> by God, with b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g▪ Left unto yet <HI>more Sin</HI> against Him▪ I could not have spoken a more Terrible word! This is most certain, The more <HI>Sinful</HI> any man is, the more <HI>Cursed</HI> is that man. It is an amazing <HI>Vengeance</HI> of God, that gives a Sinner up to Sin for Sin, and <HI>Curses</HI> a Sinner for one Sin, by Leaving him to ano∣ther. But Undutiful Children, are commonly <HI>Cursed,</HI> and Banned by such a <HI>Vengeance</HI> of God. We read of some Sinners, whom the Justice of God, gives up to <HI>Sin</HI>; and this is one Brand upon those doleful Sinn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, in Rom. 1.30. <HI>Disobedient unto Parents.</HI> The <HI>Fifth</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="000875_0044_0FAC959450F74EB8"/>
Commandment stands in the Front of all the <HI>Six,</HI> upon the <HI>Second Table</HI> of the Law. <HI>Children,</HI> If you break the <HI>Fifth</HI> Commandment, there is not much Likelihood, that you will keep the rest; No, there is Hazard, that the <HI>Curse</HI> of God, will give you up to break every one of them all. <HI>Undutiful Children</HI> soon become horrid Creatures, for <HI>Un∣chastity,</HI> for <HI>Dishonesty,</HI> for <HI>Lying,</HI> and all manner of Abominations: And the <HI>Contempt</HI> which they cast upon the Advice of their <HI>Parents,</HI> is one thing that pulls down this <HI>Curse</HI> of God upon them. They who Sin against their <HI>Parents,</HI> are sometimes by God given up to Sin against <HI>all the world</HI> beside. Mind the most Scandalous Instances of Wickedness and Villany; You'l ordi∣narily find, they were first <HI>Undutiful Children,</HI> before they fell into the rest of their atrocious Wickedness.</P>
<P>Secondly▪ <HI>Undutiful Children</HI> for the Contempt they cast upon their Parents, are often <HI>Cursed</HI> by God, with a <HI>Mis∣chief</HI> brought upon all their Affayrs. A Strange <HI>Disaster</HI> uses to follow <HI>Undu∣tiful Children,</HI> much <HI>Evil pursues</HI> that

kind of <HI>Sinners</HI>; there is a secret <HI>Ven∣geance</HI> of God, perplexing their Af∣fayrs; thro' that <HI>Vengeance</HI> of God, None of their Affayrs do prosper with them. When <HI>David</HI> was vexed with one of his <HI>Undutiful Children,</HI> he could foretel, in Psal. 55.19. <HI>God shall Afflict them.</HI> There is a <HI>Secret Blast</HI> of God, upon <HI>Undutiful Children.</HI> They are <HI>Afflicted</HI> in their <HI>Estates</HI>: It is the <HI>Curse</HI> of God upon them, for their being Lothe▪ to do what they could for their <HI>Parents,</HI> with their <HI>Estates.</HI> They are <HI>Afflicted</HI> in their <HI>Bodies</HI>: It is the <HI>Curse</HI> of God upon them, for their Disho∣nouring the <HI>Parents</HI> of their <HI>Bodies. God Afflicts</HI> them with <HI>Reproaches</HI>: 'Tis the <HI>Curse</HI> of God upon them; They have <HI>Reproached</HI> or <HI>Despised</HI> their <HI>Parents.</HI> They are followed with one plague af∣ter another, by the Irresistible Wrath, and <HI>Curse</HI> of God: They can't compre∣hend, how they come to be so plagued in all their Interests: 'Tis it may be their <HI>Contempt</HI> of their <HI>Parents,</HI> that has, been the <HI>Worm</HI> at the <HI>Root,</HI> which cau∣ses all to wither with 'em. And if these <HI>Undutiful Children,</HI> ever Live to have <HI>Children</HI> of their own, God pays

'em home in their <HI>own C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in</HI>; God pays 'em in the <HI>Undutifulness</HI> of their <HI>own Children</HI>; In the <HI>Undutifulness</HI> of their <HI>own Children,</HI> God makes 'em, to <HI>possess the Iniquities of their Youth. Judah,</HI> cast Contempt upon his <HI>Parents,</HI> by Marry∣ing a <HI>Canaanitess,</HI> as it should seem without their Consent: God <HI>Cursed</HI> this <HI>Judah</HI> with a couple of Children, who were such Wretches, that the Im∣mediate Hand of Heaven, dispatch'd 'em out of the World. You have doubtless been inform'd of that famous History, in the <HI>Theatrum Historiae</HI>; A vile Son did once beat his old <HI>Father,</HI> and then Drag him to the Threshold of the House, by the Hair of the Head. Afterwards, when he grew <HI>Old himself,</HI> which by the way, was a <HI>Rare Thing</HI>!) his own Son did in like manner beat <HI>him,</HI> and then Drag him also, by the Hair of the Head, not only to the Threshold, but out of the Doors, into the <HI>Dirt.</HI> Hereupon he cryed out with Anguish, <HI>Ah!

<P><PB N="48" REF="000875_0047_0FAC959674730850"/>Thirdly. <HI>Death</HI>; Yea, an <HI>Early Death,</HI> and a <HI>Woful Death,</HI> is not seldom the <HI>Curse</HI> of God upon <HI>Undutiful Chil∣dren,</HI> for their being so. It is the Te∣nour of the <HI>Precept, Honour thy Father and thy Mother, that thy Dayes may be long upon the Land.</HI> Mind it, Children; Your <HI>Dayes</HI> are not like to be <HI>long upon the Land,</HI> if you <HI>Set Light by your Father, or Mother.</HI> When <HI>Absalom,</HI> with his Crue, was manifesting a Bloody <HI>Undu∣tifulnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> his offended Father praedicted thus much, <HI>That those bloody and crasty men, should not Live out half their Dayes.</HI> Why, he knew, that the very <HI>Finger</HI> of God, had once written as much as this comes to; <HI>That Children, which did not Honour their Parents, must not look to have the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Dayes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong in the Land.</HI> We have all heard the Fate of that <HI>Undutiful Absalom</HI>; now some Travellers Report, that in the place where <HI>Absalom</HI> was Buried, there is now a vast Heap of <HI>Stones,</HI> thus produced: It is customary for them, that go by the place, to throw a <HI>Stone</HI> upon it, using these words; <HI>Thus it shall be done unto the Son that Rebelleth against his Father.</HI> Stand still, O my Children,
<PB N="49" REF="000875_0048_0FAC959720603540"/>
and Look with Horror upon the Grave of <HI>Absalom</HI>: Read there, and see the <HI>Curse</HI> of God upon the <HI>Unduti∣ful. Children</HI> that cast <HI>Contempt</HI> on the <HI>Parents,</HI> who have been the <HI>Instruments</HI> of their <HI>Life,</HI> do thereby, what, but make <HI>Forfeitures</HI> of their <HI>Life</HI>? It be∣comes <HI>Children</HI> to reckon it one main Design, and Business, and priviledge of their <HI>Life,</HI> to be <HI>Comforts</HI> unto their <HI>Pa∣rents</HI>: When they cease to do so, God with a direful <HI>Curse</HI> often gives that Order about them, <HI>Take away the Life of that Undutiful Creature! That Crea∣ture shall no longer Live in the World.</HI> It was an <HI>Edict</HI> of Heaven, in Exod. 21.17. <HI>He that curseth his Father or his Mother, shall surely be put unto Death.</HI> And what shall then be done unto the <HI>Children,</HI> that prove <HI>Curses</HI> unto their <HI>Father,</HI> or their <HI>Mother? Undutiful Chil∣dren</HI> are so; But the <HI>Curse</HI> of God puts them to <HI>Death</HI> for it: And because those <HI>Undutiful Children</HI> are <HI>Wicked over much,</HI> therefore they <HI>Dy before their Time.</HI> Yea, 'tis no unusual Thing for the <HI>Death</HI> of <HI>Undutiful Children,</HI> to be Embittered with some Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raordinary Circumstances of Confusion and Cala∣mity.
<PB N="50" REF="000875_0049_0FAC959815014220"/>
I tell you, O <HI>Undutiful Children</HI>; There is Danger, Lest you be so <HI>Cursed of God,</HI> as to be <HI>Hanged on a Tree,</HI> at the Last. It is Remarkable, That the most of them, who are Executed on the <HI>Gallows,</HI> do at their Execution cry out of This: <HI>Oh, 'Tis my Undutifulness unto my Parents, 'Tis my Disobedience unto my Parents, that hath brought me unto this Lamentable End!</HI> It is a memorable passage, in Prov. 30.17. <HI>The Eye that mocks at his Father, and despises to obey his Mother, the Ravens of the Valley shall pick it out, and the young Eagles shall Eat it.</HI> It seems, an Untimely and a Tra∣gical Death, often Exposes the Carcases of those <HI>Children,</HI> to the Carnivorous Fowls of Heaven. There was a Law in <HI>Israel,</HI> Deut. 21.21. <HI>That the Rebelli∣ous Child should be put to Death.</HI> After <HI>Stoning,</HI> he was <HI>Hang'd</HI> up; for in <HI>Israel</HI> they <HI>Hang'd</HI> up none, till they had first otherwise kill'd him; and no doubt, his <HI>Corpse</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing taken down, as it was to be before <HI>Sun set,</HI> it was thrown into a Noted Pit, such an one as that, into which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Corps of <HI>Judas</HI> over the Precipice; &amp; there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fowls of Heaven prey'd upon it. <HI>Agur</HI> per∣haps
<PB N="51" REF="000875_0050_0FAC9598AE3C4DC0"/>
alludes to This; And we often see it so, that the <HI>Rebellious Child,</HI> is left of God, unto those Crimes, for which he is <HI>put to Death,</HI> e're it be long. More than so; <HI>Undutiful Children</HI> are <HI>Unnatu∣ral Children</HI>; And the <HI>Curse</HI> of God sometimes gives over <HI>Unnatural Children</HI> to commit the most <HI>Unnatural Murders.</HI> They have <HI>Murdered themselves,</HI> and been <HI>Self-Destroyers:</HI> and as they have Sinn'd against <HI>Nature,</HI> so they Dy the most <HI>against Nature,</HI> that can be.

<P>No; Lastly; All the <HI>Curse</HI> of God upon <HI>Undutiful Children</HI> hitherto, is but the <HI>Death,</HI> riding the <HI>Pale Horse</HI> in the <HI>Revelation</HI>; whereof 'tis said, <HI>Hell fol∣lowed.</HI> I am after all to tell you, That the <HI>Vengeance of Eternal Fire,</HI> will be the portion of <HI>Undutiful Children</HI> after all; <HI>Children</HI> that cast <HI>Contempt</HI> upon their <HI>Parents,</HI> God will cast into the <HI>Venge∣ance of Eternal Fire</HI> at the Last, and into

<HI>Everlasting Contempt.</HI> Surely, the <HI>Dam∣ned,</HI> are the <HI>Cursed</HI> of God! Hear, O Children; If you are the <HI>Children of Rebellion,</HI> the <HI>Curse</HI> of God will make you the <HI>Children of Perdition,</HI> through∣out Eternal Ages. <HI>Undutiful Children,</HI> what are they, but the <HI>Children of Be∣lial</HI>? This is as much as to say, They are the <HI>Children of Satan</HI>; and unto <HI>Satan</HI> they shall go. The Bible has call'd 'em, <HI>The Children of the Devil</HI>; And whither shall the <HI>Children of the Devil</HI> go, but into the <HI>Everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels</HI>? The <HI>Fiends of Darkness,</HI> will be the <HI>Ra∣vens,</HI> and the <HI>Eagles,</HI> that shall fasten their Talons, in the <HI>Eyes</HI> of those Children. When our Lord Jesus Christ, the <HI>Judge of the World,</HI> foretels, that in the <HI>Day of Judgment,</HI> having said unto those on His <HI>Right</HI> Hand, <HI>Come ye Bles∣sed,</HI> He will say unto those on His <HI>Left</HI> Hand, <HI>Depart, ye Cursed, into Ever∣lasting Fire, with the Devil and his An∣gels</HI>; He seems to allude unto the Action between <HI>Gerizzim</HI> and <HI>Ebal.</HI> Truly, the <HI>Children</HI> Damn'd of old, upon Mount <HI>Ebal,</HI> for <HI>Setting Light</HI> by their <HI>Father</HI> or their <HI>Mother,</HI> will be

were Parents more Happy in their Chiildren.</HI> O the <HI>Blessings</HI> that belong to <HI>Children</HI> of such a <HI>Character</HI>! If it might be said, as it was by <HI>David,</HI> when God gave him a Dutiful Son, that was to Build the <HI>Temple</HI> of the Lord; in Psal. 127.5. <HI>Blessed is the man, that hath his Quiver full of such Arrows,</HI>; Then surely, <HI>Bles∣sed are the Arrows, that are in the Quiver of such a man</HI>! The Holy Spirit of God sets a special Remark, upon that Com∣mand, which requires <HI>Children</HI> to be Dutiful unto their <HI>Parents:</HI> in Eph. 6.2. <HI>'Tis the First Command</HI> [of the Se∣cond Table] <HI>with a promise, That it may be well with thee.</HI> It shall be <HI>well</HI> with you, O ye Dutiful Children; you have the word of a <HI>God</HI> for it. You may note it, That in the Command, what we Translate, <HI>That thy Days may be Long,</HI> is to be read, <HI>That they may prolong thy Days.</HI> Who are those <HI>They? They</HI> are thy <HI>Father,</HI> and thy <HI>Mother.</HI> But how can thy <HI>Father,</HI> and thy <HI>Mo∣ther, prolong thy Dayes</HI>? How, but by <HI>Blessing</HI> of thee, in the Name of the Al∣mighty God. If the <HI>Dayes</HI> of such a Child be not <HI>prolong'd,</HI> we must allow a <HI>Sove∣raignty</HI> in such Dispensations of Heaven; but there is cause to hope, for such a

Child, that God has <HI>prolong'd</HI> his <HI>Dayes,</HI> in the Happiness of the Heavenly Word. This is plain; Those <HI>Parents,</HI> that are Blessed with Dutiful <HI>Children,</HI> do with an inexpressible Agony wish all sorts of <HI>Blessings</HI> to their <HI>Children.</HI> If it were in their power, to confer <HI>Bles∣sings</HI> upon their Children; Oh, how much would they do for them! Now because, 'tis in the power of God alone to confer <HI>Blessings</HI> upon us, these Pa∣rents go to God, for their Children, and they say with good old <HI>Jacob, God bless the Lads</HI>! I assure you, such Benedictions from <HI>obliged Parents,</HI> have a more than ordinary Authority, and Efficacy in them▪ For ones <HI>Parents</HI> to go before God, and plead, <HI>Ah, Lord, such a Child of mine, has Loved me, and Served me, and Helped me; and his good Carriage to me, has been such, that even upon that Account I have reason to wish him all the good in the world: I therefore bring that Child unto thee, and I pray thee to Bless him with all the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essings of Good∣ness</HI>: To be thus <HI>Blessed</HI> by ones <HI>Parents,</HI> O my <HI>Children,</HI> 'tis a thing of more value than if a rich <HI>Inheritance</HI> were to be received from them.

certain, There is no point of Religion, more certainly and commonly Rewar∣ded with <HI>Blessings</HI> in <HI>this world,</HI> than that of rendring unto <HI>Parents</HI> the Dues that pertain unto them. A signal Pros∣perity, even in <HI>this world,</HI> uses to at∣tend those <HI>Children,</HI> that are very Obe∣dient or Serviceable unto their <HI>Parents.</HI> Those <HI>Reckabites,</HI> that <HI>Obey the Command∣ment of their Father, Thus said the Lord of Hosts, They shall stand before me for ever.</HI> There are <HI>Children,</HI> who have with un∣speakable pleasure, supported their A∣ged <HI>Parents,</HI> in their Necessities; They have said unto their Necessitous Pa∣rents, like <HI>Joseph, Thus saith thy Son, come down to me, Thou shalt be near to me</HI>! I believe, There are some at this very Time, in this very place, who can say, <HI>That from the Time, they did for their Pa∣rents as they have done, God hath signally Smiled upon them.</HI> Friend, That Aged <HI>Father</HI> or <HI>Mother,</HI> in thy House, is not only the Glo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of thy House, but a better and a richer Thing than a Mine of Silver there.</P>

can be to <HI>Them.</HI> They will be so as Long as they live; yea, more than so; After your <HI>Parents</HI> are Dead and Gone, the Effects of their <HI>Prayers</HI> will yet Live: All the Prayers which those Gratified <HI>Parents</HI> put up for you, will be still Answering, after they are Dead, as long as you your selves do Live. <HI>David</HI> had been a Son, very Tender of his <HI>Parents:</HI> and now, says <HI>David,</HI> in Psal. 27.10. <HI>When my Father and my Mother for sake me, then the Lord will take me up</HI>: He'l Requite all tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I did for my <HI>Father,</HI> and my <HI>Mother.</HI> Shall I go a step further? When you your selves also are Dead and Gone, even <HI>Your Children</HI> may Reap the Fruits of what you did for <HI>your Parents</HI>: Your <HI>Posterity,</HI> may fare the better for your <HI>Dutifulness.</HI> The Jews have a Notion among them;
<Q>That for the sake of the Honour, that <HI>Esau</HI> paid unto his Father, the <HI>Israelites</HI> Long after might not Extirpate the <HI>Edomites,</HI> who were the <HI>Posterity</HI> of <HI>Esau.

Consider This, O Children; and <HI>Set not Light</HI> by your <HI>Parents.</HI></P>
<P>But being, by these Considerations prepared for it, it may now be Time to say;</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> The <HI>Respects</HI> that <HI>Children</HI> must render unto their <HI>Parents,</HI> are compriz∣ed in those <HI>Three Words, <HI>Reverence</HI>,</HI> and, <HI>Obedience,</HI> and <HI>Recompence. <HI>Children</HI></HI> do <HI>Set Light</HI> by their <HI>Parents,</HI> or cast <HI>Contempt</HI> on them, if they with∣hold any of these Three <HI>Regards</HI> from them: and the <HI>Curse</HI> of God, will Re∣venge the <HI>Contempt</HI></P>
<P>First, You <HI>Set Light</HI> by your <HI>Parents,</HI> if you withold from them, the <HI>Reve∣rence</HI> that is due unto them. The God of Nature hath placed a <HI>Distance,</HI> be∣tween <HI>Parents</HI> and their <HI>Children; Chil∣dren</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="000875_0059_0FAC95A1ECB459E8"/>
then <HI>Set Light</HI> by their <HI>Parents,</HI> when they Forget this Distance. There is first, an <HI>Inward Reverence,</HI> that <HI>Chil∣dren</HI> owe unto their <HI>Parents.</HI> It was Enjoyned in Lev. 19.3. <HI>Ye shall Fear, every man, his Mother, and his Father.</HI> Children, you <HI>Set Light</HI> by your <HI>Parents,</HI> if your minds are not Struck, with some awful Apprehension of their <HI>Superiority</HI> over you; if you don't see an awful <HI>Image</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> in their <HI>Superiority</HI>; if you don't look upon them, as the very <HI>De∣puties</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> in their several Families. But this <HI>Reverence</HI> must have some <HI>Out∣ward Expression</HI> given of it. There is an <HI>Outward Reverence,</HI> that <HI>Children</HI> owe unto their <HI>Parents.</HI> Hence 'tis said, in Mal. 1.6▪ <HI>If I be a Father, where is my Honour</HI>? Hence 'tis said, in Prov. 31.28. <HI>Her Chil∣dren Rise up, and call her Blessed.</HI> Their <HI>Speeches,</HI> both <HI>to</HI> their <HI>Parents,</HI> &amp; <HI>of</HI> their <HI>Parents,</HI> must be full of <HI>Reverence.</HI> When <HI>Children</HI> speak <HI>to</HI> their <HI>Parents,</HI> their Language must carry in it, some Ac∣knowledgment of their being such. Thus, in Gen. 31.35. <HI>She said unto her Father, my Lord.</HI> When <HI>Children</HI> speak <HI>of</HI> their <HI>Parents,</HI> they must show a con∣cern, that nothing Abusive be uttered.
<PB N="61" REF="000875_0060_0FAC95A285A9E7C8"/>
Thus, in Psal. 127.5. The <HI>Children of Youth,</HI> seem to Defend their <HI>Father,</HI> from the <HI>Enemies in the Gate,</HI> or, False-Accusers. And their <HI>Actions</HI> towards their <HI>Parents</HI> must yet more Emphatical∣ly <HI>Speak</HI> the <HI>Reverence,</HI> which they would Retain for them. Thus in Gen. 48.12. <HI>Joseph bowed himself, with his Face to the Earth,</HI> before his <HI>Father.</HI> Thus in 1 King. 2.10. <HI>Solomon Rose up to meet his Mother, and bowed himself unto her, and She Sat on his Right Hand.</HI> Now, Chil∣dren, you <HI>Set Light</HI> by your <HI>Parents,</HI> if you Talk Sawcily and Clownishly unto them; if you Reproach them, Defame them, and Backbite them; if your Behaviour towards them have any malapert Impudence in it. Though your <HI>Parents</HI> may give you never so <HI>much Occasion</HI> of Complaint, it becomes you to make as <HI>Little Reflection</HI> upon it, as ever you can. Say Nothing, but what the Glory of God makes it Ne∣cessary for you to say. Though they should happen to do you any Injuries, you may not show those Resentments, that you have upon the Injuries of o∣ther Persons.</P>
<P>Again.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="000875_0061_0FAC95A320871278"/>Secondly; You <HI>Set Light</HI> by your <HI>Parents,</HI> if you withold from them, the <HI>Obedience</HI> that is due unto them. If <HI>Children</HI> don't Study to Do, what their <HI>Parents</HI> would have them to do; and if the <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Will</HI> of their <HI>Parents</HI> have not the Force of a <HI>Law</HI> upon them, the <HI>Children</HI> do <HI>Set Light</HI> by them, in such a misbehaviour. It was de∣manded in Eph. 6.1. <HI>Children, Obey your Parents in the Lord, for this is Right</HI> Children, you <HI>Set Light</HI> by your <HI>Parents,</HI> if you don't count it a Right, a Just, a Fair Thing, and a Thing very Reaso∣nable, for you to be the <HI>Servants</HI> of them, who have done so much for you their <HI>Children,</HI> and beware of <HI>Crossing</HI> them, who have done so much to <HI>Com∣fort</HI> you. It was said, in Col. 3.20. <HI>Children, Obey your Parents in all Things, for this is well-pleasing unto the Lord.</HI> But, <HI>Children,</HI> You <HI>Set Light</HI> by your <HI>Parents,</HI> if it be not also very <HI>Well-pleasing</HI> unto <HI>You,</HI> to <HI>Please</HI> them, so far as without Sin you may do it; and if you be not unwilling at any Time, to give them any Displeasure. When the Father of <HI>Joseph</HI> laid his <HI>commands</HI> upon him, he
<PB N="63" REF="000875_0062_0FAC95A42CB298B0"/>
Obey'd those commands, though with the <HI>Risque</HI> of his very Life.

You are call'd upon, in Prov. 4 1. <HI>Hear, ye Children, the Instructi∣on of a Father.</HI> Most of all, in the Grand <HI>Motions</HI> &amp; <HI>Changes</HI> of your Life, <HI>Children,</HI> your <HI>Parents</HI> are to be con∣sulted, and the Satisfaction of your <HI>Pa∣rents</HI> is to be proposed. In your <HI>Call∣ings,</HI> and in your <HI>Matches</HI> especially, the Directions of your <HI>Parents</HI> must be of Exceeding Moment with you; Indeed Nothing should be done with∣out them! Wherefore, <HI>Children,</HI> you <HI>Set Light</HI> by your <HI>Parents,</HI> if you make nothing of their <HI>Commands,</HI> and if you tread their just <HI>Reproofs</HI> under foot. You <HI>Set Light</HI> by them, if you <HI>Leave Undone</HI> what they <HI>Desire,</HI> and much more, if you <HI>Do</HI> what they <HI>Forbid.</HI> You <HI>Set Light</HI> by them, if their <HI>Anger,</HI> be a <HI>Light matter</HI> with you.</P>
<P>Thirdly. You <HI>Set Light</HI> by your <HI>Pa∣rents,</HI> if you withold from them the <HI>Recompence</HI> that is due unto them.
<PB N="64" REF="000875_0063_0FAC95A6CF5F45B0"/>
Those <HI>Children</HI> Evidently <HI>Set Light</HI> by their <HI>Parents,</HI> who are Insensible of the Obligations which their <HI>Parents</HI> have laid upon them, or, who count any thing too much to be done by <HI>Children</HI> for their <HI>Parents.</HI> Of <HI>Joseph</HI> 'tis said, in Gen. 47.12. <HI>He Nourished his Father, &amp; all his Fathers Houshold with Bread.</HI> And it is elsewhere pressed upon us, <HI>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not thy Mother, when she is old.</HI> Chil∣dren, you <HI>Set Light</HI> by your <HI>Parents,</HI> if you don't <HI>Requite</HI> them as well as you can, and if you imagine that you ever can <HI>Requite</HI> them Enough. It was a Sad saying of <HI>Luthers,</HI> That <HI>One Father will more willingly maintain Ten Sons, than Ten Sons will maintain One Father.</HI> But those <HI>Children</HI> do <HI>Set Light</HI> by their <HI>Parents,</HI> who had not as liev maintain their <HI>Father,</HI> as maintain their <HI>Children</HI>; and who would not gladly be to their <HI>Mother,</HI> the <HI>Restorer of her Life,</HI> and the <HI>Nourisher of her old Age,</HI> as the Mother of <HI>Ruth,</HI> found her <HI>Son-in Law</HI> to be un∣to her. It was demanded, in 1 Tim. 5.4. <HI>Let the Children Learn to show piety at home, and Requite their Parents; for that is Good and Acceptable before God.</HI> Those <HI>Children</HI> have no <HI>Piety</HI> in them,
<PB N="65" REF="000875_0064_0FAC95A78188F5A8"/>

<Q>Many treat their <HI>Parents,</HI> as they do their <HI>Candles</HI>; they Set them in High <HI>Candle sticks,</HI> while they are full of Tallow, but when all their Substance is wasted, they tread them under foot.</Q>
And some there are, who do not <HI>Support</HI> their <HI>Parents,</HI> but <HI>Wrong</HI> them, and <HI>Rob</HI> them, and <HI>Pillage</HI> them; They <HI>Wast their Parents.</HI> Alas, Children, you <HI>Set-Light</HI> by your <HI>Parents</HI> in all of this <HI>Impiety.</HI> But Oh, don't <HI>make Light</HI> of this <HI>Impiety</HI>; Say, <HI>Destruction from God is a Terror to me</HI>!</P>

And, Oh, call it to mind the <HI>Example</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ. There never was in the world, so Dutiful a <HI>Son</HI> as <HI>He!</HI> We read in Luk. 2.51. <HI>He went down with</HI> His <HI>Mother,</HI> and His Reputed <HI>Father,</HI> and though they were very Low, in the World, <HI>He became subject unto them.</HI> We read in Joh. 19.27.

Oh, my Chil∣dren, I am afraid, I am afraid, there are some of you, that may read your Doom, in those Ominous words, in 1 Sam. 2.25. <HI>They hearkened not unto the voice of their Father, because the Lord would slay them.</HI></P>
<P>It is an unutterable <HI>Grief,</HI> that some of you give unto your pious <HI>Parents</HI>; They see, that you are still <HI>poor, carnal, and thoughtless</HI> Creatures: and that per∣haps a piece of gay Attire, is of more Account with you, than a <HI>Christ,</HI> or a <HI>Soul.</HI> 'Tis told them, That the <HI>Ungod∣ly Youths</HI> in the Town do horribly poi∣son one another.

to say, <HI>'Tis out of fashion to be of any Religion at all.</HI> So they insensibly draw one another on, to deride <HI>Seriousness</HI> in <HI>Religion,</HI> and the most Serious and Live∣ly Preachers of it; Until they become Idle, profane, Sottish <HI>Debauchees,</HI> and betimes Ripe for the <HI>Fiery Indignation</HI> of God.

<P>A Little Book to assist, <HI>The Educati∣on of Children,</HI> is now in your Hands. But can they be well <HI>Educated,</HI> if their <HI>Parents</HI> never send them to SCHOOL? This is a point, that seems now to call for some Inculcation.</P>
<P>A Good <HI>School</HI> deserves to be call'd, the very <HI>Salt</HI> of the Town, that hath it: And the <HI>Pastors</HI> of every Town, (who are▪ <HI>Sal Terrae,</HI>) are under peculiar obli∣gations, to make this a part of their <HI>Pa∣storal Care,</HI> That they may have a Good <HI>School,</HI> in their Neighbourhood.

<PB N="3" REF="000875_0081_0FAC95B6B9018568"/>
<HI>Schools</HI> to Languish under Discourage∣ments. If our <HI>General Courts,</HI> decline to contrive and provide <HI>Laws</HI> for the Sup∣port of <HI>Schools</HI>; or if particular <HI>Towns</HI> Employ their Wits, for Cheats to Elude the wholesome <HI>Laws</HI>; little do they con∣sider how much they expose themselves to that Rebuke of God, <HI>Thou hast destroy∣ed thy self, O New England.</HI> Would we Read, in the ancient Histories, how zea∣lous the more discreet <HI>Pagans</HI> were to maintain <HI>Schools</HI> among them; it might put us <HI>Christians</HI> to the Blush, among whom 'tis common for <HI>Schools</HI> to starve and sink; &amp; a mind sordidly covetous, <HI>Witholds more than is meet,</HI> but it tends unto what is Infinitely <HI>worse than poverty.</HI></P>
<P>Syrs, What will be the <HI>Issue</HI> of these Things?

<PB N="4" REF="000875_0082_0FAC95B7753AA5E0"/>
upon the Future State of</HI> New-England, lately published:
<Q>Where <HI>Schools</HI> are not vigorously and Honou∣rably Encouraged, whole <HI>Colonies</HI> will sink apace, into a Degenerate &amp; Con∣temptible Condition, &amp; at last become horribly <HI>Barbarous</HI>: And the first In∣stance of their <HI>Barbarity</HI> will be, that they will be <HI>undone</HI> for want of men, but not see &amp; own what it was that <HI>undid</HI> them.</Q>
You will therefore pardon my <HI>Freedom</HI> with you, if I Address you, in the words of <HI>Luther.</HI></P>
<P><Q>If ever there be any Considerable Blow given to the Devils Kingdom, it must be, by Youth Excellently Educa∣ted. It is a serious Thing, a weighty Thing, and a thing that hath much of the Interest of Christ, and of Christianity in it, that Youth be well trained up, and that Schools, &amp; School-Masters be maintained. Learning is an unwelcome guest to the De∣vil, &amp; therefore he would fain starve it out. But we shall never long retain the Gospel, without the help of Learning. And if we should have no Regard unto Religion, even the outward prosperity of a people, in this World, would necessarily require Schools &amp; Learned men. Alas, that none are carried with Alacrity &amp; Seriousness, to take care for the Education of Youth, and to Help the

World with Eminent and Able men.</Q></P>
<P>But the <HI>Freedom</HI> with which this Address is made unto you, is not so great as the <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rvour</HI> that has animated it. My Fathers, and Bre∣thren, If you have any Love to God, &amp; Christ, &amp; Posterity; let <HI>Schools</HI> be more Encouraged. If you would not betray your Posterity into the very Circumstances of <HI>Salvages,</HI> let <HI>Schools</HI> have more Encouragement.
