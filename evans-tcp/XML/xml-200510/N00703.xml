<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY Voyage hither from <HI>England</HI> was very tedious, and attended with great Hardships; but since my being among you I have endeavoured to redeem that loss of Time, by applying my self diligently to the Publick business, in Duty to His Majesty, and that I might be the better enabled to serve you.</P>
<P>I cannot but observe to you what a Legacy my Predecessor has left me, and what Difficulties to strugle with, A Divided People, an Empty Treasury; a few miserable, naked half-starv'd Souldiers, not half the Number the King allow'd pay for; the Fortifications, and even the Governours House
<PB N="2" REF="000849_0002_0FABA1449576D7B0"/>
very much out of Repair; and in a word, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> the whole Government out of Frame. To you therefore I recommend the consideration of those Disorders, as best becoming your Prudence to apply the proper Remedies, and you may be sure of my hearty Concurrence in every thing that will conduce to the extinguishing those Heats and Annimosities among you, which I fear have been of late years industriously cherish't and fomented, and to the the curing all the other Disorders and Mischiefs among you.</P>
<P>It hath b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n represented to the Government in <HI>England</HI>▪ That th is rovince hath been a noted Receptacle of Pyrates, and the Trade of it under no Restriction, but the Acts of Trade violated, by the Neglect and Connivance of those whose Duty it was to have prevented it. I hope <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> you will put all the Discountenance imaginable on that flagacious Crime of <HI>Pyracy,</HI> which is not only the worst sort of Robbery, but is, for the most part attended with the horrid Sin of Murder, which is a great aggravation of that odious Practice, detested by all the Civil Nations of the World. 'Tis not only injurious to the Honour of his Majesty, and the English Nation, but also highly prejudicial to the Trade of <HI>England,</HI> and par∣ticularly to the <HI>East-India</HI> Company. And the Gentlemen of the Council here present will bear me witness, that my Orders from his Majesty are very strict for enquiring into, and effectually preventing for the future that Lawless and Vile Trade of Pyracy within all my Government.</P>
<P>As I have declared my self against Pyracy, and all Unlawful Trade▪ so I must assure you I will giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you all the Encouragement I can possibly in carrying on a lawful Tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and every thing else that will make you Happy and Flourishing.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Speaker and you Gentlemen Representatives;</HI></P>
<P>I Hope you will take into your Consideration, That the Revenue is near expiring, and that you will provide for the Support of the Government for the time to come; and therein give me leave to put you in mind, that your Duty and Respect to his Majesty should be an agrument to you, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to leave the Government destitute. It would be hard, if I that come among you with an honest mind, and a Resolution to be just to your Interest, should meet with greater Difficulties in the discharge of his Majesties Service than those that have gone before me. I will take care there shall be no Mis application of the Publick Money: I will Pocket none of it my self, nor shall there be any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbezilment by others, but exact Accounts shall be given you, when and as often as you shall require.</P>
<P>I have ordered all the Accounts to be laid before you, that you may see the state of the Debts of the Government, and take such cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se for the Discharge of them as you shall think fit. I wish too you would consider how to restore Credit to the Government, which I understand is now very low, if not wholly lost.</P>
<P>I have ordered the Engineer to go and visit the Fronteers, and to report to me the State and Condition he finds the Fortifications in, which Report I intend for you, as soon as it comes to my hands.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I must remind you of the Necessity there is of finding out some Expedient to reconcile the Parties among you, I must own to you, I set
<PB N="3" REF="000849_0003_0FABA1464EE0FD90"/>
my heart so much on it, that I sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hink it the Glory of my Government to bring so good a work to pass I desire therefore you will think of the proper Methods to effect an entire Reconciliation among you To be of one Faith and one Mind is not only an excellent Scripture Rule, but also a good Maxim in Government. Union amongst a People is the Bound of Peace, and of strength too.</P>
<P>You cannot but know what Abuses have been formerly in Elections of Members to serve in the Assembly, which tends much to the Subversion of your Liberties. I do therefore recommend to you the making a Law to provide against it, and that you will think of such other Laws as you will stand in need of to secure to this Province a la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting Happiness, to which I promise you my Concurrence.</P>
<P>I shall conclude <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> with recommending that which is chiefly incumbent on us all, an inviolable Duty and Allegiance to his Majesty, who by his valour has rescued us from the two greatest Plauges that ever infested the World, <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Slavery,</HI> and by that, and his Wise and Temperate Government has secu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d us the free exercise of our holy <HI>Protestant Religion,</HI> the enjoyment of our Liberties and Estates. And as a further Instance and Illustration of the Glory of his Reign, His Majesty has, with repeated hazards of his precious Life, procured for Us and all <HI>Christendom,</HI> a Glorious Peace, for which, <HI>Gentlemen</HI> let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Address his Majesty, That he will be graciously pleased to accept of the tender of our most humble Duty and Thanks.</P>
