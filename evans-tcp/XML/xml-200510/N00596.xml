<HEAD>Observable Turns OF Providence.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Ezek. X.13.</HI></BIBL>
<P>As for the Wheels, it was cry'd unto them, in my Hearing, O WHEEL.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> is, by the Father <HI>Nazianzen,</HI> very justly call'd, <HI>A Beholder of Great Things.</HI> But some of the <HI>Great Things</HI> that were <HI>Beheld</HI> by that Blessed Seer, I must Invite you also, to <HI>Behold</HI> this Day; and the <HI>Great Things</HI> at this Day happening in the World, set an Edge upon this Invitation.</P>
<P>Of all <HI>Scripture,</HI> the deepest is that of <HI>Pro∣phesy</HI>;
<PB N="4" REF="000726_0003_0FAA451E31599F08"/>
of all <HI>Prophesy,</HI> the darkest is that of <HI>Ezekiel</HI>; of all <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> the Vision of the <HI>Wheels</HI> is not the least significant; but I say like <HI>Moses</HI> in another case, <HI>I will now Turn a∣side, and see this great Sight.</HI></P>
<P>The Prophet was to Represent unto his People, That the <HI>Protection</HI> which this People had hitherto Enjoyed, was now to be <HI>Remov∣ed:</HI> and that the Gracious and Saving <HI>Presence</HI> of God, was not so confined unto this Peo∣ple, but that it should be taken away. The Turn of <HI>Moveable Wheels,</HI> gave the Prophet, a Figure of this doleful Thing; but at the same time, in these <HI>Wheels,</HI> the State of the whole World, as under the Government of God, was figured out unto him. And it seems herein to be particularly Indigitated: That how well soever a Constitution of things in a Nation, may be established, the <HI>Angels</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, are able presently to Turn it up∣side down. This <HI>Hieroglyphical Vision</HI> of the <HI>Wheels</HI> had been granted unto the Prophet, once already; as you may read, in the first Chapter of his Prophecies: But when he now comes unto a <HI>Second View</HI> of it; he apprehends it more thoroughly, he expresses it more po∣sitively; and there occurrs in the Text before us, a further circumstance concerning them.</P>
<P>To give this Text a right posture in our Undestandings, Imagine that you see Four
<PB N="5" REF="000726_0004_0FAA451F06516E80"/>
most Illustrious <HI>Angels,</HI> which are called, <HI>The Chariots of God,</HI> Exhibiting themselves under the Characters with which the Cherubim were Pourtray'd in the Temple of Old. Imagine that by these Angels, you see Four, Large, High <HI>Wheels,</HI> each of them after the fashion of a <HI>Sphaere,</HI> with others transversly so Inlaid into them, as to intersect them with <HI>Right Angels.</HI> Unless you'l imagine a <HI>Chariot</HI> also implied in this Vision; which if so, you must not make the <HI>Wheels</HI> to be so <HI>Spherical.</HI> How∣ever then Imagine, that you hear the voice of our Almighty Lord Himself, making that Loud Cry unto them, <HI>O Wheel!</HI></P>
<P>There you have had the <HI>Vision.</HI> It is in the Interpretation of it, a Vision of the <HI>Turns,</HI> which the <HI>Providence</HI> of our God gives unto the <HI>World,</HI> in His <HI>Governing</HI> the Affairs of it. For the <HI>Cry</HI> it self, <HI>O Wheel</HI>; the word is not the same, that is used, when the Four <HI>Wheels</HI> here cried unto, are themselves described; but this word may be rendred, <HI>O World!</HI> An Intimation, that the State of Things in the <HI>World,</HI> is intended by the <HI>Wheels</HI> that we have now before us.</P>
<P>The <HI>Object</HI> of the Cry, is, <HI>The Wheels</HI>; but if you ask, Why such insensible things as <HI>Wheels</HI> have a Cry directed unto them? I think, 'tis to show, that all the Creatures, and all the Motions in the World, are under the Directi∣on
<PB N="6" REF="000726_0005_0FAA451FA25BDE30"/>
of our Heavenly Lord; there is the <HI>Voice</HI> of the Lord; both to, and in, all Second Causes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Witness</HI> of the Cry is, <HI>The Prophet</HI> him∣self; <HI>It was Cry'd,</HI> said he, <HI>in my Ears:</HI> which teaches us, that the Ministers of God should Mind what He is a doing in the World; and we should have our <HI>Ears</HI> open to the <HI>Voice</HI> of our Lord in all Great Events, yea, and our <HI>Mouths</HI> open to utter it unto others that are concerned in those Events.</P>
<P>Well then; I shall but <HI>Obey</HI> and <HI>Practise</HI> my Text, when I <HI>Handle</HI> it. Let me have your Attention unto a mighty <HI>Cry,</HI> even unto that <HI>Voice,</HI> which is heard in Heaven it self, and which the Lord from <HI>Heaven</HI> is at this Day causing to be heard through our <HI>Earth; O WHEEL! O WHEEL!</HI></P>
<P>There is this CASE, now before us, to be Considered;</P>
<P>What Observations are we to make upon the Ob∣servable <HI>TURNS</HI> of Divine Providence, in the Changes that come upon the World?</P>
<P>In a Psalm Composed, as is justly supposed, after <HI>Ezekiels</HI> Vision of the <HI>Wheels,</HI> and Refer∣ring to the Various Providences of God, wherein much of that Vision was accomplish∣ed,
<PB N="7" REF="000726_0006_0FAA452060B23D40"/>
the Psalmist has advised us, (<HI>Psal.</HI> 107.43) <HI>Whoso is Wise, will observe those things.</HI></P>
<P>Now the things which we will here observe, shall be all fetched from that <HI>Vision</HI> of the Pro∣phet; and you shall join with me in making of these Remarks.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> The <HI>World,</HI> with all the Persons, and all the Concerns of it, is liable to a continual <HI>Revolution</HI>; or, The <HI>State</HI> of the <HI>World,</HI> is fit∣ly compared unto the <HI>Turn</HI> of a <HI>Wheel.</HI> Brief∣ly, 'Tis a <HI>Changeable World</HI>; and I pray, what else would you have of a <HI>Sublunary</HI> One? Wherever you look upon any part of this <HI>World,</HI> you may hear the Son of God crying, <HI>O WHEEL,</HI> unto it; <HI>World, I will have thee to Wheel about▪</HI></P>
<P>One thing wherein you may see the Com∣parison adjusted, is this;</P>
<P>A <HI>Wheel</HI> is a very <HI>Moveable</HI> and <HI>Voluble</HI> Thing; and oh! believe it, oh! expect it; <HI>So</HI> is the State of this <HI>World.</HI> It is judged by good Historians, that <HI>Pythagoras</HI> was acquaint∣ed with <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> and that from this Vision of the <HI>Wheels,</HI> he invented that <HI>Wheel of Fortune,</HI> with which many Impious People do play their <HI>Witch-tricks</HI> in our Dayes. This I will now say, That Condition of men in the World, which they no less Foolishly, than Frequently, call, <HI>Their Fortunes</HI>; We may cry,
<PB N="8" REF="000726_0007_0FAA45211FDD64F8"/>
<HI>O Wheel,</HI> concerning it: it is, Oh! how <HI>Turn∣able</HI> a Thing! Very memorable &amp; significant, is the Story of <HI>Sesostrys,</HI> the King of <HI>Egypt</HI>; who being a Captive, was ordered, with o∣ther Captive-princes, to draw the <HI>Chariot</HI> of the Conqueror that made him so: In doing of this, he look'd so long and hard upon one of the <HI>Wheels,</HI> that the Conqueror demanded the cause of his Looking; whereto he replied, <HI>Syr, I am observing that in the Turn of the Wheel, what is undermost just now, by'nd by is uppermost</HI>: and this Reflection had a very mortifying O∣peration upon the Great man, to whom it was offered. So do things <HI>Turn</HI> in the World!</P>
<P>It is a famous Admonition, in Prov. 24.17, 18. <HI>Rejoyce not, when thine Enemy Falleth, Lest the Lord see it, and it Displease Him, and He Turn away His Wrath from him.</HI> Little Reason have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to see sad <HI>Changes</HI> come upon one a∣nother, without a charitable &amp; compassionate <HI>Sadness</HI> in their own Souls thereupon; when any man shall be so wicked as to <HI>Rejoice</HI> in the <HI>Fall</HI> of a Neighbour, probably the <HI>Wheel</HI> of the <HI>Wrath</HI> of God, will soon bring a worse <HI>Turn</HI> upon so Unthinking, so Depraved a Crea∣ture.</P>
<P><HI>Good</HI> Men, <HI>They</HI> find a <HI>Wheel</HI> in their Con∣dition. Holy <HI>Job</HI> was once a man of <HI>Sub∣stance,</HI> but anon, <HI>Poor to a Proverb</HI>: and yet,
<PB N="9" REF="000726_0008_0FAA45224F210048"/>
O WHEEL; it was not long before it came to that, in Job 42.10. <HI>The Lord turned the Cap∣tivity of Job.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bad</HI> Men, <HI>They</HI> too find a <HI>Wheel</HI> in their Con∣dition. We are told, in Prov. 20.26. <HI>A Wise King Scatters the Wicked, and brings the WHEEL over them.</HI> Our Blessed Lord Jesus Christ, the King of Heaven, is that <HI>King</HI>; His Wicked Enemies may arrive to an <HI>Heighth</HI> of Wicked∣ness and Advancement; but, O WHEEL, how strangely will He over-sett them▪</P>
<P><HI>Small</HI> Men, Tis in a <HI>Wheel</HI> that <HI>They</HI> have their Condition. It is a thing Celebrated in Psal. 113.7, 8. <HI>He Raises up the Poor out of the Dust, and Lifts the Needy out of the Dunghil; That He may set him with Princes, with the Princes of his People.</HI> Thus, the Son of a Poor <HI>Potter</HI> among the Ancients, was lifted up, from the <HI>Wheels</HI> wherein he shap'd his Clay, unto a Scepter. And, O WHEEL; The Son of a Poor <HI>Black∣smith,</HI> among the Moderns, was made One of the Greatest Men, and the Grand Instrument of the Reformation, in the English Nation.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Great</HI> Men, Tis in a <HI>Wheel</HI> that <HI>They</HI> have their Condition too. It is mentioned, as no Unusual Thing, in Job 34.24. <HI>He shall Break in pieces mighty men without Number, and set others in their stead.</HI> A Person may at one Time, have the People and Riches of more than Three Kingdoms under his Command, and yet
<PB N="10" REF="000726_0009_0FAA4522B10122B0"/>
littte while after have nothing to support him. Thus, <HI>Belisarius</HI> was one of the most Renowned Generals that have been seen among Mortal men; But, O WHEEL; this Renowned Per∣son may come to Beg by the Wall-side, <HI>Your Charity, Sir, to poor</HI> Belisarius!</P>
<P>Such a <HI>Vicissitude</HI> there is in Humane Affairs.</P>
<P>If you would see the Comparison further carried on, there is another thing to be Re∣mark'd; Namely,</P>
<P>That a <HI>Wheel</HI> often <HI>Turns Apace,</HI> when once <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t begins to Turn. And thus when the <HI>World</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon any Notable Alteration, tis no Rare thing for <HI>Quick work</HI> to be made of it. O WHEEL, What <HI>Quick</HI> Alterations dost thou hasten upon the World!</P>
<P>When the Lord is going to bring about any Promised and Marvellous Deliverance for His Church, He says of it, <HI>Though it Tarry, it will surely come, it will not Tarry</HI>; that is, when once <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ha's begun to <HI>Come.</HI> When <HI>Cyrus,</HI> a Pagan Prince, had once begun a Deliverance for the Church, by Proclaming a <HI>Liberty</HI> for them to fall upon Building the Temple, unto <HI>That</HI> some have applied that passage, in Cant. 2.8. <HI>My Be∣loved, Behold, He cometh leaping upon the Moun∣tains!</HI> And when the Lord is going to Ex∣ecute His Vengeance on His Adversaries, He sometimes does make a Wondrous <HI>Dispatch</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem; as He said once unto the Greatest man
<PB N="11" REF="000726_0010_0FAA45236A709FC0"/>
in <HI>Israel, In that Day, I will perform all the Things which I have spoken concerning his House; when I begin, I will also make an End.</HI> When the Judg∣ments of God come upon the Papacy, tis said, in Rev. 10.3. <HI>Seven Thunders utter their Voices:</HI> there shall be the Swiftness of Rapid <HI>Thunders</HI> in those Judgments. There is a <HI>Leap,</HI> as well as a Softly and Gentle <HI>Walk,</HI> of <HI>Providence.</HI> On the one hand, when a <HI>Joseph</HI> was Raised up to be the Saviour of <HI>Israel,</HI> tis said, <HI>They brought him Hastily to</HI> be preferr'd. On the other hand, the Plagues which were to come upon Oppres∣sors, tis said of them, <HI>They shall be as a Breach ready to fall, Swelling out in an high Wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.</HI></P>
<P>But will you Remark one thing more in this Comparison? If you will, it shall be This;</P>
<P>That a <HI>Wheel</HI> sometimes <HI>makes a Noise</HI> in the Turning of it: as you know the Prophet speaks of, <HI>The Noise of the Rattling of the Wheels.</HI> And thus, When any Considerable Men, or Things, in the <HI>World</HI> are turned up-side down; a <HI>Noisy Report</HI> accompanies it. Yea, a Considerable part of the <HI>Earth,</HI> sometimes does ring with the <HI>Report</HI> of Important Accidents. When some sort of Persons do fall, Tis said, <HI>The Earth is moved, at the Noise of their Fall.</HI> And shall I say it? So does <HI>Heaven</HI> too. Eminent Men of God have so comforted themselves, <HI>If any Ex∣traordinary Thing befall the Church of God in the
<PB N="12" REF="000726_0011_0FAA45241ED74F38"/>
World, after that I am Dead and Gone, the News will doubtless come to Heaven after me.</HI> However, we read, in Isa. 17.12. Of the <HI>Multitude of many People, which make a Noise, like the Noise of the Seas.</HI> And when the World is like the <HI>Sea,</HI> Ebbing and Flowing, and Rolling to and again, that <HI>Multitude of many People,</HI> will <HI>make a Noise</HI> about it. But then,</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> It is the Glorious Lord Jesus Christ upon the <HI>Throne,</HI> by whom all the <HI>Changes</HI> of this World, are Ordered and Managed. Who is it that Cryes unto the <HI>Wheels,</HI> O WHEEL? Tis He whom we may see, in Ezek. 1.26. <HI>The MAN above upon the Throne.</HI> Tis that <HI>God-Man,</HI> who Turns, who Checks, who Holds all the <HI>Wheels</HI> of <HI>Providence.</HI></P>
<P>All the Communion which the Great God now ha's with His Creatures, is by the Interpo∣sition of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> between Him and Them. Wherefore, tis fit that the <HI>Messiah</HI> so Circum∣stanced, should have the Government of all Creatures from and for the Great God, put into His Alsufficient Hands. And therefore there is a <HI>Mediatorial Kingdom</HI> which belongs un∣to the Lord Jesus Christ, as He is the Vice-gerent of God, by an Eternal Constitution. What the King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> said unto <HI>Joseph,</HI> was a <HI>Type</HI> of this matter; in Gen. 41.40. <HI>There is none so Discreet and Wise, as Thou art; Thou shalt be over
<PB N="13" REF="000726_0012_0FAA452577886E40"/>
my House, and according to thy Word, shall all <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People be Ruled.</HI> Even so hath the King of th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whole World said unto our Jesus, <HI>There is none <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Qualified for the Government of the World, as th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> art; and now I put all into thy Hands, for Thee <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rule the whole World, and all the changes of it.</HI> Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is the true meaning of that, <HI>Session at the Righ<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hand of God,</HI> which is all the Bible over ascribed unto our Lord. The <HI>Right Hand</HI> both in Scrip¦ture, and in Custom, holds the <HI>Scepter</HI>; In <HI>Sit¦ting at the Right Hand,</HI> the <HI>Scepter</HI> comes in di¦vided between both of Those that are upon the <HI>Throne</HI>; even such a Share in the <HI>Empire</HI> of the Universe, our <HI>Mediator</HI> now ha's with His Eter∣nal <HI>Father.</HI> Our Lord Jesus Christ is the <HI>Son</HI> of God and so He is, the <HI>Heir</HI> of all Things, the <HI>Lord of all.</HI> And by the <HI>Gift</HI> of God, further strengthened by His own Purchase and Merit on the <HI>Cross,</HI> His <HI>Title</HI> to His <HI>Throne,</HI> ha's further Considerations of Establishment. All <HI>Men,</HI> yea all <HI>Things,</HI> and so, all <HI>Changes,</HI> are now, at the Dispose of our Precious Lord Jesus Christ. And, <HI>O Holy Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts, the whole Earth, in all the Changes of it, is full of thy Glory.</HI></P>
<P>Behold, Christians, what a Consolation we have in the midst of all the <HI>Changes,</HI> which the <HI>Wheels</HI> of Providence do bring upon us! All these <HI>Turns,</HI> are Directed by our Lord Je∣sus Christ, who is <HI>Present</HI> every where to di¦rect
<PB N="14" REF="000726_0013_0FAA45267A0E51E8"/>
all exactly: Who has <HI>Power</HI> enough to pull down the biggest Mountains that oppose His Glory; <HI>Wisdom</HI> enough, to make all things work together for the Good of His Chosen; <HI>Justice</HI> enough to Protect the Righteous, and Revenge the Sinful. Yea, shall I speak the most Joyful Thing, that ever was heard! He that has call'd himself, our <HI>Master,</HI> our <HI>Bro∣ther,</HI> our <HI>Father,</HI> our <HI>Husband</HI>; He that has call'd us, <HI>The Apple of His Eye</HI>; 'Tis <HI>He</HI> that Sits upon the <HI>Throne</HI>; and effectually says to every <HI>Wheel,</HI> O WHEEL, <HI>O WHEEL, Turn such a way, for my Immortal Glory.</HI></P>
<P>I remember the Satisfactions of the Prophet <HI>Isaiah.</HI> There was a Time, when there were two Princes together Sitting on the Throne of <HI>Judah</HI>; one whereof, being Removed by the Stroke of Death, at a Time when there was a mighty party in the Kingdom, which desired further Alterations, that man of God was very Thoughtful, what Events the <HI>Wheels</HI> would now turn unto. But now, to satisfy him, he tells us, in Isa. 6.1. <HI>In the year that King</HI> Uzzi∣ah <HI>died, I saw also the LORD Sitting upon a Throne, High and Lifted up, and His Train filled the Temple. Josephus</HI> affirms, that in the <HI>Earth∣quake,</HI> which, we know, happened a little be∣fore this, an High Hill was torn down, and in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Rolling down, it spoiled the Kings House; but at the same time, it so rent the Roof of
<PB N="15" REF="000726_0014_0FAA452720850320"/>
the <HI>Temple,</HI> that the <HI>Sun</HI> shone into it. Yea▪ but our Prophet now sees the <HI>Sun of Righteous∣ness</HI> Himself come into the <HI>Temple</HI>; whatever happens, we may see our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Sitting upon a Throne, High and Lifted up.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> The <HI>Angels</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, those <HI>Mighty</HI> and <HI>Holy Spirits,</HI> of the <HI>Invisible World,</HI> have a wonderful Influence upon the <HI>Changes</HI> that come to pass in this World. This was what the Prophet here saw, in Ezek. 10.9. <HI>When I looked, Behold the four Wheels by the Cherubims; one Wheel by one Cherub, and another Wheel by another Cherub.</HI> Truly, there is an Inexpressible Agency of those <HI>Cherubims,</HI> the <HI>Angels</HI> of the Lord, in the <HI>Turns</HI> that the World is agitated with. As one ingeniously says, <HI>The Angels are capacious Wheels that move in the great Clock of the world</HI>; so, the <HI>VVheels</HI> of Providence are marvellously Turned, by the Ministry of those <HI>Angels,</HI> whom God hath made <HI>Ministring Spirits,</HI> and who wait about the <HI>Throne</HI> of our Jesus. When a Great Prince was to be Dethroned, by the Turn of these <HI>Wheels,</HI> it was said, in Dan. 4.23. <HI>A Watcher, and an Holy One came down from Heaven,</HI> to accomplish it; but that <HI>VVatcher</HI> was the <HI>Angel</HI> of the Lord. The Courts of <HI>Princes,</HI> are some of the principal <HI>VVheels,</HI> according to which the Concerns of men do <HI>Turn</HI> about: yea,
<PB N="16" REF="000726_0015_0FAA452823C26370"/>
but as there were <HI>Angels</HI> in the Court of <HI>Persia,</HI> to Steer the Minds, and bring the Fates of those that had any Business there, so 'tis in every other Court, unto this Day. The <HI>Living Creatures</HI> whom <HI>Ezekiel</HI> saw by the Wheels ma∣ny years ago, are <HI>Living</HI> to this Hour; &amp; they are to be the Officers of the Lord Jesus Christ in Turning the <HI>Wheels</HI> of <HI>this World,</HI> even until their Office be superseded by the Succession of the <HI>World</HI> to come. What said the Angel <HI>Gabriel,</HI> in Dan. 10.20. <HI>I will Return to fight with the Prince of Persia, and when I am gone forth, Lo, the Prince of Grecia shall come. Alexander,</HI> the King of <HI>Groecia,</HI> with an Army of about Thirty Thousand, Invades <HI>Darius,</HI> the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> though he had an Army of Six Hundred Thousand to withstand him; but the King of <HI>Graecia</HI> Conquers the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> and makes him Fly his Kingdom: Whence was this? O WHEEL! There was the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> in it all. The <HI>Angel</HI> who directed <HI>Cornelius,</HI> the <HI>Angel</HI> who Comforted <HI>Paul,</HI> the <HI>Angel</HI> who Assisted <HI>Elijah,</HI> the <HI>Angel</HI> by whom <HI>Daniel</HI> was defended, is Living still. The <HI>Angel</HI> who Restrained <HI>Balaam,</HI> the <HI>Angel,</HI> who Blinded the Sodomites, the <HI>Angel,</HI> who kill'd the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> and the <HI>Assyrians</HI>; that <HI>Angel of Death,</HI> is Living still. Now when such things as those, are to be done, in the <HI>Wheels</HI> of Providence; the <HI>Angels</HI> are the <HI>Ser∣vants</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="000726_0016_0FAA4528B7FA3728"/>
of the Lord Jesus Christ in the doing of them. Oh! Those <HI>Chariots</HI> of our God, even <HI>Thousands of Angels; The Lord is among them, as in the Holy Place:</HI> And when our dear Lord shall <HI>give the word, great will be the Company of them that publish it</HI>: If our Lord say, <HI>O WHEEL, Turn</HI> so, or so, there are <HI>Angels</HI> at hand, for the jogging of it.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> All the <HI>Quarters,</HI> yea, and all the <HI>Ages</HI> of the World, have all their <HI>Changes</HI> Governed by the Lord, whose <HI>Kingdom Ruleth over all.</HI> It is said, <HI>Behold, There were Four Wheels!</HI> How so? Truly, A <HI>Wheel</HI> for <HI>Europe,</HI> a <HI>Wheel</HI> for <HI>Asia,</HI> a <HI>Wheel</HI> for <HI>Africa,</HI> and a <HI>Wheel</HI> for <HI>Ame∣rica</HI> likewise; even poor <HI>America</HI> too, is not forgotten, or neglected, by the Providence of the Lord. We are assured, in Prov. 15.3. <HI>The Eyes of the Lord, are in every place, Behold∣ing the Evil and the Good.</HI> Whether the <HI>Chan∣ges</HI> do befal the <HI>Evil</HI> or the <HI>Good,</HI> it is the <HI>Wheel</HI> of the Lord <HI>in every place,</HI> that produces all. And <HI>America</HI> it self, tho' it have seem'd as if it had been intended for an Eternal Ran∣dezvous of <HI>Devils,</HI> until some late Symptoms of the contrary, yet the <HI>Changes</HI> that come up∣on <HI>America</HI> too, are by the Providence of God.

of Providence. Yea, probably there is a sig∣nal <HI>Wheel</HI> of Providence to be Turned yet in <HI>America,</HI> with respect unto the Kingdom of God. O <HI>WHEEL; Thou hast mighty Turns to make in these Regions!</HI> But Oh! Let us consi∣der all the Prosperity, and all the Adversity, <HI>happening,</HI> even to the Remotest <HI>Ends of the Earth,</HI> as not coming by <HI>Hap</HI> alone, but by the Watchful <HI>Providence</HI> of Him that <HI>performs all things for us.</HI> And as no <HI>Quarters</HI> of the World, so neither are any <HI>Ages</HI> of it, uncon∣cerned in the <HI>Wheels</HI> of <HI>Providence.</HI> There are as many <HI>Wheels,</HI> as there are to be Universal <HI>Empires</HI> before the Coming of the Lord, at the <HI>Time of the End</HI>: A <HI>Wheel</HI> for the <HI>Assyrian,</HI> a <HI>Wheel</HI> for the <HI>Persian,</HI> a <HI>Wheel</HI> for the <HI>Graeci∣an,</HI> and a <HI>Wheel</HI> for the <HI>Roman.</HI> The Provi∣dence of our Lord will reach the Circumstan∣ces of all Things, in all the Ages and Empires of the World; until the <HI>Kingdoms of this World, shall become the Kingdoms of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> There is a most surprizing <HI>Harmony,</HI> in those Dispensations of God, whereby the <HI>Changes</HI> of the World are brought about. Of the <HI>Wheels</HI> 'tis said, <HI>As for the Appearances, they Four had one likeness.</HI> The <HI>Wheels</HI> of Provi∣dence have a most <HI>Harmonious</HI> Conformity and Correspondence with one another.

Him,</HI> are the same Now, that ever they were; The <HI>Threatenings</HI> of God unto the <HI>Children of Disobedience,</HI> are the same Now, that ever. It is said, in Psal. 12.6. <HI>The words of the Lord are pure words, like Silver, well purified seven times.</HI> Now the Dispensations of God, are still accor∣ding to this His <HI>Invariable World.</HI> Things go in the World, but as they have done hereto∣fore; the World <HI>Changes</HI> but as it <HI>Uses</HI>; and, <HI>There is no New Thing under the Sun.</HI> O WHEEL, How hast thou <HI>Turned</HI> hitherto? Even so wilt thou still <HI>Turn.</HI> The Dispensati∣ons of Providence, in our Dayes, have <HI>One Likeness</HI> with such as were in the Days of our Fathers. They that have drawn <HI>Parallels</HI> in <HI>History,</HI> have Entertained us with a delicate Cu∣riosity; truly, 'twould be a curious Entertain∣ment, for a devout Soul, to draw the <HI>Parallels</HI> in <HI>Providence!</HI> But besides this, there is a more special <HI>Harmony,</HI> with which the <HI>Wheels</HI> of Providence, are sometimes beautified. As now, at or nigh the <HI>same Time,</HI> there sometimes is a <HI>Like Face</HI> of Providence, in <HI>sundry places.</HI> The same cry, O WHEEL, is given to <HI>sundry places,</HI> at the <HI>same Time.</HI> Sometimes, <HI>All the Churches together have Rest, and are Edified,</HI> tho' very distant from one another. Sometimes, <HI>All the Nations are together to take the Wine cup of the Fury of God,</HI> and be Intoxicated into Confusions, tho' far from one another in their

Distances. God Raises up <HI>Luther,</HI> a Great Reformer, in one Country; and at the <HI>very same Time,</HI> He Raises up <HI>Zuinglius</HI> in another. God permits the Rising of an <HI>Antichrist,</HI> in the <HI>West,</HI> namely, that of Popery; &amp; at the <HI>very same time</HI> he permits the rising of another <HI>Antichrist,</HI> namely, that of <HI>Mahometanism,</HI> in the <HI>East.</HI> Yea, it may be the <HI>Revolutions</HI> in some little Countries, will have just those very <HI>Marks</HI> imprinted up∣on them, which the <HI>Revolutions</HI> of Bigger, and Mother Countries, at the <HI>very same Time,</HI> are Signalized with.</P>
<P>And as at the <HI>same Time,</HI> so in like <HI>periods of Time,</HI> the <HI>Wheels</HI> of Providence that <HI>Change</HI> the World, sometimes have <HI>One Likeness</HI> in them. How amazingly was <HI>Eighty Eight</HI> in the former Century, and <HI>Eighty Eight</HI> in this, made an, <HI>Annus Mirabilis,</HI> a year of Wonders for the <HI>English</HI> Nation! The Dying Martyr <HI>Hus,</HI> told the Papists, <HI>Post Centum Annos,</HI>—just <HI>this Time Hundred</HI> years, you shall see my Do∣ctrine Revive among you. And in <HI>Luthers</HI> Preaching just an <HI>Hundred Years</HI> after, it Reviv∣ed accordingly. Yea, and what you saw, at <HI>Luthers</HI> Preaching, you'l see much of <HI>that,</HI> and more than <HI>That,</HI> in the <HI>Turn</HI> that is now going to begin! Let me say it, and bestow you, as <HI>deep a Meditation,</HI> and as <HI>close an Application,</HI> as you please upon it. When the <HI>Wheels</HI> of Pro∣vidence have brought about any <HI>Reformation,</HI> God ordinarily suffers those <HI>Wheels</HI> to Retard &amp;

Revert for a while, but afterwards, He will certainly set those <HI>Wheels</HI> a going again; and then, they shall have <HI>One Likeness</HI> with what they had before, only meet with no more such obstructions.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>VI.</HI> The <HI>Changes</HI> that come upon the World, have a <HI>various Aspect</HI> in them, they look more wayes than one. Of the <HI>Wheels,</HI> 'tis said, <HI>When they went, they went upon their Four sides</HI>: no less than <HI>Four</HI> several wayes one <HI>Wheel</HI> of Providence has its Tendencies. In one <HI>Turn</HI> of <HI>Providence,</HI> there may be what is very <HI>A∣flictive,</HI> and yet in the very same <HI>Turn,</HI> some∣thing that is very <HI>Merciful</HI>; or, as one speaks, <HI>One and the same Providence hath sometimes its Blacks and Whites</HI>: Thus, 'tis said in Isa. 57.1. <HI>The Merciful are taken away, The Righteous is ta∣ken away from the Evil to come.</HI> When <HI>Merciful</HI> and <HI>Righteous</HI> Men are <HI>Wheel'd</HI> out of the World, there is a <HI>double Aspect</HI> in it; First, there is a Blessing unto themselves in it, they are by the Swift <HI>Chariot Wheels</HI> of Heaven, fetch'd away thither, where the <HI>Weary are at Rest.</HI> But then, there is a <HI>Judgment</HI> upon the Survivers, who are now laid open unto more unhappy <HI>Changes,</HI> of <HI>Evil to come.</HI> The young Child of <HI>David</HI> was taken away by an Early Death: Why so? The <HI>Wheel</HI> turned on <HI>One Side,</HI> in that thing, to Chastise the Sin of the Relations; but on <HI>Another Side,</HI> it was to pre∣vent
<PB N="22" REF="000726_0021_0FAA452C5F1DBA90"/>
a perpetual Monument of <HI>Shame,</HI> and oc∣casion of <HI>War</HI> in the Nation. The best Child of <HI>Jereboam</HI> was taken away by an Early Death; why so? The <HI>Wheel</HI> turned on <HI>One Side</HI> for the Everlasting Happiness of the De∣ceased; but on <HI>Another Side,</HI> for the Hastening of Ruin on the Family. O WHEEL, How many <HI>Changes</HI> dost thou bear upon! Why is <HI>Jonah</HI> swallow'd by the <HI>Fish?</HI> It was to Cor∣rect him, it was to Reform him; yea, but, O WHEEL, there was more than this; it was to procure the Regards of the <HI>Ninivites</HI> unto his Ministry, when they heard of the Mira∣cle.</P>
<P>Hence there are also <HI>Collateral Designs</HI> of Providence, which are the <HI>Four Sides of the</HI> WHEELS, in the Dispensations of God. Thus 'tis, in the most of our <HI>Changes</HI>!</P>
<P N="7"><HI>VII.</HI> When the Lord will have <HI>Changes</HI> to come, they shall be <HI>Irresistible; Who hath Resisted His will?</HI> Tis once and again said of the <HI>Wheels, They Turned not, as they went.</HI> There is no <HI>Turn∣ing</HI> the <HI>Wheels</HI> of Providence out of their course; no <HI>Rubs</HI> can divert them, from what the Lord will have to be performed by them. All the <HI>Changes</HI> in the World, are Decreed by that Lord, who is <HI>Unchangeable</HI>; When the <HI>Wheels</HI> are Turning, tis by the Order of that God, of whom tis said, <HI>There is with Him no Shadow

of Turning.</HI> Our Lord says, O WHEEL! <HI>Go, bring such a Great Thing about!</HI> But, it may be, there are <HI>Great Mountains</HI> that ly in the way of the <HI>Wheels: Great</HI> Persons, <HI>Great</HI> Factions, and <HI>Great</HI> Oppositions. Its no matter: I say, as of old, <HI>Who art thou, O Great Mountain? Thou shalt become a Plain, before the Wheels of the Chariots of our God.</HI> It was said, in Zech. 6.1. <HI>The Four Chariots came out from between the Mountains of Brass.</HI> The Firm Decrees of God, are those Fixed, Stable, Eternal <HI>Mountains of Brass</HI>; the <HI>Four Wheels</HI> do move according to those De∣crees; and be of good cheer, none of our Lit∣tle <HI>Mountains of Earth▪ [Mountains!</HI> I should say, <HI>Molehills,</HI>] can stand before them. When the Scepter of of a mighty Kingdom was to be transferr'd, from a <HI>Royal Hand,</HI> into another Hand, which the Lord had Reserved in the Obscurities of a Wilderness, how many thou∣sands of Obstacles were there to hinder such a Turn of the <HI>Wheel?</HI> Yea, but when once the Lord said, O WHEEL! He also said, in 1 Sam. 15.29. <HI>He is not a man, that he should Re∣pent.</HI> Oh! The whirl of these <HI>Wheels</HI>! when once they are set a <HI>Turning,</HI> in a way of <HI>Grace,</HI> or in a way of <HI>Wrath,</HI> stand clear all Opposers; there is no standing before these all conquering <HI>Wheels.</HI> In Artificial Engines, the <HI>Mechanick Powers</HI> of <HI>Wheels,</HI> are of a prodigious Efficacy; but the <HI>Wheels</HI> of Providence are infinitely more Efficacious.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="24" REF="000726_0023_0FAA452DDE8779B8"/><HI>VIII.</HI> All the <HI>Changes</HI> of the World, have the Infinite <HI>VVisdom</HI> of Heaven, to give Me∣thod, Guidance, Effect unto them. Of the <HI>Wheels,</HI> 'tis said <HI>The Wheels were full of Eyes round about.</HI> The <HI>Wheels</HI> of Providence, do Turn as Regularly, as if they were all <HI>full of Eyes.</HI> Things are not carried on <HI>Caeco Impetu</HI>; 'tis not a <HI>Blind</HI> Chance, or Force, that brings things about. It is said, in 2 Chron. 16.9. <HI>The Eyes of the Lord run to and fro, throughout the Whole Earth, to shew Himself strong, in the behalf of them, whose Heart is perfect towards Him.</HI> Whatever <HI>Wheels</HI> do <HI>Turn,</HI> there are the <HI>Eyes of the Lord</HI> upon them, still to make them <HI>Turn</HI> for the Advantage of those that He has made <HI>His Peculiar Treasure.</HI> O <HI>WHEEL,</HI> wast thou not <HI>out of the way,</HI> when such, or such a Disaster happened? No, 'Twas <HI>Full of Eyes</HI>; the Mortal <HI>Wheel</HI> saw which way to go. We are too Ready to prescribe unto the Lord; we would have Him to <HI>Turn</HI> things after such or such a manner, for the Welfare of His Peo∣ple. But what need of our Impertinent Coun∣sels! Our Lord will do all things, <HI>According to the Counsel of His own VVill</HI>; and there needs no other <HI>Counsellor</HI>; that <HI>Will</HI> is the first Rule of all Right, for ever. <HI>Luther</HI> complain'd of him∣self, that he was too ready thus to Interpose his own Thoughts and Cares about the <HI>VVheels</HI> of Providence; but said he, <HI>Risit haud dubie
<PB N="25" REF="000726_0024_0FAA453004478138"/>
Dominus hanc sapientiam</HI>; doubtless, He that Sat at the great Council-Table of Heaven, derided my <HI>wise Contrivancies.</HI> Never let us vex our selves under our <HI>Changes</HI>; but think, <HI>The All-seeing Eyes of the Lord, see which way they go!</HI></P>
<P N="9"><HI>IX.</HI> In the <HI>Changes</HI> that come upon the World, there do occurr those things that are both <HI>Formidable</HI> and <HI>Extraordinary.</HI> There are two things noted about the <HI>VVheels,</HI> in Ezek. 1.18, 19. which we may joyn together, in our Observation. First, <HI>The Rings of the VVheels were so High, that they were Dreadful.</HI> And then, <HI>The Wheels were Lifted up from the Earth.</HI> Truly so, the <HI>VVheels</HI> of Providence are ever∣more so <HI>High,</HI> that we must not suppose our selves capable to <HI>Fathom</HI> them. One says well; <HI>I know no harder Task put upon the Sons of men, than to make a true Trutination, and a clear Cal∣culation, of Divine Providences.</HI> VVe should be very wary, what Constructions we make of <HI>Providences,</HI> and of the <HI>Changes</HI> which the <HI>High Ring'd VVheels</HI> do bring to pass: VVhen we go to Construe such a <HI>Turn</HI> as a <HI>Rebuking</HI> Pro∣vidence, or such a <HI>Turn</HI> as an <HI>Inviting</HI> Provi∣dence; or such a <HI>Turn,</HI> as an Encouragement; we should Remember, <HI>The VVheels are too High for us to take exact measures of them.</HI> And in the Turn of these <HI>VVheels</HI> also, very <HI>Dreadful Changes</HI> are sometimes produced. There are
<PB N="26" REF="000726_0025_0FAA4530B2A4DFD0"/>
<HI>Dreadful Concussions, Dreadful Confusions, Dreadful Desolations,</HI> brought about, by some <HI>VVheels</HI> of Providence; and because the <HI>VVheels</HI> are to <HI>Turn</HI> faster towards the <HI>Latter End of Time,</HI> there will now be more of those <HI>Dreadful</HI> O∣verturnings, wherein the <HI>Earth will be Removed, and the Mountains will be carried into the midst of the Sea, and the VVaters thereof will Roar and be Troubled</HI>! The <HI>Prayers</HI> of the Saints, have long been crying, O VVHEEL; but what will be the Answer of all? Even that, in Psal. 65.5. <HI>By terrible things in Righteousness, wilt thou An∣swer us, O God of our Salvation.</HI> Nor will the <HI>VVheels</HI> of Providence be confined unto the <HI>Ordinary Road</HI> of proceeding,. The Lord will not go by <HI>Ruled Cases,</HI> in many of the <HI>Changes</HI> that shall overtake the Children of men. The <HI>VVheels</HI> will be <HI>Lifted up,</HI> and <HI>unusual Turns</HI> will come about. VVhen K. <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. was Dead, the Popish Fathers, in the Council of <HI>Trent</HI> gave Thanks, that he had left such an Insigni∣ficant Successor, behind him; whereas, that Successor though a <HI>Child,</HI> gave the greatest VVounds unto the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> that ever had been given in the Nation. O VVHEEL! it so sometimes comes to pass, as the Prophet spoke, in 2 Kings 3.17. <HI>Ye shall not see VVind, neither shall ye see Rain, and yet the Valley shall be filled with VVater.</HI></P>
<P N="10"><HI>X.</HI> Finally, There are many <HI>Intricate</HI> Things,
<PB N="27" REF="000726_0026_0FAA4532AC32F4E8"/>
in the <HI>Changes</HI> of the World; and there is a <HI>Mystery of Providence.</HI> There is this Article, in the Description of the <HI>Wheels</HI>; They were, <HI>as if a Wheel had been in the midst of a Wheel.</HI> The <HI>Wheel within,</HI> is not always perceived, when we perceive the <HI>Wheel without,</HI> whereby <HI>Changes</HI> are brought upon us. It is said, in Psal. 97.1, 2. <HI>The Lord Reigns, let the Earth Rejoyce, Let the Multitudes of Isles be glad thereof; Clouds &amp; Dark∣ness are round about him.</HI> The <HI>Earth</HI> in General, it seems, and some special <HI>Islands</HI> of the Earth in particular, may meet with <HI>Changes,</HI> that shall have much of <HI>Clouds,</HI> and of <HI>Darkness</HI> in them; the Dealings, and the Designs of the Lord, in those <HI>Changes</HI> will be, Oh! how <HI>In∣scrutable</HI>! A <HI>Jacob</HI> is ready to say of the <HI>Changes</HI> that befal him, <HI>All these things are against me</HI>: but, O WHEEL! How gloriously did every thing <HI>Turn to Good</HI> at the last! I do offer you that Reading of what the Psalmist said, in Psal. 77.18, 19. <HI>The Voice of thy Thunder was in the WHEEL; Thy way is in the Sea, and thy path in the Great Waters, and thy Footsteps are not known.</HI> Why, when the <HI>Thundring Voice</HI> of God is cry∣ing, O WHEEL: We can't always Guess what <HI>Way,</HI> what <HI>Path,</HI> He will take.</P>
<P>But shall we Exemplify some of these <HI>In∣tricacies?</HI></P>
<P>There is that <HI>Intricacy</HI> in <HI>Providence,</HI> That our Lord is doing very <HI>Much,</HI> when He seems
<PB N="28" REF="000726_0027_0FAA45331FA35998"/>
to be doing <HI>Little</HI> or <HI>Nothing</HI> in the World. When <HI>Pharaohs</HI> Daughter took first Cognisance of <HI>Moses,</HI> who dream't of the <HI>Wheel in the midst of this Wheel</HI>; that this <HI>Moses</HI> was to destroy <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his <HI>Egyptians</HI>?</P>
<P>There is that <HI>Intricacy</HI> in <HI>Providence,</HI> That Men shall do the <HI>Lords Business</HI> when they go on their <HI>own Errands.</HI> The King of <HI>Persia,</HI> was a Ravenous Bird, who did but gratify his own Ambitious, Coveteous, Revengful <HI>Appetites,</HI> in Preying upon his Neighbours; Yea, but, there was another <HI>Wheel in the midst of this Wheel</HI>; the Lord said, <HI>It is I that have called this Ravenous Bird, from the East; the man that Exe∣cuteth my Counsel, from a far Country.</HI></P>
<P>There is that <HI>Intricacy</HI> in <HI>Providence,</HI> That the Lord leads men by what they <HI>See,</HI> to what they never <HI>Thought.</HI> The <HI>Philistines</HI> commence a War against the <HI>Israelites</HI>; Why, but only from a Disposition to oppress their Neigh∣bours? Yea, but there was a <HI>Wheel in the midst of this Wheel,</HI> all the while; the Lord caused the Kingdom of His <HI>David,</HI> thereby to be promoted.</P>
<P>There is that <HI>Intricacy</HI> in <HI>Providence,</HI> That a <HI>Mischief</HI> shall become a <HI>Kindness,</HI> when the Lord will have it so. The Persecution that befel the Primitive Believers, look'd like a Disaster and Injury to the Interest of the Gospel; Yea, but there was a <HI>Wheel in the midst of this Wheel</HI>;
<PB N="29" REF="000726_0028_0FAA4533E35D2D48"/>
the <HI>Scatterirg</HI> of those Believers, prov'd but the <HI>Spreading</HI> of the Gospel.</P>
<P>There is that <HI>Intricacy</HI> in <HI>Providence,</HI> That the Enemies of God shall be <HI>Confounded</HI> by those very means, by which they look to be <HI>Preser∣ved. Abimeleck</HI> accommodates himself unto the <HI>Shechemites,</HI> and that he might procure &amp; secure the Kingdom to himself, he gets into their <HI>Box</HI> as much as ever he can; but there was a <HI>Wheel in the midst of this Wheel,</HI> which in the Issue carried all another way: <HI>Abimelek</HI> perishes by those <HI>Men of Shechem.</HI></P>
<P>O WHEEL! These are some of thy <HI>Intri∣cacies</HI>; and these are indeed but <HI>Some</HI> of them: For, <HI>Many such Things are with the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>And what is now our Duty, under such <HI>Turns</HI> of <HI>Providence</HI>?</P>
<P>Christians, while our Lord Jesus Christ is Crying to the <HI>Wheels of Providence,</HI> O WHEEL; He Cryes unto <HI>Us</HI> also, to Behold the <HI>Turns of</HI> those <HI>Wheels.</HI> Behold them with. <HI>Wonder,</HI> Be∣hold them with <HI>Patience,</HI> Behold them with <HI>Profit</HI>; and Behold them with a Profound <HI>Sub∣mission</HI> of Soul. Indeed, this is One Thing of peculiar concernment for us, under all <HI>Changes</HI> whatsoever. Our Lord says unto the <HI>Wheels, O WHEEL, Move</HI>! But what says He unto Us? unto us He says, <HI>Be still</HI>; There is that <HI>Voice</HI> annex'd unto the <HI>Turning</HI> of the <HI>VVheels,</HI> in Psal. 46.10. <HI>Be still, and know, that I am God.</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="000726_0029_0FAA4534A2647180"/>
We are very prone to have our Spirits uneasy about the <HI>Changes</HI> that are before us; but as <HI>Luther</HI> sent word unto his Friend, who was too Sollicitous, how matters were like to go; <HI>Pray tell him, That I would have him give the Lord Leave to Rule the World!</HI> Even so, I say, Stand off; Don't you meddle; The <HI>VVheels</HI> of Pro∣vidence are already in a <HI>Sufficient Hand</HI>; Oh! Leave to that Hand, the <HI>Turning</HI> of them all! Instead of your going to call, O WHEEL! Say rather, O LORD! Let our continual Suppli∣cations be made unto the <HI>Lord,</HI> that every <HI>Wheel</HI> may <HI>Turn</HI> after such a Manner as is to be de∣sired. I assure you, The <HI>Prayers</HI> of the Faithful do give marvellous and powerful <HI>Jogs</HI> unto the <HI>VVheels.</HI> When we are much in Crying, <HI>Awake, O Arm of the Lord</HI>; that Omnipotent <HI>Arm</HI> which Turns all the <HI>VVheels,</HI> will <HI>Awake</HI> accordingly. And Oh! take heed of Every <HI>Sin,</HI> that may Expose you, to be <HI>broken</HI> by any <HI>VVheel</HI> of God, in the <HI>Turning</HI> of it. Mark what I say; The Business of the <HI>Wheels,</HI> is to Crush those that are in Rebellion against the Lord Jesus Christ, against His Truths, and against His Ways. When the Lord is Crying, O WHEEL! give me Leave to Cry, <HI>O SOUL, stand clear of the Sins that will make thee Obnoxious to that VVheel.</HI> If any of you are so Eager after this World, as to neglect the <HI>Great Salvation</HI> of your Souls; if any of you do not <HI>Pray</HI> constantly,
<PB N="31" REF="000726_0030_0FAA4535671497C8"/>
both with your <HI>Houses,</HI> and in your <HI>Closets</HI>; if any of you Indulge your selves in the lewd Practices of <HI>Profanity</HI>; and if any of you con∣tinue Strangers to a <HI>Closure</HI> and an <HI>Union</HI> with the Lord Jesus Christ; Sirs, I am to tell you, The <HI>VVheels</HI> of the Indignation of God, are hastening apace to overwhelm you. Oh! <HI>Consider this, ye that forget God, Lest His VVheels tear you to pieces, and there be none to deliver you.</HI></P>
<P>But, in the midst of these things, are not <HI>Men</HI> themselves to be Considered, as those <HI>VVheels,</HI> that are to <HI>Move</HI> agreeably unto the Lord, in the <HI>Changes</HI> of His Providence?</P>
<P>Truly, there is no <HI>Magistrate,</HI> but the Lord Jesus Christ crys unto him, O WHEEL, <HI>Move as well as thou canst for the Reforming of all that is amiss in thy Province, and for the Promoting of every thing that is Holy &amp; Just &amp; Good.</HI></P>
<P>There is no <HI>Minister,</HI> but the Lord Jesus Christ, crys unto him, O WHEEL, <HI>Move as well as thou canst, for the Instructing, and Convert∣ing of thy Flock, &amp; for the VVarning of every Soul, against every evil Thing.</HI></P>
<P>There is no <HI>Christian</HI> in any Capacity whatsoever, but the Lord Jesus Christ crys unto him, O WHEEL, <HI>Move in thy Capacity, as Watchfully as thou canst, as Ex∣actly as thou canst, and as Ʋsefully, as ever thou canst.</HI></P>
<P>Let us all be Attentive to the <HI>Voice</HI> of our Lord; and while His <HI>Wheels</HI> are <HI>Turning,</HI> Let us in Com∣plying with His Voice, be as Lively, as the <HI>Wheels</HI> on Chariots of <HI>Amminadib.</HI></P>

<P>So Inexpressible a <HI>Grief,</HI> as is every where produced by this vast Occasion, will Oblige us to <HI>Brief</HI> and <HI>Broken</HI> Expressions in our <HI>Observa∣tions</HI> thereupon; but as well as the Season will admit of it, Let us now <HI>Observe,</HI> in the first
<PB N="33" REF="000726_0032_0FAA453C1F0C68F8"/>
place, the Wonderful TURN of the WHEEL which brought this most Illustrious LADY, unto the Throne of <HI>Three Kingdoms!</HI></P>
<P>There were especially Two very <HI>Observable</HI> TURNS of <HI>Providence</HI> praeliminary to that <HI>Revolution.</HI></P>
<P>The First <HI>Observable</HI> was that which the Reverend Dr. <HI>Bates,</HI> has noted in his <HI>Funeral Sermon</HI> on the <HI>Queen; That she was not Early Engaged in the Belief and Practice of Popery: That her Father, being so Amorous of his Religion, did not take the Season of Instilling it into her, be∣fore she could with Understanding make a Choice. It increases the Wonder, in that the Priests were Attendents in his Court, who, being deeply Struck with Superstition, are watchful to take all Advan∣tages to Propagate it.</HI> Now, O WHEEL; how gloriously didst thou <HI>Turn</HI> the <HI>Education</HI> of this <HI>Chosen Vessel,</HI> into such a <HI>Byass</HI> as has made all the Protestants in <HI>Europe</HI> to Rejoice!</P>
<P>The Second <HI>Observable</HI> was that which all Mankind has also wondred at; namely, <HI>That notwithstanding the Popish Inclinations both in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and in the Uncle of this Incomparable Per∣son, she should yet be Disposed in Marriage, to a Prince of the Reformed Religion; and the Prince Raised by the God of Heaven, to Rescue the Nati∣ons from the Designs of those very Monarchs.</HI> Now, O WHEEL, how gloriously didst thou <HI>Turn</HI> this <HI>Match,</HI> unto the Confusion of all that <HI>Po∣pery</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="000726_0033_0FAA453E194D14D0"/>
has intended, all EUROPE over!</P>
<P>'Tis time for us now to <HI>Observe,</HI> That altho' King <HI>JAMES,</HI> had in his publick Declarati∣on, presumptuously promised himself, <HI>That no∣thing remained now to Interrupt his peaceable Go∣vernment for the future,</HI> his Mis-Government quickly brought such an Astonishing Storm upon him, that this unhappy Son of her, who says, <HI>I shall see no Sorrow,</HI> did, as it were <HI>in one Day,</HI> find all come to a <HI>Dissolution.</HI> The Parli∣ament, on, <HI>Feb.</HI> 12. 1688. (on which Day, the Princess Arrived from <HI>Holland,</HI> to <HI>Whitehal,</HI> with all the Demonstrations of Joy that could be given throughout the Nation,) made this Declaration, <HI>That</HI> James II. <HI>having Endeavour∣ed to Subvert and Extirpate the Protestant Religi∣on, Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, and Ab∣dicated the Government, the Throne was thereby become Vacant</HI>; and they thereupon made Of∣fer of the <HI>Crown</HI> unto Their Highnesses, <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> Prince and Princess <HI>Orange.</HI> Accordingly, on <HI>Feb.</HI> 13. They were Proclaim∣ed; and on <HI>April</HI> 11. 1689. Crowned, with the Acclamations of a Joyful Nation; and on <HI>May</HI> 11. Ensuing, they Received, in like manner, the Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from the Estates there∣of, by the Hands of their Commissioners. In∣deed, the <HI>First Essay</HI> of this matter, put the <HI>sole and full Exercise of the Regal Power</HI> into the Hands of the <HI>Prince</HI>; but by a following Act
<PB N="35" REF="000726_0034_0FAA453F46602420"/>
of Parliament, the <HI>Execution</HI> thereof was put in∣to the Hands of the <HI>Queen,</HI> as often as that Heroic Undertaking of Rescuing all <HI>Europe</HI> out of its Chains, required the Presence of His <HI>Britannick Majesty</HI> abroad, as <HI>Generalissimo</HI> of the Confederate Armies. Thus was this Re∣nowned Lady, with the High and Mighty WILLIAM, advanced, by wonderful <HI>Turns</HI> of <HI>Providence,</HI> into the Imperial Throne of <HI>Great Britain</HI>; but with what a Disposition towards the <HI>Abdicated Relation,</HI> she did accept the <HI>Scep∣ter,</HI> was continually manifested by the Filial <HI>Tears,</HI> wherewith She would Lament that Un∣happiness of <HI>His,</HI> which made the Deliverance of whole Nations from the Destruction of their <HI>Liberty, Property,</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> impossible to be obtained by any other mean, but <HI>Her</HI> Accepting it. It could not perhaps be more <HI>Livelily</HI> described, than in those passages of the famous Epigram upon her <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<L>Successi vivi, Solijs Invita Parentis,</L>
<L>Pulsa regnaret ne Pietate Dolus.</L>
<L>Invitam Cingi Sivi Diademate frontem,</L>
<L>Firmarem ut Leges, Flave, Britanne, Tuas.</L>
<L>Terrestrem Cepi nuper quam Invita Coronam,</L>
<L>Tam Laeta accipio nunc Diadema poli.</L>
<P>It was now a most Observable TURN up∣on the Kingdoms, to see a QUEEN upon the
<PB N="36" REF="000726_0035_0FAA4540487AE9E8"/>
Throne, professing the <HI>Holy Religion,</HI> to which the Queens of the Three Fore-going Reigns had been <HI>Aliens</HI> and <HI>Enemies.</HI> But that which made a yet more Observable TURN, was the <HI>Zeal</HI> of that Holy Religion, which rendred this Eminent Person, an <HI>Example,</HI> as one that knew it well saith, <HI>Enough to Convert a Na∣tion.</HI> The Return of such an <HI>Astrea</HI> to us, Raised our Thoughts of a <HI>Golden Age</HI> approa∣ching. The Last <HI>Lords Day</HI> that this Princess was in <HI>Holland,</HI> the Presbyterian Minister whom She then heard, in the close of his Discourse, addressed Her, with faithful Intimations of the <HI>Opportunities</HI> that She should now have to Serve the Lord Jesus Christ, and His People; at the Hearing▪ of which Address, She stood up, and Let fall a <HI>Flood of Tears.</HI> But what a <HI>Flood of Tears</HI> must now gush from us, who have in a few years Lived unto the End of those Opportunities, whereof God had made that Royal Heart so apprehensive! The won∣drous Goodness, and Sweetness, of her <HI>Temper,</HI> the Innocent <HI>Chearfulness</HI> which gave an Air to her whole Conversation, the obliging <HI>Tender∣ness</HI> wherewith She perpetually treated all that were about her, and the Charming <HI>Sincerity</HI> wherewith She Did and Spoke every Thing, while yet She Laid not aside the exactest Pru∣dence of <HI>Reservation; These</HI> were but the Les∣ser Strokes of Her Character. However <HI>These</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="000726_0036_0FAA4540E2C32B80"/>
made her so extreamly <HI>Beloved,</HI> that, <Q>Prisca parem nescit, aequalem postera nullam Exhibitura Dies;</Q></P>
<P>No Age perhaps affords a <HI>Parallel.</HI> God in this Thing, bestow'd upon Her, the Reward of Her own Averseness to <HI>Evil Speaking,</HI> or, the <HI>Censuring</HI> others: A Vice, that She not on∣ly did <HI>Avoid</HI> Her self, but also <HI>Reprove</HI> in o∣thers, on all occasions. And yet, when some Reflections on this Her Happiness were made before Her Majesty, such was Her profound Modesty, that She said, <HI>She Ascribed thus whol∣ly unto the Goodness of God; for She doubted not but that many fell under hard Characters, who deserved them as little.</HI> She said also, <HI>God knew her Weakness, that She was not able to bear some Imputations, and therefore He did not Try Her be∣yond Her Strength.</HI> She added, <HI>She hoped God would still Bless Her in her own good Name, as long as She was careful not to Hurt others.</HI> Let us pass on to take our <HI>Observation</HI> of those more Fulgent Rayes, with which this <HI>Bright Star,</HI> of the First Magnitude, Influenced more than Three Kingdoms. Yea, now, Like that of <HI>Cassiopaea,</HI> She is Retired into Heaven, yet Let us continue the <HI>Observation.</HI> This Greatest LADY that ever <HI>Europe</HI> saw, was by God▪ Raised up to preserve that Sacred <HI>Religion</HI> of
<PB N="38" REF="000726_0037_0FAA46D96EE2E630"/>
His, which was every where, as one says, in <HI>its Last Agonies</HI>; and She was Her self a <HI>Pat∣tern,</HI> as well as <HI>Patron,</HI> of that <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>O WHEEL! What hast thou brought unto our View? ROYALTY improv'd by <HI>Religion,</HI> RELIGION adorn'd with <HI>Royalty</HI>!</P>
<P>A QUEEN, Who had her Daily, Constant, Secret <HI>Retirements,</HI> for the Service of God; from which, She would permit no <HI>Business,</HI> or <HI>Journey,</HI> to divert her; and therefore would <HI>Rise Early,</HI> that She might not <HI>Forget,</HI> or <HI>Shorten</HI> those Devotions, whereon She reckoned that the Blessings of the whole Day depended: and often own'd, that in Difficulties which rendred her uneasy, She felt her Thoughts calmed, by thus carrying them to God.</P>
<P>A QUEEN, Who kept the <HI>Lords Day,</HI> most Conscientiously; and besides her Hours of Pri∣vacy, was <HI>Thrice a day</HI> in the Publick Worship of God; and for a great part of the year, Four <HI>Times a day,</HI> while She Resided in the <HI>Low-Countryes</HI>▪</P>
<P>A QUEEN, Who still once a Month, came to the Sacrament of the <HI>Lords Supper</HI>; and in order thereunto, would <HI>Prepare</HI> Her self by the Exercises of a Solemn FAST before the Lord, choosing after it but a Moderate and a Tempe∣rate Meal in the Evening.</P>
<P>A QUEEN, Who in all her Approaches un∣to God, used a most Exquisite <HI>Seriousness</HI> and
<PB N="39" REF="000726_0038_0FAA46DA41EB7098"/>
<HI>Attention</HI>; and was yet careful to conceal the more Solemn Elevations of Her mind. But hereby the like <HI>Spirit,</HI> came to be Spread among such as were about her.</P>
<P>The most Reverend A. B. of <HI>Canterbury</HI> hath given her this Testimony; <HI>It ha's at last been Understood that Her Exercises of Devotion, which were known, were not the Half of those which were then not known. If all were as diligent in Exami∣ning and noting down the Condition of their Souls, and Comparing the former, and the present Estate of them, Heaven would in some measure be upon Earth.</HI></P>
<P>A QUEEN, Who, to prevent that common, but Fatal, Mischief, <HI>The Loss of Time,</HI> did spend much <HI>Time,</HI> in the Reading of <HI>Good Books,</HI> even those Written by <HI>Dissenters,</HI> as well as by <HI>Con∣formists,</HI> for the Excitation of true <HI>Piety.</HI> Yea, She frequently Ordered <HI>Good Books</HI> to be laid in the places of Attendence, that such as waited, might, by Reading therein, save them∣selves from the Infection of <HI>Idleness.</HI> And when She was weary of Reading Her self, (generally Aloud, for the Benefit of them that Served Her) She would call upon another to <HI>Read,</HI> unto the Rest; and in the mean Time She would <HI>Work,</HI> with Her own Royal Hands, as Industriously as if She had been thereby to Earn her Bread; for She said, <HI>She Look'd on Idleness, a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Great Corrupter of Humane Nature</HI>! But hereby the
<PB N="40" REF="000726_0039_0FAA46DAE77420D0"/>
whole City soon came to write after this Copy; and it was become (as ha's been said) <HI>as much the Fashion to Work, as it had been formerly to be Idle.</HI></P>
<P>A QUEEN, Who was so Exquisitely Cau∣tious against the Enchantments of the Devil, FLATTERY, that She would Frequently Talk about the Danger of it; and Fervently Ask of those about Her, <HI>To Speak the Truth Plainly to her, and with all Freedome Tell her, if they observed any thing amiss in her, that She might mend it.</HI> Oh! the Sincere and Pious <HI>Wisdom,</HI> of such a <HI>Caution!</HI></P>
<P>A QUEEN, Who with most sensible Re∣sentments considered all the Frowns of God, in His Dispensations; but Especially in sad Ac∣cidents that came from the more <HI>Immediate Hand</HI> of Heaven. Particularly, on a great loss at Sea, She said, <HI>Though there was no Occasion for Complaint or Anger upon these, yet there was a Juster cause of Grief, since the Hand of God was to be seen so particularly in them.</HI> And She would set her self to Examine, whether some <HI>Secret Sins</HI> lying at the Root, might not blast all; but She would then say, <HI>Where so much is Visible, there is no Need of Divination concerning what may be Hidden.</HI></P>
<P>A QUEEN, Of so Diffusive and Extensive <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Charity,</HI> that all the Miserable, on all Oppor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unities had Experience of it. How many
<PB N="41" REF="000726_0040_0FAA46DBA44EC108"/>
Thousands of <HI>Refugees,</HI> found <HI>Her</HI> a Liberal <HI>Mother</HI> unto them all; and this, without any Regard unto their <HI>Different Perswasions,</HI> in the <HI>Circumstantials</HI> of Christianty! She would En∣courage all that had Access unto her, to lay before her the <HI>Necessities</HI> of all the <HI>Good Men,</HI> that they knew, Languishing in any Needy Circumstances. And yet She managed this her most Royal Bounty, with such a Regular <HI>Dis∣cretion,</HI> and a Self-denying <HI>Secrecy,</HI> as was the Admiration of all that penetrated thereinto.</P>
<P>A QUEEN, Who yet Remembred, that She was a WIFE; and by the Raptures of <HI>Affection, Obedience,</HI> and <HI>Resignation,</HI> wherewith She always treated that Great <HI>Monarch,</HI> whom She made in all things her <HI>Oracle,</HI> She practically taught the Rules of Christian <HI>Oeconomicks</HI> unto all the Families of more than Three Nations. The Sitting of Two such Persons upon the <HI>Throne</HI> together had a Tendency to recover the <HI>Married State,</HI> from all that Infamy, which the Debaucheries of the Two last Reigns, had been trying to cast upon it; But the <HI>Matchless Love</HI> which ran through the whole Behaviour of Two such Persons towards each other, did Raise the <HI>Married State</HI> unto the Just-Heighth of its Reputation. The <HI>Tears</HI> of the King since her Death, are her most glorious Elegy and Elogy. <HI>Her Husband Praises her,</HI> Declaring, <HI>That in her whole Conversation, he never discovered a
<PB N="42" REF="000726_0041_0FAA46DC60C84DB0"/>
Fault.</HI> He, whom all the Powers of the French Empire cannot Shake, faints at the Convulsions of this Divorce, and Professes, <HI>The Loss is In∣supportable</HI>! Indeed, as a French Divine in his Funeral Sermon for this Illustrious <HI>Dorcas,</HI> ha's Expressed it, <HI>The Taking of an Hundred Cities, and the gaining of an Hundred Battels, would not make up this loss unto our Sovereign.</HI> Such a QUEEN, ha's that <HI>Happy Island</HI> seen: And the most Glorious <HI>Island</HI> in the World justly counted this QUEEN, Her <HI>Glory!</HI></P>
<P>Her Exact Conduct in the Administration of Her <HI>Government,</HI> even <HI>Then</HI> when the Nati∣ons were more than once Trembling under a most formidable <HI>Crisis</HI> of their Affairs, will no more be Forgotten: than that marvellous <HI>Ae∣quality</HI> of Mind, wherewith She both Receiv∣ed and Resigned it. Her <HI>Dexterity</HI> in mana∣ging the Snarled and Arduous Affairs of the Government, &amp; preserving the Tranquillity of the Kingdoms in the most <HI>Critical Times</HI> that ever they saw, was an Evidence of an Exalted and Consummate Understanding; and Her <HI>Humility,</HI> in still Receiving Authority with <HI>Tears,</HI> but still Resigning it with <HI>Joy</HI>!</P>
<P>But let our <HI>Observations</HI> proceed unto the Royal Designs, with which the God of Hea∣ven Inspired Her Soul.</P>
<P>A Proposal, a Contrivance, <HI>How to do Good?</HI> was the most Welcome Thing in the World
<PB N="43" REF="000726_0042_0FAA46DFB1817258"/>
unto her. She would call for <HI>Suggestions</HI> of, that Importance, from those that were about her; yea, She Charged their Consciences, that they should keep nothing of that Nature from her, which they might judge it proper for Her to know: &amp; when any <HI>Good Motion</HI> was offered, She would have it <HI>Repeated,</HI> until She had fully Shaped in her own Thoughts the Notion of it. She <HI>Did Good,</HI> unto her utmost; &amp; then has been seen to <HI>Weep,</HI> that She could <HI>Do no more.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Good</HI> that She was most of all desirous to <HI>Do,</HI> was, <HI>To Reform Her People of the Evil Manners that prevailed among them.</HI> Her Heart was Extreamly▪ Distressed, from the Apprehen∣sions which the multiplied Impieties of the Nations, gave her, that the Judgments of God were Impending over them. When She was informed of the fearful Wickednesses commit∣ted all over the Land, it struck her with Hor∣ror, and Sorrow, and gave her a Melancholly prospect. She often said, especially upon the Licentious and Exorbitant Lives of many, that were the Servants of the Crown, <HI>Can a Blessing be Expected from such Hands, or on any Thing that must pass thro' them?</HI> And She Long'd for the Concerns of the Kingdom to be put into the Hands of such <HI>Vertuous</HI> and <HI>Generous</HI> men, as one might Reasonably hope for a Blessing of Heaven to accompany. The Crying Sins that
<PB N="44" REF="000726_0043_0FAA46E0B9326138"/>
abounded in the <HI>Armies</HI> and <HI>Navies,</HI> caused her to Mourn in the presence of God; and She gave persons in Eminent Stations, to under∣stand, <HI>That it was impossible for them to oblige her more, than by a care to stop those Disorders, and Reduce Matters to the Gravity and Sobriety of the former Times.</HI></P>
<P>When She heard, that <HI>Ireland</HI> before it was well got out of its late <HI>Confusions,</HI> was return∣ing unto its <HI>Old Iniquities,</HI> She would speak of it, as one through Trouble, almost <HI>Unable to Speak.</HI></P>
<P>The Lamentable <HI>Formality</HI> and <HI>Contention</HI> which overspread the Protestant Churches a∣broad, most sensibly Afflicted her; She would, with a certain Anguish of Heart, say upon it, <HI>Can such Dry Bones Live?</HI></P>
<P>She Passionately Wished that the Church of <HI>England</HI> might be Reformed, of many things that She saw Amiss in it; And being One that Loved the <HI>Image of the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> in whomsoever She saw it, without any Little Respects to Differing parties, there was nothing more in her Wishes, than a better <HI>Union</HI> among those that had that <HI>Image</HI> on them It was unto an Honoured Rela<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of my own, that She uttered those words, <HI>Inasmuch as a Man cannot make himself Believe what he will, why should we persecute one another? I wish, I could see all Good Men of one Mind; but in the mean
<PB N="45" REF="000726_0044_0FAA46E26AC5C888"/>
Time, I Pray, Let them however Love one another.</HI> Words, worthy to be witten in Letters of <HI>Gold</HI> She was particularly Resolved upon throwing Disgrace upon all <HI>Ministers,</HI> that should not Painfully and Faithfully, Watch over the Souls under their Charge. But the Day before her last Sickness arrested her, She said, <HI>She had no great Hope of Mending matters, yet She was Re∣solved to go on, and never Suffer her self to be discouraged, or loose Heart: She would still Try what could be done, and pursue her Design, how slow or insensible soever, the Progress might be.</HI></P>
<P>She would therefore Listen most Attentive∣ly, to every thing, that gave any Hope of Things being better in the <HI>Next Generation.</HI> And when She was informed of a Religious Disposition, beginning to spread it self among the <HI>Young People,</HI> in the great City of <HI>London,</HI> She was mightily pleased with it, and would much and oft Enquire after it.—</P>
<P>But that at last, I may say something, which may more nearly Touch my Friends in the <HI>Plantations,</HI> I will Recite, and but Recite, the Words of the most Learned Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> who ha's been my Author, for some things al∣ready spoken, in his <HI>Essay</HI> upon her Memory; <Q>She took particular Methods, to be well in∣formed of the State of our Plantations, and of those Colonies that we have among the Infidels. But it was no small Grief to Her,
<PB N="46" REF="000726_0045_0FAA46E33B7227A8"/>
to Her, to hear that they were but too gene∣rally a Reproach to the Religion, by which they were <HI>Named,</HI> (I do not say, which they <HI>professed,</HI> for many of them seem scarce to <HI>profess</HI> it.)</Q></P>
<P>But as none of all the <HI>Plantations</HI> have signa∣lized their Loyalty to Her, more than the Countrey of NEW-ENGLAND, so, She ever Expressed a special Regard for that Countrey.</P>
<P>For <HI>New England</HI> She most readily <HI>Spoke</HI> un∣to the King at Home, and <HI>Wrote</HI> unto Him abroad, That He would be favourable unto His Good Subjects there.</P>
<P>And when One of the Agents for that Coun∣try, being Introduced unto the QUEEN, and having the Honour to Represent at large, the State of that People before Her Majesty; said, <HI>I most Humbly pray Tour Majesties Favour to Your Majesties Subjects in</HI> New-England; <HI>than whom, none are more in Your Interests, nor are there any who do with greater Devotion pray for Your Long and Happy Reign. They only Peti∣tion, that they may be Resettled in the Enjoyment of those Priviledges, whereof they were possessed, until the Last Year of K.</HI> Charles <HI>II.</HI> The QUEEN most graciously Replyed; <HI>I would not only have</HI> Justice <HI>done to that People, but</HI> Fa∣vour shown <HI>to them.</HI> And if any thing be yet wanting to that Province, it was not on <HI>Her</HI> part; who show'd her particular Tenderness
<PB N="47" REF="000726_0046_0FAA46E3EABDE500"/>
for their Welfare, in sending them, by that Hand, a kind supply for their Defence against the Common Enemy.</P>
<P>And now, O WHEEL! what a doleful <HI>Turn</HI> hast thou given, in the Removal of so Excellent a <HI>Princess?</HI></P>
<P>When She fell Sick, She set her self to take a View of DEATH; and She found the Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, Enabling Her to En∣counter it, with such a Miraculous Calm of Soul, that She said, <HI>Though She did not Pray for Death, yet She could neither wish nor Pray against it; She left that before God, and referr'd her self Entirely to the Disposal of His Providence.</HI> Unpa∣rallel'd Words, for a Lady in the Flower of <HI>Youth,</HI> Surrounded with all the Temptations and Enjoyments of this Life!</P>
<P>The Tidings of Her Indisposition, cast the whole English Nation, into such an Astonish∣ing Terrour, as no Colours, are black Enough to describe: a certain Trembling Siezed the Nation, and all things were in an Universal <HI>Agony.</HI></P>
<P>She only Her self was easy, and Reaping the <HI>Fruits,</HI> the <HI>Joyes,</HI> of her past <HI>Godly Life,</HI> She found the Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ Enabling Her to Triumph over the <HI>Last-Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>Among the most Satisfying and Seraphical Things then uttered by this Dying Lady,</P>
<P>One was,</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="000726_0047_0FAA46E4A12DDDB0"/><HI>I know what Loose People think, of those who pretend to Religion; they think, it is all</HI> Hypo∣crisy. <HI>Let them think what they Will, I may now say, and I thank God, I can say it; I have not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffected to appear what I was not.</HI></P>
<P>Another was,</P>
<P><HI>I believe, I shall now soon Dy; and I thank God, I have from my Youth Learned a true Doctrine, That Repentance is not to be put off unto a Death-bed</HI></P>
<P>Her Distemper proved the <HI>Small Pox</HI>: and of That, amidst the Sighs of an amazed Na∣tion, this Glorious QUEEN, fill'd with <HI>Inter∣nal Peace,</HI> Expired and Retired unto <HI>Eternal</HI>; On <HI>December</HI> 28. 1694 a Quarter of an Hour before One, on <HI>Fryday</HI> morning; in the Thir∣ty Third Year of her Age. [She was Born, <HI>April</HI> 30. 1662.]</P>
<P>A TURN of the WHEEL, whereon all considerate persons have made that Reflection, which Dr. <HI>Burnet</HI> has in those Terms on this Occasion given unto us, <HI>God seems to be making a way for His Anger, and to be Removing that Interposition, which we have reason to believe did effectually stop the Miseries, for which we may well fear, that we are more than Ripe.</HI></P>
<P>A TURN whereof our Brethren in <HI>Scotland</HI> also have been so sensible, as to Indict a <HI>Nati∣nal FAST,</HI> for the <HI>Calamity befallen the Nations</HI> in so Ominous a <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="000726_0048_0FAA46E58247FC00"/>A TURN, which has put Three Puissant Kingdoms, and all the Navies and Armies, &amp; all the Plantations of both the <HI>India's</HI> thereto pertaining, into <HI>Mourning</HI>; yea, and all the Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> except that <HI>One,</HI> wherein, as a <HI>French</HI> Divine on this Occasion says, <HI>It is a crime to deplore Vertue, as much as to profess the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>She was Interred on the Fifth of <HI>March</HI> fol∣lowing, with Solemnities transcending what had ever been paid unto any of Her Predecessors.</P>
<P>The KING being, thro' the singular Mercy of God, at <HI>Whitehal,</HI> in the Time of this Terri∣ble Disaster, the Parliament immediately Ex∣pressed their Concern for the Safety of His Royal Person, by Addressing Him with Hum∣ble Declarations of their Fixed Resolutions to Stand by Him, and His Government.</P>
<P>Those Declarations were immediately fol∣lowed with ADDRESSES OF CONDO∣LENCE, from all parts of the Nation; among which there was <HI>One</HI> from the <HI>Non Conformist Ministers,</HI> which, because I know it expresses but vvhat the <HI>Ministers of New England,</HI> (a Province to which this Relation is especially directed) would most heartily have concurr'd unto, if the Extremity of their Distance in those Remote parts of <HI>America,</HI> had not rendred them uncapable of any seasonable Consultati∣on for it, I shall conclude this Discourse, vvith the Recital thereof.</P>

<P>THO we come in the Rear of the Train of Mourners, to pay our Tributary Tears for the Unvaluable Loss in the Death of Your Royal Consort, and our most Gracious Queen, yet our Resentments of it are with as tender a Sympathy as are in the Breasts of any of Your Subjects. This gives the sharpest Accent to our Passions, that the Considerations which are most proper and powerful to allay our Sorrows, exasperate them: for while we remember what She was, how general and diffusive a Bles∣sing

to three Kingdoms, the severe Stroke of Pro∣vidence in taking Her from us, is most afflicting. Such a Concurrence of high Perfection shin'd in Her Person and Actions, that would have made Her Illustrious in a low Condition; and in Her exalted Station they were attractive of the Eyes and Admiration of all. Her Mind was above the Temptations that attend the Throne. Majesty was mix'd with that condescending Humility, that tender and beneficent Goodness, that She was easily accessable to all for their Relief and Support. Her Piety and Purity were so conspicu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us, Her Affections were so comp<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed and temperate, that the Court, that is usually the Centre of Vanity and Voluptuous∣ness, became Vertuous by the Impression of Her Ex∣ample. Her Conversation was so regular, that Her Enemies (if Goodness in such a bright Emi∣nency had any) could not fasten a Taint upon Her. Her Royal Endowments for Government, Wisdom, Magnanimity, Vigilance and Care in managing Affairs of State (without which the highest Princes are but civil Idols, useless and unprofitable to the World) these were in s<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch a degree of Ex∣cellency, that in▪ Your Majesty's constrained Ab∣sence, while You were defending the Interest of <HI>Christendom,</HI> against a potent Enemy Abroad, with the Sword of War, She sweetly ordered all things at Home with the Scepter of Peace. She is gone, and must return no more: O astonishing Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ef! But it becomes us with humble Submission to acqui∣esce

in the Divine Disposal. The Will of God is always directed by infinite Wisdom, and is the Rule of Goodness. We must refresh our Sorrows with the hope that She is entered <HI>into her Savi∣our's Joy,</HI> whom She imitated and honoured, and that She is made happy in the Love of God and the Light of His Countenance for ever.</P>
<P>We humbly beseech Your Majesty to accept the renewed Assurances of our inviolable and constant Fidelity to your Person and Government; and that we shall influence all that are within our Compass to persevere in their Duty; We shall earnestly pray to the blessed God to keep you in the best Protection, his encompassing Favour, to support your Spirit with Divine Comforts, and to continue long your precious Life, so necessary for preserving the pure Religion, and the Civil Rights of this Kingdom.</P>
