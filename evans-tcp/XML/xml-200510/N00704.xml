<P>IT is recorded in the Holy Scriptures, that the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, though it was of great importance and concernment to all People; yet it pleased God that it should by one of the
<PB REF="000850_0004_0FABA15FE34812F0"/>
Evangelists be directed in a special manner to a single Person, called the most Excellent <HI>Theophilus,</HI> as in <HI>Luke</HI> 1.6. <HI>I write unto thee most excellent</HI> The∣ophilus, <HI>that thou mayest know the certainty of those things wherein thou hast been instructed. Theophilus</HI> signifies, <HI>A lover of God.</HI> It is conceived by learned and pious Interpreters to be the proper Name of an Eminent Person, who had been Converted to the Christian Faith at <HI>Antioch,</HI> where the followers of Christ were first called Christians; and the title [<HI>Most Excellent</HI>] given to him renders it very probable, that he was in a chief place of Magistra∣cy in that eminent City, if not Governour of the whole Province; for we read not of that style [<HI>Most Excellent</HI>] given to any but such as were Governours of Provinces, such as <HI>Faelix</HI> &amp; <HI>Festus,</HI> who were successively Governours of <HI>Judea,</HI> as in <HI>Act.</HI> 23.25. <HI>Claudius Lysias, to the most Excellent Governour Faelix</HI> &amp;c. So, why might not this <HI>Theo∣philus</HI> be Governour of <HI>Syria?</HI> by the special Pro∣vidence of God raised up to such a Dignity, that by the influence of his Example and Authority he might be a means under God for the Propagation and Progression of Christianity unto many others.</P>
<P>In like manner this Ensuing Sermon containing one great end of the Gospel of Christ, <HI>viz.</HI> That all Christians should <HI>Serve the Lord in Holiness and Righteousness before Him all the dayes of our lives,

<Q>Per varios Casus, Per tot discrimina rerum.</Q></P>
<P>Now as God hath been with those Worthy men, whom He hath graciously vouchsafed to bestow on this People, to bear Rule over them; particularly, the Honorable <HI>William Stoughton <HI>Esq</HI></HI> Lieu∣tenant Governour, and our Worthy Patriots assisting in Council; whose Integrity we can't but remem∣ber at all times with Gratitude: So we pray for Gods gracious Presence with Your Excellency, and His more abundant Blessing upon Your Person &amp; Government, that the end thereof may be attained; that this People <HI>may live a quiet and peaceable life in all Godliness &amp; Honesty.</HI> The good report of Your Personal qualifications, Your Publick appear∣ing for Securing of the Liberties of our dear <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and Your good beginnings of Reformation at <HI>New York</HI> (where You first landed) have filled our hopes and raised our Expectations, that You are sent from God, and are coming amongst us in the Spirit and Power of that Excellent Governour <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> of whom it was said, <HI>He was a man that came to seek the Welfare of the Children of Israel,</HI> Neh.

2.10. Which was a grief to their Enemies, but matter of great rejoycing to that good People in their afflicted and low condition.</P>
<P>This People of <HI>New England</HI> are a People whom God hath Signally owned &amp; blessed in our first &amp; former times; our Fathers coming into these ends of the Earth not upon any Worldly design, but meerly on the account of Religion; they had much of the gracious Presence of God with them in their Planting and Building Work, and in lay∣ing the Foundations in Church &amp; Common wealth, and in the additional blessings of Heaven &amp; Earth, and Sea &amp; Land; So that from a day of small things, <HI>New England</HI> in a few years was grown up to be a thriving and flourishing Plantation: But alas, we their Successors have not answered the Lords Expectation, or our own Profession, but as we have been multiplyed &amp; encreased, so we have Sin∣ned, and provoked the Lord to anger against us, so that of late years He hath Severely witnessed against us by the variety of His Judgments in a Successive way, and for a long time; So that we are at present an Afflicted &amp; poor People, greatly diminished, impoverished and brought very low, <HI>through Oppression, Affliction and Sorrow</HI>: as it is in <HI>Psal.</HI> 107. from <HI>v.</HI> 33 to 42. And as yet it was said of the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> when they were in a distres∣sed condition, <HI>that the Lord gave them Saviours</HI> Neh. 9.27. And with respect unto the latter dayes it is
<PB REF="000850_0007_0FABA16226D698B0" MS="y"/>
foretold, <HI>That Saviours shall come up on Mount Sion, and the Kingdom shall be the Lords,</HI> Obad. the last <HI>v.</HI> This hath been frequently done in these latter times in some degree as might be shewed in many instances; it may Suffice to mention Your Grand∣father of blessed Memory, who was raised up under God with an Heroick Spirit to be the Saviour of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the day of their distress in 1641. and we hope in God that He hath sent Your Self amongst us as a Saviour to <HI>New-England,</HI> bringing with You an <HI>Olive Branch</HI> of PEACE, as a good Omen, that the deluge of our Calamities is abated, and our hopes encreased, that yet <HI>New England</HI> may live in the sight of God; and that under the Sha∣dow of Your Government we may yet be revived, and the work of God amongst us be renewed by degrees unto a more flourishing Condition than hitherto; that it may be said, <HI>the Lord bless thee O Habitation of Justice and Mountain of Holiness</HI>; which is the Subject matter of the following Sermon.</P>
<P>This Elaborate and Pious Discourse of my Re∣verend Brother &amp; Colleague in the Work of the Ministry here at <HI>Salem,</HI> was Preached at <HI>Boston</HI> on the Anniversary day of Election, according to our Custom from the beginning: He was called to this Service by the Honorable the Lieutenant Go∣vernour and Council; and the Publishing of it was Desired &amp; Ordered by the General Court. There is something in the Text Prophetical &amp; something
<PB REF="000850_0008_0FABA2B284C60BC0" MS="y"/>
Didactical. It is agreed upon by all Sober Divines and Christians, that we are not to expect a full un∣derstanding of the Prophecies until they be fulfilled, and that there may be a gradual and partial fulfill∣ing of sundry Prophecies at several times; and yet some special Time be intended for the eminent &amp; full accomplishment of them: Also, that not the Prophecies but the Precepts of Scripture are to be the Rule of our Actions. It belongs to God to fulfill with His Hand what He hath spoken with His Mouth, and that in the times and by the ways &amp; means which are known unto Him, but unknown to us; it belongs to us to observe His Commandments concerning our present duties, whatever the case be, leaving all future Events to God. <HI>Deut.</HI> 29 29 Yet are Prophesies a ground of our Faith, Hope and Prayer, relating to their Ac∣complishment: and so far Prophesies are doctrinal, <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.2, 3. And it is the doctrinal part of the Scriptures that mainly concerns us to direct us in all cases in the way of our duty to God &amp; men, as the Reverend Author according to the Wisdom and Grace given unto him, hath declared unto us with much Evidence from Scripture light. Hence it is without question the duty of the Church and People of God <HI>to be an Habitation of Justice and Mountain of Holiness,</HI> at all times &amp; in all places of the World: and because God hath foretold and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omised that it shall be Eminently &amp; Conspicu∣ously so at some times and in some places in these
<PB REF="000850_0009_0FABA2B2E2A18A20" MS="y"/>
last dayes that are come and coming upon the World, therefore we are to aime at it and endea∣vour after it, in all the wayes of our duty, that it may be so with us in that measure as the Lord shall please to grant the same unto us; for it is certain, so far as we attain thereunto we shall be a People blessed of the Lord: For these two, <HI>Holiness towards God, and Righteousness towards men,</HI> are like unto the two Pillars in the Temple of God <HI>Jachin</HI> and <HI>Boaz,</HI> which did signify the Strength and E∣stablishment of the welfare of the Church &amp; Peo∣ple of God, while they continue in the Righteous and Holy wayes of the blessed God.</P>
<P>This duty of endeavouring that <HI>New-England</HI> may be <HI>an Habitation of Justice and Mountain of Ho∣liness,</HI> though it is incumbent upon all, yet it is in a special manner committed to and betrusted with Your EXCELLENCY according to that High Station which GOD and the KING have set You in: and then it is required of all orders and ranks of men; both Magistrates, Ministers and People (every one in their own place) that they move regularly in concurrence with Your Lord∣ship in all things that may conduce unto that end: Though it may be SIR, You may sometimes meet with difficulties in Your way, and find things amiss that cannot presently be amended. So did <HI>Solomon,</HI> who though he was the wisest of Kings with a most prudent Council, and a morigerous
<PB REF="000850_0010_0FABA2B4CB3DBB38" MS="y"/>
People; yet out of his Experience he informs us, <HI>that which was wanting could not be numbred, or that which was crooked could not be made streight</HI>: and therefore he gives this advice to others, <HI>Consider the work of God, for who can make that streight which He hath made crooked.</HI> Eccl. 7.13. And therefore it will be no wonder if You should find it so. Yet let me tell You from the Word of the Lord, that the same Encouragement which the Lord gave unto <HI>Joshua,</HI> for the Substance and Scope of it, be∣longs unto any of His Servants whom He sets in the place of Government over His People, <HI>viz Be thou Strong and of good Courage in observing all the Commandments of God so shalt thou make thy way pros∣perous and thou shalt have good Success, for I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee, saith the Lord.</HI> Josh. 1. from <HI>v</HI> 5. to <HI>v.</HI> 10. compared with <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.5. And when it may be said in any difficult case wherein there is duty to be done, <HI>Arise for this matter belongeth unto thee</HI> (as it was said unto <HI>Ezra,</HI> Chap. 10.4.) I hope in God it will also be said by all this Peo∣ple (as it was then expressed by some in the Name of the rest) <HI>We also will be with thee, viz.</HI> That You will have the Hearts and Prayers and endea∣vours, of all the good People of the Land with You in whatsoever may have a tendency to the making of this our <HI>New-England, to be an Habitation of Justice and Mountain of Holiness</HI>; the Lord grant that it may be so.</P>
<P><PB REF="000850_0011_0FABA2B8042B1F98" MS="y"/>Finally, being Old and full of dayes, having seen all that the Lord hath done for <HI>New-England,</HI> &amp; all the Changes of Times that have passed over it from the beginning unto this day: and now waiting daily for my own great Change, I cannot but express my hearts desire and prayer to God for <HI>New-England, Return O Lord, graciously Return to the many thousands of</HI> NEW-ENGLAND, <HI>and cause thy Face to Shine upon it, and give unto this thy People a Heart to be continually returning to thee, and keeping thy Commandments, that thou mayest make them and keep them to be for ever, an Habitation of Righteousness and Mountain of Holiness, blessed of the Lord:</HI> And for Your Person, <HI>That the God and Father of our LORD JESUS CHRIST would Bless You with all Spiritual, Temporal and Eternal Blessings in Christ Jesus,</HI> and in relation to Your Government, that He would pour down His Spirit upon You, and make You a Minister of God for good unto this Peo∣ple, and give You to be like unto <HI>David, who led and fed the People in the integrity of his heart, and by the skilfullness of his hands</HI>; and like unto <HI>Solomon,</HI> of whom it is said, in <HI>Psal.</HI> 72. <HI>In his dayes the Righteous did flourish, the Moun∣tains did bring Peace to the People, and the little hills by Righteousness, and there was abundance of Peace.</HI> That in after times it may be said, Be∣cause the Lord loved this People therefore He
<PB REF="000850_0012_0FABA2B950BFE338" MS="y"/>
set Your Lord-ship over them; and that You left <HI>New-England</HI> better than You found it▪ <HI>And so the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with Your Spirit for ever,</HI> AMEN.</P>

<P>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of <HI>Israel,</HI> as yet they shall use this Speech in the Land of <HI>Judah,</HI> and in the Cities thereof, when I shall bring again their Captivity, The Lord bless thee▪ O Habitation of Justice, and Mountain of Holiness.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE are here presented with a comfortable Vision in the Prophesies of <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> the man who for the most part was filled wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h bitterness, and had his Pen dipped in waters of Gall, that like a <HI>Comet</HI> foretold the fates of Kings and Kingdoms,
<PB N="2" REF="000850_0014_0FABA2BA783F1BE0"/>
that denounced Sword, Famine, Pestilence, Cap∣tivity, and such like Judgments against <HI>Judah,</HI> for their Apostacy, Impiety, Iniquity, Impenitency, and Incorrigibleness, and made the Cup of Di∣vine Fury to go round among the Nations, he hath now and then a little sweetning put into his mouth, for his own and the Churches Consolati∣on: accordingly in this, and the foregoing Chap∣ter he cometh with milk and honey in his mouth, and tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s Prophetically of the Restauration of the Jews, the Coming and Kingdom of the Mes∣siah, the manifestation of the New Covenant, the Gar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng &amp; Enlarging of the Catholick Church, consisting of Jews and Gentiles, with all the hap∣py turns, and returns of the Church of God in general, and of the Jews in particular, till the time come, that they shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever. But I confine my self to my Text▪ The words read contain a Prophesie, with its Preface: the Prophesie is in these words, <HI>as yet they shall use this Speech in the Land of</HI> Judah, <HI>and in the Cities thereof, when I shall bring again their Captivity, The Lord bless thee O Habitation of Justice, and Mountain of Holiness.</HI> I call this a Prophesie because the matter and scope are especially Prophetical, yet are there Doctri∣nal and Historical Hints evident enough in them, if we consider what is implied, as well as what is expressed; and it serves our occasion to improve what is Doctrinal, and Historical in them, as well
<PB N="3" REF="000850_0015_0FABA2BB2A2D0AF8"/>
as what is Prophetical. Let us therefore look over the words again, and search out the Con∣tents more diligently and distinctly.</P>
<P N="1">1. And then we shall find that these words shew forth historically what the Land of <HI>Judea,</HI> and more especially <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> formerly had been, <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI>Habitation of Justice, and Mountain of Ho∣liness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That then they were saluted by men, and blessed of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. That at the time when this Prophesie wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> written, they were far from being a Habitation of Justice, on Mountain of Holiness.</P>
<P N="4">4. And that they were as far from being bles∣sed of God and man, as they were from being a Habitation of Justice, and Mountain of Holiness. These four particulars result from the word (<HI>as yet</HI>) or <HI>yet again,</HI> as some read it, for the particle <HI>yet</HI> notes not a continuation of something in be∣ing, but a restauration of something that former∣ly had been in being, but now for some time had been intermitted.</P>
<P N="2">2. These words shew forth doctrinally, what <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem</HI> always should have been, <HI>viz.</HI> a Habitation of Justice, and Mountain of Holi∣ness. For if while they were holy and righte∣ous, they were happy and prosperous; and upon their Degeneration their felicity departed, and woful miseries ensued; and were like to continue till their reformation, no doubt in point of duty,
<PB N="4" REF="000850_0016_0FABA2BBE82F6638"/>
they ought always to have been a Habitation of Justice, and Mountain of Holiness.</P>
<P N="3">3. These words as they are <HI>Prophetical,</HI> are also <HI>Promissory,</HI> they contain a threefold promise.</P>
<P N="1">1. The promise of a <HI>Happy Restauration</HI> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om their Captivity, in these words, <HI>When I shall bring again their Captivity,</HI> that is, their Captives; the <HI>Abstract</HI> being put for the <HI>Concrete,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Translation hath it, when I shall turn away their Captivity, the sence is the same with that <HI>v.</HI> 16. <HI>they shall come again from the Land of the Enemy.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The promise of a <HI>Holy Reformation</HI> of the Jews from their present Impiety and Iniquity. For when it is said, <HI>they shall use this Speech, O Ha∣bitation of Justice, and Mountain of Holiness</HI>; it means this Speech shall be duly and truly used. <HI>Jerusalem</HI> should not only <HI>be called,</HI> but <HI>really</HI> and <HI>truly be,</HI> what men shall call her; the phrase is of like import with that, Isa. 48.8. <HI>wast called a transgressor from the womb,</HI> that is truly so called, for thou wast a Transgressor from the womb; so for Peace-makers to be <HI>Called the Children of God,</HI> means they shall be so, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.9. From the Speech then we may infer, God promised that Religion and Righteousness should flourish again in the Land of <HI>Judah,</HI> and in the Cities thereof.</P>
<P N="3">3. The promise of a <HI>Divine Benediction</HI>; men should <HI>wish</HI> it them, and God would <HI>give it them, they shall yet again use this Speech, the Lord bless thee,</HI> which is the instituted form of Blessing contract∣ed;
<PB N="5" REF="000850_0017_0FABA2BCB41D7DE0"/>
and it intends, that as for their Sins God had made them a Curse, even to a proverb of re∣proach and derision, according as God had threat∣ned them. <HI>Deut.</HI> 28.37. so now on the contrary, it should be observed, that they were again in favour with God, and that he had blessed them, and did and would bless them; and thence men would be encouraged to bless them in the name of the Lord, or pray to God to bless them; and that more than mans blessing of them is here in∣tended, is evident by what follows; for in the sequel, God plainly promised Temporal and Spi∣ritual Blessings to them, so <HI>v.</HI> 24. <HI>there shall dwell in Judah, and all the Cities thereof, Husband men and they that go forth with flocks</HI>: that is, they shall have peace and plenty. <HI>v.</HI> 25. <HI>I have satiated the weary Soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful Soul</HI>; that is, I will as surely do it as if it were done already. <HI>v.</HI> 28. <HI>I will watch over them to build and to plant.</HI> v. 33. <HI>I will put my Law in their inward parts, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</HI> v. 34. <HI>I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their Sin no more.</HI> It is manifest by the premises, that the Prophesie and threefold Pro∣mise is not intended so much of what men should <HI>say,</HI> but of what God would <HI>DO</HI> for his people, <HI>viz.</HI> Restore, Reform, and Bless them. So much may serve to explain the Prophesy, and what is con∣tained in it. The preface renders the whole cre∣dible, the Doctrine must needs be good, and the
<PB N="6" REF="000850_0018_0FABA2BD6C301E58"/>
History certain; and the promise and prophesy past all peradventure. <HI>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel</HI>: The Divine Veracity, Omnipo¦tency and Covenant benignity of God engageth, and stands engaged for the performance of what is promised, and it is flat Infidelity, not to believe it; for God wants neither power nor good will to effect what he hath promised. So you have the Text explained as it primarily and nextly stood related to the Jews, before the Coming of Christ; but <HI>the Jews</HI> may moreover be consider∣ed as a <HI>Prophetical Type</HI> of the Christian Church in the times of the <HI>Messias,</HI> which times are re∣lated to in the very foregoing verse, <HI>A Woman shall compass a man</HI>; and this is prefaced with, <HI>The Lord hath created a new thing in the earth,</HI> a new thing indeed; for a Woman to be both a <HI>Mother</HI> and a <HI>Virgin</HI> at the same time; a new thing in deed, for a Woman to be the Mother <HI>of him that was God,</HI> though <HI>not of the God Head,</HI> yet of the Humane Nature received into P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsonal Union with the Son of God. A woman shall compass a man, <HI>viz. the man of Gods Right hand,</HI> for whose sake Redemption should come, and with it Re∣stauration, Reformation, and Divine Benediction, not only to the Jews, but also to the Gentiles; for <HI>God was in Christ reconciling the World unto himself, not imputing to them their trespasses</HI>; and some of the Blessings promised, were the mani∣festation of the New-Covenant, the Gathering and
<PB N="7" REF="000850_0019_0FABA2BE221F65B8"/>
Enlarging the Catholick Church, writing the Law in the heart <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which the Apostle to the Hebrews refers to Gospel times. <HI>Heb.</HI> 8.10, 11.12. And the whole by way of <HI>Analogy</HI> and just accommodotion may be referred to Kingdoms, Countries &amp; Places, Nations professing the Christian Religion; thus the New Testament teacheth us to interpret, accom∣modate and apply to our selves, Texts of the Old Testament. See Rom. 15.4. <HI>For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our Learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</HI> So 1 Co. 10.11. <HI>Now all these things hapned unto them for ensamples, and are written for our instruction on whom the ends of the world are come.</HI> So also 2 Tim. 3.16. <HI>All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in righteousness.</HI> Thus having shewed how this text that nextly con∣cerned the Jews comes to affect us, and concern these last ages of the professing world: I shall only for further Explication of the Text, shew what in∣tended by Justice, what by a Habitation of Justice, and then what by Holiness, and what by a Moun∣tain of Holiness; and then proceed to give you the Doctrines.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> What intended by Justice?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Sometimes it is more strictly taken for that political virtue whereby such as are in Authority punish evil doers, and praise and justify them that do well, and that this sence is herein comprehended
<PB N="8" REF="000850_0020_0FABA2BF34897680"/>
is without doubt: but yet it is intended in a more large sence in this text, for here it is joyned with holiness, and yet distinguisht from it; and when it is so, it is taken for conformity to the second Table of the Decalogue, or six last Commandments: the word rendred Justice, might as well be rendred Righteousness, they are Synonimous: and so the same word in the text rendred Justice, is in many other texts, rendred Righteousness. See <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.26 <HI>Afterward thou shalt be called the City of Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What intended by Habitation of Justice, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Righteousness?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By Habitation of Righteousness is intended a City or place that abounds in Righteousness and excelleth in it, or that is full of righteous persons the <HI>Abstract</HI> being put for <HI>the Concrete</HI>: Compar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it with Isa. 1.21. <HI>It was full of Judgment, Righte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ousness lodged in it</HI>; that is, Equity, Honesty, Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rity, Chastity, Truth &amp; Justice were not as Stranger in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> but Inhabitants; they dwelt in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Temple, in the Courts, in the Gates, in the Streets in their Houses, in their Shops, and in all thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> converse &amp; commerce. And of the <HI>New Heav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> and the <HI>New Earth,</HI> it is said, <HI>Righteousness shall dwe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> therein;</HI> that is, be not only resident, but eminent prevalent, permanent and abundant.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What intended by Holiness?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Some times it is taken in so large a sence a to comprehend in it conformity to the whole <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>calogue,</HI> but when it is joyned with and yet distin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>guished
<PB N="9" REF="000850_0021_0FABA2C0F36712A8"/>
from righteousness, it intends conformity to the first Table of the Law, or four first Com∣mandments: and with respect to the Holiness and Righteousness mentioned in the text; once for all for preventing mistake, I declare I intend not only that which is commonly called <HI>Morality,</HI> but con∣formity to the whole <HI>Doctrine which is according to Godliness,</HI> &amp; that Obedience to which men are <HI>Created in Christ Jesus,</HI> &amp; that Grace which men derive from him through the holy Spirit in Regeneration and Sanctification, whereby they are enabled to live to God and serve him in Holiness and Righteousness.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What intended by a Mountain of Holiness?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> As it respects <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> it meaneth that it should regain its ancient purity, and be as renown∣ed for <HI>Holiness</HI> as ever it was; that had not only been beautiful for its <HI>Situation,</HI> but for its <HI>Sancti∣fication</HI> wherein not only <HI>Holy men</HI> had dwelt, but the <HI>Holy God</HI>; there was the holy Temple, the holy Oracle, the holy Ordinances and holy Assem∣blies, the beauty of holiness, the habitation of Gods holiness, the Throne of his holiness, the Courts of his holiness, and where his anointed ones mini∣stred unto him, something like as the Angels do in Heaven; it was a <HI>Comparative Heaven</HI> for holi∣ness, and a <HI>Type of the real Heaven</HI>; it had been <HI>so,</HI> and should be <HI>so</HI> again. When it is applyed to Christian Countries, it means that they should a∣bound in holiness, and excel other places therein, as much as <HI>Judea</HI> did other lands, and <HI>Jerusalem</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="000850_0022_0FABA2C12BB23FB0"/>
did other Cities in the day that they were <HI>Holiness to the Lord</HI> So you have the meaning of the Text, &amp; its words &amp; phrases, both in the literal sence as it nextly concern'd the Jews, and also in its <HI>Analo∣gical sence,</HI> as it concerns Christians of all King∣doms and Plantations to the end of the world We come now to the Doctrines that result from the Text thus explained, which are three. The first from the doctrinal hints in the Text: the second from the historical hints: the third from the Text as it is a Prophesy.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> I. That it is the duty of all People or Place<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> professing the Christian Religion, to ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>und and exce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Holiness and Righteousness: or to be an Habita∣tion of Righteousness, and Mountain of Holiness.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> II. That such People and Places as profes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Christian Religion, may expect to be Happy o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Miserable, according as it goeth with them, as t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Holiness and Righteousness.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> III. That although Places that have been Habitations of Righteousness and Mountains of Holi∣ness, should become very degenerate, and for their Sin be made very desolate; yet there is ground <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hope that God will again Restore, Reform and Bless them.</P>
<P>The first DOCTRINE Confirm'd by Reasons.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="000850_0023_0FABA2C1E05728D8"/><HI>Reason.</HI> 1. Because the Moral Law obligeth all mankind to holiness and righteousness, from the beginning of the world to the end of it: for it was no ways suitable to the Wisdom and Holiness of God to make man a rational Creature, which is a cause by counsel of his own actions, and so capable of honouring or dishonouring, of obeying or disobeying him that made him, and then leave it to his liberty, whether he would own and ho∣nour his maker, yea or no, whether he would worship God according to his Institution, or his own, or anothers invention. Can it be imagined, that the most wise and holy God would leave it <HI>Arbitrary</HI> to men, whether they would sanctify the <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Dreadful</HI> Name of God, or prophane it by Blasphemy, Perjury or Irreverence in his Wor∣ship? Could special worship be due from man to God, and yet no set Time be appointed by God for it, and seperated and so sanctified for that holy end and use? and when God had by his own Example and Revelation of his will notifyed what proportion of time for his peculiar Service, was best pleasing to him and most proper for us: could it be any wayes suitable to the Wisdom, Holiness and Majesty of God to Submit to the pleasure and humor of man, whether he would religiously observe it, yea or no? Thus it is and could be no otherwise with man, relating to the <HI>first and great Commandment,</HI> and <HI>there is a second like to it, thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self:</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="000850_0024_0FABA2C2F01D5260"/>
Man must of necessity be obliged by this also, seeing we have all one Father; one God made us and made us capable of being beneficial, or mischievous to our selves and one another. It is determin'd by our make as well as our Maker, that although all duty was ultimately owing to God, yet some was nextly owing to our selves and neighbours: That we who were bound to <HI>Love God superlatively for his own sake,</HI> should be bound to love our selves, and our neighbours in <HI>Subordination to God</HI> and <HI>for his sake.</HI> If God had intended, to have sent out man into the world like the wild Ass free, he would have made him like him: but seeing he made man after his own Image in holiness and righte∣ousness, he must needs be obliged to live according to it. Seeing man was made <HI>by God</HI> and <HI>like God,</HI> &amp; <HI>for God</HI>; it must of necessity be mans duty to live <HI>to God</HI> &amp; <HI>like God</HI>: and seeing that the Moral Law bears the Image of Gods holiness and righteousness, it must needs be immutable; and till man ceaseth to be Gods Creature, or God ceaseth to be holy &amp; righteous (which can never be) mans obligation to be holy and righteous, is as sacred and inviolable as ever; and if no People or place can either fairly or safely pretend to exemption from the Moral Law, least of all may Christian Plantations or Countries.</P>
<P><HI>Reason</HI> 2. Although the Primitive Apostasy hath many wayes mortifyed mans ability to keep the Law, yet it hath no ways nullifyed the Laws au∣thority, or mans duty. God is <HI>God still,</HI> as holy
<PB N="13" REF="000850_0025_0FABA2C35AF4D930"/>
and righteous as ever he was, and man is as much Gods Creature as ever he was; Gods due therefore and our duty as to holiness &amp; righteous∣ness is the same, and no just exemption or dispensa∣tion can be pretended by any, and least of all by Christians, who are in part recovered to the Image of God, and have his Law written on their hearts.</P>
<P><HI>Reason</HI> 3. From <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Moses</HI> mankind was held under the direction and authority of this Law, and although the Covenant of Grace was some way dispens'd though darkly, whereby it appeared that some were exempt from the <HI>Curse of the law,</HI> yet was there not the least intimation that any were released from under the <HI>Obligation of it to O∣bedience.</HI> Paul in <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.13. proveth indisputably that the Law was in the world before the <HI>Sinai-Promulgation</HI> of it, and the History of <HI>Cain, Abel, Seth, Enoch, Noah,</HI> &amp;c. offer irrefragable proof that God insisted on holiness and righteousness in the old world; though the <HI>old world was destroyed, yet was not the old law abolished:</HI> the <HI>New world</HI> was equally obliged to holiness and righteousness, if not more, seeing they had <HI>seen one day of Judgment,</HI> &amp; the flood come upon the ungodly and unrighteous, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.5. <HI>Job</HI> 22.15, 16, 17. <HI>Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden? whose foundation was over flown with a flood &amp;c.</HI> Though the <HI>Language</HI> of man was confounded, yet was not the <HI>Law</HI> confounded at <HI>Babel,</HI> nor did the <HI>Abraha∣mitical
<PB N="14" REF="000850_0026_0FABA2C5E88F4530"/>
Covenant,</HI> or <HI>Gospel</HI> as Preached to <HI>Abraham</HI> discharge him or his Posterity from the Authority of the Law, requiring holiness and righteousness: as the History of <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> and his <HI>Posterity</HI> sheweth.</P>
<P><HI>Reason</HI> 4. The peculiar Covenant which God made with the <HI>Jews</HI> of which <HI>Moses</HI> was Mediator, did make them a people nearer and dearer to God than other people, but did no ways free them from Obligation to holiness and righteousness; nay it was far from it: as is evident by the fresh pro∣mulgation of the Law, by Gods own Voice, and the engraving it in Tables of Stone by his own Finger, and the alluring motives to Obedience, <HI>viz.</HI> the Promises &amp; the Coercive Sanctions of the Law, <HI>viz.</HI> the threatnings, &amp; their own personal obliging themselves to very exact obedience. So far was the law of holiness and righteousness, from being abrogated, that the Jews had it re-enforced upon them with new motives from Law and Gratitude, and the judicial proceedings of God with that peo∣ple leave it past dispute.</P>
<P><HI>Reason</HI> 5. The Gospel doth no ways relax the authority of the Royal Law, as it is a rule of holy and righteous living Our Saviour sayeth, <HI>Think not that I am come to destroy the Law</HI>; implying that licentious men would be apt to <HI>think so,</HI> and pretend Gospel for the transgressions of the Law. See <HI>Math.</HI> 5.17. Our Saviour asserts the very con∣trary, that he did not come to <HI>destroy it,</HI> but to <HI>fulfill it</HI>; he humbled himself to be made under
<PB N="15" REF="000850_0027_0FABA2C69B3879B0"/>
the Law, and he honoured the Law by yielding perfect Obedience to it, when we had dishonoured the Law by disobeying of it. <HI>Zacharias</HI> his triumph in the <HI>prospect of Christ</HI> was <HI>that we might serve God in holiness and righteousness all our days without fear,</HI> (that is, without servile &amp; tormenting fear) not without that which is filial, and reve∣rential, <HI>Luk.</HI> 1.74, 75. And <HI>Paul</HI> being become a <HI>Christian</HI> did not account himself <HI>without law,</HI> but <HI>under the law to Christ, and exercised himself to keep a Conscience void of offence toward God and toward men.</HI> 1 Cor. 9.21. Act. 24.16. Paul was an emi∣nent Minister of Jesus Christ, and Preached the <HI>unsearchable riches of Christ,</HI> and yet declareth to the Romans, <HI>that the wrath of God is revealed from Hea∣ven, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.</HI> Rom. 1.18. and in many other texts to the same effect: So that if the Apostle say less by way of motive from temporal rewards &amp; punishments, it is partly because that is said already under the old Testament, which is still in use and force, as to holiness and righteousness; and because that praetermission is abundantly recompenced, by the frequent mention of eternal rewards and pun∣ishments. 1 Cor. 6.9. <HI>Know ye not that the unrigh∣teous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI> Heb. 12.14. <HI>Without holiness no man shall see the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reason</HI> 6. The Christian Profession layeth a special obligation on such professing people to ex∣cell in holiness and righteousness. Because <HI>they
<PB N="16" REF="000850_0028_0FABA2C832FEA060"/>
profess they take the holy and righteous God for their God,</HI> and <HI>Jesus Christ the righteous for their Lord and Saviour,</HI> and devote themselvs to him: and by <HI>Baptism,</HI> like an <HI>Oath of Allegiance,</HI> oblige themselves to imitate and obey him, and constantly to pray to be <HI>Renewed after his Image in holiness and righte∣ousness</HI>; and profess themselves moved to holiness and righteousness, by the Spirit of Christ, the Grace of Christ, the Law of Christ, the Love of Christ, the Example of Christ, the Name and Ho∣nour of Christ, and by the hopes and fears of the unseen future and eternal World. You have the proof of the first Doctrine. I proceed to illustrate and confirm the second Doctrine.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> II. That such People and Places as profess the Christian Religion, may expect to be Happy or Miserable, according as it goeth with them, as to Holiness and Righteousness.</P>
<P>The weight of it bears upon these four Pillars.</P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem</HI> had formerly not only been <HI>called,</HI> but had <HI>been</HI> an <HI>Habitation of Righteousness, and a Mountain of Holiness</HI>; and that then they were <HI>Saluted of men,</HI> loved, esteem'd and pray'd for by men, and <HI>Blessed by God</HI>; that thus it was <HI>once,</HI> is evident. <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.3. <HI>Israel was ho∣liness to the Lord,</HI> that is, <HI>very holy, the first fruits of his increase:</HI> that is, they were Consecrated to God, as the first fruits of mankind; they were holy to
<PB N="17" REF="000850_0029_0FABA2C89FFEBC20"/>
God and his Service, and not to be devoured by <HI>Strangers,</HI> but at their pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> In the <HI>Love of their Espousals</HI> they followed the Lord into the Wilderness, like to what is prophesyed of the One hundred forty four thousand. Rev. 14.1. <HI>They appeared on Mount Sion with the Lamb, and have his fathers name written on their foreheads:</HI> and for purity of Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and Manners, fol∣low the Lamb wheresoever he goeth. <HI>Jerusalem</HI> had been a very <HI>faithful City,</HI> true to God and his Worship, free from the unchast embraces of Ido∣latry and Superstition, neither was she then pollu∣ted with the prophanation of holy things or time. It had also abounded &amp; excelled in righteousness: <HI>it was full of Judgment, Righteousness lodged in it.</HI> Isa. 1.21. If you had lookt for Charity, Equity Honesty, Verity and fair Dealing, yea Justice <HI>Commutative</HI> or <HI>Distributive,</HI> you might have found them <HI>dwelling</HI> in <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> And while things went thus, they were very happy; <HI>the Ha∣bitation of their Righteousness was prosperous</HI>: they had peace and plenty, health and safety. This is so evident that the Lord appeals to themselves whether it was not so. Jer. 22.15. <HI>Did not thy father eat and drink and do Justice and Judgment, and then it was well with him.</HI> So Jer. 2.5. <HI>What Iniquity have your fathers found in me?</HI> implying that till they causelesly departed from God, things went <HI>well</HI> with them. Yet must not this be so strictly taken as if ever there was a time in <HI>Israel,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="000850_0030_0FABA2C95AD1D070"/>
wherein there was no unholiness and unrighteous∣ness in them; that the Priests, Rulers and People were perfectly holy and righteous, exactly con∣formable to the Moral Law: for they were sin∣ners by nature, and were, at best, liable to humane infirmities and frailties, yea in their best times, there was something <HI>wanting that could not be num∣bred, and something crooked that could not be made streight,</HI> as their history sheweth; and therefore any Expression that may blush otherwise, must be understood comparatively, not absolutely. So when they are said to have been happy, very hap∣py, it must not be understood as if they had no Calamity or Sorrow, but that no <HI>desolating destroy∣ing evil</HI> tell upon them: when in <HI>Solomons</HI> time it is said, that they had no <HI>adversary or evil oc∣current,</HI> it must be understood <HI>Comparatively,</HI> and so the sence is, there had been a time when holi∣ness and righteousness had flourished extraordina∣rily in <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and at that time they were extraordinarily happy, enjoyed the favour of God in very peculiar Instances, and had a very great confluence of Gods Bounties and Benefits.</P>
<P N="2">2. That in <HI>Jeremiah's</HI> time all ranks and orders of men were grown very degenerate and were greatly corrupted, and were become very unhap∣py, almost as miserable as misery could make them. <HI>In Isaiah's time,</HI> which was considerably before this; <HI>the faithful City was become an Harlot,</HI> and they were over run and over-grown with violence
<PB N="19" REF="000850_0031_0FABA2CD1A28C700"/>
and unrighteousness of every kind. <HI>In stead of Judgment there was Oppression, in stead of Righteous∣ness, there was a Cry.</HI> Isa. 1.21. and 5.7. But in <HI>Je∣remiah's time,</HI> they were heightned and hardned in all their wickedness, and were unteachable, im∣perswadable and incorrigible. <HI>The chief of the Priests and the People transgressed very much after all the Abominations of the Heathen, and had polluted the house of the Lord</HI>; and despised all the Patience &amp; Com∣passion of their God, and complyed with none of the methods of his grace to reclaim them; but <HI>Stiffned their necks and hardened their hearts, from turning to the Lord God of Israel. They mocked his Messengers and Messages,</HI> and misused his Prophets, till the <HI>wrath of the Lord arose against his people, &amp; there was no remedy.</HI> 2 Chron. 36.14, 15, 16. Then wrath and ruin of every kind invaded them, and broke in upon them, till they were taken and car∣ried into Captivity: and <HI>Jeremiah</HI> was in this, one of the unhappiest of all the holy Prophets, in that he lived to see his woful <HI>Prophesies</HI> turned into <HI>History.</HI> The man that did not only <HI>foresee,</HI> but lived to <HI>see affliction by the rod of Gods Wrath</HI>: yea he lived to write <HI>doleful Lamentati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns</HI> over the <HI>Accomplishment</HI> of his <HI>own direful</HI> and <HI>dis∣mal Prophesies,</HI> and to <HI>see</HI> the People as <HI>miserable</HI> as he had <HI>seen</HI> them <HI>sinful.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That it was not only so as you have heard in <HI>one instance,</HI> but it was <HI>Gods way and manner</HI> of dealing with his <HI>own</HI> People the <HI>Jews,</HI> to deal out
<PB N="20" REF="000850_0032_0FABA2CD1FE58700"/>
happiness or misery to them, according as they dealt with him, in matters of holiness and righ∣teousness: whilst they were with God, in <HI>wayes of duty,</HI> God was wont to be with them <HI>in wayes of mercy,</HI> to bless and prosper them: but when they walkt <HI>Contrary to God,</HI> his way was to walk <HI>Contrary to them</HI>; when it was their way to grieve him with their impieties and iniquities, it was his way to vex them with various adversities. See 2 Chron. 15.2. <HI>The Lord is with you while ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be with him, and if ye seek him, he will be found of you: but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.</HI> V. 3. <HI>Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching Priest, and without Law.</HI> The ten tribes had been so from their revolt, which was about Thirty years, and for that time, there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, for God did vex them with all adversity: See the 5<HI>th.</HI> &amp; 6<HI>st Verses</HI> That God did promise them the greatest mercies &amp; blessings, on condition of Obedience to his Laws &amp; Statutes, and threatned them with the greatest curses and miseries, in case of revo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and disobedience, is un∣gainsayable, if you read and consider, <HI>Levi.</HI> 26. throughout, and <HI>Deut.</HI> 28. throughout. And the way of God was accordingly. So that if a man had known before hand how that People would have acted towards God and one another, he might have written their History in a good mea∣sure, before things came to pass. Hence they were
<PB N="21" REF="000850_0033_0FABA2CE4358F2E8"/>
so condemned for <HI>not knowing the way of the Lord,</HI> which means, not only the way of his Doctrine, but of his Discipline and Providential Dispensati∣ons, <HI>Jer.</HI> 5.4. <HI>Therefore I said, surely these are poor, they are foolish for they know not the way of the Lord, nor the judgment of our God.</HI> Yet must not this be so strictly taken, as if God dealt with them accord∣ing to their deserts; for had they been dealt with according to the <HI>First Covenant,</HI> they were never good enough to <HI>deserve</HI> the Blessings; they were always bad enough to <HI>deserve</HI> greater. Wrath than ever fell upon them. They were always less then the least of Gods Mercies, &amp; God always punish∣ed them less than their Iniquities deserved; and upon their Repentance, Humiliation and Reforma∣tion; God was always ready to pardon, and turn their Curses into Blessings; as upon their Aposta∣cies and Declensions, he turned their Blessings in∣to Curses: and was wont to distinguish between weakness and wickedness, between Sins of <HI>Infirmi∣ty,</HI> and Sins of <HI>Enormity.</HI> His Severities were for the most part against presumptuous Sinners, and such Sins as violated the Covenant. There were also, at that time by Divine Appointment, Sacrifi∣ces of Expiation and Atonement, not only for <HI>par∣ticular persons,</HI> but for the <HI>Congregation</HI>; not only for the Sins of <HI>private persons,</HI> but of the <HI>Priests</HI> &amp; <HI>Rulers</HI> also. Hence in Judgment God remembred mercy; <HI>many a time he forgave them, and did not stir up all his wrath</HI>: and in some instances his Judg∣ments
<PB N="22" REF="000850_0034_0FABA2CEA06FC1B8"/>
were <HI>unaccountable:</HI> but <HI>ordinarily</HI> they were <HI>as the light,</HI> and the Equity of them very discern∣able.</P>
<P N="4">4. Gods Judicial Proceedings with the <HI>Jews</HI> be∣fore the Coming of Christ, are instructive to peo∣ple, and places professing the Christian Religion; that it is like to fare with them as to happiness or misery, according as it goeth with them, as to Holiness and Righteousness. For the proof of this, I offer to your consideration the following Arguments, which for brevity, I shall but name.</P>
<P N="1">1 That God is the same now, as he was then, as holy and righteous as ever he was. Did he then <HI>love Righteousness,</HI> and <HI>bate Iniquity</HI>? So he doth still; therefore his Way and Discipline is like to be much what the same now, as it was then.</P>
<P N="2">2. His Church is the same Church now, though not the same people: God hath but <HI>One Church,</HI> Christ hath but <HI>one Body</HI>; from the beginning to the end of the World. <HI>Cant.</HI> 6.9. <HI>Eph</HI> 5.23, 25, 27.</P>
<P N="3">3. This Law requiring Holiness and Righteous∣ness, is the same: <HI>not one tittle of it is passed away.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Gods Name and Honour is alike concerned in the ways and behaviour of his people now, as it was then. Did the Sins of the <HI>Jews, give occasion to the Enemies of the Lord to blaspheme</HI>? 2 Sam 12.14. So do the Sins of Christians now. See 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6 1. <HI>That his Name and Doctrine be not blasphemed.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. They were under the Covenant of <HI>Grace</HI> as

<P>All this notwithstanding, I would not be under∣stood, as if the Dispensations of God now did exactly quadrate with his Dispensations to the <HI>Jews,</HI> before Christ came: The Church was then in its non-age, and under a certain Tutorage proper to that time, when the promises and threatnings that relate to the other World, were more darkly and more rarely mentioned: and temporal pro∣mises and threatnings more frequently insisted on, and the accomplishment more visible and conspi∣cuous, and Dispensations more Corporal; &amp; God did more visibly plague Disobedience, and reward Obedience, than now: although he hath not left

<P>Thus you have the second Doctrine Explained and Confirmed: I proceed to Explain &amp; Confirm the third and last Doctrine.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="000850_0038_0FABA2D3A75C3F88"/><HI>DOCT.</HI> III. That although Places that have been Habitations of Righteousness and Mountains of Holi∣ness, should become very degenerate, and for their Sin be made very desolate; yet there is ground of hope that God will again Restore, Reform and Bless them.</P>
<P>In the third Doctrine there are three particulars contained: the two first more implicitely, the third most expressly.</P>
<P N="1">1. That places that have been eminent for the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ofession and practice of holiness &amp; righteousness, may become very degenerate: they <HI>may,</HI> that is, <HI>possibly</HI>; not <HI>lawfully. Judea</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem</HI> offer a woful conviction of this: <HI>That Kingdom of Priests, that holy Nation,</HI> in which Religion &amp; Justice some time <HI>dwelt</HI> and flourished, was in <HI>Jeremiah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> time degenerate, revolted and gone, all ranks &amp; orders of men had greatly corrupted themselves. This hath been already demonstrated, and the Churches that were of the <HI>Apostles</HI> planting, if we compare the Scripture account of them, with Ecclesiastical history concerning them, and their affairs, it would call for <HI>tears,</HI> rather than further <HI>testimony.</HI> De∣clension is down hill and natural; Corruption weighs men down ward.</P>
<Q>— Facilis descensus Averni.</Q>
<P><HI>The heart of man is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.</HI> Man hath long since forfeited his reputation, <HI>being in honour he abode not,</HI> and
<PB N="27" REF="000850_0039_0FABA2D706B75088"/>
ever since beareth the reproach of being a false de∣ceitful creature. <HI>Surely men of low degree are va∣nity and men of high degree are a lie, to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.</HI> Psa. 62.9. If men deal falsely and basely and treache∣rously with God, they do but like themselves. <HI>Hos.</HI> 6.7. <HI>They like men</HI> (or like <HI>Adam</HI> as it may be ren∣dred) <HI>have transgressed my Covenant, there have they dealt treacherously with me.</HI> Besides, Mortality, in a little time, carrieth off the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age, the Rulers, Leaders, Teachers, and best examples of the flock. Degrees of true Grace may be lost, and the re∣mainders be weakned and obscured: that which only <HI>seemed</HI> to be true Grace, may be <HI>utterly lost,</HI> and that goodness that sprang from, and depended upon external motive; when the Sun and the wind rise, will pass away like <HI>a morning Cloud</HI>: the subtle insinuations of Seducers, a Spirit of error, the force of evil examples, New temptations and occasions, all, or many of them some times do as it were conspire to bring on defection &amp; Apostasy: and when it is so, it is no wonder, it woful de∣generation ensue.</P>
<P N="2">2. Places that are become degenerate, howso∣ever happy they were before, may become very miserable, very desolate. It was so with <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> The Lamentations of <HI>Jeremiah</HI> afford plentiful proof of this, and the desolations and ruins of the Churches mentioned in the <HI>New Testament</HI> sufficiently prove it may be so. If men
<PB N="28" REF="000850_0040_0FABA2D80D0413B8"/>
do but <HI>like men,</HI> when they make defection, and revolt from Religion and Virtue; God doth but <HI>like God,</HI> when hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Jealousy burns like fire against such a People; and he brings sorrows and miseries upon them, even unto Desolation.</P>
<P N="3">3. Notwithstanding such degeneration and de∣solation too, there is ground of hope, that God will again restore, reform and bless such a People. I shall prove this position by producing the grounds of Hope the Scriptures offer in this case.</P>
<P N="1">1. God <HI>Can</HI> do it if he <HI>Will.</HI> That is not altoge∣ther <HI>incredible</HI> which is not <HI>impossible.</HI> What can not <HI>Omnipotency</HI> do? Unbelief and distrust is many times bottom'd upon scrupling the Power of God. Psa. 78.19, 20 <HI>They said, Can God furnish a Table in the Wilderness? can he give bread also? can he pro∣vide flesh for his people?</HI> So that they are taxt with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>believing in God, nor trusting in his Salvation</HI>▪ No wonder they did not believe God <HI>would,</HI> when they did not believe God <HI>could</HI> provide for them. If <HI>Abraham</HI> had Staggered at the promise through unbelief of <HI>Gods Power,</HI> he had not been father of many Nation. But against hope he believed in hope, knowing that <HI>God quickned the dead and called things that are not, as if they were. He was strong in faith, giving glory to God, being fully per∣swaded that what he had promised he was able to per∣form.</HI> Rom. 4 17, 18, 20, 21. Such a degenerate and desolate People, are much in circumstances for <HI>Restoration</HI> and <HI>Reformation,</HI> as the bodies of <HI>A∣braham</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="000850_0041_0FABA2D864026A10"/>
and <HI>Sarah</HI> were in for <HI>Propagation</HI>▪ But what cant he do that quickens the dead? The belief of Gods power facilitates the belief of his good will. So it was in the Lepers saith; <HI>Lord if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</HI> That which seemeth impossible to men because of their <HI>impo∣tency,</HI> is not difficult to God because of his <HI>Omni∣potency</HI>: Though this case be very difficult, next to impossible, yet it is not desperate: for <HI>with God all things are possible.</HI> The <HI>Lord of hosts</HI> can restore, reform, and bless a degenerate, desolate People.</P>
<P N="2">2. God not only can if he will, but <HI>may</HI> if he please. What <HI>may</HI> not he do in a way of mercy, who is mercy it self, and hath mercy upon whom he will have mercy? Rom. 9.15. <HI>I will have com∣passion, upon whom I will have compassion.</HI> Infinite mercy can find motive in it self, when there is none in the Creature, and divine Soveraignty is not to be <HI>Counselled</HI> or <HI>Controlled</HI> by any Creature. <HI>If he will have compassion, he will have it.</HI> If God be pleased to restore and reform such a people, whom doth he wrong? What Attribute or Word of his, doth he cross or contradict? If then Gods power render him <HI>able</HI> to do it, may not his Soveraign Grace, and Mercy render him <HI>willing</HI> to do it? <HI>Once hath God spoken, twice have I heard this, that power belongeth unto God, also unto thee O Lord belongeth Mercy.</HI> Psa. 62.11, 12.</P>
<P N="3">3. God hath done so <HI>already</HI> for his Church and professing P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ople. <HI>viz.</HI> The Jews and that more
<PB N="30" REF="000850_0042_0FABA2D92A383270"/>
than once, or twice. And that which <HI>hath</HI> been, <HI>may</HI> be; and is the more easy to be believed. This sort of Argumentation is used for a help to faith. Isa. 51.9, 10, 11. <HI>Awake, awake, O Arm of the Lord, as in the Ancient days, art not thou it that hath cut Raba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and wounded the dragon? Art thou not it that hast dryed the Sea? therefore the ransomed of the Lord shall return to Sion with singing.</HI> So 2 Cor. 1.10. <HI>Who delivered us from so great a death and doth deli∣ver: in whom we trust, he will yet deliver.</HI> If God should restore, reform and bless such a degenerate and desolate people, it would not be the <HI>first time.</HI> Though God may seem to have cast off a pro∣fessing people; yet he may chuse them a <HI>second time,</HI> it is no more than he hath done in the like case. Zech. 2.12. <HI>The Lord shall inherit Judah and choose Jerusalem again.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Notwithstanding wrath is come upon the Jews to the <HI>uttermost</HI> because they sinned to the <HI>uttermost</HI> in rejecting and crucifying <HI>the Son of God,</HI> yet, not without cause, we believe and expect that God will again restore, reform and bless them. Though they are <HI>Unchurched</HI> and <HI>Unpeopled</HI> and have been miserable as misery can make them: yet the Oracles of God give incouragement to be∣lieve that they shall again be recovered. It were endless to quote all the old Testament texts brought by those that write on this Subject; among which my Text and Context is improved by Dr. <HI>Gouge</HI> &amp; others, &amp; Paul in <HI>Rom▪</HI> 11.27. renders it indisputable.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="000850_0043_0FABA2D9E1874080"/><HI>Obj.</HI> If it be granted concerning the <HI>Jews,</HI> what is that to the Christian <HI>Gentiles?</HI> This text speaks of the Jews, <HI>Thus saith the God of Israel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That this and many other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>exts of like im∣port do nextly belong to the Jews, I have already granted: but that doth not prove that by way of <HI>Analogy,</HI> this and such like texts do not belong to <HI>Christian Churches</HI> consisting of Jews or Gentiles, or both. I pray consider, who are the <HI>Israel of God now</HI>: Are not all that believe, <HI>Children of A∣braham? and heirs according to promise? Is n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Blessing of Abraham</HI> come upon the <HI>Gentiles? Is God the God of the Jews only? is he not of the Gen∣tiles also?</HI> Rom. 3.29. Although the Ephesians du∣ring their Heathenism <HI>were Strangers to the Cove∣nants of promise and aliens from the common wealth of Israel</HI>; yet I hope they were not so after they were Converted and Christianized. No, they who <HI>be∣fore were afar off, were made nigh by the blood of Christ; who broke down the middle wall of partition and made both one</HI>; and now they <HI>were no more Strangers and Forreigners, but fellow Citizens with the Saints, and were built upon the foundation of the Pro∣phets as well as Apostles, &amp;c.</HI> What? is there <HI>Jew</HI> and <HI>Greek, Scythian</HI> and <HI>Barbarian</HI> still? surely they are all <HI>one</HI> in <HI>Christ Jesus.</HI> Eph. 2.12, 13, Gal. 3.28. Col. 3.11.</P>
<P N="5">5. There be Prophesies in the <HI>New-Testament,</HI> that contain in them promises of Restauration, Re∣formation, and Blessing to Churches, that were

<HEAD>USE I.</HEAD>
<P>Of <HI>Instruction,</HI> To teach us. That Holiness and Righteousness have an everlasting amiableness and excellency in them. In God, they are the <HI>Essence</HI> of God, in Angels and men, they are the <HI>Image of
<PB N="34" REF="000850_0046_0FABA2E1FA985DC0"/>
God</HI>; they are Essential to the <HI>Being</HI> of God, and they are Essential to the <HI>Well-being</HI> of Angels and men, they are the best adjunct, and Epithete that rational creatures are capable of. Take Holiness and Righteousness from Angels, and they become Devils; take them from men, and they become like Beasts, yea, worse; not only earthly &amp; sensual but devilish also. The dignity of mans first Estate, consisted in holiness and righteousness after the I∣mage of God: the ignominy and damnablenes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of mans lost Estate, consists in his sinning, and co∣ming short of the glory of God; that is, of his glorious Image, consisting in holiness and righte∣ousness. The sanity and felicity of mans best and last Estate, consists in being recovered to the image and favour of God by Jesus Christ. Whilst man was holy and righteous, God loved him as his <HI>Friend,</HI> and when man became unholy and unrigh∣teous, God loath'd him as his <HI>Enemy</HI>; and although God may love him with a love of <HI>Benevolence</HI> &amp; of <HI>Beneficence,</HI> yet he cannot love him with a compleat love of <HI>complacency</HI> and delight; till he is recovered to holiness and righteousness again. As Sin is a reproach to any person, people or place; on the contrary, holiness and righteousness are a credit and honour to them; it was the glory of the Ci∣ty, that was the joy and praise of the whole earth, that it was a habitation of righteousness, &amp; moun∣tain of holiness▪ yea, it is the glory of the <HI>New Jerusalem,</HI> it is called the <HI>Holy City,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Jerusalem</HI> Rev 21 2, 10. 'tis the peculiar excellency
<PB N="35" REF="000850_0047_0FABA2E259431250"/>
of the <HI>New Heavens</HI> and <HI>New Earth, that righteous∣ness dwelleth therein.</HI> 2 Pet. 3.13. The unconceiva∣ble glory of the Heaven of Heavens consists more in its <HI>holiness,</HI> than in its <HI>heighth</HI>; though it tran∣scend in both. It is the throne of Gods holiness, the holy of holyes, was but a Type of it. The highest excellency of the heavenly Courtiers that wait round the throne of God, is their holiness: and yet that is dim in comparison of the <HI>HOLY JESUS,</HI> who is the Fountain of all the holiness &amp; righteousness the Saints on earth have. There are some few Saints whose bodies as well as Souls are already glorifyed, and the Spirits of just men made perfect, who have received perfection of holiness. Oh! what a holy place is heaven, that is full of holiness; yea so full, that it doth as it were run over! <HI>The skyes pour down holiness</HI> and <HI>righte∣ousness</HI>: there is none upon earth, but what comes down from <HI>Heaven,</HI> even from <HI>the God of all Grace,</HI> and the <HI>God of Glory,</HI> who is <HI>glorious in Holiness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To teach us what a wicked and woful estate man fell into, in the primitive Apostasy. He fell from a state of holiness and righteousness, into a state of unholiness and unrighteousness. If man had continued in the state wherein he was created, every Man and Woman and Child, had been a habitation of righteousness and mountain of holi∣ness. Every Family, every Society, had been a habitation of righteousness and mountain of holiness: for <HI>God made man upright, or right</HI>;
<PB N="36" REF="000850_0048_0FABA2E31D374368"/>
that is holy and righteous. Eccles. 7.29<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Man was then a <HI>Vessel of honour, sanctified and meet for the matters use.</HI> Holiness and Righ∣teousness were <HI>Concreate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> with, and <HI>Connatural</HI> to him; but alas! it is far otherwise now. Though it be our duty to be <HI>habitually</HI> and <HI>actually</HI> holy &amp; righteous, yet we are stript of the <HI>moral</HI> Image of God, empty of Grace, bent to act according to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> corrupt Biass we have derived from the first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ which wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us away from God and his holy ways; and strongly inclines us to Unholiness and Unrighteousness. Instead of being a habitati∣on of righteousness, the heart of man is become a cage of every impious, unclean and hateful lust, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.19. Men are by nature since the fall, full of enmity against God; inordinately and idola∣trously in love wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h themselves; and uncharitable, and injurious unto others. How miserably were our first Parents deceived! Under a pretence of be∣ing like to God, they lost his image and favour.</P>
<P N="3">3. To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>each us, That the grace and love of God towards fallen man is very wonderful, in that God gave his only Son to recover poor lost sinners out of that wicked and woful estate of unholiness and unrighteousness, that such as believe on him may be pardoned and justifyed freely through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus, and that by the Grace of God bestowed on them in Regenera∣tion and Sanctification, they might be recovered to the Image of <HI>God</HI> again, to put off the old man,
<PB N="37" REF="000850_0049_0FABA2E3D2BB8840"/>
the corrupt nature derived from the <HI>first Adam,</HI> &amp; to put on the new man, the grace and holiness that is from Jesus Christ the <HI>second Adam,</HI> whereby they become again after the Image of God in ho∣liness and righteousness <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.22, 23, 24 There had never been among the Posterity of fallen man a habitation of righteousness and mountain of ho∣liness, had it not been for this wonderful love of God in Christ Jesus: for mankind was <HI>all gone aside, they were altogether become filthy, there is none that doeth good no not one.</HI> Psa. 14.3. If therefore any of the race, do become holy and righteous, and do good again; we may conclude that they were created in Christ Jesus to good works; for by na∣ture they are dead in trespasses and sins.</P>
<P N="4">4. To teach us, That it is a vile abuse of Christ and his Gospel, and the doctrine of the free grace of God, to make as if Christians were thereby freed from the direction and authority of the Moral Law; or that the motives to Obedience to it were abated by the Gospel. It is certain that Christ did not <HI>Obey</HI> the law, that we might have liberty to <HI>Break</HI> it; nor did he suffer that we might have liberty to violate it with impunity: but that we might be saved from the Curse of the law, and from the dominion of sin; and might be the Servants of God, and have our fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. Although the law was never given to fallen man as a Cove∣nant whereby he could be justifyed, yet doth it
<PB N="38" REF="000850_0050_0FABA2E61B5F7A10"/>
continue as a Rule of life. And the Lord Jesus is so far from abolishing it, that <HI>he puts it into the in∣ward parts of believers, and writes it in their hearts.</HI> Jer. 31.33. It was the error of the Jews in the A∣postles time, to think the law was given as a Co∣venant of Works; by the keeping of which they might be justifyed, and have eternal life. Against this the Apostle argues, that the inheritance, was by <HI>Promise,</HI> and that God gave it to <HI>Abraham by promise,</HI> and the law which was given at Sinai 430 years after, could not disanul it; and makes it an absurd thing for any to think that righteousness comes by the law, and if so saith he, <HI>then Christ is dead in vain.</HI> Gal. 2.21. Gal. 3.17, 18, 21. The Jews took the law in that sence, as when <HI>Luther</HI> calls it <HI>Moses Mosissimus,</HI> a strict Covenant of works; but had lost that sence of it wherein <HI>Luther</HI> calls it <HI>Moses Aaronicus.</HI> A darker dispensation of the Covenant of grace, a <HI>Schoolmaster</HI> to bring them to Christ. The Apostle knew how to urge Obedi∣ence to the moral law, and to lay men under ob∣ligation to holiness and righteousness by its autho∣rity and motives; without urging a necessity of perfect and <HI>personal Obedience</HI> to it, in order to Justification, and eternal life. He could and did urge it, as a <HI>Rule</HI> of life, without making it a <HI>Cove∣nant</HI> of life, and rule whereby men could be justi∣fyed. Acts 13.38, 39. <HI>Through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins, and by him all that be∣live are justifyed from all things, from which you could
<PB N="39" REF="000850_0051_0FABA2E6B7A072B0"/>
not be justifyed by the law of Moses.</HI> He could deny the law to justify: and yet not make Christ the Minister of sin. He could preach the free grace of God; without casting any blemish upon the law, or incouraging Sinners to continue in sin, because grace had abounded. <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.1. Compared with the foregoing Chapter: and did maintain that <HI>the grace of God which bringeth Salvation</HI> agreeth with the law in this, <HI>it teacheth men to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously and Godly in this present world.</HI> Titus 2.11, 12.</P>
<P N="5">5. To teach us, That Christians in the times of the <HI>Gospel</HI> may and ought to make use of the Scriptures of the <HI>Old Testament</HI> for their Instruction, Example &amp; Comfort. Although the Ceremonial law be totally abolisht as to its <HI>Practice,</HI> yet for∣asmuch as it typed out or prefigured Christ; his Graces, Actions, Sufferings and benefits, and was some way instructive about moral duties: the understanding of it is many ways useful to Christi∣ans; as might be shewed in <HI>Apostolical</HI> argumen∣tations. So <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. throughout. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.8, 9, 13, 14. The judicial law so far as it was <HI>local</HI> and <HI>peculiar to the Jews,</HI> binds not: yet so far as it was of <HI>moral Equity,</HI> it ought to be observed in Christian States; and <HI>Caeteris paribus</HI> and <HI>Consideratis Conside∣randis,</HI> is of Excellent use to all <HI>Lawgivers</HI> and <HI>Judges</HI> to the end of the world: for that People were under a <HI>Theocrasy,</HI> and their <HI>judicial Laws</HI> were of <HI>divine legislation,</HI> for the most part. If any
<PB N="40" REF="000850_0052_0FABA2E7CA501748"/>
were otherwise, they had at least <HI>divine approbation.</HI> The <HI>moral law</HI> is all of it of <HI>everlasting equity</HI> and <HI>amiableness</HI> as we have shewed; as Holy, Righte∣ous, and Good, in <HI>Paul's</HI> time, as in <HI>Moses's</HI> time. <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.12. And in <HI>our times,</HI> as in <HI>Moses's</HI> or <HI>Pauls. For till heaven and earth pass, one jot or title of the law shall in no wise pass,</HI> Math. 5.18. The <HI>Assemblies</HI> reflection on this text is,
<Q>How much more need∣ful is this Doctrine when men would make <HI>all</HI> the law void, and not obligatory to believers.</Q>
Its <HI>Historys</HI> are our <HI>Examples</HI>; either of <HI>imitation</HI> or <HI>caution.</HI> 1 Cor. 10. <HI>Now these things were our Examples,</HI> that is saith the <HI>English</HI> Annotations,
<Q>God set the punishment of those Israelites as a glass or image before us, that we in them might see what we may expect, if we sin as they did.</Q>
In the following verses the Apostle dehorts from Idolatry, Fornication, Tempting Christ, and the sin of Murmuring; from Examples of caution written of old; But, saith the Apostle, <HI>they were written for our Admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come.</HI> v.11 So <HI>Heb.</HI> 3.19 compared with <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.1. <HI>So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief. Let us therefore fear</HI> &amp;c. So <HI>Esau's</HI> Example of selling his birth right for one morsel, is urged by way of caution. <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.16. We have also Examples of <HI>Imi∣tation</HI> taken out of the Old Testament, &amp; improv'd in the New. So in <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. The Examples of <HI>Ante∣diluvian Patriarchs</HI> and <HI>Postdiluvian Patriarchs,</HI> and Kings, Priests, and Prophets, Judges and Military
<PB N="41" REF="000850_0053_0FABA2E81FA7ED78"/>
Commanders, all famous for Exploits of Faith, Worship, and Obedience; are set before Christians for <HI>Imitation.</HI> And the Apostle argues from them, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.1. That <HI>Cloud of Witnesses</HI> are to be follow∣ed by Christians, as the <HI>Cloud</HI> was followed by the Israelites in the Wilderness. So <HI>Peter</HI> urgeth the Example of holy Women of old, and of <HI>Sarah</HI> in Particular, for to teach Christian Women Subjecti∣on to their Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bands, Conjugal Chastity, and Mo∣desty of Apparel. So <HI>Abrahams</HI> faith, and his justi∣fication by it, is set forth for an Example to Christians for their imitation, Rom. 4.4. <HI>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe.</HI> The like may be said of <HI>Promises</HI> and <HI>Threatnings</HI>; which are found Originally in the Old Testament, but improved in the New Testament. Of Promises, some that seem <HI>Natio∣nal,</HI> others <HI>Personal,</HI> are by way of <HI>Analogy</HI> transfer∣red to Christian People, as if they had been made nextly and directly to them. So <HI>Eph</HI> 6.1, 2. The Apostle Exhorting Christian Children, to obey &amp; honour their Parents, urgeth them to this duty.</P>
<P N="1">1. By the Intrinsical Goodness, and Immutable and Eternal Equity is in what he Exhorts them to. <HI>Children obey your Parents in the Lord for this is right. ΔΙΚΑΙΟΝ, Just.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. By the Authority of the fifth Commandment.</P>
<P N="3">3. By the Promise annexed; <HI>for this is the first Commandment with promise. i. e.</HI> the first of the Se∣cond
<PB N="42" REF="000850_0054_0FABA2E95F1CD800"/>
Table, for the second Command hath pro∣mise annexed to it. <HI>Showing mercy to thousands, (viz. of Generations)</HI> of <HI>them that love me and keep my Commandments. i. e.</HI> Ordinances and Instituti∣ons, means of Worship; free from Superstition, mens Inventions, and Will worship. When the Apostle saith <HI>the first Command with pro∣mise,</HI> he refers to those words, <HI>that thy days may be long in the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</HI> Which words in their next intention, are directed to Jewish Children; and mean a long and happy life in the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI>: but the Apostle wri∣ting to the Children of the Church at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> that had nothing to do with the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> alters the words by <HI>Analogy,</HI> and makes the promise run, <HI>that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayst live long upon the Earth.</HI> So the promise made next∣ly to <HI>Joshua, Josh.</HI> 1.5. <HI>I will never leave thee nor forsake thee</HI>: is by way of <HI>Analogical Accommodati∣on</HI> transferred to Christians. <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.5. So <HI>Davids</HI> confident conclusion <HI>Psal.</HI> 118.6. <HI>The Lord is on my side, I will not fear; What can man do unto me?</HI> is drawn into argumentation. <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.6. And the words that <HI>Solomon</HI> sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke to his Son. <HI>Prov</HI> 3.11. is said to speak to the <HI>Christian Hebrews.</HI> Heb. 12.5. <HI>Ye have forgotten the Exhortation,</HI> or that consolato¦ry Exhortation, <HI>which speaketh unto you as Children; My Son, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thou the Chastening of the Lord.</HI> Of Threatnings also applied by <HI>Analogy. Heb.</HI> 4.7.9, 11. I shall on this head only further show that
<PB N="43" REF="000850_0055_0FABA2E9ED81F2B8"/>
<HI>Prophesies</HI> in the Old Testament are of use to Chri∣stians; they help us in the belief of <HI>New-Testament Prophesies,</HI> many of them being already accom∣plisht, others also of them agree with Those in the <HI>Revelation,</HI> and illustrate one another, as the Text and the interpretation. So also, 2 Pet. 3.13. <HI>We according to his promise look for New Heavens and a New Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteousness:</HI> and ma∣ny Prophesies in the Old Testament, that flourish in expressions, literally expressing temporal felicity; yet were intended as <HI>Prophetick Types</HI> of Spiritual Blessings under the <HI>Messias.</HI> And they had some kind of accomplishment in Temporal Deliveran∣ces, Peace, Plenty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> before the Coming of Christ: but were more fully accomplisht in Spiritu∣al Redemption, and the Spiritual Priviledges, Be∣nefits and Graces, Enjoy'd in the Churches of Christ. If we consider what cognation there is between <HI>History</HI> and <HI>Prophesy,</HI> it will not seem strange. For <HI>Prophesie</HI> is History <HI>antedated</HI>; and History is <HI>Postdated Prophesie</HI>: the same thing is told in both. If therefore the <HI>History</HI> of the Old Testament is <HI>Example</HI> to us, and instructive to us; so must needs be Prophesy. And many things in the Old Testament are first set forth in Prophe∣sy; and afterward in History; &amp; either of them, yea, both of them beneficial to the Church. Be∣sides, Prophesies, for the most part, contain Pro∣mises, or Threatnings in them. And therefore if Old-Testament <HI>Promises</HI> and <HI>Threatnings</HI> are of use,
<PB N="44" REF="000850_0056_0FABA2EABAE5DD98"/>
and may be, by way of accommodation, appli∣ed to us; so may the <HI>Prophesies</HI> also. I have in∣sisted the larger on the foregoing head, not only to show how genuine the Doctrines raised from the Text, are; and to strengthen the foun∣dation on which I build the Superstructure of the Application I further intend: but to vindicate the just Reputation of the Sacred Scriptures of the Old Testament, from the indignity done them by those that speak of them, as of things <HI>formerly</HI> use∣ful, but now antiquated and out of date: as also for the benefit of those that esteem them, by way of Direction, how to use them; that the Old and New-Testament, may be used by us as two breasts of Sacred Consolation, and we may suck and be satisfied out of both of them; and milk out and be delighted with the abundant Consolations they afford. I conclude this Use with saying only this further, that to deny the fore-mentioned usefulness of the Old-Testament Doctrine, Promises, Threat∣nings; History and Prophesy, is to <HI>Apocrypha</HI> the <HI>Old</HI> Testament at once; and to confront the <HI>New,</HI> in a thousand instances; and to charge <HI>Non sequi∣tur</HI> upon the Apostolical Argumentation.</P>
<P><HI>U.</HI> 6. To teach us, That by how much more similitude there is between the State &amp; History or Circumstances of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the State and Circumstances of any <HI>Christian people</HI> or Plantation; so much the more apt and easy will <HI>accommodations</HI> be, of Doctrinal, Historical, Promissory, Minato∣ry,
<PB N="45" REF="000850_0057_0FABA2EC6312F548"/>
and Prophetical Passages. This is self evident: for where there is <HI>par ratio,</HI> where the reason is the same, the consequence will be more evident; and the conclusion the more cogent. And if so, I conclude such accommodations will be easy to <HI>New England</HI>; seeing there is such considerable si∣militude and agreement in the circumstances of both. Some of which circumstances and instances of similitude, I shall modestly propound, in hope that they will be as candidly taken, as they are ho∣nestly intended.</P>
<P N="1">1. The first Planters of the Israelitish Vineyard, or the first Plants therein, were <HI>a noble Vine, a right Seed.</HI> Jer. 2.21. The twelve <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> were all Godly, and God led them like a flock by the hand of <HI>Moses</HI> und <HI>Aaron. Israel</HI> was Holiness to the Lord. So the first Undertakers, Planters; the Foundation men of <HI>New-England</HI> were <HI>Holiness to the Lord</HI>; though not <HI>universally,</HI> yet <HI>generally</HI> so; This Land was planted with <HI>choice Vines</HI>; Men E∣minent in Piety, and Vertue; that Served God and their Generation, according to the Will of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. The great End for which Israel went into the Wilderness, and the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> was that they might Worship God according to his own <HI>Institution</HI> with more <HI>purity,</HI> and less <HI>peril,</HI> than they could do in the Countrey where they were. Exod. 8.1. <HI>Let my people go that they may Serve me. Exod.</HI> 8.27. <HI>We will go three days Journey into the Wilder∣ness,
<PB N="46" REF="000850_0058_0FABA2ECC477A958"/>
and Sacrifice to the Lord our God, as He shall command us.</HI> The first Text sheweth they went out for the <HI>Worship</HI> of God, the second shews it was for <HI>purity</HI> of Worship, according to Gods In∣stitution. See <HI>v.</HI> 26. of the same Chapter, and you will see it also to be, that they might so Worship God with more <HI>liberty</HI> and <HI>safety</HI> than where they were. For <HI>Pharaoh</HI> would have <HI>let them Sacrifice to their God in the Land:</HI> but <HI>Moses</HI> said, <HI>It is not meet so to do,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Will they not Stone us?</HI> So then, that they might worship God purely, without giv∣ing offence to others, or endangering themselves; they were willing to go further a field. Even so was the Design of our Predecessors in coming more than three days Journey, <HI>viz.</HI> three thousand miles into this Wilderness, that they might Serve God with pure Worship according to his own Instituti∣on, without offence to others; and with more li∣berty and safety to themselves, than at that time could be had in their own Countrey. The World knows, that our Predecessors did not leave their Native Soil, that <HI>dulce solum Patriam,</HI> for better Ac∣commodations in worldly respects; they did not come into the <HI>Wilderness</HI> for <HI>Worldliness</HI>; but for <HI>Godliness</HI> sake: and that the first Rulers &amp; Teach∣ers, and Churches had the Glory of God, and the liberty and purity of his Worship in their Eye. And their Memory will be precious in Ages to come, notwithstanding their Ashes have been pol∣luted, and that with an unusual degree of Impu∣dence
<PB N="47" REF="000850_0059_0FABA2ED5D73F678"/>
and falshood, by the <HI>Rabshakeh</HI> Raileries &amp; Lyes of some nameless and shameless Hereticks.</P>
<P N="3">3. As the <HI>Israelites</HI> underwent many hazards &amp; hardships in that Enterprize, and had special as∣sistance, preservation, provision and protection from the good Providence of God, that was very peculiar about them for good: So did the first Comers into <HI>New-England</HI> run many great risks, and grapple with many difficulties; both of Sea and Land (too many to enumerate) in all which, the good Providence of God was very circumspect about them, in sending suitable and seasonable suc∣cours and supplies. <HI>They cried to the Lord in their troubles, and he saved them out of their distresses</HI>; as the brief Histories of <HI>New-Englands</HI> Affairs show.</P>
<P N="4">4. As God made room for the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Vine, and caused it to take root, and spread and flourish, <HI>so that its boughs went to the Sea, and its branches by the rivers, its Shade covered hills.</HI> Whilst Religion and Righteousness flourisht among them, they were both numerous and prosperous. And so it was in <HI>New England</HI> in a good degree, God blessed them and caused them to multiply greatly. No Out-go∣ing of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, for the time, can com∣pare with it.</P>
<P N="5">5. As there grew declension and degeneration among that people, notwithstanding all God had done for them, and notwithstanding all done for maintaining and transmitting pure Religion to succeeding Generations: so hath it befallen <HI>New-England.</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="000850_0060_0FABA2EE1C37C528"/>
We may with grief and shame read over and meditate upon some Texts spoke of <HI>Is∣rael.</HI> as Hos. 4.7. <HI>as they were increased so they sin∣ned.</HI> so Josh. 2.7. <HI>The people Served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and the Elders that out lived Joshua,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>there arose another generation after them▪ which knew not the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. As they chang'd their ways from Good to Evil, and walkt contrary to God; so God chang'd his ways, from ways of Mercy, to ways of Afflict∣ion; and walkt contrary to them. And as was threatned, <HI>did them evil after that he had done them good.</HI> So hath it also been with us. As for our Degeneracy, it is too <HI>palpable</HI> to be denied; and too <HI>gross</HI> to be excused. It calls for <HI>Lamentation, Humiliation,</HI> and <HI>Reformation,</HI> rather than proof and demonstration; though that also be needful enough in order to the former. And the Servants of God have in this place, as well as in others, offered conviction of that, to which I refer you. As to Gods change of his Dispensations towards his peo∣ple, from a way of Mercy, to a way of sore Af∣fliction and Judgment, he is a very great stranger to the affairs of <HI>New England,</HI> or one that considers not the Operations of Gods Hand, that knoweth not this. <HI>Who knoweth not that our Fields which use to smell as the Fields which the Lord hath blessed, have of a long time been blasted, that a Fruitful Land hath been turned into Barrenness.</HI> Instead of <HI>Plenty,</HI> we have had <HI>Scarcity</HI>; instead of <HI>Health, Sickness;</HI> in∣stead
<PB N="49" REF="000850_0061_0FABA2EEF6B09470"/>
of <HI>Peace, War</HI>: and have been thereby di∣minished, impoverished, and brought low. Instead of <HI>remarkable divine favour, direction and protection,</HI> we have had such trouble, <HI>from Heaven and Hell; from Earth and Sea:</HI> and such <HI>desertions, frustration</HI> and <HI>rebukes</HI> from God in things of <HI>greatest impor∣tance</HI>; that who shall consider well of these things, will with grief and shame say, <HI>The countenance of our God and Father hath not been towards us as former∣ly.</HI> Might not much of this have been prevented, if we had considered what was like to follow up∣on the degeneration of Gods Covenant-people: if we had considered, that it must needs be after this sort; if God should deal with us, as of old he was wont to deal with his Covenant people in like cases; as it was most <HI>likely</HI> he would; <HI>so likely,</HI> that we had no ground to think it should be other wise. It is an awful saying of Dr. <HI>Goodwin.</HI>
<Q><HI>As you look for Storms in Autumn, and Frosts</HI> in Win∣ter, so expect Judgments, where the Gospel hath been Preached; for the quarrel of the Covenant must be avenged.</Q></P>
<P N="7">7. We know how that People dealt with God for many Generations, and how God dealt with them, and what things came to at last: for their <HI>Apostacy,</HI> for their <HI>Idolatry</HI> against the <HI>first and second Commandment,</HI> their <HI>impiety, prophaness, iniquity, im∣penitency▪ and incorrigibleness</HI> and <HI>unbelief.</HI> They were <HI>broke off, Unchurched, Unpeopled,</HI> and seemingly made <HI>irreversibly miserable:</HI> But we know only
<PB N="50" REF="000850_0062_0FABA2EF9C9590E0"/>
how we have dealt with God, and how God hath dealt with us, to this present time, and know not how we shall deal with God, or how God will deal with us for the future. Secret things belong to God. Certainly we have cause to fear, and tremble, lest in the issue, our line should run pa∣ralel with theirs also; seeing there hath been such agreement in the premisses. And this brings in sight a <HI>two-fold danger,</HI> which I would not mention without fear and trembling; and hope that all good men will joyn with me in praying to the most Merciful God that we may escape them both, and that the Warning now following may be one means of it.</P>
<P><HI>U.</HI> 7. Of <HI>Premonition</HI> &amp; forewarning to the Peo∣ple of <HI>New England,</HI> of two Eminent Dangers they are in.</P>
<P N="1">1. Of being <HI>more sinful</HI> yet. As sinful as <HI>New-England</HI> hath been, or yet is (which is very sinful) yet there is great danger lest <HI>New-England</HI> should yet be much more sinful than ever it was, or yet is.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of being <HI>much more miserable</HI> then ever yet they were, or yet are.</P>
<P>The first Danger demonstrated.</P>
<P N="1">1. Israel, Gods Professing and Covenant People grew from bad to worse; and notwithstanding all warnings and methods used to stop their <HI>defection,</HI> yet they were <HI>bent to backsliding,</HI> till the <HI>holy People,</HI> and <HI>righteous Nation,</HI> became <HI>a Sinful Nation, a Peo∣ple laden with iniquity.</HI> They went away backward
<PB N="51" REF="000850_0063_0FABA2F221C91BE0"/>
they revolted more and more, there was no stop∣ping of them, or reclaiming of them; Their Re∣formations were partial; and at best, but of Short continuance; they quickly returned to folly and did <HI>worse than their fathers.</HI> We have reason to fear by their Example, least it should be so with us also; for we, as well as they, have principles of revolt connatural to us. The Apostle mentioning of their sin and folly, saith, <HI>Let him that thinketh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e standeth, take heed lest he fall</HI>: how much more may we that are sensibly falling already, take heed lest we fall utterly; and take it kindly, that we are earned, before <HI>the things that concern our peace are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id from our eyes.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Successless attempts for Reformation, are more than <HI>presages</HI> of worse declensions: for that obstinacy that renders such attempts successless, sheweth that they are very far gone already, and also merits more divine desertions and derelictions; and the more persons are left of God, the <HI>easier a prey</HI> they are to every Temptation. Although it may be all hath not been done by Magistrates, Ministers, Churches and Synods, that should have been done, to promote Reformation, and Stopping the progress of Impiety and Iniquity: yet one that did not know what hath been done by Courts, Synods, Ministers and Churches, in a publick way, (besides all private Prayers, Tears, Counsel, and Reproof) would not think one half hath been done, that hath; so little fruit of it appears. Nor
<PB N="52" REF="000850_0064_0FABA2F2E9771CC0"/>
is it easy to do so much again: although the event show, much more is needful to be done.</P>
<P N="3">3. Notwithstanding all the Judgments of God that have come upon us for our sins, yet we are un∣reformed. Irreligion and prophane neglects of the Worship of God; Vain and vile Swearing, &amp; prophaning the Name of God, and his Sabbaths; Disobedience to Parents, and family disorder<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Violence, unrighteousness, sensuality, pride, con∣tention, coveteousness, and all manner of carnality and carnal security, rather increase than decrease. There is the less hopes of <HI>growing better,</HI> the more fears of <HI>growing worse,</HI> when <HI>mens</HI> endeavours for Reformation are fruitless: but least of all is the hope of growing better, and most of all the fear of growing worse, when Divine Endeavours <HI>seem frustrate</HI> that aim'd at our Reformation, and take not that effect that might be expected. Isa. 26.9. <HI>When thy Judgments are abroad in the Earth, the In∣habitants of the World will learn Righteousness</HI>; That is it may most rationally and justly be so expected, and how much more may it be expected of those places on which such Judgments fall: But when after various sore Judgments, God may say, <HI>I have smitten you so, and so, yet have you not returned to me,</HI> as Jer. 2 30. <HI>in vain have I smitten your Children, they have received no correction</HI>; that is, are never the better, &amp; as Isa. 9.13. <HI>The people turneth not unto him that smiteth them</HI>; and as Isa. 1.5. <HI>Why should ye be smitten any more, ye will revolt more and more</HI>; if
<PB N="53" REF="000850_0065_0FABA2F39F03E548"/>
things be thus with us, (Oh! that they were not so with us) are we not in great danger of being more sinful yet.</P>
<P N="4">4. When great and good men die thick and fast, it portends declension. Little doth this ingrateful world know, how much of the Religion, Equity, Peace &amp; Order of a Place, is under God, owing to the Piety, Zeal, Prudence, Activity &amp; Fidelity of a few men, that God raises up &amp; brings into Office in Church and Common wealth, and spirits for his Service; however let them guess at it by the following texts, Deut. 31.16. <HI>The Lord said to Mo∣ses, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, and this people shall rise up and go a whoring after the gods of the Strangers of the land.</HI> And <HI>Moses</HI> saith v. 21. <HI>While I am a∣live with you this day, you have been rebellious against the Lord: how much more after my death,</HI> Judg. 2.7. <HI>The people served the Lord all the days of Joshua.</HI> 2 Chron. 24.2. <HI>Joash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, all the days of Jehojadah the priest▪</HI> v. 17, 18. <HI>Now after the death of Jehojadah</HI> &amp;c. <HI>they left the Lord God of their fathers.</HI> I have no design for <HI>Funeral Sermons</HI> on any in particular, but have with <HI>Sorrow</HI> observed <HI>such deaths of Magistrates, Mi∣nisters, and Military Commanders, and so many of them,</HI> that I am afraid of the <HI>Omen.</HI> For <HI>such deaths</HI> are to a people, as <HI>Micaiah</HI> to <HI>Ahab; they never prophesie good</HI>: but either <HI>great declension,</HI> or <HI>great judgment, or both.</HI> Religion hath <HI>one the less friend</HI> on earth, for every godly man that dyeth: and sin

hath <HI>one the less enemy.</HI> And the <HI>Example, Prayers</HI> &amp; <HI>Tears</HI> of many plain Christians, are like to be more <HI>wanted,</HI> then they are <HI>lamented. Our friend Laza∣rus sleepeth,</HI> saith Christ, and <HI>wept at his grave.</HI> Godly men <HI>must die</HI> as well as others, and if their Children and Successors made good their Leaders ground, it were not so Ominous: But alas! it hath been <HI>often otherwise</HI> in <HI>New England.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The lubricity, sickleness, and unsteadyness of men in the true Religion, in which they have been Educated (not to say born, as well as brought up) it is a woful sign of declension; when the Children of the Church, <HI>are like Children tost to and fro with every wind of doctrine</HI>: Men run away with a per∣verse interpretation of that of the Apostle, 1 Thes. 5.21. <HI>Prove all things</HI>: forgetting the very next words, <HI>hold fast that which is good.</HI> Alas! men are more fixt and steady in a false Religion: <HI>hath a Nation changed their gods which yet are no Gods, but my people hath changed their glory</HI> &amp;c. Jer. 5.11.

for it, think to justify themselves by that of the Apostle, <HI>Prove all things,</HI> as if that would justify their running a gadding, and a madding after such Seducers as pretend to divine inspiration, immedi∣ate revelation, infallible guidance by the holy Spi∣rit; and yet <HI>deny the holy Scriptures to be the word of God,</HI> and <HI>touchstone of truth</HI>; and deny the Or∣dinances of <HI>Baptism,</HI> and the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> and all <HI>Instituted worship.</HI> Truly Sirs, as for them that have lived long under the Preaching of the Gospel, and can't see that such doctrine needs not much trying, whether it be sound or no: will be found to have <HI>their Religion</HI> to choose, and that they have <HI>unsound hearts,</HI> as well as <HI>itching ears.</HI> They that have long had the offer of Truth, and yet let it go; will hold last Error. They that were so scrupulous about <HI>CHRIST</HI> who came in his <HI>Fathers Name,</HI> and con∣firmed his doctrine by <HI>Miracles,</HI> did as Christ fore∣told, <HI>believe on one that came in his own name.</HI> De∣clension in Doctrine and Worship, will bring on declension in Manners. They that are not <HI>sound in the faith, will not long be sound in Gods Statutes!</HI> they that make Shipwrack of <HI>Faith,</HI> will make Shipwrack of a <HI>Good Conscience</HI> also.</P>
<P N="6">6. The extream Difficulty of recovering from declension, renders it very hazardous, whether we shall not yet be more Sinful. If there were no Devil to tempt, nor no evil Example among men, nor any temptation from a frowning or flattering World (which is all far otherwise) yet the inbred
<PB N="56" REF="000850_0068_0FABA2FA56BF3E00"/>
corruption of mens hearts, that are deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, is enough to undoe all. <HI>This people,</HI> saith Jeremiah, <HI>hath a re∣volting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.</HI> Jer. 5.23. Such a deceitful, revolting, rebelli∣ous heart can shift off all <HI>Conviction,</HI> and bear up against all <HI>reproof. Infidelity</HI> can despise and disre∣ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d all <HI>Promises</HI> and <HI>Threatning; Security can eat and drink, build and plant, till the flood come and carry all away</HI>; Prophaneness can <HI>mock at all this, and more,</HI> till there be <HI>no remedy. Self-love</HI> can blind mens eyes, in what concerns themselves, so as they shall not be able to see faults in <HI>themselves</HI>; though they be very quick sighted in seeing faults in <HI>others,</HI> Reformation is the most <HI>necessary,</HI> but the most <HI>difficult</HI> thing in the World, because the Enemy of it is not only in a mans <HI>own house,</HI> but in a mans <HI>own heart.</HI> To cure a long contracted <HI>Cachexia,</HI> or ill habit of body; to uphold a <HI>tottering Empire,</HI> and to <HI>reform a declining People,</HI> are three very dif∣ficult things: but the last of them is the hardest of them all. These six foregoing particulars, may serve to show that the people of <HI>New-England</HI> are in great danger of being yet <HI>more Sinful,</HI> which is a very humbling and awful consideration. Who can seriously reflect upon it, and not say as they, Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. 22.17. <HI>Is the Iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed to this days</HI>? The more the Danger is; the more need our care, fear, prayer &amp; endeavour be; lest we add to he heap of <HI>New Englands</HI> Transgression.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="000850_0069_0FABA2FAE2E814B8"/>Secondly, <HI>New England</HI> is in <HI>danger of being much more Miserable</HI> than ever yet they were, or yet are.</P>
<P>The fore mentioned danger being found real, and impending, this cannot be otherwise. It un∣avoidably follows from the premisses: for if it be like to fare with <HI>New England</HI> as to <HI>Happiness</HI> or <HI>Misery</HI>: according as it goeth with them as to <HI>Ho∣liness</HI> and <HI>Righteousness,</HI> as hath been proved: and that <HI>New England</HI> is already very Sinful and in danger of being much more <HI>Sinful,</HI> there must needs be the like danger of being more <HI>Miserable.</HI> God threatned Israel three times in one Chapter, that if after they had Sinned against him, and thereby brought upon themselves some direful Effects of his displeasure, they did not humble themselves, return and reform, <HI>He would punish them yet seven times more for their sin</HI>; which according∣ly came at last to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss. God did bear &amp; for-bear, time after time, and <HI>many a time forgave them</HI> upon their repentance, such as it was, so as not to con∣sume them; though at several times he sorely afflict∣ed them for their sin: Yet forasmuch they <HI>revolted more and more</HI> after their respits from their trouble: at length they found the threatning executed: and so may we, if we don't take warning. Before I leave these two last heads, I will reflect a little on the sayings of some, that (were they true) would render the fore mentioned Warnings needless and useless.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some make as if <HI>New-England</HI> were already
<PB N="58" REF="000850_0070_0FABA2FBACEDFBD0"/>
as sinful, as sinful can be; as bad, as bad can be. To which I reply, I have no design to speak di∣minutively of the Sins of the Countrey; I do ac∣knowledge with grief, and shame, that they have been, and are very horrible; yet I think such Sayings are not justifyable in any. Some well-meaning holy men, being of dark melancholly Spirits, and little acquainted with the advances that Atheism, Idolatry, Superstition, Prophaneness, Ini∣quity and Sensuality have made in other professing parts of the World; are apt to <HI>think so,</HI> and in their indignation against sin &amp; sinners to <HI>say so.</HI> But the truth is, Though we have cause to abhor our selves for being so bad as we are; and to meditate all ways possible to grow better; yet it cannot with truth be asserted, that as yet we are as bad as bad can be; for there is real danger of growing worse. There are other designing persons, that are no great friends to holiness and righteousness, that are of a vulture Spirit, that fly hastily over all the fair meadows and fields without eying of them; that they may pitch and prey upon some Carrion. These find nothing but faults in the <HI>Government, Churches, Ministers,</HI> and <HI>Good people</HI> of all ranks: &amp; Sport themselves with the falls of here and there an Eminent Professor; or the infirmities, &amp; real, or supposed mistakes of men much better than themselves; <HI>These fools make a mock of sin</HI>; and it serves their occasion to blaspheme all the Work of God in the Wilderness; and traduce for Hypo∣crites, all those, that their evil example can't make
<PB N="59" REF="000850_0071_0FABA2FE622E1388"/>
loose or prophane. All I shall say to this latter sort is. That I have no design to justify our selves; Shame, and blushing, and confusion of face belong∣eth to us: for we are sinners. Yet if a compara∣tive goodness would serve our turn (as it will not) we might possibly pass in this degenerate Age. We acknowledge we are very bad; but yet not so bad; but we are afraid of being worse.</P>
<P N="2">2. Others make &amp; speak as if we were as mise∣rable already, as miserable we could be. To which I reply, I have no design to speak diminitively of the <HI>Judgments of God.</HI> I acknowledge they have been very terrible. <HI>At this also my heart trembleth:</HI> yet I think we ought not so to pore upon the <HI>Judg∣ments</HI> of God, as to forget the <HI>Mercies</HI> of God; for <HI>in Judgment God hath remembred Mercy.</HI> I am sure such Speeches <HI>forget Thanksgiving.</HI> Unhum∣bled, Unthankful and peevish men, think to re∣ceive <HI>only good from the hand of God: and not evil</HI>: and under a merciful, moderate Affliction, say, it can't be worse But such ought to know that the <HI>holy and jealous God</HI> hath <HI>more,</HI> and <HI>more terrible</HI> mi∣series &amp; mischiefs to heap; and arrows to spend upon an <HI>Unreformable Covenant-people,</HI> than ever yet, have come upon <HI>New<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>England.</HI> The Example of the <HI>Jews</HI> is a dreadful instance of it. We ought to justify God; yea to praise him that hath punisht less than our Iniquities deserve; and to mourn under our afflictions as they are evidences and effects of Di∣vine Displeasure; and to mourn for our Sins, and
<PB N="60" REF="000850_0072_0FABA2FECEE30518" MS="y"/>
beg the pardon of them for the sake of Christ Jesus, and to <HI>reform</HI> our doings; and not murmur at the Judgments of God. And all this to prevent an <HI>experimental Conviction,</HI> that there was real danger of being <HI>more</HI> miserable.</P>
<P><HI>U.</HI> 8. To <HI>Encourage</HI> all good people to hope and pray for the Restaurations, Reformations, and Divine Benedictions promised to Jews, or Christi∣ans; or prophesied to come to them in the latter days; and that <HI>we</HI> in <HI>New<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>England</HI> may through the Grace of God, have a share in the good things spoken of, that are to be fulfilled in the latter days. The proof of the Third Doctrine is pat to this purpose. If God can do such thing, may do such things, hath done such things already, and will do such things again for his Ancient People the <HI>Jews</HI>; and there be prophesies and promises, that God will do such things; not only for the Jews, but for Christian places that are in ruines, o∣ver-run with sin &amp; misery. Why should we not hope and pray for the accomplishment of them? Besides the fore mentioned Reasons, I shall offer to consideration, three particulars more, which may animate faith &amp; prayer, &amp; remove impediments &amp; objections.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Reformation is prophesied of, as well as the Restauration and Benediction.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Reformation is promised, as well as the Restauration and Benediction.</P>
<P N="3">3. That it is not absolutely necessary, that the Reformation precede the Restauration.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="61" REF="000850_0073_0FABA2FF64D8A1E8"/>1. The Reformation is prophesied of as well as the Restauration, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now prophesie relates to what is <HI>future,</HI> and properly speaks of <HI>Event,</HI> not <HI>Duty.</HI> If it speaks of <HI>Duty,</HI> yet it speaks of it un∣der the notion of <HI>Event.</HI> Consequently, if the Prophesie foretells Reformation, than which no∣thing is more duty; yet it speaketh of it under the notion of what shall certainly come to pass. We must not therefore be discouraged from pray∣ing for it, because we yet see not the Desolate Countreys inhabited as formerly, and see not Re∣ligion reviving and thriving in them as formerly. Were these things come to pass, the prophesie were already fulfilled. But we must believe it fu∣ture, because the Holy Ghost by the mouth of the Prophets hath foretold it. Perhaps some could easily believe the Restauration, if they could see the Reformation; but both must be believed to be future; though neither as yet be come to pass: because both are foretold.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Reformation is also promised. Many speak as if only the Restauration and Benediction were promised; and look upon Reformation as the condition of the Promise. And because they see not the condition fulfilled; cannot believe the Restaurations &amp; Blessings. When the truth is, the promise that is contained in Prophesy, <HI>as such,</HI> is <HI>abso∣lute</HI> &amp; not <HI>conditional</HI>: When promises are annexed as Sanctions to the Laws of Christ, they belong to the <HI>preceptive will of God,</HI> and so are considered as
<PB N="62" REF="000850_0074_0FABA3004F736220"/>
<HI>Conditions.</HI> But when Promises are infolded in Prophesies, they belong to <HI>Gods will of Purpose</HI>; &amp; therefore <HI>must come to pass.</HI> For though Gods <HI>Commands</HI> are broken; yet his <HI>Counsels</HI> are not; they stand for ever, and the Thoughts of his heart to all generations. All such promises therefore ought to be considered, as <HI>absolute</HI>; and conse∣quently the <HI>Reformations will certainly come.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It is not absolutely necessary that the Refor∣mation precede the Restauration, or that the Re∣formation be sensibly advanced before God begin to plead the cause of his people against their Ene∣mies, and begin their Restauration: I readily ac∣knowledge that in point of Duty, Reformation ought to precede, and all the Religion justice and reason in the world oblige those that have made defection from <HI>God,</HI> and his pure ways; and are under dreadful effects of his displeasure; <HI>should be speedy and thorough</HI> in their Repentance and Re∣formation. But so desperataly wicked is fallen man, that if God should not <HI>begin</HI> with man, man would never <HI>begin</HI> with Him, <HI>Men are dead in tres∣passes and sins,</HI> and so <HI>cannot</HI>; or so habituated and inclined to evil, they <HI>will not</HI> return to God, till God is before hand with them. If God bring on Reformation upon the world that lieth in wicked∣ness; <HI>he is found of those that seek him not</HI>; and if upon a deeply degenerate people, <HI>he stretcheth forth his hands to a gainsaying and rebellious people.</HI> And the Grace of God must be exerted in a <HI>victorious</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="000850_0075_0FABA300DBDA4790"/>
and <HI>irresistible</HI> way, before Reformation can: ad∣vance, either in the <HI>Church</HI> or <HI>World.</HI> Seeing then both Restauration and Reformation depend upon the good pleasure of God, it is in vain for us to determine which <HI>shall</HI> precede; though we know in point of mans <HI>duty,</HI> which <HI>should</HI> be first: That which we affirm is, that we ought not to be dis∣couraged in praying for these Restaurations, or believing they shall come to pass, till we see Re∣formation in good forwardness; but to hope and pray for the accomplishment of all prophesied to be done in a way of <HI>Soveraign grace</HI> for the <HI>Church</HI> or <HI>World</HI> in the latter days. If the Restaurations depended on the <HI>Antecedency</HI> of Reformation, and Reformation depended upon mans <HI>free will,</HI> it would be long enough before either would come to pass. But God having foretold &amp; promised both, our dependence ought to be on his <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Power.</HI> If <HI>God can make Children to Abraham of the Stones of the Street,</HI> and make a Church to him∣self out of the <HI>forlorn Gentiles.</HI> When the <HI>boughs of the natural Olive were broke off,</HI> God could <HI>graft in Gentiles, wild Olives</HI> into the <HI>same, stock,</HI> &amp; therefore cannot be at a loss <HI>to graft in the natural branch a∣gain.</HI> Isa. 44.2, 3, 4, 5. <HI>Fear not Jacob, for I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground, I will pour my Spirit on thy seed &amp; my blessing on thine offspring.</HI> The ruinous circumstances of <HI>Jews</HI> and many <HI>Gentile places</HI> are such, as to <HI>Sin</HI> &amp; <HI>Misery,</HI> that there is little hope; either of Restau∣ration
<PB N="64" REF="000850_0076_0FABA303E4DF6848"/>
or Reformation; were it not for the <HI>Pro∣phesy</HI> and the <HI>Promise.</HI> But because of the <HI>Prophesie</HI> and <HI>Promise,</HI> we must <HI>against hope believe in hope,</HI> and though they and their circumstances promise <HI>little</HI>▪ yet God in his word hath promised <HI>much.</HI> There∣fore we should <HI>hope for much,</HI> and <HI>pray for much,</HI> though there should be as little sign of <HI>Reformation</HI> as there was of <HI>Rain,</HI> in the days of <HI>Elias,</HI> when it had not Rain'd in 1260 <HI>days</HI>: yet they that can <HI>believe</HI> and <HI>pray like Elias,</HI> will in the word of God hear the <HI>sound of abundance of rain</HI>; they will <HI>look out seven times,</HI> and pray, and pray again; though there should not appear so much as <HI>a Cloud as big as a mans hand:</HI> believing on and praying to the Lord, till <HI>he send Rain on the earth, till he come &amp; rain down righteousness</HI> on <HI>Asia, Africa, Europe</HI> and <HI>Ame∣rica</HI>; and the Elect come from all parts, and Quar∣ters of the World; from <HI>East, West, North</HI> &amp; <HI>South,</HI> and <HI>Sit down in the Kingdom of God.</HI> He that hath promised these things, causeth <HI>His Sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and his rain to fall on the just &amp; on the unjust,</HI> in a way of <HI>common</HI> bounty and good∣ness; and he doth no less towards the Elect in a way of <HI>special</HI> Grace. And when the time of Re∣formation is come, he will cause the <HI>Sun of Righte∣ousness</HI> to shine upon the evil and upon the good, and the <HI>Rain of Righteousness</HI> to fall upon the just &amp; upon die unjust; and then <HI>bad</HI> men will become <HI>good</HI>; and good men will become <HI>better:</HI> and Re∣stauration and Reformation will struggle like twins

in the Womb, which shall be born first; <HI>a Nation shall be born at once, and the earth shall bring forth in one day.</HI> Isa. 66.8. And <HI>deliverance, and holiness shall be on mount Sion</HI> together. <HI>Obad.</HI> 17. We may confide in this, That all prophesies and absolute promises shall come to pass in that <HI>time, order</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> that God hath <HI>ordained.</HI> And the promised <HI>Good</HI> is more certainly known; than the <HI>time</HI> and <HI>manner.</HI> It is great Consolation, that Restaurations and Reformations, &amp; Blessings <HI>shall</HI> come. Though we know not the time <HI>just when</HI>; yet there are sig∣nals given whereby the Church of God may know <HI>that their Redemption draws nigh.</HI> And as <HI>Daniel</HI> knew that the Seventy years of the Captivity was out, or nigh out; which made him set to Prayer: So we know that some notable Restaurations and Reformations are nigh; though i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may be we can't tell just how nigh. And I am perswaded, one great reason why good mens faith is so <HI>wavering,</HI> and their prayers so <HI>few,</HI> and no more <HI>fervent</HI>; is because they take it for granted, that Reformation must needs considerably, out-run Restauration. For prevention of which Remissness of faith and prayer; I desire the premisses may be considered; that prophesies, and the promises in them, falling under the will of Gods <HI>purpose,</HI> are all certainly fu∣ture; as certain to be, as if they were already. And it is utterly uncertain, whether the Reforma∣tions will out-run the Restaurations. Consider the Restauration out of <HI>Egypt</HI>; Did the Reformation
<PB N="66" REF="000850_0078_0FABA306DFD35AA8"/>
precede? Did not the Lord say, <HI>Let my people go that they may serve me</HI>? Till some <HI>Pharaohs</HI> of the world are <HI>sunk as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Stone in the Sea</HI>: No considerable Reformation can advance. The Church must get put of the <HI>Wilderness,</HI> as well as out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> before the <HI>Glorious Reformation of it can take place.</HI> Whilst the Church was in <HI>Aegypt, God saw the affliction of his people, and heard their Cry by reason of their Task-masters; and he came down to deliver them. Exod.</HI> 3.7, 8 The whole Story shows there was no considerable Reformation an∣tecedaneous to their Deliverance. So for the Delive∣rance out of the <HI>Babylonish</HI> Captivity; it is evident, by the Books of <HI>Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, Zechariah</HI> and <HI>Malachi,</HI> that their Deliverance out-run their Reformation. And the Restauration of the Jews in the last days, in the times of the Messias, for ought appears to the contrary, is like to be much after the same sort, in a way that can be accounted for only by the Soveraignty of the Grace of God. Mic. 5.7. <HI>The Remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people, as a dew from the Lord, as the Showers upon the Grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the Sons of Men. What though the whole house of Israel say, our bones are dried, our hope is lost, and we are cut off for our part?</HI> yet I know no reason, why Christians may not hope and pray for the <HI>Resurrection of those dry bones.</HI> If God will have them <HI>prophesied over,</HI> and hath <HI>promised to open their graves, and bring them up

purity of their Worship abated, and Schisms, Di∣visions and Sects strangely multiplied, and Luke∣warmness in some, and Prophaneness in others, abo∣minably advanced? Yet we ought to hope and pray that God will <HI>revive his work,</HI> and bring on a <HI>Second Reformation,</HI> which, when it cometh, will carry all before it: and it seemeth as if it would not be long first. <HI>Nebuchadnezzars Image</HI> stand∣eth upon his <HI>last Leggs,</HI> and it seemeth as if both of them had received <HI>a blow from the Stone cut out of the mountain without hands,</HI> that maketh them stagger.

of <HI>America,</HI> I know no reason to conclude this Continent shall not partake of <HI>the Goodness of God in the latter days</HI>; nor why the <HI>Sun of Righte∣ousness</HI> may not go round the Earth, as the Sun in the Firmament doth go round Heaven. No Scrip∣ture asserts the <HI>contrary</HI>: but many seem to favour the <HI>Affirmative.</HI> I suppose that Christ is not called the <HI>Sun</HI> of Righteousness, meerly because of his <HI>Light,</HI> and <HI>Heat,</HI> and <HI>quickening vivifick Influences</HI>: but also because of his <HI>Circuition</HI> or <HI>Circuit</HI> round the World, by the Preaching of the Gospel; and his expanding and extending his saving Virtue to those that <HI>Sit in darkness, and in the Region and sha∣dow of Death.</HI> See and consider <HI>Psal.</HI> 19.4, 5, 6. and compare it with <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.18. Luk. 1.78, 79. <HI>Mal.</HI> 4 2. Methinks men should not be hasty to Repro∣bat a Fourth Part of the World, without Express Order from Heaven. I know not how it came to pass, that Conjectures about <HI>America</HI> have been so various, strange and uncomfortable; as to its Rise, State, and final Destiny. <HI>Burnet</HI> M. D. affirms that the <HI>Americans,</HI> in their Progenitors, came not out of the Ark; that their Progenitors descended nor from <HI>Noah.</HI> And indeed they are beholden to him, that he let them descend from <HI>Adam</HI>; and did not bring them out of the Slime, as he doth <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog.</HI> But it is enough to reply to this, that it is not only <HI>Unscriptural,</HI> but also <HI>Antiscriptu∣ral.</HI> A late Annotator on the Bible (who is other∣wise a very worthy man; but I think, misses it in
<PB N="70" REF="000850_0082_0FABA30C5079AAA8"/>
this) in his Preface to the New Testament, in the separate Edition, alloweth the <HI>Americans</HI> to be de∣scended of <HI>Noah</HI>; but by <HI>Cham</HI>: and thence ga∣thers that they shall not be gathered into the Church. To which I reply (1) That it is wholly begg'd that they are the Progeny of <HI>Cham:</HI> and notable Reasons and Authorities may be produced to the contrary. (2) That if it were certain it were so; yet the Consequence is no way valid: as the Multitude of Churches that have been in <HI>Africa</HI> shew; that were undoubtedly, the Posterity of <HI>Cham.</HI> (3) This opinion is wholly founded, and the stress of it depends upon a doubtful Inter∣pretation of a dark Prophesie, <HI>Gen.</HI> 9.27. <HI>God shall enlarge Japheth</HI>: So our Version reads it. But if <HI>Cham</HI> with his four Sons hath filled all <HI>Africa,</HI> with a considerable part of <HI>Asia</HI>; and possess all <HI>America</HI> besides: he is certainly <HI>enlarged</HI> more than <HI>Japheth</HI> with his Seven Sons; and would vie for Number, with <HI>Shem</HI> &amp; <HI>Japheth</HI> too. If we prefer the mar∣ginal Reading; <HI>God shall Perswade Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem,</HI> this would not gain the point intended: for the not mentioning of <HI>Cham,</HI> doth not necessarily exclude <HI>Cham,</HI> no more than when <HI>Shem</HI> is called the Brother of <HI>Japheth, Cham</HI> is denyed to be the Brother of <HI>Japheth</HI>; or <HI>Shem</HI> denyed to be the Brother of <HI>Cham.</HI> Besides, Interpreters of great Note go other ways. The <HI>Hebrew</HI> Doctors gathered from this Prophesie, that they should speak <HI>Japheth's</HI> Tongue; which in the
<PB N="71" REF="000850_0083_0FABA30DE6AC7F58"/>
Ages following, was <HI>Greek</HI>: and was fulfilled in the Apostles speaking, and writing the Gospel in <HI>Greek. Ainsworth</HI> saith it may imply the grafting of <HI>Ja∣pheth's</HI> Children into the stock of the Church; when <HI>Shem's</HI> Posterity, the <HI>Jews</HI> should be cut off: quoting for this, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.11, 12, 15, 17. As the <HI>Reubenites</HI> are said to dwell in the <HI>Hagarites</HI> tents, after the <HI>Hagarites</HI> were subdued and fallen. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 5.10. Others read the words, <HI>God shall enlarge Japheth, and He,</HI> that is, <HI>God shall dwell in the tents of Shem,</HI> in the sence of <HI>John</HI> 1.14 And so make it a famous Prophesie of the <HI>Incarnation</HI> of the Son of God; his taking Flesh of the seed of <HI>Shem.</HI> Others understand it of God's setting up the <HI>Temple,</HI> and dwelling in it among the <HI>Israelites</HI> descended of <HI>Shem.</HI> Certainly it is not reasonable to draw so hard a Conclusion on such a Text, that ad∣mits of such and so many various Interpretations: Seeing it tends to discourage all Endeavours for the Conversion of the <HI>Indians</HI>; and so may greatly prejudice the Souls of Millions of Men, and hinder the inlargement of the Kingdom of Christ. And indeed it seemeth many ways derogatory to the Glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the <HI>Saviour of the World,</HI> John 4.42. 1 <HI>Joh</HI> 4 14. If the <HI>Angels</HI> may be believed, His Birth was <HI>Joy to All People</HI>; If <HI>the greatest born of Women</HI> may be believed, He taketh away the sin of the World, <HI>John</HI> 1.29. If the <HI>be∣loved-Disciple</HI> may be credited, He made an Atone∣ment, or is the <HI>Propotiation for the sins of the whole

World.</HI> And many other such like Expressions there be, which must certainly, comprehend <HI>Some</HI> of All Nations. And the Redeemed Church ac∣knowledge as much in their Song of Praise, <HI>Rev.</HI> 5.9, 10. Nor can I, possibly, otherwise understand Christ's Commission to his Apostles, and their Suc∣cessors in the Ministry. <HI>Mark</HI> 16.15. <HI>Go ye into All the World, and Preach the Gospel to Every Creature.</HI> Matt. 28.19, 20. <HI>Go ye therefore, and teach All Na∣tions</HI> &amp;c <HI>and lo, I am with you away unto the End of the World</HI>; Which seemeth as plain as words can make it, that whatsoever Nation, or Nations shall be discovered to the End of the World, they are to be <HI>Evangelized,</HI> and <HI>Baptised.</HI> That also of the <HI>Apostle to the Gentiles,</HI> seemeth plain &amp; irrefragable, 1 Tim 2 5, 6. <HI>There is One God, and One Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus: Who gave Himself a Ransom for all, To be testified in due time.</HI> Now although it had not been testifyed at that time to the <HI>Americans,</HI> as it had been to <HI>Asians, Europaeans,</HI> and <HI>Africans</HI>; yet there was a <HI>due time</HI> to come, wherein it should be testifyed to <HI>Ameri∣cans</HI> also. Which, through the Grace of God, is now come to pass. The Bible is made to speak <HI>Indian,</HI> as well as other Languages. And there are not only <HI>Converts</HI>; but <HI>Churches,</HI> and <HI>Preachers of their Own</HI>; which are a <HI>First fruits to Christ</HI>: Which should make us look for a <HI>Harvest,</HI> and to pray the <HI>Lord of the Harvest</HI> to send forth Labourers into <HI>that part</HI> of his Vineyard. God promised to his

Son, <HI>the Heathen for his lot, and the uttermost Ends of the Earth for his Possession</HI>: not excluding <HI>America.</HI> It is a part of Christ's Exaltation Honour, that <HI>at the Name of Jesus things Under the Earth shall bow.</HI> Philip. 2.10. Which although some interpret a∣nother way; yet compared with <HI>Rev.</HI> 5.3, 13. seem∣eth more fairly to be interpreted of the <HI>Americans,</HI> that were <HI>Under the Earth</HI> to the Christians of the Eastern Nations. God gave his Son <HI>for a Witness to the People</HI>: not only to the People of the <HI>Jews,</HI> but of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entiles</HI> also; yea, the most remote of them. That in <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.5. seems to bid fair for the Conversion of the <HI>Americans. Behold, thou shalt call a Nation that thou knowest not; and Nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee.</HI> Compare it with <HI>Psal.</HI> 18.43, 44. <HI>Thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people that I have not known shall serve me. Assoon as they shall hear of me, they shall obey me.</HI> It cannot be, literally, more verified of any, than of the <HI>American</HI> Nations. Christ <HI>as God,</HI> knew all Nations: but, <HI>as Man,</HI> He did not. He, <HI>as Man,</HI> had seen and known <HI>Asians, Europeans,</HI> &amp; <HI>Africans.</HI> This cannot be doubted, if you consider the Con∣course of <HI>Jews</HI> and Proselytes, that was annually at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> at the Feast of Pentecost, <HI>Act.</HI> 2.5, 10, 11. Now, as for the <HI>Americans,</HI> Christ <HI>as Man,</HI> had never seen or known any of them: neither had any <HI>American</HI> ever seen, or known Him. But, ac∣cording to this Text, <HI>He shall call them, though He know not Them, and they shall run to him, although
<PB N="74" REF="000850_0086_0FABA311967709A0"/>
they never knew Him. The Strangers, when they hear of Him, shall submit themselves unto Him</HI>: as is accor∣dingly, in part, already come to pass. I shall finish this Argument with an allusion to some passages in <HI>Luke</HI> 15. What ever any think of <HI>America</HI>; If the great Shepherd have a <HI>lost Sheep</HI> in the <HI>American</HI> Wildernes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; He will go after it till he find it: and the Angels of God will rejoyce at the finding of it, what ever men do. The great Housholder of the World will have every corner of it Swept, before he will loose a <HI>Penny:</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Drachma, <HI>a Roman Penny, in value, in</HI> Eng∣lish <HI>Money, seven pennys half penny.</HI></NOTE> and at the finding of it, expect that his Friends will rejoyce. If the Merciful Father have a <HI>Prodigal Child</HI> gone into a far Country, in esteem <HI>dead</HI> and <HI>lost</HI>: When it shall appear that he is <HI>Penitent, alive,</HI> and <HI>found</HI>; while he is a great way off, his Father will run and meet him, and kiss him. He will call for the <HI>best Robe</HI> for this <HI>naked</HI> American Prodigal; and <HI>Shoes</HI> for this <HI>bare-foot</HI> Son; and the <HI>fatted Calf</HI> to fill his <HI>hungry belly</HI>: and there will be <HI>Musick and Dancing</HI>; what ever the Elder Brother think of it.</P>
<P>Others have <HI>conjectured</HI> that <HI>America</HI> will be the head Quarters of <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog</HI>; and that it will be <HI>Hell</HI> it self. This is worse and worse still! But may be something alleviated by an opposite <HI>Conjecture.</HI> For there are Others that ask why it may not be the <HI>New-Jerusalem,</HI> or a part of it?

and this <HI>New World</HI> that is Under the Eastern Earth, be the <HI>New Heaven,</HI> and <HI>New Earth.</HI> These Opinions are as wide from one another, as Hea∣ven is from Hell. I count it sufficient to set them one against the other; without saying which is widest from the Truth. Only, Who of an <HI>Ame∣rican</HI> (though only so <HI>Natione, non gente</HI>) had not much rather (if it may stand with the Counsel of God) that it should be the <HI>New Jerusalem,</HI> than the <HI>Old Iophet</HI> Known unto God are all his Works from the beginning of the World: And He that made this <HI>New World,</HI> knoweth <HI>why</HI> He made it, and what to do with it; though men do not. It is certain, Antichrist boasted in his <HI>Ame∣rican EYPHKA,</HI> and Conquest, when he began to be routed in <HI>Europe,</HI> by the Reformation. And who can blame him to provide a <HI>New World</HI> a∣gainst he lost his <HI>Old One.</HI> But the Son of GOD followed him at the heels, and took Possession of <HI>America</HI> for Himself, And this Province, so far as I know, is the very <HI>Turf</HI> and <HI>Twig</HI>▪ He took Possession by; as to the Reformation and Con∣version of the <HI>Natives,</HI> and gathering of them into Churches. And I am not without Hope, but that He will hold his Possession; not only to the end of <HI>this</HI> World, but to the end of <HI>the</HI> World: if there be a difference; as there may be for ought I know to the contrary. And if any of the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> should happen to read what hath been spoke concerning <HI>America,</HI> I would commend to their
<PB N="76" REF="000850_0088_0FABA312F632ADF8"/>
Consideration that in Act. 17.24, 26, 27, 30, 31. <HI>God that made the World and all things therein, hath made of One blood all Nations of Men, for to dwell on all the face of the Earth; and hath determined the Times before appointed, and the Bounds of their Habi∣tation</HI> (i. e. in what Age, or Place of the World men shall live) <HI>That they should seek the Lord if haply they might feel after him and find him — the times of this Ignorance God winked at, but now commandeth all men every where to repent. Because he hath appointed a Day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness, by that Man whom he hath or∣dained, whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</HI></P>
<P>Now as for <HI>New England,</HI> if the <HI>First Planters</HI> of it had dream'd that the very Situation or Cli∣mate of this Land had been crime enough to make men <HI>aliens from the Covenants of promise</HI>; they would not have Sold their <HI>Europaean Birthright,</HI> for a mess of <HI>American Pottage.</HI> For ought I can see to the contrary, our <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clensions</HI> are the <HI>worst Omen</HI> and <HI>Objection</HI> against us; and <HI>Reformation</HI> would be the best <HI>Answer</HI> to them: and Hope and Prayer are powerful helps and inducements to it. <HI>Quicken us and we will call upon thy name, Turn us again O Lord God of Hosts, cause thy face to shine, and we shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e saved.</HI> Psal 80.18, 19.

<HI>New-England sin not</HI>; yet if it should so come to pass, that <HI>New England</HI> should yet be <HI>more sinful &amp; more miserable</HI> than now it is (which God prevent <HI>for his Mercys sake, which endureth for ever</HI>) yet there is Scripture ground to hope, that after God had vindicated his Holiness by sore punishments on us, God would again <HI>restore, reform</HI> and <HI>bless New-England</HI>; and have a name, and a praise to himself, in the <HI>Wilderness,</HI> of the <HI>Posterity of his People.</HI> If any should say yet, What is become of the <HI>Asian, African</HI> and <HI>Europaean</HI> Churches that are long since desolated? I would give these two An∣swers (1.) That is become of them, that should make <HI>New-England</HI> fear and tremble: and beware of <HI>Idolatry, Superstition, Prophaneness and Unrighteousness:</HI> and <HI>Remember from whence they are fallen, and do their first works.</HI> We should cry mightily to God, to pardon our sins past; and to reform all amiss, and prevent our farther declen∣sion: <HI>that his Jealousie burn not like fire against us</HI>; as it has done against them. (2.) I would also say, that we ought not to entertain such <HI>desperate conclusions</HI>; as if <HI>all places</HI> that have been Eminent, for the Christian Religion; and are now <HI>degene∣rate,</HI> and in <HI>most ruinous circumstances,</HI> are utterly forsaken of God: We ought as well to think what God will <HI>yet do</HI> for them; as well as what he <HI>has done</HI> against them. I shall not easily be brought to believe, that God has taken his <HI>last leave,</HI> of the fore-mentioned places: I think I
<PB N="78" REF="000850_0090_0FABA31460C7F7C0"/>
have prov'd the contrary already; and that God will again <HI>restore, re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm</HI> and <HI>bless</HI> them. And for the same Reasons I believe, that God will Glorifie his <HI>Mercy</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> as well as his <HI>Justice▪ Jea∣lousie,</HI> and <HI>Severity.

<P>Thus much of the Doctrines in general; Suffer me a word or two more, relating to the occasion of the day, and I'le not abuse your patience any longer.</P>
<P>We have felt the Rebukes of God on our <HI>Liber∣ties,</HI> and <HI>Priviledges,</HI> and <HI>Government</HI>; as well as on other things. <HI>God has broken the Pride or Ex∣cellency of New Englands Power.</HI> Our Liberties and Priviledges, are not just the same that sometime

they have been; although it be better with us still in those respects; than we deserve. And if things are not just as we would have them be; yet they are just as God and the King would have them be; which I hope will quiet the minds of all <HI>good men</HI> and <HI>good Subjects.</HI> And if we shall a∣gain find favour in the sight of God, and the King; it may perhaps be some time or other bet∣ter with us than it is, or ever was. However, it is our Duty and Interest to make the best and most of our present Liberties, and Priviledges. Thanks be to God and the King! our Hous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s &amp; Lands, are our own; without every mans being at the Cost of a Charter; and yet we have the liberty of our Religion, and the free Exercise of it, without subscribing to new articles of Faith, Worship, or Discipline; which is a great favour of God, if we have wisdom and grace <HI>to improve it rightly</HI>; and men do not interpret this liberty perversely; and use it for an Occasion to the flesh; and think they may cast off the Publick Worship, <HI>Prophane the Sabbaths, neglect the Ordinan∣ces</HI>; and think to do what is right in their own eyes, though they confound all <HI>Religion, Peace</HI> and <HI>Order.</HI> If any should so think, and act, I hope they will find themselves mistaken: for the true notion of Liberty of Conscience, <HI>is liberty to lead quiet and peaceable lives, in all godliness and honesty,</HI> without restraint from the Government, or popu∣lar confusion, and disturbance. <HI>In maxima Liber∣tate

And if we so do, the Counsellors will be chosen by the wisest and best amongst us; yea, by our selves in proxy, and consequently we shall be greatly to blame; if we have not Counsellors as able and faithful to promote holiness and righ∣teousness, as any in the Land. <HI>Election</HI> being the work of the day, I will venture to say a word of it.

And although the Governour and Lieutenant Go∣vernour are not chosen by our selves; yet we have the <HI>Consolation</HI> and <HI>Satisfaction</HI> that they are chosen by the best King upon Earth; Who never yet gave us cause to complain in that matter: but to rejoyce in his Royal Wisdom and Goodness and Paternal Care; So making the Apostles direction easy; to <HI>submit to every Ordinance of man for the

If therefore any thing farther <HI>Can</HI> be done in favour of them; for the sake of Religion and good Literature, I beseech, it may be done. Let the <HI>publick Faith</HI> be very Sacred, and the pub∣lick Debts be paid, as well as private ones; Let the Souldiers be duly encouraged, and some way con∣trived to satisfie for the Hazards and hardships that they formerly underwent, or still undergo; that according to <HI>Johns</HI> direction, the Souldiers may <HI>be content with their Wages</HI>; and be more voluntary an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hardy in the prosceution of War against the most barbarous, unjust and cruel of Enemies.

If any thing more <HI>Can</HI> be done for the detecting and bringing to condign punishment Pirates and Sea Robbers, those common Enemies of Mankind, it seems highly needful to be done; that God be not provoked, that the King be not offended, and this Government become not guilty and infamous, and that the Youth of the Country be not insna∣red and drawn away from honest ways of living▪ by those that say, <HI>Come, Let us have one purse; we shall find all precious Substance, and fill our houses with spoil; their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood; for so are the ways of all those that are greedy of gain, which takes away the Lives of the Owners thereof</HI>▪ If any thing more <HI>Can</HI> be done for the Suppressing the beastly Sins of <HI>Sensuality, Drunken∣ness</HI> and <HI>Uncleanness</HI>; and for the retrenching of the <HI>Pride,</HI> and <HI>Luxury,</HI> and <HI>Idleness</HI>; and retreiving the good old fashions of <HI>Modesty, Humility, Sobriety, Frugality</HI> and <HI>Industry</HI> of the Countrey; that better become men and women <HI>professing Holiness</HI>: it is very needful to be done; and would mightily befriend Holiness and Righteous∣ness▪ and we should more readily <HI>Give to God

<P>And now I will turn my speech to the Reverend Ministers and Elders, and humbly propound to them, whether nothing more by them may be done to make this land, <HI>an Habitation of Righteousness, &amp; Mountain of Holiness.</HI> I confess I am one of the Unworthiest of that order, and might I have had my choice, in the sence of my own Unworthiness, had rather have been at this time behind the door than in the desk: Yet I can't forbear saying, to my self, and them, that Ministers of all men should be <HI>Holiness to the Lord</HI>; and not only <HI>Preach,</HI> but <HI>Practice</HI> Holiness and Righteousness; <HI>Just</HI> and <HI>Holy</HI> are among the Characters of a good Minister. <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.8.

And the Remainder of this Sheet may be well employed in giving an Account of it.</HEAD>
<P>IN pursuance of the Orders and Instructions given us by the Honoured Commissioners for the Propagation of the Gospel among the <HI>Indians</HI> in the <HI>American</HI> Plantations in <HI>New-England,</HI> and parts Adjacent; We have given the said <HI>Indians</HI> in their several Plantations in the Province of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> a visit: and find <HI>as followeth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="000850_0102_0FABA16CDA36B950"/>At <HI>Little Compton,</HI> we find two Plantations of <HI>Indians</HI>; who keep two distinct Assemblies for the worship of God, and (according to the best infor∣mation we could have) are constant therein. The first Assembly dwells at <HI>Saconet; Samuel Church</HI> alias <HI>Sohchawahham</HI> has for more than one year past, endeavour'd their Instruction; and is best ca∣pable of any in that place, to perform that Ser∣vice. He has ordinarily forty Auditors, many times more; of these above twenty are Men: Diverse here are well instructed in their Catechisms; and above ten can read the Bible. Here are like∣wise two <HI>Indian</HI> Rulers, <HI>John Tohkukquonnoo</HI> and <HI>Jonathan George:</HI> the first of which is a man very well spoken of.</P>
<P>At <HI>Cokesit</HI> in <HI>Little Compton, Daniel Hinckley</HI> hath taught here four years; twice every Sabbath. Eleven families are his Auditors: Most of the men here can read, and many young ones (of whom we had an instance) can say their Cate∣chisms. Of this Company three persons are in full Communion with the Church settled at <HI>Nukkeh∣kumm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es.</HI> A person call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Aham</HI> is Schoolmaster here, and as we are informed performs his work well. Here are likewise two persons improv'd as Rulers. Preaching here, the two forementioned Teachers at our direction, pray'd very soberly and understandingly: they gave very diligent atten∣dance and were handsomely cloathed in English Apparel.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="000850_0103_0FABA16F55CEEE78"/>At <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> We find two Assemblies of <HI>In∣dians</HI>; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Nukkehkummees, William Simons</HI> (or∣dain'd by <HI>Japhet</HI> of <HI>Marthas Vineyard,</HI> three years since) is their Pastor. In the Church here, are forty Communicants, part dwelling in <HI>Nukkeh∣kummees,</HI> part in <HI>Assameesky, Cokesit, Acushnet</HI> and <HI>Assawanupset.</HI> Here are many that can read well. The Word is Preached here twice every Sabbath; Twenty families, in which one hundred and twen∣ty persons at least, are for the most part constant hearers; almost all their Children can read: <HI>Johanan</HI> hath been their Schoolmaster, but ceases now for want of encouragement. We propose his continuance as a person well fitted for the employ∣ment. <HI>William Simons</HI> informs that here are four persons annually chosen as Rulers. They are well clothed, and gave good attendance whilest we dispensed the Word to them. Their Pastor pray∣ing with good Affection, and Understanding; and is likewise well reported of by the Eng∣lish.</P>
<P>At <HI>Acushnet, John Bryant</HI> their Teacher for five or six years past. Here are fourteen families, unto whom <HI>William Simons</HI> once in a month or∣dinarily comes and Preaches, some of those who belong to the Church at <HI>Nukkehkummees</HI> being here settled: <HI>viz.</HI> five men and ten wo∣men: We find that Scandals are among them re∣flected upon; if any exceed the Rules of Sobriety, they are suspended until repentance is manifested.
<PB N="92" REF="000850_0104_0FABA16FB4920DB8"/>
By the best intelligence we could arrive to from sober English dwellers on the place, we understand they are diligent observers of the Sabbath; they are generally well clothed, diligent labourers: but for want of Schooling, their Children are not so well instructed as at the other places; though they earnestly desire a Remedy.</P>
<P>At Major <HI>Winthrops</HI> Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd, Mr. <HI>John Weeks</HI> an English man, teaches them on the Sabbath. An <HI>Indian</HI> named <HI>Asa</HI> chief Ruler among them, and a person well reported of, teaches them when Mr. <HI>Weeks</HI> cannot attend it. Here are but about nine families, most of which can read well, are diligent in their callings▪ and generally go well in cloathing; three of their Women belonging to the Church whereof <HI>Japher</HI> is Pastor at <HI>Marthas Vine∣yard.</HI> An <HI>Indian</HI> called <HI>Sampson</HI> attends their School every Winter, and hath the Reputation of the most able among them for that Service, taking pains in Catechizing their Children every week. Men, Women and Children are thirty persons in all. Half the <HI>Indian</HI> Inhabitants of this Island have dyed in a few years past. Three families living at <HI>Saconeset</HI> point, do attend to the meeting at Mr. <HI>Winthrop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Island.</P>
<P>At an Island called <HI>Slocums</HI> Island, we hear of seven families (most of which can read) being lately removed thither from the Vineyard and o∣ther places.</P>
<P>We hear of some <HI>Indians</HI> at the furthermost
<PB N="93" REF="000850_0105_0FABA17059A8E8A0"/>
Island formerly called <HI>Sandfords</HI> Island, where there is an <HI>Indian</HI> Teacher.</P>
<P>At <HI>Marthas Vineyard.</HI> viz. At <HI>Chilmark,</HI> alias <HI>Na∣shauekammuck</HI>: Here is an <HI>Indian</HI> Church of which <HI>Japhet</HI> is Pastor: a person of greatest repute for Sobriety and Religion, and diligent in attending his Ministerial Imployment: Unto whom is ad∣joyned <HI>Abel,</HI> as Ruling Elder, who likewise Preaches to a part of the Church: living at too great a distance, ordinarily to attend on <HI>Japhets</HI> Ministry; although they come together to attend Church Administrations. In this place we find two hundred thirty and one persons; threescore and four in full Communion: their Children well instructed, as we find by our Examination of them in their Catechisms.</P>
<P>At <HI>Ohkonkemme,</HI> within the bounds of <HI>Tisbury,</HI> are threescore and twelve persons, unto whom <HI>Steven</HI> and <HI>Daniel,</HI> who are brothers, are Preach∣ers; well reported of for their gifts and qualifica∣tions. Here we spent part of a Sabbath, and were joyful Spectators of their decent Christian carriage: the aforesaid <HI>Daniel</HI> Praying and Preaching not only affectionately but understandingly: Unto whom also we imparted a word of Exhortation in their own Language to their contentment, and declared satisfaction.</P>
<P>At <HI>Sehconckqut</HI> in aforesaid <HI>Chilmark</HI> also, which belongs to the inspection of the aforenamed <HI>Steven</HI> and <HI>Daniel,</HI> are thirty five persons, to whom for
<PB N="94" REF="000850_0106_0FABA1711F7E4950"/>
their greater ease, either the one or the other dispence the word.</P>
<P>At <HI>Gayhead, Abel</HI> and <HI>Elisha</HI> are Preachers to, at least, two hundred and sixty persons; who have at their own charge a Meeting house already framed. We find that the <HI>Indians</HI> here (as also may be affirmed of most of the <HI>Indians</HI> belonging to <HI>Marthas Vineyard, Chaubaqueduck</HI> excepted) are well instructed in reading, and are well cloathed, mostly in decent English Apparel.</P>
<P>At <HI>Edgar Town,</HI> viz. At <HI>Sahuchecontuckquet</HI> are twenty five families, amounting to one hundred thirty &amp; six persons; <HI>Job Prossel</HI> their Minister.</P>
<P>At <HI>Nunnepaog,</HI> are eighty four persons, <HI>Joshua Tackqunnash</HI> their Minister, <HI>Josiah Thomas</HI> their Schoolmaster.</P>
<P>At <HI>Chaubequeduck,</HI> about one hundred thirty and eight persons; <HI>Maumachegin</HI> Preaches to them every Sabbath. <HI>Josiah</HI> is their Schoolmaster, <HI>Joshua,</HI> by birth is their Ruler, or Sachim.</P>
<P>At <HI>Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tuckquet,</HI> we find five Congregations: the Preachers unto which are <HI>Job Ptuckemuck,</HI> who succeeds <HI>John Gibs</HI> deceased▪ <HI>John Asherman,</HI> a person well reputed of; <HI>Quequenap, Netowah</HI> (a man highly esteemed by the English for great Sobriety) <HI>Peter Hayt,</HI> a well carriaged and serious man. Also <HI>Wunnobson</HI> and <HI>Daniel Spotso, Codpoganut</HI> &amp; <HI>Noah</HI> (a person never known to be overtaken with drink, but a zealous Preacher against it.) These are their constant Teachers. Amongst these
<PB N="95" REF="000850_0107_0FABA171DBFACBC8"/>
there are two Churches who have ordain'd Of∣ficers, in each of which are twenty Commu∣nicants at least; in which a commendable dis∣cipline is maintained, as persons of good repu∣tation on the place have given us information. The whole number of Adult persons here amount to about five hundred. Three Schools were wont to be upheld amongst them; though at present none, for want of Primers. A good new Meeting house is building here; the Frame whereof at their desire and charge is already procured by the Worshipful Capt. <HI>Gardner.</HI> Here we Preached to them in their own Language twice in one Assembly, unto which they were generally con∣vened upon the Sabbath day: Three of their principal Preachers were improved by us in prayer, that we might discover something of their abi∣lities; in which we found them good Proficients: the whole attending with diligence and great seeming affection.</P>
<P>At <HI>Sandwich,</HI> here we find two Assemblies of <HI>Indians</HI>; to one whereof Capt. <HI>Thomas Tupper</HI> (an English man) Preaches every Sabbath day: here are likewise <HI>Indian</HI> Preachers whose abilities in prayer we tryed, <HI>viz. Ralph Jones</HI> (a person well reputed of for Sobriety) and <HI>Jacob Hedge.</HI> These are in number three hundred forty and eight persons; Men, Women and Children: they are generally well cloathed. Preaching amongst these in a small Meeting house built
<PB N="96" REF="000850_0108_0FABA173D495C298"/>
for them after the <HI>English</HI> fashion; we expe∣rienced their good Attention and had their thankful acknowledgments. Their <HI>Indian</HI> Rulers here are <HI>William Nummuck, Ralph Jones, Jacob Hedge</HI> and <HI>John Quoy.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Mahshpah,</HI> belonging to <HI>Sandwich,</HI> we found another Assembly of <HI>Indians,</HI> amongst whom the Reverend Mr. <HI>Rowland Cotton</HI> frequently dispenses the Word, unto whose good progress in the <HI>Indian</HI> Language we cannot but subjoyn our attestation, having heard him dispense the Word to them: amongst whom also we left a word of Exhortation. They are generally well cloathed, being in number fifty seven fa∣milies, in which are from ten years old and upward, two hundred sixty and three persons: diverse of whom have the Character of very sober men. The <HI>Indian</HI> Preacher here is <HI>Simon Papmonit,</HI> a person suitably qualifyed as most amongst them, for that work. Their Rulers are <HI>Caleb Papmonit, Caleb Pohkneit, Sancohsin, James Ketah.</HI> Here they want a Schoolmaster.</P>
<P>At <HI>Eastham</HI> and <HI>Harwich, Eastharbor, Billings-gate,</HI> and <HI>Monimoy,</HI> are (as Mr. <HI>Treat</HI> informs us) five hundred persons.</P>
<P>At <HI>Ponanummakut, Thomas Coshaumag,</HI> Preacher and Schoolmaster. Their Rulers are <HI>William Stockman</HI> alias <HI>Quequaquonchet,</HI> and <HI>Lawrence Je∣offryes</HI>: Families here are twenty two: <HI>Moses</HI> also teaches School here.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="000850_0109_0FABA2AFE43107A8"/>At <HI>Eastharbor</HI> and <HI>Billings-gate, Daniel Munshe,</HI> Preacher, <HI>Daniel Samuel</HI> Ruler; here are about twenty houses, in some of which are two fa∣milies.</P>
<P>At <HI>Monimoy,</HI> in which are fourteen houses; <HI>John Cosens,</HI> Preacher and Schoolmaster; their Rulers <HI>John Quossen</HI> and <HI>Menekish.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Sahquatucket</HI> alias <HI>Harwich,</HI> are fourteen families, unto whom <HI>Manasseh</HI> is a Preacher, <HI>Joshua Shauntam</HI> Ruler.</P>
<P>Many amongst these, almost every head of families are persons capable of reading the Scrip∣ture, as we are informed.</P>
<P>At <HI>Plymouth,</HI> viz. at <HI>Kitteaumut</HI> or <HI>Monimoint</HI> ponds, <HI>William Nummuck,</HI> has Preached here sometime, but is removed, and his return ear∣nestly desired. Here are ten families. <HI>Joseph Wanno</HI> and <HI>John</HI> his brother improved by Major <HI>Bradford</HI> to decide smaller cases among them▪ <HI>Esther,</HI> wife of <HI>John Wanno</HI> has been sometime here School-dame, and is willing still to be use∣ful in that way.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Duxbury</HI> Saw-mills, we hear of a few scattering families, to witt, three or four.</P>
<P>A like number at <HI>Mattakesit.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Kehtehticut,</HI> between <HI>Tanton</HI> and <HI>Bridge-water,</HI> are forty two Adult persons, <HI>Charles Ahaz</HI> Preaches to them, and teaches their Children to read.</P>
<P>At <HI>Assawampset</HI> and <HI>Quittacus,</HI> are twelve
<PB N="98" REF="000850_0110_0FABA2B0B109D540"/>
houses, in which are above fourscore persons. <HI>John Hiacoomes</HI> Preacher and constant School∣master (the most eminent for Sobriety of all the <HI>Indians</HI> in those parts.) Also <HI>Jocelyn</HI> Preaches at <HI>Assawampset.</HI> In this Plantation are seven persons belonging to the Church at <HI>Nukkehkum∣mees.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Natick,</HI> we find a small Church consisting of seven Men and three Women: their Pastor (ordained by that Reverend and holy man of God Mr. <HI>JOHN ELIOT,</HI> deceased) is <HI>Daniel Tokkohwompait,</HI> and is a person of good knowledge. Here are fifty nine men and fifty one women, and seventy children under sixteen years of age: their numbers being increased by the Accessions of diverse families formerly belonging to <HI>Hassinnamisco.</HI> We find no School-master here, the want whereof has had a very evil influence into the non proficiency of their children, in those wayes of Education which formerly obtain'd a∣mongst them, there being but one child that can read here.</P>
<P>At <HI>Hassinnamisco,</HI> are five families, unto whom <HI>James Printer,</HI> stands related as a Teacher: many families belonging unto this Plantation (which before the Wars was very flourishing, and had a hopeful Church in it) are removed from thence, some to <HI>Natick,</HI> and some to other places in hopes of greater security.</P>
<P>There are about Ninty two <HI>Indians</HI>; Men,
<PB N="99" REF="000850_0111_0FABA2B15C098938" MS="y"/>
Women, and Children, belonging to <HI>Puncapaog, William Hahaton</HI> teacheth them on the Sabbath days. And the Reverend Mr. <HI>Peter Thacher</HI> gives them a Lecture in their own Language. Their School∣master dyed some years ago; and there is not, another settled in his room.</P>
<P>We have been credibly informed of a great Mortality among the <HI>Indians</HI> within these few years past, whereby some flourishing Plantations of them have been almost depopulated, and in particular the famous and numerous <HI>Indian</HI> Church at the Island of <HI>Chaubaqueduck</HI> is wholly destroyed, but one of them surviving; and other Plantations exceedingly thinned.</P>
