<HEAD>THE CASE OF THE CLERGY of <HI>MARYLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT appears from the Charter of <HI>Maryland,</HI> that the In∣tent of that Grant, was to promote the Interest of the Protestant Religion in that Province:
For in the Pream∣ble it is said, <Q>That the Proprietor was excited by a laudable and pious Zeal, for the Propagation of the Chri∣stian Faith;</Q>
which must be understood of the Faith as professed in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> because the same Char∣ter lays him under an Obligation,
<Q>to cause all Churches, Chappels and Oratories, to be dedicated and consecrated according to the Ecclesiastical Laws of the Kingdom of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But so it happened, that no Attempt was made for esta∣blishing a Protestant Church or Clergy in that Province, un∣til the Government thereof devolved into the Hands of the Crown, upon the happy Revolution under the glorious Reign of his Majesty King <HI>William</HI> III. At which time some Acts of Assembly were proposed and passed, for settling the re∣ligious Worship of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> amongst his Ma∣jesty's Protestant Subjects in that Colony; but by Reason of some Defects, that appeared in the Draught of the said Acts, they were by the royal Authority repealed; and one other immediately prepared and transmitted to the Governour and Assembly, by Direction of his said late Majesty in Council, which after passing the necessary Forms abroad, received the royal Sanction here in the solemn Manner, set forth in the Petition hereto annexed.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="039950_0002_10161FFA1BAD9A10"/>Thus relying on the Favour and Protection of the Crown, which in that Manner so well secured a reasonable Mainte∣nance for the Clergy; many regular Divines by the pious Care of the Bishops of <HI>London</HI> from Time to Time were in∣duced to go over and settle in that Province; not in the least apprehending, it was in the Power of any Governour and Assembly to break through so firm an Establishment without the Concurrence of an equal Authority to that which first gave it a Being; <HI>viz.</HI> the royal Sanction.</P>
<P>Nevertheless so it is, that on the third Day of <HI>October,</HI> 1728, an Act of Assembly was passed in <HI>Maryland,</HI> under the Au∣thority of the present Lord Proprietor's Deputy-Governour, whereby the aforesaid solemn Act for the Establishment of the Clergy, is materially altered, and their future Support and Maintenance not only impair'd one fourth Part▪ but the whole rendered precarious and subject to the fluctuating Hu∣mour of their popular Assemblies from Year to Year; as will be clearly understood by observing the following Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">I. Whereas, by the first Act so carefully drawn up and af∣terwards passed into a Law by the royal Assent, the Clergy were intitled to receive, free of all Charge 40 <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> of Tobacco <HI>per</HI> Poll, on every taxable Person in <HI>Maryland,</HI> in lieu of Tythes; the late Act directs the said 40 <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> of Tobacco <HI>per</HI> Poll to be paid in current Money, at ten Shillings <HI>per</HI> hun∣dred, which is but 7 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> Sterl. or in Tobacco three fourths for the whole, at the Election of the Planter: So that when Tobacco rises in Value, the People will chuse to pay the Clergy at an under-rate in Money, and when the Market falls below ten Shillings <HI>per</HI> hundred, they will pay in To∣bacco three fourths for the whole; whereby in all Events, the Clergy must be great Losers by this Act, and have no manner of Chance with their Fellow-Subjects to share in the proposed Benefits of the Act, be what they will.</P>
<P N="2">II. This Uncertainty of the Species in which the Clergy is to be paid their Subsistence, by this Act, is attended with another most grievous Inconveniency, <HI>viz.</HI> In a Country like <HI>Maryland,</HI> where for want of a sufficient Currency in ready Cash, the People must deal by Barter, and on Credit for their Cloathing and other Necessaries of Life; if a Clergy∣man agrees to purchase any thing of the Merchant for Money, perhaps the People, as has been said, will chuse to pay his
<PB N="3" REF="039950_0003_10162634E04039C0"/>
Stipend in Tobacco, and then the poor Clergy-man must be at the Will of the Merchant, how much Tobacco he will please to accept of, for the Money due to him; and on the other hand, if an Agreement be made with the Merchant for Tobacco, if then the People happen to chuse to pay that Year in Money, the Merchant will still be at Liberty to set his own Price on that Quantity of Tobacco, which by A∣greement was due to him: So that whatever happens, the Clergy <HI>must be certain Losers,</HI> without a Possibility of share∣ing in any Advantage or Improvement that can be made in the Tobacco Trade.</P>
<P N="3">III. The Clergy are most grievously oppress'd by the Time limited in this late Act for collecting and paying their Al∣lowance. For the People have to the tenth of <HI>April</HI> to make their Choice, whether they will pay in Money or Tobacco: and afterwards the Sheriff has to the last of <HI>June</HI> to make up his Accounts with the Clergy; by which Means it will often happen, that a Clergy-man may serve three Years before he can reap the Benefit of his Labour. For until the first Year is ended (which commonly begins in <HI>November</HI>) there is nothing due; and if the Sheriff be allowed to keep their Tobacco till the last of <HI>June</HI> following, the Market will, in all Probability, be over; and the Tobacco lie on their hands until next Year; when if (as it frequently happens) they cannot sell it, it must be shipped home for <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and then it will be another Year, before they can expect any Returns. All which the Clergy conceive to be such Hard∣ships, that neither the present Sett, nor any who under these Circumstances, may be unadvisedly induced to succeed them, can possibly subsist or continue in that Province.</P>
<P>It is further to be observed, that some of the Clergy of <HI>Maryland</HI> petitioned the Honourable Council of that Province against the passing this Act; and the Council having thought fit to enter upon the Back of their Petition, some Reasons for passing it into a Law; it will be necessary for the better Understanding of the whole Matter, to subjoin those Reasons given by the honourable Council in Justification of their Pro∣ceedings, with proper Answers on behalf of the Clergy.</P>
<P N="1">I. The honourable Council are pleased to say, that the In∣come or Provision made for the Clergy is greatly advanced in Quantity, from what it was, when the Act for their Establishment was made.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="4" REF="039950_0004_10162637EFBC2760"/>II. That the Design of the Legislature in passing this sub∣sequent Act, was not to deprive the Clergy of any Advanta∣ges that accrued to them by the former Law: But on the contrary, that their Intention was, by lessening the Quantity of Tobacco hereafter to be made in that Province, to ren∣der three fourths of the Clergy's Allowance equal in value, to the whole of what was formerly levied for their Subsistence.</P>
<P N="3">III. That the Wages allowed to the Members of Council and Assembly, the Lawyers Fees, and all Debts due to and from the Inhabitants, are by this Act subject to the like Deductions, with that imposed on the Clergy.</P>
<P>To the first, it is answered on behalf of the Clergy, That when the forty <HI>per</HI> Poll was settled by the first Act, the Num∣ber of People were then so few, that it did scarce any where amount to a Subsistence; wherefore the same Act gave Li∣berty to the Clergy, to hold two Parishes, with the Consent of the respective Vestries: the Legislature then justly consi∣dering, that one Parish in those Days could not be deemed a Competency. But they did not omit to observe as a further Incouragement to the Clergy, that their Income would cer∣tainly increase with Time; and it has proved so; tho' there are many Parishes that are not yet a Competency: and no sooner does any Parish swell to any considerable Bulk, but it is immediately dismember'd and divided by Act of Assembly.</P>
<P>Besides, since the making the first Law, and contrary to the Intent of it, an additional Duty or Deduction of five <HI>per Cent.</HI> out of the forty <HI>per</HI> Poll, charged for Collection, was put upon the whole Clergy by a <HI>subsequent</HI> Act,
tho' that first Act had provided and directed <Q>that the Sheriff should collect the 40 <HI>per</HI> Poll in the same Manner and by the same Autho∣rity, as he did the Publick and County Levies:</Q> which are paid for by the Country, and given to the several Officers with∣out deducting any Thing for Collection.
So far then has the Interest of the Clergy been from being advanc'd, that by this additional Charge for Collection, it was reduced two <HI>per</HI> Poll; and tho' (as was before said) many Parishes previous to the late Act for deducting one fourth, are not a Com∣petency; there was not one in the whole Province that ex∣ceeded a reasonable Subsistence.</P>
<P>But further; the Increase of People in every Parish increa∣ses likewise the Minister's Labour and Duty, which (it is
<PB N="5" REF="039950_0005_1016263A6969A770"/>
humbly conceived) should in justice increase or add to his Sub∣sistence.</P>
<P>From all which, it is hoped, that it is Evident that the In∣crease of People under the aforesaid Circumstances, is not a good Reason, for deducting a fourth Part of the Clergy's Sub∣sistence.</P>
<P>To the second Reason suggested by the Council, in support of the Act, it is answered in behalf of the Clergy; That sup∣posing this Act had the pretended or designed Effect, <HI>i. e.</HI> by lessening the Quantity of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> to raise it in Value, perhaps to twenty Shillings a Hundred; yet the Clergy can be no Gainers, but great Sufferers, since the People are in that Case by the Act left at liberty to pay the Clergy in current Money at ten Shillings a Hundred. On the other hand, if (as most People think) the Act will not lessen the Quantity, and conse¦quently not raise the Value of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> it cannot be assigned with any colour of Justice, as a good Reason that the Clergy must be paid in <HI>Tobacco, three fourths</HI> for the whole. Such a strange and unhappy Dilemma has this Act put the Clergy under!</P>
<P>But still, supposing this Act should lessen the Quantity of <HI>To¦bacco,</HI> the less Quantity of that, the People are limited to, th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more they will make of other Commodities; which will com¦pensate their Deficiencies in <HI>Tobacco.</HI> And it is humbly con¦ceived, that the lessening only the Quantity of one Commo¦dity, when the People are at liberty of making as much a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they can of all others, to any Share whereof, the Clergy hav<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no legal Pretence, cannot be a good Reason for deducting <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fourth Part of the Clergy's Subsistence.</P>
<P>To the third and last Reason suggested by the Council o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Maryland,</HI> in Support of this Act, it is answered on behalf <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Clergy; That their Circumstances, with respect to world<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Interest or Gain, is vastly different from that of any other Se<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Men in that Province; for all other Persons, of what Im¦ployment soever, are at liberty to pursue Gain, by turnin<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Effects into some Sort of Merchandize or Traffick, b<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Clergy are wholly confined from sharing in any Advantage of that Kind; first, by their Education and Character, an<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> secondly, by the Extensiveness of their Cures, which requi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> continual Application and Industry.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="039950_0006_1016263D42C63098"/>It is probable, that the Lawyers and others who are well ac∣quainted with the Course of Trade and Business, may gain more than they lose by the Act; but the poor and unimprovable Allowance that is given for the Maintenance of the Clergy, puts them on no Equality with other People; their whole De∣pendance being on the Established Maintenance, so that what∣ever is taken from them, does so far deprive them of the Ne∣cessaries of Life.</P>
<P>It is therefore humbly hoped, that when this Act comes to be deliberately considered by the Lords of his Majesty's most Honourable Privy-Council, in their Committee for Plantation-Affairs, they will for the Reasons here offered, be pleased to move his most Excellent Majesty to cause the said Act to be repealed, with such proper and permanent Instructions, to the Governour and Council of the said Province for the time being, as may re-establish the Clergy in their former Rights so graci∣ously conferr'd on them by the Crown, and effectually prevent Incroachments of the like, or any other nature, for the Future.</P>

<HEAD>To the King's Most Excellent Majesty, The Petition of <HI>Jacob Henderson,</HI> Clerk, Rector of <HI>Queen Anne</HI> Parish, in Prince <HI>George</HI>'s County, in <HI>Maryland,</HI> in behalf of the Clergy of the said Province;</HEAD>
<OPENER>Most humbly sheweth,</OPENER>
<P>THAT in the most Auspicious Reign of his late Majesty King <HI>William</HI> the Third, of Blessed Memory, when the particular Government of the Province of <HI>Maryland,</HI> in <HI>North-America,</HI> devolved into the hands of the Crown, there were di∣vers Acts transmitted from thence, relating to the Establishment of Religion, which by reason of several Defects found therein, were at that time repealed.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="039950_0007_1016264057F197C8"/>That his said late Majesty, nevertheless, out of his gre<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Zeal and pious Inclination to promote the Protestant Religio<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> among his Subjects in that distant Part of his Dominions was pleased to give Directions to the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of Trade and Plantations, to prepare <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> new Draught of a Bill to the same purpose, agreeable to th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Toleration allowed in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>That such a Bill drawn up by their Lordships, accordingly was laid before his Majesty, who, upon a Petition of som<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the People called Quakers, in behalf of their Brethren i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Maryland,</HI> was graciously pleased to hear the said Quakers by their Counsel, against the Draught of the said Bill, and also to consider the Reasons which were offered for it.</P>
<P>That on mature Deliberation and due Consideration had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the whole Matter, his Majesty by his Order in Council of th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fifth of <HI>June,</HI> 1701, was pleased to direct that the said Draugh<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should be sent to the Governour of <HI>Maryland,</HI> to be offer'd to the General Assembly there at their next Meeting, as a pro¦per Bill to be passed into a Law of that Province.</P>
<P>That on the 25<SUP>th</SUP> Day of <HI>March,</HI> 1702, the same was passed into an Act of Assembly in <HI>Maryland</HI> accordingly, and after∣wards transmitted to the Lords of Trade and Plantations, who thought fit to lay it before her late Majesty Queen <HI>Anne</HI> for he<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Royal Approbation, and her Majesty was graciously pleased in Council to declare the same to be finally enacted, ratified and confirmed.</P>
<P>That the said Act so advisedly and solemnly passed, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> immediately printed at <HI>London,</HI> for the incouragement of Clergy∣men to go over into that Province; the Parishes there were soon filled, and the Vacancies from time to time continually supplied by the pious Care of the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> ever since.</P>
<P>That the Clergy of <HI>Maryland</HI> thus relying on the Publick Faith of that Province, but more especially on the gracious Favour and Protection of your Sacred Majesty, and your Royal Predecessors, have been induced to make some poor Settlements for the needful Subsistence of their Families, in a Country where the Duty of their sacred Function led them to spend their Lives.</P>
<P>That, notwithstanding these just and reasonable Incourage∣ments, the whole Body of your Majesty's Loyal and Dutiful Clergy in <HI>Maryland,</HI> find themselves at this time most grievously oppressed, by the Tenor of a certain Act of Assembly passed in
<PB N="8" REF="039950_0008_101626428C408D08"/>
that Province, the third Day of <HI>October,</HI> 1728, Intituled, <HI>An Act for Improving the Staple of</HI> Tobacco, whereby a fourth Part of what was granted and established for the Support and Maintenance of the Clergy, by the before recited solemn Act, is cut off, and the remaining three Parts of their Subsistence rendred precarious, by being subject to the fluctuating Hu∣mour of a popular Assembly, from Year to Year, especially in a Country where both the Papists and Dissenters from the Form and Discipline of the Church of <HI>England</HI> have a considerable Influence.</P>
<P>That though the Clergy humbly conceive, they have just cause to believe that no Act in any Colony of <HI>America,</HI> but especially in a Proprietary Government, can operate, so as to repeal or alter any substantial Part of a former Law in the same Province unto which the Crown appears to have been a Party, without your Majesty's Royal Assent; and, although your Dutiful Clergy of <HI>Maryland</HI> are firmly persuaded that your Sacred Majesty cannot be induced to approve of a Law which evidently destroys the former Bounty and pious Intentions of the Crown, towards promoting and establishing the wholesome Doctrine and Worship of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>America:</HI> Yet as these matters seem in this Case to depend on the Ex∣plication of certain Rights contained in the Lord Proprietary of <HI>Maryland</HI>'s Charter, which does not so well become the Clergy under his Lordship's Government, to meddle with, or dispute:</P>
<P>Your Petitioner therefore in behalf of the Clergy aforesaid, does humbly Pray your Most Sacred Majesty, That in your Royal Wisdom and Justice, you will be graciously pleased to order this matter to be examined; whereby, not only your Majesty's Royal Prerogative, but also the just Rights of the whole Body of your Majesty's most Loyal and Obedient Clergy may be ascertain'd and maintain'd.</P>
<P><HI>And your Petitioner, as in Duty bound, will ever Pray.</HI></P>
