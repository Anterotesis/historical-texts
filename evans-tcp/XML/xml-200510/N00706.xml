<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Humble Answer of <HI>Ebenezer Willson,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> High Sheriff of the City and County of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Orange County,</HI> Ʋnto the Contumelious Petition of <HI>Samuell Staats,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THat your Honours Respondant, pursuant unto his Majesties Writ to him directed, did make a true and just Return of the Persons that were truly elected by the Free-holders and Free-men of the said City, according to the Tenor of the said Writ, which is verified by the Electors of the said Persons, by an Indenture under the Hands and Seals of the said Electors or Chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, according as the Statutes of the 8th and 10th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th do direct.</P>
<P>That your Honours Respondant, according to the purport of the said Writ, did summons the Free-holders of the County of <HI>Orange,</HI> which he conceived by the Writ to him directed, to be within his Baylwick; but the Mayor, and other of the Magi∣strates of the City of <HI>New-York,</HI> together with several other of the Citizens of the said City, alledging it to be an Infringement upon the Right of the said City, to admit any Persons of a Forreign County to be Chusers or Electors of the four Re∣presentatives, which by the first Constitution of Assemblies in this Province were allotted and appropriated to <HI>New-York</HI>; and that they conceived, That the Writ could not change the Fundamental Constitution of the Government, which is con∣firmed by Act of Assembly. Therefore he, with the Advice &amp; Consent of the majority of the Electors, did not admit of the Free-holders of <HI>Orange County</HI> to vote, but their Names to be put in a List by themselves, that what may be offered against the Right of the City, might be better considered afterwards, if there should be any need of disputing the same.</P>
<P>Your Honours Respondant, for the just observing of his Duty, by the aforesaid Writ required, he did in open Field, after the Publication of his Writ, appoint twelve of the Electors to be Witnesses of the faithful Execution of his Writ, if an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Controversie should arise about those that were elected to serve in Assembly, and required ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tness the Truth of his Execution of the said Writ, whose Names are hereunto annexed; which Electors were approved of by the Candidates of either Party.</P>
<P>The said Respondant on the said twelfth Day of <HI>May,</HI> according to the Request of the Electors, that were then in the Field, upon the Nomination of several Candidates that were proposed to represent the said Electors in Assembly, did agree to the Poll that was demanded, but the Disorder of the People was so great, and the little con∣veniency in the Field for the taking the said Poll, did adjourn the same to the Town Hall of the said City, as he humbly conceives by the aforesaid Statutes, he hath Power
<PB N="3" REF="000852_0003_0FABA189F55B2A18"/>
to do; the appointing of the Time and Place of Election, by the said Writ, being wholly left to the Discretion of the Sheriff, and by the Command of the Law he needed not the Consent of any Person to joyn with him in the Adj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ment of the said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the Town Hall, because he is authorized, both by the Statute-Law and Customs of <HI>England</HI> to do the same.</P>
<P>Your Honours Respondant doth further say, That he did not refuse any of the Candidates to be present at the taking of the Poll, nor was he abusive to an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of them▪ but the Candidates of one side being only present, and one of them so Rude as to take his Chair from him, he did thereupon rebuk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the said Candidate, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id him get out of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hair, who replyed, <HI>He had mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e right to be there than this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>; which he also conceives to be a Violence to the Right of his Office, which makes him the sole Judge of the Poll, as the Statutes do express at large, there being none invested with the Power of an Oath but himself.</P>
<P>And as for the Witnesses that were appointed for the Scrutiny the Poll, and the returning of the Persons elected, they were the most Reputable I could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame on either side, on behalf of the Candid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tes, and they were under no Restriction, but had the freedom of their Judgment, without any Imposition; and if Truth swa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed or con∣vinced them to be in the right, I hope it will not be imputed as a blame to me, since I have taken all the care imaginable faithfully to discharge my Duty.</P>
<P>And as for the Reproachful Allegation of the Petitioners, <HI>That they had the majority of Votes,</HI> the Return under the Hands and Seals of the Electors, will evidence it to be grosly false; for in the Examination or scrutiny of the Poll, the Rules observed and agreed by the Witnesse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were such, That no Person should be admitted to elect on either side, but such as had a Freedom Free-hold in the City or County, or enrolled Free-men, and were of Age, Natural born Subjects, Denizens or Naturalized, and that all those that were A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ens, under Age, or had not their Freedoms, or were not enrolled, nor had any Free-hold, should not have the liberty of Choice. Whereupon the Witnesses, upon the scrutiny, did refuse forty eight Persons that were in the Poll, in right of those that I returned, and excluded them from their Vote; and upon the scrutiny of the Candidates of the Petitioners, there were in like manner eighty eight Persons refused, who according to the agreement aforesaid, were not qualified to give their Votes; and time was allowed for the Persons excepted to justifie their Right of Voting, if any they had, which not being done, they were excluded; by which means, at the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osing of the scrutiny, there did appear to be Fifty Eight Electors more for those that I have returned, than there were in favour of the other Candidates, or the Contumelious Petitioners. And there being but twenty one of the Free-holders of <HI>Orange</HI> County, who did Vote, if they had been allowed by the City, yet still there should be Thirty Seven more Votes for those whom I did Return by my inden∣tures, sealed and lawfully executed by seven of the principal Free-holders of the said City. Which Return I know to be just and true, and thereupon, according to my Oath and Duty I did it, and am ready, upon the Oathes of the Witnesses to make appear. And therefore humbly pray to be from this <HI>Calumnious</HI> and <HI>Vexatious Complaint</HI> dismist.</P>

<P>To the first Paragraph:</P>
<P>HE the said <HI>Ebenezer VVillson,</HI> High-Sheriff, by his Answer pretends, that he has made a just and true Return o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Persons that were truly elected by the Free-holders and Free-men of this City; Whereby he intimates, that the Free-holders of the County of <HI>Orange</HI> were no ways concerned in the choice of the Represe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tatives, although it does plainly appear by the Indenture, that the Persons he returned are elected b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the majority of Voice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Free-men and Free-holders of the City and both Counties; and how this can agree with his Majesties Writ, and Return thereupon, when by this Answer it is averre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e has returned the Representatives chosen by this City and County, and by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>entures of Return it appears, that another County was therein concerned; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> can he make Return of the Voices of those Persons Free-holders of the County of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ange,</HI> whose Votes upon the Poll he denyed to admit, and yet all this he pretends to justifie by the Statutes of the 8th and 10th year of <HI>Henry</HI> the 6<HI>th</HI>; which, with humble submission to this House, we must say, seems very strange, that Mr. Sheriff should pretend that the said Statutes were of Force in this Province, when it is evident that the same were enacted before any of these <HI>American</HI> parts were Dominions of the Crown of <HI>England</HI>; and that at the Poll he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ould deny us the advantages we could pretend unto by a Statute made in the 7th &amp; 8th year of our Soveraign Lord <HI>VVilliam,</HI> now King of <HI>England.</HI> But if we come to consider the said Statutes, it plainly appears, that Mr. Sheriff ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not made a due Return; for the said Statutes positively ave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, That the Chusers, who should vote for Knights of the Shires, should be dwelling and resident in the County where they should give their Votes; whereby it is plain, That all those Persons that live at <HI>New-K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hell</HI>▪ and else∣where, ought not to have been admitted to poll on account of their pretended Free∣dom from the City, which would greatly diminish the Number of Voices for the Persons he has returned.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="000852_0005_0FABA18B705FE940"/>
To the Second Paragraph,</P>
<P>That your Replyants do much admire Mr. Sheriff should so far forget himself in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Answer, as to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd that he left the People of the County of <HI>Orange</HI> in dispute, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the Return it appears he allowed of them</P>
<P><HI>To the Third,</HI> How faithf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly Mr. Sheriff has executed his Writ will appear in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><HI>To the Fourth,</HI> Mr. Sheriff pretends to Warrant his Proceedings, as to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Time and Place of El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction, by the aforesaid Statutes, whereby no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Power is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all given to him, as by an Over of them will appear But by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the 7th and 8th year of our Lord the King th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t now is, it is Enacted, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at the Sheriff shall not adjourn the Poll without consent of the Candidates, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sheriff did, contrary to our consent, which in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Answer he pretends to justifie.</P>
<P><HI>To the Fifth,</HI> As to what Mr. Sheriff pretends to be abused by one o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, will appear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>lous; but that he gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly abused <HI>Leo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d Lewis,</HI> one of your Petitioners, Candidate and Justice of the Peace in this City, by pulling him by the Arm, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>awing his Chair from under him, when he was present, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Law <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conceived to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve a right to be, is evident And if no Person had the Power to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th but Mr. Sheriff, it is very strange that he being often desired, wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> admi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ister an Oath to those that came to Poll, as is directed by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th &amp; 8th Year of our Lord the King that now is.</P>
<P><HI>To the two last,</HI> We do say, as in our Petition.

<HEAD>To the Honourable House of Representatives for the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> Convened in General Assembly.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Answer of <HI>Benjamin Coll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> High-Sheriff of the County of <HI>Westchester,</HI> to the Ʋnjust and Vexations Complaint of <HI>Josiah Hunt, Henry Fowler</HI> and <HI>John Shute,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN Obedience to his Majesties Writ to me directed, for the Election of two Repre∣sentatives to serve for the said County in General Assembly, I gave publick Notice, according to usual Method, That on the fifth Day of <HI>May</HI> last, was the time appointed by me for the said Election▪ and accordingly at the place appointed the Free-holders appeared, and after I had published his Majesties Writ at the time appointed, I desired them to proceed in their Choice. Whereupon Capt. <HI>John Drake</HI> and Mr. <HI>Joseph Pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> Substantial Freeholders of the said County, were named as Candidates, and no other Person whatsoever was put up, so that the Election was <HI>Nimine Contradicente.</HI> 'Tis true, some of the Free-holders of said County cryed out, <HI>VVe protest against the Election,</HI> but offered no Reason why, neither, as is already said, did they name any other Candidate, neither were they a third part of the Free-holders there met together to make the said Election; so that in my humble Opinion the Representatives returned by me to serve in G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neral Assembly, were fairly and duely elected, and accordingly the Witnesses appointed to see that the Election was fair, signed the Indentures.</P>
<P>And whereas the said Complainants have declared, <HI>That several Persons that voted for the said Representatives returned, were not Free-holders of the said County</HI>; which is a Columnious Assertion, as will appear by the Names of the Free-holders that made the said Election. That any Artifices were used to disturb and hinder the Freedom of the Choice, is wholly erronious And the time appointed for the said Election was at ten of the Clock in the Fore-noon of the said 5<HI>th</HI> day of <HI>May,</HI> at which hour the Free-holders of the said County met upon the Green (the place appointed) and elected the said Persons returned; and that there might be no dispute for want of time, it was about 4 or 5 a Clock in the after-noon before the Indentures of the said Return were signed. So that that Assertion of the said <HI>Josiah H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, &amp;c.</HI> in their Petition alledged, is nothing but Vexatious. So that I am humbly of Opinion, I have made a due Return of his Majesties Writ, and acted nothing in the said Election but what is according to Law. And that I, with the Witnesses of the said Election, are ready to testifie the Truth of this Answer upon Oath. Therefore I humbly desire the honourable House, That I may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e dismist from the said Contumelious and Vexatious Complaint.</P>
