this their Sinful <HI>Folly. <HI>At the Last</HI>;</HI> That is, When <HI>Death</HI> makes near Approaches unto them; THEN! <HI>Then</HI> 'tis, that men come to call themselves <HI>Fools,</HI> with <HI>Furi∣ous Reflections</HI> of <HI>Conscience,</HI> upon the Ex∣orbitances, which they once pleased themselves withal.

<P>When the <HI>Sinful Children</HI> of men, see themselves likely to <HI>Live</HI> no longer, they are commonly sensible of the many <HI>Sin∣ful Errors,</HI> with which their <HI>Lives,</HI> have been Disordered.</P>
<P>This <HI>Observation,</HI> supposes, that men have been Illuminated, with the <HI>Truths,</HI> and <HI>Rules,</HI> of the <HI>Gospel</HI>; and that these men have some Exercise of <HI>Rational Fa∣culties,</HI> when they see their <HI>Death</HI> advan∣cing upon them. Upon such a Suppo∣sition, we say, That men are commonly Guilty of much <HI>Disorder</HI> in their <HI>Lives,</HI> while they Live in <HI>Prosperity,</HI> and while they <HI>Dream</HI> of having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> many a fair Day to Live: But, <HI><HI>at the Last</HI>!

men, into much <HI>Disorder of Life</HI>? One cause of it, is, their thinking, like the <HI>Rich Fool,</HI> in Luk. 12.20. <HI>That there will be many years, before their Souls be required of them:</HI> One cause of it, is, their doing like the Ill men, in Amos 6.3. <HI>Put far away the Evil Day.</HI> But when men come to see, their <HI>Souls</HI> just going to <HI>be Required of them,</HI> and the <HI>Evil Day</HI> just laying its <HI>Arrest</HI> upon them; <HI>Then</HI>! even <HI>at the Last,</HI> they see, that all their Disobedience against God hath been an unaccountable <HI>Folly.</HI> The most of men, when they are just <HI>Going to the Dead</HI> they see that <HI>Madness has been in their Hearts, while they have Lived:</HI> and they see it, with wonderful Agonies of Astonish∣ment.</P>

<P N="1">I. <HI>At the Last,</HI> When we see our selves likely to Live no longer in the <HI>World,</HI> We shall see and say, <HI>That it is a Miserable Thing to be put off with a Portion in the World.</HI> While men think, of con∣tinuing yet many a long Summers Day in the <HI>World,</HI> they are strangly &amp; strong∣ly, <HI>Fascinated</HI> with <HI>Worldly Accommoda∣tions</HI>;

When men see themselves just leaving of the World; Then, they cry out, with Words, not unlike those of the Psalmist, in Psal. 17.14. O <HI>deliver me from</HI> (ever being like) <HI>the Men of the World, that have their Portion in this Life!</HI> Tis very certain, that <HI>at the Last,</HI> when you are taking your leave of this <HI>World,</HI> you will be full of Disdainful Exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essions concerning it, and Express your selves to this purpose; <HI>Vain World!

<P N="3">III. <HI>At the Last,</HI> When we see our selves likely to Live no longer, under the Offers of the Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> we shall see and say, <HI>That a CHRIST is the most precious Thing imaginable.</HI> When <HI>David</HI> was drawing near his <HI>End,</HI> his mind ran much upon a <HI>Christ.</HI> Thus we read, (for so I read it) in 2 Sam. 23.3, 5. <HI>Now these be the last words of David; There shall be a Ruler over men, Just, Ruling in the Fear of God</HI>; [name∣ly the Messiah.] <HI>This is all my Salvation, and all my Desire, altho as yet He make Him not to Spring up</HI> Even so, a CHRIST; That will be <HI>all our Salvation, and all our Desire,</HI> when we are uttering our <HI>Last Words</HI> before the Lord.

But I can tell you, when you will cease to do it. <HI>At the Last,</HI> When you Ly a <HI>Dying, Then,</HI> this <HI>Prince of Life,</HI> will be esteem'd with you, <HI>The Pearl of great Price</HI>; and you will <HI>Prize</HI> Him, above whole Rocks of Diamonds, and whole Mountains of Gold. It is said of the <HI>Faithful,</HI> in 1 Pet. 2.7. <HI>To you that Believe, Christ is precious.</HI> Well, and it may be said of the <HI>Dying</HI> too; <HI>You will believe then that a Christ is precious!</HI> The <HI>Dying,</HI> do in some sort set their Seal, to that Esteem of a CHRIST, which all the <HI>Faithful</HI> have of Him. THEY are the Folks, that somewhat feel the circumstances of their Departing Souls, which call for a CHRIST. <HI>At the Last,</HI> the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of a <HI>Christ,</HI> for an <HI>Ignorant</HI> Soul, the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of a <HI>Christ,</HI> for a <HI>Guilty</HI> Soul, the <HI>Sanctification</HI> of a <HI>Christ,</HI> for a <HI>Filthy</HI> Soul, and the <HI>Redemp∣tion</HI> of a <HI>Christ,</HI> for an <HI>Enslaved</HI> Soul, will be with Inexpressible Ardors called for.

withal. Briefly, The Son of God, assum∣ing our Nature, became a <HI>Mediator,</HI> par∣ticularly Exercising a <HI>Priestly Office</HI>▪ in the yet more particular Capacity of a <HI>Surety,</HI> for us. This our <HI>Surety,</HI> did both Endure the <HI>Penalty</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> and Fulfil the <HI>Precept</HI> of it, in <HI>our stead</HI>; according to the <HI>Covenant of Redemption,</HI> wherein both God the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> consented unto such a Dispensation. There was in our Lord Jesus Christ, an Habitual <HI>Recti∣tude of Nature,</HI> which He was Born with∣al; Our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Walked</HI> most Holily, Blamelessly, Exactly, for many years together; Finally, our Lord Jesus Christ, underwent the sad <HI>Pain,</HI> &amp; <HI>Shame,</HI> and <HI>Horror,</HI> that are the <HI>Essentials</HI> of the Punishment, whereto our Sins made us Obnoxious. God, in the <HI>Justification</HI> of His chosen, Imputes all of this Righte∣ousness unto them; that is, He graciously Looks on it, as <HI>Theirs</HI>; as belonging to <HI>Them,</HI> in order to their being <HI>Judicially</HI> dealt withal, according to the <HI>Merit</HI> thereof. <HI>Thus,</HI> even <HI>Thus</HI> to be <HI>Justified,</HI> will be a Thing marvellously agreeable unto us, when <HI>at the Last,</HI> we shall see

Alas, Thou wilt be a <HI>Vessel,</HI> for the dreadful Justice of Heaven, to make its direful Impressions upon forever. When you see This <HI>at the Last,</HI> you will then see, That you cannot Supply your selves with a <HI>Righteousness,</HI> wherein you may dare to appear before that God, who is of <HI>Purer Eyes, than to Behold Iniquity.</HI> As <HI>Jerom</HI> speaks, <HI>All Hands will then be dis∣solved because nothing done by our Hands, will be found to answer the Righteousness of God</HI> If your <HI>Good Works</HI> were never so perfect, according to Law, you will see, that they can be no Expiation for your former <HI>Evil</HI> ones; for they are no more than you should have owed unto God, if you had never Sinned against Him at all.

<P N="7">VII. <HI>At the Last,</HI> When we see our selves Likely to Live no Longer on <HI>Earth,</HI> we shall see and say, <HI>That the Wrath of God in Hell, is of all things the most For∣midable and Astonishing.</HI> The <HI>Wrath</HI> of God, seems not very Terrible, unto un∣godly men, while they are by a Life of Ungodliness Exposing themselves unto that <HI>Wrath</HI>; Perhaps, <HI>They Mock at the Fear of it.</HI> But when they are near to the <HI>Death,</HI> which Ensues upon such a <HI>Life,</HI> they are terribly Surprised, with the Ter∣rors of that <HI>Wrath,</HI> which they formerly and foolishly Despised. <HI>Then,</HI> even, <HI>at the Last,</HI> it will be with Sinful men, as it was when the horrendous Thunder storm, was rending the Sky, over the <HI>Assyrian</HI> Armies, in Isa. 33.14. <HI>The Sin∣ners are afraid, and Fearfulness doth Surprise the Hypocrites</HI>; they Cry out, <HI>Who amongst us shall dwell with the Devouring Fire? who amongst us shall dwell with Everlasting Burn∣ings</HI>? I knew, a very stout man, who, as he was going to Dy, said, <HI>I have been a∣mong Drawn Swords, and Armed men; I have stood before the mouths of Roaring
<PB N="36" REF="000796_0036_0FAA524D2745A660"/>
Canons, and where the Bullets have come as Thick as Hail about me; and yet I never knew what it was to be afraid: But now I am apprehensive of my being Exposed unto the Anger of the Almighty God, my Heart is overwhelmed with the Dread of it, my Heart even Dies within me, at the Thought of That! <HI>At the Last</HI>,</HI> When the De∣parting Soul of a man, sees himself rea∣dy to be Seized by the Vengeance of God, it strikes him with an Horrible Amazement, and, as <HI>Job</HI> speaks, he would <HI>fain flee out of the Hand of the Almighty</HI>: and he makes a <HI>Cry,</HI> like that of <HI>Corah</HI> going down into the devour∣ing Pit, <HI>Oh! must I be swallowed up</HI>! Examine an Expiring Sinner, <HI>at the Last,</HI> what he thinks, of the <HI>Worm that never dies,</HI> of the <HI>Fire that never shall be quenched,</HI> of Lingring through an <HI>Eterni∣ty</HI> of <HI>Wretchedness</HI> that never can be Lingred through, and of Lying under the Blows of Exa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>perated Holiness in the Lowest <HI>Hell,</HI> until the very Hea∣vens be no more? With Inexpressible Anguish, he will then cry out, <HI>Oh! 'Tis a fearful Thing thus to fall into the Hands

of the Living God!</HI> Or, as a miserable man, when he was passing into a doleful <HI>Eternity,</HI> said, <HI>If I were to Endure the Wrath of God, for ten Thousand years, Perhaps, I could think of Enduring it; but, when I think of Eternity, That, That amazes me! Conscience,</HI> wilt not thou then Whisper unto unhappy men, these Intimations of <HI>A Judgment to come,</HI> at which they will <HI>Tremble,</HI> when they feel their Summons unto that <HI>Judgment</HI>? I have seen Per∣sons Quaking on their Death-beds, and their very Beds therewith Shaking under them; From whence their first Shriek unto me, ha's been. <HI>Oh! Sir, The wrath of a Dreadful God, makes me Tremble; I Tremble, I Tremble, at that Wrath!</HI> And with such <HI>Horrors</HI> upon them, will the Unregenerate, <HI>at the Last,</HI> go Trem∣bling out of the World.</P>
<P>¶ Upon the whole then; What bet∣ter Improvement can be made of these things, than in that Sigh, Deut. 32.29. <HI>O that they were Wise, that they understood this, that they would Consider their Latter End!</HI> Possibly that Passage, may more immedi∣ately

Refer to the <HI>Blessedness,</HI> whereto the Jewish Nation shall be brought, in the <HI>Latter End,</HI> when the Long <HI>Tribula∣tion,</HI> which is now upon them, shall come unto an <HI>End.</HI> But the Thing that is now to be propounded is This; <HI>O that we were now so Wise, as to understand Now, what we shall understand at our Latter End! Repentance,</HI> is a Thing to be urged upon us; and a speedy <HI>Repentance</HI>▪ a present <HI>Repentance.</HI> What is <HI>Repentance?</HI> Tis for a man to <HI>Change his Mind,</HI> as one of the Greek words for it, in the New Testa∣ment Signifies. Well then, Let us now so <HI>Change our Mind,</HI> as to be now of the <HI>Mind,</HI> that we shall be of when we come to <HI>Dy.</HI> A Prudent man, will <HI>Dy Daily</HI>; and This is one Thing in our Doing so: Tis to <HI>Live</HI> Daily under the Power of such Impressions, as we shall have upon us, when we come to <HI>Dy.</HI> Oh! Don't put off our <HI>Change of Mind</HI>▪ until <HI>the Last</HI>; but <HI>Repent</HI> Speedily, <HI>Repent</HI> Pre∣sently, if you would have any Hopes that you Repent <HI>Sincerely.</HI></P>
<P>Attend unto a Threefold <HI>Admonition.</HI></P>
<P>First, Know, That it will not, it can∣not,
<PB N="39" REF="000796_0039_0FAA5251DEFDBF10"/>
be <HI>Long,</HI> before we come unto <HI>our Last.</HI> We are not only by <HI>Scripture,</HI> but also, by Repeated and Continual Experi∣ments, advised, as in Jam. 4.14. <HI>What is your Life? It is even a Vapor that appeareth for a Little while, and then it Vanisheth a∣way.</HI> When there is a Little <HI>Vapour</HI> spent, even that Little <HI>Vapour,</HI> of our Animal, or our Vital Spirits, we shall then see <HI>our Last:</HI> And this Little <HI>Va∣pour</HI> may not be Long i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Spending. How swiftly doth <HI>our Last</HI> Hour advance upon us? Every Time the <HI>Clock</HI> Strikes, it may <HI>Strike</HI> upon our Hearts, to think, <HI>Thus I am one Hour nearer to my Last!</HI> But, O mark what I say; That <HI>Hour</HI> is probably <HI>Nearer</HI> to None than to such as <HI>Least</HI> Think of it.</P>
<P>Secondly, Know, That as <HI>our Last,</HI> will come upon us very <HI>Speedily,</HI> so it may come upon us very <HI>Suddenly.</HI> What says the <HI>Preacher</HI>? in Eccl. 9.12. <HI>Man Knoweth not his Time.</HI> Even this is the Thing, that I must <HI>Preach</HI> to you, if I would not forget, and forfeit the Name of a <HI>Preacher</HI>; but this is the Thing that we are all of us, most of all, to <HI>Preach</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="000796_0040_0FAA5252925B2478"/>
unto our selves. We see <HI>Sudden Disasters,</HI> ever now and then overtaking our Neighbours; <HI>Now, I say unto you, Except we Repent, we may all of us Perish Like∣wise in such Disasters.</HI> When we go <HI>Out</HI> in a <HI>Morning,</HI> we are not certain, that ever we shall <HI>Come Home</HI>; when we come <HI>Home,</HI> in an <HI>Evening,</HI> we are not certain, that ever we shall <HI>Go Out</HI> again. Think we, <HI>I know not how soon I may come to my <HI>Last</HI>; or, Whether at my <HI>Last,</HI> I shall have any Time for Deliberation.</HI></P>
<P>Know, Finally, That a <HI>Repentance <HI>at the Last</HI>,</HI> if there be any <HI>Space</HI> for it, is mostly an <HI>Insincere,</HI> but always a <HI>Sus∣piti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> Repentance. <HI>Dying Penstents,</HI> for the most part, can have no better Ac∣count given of them, than that, in Psal. 78.34, 36. <HI>When He slew them, then they sought Him; and they Returned and Enqui¦red Early after God: Nevertheless, they did flatter Him with their mouth, and they Li∣ed unto Him with their Tongue.</HI> The <HI>Change of Mind,</HI> which takes men upon a Death bed, is usually no more than a <HI>Conviction</HI> upon them; there is no Real
<PB N="41" REF="000796_0041_0FAA525329A10350"/>
<HI>Conversion</HI> in it. Men are then only like Iron softned in the <HI>Fire</HI>; they soon Re∣turn to their former Hardness if God spare them from going down into the <HI>Unquenchable Fire.</HI> We have generally seen it so; and it has been an Observa∣tion particularly heretofore published un∣to the World;
<Q>I have known many <HI>Condemned Malefactors,</HI> under the Ex∣pectation of their Execution, to have such marvellous Expressions of <HI>Repen∣tance,</HI> that one could not have imagined meer <HI>Hypocr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sie</HI> in the bottom of all; and yet I m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st freely say it, of those <HI>pretended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> who have been Re∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved and Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>doned, I can't Remem∣ber <HI>Two,</HI> but what have afterwards proved P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>odigies or <HI>Wickedness.</HI></Q>
In an History of no less than <HI>Four Thousand years,</HI> there is but <HI>One</HI> Instance of a true <HI>Repentance <HI>at the Last</HI>,</HI> and <HI>he</HI> so circum∣stanced, as never any Sinner can be af∣ter him. What says the Apostle, in Phil 2 12, 13. <HI>Work out your own Salva∣tion with Fear and Trembling; For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of His own good pleasure.</HI> Sy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, The
<PB N="42" REF="000796_0042_0FAA52540CCBB608"/>
<HI>Repentance to Salvation,</HI> you can't give it unto your selves, at your <HI>own plea∣sure</HI>; Then <HI>Fear,</HI> Then <HI>Tremble,</HI> to De∣lay your Complyance with the motions of the Holy Spirit of God, now inviting you unto <HI>Repentance.</HI> Madman, wilt thou drink a Draught of <HI>Deadly Poison,</HI> because thou hast heard, that there is <HI>one Antidote</HI> for the poison, though thou art not sure of obtaining that <HI>Antidote</HI>? Every Sinful <HI>Error</HI> of thy Life, is a Draught of <HI>Deadly Poison</HI>▪ Oh! Don't Forecast a <HI>Repentance, <HI>at the Last</HI></HI>! No, you have had the fairest <HI>Warning,</HI> that it is possible any persons Living, should have, to amend the <HI>Errors</HI> of your Lives; and there is cause to be Afraid, [Let me speak such a solemn and awful word!] that God will never give a <HI>Death bed Re∣pentance,</HI> unto many of <HI>you</HI> that have had such a <HI>Warning.</HI> Indeed the <HI>Grace</HI> of God, is Infinite, and may not be limit∣ed: But if you go on still in your <HI>Er∣rors,</HI> 'tis willingly, 'tis wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>lly, 'tis in <HI>Defiance</HI> of the Holy God: The Spirit of God, and of <HI>Repentance,</HI> is hideously <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fi'd,</HI> by this procrastination of <HI>Repen∣tance</HI>:
<PB N="43" REF="000796_0043_0FAA5254A620D570"/>
You do all that you <HI>can,</HI> to make your selves Incapable of the Gift of <HI>Re∣pentance,</HI> and you <HI>Treasure up for your selves Wrath against the Day of Wrath.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, Let us come unto a <HI>sound mind,</HI> and Resign our selves up unto the <HI>Spirit</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, that we may, even with a <HI>Good Principle</HI> infused into us, be <HI>Renewed in the Spirit of our mind</HI>; and so be able to say with him, in Psal. 119: 59, 60. <HI>Lord, I thought on my wayes, and I turned my Feet unto thy Testimonies; I made haste, and I delay'd not to keep thy Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>¶ And now, having been thus un∣gainsayably Reasoned withal, and ha∣ving had such Reasonable Things, with such plain and fair <HI>Warnings,</HI> now set before you, what remains but that a most <HI>Particular Effect</HI> hereof should be obtained!</P>
<P>The <HI>Effect</HI> most particularly to be desired is, That you Turn these <HI>War∣nings</HI>
<PB REF="000796_0044_0FAA525599285690"/>
into so many <HI>Prayers.</HI> Do it, Syrs, lest the Almighty God at length turn them into so many <HI>Torments! Many Stripes,</HI> will be the Fruit of these <HI>Ad∣monitions,</HI> if you do not now make your Seasonable <HI>Supplications</HI> to the God of Heaven, That you may <HI>Now</HI> Think, and <HI>Now</HI> Do, as you have been Admo∣nished. Look back, I say, upon the <HI>Warnings</HI> that you have had, and suita∣bly to every <HI>One</HI> of them, Let your Pe∣titions be now spread before the Lord, That you may <HI>Now</HI> Believe, and <HI>Now</HI> Practise, and <HI>Now</HI> Avoid, and <HI>Now</HI> Pur∣sue, and <HI>Now</HI> Enjoy, all things accor∣ding to those Apprehensions, which <HI>at the Last,</HI> will come upon you. But that which is above all Now to be En∣deavoured, is, that you may immediate∣ly give such an Answer unto the <HI>Stri∣vings</HI> of the Holy Spirit with you, as may Settle your Eternal Peace, and give you to find your selves <HI>at the Last,</HI> provided of <HI>Peace,</HI> yea, of <HI>Joy Unspea∣kable and full of Glory.</HI> I am verily per∣swaded that the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, is from what you have
<PB N="45" REF="000796_0045_0FAA525659B64680"/>
heard, now <HI>Striving</HI> with you. Those Devout Motions, which are now <HI>Stirring</HI> in your minds, are the Motions of that <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> so <HI>Striving</HI> with you. If you <HI>Resist</HI> them, Deny them, Divert them, it may be, that <HI>Grieved Spirit</HI> will withdraw from you, for ever; <HI>Then,</HI> this will prove but a <HI>Funeral Sermon</HI> for that unhappy <HI>Soul</HI> of thine, O man; and <HI>at the Last,</HI> the Omnipotent <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, will Smite thy <HI>Soul,</HI> with Endless, and Easeless Tortures, as with flashes of hot Lightning for ever. But, Oh! being thus <HI>Warned,</HI> of <HI>What is to come <HI>at the Last</HI></HI>! I beseech you, to make, [and yet own at the Foot of <HI>Soveraign Grace,</HI> that without <HI>His</HI> altogether Undeserved Help you can∣not make!] Such a Return unto the proposals of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> as may assure your <HI>Safety,</HI> and your <HI>Com∣fort, <HI>at the Last</HI>.</HI></P>
<P>Retire, I beseech you, and bestow a Distinct <HI>Pause</HI> on each of those Pro∣posals, <HI>pausing</HI> on them, till with a Consenting Soul, you say, <HI>Amen,</HI> unto them.</P>
