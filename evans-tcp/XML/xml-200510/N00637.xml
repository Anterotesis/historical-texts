<P>THE life of a Believer is in nothing more exprest to the life, than in that of a Souldier. There is therefore advantage for a Minister of the Gospel, when called to speak to that Order of men, to improve the <HI>Meta∣phor,</HI> for the common benefit of all that pro∣fess themselves to be of the <HI>Church Militant</HI>: and herein to imitate <HI>Christ</HI> himself, who took all opportunities to <HI>Spiritualize</HI> every thing that he had Occasion to discourse of: and were it not for this, there would be small en∣couragement to appear in this work at such a day, wherein the ancient <HI>Military Spirit</HI> is well nigh lost, as if there were no farther use for it: whereas, if it be thus also with <HI>Christi∣ans</HI> in regard of their <HI>Spiritual Warfare,</HI> there is need of taking all Opportunities to rouse them up, lest they rue it for ever.</P>
<P>The great encouragement of a <HI>Souldier,</HI> to be valiant, is the hope of <HI>Victory,</HI> and a <HI>Tri∣umph</HI> following upon it: and herein is the true <HI>Christian</HI> Priviledged' that he is not left at <HI>Ʋncertainty,</HI> to the <HI>Chance of War,</HI> wherein <HI>the Battel is not alwayes to the Strong,</HI> but the
<PB REF="000774_0003_0FAA53836CD6A340"/>
issue is secured, &amp; the <HI>Triumph</HI> making ready to be Solemnized with the greatest state.</P>
<P>The Reverend Author of the Ensuing <HI>Ser∣mon,</HI> hath in it, according to the Grace of God given him, in <HI>Military Terms,</HI> suitably repre∣sented this Glorious <HI>Victory</HI> and <HI>Triumph,</HI> for the Directing, quickning, and encouraging all the <HI>Souldiers of Christ,</HI> in their Warfare. It will therefore be of Universal profit to all that Read it with a serious Consideration, to help them in their <HI>Fighting the good fight of Faith,</HI> unto perseverance, in prospect of the <HI>Crown of Life,</HI> which <HI>Christ, the Captain of our Salvation,</HI> who is eye witness of all the reso∣lution we express herein against our <HI>Souls Ad∣versaries,</HI> will set upon their heads ere long, in the view of Angels and men; to whose Blessing I Commend it for the happy Success:</P>

<HEAD>The Saints Victory and Tri∣umph over Sin &amp; Death.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>1 Cor. 15.57.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Thanks be to God which giveth us the Victory; through our Lord Jesus Christ.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Emperour <HI>Valentinian,</HI> when He was Dying, had his Friends comforting of him with the Re∣membrance of his past <HI>Victories</HI>: He told them that he Gloryed in one Victory above all the rest; <HI>Inimicorum nequis∣simum vici</HI> (said he) <HI>carnem meam: I have had a Victory over my Flesh, the worst Enemy in the World.</HI> Now my <HI>Text</HI> presents us with a Glorious <HI>Victory,</HI> and Eternal <HI>Triumph,</HI> not only over one, but over all Evils and Enemies; and gives the <HI>Dying</HI> Chri∣stian ground to say, with the Blessed Apostle, <HI>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the Faith: Hence forth there is Laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord, the Righteous Judge shall give me at that day</HI>; and he
<PB N="6" REF="000774_0004_0FAA5383C3061BE0"/>
may Triumphantly add, <HI>O Death where is thy Sting? O Grave where is thy Victory?</HI> Of all terri∣ble <HI>Enemies,</HI> Death the <HI>King of Terrors</HI> is most ter∣rible; and of all <HI>Houses,</HI> the Grave, <HI>The House for all Living,</HI> is the most dark and dismal to the Eye of Nature; but yet the Truths of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> concerning both, are much more comfor∣table: As appears by this glorious Triumph of Faith over both, arising from the consideration of the Resurrection of the Dead, and Change of the Living; which is exprest in the 55, 56, 57. <HI>verses</HI> of this <HI>Chapter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Oh Death where is thy Sting? Oh Grave where is thy Victory? the sting of Death is sin, and the strength of sin is the Law; but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ</HI>: which the Apostle interpreteth thus. <HI>The sting of Death</HI> [that is, that whereby Death is rendred terrible and destructive] is <HI>Sin,</HI> that is, the Transgression of the first man <HI>Adam,</HI> in whom all dye; yet made more deadly by our Actual Transgressions: but it is that which is the Condemning Sin.</P>
<P>And what is the <HI>strength of Sin,</HI> whereby it pre∣vails thus unto death? Why, it is <HI>the Law: In the Day that thou Eatest thereof, thou shalt dye the Death; and the Soul that sinneth, it shall dye.</HI> Thus, <HI>By one man Sin Entred into the World, and Death by Sin; and so Death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned,</HI> Rom. 5.12. Now God's Truth and Justice is ingaged to punish Sin with Death; and here is the strength of sin to punish the Sinner; that
<PB N="7" REF="000774_0004_0FAA5383C3061BE0"/>
is, the demerit of Sin is appointed by the Law.</P>
<P>But whence then is this Triumph? <HI>God hath given us the Victory</HI>] God that appointed the Law for mans rule, and Death for the punish∣ment of mans Transgression [<HI>hath given us the Victory</HI>] by taking away Sin, and so our obligati∣on to suffer the punishment; and so changing the very Nature of Death, that now it ceaseth to be deadly, and becomes salutiterous.</P>
<P>But how did the Lord effect this? It was, [<HI>through Jesus Christ our Lord</HI>] that is, by the Death, and Obedience unto Death of that one man Christ Jesus our Lord: In which there was <HI>Satisfaction</HI> to the Law, <HI>Justification</HI> to the Sinner, <HI>Merit</HI> of Life and Glory. Christ by his Resur∣rection and Ascension took possession of all for us, and makes way for the Effectual Application of all to us.</P>
<P>The Summe is,</P>
<P>That whereas Death and the Grave are most terrible Enemies, by reason of the demerit of sin, binding over the Sinner to answer the Law in suffering the punishment by Law due to Sin; yet God of his Grace having given <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> for our <HI>Surety,</HI> and so for our <HI>Saviour</HI> from Sin and Death, hath by taking away <HI>Sin,</HI> and rendring <HI>Death</HI> unable to do us any hurt, given us cause, whilst we look at Death as terrible through Sin, to Triumph over it, as Captivated to our Service, by Jesus Christ our Lord: And as Christ hath gi∣ven us an <HI>Eternal Triumph</HI> over Death the Last
<PB N="8" REF="000774_0005_0FAA5384808DAD88"/>
Enemy; so hath therein given us a <HI>Happy Victory,</HI> and Holy Triumph over all Evils and Enemies; Temporal, Spiritual, Eternal.</P>
<P>Hence Observe:</P>
<P>DOCTRINE.</P>
<P>That the true Christian Souldier shall at last obtain a compleat Victory, and Eternal Triumph over all Evils and Enemies, is matter of Thanksgiving un∣to God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Christiani</HI> (saith <HI>Cyprian) mori possunt, vinci non possunt.</HI> Christians may Dye, but cannot be O∣vercome. Death may <HI>Kill</HI> them, but cannot <HI>Conquer</HI> them: The Victory of Christian Souldi∣ers over their Enemies, is very Glorious in this respect.</P>
<P>To clear up this Doctrine, take two Propositi∣ons.</P>
<P>PROPOSITION I.</P>
<P>That the true Christian Souldier shall at last obtain a compleat Victory and an Eternal Triumph over all Evils and Enemies.</P>
<P>PROPOSITION II.</P>
<P>That this is matter of Thanksgiving unto God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<PB N="9" REF="000774_0005_0FAA5384808DAD88"/>
<HEAD>PROPOSITION I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>That the true Christian Souldier shall at last obtain a compleat victory and an Eternal Triumph over all Evils and Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>For the clearing up of this Proposition, take a few Conclusions as Praeliminary.</P>
<P>Conclusion I. <HI>Christ Jesus is the Captain General of Salvation.</HI> Heb. 2.10. <HI>For it became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things; in bringing many Sons unto Glory, to make the Captain of their Salvation perfect through Sufferings.</HI> The Author of the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> doth here evidently compare Christ to <HI>Joshua,</HI> the Captain and Leader of the People into <HI>Canaan</HI>; and all true Christians are put under his Conduct and Guidance to bring them safe to Glory.</P>
<P>Christ is called their <HI>[ARCHEGOS] Prince, Ruler and Captain of their Salvation,</HI> in respect of his Authority and Right to Rule over them, in order unto their Salvation. Hence He appeared unto <HI>Joshua,</HI> as the <HI>Captain of the Lords Host,</HI> Josh. 5.14. Christ is the <HI>Captain of Salvation</HI> in respect of this actual Leading and Conduct of them, by his <HI>Example, Spirit and Grace,</HI> through all the Dif∣ficulties of their way, and warfare: he is there∣fore called, a <HI>Leader and Commander to the People,</HI> Isa. 55.4. <HI>Behold I have given him for a witness to
<PB REF="000774_0006_0FAA53852D2144B8"/>
the people, a Leader and Commander to the People·</HI> So He is their [<HI>PRODROMOS</HI>] their <HI>Fore-runners</HI> Heb. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 20. <HI>Whether the Fore-runner is for us Entred, even Jesus, made an High Priest for ever after the Order of Melchizedek.</HI> Or as <HI>Daniel</HI> calls Him, the <HI>Messiah,</HI> the <HI>Prince</HI> or <HI>Guide.</HI> Dan. 9.25. <HI>know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and build Jerusalem, un∣to the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Yea, Christ is the <HI>Captain of Salvation,</HI> as he is to them the <HI>Author</HI> or <HI>Cause</HI> of <HI>Eternal Salvation</HI>; he procured &amp; purchased it for them, &amp; gives them safe conduct unto the full Enjoyment of it. The way in which God will bring the Christian Soul∣dier to Glory, is full of Intricacy, Difficulty, Per∣plexity and Opposition; so that he hath need of a <HI>Captain,</HI> Leader &amp; Guide, to carry him through it; but yet all is rendred safe and secure to him, through the power, grace and faithfulness of his Leader.</P>
<P>Conclusion 2. <HI>This Captain hath his Souldiers and Followers.</HI> Every true Christian is a Souldier un∣der the Command and Conduct of Christ as his General. 2 Tim. 2.3. <HI>Thou therefore endure hard∣ness as a good Souldier of Jesus Christ.</HI> Every Chri∣stian when he is new Born, is Born a Souldier. It is said of <HI>Goliah.</HI> that <HI>He was a man of War from his Youth</HI>; 1 Sam. 17.23. but it may be tru∣ly said of the true Christian, that he is a man of War from his <HI>Birth</HI>; he hath at his first Conver∣sion
<PB N="11" REF="000774_0006_0FAA53852D2144B8"/>
given himself up unto Christ, as the Captain of his Salvation, Listed himself under Christ's Banner, and hath ingaged to Fight under his Command and Conduct: He is on Christ's side, Christ's Enemies are his Enemies, and Christ's Friends and Followers, are his Brethren, Compa∣nions and Fellow-Souldiers: as <HI>Paul</HI> calls <HI>Archippus</HI> his Fellow-Souldier; not only as a Minister, but as a Christian. <HI>Philemon verse</HI> 2. <HI>Aphia and Archip∣pus our Fellow Souldiers.</HI></P>
<P>And as Christians are Souldiers, so <HI>Congregatio∣nal Churches,</HI> are particular Companies, to which Christians (that walk orderly, and have oppor∣tunity) do joyn in Fellowship; and the Visible <HI>Catholick Church,</HI> is as an Army with Banners. <HI>Cant.</HI> 6.4. <HI>Thou art beautiful, O my Love, as Tirzah comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an Army with Ban∣ners</HI>: This Army hath the Captain of the Lords Host for their General.</P>
<P>Conclusion 3. <HI>These Souldiers are compleat in Arms. Truth</HI> is their <HI>Girdle, Righteousness</HI> their <HI>Breast-plate, Preparation of the Gospel,</HI> their <HI>Shoes; Faith</HI> their <HI>Shield, Hope</HI> their <HI>Helmet,</HI> the <HI>Word of God</HI> their <HI>Sword:</HI> and <HI>Prayer,</HI> if not a distinct piece of Armour, yet very necessary to the fast∣ning on, and improvement of those Weapons of their Spiritual Warfare: Hereby they ingage the Lord of Hosts, the God of Arm<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to be with them: Hence it is annexed to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>istians Pa∣noply, Eph. 6. <HI>from</HI> 11. to the 18th <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erse.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="000774_0007_0FAA5385F63CCBD0"/>Conclusion 4. <HI>This Captain General Leads his Souldiers into the Field, and teacheth them their Mili∣tary Skill.</HI> This World is the Field of War, and this Captain orders the time when, the place where, and means by which, the true Christian in Saving Conversion, and Religious Profession, shall enter into the Field, and the time how long he shall continue in the Field, and the several Engagements he shall be called to, and the varie∣ty of Entertainment he shall meet with here, and his Passage out of it: It is true in a Meta∣phorical, as well as in a Literal Sense, <HI>That our Times are in Gods Hands,</HI> Psal. 31.15. <HI>He also teacheth their hands to War, and their fingers to fight,</HI> Psal. 144.1. He bestows upon them all their Warlike Accomplishments; he gives them Skill and Will to Improve all their Spiritual Weapons <HI>Offensive</HI> and <HI>Defensive.</HI></P>
<P>Conclusion 5. <HI>This Captain of the Lords Host gives a Banner to his Souldiers and Followers, to be Displayed for their Safety in the worst times,</HI> Psal. 60.4, 5. <HI>Thou hast given a Banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the Truth.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. A <HI>Banner</HI> was of old (as now it is) a <HI>War∣like Ensign</HI> set up or displayed for the Souldiers, under the Conduct of such a Chieftain for Mili∣tary Ends; the civil use of it was commended &amp; commanded to <HI>Israel, Numb. second Chapter and every
<PB N="13" REF="000774_0007_0FAA5385F63CCBD0"/>
man must pitch by his own Standard, and by the Ensign of his Fathers House.</HI> It signifies the Throne of God amongst them; which was not amongst any of the rest of the Nations: Therefore this was the Warlike <HI>Motto</HI> of the Jews, <HI>Who is like to thee a∣mongst the Gods O Lord</HI>? Under this as a Displayed Banner <HI>David</HI> Marched against the <HI>Philistine</HI> Champion, 1 Sam. 17.45. <HI>I come against thee in the Name of the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israels Armies</HI> It had a special signification of the <HI>Messiah</HI> that was to be Lift up as a Banner. <HI>Isa.</HI> 10.12. <HI>In that day there shall be a Root of Jesse, which shall stand for an Ensign of the People, to it shall the Gen∣tiles seek, and his Rest shall be Glorious.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Banner</HI> signifies the Love of God, and Christ to his People, Cant. 2.4. <HI>His Banner over me was Love</HI>: This Love is manifested in their Preservation and Salvation from all their Enemies. Hence it is said, Isa. 62.10, 11. <HI>Lift up a Standard for the People, say, behold thy Salvation cometh.</HI></P>
<P>A Banner is put for all the manifest tokens of Gods Favour to, and gracious Presence with his People, <HI>Isa.</HI> 31.9. <HI>The Princes shall be afraid of the En∣sign, saith the Lord</HI>: that is, they shall see the Love and Faithfulness of God to his People and be afraid.</P>
<P N="2">II. This <HI>Banner</HI> is of great use to the Souldiers. The Standard, the Banner doth distinguish one Army from another: so doth the presence of God in Christ manifested by the signs thereof, distin∣guish
<PB N="14" REF="000774_0008_0FAA5386C82AB6A8"/>
Gods People from all others, <HI>Exod.</HI> 33.16. <HI>Numb.</HI> 23.21. <HI>Deut.</HI> 33.29. A Banner is for ho∣nour; the Ensign carrys with it the honour of the Company: the visible Tokens of Gods pre∣sence are the Glory of a People, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.11. <HI>Isa.</HI> 60.19. <HI>Thy God, thy Glory.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Banner</HI> is for direction to the whole band, and the Standard to the whole Army: so is Gods presence and conduct to His People; both in the <HI>March</HI>: Souldiers must follow their Colours, and in their <HI>Rest,</HI> when the Standard is pitch'd thats the place of Rest, <HI>Numb.</HI> 10.9.17, 18, 23▪ Yea when <HI>Scattered abroad</HI> by the violence of any temptation, the <HI>Colours</HI> shew whether the Souldier must repair: To Christ held forth shall the <HI>gathering of the People be, Gen.</HI> 49.10. Hence <HI>David</HI> calls back his Soul to God as his resting place. <HI>Psal.</HI> 116.7. <HI>Return unto thy rest O my Soul.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Banner</HI> is for <HI>Encouragement</HI> to the Souldier and his deeper Engagement to fight; he must not leave his <HI>Colours</HI> in the greatest hazard, but rather chuse to dy: so the Christian Souldier, must never forsake his God, Christ, his House, his Ordinances &amp;c. <HI>Josh.</HI> 5.13, 14, 15. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.29.</P>
<P>The <HI>Banner</HI> was for defence and shelter and deliverance; it was the safest place in all the <HI>Camp</HI>: so is the Spiritual <HI>Banner.</HI> Hence saith the <HI>Psalmist, he shall in the time of trouble hide me in his pavilion, in the secret of his tabernacle.</HI> Thus the <HI>Pillar of Cloud,</HI> was a defence to Israel.</P>
<P>The <HI>Banner</HI> is for <HI>Assurance</HI> and <HI>Confidence:</HI> as
<PB N="15" REF="000774_0008_0FAA5386C82AB6A8"/>
long as the Colours are flying the Army is not Ruined. As long as God Lives, and Christ is upon the throne, all is safe, for Gods People they may Triumph in Him over all their Enemies, and say, <HI>Oh! Death where is thy Sting &amp;c. Who shall separate us from the Love of God?</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Displaying of the Banner</HI> is the whole Military Improvement of it for the advantage of the Souldier, and the detriment of the Enemy. Therefore it is the flourishing of the Colours (as we call it) before the whole Army, and in sight of the Enemy. It is ascribed to God when he shines forth that <HI>dwells between the Cherubims</HI> &amp; <HI>leadeth Joseph like a flock</HI>: when he <HI>Stirs up his strength before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, Psal.</HI> 80.1, 2, 3 Causing his face to shine that they may be Saved.</P>
<P>This <HI>Banner</HI> is displayed by the <HI>Leaders</HI> of the People, when they give them Military encourage∣ment: from hence that God is their God; Christ upon the Throne, that he guides to the War by his <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Providence,</HI> and that he hath en∣gaged to be with them, and to fight for them, and that he commands them not to fear but to play the men, for their God and the cause of God. Thus <HI>Moses</HI> displayed the Banner before Israel, <HI>Ezod.</HI> 14.13, 14. <HI>Fear ye not, stand still, and see the Salvation of the Lord, the Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="000774_0009_0FAA538775D7EB98"/>Conclusion 6. <HI>Christ calls those that are under his Banner to Encounter the Enemy.</HI> True Christians have many Enemies to dispute with at the Swords point.</P>
<P N="1">I. They have a <HI>Body of Sin and Death</HI> in them which makes them many times to cry out with the Apostle: <HI>Oh wretched persons that we are, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall deliver us,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.24. there is a <HI>Law in their Members warring against the Law of their minds, and bringing them into Captivity to the Law of Sin which is in their Members,</HI> Rom. 7.23▪ They have <HI>Fleshly Lusts that war against their Soul,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.11. <HI>The Flesh Lusteth against the Spi¦rit, and the Spirit against the Flesh, and these are con∣tray one to the other.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. They must have a <HI>elose Combate with Sinful Self</HI>; they must deny themselves, <HI>Mat.</HI> 16.24▪ <HI>Then said Jesus unto his Disciples, if any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his Cross and follow me.</HI> They must deny their own <HI>Self-sufficiency,</HI> they must uncloath themselves o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> themselves; they must have no root of their own, but be all in Christ, and have their all from Christ, and improve their all for Christ. Col. 3.11. <HI>Christ is ALL &amp; in ALL:</HI> They must den<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their own Self-sufficiency to Believe in Christ, o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to yield Evangelical Obedience unto God through Christ, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.8. <HI>For by Grace are ye Saved throug<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="17" REF="000774_0009_0FAA538775D7EB98"/>
Faith, and that not of your selves, it is the Gift of God,</HI> Joh. 15.5. Christ saith, <HI>He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing:</HI> they must deny their own Self-sufficiency to Worship God in their Closets, in their Families, or in Publick, with Soul-Devotion, and so as may be to Divine Acceptation through Christ, without suitable sup∣plies of Divine Grace.</P>
<P>They must deny <HI>Self-Dependency</HI>: this Hos. 10.1. Self-Dependence is when a man thinks he has in himself Isa. 53.3. a Magazene of Supply sufficient for himself; and so lives on himself, and in depen∣dence upon himself; thus <HI>Peter</HI> depends upon himself for power to stand: <HI>if all forsake thee,</HI> (says <HI>Peter) yet wiil not I.</HI> Self-dependency emptieth us of the strength by which we should stand; it is only Christ we should depend upon, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.13. <HI>I can do all things through Christ that strengtheneth me,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.9, 10. <HI>Christ's Strength is made perfect in weakness:</HI> Hence sayes the Apostle, <HI>When I am weak, then am I strong.</HI></P>
<P>They must deny <HI>Self-security,</HI> Isa. 47.7, 8 Self-security is a mans making himself his own hiding place or refuge; it's the Souls standing upon his own legs, Psal. 30.6, 7. This makes God hide his face, and that is a sore Evil indeed, <HI>Job</HI> 23.1, 2, 3.</P>
<P>They must deny <HI>Self-Custody,</HI> they must not think they can antidote themselves against the In∣fection of Sins, and Sinful Times, and Compa∣panies,
<PB N="18" REF="000774_0010_0FAA5388590CAC88"/>
or can arm themselves against the Infect∣ion of things, whether Profits or Pleasures, <HI>Mat.</HI> 26.33.40.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Christ Supplyes with strength by His Grace,</HI> that they may be able to pass on in their way and warfare: they have a great Work and a great Warfare that they are Engaged in; they have much to do and much to suffer, and <HI>without</HI> him <HI>they can do nothing, Job.</HI> 15.5.

<P>Moreover, he subdues these Enemies in them; he inables true Christians in their own <HI>Persons</HI> to Conquer all these Enemies. They have <HI>Overcome the Wicked One,</HI> 1 Joh. 2.13.

<P>Yea, if the true Christian be for a time over∣come, yet he recovers himself at last, and gets the day: if he be foiled, and laid on his Back for a time, yet it is not long before be recovers himself, and gets up again by Godly Sorrow, Humiliation and Repentance; and renews the Combate, and is too hard for his Enemies: If he be Routed, he Rallyes again, and never leaves Fighting till he carries the day, and goes out of the Field Conqueror; <HI>If God be for him, who shall be against him?</HI> Moreover, his Enemies <HI>Lose Ground</HI> by all their partial Conquests of him.

Souldier a compleat Victory over Death the last Ene∣my,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.26. <HI>The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is Death</HI>: Here consider two or three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Death</HI> is an <HI>Enemy,</HI> a formidable Enemy, <HI>Job</HI> 18.14. <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.15. Now <HI>Death</HI> will appear to be an <HI>Enemy.</HI> if we consider that it deals with men as an Enemy, 1. In matters <HI>Outward,</HI> Tem∣poral, and of this Life; here Death is the great <HI>Bereaver,</HI> and the great <HI>Tormentor.</HI> Death robbs our Bodies of all perfection; Death forceth a man from his Wealth, and whole outward Estate with∣out hope of recovery, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 5.15. <HI>As he came forth of his Mothers Womb, naked shall he return, to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his Labour, which he may carry away in his hand, Job</HI> 1.21. Death spoils a man of his Name, Honours, and power in the World, <HI>Psal.</HI> 31.12. <HI>I am forgotten as a Dead man out of mind, I am like a broken vessel, Eccl.</HI> 3.18, 19, 20. Death separates dearest Friends, and nearest Relation. 2. Death deals with men as an Enemy, in matters <HI>Internal</HI> and Spiritual: Death deprives of all Spiritual good enjoyed in this Life: It cuts down the Tree that it stands no longer in the <HI>Vineyard</HI>; there is no Soul-saving Work to be done in the Grave whether we are all going, no opportunity to pray, hear, read be∣lieve or repent when once arrived at that House prepared for all Living: Death bereaves of the time, day, and season of Grace: when Death comes, God swears, <HI>Time shall be no more,</HI> his <HI>Spi∣rit
<PB N="29" REF="000774_0015_0FAA538D6D021070"/>
shall no longer strive</HI>; Death bereaves us of all opportunity to lay up for Eternity. 3. Death deals with men that dye in their Sins as an Ene∣my in matters Eternal and Everlasting. It be∣reaves of Eternal Good: all that dye under the power of Death, it proves an Eternal Bereave∣ment to them; they lose God, Christ, the Spi∣rit, Mercy, Grace, Glory, Heaven and Happiness. As Death is a great Bereaver, so he is a great <HI>Tormentor</HI>; all pain, sorrow, anguish and trouble, is but the working of Death in this Life; yea, it makes way for Eternal Misery in the Life to come.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Death</HI> is a <HI>cruel</HI> Enemy; Death is an Ene∣my that will shew no pitty, <HI>Cant.</HI> 8.6. it is cruel as appears by the Racks, Torments, Strapadoes, and Wounds that it inflicts; it is cruel in that it spares none for his Age, Rank or Quality, but is pittiless to all sorts of persons; it neither regards the person of the old, nor shews favour to the young; it regards no Cries, Prayers, Tears, ad∣mits no ransome, is not moved with any moans, sighs or groans, is deaf to all Entreaties. <HI>Death</HI> is an Enemy that <HI>cannot be avoided</HI>; you may fear Death, but cannot escape it, you may fly from it, but cannot get out of its reach; there is no safety from the Enemy, but in the bosome of Christ.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Death</HI> is a <HI>Vanquished</HI> Enemy; 'tis under the Keys of our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.18. Christ has overcome Death, and abolished it, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.10. Christ hath done this by his Death, <HI>meritoriously,</HI> by

<PB N="37" REF="000774_0019_0FAA53909215BAF0"/>
<HI>Honoured Gentlemen,</HI> that have pressed me, and cal∣led me unto the Service of this Day: You have heard, that we owe all due Acknowledgment to God through our Lord Jesus Christ, for all those Victories which he gives us, whether Temporal, or Spiritual. I am now to Exhort you.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To give God the Glory of all those Military Ac∣complishments,</HI> wherewith the God of Heaven hath Crowned you. It is He that <HI>Teacheth your Hands to War, and your Fingers to Fight,</HI> Psal. 144.1. Mi∣litary Skill is such a piece of Divine Wisdom, that the Lord will not lose the Honour of it. God is the <HI>Author</HI> of it: <HI>The Lord is a man of War, the Lord is his Name</HI>; he gives a Military <HI>Spirit,</HI> and Warlike Prowess, <HI>Jer.</HI> 51.11. <HI>Make bright the Arrows, gather the Shields, the Lord hath Raised the Spirit of the Kings of the Medes.</HI> He <HI>Teacheth</HI> to make Weapons of War, and the use of them, Isa. 54.16, 17. <HI>It is the Lord of Hosts that Mustereth the Host of the Battel,</HI> Isa. 13.4, 5: Otherwise the help of your Expert Officers, and your own En∣deavours to Learn War, will signifie nothing.</P>
<P>Indeed men of Martial Spirits and Skill ought to be Encouraged. These Trainings and Exerci∣ses are very commendable, and by all means to be Supported and Countenanced: and it is pitty that as in other things, so in this, the good old Spi∣rit is so much gone: these are not times wherein <HI>the Nations, beat their Swords into Plough shears, and their Spears into Pruning hooks. War</HI> in some cases is <HI>Lawful,</HI> and at some times <HI>Necessary,</HI> and sure
<PB N="38" REF="000774_0020_0FAA5392D06E2570"/>
then Learning of War is so also; Military <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is necessary in Military times, and Martial daye<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and such are the dayes we live in; and these Mi∣litary Exercises are not only lawful &amp; allowable▪ but laudable, yea &amp; necessary also; and the Per∣sons by whom they are supported and caried <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> deserve singular commendation and encourage∣ment.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Be Sons of Valour,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.8. Get you<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Consciences purged with the Blood of Christ that your hearts may be full of Courage for th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cause of Christ. <HI>True Courage</HI> arises from the <HI>As∣surance of Faith,</HI> that God in Christ is yours, the<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Death is yours, and all that you can fear is you<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for good: So that you may trust in God and not in Bow nor Sword, nor multitude, &amp;c. Then look on the <HI>Justice of the Cause</HI>; let it be for God and for the City of our God: then, <HI>One shall chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight,</HI> Deut. 30.30.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let your Study of Expertness in Military Dis∣cipline, put you in mind of your Spiritual Warfare.</HI> Oh maintain a close fight with your Spiritual Enemies Endeavour to choose Christ for your General, and in all things seek to please him: become his faith∣ful followers; <HI>follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes</HI>; approve your selves his good Souldiers; put on the whole Spiritual Armour, and become his Scholers; beg him to be your Tutor, and to in∣struct
<PB N="39" REF="000774_0020_0FAA5392D06E2570"/>
you in the whole Mystery of your Spiritual Warfare: Especially prepare for your great and last encounter with the <HI>King of Terrors</HI>; remem∣bring, that <HI>'tis appointed unto men once to dye, but af∣ter this, the Judgment, Heb</HI> 9 27. <HI>There is no dis∣charge in that War, Eccl.</HI> 8.8. There is no Mission nor Dismission in that War; as the <HI>Septuagint</HI> renders it: there is no <HI>Apparatus bellicus,</HI> against such an adversary, no arrow or javlin that a man can let fly in this Combate; there is no protection or deliverance from the hand of Death. Oh! therefore live alwayes in the full, firm belief of the other World, so as to dispatch all your work while it is day, <HI>Psa.</HI> 90.12. <HI>Psal.</HI> 39.4. <HI>Eccl.</HI> 7.2. Live in an instant, continual, constant Expectation of your Dissolution and Translation; this should be much upon your thoughts: Oh! remember Death is most certain; and when Death comes, things Temporal will take their final and Eternal fare-well of you, Friends, Relations, Riches, Ho∣nour, &amp;c. <HI>Prov.</HI> 3.5. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.29, 30, 31. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.7. The delights of Sin will be gone, that only which is Eternal will stand you in stead, when you come to Dy: It's nothing else but Saving Grace, Union to Christ, Communion with Christ &amp;c. that will be comfortable. Eternity is just before you, either an Eternity of Weal or an Eternity of Woe; yea, there will be no alteration of your State, when once arrived in Eternity &amp;c. Now therefore is the only time for preparation for Death and Eternity; and if we would be prepa∣red,
<PB N="40" REF="000774_0021_0FAA539462364530"/>
we must fight against our Spiritual Enemies, both in our private and publick Capacities; as <HI>Christians,</HI> as <HI>Magistrates,</HI> as <HI>Ministers,</HI> as <HI>Souldiers</HI>▪ &amp;c. depending upon Christ, the <HI>Captain of our Salvation,</HI> for Grace, Courage, Conduct and Conquest; and then shall we at last obtain a Compleat Victory, and Eternal Triumph over all Evils and Enemies; and be able in the Words of our Text, to say, <HI>Thanks be to God which giveth us the Victory, through our Lord Je∣sus Christ.</HI> To whom be Glory for Ever, and Ever. <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
