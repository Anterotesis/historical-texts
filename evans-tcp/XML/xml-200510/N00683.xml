<HEAD TYPE="sub">Uttered, <HI>Thursday</HI> 16 d 10 m. 1697.</HEAD>
<P>I Bring you this Day, a Text of Sacred Scrip∣ture, which a Faithful Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, lately gone unto Him, did before his going, order for you, as his <HI>Legacy.</HI> Give your Attention.</P>
<Q><BIBL>'Tis <HI>That,</HI> in Psal. XXXI.5.</BIBL> Into Thine Hand I Commit my Spirit.</Q>
<P>THat Holy, and Worthy Minister of the Gospel, whose <HI>Funeral</HI> is this Day to be attended, having Long Laboured for the Conver∣sion of men unto God, at length grew very <HI>Praesagious</HI> that his Labours in the E∣vangelical Ministry, drew near unto an End. While he was yet in Health, and not got be∣yond the Fifty Fourth Year of his Age, he did, with such a <HI>Praesage</HI> upon his mind, (having first written on this wise in his <HI>Diary, Oh! that
<PB N="4" REF="000828_0004_0FAB403E28F29EC8" MS="y"/>
Christs Death might fit me for my own!</HI>) begin to Study a Sermon, on this very Text, <HI>Into Thine Hand I Commit my Spirit.</HI> But his Great Ma∣ster, who favoured him with such a <HI>Praesage,</HI> never gave him an opportunity to Finish and Utter, what he had begun to Study. His <HI>Life</HI> had all this while, been a <HI>Practical Commentary</HI> upon his <HI>Doctrine</HI>; and now, behold! His <HI>Death</HI> must Expound and Apply the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> which he would have Preached unto us. He must show us, how to do that Important work of <HI>Committing a Departing Spirit into the Hands of God,</HI> no otherwise than by the Actual doing of that work himself. While therefore he Lay a Dying, he a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k'd one of his dearest Relations, <HI>Dost thou know what I am doing!</HI> She said, <HI>No</HI>; He then added, <HI>I am Rendring, I am Rendring!</HI> mea∣ning, I suppose, his own <HI>Spirit</HI> unto the Lord. But while he was doing of that work, and with Humble Resignation <HI>Committing his own Spirit into the Hands of God,</HI> he desired of me, that I would Preach upon the Text, about which he had been under such Intentions. Where∣fore [If at least I may be thought worthy of such a Character!] You are now to consider me, shall I say, as <HI>Executing the Will of the Dead?</HI> or, as <HI>Representing a Man of God, whom God hath taken.</HI> The <HI>Truths,</HI> which we shall now Incul∣cate, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l be such, as you are all along to think, <HI>These are the Things which a Saint now in Glory
<PB N="5" REF="000828_0005_0FAB403EEB4B9A58"/>
would have to be Inculcated.</HI> And when we have briefly set those <HI>Truths</HI> before you, we will de∣scribe a little that <HI>Excellent Saint,</HI> as from whom you have them Recommended: We will de∣scribe him chiefly, with <HI>Strokes</HI> fetch'd from his own <HI>Diaries,</HI> out of which, in the little Time I have had since his Death, I have collected a few <HI>Remarkables.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Psalmist,</HI> the Illustrious <HI>David,</HI> now, as we may judge, drew near unto his End: and we may say of the <HI>Psalm</HI> here composed by him, <HI>These are among the last words of David, the man who was Raised up on High.</HI> The <HI>Sighs</HI> of the Psalmist here collected, seem to have been occasion'd, by the <HI>Sufferings,</HI> which he under∣went, when his own Subjects, took up Arms a∣gainst him. Nevertheless, as our Psalter is all over, <HI>The Book of the Messiah,</HI> so this particular Hymn in it, is contrived Elegantly to point out, the <HI>Sufferings</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ unto us. In the Text now before us, the Psalmist appre∣hending himself in danger of <HI>Death,</HI> does the Great work of a <HI>Dying man</HI>: Which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>To Com∣mit a Surviving Spirit, into the Hand of God.</HI> But in doing this, he Entertains a special Consi∣deration of God, for his Encouragement in do∣ing it: This is, <HI>Thou hast Redeemed me, O Lord God of Truth.</HI> It is the <HI>Messiah,</HI> that hath <HI>Re∣deemed us</HI>; It is the <HI>Messiah,</HI> whose Name is <HI>The Truth; David</HI> upon a view o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Messiah,</HI> said, <HI>This is the man, who is the Lord God.</HI> Where∣fore,
<PB N="6" REF="000828_0006_0FAB403FA80CBB38"/>
In <HI>Committing our Spirits unto God,</HI> our Lord <HI>Christ</HI> is to be distinctly considered; and He was, no doubt, by <HI>David</HI> considered. The <HI>Power</HI> of God, is called, His <HI>Hand</HI>; The <HI>Wisdom</HI> of God, is called, His <HI>Hand</HI>: But above all, The <HI>Christ</HI> of God, who is, <HI>The Power of God, and the Wisdom of God,</HI> He is the <HI>Hand</HI> of God; By <HI>Him</HI> 'tis, that the God of Heaven doth, what He doth in the World: And <HI>He</HI> is, for that cause also Styled, <HI>The Arm of the Lord.</HI> It is therefore to the <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and <HI>Good∣ness</HI> of God, in <HI>Christ,</HI> that our Expiring <HI>Spirits</HI> are to be committed.</P>
<P>There was indeed a wonderful <HI>Time,</HI> when our Lord Jesus Christ Himself made a wonder∣ful <HI>Use</HI> of this very Text. We read in Luke 23.46. <HI>When Jesus had cried with a loud voice, He said, Father, into thy Hands I commend my Spi∣rit; and having said thus, He gave up the Ghost.</HI> Syrs, <HI>God uttered His voice,</HI> at this rate, <HI>and the Earth Trembled at it!</HI> And well it might, for ne∣ver did there such an amazing thing occurr upon the <HI>Earth</HI> before. Now, our Lord having said, <HI>Into thy Hands I commend my Spirit,</HI> stop'd at those words; for He was Himself the <HI>Redeemer, the Lord God of Truth.</HI> But as for <HI>us,</HI> we are to consider <HI>God,</HI> as in our <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> when we <HI>Commit our Spirits</HI> into His <HI>Hands.</HI> As <HI>Lu∣ther</HI> could say, <HI>Nolo Deum Absolutum,</HI> I Tremble to have to do, with an <HI>Absolute God</HI>; that is to
<PB N="7" REF="000828_0007_0FAB4040697B6668"/>
say, <HI>a God with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut a Christ</HI>: So, we may all Tremble to T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ink of <HI>Committing our Spirits,</HI> into the <HI>Hands</HI> of God, any otherwise than as He is, <HI>in Christ Reconciling the World unto Himself.</HI> We are truly told, in Heb. 10 31. <HI>It is a Fearful Thing to fall into the Hands of the Living God.</HI> Our <HI>Spirits</HI> are by Sin become obnoxious to the <HI>Fearful</HI> Wrath of God; and, wo to us, if our <HI>Spirits</HI> fall into His <HI>Hands,</HI> not having His <HI>Wrath</HI> Appeased! Syrs, We <HI>Commit</HI> Bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs and Thorns, and wretched Stubble to Infinite Flames, if we <HI>Commit our Spirits</HI> into the <HI>Hands</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> not in a <HI>Christ,</HI> become our Friend. We deliver up our <HI>Spirits,</HI> unto a <HI>Devouring Fire,</HI> and unto <HI>E∣verlasting Burnings,</HI> if we approach the <HI>Holy, Ho∣ly, Holy Lord God Almighty</HI> any otherwise than thro' the <HI>Immanuel,</HI> our <HI>Mediator.</HI> We are to <HI>Commit our Souls unto our Faithful Creator</HI>: But if He be not our <HI>Merciful Redeemer</HI> too, then, <HI>He that made us will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot have mercy on us.</HI> When <HI>Hezekiah</HI> was, as he thought, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying, he <HI>Turn'd his Face to the Wall</HI>: I suppose it was, to that side of the <HI>Upper Chamber,</HI> the <HI>Pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Chamber,</HI> where he Lay, that had <HI>Gods Window</HI> in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the <HI>Window</HI> that opened it sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> towards the Ark in the Temple. When we <HI>Commit our Spirits</HI> into the Hand of God, we are to <HI>Turn</HI> our <HI>Face</HI> to∣wards that <HI>Ark</HI> of God, our Lord Jesus Christ▪ We have this matter well directed by the words of the Dying Martyr <HI>St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phen</HI>; in Acts 7.59.
<PB N="8" REF="000828_0008_0FAB4041289728B8"/>
He said, <HI>Lord Jesus, Recive my Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>And now, there is a weighty CASE, that lies before us;</P>
<P>After what manner should we commit our Spirits unto our Lord Jesus Christ, that so the Eternal Safety and Welfare of our Spirits, may be effectu∣ally provided for?</P>
<P>If our Faithful BAILY were now <HI>Alive,</HI> I do not know any one CASE, that he would more <HI>Livelily</HI> have discoursed among you: but I know, that he would have Discou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed on This, with a <HI>Soul</HI> full of Inexpressible Ago∣nies. He was a <HI>Man,</HI> who had, from a <HI>Child,</HI> been full of Sollicitous <HI>Cares</HI> about his own <HI>Soul</HI>; and from hence in part it was, that when he became a <HI>Preacher</HI> of the Gospel, he <HI>Preach'd</HI> nothing so much, as the <HI>Cares</HI> that all men should have, about the <HI>Conversion</HI> of their <HI>Souls,</HI> unto God, and the <HI>Sincerity</HI> of their <HI>Souls</HI> before Him. There were many Great Points of our <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> which he still treated with Shorter Tou∣ches, because his Thoughts were continually Swallow'd up, with the <HI>Vast Concern</HI> of not being <HI>Deceived,</HI> about the <HI>Marks</HI> of a Rege∣nerate and a Sanctifyed <HI>Soul,</HI> and <HI>Hopes</HI> of being <HI>found in Christ</HI> at a Dying Hour. Those two words, A SOUL, and ETERNITY, were <HI>Great Words</HI> unto him; and his very <HI>Soul</HI> was
<PB N="9" REF="000828_0009_0FAB4041E80237D0"/>
greatly, and alwayes under the Awe of them. Hence, The very <HI>Spirit</HI> of his Preaching, lay in the points, of <HI>Turning</HI> from Sin to God in Christ, and the <HI>Trial</HI> of our doing so, and the <HI>Peril</HI> of our not doing it. Wherefore, as far as alas, one of my <HI>sinful coldness</HI> in those dreadful points, can do it, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill set before you in a few minutes, what I app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ehend my Dead Friend would have to be spoken, upon these points, in relation to the CASE, that is now to be conside∣red.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> Let every <HI>mortal</HI> man be very sensible, that he hath an <HI>Immortal Spirit</HI> in him, and prize that <HI>Spirit</HI> exceedin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly. How shall we <HI>Commit</HI> a <HI>Spirit</HI> into the <HI>Hands</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, if this thing be not Rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ized unto us, <HI>That we have a Spirit, which will be ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ribly miserab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to all Eternity, if the Lord Jesus Christ look not after it!</HI></P>

God forbid, That there should be so much as one <HI>Epicurean Swine</HI> among us, dreaming, That <HI>man</HI> is nothing but a <HI>meer Lump of matter put into Motion.</HI> Shall a man dare to <HI>Think,</HI> that he has not a <HI>Rational Soul</HI> in him, which is of a very different Nature from his <HI>Body</HI>? Truly, his very <HI>Thinking</HI> is e∣nough to confute his monstrous <HI>Unreasonableness</HI>: Meer <HI>Body</HI> cannot <HI>Think</HI>; and I pray, of what Figure is a <HI>Rational Atom</HI>? The Oracles of God, have therefore assured us, That the <HI>Fathers</HI> of our <HI>Bodies,</HI> are not the <HI>Fathers</HI> of <HI>Spirits</HI>; No; these have another <HI>Father!</HI> And, That the <HI>Spi∣rits</HI> of men, may go from their <HI>Bodies</HI>; and be caught up to the <HI>Third Heaven</HI> too! Well; But when our <HI>Bodies</HI> Crumble &amp; Tumble before the Strokes of <HI>Death,</HI> are not our <HI>Spirits</HI> over∣whelmed in the Ruines of our <HI>Bodies,</HI> like <HI>Samp∣son,</HI> when the <HI>Philistean</HI> Temple fell upon him? No; They are <HI>Sparks of Immortality,</HI> that shall never be Extinguished; they must <HI>Live,</HI> and <HI>Move,</HI> and <HI>Think,</HI> until the very Heavens be no more.

If thou hast a <HI>Well wrought Soul</HI> within thee, God will <HI>Receive</HI> it, and Advance, and Improve it, in His House for ever. A <HI>Work</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> produced by the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> upon the <HI>Spirits</HI> of men, is a sure Token, of His purpose to bestow a <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Glory</HI> upon them, at their Departure from their <HI>Bodies.</HI> The primitive Martyrs were bidden, in 1 Pet. 4.19. To <HI>Commit the keeping of their Souls unto God, as unto a Faithful Creator.</HI> But it is pro∣bable, the <HI>New Creation</HI> Experienced by <HI>Renewed Soul,</HI> is especially therein referr'd unto. Has the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, made a <HI>New Creature</HI> of thy <HI>Spirit?</HI> This will be a Demonstration, that the Lord Jesus Christ, ha's already <HI>Received</HI> thy <HI>Spirit,</HI> and that, when thou dost again <HI>Commit</HI> thy <HI>Spirit</HI> unto Him, He will <HI>Receive</HI> it. When we do, in our last Actions, <HI>Commit</HI> a <HI>Spirit,</HI> into the <HI>Hand</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, what is it for? It is that He may put an <HI>upper Garment</HI> of <HI>Glory</HI> upon that <HI>Spirit.</HI> But He will demand, <HI>Where is the under Garment of Grace upon it?</HI> If thou art without that <HI>Garment,</HI> He will doom thy <HI>Spirit</HI> unto <HI>outer Darkness,</HI> that is to say, (for <HI>Outer Darkness</HI> was the Name of the <HI>Prison</HI> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong the <HI>Jews,</HI>) He will make a <HI>Perpetual Imprison∣ment,</HI> the porti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of thy Soul.

upon our <HI>Souls,</HI> That when at last, we go to <HI>Commit</HI> them into the Hand of the Lord, He shall <HI>Reject</HI> them, and say, <HI>No, I know them not; They are none of mine; They are the Workers of Ini∣quity</HI>! The more certainly to prevent this De∣solation, Let this one Comprehensive Duty of the <HI>New Creature,</HI> be often Renewed with you. <HI>Receive</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ into thy <HI>Soul,</HI> when He does <HI>Command</HI> it of thee, and the Lord Je∣sus Christ will <HI>Receive</HI> thy <HI>Soul</HI> into Heaven, when thou dost at last <HI>Commit</HI> it unto Him. As <HI>Jotham</HI> said, in Judg. 9.7. <HI>Hearken to me, that God may Hearken to you:</HI> Even <HI>This</HI> do I now say to <HI>you</HI>; and I carry it on to <HI>This</HI> Issue: Do you <HI>Hearken</HI> to the Lord Jesus Christ, when He bids you to <HI>Receive Him,</HI> and when you Pray Him to <HI>Receive you.</HI> He will then <HI>Hearken</HI> to you.

<P>How <HI>Humbly</HI> ought we to <HI>Commit our Spirits</HI> into the <HI>Hand</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ! With how much <HI>Loathing</HI> and <HI>Judging</HI> of our selves, and with what <HI>Shameful Reflections,</HI> on all our past Behaviours.

When we <HI>Lift up our Soul</HI> unto the Lord, Let it be in Terms like those, in Ezra 9.6. <HI>O my God, I am Ashamed, and blush to Lift up my Face to thee, my God</HI>! And therefore, what-ever <HI>Blessings</HI> we ex∣pect for our Souls, Let us with all possible Self-Abhorrence found our Expectations on the pure <HI>Mercy</HI> of God, in our Lord Jesus Christ. Most sweetly did our Dying <HI>Hooker,</HI> express the frame of <HI>Spirit,</HI> wherewith a <HI>Spirit,</HI> is to be <HI>Committed</HI> into the <HI>Hand</HI> of the Lord: When one that stood weeping by his Bed side, said unto him, <HI>Syr.

Labours,</HI> he replied, <HI>Brother, I am going to Receive Mercy!</HI> What shall I say? The Frame of <HI>Spirit,</HI> necessary in this Glorious Transaction, I cannot better paint out unto you, than by reciting the words, which I remember I once had, from an Eminent old Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, at my taking Leave of him: said he,
<Q>Sir, I am every Day expecting my <HI>Death</HI>; but I desire to Dy, like the <HI>Thief,</HI> crying to the <HI>Crucifyed Je∣sus</HI> for <HI>mercy.</HI> I am Nothing, I have Nothing, I can Do Nothing, except what is <HI>Unworthy</HI>▪ My <HI>Eye,</HI> &amp; <HI>Hope,</HI> and <HI>Faith,</HI> is to <HI>Christ on His Cross.</HI> I bring an <HI>Unworthiness,</HI> like that of the poo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Dying <HI>Thief</HI> unto Him, and have no more to plead than <HI>he.</HI> Like the poor <HI>Thief, Crucified with Him,</HI> I am wai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to be Received, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Infinite <HI>Grace</HI> of my Lord, into His <HI>King∣dom.</HI> And, pray tell me, Did not Aged <HI>Paul</HI> mean something of This, when he said, <HI>I am Crucified with Christ?</HI></Q></P>
<P>Syrs, This is the <HI>Frame,</HI> wherewith we are to do, what we do. But then, How <HI>Willingly,</HI> How <HI>Chearfully</HI>! God forbid, That we should <HI>Commit</HI> our <HI>Spirits</HI> into His <HI>Hand,</HI> as only Drag'd, and Forc'd unto it by <HI>Unavoidable Death.</HI> Our Dy∣ing Lord said, <HI>Father, Into thy Hands I commend my Spirit.</HI> When God calls for our <HI>Spirit,</HI> we are to think, <HI>'Tis my Father that calls for me; and shall not I go to my Father?</HI> It was a good Speech even of an Heathen, <HI>Bene Mori est Libenter Mo∣ri,</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="000828_0031_0FAB413AEB2CF698"/>
one Thing in <HI>Well Dying,</HI> is to <HI>Dy willingly.</HI> 'Tis a dismal Thing, for the <HI>Spirit</HI> of a man to be <HI>Torn</HI> from him, and be pull'd away with Roa∣ring Reluctances, with Horrid Convulsions. Where would be the sense of it, if a Dying man should say, <HI>Lord, Into thy Hand I commit my Spirit, but if I could have my choice, my Spirit should never come there!</HI> When we perceive that Call from our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Go up and Dy</HI>! Let us <HI>Freely</HI> Surrender our <HI>Spirits,</HI> unto our Great Lord, and, <HI>Go up and Dy:</HI> He is the <HI>Lord of our Lives. Freely,</HI> did I say? Yea, and <HI>Gladly</HI> too. When we have aright <HI>Committed</HI> our <HI>Spi∣rits</HI> into the <HI>Hand</HI> of the Lord, then take up that conclusion, in Psal. 49.15. <HI>God will Receive my Soul.</HI> And <HI>then,</HI> Let us wonderfully comfort our selves, in the Thoughts of that <HI>Spiritual World</HI> which we are going into Think, <HI>I shall quickly Rest from Sin, and all Temptations, and all Afflictions, and all the cursed Effects of Sin, and all Annoyances of Ill Spirits for ever. I shall quickly be Lodg'd among the pure Spirits, that see God, and serve Him Day and Night in His Temple, and God shall wipe away all Tears from my Eyes. Yea, I shall quickly be with my Lord Jesus Christ, which is by far the best of all.</HI> Oh! <HI>Rejoyce in the Hope of this Glory of God!</HI> And let not your <HI>Joy</HI> be In∣terrupted, by any <HI>Fear,</HI> of what may become of your <HI>Friends,</HI> when you shall be <HI>Dead</HI> and <HI>Gone.</HI> The Lord that calls you to <HI>Commit</HI> your

The Excellent Mr. <HI>Heron,</HI> a Mi∣nister, that had a Family of many small Children in it, when he lay a Dying, his poor Wife said with Tears, <HI>Alas, what will become of all these Children?</HI> He presently, and pleasantly Replied; <HI>Never Fear, He that feeds the young Ravens, won't starve the young Herons</HI>! And it came to pass accordingly.</P>
<P>Syrs, Thus are you to <HI>Commit</HI> your <HI>Spirits</HI> in∣to the <HI>Hands</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>My Reverend BAILY did so; and it is as from <HI>Him,</HI> that I do this Day, be speak your do∣ing like him; yea, Not from Him only, but from the Lord Jesus Christ, the God▪ <HI>whose he was, and whom he Served.</HI> If you would more particularly be told, after what manner, he did <HI>Commit</HI> his <HI>own Spirit</HI> into the <HI>Hands</HI> of the Lord, I can faithfully Recite you his <HI>own Account</HI> of the Transaction.

God; Desiring to give up my self unto God in Christ wholly, and to be His in Soul and Bo∣dy. The particulars I omit. I hope, God in Christ, will Accept of me, and enable me by His Spirit to keep Touch with Him: for I owned my self wholly <HI>Unworthy</HI> to Enter into Covenant, and also <HI>Unable</HI> to keep it; but Je∣sus Christ is both Worthy and Able.</Q></P>
<P>'Tis from one who <HI>thus</HI> did it, that you are now call'd upon to <HI>Do Likewise.</HI></P>
<P>When you see the <HI>Coffin</HI> of this <HI>Man of God,</HI> anon carried along the Streets, imagine it a mournful <HI>Pulpit,</HI> from whence, <HI>Being Dead he yet speaks</HI> thus unto you; <HI>Whatever you do, Commit your perishing Souls into the Hands of the Lord Je∣sus Christ, as you have been Advised.</HI></P>
<P>That these Admonitions may have the more of <HI>Emphasis,</HI> a short Account of this Worthy man must now be given you.</P>
<P>He was Born, on <HI>Febr.</HI> 24. 1643. near <HI>Black∣bourn</HI> in <HI>Lancashire</HI>; of a very pious Mother, who even before he was Born, often, as <HI>Hannah</HI> her <HI>Samuel,</HI> Dedicated him unto the Service of the Lord.</P>
<P>Of this his <HI>Birth day,</HI> in the Return of every Year, he still took much Notice in his <HI>Diaries</HI>: and made his humble and useful Reflections thereupon.</P>
<P>Once particularly, I find him thus Entertain∣ing it.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="000828_0034_0FAB413D773FD838"/>
<Q>This is my <HI>Birth day,</HI> I am ready to say of it, as <HI>Job</HI> doth of his: but I forbear any unad∣vised words about it: only, I have done <HI>Little</HI> for God, and <HI>much</HI> against Him; for which I am sorry.</Q></P>
<P>When this Day, last arrived unto him, he thus wrote upon it.</P>
<P><Q>I may say with a Great Sigh, <HI>This was my Birth day!</HI> O how little Good have I done all this while! O what Reason have I to stand amazed at the Riches of Gods Forbearance! Much may happen this year: <HI>Lord, Carry me through it</HI>!</Q></P>
<P><HI>From a Child he did know the Holy Scriptures,</HI> yea, <HI>From a Child</HI> he was <HI>wise unto Salvation.</HI> In his very Childhood, he discovered the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> upon his young Heart; and <HI>Prayer to God</HI> was one of his Early Exercises.</P>
<P>There was one very Remarkable Effect of it. His <HI>Father,</HI> was a man of a very Licentious Conversation; a Gamester, a Dancer, a very Lewd Company-keeper. The <HI>Mother</HI> of this Elect Vessel, one day took him, while he was yet a <HI>Child,</HI> and calling the Family together, made him to <HI>Pray</HI> with them. His <HI>Father</HI> co∣ming to unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stand, at what a rate, the Child had pray'd with his Family, it smote the Soul of him, with a great Conviction, and prov'd the Beginning of his Conversion unto God. God lest not off working on his Heart, until
<PB N="35" REF="000828_0035_0FAB413DEBDEE948"/>
he proved one of the most <HI>Eminent Christians</HI> in all that Neighbourhood. So he <HI>Lived</HI>; so he <HI>Dyed</HI>; A man of more than ordinary Piety. And it was his manner sometimes to Retire unto those very places, of his former Lewdnesses, where, having this his Little Son in his Compa∣ny, he would pour out Floods of Tears, in Re∣penting <HI>Prayers</HI> before the Lord.</P>
<P>This Hopeful Youth, having been Educated in Grammar-Learning, under a worthy Schoolmaster, one Mr. <HI>Sage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>▪ and in further Learning, under the Famous D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Harrison,</HI> at Length, about the Age of Twenty Two, he Entred on the Pub∣lick Employment of Preaching the Gospel. In so doing, he was not one of those, of whom even the Great Papist <HI>Bellarmine</HI> complains, <HI>Qui non valde Solliciti esse solent, an ea qua par est pre∣paratione accedant, cum Finis eorum magis sit cibus Corporis, quam Animae.</HI> He began, at <HI>Chester</HI>; but afterwards went over to <HI>Ireland,</HI> where his Labours were so frequent, and fervent, that they gave those wounds unto his Health, which could never be Recovered. About Fourteen years of his Time, in <HI>Ireland,</HI> he spent at <HI>Lim∣rick,</HI> and saw so many <HI>Seals</HI> of his Ministry, in that Countrey, that he seem'd rather to Fish with a <HI>Net,</HI> than with an <HI>Hook,</HI> for the King∣dom of God. I am not willing to Relate, How <HI>Grievously,</HI> and yet, how <HI>Patiently</HI> he Suffered Long and Hard <HI>Imprisonments,</HI> from those men,

<P>And yet, for the Admonition of <HI>Our</HI> Inexcu∣sable <HI>Young Men, [The Sin of the Young men is very Great before the Lord</HI>! above that of those, who have been brought up, as many very Godly Christians have, in those ways of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> for a Secession from which, this Coun∣trey was first planted:] Who notwithstanding their Descent from Fathers and Grandfathers, that were great Sufferers, for their <HI>Non Conformi∣ty</HI> to an <HI>Uninstituted Worship of Christ,</HI> and not∣withstanding their Education in the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of what is <HI>Required,</HI> and what is <HI>Forbidden,</HI> in the <HI>Second Commandment,</HI> and notwithstanding their being urged by no Temptation, of <HI>Persecution,</HI> or being Tempted by any thing, but the <HI>Vanity</HI> of their own minds, do yet so <HI>Rebel against the Light,</HI> as to Turn <HI>Apostates</HI> from the <HI>First Princi∣ples of New England</HI>; it may be seasonable to Repeat so much of the History of this Worthy man, as a little further to Illustrate this Article.</P>
<P>He no sooner began to Preach the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, but his Fidelity to that
<PB N="37" REF="000828_0037_0FAB414017D2C910"/>
Gospel, was Tryed, by an <HI>Hard Imprisonment,</HI> which he underwent because his <HI>Conscience</HI> could not <HI>Conform</HI> to <HI>Humane Inventions,</HI> In the Sacred Service of Heaven. Yea, while he was yet a Young man, he often Travell'd far by <HI>Night</HI> in the <HI>Winter,</HI> as well as in the <HI>Summer,</HI> that so he might enjoy the Ordinances purely Administred, in the Meetings of the Faithful; and was laid up sometimes in <HI>Lancashire Gaol</HI> for being sound at those Meetings. When he was at <HI>Limrick,</HI> the Attendance which a Person of Great Quality, and his Lady, (who were nearly related unto the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> the Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI>) upon his Ministry, provoked the Bishop, to Complain unto the Lord Lieutenant. This Gentleman then profered unto Mr. <HI>Baily,</HI> that if he would conform, he would procure his being made Chaplain to the <HI>Duke,</HI> and having a <HI>Deanery</HI> immediately, and a <HI>Bishoprick</HI> upon the first Vacancy: But <HI>he</HI> Refused the profer. Al∣beit, another Eminent <HI>Non conformist Minister,</HI> not far from <HI>Limrick,</HI> a Godly, and an Able man, and one who had appeared much against <HI>Conformity</HI> at the first pressing thereof, did after∣wards Accept of the aforesaid <HI>Chaplain ship,</HI> &amp; by Degrees <HI>Conformed,</HI> and Arrived unto several <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aces of preferment: pretending, <HI>That he did it for the sake of Opportunities to Preach the Gospel.</HI> But it was Remarkable!

Seldom, if ever Able to Preach at all. Mr. <HI>Baily</HI> went on, in the Exercise of his Ministry, not pursuing any Factious Designs, but meerly the <HI>Conversion,</HI> of men to Christ, and Faith, and Ho∣liness, which the Devil counts the worst of all Designs. And now, although he were so <HI>Harm∣less</HI> and <HI>Blamless,</HI> in his whole Conversation, that he was alwayes much Beloved wherever he came, yet another long <HI>Imprisonment</HI> was inflict∣ed on him, while the <HI>Papists</HI> in the Neighbour∣hood, had all manner of Liberty and Counte∣nance. When he was before the Judges, he told them, <HI>If I had been drinking and gaming and carou∣sing at a Tavern with my Company, my Lords, I presume that would not have procured my being thus treated as an offender. Must Praying to God, and Preaching of Christ, with a Company of Christians, that are as Peaceable, and Inoffensive, and Serviceable to His Majesty and the Government as any of His Subjects, must this be greater Crime?</HI> The Re∣corder answered; <HI>We will have you to know, it is a greater Crime.</HI> While he was Imprisoned, his Church being divided into <HI>Seven Parts,</HI> visited him, one part a Day, so that Preaching to them, and Praying with them, every Day, he once in a Week Served them all. But this, in a Little while gave such Offence, that a Violent-Ob∣struction was given thereunto; and though his Flock, particularly, <HI>His dear Young men,</HI> (as he call'd them) did <HI>Pray without Ceasing,</HI> and not

without <HI>Fasting,</HI> for his Release; and Humble Applications were also made unto the Judges, at the Assizes for i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; yet no Rele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se could be gran∣ted him, without his giving Security, to Depart the Land, within a little Time then limited unto him. It was not long, before, a <HI>Wrath unto the uttermost</HI> came upon the City, which had thus persecuted this Faithful Minister of God; and that Person particularly, who had been the chief Instrument of his Persecution, was (as we have been told) within a while, upon other Accounts, himself run into <HI>Prison,</HI> where he Cryed ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with horror, of the Wrongs done by him to Mr. <HI>Baily,</HI> and then run<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Distracted, he dyed Miserably.

As this his Brother and Colleague notes in his Diary; <HI>He dyed well, which is a great Word; so sweetly, as I never saw the like before!</HI> But as for this Elder Brother, he was a man of Great <HI>Holi∣ness,</HI> and of so Tender a <HI>Conscience,</HI> that if he had been at any Time Innocently Cheerful, in the Company of his Friends, it cost him after∣wards abundance of sad <HI>Reflection,</HI> through Fear, lest e're he had been aware, he might have <HI>Grieved the Holy Spirit of Christ.</HI> A Savoury Book of his, about, <HI>The Chief End of Man,</HI> pub∣lished among us, ha's fully described unto us, that Savour of <HI>Spirit,</HI> which was in his <HI>dayly walk</HI> mentained.</P>

<P>From this Holy Temper it was, that when some kind presents were made unto him, he wrote in his <HI>Diary</HI> thereupon; <HI>I have my wages quickly; But Oh! that God may not put we off,
<PB N="41" REF="000828_0041_0FAB41426A6A5278"/>
with a Reward here! Oh! that God may be my Reward!</HI></P>
<P>We will more particularly Note, a few No∣tables, wherein the <HI>Holiness,</HI> which Irradiated him, will be described unto us.</P>
<P>We might begin, with Observing, That the <HI>Holy Word</HI> of God was very dear to him, as in∣deed it is to every <HI>Holy man.</HI> Hence, I find this passage in his <HI>Diary. Jan.</HI> 11.
<Q><HI>I finished the Reading of the Bible,</HI> in my Family (as for∣merly,) Oh! it's a <HI>Dear</HI> Book; it's alwayes <HI>New.</HI> In the <HI>Beginning</HI> of every Chapter, it's good to say, <HI>Lord, open my Eyes, that I may see Wonders out of thy Law</HI>; And when we shut it up, to say, <HI>I have seen an end of all perfection, but thy Law is exceeding Broad.</HI> Oh! now terrible are the <HI>Threatenings</HI>; how precious are the <HI>Promises</HI>; how serious are the <HI>Precepts</HI>; how deep are the <HI>Prophecies</HI> of this Book!</Q>
But we will pass on, to some further Observations.</P>
<P>What is <HI>Holiness,</HI> but a <HI>Dedication</HI> to the Lord Jesus Christ? This Holy man was often brea∣thing in himself, and pressing on others, that Great point, of <HI>Dedicating</HI> every thing to the Service of the Lord. Thus, in his <HI>Diary</HI> there frequently occur, such Strains as these.
<Q>Oh! that I may <HI>Glorify God,</HI> with all I <HI>am,</HI> or have; even with all the faculties of my <HI>Soul,</HI> all the members of my <HI>Body,</HI> and in all the <HI>Places</HI> and <HI>Relations</HI> that I Stand in, as <HI>Man, Master, Mini∣ster,
<PB N="42" REF="000828_0042_0FAB41432BAA96C0"/>
Husband, Kinsman, &amp; Neighbour.</HI> Oh! I stand in need both of a <HI>Justifying</HI> Christ, and a <HI>Sanctifying</HI> Christ. When shall I sensibly find a Christ, Swaying his Scepter in my Soul!</Q>
Thus, whatever <HI>House</HI> he came to Live in, it came under a <HI>Dedication</HI>; and once upon a Re∣move, he wrote this passage in his Diary.
<Q>I could not but Leave my <HI>Old House,</HI> with a Prayer in <HI>every Room</HI> of it, for pardoning mercy.</Q></P>
<P>But it was particularly Expressed, when one of his <HI>Children</HI> was to be <HI>Baptised.</HI> He thus wrote upon it.
<Q>I spent some Time, in Offer∣ing up my self, and my <HI>Child</HI> unto the Lord, and in taking hold of the <HI>Covenant</HI> for my self and him. It is Actually to be done to mor∣row, [in Baptism.] I prayed hard this day, all this day, that I might be able in much Faith, and Love, and New-Covenant-Obedience, to do it to morrow. It is not <HI>Easy,</HI> tho' <HI>Common,</HI> to offer a Child unto God in <HI>Baptism.</HI> Oh! that's a sweet word, <HI>I will be a God to Thee, and thy Seed after thee.</HI> No marvel <HI>Abraham</HI> fell on his Face at the hearing of it!</Q></P>
<P>Hence, when he parted with the greatest En∣joyment he had in this World, he thus wrote upon it, in his Diary;</P>
<P><Q>If I can but Exchange <HI>Outward Comforts</HI> for <HI>Inward Graces,</HI> 'tis well enough: Oh! for an Heart to <HI>Glorify God in the Fire</HI>!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="000828_0043_0FAB4143EC273518"/>From this <HI>Holiness,</HI> proceeded that <HI>Watchfulness,</HI> which Discovered a singular <HI>Fear of God,</HI> in his whole Conversation. I find him Entring in his <HI>Diary,</HI> such passages as these.</P>
<P>At one Time.</P>
<P><Q>I did not watch my <HI>Tongue</HI> so as I ought; which cost me much Trouble afterwards, and made me walk Heavily. It's a <HI>mad Thing</HI> to <HI>Sin!</HI></Q></P>
<P>At another Time.</P>
<P><Q>I spoke Two <HI>unadvised words</HI> to day. Tho' there was no great Harm in them, yet I was Rebuked by my Conscience for them. Let the Lord Forgive them; and for the future, set a watch before the <HI>Door of my Lips.</HI> Let my <HI>Thoughts and words be acceptable in thy sight,</HI> O Lord.</Q></P>
<P>At another Time.</P>
<P><Q>That's a serious word, methinks, in Eph. 5.30. I have <HI>Grieved</HI> the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> by my <HI>Un∣edifying Communication.</HI> Oh! that in speaking, I might <HI>Administer Grace to the Hearer!</HI> Oh! that <HI>Honey</HI> and <HI>Milk</HI> were under my Tongue continually.</Q></P>
<P>At another Time.</P>
<P><Q>I was too forgetful of God, and exceeding in <HI>Tobacco.</HI> The Lord pardon that, and all o∣ther Sins, and heal this Nature, and humble this Heart.</Q>
At another Time.</P>
<P><Q>This Day I have been more chearful, than I
<PB N="44" REF="000828_0044_0FAB4144AA4AC840"/>
have been, of a Long Time. It hath afflicted me since, fearing it was not suitable. Oh! I ought to walk in the midst of my House, in a perfect way. I ought every day to be wri∣ting Copies; and to Leave a <HI>Stock</HI> behind me, that others may trade for God withal, when I am Dead.</Q>
And, Behold, you see this Day, that he did so.</P>
<P>And as <HI>Holy</HI> men, use to be full of Hearty Prayers, and Wishes, for the Good of other men, thus this <HI>Holy</HI> man, has fill'd many places in his <HI>Diaries,</HI> with his Prayers for the Welfare of those, with whom he was concerned; from whence we may gather how full his Heart was of Blessings for his Neighbours.</P>
<P>Once particularly I find him thus Writing.</P>
<P><Q>I desired to know of Dr. <HI>O.</HI> what I was in∣debted to him, for those many Rich Things I have had from him: he told me, <HI>Nothing</HI>; [which was a great Favour!] only desired my <HI>Prayers</HI> for him. Oh! that I could <HI>Pray!</HI> Whenever I can <HI>Pray,</HI> I would heartily say to God in the Name of Christ, for him, <HI>The Lord bless him indeed! Let thy Hand be with him, and keep him from all Evil, that it may not Grieve him.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Moreover, It was not only among the Great <HI>Signs,</HI> but also among the Great <HI>Means,</HI> of his <HI>Holiness,</HI> that he was very sollicitous, as well in his <HI>Preparation</HI> for the <HI>Table of the Lord,</HI> as in
<PB N="45" REF="000828_0045_0FAB41456AB770A8"/>
his <HI>Observation,</HI> of what <HI>Communion</HI> he Enjoyed with the Lord Jesus Christ, at His Table.</P>
<P>His <HI>Diary</HI> abounds with passages of this Im∣portance; the Expressions of a <HI>Careful Soul.</HI></P>
<P>The Last Time of his being at the Lords-Ta∣ble, he wrote the Ensuing Passages.</P>
<P><Q>I was Encouraged to carry my Late Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Frame to the <HI>Cross</HI> of Christ, and to Bewayl there, my late <HI>Prayerlesness,</HI> and <HI>Unthankfulness.</HI> Of Late, it hath Troubled me, to think, how little I have Admired Christ, for bringing me out of some late plunges of Temptation. I now come to Him, for Two Things; name∣ly, for <HI>Pardon</HI>; and also for Double <HI>Power</HI>; both to Receive Him, and to shew forth His Praises.</Q></P>
<P>Let me add; Sometimes, as he was Able, he would set a part <HI>Half</HI> a day, for Extraordinary <HI>Prayers</HI>: He still did so, when there were any <HI>Extraordinary Cares</HI> upon him. Thus he Records in his <HI>Diaries.</HI></P>
<P>At one Time.</P>
<P><Q>Being of late in so ill a Frame, I spent some Time, to seek the Fair Face of Jesus Christ; and I did, on purpose, Address my self to Him, who is the most Admirable Saviour. I left my self with Him; my Mind, Heart, Mouth; especially my <HI>Conscience.</HI> Oh! how many Wonders are to be wrought in me! I know, the Loving, and wonder-working <HI>Jesus</HI> can do them all.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="000828_0046_0FAB41462BAE7AD8"/>At another Time.</P>
<P><Q>I spent some Time alone in Prayer, from 8 to 3. I was much tired. Oh! that I might wait for Returns, and never more turn to Folly. I can't tell how God should Admit me near Him, considering how I have grieved His Spirit. Having Pray'd in the Morning in the Family, I Retired; and first Sought at large unto God for Help to go through the day: especially begging <HI>Repentance,</HI> and not only so, but <HI>Faith</HI>; That I might not rest in the <HI>bare work</HI>; That <HI>Satan</HI> might get no Ad∣vantage after it; That I might have Reason to desire more such dayes. Then after a little Meditati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and Breathing, I went to Prayer again, only to <HI>Confess</HI> my <HI>Sin</HI> before God, and to set my Soul as before the Lord; Labouring to Judge and Loath my self, for all my Sin, from first to last. God helped a little; but Oh! that my Heart was broken in pieces, and Hum∣bled to the Dust. After a little more Medita∣tion, I went to Prayer, in way of <HI>Petition,</HI> and that at large. Oh! Lord, hear me, and give me the <HI>Wisdom</HI> that I want. I hope God will hear, pitty, pardon, and help me. After a little more Meditation, I fell to <HI>Praise</HI> &amp; <HI>Bless</HI> God for my Mercies, by Sea and Land; but was somewhat short in this part, for which I am sorry. At last, I Concluded all, in Pray∣ing for the Church of God in general, for
<PB N="47" REF="000828_0047_0FAB4146EC649020"/>
<HI>London, Lancashire,</HI> and <HI>Limrick</HI>; and for <HI>New-England</HI> also. Here I brought all my Relati∣ons to the Lord. Oh, Lord, Accept of me, and my poor Services in Christ. Oh! that I may Watch afterward, and never more be sensual, unbelieving, <HI>Proud,</HI> nor Hypocriti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l Lord, say, <HI>Amen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And that <HI>Praises,</HI> as well as <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers</HI> might not be forgotten with him, I find him once parti∣cularly in his <HI>Diary,</HI> thus Expressing himself.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 15. 1691.</P>
<P><Q>I Resolved, through the Grace and Strength of Jesus Christ, even in the midst of all my Sorrows and Sinkings, despairings and distracti∣ons, to keep as much of this Day, as I could, in THANKSGIVING; which I did; but could not go thorow with It▪ through bodily Faintness. I spent Five Hours somewhat Comfortably; but after that I flagged. I Re∣solved to do Three Things. First, To spend some Time in Praising God for His <HI>Excellencies.</HI> God was with me, I hope, in that part of it, and I spent my self so much therein, that I was Disabled for the Rest. To help it forward God brought to hand Mr. <HI>Burroughs,</HI> of the <HI>Nature of God</HI>; I bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s God for it. After that, I went to Praye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Labouring to Exalt God; (It was a Good Time!) After that I Sang the 148<HI>th.</HI> Psalm▪ Secondly, After that, I set my self to bless God, for His <HI>Benefits</HI> and
<PB N="48" REF="000828_0048_0FAB4147AC36EC88"/>
<HI>Kindnesses</HI> to me. But being Spent, I did not much; only going to Pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, I made mention of some Mercies; such as these; <HI>viz.</HI> for <HI>Christ</HI>; His <HI>Covenant</HI> of Grace; and the <HI>Promises</HI> of it, (some of which, were particularly mentioned and pressed:) also my <HI>Education</HI>; my mani∣fold preservations by Land &amp; Sea; (especially that in <HI>Ips<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich Bay</HI>:) and manifold tedious <HI>Sicknesses</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce; For the long Day of Gods <HI>Pa∣tience,</HI> notwithstanding many Sins: For my Comfortable <HI>Provisions</HI> all along; For preser∣ving His <HI>Great Name,</HI> that I have in nothing openly Dishonoured it; For my <HI>Success</HI> and <HI>Acceptance</HI> in my work; For my dear <HI>Wife,</HI> that I had her so long; and that my <HI>Brother,</HI> and my dear <HI>Wife,</HI> dyed both of them <HI>Glorify∣ing</HI> of God: They are in <HI>Heaven,</HI> and I am out of <HI>Hell</HI>! That I have hitherto been kept from Distracti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and Despair, and kept to my <HI>Work:</HI> Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I have any <HI>Friends</HI> (in this strange Land,) and any in my <HI>Family</HI> to mind me, and tend me: That I have Work here, and Opportunities of Service: For my sore <HI>Crosses</HI> and <HI>Losses</HI> of Late, Afflictions and Temp∣tations, hoping they may work for Good▪ <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dly,</HI> To Conclude all, with a chearful <HI>Ac∣cepting</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>Devoting</HI> my self to His Service: To Do for <HI>Him,</HI> that had done all this for <HI>me</HI>: Saying, If God would help me to Study, He should have all the Glory of it.</Q></P>
<P>Thus did he Walk with God.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="000828_0049_0FAB4155815B9860"/>His Ministry was very Acceptable to the peo∣ple, whose Good he most aimed at, wherever he came: Great Auditories usually Flocking thereunto, proclaimed it. But that he might not be <HI>Lifted up,</HI> it seemed meet unto the Wis∣dom of Heaven, to Humble him, with sore and long <HI>Temptations,</HI> often Recurring to <HI>Buffet</HI> him. In his <HI>Dayes,</HI> he saw many Disconsolate <HI>Hours</HI>; he was filled with Desponding Jealousies, Least <HI>after he had Preached unto others, he should be himself a Cast-away</HI>: and he often Entreated those, who saw the Distresses of his mind, <HI>That they would by no means take up any prejudice against the sweet and good wayes of Religion, from what they saw of his Disconsolate Uneasinesses.</HI></P>
<P>It may be, 'twill be profitable unto some Dis∣couraged minds, to understand how he expres∣sed himself on such occasions. In Sermons on those words, <HI>I am Oppressed, undertake for me,</HI> he much described it unto us. But in his <HI>Diaries</HI> 'twas thus: At one Time.</P>
<P><Q>I was almost in the <HI>Suburbs of</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all day; a meer <HI>Magor-missabib.</HI> I saw <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Sin</HI> full of Terror: I thought I never sought the Glory of God: Ah! What a matchless Wretch am I! Oh! that I could Love above all things, and seek the Glory of God, and Live content∣edly on Him alone! Oh! that I could see the Blood of Christ on my Soul, and at the bot∣tom of my profession. Oh! for a Sight of
<PB N="50" REF="000828_0050_0FAB415622EDBA08"/>
the Mystery and Majesty of the Grace and Love of Jesus Christ; so that all Excellencies might fall down before it!</Q></P>
<P>At another Time.</P>
<P><Q><HI>I am in a woful Frame; far from saying, with Dr.</HI> Avery, Here I Ly, not knowing what God will do with me, but tho' I thus Ly, God doth not Terrify me, either with my Sin, or with my Death, or with Himself.</Q></P>
<P>At another Time.</P>
<P><Q>If God should yet Save my Soul, and His Work in my Hand, it would be amazing There is a, <HI>May be</HI>! If these Inward Troubles hold, I shall be forced to lay down my work. O Lord, step in for my Relief! O the worth of the sense of Gods Love in Christ!</Q></P>

<P><Q>I am oppressed unto Death, and fill'd with the Angry Arrows of God: It ariseth not at present, from any <HI>particular Cause,</HI> but the sense of my woful Estate in <HI>general.</HI> Oh! that the Issue may yet be, <HI>peace,</HI> and that I may not fetch comfort unto my self, but by <HI>Faith in Jesus Christ.</HI></Q></P>
<P>At another Time.</P>
<P><Q>Oh! that Jesus Christ would undertake for me! If God marvellously prevent not, I shall lay down my work. O Lord, Appear. Oh! for one saving sight, of the Love, and Loveli∣ness of Jesus Christ. I wish I could say, as

my dear Tutor, Dr. <HI>Harrison</HI> said, <HI>That he could not Live a day, without a fresh manifestation of God, unto his Soul!</HI></Q></P>
<P>At another Time.</P>
<P><Q>The <HI>Eclipse</HI> of the <HI>Moon</HI> last Night, made me think, <HI>Oh! that I could mourn bitterly, who have Sinned my self into Darkness.</HI> How is the <HI>Earth</HI> Interposing! Lord, Remove it. Let the <HI>Sun of Righteousness</HI> in His Glory and Strength yet be seen by me!</Q></P>
<P>At another Time.</P>
<P><Q>I have much Reason to bless God, for Re∣buking of <HI>Satan.</HI> I have been many a Time ready to give up all, and lay down my Mini∣stry, thinking that God had utterly forsaken me, and hid Jesus Christ from me; which I would Justify Him in. But by the considera∣tion of the <HI>Brazen Serpent,</HI> I was somewhat Recovered.</Q></P>
<P>At another Time.</P>
<P><Q>I was now supported, by the Thoughts of a precious JESUS. I should for ever sink, but for Him! When I look Backward or Forward, Upward or Downward, I Dy, I Sink; but when I Look at the Sweet JESUS, I Live. I may Resolve with Dr. <HI>Preston</HI>; (O that I could!) saying, <HI>I have often Try'd God, and now I'l Trust Him.</HI> It's a Good Resolution; Lord, Help me to it!</Q> At another Time.</P>
<P><Q>I would gladly think, <HI>That God is my Father.</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="000828_0052_0FAB41576B7FE128"/>
And if so, Oh! what Glory is due to the Riches of <HI>Free Grace!</HI> Oh! how glorious i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Grace, and how will it shine through all Eternity! If ever I see my self <HI>Safe</HI> at Last, I must for ever cry out, <HI>I am wonderfully Saved!</HI></Q></P>
<P>In fine. One Thing that much Reliev'd him in his Internal Troubles, was, what he had Oc∣casion (thus) to write in his <HI>Diary,</HI> a little be∣fore his End.</P>
<P><Q>I do more see, into the Great Mystery of our <HI>Justification</HI> by <HI>Faith,</HI> meerly of <HI>Grace.</HI> There is no Respect in it, unto <HI>This,</HI> or <HI>That</HI>; but Jesus Christ having wrought out a <HI>Redemption</HI> for us, and by His Active and Passive Obedi∣ence procured a Sufficient <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and making a <HI>Tender</HI> of it in the Gospel, it becomes <HI>Mine,</HI> by my Accepting of it, and Relying on it alone, for Salvation. And shall I not Ac∣cept of it?
God forbid!</Q></P>
<P><Q>I see (saith he) there are Two Things, wherein I can't easily Exceed: <HI>viz.</HI> In Ascrib∣ing to the <HI>Grace</HI> of God, the <HI>Freeness</HI> and <HI>Rich∣ness</HI> of it, in mans Salvation; And in Ascribing to the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of Christ in mans <HI>Justification.</HI></Q></P>
<P>At Length, Dismal <HI>Pains</HI> of the <HI>Gout,</HI> with a Complication of other Maladies, confined him, for a Quarter of a Year together, Under the <HI>Pains</HI> of his Confinement, he took an Extraor∣dinary Contentment in the <HI>Fifty Third Chapter</HI> of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> which represents the <HI>Sorrows</HI> of our Lord
<PB N="53" REF="000828_0053_0FAB41582B253A20"/>
Jesus Christ, whereby all ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> are Sancti∣fied: And he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> ever those words of our Saviour, else-where occurring, <HI>They pierced my Hands and my Feet.</HI> When the Remainders of his Flock, which waited on him to <HI>New England,</HI> Visited him, his usual and Solemn Charge unto them was, <HI>I Charge you, That I find you all safe at last</HI>! My Brethren, God make the charge of your Dead Pastor abide upon you. For some Time in his last Sickness, his Heavenly Soul was harrassed, with terrible Discouragements: Under all of which, it was yet a common Expression with him, <HI>The Master hath done all things Well</HI>! But at <HI>last,</HI> he arrived unto a Blessed Satisfacti∣on, That the Lord Jesus Christ, had made his <HI>Peace</HI> in Heaven, and that he was going into Eternal <HI>Peace.</HI> Yea, at the <HI>worst,</HI> he would say, <HI>That his Fear was not so much about the End of all, as about what he might meet withal in the way to that End.</HI> He had begun to prepare a Sermon for our <HI>South Church,</HI> upon those words, <HI>Who is this that comes up from the Wilderness, Leaning on her Beloved?</HI> And he now spoke of it, as Expres∣sing his own Condition; <HI>Thus am I going</HI> (said he) <HI>out of the Wilderness of all my Temptations, Leaning on my Blessed Jesus</HI>! When his Affectio∣nate Friends, were weeping about him, he be∣stow'd this Rebuke upon them, <HI>Away with your Idols! Away with your Idols</HI>! It was not very long before he fell Sick, that he wrote this pas∣sage
<PB N="54" REF="000828_0054_0FAB4158EAD35930"/>
in his <HI>Diary.</HI>
<Q>I was affected, with what I Read, of Mr. <HI>Shewel</HI> of <HI>Coventry,</HI> who dyed in the Pulpit. <HI>Lord, Let no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me Dy meanly, but in Dying bring much</HI> Glory <HI>to Thee.</HI></Q>
And now, it shall be so! At last, just as he was going to Expire, he seem'd as if he had some Extraor∣dinary Apprehensions, of the <HI>Glory,</HI> in which our Lord Jesus Christ is above Enthroned: He Strove to Speak unto his Vertuous Consort, and anon Spoke thus much, <HI>Oh! What shall I say? He is altogether Lovely!</HI> His Worthy Sister-in-Law, then coming to him, he said, <HI>Oh! All our Praises of Him here, are Poor and Low Things!</HI> and then added, <HI>His Glorious Angels are come for me</HI>! Upon the saying whereof he Closed his own Eyes, about the Time when he still opened his Bible for his Publick Labours: On the Lords Day, about Three in the Afternoon; and he never opened them any more.</P>
<P>This was he, whom you are now going to <HI>Bury</HI>; but I pray you, <HI>Bury</HI> not with him, all the Holy Counsils, and Warnings, that we have heard from him; <HI>Remember how you have Receiv∣ed and Heard.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He</HI> was one, who took much Notice of what was from the Oracles of God, Spoken to him, in the <HI>Sermons</HI> of other men. He ha's much re∣plenished his <HI>Diaries,</HI> with Remarks of this Im∣portance; <HI>I heard a good Word to Day</HI>! And he would often decline going to <HI>Feasts,</HI> whereto his
<PB N="55" REF="000828_0055_0FAB4159AC149390"/>
Friends invited him, that he might go to <HI>Private Meetings</HI> in some other parts of the Town, where he might at the same Time <HI>Feast</HI> on the word of God. Thus, more particularly.</P>
<P>At one Time.</P>
<P><Q>I heard a very Good Word. <HI>Are ye not Car∣nal</HI>? Ah, Lord, I am <HI>Carnal.</HI> The Lord give me His <HI>Spirit,</HI> to make me <HI>Spiritual</HI>! I was in many Things justly Reproved: Let me take it, and be wrought into the <HI>Likeness</HI> of this Good Word.</Q>
At another Time.</P>
<P><Q>To day I heard a most precious Word, with which I was much Edified and Refreshed, <HI>viz. Christ is All.</HI> Oh! that I might never forget it! Oh! that it might be written upon the Table of my Heart! Let my Soul feed upon it for∣ever. It was very Seasonable. Though it was a Day most Intolerably <HI>Cold</HI>; so <HI>Cold,</HI> that there was little writing it; yet it heartily <HI>Warmed</HI> me, I needed a <HI>Christ:</HI> Oh! that I could get Him, and keep Him forever!

<P>What I say upon it, is; <HI>Imitate</HI> him, in a point so <HI>Imitable.</HI> This <HI>Preacher</HI> is well worthy to be Imitated, as he was an <HI>Hearer.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="000828_0056_0FAB415A6BF4B750"/>You can all testify, that he was none of those <HI>Cold Preachers,</HI> whereof one Complains, <HI>Verba vitae in quorundam Doctorum Labijs, quantum ad Virtutem, et Efficaciam Moriuntur: Adeo enim tepide, adeo re∣misse, verba Dei annunciant, ut Extinct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Labijs Eorum penitus videantur; unde Sicut ipsi Frigidi sunt, et Extincti, sic Frigidos et Extinctos relinquunt, et utinam non facerent, Auditores.</HI></P>
<P>For his <HI>Preaching,</HI> he particularly prescribed unto himself, according to a <HI>Memorandum,</HI> which I found thus Entred in his <HI>Diary.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Old Mr. <HI>Thomas Shepard,</HI> when on his Death∣bed, said unto the young Ministers about him, <HI>That their work was great, and called for great se∣riousness.</HI> For his own part, he told them Three Things. First, That the Studying of every Sermon, cost him <HI>Tears</HI>; he <HI>wept</HI> in the Studying of every Sermon. Secondly, Before he Preach'd any Sermon, he <HI>Got Good</HI> by it himself.

<P>To this his <HI>Preaching,</HI> when he saw God gave any Success, he would still, in his private pa∣pers, take as Thankful a Notice, as if great Riches had been heaped in upon him. And yet he would add, [such passages I sometimes find.]</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX. The Character of a Christian.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Act. XI.46.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The Disciples were called CHRISTIANS.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ECclesiastical History mentions this par∣ticular Disposition, in one of the Pri∣mitive <HI>Christians,</HI> and <HI>Confessors</HI>; That when the Sworn Enemies of <HI>Christianity,</HI> Examined him, <HI>What he was</HI>? he would still give them no other Answer, but this, <HI>I am a Christian:</HI> If they asked him, what Countrey-man he was, or, what Employment he had, or, who were his Friends, or, any other matter, his Answer to them still was no other than this, <HI>I am a Christian</HI>: Thus he still Answered, although he ran the hazard of his Life, by making such an Answer!</P>
<P>It is to be supposed, that <HI>Most,</HI> if not <HI>All,</HI> of the Persons, who Compose the Assembly, now together in this place, if they should be asked, <HI>What they are?</HI> would make that Answer, <HI>I am a Christian</HI>: And indeed there is no Danger; 'tis
<PB N="59" REF="000828_0059_0FAB415CAA986758"/>
a matter of some Credit, among us, in such an Answer. But then there is ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her Question, hence proper to be Considered: <HI>What is a CHRISTIAN?</HI> And it is to be feared, That very many, who wear that <HI>Worthy Name,</HI> can make, either but a sorry Answer to that Question, or such an Answer as must carry their own Confu∣tation, and Condemnation in it.</P>
<P>You are at this Time, to be Entertained with a Discourse on that Important Question. And we may fitly Introduce our Discourse, with some Enquiry into the <HI>first Original</HI> of that <HI>Name,</HI> CHRISTIANS; which Enquiry may Receive satisfaction, from the words now Read unto us.</P>
<P>The Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, was begun to be Preached unto the <HI>Gentiles: Anti∣och</HI> particularly was a City of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> where the Preaching of the Gospel was Crowned with a great Success. And at this <HI>Antioch</HI> it was, that the Name of CHRISTIANS, was first put upon the people, who <HI>Received the Love of the Truth</HI> of that Gospel. It had been pre∣dicted, as a thing to come to pass at the coming of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> in Mic. 4.5. <HI>We will walk in the Name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.</HI> And there now seems a partial compl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion of this prediction, in our having the Name of CHRISTIANS; for CHRIST, is the <HI>Name</HI> of <HI>the Lord our God.</HI></P>
<P>We have Two Things here before us, that seem Remarkable.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="000828_0060_0FAB415D6BA6F510"/>First, We have the <HI>Name,</HI> which was betimes fastned upon the <HI>Disciples</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ. This Blessed people, had hitherto cal∣led one another, by the Name of <HI>Disciples,</HI> be∣cause of their subjection to the Instruction, and Protection, and Government, of the Lord Jesus Christ. Beca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of their <HI>Faith</HI> also, they call'd one another <HI>Believers</HI>; Because of their <HI>Love,</HI> they call'd one another <HI>Brethren</HI>; and they cal∣led one another <HI>Saints,</HI> because of their <HI>Ho∣liness</HI> unto the Lord. Their Enemies all this while, called them <HI>Nazarenes,</HI> and <HI>Galilaeans,</HI> because our Lord was Conceived, and had Re∣sided at <HI>Nazareth</HI> in <HI>Galilee</HI>; and His Apostles were mostly of that Countrey. But now, the Honourable Name of CHRISTIANS, became <HI>That,</HI> by which they were afterwards most of all distinguished.</P>
<P>Secondly, We have the <HI>Place,</HI> where this Ve∣nerable Name first of all began. This was at <HI>Antioch.</HI> There were, it may be, no fewer than Seven and Twenty Cities of <HI>Asia,</HI> wearing the Denomination of <HI>Antioch</HI>: Which was occasio∣ned by two several <HI>Anti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chus</HI>'s, potent Princes, who founding, repa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing, and enlarging the se∣veral Cities, procured them to be thus from themselves denominated: or else their Favourites to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k this way of naming Cities from them to be Recommended unto their Favour. But the <HI>An∣tioch</HI> here mentioned, was undoubtedly That in
<PB N="61" REF="000828_0061_0FAB415E2AD83360"/>
<HI>Caelosyria,</HI> the <HI>Metropolis</HI> for the Trade of these Regions. It was called, <HI>Antioch the Great</HI>; Behold here, as <HI>Great</HI> a Thing, as any that ever made it so: A <HI>Church</HI> of CHRISTIANS, here first wearing so <HI>Great</HI> a Style. The Evangelist <HI>Luke,</HI> who writes the Story of this thing, was a <HI>Citi∣zen</HI> of <HI>Antioch</HI>: and behold, what a memora∣ble Note he Leaves, for the Everlasting Reputa∣tion of the Town, whereof he was a <HI>Citizen</HI>: the Style of CHRISTIANS, was never heard of, says he, till first at my Town of <HI>Antioch.</HI> It had been foretold unto the people of <HI>Christ; The Sons of them that Afflicted thee, shall come stoo∣ping unto Thee.</HI> See now that p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ophecy in a small part fulfilled! In that very City, which had been the <HI>Seat,</HI> and still bore the <HI>Name,</HI> of <HI>Antiochus,</HI> the most Bloody Tyrant, that ever <HI>Israel,</HI> the people of <HI>Christ</HI> had groaned under, that people are now multiplied; and obtain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an Appellation, which must be extended as far as any part of the Earth, which the Sun shines up∣on, and continued as long as the Sun &amp; Moon Endure in Heaven.</P>
<P>Two Things one would now Enquire.</P>
<P>First, Who it was that first gave the Name of CHRISTIANS, to the <HI>Disciples</HI> of our Lord? Of that I say, It is not probable, That this Name was imposed upon the <HI>Disciples,</HI> in a way of De∣rision, by their <HI>Persecutors:</HI> Their Persecutors would rather have contrived a more Derisory or
<PB N="62" REF="000828_0062_0FAB415EEA775298"/>
De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amatory Name for them, and have call'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em, as one saies, <HI>Crucifixians,</HI> or some like Term of Contempt. It is much more probable, That the <HI>Disciples</HI> Assumed this Name to themselves, by their own Election The Greek word, <HI>CHREMATISAI,</HI> here used, for <HI>Called,</HI> signifies, a <HI>Calling,</HI> with some very solemn and signal, and singular Circumstances. Yea, 'tis related by <HI>Johannes Antioche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s,</HI> that <HI>Evodus,</HI> the Minister of the Church at <HI>Antioch,</HI> at a <HI>Church Meeting</HI> a∣greed with them, to take this Name upon them. It should seem, that there was a special Directi∣on, from the Holy Spirit of <HI>Christ,</HI> unto them, for their doing of it.</P>
<P>Secondly. Why the Name of CHRISTIANS; A Title derived from no person in the Trinity, but the <HI>Second</HI>; and from no other Character of that Second Person, but <HI>This?</HI></P>
<P>Of That I say; 'Tis only the <HI>Second Person</HI> in the Trinity, which took our <HI>Nature</HI> upon Him. Our <HI>Name</HI> therefore is very fitly fetch'd from that Second Person. 'Tis only in CHRIST, and thro' CHRIST, that God becomes our God; and it is by CHRIST, that He does what∣ever is done for us. How Agreeably, are we called, <HI>Christians,</HI> to acknowledge this? As for the Name of JESUS, it signifies, <HI>A Saviour</HI>; Now none of us vain <HI>men,</HI> have any claim to a∣ny share with our Lord, in His being so. Since, There <HI>is no other Name under Heaven, given a∣mong
<PB N="63" REF="000828_0063_0FAB415FAC6CE8D8"/>
men, whereby we must be Saved,</HI> it is not fit that this <HI>Name</HI> should be put upon any <HI>among men under Heaven.</HI> They who have call'd them∣selves JESUITES, in the Last Age, are a <HI>pre∣sumptuous</HI> as well as a <HI>pernicious</HI> Generation. But the Name of CHRIST, signifies, <HI>Anointed.</HI> Now to something of This priviledge <HI>we</HI> also are Ad∣vanced: The Apostle saies, <HI>We have Received an Anointing:</HI> And the Psalmist says, We are <HI>Fel∣lows with our Lord in this, tho' He be Anointed a∣bove us all.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus briefly dispatched these <HI>Two</HI> En∣quiries, there is a <HI>Third,</HI> which remains, to be the Subject of our further, and most serious Meditations. Namely;</P>
<P><HI>What is a CHRISTIAN?</HI></P>
<P>Two <HI>Preliminaries</HI> are to be Considered.</P>
<P>First; Many a man is not <HI>Really</HI> a <HI>Christian,</HI> that yet is <HI>Visibly</HI> so. As the Scripture sayes, in Rom. 2.28. <HI>He is not a Jew, that is one outwardly</HI>: Thus we may say, <HI>He is not a Christian, that is no more than outwardly so.</HI> Tis t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, A mans being <HI>Visibly</HI> a <HI>Christian,</HI> is that which Entitles him to the External Priviledges of <HI>Christianity,</HI> in the Churches of God; <HI>Non Judicat Ecclesia de Oc∣cultis.</HI> But a man must be <HI>Really</HI> a <HI>Christian,</HI> if he would not perish among <HI>Infidels</HI> at the last.</P>
<P>Secondly; A man that is <HI>Really</HI> a <HI>Christian,</HI> may have many <HI>Ʋnchristian</HI> Disorders in his Heart &amp; Walk. Alas, my Friend▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is not <HI>Christianity,</HI> that is done by every <HI>Real Christian</HI>! He was a <HI>Real</HI> and a <HI>First-rate Christian,</HI> who said, in Rom. 7.22, 23. <HI>I Delight in the Law of God after the Inward man, but I see another
<PB N="64" REF="000828_0064_0FAB41606A4CB470"/>
Law in my Members.</HI> Thus it may be said of a Good man; <HI>He Delights in every Good Thing, so far as he is a Christian man: but you may see such a man do many Things, that are far from Christian.</HI></P>
<P>Prepared with these Two Consideration, Let us now pass on to Consider, What a <HI>Christian</HI> is? What are the points of <HI>Real Christianity,</HI> which every <HI>Christian,</HI> as far as he is a <HI>Christian,</HI> does come up unto.</P>
<P>Give your Attention, Sirs; Your Condition for Eternity, is going to be determined.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I▪</HI> A CHRISTIAN, is one, who Adores the Lord JESUS CHRIST, as very <HI>GOD,</HI> and who Accepts that Lord, as His <HI>own GOD.</HI> The man, who does not Look upon our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as more than a man, is no <HI>Christian.</HI> The Old <HI>Arians</HI> were but <HI>Pseudo Christians.</HI> A <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> sees that our Lord Jesus Christ is a man, but he sees this man to be personally Uni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed unto the <HI>Second Person</HI> in God. This is menti∣oned as the First, and Grand, Article of <HI>Chri∣stianitie,</HI> which is the <HI>Mystery of Godliness,</HI> in 1 Tim. 3.16. That our Lord Jesus Christ is no other than <HI>God manifest in the Flesh.</HI> A man may be a notable Preacher of <HI>Christ,</HI> and write whole Books, about, <HI>The Knowledge of Christ,</HI> and yet not be a <HI>Christian.</HI> Mighty Numbers of those <HI>Hereticks,</HI> which are called <HI>Socinians,</HI> do at this day cover the face of <HI>Christendome,</HI> as the <HI>Frogs</HI> did <HI>Egypt</HI> of old: They hold, that our Lord Jesus Christ, is God, not by <HI>Nature,</HI> but only by <HI>Office</HI>; and not from <HI>Eternity,</HI> but only
<PB N="65" REF="000828_0065_0FAB416A0C4F8510"/>
since His <HI>Resurrection.</HI> The <HI>Mahometans</HI> are as Good <HI>Christians,</HI> as these miserable <HI>Hereticks</HI>; for the <HI>Mahometans</HI> grant our Blessed <HI>Jesus,</HI> to be a Glorious <HI>Prophet</HI> of God. Yea, there are better <HI>Christians</HI> than these, among the <HI>Mahome∣tans</HI>; for there is a Potent Sect lately risen a∣mong the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> called, <HI>The Good Followers of the Messiah,</HI> who hold that our <HI>Christ</HI> is <HI>God, and the Redeemer of the World.</HI> No, A <HI>Christian,</HI> is one, who counts himself Robb'd, of all his <HI>Hope,</HI> and all his <HI>Joy,</HI> and all his <HI>Life,</HI> if the <HI>God-Head</HI> of his Lord Jesus Christ, should be questi∣oned. A <HI>Christian</HI> expects from his Lord, such a <HI>Righteousness</HI> as will Entitle him to Life, and such a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> as to Expiate all his Guilt, and such a <HI>Spirit,</HI> as will Sanctify him throughout, and at last Raise him out of the Dust, unto Heavenly and Eternal Glory. Now the Foun∣dation of all this Expectation in the Christian, is, <HI>My Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st is God as well as Man!</HI> When the A∣post<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ical Writings have called our Lord Jesus Christ, The <HI>True God,</HI> and, The <HI>Great God,</HI> and <HI>God over all</HI>; the <HI>Christian</HI> is one that Heartily Subscribes unto it. The <HI>Christian</HI> thinks of the Lord Jesus Christ, That this His Lord, <HI>Is every where,</HI> and, <HI>Knows every thing,</HI> and, That His Lord is, <HI>The Lord God Omnipotent,</HI> and, <HI>That all Things were made by Him,</HI> and, <HI>That He Upholds all Things.</HI></P>
<P>There were <HI>Christians</HI> in the Dayes of the
<PB N="66" REF="000828_0066_0FAB416A2B918C98"/>
<HI>Old Testament</HI>; All the Faithful People of the <HI>God of Abraham,</HI> were <HI>Christians,</HI> tho' that Name were not yet Formally put upon them. Now those old <HI>Christians,</HI> did Worship the <HI>Messiah</HI> as <HI>God: Joshua</HI> did so. <HI>Jacob</HI> was one of those old <HI>Christians</HI>; and he said of the <HI>Messiah, This is the God that fed me all my Life Long. Job</HI> was another of them; and he said, <HI>In my Flesh, I shall see God:</HI> From whence, even a Jewish Rabbi, who was no <HI>Christian,</HI> infers, <HI>The Word of God will take Flesh in a Woman on Earth. David</HI> was a <HI>Christian</HI>; and he said of the <HI>Anointed One,</HI> our <HI>Christ,</HI> in Psal. 45.7. <HI>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever. Isaiah</HI> was a <HI>Christian</HI>; and he said, of the <HI>Christ,</HI> who is <HI>the Child born; the Son given unto us,</HI> in Isa. 9.6. <HI>His Name shall be, God, The Mighty.</HI></P>
<P>Unless our Lord Jesus Christ, be unto a man, <HI>God</HI> as well as <HI>Man,</HI> and the very <HI>God,</HI> whose <HI>Name alone is JEHOVAH,</HI> That man cannot be a <HI>Christian.</HI> The <HI>Christian</HI> accounts our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>The God, which is, and which was, and which is to come</HI>; that is to say, The Eternal JEHOVAH. The <HI>Christians</HI> of the <HI>Old Testa∣ment,</HI> were of this Apprehension; and therefore, in multitudes of passages, concerning the Works of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> all over the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> the Name of JEHOVAH is Ascribed unto Him. [Thus in Zech. 12.10. Thus in Zeph. 3.9. Thus, in Jer. 33.16.] The <HI>Jews</HI> themselves are so
<PB N="67" REF="000828_0067_0FAB416AEB10F6A0"/>
se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sible of This, that tho' they Deny our <HI>Jesus</HI> to be the <HI>Messiah,</HI> yet several of their own Rabbi's, do confess, That when the Messiah comes, he shall be called, <HI>The Eternal JEHOVAH</HI>; and, that the <HI>Messiah,</HI> is intended when 'tis said, <HI>Je∣hovah shall build up Jerusalem.</HI> There was a <HI>man,</HI> whom the Jews did Stab with a <HI>Sword.</HI> But the Old <HI>Christians</HI> among the <HI>Jews,</HI> look'd upon that man, to be Assum'd by the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of God, into one person with Himself; Hence, they reckoned, the <HI>Messiah,</HI> to be the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of God; and as in Zech. 13.7. that <HI>Stab'd man,</HI> they saw, was a <HI>Fellow,</HI> an Aequal, unto <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the Lord of Hosts.</P>
<P>But when the <HI>Christian</HI> sees the Demonstration of this <HI>Mystery,</HI> That his Lord Jesus Christ, is very <HI>God,</HI> and by an ineffable Generation from all Eternity, <HI>The Son of God,</HI> he does there <HI>on,</HI> and there <HI>fore,</HI> make choice of this Lord, for his <HI>own God.</HI> The Language of the <HI>Christian,</HI> is that which <HI>Thomas</HI> used when he saw our <HI>Christ,</HI> af∣ter His <HI>Resurrection</HI> from the Dead, in Joh. 20.28. <HI>My Lord, and my God</HI>! That famous Roman Pagan Governour, <HI>Pliny,</HI> gave this Description of the <HI>Christians,</HI> in his Time, <HI>That they Sang Hymns unto one CHRIST, as unto a GOD.</HI> Sirs, If we are <HI>Christians,</HI> We offer up our Praises and our Prayers, unto our CHRIST, as our <HI>God</HI>; and as unto <HI>God,</HI> we devote our selves unto Him. It was usual with the ancient <HI>Idolaters,</HI> to <HI>Brand</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="000828_0068_0FAB416BAAC599A8"/>
themselves, in token of their Devotion to the <HI>Idols,</HI> whose <HI>Brands</HI> they wore, with such Cha∣racters, as are forbidden in <HI>Leviticus.</HI> With a Golden, or an Iron Stamp, they sometimes <HI>Branded</HI> themselves, with the <HI>Mark</HI> of their <HI>Idol</HI>; as a <HI>Thunderbolt</HI> was the <HI>Mark</HI> of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> an <HI>Helmet</HI> of <HI>Mars,</HI> an <HI>Ivy</HI> of <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chus.</HI> They some∣times <HI>Branded</HI> themselves, with the <HI>Name</HI> of their <HI>Idol</HI> at large; as <HI>Jupiter,</HI> or, <HI>Mercurius,</HI> and the like. And they some times <HI>Branded</HI> themselves, with the <HI>Number</HI> of his <HI>Name</HI>; that is, with o∣ther <HI>Letters</HI> privately agreed by the Fraternity, which together would amount unto the same <HI>Number,</HI> with the Known Letters of his <HI>Name.</HI> I will not Report what some zealous <HI>Christians</HI> in the Primitive Times, did in opposition to this <HI>Idolatry.</HI> But this I will say; Every <HI>Christian</HI> does <HI>brand</HI> himself, with a certain <HI>Stamp,</HI> in to∣ken, That CHRIST is the <HI>God,</HI> whom he devotes himself unto; Now, the Name of, A CHRISTI∣AN, is that <HI>Stamp</HI>: As long as he wears the Name of, A CHRISTIAN, he thinks, CHRIST is <HI>my God; I am to Trust Him, Fear Him, Love Him, as my God forever.</HI></P>
<P>There is no <HI>Christian,</HI> who does not Receive the Doctrine of the <HI>Trinity,</HI> as an Article of his <HI>Creed.</HI> Now, a <HI>Jew</HI> lately Turn'd <HI>Christian,</HI> re∣cieved it with this peculiar Emphasis. It is said, [for so <HI>he</HI> Read it, and <HI>we</HI> may Read it so,] in Deut. 6.4. <HI>Hear O Israel, The Lord, our God, the
<PB N="69" REF="000828_0069_0FAB416C6B88A358"/>
Lord, are One.</HI> Behold, sayes he, Here are <HI>Three</HI>; and yet it is added, These Three are but one. But it is the <HI>Second Person,</HI> that here more Emi∣nently chooses to be called, <HI>Our God,</HI> because <HI>He</HI> would more especially be <HI>Ours</HI> by Taking <HI>Our</HI> Flesh and Blood upon Himself; and it is <HI>in Him,</HI> that God becomes <HI>Ours.</HI> Truly, A <HI>Christian</HI> be∣holds the Lord Jesus God, as that <HI>Person</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> wherein God becomes eminently <HI>Ours,</HI> and he crye out, <HI>Oh! my God, my God, forevermore!</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> A CHRISTIAN, is one well satisfyed in <HI>JESUS of Nazareth,</HI> as the <HI>Messiah</HI> promised of God, unto the World.</P>
<P>The world was through all Ages Entertained with <HI>Promises,</HI> of a <HI>Messiah,</HI> to Redeem us from the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rses,</HI> which the Wrath of God for Sin hath brought upon us, and from the <HI>Mischiefs</HI> done to us, by that <HI>Old Serpent,</HI> the Devil, in our Hear∣kening unto him. These <HI>Promises</HI> are every where Scattered up and down, in the Scriptures of the Old Testament even from the Third of <HI>Genesis,</HI> to the Fourth of <HI>Malachi.</HI> Now, tis Es∣sential unto a CHRISTIAN, to entertain the Blessed JESUS of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> as the <HI>Messiah</HI> Ex∣hibited in all of these <HI>Very Great and Precious Pro∣mises.</HI> And there are espicially Two Things, that Convince a <HI>Christian</HI> of it.</P>
<P>First, A <HI>Christian</HI> is Convinced, That in our JESUS, all the ancient <HI>Oracles</HI> about the <HI>Messiah,</HI> have their full Accomplishment. You'l easily

bring a <HI>Christian,</HI> to joyn in a Consort with the Song of <HI>Mary,</HI> in Luk. 1.55. In Him, <HI>God ha's Helped us, as He Spake to our Fathers.</HI> A <HI>Christian</HI> will soon be Convinced, That there did no Con∣siderable Thing befal our JESUS, but what the Ancient <HI>Oracles</HI> did foretel concerning the <HI>Messiah.</HI> And, a <HI>Christian</HI> will soon be Convinced, That whatever the Ancient Oracles did foretel concern∣ing the <HI>Messiah,</HI> can be evidently found in our JESUS. Yea, any <HI>Rational man</HI> might be presently Convinced of This! There are especially Two Things in our Illustrious JESUS, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which the miserable <HI>Jews,</HI> are <HI>Scandalized</HI>: His <HI>Birth,</HI> and His <HI>Death.</HI> But in both of these, the <HI>Christian</HI> sees an Astonishing Accomplishment, of the Pro∣phecies, in the Ancient Oracles of God. The <HI>Messiah</HI> was to be <HI>Born,</HI> before the Tribe of <HI>Ju∣dah,</HI> should be utterly Stript of Lawgivers; and while the <HI>Second Temple</HI> was yet standing; and within Four hundred and Ninety Years, after the Proclamation of <HI>Cyrus</HI> for the Rebuilding of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> Now sayes the <HI>Christian, So was my Blessed Jesus!</HI> The <HI>Messiah</HI> was to be <HI>Born,</HI> at <HI>Bethlehem</HI>; and, <HI>Born</HI> of a <HI>Virgin</HI>; and, <HI>Born</HI> of <HI>Obscure Parentage.</HI> Now sayes the <HI>Christian, So was my Blessed Jesus</HI>! The <HI>Messiah</HI> was to Ride upon an <HI>Ass Colt,</HI> when He came to Work out our Salvation. Sayes the <HI>Christian, My Jesus did so</HI>! The <HI>Messiah</HI> was to be <HI>Despised</HI> and <HI>Rejected</HI> of His own Country-men. If the <HI>Messiah</HI> be not yet come, then whenever He does come, the

<HI>Jews</HI> are to deal with Him, just as they did with our <HI>Jesus.</HI> Upon this the <HI>Christian</HI> sayes, <HI>No, my Jesus was He!</HI> The <HI>Messiah,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r His being a Publick Preacher <HI>Three yea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and an half,</HI> was to be made a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> for the Sins of men, &amp; thereupon the <HI>City</HI> and the <HI>Temple</HI> were to fall under horrible <HI>Desolations. Was it not so with my Jesus?</HI> Will the <HI>Christian</HI> say. The <HI>Messiah</HI> was to be <HI>Betra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d</HI> by one of His own <HI>Disciples</HI>; He was to be <HI>Try'd</HI> and <HI>Judg'd,</HI> as a <HI>Malefactor</HI>; He was to have His <HI>Hands,</HI> and Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Feet Pierced,</HI> that is, to be <HI>Crucifyed: Vinegar</HI> was to be offered unto Him in His <HI>Agonies</HI>; He was to be Rob'd of His <HI>Garments</HI>; He was to Suffer with the worst of <HI>Criminals</HI>; He was to be Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed in the Tomb of a <HI>Rich man</HI>; like <HI>Jonah</HI>▪ He was to <HI>Rise again,</HI> and the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were thereupon to come unto Repentance. All this was predicted of the <HI>Messiah</HI>; Well then, sayes the <HI>Christian; My Jesus is the Messiah, for in Him is all of this, gloriously come to pass</HI>!</P>
<P>Again; A <HI>Christian</HI> is convinced, That the <HI>Miracles</HI> wrought by our JESUS, could be wrought by none but the True <HI>Messiah.</HI> It is said of our JESUS, <HI>The Son of David,</HI> in Rom. 1.4. <HI>He was Declared to be the Son of God with pow∣er.</HI> The <HI>Miracles</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, are called, <HI>Powers</HI>; and they may w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll be called so, inasmuch as they are Expressive of Supernatural <HI>Powers</HI> over the Creation of God. Now, when
<PB N="72" REF="000828_0072_0FAB416EAE01BD90"/>
a <HI>Christian</HI> sees the <HI>Miracles</HI> done by our Blessed JESUS, he is convinced of our Lords <HI>Divinity,</HI> and convinced of our Lords <HI>Messiah-ship,</HI> immedi∣ately; and he cries out, <HI>Oh! This my JESUS, is the Son of God!</HI> The <HI>Christian</HI> is very sure, That our JESUS, wrought such <HI>Miracles,</HI> as are in the Gospel Related of Him: Stupendous <HI>Miracles</HI> wherein, <HI>The Blind Received their Sight, the Lame Walked, the Lepers were Cleansed, the Deaf heard,</HI> the <HI>Devils</HI> that were the Instruments of Inflict∣ing such Calamities were cast out, and <HI>the Dead Raised up</HI> The <HI>Witnesses</HI> of those <HI>Miracles</HI> are Incontestable. The Obstinate and Enchanted <HI>Jews</HI> themselves do in their <HI>Talmuds</HI> own those <HI>Miracles.</HI> But then the <HI>Christian</HI> is very sure, That God would never have permitted such <HI>Miracles</HI> to be wrought by our JESUS, if He had not been the <HI>Messiah.</HI> Indeed, a <HI>False Pro∣phet</HI> may have a <HI>Sign,</HI> accompanying of Him. Yet, such is the Compassion of the Good God unto the World, that something or other always adhaeres to the <HI>Miracles of a Ly,</HI> whereby the Delusion may be detected. Whereas the <HI>Mira∣cles</HI> of our JESUS were such, that the more men Examine them, the more <HI>proofs</HI> will appear, of their being the <HI>Seals</HI> of the Great God, unto the Truth of all that He Declared. Our JESUS came, the <HI>Christian</HI> sees him coming, a man of Universal <HI>Holiness,</HI> and full of Endeavours to promote all that is <HI>Holy and Just and Good.</HI> He
<PB N="73" REF="000828_0073_0FAB416F6C3FA300"/>
Asserted Himself to be rhe <HI>Messiah</HI>; and for the Evidence of this Assertion, He not only did les∣ser Wonders, but also Raised the <HI>Dead,</HI> who had been divers Dayes putrifying in their <HI>Graves</HI>; and this in His own <HI>Name</HI> too: Yea, He Rais'd Himself also from the <HI>Dead,</HI> after He had been Stab'd thro' the Heart, and Hung Six Hours on a Cross, and Lay in a Sepulchre for Three Dayes together. If any man should ma∣liciously say, <HI>That all this was nothing but an Im∣posture of the Devil</HI>; God Almighty would ne∣ver <HI>Pardon</HI> that man, throughout Eternal Ages! The <HI>Christian,</HI> upon the sight hereof, says like that Officer, who saw something of it, <HI>Certainly this was the Son of God.</HI> What says the <HI>Christi∣an? O my JESUS, There are no works, like thy works; Thou art the Messiah that was to come.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> A CHRISTIAN, is one who Acknow∣ledges the matchless JESUS, to be the <HI>Priest,</HI> the <HI>Prophet,</HI> and the <HI>King,</HI> Appointed by God, for the Everlasting Acknowledgments of all His People. The Name of MESSIAH, which is given to our Lord Redeemer, it may be <HI>Seven Times</HI> in the Old-Testament, is the same with CHRIST, which is in the New-Testament gi∣ven perhaps, above Two Hundred and Four-score Times unto Him. The Name signifies, <HI>The Anointed.</HI> Now there were <HI>Three Offices</HI> of much Influence, in the Old Church of God;
<PB N="74" REF="000828_0074_0FAB4170A26A39F8"/>
that of a <HI>Priest,</HI> that of a <HI>Prophet,</HI> and that of a <HI>King</HI>; and it was usual for them, who sustained these <HI>Offices,</HI> to be <HI>Anointed</HI> thereunto. These <HI>Offices,</HI> and the <HI>Anointings</HI> wherewith persons were set apart for these <HI>Offices,</HI> were ordered by the God of Heaven to be Typical of our Sacred JESUS. His being, <HI>The Anointed,</HI> is His being both Commissioned and Qualified, for all the Offices of our <HI>Lord-Redeemer.</HI> And now, what is a CHRISTIAN, but a Believer on a CHRIST? One who Believes in the Blessed JESUS, as Gloriously Executing all the <HI>Offices</HI> of a <HI>Media∣tor.</HI></P>
<P>Particularly; First, unto a <HI>Christian,</HI> our Bles∣sed <HI>Jesus,</HI> is a <HI>Priest</HI> for ever. 'Tis said, in Heb. 3.1. <HI>Consider the High Priest of our Profes∣sion, Christ Jesus</HI>: Christ Jesus is the <HI>High-Priest</HI> of the <HI>Christian Profession</HI>; A <HI>Christian</HI> makes <HI>Profession</HI> of being Reconciled unto God, by no <HI>High-Priest,</HI> but <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> A <HI>Christian</HI> is one who sees himself utterly unable to make that <HI>Reparation</HI> unto God for the wrongs done by our Sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto Him, which His Just Law re∣quires. He therefore flies unto the Lord Jesus Christ, as the only <HI>High-Priest,</HI> that can Repair those wrongs, and make <HI>Atonement</HI> for him. What is a <HI>Priest</HI>? We have the <HI>Definition</HI> of one, in Heb. 5.1. <HI>He is one ordained for men, in Things pertaining to God, that he may offer both Gifts and Sacrifices for Sins.</HI> Now says the <HI>Chri∣stian,
<PB N="75" REF="000828_0075_0FAB418076952CD0"/>
I know no such Priest, but my Blessed Jesus.</HI> The <HI>Christian</HI> apprehends the Lord Jesus Christ, as a <HI>Priest Sacrificing</HI> for him. He Assents to that in Heb. 9.26. <HI>He hath appeared to put away Sin, by the Sacrifice of Himself.</HI> He sees the Lord Jesus Christ, yielding both Active and Passive <HI>Obedience</HI> unto God, on the behalf of His Elect: He sees this <HI>Obedience</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, as his <HI>Ransome</HI> from Eternal Mise∣ries. All the Relief, that a <HI>Christian</HI> has against the Fears of the Wrath of God is This; <HI>Christ hath Loved us, and given Himself for us, an Offer∣ing and a Sacrifice to God, of a sweet smelling Sa∣vour.</HI> Ask a <HI>Christian, How do you think to find Acceptance with God?</HI> He'l tell you, If he be a Christian, he'l tell you, <HI>'Tis thro' the Merits of the Obedience of my Lord Jesus Christ alone.</HI> The <HI>Christian</HI> also apprehends the Lord Jesus Christ as a <HI>Priest Interceeding</HI> for him. He assents to, That, in <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.25. <HI>He is able to Save to the utter∣most, seeing He ever Lives to make Intercession.</HI> He sees the Lord Jesus Christ, as a <HI>Legal Surety,</HI> and as a <HI>Publick Person,</HI> gone into the <HI>Holy of Holies</HI> for us; He sees the Lord Jesus Christ, with our Names on His <HI>Breast,</HI> there powerfully pleading for our purchased Salvation. A <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> has nothing to support him under all his Daily <HI>Corruptions,</HI> and his Daily <HI>Temptations,</HI> but this, <HI>My Jesus is my Advocate</HI>! The Soul of the <HI>Christian</HI> even <HI>Lives</HI> upon this Cordial, <HI>My
<PB N="76" REF="000828_0076_0FAB4180AAEE6310"/>
Christ Lives in Heaven, to make Intercession for Transgressors.</HI></P>
<P>Again, The Blessed <HI>Jesus</HI> is the <HI>Prophet</HI> of the <HI>Christian</HI>; the <HI>Shepherd</HI> and <HI>Bishop</HI> of his Soul; the <HI>Faithful Witness</HI> of God unto him; and his perpetual <HI>Counsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or.</HI> A <HI>Christian</HI> sees his Blessed <HI>Jesus,</HI> and saith with that <HI>Multitude,</HI> in Mat. 21.11. <HI>This is Jesus the Prophet.</HI> The <HI>Christian</HI> is one who apprehends the Lord Jesus Christ, as, <HI>A Teacher come from God</HI>; and, a <HI>Teacher,</HI> whose Acquaintance with the Counsels of God, infi∣nitely exceeds all that any mortal man can pre∣tend unto: <HI>Jesus, a Prophet,</HI> (says he) <HI>Mighty in Deed, and in Word before God</HI>! Hence, the <HI>Christian</HI> Embraces what the Lord Jesus Christ has Revealed, as being the True and the Whole <HI>Will of God</HI>; He will <HI>Credit</HI> nothing, with a Sa∣cred Belief, and <HI>Perform</HI> nothing, as a Sacred Worship, except what comes from the Lord Je∣sus Christ: In every Difficulty, he will go to the Lord Jesus Christ for Direction: and he car∣ries a Dark Soul to the Lord Jesus Christ, with this petition, <HI>Lord, that I may Receive, my Sight!</HI> The <HI>Scholars</HI> of an <HI>Aristole</HI> are called, <HI>Aristotele∣ans.</HI> Thus a <HI>Christian,</HI> what is he but a <HI>Scholar</HI> of <HI>Christ?</HI></P>
<P>Once more; The Blessed <HI>Jesus</HI> is the <HI>King</HI> of the <HI>Christian</HI>: the <HI>Lord of Life,</HI> the <HI>Lord of Peace,</HI> the <HI>Lord of Glory,</HI> yea, the <HI>Lord of All.</HI> A <HI>Christian</HI> sees his Blessed <HI>Jesus,</HI> and sayes with
<PB N="77" REF="000828_0077_0FAB41816AB6D850"/>
that Sincere Soul, in Joh. 1.49. <HI>Thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel.</HI> The <HI>Christian</HI> apprehends the Lord Jesus Christ, as the <HI>Master</HI> of the <HI>World,</HI> the <HI>Lord of Hosts,</HI> and of <HI>Angels,</HI> the <HI>Man on the Throne</HI> managing all the <HI>Wheels</HI> of Providence: And as the <HI>Ruler</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI>; the <HI>Spouse</HI> and <HI>Head,</HI> and <HI>Lord</HI> of it, and the <HI>Law</HI>-giver of the Conscience. Hence the <HI>Christian</HI> seeks unto the Lord Jesus Christ, for to have his own Heart Subdued unto the Will of God, and for <HI>Defence</HI> from all Interior Adversaries, and <HI>Conquest</HI> over all. Thus, he <HI>Recieves Christ the Lord</HI>! The Subjects of an <HI>Herod</HI> were called <HI>He∣rodians.</HI> Thus, a <HI>Christian</HI> is but a Subject of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> A CHRISTIAN is one, who Considers the Profound <HI>Humiliation</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, as no matter of <HI>Prejudice</HI>; no, but as a matte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of unspeakable <HI>Praise</HI> and <HI>Joy.</HI> The foul∣mou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Julian,</HI> having Renounced <HI>Christianity,</HI> would Scoff <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t our Blessed JESUS, calling Him, <HI>The Staked God.</HI> But <HI>Christianity</HI> teaches us, to be infinitely Satisfyed with the Thoughts of what that <HI>Man,</HI> who is <HI>God</HI> as well as <HI>Man,</HI> Suffered on a <HI>Stake.</HI> The <HI>Pagans,</HI> would laugh at the <HI>Christians</HI> of old, saying, <HI>Tu adoras Crucifixum</HI>; What? You are one of the <HI>Fools,</HI> that <HI>Adore</HI> Him that was <HI>Crucified.</HI> The <HI>Christian</HI> Thinks, <HI>I have still the more cause to Adore Him for That!</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> do still taunt at the <HI>Christians,</HI> with such a
<PB N="78" REF="000828_0078_0FAB41822DDCAD48"/>
Flout as that; <HI>What? you Adore</HI> Talui, i. e. <HI>an Hanged man.</HI> The <HI>Christian</HI> Thinks, <HI>I had been a Damned man, if He had not been So</HI>! A <HI>Christian</HI> is, <HI>One that is not Asham'd of a Christ on a Cross.</HI> And indeed, Why should he? The posture of old <HI>Jacobs</HI> Hands in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Children, might intimate unto them, That through a <HI>Cross</HI> all the <HI>Blessing</HI> of Heaven is derived unto us. What we translate, in Isa. 52.13. <HI>My Servant shall deal pru∣dently,</HI> (which the <HI>Chalde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Paraphrase Expressly applies to the <HI>Messiah,</HI>) may have the <HI>Messiahs</HI> laying Himself on a <HI>Cross,</HI> intimated in the He∣brew Original. A <HI>Christian</HI> is not <HI>Scandalized</HI> at it, That his Lord who is the <HI>Everlasting Father,</HI> was once an <HI>Infant</HI> laid in a <HI>Manger,</HI> where <HI>Beasts</HI> had their <HI>Fodder</HI>; but he thinks, <HI>This was, that I, with my Infants, who have made our selves worse than Beasts, may come to be Lodg'd and Fed among the Angels of God.</HI> A <HI>Christian</HI> is not <HI>Scandalized</HI> at it, That his Lord, who is the <HI>High Possessor of Heaven and Earth,</HI> had <HI>not an House where to lay His Head</HI>; but he thinks, <HI>This was, that I, to whom Hell, the Place of Dragons belonged, may have an House Eternal in the Heavens.</HI> He is not <HI>Scan∣dalized</HI> at it, That his Lord, who is the <HI>Creator of all things,</HI> did Submit unto the poor <HI>Mechanick Employment of a Carpenters</HI>; but he thinks, <HI>This was, that I, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho have made Wickedness my Employ∣ment, may be made a King and a Priest unto my God.</HI> He is not <HI>Scandalized</HI> at it, That his Lord, who

Sitts on the <HI>Throne of Eternity,</HI> should <HI>Wear a Crown of Thorns</HI>; but he thinks, <HI>This is, that I may obtain a Crown of Life.</HI> He is not <HI>Scanda∣lized</HI> at it, That his Lord, who is the <HI>Judge of the World,</HI> should be <HI>Condemned</HI> at the <HI>Bar</HI> of sinful men; but he thinks, <HI>This is, that I, a vile Sinner, may be Acquitted at the Bar of the Holy God.</HI> He is not <HI>Scandalized</HI> at it, That his Lord, whose <HI>Hands</HI> Wield the <HI>Scepter of the Om∣nipotent,</HI> should have his <HI>Hands nailed</HI> unto a <HI>Tree of Death</HI>; but he thinks. <HI>This is to make Atone∣ment for my medling with the Forbidden Tree, and that I may come to Eat of the Tree of Life.</HI> The <HI>Pains</HI> of <HI>Hell,</HI> he sees getting hold on his Lord, who is the <HI>Joy of the whole Heaven</HI>: He is not <HI>Scandalized</HI> at it, but thinks, <HI>This is, that I may arrive to pleasures at Gods Right Hand for ever∣more</HI>! The <HI>Christian</HI> is wonderfully pleased, with Reflections, Like those which occurr, in the Writings of the Ancients;
<Q>The <HI>Maker</HI> of <HI>man,</HI> was <HI>made a man:</HI> He that Rules the <HI>Stars of Heaven,</HI> did Suck the <HI>Breasts of a Wo∣man</HI>: The <HI>Bread</HI> of Life was <HI>Hungry</HI>; The <HI>Spring</HI> of <HI>Life</HI> was <HI>Thirsty</HI>; The <HI>Light</HI> of the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld saw <HI>Nights</HI> of Sleep; He that is the <HI>Way,</HI> was weary wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Travelling; He that is the <HI>Truth</HI> was overwh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lmed with false Accusa∣tions; The <HI>Judge</HI> of the Quick and the Dead, was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raigned before a mortal Judge: <HI>Justice</HI> it self was Condemned by the <HI>Unjust.</HI> He

<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> A CHRISTIAN is one who values a <HI>Baptism,</HI> into the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ; <HI>Obtains</HI> it, if have not Enjoy'd it; <HI>Improves</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, if he has obtain'd it. <HI>Christians</HI> are the <HI>Disciples</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ.

<HI>Imitation</HI> of Him.

But our Holy Lord Jesus Christ, who came to <HI>Redeem us from all Iniquity,</HI> exceedingly Resents it, if any <HI>Christians</HI> give Him cause to say, as in Ezek. 36.20. <HI>They profaned my Holy Name, and it was said, These are the people of the Lord.</HI> Now, every genuine <HI>Christian,</HI> is won∣derfully Afraid of doing any Thing, that may Reflect any Reproach upon the Name of his dear Lord Jesus Christ: <HI>Oh!</HI> thinks he, <HI>My dear Lord has Dy'd for me, and I had rather Dy than Dishonour Him.</HI> The Apostle has well put a difference be∣tween these Two, in 1 Pet. 4.15, 16. <HI>Let none of you suffer as an Evil Deer, yet if any man suffer as a Christian, Let him glorify God.</HI> An <HI>Evil Doer,</HI> and a <HI>Christian,</HI> are directly contrary, one unto ano∣ther.

Truly, Sirs If we <HI>Christians,</HI> are <HI>Wicked,</HI> or <HI>Worldly</HI> Wretches, we shall open the mouths of men, against our Lord Jesus Christ; and as in <HI>Jam.</HI> 2.7. <HI>They'l Blaspheme that worthy Name, by which ye are called.</HI> As <HI>Averroes,</HI> the Arabian Philosopher; he was much taken with the <HI>Chri∣stians,</HI> till he saw a vile Thing very common a∣mong them; <HI>Ah, Now,</HI> says he, <HI>Let my Soul go among the Philosophers</HI>!

The Pagans of old, called the <HI>Christians</HI> by the Name of, <HI>Chrestians</HI>; they mistook the Name, and it was now taken to signify, <HI>Good, Kind, Useful, and Sweet Natured People.</HI> Why, if we would be <HI>Chri∣stians,</HI> we must be <HI>Chrestians</HI>; we must not be harsh, &amp; fierce and unserviceable, &amp; ill-conditioned; we must be all made of Benignity towards all the

World, and count our selves Enriched with any opportunity to Express Goodness, and Kind∣nesses towards all the Children of men. When the Heathen Emperour <HI>Severus,</HI> did see Two <HI>Christians</HI> most shamefully Quarrelling with one another, he gave order, <HI>Let those two Wretches ne∣ver be called</HI> Christians <HI>any more; Their Master Christ never taught them to do as they do.</HI> Even so, if any of you, <HI>Christians,</HI> do not lead Godly, Sober &amp; Righteous Lives, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself utters &amp; Thunders that Order from Heaven about you, <HI>Let not those People be called</HI> Christians, <HI>any longer; Tis a Dishonour to me, that they should be called so.</HI> In the Primitive Times, if a <HI>Christian</HI> were asked, <HI>Have you kept the Lords day strictly</HI>? he would Reply, <HI>I am a Christian, and I dare do no other.</HI> Thus, if it be asked concerning any of us; <HI>Do's that man Pray without ceasing, and bring up his Family in the Fear of God, &amp; deal justly, &amp; fairly, &amp; kindly with all the World?</HI> Oh!
