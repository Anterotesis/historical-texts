<HEAD>His Excellency, The Earl of BELLOMONTS SPEECH TO THE Honorable the COUNCIL and House of Representatives, Conven'd in General Assembly, at <HI>Boston,</HI> in His Majesties Province of the Massachusetts-Bay in <HI>New-England,</HI> on <HI>Fryday</HI> the
<DATE>2<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>June</HI> 1699</DATE>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot but think the extraordinary kind Reception I have had among you, is a sure presage of a perfect good Agreement, and Correspondence between you and me; to which no Care of mine or Study shall be wanting. And that I may acquit my self towards you as I ought, I shall as well as my Weak∣ness will permit me, Copy after the Example of Our Great Master the King, who through the whole Course of His Administration, has shew<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d a tenderness of His people not to be equall'd, and a sin∣gular moderation even towards His most Inveterate Enemies; the first an effect of His Goodness, the latter of His Magnanimity and Clemen∣cy: which admirable qualities have gain'd Him the just Veneration of all mankind; and ought to possess our hearts that are here with the same Loyalty, Affection and Duty towards His Sacred Person, that our Fellow Subjects in <HI>England</HI> have manifested ever since His Maje∣sties most Happy Accession to the Throne.</P>
<P>I cannot more truly Imitate the King in a Fatherly Care and Ten∣derness of you, than by looking into the publick Administration of Justice, to see that it be done quickly and impartially. And for moderation, which I take to be in a peculiar manner the Kings At∣tribute; I come among you with a Settled Resolution not to disturb any of you in the Exercise of your Consciences, or in the free En∣joyment of your Liberties and Estates.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="039343_0002_10141E4CD6BB2720"/>In a word, I will do you all the good I possibly can in my Station; and that in Duty to God, to the King, and to my own Conscience and Honour.</P>
<P>I Understand the Courts of Justice are fallen, I therefore Recom∣mend your Reviving them by Act of Assembly, such an one I mean, as you can be sure will meet with His Majesties Approbation when 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> before Him.</P>
<P>I should be glad you would think of ways to Ingage the Neigh∣bour Indians in a Trade with you, which I am apt to believe may be managed with that advantage to them, by a good regulation and underselling the <HI>French,</HI> that their friendship and fidelity may be se∣cured to the Crown, and then they will be no longer Thorns in your sides.</P>
<P>The Country I am told is destitute of Stores of War, which is so necessary a provision, that I cannot think I need do more than put you in mind of it.</P>
<P>The Fortifications on the Island at the mouth of your Harbour, ought in my mind to be looked into, I intend to visit them in a few days with <HI>His Majesties Engineer,</HI> and will afterwards report to you, whether the present Works be sufficient, or new ones requisite.</P>
<P>I would very gladly promote a Charter of Incorporation for your Colledge at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and will heartily joyn with you in addressing His Majesty for His Royal Grant of such Priviledges and Franchises as His Majesty in His Goodness shall Think fit. 'Tis a great advan∣tage you have above the other Provinces, that your Youth are not put to Travel far for Learning, but have the Muses at their doors. Besides that Colledge will always be a Nursery to afford you a Sup∣ply of Able Ministers for the Cure of Souls. Therefore 'twere pitty the Kings Royal Charter should not be sollicited out of hand.</P>
<P>Mr. Speaker, and you Gentlemen Re∣presentatives;</P>
<P>AS it is your undoubted right, that the Granting or Continuing a Revenue should have its first rise with you: I therefore apply to you, that Care may be taken for the necessary support of the Government, in such a manner as will best suit with the ease and circumstances of the People. The Revenue of Excise I understand will Expire the Twenty Ninth of this Month, and you will do well to consider, whether it will not be proper to revive it. Mr. Treasu∣rer has shew'd me an Abstract of the publick Accounts, by which I perceive the Government is out of Debt, which is a happy Cir∣cumstance for you, and as such, is very pleasing to me, for I shall always delight in your happiness.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="039343_0003_10141E4FB1874A70"/>Some <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I am Commanded from <HI>England</HI> to offer you for your passing; which are of a publick nature, and will be for your Ser∣vice; and such other Laws as you stand in need of, for promoting your Trade, and the general Interest of the Province, I will Joyn with you in; provided they be made to square with the Laws of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I should be wanting to you and my self too, if I did not put you in mind of the indispensable duty and respect we owe the King, for being the Glorious Instrument of our Deliverance from the odious Fetters and Chains of Popery and Tyranny which had almost overwhelm'd our Consciences, and Subverted all our Civil Rights. There is something that's God-like in what the King has done for us. The work of Redemption and Preservation comes next to that of Creation. I would not be misunderstood so as to be thought to Rob God of the Glory of that Stupendous Act of His Providence, in bringing to pass the late happy and wonderful Revolution in <HI>England.</HI> His Blessed Work it was without doubt, and He was pleas'd to make King <HI>William</HI> mediately the Author and Instrument of it. Ever since the Year 1602. <HI>England</HI> has had a Succession of Kings that have been Aliens; in this respect I mean, That they have not fought our Battles, nor been in our Interests, but have been in an unnatural manner plotting and contriving to undermine and subvert our Religion, Laws and Liberties, till God was pleased by His Almighty Power, and Infinite Mercy and Goodness to give us a true <HI>English</HI> King in the Person of His Present Majesty, who has upon all occasions hazzarded His Royal Person in the Front of our Battles, and where there was most danger. He has restor'd to our Nation the almost lost Character of Bravery and Valour; and what is most valuable of all, His Majesty is entirely in the Interests of His people 'Tis therefore our Duty and Interest to Pray to God in a most fervent manner, That He would Bless our Great KING <HI>WILLIAM,</HI> with a long and prosperous Reign over us, to which I am perswaded, you that are here present, and all Good Men will heartily say. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
