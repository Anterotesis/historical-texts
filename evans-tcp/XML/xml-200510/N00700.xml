<HEAD>The Remonstrance of several of the Representatives for several Counties of the Province of <HI>New-York</HI> being Members of the present Assembly. Offered to the Consideration of the House.</HEAD>
<P>THat the Remonstrants are fairly and legally chosen and returned as Representa∣tives of their Country, without any dispute about their Elections</P>
<P>That by the false and unjust Returns of some Sheriffs, several who at present sit as Members of the House) have been petitioned against, that their Elections and Returns may be fairly tryed and determined.</P>
<P>That contrary to all Law, Justice, and the constant Practice of all English Assemblies, the said disputed Members have sate in the House, and by their Number (joyned with some few others) have made the greater Vote in the House, &amp; thereh have constituted Orders how their own disputed Elections should be tryed. By which Orders they have prevented all Complainants from being heard, have unjustly excluded several legal Sworn Members, without hearing their Defence, and have arbitrarily obtruded themselves upon the House.</P>
<P>That the Insolence of the present Speaker, Mr. <HI>Phillip French</HI> hath been so great, that (being chosen Speaker by Votes of the disputed Members) during the Dispute about his own Election, (the Complainants being absent &amp; unheard) he continued in the House, argued and debated his own Cause, with Threats, Menaces and Reproachful Language to the Representatives, and arbitrarily himself put the Question about the justness of the Sheriffs Return of himself.</P>
<P>By which Proceedings these Remonstrants do apprehend, that the legal Rights and Priviledges of Assemblies are overturned and destroyed. Nor can they with Honour, Conscience, or a just Discharge of the Trust reposed in them by their Country, sit, joyn or act with these disputed Members, until they fairly submit the hearing of the said Disputes before his Excellency, the Earl of <HI>Bellomont</HI> and Council, and have their Judg∣ment on the matter, to which these Remonstrants will humbly submit.</P>

<P>THat your Petitioners did this day offer the annexed Remonstrance to the Consider∣ation of the House of Representatives, but by the Violence of the Speaker, and the Votes of him and those others unjustly returned by the Sheriffs, all Relief and Satisfaction was denyed to be given to your Petitioners, and the said Remonstrance was rejected; on which your Petitioners did with-draw themselves, resolving not to sit and act, and betray the Liberties of the People with such Persons whose Guilt makes

<P>WE the Representatives of three Counties, nigh half of the eight Counties of this Government, being indisputably elected and Returned, and sworn to serve in this present Assembly, being fully perswaded of our own knowledge, Tat the Sheriff of <HI>New York</HI> hath, expresly contrary to his Oath and Duty, made a Return under his Hand and Seal, of four Members for the City and County of <HI>N.

Whereupon we Petitioned his Excellency and Council, whose Advice to the House, to reconcile our Differences, and give Satis∣faction, was likewise absolutely rejected.

<P>WHereas we have made an humble Petition to your Lordship and Council, set∣ting forth a Remonstrance we had made to the House of Representatives, which they had rejected, &amp; therefore praying we might be heard, or other∣wise that the present Assembly might be Dissolved, the major Vote of which being made by the Unjust Returns of corrupt Sheriffs. On which Petition your Lordship did admit us, with the House together, into your Presence, and did, with great Piety and Justice, exhort us to go together and reconcile our Differences, and give and receive Satisfaction, that his Majesties Service, and the good of the Country might be pro∣moted. Accordingly we went to the House, and desired Mr. Speaker that we might have some Satisfaction given us, in relation to our Remonstrance and Petition, which he with great Violence denyed, and would not permit our Petition to your Lordship to be read, but instead thereof he himself, and others with him, who are not chosen by the People, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave us reproachful threatning Language, telling, <HI>We deserved to be Hang'd if we were in</HI> England, <HI>that our Counsellors were Villians and Rogues.</HI> On which we did again with-draw our selves, being resolved never to betrary our Country (whom we indisputably represent by joyning and acting with such Persons who represent none but themselves, and have so apparently destroyed all the Rights and Liberties of the People. And as we have made our Protests to the House against their Proceedings, So we crave leave to assure your Lordship and Council of our Inviolable Loyalty to his Sacred Majesty King <HI>William,</HI> (for whose sake two Members of this present Assembly have been excluded the House, as attainted of Treason for most early appearing in the late happy Revolution, for which they have obtained his Majesties Gracious Pardon) That with a chearful and ready Obedience to your Lordships Government, under which we are assured our English Constitutions shall not be undermined by Wicked Men.</P>
<P>And we lastly crave leave to make this our Protest to your Lordship and Council, (in behalf of the Counties we represent against all manner of Acts and things that shall be concluded on or done by those pretended Members now sitting, that our Country may not be obliged to obey Laws made by those who are not chosen by the Country, but have, since their sitting, violently over-run all common Decency and Order, as well as the Rights and Liberties of the People.

<P>HIs Excellency did acquaint the Council, that the Heats and Annimosities in the Assembly were so great that they did altogether obstruct the Kings Service, that the matter is unpresidented, and no means can be found effectual to reconcile the Dif∣ferences; and his Majesty having entrusted him with the Prerogative of Adjourning, Proroguing and Dissolving of Assemblies, he must now make use of that Authority, and did declare his Resolution to Dissolve the Assembly. And order'd to be read a Protesta∣tion of the six Remonstrators, in behalf of the Counties they represent, against all Laws that may be made.</P>
<P>The Clerk of the Council was sent to call the Assembly. The Speaker and House being present, his Excellency said,

<P>You have now sate a whole Moneth, without any Interruption by me, and have done nothing either for the Service of his Majesty or the good of your Country, except the Address to his Majesty, for which I thank you. I am sorry your Carriage since hath been so contrary thereto, that it is absolutely necessary for the Kings Service, and the Safety and Peace of the Government that you should be Dissolved. Your Proceedings have been so Unwarrantable, wholly tending to Strife and Division, and indeed Disloyal to his Majesty and his Laws, and Destructive to the Rights and Liberties of the People, that I do think fit to Dissolve this present Assembly, and it is Dissolved accordingly.</P>
