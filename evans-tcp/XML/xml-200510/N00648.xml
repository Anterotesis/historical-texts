<P>WE have received several Expresses from the Imperial Army, which bring us the welcom News of a glorious Victory obtained on the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army, with these particulars, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Turks</HI> having a design to surprise <HI>Segedin,</HI> and afterwards to take up their Winter Quarters in <HI>Upper Hungary</HI> &amp; <HI>Trinsilvania,</HI> the Imperial Army marched to <HI>To∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sw<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Bridge,</HI> and fell on, and defeated some Thousands of <HI>Turks</HI> who had set that Bridge in Fire, but it being soon extinguished, the Imperial Army passed over it, and advanced in <HI>12</HI> Columns to the <HI>Moras Bridge</HI> by <HI>Syreck,</HI> which the Enemy also had set on Fire; where, in the <HI>5</HI>th instant they again fell on the Enemy, and many were killed on both sides: On the <HI>6</HI>th, our Army advanced to <HI>Peter Waradin,</HI> where with the Front towards the Enemy, the Right Wing to the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer Schans,</HI> we charg'd the <HI>Turks</HI> so unexpectedly, that we kill'd <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of them: On <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>7</HI>th, our Army rested, and Advice was brought, that a great part of the <HI>Otto∣man</HI> Army was decamped, and marched to <HI>Lenta,</HI> and another part to <HI>Cobita:</HI> upon which Prince <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of <HI>Savoy</HI> followed them: where being come, we found they had made three Retrenchments to defend a Bridge which they were possessed of; but our Forces drove them out of all their Entrenchments, notwithstanding the desperate Resistance of <HI>20000 Janisa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies:</HI> And we then fell on their Army, and putting them into confusion, they endeavoured to escape over the Bridge; but we ki<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led so many of them, that the Passage of it was stopped. Since which the Prince of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is come to <HI>Eb<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsdorf</HI> with <HI>7 Turkish</HI> Calashes, <HI>86</HI> Colours, <HI>7</HI> Horse. T<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is and the <HI>Sultans</HI> great Tent, and doth assure the Imperial Court, That above <HI>20000 Turks</HI> have been Slain on the Spot, and about <HI>10000</HI> taken Prisoners and drowned, besides <HI>15000 Turkish</HI> Horse, which were sent by the Grand Seignior to support the Rebels in <HI>Upper Hungary,</HI> and were commanded to Swim the <HI>Theysse,</HI> were most of them drowned, He add<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that we have taken <HI>120</HI> pieces of Cannon, and have found <HI>6000</HI> Waggons in their Entrench∣ments, with Warlike Instruments: That the Grand Vizier and the <HI>Aga</HI> of the <HI>Jan<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies</HI> were in the number of the Slain. <HI>P. S.</HI> A Major is also come to the Court <HI>Diedrigstein</HI> from the Camp, who adviseth, that Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> of <HI>Savoy</HI> had sent him an Express, to give an <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, That the Imperial Army marching towards <HI>Temeswaer,</HI> and met <HI>4000</HI> and some say, <HI>6000 Jannisa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies,</HI> and had totally defeated them. This Major adds, That the <HI>Turks</HI> have been so totally defeated, that it will be hardly possible for them to form any Army again <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. We have advice, that in the late Battel with the <HI>Muscovi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s,</HI> the <HI>Tartars</HI> have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost above <HI>15000</HI> Men.</P>
