<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Speaker, and you Gentlemen Representatives;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am very glad to meet you here, according to your Adjournment the last Session. I just now heard the Members of <HI>Westchester County</HI> have absented, and hope Mr. Speaker, the House will do that Right to their own Honour to inquire into the Reason of their Absence.</P>
<P>I was call'd to <HI>Albany</HI> this Winter by a double Obligation, my Duty to His most sacred Majesty, in discharge of that Trust he has been graciously pleased to put into my hands, and my Affection to his Subjects of that City, who by Address desired my Presence with them.</P>
<P>And indeed, the Intelligence of a Design on that place, by the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ench</HI> and their <HI>Indians</HI> (being flusht with their Success on <HI>Pemaquid</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>New-England</HI> the last Summer) was a sufficient spur to me.</P>
<P>I therefore resolved to make <HI>Albany</HI> my Winter Quarter, looking upon it not only as a Barrier to this Province, but to other Colonies of his Majesties Empire in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>My Passage met with some Difficulties by an early Winter, being twice drove ashore by the Ice, and at last lockt up by it; yet I made the Journey in twelve days, though with some extraordinary Expence, being necessitated to travel part of the way by Land, with a Detach∣ment of my own Company.</P>
<P>Coll. <HI>Schuyler,</HI> who commands the Militia in those parts, and speaks the Language, was very active in procuring Waggons and other Assistance, (as Sleas for bringing up Field Pieces, small Arms, Am∣munition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which could not be done gratis.</P>
<P>The Journey had the effect I expected, some Families who designed to remove, upon the report of my coming, staid, by which the Gar∣rison was much strengthened.</P>
<P>I observed in all the Inhabitants, great zeal for his Majesties service: they were cheerful in the performance of their Duty, watchful and vigilant upon those Guards committed to their care.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are some-what straitned by quartering his Maje∣sties Companys; the Houses are small, fitted only for the conveniency of their own Families; if Barrachs were built (which will be no great Charge) the Inhabitants would be eased, Souldiers better ac∣commodated, Desertion easier prevented, and the City better fortified.</P>
<P>And as you have hitherto shewed great regard for his Majesties Service, in taking care as well for recruiting, as better subsisting, those Companys, so I hope you will continue in the good mind of easing the Inhabitants, by accommodating the Souldiers.</P>
<P>Your last gratuity to them had such influence, that not one man has deserted since.</P>
<P>I desire you'll appoint some of your House to look into those Pay∣ments, by which you'll see, that so much Money as could be got upon the Credit of that Act, has been applyed as it directs. Those Recruits from <HI>Connecticut</HI> came very seasonably, they had their levy
<PB N="72" REF="000810_0003_0FAA5739F4F5CCE0"/>
Money, and those two Officers that conducted them were paid One Pound for each man, as a Reward for their Pains and Care, which I hope gave them all Satisfaction.</P>
<P>The W<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nter seem<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the most proper Season for the <HI>French</HI> to make an attach upon <HI>Albany,</HI> all Rivers, Lakes and Marshes being so hard by the Frost that Cannon may be drawn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Yet in Summer those parts suffer most by skulking Parties of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI>; so that I must recommend to you the care of Recruiting his Majesties Companys at <HI>May</HI> next (when the time of those inlisted by your Act determines) otherwise it will be impossible to cover the out Plantations; those Farmers will remove, and leave the Country waste, the consequence of that will be the Desolation of the City, which must then become a Garrison.</P>
<P>The five Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> can have no Relief there, their Friends being gone, which they may justly conclude to be for fear of the <HI>French,</HI> and those Indians will then purchase their Safety and Con∣veniency by joyning to our Enemies of <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P>The care you have taken for payment of a Party to advance upon the Enemies borders, and lodge there for some time, to discover their motion, is of great use; I hope you will continue that Allowance, and also consider the advantage we found last Summer by the pay∣ment of Six Pounds to any <HI>Christian</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> for every Head they bring in of those skulking Murderers, who spare neither Women nor Children.</P>
<P>By that encouragement we had some of them cut off in <HI>September</HI> last. Those Gentlemen you have entrusted in the payment of the ad<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce Parties, are without doubt <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for this, being <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in <HI>Albany</HI>; they should have a Fund or Credi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to pay for every Head brought in.</P>
<P>The punctual Payment for la<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ummers Serv<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> will spur many Young Men to be Adventurers, both <HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI>; they'll hunt hard upon this encouragement. I desire you'll continue Life in so honest a design for the Preservation of his Majesties Subjects in those parts.</P>
<P>I cannot be unconcerned at the Hardships this Province lies under, above others (by reason of this War.) You have Agents now attending his Majesty, he is our gracious King, Father of his People, he will hear.</P>
<P>A true and plain Account of our Circumstances will be represent∣ed, and Relief obtained from his Majesties pious Care of all his Subjects.</P>
<P>You have seen the Memorial given in to their Excellencys, the Lords Justices. I have since received Letters, and another Paper given in by those Gentlemen to the Right Honourable, the Commis∣sioners for Trade and Plantations. I shall communicate them to your House.</P>
<P>I know those Gentlemen imployed from the Province are faithful and diligent. I will not question their Success, if we are not want∣ing
