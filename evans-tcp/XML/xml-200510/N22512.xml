<HEAD>BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, A Proclamation.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we review the calamities which afflict so many other nations, the present condition of the United States affords much matter of conso∣lation and satisfaction. Our exemption hitherto from foreign war—an increas∣ing prospect of the continuance of that exemption—the great degree of inter∣nal tranquility we have enjoyed—the recent confirmation of that tranquility, by the suppression of an insurrection which so wantonly threatened it—the happy course of our public affairs in general—the unexampled prosperity of all classes of our citizens, are circumstances which peculiarly mark our situation with indications of the Divine Benificence towards us. In such a state of things it is, in an especial manner, our duty as a people, with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reve∣rence and affectionate gratitude, to acknowledge our many and great <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tions to ALMIGHTY GOD, and to implore him to continue and confirm the blessings we experience.</P>
<P>Deeply penetrated with this sentiment, I GEORGE WASHINGTON, President of the United States, do recommend to all religious societies and denominations, and to all persons whomsoever within the United States, to set apart and observe Thursday the nineteenth day of February next, as a Day of Public Thanksgiving and Prayer; and on that day to meet together, and render their sincere and hearty thanks to the Great Ruler of nations, for the manifold and signal mercies, which distinguish our lot as a nation; particu∣larly for the possession of constitutions of government which unite, and by their union establish liberty with order—for the preservation of our peace fo∣reign and domestic—for the seasonable controul which has been given to a spirit of disorder, in the suppression of the late insurrection—and generally, for the prosperous course of our affairs public and private; and at the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> time, humbly and fervently to beseech the Kind Author of these blessings, graciously to prolong them to us—to imprint on our hearts a deep and solemn sense of our obligations to him for them—to teach us rightly to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their immense value—to preserve us from the arrogance of prosperity, and from hazarding the advantages we enjoy by delusive <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>—to dispose us to me∣rit the continuance of his favors, by not abusing them, by our gratitude for them, and by a correspondent conduct as citizens and as men—to render this country more and more a safe and propritious asylum for the unfortunat of other countries—to extend among us true and useful knowledge—to diffuse and establish habits of sobriety, order, morality and piety; and finally, to im∣part all the blessings we possess, or ask for ourselves, to the whole family of mankind.</P>
