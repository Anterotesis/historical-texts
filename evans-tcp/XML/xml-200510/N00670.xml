And I humbly crave leave to enter a Claim, that the New World may be no longer made an Outcast: but may be admitted to as∣sist at the CORONATION. Perhaps some may think it superfluous, at this time of day to pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lish any thing against those Conjectures which being ground less, fall of themselves But on the other hand, when the Great KING was by his Ambas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adors keeping up a Treaty of Marriage with <HI>America:</HI> it was then very Unseasonable and absurd to raise, or receive a Vain Report to her Disparagement. And it seemeth convenient, that that which hath been said
<PB REF="000813_0003_0FAA56B76F22A680"/>
and written, and printed over and over again, to the Injury and Prejudice of <HI>Columbina:</HI> should one time or other be Unsaid; that so the Scandal may be removed. And seeing the meer Conjectures of Learned and Great Men, do bear a great sway with multitudes, who never enquire what the grounds are they go upon: it may seem a just Occasion for this small disqui∣sition. In which I have endeavoured to prove that <HI>America</HI>'s Name is to be seen fairly Recorded in the Scriptures; particularly, in the Book of <HI>Psalms,</HI> in <HI>Daniel,</HI> and the <HI>Revelation.</HI> That <HI>Euphrates</HI> may be distin∣guished from the Sea, and from other Rivers, it ought to be limited to some proper Place; for which place, I propound the New World: as being so far from deserving the Nick names of <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog</HI>; that it stands fair for being made the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at of the Divine Metropolis. In this manner Jesus Christ will turn his back upon the pretended Vicar; untill He turn again, utterly to destroy him by the United Anger of the Seventh Vial.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev 16.19.</HI></NOTE> Another thing that seemeth probable to me, is, that the <HI>New-English</HI> Planters were the Fore∣runners of the Kings of the East; and as the Morning Star, giving certain Intelligence that the Sun of Righteousness will quickly rise and Shine with Illustrious Grace and Favour, upon this despised Hemisphere. If some Ac∣commodations seem novel and harsh at the first view; yet I suppose, I have Mr. <HI>Mede</HI>'s Indulgence for the producing them: <HI>Illud pro ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to habens, nisi in hisce talibus liberius paulo sentiendi, imo et errandi Venia con∣cedatur: ad profunda illa et latentia Veritatis adyta, viam nunquam patefactum iri.</HI> Epist. p. <HI>539.</HI> As for <HI>Daniel, 11.45.</HI> It is Planting, and not Replanting, that is there spoken of.

<HEAD>TO THE HONORABLE, Sir <HI>WILLIAM ASHƲRST</HI> Knight, GOVERNOUR, and the COMPANY For the Propagation of the GOSPEL to the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> and places adjacent, in <HI>AMERICA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Commendation of <HI>Erasmus,</HI> in his Book entituled <HI>Ecclesiastes,</HI> doth very justly belong to the <HI>English</HI> Nation, upon account of their effectual Desires that the <HI>Americans</HI> might be gospelliz'd; <HI>Pulcherrimum, Deoque gratissimum erat dare potius quam accipere ijs quos stude mus Christo lucrifacere: It was a most beautifull Thing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Richard Eden</HI> in his Epistle to <HI>P</HI> Martyr's Decads of the Ocean.</NOTE> <HI>and most acceptable unto God, rather to give to them, than to receive from them whom we endeavour to gain for Christ.</HI> And yet their Praises are to be sung in a higher Note: For I can't but think that either <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>New-England,</HI> or both (Together is best) is the only Bride Maid mentioned by Name in <HI>Da∣vid</HI>'s prophetical <HI>Epithalamium,</HI> to assist at the Great Wedding now shortly to be made. And for ought I know, this Noble Gift, Administred by your Hands, may be partly intended. Angels Incognito have sometimes made themselves guests to Men, designing thereby to surprise them with a Requital of their Love to Strangers. In like manner the <HI>English</HI> Nation, in shewing Kindness to the Aboriginal Natives of <HI>America,</HI> may possibly, shew Kindness to <HI>Israelites</HI> unawares. In the Year 1649 Mr. <HI>Downam</HI> gave his Conjecture to that purpose, in his Appendix to <HI>New-English</HI> Letters then printed. And Mr. <HI>Thorowgood</HI> was so far satisfied in his Opinion about it, that he published a Treatise in the Year 1650. entituled <HI>Jews in America.</HI> And it should seem, many judicious Divines have been much of the same mind. Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> in his first Attempts to make them Christian, was much concernd to find out some Promise in the Scriptures relating to them, upon which he might ground his Faith and Hope in his incessant Labours for them: But afterward he concluded that the Thirty seventh
<PB REF="000813_0007_0FAA56BAF1B042B8"/>

In this Perswa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion that worthy Person, both liv'd, and dy'd. On the other hand, if <HI>America</HI> be laid out as a Rendezvous for <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog,</HI> this must needs tend to supersede all Desire and Endeavour for their Re∣covery. But better Things are hoped concerning them, even such as will issue in their Salvation, when the fullness of Time is come. In stead of being branded for <HI>Slaves</HI> with hot Irons in the Face,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Benzo</HI> p. 11, 14.</NOTE> and arms; and driven by scores in mortal Chains: they shall wear the Name of God in their foreheads, and they shall be delivered into the glorious Liberty of the Children of God. The <HI>Indians,</HI> upon various Occasions, do much affect to be called by a <HI>new</HI> Name: which is given them by the Ap∣probation of their Elders. Persons of note among them, that they may wash off their Mourning, and be clean; and that they may have a convenient Opportunity for publishing their New Name; sometimes call for a solemn Dance. Now tho their Miseries be very inveterate, yet GOD can speedily, and easily give them a <HI>New Name,</HI> and in a mom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>▪ change the Scene. <HI>Asia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>Europe</HI> have, each of them, had a glorious Gospel Day: None therefore will be grieved at any ones pleading that <HI>America</HI> may be made a <HI>Coparcener</HI> with her <HI>Sisters</HI> in the <HI>Free,</HI> and <HI>Soveraign Grace</HI> of God.

<P>NOT to begin to be; and so not to be limited by the concernments of <HI>Time,</HI> and <HI>Place</HI>; is the Prerogative of <HI>GOD</HI> alone. But as it is the Priviledge of Creatures, that <HI>GOD</HI> has given them a beginning: so to deny their <HI>acti∣ons,</HI> or <HI>them,</HI> the respect they bear to <HI>Place,</HI> and <HI>successive duration,</HI> is, under a pretence of Promo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, to take away their very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing. Yet notwithstanding, some Things have had this to glory of; that they have been time out of mind; and their Continuance refuses to be measured by the memory of Man. Whereas <HI>New-England,</HI> and <HI>Boston</HI> of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> have this to make mention of; that they can tell their Age; and account it their Honour to have their Birth, and Parentage kept in everlasting Remembrance. And in very deed, the Families, and Churches which first ventured to follow Christ thorow the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, into a strange Land, full of wild men, were so Religious; their End so Holy; their Selfdenyal in pursuing of it, so Extraordinary; that I can't but hope that the Plantation has thereby gaind a very strong Crasis; and that it will not be of one or two, or three Centuries only; but very long lasting. Some who peremptorily conclude that <HI>Asia</HI> must afford situation for <HI>New-Jerusalem,</HI> are of the mind, when that divine City comes to be built, the Commodities of It will be so inviting as will drain disconsolate <HI>America</HI> of all Its Christian Inhabitants, as not able to brook so remote a distance from the beloved City.

Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> was wont to say The <HI>New-English</HI> Churches are a preface to the New Heavens: and if so, I hope the preface and Book will be bound up together, and this <HI>Mexican</HI> Continent shall comprehend them both. Who can tell, but that <HI>David</HI> may thus fetch a compass behind his Antichristian enemies and come upon them over against the <HI>Mulberry</HI> trees, and utterly de∣stroy them by the brightness of his coming? Who can tell but that Christ may in this manner expose the lewd fondness of the Unholy War, and happily umpire the Difference about the holiness of Places by causing New Jerusalem to come down from God out of Heaven, upon that Earth wherein Satan, for many Ages, has peaceably posses∣sed an entire, and far more large empire than any where else in the whole world besides?

<P>'Twas most awfull to see, or but to hear of Christ's <HI>Spanish-Iron</HI> Rod walking amongst the earthen pots; whereby great Kingdoms, and Empires were quickly broken to shivers▪ with many millions of their subjects; unto whom both defensive, &amp; offensive Iron was unknown, which made the deadly impressions of their Enemies weapons, and the inefficacy of their own, surprising to amazement. It is to be no∣ted, that the Pots wherein they boiled their fish, and flesh, &amp;c. were made of earth; as also innumerable other vessels: most were enjoind to use no other. By this means the Potters trade was in principal demand among them: which renders this Metaphor very agreeable. In the computation of Time made by the <HI>Mexican</HI> Nation, their grea∣test Period consisted of Fifty two Years; which they call'd a <HI>VVheel.</HI> Upon the last night of every Wheel they used to break all their Ves∣sels, and stuff; and put out their fire, saying that the World should end at the finishing of one of these Wheels, and it might be at that time. Upon this conceipt they passed the night in great fear, and watched very carefully for the day. But when they saw the day be∣gin to break, they presently beat many Drumms, sounded Cornets, Flutes, and other Instruments of Joy, saying, that God did yet, pro∣long the time with another Age. And then began another Wheel, on the first day whereof they went to the high priest and took new fire, and bought new Vessels. <HI>Joseph Acosta,</HI> lib. 6. cap. 2. When the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came, they took these miserable Potters themselves, and dash'd them in pieces one against another.

<P>Neither is this altogether dissonant from excellent <HI>Calvin</HI>'s Com∣mentary.

Upon the 17<HI>th</HI> of <HI>August, anno</HI> 1503. a Ban∣quet of Wine was made in the Arbour of the <HI>Vatican [ad umbrosum Vaticani ruris fontem]</HI> for the poisoning of <HI>Adrian</HI> Cardinal of <HI>Cornette,</HI> or of some of the Richest Senators, as <HI>Onuphrius</HI> has it. <HI>Valentynois</HI> sent before, certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>agons with Wine Infected with Poison; which he gave to a servant that knew nothing of the matter, commanding that no person should touch them. The Pope coming by adventure, somwhat before the Supper, and overcome with the Drought, and immoderate heat of the time, calld for drink: and because his own provision was not yet brought from the Palace, he that had the in∣fected Wine in charge, thinking it to be commended to his keeping for a wine most excellent, gave the Pope to drink of the same wine which <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ynois</HI> had sent: who arriving whilest his father was drinking, drank also of the same wine; being but just, that they both should taste of the same Cup which they had brewed for the destruction of others. <HI>Valenti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is,</HI> by the vigour and strength of his Youth, and ready Help of strong Medicines, and Counterpoisons, had his Life saved; remaining notwithstandig oppressed with a long and grievous Sickness.

He out of an eager desire to get Riches, and Ho∣nour; did by the mediation of <HI>Gaspar Colligny</HI> the Admiral foremen∣tioned, obtain a Licence of the King to set forth a Fleet, and carry the <HI>French</HI> Ensigns into the New World. Upon the 13<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Novem∣ber,</HI> he arrived at the capacious Harbour, which by the <HI>Portugals</HI> is called <HI>Januarius,</HI> being in about 23. degrees of Southern Latitude. The Fortress erected there, he called <HI>Colligni</HI>; and that he might the more curry favour with the Admiral, he confirmd the hopes he had given that it was a convenient place for propagating the pure Religi∣gion; and petitioned that with his good leave he might send for some Divines from <HI>Geneva.</HI> And to that purpose, the next Year he writ to <HI>Calvin,</HI> who communicated it to the Elders; and after Con∣sultation upon the matter, two were chosen out of them; <HI>viz. Petrus Richerius,</HI> of fifty; and <HI>Gulielmus Quadrigarius,</HI> of thirty years of Age; who at the Request of <HI>Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lagagn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> and <HI>Col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igny,</HI> undertook the Voyage.

Religion, and was known to <HI>Colligny,</HI> by whose Letters he was soli∣cited to engage in this Affair, tending so much to the glory of God. At their Arrival in <HI>America,</HI> they were received with expressions of great Joy; and quickly after, their Church was formed according to the Costitution, and Usage of <HI>Geneva; Villagagnon</HI> going before them therein, and promising to submit thereunto. About the 20<HI>th</HI> of <HI>March,</HI> the Lord's Supper was admini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tred, <HI>Villagagnon</HI> himself being present. Afterward Controversies prevailed among them by means of <HI>John Cointac</HI> a student of <HI>Sorbonne,</HI> who cut of a fond con∣ceipt of his own Learning, was ambitious of a Superintendency over the other Ministers. He was of ill manners, and such a friend to An∣tichristian. Non-Residency, as not to be asham'd to hold a Benefice in <HI>France</HI> at the same time that he was such a stickler at <HI>Brasil.</HI> He moved that Sacerdotal Garments might be provided, the Vessels con∣secrated, Bread unleavened, and the Wine mingled with Water, and the like. <HI>Richers</HI> in his Sermon, inveighed against these humane In∣ventions and those that sought to introduce them; at which <HI>Villa∣gagnon</HI> was very angry, and silencd him: and, as is believed, being advis'd by a Letter from the Cardinal of <HI>Lorain,</HI> evil intreated the <HI>Geneva</HI> Ministers, and wearied them out, and their Company; who with much ado, through innumerable dangers, and almost starvd, at last got to <HI>France.</HI> They were about 18, or 20. Leagues at Sea, when they sprung a Leak; and the most part of their Bread was damnified with the salt water: and they could hardly free the Ship by pumping. Whereupon, lest they should want provisions for so long a Voyage, the Captain gave way to the desire of five of the Passengers, to re∣turn ashoar in the Boat: which their Company regretted, for fear <HI>Villagagnon</HI> should do them a displeasure. But they reckoned them∣selves safe, having not given him cause of Offence; but Obligation. And so with much grief on both sides they took Leave; commending each other to the Keeping of God. Now being unprovided of Mast, Sail, and all manner of Tackling for the Boat; and of Skill to ma∣nage it: twas with infinite difficulty and hazard, that they recovered the Land, and afterward, the Island and Fortress of <HI>Colligny.</HI> They speedily presented themselves to <HI>Villagagnon,</HI> and acquainted him with the Danger occasioning their Return: and prayd his Favour; forasmuch as they chose to dwell with their Countrymen; and not with <HI>Portugals,</HI> or <HI>Indians</HI>: and had left their Wives and Children, to serve him in this remote Land; which they were ready to do to the uttermost of their power, untill they might have opportunity of returning to <HI>France.</HI> The Governour spake them fair; praised God for their Deliverance: and said, that tho they left him upon discon∣tent,
<PB N="13" REF="000813_0020_0FAA56C5F1B82E10"/>
and were now fallen into his power; yet he would leave Ven∣geance to God, and by no means deny them Entertainment. How∣ever, he refused to let them make the best of their boat, to buy Ne∣cessaries for recovery of their impaired health. And within a while, was filld with Jealousies, lest all they had said was feigned; and that <HI>Corquillerius</HI> called <HI>du Pont, Richer</HI> and Company, with the help of those gon to the River of <HI>Plate,</HI> upon notice given, would in one night surprise the Fort, and destroy him and his. Whether these Fears were real or pretended; he came to a resolution to take them off as <HI>Traitors</HI>: But not finding how to make that Charge probable, he pitchd upon <HI>Religion,</HI> and drew up Articles for them to answer, as thinking such Sacrifices would be very pleasing to the Court. The <HI>French</HI> of the Continent perswaded them not to give an account of their Faith to this Apostat Tyrant: but that they should rather hide themselves among the <HI>Portugals,</HI> or <HI>Indians.</HI> But they were of Opi∣nion that God calld them to bear witness for Him, and accordingly, <HI>John Bordel,</HI> who exceeded the rest in Learning and Grace, as well as in Age, drew up in writing a Confession of Faith, containing an An∣swer to the Articles. This they all read often, and distinctly weigh∣ed each Article; and then all signd it. It begins thus: <HI>According to the Doctrine of St</HI> Peter <HI>the Apostle, in his first Epistle; all Christians ought always to be ready to give an account of the Hope that is in them, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Conclusion of their Confession is in these words, <HI>This is the Answer which we have made to the Articles sent by you, according to the measure and portion of Faith which God hath given us. Let Him be pleased to cause that it may not dye in us; but may produce fruits worthy of his Children. He giving us Perseverance in the same, we will ascribe Praise and Thanks unto Him to all Eternity. Amen.</HI></P>

<P>When their Orthodox Confession was sent to <HI>Villagagnon,</HI> he de∣clared them Hereticks upon the Articles relating to the Sacrament of the <HI>Altar,</HI> and Vows; and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id twas unlawfull for them to live any longer, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the Company should be infected with their Poison.

Their friends with tears disswaded them from going to their slaughter. But they considering that God
<PB N="14" REF="000813_0021_0FAA56C6D4EB4920"/>
might have brought them into those parts, and preserved them in millions of dangers for this end; could not find in their hearts to de∣sert the Cause of their dear Lord Jesus: So <HI>John Bordel, Matthew Vermeil,</HI> and <HI>Andrew la Fon</HI> went into the boat: But <HI>Peter Bourdon</HI> was left behind very sick. Being come to the Island, <HI>Villagagnon</HI> commanded that they should be brought before him, who holding thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Confession of Faith in his hand, asked if they made and signed it. They answered that they made it and signd it, every one own∣ing his Hand; and seeing it was according to the Confession of the holy Apostles and Martyrs of the primitive Church, they were resol∣ved, by the Grace of God, to maintain it. Their words were scarce out, before <HI>Villagagnon</HI> discoverd a furious countenance, threatening to put them to death, if they continued in their damnable Opinion. And presently commanded his Executioner to put Irons on their Legs; and to every Chain to hang fifty, or sixty pound weight: and orderd them to be shut up in a nasty dark Prison, and set a Guard of armed men upon them. They comforted one another in Prayer &amp; singing of Psalms. All the Company of the Island was very much troubled at this action, and secretly comforted the Prisoners, and gave them provisions which they stood in need of. The next day in the morning, he went well armd, with a page, into a little Hall, whither he sent for <HI>John Bordel</HI> in his Irons; of whom he demanded an explanation of the article of the Sacrament, He confessed that the Bread and Wine were Signs of the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, confirming it by the saying of St <HI>Augustin. Villag.</HI> in a great passion, gave him a blow on the face with his fist; whereupon much blood flowed from his nose and mouth. To the blow he added words agreeable; <HI>You have lyed, Villain, St</HI> Austin <HI>never said so: Be∣fore I eat, I will reward the fruits of your Obstinacy.</HI> As some tears fell with the blood, <HI>Vil.</HI> upbraided him, calling hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a puny fresh water souldier, that would cry for a fillip! Then he a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked him if he would maintain what he had writ and signd. <HI>Bordel</HI> answered, Yes, untill by Authority of the holy Scriptures I am otherwise taught. <HI>V.</HI> see∣ing the stedfastness of the man, commanded his Executioner to bind him, and carry him to a Rock which the water coverd twice a day, three foot. He and his page being armd, attended the poor Sufferer to the place appointed. <HI>Bordel</HI> passing by the prison where his com∣panions were, cryed out to them, with a loud Voice, <HI>Be of good Cou∣rage, you will quickly be delivered from this miserable life.</HI> As he went along, he sung Psalms, to the astonishment of bloody <HI>V.</HI> and his Exe∣cutioner. Being upon the Rock, twas with much adoe that he got leave to commend himself to God in prayer, before he went out of
<PB N="15" REF="000813_0022_0FAA56C7329F0BA0"/>
the world. The Executioner being too slow for furious <HI>V.</HI> he threa∣tend him with a cat of nine tails, if he did not make haste: therefore he immediatly threw him into the Sea, where he rendred to God his Spirit, calling upon the Name of our Lord Jesus till he was drownd.</P>
<P><HI>Matthew Vermeil</HI> was brought next, being greatly astonished at the death of his companion, he pleaded with <HI>V.</HI> for his life with such Ex∣postulations, Have we robbed you, or evilly entreated the least of your servants? Have we plotted your death, or done any thing to your dishonour? No Villain! said he; you and your companions dye for no such things as these; but because you are a most dange∣rous Pest to be separated from the Church, lest you spoil the rest of my company. The Martyr answered, Eight moneths are not pas∣sed since you made an ample confession of the Points for which you make us dye this day. Afterward he petitioned him again for his life, offering to become his servant. <HI>V.</HI> said he had nothing for him to do: but he would think of it, if he would recant his Error. <HI>Ver∣meil</HI> seeing no hope given him, but what was destructive to his Sal∣vation, became thereby resolv'd in his mind, and Cryed out with a loud Voice, <HI>I had rather dye, to live eternally with the LORD: than to live a little while, and dye for ever with Satan.</HI> After he had made his Prayer upon the Rock, and commended his Soul to the Care of God, he freely delivered himself into the hands of the Executioner; and Crying out with a loud Voice, <HI>Lord Jesus! have mercy on me!</HI> He gave up the ghost. <HI>Andrew la Fon</HI> had not strength enough to climb up into this Rock of Martyrdom: but by Promises &amp; Threa∣tenings, was drawn to some degree of Recantation: Or else was fa∣voured by <HI>Villagagnon</HI> for the sake of his Trade of a Tailor, which was very necessary. And so his life was spared.</P>
<P>But the bloody Sacrifice of <HI>Vil.</HI> is not yet ended: One Victim re∣mains; <HI>viz. Peter Bourdon,</HI> who was left very sick on the Continent. Villagagnon went himself thither, took one ashoar with him. His first salutation to the poor sick man was that he must get up, and go into the boat. <HI>Bourdon</HI> would have excused himself, from his ina∣bility to do him any service by reason of sickness. Villagagnon told him, this was to cure him. The poor man not being able to stand, much less go; he caused him to be carried aboard. Villagagnon ask∣ed whether he would stand to the Confession he had signd. He an∣swered, he would consider of it. As soon as they came ashoar, the Executioner bound him without any more adoe, advertising him to have a care of his Conscience. <HI>Bourden</HI> supposing that to be the place where his companions obtained the Victory over death; he re∣commended his soul to God, and Cryed with a loud Voice, <HI>Lord
<PB N="16" REF="000813_0023_0FAA56C930957060"/>

I am of the same Paste with my Companions, who maintained th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Combat for thy Name, with glory and honour: I pray Thee, shew me Fa∣vour, that I may not succumb amidst the Allurements of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ian, the World, and the Flesh. I pray Thee, pardon all my Transgressions &amp; Offences that I have committed against thy Majesty: and this in the Name of thy wel-beloved Son, our Lord.</HI> Having prayed thus, he turned himself to∣wards Villagagnon, and asked him for what he was to dye. For signing an he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tical and scandalous Confession, said Villagagnon. When he asked upon what point, he was declared an heretick; Vil∣lagagnon told him it was no time to dispute, but to look to his Con∣science: and bid the Executioner make haste. <HI>Bourdon</HI> seeing that Divine and humane Laws were as it were buried, being very reso∣lute, he submitted himself to the Executioner; and calling for the Help and Favour of God, he dyed in the Lord. This Tragoedy was ended about ten in the morning. After which, Villagagnon exhorted the people to avoid the Sect of the <HI>Lutherans</HI>; with which he himself was once infected, to his great grief. He threatened death to the obstinat; saying, that every one ought to observe what their fathers religiously taught them. This day he commanded plen∣ty of Provisions to be given to the Artificers and Labourers, in token of Rejoicing. He had written to some Courtiers, that if they would not blame him for carrying Preaching into <HI>Brasil,</HI> what great matte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s he would do against the Ministers; promising to silence them. After this great Cruelty, his Affairs went every day to wreck: Returning to <HI>France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>French put to the sword by the Portugals.

And white Robes were given unto every one of them</HI>] The very material garments in which they commonly suffered, were of that Colour. And these words seem to be meant of the Justice done to the Memory of these slain Martyrs, by the True and Uni∣versal Histories that were written of Them about this time, whereby they were vindicated from the Reproaches of their beastly Pursuers; and had their Proper Character given them. Their filthy garments and Crowns painted with Devils, were taken off from them; and Fair Mitres were set upon their Heads, and they were clothed with change of Raiment. So much as might be, a particular Account was given of each ones Birth, Education, Employment, and Causes of Suffering. <HI>Illyricus,</HI> his <HI>Catalogus Testium Veritatis</HI> was printed at <HI>Basil</HI> 1556. About the same time <HI>John Crispin, Beza</HI>'s intimat friend, writ the <HI>French</HI> Martyrology at <HI>Geneva</HI>; which has been very much enlar∣ged, a compleat and excellent Composure: And tis remarkable, that the words of <HI>Rev.</HI> 6.9, 10. are set before us in the Title-page. <HI>John Fox</HI> began his universal History of Martyrs, at <HI>Basil,</HI> during his exile there; and perfected it at <HI>London,</HI> after his return. At first, he writ in <HI>Latine,</HI> and sent the Copy to <HI>Basil</HI> to be printed, where the Work is in great Estimation; as also in dive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s other foreign Nations. <HI>Le∣gatur Martyrologium Job.

mentioned <HI>Rev.</HI> 15.5. precedes that mentioned <HI>Rev.</HI> 11.19. some hundreds of Years. The Temple <HI>Rev.</HI> 15.5. is the Temple of the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> of the <HI>Testimony. Tabernacle</HI>] intimating its ambulatory, and movable condition; taken down in one place, and set up in ano∣ther, according to the holy, wise, and soveraign Pleasure and Provi∣dence of God: And this may be spoken in contradistinction to the Temple <HI>Rev.</HI> 11.19. wherein God will settle his Abode, <HI>Psal.</HI> 46.4.</P>
<P><HI>Testimony</HI>] The Sack-cloth Witnesses are the constituent parts of this Temple; which for the first Ages of it, was more closely shut, and less visible: and began now to be more open, when the Com∣missioners of the Sack-cloth Testimony stood forth, in order to the execution of their Charge. On the other hand, the Church <HI>Revel.</HI> 11.19. is called the Temple of GOD, intimating that God had a more visible, avowed, and immediat Hand in building this Temple. As the <HI>New-Jerusalem</HI> is said to come down from God out of Hea∣ven. It may also imply the Excellency and Glory of this Church above the former.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Ostendit aper∣tum SPONSI Patrocinium.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brightman Cantic.</HI> 6.2. <HI>fol.</HI> 105.</P></NOTE> And therefore God will avowedly and plainly Own this Church to be His, by his Wonder-working Providence in the face of the whole World. Whereas God did but privatly, and partially favour the other. And that, many times, Not to save them from death (The Witnesses must be slain) but to strengthen them, and inable them to dye Triumphing. As it fared with Christ their Head. In this Divine Temple, <HI>the Ark of the Covenant is Seen:</HI> There's another difference. Mr. <HI>Mede</HI> conjectures it may be meant of Christ's Personal Appearance. See lib. 5. cap. 11. P. 1114. However, then it will satisfactorily and plainly appear to the Saints, that God in Christ, is a God Keeping Covenant; a God of Truth, Fullfilling every good Word He hath spoken concer∣ning his Chosen, and concerning his Enemies. Then, and not till then, will it fully appear, that God is a faithfull Keeper of that Co∣venant recorded <HI>Jerem.</HI> 31.31. and <HI>Heb.</HI> 8.8. The Israelites had indeed served <HI>Baal,</HI> and not <HI>Jehovah</HI>: Therefore it was fit that God should carry it towards them as <HI>Baal</HI> did to his prophets, 1 <HI>Kings,</HI> 18.26. — 29. But now, God will of his bounteous Grace provide, that there shall be no more National, permanent Apostasie.</P>
<P>For the Confirmation of what has been said, take a few words of my ever honoured Master, the late Reverend, Learned and Holy Mr. <HI>Thomas Parker,</HI> in a Manuscript of his upon <HI>Isai.</HI> 60. <HI>Nova Hierosolyma quae hic describitur, est ipsa</HI> Philadelphiensis <HI>Ecclesia, quoad antitypum, inchoata a temporibus</HI> Wiclefi; <HI>ante cujus pedes adorabunt om∣nes ipsius inimici, in compensationem Patientiae, qua sustinuerat Opprobrium antegressum tempora</HI> Wiclefi; <HI>et qua sustinuerat Opprobrium &amp; Persecutiones

<P>Upon these grounds, the forementioned Objection ceaseth to be cogent with me. And I am so far from thinking that no Vial is yet poured forth; that I am apt to conclude, that no less than Five ANGELS have already poured out their Vials. So many guesses have been made about the Subject of the Fourth Vial; that if I do enter a claim for the Sun of <HI>Persecution,</HI> I shall no more incur the danger of being extravagant, than some that have gone before me. Certainly, that is the Sun that consolidates and cherishes the Anti-christian State. As for the Fifth Vial; <HI>Bullinger, Brightman, Forbes, Pareus, Mede,</HI> and Company Interpreters of the <HI>Revelaton,</HI> have poured that to purpose. As also Dr. <HI>Whitaker,</HI> The Author of the History of the Council of <HI>Trent, Chamier, Robert Parker,</HI> Dr. <HI>Ames,</HI> Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> cum multis Alijs. And seeing the Tower of <HI>Babel</HI> hath no other foundation than the Uncertain Vanity of the Apostle <HI>Pe∣ter</HI>'s having been at <HI>Rome: Uldaricus Velenus</HI> did the <HI>Babylonians</HI> a sin∣gular displeasure in writing a Treatise to prove that He was never there. <HI>Bellarmin. de Pontif. lib▪</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 1. The truth is, except their <HI>Index expurgatorius</HI> be enlarged with many Clauses of Scripture, the Probability lies on <HI>Velenus</HI> his side; Ten to One. And <HI>Bellarmin</HI>'s arguing from <HI>Peter</HI>'s Tomb, is unsound. For it was customary at <HI>Rome,</HI> to make Funeral Solemnitys, and erect Monuments for persons dying abroad. <HI>Alcyone</HI> resolved to pay that Respect to her husband <HI>Ceyx,</HI> who was lost at Sea. <HI>Ovid</HI> Metamor. lib. 11. &amp; lib. 12. princip.

How easy was it for the modern <HI>Romans</HI> to make use of this Custom when it might serve their turn. Moreover if this Vial partly intends Impressions to be made upon the City of <HI>Rome</HI> it self; yet we need not wait longer for them. There was a jostling between <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1527.</NOTE> and <HI>Clement</HI> the Bishop. The Emperours Army in their march towards <HI>Naples,</HI> wanting both Pay, and Provisions; <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> was fain to calm them, by promising the Liberty of furnishing themselves at <HI>Rome.</HI> Upon the fifth of <HI>May,</HI> 1527 They

incamped in a meadow near the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> From thence He sent a Trumpet to the Pope, to demand passage for his Army through the City, in his way to <HI>Naples.</HI> The next morning, <HI>May,</HI> 6. at break of day▪ He drew near the Suburbs, by way of the Mountain, and <HI>Santo Spirito</HI>; wherein he was favoured by a very thick Mist; which rising before day, and increasing with degrees of Fogg and thickness, became such a Covert to the whole Camp, that his Souldiers were not discerned till they were near the place where they began a furi∣ous Assault. The Noble Duke marched in the head of his Troops, carrying a scaling Ladder in his hand; and was unhappyly slain with an Harquebuse shot. <HI>Philibert</HI> of <HI>Chalon</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> cau∣sing his body to be covered with a cloak, maintained the Charge very vigorously, and by dint of Sword forced his Entrance. The defendents fled before him; their Fear being far above any other sense or passion in them; and the Suburbs were entirely abandoned, and left a prey to the Conquerours. <HI>Clement</HI> was in the Palace of the <HI>Vatican,</HI> expecting the issue;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fondly trusting to his Excom∣munication of Bourbon and the Army.</HI></NOTE> who hearing that the Enemies were en∣tered, discovered his Passions of Fear and frailty; and with certain Cardinals presently betook himself to the Castle of St <HI>Angelo.</HI> He was in doubt whether it were best to abide there; or to retire to some place of greater surety. In the mean time, <HI>Berard de Padoa,</HI> who was fled from the Imperial Army, certified the Pope, that the Duke of <HI>Bourbon</HI> the General was dead, and that their Courage was thereby so much abated, that they desired an Accord with him: in which matter they sent out men to parly with the Principals. On the day following, while the Pope was in this perplexity, not knowing what course to take; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> seeing neither Order, nor Coun∣sel to defend the Quarter beyond <HI>Tiber,</HI> entered without any Resi∣stance; and the same evening, they entered by the bridge <HI>Xisto,</HI> into the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> where all was turned into Flight, and Confusion. For want of great Artillery, the first Dispute was sharp; in which there fell of the Imperialists One Thousand. Being exasperated by this Loss, and the death of their General; they slew and put to the Sword Four Thousand. In their pillaging, small regard was had to Friends or Favourites; much less was respected the Authority of Cardinals and Prelates, tho of their own Nation; Or the Dignity of Rich Temples, Relicks, Dedications. It is hard to particularise the greatness of the Prey. But that which made the Spoil infinite in Value, was the Quality and great number of Prisoners, Redeemed with most rich and huge Ransoms. The Launceknights, being <HI>Ger∣mans</HI> and favourers of <HI>Luther</HI>; bore no good will to the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> These took prisoners certain Prelates, whom they apparelled

with the Habits and marks of their Dignities, and then set them up∣on Asses and lean Mules, with their faces reversed to the crowpe of the beasts; and so led them through the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> upbraiding &amp; terrifying of them with the Name of <HI>Luther.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Symonds on the Fifth Vial p.</HI> 251.</NOTE> Many of them they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iously tormented; so that some first yielded a Ransom, and then their Lives. The Cardinal of <HI>Sienna</HI> compounded with the <HI>Spaniards</HI>; and was afterward made prisoner by the Launceknights, who made booty of his Palace, and then led him all naked with buffets and ba∣stinados, into the borough. He was driven to redeem his life out of their hands with a promise of five thousand Ducats. The Cardinals <HI>Minerva</HI> and <HI>Ponsaro</HI> payed the Ransom they were rated at, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter they had been in a vile Spectacle carried in Procession through the Town of <HI>Rome.</HI> One called the Cardinal <HI>Sanctorum quatuor,</HI> or Car∣dinal of <HI>Pouch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fox, <HI>Vol.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 199, 202.</NOTE> was slain. To these Stroaks was superadded that of the Plague, which invaded the City and Souldiers at the same time; and made its Entrance also into the impregnable Castle of St <HI>Angelo,</HI> to the great danger of the Popes life: about whom died certain spe∣cial Men who did service to his person. The Pope was at last so far meekened by the complication of many pressing Calamities attending a strait Siege, as to be brought to a Composition with the Imperia∣lists. He was to make present payment of threescore thousand Du∣cats to the Launceknights; and to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> thirty and five thou∣sand: This being done, they were to set him at liberty with all the Cardinals. Within three moneths after, other like great Sums were to be paid to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and Launceknights, according to their portions; which together with the Sums that had been paid, amoun∣ted to more than three hundred and fifty thousand Ducats. That he might make these Payments, and deliver himself from the heavy yoke of his Imprisonment, he created certain Cardinals for Money, of whom the most part, for their Learning or Vertue, were Unworthy so great Honour. The Cardinals <HI>Cesis</HI> and <HI>Ursin</HI> were delivered to the Souldiers as Hostages, who were led by the Cardinal <HI>Colonno</HI> to <HI>Grottaferara.</HI> And so all things having their orderly Expedition, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were to guard him to a place of Surety the tenth of <HI>Decem∣ber.</HI> But he fearing some variation or ill Accident, stole away out of the Castle the night before, in the habit of a Merchant, and was guarded to <HI>Orvietto.</HI> The Souldiers satisfied of all their Payments from the time of the Pope's delivery, with forty thousand Ducats over and above, as imprest money for two days, they marched out of <HI>Rome</HI> the 17<HI>th</HI> day of <HI>February,</HI> a day which had been most joyfull, and of special Respira<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion to the wretched people of <HI>Rome</HI>; if their Calamities, which they supposed to be ended by the depar∣ture

By reason of these Calami∣ties, grievous for their continuance, and lamentable for their wretch∣ed Succession; descending from one Enemy that was <HI>ill,</HI> to another that was <HI>worse,</HI> the City of <HI>Rome</HI> was not only made naked of a great part of her Inhabitants, with the desolation of many houses and Pala∣ces: but also it stood rent and defaced in Images of ancient and wor∣thy presence. <HI>&amp;c.

The Cardinals that were in <HI>Italy</HI> made a motion, that as well they as the other Cardinals beyond the Mounts, might assemble together at <HI>Avignion,</HI> to take Counsel in so troublesom a time, what course to hold for the stability of the Church. But because they would not all at one time, range themselves under the power of so mighty Princes, they declined it. The Pope's chief hope was in <HI>Francis</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King, who had been Caesars Prisoner but a little before; and now the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> were in his hand as Hostages. Which rendred his motions slow and irregular, as of a person in Fetters. So that Monsieur <HI>Lawtrech</HI> commander of the Leaguers Army advanced not so far as <HI>Rome.</HI> And <HI>Tiber</HI> by its Overflowing, incommoded a Party of their Men.

By such means it came to pass that the Imperial Army had no less than Nine Moneths time to pil∣lage <HI>Rome.</HI> Where the Pope contrary to his custom, his nature, and
<PB N="24" REF="000813_0031_0FAA56CEB904B5D0"/>
all expectation, did not only constantly remain; but being confident of defending the City, he did not only forbid <HI>Men</HI> to go away; but also made an Ordinance that no <HI>Goods</HI> should be carried out; which Merchants and Artificers would have secured by sending them down the River. <HI>Ea Nocte nihil unquam lugubrius aut funestius</HI> Roma <HI>vidit,</HI> saith <HI>Onuphrius</HI> in the life of <HI>Clement,</HI> p. 382. col 2. Now if one or two Kings did so far waste <HI>Rome</HI> by the by, and as it were in Jest: When the Seventh Vial's Turn comes, the Ten Kings will do it per∣fectly, and with a Vengeance. For <HI>Rome</HI> will be reserved till then, <HI>Ut sentiat se mori.</HI> If the Papists object the death of the Duke of <HI>Bourbon:</HI> That Loss was well repaired by the Choice of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> in his stead; by which means <HI>Rome</HI>'s Night was made more dark, and came on the faster. And <HI>Johannes Medices,</HI> one of the chief Commanders on <HI>Clement</HI>'s side, fell also by a shot. Even Mon∣sieur <HI>Lawtrech,</HI> the Pope's deliverer, died in the Camp not very long after; and most of his Army was swept away by the Plague. Not above three Years after, the River <HI>Tiber</HI> received a Commission to make some considerable addition to the Ruine of <HI>Rome. Tiberis alve∣um egressus magis quam ad eam diem hominum memoria, vel vetustis monu∣mentis relatum esset, Urbem inundavit, incredibili cum Romanorum damno, et aedium detrimento.</HI> Onuphr. p. 384. col. 1.</P>
<P>Upon all, or some of these Considerations, it seems to me probable that Five of the Vials are already poured out. Not but that they hold on their course still; and will do so, untill the Confluence of them all do with irresistible Force ingulf Antichristianisme in utter Ruine. The truth is, all the Vials may in some sence be said to have been poured out together at the beginning of this Period of <HI>Rome</HI>'s gradual Decay. Yet there are critical Times, and characteristical passages of divine Providence, wherein each Vial obtains the successive Regen∣cy app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inted them of Christ. And the Sixth Angel seems now to stand ready with his Vial, waiting only for the Word to be given for the pouring of it out The pouring out of this Vial will dry up the Antichristian Interests in the New World: and thereby prepare the way for the Kings of the East. This is agreeable to the analogy of Interpretation generally given by the Ancients; and more lately by <HI>Bullinger, Pare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Cowper,</HI> and many others. Only as <HI>Euphrates</HI> is one individual River, so tis suitable to limit it to this Continent; thereby to keep it as it were within its banks. There is an harmony between the Third and Sixth Vials. In the pouring out of that, the Antichristian Rivers were made bloody, by the Civil, and Military Sword: By the pouring out of this, the Great River is wholly dryed up; so that Nothing of it is left remaining to make <HI>Babylon</HI> glad.
<PB N="25" REF="000813_0032_0FAA56CF7681B858"/>
Consequently, the <HI>Armagedduntine</HI> Expedition will some way resem∣ble that of 1588. Only it will be much greater, and more fatal to the principal Undertakers. Mr. <HI>Brightman</HI> couples <HI>Revelation,</HI> 16.16. with <HI>Daniel,</HI> 11.45. So that if the genuine sence of that place hath been given, we know where to look for the drying up of <HI>Euphrates.</HI> And to make the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire the subject of the Sixth Vial, seems heterogeneous: For <HI>Euphrates</HI> must needs be parcel of the Waters upon which the Whore sits at the time when this great River comes to be dried up: Which the Sun of Righteousness will do, by cau∣sing so much of her dominion to cease for ever. The Pope and his followers, by warring against the <HI>Turk,</HI> do not dry up <HI>Euphrates</HI>: but do inlarge the <HI>Papal,</HI> by the diminution of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire. And although the passing away of the second Wo be matter of uni∣versal Joy; yet to make it to be the drying up of <HI>Euphrates,</HI> seems hard: For the Sixth Vial doth not carry off an <HI>Old</HI> Plague; but brings on a <HI>New</HI> one. Neither did I ever hear that the Reformed Churches fared so much the better for the taking of <HI>Buda,</HI> as to make me think that <HI>Euphrates</HI> was then partly dried up. Moreover this is a new accommodation. The first that I find of it, is in Mr. <HI>Fox,</HI> p. 373. Probably, if he had met with it before, he would have men∣tiond it; that being his professed design, Praefat. p. 6. But he ac∣knowledgeth Interpreters went another way, and endeavours to re∣fute them. <HI>Pareus</HI> speaks thus, <HI>Neque nova vel recens a nobis excogitata est haec interpretatio. Eandem enim ANONYMUS meus ante</HI> 260. <HI>annos expressit his verbis, &amp;c. col.</HI> 839. The inconsistency of this Opinion with <HI>Mede</HI>'s <HI>Hypotheses,</HI> makes not a little against it. He himself seems to be put upon bending the fourth, to make it conform; <HI>aut saltem quod bestiae saluti innexum, ejusque interest. p.</HI> 656. Although so great a Pilot's taking this path, was an extraordinary prejudice; yet many learned Expositours have still chosen to go in that which was the beaten Road in Mr. <HI>Fox</HI>'s time; and, as I suppose, was, and is the KING's high Way. Mend but the Chronology of <HI>Alcasar,</HI>s dream, and what he hath written upon the Sixth Vial, becomes a very good <HI>Protestant</HI> Exposition; <HI>Etenim repente, et praeter opinionem, alius uxorem propriam esse Christianam deprehendit, alius filiam, fratres alius, alius cog∣natos &amp; affines; ac demum omnes pariter animadverterunt Christianam Fidem sese in mediam</HI> Romam, <HI>et in ipsas eorum domos insinuasse, atque adeo vix aliquam esse super, quo non coelestis ille penetrasset Ignis, quem Christus in terra accensurus advenit. p.</HI> 730.

<P>But what shall we say, if the Stone which these Builders have re∣fused, should be made the Head of the Corner? <HI>Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.</HI> Or if it be not made a Corner-stone: that it should be quite thrown by, and not be at all laid in the Building: is more than can be proved from the Scriptures.

To tedder the Scriptures, and tie them to the <HI>Herculean</HI> Pillars; takes off all the Lustre of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Motto, <HI>PLUS ULTRA</HI>; and makes the Glory of it to dwindle away to very nothing. But the Word of God is not bound. To go about to do it, is, I fear, to limit the Holy One of Israel; and injuriously to spoil the Church of that Doxology, <HI>In God will I praise the Word: in the Lord will I praise the Word.

Altho the Author be incomparably more than my Match; yet the Honour of being a Re∣tainer to my Noble Lord <HI>Say</HI>; Love to my Country; and the Ad∣vantage, as I apprehend, on my side, do prompt me to the Under∣taking.

<P><HI>Ambitu suo Gentes</HI>] The Church consists not of Gentiles only.

Whatsoever else is spoken, must be only in explanation of this; or it will be perfectly blasphemous Nonsence. Upon which consideration, me thinks <HI>tantillum,</HI> and <HI>Sponsa AGNI,</HI> do not stand well together in the same chapter. However, we are beholden to this great and worthy Author, for his concurrent Testimony, that the <HI>Jews</HI> are the People intended in the sixteenth, and nineteenth Chapters. <HI>Pari ratione</HI>] May it not with more, or equal strength be argued, <HI>New-Jerusalem</HI> is not the same with <HI>Jerusalem:</HI> but as <HI>Je∣rusalem</HI> was to the westward of <HI>Babylon</HI>; so <HI>New-Jerusalem</HI> must be to the westward of <HI>Rome</HI>; to avoid disturbance in the Order of these Mysteries.

whereby all <HI>Jews,</HI> which inhabited in <HI>Castile,</HI> or <HI>Leon,</HI> were enjoined to turn to the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, and to be baptized within three Moneths; on pain of having their Goods cofiscat, and perpetual Ba∣nishment. By this means the miserable People were brought into Great Perplexity. The most religious of them took counsel in the three moneths space of delay before they were to leave the Country; and found means to send away their Money and chief Goods out of <HI>Spain</HI>; wherein they were aided by many honest-minded Christians; who did help to hide them. Others, who valued their ease, Native-Country, and Goods, above all other matters; were baptised, and made profession of the Christian Religion. And in process of time, the noble Families of <HI>Spain</HI> allied themselves by Marriage, to that Race. <HI>Grimeston, Hist. Spain, p.</HI> 946, 947. This was called the great Dispersion.

<P>The very same Year, 1492. <HI>Christopher Columbus</HI> found out the New World for <HI>Castile</HI> and <HI>Leon.</HI> And altho the New World was not yet made ready for the Entertainment of the ejected <HI>Jews</HI>; or else the <HI>Jews</HI> were not yet fit to dwell in a place of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Own: Yet considering the <HI>Synchronisme</HI> of this Banishment, and Discovery; with the marvellous Perplexity the distressed Outcasts were in, not know∣ing whither to go: As also the great Gain that this Navigation af∣forded; the hopes some might conceive of managing themselves more safely with their feigned Religion, which they had not proved, in a remote Place, than at home: Considering also the mixture of those Nations by Inter Marriages; and that the greatest and best par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>America</HI> is peopled by <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and <HI>Portugals:</HI> It is not impro∣bable, but many Jews may reside there, tho covered with a <HI>Spanish</HI> Vail <HI>Manasseh Ben Israel, Downam, Thorowgood, Eliot,</HI> and others were of Opinion that <HI>America</HI> was first peopled by the Ten Tribes.

it is no Haeresie to say, Christ meant the Ten Tribes, <HI>John,</HI> 10.16. alluding to <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37.22, 24. cap. 37. p. 462. If it be no Haeresie to say, the Ten Tribes are the <HI>Sheep</HI>: Why should it be accounted Hae∣resie to say, <HI>America</HI> is the distinct <HI>Fold</HI> there implied? For Christ doth not affirm that there shall be one <HI>Fold</HI>; but that there shall be ONE FLOCK, ONE SHEPHERD! But however it might be when Mr. <HI>Mede</HI> writ, Now it is manifest to all, that very considera∣ble Numbers of <HI>Jews</HI> are seated in the New World; where they merchandize, have their <HI>Synagogues,</HI> and places of <HI>Burial.</HI> At <HI>Spikes</HI>'s in <HI>Barbados,</HI> there is a Street called <HI>Jews</HI> Street; tho most live at the <HI>Bridge</HI>; and there is the <HI>Burying-Place</HI> for both Towns. At <HI>Jamaica</HI> there are a great many; and <HI>Port-Royal</HI> also hath its <HI>Jews</HI> Street; by the same Token, that the Formidable Earthquake left that standing; tho their Synagogue, which stood in another Street, was thrown down by it. This Earthquake happened upon the Third day of the Week, about a Quarter of an hour before Noon; being the Seventh of <HI>June,</HI> 1692. A very great Treasure of Merchandise, and of Silver, and Gold, then perished. Many Houses were swallowed up; others thrown down; at the <HI>Point,</HI> and over the Island; especially such as were built of Stone and Brick. A very fair Church at <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt-Royal</HI>▪ and another newly built at <HI>Ligania,</HI> were turned into heaps of Rubbish.

Upon this occasion, the Prodigious Earthquakes of <HI>Lima,</HI> in <HI>Peru,</HI> of <HI>Sicilia,</HI> and <HI>Naples,</HI> might be mentioned: but that the Di∣gression would seem too long. Only it may be noted, that they are all <HI>Spanish:</HI> and that there was but the distance of seven Moneths be∣tween this of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and the most Dreadful EARTHQUAKE of <HI>Sicilia:</HI> For that was sent in <HI>January</HI> following, upon the Lord's day, being New-Years day, according to the <HI>Julian</HI> Account.

Frazon</HI> was sometime Scholar to the learned <HI>Yeosuah Da Sylva,</HI> in <HI>Lon∣don.</HI> They acquaint me, that the <HI>Jews</HI> were formerly very numerous in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Plantations in <HI>Brasil:</HI> their Father and Grandfather did dwell there. <HI>Olinda</HI> was taken by the <HI>Dutch, Anno</HI> 1629. how soon the <HI>Jews</HI> followed them thither, I am not certain. But upon the Surrender of those Places to the <HI>Portugals,</HI> they were dispersed. Yet at <HI>Suranam,</HI> and <HI>Curasso,</HI> there are plenty of them still.

<P>These are the Sentiments of Mr. <HI>Nicolas Fuller</HI> concerning the New World, and them that dwell therein; both as to what is past, and to come. If they do but outlive the springing of this Mine, they are like to be out of danger of any further design this Chapter hath upon them. This learned Man, agreeable to his great Ingenuity, endea∣vours to do <HI>Columbus</HI> the Justice, as to eternize his Honour, by engra∣ving his Name upon the World of his Discovery. <HI>It is every where called</HI> America: <HI>but according to Truth, and Desert; men should rather call it</HI> Columbina, <HI>from the magnanimous Heroe</HI> Christopher Columbus <HI>a</HI> Genuese, <HI>who was manifestly Appointed of GOD to be the Finder out of these Lands.</HI> But why should a learned Man make all this <HI>Dirige</HI> for <HI>Columbus</HI>'s Name! What matter is it how <HI>America</HI> be called? For <HI>Flavio</HI> of <HI>Malphi</HI> in <HI>Naples</HI> hath, in great measure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1300.</NOTE> applied the Vertues of the Loadstone to the Mariners Compass, <HI>in Vain</HI>; the <HI>Portugals</HI> have found the length of <HI>Africa</HI>'s foot, <HI>in Vain</HI>; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> sent out the <HI>Italian</HI> Dove, <HI>in Vain</HI>; Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> hath sailed round the World, and made thorow Lights to it, <HI>in Vain</HI>; and <HI>Hakluyt</HI> and <HI>Purchas</HI> have, with endless Labour, acquainted <HI>Englishmen</HI> with these Things, in Vain: If after all, we go about to turn the <HI>American Eu∣phrates</HI> into a <HI>Stygian</HI> Lake! The breaking of this One Instrument, spoils us of the long expected, and much desired Consort of Musick.</P>
<P>Another thing that Mr. <HI>Fuller</HI> drives at, is, he would fain have it believ'd, that <HI>America</HI> was first peopled by the Posterity of our Great Grandfather <HI>JAPHETH</HI>; tho he will not be very strict with us, as to the particular branch of that Wide Family; as the Breadth of his <HI>Parenthesis</HI> shews.

nor heirs of his Curse: as some have guessed. That Obstacle is re∣moved out of the way of their Conversion. And by this Argument it may be more firmly proved that <HI>Englishmen</HI> shall be <HI>Gog</HI> &amp; <HI>Magog:</HI> for without controversie, they are originally <HI>Cimbrians,</HI> as <HI>Pontanus</HI> af∣firms.<NOTE PLACE="marg">428.</NOTE> <HI>Rerum Danic.

<P>As for the confounding of the <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog</HI> in the <HI>Revelation,</HI> with <HI>Ezekiel</HI>'s; the confusion which our Author would have others avoid; he himself seems partly to fall into, in making the <HI>Americans Magogiticae gentis colonias:</HI> seeing <HI>John</HI> his <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog</HI> are not brought upon the Stage till a Thousand Years hence. Moreover, if there be any thing in being descended of the <HI>Scythian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> to entail the Curse of <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog:</HI> twill make the Argument more strong, to bring them from <HI>Asia,</HI> and <HI>Europe:</HI> for no body doubts, but that there are of their Offspring in those parts. Not to insist on the Opinion received, in <HI>China,</HI> and credited by <HI>Antonius Galvanus</HI>; that the <HI>Ame∣ricans</HI> are Colonies sent from that Nation: The principal Design of Mr. <HI>Fuller</HI>'s whole Discourse appears in the last clause of it, the sence of which is this, <HI>WHEREFORE, forasmuch as unto</HI> Europe, <HI>and the Northern parts of</HI> Asia, <HI>there is the Accession of the New World, a surplus∣sage of boundless Bigness; and is fallen by right of Inheritance, to</HI> Japheth, <HI>To Have and to Hold to him and his Heirs for Ever: It cannot be denied, but that the prophetical Blessing of the Patriarch is perfectly and absolutely fulfilled; and that</HI> Japheth <HI>was most truly so called, as unto whom God would</HI> give Enlargement, h. e. <HI>grant for a Double Portion a most huge Tract of Land of marvellous Extent; and that not upon a scanty and strict; but upon a most Large and Liberal admeasurement.</HI></P>

not rather be without a Portion, than have one so ill Condition'd?

<P>This SCRIPTURE would have made a most desirable &amp; pleasant Conclusion of this small disquisition: but that the Reader may expect to see what Renowned Dr. <HI>Twisse</HI> hath written in compliance with the forementioned <HI>Conjecture:</HI> because every one is not so happy as to be Owner of Mr. <HI>Mede</HI>'s Works.</P>

This is the first appearance of it, that I re∣member: and was in manuscript probably, by the care to return it again speedily.

<P>First Thoughts are sometimes the best.

It is most certain, that unless Christians be <HI>exceeding carefull,</HI> and GOD <HI>Wonderfully Mercifull</HI>; Religion in <HI>Europe</HI> must instantly Expire. As to <HI>America,</HI> He cannot, without great Reluctancy, give up his <HI>English</HI> Friends there: who differed from Mr. <HI>Mede</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Epist.</HI> 55, 57, 70, 74.</NOTE> and agreed well with them in the Grounds upon which they went thither.

Old and experien∣ced Souldiers may be wounded and worsted in particular Encounters; especially in great Expeditions that are New and Unusual. But if they are sensible of their wounds, and complain of the smart of them, by that we know for certain, that they are not slain.

<PB N="55" REF="000813_0062_0FAA56E9B0467988"/>
of the 2<HI>d</HI> Part contains Motives to Gospellize the Heathen, such as the <HI>Indians</HI> are. The First Motive is the <HI>Command of GOD,</HI> whose we are, and whom we profess to serve. This <HI>Command</HI> is either plainly expressed; or closely implyed in the Promises. An express Command is to be seen in <HI>Mark,</HI> 16.15. <HI>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Gospel to every Creature. Mat.</HI> 28.19, 20. <HI>It is necessary the Fullness of the Gentiles should come in: and doth Faith come upon any by Chance?

Do we detain the Word of God in Unrighte∣ousness?</HI> Bernard. lib. 3. cap. 1. de Consid.</P>
<P>Another Motive offers it self from the <HI>Coming of our dear LORD</HI>; which, if real Christians, we do desire: but if intelligent ones, will not expect (because we cannot obtain) till the <HI>Indians</HI> be Gospelli∣zed. <HI>Mat.</HI> 24.14. <HI>And this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in All the World, for a witness unto All Nations, and then shall the End come.</HI> I need not again rescue this Text to the sence that favours the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> Gospelling: but rather imploy it in this Service. Christians, Would you not gladly have Christ come? Do you not long for such a Day of his <HI>Presence,</HI> as will never be obscured by a Night of <HI>Absence</HI> or Withdrawing? Do you not look out sharp for Him, to end the Violences and Abuses of the sons of Wickedness? To dispatch this Vain and Vexatious world? What say you? Do you so love Christ, as to say with the Bride, by the same Spirit, <HI>Come Lord Jesus! Come quickly!</HI> Are you in good earnest that hear this? Desire then, Pray and Labour that the Gospel may be preached in all the World; in this <HI>Indian</HI> End of it. For till then, Christ himself tells you, He will not, He cannot come. The Door is, as it were, shut against Him. How do you desire Him to come in, and yet ly drowsing and turn∣ing on your Bed, as a Door upon the hinge? You are trying near hand, how you can shift for your <HI>Selves</HI>; and so in effect, shift off <HI>CHRIST,</HI> who is all this while kept without door. For Love, or Shame, Get Up! and Open the Door! 2 <HI>Peter,</HI> 3.12. <HI>Looking for, and hasting unto the coming of the day of God.</HI> Sit not then still: but as we use to do with desirable and welcom Guests, go out to meet Him, and bring Him in.
