<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>THO'</HI>averse from pride as well as principle, to personal dedi∣cations, in which an Author, in search of a patron, generally sacri∣fices his love of truth and independence; and though in obedience to this opinion, I have permitted many Compositions to go undedi∣cated, and unpatronized on the world; for once, to indulge a senti∣ment of private gratitude and esteem, I depart from my system, and present to you my Tragedy of Bunker Hill. I shall find few diffi∣culties in justifying to myself this individualism, when I reflect with what courage and patriotism you stepped forward to fight the bat∣tles of your country, to one of which I am indebted for the subject of my drama: But I fear I shall not so easily justify myself to you and the public, from the imputation of presumption in intruding on the importance of your time, and the lustre of your talents and erudition, a trifle so every way unworthy of you. To the lat∣ter I only can say, it is my best offering; and had it been better, it should have the same direction. With earnest wishes for the suc∣cess of the piece and its patron, praying a length of years and en∣crease of honors for both,</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE—</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE AUTHOR.</BYLINE>
<L>WHEN o'er Columbia's fields in fearful hour,</L>
<L>Glared the red Comet of Britannia's power,</L>
<L>From horrid hair shook flakes of burning wrath,</L>
<L>And war and desolation mark'd its path:</L>
<L>Rous'd by the fury of her ruthless foes,</L>
<L>The angry Genius of Columbia rose:</L>
<L>Then, with a voice more loud, more deep than fate,</L>
<L>Was rent the fabric of Monarchic State,</L>
<L>And instantaneous, soothing as the lyre,</L>
<L>Which wakes the soul and kindles soft desire,</L>
<L>She called the <HI>great Republic</HI> into day,</L>
<L>And to a world, restored its legal sway:</L>
<L>Behold; her patriot hand the low lands fills</L>
<L>Like to the torrents of a thousand hills,</L>
<L>Which thund'ring to the plain their waters roll,</L>
<L>Unite, condense, and form a mighty whole;</L>
<L>Columbia's Sons down Alleghany's sides,</L>
<L>Their fiery cohorts pour in rapid tides:</L>
<L>Whilst o'er the glassy surface of the flood,</L>
<L>Light'd by the Sun, a gallant vessel rode;</L>
<L>The Ark which bears the charter of the land,</L>
<L>It sails directed by the Almighty hand:</L>
<L>'Till safe at length from tempest and from flood,</L>
<L>Secure on fredom's Ararat it stood.</L>
<L>Thus did this great, this glorious Empire rise,</L>
<L>Which lifts its patriot honors to the skies;</L>
<L>Spite of the bloody lash, the tyrant's frown,</L>
<L>The shock of armies and a fleet's renown▪</L>
<L>A nobler theme than this, to grace the stage,</L>
<L>Where can we find in all th' historic page?</L>
<L><PB REF="031893_0004_0FEF312181FA1A80"/>Of Rome's and Cato's fall, the World has rung:</L>
<L>Why not Columbia's rising fame be sung?</L>
<L>If Rome her Brutus and her Cato boast;</L>
<L>Her Washington and Warren, each a host,</L>
<L>Columbia owns; with thousand names beside,</L>
<L>The least of which would swell the Roman pride:</L>
<L>And midst these themes sublime, these subjects grand</L>
<L>Which tempt the poet's fancy in this land,</L>
<L>Where is there one more potent to inspire</L>
<L>Conceptions vast, and wake Parnassian fire,</L>
<L>Than when on Bunker's top a glorious band</L>
<L>Pour'd out their sacred blood to save the land?</L>
<L>And ere they fell, such fierce destruction hurl'd,</L>
<L>As when Volcanoes burn and tear the world.</L>
<L>Such is our Bard's excuse that he this night</L>
<L>Renews the horrors of fam'd Bunker's fight,</L>
<L>And, bending suppliant at your awful shrine,</L>
<L>His Child to your protection doth consign:</L>
<L>Assur'd of Justice, he has dar'd to trace,</L>
<L><HI>Columbia's</HI> Glories to <HI>Columbia's</HI> race.</L>

<L>HOW's this my Lord!</L>
<L>What means this shameful rout among the troops!</L>
<L>But lately from these gates they issued</L>
<L>In all the proud array of glorious war,</L>
<L>Looking as if they were invincible:</L>
<L>Now pale dismay affrights them; they appear</L>
<L>Worn down by heat, and want of sustenance;</L>
<L>Afflicted, sprightless, desiring rest</L>
<L>More than renown! Speak, I guess the truth!</L>
<L>But yet it cannot be, that senseless rebels,</L>
<L>Brave only in a mob when pillage calls</L>
<L>And loud sedition gathers them together,</L>
<L>Should cope with discipline, or knee to knee</L>

<L>In each particular of this toilsome day,</L>
<L>So fatal to our Warriors; but first,</L>
<L>Let the drums beat to arms, man all the works,</L>

<L>Shall o'er the town her dusky mantle draw,</L>
<L>A furious foe will thunder at our posts.</L>

<SPEAKER>Lord Percy.</SPEAKER>
<L>According to your Excellency's orders,</L>
<L>With the detachment under my command,</L>
<L>I posted on to Lexington; with a view</L>
<L>To succour Smith, or take what other course</L>
<L>Requir'd by circumstances; judge my surprize,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="031893_0008_0FEF3319E55DC008"/>When I beheld Smith's party in full rout,</L>
<L>With thousands and ten thousands at his heels,</L>
<L>All order fled, confusion through the ranks</L>
<L>Stalking with death and terror in his train:</L>
<L>In haste I form'd my forces to repel</L>
<L>The numbers which assail'd him: for a while</L>
<L>My cannon kept the foe at distance,</L>
<L>But soon their numbers so encreased, and fury</L>
<L>Beyond all calculation; and beside</L>
<L>Their trim and movements seem'd so soldier like,</L>
<L>That fearing for the safety of the troops</L>
<L>Committed to my charge, I thought it best</L>
<L>With all convenient speed to hasten back,</L>
<L>Lest these rebellious townsmen should attack</L>
<L>The quarters in our absence, and cut off</L>
<L>All intercourse between the troops and Boston:</L>
<L>But tho' the wisest measures were adopted</L>
<L>For this retreat, they hung upon our rear,</L>
<L>Rushing on with fury next to madness;</L>
<L>Till every inch of ground was bought with blood.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov. Gage.</SPEAKER>
<L>I thought two thousand British troops might march</L>
<L>Through all America! driving before them,</L>
<L>Like chaff, th' affrighted colonists. How in England</L>
<L>Will found this news; too distant to observe,</L>
<L>Our names will be the subject of reproach:</L>

<L>Unless by some misconduct in their chiefs.</L>
<L>Beside, 'twill have another bad effect:</L>
<L>The spirits of those rebels will be rais'd,</L>
<L>Before too high: like rivers swell'd by rain,</L>
<L>Which spurn the narrow limits of their banks;</L>
<L>Their hearts will swell with arrogance and pride;</L>
<L>Our discipline and order will be slighted;</L>
<L>Our military character contemn'd,</L>
<L>Which oftener gains the battle than the sword:</L>
<L>But did you well observe their countenance;</L>
<L>Did it but seem the flash of short liv'd anger,</L>
<L>Which pushed them on; or the determin'd frown</L>
<L>Which marks the settled purpose of the mind.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Percy.</SPEAKER>
<L>Imagine to yourself the Roman legion,</L>
<L>Or Grecian Phalanx rang'd in battalia;</L>
<L>The furious aspect of the ancient Gaul,</L>
<L>Or painted Briton our brave ancestor:</L>
<L>Think all their terrors center'd in the foe,</L>
<L>With whom we wrestled: 'twill be near the truth:</L>
<L>Whilst on our march a thousand fierce attacks</L>
<L>Rag'd on our rear; when we fac'd about,</L>

<L>Again we march'd, again the battle rag'd.</L>

<SPEAKER>Gov. Gage.</SPEAKER>
<L>This business is unlucky;</L>
<L>Our project was to keep the shew of friendship,</L>
<L>And seem as if we would concede, 'till troops</L>

<L>Has disconcerted all our best laid schemes.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="031893_0010_0FEF31165BFCB028"/>Now all America will rise in arms,</L>
<L>And thus a war, which in its infancy</L>

<L>Now fame will bear the tidings of this loss</L>
<L>Thro' all this continent; exaggerating all,</L>
<L>Destroying ten for every one that dy'd.</L>
<L>And those Americans will so exult,</L>
<L>As when, of old, the Mexicans they bore</L>
<L>The head of a slain Spaniard, through the land;</L>
<L>To shew the people that the foe was mortal:</L>
<L>The week and timid now will loose their fears</L>
<L>Of our experience and our discipline;</L>

<HEAD>SCENE—A CHAMBER.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Gen. Warren, seated at a table, holds a letter in his hand announcing the defeat of the British at Lexington.</STAGE>
<L>At length the sun of freedom 'gins to rise</L>
<L>Upon the world; a glorious dawn of day,</L>
<L>Breaking in lucid streaks of every hue,</L>
<L>Shedding its incenc'd breathing on the mind:</L>
<L>And the deep night, where tyrants sat enthron'd,</L>
<L>Shrouding their horrid forms from the world,</L>
<L>Now passes on, like mists before the sun.</L>
<L>The day is come for which through every age</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="031893_0018_0FEF33662E2A6F88"/>Sages have sighed; which like a magic spell,</L>
<L>Shall dash down tyrants and their thrones together,</L>
<L>And make their blood-stain'd idols fall before it;</L>
<L>Too long the world has groan'd beneath the yoke</L>
<L>Of frantic despotism; war followed war,</L>
<L>And horrid rage deform'd the works of heaven.</L>
<L>Now a new era rises on the world;</L>
<L>The spirit of old Rome inspires the land;</L>
<L>Fir'd with a glorious ardor, young and old▪</L>
<L>Fly to the field, determin'd to assert</L>
<L>Those sacred rights, which nature hath design'd</L>
<L>Alike, for all the children of this earth.</L>
<L>And shall I then, inglorious, stay behind,</L>
<L>While my brave countrymen are braving death</L>
<L>To purchase glory; I too am fond of glory,</L>
<L>And such a cause will make ambition, virtue.</L>
<L>But I can do good service otherwise;</L>
<L>By writing, I can help the public cause,</L>
<L>And heal my brethren wounded in the fight.</L>
<L>'Tis cowardice that reasons: <HI>all</HI> is best.</L>
<L>I never heard that Brutus was content,</L>
<L>That he had done just so much, and no more;</L>
<L>No—Liberty will ne'er be woo'd by halves,</L>
<L>But like the jealous female, must have all</L>
<L>The lover's heart or none: but then again—</L>
<L>I am not young, and feel beside, the ties</L>
<L>Of family endearments; what of that?</L>
<L>Was Cato young, or had he no connections,</L>
<L>Whan thro' Numidia's burning sands he led</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="031893_0019_0FEF33318DFA6E20"/>His little Senate in pursuit of freedom;</L>
<L>Preferring pain and every ill to bondage?</L>
<L>Was Cincinnatus young, when from the plough,</L>
<L>Call'd by his country's voice, he flew to battle?</L>
<L>The patriot should o'erleap all obstacles</L>
<L>Which stand between him and his darling country;</L>
<L>Not age, not sex, nor scarcely pain itself,</L>
<L>Should be exempt from this important duty,</L>
<L>But ALL before the sacred voice of country,</L>
<L>When to her children she doth cry for succour,</L>
<L>Should fly to her relief, and guard from insult,</L>
<L>The soil, which holds the bones of their forefathers;</L>
<L>This sentiment is heavenly, and doth bind</L>
<L>The wandering Tartar to the little spot,</L>
<L>Where the dead bodies of his tribe are laid:</L>
<L>How then can the remainder of my life,</L>
<L>Be better spent, than in my country's service?</L>
<L>A thousand bright examples point the way,</L>
<L>Trodden by heroes: shall I then keep back,</L>
<L>When such a glorious harvest may be won?</L>
<L>No— from this hour, my resolution's fixt:</L>
<L>Here in the face of heaven, I devote
<STAGE>[kneels]</STAGE></L>
<L>Myself, my services, my life to Freedom;
<STAGE>[rises.]</STAGE></L>
<L>And I can think of nothing but of souls,</L>
<L>Who in contempt of death their country sav'd;</L>
<L>Of Curtius, of Scoevola and of Brutus,</L>
<L>Of Cato, Cassius, Decii and Camilli;</L>
<L>And if to these, sweat heaven, I could add</L>
<L>The name of Warren, and hand them together</L>

<SPEAKER>Warren.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, I will go;</L>

<L>The army grows in spirit every hour:</L>

<L>And we have lost our portion of the glory:</L>
<L>Tell the army, my sense of the high favor</L>
<L>Confer'd by them, calls forth my gratitude,</L>

<L>I'm glad on it;</L>
<L>Our circumstances call for men of talent,</L>

<L>So Cato, the great Roman, us'd to act:</L>

<SPEAKER>Warren.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou'rt right my friend;</L>
<L>The foe should have no time to gather strength,</L>

<L>Burn the ships, and keep on the alert</L>

<STAGE>English reinforced, march towards the Hill. The cannon play at intervals to make breaches in the works. English bands strike up Yankee Doodle in contempt of the Americans. A dead silence reigns among the Americans. They are seen just appearing above the works waiting the attack. Three times the English make the assault, and three times they are beat back. After the third repulse Warren half descends the Hill, and addresses his soldiers:</STAGE>
<L><HI>Courage, Americans!</HI></L>
<L>The spirits of those heroes, who expir'd,</L>
<L>Massacred at Boston and at Lexington,</L>
<L>Are this day witnesses of your renown;</L>
<L>Suspended o'er this hill; let them behold</L>
<L>Vengeance inflicted on their murderers:</L>
<L>Let's give them in their names another fire,</L>

<L>Fighting amidst my countrymen in arms.</L>
<L>'Tis true, the foe are masters of the field:</L>
<L>But 'tis a slaughter house, fill'd with their dead;</L>
<L>A spectacle, to wring their flinty hearts,</L>
<L>And make them cautious, how they rouse the brave.</L>
<L>This day, has been a proud one for the land:</L>
<L>My countrymen have fought with Spartan valour,</L>
<L>Like hungry lions, bathing them in blood,</L>
<L>And like the Romans, in their first encounter</L>
<L>With Epire's king; have but resign'd the field,</L>
<L>A wretched solace to the mourning foe,</L>
