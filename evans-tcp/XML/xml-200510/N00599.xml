<HEAD>Concerning the true Worship of God in Spirit.</HEAD>
<P>EVen at this day, as in days past, among the Peopl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the World there are many Wayes of Worship▪ but with the People of the Lord, his way of Worship is but one, in which they worship God in the Spirit and in the Truth; for God is a Spirit, and they which are true Worshippers of him, they worship in the Spirit and in the Truth. Then how can any be true Worshippers of God which abide not in his Truth; for Christ is the Way, the Truth and the Life, and they that are not in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrist, are out of his Truth, and so not in the true Worship of God; so as they are not in Christ the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are not in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, but out of that spiritual Life in which the true W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ship of God remaineth.

Worship. Then seeing that all are Worshippers, How is the true Worshipper known from the false? Even as the Tree is known by its Fruit, so are Worshippers known one from the other; for the good Tree bringeth forth good Fruit, but the evil Tree bringeth forth corrupt Fruit; for men do not expect to gather Grapes of Thornes, nor Figs of Thistles, neither can any man be a true Worshipper of God in Spirit, that doth not bring forth Fruits of the Spirit, which are <HI>Love, Joy, Peace, Long-Suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance, against such there is no Law,</HI> Gal. 5.22, 23. for they live in the Spirit and walk in the Spirit with Christ, such are the true Worshippers of God in Spirit and Truth; but such Worshippers that draw in sin as an Ox draweth in Water, their best Performances in Worship, are sin, unto which the Lord hath no regard; for we know that God heareth not sinners, but if any man be a true Worshipper of God, and he doth his will, him he heareth, <HI>John</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.31. Now to think that God will accept any mans Work where∣in sin remaineth, that man deceiveth himself; for all Works wherein sin remaineth, it is not of the Spirit of God, but of the Devil; for he is a sinner from the begin∣ning, and the Truth abideth not in him; for in the time of the Law, the Peoples Offerings before thê <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord were to be perfect, without blemish▪ <HI>Lev.</HI> 22.21. and their weight and measure were to be perfect before the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of their Salvation, <HI>Deut.</HI> 25.15.

Life for the Salvation of their immortal Souls; for as God hath perfected his work of Grace in Jesus Christ, for the Salvation of Peoples Souls, so must their work be also perfect, by the Power of God, in and through Christ, for the Salvation of them that are saved, in and through him the Lord of Life, of whose Spirit there is a gift given to the Sons and Daughters of men, which is for this end, that through perfect Obedience thereunto, they may work out their Salvation by true Faith in Jesus Christ, who is Author and Finisher of his own Work in the hearts of them that in him believe; for he is given a Light to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and a Rule of Life for all to walk by. So here is no occasion of stumbling, as the heart and mind attends its Rule, which Rule directs the heart and mind in to the true and living Way, which leads to the Kingdom of Heaven, where they that worship out of the Spirit and Truth can never come; for though they may not profess to worship a false God, as many do, yet they profess a worship of the true God in a false way, by which their worship is a false Worship, which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord will destroy; for contrary to the mind and will of God they have set up a false Worship, teaching for Doctrines the Command∣ments of Men, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.9. <HI>For the hour cometh, and now is, when the true Worshipper shall worship the Father in Spirit and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruth, for the Father seeketh such to worship him, Joh.</HI> 4.23.

will not have regard to that Worship in which Obedience is not yeilded to the gift of his own Spirit of Truth, which calls for Silence in the heart and mind of all such People whose Worship is not in the Spirit and in Truth; for the fleshly part must be subdued, and the natural Thoughts of the heart, and the intents of the natural Mind must be subdued by the Power of God, unto which Obedience is to be yeilded, that every wandering Thought may be brought into subjection by the Power of God, then the Lord will have regard unto the Soul of him that so worshippeth; for such Worshippers are they of the Cir∣cumcision, which worship in the Spirit, and reioyce in Christ Jesus, having no Confidence in the Flesh, <HI>Phil</HI> 3 3. Now this is the main Reason why People do not profit, but in their Worship, as themselves confess, go round in their Duties, even like a Horse in the Mill, and a Door on the Hinges, still remaining where they were, because they offer to God with a false weight and measure, which is of their own Imperfection, in a belief that they shall never be free from Sin in this Life, whereby their Debt is inlarged, and causeth them to fall short of a true Hope by Jesus Christ, who will not accept that imperfect O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ering, which would not profit in the Time of the Law; for this is the Day of Gods Grace by Jesus Christ, in which if any man will hear, let him not harden his heart, through a false Belief, begotten by the denyal, that in this day of so large a Dispensation of Light by Jesus Christ, that God will receive the imperfectness of Mans own Work, which indeed is that which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ords Soul abhors; for the Devil, and Enemy of Mans Peace, hath seated himself in the heart and mind of Man, and exalted himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he as

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Concerning true Prayer, by which the faithful find Acceptance with God, by Faith in the Son of his Love, the Lord Jesus Christ.</HEAD>
<P>TRue Prayer is an Ordinance of God, and a Duty which God requires of Man, to be performed by the Power of his own gift, which came by Jesus Christ, who hath commanded all men to <HI>watch and pray,</HI> in a believing frame of Spirit, which is that that God requires of all men, and all men that are in perfect Obedience to God, they watch and pray by the assisting Power of Gods Spirit, by which they are made able to resist the Devil in the hour of Temptation, but they who are in Unbelief of Gods Power by Jesus Christ, <HI>That they shall never be made free from sin in this Life,</HI> they cannot pray by the Spirit of God,
<PB N="62" REF="000730_0070_0FAA466CA40B5F08"/>
because of their Unbelief; for all sin is of Unrighteousness, and all Unrighteousness is of the Devil, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of them that continue in sin, are an Abomination in the sight of God, for the Eyes of the Lord are more purer than to behold Sin, or regard Iniquity; for the Thoughts of the Wicked are an Abomination to the Lord, but the words of the Poor are pleasant words, <HI>Pro.</HI> 15.26. By which it is plain, that by Peoples living in Sin, is the cause of their Prayers not being accepted with the Lord, because the <HI>Wayes of the Wicked are an Abomination before him, but he loveth him that followeth after Righteousness, Prov.</HI> 15.9. for sin being loved and entertained, makes a seperation between God and mans Soul, in which state man is incapable of receiving the incomes of Gods divine Love by Jesus Christ, by whose Spirit of Life, the hearts of them which hunger and thirst after Righteousness, come to be enlightened, through which they come to receive his Will in what they should pray for unto him; for Man in his own Will cannot know when or what to pray for, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s he ought to do, <HI>for thou, O Lord! hast revealed unto thy Servant, there∣fore hath thy Servant found in his heart to pray this Prayer unto thee,</HI> 2 Sam. 7.27. By which it is evident, that true spiritual Prayer proceedeth from the Power of Gods Spirit, by which the Righteous come to enjoy the benefit of that which they pray for; but the Unrighteous pray for the deliverance from sin, which living in a state of Un∣belief, that God will never in this Life wholly free them from Sin, which Unbelief stops the current of Life, and hinders the Work of God by Christ, whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ork by▪ Faith in him is to destroy Sin, and put an end to Trans∣gression, that is in them which belive in the gift of his Grace, by which men are saved; for its the Gift of God,

Prov. 15.2. so it is the Prayers of the Upright in heart, which the Lord accepts and delights in, for unto them is the promise of God by Christ, who re∣news the Faith of his People, by the power of his spirit, which begets the inward man into a lively hope of that assurance, which by true Faith the soul receives▪ by true Prayer unto the Lord, through which Prayer by Grace, every Dispensation of Gods gifts come to be sanctified, through the Power of his own spirit; for every Dis∣pensation is from God, and only sanctified to the Righ∣teous, which receive of the Lords free benefits, and rich Mercies of his Love, in the outward Dispensation, which through Prayer and Thanks-giveing, are sanctified to them which live in Uprightness of heart and mind towards God, which the Unrighteous also pretend, but it is with unclean Hearts, for which cause the Lord will not accept their Prayers, for the Lord only dwells with the pure in heart, whose minds are wrought into a true and living sence of Gods heavenly riches in Jesus Christ, which is the inheritance of his faithfull People, which pray unto him, by the power of his own spirit which doth condemn

the Prayers of all unrighteous men, who pray in their own time, and in their own wills.</P>
<P>But some may then query, Whether the Unrighteous are not commanded to pray? <HI>Ans.</HI> The hearts of the righ∣teous desire the return of the Wicked, that they may for∣sake the evil of their way, and serve the Lord in Truth and Righteousness, and that the Wicked are to pray, which will not discharge any part of their Disobedience to God, until they come to forsake their Unrighteous way of sinning against the gift of his Grace, and divine Light of his Spirit, which remains their Condemnation for sin, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.19, 20, 21. By which it is evident, that the Prayer of a wicked man availeth not before the Lord, that is, while he remaineth in the known Life of Sin, which he prays against, but let the wicked forsake their way, and the Unrighteous <HI>Man his Thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and unto our God, for he will abundantly pardon,</HI> Isa. 55 7. So that where men live in known sins against God, and in a belief of its being impossible to be free from sin in this Life, the Prayer of such doth not proceed from the Spirit of God, who hath Commanded his People, not to touch, taste <HI>nor handle with any unclean thing, but to follow the</HI> leadings of Gods holy Spirit, as the Apostles have done for Example, and to mark them which walk otherwayes▪ So every man and every woman is to seek God for themselves; for he hath pro∣mised to be found of them that seek, him in uprightness of heart; and I do not read that any of the Lords servants in dayes past, were ever lead by the spirit of God, to pray either privatly among People in unbelief of ever attaining that which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Apostles prayed for, which is, that they might present every man perfect in Christ <HI>Jesus;

then where in remains the profit of any true Beleivers</HI> Prayer in publick, though in his own family, (which through their unbelief in the power of God, that they shall never be free from sin in this Life, by which they are not as yet of the true Houshold of Faith) at times and seasons, as the spirit of God moves in the heart of every such master of family, he doth pray, for the return of them, and all other People, which remain in the same state of Unbelief, which until they repent and forsake, their prayers will not be accepted of God.</P>

And in <HI>Mark</HI> 10.14, 15, 16. where they bring Christs say∣ing, <HI>Suffer little Children to come unto me, forbid them not, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven</HI>; which saying is explained in the following Verse, <HI>that whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little Child he shall not enter therein,</HI> can never reach by Visible Water, which cleans∣eth not the inside of these wise <HI>Hebrew, Greek</HI> and <HI>Latine learned Builders,</HI> who ground their unsound Foundation of Sprinkling Infants, in the room of Circumcision, which according to the holy Scriptures of Ttuth, one Tipe did ne∣ver tipe out another, but every Tipe typified the substance, for Circumcision was a Tipe or Figure, and cutting off the fore-skin was a Figure of the Circumcision and cut∣ting off the Fore-skin of the heart. Now baptism with wa∣ter was a Tipe or Figure, as in <HI>Peter</HI> 3.21. which tiped out the spiritual Washing or regeneration, which is, bap∣tizing of Infants come in the room of Circumcision; then how do they agree in a parrellel, seeing that the Males were only circumcised, then why are the Famales now bap∣tized, if Baptism come in the room of Circumcision, which as to their form in batpizing, they differ one from the other even as in other things, which they account to be the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dinances of Christ, but are found to be the Or∣dinances of men, set up and maintained by the Power of men, who in their several Forms differ each from the o∣ther; for some sprinkle, others dip, and some dip over a∣gain; others plunge, others sprinkle with mixt Water, and to my knowledge some have had their Children sprink∣led with warm water in cold weather, for which form, some of their Priests have said to me, that they have allowance for their differing Forms under this Dispensation,

that is, to dip or sprinkle, according to the nature of the Climate where they live; but to prove their assertion by Scripture they cannot do, which without scripture Proof, they are willing to say something for what they hold, but in what form soever any by their Priests are baptized, there is no effect of their work doth appear, but like Priest like People, all pleading for <HI>A Body of Sin, while they remain in this Life</HI>; which doth manifest, that visible Water is of no effect, notwithstanding these hired Builders, bring Christs words to <HI>Nicodemus, John</HI> 3.5. <HI>that except</HI> a man be born again of Water and Spirit, he cannot enter the Kingdom of God. From which words some do infer, that Infant Baptism is of absolute Necessity to Salvation. Now Christ did then speak of that heavenly Water which did regenerate and make new; for through the Power of that Water the Heart came to be made clean, according to the Prophets Saying, <HI>Then will I sprinkle clean Water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your Filthiness,</HI> Ezek. 36.25 By which it is manifest, that visible Water cleanseth not the inside▪ which is to be cleansed through the washing of Regeneration; <HI>for it is not the washing away of the filth of the Flesh, but the answer of a good Conscience towards God, by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ,</HI> 1 Pet. 3 21.

<P>MAny are the Talkers of the Sabbath, and of the first days Rest, but few are they that come so far in the Work of God, by Faith in Jesus Christ, as to witness their first days Work in him, who is the true and everlasting Sabbath, in whom the faithful have their resting place, they are them which are come to witness the end of their Labour, which have their rest in Christ, the true Sabbath. Now where People in their differing forms of Will Wor∣ship rest from their outward Labour one day in seven, calling that the Sabbath Day, thinking thereby that the Lord of Sabboth will accept their will Worship, with their rest from outward Labour, for his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abbath, they deceive themselves, and the Lord of Sabbath will reward them according to their own Works, by which they pretend to serve him; for the Lord only looks at them who in in uprightness of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art labour against sin, that by so doing they witness the effect of their Labour, through the Power of God, by Faith in Christ against sin; for they that labour not six days against sin, shall never wit∣ness the seventh Day Holy to the Lord of Sabbath, which proves such Talkers of the Sabbath to be no keepers of any Time Holy to the Lord of Sabbath; and as to many such Talkers about the Sabbath Day, on which they are more unholy in their Minds, as to the Lord of Sabbath, than on any other of the six days, in which Peoples

<P><HI>THe Law was given by Moses, but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ,</HI> John 1. vers. 17.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. Concerning divine Inspiration and Revelation.</HEAD>
<P>MAny are the Teachers which hold, all divine Inspi∣ration and Revelation to be ceased ever since the Apostles days, and from that time that God hath wholly committed his Will and Mind to be known by the written Word.</P>
<P>To which <HI>I Answer:</HI> That God in Christ, before the Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d began, did determine all things necessary for mans Salvation, whom God did make in his own Image▪ and gave him Dominion over the Works of his own Hand, which Image of Holiness Man l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st in the Fall.

Spirit to save <HI>Adam's</HI> Soul, which gift in measure is given to all the Children of Men, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey may know the Mind of God, and do it; for Salvation is not by the Works of the Law, but by Grace, through Faith in Jesus Christ; <HI>for the Law was given by</HI> Moses, <HI>but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ,</HI> who is the Author and Finisher of his own work of in his people, <HI>John</HI> 1.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. and for that end they have received a divine gift of his Spirit of Grace, which doth reveal the Mind and Will of God, in and through the Son of his love, the Lord Jesus, which is Christ (by the divine Life and Light of his Spirit in his People the Hope of Glory, in which state they serve the Lord of Life, accor∣ding to the Revelation of his Spirit, of which all, in mea∣sure have received, or shall receive, <HI>for their Obedience to the Faith,</HI> through which Obedience of Faith, is the <HI>Justi∣fication of Life and Salvation,</HI> and <HI>Condemnation</HI> unto them whose Disobedience is to the true Faith, which hath been delivered unto the Saints, unto whom the Lord, in measure, doth reveal himself in this day, as to his faithful Children in days past, it being granted, that God gave extraordi∣nary Revelations, &amp;c. to the holy Prophets and Apostles, beside what he gave them in common with all Saints; for he changeth not, but is the same God yesterday, to day and for evermore, who makes known the Mystery of Salvation by the Revelation of his good Spirit of Grace, through their Faith in Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>So now, as the Almighty God hath in all Ages made known of his Will and Mind to the Children of men, by the revealings of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pirit in their hearts, even so is it among his Children in this Day, who behold with their spiritual Eyes the mighty Works of God to their Souls, by the Revelations of his Spirit, in and through Jesus Christ;
<PB N="111" REF="000730_0119_0FAA45EF60CDB868"/>
for he that was to come, is come, in whom the fullness is, and hath brought in the hope of Salvation to all them that believe in the gift of his Spirit, which doth reveal the Mind of God in his People, who witness him to be come, <HI>which hath fulfilled all Righteousness, and brought in the Hope of Assurance,</HI> which is revealed by the Inspiration of his holy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pirit in them, through which they are brought into a further acquaintance with the Lord of Life, whom to know, through the drawings of the Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her, is Life Eternal, through the Son; <HI>fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no man cometh to receive Life by the Son, but as the Father draws him, neither cometh any to the Father, but by the Son,</HI> John 6.44. Thes. 65</P>
<P>So here is a drawing by the Spirit, which reveals the Will of God in the Children of his own begetting, thorough which, by Faith, they come into fellowship with the Son more and more, <HI>whom no man knoweth but the Father, neither knoweth any the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him,</HI> Mat. 11.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Therefore the true saving knowledge of God, is by the divine Revelation of his own Spirit, in and through Jesus Christ, whom to know is Life Eternal, of which the Scriptures do declare, that the Power of God remains in the gift of his Grace, which c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me by Jesus Christ, through which is the assu∣rance of Salvation, to them that by Faith in Christ, through whom by his Grace, they are saved. Now the holy scrip∣tures were given forth by the holy Spirit of God; therefore is his Spirit before and above the Scriptures, as the work∣man is above the instrument he works with; for the spirit worketh with the Scriptures instrumentally upon the souls of men, both to inform their Understandings, and to move and incline their Wills and Affections; and no man can understand the things of the Spirit but by the Revelation

Then i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all divine Revelation and Inspiration of Gods Spirit to his Children be ceased, must not all spiritual seeing and spiritual hearing be ceased also? which by their Doctrines doth seem to me, as if they conclude Christ also to be ceased; for if the Inspiration of Gods holy Spirit of Revelation be ceased, then how shall God and Christ be heard and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: spiritually, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elievers in dayes past did spiritually hear and see him?

Will they conclude, they all perish, for want of the Letter, when the Mind and Will of God is, that a Remnant of all Nations, of them that fear him and work Righteousness shall be saved. And though the holy Scriptures do give Infallible Marks of such an estate yet there is no scripture can infallibly assure any man that he hath these marks, but it must be the spirit of God, that gives every true believer such an assurance; <HI>for the spirit it self beareth witness with our Spirits, that we are the Chil∣dren of God, Rom.</HI> 8.6. So it is the Spirit of God by which that assurance is revealed to beleivers, or more properly in believers, by which they come to witness, that they have the Son, <HI>and he that hath the Son of God, hath Life,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh,</HI> 5.12. Now the holy Scriptures hold forth, <HI>that he that hath the Son of God, hath Life,</HI> but give no assurnce of Life, but the Spirit of God doth reveal an assuerance; which proves, that all divine Revelation is not ceased.</P>

<P>THe Light of the Gospel is of God by Jesus, who is the Power of God to Salvation, in all them that be∣lieve, and the Power of God for Condemnation in them that be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieve not, <HI>John</HI> 1.11, 12 for the Lord searcheth the heart and tryeth the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins, even to give every man according to the fruit of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s doings; for the Light of Gods gift of divine Life, by Jesus Christ, makes manifest what fruit God requires of the Sons and Daughters of men, who through Faith and Obedience, do not answer his holy Will, for which cause the Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven, against all Ungodliness and Unrighteousness of men, be∣cause their Life of Disobedience is knowingly against the gift of Gods divine Light, which is their Condemnation for their evil Deeds, <HI>John</HI> 3.19, 20. <HI>for that which may be known of God is manifested in them, for God hath shewed it unto them,</HI> Rom. 1.18, 19 <HI>For the Lord sheweth unto Man what is his Thoughts, Amos</HI> 4.13.

<P>EVen now, as in dayes past, the Lords Harvest is Great, but the Labourers are few, because many have received of the Lord to work in the Vineyard, but are not faithful to that of him which they have received; for which cause their part of labour in the Vineyard re∣mains not done, and they remain <HI>clothed</HI> with the works of their own Labour, which is not of the Spirit of God, therefore do they labour in Vain; for it is the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ligent hand (through the gift of God) which enriches the Soul of him, that is a faithfull Labourer in the Lords Vine∣yard, when the negligent and sloathful ones are sent empty away; for all have in measure received the seed of the Harvest; but through unfaithfulness the harvest of Truth and Righteousness is not perfe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed in them, because through their unfaithfulness to the gift of God, the Seed taketh not root, for the ground proves barren, which is the cause of the seeds not taking root, to bring forth fruit acceptable to God; for as the seed, in mea∣sure, hath been sown in all sorts of ground, it only takes root to bring forth good fruit i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the honest heart, which is faithfull to God in the work of the Vineyard; for many are called to labour in the Vineyard, that through unfaithfulness to their call, are never chosen among the faithful Labou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers in the work of the Lords Vineyard, <HI>therefore pray to the Lord of the Harvest, that he would send
<PB N="211" REF="000730_0219_0FAA45AEE5E43DB8"/>
forth more faithfull Labourers, or the Harvest is great, &amp; many unfaithfull Labourers there be,</HI> which hinder others from receiving the Truth, for they have sown divers strange seeds in the Lords Vineyard, where the many Pastors have trodden the Lords portion under foot, and have made his pleasant Portion a desolate Wilderness, which being desolate, it mourneth unto the Lord, for which cause the Lord hath sent his Servants, as in dayes past, to warn the learned wise rebellious Ones from the evil of their way, that People may find ease from under these heavy burdens, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h which their Teachers have yoked them, and encouraged them to beat one, destroy the other, perswading them it was good service for God in so doing, in which state many have itching ears, that will not endure to hear sound Doctrine, but heap up Teachers, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n them from the Truth into Fables, through which the Vinyard is encumbered with a multitude of fruitless Trees, Bryars, Thornes and Thistles, among which the Lyon waits for his prey, and the Subtil Foxes have their hiding places, where the Wolf also seeketh to devour, which things are left for Preachers to consider, and not to teach People, to dash one against the other, but to love one another, and to pray for their Enemies, and do no other thing to another, then they themselves are willing to be done unto, un∣til which time the Just Judgment of God is their Re∣ward, for all their evil wayes towards him and his People, for whom the Lord is making way, through his righteous Judgments, which take pleace upon all them that obey not his Word, to keep his commands, they like potsherds, shall even dash one against the other, until all be consumed, which is not fitly framed and temper∣ed
<PB N="212" REF="000730_0220_0FAA45AFEB75E290"/>
according to the Lords own mind, but the Lord is making way for the growth of his own Seed, which shall bring forth abundant of increase, to the praise of God, and honour of his Name▪ for the harvest is Great, and the Labourers are few, but the Lord will daily add more and more, that by the strength of his own Power, he will make his Vineyard fit, according to his own de∣sire, where every one shall remaine in peace under his own Vine, unto which many are gathered, and unto them will be the gathering.</P>

<P>IT hath been found lawful and expedient in all Ages, (as appears by the holy Scriptures) to record the Works of the Righteous, that as Land-Marks they might remain for all to follow them in the way of Righteousness, and also to record the Works of the Unrighteous, that as Way-Marks all might take warning to hate evil and do good; for had the first Inhabitants of <HI>New-England</HI> remained faithful under the Bishops Yoke, in fleeing from one City and Town to the other, the Yoke and Burden of Christ would have become easie and light, but not bearing the Cross of Christ▪ in opposition to their natural Wills, they

fled beyond the Command of God, in fleeing the Land, though seemingly under a fair pretence of gathering Churches, and planting them where Christ had not been once named. But their preaching their Gospel and planting their Churches, seemeth to me of the nature of the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> among the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>New Spain,</HI> who destroyed the Natives by Fire and Sword, even so was it with them that at first came to preach the Gospel and plant Churches in <HI>New-England,</HI> the effect of which Work is recorded in their Book of Gods Providences towards them, in suffering them to destroy the Natives, not considering how to love their Enemies, and to pray for them, unto whom the King of Heaven and Earth had given this Land to possess; but as in that day, by reason of the Native not understanding the nature of Guns and Powder, one <HI>English Man</HI> with his Gun, would put ten <HI>Indians</HI> to flight, so in fifty or sixty years time of being acquainted with the Unrighteousness of the <HI>English,</HI> they are now become so unrighteous in the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me-way, that as a Judgment upon the <HI>English,</HI> their Fire and Sword is so terrible, that at the sight of ten <HI>Indians</HI> do one hundred well armed <HI>English men</HI> take their flight; for the Natives now understanding Trade, do say, the <HI>English</HI> cheated them of their Land, and also of the many ten Thousand Pounds worth of Furs, with which they have traded with the <HI>English,</HI> who were bounded by a Law, that only a few of them, which were mostly in the Priests and Rulers favour, could trade, without paying five pounds in Money for every pint of strong Drink they sold to any <HI>Indian,</HI> without lisence from the Rulers, who did lisence such as aforesaid, to fell what they thought good, insomuch that some of the Traders have boasted, that their profit was one thousand pound in Furs, for one hundred

<HI>New England,</HI> hath no more answered the end, than all the Money and Goods, which in the time the Priests have received of their people for preaching; for in that day, the nearer people were drawn, by their Priests, to joyn with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Church, the further they were drawn from serving God in the true and living way, as is sufficiently manifest by their persecuting of People to death; so that the more the <HI>Indians</HI> complyed, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyning with the Church, the more subtiler they grew, and now in subtilty exceed the Foxes, Bears, Lyons and Wolves, which if a true man were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the one, he could have no true recompence by complaint to the other; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n which day they accounted their Devotion so holy, that if one that was a Member was was reading in his Psalm Book, and another that was no Member did but cast his eye, to behold what he was reading, the prerson that was reading would clo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e his Book, as a thing unfit for them, accounted as Dogs, to partake with with them in their holy things; and at that day, in the Church of <HI>Salem,</HI> the Women in time of service had their faces covered with a Vail, which practice did not many years continue, and when this practice was laid aside, they had (for the more order in their Church) to keep people from sleeping, a man that wholly tended with a short clubbed stick, having at the one end a knop, and at the other end a Fox Tayl, with which he would stroke the W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mens faces that were drousie to sleep, and with the other end would kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck unruly Dogs, and Men that were a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; in which time the Persecutors were not only known by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir persecuting, but also by their habit of high crown∣ed Hats, and two inch broad Bands, with short hair above or even with their Ears, and peaked B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ards, for their manner was to cut their hair by the brims of a dish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon

their heads. They had also a Law about Men and Wo∣mens Apparel, by which in wearing of black silk Hoods and Scar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, the Priests and Rulers Wives might be known from others, and them accounted rich might be known by their fine Cloth, and Gold and Silver Bottons, and there∣upon came they to receive Honour of the poorer sort, which were yearly rated to maintain their Priests, &amp;c. And in that day a man or woman, tho' never so base and wicked, yet should they find acceptance of favour with the Priests and Rulers, by informing against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> who were recorded as <HI>Lyars, Blasphemers, Seducers, Hereticks, Rogues</HI> and <HI>Vagabonds,</HI> with much more of the like nature.</P>
<P>Now having related in several places of this Book some∣what of the unrighteous Laws, Acts, Orders and Practices of <HI>New-England,</HI> I shall now relate a little concering their last insnaring Law against the same people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> through their pretended zeal for Conformity, by chusing <HI>Tyding Men</HI> in each Town under their Government, which were year after year sworn to give true Information vvhere they found the <HI>Quakers</HI> to meet, or any other professing people vvhich vvere not lisenced to meet by the Priests and Rulers, vvho for so meeting, according to that Lavv, did forfeit House and Land to the Country, and then the Priests and Rulerrs vvere called the Country; and the persons, of vvhat quality soever, that vvere taken at any of the the aforesaid Meetings, were forth-vvith to be vvell vvhipt in the house of Correction, the penalty of which Law several honest rich Merchants in <HI>Boston</HI> received, vvhich Law vvell pleased the Priests, not knovving hovv little time they had to ride the Rulers at their pleasure; but soon after this King <HI>Charles</HI> the second, vvith his Council or Parliament, called them to an account, and found that
<PB N="217" REF="000730_0225_0FAA45B5B4ED7FE0"/>
they had forfeited their Charter, and which was condemn∣ed, and for their misdemeanour towards him and his Subjects justly taken away. And in that Day their pre∣tended Holyness was such, that none but them of their own Profession were admitted to bear Office, or fight against their Enemies; but now they will accept the <HI>Mahoque Indians,</HI> or Pyrats, or them highly accused of Witch-craft, to be their chief Commanders; and instead of differing Apparel, all that can get it may wear what they please, most striving who sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l come nearest the newest <HI>French fashion</HI>; and instead of Womens Vails in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Worship, strive who can spy out the newest fashioned Apparel, and the richest and highest Top-knots, &amp;c. and too much let their minds out to discourse of these things, till their next Worship day I write not these things to reflect upon the People of <HI>New-England,</HI> but that they may repent of their evils, which provoke the Lords Judgments against a People that profess him in words, but deny him in Works; for which cause it was, that divers of the former Priests and Rulers were suddainly removed by the just hand of the Lord, which reached them by suddain Death▪ according as I have read in a printed Paper given to King <HI>Charles</HI> the second, and to his Council, that upon the day of putting to Death them four Persons called <HI>Quakers,</HI> many people to see them put to death▪ run over the Draw-bridge in <HI>Boston,</HI> which broke down, and several people hurt but only one Woman big with Child killed▪ and that was her who had said, <HI>That rather than those four</HI> Quakers <HI>should not be put to Death▪ for want of some one to hang them, that her Husband should perform the Work</HI>▪</P>
<P>The next in order was their Major General, whose

Horse threw him in all his Pomp, at the head of the Trai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-bands, and he dyed immediately in the same place.</P>
<P>The third was the Captain of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Castle, who was suddainly killed with Thunder, at which time the blades of his Souldiers Swords melted in their sheathes by their sides, yet all preserved alive.</P>
<P>The fourth and fifth were their two Captains which drove those innocent persons to their bloody Altar; the one was deprived of his natural Reason, and for filthiness degraded of his Church Brethren, and became eaten of Lice, and a reproach to them that met him. The other was given up to strong D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ink, and suddainly dyed.</P>
<P>The sixth of their Rulers, was one <HI>Webb,</HI> who was accused of Uncleanness with his near Kins-woman, he was strangely drowned, when all others in the same Boat, were out of danger.</P>
<P>The seventh was their Jaylor, a devout Member of their Church, who departed this Life in great horror of Conscience, confessing, <HI>it was for his great Cruelty to the poor Quakers.</HI></P>
<P>The eight is said to have rotted alive, and was he that condemned the innocent to dye</P>
<P>The nineth bled to Death, not known to have any Wound.</P>
<P>The tenth was one <HI>Ʋnderwood,</HI> a rich Baker, which wasted his Estate, and became a Servant in <HI>Virginia</HI> And another, which I well knew, did the like▪</P>
<P>The twelfth (a great Persecutor) was a rich Collonol, he ended miserably, being killed by the <HI>Indians</HI> in his own House, in a taunting way of reproach. And at the same time his Riches consumed by fire, and his Daughter taken Captive.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="000730_0227_0FAA45B7244EFF88"/>The thirteenth was <HI>John Norton,</HI> their high Priest in <HI>Boston,</HI> who preached in the fore-part of the day, and in the latter part of the day, its said, he confessed, <HI>the hand of God was upon him,</HI> and so dyed.</P>
<P>And as the Word of the Lord was by the Mouth of his Servants to <HI>John Indicot</HI> Governour, even so is it, for his fair Dwellings in <HI>Boston</HI> are become a Barn, and Stable for Cows and Horses; and one can hardly find where his fair Dwelling in <HI>Salem</HI> stood. And of all his other great Estate in Lands and Livings, its well known, that on four pence a day for labour, many honest men in <HI>Old England</HI> have and do live far more better than any of his Posterity upon the aforesaid great Estate, and yet I know not any of them extravagant, but things do not prosper with them.</P>

<P>I Can also allow that there is the Tree of Life likewise in Paradise, as we find recorded in the holy Scripture, whose fruit might have been so seasoned, and endued by God, and how it had that nature that he who should eat of it, <HI>should live forever, and never dye</HI>; and when <HI>Adam</HI> had eaten of the forbidden Tree, and had fallen, as God fore∣told, into Death, it might not now be that he should be permitted to eat of the Tree of Life, otherwise he might have lived forever, and the Word of God, <HI>if thou eat thereof thou shalt dye the Death,</HI> had been false.

<P>Now may it not thus be, that for a greater Evidence or Testimony, that the same thing did likewise happen in the Tree Paradise, <HI>i. e.

Thus do I, and also other faithful Writers, interpret whinged Sin and obstinate Disobedience, which is else-where called in Scripture, <HI>a seperation or wall of partition</HI>; for whoso eats of the Tree of Knowledge of

good and evil, that is he that greedily swallows down and devoureth humane and diabolical Wisdom, he is already seperated from the Tree of Life, that is, from the Wisdom, Speech and Knowledge of God; and neither of these Wis∣doms Speeches, Wills or Knowledges can endure the other, neither can the one come from the other, so great is the Gulf between them, being as far divided asunder as Heaven and Hell. He that eats of the Tree of Life, that is, of the Word of God, he is born of God, and cannot dye nor sin, for his Fruit doth eat the Eaten, and trans∣late him into his own Nature, that is▪ into Life, as else-where the Scripture speaketh of <HI>eating Christs flesh</HI>; for in∣deed it is the same thing to eat Christ, and to drink his Blood, to live in his Word, to believe, to know God and the like; as likewise it is all one to believe in <HI>Adam,</HI> to live in <HI>Adam,</HI> to dye to eat of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, to obey the Seed and Word of the Serpent, and to become Gods; therefore he that eats of the deadly Tree, and cleaves to the Word and Wisdom of the Serpent, being born of Satan, and afflicted, he lives in flesh and blood, and therefore cannot do well, or please God; as contrary wise, the other cannot sin, do evil, or displease God; Therefore he that will have the one, must needs part with the other, they must of necessity go out of the Wisdom of <HI>Adam</HI> and the Serpent, and from the forbidden Tree, that so the Wisdom of the Tree of Life may enter, to abide in them; <HI>Adam,</HI> and the Wisdom of the flesh must dye in them, that Christ may live in them, and the Spirit may have the government; the Life of the one is the Death of the other, and the weakness of one is the strength of the other; <HI>for no man can serve two Masters,</HI> and in vain shall men strive to reconcile <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Adam,</HI> or <HI>Christ</HI> and

into the nature of <HI>Adam,</HI> that the Serpents seed and word was in <HI>Adam,</HI> made a corporal man; so that now the same thing may be said of them both, and as they are, that are born of God, and in whom the Word of God is made man, or flesh, are called Gods, and one Spi∣rit with God, so all men being sprung of flesh and blood before they be planted into Christ, and are born of the Spirit, they are justly called Devils, and the De∣vils Children and Off-spring of the Devil, whose work they do, therefore that which is only humane, is evil, and that which is devilish, is humane. And again, what is the fall of <HI>Adam</HI> but the wisdom of the Flesh, and the fruit of the forbidden Tree?

<P>THe nature of which Lust or Devil, lusteth to covet after that Which God hath expresly forbidden, namely, the <HI>Tree of Knowledg of good and evil,</HI> which causeth men to become as Gods, whose Eyes are opened against themselves, to perceive the Tree good for Food, and pleasent to the eyes, and a Tree to make one wise, therefore do they covet after the fruit of the Tree, and greedily eat of it, not considering how they eat Death, and dye to God, as <HI>Adam</HI> did, even so is it with every man that is not planted into the Tree of Life, and new born of Christ, regenerated, and brought forth by the immor∣tal Seed, the Word of God, the Spirit of Truth, and Seed of his Kingdom, but on the contrary, covet after the perishing things of this World, thereby to enrich themselves there-with, contrary to what God hath com∣manded, <HI>first to seek the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Righ∣teousness thereof,</HI> unto which is the promise, of <HI>adding all other things</HI>; for as the Promise was on condition to <HI>Adam, To do and live,</HI> so hath it been the same, to all men in every age, and is the same in this day, therefore let none deceive themselves, for the doers of the Law were only them that kept the Word of the Lord, who accounted them worthy of receiving Life, to live with God forever; for to the Disobedient, who are only hearers of the Word, and not doers of the Word, there is no true peace, neither in this Life, nor in the Life to come; <HI>for there is no peace to

for Man, in his own wisdom, will and time, hath always the eye of Knowledge and Reason open against himself, in which state he cannot receive the will and mind of God from above, because he giveth way to serve his own Lusts, which are his Enemies, that ensnare his Soul and keep his Mind in Bondage, to serve this and the other thing of his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nvention, in which abideth Death and Destruction; and indeed, of this nature is every mans God, that liveth not to the true God, in thought, word and work, according to his Word, which he teacheth and formeth in all them that abide faithful, which without faithfulness to what God hath commanded, no man can come unto him; there∣fore it is that every covetous, proud and unrighteous man is shut out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom having any entrance into the true saving knowledge of God, because to him is not the true God retained in any of his Thoughts, which of his own lust are moved here and there, and indeed every where into this and the other thing, which abideth but for a time, and then leaveth the Mind, or the Mind leaveth it, and so in its motion; which is swift indeed for another thing of the like nature, in which abideth Death.

And again, Covetousness is of Lust, such a Devil, that contrives and joyns so close and fast to the mind of men, that some have lost their lives by sorrow for worldly goods; for a covetous man can meet with no greater sorrow than to part with that in which his love doth most abide; for above all other things, that which a man doth most love to delight his mind in, that is to him his Godd; therefore is it that bear outside <HI>Christians</HI> are so entangled with the things of this Life; <HI>for where the Trea∣sure is, there is the heart also,</HI> and yet extream righteous, as towards the Law of men, which often is extream wrong in the sight of God, because a covetous man takes the oppor∣tunity to enrich himself by another mans necessity, whereby the borrower rather becomes a slave than a servant to the lender, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, through covetousness, can in no wise simpa∣thize nor participate with his friend or neighbour in loss or

cross whatever, because the affectionate part is only to self, so as covetousness can do no good work to it self, neither can it do that which is properly good to another, therefore is it not safe to be too far concerned with the god of any covetous Usurer, for as it wholly tends to the destruction of the soul of him that binds, so it also tends to impoverish him that is bound; for the lust of a covetous man, namely, the Devil, his idol and god, will never suffer the rust and canker to feed upon his Money, nor the mote to devour his goods, more than to supply the necessity of any man with∣out interest; so that the mercy and pity of a covetous man is plain Cruelty, not only to his own soul, but also to the body of others, who are concerned with the idol or god of a covetous man, whose mind is always bent towards the enlarging of his idol; therefore he taketh the opportunity of every advantage, by bill, bond, mortgage, and the like, to enrich himself with those things which will perish with him, except he repent; and of this natu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, by opportu∣nity, through advantage of another mans necessiy, do men enrich and impoverish one another; so that Oppression among men is like to a sweeping rain, which drives all from one man into the bounds and possession of another, through which many men are enlarged with Mountains, Hills and Vallies, when many have not whereon to set their foot; and of this nature is it that Covetousness leads to Usury, Oppression, and the like which hath divided the things of this World, and is the only portion of every covetous, proud and vain man, which does not forsake and repent of all his evil deeds, and covet after the better part, unto which is the promise, <HI>of adding all things needful</HI>; there∣fore is it written, <HI>The Righteous are never forsaken, nor their seed begging Bread.

them, but with the wicked it shall go ill.</HI> Therefore study after Righteousness, and covet after the better part, against which, lust to covetousness, cannot prevail; for lust to covet after the Riches of this World, is as natural to the Children of men, as the ground is natural to bring forth Weeds; therefore is it, that men by nature, of their own wills, wisdoms, knowledges, reasons, righteousnesses, and the like, will not come under the cross, to hear and obey <HI>Moses</HI> and the Prophets, to fulfil what the Law required of him to do; so also are they accursed which refuse to bear and obey the Voice of the Son of God, whose gift of divine light is the condemnation of every covetous mans thoughts, words and works; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o that Covetousness is of no profit to any man that gains the riches of this world, with the loss of his soul; <HI>but godl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness, with content, is great gain, to them that fear God, work righteousness, do justly, love mercy, walk humbly, and do no other thing to others, than as themselves would be done unto.</HI> Yet notwithstanding this, and whatever else is written in the holy Scriptures against Covetousness, how do men daily nourish and cherish it, as if it were a godd of such a nature and life, as to abide with them forever; therefore are they so choice of this lust of unrighteousness, that for its sin they provide the largest cloak; for of all other sins, Covetousness is most in credit among the Sons of men, therefore they will not let this Devil go naked, but cloath it with credible Names, not as sin or vile, but as <HI>thrift, provident good care of a mans own,</HI> and <HI>care of the main chance,</HI> and not only so, but will protect and defend it with Scripture words, <HI>viz.

wise and prudent of this World, who, through coveting after Money, <HI>the love of which is the root of all evil, in them that will neither enter the Kingdom of Heaven, nor suffer others which are entering, to go therein</HI>; which doth manifest their Covetousness to exclude all love and fear to God, and all love and pity to their Neighbours good. Nay, what sin is it, that Covetousness leads men not to commit? it leadeth them that are covetous to oppress, cozen, deceive, lye, and sell their Conscience for every trifle; also, it leads men to turn from the Faith, betray the Truth, sell it for Money, and to hold the Truth in Unrighteousness; it leads men to forsake all good Religion, to turn Persecutors, which is the greatest Oppression that can be, for it sweeps away the Life and Estate of many men; it leads men to wait as Troops of Robbers, to kill and destroy by the consent of unrigh∣teous Laws, which have been made by covetous Usurers. And I may say, Covetousness not only leads men to kill and steal by the high-way, but to rob God of his honour, by stealing his words which he spake by the mouth of his holy Ones, whose words they sell for Money, each looking for his gain from his Quarter, which if any man refuse to pay, open war is prepared against him; and of this, and the like nature doth Covetousness lead men to sin against God, even to the destroying of their peace with him; <HI>for to the Wicked there is no true peace in this life, nor in the Life to come. Covetousness</HI> is one of the chief gates and Inlets to the broad way of <HI>Death, Hell</HI> and <HI>Destruction,</HI> and is so delightful and well-pleasing, that many are led thereby into all manner of Abominations, even to rebel against God and King, and to change the form of Worship at every change in Government. In short, it leadeth Parents to destroy their Children, and Children to destroy their
<PB N="252" REF="000730_0260_0FAA45D6D208E9B0" MS="y"/>
Parents; also, it leadeth men to lye and swear, and to hold the the Truth in unrighteousness, and to pervert the truth, thereby to turn the cause of the Fatherless and Widdow. Therefore let all men beware of coveting after that which God hath forbidden; for while some have beên coveting after Riches, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows, because it is such a sin, that it draws the soul of him that is over much righ∣teous, into perdition; for over much righteous before men, is over much wicked in the sight of God, because its only mans own works, which is plain hypocrisie and deceit, and indeed so are all things which are not done by man in truth and sincerity, with uprightness of heart and mind to God, whose all-seeing eye beholdeth the evil and the good in all men whatever, among whom the heart of some that labour to be rich, is pierced through with many sorrows; for it is written, <HI>They that will be rich, fall into many Temptations, and a Snare, and many foolish and hurtful Lusts, which draw men into perdition</HI>; for lust to Covetousness, is such a subtil Enemy, and the Devils snare is so cunningly contrived, and so full of fair pretences, that let a man be once in love with Money, he knows not which way to wind himself out; for it doth so bewilder, fetter and entangle his mind, even to the destruction of his soul, and loss of body also, yet how vehemently with care and diligence, will men vindi∣cate Covetousness, because that care and diligence there may be, and ought to be, but the truth is, every covetous man makes care and diligence a cloak for Covetousness, whereby he is sheltered against all reproof; in which state mans life among his Neighbours is not much desireable, neither by the Poor lamented at his Death, but rather re∣joyce at the dividing of his Idol, to whom God hath not

which work of the Spirit of Life, there is nothing of mans own Wisdom, Knowledge, Will or Reason, for the work is wholly wrought of God, through faith and obe∣dience, to hear, believe and obey Gods gift of Grace, his Spirit of Truth by Jesus Christ, who for his works sake imputeth it to them for Righteousness; for faithful <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> beleived God to trust in his promise, but his faith was not without Works of Obedience, nor according to his own knowledge, wisdom, will and reason, but in Gods time, according to his own knowledge and wisdom, through which the work done by <HI>Abraham,</HI> was done in Faith and Obedience to God, whose will was done on Earth, as it was done in Heaven; therfore is it writen, <HI>that as the body is dead without the spirit, so is also Faith dead without Works,</HI> that by whomsoever works are not ma∣nifested, agreeable to Gods holy Truth, and example of his holy People in days past, they are only <HI>Christians</HI> in name, and not in nature of that life, which God re∣quireth of all men to live and abide in; therefore it is, that people profit not by what they hear or read, because they are spiritually dead having blinded Eyes and deaf Ears, with which they can neither see, hear, nor receive to understand the Spirit of Truth, of which a manifestation is given to every man to profit withal, and is the gift of his Spirit, the Word of Faith to them that will hear, to obey the Light of the Spirit of Truth, which is the condemnation of the Disobedient, who are here and there, in this and the other Form of Religion, serving God with mouth and lip, in their own wisdom, wills, and with their own words, being only called by the Name of Christ, without the Nature of his Life, which being destitute of, no man can be a true <HI>Christian,</HI> yet how contentedly do men live and abide in

this and the other form, but do not witness the strength of the power of God to redeem from sin and transgression, and to make alive to God, who is only a God them that through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the flesh, and through the Spirit are brought in again, by the flying Cherub and glittering Sword of Gods power, in and by Christ the Tree of everlasting Life, on which as any eats he cannot dye to God, but hath an infallible assurance of life in the Son of God, without which assurance no man can truly say, <HI>that he pleaseth God in thought, word and deed</HI>; for it is the anointing, which is by the Tree of Life, that teacheth all things, &amp; which leadeth into all Truth, the evi∣dence of which Spirit doth assure the Son, in whom there is life, and the nature of his life dwelleth and abideth in them, that by true faith in him, and obedience to the word of his Spirit, they are made alive unto God; and of this nature is Christ in his people, <HI>and in whom he is not, they are Reprobates, and in whom he abideth not, they are cursed Children,</HI> abiding under the curse in their own wisdom, knowledge, will, reason, righteousness, and the like, which causeth them to lust more and more after the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, for which cause they rebel against the Spirit of God in themselves, and deny his appear∣ance in his People; for which cause of Rebellion, which is as the sin of Witch-craft, the Truth of God abideth not in them; therefore are they without God in the world, living to their own God, of which, in the world there are many that delight, and sweetly recreate their minds in, by living a life of obedience to their own ways of righteousness, which only proceeds from lust, that gives way for men to live according as their own will and reason directeth them, in all they do for God, and to one another, all which is

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Concerning Judgment begun at the House of God, and in his House to judge down every appearance of evil.</HEAD>
<P>THe House of God in general, where Judgment first be∣ginneth, is his people, but Judgment cometh to every Transgressor of his holy Truth, and that to judge down every appearance of evil; therefore said one in his day, <HI>Who shall deliver me from this Body of sin &amp; death?</HI> Now the Body of this man was the House of God, and Temple of the holy Ghost, in which God by his Judgment was at work, to judge down, cast out and destroy every lust that would evalt it self above the Witness of God, that the House of God

might be throughly cleansed, and only become a house of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oly Habitation for the Spirit of Truth to abide in; for as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is written, <HI>The high &amp; holy one who inhabits Eternity, dwelleth not in Temples made with hands, but taketh up his abode with men of clean hearts &amp; contrite spirits, that fear him and work righteous∣ness, do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly,</HI> such bear the image of God and nature of Christ, with whom, and in whom both Father and Son do take up their abode; therefore where men give not up to come under the cross, and follow the light and word of Gods Spirit, in obedience to his call, they resist the holy one, &amp; crucifie him afresh to themselves, such defile the house and temple of God, and them will God destroy; &amp; indeed, how many such people (with a fair <HI>Israel</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Religion) are crept into a profession of Gods Truth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrough deceit, have, under the like profession, entered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>selves as Christians among the People of God; but he that caused the Net to be cast into the Sea, which brought forth good and bad to the shore, the same doth permit the net of profession to gather all sorts of People into the out∣ward name <HI>Christian,</HI> therefore doth Judgment also begin at the House of God, which are his people, to make a seper∣ation between the precious and the vile, not only to purge and cleanse from lusts, but also, to cut off the stubborn and stiff-necked ones, which will not submit to the cross, whose Judgment will also reach to the old Age of them that live in disobedience to the Spirit of Truth; for Judgment from God hath spread it self to the ends of the Earth, and hath begun its work at the house of God. <HI>If the righteous scarcely are saved, where shall the ungodly and sinners appear?</HI> Judgment is not come to bring peace to any unrighteous person, but is gone forth to do the work of God among the People, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, both inwardly and outwardly lay waste and destroy all

Let all therefore consider in what state they abide, as to God, whose promise to the Righteous is, <HI>That it shall go well with them, but it shall go ill with the Wicked</HI>; Therefore let not these Truths which have been received by the Spirit of Truth, find itching Ears among any, but as every man turn in his mind to the Spirit of Truth, he will witness the truth of these Things.</P>
