if the Lamentations would Rowse any of those, over whom we make them. We have seen several Plantations in our Neighbour∣hood, laid in Blood and Fire, by those Inva∣ders, to whom our <HI>Security</HI> is the Chief Thing that has made us Obnoxious. But we may do well to enquire, whether we are not in that <HI>Security,</HI> which may lay us as o∣pen to the Displeasure of God, as to the Vexati∣on of man. There are two Things besure which Conspire to invite us, unto that <HI>Sinful Sleep,</HI> whereof and whereby we are Endange∣red. <HI>Within,</HI> we have our <HI>Corruption,</HI> to bring <HI>Sleep</HI> upon us. When the Disciples were <HI>Sleeping,</HI> our Lord said upon it, in <HI>Math.</HI> 26.41. <HI>The Flesh is Weak.</HI> The <HI>Flesh</HI> is all for <HI>Sleep</HI>; that Sluggish kind of a thing, will be ever saying, <HI>Yet a little more Sleep, a litlte more Slumber, a little more folding of the Hands</HI>; and this <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esh</HI> will haunt us as long as we dwell in <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esh.

fume, and frett, and fling, and say, <HI>VVhat a needless disturbance are you making here</HI>? And so for the sake of quietness, we must all <HI>Sleep</HI> as it seems, till Dooms Day. But let it for such causes then be thought upon, <HI>VVhether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are not Asleep</HI>? It was long since Judg'd, that the witty person, who while others were begging of monopolies, petition'd for a <HI>Patent,</HI> which might enable him, <HI>To Demand a small Piece of money from every One who carried a VVatch about him, and yet cared not how he spent his time,</HI> would have had a large Reve∣nue, But it were well if they that keep a <HI>VVatch</HI> over their Hearts and Ways, were one half so many, as those that now wear a <HI>VVatch</HI> about them in their Cloaths. I have these <HI>Interrogatories</HI> for you.</P>
<P>First; If we are not <HI>Asleep,</HI> why are we so <HI>Senseless,</HI> before the Almighty God? There is that <HI>Spiritual Plague</HI> mentioned, in <HI>Isa.</HI> 6.10. <HI>A Fat Heart, Heavy Ears, and Shut-up Eyes</HI>; which is perhaps oftner quoted in the <HI>New-Testament</HI> than almost any one passage of the <HI>Old</HI>; bceause it is the Grand <HI>Plague</HI> under the <HI>New-Testament.</HI> But has not this <HI>New-Testament-Plague,</HI> most fearfully siezed upon multitudes among us? The <HI>Voice</HI> of God, how few have the <HI>Sense</HI> to hear that Thundring <HI>Voice</HI>? Upon the <HI>Promises</HI> of God we say not, <HI>These are Faithful Sayings, and worthy of all Accepta∣tion; O may I have the Godliness, which they belong unto</HI>▪ Upon the <HI>Threatenings</HI> of God,
<PB N="36" REF="000622_0036_0FA95F940D045DF0"/>
we say not, <HI>These are the Faithful, and the True Sayings, which will shortly come to pass: O may I be afraid of these Judgments!</HI> Altho' we may say with the Psalmist, <HI>God hath spoken once, yea, twice unto us,</HI> yet the Lord may say to us, as by the Prophet, <HI>I spake unto thee, and thou wouldest not hear.</HI> The <HI>Face</HI> of Christ, how few have the <HI>Sense</HI> to see that Beauteous <HI>Face?</HI> We do not gaze upon the most Illustrious Excellencies of our Lord-Redeemer, until we say, <HI>He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, in whom there does all Fullness dwell,</HI> and? <HI>Here is the One Thing Needful.</HI> Altho' He be the, <HI>Altoge∣ther Lovely,</HI> yet we have not such a view of Him, as to make us <HI>Love</HI> Him; altho' He be the, <HI>Pearl of Great Price,</HI> yet we have not such a view of Him, as to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Prize</HI> Him; we <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sire</HI> Him not, altho' He be, <HI>The Desir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of all Nations.</HI> The <HI>Load</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> how few have the <HI>Sense</HI> to feel the weight of that Mountainous <HI>Load</HI>? How few, <HI>Labouring and Heavy-Laden Souls,</HI> are to be found among the Sinners that have all their Dayes been those, <HI>That Heap up Wrath against themselves▪</HI> How few do with Restless Terrors of Soul account them∣selves, <HI>Wretched and Poor, and Miserable and Blind, and Naked</HI>: and not rather say, <HI>I have Need of Nothing?</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, If we are not <HI>Asleep,</HI> why are we so <HI>Fearless,</HI> of what may be to come upon us? 'Tis said of some, Said in <HI>Job.</HI> 21:9.
<PB N="37" REF="000622_0037_0FA95F94D5B1C988"/>
<HI>Their Houses are safe from Fear.</HI> But it may be Said of more, <HI>There is in their Hearts no Godly Fear.</HI> Alas, there are multitudes of <HI>Le∣viat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans</HI> for Sinning in the miost of us, and such as have <HI>Made themselves without Fear.</HI> We have long had a dreadful Hurricane of the Divine Judgments upon us; but men are like <HI>Jonah,</HI> fast <HI>Asleep,</HI> while the Great God seems to be sinking of us, in the Ro∣ring Billows of his Wrath. There is a <HI>Flood</HI> of cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mitous Acci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents ready to Roll in upon us; but are we like <HI>Noah,</HI> who, <HI>By Faith, being moved with Fear, prepared an Ark</HI>▪ There is a <HI>Combination</HI> of Enemies for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Desolation; but are we like <HI>Jeheshaphat,</HI> who, <HI>Feared and Proclaimed a Fast</HI>? The Word of God has loudly told the Unconverted People in our Neighbourhood, <HI>That an horrible Tem∣pest of Eternal Vengeance is impending over their miserable Souls.</HI> But how few are like those wary <HI>Egyptians,</HI> who of old, <HI>Feared the Word of the Lord?</HI> and not rather like the impudent <HI>Sod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mites</HI> that would go on to Sin, when they were just stepping into, <HI>The Vengeance of Eternal Fire?</HI> Altho' the Almighty God have Sounded in our Ears, the <HI>Alarms</HI> of His Ever∣lasting Indignation, if we do not Return from our Evil Ways; yet Sinners, like the fiery War-Horse, do <HI>mock at Fear,</HI> and <HI>Laugh a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the shaking of the Spear.</HI> How few among u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can say with the Apostle, <HI>I know the Ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs of the Lord?</HI> How few with the Psalmist, <HI>O
<PB N="38" REF="000622_0038_0FA95F95D0EE9840"/>
Lord, my Flesh Trembles for fear of thee?</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, If we are not <HI>Asleep,</HI> why are w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so <HI>Mindless</HI> of what we have to do? 'Tis said unto some in <HI>Psal.</HI> 50.22. <HI>Consider this, you that Forget God.</HI> But how many are there whom that Note is to be Branded upon, <HI>They Forget God, and never Consider what He has call'd them to?</HI> With what a Brutal Stupidity, do men Forget the <HI>Errand</HI> which they were sent into the World upon? which is, <HI>To Glorifie God.</HI> Our main Business in the World is, <HI>By Re∣penting, &amp; Believing to make sure of Everlasting Happiness, &amp; in the continual exercise of Religion, bear our Testimonies unto all the Truths and Ways of the God that made us.</HI> But is not this Business, utterly laid aside by the most of men? Men Employ themselves, as if they had nothing in the world to do, but build and fill a little <HI>Nest</HI> made of Straw &amp; Clay, where∣in after they themselves have been <HI>Merry</HI> for <HI>many years,</HI> their young ones may be comfor∣tably Lodged after them. <HI>Vain Man!</HI> And knowest thou not how soon the Cudgels of <HI>Death</HI> may batter down that little <HI>Nest</HI>? I have one Question to send round unto every man in this great Assembly; 'tis this, <HI>Pray, what have you been doing in the world, ever since you came into it?</HI> How few among us, could Re∣late any other than a most wretched Story, in a True Answer to that great Question? When our Lord was going to Dy, He could say, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther, I have Finished the Work, which thou
<PB REF="000622_0039_0FA95F968D5ACAF0"/>
hast given me to do.</HI> But many of us, if we were to Dy immediately, must with most in∣expressible Stings in our Souls, confess, <HI>O I have never yet struck so much as one good Stroke at the Work which has been ordered for me.</HI> And hence also, how little concerned are we to know and use, the wonderful <HI>Opportunities</HI> wherewith we are furnished in our several <HI>Capacities,</HI> to be doing or getting of Good? We have our <HI>Talents</HI>; that is, our <HI>Opportuni∣ties</HI> to Serve the Interests of God, of the Church, of our own Souls: But we suffer our <HI>Talents</HI> to lie by most shamefully unim∣proved; and there are very few that seriously and frequently ask themselves, <HI>What is there that I may do for the further Service of my God, and of my Generation</HI>?</P>
<P>Fourthly. We are <HI>Speechless,</HI> and should we be so, if we were not fast <HI>Asleep?</HI> If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were falsely charged upon <HI>Job.</HI> in Chap 15.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou restrainest Prayer before God</HI>; it may be too <HI>Truly</HI> charged upon ourselves.

And no such Command of our Lord as that, <HI>Enter into thy Closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, Pray to thy Father which is in secret.</HI> How many <HI>Houses</HI> also are there, that have not <HI>Private Prayers</HI> every Day performed in them?

yet plainly and freely enough, given you my own Little Opinion, WHEREABOUTS WE ARE IN TIME▪ and therefore I will now humbly do it. I do conceive, That the <HI>Antichrist,</HI> having before pas∣sed his <HI>Time,</HI> and his <HI>Times,</HI> did enter his Last <HI>Half Time</HI> at the REFORMATIO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Last Century, Commenced at the Year 1517.

Wherefore, about an <HI>Half Time,</HI> that is, a∣bout an Hundred and Fourscore Years, from that REFORMATION, I do firmly expect, a NEW REFORMATION to be began; a REFORMA∣TION more Glorious, more Heavenly, more Unive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sal far away than what was in the former Century together with most formidable Desolations to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from Heaven, upon those that shall incurably retai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an Antipathy to this REFORMATION.

<P>In the Prosecution of this REFORMATION, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve but ONE THING at <HI>this Time,</HI> further to lay before you.

<P><Q>Among other Expedients in order thereunto, we cannot but Recommend it as very Advisable, That the several Churches having in an <HI>Instrument,</HI> pro∣per for that purpose, made a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of such Things, as can indisparably be found amiss among them, do with all seriousness and solemnity, pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their VOTES, That they count such Things to be very Offensive Evils, and that Renouncing all De∣pendence on their own strength, to avoid such E∣vils, they humbly ask the Help of the Divine Grace, to assist them in watching against the said Evils, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth in themselves, and in one another. And that the <HI>Communicants</HI> do often Reflect upon those their ACKNOWLEDGMENTS and PROTESTATI∣ONS, as perpetual MONITORS unto them, to prevent the Miscarriages, wherewith too many Pro∣fessors are too easily overtaken.</Q></P>
