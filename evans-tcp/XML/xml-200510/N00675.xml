<P>THis little Tract was hatcht by the warmth of your de∣sires: it hath broke shell too hastily: It looks but callow and speeds to your bosome for wing and protection. The bonds of na∣ture, grace and promise oblige it from me: I wish it 'twere worthy your view, might help your faith or raise your joy.

When reason budded,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Deut. 32.2.</HI></NOTE> your wholsome and godly coun∣sels ever dropt as <HI>rain,</HI> your speech as <HI>dew,</HI> as small rain upon the tender herb, and as showers upon the grass. The warmth of your affection cherisht me un∣der the divine influence into a flower: your wisdom then transplanted me into the nurseries of grace and learning, and at length to the Muses garden at <HI>Ox∣ford.</HI> It was ever your pious care to place me under the shadow of holy Tu∣tors. I magnifie God and thankfully ac¦knowledge your prudence and love. My body indeed was ever but tender and weak: your affections strong and vigo∣rous, your charges great, your solicitous thoughts were ever wakeful, that no un∣kind storm might blow upon me. I prosper'd, for God was with you, your prayers went up, his blessing came <HI>down,</HI> and lo, by the grace of God. I hope your labour hath not been altogether in vain in the Lord. You watcht me, and the Lord us both, and hath kept us as the apple of his eye, and hath blest up toge∣ther many lustres of years.

<P>Dear Sir, my <HI>Request</HI> follows. The God of Heaven hath sprung a branch out of your roots, and given you to see a grand son of your own bowels.

<P>He is design'd for the Sanctuary: if the Lord please to accept and gift him, and to blesse his times with seasons and places of whole-some and pious literature. Be pleased to blesse him as a free-will of∣fering in the name of the Lord, that your little <HI>Samuel</HI> may be girt with a linnen Ephod to minister before him in <HI>Shiloh,</HI> to burn incense and whole burnt offerings upon his Altar: that grace being poured upon his heart and lips, he may have the tongue of the learned to speak a word in season to weary souls.</P>
<P>Honoured Sir, My humble <HI>Prayer</HI> re∣mains that the great God of Heaven would please graciously to support your Spirits under the weakness of age, that you may never want the staffe of <HI>Jacobs</HI> faith to lean upon, in the hour of worship; that your sleep may be sweet in <HI>Bethel</HI> upon the Corner-stone, and afterwards may ascend the Seraphical Ladder after the great <HI>Angel</HI> of the Covenant into Heaven, that over all your sacrifices of

<P>KIng <HI>David</HI> from his Royal Palace in Mount <HI>Zion,</HI> might feast his eyes with many dilicious Prospects.</P>
<P N="1">1. The first and chiefest was the Ta∣bernacle of the Lord of Hosts, who <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psa.</HI> 87.2.</NOTE><MILESTONE N="1"/> loved the <HI>gates of that mountain,</HI> more then all the dwellings of <HI>Jacob.</HI> This holy Prince delighted in communion
<PB N="2" REF="000820_0010_0FAB4297AE019680"/>
with God and therefore is fryled a man after Gods own heart: he <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 13.1.2, 4, 5.</NOTE> <HI>swore</HI> against the slumber of his eye-lids, till he found a place for the Lord, a habitation for the mighty God of <HI>Jacob.</HI> And where did he fix the Tents of the holy One of <HI>Isra∣el</HI>? did he not bring up the Ark from the house of <HI>Obed-Edam</HI> into the <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sam</HI> 6 12.</NOTE> <HI>City of David</HI> with gladness? For <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psa.</HI> 132.13.</NOTE> the Lord had chosen <HI>Zion,</HI> he desired it for his habitation. Thrice happy those Princes, who entertain the pure Worship of God within their Courts. They shall <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ps.</HI> 89.15.</NOTE> know the <HI>joyful sound</HI> of Temple-mu∣sick they shall walk, O Lord, in the shi∣ning light of thy countenance.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"/> A Second lovely Prospect with which <HI>David</HI> enamelled his eyes, was the plea∣sant City of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ps.</HI> 122.3</NOTE> a <HI>City Compact</HI> together, <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal</HI> 48 2, 3.</NOTE> beautiful for sci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uation, the joy of the whole earth, God is known in her Palaces for a refuge</P>
<P>A third, Was the valley of <HI>Kidron,</HI> a <MILESTONE N="3"/> dark valley through shades and precipi∣tious rocks Its name from <HI>Kedar,</HI> ob∣scurities and thick shadows, environed with mountains and a swift torrent tril∣ling along its caverns This gave a comely off set to the neighbouring hills: here were the shady strokes of natures pencil the more to illustrate the bright pie∣ces of this holy Land-skip, Hence were re∣doubled the pleasant and warbling eccho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the silver-Trumpets at new Moons and Sacrifices.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="000820_0011_0FAB42986F8125E8"/>The fourth and last, was the three-ridged <MILESTONE N="4"/> mount of <HI>Olivet</HI> fruitful, healthful, and pleasant.</P>
<P>In the first of these Prospects, he saw the holy One of <HI>Israel</HI> walking in his San∣ctuary, and enjoyed sweet fellowship with the divine Oracles. From the se∣cond, he took a view of the State of this vain life. In the third, he might raise Contemplations upon the house of all living. In the fourth, he beheld as in a glass, a glorious cast of the Resurrection, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Zach.</HI> 14 4.</NOTE> the day of Judgment, and Ascention to Heaven.</P>
<P>The sweet Singer of <HI>Israel</HI> had tuned in consort with his Harp, many choice Meditations, near the murmuring waters of <HI>Kidron,</HI> and here in this <HI>Psalm</HI> he playes upon the valley it self. Let's descant on his Lesson in four parts.</P>
<P N="1">1. Here's a comparison of the state of death, to a <HI>walk</HI> in the shady valley of <HI>Ki∣dron.</HI> I know it is usual to interpret the <MILESTONE N="1"/> <HI>shadow of death,</HI> by great and deep afflicti∣ons, but I shall accept the phrase in this method: In its first notion, <HI>that darkness</HI> which seizes upon persons ready to die, is represented. In a second the <HI>grave</HI> and <HI>death</HI> it self. Its plain by the confe∣rences of <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Job</HI> 3.5 <HI>&amp;</HI> 10.21 <HI>&amp;</HI> 34 22 <HI>&amp;</HI> 38.17.</NOTE> <HI>Job</HI> with his Arabian com∣forters, 'twas Eastern language. In a third by a <HI>Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alepsis,</HI> those <HI>horrors</HI> and <HI>terrors</HI> that attend the agonies of dying mortals: yea, any <HI>grievous calamities</HI> that
<PB N="4" REF="000820_0012_0FAB42A2B7B619A8"/>
paint the face of death to the life in the glass of imagination.</P>
<P>Here under an elegant Allegory holy <HI>David</HI> prosecutes the divine shephear∣dy: Gods gracious care and conduct. The green pastures and the chrystal streams with which his soul was refresht; Not doubting but goodness and mercy should follow him all the dayes of his life, and although he should be lead through the valley of the grave; the Li∣ons and the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ars, the Tygers and the Wolves of those fell bottomes should not scare him. <HI>I will fear no evil for thou art with me.</HI> Assuring himself that the great Shepheard of <HI>Israel</HI> had wisdom and power sufficient to guide him safely and at length to enclose this sheep of his Pasture in the Folds of his house <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ps.</HI> 23.6.</NOTE> of glo∣ry <HI>for ever.</HI> Other shepheards tremble at the yelling of the Lions, and the print of their foot stamps horror, much more to convey their Flocks under such dis∣mal shadows be the <HI>shades</HI> never so ver∣dant, and the gliding brooks never so sweet and pleasant; lest they and their sheep prove sorry comforters to one a∣nother, when they slide together into the Maws of such ravening Butchers. But here's a blessed and glorious shep∣heard <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Muscul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Loc.</HI></NOTE> (<HI>qui sciens prudensq, ducet in mortem ipsam</HI>:) who purposes and re∣solves to lead his Flock through the
<PB N="5" REF="000820_0013_0FAB42A33049C930"/>
jaws of death; So that <HI>David</HI> sings this Psalm in the warm feelings of the divine Presence, <HI>I'le fear no evil: thy crook and thy staffe they shall comfort me.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Here's the <HI>person,</HI> that walks <MILESTONE N="2"/> through this tremendous valley, <HI>ruddy, royal</HI> and <HI>holy David.</HI> Thy sanguin com∣plexion must now turn blanck and me∣lancholy, when <HI>Abishag's</HI> arms shall be cold and feeble comforters, and thy <HI>reall</HI> body must shrink into this grim <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 19.16.</NOTE> <HI>Mi∣chots</HI> bed. That conquering Sword at whose brandishing, <HI>Edam</HI> and <HI>Ammon</HI> trembled, must be shaped into deaths Sithe to mow <HI>thee</HI> from the Land of the Living. Thy holy heart must take San∣ctuary in the divine Covenant, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ps</HI> 49, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 89, 48.</NOTE> that God will one day redeem thy life from <HI>corruption,</HI> and thy darling from the <HI>hand</HI> of the grave.</P>
<P>Thirdly, We should muster up the <MILESTONE N="3"/> formidable <HI>evils</HI> that put on their armour, gird on their Swords, and whet their glittering Spears for a fatall encounter in this valley.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Valley of Death.</HEAD>
<P>DEath 'tis compar'd to a Valley, to a Valley of shadow, to a walk in a Valley, to a night walk in this shady Valley of <HI>Kidron.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Death is compared to a <HI>Valley,</HI> While men are alive their feet are set upon a Rock, on a high Mountain on the towring Pinnacle of a Temple, and Oh how hard it is for any to perswade themselves, that they shall once step down the precipice into this Valley. Every one thinks he may live <HI>to morrow,</HI> be he never so old: and the morrow of his thoughts can see <HI>no evening.</HI> But <HI>down</HI> he must and visit the dark land of his forefathe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s mansions.</P>

Death and the grave cover all.</P>
<P>Its a high pitch of Grace to be hum∣bled unto the death, to mingle the dust of our noble bodies with such off scour∣ings and sullage, to converse with the records of rottenness. But so 'tis with a Saint, he submits his will and yields up his spirit to God: To putrifie a while in the Valley of <HI>Himnon,</HI> that by Heavens Chymistry, he may spring up into a Tree of Life, in the Garden of <HI>Gethsemany.</HI> Wicked men fret and fume at death, and curse the Apple that poy∣soned nature, and some would seem to cheat death by a violent seicide, O fool, <HI>ne moriare mori:</HI> by a choosing a vio∣lent, to avoid a natural death▪ by cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ting off present terrors, to hasten eter∣nal.</P>
<P>But a Saint like a man in a dark Ca∣vern under a mineral Mountain, sees
<PB N="8" REF="000820_0016_0FAB42A52DC4DF88"/>
light at the other end by the Eye of Faith. He goes down into this V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lley leaning upon the Staffe of hope, of <HI>Christ in him</HI> the hope <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.</HI> 1.27</NOTE> of glory: he spies Mount <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ivet,</HI> and the foot-steps of Christs Ascention. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cor.</HI> 5.2</NOTE> He groans to be uncloathed of his <HI>filthy</HI> garments, expecting change of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aiment, and pla∣ces to walk among Angels <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Zach</HI> 3.7</NOTE> that stand by and wai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon the Prince of the Co∣venant.

<P>In time of some rowzing Sickness the <HI>Bell of Eternity</HI> tolls dolefully in their Ears: then they say, <HI>By and by Lord,</HI> weel come to worship, to repent and amend: but if a good <HI>Crisis</HI> lengthen the hopes of life; their gyant-promises sink into Dwarfs, and their <HI>By and by</HI> lengthens out its Tenor through many a morrow, till the last hour approaches, and then the day of invitation from di∣vine grace, turns into a day of provoca∣tion to the divine anger: he that swears in his <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb</HI> 6.17.</NOTE> <HI>love</HI> to the Heirs of promise for their strong <HI>consolation,</HI> will <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb.</HI> 3.11.</NOTE> sware in his <HI>wrath</HI> to the Children of disobedience that delay repentance, and harden their hearts at the voice of God, they shall ne∣ver enter in to his rest.</P>

away and man <HI>is not</HI>: a short lived va∣pour, that lives to be, but lives no longer, no sooner in being, but it flies away, and who can gather it: what's all time from the Suns first motion, till he turns to sackcloth; but a perishing cut out of the bosome of Eternity: scarce worth the name of a <HI>point</HI> or a <HI>moment</HI> to it. And, what then are the few and evil dayes of mans life upon earth, like a spark gives a <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ap</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rishes; but when he dyes, the shadows of a dark, of a long <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Jer.</HI> 6.4.</NOTE> evening are stretcht upon him.</P>
<P>How wholsome is it to meditate un∣der these shadows: By these things <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa.</HI> 33.16▪</NOTE> men <HI>live,</HI> and in all these is the life of our spirit: let's catch these vapours by the hand of contemplation, and distil some spiritual Cordials.</P>
<P>Is life so <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Job</HI> 7.7.</NOTE> vain a meteor? O vainer soul to build castles upon it: here's <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb.</HI> 11 10</NOTE> no City that hath <HI>foundations</HI>: thats in hea∣ven, men trade, and buy, and build, and plant, as if the <HI>Noah's</HI> second flood of fire and brimstone would never come. All former ages are wrapt up in the short breath of a history, and yet most men live, as if they thought their forefathers were by the Art of Magick stept aside in a mist, and the story of death but a Poets fable. But as <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Dion. Cass. l.</HI> 53. <HI>p.

Tragical Theam of some sickly over-stu∣died Minister, till <HI>thou</HI> become <HI>the Tragedy</HI> it self, and be invelop't in eternal dark∣ness: to which the shadow of death is but the shadow of misery.</P>
<P>What makes <HI>night</HI> but the shadow of the <HI>earth</HI>? and what's <HI>death</HI> but the sha∣dow of the <HI>grave</HI>? every night is the shadow of death, and every sleep in the bed is next of kin to that in the dust: and should raise up the holy seed of medi∣tation to his brother. While man lives, he walks in a shadow, and when he dies he lies down in it: A carnal man dies <HI>once,</HI> and rises to Judgment: but after that to a <HI>second</HI> death, and never rises more. A Saint indeed steps down into this first Valley, but walks through it to glory. The Vale of <HI>Kidron</HI> was also called the Valley of <HI>Tophet,</HI> and the Valley of <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gehenna.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Ge-hennon,</HI> the Valley of <HI>Hell.</HI> From the Valley of the <HI>grave</HI> wicked men sink into the bottom of <HI>Hell</HI>: But a Saint ascends from <HI>Kidron</HI> to <HI>Olivet.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, Death is a Saints <HI>walk</HI> in this shady Valley. <HI>King David,</HI> might, but <HI>Saint David</HI> would fear <HI>no</HI> evil; though he trod this dismal path. Christ is gone before <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Act.</HI> 2.29.</NOTE> the patriarch, and hath left be∣hind him the lustre of his footsteps to inlighten <HI>Davids</HI> feet in the <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 16 11.</NOTE> <HI>path</HI> to <HI>life,</HI> 'Twas not his royal Diadem could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>azle the eyes of Death, and fright him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om attaching his <HI>Ermine</HI> Robes, or guard

All passe through it, but a Saint walks through it to the Mountains of Spices.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Death is a <HI>night-walk</HI><MILESTONE N="4"/> through this shady Valley: a Saint is to <HI>pass,</HI> not to <HI>stay there</HI>: 'tis a night-walk, and there he must walk till the bright morning sorings▪ So many <HI>Suns</HI> must rowl over his body till the Resurrecti∣on. Then he that <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Dan.</HI> 12.2▪</NOTE> slept in the dust of the earth, shall awake to everlasting life. When his mouldring Clay being well digested in the Sepulchral <HI>Ʋrn,</HI> shall at∣tain maturity: it shall then shine forth a diaphanous, splendid and glorious bo∣dy. The sleep of the ancient <HI>Heroe-Saints</HI> for some thousands of years, shall seem but as the sleep of one night: Wicked mens souls may be terrified with dreams and visions of horror in that dis∣mal night; but a Saint sleeps quiet and sound, and with Christs dead body shall he arise: he tosses,<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa.</HI> 26.19.</NOTE> he tumbles <HI>not</HI> in this bed of Roses: 'tis but one fast sleep to a labouring and resting Saint; the worm

<P>Saints indeed are <HI>noctambulones,</HI> night walkers in this Valley; but 'tis not the fruit of undigested Suppers on the worlds D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inties, but as a happy plea∣sure in the bosome of Christ.

Nay Angels in shining gar∣ments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it at the head and feet of a Saints grave. When holy <HI>David</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ps.</HI> 8.3.</NOTE> <HI>considered</HI> Gods Heavens the work of his fingers, the Moon and the Stars which he had ordained: he <HI>considers</HI> Man too, that God should remember him▪ and the Son of Man that he should visit him, what's Man to a Star, to the Sun, to the Hea∣vens? yet a Saint's of more value to God then numerous Stars or the mani∣fold Orbes of Heaven. Was not <HI>David</HI> now on the Roof of his House by night gazing on that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pangled Canopy, and pondering on the greatness of the Stars, their motion, lustre and influence? May not a Saint thus meditate upon the night-watches of the grave and look up to the <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 15.5</NOTE> Stars as so many promises. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ps.</HI> 89 37.</NOTE> &amp; faithful witnesses in Heaven? When

he views the Zodiack, he traces the course of the Sun of righteousness: he looks upon the Milky Way, as the fu∣ture path of his glorified feet. He counts what if each Saint shall have a Star for his Kingdom; and yet, that all the Stars are but the paintings of the out-houses of that eternal Palace, wherein he shall dwell with God: When his Fa∣thers face shall visit him with the day∣spring from on high, and the bright morning Star shall glitter upon the Ea∣stern Mountains of the Resurrection, and proclaim the Suns arising to an eter∣nal Jubile.</P>

<P>I Will fear no evil, saies <HI>David:</HI> For thou art with me, thy crook and thy staff, they comfort me.</P>
<P>Here, are evils great and manifold in this Valley of Death: evils to be feared and trembled at, but not by a <HI>David.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anacepha∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osis.</HI></NOTE> A Saint will fear no evil: what <HI>David,</HI> no evil? not the evil of loss, nor the evil of sense, not the parting from many sweet enjoyments, not the curse of the Law, thundering from <HI>Si∣nai,</HI> and lightning from <HI>Ebal,</HI> not the conflicts of conscience, nor the darts of Satan, not the pangs of sickness, nor the pains of death, not the mouldring dust, nor unsavoury stench; not the hi∣deous darkness, nor the tedious night of the grave, as you may perceive by the foregoing Chapters. O valiant <HI>Da∣vid!</HI> when God stands by thee: what, do'st thou not stagger at the doctrine nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear the event of thy resurrection to Judgment, not the strictness of that awful Judge nor his doomful sentence: nor the long face or silver hairs of Eter∣nity?
<PB N="71" REF="000820_0079_0FAB43022F2B39D0"/>
No, no! <HI>David</HI> will fear no e∣vil, and here's his Cordiall. For <HI>thou</HI> art with me: thy crook and thy staff, they comfort me.</P>
<P>He fears no evil, because God is with him: He fears God, and therefore nought but God. I'le forewarn you whom ye shall fear, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Luk</HI> 12.5</NOTE> sayes our Lord, fear <HI>him,</HI> who after he hath kill'd, hath power to cast into Hell: yea, I say unto you, fear <HI>him.</HI> The filiall fear of God expells the tormenting fear of death and hell it self.

Let the King of Terrors muster his Forces and order his Troops in Battalia: The shadow of death to <HI>David</HI> is but the shadow of evil.

in the resurrection morning to enter the Courts of Glory.</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> saies not: <HI>I shall not</HI> dye, and therefore I will not fear: But <HI>though</HI> I dye, I will not fear, for thou art with me.

<P>Thou art with me: For thou art <HI>mine.</HI> A God in Covenant guides to death, and receives to glory.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Experimental feelings of the Divine presence, choice Comforts to a Saint at Death.</HEAD>
<P>THou <HI>hast</HI> made known unto me the waves of life: and what fol∣lowes? Thou <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 2.28.</NOTE> <HI>shalt</HI> make me full of joy from thy countenance. God's face darts <HI>one</HI> beam of light on the path of a Saint, to shine upon his way to glory: <HI>another</HI> beam (and that's of joy) upon the heart of a Saint, to oyl his motion. And all but <HI>beams</HI>: yet warming beams and experienc'd beams to hasten him to the Sun it self. A Saint ha's now but <HI>beams</HI> of joy, and blessed be God for <HI>beams,</HI> and such beams as direct and attract to the Sun it self, to that Sun of joy, to the fulness of joy in his coun∣tenance: Saints look unto him and their <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psa.</HI> 34.5.</NOTE> <HI>faces</HI> are enlightned, our looking to God makes us look like him and the
<PB N="79" REF="000820_0087_0FAB430876816A38"/>
nearer to him, the more we are like him; Gods countenance is of a changing and transforming nature: When God lookt upon <HI>Moses</HI> but through a chinck: how did his face shine, how lovely was it, as well as glorious? God smiles on a Saint in love, and a Saint reflects upon God with joy.</P>
<P>But Saints have not only good looks from God, but free entertainment. He maketh me to lye down in green pastures, he leadeth me beside the still waters, he restoreth my soul, he leadeth me in paths of righteousness for his Names sake: Oh! how the cool Etesian gales from the rivers of the spirit in ordinances revive and refresh a Saint: The expe∣rience of present mercies dispells the fears of future evils: I <HI>will</HI> fear no evil for thou art with me: God never for∣sakes a soul in covenant, never with∣draws his real (though sometimes his visible) communion. I foresaw the Lord <HI>always</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Act.</HI> 2.25, 27</NOTE> before my face: therefore my heart rejoices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> because thou wilt not leave my soul in the grave. By nature God's not with us: but when once the day spring from on high doth visit us, grace never sets in an evening, whether we sleep or wake we are still with God.</P>
<P>Here's the point, to know aright; that God is with us: and we with him. Whether we have walkt with God and he with us. If <HI>Enoch</HI> walk with God,
<PB N="80" REF="000820_0088_0FAB430A57440A18"/>
then God will take him: He that walks with God, pleases God: <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 5.24</NOTE> The Septuagint render the Hebrew word for <HI>walking,</HI> by <HI>pleasing</HI> God, and the Spirit of God delights in the word [<HI>EƲ∣ERESTEIN</HI>] and uses the same <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb.</HI> 11.5.</NOTE> when treating of <HI>Enoch</HI> in the New-Testament, to shew what pleasure God takes in them, that walk with him.</P>
<P>If we walk with God, we have fel∣lowship and communion with him. God <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.6, 7.</NOTE> is light, and if we walk in light we walk with him: Light is holiness: and a holy person walks in light and dwells in God: let's not spot our gar∣ments, and we shall walk with him in white <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 3.4.</NOTE> The fine linnen of holiness a∣las, what Saint doth keep it clean: we must wash it daily in the Laver of the Spirit, or else no company for a holy God: The best of our linnen is but cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and yellow: its well if it be sin∣cere and true: but then it shall shine with rayes of glorious light, and be la∣ced and beautified with admirable gifts: The Queen <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal</HI> 45.14</NOTE> shall be brought unto him in raiment of needle-work at the wed∣ding day. Now 'tis soiled with many a drop and many a foul spot: but then as pure as God would have it. Now, the more's the pitty, 'tis patcht and ragged: many a Saint is out at heels in his holi∣ness, he walks disorderly and uncomely. But then we shall have new Coats, fine

linnen clean and white, <HI>Rev.</HI> 19.8. and change of Raiment from our older bro∣ther. <HI>Benjamin</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 45.22</NOTE> shall be fine indeed, when he sits at the Table of the Ruler of <HI>Canaan</HI>: 'Tis holiness fits us for Table communion in heaven: 'tis porch communion in grace that brings us near it: hast thou never walkt with God in the porch? thou shalt never sit down at the <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Luk</HI> 22.30</NOTE> Table of Christ and drink the new wine of the King∣dom.</P>
<P>Again; As God walks in the light of holiness: he walks also in the holy <MILESTONE N="2"/> Place of his Temple, God delights in his Ordinances, in his pure worship: We walk with God when our hearts are in communion with him in Ordi∣nances. His paths are in the Sanctuary, there's his <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lam.</HI> 2 1.</NOTE>footstool and there his go∣ings: He <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 2.1.</NOTE> walks among the golden Candlesticks: In the Temple all talk of his glory, while he sits at the Table of grace, and the <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Song</HI> 1.11.</NOTE> Spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof; T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re he hath <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ps.</HI> 133.3.</NOTE> commanded the blessing and life for evermore.</P>
<P>Walking in Scripture when applyed to God in communion with Saints, is exprest three several ways: Before God, with God, and after God.</P>
<P>To walk <HI>before</HI> God (among others) one special sense is, (that we are now upon) to walk in pure and holy wor∣ship.
<PB N="82" REF="000820_0090_0FAB430B2D511AD0"/>
Coming up to the Temple is cal∣led a coming up <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>King</HI> 14 9</NOTE> before God, our ap∣pearing, <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psa.</HI> 56.13.</NOTE> sitting, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2.30, 35.</NOTE> walking and abi∣ding <HI>before</HI> him. <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ps.</HI> 100 2. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> And <HI>Jeroboam</HI> is branded on the account of false worship, that he cast God behind his back. As God commands his people, they shall have no other Gods <HI>before</HI> him; So be forbids any other worship then he hath instituted, to serve himself with: For he is <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Exod.</HI> 20.5.</NOTE> a jealous God: his eyes do see quickly <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><HI>Exod.</HI> 32.8</NOTE> and his jealousie will <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><HI>Deut.</HI> 29.18, 20</NOTE>
smoak fiercely against such a man, and all the curses in the Book shall lye upon him, and the Lord will blot his name from under heaven. Bold and sawcy is that silly worm that presumes to chalk out a worship for the living God.</P>
<P>To walk <HI>with</HI> God, is to walk in <HI>his</HI> wayes, in his statutes and command∣ments to do them: to eye his directi∣ons, to feel and turn about with every guide of his hand. We must <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 119.</NOTE> choose his precepts for our way, and we shall have him for company: and is the way so holy, and our God so holy? then blessed is the man that's holy and unde∣filed <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ps</HI> 119.1.</NOTE> in such a way, and in such hea∣venly company: The <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Hos.</HI> 14.9.</NOTE> wayes of the Lord are <HI>right:</HI> the <HI>just</HI> shall walk in them; but transgressors shall fall therein.

<P>To walk <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Deut</HI> 13 4.</NOTE> <HI>after</HI> God, is to choose God for our Captain and Leader: to make him our example, president and conduct.

It behooves all therefore, that dare appeal to God, to examine and try their hearts with im∣partial strictness, before they turn a∣bout their faces to heaven. <HI>David</HI> spends the largest part of an excellent <HI>Psalm</HI> in choice ruminations upon the divine attributes and the works of God, on his former experiences and deep meditations upon the all-searching eye of God, before he dares to make an essay of a reverent <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ps.</HI> 139 2</NOTE> appeal unto him.
