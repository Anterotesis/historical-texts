<HEAD>Memoria <HI>WILSONIANA.</HI> THE LIFE OF Mr. JOHN WILSON.</HEAD>
<P N="1"><HI>S.</HI> 1. SUCH is the Natural <HI>Tendency,</HI> in Humane Minds to <HI>Poetry,</HI> That, as tis Observed, the <HI>Roman Historian,</HI> in the very first Line of his <HI>History,</HI> fell upon a Verse, 
<Q><L>Urbem Romam, In Principio Reges habuere;</L></Q></P>
<P>So, the <HI>Roman Orator,</HI> though a very <HI>Mean Poet,</HI> yet making an <HI>Oration</HI> for a <HI>Good One,</HI> could not let his First Sentence pass him, without a per∣fect <HI>Hexameter,</HI> 
<Q><L>In Qua me non Inficior mediocriter Esse.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="000725_0004_0FAA44FAE0E1FFD0"/>If, therefore, I were not of all men the most <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>poetical,</HI> my Reader might now Expect an Entertainment altogether in <HI>Verse</HI>; for I am go∣ing to Write the <HI>Life</HI> of that <HI>New-English</HI> Divine; who had so nimble a Faculty of putting his De∣vout thoughts into <HI>Verse,</HI> that he Signalized him∣self by the Greatest <HI>Frequency,</HI> perhaps, that ever Man used, of sending <HI>Poems,</HI> to All Persons, in All Places, on All Occasions; and upon this, as well as upon Greater Accounts, was a <HI>David</HI> un∣to the <HI>Flocks</HI> of our Lord in the <HI>Wilderness:</HI>
<Q><L>Quicquid tentabat Dicere, Versus erat;</L></Q></P>
<P>Wherein, if the <HI>Curious</HI> Relished the <HI>Piety</HI> some∣times rather than the <HI>Poetry,</HI> the Capacity of the <HI>Most,</HI> therein to be accommodated, must be Con∣sidered. But I intend no further Account of this matter, than what is given by his Worthy Son, (Reprinting at <HI>Boston</HI> in the year, 1680 the <HI>Verses</HI> of his Father, upon the Famous Deliverances of the English Nation, Printed at <HI>London,</HI> as long a∣go, as the year 1626) Whose Words are, <HI>What Volumns hath he Penned, for the help of Others, in their several Changes of Condition? How was his Heart full of Good Matter? And his Verses past, like to the Handkerchiefs carried from</HI> Paul, <HI>to up∣hold the Disconsolate, &amp; Heal their Wounded Souls</HI>? For indeed this is the <HI>Least Thing,</HI> that we have to Relate of that <HI>Great Saint</HI>; and accordingly,

<P N="2"><HI>S.</HI> 2. Mr. <HI>Iohn Wilson,</HI> descending from Eminent Ancestors, was Born at <HI>Winsor</HI> in the <HI>Wonderful Year</HI> 1588. The Third Son of Dr. <HI>William Wilson,</HI> a Prebend of St. <HI>Pauls,</HI> of <HI>Roch∣ester</HI> and of <HI>Winsor,</HI> and Rector of <HI>Cliff</HI>: having for his Mother, a Neece of Dr. <HI>Edmund Grindal,</HI> the most Worthily Renowned Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> His exact Education under his Pa∣rents, which betimes <HI>Tinged</HI> him with an Aver∣sation to Vice, and above all, to the very shadow of a <HI>Lye,</HI> fitted him to Undergoe the further Education, which he received in <HI>Eaton-Colledge,</HI> under <HI>Udal</HI> (and <HI>Langely</HI>) whom now we may Venture, after Poor <HI>Tom Tusser,</HI> to call, <HI>The Seve∣rest of Men.</HI> Here he was most Remarkably Twice Delivered from Drowning; but at his Book, he made such Proficiency, that while he was the <HI>Least Boy</HI> in the School, he was made a <HI>Propositor</HI>; and when the Duke of <HI>Biron</HI> Em∣bassador from the French King Henry IV, to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Visited the School, he made a Latin Oration, for which the Duke bestowed Three <HI>Angels</HI> upon him. After four years Con∣tinuance at <HI>Eaton,</HI> he was Removed unto <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI> between the Fourteenth and Fifteenth year of his Age; and Admitted into <HI>Kings Colledge</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="000725_0006_0FAA44FC94D1BA28"/>
in the year 1602. When he came to stand for a <HI>Fellowship</HI> in that <HI>Colledge,</HI> his Antipathy to some Horrid Wickednesses, whereto a Detestable Wretch that had been Acquainted with him, would have betray'd him, caused that Malicious Wretch by Devised and Accursed <HI>Slanders</HI> to ruin so far the Reputation of this Chast Youth with the other <HI>Fellows,</HI> that had not the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, who was a Serious and a Reverend Person, in∣terposed for him, he had utterly lost his Privi∣ledge; which now by the <HI>Major Vote</HI> he Ob∣tained. But this Affliction put him upon many <HI>Thoughts</HI> and <HI>Prayers</HI> before the Lord.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>S.</HI> 3. He had hitherto been, according to his Good Education, very <HI>Civilly</HI> and <HI>Soberly</HI> Dis∣posed: but being by the Good Hand of God, Led unto the Ministry of such Holy men as Mr. <HI>Bains,</HI> Dr. <HI>Taylor,</HI> Dr. <HI>Chaderton,</HI> he was by their Sermons Enlightned and Awakened, unto more Sollicitous Enquiries after, <HI>The One Thing yet Lack∣ing in him.</HI> The Serious Dispositions of his Mind, were now such, that besides his pursuance after the <HI>Works</HI> of <HI>Repentance</HI> in himself, he took no little pains to pursue it in others; especially the <HI>Malefactors</HI> in the Prisons, which he Visited with a Devout, Sedulous, and Successful Industry. Nevertheless, being forestalled with Prejudices against the <HI>Puritans</HI> of those Times, as if they had held, he knew not well what <HI>Odd Things,</HI> he
<PB N="5" REF="000725_0007_0FAA44FE933F8168"/>
Declined <HI>Their</HI> Acquaintance; although his Good Conversarion had made him to be accounted <HI>One</HI> of them, <HI>Himself.</HI> Until going unto a <HI>Book∣sellers</HI> Shop to Augment his Well-furnisht <HI>Library,</HI> he Lit upon that Famous Book of Mr. <HI>Richard Rogers,</HI> called, <HI>The Seven Treatises</HI>▪ which, when he had Read, he so Affected, not only the <HI>Mat∣ter,</HI> but also the <HI>Author</HI> of the Book, that he took a Journey unto <HI>Wethersfield,</HI> on purpose to hear a Sermon, from that <HI>Boanerges.</HI> When he had heard the Heavenly Passages that fell from the Lips of that Worthy Man, <HI>Privately,</HI> as well as <HI>Publickly,</HI> and compared therewithal the Writings of <HI>Greenham,</HI> of <HI>Dod,</HI> and of <HI>Dent,</HI> especially <HI>The Path way to Heaven,</HI> Written by the Author last mentioned, he saw that <HI>They</HI> who were Nicknamed, <HI>Puritans,</HI> were like to be the <HI>Desirablest Companions,</HI> for One that intended his own Everlasting Hap∣piness; and pursuant unto the Advice, which he had from Dr. <HI>Ames,</HI> he associated himself with a Pious Company in the University, who kept their Meetings in Mr. <HI>Wilsons</HI> Chamber, for <HI>Prayer, Fasting,</HI> Holy <HI>Conference,</HI> and the Exercises of true Devotion.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>S.</HI> 4. But now, perceiving many Good men to Scruple many of the <HI>Rites,</HI> Practised and Im∣posed in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> he furnished himself with all the <HI>Books,</HI> that he could find Written on the Case of <HI>Conformity,</HI> both <HI>Pro</HI> and
<PB N="6" REF="000725_0008_0FAA44FF94F51108"/>
<HI>Con,</HI> and pondered with a most Conscientious Deliberation, the Arguments on both sides pro∣duced. He was hereby so convinced of the E∣vil in <HI>Conformity,</HI> that at Length, for his Obser∣veable Omission, of certain Uninstituted <HI>Ceremo∣nies</HI> in the Worship of God, the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> then Visiting the University, pronounced upon him the Sentence of <HI>Quindenum,</HI> that is, That, be∣sides other Mortifications, he must within <HI>Fifteen Dayes,</HI> have been <HI>Expelled,</HI> if he continued in his Offence. His Father, being hereof Advised, with all Paternal Affection, Wrote unto him to <HI>Con∣form</HI>; and at the same Time, interceded with the Bishop, that he might have a Quarter of a year allowed him; in which time, if he could not be Reduced, he should then leave his <HI>Fellow∣ship</HI> in the Colledge. Hereupon he sent him un∣to several <HI>Doctors</HI> of Great Fame, to get his Ob∣jections Resolved; but when much <HI>Discourse,</HI> and much <HI>Writing,</HI> had passed between them, he was rather the more confirmed in his Principles a∣bout <HI>Church Reformation.</HI> Wherefore his Father, then diverting him from the Designs of the <HI>Mi∣nistry,</HI> disposed him to <HI>the Inns of Court</HI>; where he fell into Acquaintance with some Young Gen∣tlemen, who associated with him in constant Exercises of Devotion; to which Meetings the Repeated Sermons of Dr. <HI>Gouge</HI> were a continual Entertainment: and here it was, that he came into the Advantageous Knowledge of the Learn∣ed

When he had continued Three years at the <HI>Inns of Court,</HI> his Father discerning his Dis∣position to be a <HI>Minister</HI> of the Gospel, permitted his Proceeding <HI>Master of Arts,</HI> in the University of <HI>Cambridge</HI>; but Advised him to Address ano∣ther <HI>Colledge,</HI> than that, where he had formerly met with Difficulties. Dr. <HI>Cary,</HI> who was then Vice Chancellour, understanding his former Cir∣cumstances, would not Admit him without <HI>Sub∣scription:</HI> but he refused to <HI>Subscribe.</HI> In this Dis∣tress he Repaired unto his Father, at whose House there happened then to be present, the Countess of <HI>Bedfords</HI> Chief Gentleman, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had Business with the Earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> the <HI>Chancellour</HI> of the University. And this Noble Person upon the Information, which that Gentleman gave him of the matter, presently Wrote a Letter to the Vice Chancellour on the Behalf of our Young <HI>Wilson</HI>; whereupon he received his <HI>Degree,</HI> and continued a while after this, in <HI>Emanuel-Colledge:</HI> from whence he made frequent and useful Visits unto his Friends, in the Counties adjoining, and became further fitted for his Intended Service. But while he was passing under these Changes, he took up a <HI>Resolution,</HI> which he thus expressed before the Lord; <HI>That if the Lord would Grant him a Liberty of Conscience, with Purity of Worship,
<PB N="8" REF="000725_0010_0FAA4500F03FAF40"/>
he would be content, yea, thankful, though it were at the furthermost End of the World.</HI> A most Pro∣phetical <HI>Resolution</HI>!</P>
<P N="6"><HI>S.</HI> 6. At Length, Preaching his first Ser∣mon at <HI>New Port; he set his Hand unto that Plough from whence be never afterwards Looked Back</HI>: not very long after which, his Father lying on his Death Bed, he kneeled, in his Turn, before him, for his <HI>Blessing,</HI> and brought with him for a share in that <HI>Blessing,</HI> the Virtuous Young Gen∣tlewoman, the Daughter of the Lady <HI>Mansfield</HI> (Widow of Sir <HI>John Mansfield</HI> Master of the <HI>Minorys</HI> and the Queens Surveyor) whom he Designed afterwards to Marry: Whereupon the Old Gentleman said, <HI>Ah,</HI> John, <HI>I have taken much Care about thee, such time as thou wast in the Uni∣versity, because thou wouldest not Conform; I would fain have brought thee to some higher Preferment, then thou hast yet attained unto: I see thy Conscience as very Scrupulous, concerning some things that have been Observed and Imposed in the Church: Never∣theless, I have Rejoyced to see the Grace and Fear of God, in thy Heart; and seeing thou hast kept a Good C<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nscience hitherto, and walked according to thy Light, So Do still; and Go by he Rules of Gods Holy Word: The Lord Bless thee, and her, whom thou hast chosen to be the Companion of thy Life!</HI> Among other Places, where he now Preached, <HI>Moreclake</HI> was One; where his <HI>Non-Conformity</HI> exposed him to
<PB N="9" REF="000725_0011_0FAA4501B49FFC20"/>
the Rage of <HI>Persecution</HI>; but by the <HI>Friendship</HI> of the Justice, namely Sir <HI>William Bird,</HI> a Kinsman of his Wife, and by a <HI>Mistake</HI> of the Informers, the Rage of that Storm was moderated.</P>
<P N="7"><HI>S.</HI> 7. After this, he Lived as a Chaplain Successively in Honourable and Religious Fami∣lies; and, at last, was Invited unto the House of the most Pious Lady <HI>Scudamore.</HI> Here Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> observing the Discourse of the Gentry at the Table, on the <HI>Lords-Day,</HI> to be too Disagree∣able unto the Devout Frame to be mentained on such a Day, at Length he Zealously stood up at the Table, with Words to this purpose, <HI>I will make bold to Speak a Word or Two; This is the Lords Holy Day, and we have been hearing His Word, and after the Word Preached, every One should think, and speak about such Things, as have been Delivered in the Name of God; and not Lavish cut the Time in Discourses about Hawks &amp; Hounds.</HI> Whereupon, a Gentleman then present, made this Handsome and Civil Answer, <HI>Sir, Wee Deserve all of us to be thus Reproved by you; This is, indeed, the Sabbath-Day, &amp; we should, surely, have better Discourse; I hope, it will be a Warning to us.</HI> Notwithstand∣ing this, the next Lords-Day, the Gentry at the Table were at their <HI>Old Notes</HI>; which caused Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> again to tell them, <HI>That the Hawks which they Talkt of, were the Birds, that Picked up the seed of the Word; after the Sowing of it</HI>; and
<PB N="10" REF="000725_0012_0FAA45027464E338"/>
Pray'd them, <HI>That their Talk might be of such Things, as might Sanctify the Day, and Edify their own Souls</HI>; which caused the former Gentleman to Renew his former Thankfulness for the Ad∣monition. But Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> the Ladys Husband, was very angry; whereof when the Lady ad∣vised Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> wishing him to say something, that might Satisfy him, he Replyed, <HI>Good Madam, I know not wherein I have given any just Offence; and therefore, I know of no Satisfaction that I owe: Your Ladyship has Invited me to Preach the Good Word of God among you; and so I have endeavoured according to my Ability: Now such Discourse as this, on the Lords Day, is Profane &amp; Disorderly: If your Husband Like we not, I will be gone.</HI> When the Lady informed her Husband how Peremptory Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> was, in this matter, he mended his Countenance and Carriage; and the Effect of this Reproof was, that unsuitable Discourse, on the <HI>Lords Day,</HI> was cured among them.</P>
<P N="8"><HI>S.</HI> 8. Removing from this Family, after he had been, a while at <HI>Henly,</HI> he continued for three years together, Preaching at Four Places, by Turns, which lay near one another, on the Edges of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> namely <HI>Bumsted, Stoke, Clare,</HI> and <HI>Candish.</HI> Here, some of <HI>Sudbury</HI> happening to hear him, they Invited him to Succeed the Emi∣nent Old Mr. <HI>Jenkins,</HI> with which Invitation, he cheerfully complied, and the more cheerfully be∣cause
<PB N="11" REF="000725_0013_0FAA450362D64238"/>
of his Opportunity to be near Old Mr. <HI>Richard Rogers,</HI> from whom afterwards when Dying, he Received a <HI>Blessing</HI> among his Children; yea, to encourage his Acceptance of this Place, the very <HI>Reader</HI> of the Parish did <HI>Subscribe,</HI> with many Scores of others, their Desires of it; and yet he accepted not the <HI>Pastoral Charge</HI> of the Place, without a Solemn Day of <HI>Prayer</HI> with <HI>Fasting,</HI> (wherein the Neighbouring Ministers assisted) at his Election: Great notice was now taken of the <HI>Success,</HI> which God gave unto his Labours, in this Famous Town; among other Instances whereof, One was this. <HI>A Tradesman</HI> much given to <HI>Stealing,</HI> as well as other Profane and Vicious Practices, One Day seeing People flock to Mr. <HI>Wilsons</HI> Lecture, thought with himself, <HI>Why should I Tarry at Home to Work, when so many Go to Hear a Sermon</HI>? Wherefore, for the sake of <HI>Company,</HI> he went unto the Lecture too; but when he came, he found a Sermon, as it were, particularly Directed unto himself, on Eph. 4.28. <HI>Let him that hath Stole, Steal no more</HI>; and such was the Im∣pression thereof upon his Heart, that, from this Time, he became a Changed and Pious man.</P>
<P N="9"><HI>S.</HI> 9. But if, <HI>they that will Live Godlily must Suffer Persecution,</HI> a Peculiar share of it must fall upon them, who are Zealous and Useful Instru∣ments to make others <HI>Live so.</HI> Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> had a share of this Persecution; and one <HI>A—n,</HI> was a
<PB N="12" REF="000725_0014_0FAA4503EAC134A8"/>
Principal Author of it. This <HI>A—n</HI> had former∣ly been an Apprentice in <HI>London,</HI> Where the Bishops deteined him some years, under an hard Imprisonment, because he Refused the Oath <HI>ex Officio,</HI> which was pressed upon him to tell, <HI>Whe∣ther he had never heard his Master Pray against the Bishop</HI>? The Charity of Well Disposed People now Supported him, till he got abroad, Recom∣mended by his Hard Sufferings, unto the Good Affections of the <HI>Puritans,</HI> at whose Meetings he became so Conversant, and thereupon such a for∣ward and zealous Professor, that, at Length he Took upon him, under the Confidence of some <HI>Latinity,</HI> whereof he was Owner, to be a Sort of a <HI>Preacher</HI> among them. This man would Re∣verence Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> as his <HI>Father,</HI> and yet upon the Provocation of seeing Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> more highly Valued and Honoured, than himself, he not only became a <HI>Conformist</HI> himself, but also, as <HI>Apostates</HI> use to be, a Malignant and Violent <HI>Persecutor</HI> of those, from whom he had <HI>Apostatized.</HI> By his means, Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> was put unto Trouble in the <HI>Bishops Courts</HI>; from whence his Deliverance was, at Length Obtained by certain <HI>Powerful Mediators.</HI> And once by <HI>his</HI> Tricks the most noted Pursevant of those Times, was employed for the Siezing of Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI>; but though he Siezed upon many Scores of the People coming from the Lecture, he Dismissed the rest, because he could not meet with Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> himself, who by a Special Provi∣dence,
<PB N="13" REF="000725_0015_0FAA4504A4090578"/>
went out of his direct way, to Visit a Worthy Neighbour, and so escaped this <HI>Mighty Hunter.</HI> Afterwards an Eminent Lady, happen∣ing Innocently to make some Comparison be∣tween the Preaching of Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> and one Dr. <HI>B.</HI> of <HI>B.</HI> the Angry Doctor presently applied him∣self unto the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> who for a while <HI>Suspended</HI> him. And when that Storm was over; he with several other Worthy Ministers, came to he wholly Silenced, in another, that was Raised upon Complaints made by one Mr. <HI>Bird,</HI> unto the Bishop of <HI>Norwich</HI> against them. Concern∣ing this <HI>Ill Bird,</HI> there happened one passage hereupon, which had in it something Extraordi∣nary. Falling very Sick, he had the help of a Famous and Skilful Physician, One Dr. <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Colchester</HI>; who having left his Patient, in his Opinion, safely Recovered, gave Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> a Visit with an Account of it. <HI>Recovered!</HI> Says Mr. <HI>Wilson; You are mistaken Mr. Doctor, He's a Dead man!</HI> The Doctor answered, <HI>If ever I re∣covered a Sick man in my Life, that man is Recover∣ed:</HI> but Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> replied, <HI>No, Mr. Doctor, He's a Dead man, he shall not Live; Mark my Words!</HI> The Doctor smiled; but for all that, before they parted, the News was brought them, that the man was <HI>Dead</HI> indeed, and, <HI>The Lord known by the Judgment, which He Executed.</HI> But at last, Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> obtained from the truly Noble Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> to Sign a Letter, which the Earl bid
<PB N="14" REF="000725_0016_0FAA45055EB2B808"/>
himself to draw up, unto the Bishop, on his be∣half; by the Operation of which Letter, his Li∣berty, for the Exercise of his Ministry, was again procured. This Bishop was the Well-known Dr. <HI>Harsnet,</HI> who a Little while after this, Travelling <HI>Northward,</HI> upon Designs of mischief against the Reforming Pastors and Christians there, certain Ministers of the <HI>South</HI> set apart a Day, for Solemn <HI>Fasting</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> to Implore the Help of Hea∣ven, against those Designs; and on that very Day, he was taken with a Sore and an odd Fit, which caused him to stop at a Blind House of Entertain∣ment on the Road, where he suddenly Dyed.</P>

At Last, <HI>being Persecuted in One Coun∣try, he must Flee into another.</HI> The Plantation of a <HI>New-English</HI> Colony was begun; And Mr. <HI>Wil∣son,</HI> with some of his Neighbours, Embarked themselves in the Fleet, which came over thither in the year 1630. Where he applied himself with all the Vigour Imaginable, to Encourage the poor People, under the Difficulties of their <HI>New Plan∣tation.</HI> This Good People buried near Two Hundred of their Number, within a Quarter of a year after their first Landing; which caused Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> particularly to Endeavour their Con∣solation; by Preaching on <HI>Jacobs</HI> not being dis∣heartned by the Death of his nearest Friends in the way, when God had called him to Remove. And how <HI>Remarkably,</HI> perhaps I might say, <HI>Ex∣cessively,</HI>

Liberal he was in Employing his Estate for the Relief of the <HI>Needy,</HI> Every such One so beheld him, as to Reckon him, <HI>The Father of them all</HI>: Yea, the poor <HI>Indians</HI> themselves also tasted of his <HI>Bounty.</HI> If it were Celebrated, as the Glo∣ry of <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> that he would Sell his <HI>Goods</HI> to convert them into <HI>Alms</HI> for the poor, yea, that, <HI>Quadam Die proprium Atramentarium Argenteolum, ut ditaret Inopes, inter pignorat obligavit,</HI> our Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> though a greater Disclaimer of <HI>Merit,</HI> than <HI>Bellarmine</HI> was, not only in his Writings, but on his Death-bed it self, yet came not behind <HI>Bellar∣mine</HI> for the Extension of his <HI>Charity.</HI> To give <HI>Instances</HI> of his, even over doing <HI>Liberality,</HI> would be to do it <HI>Injuries</HI>; for indeed they were In∣numerable; He acted as if the Primitive Agree∣ment of having <HI>All Things in Common,</HI> had been of all things the most Agreeable unto him.

himself a Liberty, to <HI>Preach</HI> more after the <HI>Pri∣mitive</HI> Manner; without any Distinct <HI>Propositi∣ons,</HI> but Chiefly in <HI>Exhortations</HI> and <HI>Admonitions,</HI> and Good wholesome <HI>Councils,</HI> tending to Excite Good Motions, in the Minds of his Hearers; (but upon the same Texts that were Doctrinally hand∣led by his Colleague instantly before:) and yet sometimes his Pastoral Discourses had such a <HI>Spirit</HI> in them, that Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI> would say, <HI>Me∣thinks I hear an Apostle, when I hear this Man!</HI> Yea, even One of his <HI>Ex Tempore</HI> Sermons, has been since his Death, counted worthy to be Pub∣lished unto the World.

all made up of <HI>Love.</HI> He was full of <HI>Affection,</HI> and ready to help and; Relieve, and Comfort the <HI>Distressed</HI>; His <HI>House</HI> was Renowned for <HI>Hospita∣lity,</HI> and his <HI>Purse</HI> was continually emptying it self into the hands of the <HI>Needy</HI>: From which Disposition of <HI>Love</HI> in him, there once happened this Passage; When he was Beholding a Great Muster of Souldiers, a Gentleman, then present, said unto him, <HI>Sir, I'l tell you a Great Thing; here's a mighty body, of People, and there is not</HI> SEVEN <HI>of them all, but what Loves</HI> Mr. Wilson; but that Gracious man presently and pleasantly replyed, <HI>Sir, I'l tell you as Good a Thing as that, here's a mighty Body of People, and there is not so much as</HI> ONE <HI>of them all, but</HI> Mr. Wilson <HI>Loves him.</HI> Thus he did, by his own Exemple, notably Preach that Lenon, which a Gentleman found in the <HI>Anagram</HI> of his Name, <HI>Wish no One Ill</HI>: And thus did he Continue, to, <HI>Do Every One Good</HI> until his Death gave the same Gentleman Oc∣casion thus to Elegize upon him: <Q><L>Now may Celestial Spirits Sing yet Higher,</L>

Diligence Visited the Congregations of the Neighbouring Towns, at their <HI>Weekly Lectures,</HI> until the Weaknesses of <HI>Old Age</HI> rendered him Uncapable. And it was a delightful Thing, then to see upon every Recurring Opportunity a large Company of Christians, and even <HI>Magistrates</HI> and <HI>Ministers</HI> among them, and Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> in the Head of them, Visiting the <HI>Lectures</HI> in all the Vi∣cinage, with such Heavenly Discourses on the Road, as caused the Hearts of the Disciples, to <HI>Burn within them</HI>: and indeed it was Remark'd, That though the Christians <HI>Then</HI> Spent Less Time, in the <HI>Shop,</HI> or <HI>Field,</HI> than they do <HI>Now,</HI> yet they did in <HI>Both</HI> prosper more. But for Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> I am saying, That a <HI>Lecture</HI> was a <HI>Treasure</HI> unto him; he Priz'd it, he Sought it, until <HI>Old Age</HI> at Length brought with it <HI>a Sickness,</HI> which a Long while confined him. In this Illness, he took a Solemn Farewel of the <HI>Ministers,</HI> who had their Weekly Meetings, at his <HI>Hospitable House,</HI> and were now come together from all parts, at the Anniversary <HI>Election</HI> for the Government of the Colony. They asked him, to declare Solemn∣ly, what he thought might be the <HI>Sins,</HI> which provoked the Displeasure of God against the Country. Whereto his Answer was, <HI>I have long feared several Sins</HI>; Whereof, One, he said, was <HI>Corahism</HI>; <Q>That is, when People rise up as <HI>Corah</HI> against their <HI>Ministers,</HI> as if they took too much upon them, when indeed they do but

Rule for Christ, and according to Christ; yet it is nothing for a Brother to stand up and Oppose, without Scripture, or Reason, the Word of an Elder, saying [<HI>I am not Satisfied!</HI>] And hence, if he do not like the Administra∣tion (be it <HI>Baptism</HI> or the Like) he will turn his back upon God and His Ordinances, and Go away. And for our Neglect of <HI>Baptising</HI> the Children of the <HI>Church,</HI> those that some call <HI>Grand-children,</HI> I think God is provoked by it. Another Sin (<HI>said he</HI>) I take, to be the making Light of, and not Subjecting to the Authority of <HI>Synods,</HI> without which the Churches cannot long Subsist.</Q></P>

The Evening before he Dyed, his Daughter asking him, Sir, <HI>How do you Do</HI>? he held up his Hand, and said, <HI>Vanishing Things!

A Prime Ringleader in that Business, was One <HI>Venner</HI> a Cooper of <HI>Sa∣lem,</HI> the Mad Blade, that afterwards perished in a Nonsensical Uproar, which he, with a Crue of <HI>Bedlamites,</HI> possessed like himself, made in <HI>London.</HI> This <HI>Venner,</HI> with some others, now stood up, and said, <HI>That notwithstanding, what had been Offer∣ed, they were clear in their Call to Remove:</HI> Where∣upon, Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> stood up and answered, <HI>Ay, Do

you c<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me to Ask Counsel in so weighty a matter as this, and to have Help from an Ordinance of God in it? and are you aforehand Resolved, that you will Go on? Well, you may Go, if you will; but you shall not prosper. What? Do you make a Mock of Gods Ordinance</HI>? And it came to pass accordingly; The Enterprize was, not long after, dashed in pieces; and <HI>Venners</HI> precipitating <HI>Impulses,</HI> after∣wards carried him to a miserable End.</P>
<P>A <HI>Council</HI> sitting at a Town, where some <HI>Eccle∣siastical Differences</HI> called for the Assistances of the Neighbours to Compose them, there was one man, observed by Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> to be extreamly perverse, and most Unreasonably Troublesome, and Mischievous, to the Peace of the Church there; Whereupon Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> told the <HI>Council,</HI> he was confident, <HI>That the Jealousy if God would set a Mark upon that Man, and that the Ordinary Death of men should not befall him.</HI> It happened shortly after, that the man was barbarously Butchered by the <HI>Salvages!</HI></P>
<P>While Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> was Minister of <HI>Sudbury</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> there was a Noted Person, who had been absent, for some while among the Papists. This man Returning Home, Offered himself to the <HI>Communion</HI>; whereat Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> in the open Assembly Spoke unto him after this manner; <Q>Brother, you, here, present your self, as if you would partake in the Holy Supper of the Lord. You cannot be Ignorant of what you
<PB N="33" REF="000725_0035_0FAA4516A8474780"/>
have done in withdrawing your self from our Communion, and how you have been much conversant, for a Considerable while, with the Papists, whose Religion is Antichristian. There∣fore, though we cannot so absolutely Charge you, God knows, who is the Searcher of All Hearts; and if you have Defiled your self with their Worship and Way, and not Repent∣ed of it, by offering to partake, at this Time, in the Holy Supper with us, you will Eat, and Drink your own Damnation; but if you are clear, and have nothing wherewith to charge your self; you your self know; upon this Account you may Receive.</Q>
The man did then partake at the <HI>Lords Table,</HI> professing his Innocency. But as if the <HI>Devil had entered into him,</HI> he soon went and <HI>Hanged</HI> himself.</P>
<P>In the Circumstances of his own Children, he saw many Effects of an <HI>Extraordinary Faith.</HI></P>
<P>His Eldest Son, <HI>Edmund,</HI> while Travelling into the Countries, which the Bloody Popish Inquisiti∣on, has made a Clime too <HI>Torrid</HI> for a <HI>Protestant,</HI> was Extreamly Exposed: but the Prayers of the Young Gentlemans continually Distressed Father, for him, were answered, with Signal Preservati∣ons. When he was under Examination by the Inquisitors, a Friend of the Chief among them, suddenly arrived; and the Inquisitor not having <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een this Friend for many years before, was
<PB N="34" REF="000725_0036_0FAA4517B8F730E0"/>
hereby so diverted and mollified, that he car∣ried the Young Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> to Dinner with him; and, though he had passed hitherto <HI>Unknown</HI> by his True Name, yet this Inquisitor could now call him, to his great Surpize, by the Name, of Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> and report unto him the Character of his <HI>Father,</HI> and his <HI>Fathers</HI> Industry in Serv∣ing the Hereticks of <HI>New-England.</HI> But, that which I here most of all design, is an Account of a thing yet more Memorable and Unaccounta∣ble. For, at another Time, his Father Dream't himself Transported into <HI>Italy,</HI> where he saw a Beautiful Person in the Sons Chamber, Endea∣vouring, with a thousand <HI>Enchantments</HI> to debauch him; whereupon the <HI>Old</HI> Gentleman made, and was by his Bed-fellow overheard making, first, <HI>Prayers</HI> to God full of Agony, and then <HI>Warnings</HI> unto his Tempted Son, to Beware of Defiling himself with the <HI>Daughter of a Strange God.</HI> Now, some Considerable while after this, the <HI>Young</HI> Gentleman Writes to his Father, that on such a Night, (which was upon Enquiry found the very <HI>same Night,</HI>) a Gentlewoman had caressed him, thus and so (just according to the <HI>Vision,</HI>) and that his <HI>Chastity</HI> had been Conquered, if he had not been Strongly Possessed with a Sense of his Fathers <HI>Prayers</HI> over him, and <HI>Warnings</HI> unto him, for his Escape from the Pits, whereinto do fall the <HI>Abhorred of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>His other Son, <HI>John,</HI> When a Child, fell upon
<PB N="35" REF="000725_0037_0FAA45186C8A7B28"/>
his Head from a Loft, Four Stories high, into the Street; from whence he was taken up for Dead, and so battered and bruised and bloody with his Fall, that it struck Horror into the Be∣holders: but Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> had a Wonderful Re∣turn of his Prayers, in the Recovery of the Child, both unto <HI>Life,</HI> and unto <HI>Sense</HI>; inso∣much, that he continued unto <HI>Old Age,</HI> a Faith∣ful, Painful, Useful Minister of the Gospel; and but lately went from the Service of the Church in <HI>Medfield,</HI> unto the Glory of the Church <HI>Tri∣umphant.</HI></P>
<P>After Mr. <HI>Wilsons</HI> arrival at <HI>New-England,</HI> his Wife, who had Left off bearing of Children for many years, brought him another <HI>Daughter</HI>; which <HI>Lamb,</HI> was indeed unto him, <HI>as a Daughter</HI>; and he would present her unto other Ministers, for their Blessing, with Great Affection, Saying, <HI>This is my</HI> New-England <HI>Token</HI>! But this Child, fell Sick of a <HI>Malignant Feaver,</HI> wherein She was gone so far, that every one despaired of her Life; Except her Father, who called in several Ministers, with other Christians, unto a <HI>Fast,</HI> on that Occasion; and hearing the Prayers of Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> for he, found his Heart so Raised, that he Confidently declared, <HI>While I heard,</HI> Mr. Cot∣ton <HI>at Prayer, I was Confident the Child should Live!</HI> And the Child accordingly <HI>did</HI> Live; yea, She is to this Day alive, a very <HI>Holy Woman, Adorned, like them of Old Time, with a Spirit of Great Price!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="000725_0038_0FAA46EE8AE84C20"/>The <HI>Blessings</HI> Pronounced by Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> upon many Persons and Affayrs, were observed so <HI>Prophetical,</HI> and especially his Death-bed Blessings upon his Children and Grand-children were <HI>so,</HI> that the most Considerable Persons in the Coun∣trey, thought it not much, to come from far, and bring their Children with them, for the En∣joyment of his <HI>Patriarchal Benedictions.</HI> For which cause, Mr. <HI>Thomas Shepard,</HI> in an <HI>Elegy</HI> upon him, at his Death, Pathetically thus Ex∣pressed it; <Q><L>Whoso of <HI>Abraham, Moses, Samuel,</HI> Reads,</L>
<L>Or of <HI>Elijah's</HI> or <HI>Elisha's</HI> Deeds,</L>
<L>Would surely say, Their <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> was his,</L> <L>And think there were a <HI>Metempsychosis.</HI></L>
<L>As Aged <HI>John,</HI> th' Apostle us'd to <HI>Bless</HI></L>
<L>The People, which they Judg'd their Happiness,</L>
<L>So did we count it worth our <HI>Pilgrimage</HI></L>
<L>Unto him for his <HI>Blessing,</HI> in his Age.</L></Q></P>
<P>These were <HI>Extraordinary Passages</HI>; Many of them, are Things, which <HI>Ordinary Christians</HI> may more safely <HI>Ponder,</HI> and <HI>Wonder,</HI> than <HI>Expect,</HI> in <HI>Our</HI> Dayes!

<P N="20"><HI>S.</HI> 20. There is a certain Little <HI>Sport of Wit,</HI> in <HI>Anagrammatizing</HI> the <HI>Names</HI> of Men; which was used as long ago at Least as the Dayes of Old <HI>Lycophron</HI>: and which sometimes has afforded Reflections very <HI>Monitory,</HI> as <HI>Alstedius</HI> by his just Admirers changed into <HI>Sedulitas,</HI> or very <HI>Satyrical,</HI> as when, <HI>Satan Ruleth me,</HI> was found in the Transposed Name of a certain Active Persecutor: and when, <HI>Lo, a Damned Crew,</HI> was found in the Name of One that made a Fi∣gure, among the Popish Plotters against the Na∣tion.

But it, is to the <HI>Last Place</HI> in our History of <HI>this</HI> Worthy Man, that I reserve that part of his Character, which lay in his Dispo∣sition to allot unto <HI>Himself</HI> the <HI>Last Place</HI> among <HI>all</HI> Worthy Men; for his <HI>Low</HI> Opinion of him∣self, was the <HI>Top</HI> of all his other Excellencies. His <HI>Humility</HI> not only caused him, to prefer the Meanest of his <HI>Brethren,</HI> above himself, but also to Comply with the meanest Opportunities of being Serviceable: Hence t'was, that when his Voice in his Age did so fail him, that his Great Congregation could be no longer Edified by his <HI>Publick Labours,</HI> he Cheerfully and Painfully set himself to do all the Good, that he could by his <HI>Private Visits</HI>; and such also, as he could not reach with <HI>Sermons,</HI> he often <HI>found</HI> with <HI>Verses</HI>: Hence t'was, that when that plea was used with the Church of <HI>Ipswich</HI> to resign Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> unto the Church of <HI>Boston,</HI> after the Death of Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI>; Because it was said, <HI>Let him that hath two Coats give to him that hath None</HI>; and a Person of Quality replied, <HI>Boston hath One,</HI> [mean∣ing Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI>:] this Good man answered; <HI>Who? Me! I am Nothing!</HI> Yea, Hence t'was, that when Malefactors had been openly Scourged upon the Just <HI>Sentence</HI> of Authority, he would presently send for them to his House, and having first expressed his Bounty to them, he would then bestow upon them such gracious Admoni∣tions
<PB N="41" REF="000725_0043_0FAA46F46AB0E8C8"/>
and Exhortations, as made them to become, instead of <HI>Desperate,</HI> remarkably <HI>Penitent.</HI> Indeed, I know not whether his <HI>Humility,</HI> might not have some <HI>Excess,</HI> in some Instances charged up∣on it; at least Once, when he had Promised unto a Neighbouring Minister, to Preach a Sermon for him, and after his Promise came in Season to that Minister, saying, <HI>Sir, I told you, that I would Preach for you, but it was rashly done of me; I have on my knees begg'd the Pardon of it, from the Lord; That I should offer thus to deprive His People, of your Labours, which are so much better than any of mine can be: Wherefore, Sir, I now come Seasona∣bly to tell you, that I shall fail you!</HI> And accor∣dingly, there was no perswading of him to the contrary.</P>
<P>But from the like <HI>Humility</HI> it was, That a Good kinsman, of his, who deserves to Live in the same <HI>Story,</HI> as he now Lives in the same <HI>Hea∣ven</HI> with him, namely Mr. <HI>Edward Rawson,</HI> the Honoured Secretary of the <HI>Massachuset</HI>-Colony, could not by all his Intreaties perswade him, to let his <HI>Picture</HI> be drawn; but still refusing it, he would reply, <HI>What! Such a Poor, Vile Creature as I am! shall my Picture be drawn? I say, No; it never shall!</HI> And when that Gentleman in∣troduced the Limner, with all things ready, Vehemently importuning him to gratify so far the Desires of his Friends, as to sit a while, for the taking of his <HI>Effigies,</HI> no Importunity
<PB N="42" REF="000725_0044_0FAA46F52F3B9D20"/>
could ever obtain it from him. However, being bound in <HI>Justice</HI> to Employ <HI>my Hand,</HI> for the Memory of that Person, by <HI>whose Hand</HI> I was my self Baptised, I have made an Essay, to draw his <HI>Picture,</HI> by this Account of his <HI>Life</HI>; wherein if I have missed of doing to the <HI>Life,</HI> it might be made up, with several Expressive Passages, which I find in <HI>Elegies</HI> Written and Printed upon his <HI>Death</HI>: Whereof there were many Composed, by those, whose Opinion was well Signified by one of them: <Q><L>Sure <HI>Verseless</HI> he does Mean, to's Grave to Go,</L>
