<P><HI>CErdo Gloucestriensis,</HI> an Author of the last Century, of great Sagacity, observ<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d well, That <HI>Runto Poli∣munto Plumpismenoi Raperpandico</HI>— What d'ye stare at? This is good <HI>Greek</HI> for ought you know, and contains a Mystery, which shall continue so, unless you Reveal it; and so no more of that. The following <HI>Elionophysalo Fizlical Farce</HI> having fallen into my Hands by a most sur∣prizing Accident, it seemeth meet unto me that it should, with all due Reverence Kiss yours. Here it lies at your Feet, take it up. Now read the first Act,—Have ye done? What's the matter Man? Have ye got the Gripes? A Plague on your Sower Faces. Bring him a Dram. What have have you to do, had you to do, or ought you to have to do with the <HI>Senate?</HI> You smell a Rat, you say. Be it so. But compose your self, and now Read the second Act,—How d'ye like it, ha? <HI>O Hooo, T'churrrrrrrrrtch,</HI> I can say that as Loud as you can do; and if you'll but leave out these Damnable <HI>R</HI>'s and <HI>T</HI>'s which make it so hard in Pronounciation, and harder in Digestion, I like it better than you do. You don't believe me! and I don't believe in you; and this is a perilous Article in a Mans Belief too; For one who dy'd a very good <HI>Christian,</HI> was sentenc'd by your
<PB REF="001681_0004_0FB4DC9E838F5C98"/>
Sanctity to be bury'd a <HI>Pagan,</HI> only because he seem'd to believe that you were some-what Thick of believing; yet you are a Christian, a very good Christian,</P>
<L>So was your Leader, Major <HI>Weere,</HI></L>
<L>Burnt for Bu—ry, God be here.</L>
<P>He had a good Gift of the Gob too: You were bred up in the same Accademy, the same Principles, and the same way of Worship: All the Difference between you lies in this nice point, He Worship't the Dev'l in∣stead of God, and you worship God as if he were the Dev'l. Come to't again, first take two Turns cross the Room, Cross-ways, I say, Wipe the Sweat from your Brows, and sit down. Now read the Third Act, I'll sing the while,</P>
<L>It is an Old Maxim, et c'est Escrit,</L>
<L>Au trou de mon cul, look there you'll sie't,</L>
<L>When the Head is Be—ck't the Body's Beshit,</L>
<L>Which no Body dare Deny, Deny,</L>
<L>Which no Body dare Deny.</L>
<P>Read on, and be hang'd, don't mind me, Man, I sing for my own Diversion.</P>
<L>But 'tis strange how Notions are chang'd of late,</L>
<L>For 'tis a New Maxim, but odd one, That</L>
<L>Ce que pend a nos culs doit nous garnir latete,</L>
<L>That I flatly and boldly Deny, Deny,</L>
<L>That I flatly and boldy Deny.</L>
<P>What is the Matter now? Is he Dead? or is't a Qualm? Holo, a Hay! Who waits there? some burn't Feathers, <HI>Sal Armoniack?</HI> No, No, Let him smell to the Skirt of his own Garment. So, he Recovers Poor <HI>Fiz!</HI> who could have thought that you were so quick of Smelling! Come, Man, take Courage; What have You or I to do with it? Let the Gall'd Horse wince,

our Withers are unwrung. But tell me, will you be quiet for the Future? You shall be paid for't, nay, you have been paid for't; and it is hard that Men must be Brib'd for Not doing what they ought Not to do. I re∣member an Odd Fellow upon <HI>Pont Neuf</HI> who got his Livelihood by as Odd a Stratagem; He procur'd him∣self a Portable Forge and Bellows, which he carried under his Cloak, and having heated a small Iron red hot, he would lug it out and present it to the Gentlemen who pass'd that way, with this Complement, <HI>Good Sir! Pray Sir! give me leave to run my hot Iron into your Arse.</HI> When the Gentleman started at the Extravagance and Danger of the Motion, he continued, <HI>Nay, Sir, if you don't like it, pay me but a Sol Marquee for the heating of my Iron, and there is no harm d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne.</HI> Now had he insisted upon the Perform∣ance of the Operation aforesaid, after payment for the necessary Apparatus, he deserv'd to have his Bones broke; but he was most commonly satisfied, and all the Conse∣quence was a fit of Laughter. Now, I know that it is not an easie matter for you to get rid of your Forge and Bellows, but can't you blow your Bellows and heat your Iron at home, and quit that unaccountable Rage of Run∣ing it into your honest quiet Neighbours Arses, who pay you amply, and meerly for Forbearance? But I have done. Peace be with ye, I mean such a one as he made who made you a COM-</P>

<P>Gentlemen, The ill Measures that have been taken, and the Foundation that hath been laid within this Tenement, to make the Tenants thereof, Tenants therein, is the Cause which causeth me to make this Speech. Our Grievances being innumerable, I shall Enumerate them. The first I shall mention, is this, That tho' the Tenement be large, the Mansions many, and the Inhabitants Numerous, There is but One Kitchin, and one Cellar, by which means we are kept from Eating and drinking What we please, When we please, and as Much as we please, which is our Birth-Right Priviledge by the Laws of God and Nature, settled upon us by Act of Parliament; for which cause I humbly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. Wheter it may not be
<PB N="3" REF="001681_0009_0FB4DCAD4F570080" MS="y"/>
more Convenient that each Mansion have its proper Kitchin and Cellar under the special Direction of the respective Tenants?</P>
<P>To clear up the Necessity of this Method, I'll tell you what happ'ned to me t'other day; One of the Servants of this House, who brought me a Mess of Water Gruel, being my special Friend, and knowing how eagerly my Stomach stood towards what was forbidden me by the Phy∣sitians, conveys a Hand of Pork into the Porrige, but being discover'd he was punisht, tho' he offer'd to take his Corporal Oath, That the Hand of Pork was a bunch of Radishes. But of all others, we of the East End of the Tenement suffer most, for by reason of our distance from the Kitchin, our Porrige is cold before it comes to our Hands. To Remedy this, we fell upon a private Intercourse with the <HI>Bethlemites</HI> on the other side of <HI>Moor-fields,</HI> who by virtue of their Charter run at large, by which we broke the Laws pretty Comfortably for a season; but these same subtle Fellows of the Kitchin found it out, and put a stop to't, to the Great Prejudice of the Freedom of the Subject, and the direct Discouragement of our indirect Commerce. I Remember we once Address'd our Superiors, That we might have a Servant of our own, independent of this Plaguey <HI>Keeper</HI>; They were Graciously pleas'd to allow us such a one, with this Restriction only, That the Ser∣vant aforesaid might have the Custody of our Straw and Water, but by no means of our Meat and Drink; notwithstanding this, the Keeper will not permit him to take the care and Custody of our Victuals and Drink. What! does▪ he think us <HI>Non Corpus Mentlus,</HI> that we do not know the meaning of plain words! But <HI>I</HI> shall Conclude at this time, with this Exhortation, That since it appears plainly, that we of this Tenement, who are Tenants thereof, are in danger of Being, by the Foundations laid, made Tenants therein, let us not lie Crying thereat, but be Valiant Therefore, and Vindicate our Rights There-from, Our Birth-Right Parliamentary Rights, settled upon us by the Ten Com∣mandments.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Coxcomb</HI> humbly proposes, That no Body be allow'd to speak but himself, because for want of the Attentive Faculty, he is like to have no share in the Hearing, and so ought to have Compensation in Speaking.</P>
<P><HI>Doodlesack</HI> has given his in a Forreign Tongue, which when inter∣preted stands thus, That He having but a small share of Elocution, but a very lively and strong imagination, may have leave, as occasion shall Offer, to Express his Thoughts by Staring, Grinning and Grima∣cing, of which he has so Exquisite a Talent, that those who cannot be said to understand any thing else, perfectly understand him in that Method of Utterance.</P>

<P>Mr. Speaker, being Resolv'd to enter my Dissent to these several Resolves, I shall first give my Reasons for so doing. I believe it is needless to put you in mind of our Origine, from whence we sprang, and how we came hither. It is well known that we were of that Number of Publick Spirited Persons, distinguish't from our Neigh∣bours by an inward Light or Faculty, call it what you Please. The <HI>Romans</HI> call it <HI>Aestrum,</HI> the <HI>French, Verve,</HI> our Northern Nation has indeed given it a Courser Name, which gave us a strong Disposition toward Reformations, Remonstrations, Resolutions, and other Acts of Zeal; in the eager pursuit of which we were apt to throw our selves, sometimes our Neighbours, into the Fire or Water. The Wisdom of the Times thought fit to Erect this Tenement for our Intertainment, where the Exercize of the Faculty aforesaid might be less Dangerous or hurtful to our selves, or others. Here we are Maintain'd at their Charge with Food and Rayment suitable to our Condition, and the Fabrick kept in Repair at the no small Annual Expences of our Land-Lords. And what Returns do we make? Have not many of us from our private Cells thrown our Filth and Ordure in their Faces? And now in a Collective Body we are about to throw more filthy Resolves at them.</P>

<P>Two other special Friends of yours, <HI>viz.

<L>The <HI>Bees</HI> so fam'd for Feats of War,</L>

<L>'Till time and late Experience,</L>
<L>The only Schoolmaster of Fools,</L>

<L>In that wild state they were Assail'd</L>

<L>Not that their Hearts or Hands had fail'd,</L>

<L>Chose for the Greatness of his Noise.</L>

<LG>
<L>Thus ill they sped in every Battle;</L>
<L>For tho' the Chief was in Request</L>

<L>Abroad he was the Common Jest.</L>
<L>The <HI>Wasps</HI> in all Ingagements, held —</L>

<L>Grown Wiser by repeated Woes,</L>

<P>YOu see what our wise Resolves have brought upon us, we shall never do his buss'ness in this way, Muzled as we are; I wish my Advice had been follow'd.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fizle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what was that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Babilard.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was for proceeding in the way of secret Representations and Remonstrances against him, which My Lord <HI>Oinobaros,</HI> his declar'd Enemy, might have long e'er this improv'd to his Ruin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fizle.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was my own Method, but that which discourages me is, that at Parting my Lord assur'd me, That he would return in six Moneths, and Confirm me in my <HI>Patriarchat</HI>; instead of that, he has himself taken up with the Wardenship of a Spunging-house.</P>

<P>No, that Method will never do.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fizle.</SPEAKER>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Then I have another Device for you.

and that it has Increas'd in proportion to the Keepers good Nature. Had he been oftner Check'd, he had been less Troublesome to himself and us. Let us not provoke our Keeper; for my part, I think he is a good one.</P>

<P>What! is he not an Enemy to the Consistory?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, he is an Enemy to their Folly, and can well distinguish between the Function and the Person who abuses it. Pray give me leave to divert you, 'till <HI>Fizle</HI> returns, with another Tale; It is harm∣less, and I hope will give no Offence.</P>
<L>In the beginning God made Men,</L>
<L>And all was well, but in the End</L>
<L>Men made their Gods, and Fondly pay'd 'em.</L>
<L>The Worship due to him that made 'em,</L>
<L>And all was wrong; for they Increas'd,</L>

<L>So much as <HI>Phoebus,</HI> God of sense</L>
<L>And Non-sense, Patron, as occasion</L>
<L>Did serve, of Arts and Inspiration.</L>
<L>Once on a day as he was led</L>
<L>About to give a Cast of's Trade,</L>
<L>Whether to Dance, or Sing, or Fiddle,</L>
<L>Or as some say, to read a Riddle,</L>
<L>I know not; but what-e'er it was,</L>
<L>His Veh<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cle was but an Ass,</L>
<L>And he none of the wisest neither;</L>
<L>For when the Crowd had got together</L>
<L>To pay due Homage to their God,</L>
<L>Strowing with Flow'rs the Path he rode,</L>
<L>And singing P<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ans, the vain Beast</L>
<L>Believ'd all this, to him Address't:</L>
<L>He Pranc'd, and Flung, and Frisk'd about,</L>
<L>Scatt'ring much Dirt among the Rout,</L>
<L>And bray'd as if h' had got a Pack</L>
<L>Of Dev'ls, and not a God on's back.</L>
<L>The Crowd essay'd by gentle ways,</L>
<L>To Curb his Pride, and smooth Pace;</L>
<L>But all was talking to the Wind;</L>
<L>For Zeal is deaf, when-e'er 'tis blind.</L>
<L>Finding all other Methods fail,</L>
<L>They seiz'd him by the Ears and Tail,</L>
<L>And took the Idol from his back,</L>
<L>With many a lusty Bang and Thwack.</L>
<L>They let him know, that <HI>Phoebus</HI> was</L>

If the Old Conjurer can but unsear Lips, as he calls it, or uncork his own Ears, as I take it, I might perhaps prevail with him to Conjure me a little better Conversation than his own. It is Tormenting, that I must be oblig'd to him: but there is no Re∣medy; I'll Wheadle him with a Story of the other World, of which I know as little as he does; That may work upon him.</P>
