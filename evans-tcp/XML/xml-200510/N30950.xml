<P>THE two following Odes were compos'd on their respective Oc∣casions, merely for the Author's Amusement and the Entertain∣ment of his Friends; but their Importunity and favourable, not to say partial, Judgment of them, have induc'd him to present them to publick View, not without some Hope, that they may meet with a kind Reception, if not by their intrinsick Merit, at least by their Re∣lation to those important and interesting Events which gave them Birth.</P>
<P>As the Life of Lord <HI>HOWE</HI> was unspeakably valuable, so his Death is, and it were astonishing if it were not, most sincerely and universally lamented: And indeed I know not, whether the sad Ca∣tastrophe which succeeded his Fall, tho' attended with the Loss of so many Lives, has occasion'd more Regret, than the single Fate of that illustrious and promsing young Hero. But the Reduction of <HI>Louis∣bourg</HI> to his <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty must needs give inexpressible Pleasure, and afford a most delightful Prospect, to every one, in proportion as he apprehends its Importance to, and prizes the Welfare of, the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Colonies in <HI>America,</HI></P>
<P>In this View of Things, and a critical Humour apart, the Au∣thor hopes these Performances with all their Faults (which he is ig∣norant of) may afford a pleasing Entertainment to his Fellow Subjects, even at this Distance of Time; and if so, he wou'd have been glad if his Distance from the Press, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had not prevent∣ed their being somewhat more seasonable.</P>
<P>If the Character of Lord <HI>HOWE</HI> be, as doubtless it is, incompleat it must be consider'd that this Sketch of it was copied from the Voice of Fame; and if any Gentlemen of the Army or Navy seem to be neg∣lected, or not mention'd according to their Rank, in the Ode on the Reduction of <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> I hope it will be imputed rather to the Ignorance than the Partiality, of</P>
