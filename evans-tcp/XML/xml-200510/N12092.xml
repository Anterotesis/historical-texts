<P>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE laudable <HI>Institution,</HI> made by the worthy Inhabitants of this ancient TOWN, for celebrating the wonder-working pro∣vidence of GOD in favour of its <HI>first settlers</HI> when few in number and weak in strength, demands our serious attention, and the approbation of all who say in their hearts <HI>let the Lord be magnified.</HI></P>
<P>Many were the afflictions, and as many the favourable interpositions of Providence, expe∣rienced by our <HI>Ancestors</HI> from the time of their first essays to quit their native land, till they ar∣rived and settled in this. A proper recollection of these things, hath a happy tendency to impress our minds with a becoming Sense of GOD and the goodness of Providence to his suffering people.</P>
<P>To stir up our minds by way of remembrance, a great many things have been well said upon the occasion by my worthy Brethren who have gone before me.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="015256_0005_0F988329BA222420"/>The most noted <HI>historical facts,</HI> relative to the coming over of our fore-fathers▪ have been named in the first public Sermon on this occasion, from <HI>Psalm</HI> lxxviii.5, 6, 7. Also their smallness in num∣bers, strength and wealth, and the duty of not despising the day of small things, in another Ser∣mon, from <HI>Zech.</HI> iv.10. The general nature of that freedom, civil and religious, to which we have all an equal right—the embarrassments that tyranny and oppression throw in the way of the exercise of such freedom, and the duty of a peo∣ple to re-assume it, if possible, when it is wrested from them, in another, from <HI>Gen.</HI> i.31, and <HI>Ps.</HI> cxix.134. And lastly, a representation of the heroic faith of Abraham exemplified, in some measure, by our pious fore-fathers, in a fourth Sermon, from <HI>Heb.</HI> xi.8. These things have been set before you already; and <HI>what shall we say more?</HI></P>
<P>Time would fail us, to give you a full narrative of the vicissitudes that they and theirs passed thro'—the suffering they underwent—the chris∣tian courage, patience, faith and fortitude they maintained, and their final success, growth and increase, notwithstanding the trials and persecu∣tions that befell them during the despotic reigns of the four <HI>Kings</HI> of the <HI>Stuart House.</HI></P>
<P>Methinks it may be said of these first emigrants and their successors, as was said of the Israelites in the text, <HI>the more they</HI> (their adversaries) <HI>af∣flicted them, the more they</HI> (the sufferers) <HI>multi∣plied and grew</HI>—grew in the christian graces and virtues; and at length, in numbers, wealth and strength, so that finally (the oppressive measures
<PB N="7" REF="015256_0006_0F98832A7ACC0080"/>
taken against them notwithstanding) they rose from small beginnings to become a numerous and flourishing people.</P>
<P>It is a truth worthy our notice, and let it be the general observation from the text, that, <HI>When</HI> GOD <HI>designs the growth and increase of a people, even the afflictions they meet with shall be over-ruled to promote the same.</HI> So it hath been, and so it will be; and nothing under heaven shall be able to prevent it.</P>
<P>If the Lord is determined that a people shall grow and multiply, either in the natural, civil, or religious way; no tribulation, or persecution, or any kind of affliction from their adversaries shall disappoint him of his purpose. <HI>Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numbers xxiii.231.</NOTE></P>
<P>We are sensible that <HI>affliction</HI> is a general term that signifieth trouble, distress and adversity, aris∣ing either from cruel oppression and persecution, or from wise correction and just punishment; for tho' there is a wide difference between oppression, and proper correction, as the one is always wrong, and the other always right, yet they are both afflictive to the party oppressed, or corrected.</P>
<P>The natural <HI>tendency</HI> of affliction, is, to waste, diminish and destroy the afflicted; and this will be the issue, in case the affliction rises and conti∣nues, unless the providence of GOD prevents it. This might easily be demonstrated by a course of plain reasoning; but this method to prove the de∣structive
<PB N="8" REF="015256_0007_0F98832B3A09C9C0"/>
tendency of affliction is needless, because we have striking instances of the fact in the conti∣nual decrease of the abused <HI>Africans</HI> in the West-India Islands. Their afflictions and bondage are so many and great, that instead of multiplying and growing, it is quite the reverse, they diminish and perish so fast under the cruel hand of oppression, that the proprietors or planters are obliged to send for new recruits of many thousands every few years to keep their numbers good and their lucrative business going on. The inhumanity, cruelty and wickedness of the practice is a great deal blacker than the miserable creatures themselves.</P>
<P>But however true it is, that affliction is ruinous in its natural tendency, yet thro' the merciful in∣terposition of GOD it takes a <HI>new direction,</HI> and, in regard to its effects, it becomes good and salu∣tary both to individuals and communities. Under the influence of GOD, the fruit of affliction is the taking away of sin, the reformation of manners, and the enlargement and salvation of a people. This may be called the <HI>providential tendency</HI> of affliction, and this is the way that good is brought out of evil.</P>
<P>Whenever we are afflicted, either by the hand of GOD or man, it is generally supposed that we have offended and merit the rod. This is always true when the Almighty afflicts us, and, with the strictest propriety, we may adopt the confession of Nehemiah, <HI>thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly.</HI> But this is not always true when we are afflicted by the hands of men; i. e. we do not always deserve it of them. They sometimes,
<PB N="9" REF="015256_0008_0F98832BFA1F5D30" MS="y"/>
either through ignorance or ill will, make an un∣just judgment, and a wrong application; and hence they punish the innocent, or cause the guilty to be punished beyond the demerit of his offence. In both cases (unavoidable ignorance excepted) they are chargeable with injustice and oppression.</P>
<P>We know that <HI>ignorance,</HI> be it moral or politi∣cal, is not the proper subject of penalty; and that he who offends only in one degree is not the pro∣per subject of ten, or of two degrees of punish∣ment. Hence, they who knowingly minister a stripe where none is due, or two stripes where but one is due (be they Parents, Masters or Magistrates that do it, either against an individual or against a community) they act the part of oppressors and tyrants, and may justly expect to hear from the Almighty that severe reprimand, <HI>what mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah iii.15.</NOTE></P>
<P>When a <HI>Child,</HI> that is grown to the state of manhood and self-government, and is set at liberty by the laws of GOD and man, to regulate and take care of himself, hath, by his industry, pro∣vided for his own subsistence, how base and wicked is it for his <HI>Parents</HI> to seize the fruit of his labor—to demand the surrender of his person and property to their arbitrary disposal, and make his refusal such a capital offence as to pursue him with vengeance? A proceeding similar to this, either in a family or civil state, is nothing short of high-handed oppression and cruelty; and for parents or magistrates to plead any human law
<PB N="10" REF="015256_0009_0F98832CBADA3538"/>
whatsoever in vindication of such practice, does no more exculpate them than it did the mur∣derous witnesses against our Saviour to plead and say, <HI>we have a law, and by our law he ought to die.</HI>*</P>
<P>Any law or institution contrary to the law of GOD, or against the good of the people, is a law that establisheth iniquity: and the execution of it produceth an affliction so painful and grievous that it cannot and ought not to be borne without resistance, or making some essay for deliverance, agreeably to the principle of self-defence.</P>
<P>We further add,</P>
<P>Afflictions of any kind that are pungent, do lay the afflicted under necessity of struggling, in order to extricate themselves. If it be a profli∣gate sinner, whose conscience is afflicted with a sense of his sin, guilt, and danger of the wrath to come, his enquiry will be, <HI>what shall I do to be saved?</HI> If a christian or a christian church be afflicted with a sense of apostacy and of the divine correction, their concern and exertion will be to repent, reform, and be restored to the peace and love of GOD. If it be a civil community, afflicted with public oppression—with a sense of the loss, or the danger of losing their natural or stipulated rights, it presently moves them to seek, devise and and prosecute ways and means of freedom and safety; a kind of necessity is laid upon them so to do. In this case the old pro∣verb is verified, <HI>Necessity is the mother of inven∣tion</HI>; she is a fruitful mother, and the necessitous
<PB N="11" REF="015256_0010_0F98832D7A1E43F0"/>
and afflicted find themselves press'd and constrain∣ed to exert their wisdom, genius, and all their inventive powers for their salvation.</P>
<P>Now, when the providence of GOD directs and assists the awakened genius of such an afflicted people, they are often led to search out and make discovery of those means and ways of defence and relief, which otherwise they neither would have attempted, or even thought of; however, the issue of these efforts hath often been the deli∣verance and enlargement of a people. And this is what we observe, that, the same afflictions and oppressions which naturally tend to ruin, lay waste and destroy a body of people, are nevertheless, under GOD's directing influence, the means and occasion of their rising to a free and flourishing state.</P>
<P>Civil communities, as well as christians, and christian churches, have experienced the truth of what is here asserted, and to confirm the same, appeals may be made to sacred and prophane history, from both of which the point will be lilucidated.</P>
<P>The growth and increase of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> un∣der the afflictions, slavery and bondage of <HI>Egypt,</HI> is to the purpose. Their adversaries (deaf to the demand of GOD, <HI>let my people go that they may serve me;</HI> and deaf to the cries and petitions of the afflicted) racked their invention to find out ways and means to waste, dishearten and destroy them. To this end spake the Egyptian Monarch to his noble Lords, saying, <HI>come on, let us deal wisely
<PB N="12" REF="015256_0011_0F98832E3A178560"/>
with them, lest they multiply—and sight against us, and get them up out of the land.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exodus i.10.</NOTE> This wise con∣sultation issued in many severe projects, such as, appointing over them task-masters—making them serve with rigour—drawing the chains of their bondage tighter—taking away their straw, yet demanding the full tale of brick, and beating them in case of default; nor was this all, two edicts of death were made out and sent to the midwives to put in execution, one was, to kill the male children with their own hands as soon as they were born, the other, to cast them into the river; this was a blow at the root. However, the Midwives <HI>feared GOD</HI>—disobeyed the king, and saved the children alive: nor was this diso∣bedience censured of GOD as rebellion, but their conduct was so highly approved of him, that it is said, <HI>he made them houses.</HI> i. e. gave them flou∣rishing families. It may also be observed, that as the time of their exodus drew nearer, the weight and anguish of their afflictions increased, so that <HI>their lives were made bitter with hard bondage.</HI> But the providence of GOD being favourable to∣ward them, they multiplied and grew (notwith∣standing the oppressions and miseries they were under, during the latter part of their residence in Egypt) so that in about 220 years, there sprang, from 70 souls, the vast number of 600,000 fight∣ing men, which, according to common calculation, supposeth the whole number of souls that left Egypt, not less than three millions.</P>
<P>Common history, as well as sacred, supplies us with instances▪ showing that the grievous oppres∣sions
<PB N="13" REF="015256_0012_0F98832EFA1A7B30"/>
of a people are over-ruled, by the kind pro∣vidence of GOD, to bring on and promote their freedom and enlargement. A few instances may suffice to set this matter in a clear light.</P>
<P>The early and severe oppressions, the violent struggles, and the final liberty of the <HI>Swiss</HI> may <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> adduced in proof of the point. For many centuries together they were oppressed and dis∣tressed by some or other of their imperious neigh∣bours, or their own lordly nobility, till at length, tired and worn out with the gauling yoke of slavery and oppression, three Cantons only, out of the thirteen that composed those States, began to make resistance, and stand for their rights.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was in the year 1315.</NOTE> They having fought some great battles <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Particularly one with the Austrians, who came against them with 20,000 men, and Leopold Arch-Duke of Austria <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> with re∣markable success, the other Cantons began to fall in, till at length the whole thirteen were combined together in the same cause; and after a mighty struggle of about 20 years continuance, they ob∣tained rest and safety in the peaceable enjoyment of their liberties and properties, multiplying and growing in numbers and allies; and have lived in quiet for the space of four centuries past.</P>
<P>The history of the persecutions, cruel oppressions, bloody wars and the mighty efforts of the <HI>seven Dutch Provinces</HI> against their oppressors (led on by the Duke <HI>de Alva, Don John</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> under <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Spain</HI>) which lasted 48 years; as also their final deliverance, and extraordinary growth in wealth and strength,
<PB N="14" REF="015256_0013_0F98832FBA047A60"/>
from weakness, poverty and affliction, you are not unacquainted with. Let us now turn our thoughts homeward.</P>
<P>NEW-ENGLAND's beginning, growth and in∣crease, which commenced <HI>here,</HI> and as it were proceeded from <HI>this place,</HI> under and after the endurance of a great many trials, afford no small evidence in the present case, <HI>viz.</HI> that afflictions, under the merciful direction of GOD, are salutary and serve to promote the good of the afflicted.</P>
<P>GOD who knoweth all things, foreseeing the afflictions that his servants (the first settlers here) would endure for his name; and determining to bring them, and with them the Gospel and privi∣leges of it to this land, made early and effectual provision for the same. This he did by a series of noted providences. For instance, by causing <HI>America</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So called from <HI>Americus Vespucius,</HI> a <HI>Florentine.</HI></NOTE> to be explored, as it was by <HI>Columbus</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Or <HI>Colon,</HI> his proper name, a <HI>Genoese,</HI> who was inspired with an uncommon zeal for searching out this new world as it was at first called: Further discoveries of which, a few years after, were made by <HI>Sebastian Cabot,</HI> a <HI>Venetian</HI> employed by <HI>Henry</HI> VII. King of England.</NOTE> in the year 1492. By disposing and directing <HI>Gosnald,</HI> an Englishman, to make more particular discoveries of this part of it in 1602, since called <HI>New-England.</HI> By sending a terrible plague among the natives here, that swept off multitudes of them a few years before the first settlers came.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">As though it had been with design to make them room.</NOTE> And by disposing some gentlemen at home to fa∣vour their cause and afford them assistance, after they had concluded to make their retreat this way. In these and the like ways, GOD as it were searched

out and prepared a place in this wilderness <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to <HI>Rev.</HI> xii.6. <HI>and the woman fled into the wilder∣ness where she hath a place prepared of</HI> GOD;—we may view the flight of our pious fore-fathers from their adversaries at home, unto this then waste howling wilderness as a particular event comprehended in the fulfilment of this passage of scripture.</NOTE> for the flight of his little persecuted flock.</P>
<P>It must be noted that the civil and ecclesiastical powers of England at this time, were against them, on account of their puritan principles. As for King <HI>James</HI> the I. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">One of England's four scourges, or four kings from the north▪ and the first monarch of England that took to himself the title of <HI>sacred majesty.</HI></NOTE> his principles laid a foun∣dation for the persecuting measures that he (and his successors) afterward pursued. His political principles were despotic, and his religious ones were a motly mixture of popery and presbytery, which, with violence, he endeavored to make his subjects swallow.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">As <HI>Granvill</HI> in his history of the wars of England tells us.</NOTE> To this purpose, he (with the high-tempered Bishops) proposed, and vehe∣mently urged a <HI>subscription</HI> to the books of prayer, and all the articles and ceremonies of the church of England, <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">First set on foot in Queen Elizabeth's reign, and now revived with great spirit and a pointed design against the dissenting clergy.</NOTE> threatning the delinquents with severe punishment. This affair of subscription, tho' it was mainly intended to perplex or set aside dissenting ministers, yet reached and wounded all good christians in their communion. As for the doctrinal part of the articles of the church, the dissenters approved of it; this their adversaries were apprized of, and therefore they culled out some disciplinary articles of meer human invention, and offered them as a test to be subscribed. The
<PB N="16" REF="015256_0015_0F9883313A02D868"/>
sum of the articles excepted against and rejected by the dissenters is comprized in the following ones. 1. They (i. e. the ministers) must be re∣ordained, if not episcopally ordained before. 2. They must declare their unfeigned assent and consent to all and every thing contained and pre∣scribed in and by the book of common prayers, and administration of sacraments, and other rites and ceremonies of the church of England. 3. They must take the oath of canonical obedience. 4. They must abjure the taking of arms upon any pretence whatever against the king, or any com∣missioned by him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Edmund Calamy</HI>'s life of <HI>Baxter.</HI></NOTE> These grievous burdens lay principally upon the conscience, and were such as our divine Master never imposed upon his disciples; it was a bold assault upon the sacred right of reli∣gious liberty; however, they must comply or suffer. For,</P>
<P>In consequence of not subscribing or consenting to these or the like articles, tho' otherwise good and peaceable subjects, they were charged with obstinacy, rebellion, heresy, disobedience to au∣thority, and undermining government, yea, and were watched with a severe eye, and pursued with a violent hand, to the destruction of their peace liberty and property.</P>
<P>Their first flight from these oppressors was to <HI>Holland,</HI> and in about eleven years after, many of them took their departure from <HI>Europe</HI> for this country.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the year 1620, and arrived at Cape Cod in November.</NOTE> Their departure was attended with very great difficulties, losses and distresses. The ac∣accounts
<PB N="17" REF="015256_0016_0F988331FAE940C8"/>
given by Governor <HI>Bradford</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As mentioned in Mr. <HI>Prince</HI>'s Chronology and in the Appen∣dix to Mr. <HI>Hutchinson</HI>'s <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Massachusetts-Bay.</NOTE> and others, of their trials, hardships and sufferings, are very affecting; and all this, not for their evil doings, but for not submitting to unscriptural and arbi∣trary impositions. Hence it is no excess of charity to conclude that they suffered for <HI>righteousness sake,</HI> for at the hazard of their lives and fortunes they chose to <HI>obey</HI> GOD <HI>rather than man.</HI></P>
<P>After they had taken their final departure from Europe—crossed the atlantic, and landed on this shore, they had a great many evils to combat. They were distressed on every side, and a gloomy prospect opened to view. The ocean behind them, a wilderness before them, and the severities of winter swiftly approaching. They were soon visited with cold, hunger and sickness, which swept off nearly one half their number, among whom were some of their leading and best men. In this feeble state they were often alarmed and assaulted by the Savages of the wilderness, and had no where to look for protection but to the GOD of heaven.</P>
<P>One might reasonably think that the distresses of this afflicted people would excite the compassion of their adversaries, especially since they were rid of their company; but it was quite the reverse. Their enemies pursued them without mercy, and endeavoured to rob them of their privileges in this, as they had done in their native land. Archbishop <HI>Laud,</HI> one of their greatest enemies, having obtained some false reports against them,
<PB N="18" REF="015256_0017_0F988332BA374A30"/>
found means to procure a high <HI>commission</HI> from <HI>Charles</HI> I. for himself, in conjunction with seve∣ral others in high office and of his own spirit, whereby they were <HI>impowered to revoke all char∣ters, letters patents and rescripts royal, before granted by the crown to the several colonies and plantations, and to make such laws and constitutions as to them should seem meet.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Appendix to Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI>'s Sermon at the ordination of his <HI>Son</HI> in this place.</NOTE> The execution of this commission was, however, prevented by the interposition of some gentlemen of influence in England, and the indefatigable labors of Mr. <HI>Edward W<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>slow,</HI> then agent for the country, who, for his noble exertions, suffered three or four months imprisonment.</P>
<P>It must be owned, with gratitude to Provi∣dence, that this afflicted people had some friends remaining in their native land; and no doubt we have too, the violence of the public measures taken against us notwithstanding; but the governing part was unfriendly to them; and to a very high degree they are so to us their posterity, as appears from their readiness to hear and credit the false reports of our enemies—enacting such restraining laws as go beyond the limits of the constitution—appointing governors and other officers unfavour∣able to the natural and stipulated rights of the peo∣ple—vacating charters without any adequate of∣fence—pulling down the hedges that royal autho∣rity once set up for our defence, and hereby open∣ing a way for what we now see and feel, namely, enormous fleets and armies, with commission and
<PB N="19" REF="015256_0018_0F98833381F87C70"/>
full purpose to distress, destroy or enslave us. These things considered, and the unsuccess they have hitherto met with, gives New-England occa∣sion to adopt the language of Israel in <HI>Psalm</HI> cxxix.2. <HI>Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, yet have they not prevailed against me.</HI></P>
<P>Let us now turn our thoughts to a more light∣some scene, and briefly view the <HI>growth</HI> and in∣crease of this afflicted people under the numerous trials they meet with. GOD, minding to bring them from Europe and settle them in this country, at the appointed time, took them on the wings of his providence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In allusion to <HI>Deut.</HI> xxxii.11. <HI>As an eagle—fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth, them on her wings; so the Lord alone did lead them,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> and wafted them over here. He set their feet upon a rock, and established them so firmly that none of the powers or machinations formed against them have been able to pluck them up; <HI>but the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.</HI> As is said of the rush and the flag that flourish in mire and water, so it may be said of them in many respects; they grew in the mire of foul oppression, and in the waters of deep affliction; and have sent out their roots and branches far and wide. Particularly,</P>
<P>They grew under their afflictions, in the chris∣tian graces and virtues of patience, submission, cha∣rity, courage and true fortitude, praying also with all manner of prayer, supplication and intercession with thanksgiving; and the more they were af∣flicted the more they abounded in praying and humbling themselves before GOD; nor were they unsuccessful in their addresses unto him.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="015256_0019_0F98833439E71308"/>Several churches, in the space of a few years, sprang from this. And, their faith, charity and hopeful prospects resounding to England, many of the good people there, moved by the spirit of GOD, and the desire of christian liberty, came over to this land in great numbers a few years after.</P>
<P>In the year 1628 the settlement of Massachu∣setts colony began, where, in about twenty four years, no less than <HI>twenty two</HI> churches were ga∣thered and settled with pastors. And in the whole of New-England, at this period of time, the num∣ber of churches amounted to <HI>forty three.</HI> This was their religious and ecclesiastical growth.</P>
<P>About the year 1643, emigrations from abroad were so nearly at an end, that it is supposed, as many or more went from us than came to us. At this date of time, the number of souls in this, and the sister colonies of New-England were computed to be <HI>fifteen thousand.</HI> And in the space of nine years after, which brings us to 1652, they rose to <HI>twenty one thousand two hundred.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As Mr. <HI>Johnston</HI> tells us in his <HI>History</HI> of the settlement of Massachusetts Colony, entitled <HI>Wonder-working Providence of Zion's King.</HI></NOTE> And accord∣ing to the public census taken in 1755, the num∣ber amounted to <HI>four hundred thirty six thousand nine hundred and thirty six</HI> souls. Add twenty one years to the above date, which brings us to the present time, and upon a moderate computa∣tion we shall fall but little if any short of <HI>eight hundred thousand,</HI> which supposeth not less than <HI>one hundred thousand</HI> fighting men.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="015256_0020_0F988334F9F061D8"/>This rapid increase, through the good hand of our GOD upon us, began and proceeded under a multiformity of afflictions and oppressions, both from our natural and unnatural enemies. And may we not truly say, that, under GOD, this sur∣prising growth took its rise from the virtue, cou∣rage and success of the first adventurers who settled in this place? If this is the case, as we may rea∣sonably think it is, with what holy admiration and gratitude, may we suppose, the perfected spirits of our pious ancestors now in heaven, to look down and behold the increase of the Redeemer's kingdom, and the flourishing of this country, as owing, in a great measure, to their own small beginnings.</P>
<P>It is probable the other English colonies (which, with these of New-England, do now compose the united States of America) multiplied and grew in proportion as these have done. If so, we have good reason to suppose the whole number of souls in these united States to be not less, but rather more than <HI>three millions.</HI> How amazingly hath this country <HI>multiplied and grew</HI> in the space of 156 years.</P>
<P>Indeed, we are under a thick cloud of darkness at present, but not in despair of light shining upon us, by and by, with increasing lustre. Our hea∣venly Father, provoked with our numerous and aggravated offences, hath visited us with the sore and terrible judgment of war, from a quarter we little expected twenty years ago. He hath suf∣fered Great Britain, once our friends, to become
<PB N="22" REF="015256_0021_0F98833671247D78"/>
our foes, and make war upon us without any suf∣ficient cause that we know of, unless it be their own exorbitant pride and avarice. What more could they reasonably ask or desire of us then they used to have? They had the regulation and bene∣fit of the trade of the whole country—their mo∣narch had a negative upon all our laws; and, up∣on constitutional requisition, our lives and fortunes were devoted to his service and support. What could he, or his parliament have more, unless it were the absolute, unconditional jurisdiction of our properties, liberties and lives? The surrender of these is what they demand, and because we think it an unreasonable demand we are extremely un∣willing to comply with it; nor do we, nor shall we, if we can possibly help it. And what is the consequence? why, they make a general descent upon us with their mighty power, and in the ter∣rible forms of war and vengeance, to bring us at their feet or slay us with death. <HI>The sword is theirs; the hand that permits it is GOD's:</HI> We adore, and bow submission to the perfect righte∣ousness of the latter, but the former we think to be unrighteous altogether. We own ourselves oppressed and distressed on every side, but not yet in despair. Still we hope in our fore-fathers GOD, and he gives us a great deal of encouragement and occasion, both from his word and providence, so to do. <HI>Hitherto the Lord hath helped us</HI>—in the midst of wrath he hath remembered mercy; and should we not acknowledge it with gratitude, it would be an addition to all the other crimes we are chargeable with.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="015256_0022_0F98833680024220"/>How plain to be seen is the merciful influence of Providence in breathing a general spirit of union into, and through the thirteen colonies—in lead∣ing their councils and determinations into so wise a direction as they have taken—in disposing and inclining the whole collective body to unite, again and again, in humbling themselves before GOD and making confessions, prayers and supplications unto him; as also enabling them, under all the inexperience and disadvantages they labour, to make so noble, resolute and successful a stand as hitherto they have done, against the united powers of Great Britain, aided by many thousands of foreign mercenaries. These things considered, to∣gether with the justice of our cause, we are con∣strained to think, unworthy as we are, that the providence of GOD is favourable to our cause and country.</P>
<P>Let all Europe, and the whole world turn their eyes this way, and behold, and wonder to see these young <HI>American colonies</HI> set on fire at both ends and in the middle, and not consumed. Not unto us or an arm of flesh, but to the power and good∣ness of almighty GOD the praise belongs that we are thus far sustained in the fire of a flaming war. We are not only sustained, but in some respects, we grow and increase in the things that belong to our political salvation. The more our adversaries afflict and distress us with the sword of war, the more we grow in military skill, strength and all manner of accomplishments and means of defence. GOD of his infinite mercy grant that we may grow proportionably in the christian graces and virtues!
<PB N="24" REF="015256_0023_0F9883373B5ACF18"/>
This favour granted, we should have good reason to conclude that tho' never so great an host comes against our country, it will live through the war—that we shall rise superior to the powers that com∣bine against us, and finally triumph over all the enemies of our salvation. This we may look for and depend upon, unless by our iniquities we pro∣voke the LORD to turn his hand against us.</P>
<P>In these mighty struggles and bloody wars be-between protestants and protestants, christian churches and christian churches,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For episeopalians and dissenters are united in all the leading principles of christianity.</NOTE> it seems that the time is near at hand foretold of by St. Peter,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Peter iv.17.</NOTE> <HI>When judgment must begin at the house of GOD,</HI> among visible christians, or professors of the same christian religion; and that <HI>the devil is come down having great wrath,</HI> aiming by his instruments to destroy the churches and people (with their privi∣leges) which the Lord our GOD hath planted in this land. But we hope it will please GOD to disappoint him and all his emissaries employed against us, and that we shall escape <HI>as a bird out of the snare of the fowler.</HI></P>
<P>One great <HI>step</HI> hath been taken toward our es∣cape and freedom;<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Viz. a declaration of the independence of the thirteen united American States July 4, 1776.</NOTE> the event of which, we can∣not certainly foretell, tho' we have good reason to think it will be favourable. The step that is taken hath the appearance of a literal accomplish∣ment of one of those scripture prophecies which (if it is to be understood in a literal sense) must
<PB N="25" REF="015256_0024_0F988337FB8503C8"/>
sooner or later take place. There is a prophetic query in <HI>Isa.</HI> lxvi.8.—<HI>Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day, or shall a nation be born at once?</HI> If this passage is considered in a spiritual sense, no doubt it hath reference to the speedy, happy and extraordinary effects of the plentiful effusion of the Holy Spirit. But is there any thing that makes against a more literal fulfilment? If not, it is a question whether any thing has happened for these 1700 years past, that doth so literally and extensively answer this query, as when these thirteen united States, by the voice of their deputies in Congress assembled, were led to declare themselves free and independent of the jurisdiction of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and of all other powers on earth. By this act, we view these States as under no civil government, laws or au∣thority but their own; and if they continue free and united, we may, with good propriety, consi∣der them in their united capacity as <HI>a nation born at once.</HI></P>
<P>However, we readily and religiously own that the establishment and preservation of this new-born nation depends intirely upon the good providence of GOD, in whom we hope and trust for support, protection and deliverance out of all our afflictions.</P>
<P>FROM what hath been said on the subject we are led to conclude, that the LORD will appear to vindicate the just cause of his afflicted people, and sooner or later, turn his hand against their oppressors. Though for their high crimes and
<PB N="26" REF="015256_0025_0F988338BA249908"/>
offences against him, he may suffer the enemies of his people to oppress and distress them to a great degree; nevertheless, when he sees them sufficiently humbled for their sins, and hears them cry unto him for deliverance therefrom, and from the oppressing hand of their enemies, he will arise for their help and come to their rescue. So he did for his people in ancient times; when they were near utterly laid waste by their enemies and cried unto him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm lxxviii.65, 66.</NOTE> <HI>Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine; he smote his enemies in the hinder part, he put them to perpetual reproach.</HI></P>
<P>Hence, it is a vain thing for the powers of earth to attempt the downfal or decrease of those persons or people whom the Lord is minded to build up and increase. The powers of earth may unite their <HI>forces</HI> and take <HI>council</HI> together, but the one shall be broken and the other turned into foolishness; for <HI>who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord hath not commanded it?</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lam. iii.37.</NOTE> We may see, in the growth of the Israelites under the bondage, afflictions and task-masters of Egypt, and in the settlement, increase and flourishing of this country, notwithstanding all the oppositions, hazards and hardships they had to encounter, how easy a thing it is with GOD to frustrate the plans and purposes formed against the people he delights to favour.</P>
<P>Therefore, in all disputes and controversies with our fellow men, it should be our greatest concern
<PB N="27" REF="015256_0026_0F9883397ADA8F10"/>
to have <HI>the Lord with us and for us.</HI> As a means to enjoy this greatest of favours we should have a care, and attend to the following rules, namely, That we do not offend him in word or deed, either by taking his name in vain, or doing a wicked thing.—That we are not aggressors in any quarrel that we may happen to fall into with men.—That our cause, relative to the dispute, be righ∣teous and good, and that our hearts are sincere and upright with God.—That we repent of our past misconduct, and at the same time apply to the blood of atonement for pardon and cleansing; and that our behaviour towards God and man corresponds with the directions given in the holy scriptures. Thus conducting ourselves, we have no reason to fear but the Lord will be on our side, and plead our cause with those that rise up against us.</P>
<P>As for the bloody contest between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and these united States, it is our opinion, upon careful enquiry, that we are not aggressors in the quarrel. While we were yet in quiet, and no public complaint exhibited to disturb us, our ad∣versaries began to conceive mischief against us—to impose heavy burdens upon us, and to rob us of our <HI>stipulated rights;</HI> and because we declined submission to their arbitrary will in all cases, they attempted, and are still attempting to rob us of our <HI>natural rights</HI> too. We only prayed for peace, safety and the free enjoyment of the pri∣vileges included in our natural and stipulated rights, but could not have them. Can any impartial
<PB N="28" REF="015256_0027_0F98833A3B407CD0"/>
judge, or unprejudiced eye, help seeing and deter∣mining in their own minds that our cause is good? Was our public conduct as good as our public cause, we should have good reason to think the present war would soon issue in our favour. And, as things stand, we do not despair, but abound in hope. Tho' our sins against heaven are many and aggravated, yet we have a space and means of re∣pentance continued to us by the patience and goodness of that GOD who is gracious and mer∣ciful—ready to pardon and willing to forgive and save his penitent people, and set them free from the cruel hands of unprovoked oppressors.</P>
<P>May the spirit of grace and supplication—of re∣pentance and reformation be poured upon us from the fulness of him with whom is the residue of the spirit, to the effectual suppression of all impiety and profaneness against God—of injustice, extor∣tion, selfishness and the rest of the vices; and, may righteousness, charity and benevolence, out of a pure heart and faith unfeigned revive, and exten∣sively prevail. Should this happy change take place among us, we are well assured that upon seeking the Lord he would be found of us; we might call upon him and he would answer us agreeably to his own direction and gracious pro∣mise, <HI>call upon me in the day of trouble, I will de∣liver thee and thou shalt glorify me.</HI> Our fore-fathers often experienced the divine faithfulness in this regard; <HI>they cried unto him in their troubles, and he delivered them out of their distresses.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="015256_0028_0F98833AFA560D30"/>In this day of trouble and affliction, it becomes us to retrospect the behaviour and laudable exam∣ple of our pious <HI>ancestors,</HI> who, under all their oppressions, losses and hardships, held fast their integrity—maintained their hope in GOD—com∣mitted themselves and their cause to him, and pro∣ceeded on in the way of their duty with patience, activity and christian fortitude, not thinking their fortunes or lives too dear to part with for the honour of GOD, the peaceable enjoyment of civil and religious privileges, and transmitting the same to after generations. They suffered, laboured, pray∣ed, fasted, fought, and <HI>endured hardness as good soldiers of Jesus Christ.</HI> We have entered into their labours, and for a long time been reaping the fruits of their eminent services and sufferings; and, shall we be so base, or any of us so lightly esteem the rich inheritance and valuable privileges they left us as tamely and stupidly to give them up without trying, and exerting ourselves in every sui∣table way to preserve them?</P>
<P>Rather let us imitate <HI>their</HI> noble example in times of adversity; and, like them, the more we are afflicted by our adversaries or chastened by the hand of Providence, the more let us pray, and humble ourselves before GOD, and confess our sins, and lament the wickedness of the times, and implore <HI>the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> and reform our manners, and improve the means and advantages God hath put into our hands, in the best manner we possibly can, for the salvation of our souls, and our bodies, our lives, liberties, pro∣perty
<PB N="30" REF="015256_0029_0F98833BBA114F88"/>
and country. These are objects worthy our attention; and, as they are all assaulted, either by our temporal or spiritual enemies, we are in duty bound to apply ourselves, with all the skill and resolution we have, to defend and save them. This let us do, relying on the power and grace of <HI>Him, whose is the greatness, and the majesty, and the glory, and the victory,</HI> for assistance and success.</P>
<P>Let us upon this day, in a grateful, decent, and virtuous manner, <HI>recognize the goodness of GOD to our fore-fathers through all their trials and af∣flictions,</HI> and take courage therefrom, to hope in the power and mercy of the same GOD, whose <HI>hand is not shortned that it cannot save.</HI> Let us not enquire, as misers do, who will shew us earthly good, or, how shall we make the greatest and best worldly advantage by the miseries and distresses of the present times? But, how shall we do most for the honour of the glorious GOD—the salvation of our country, and the good of our fellow-men? To promote these great and worthy ends, let us chearfully and religiously devote our abilities, for∣tunes and lives, and be <HI>followers of them</HI> (our pious fore-fathers and other good christians) <HI>who thro' faith and patience, and much tribulation, have entered into the kingdom of heaven.</HI></P>
