<HEAD>A few Words concerning that pi∣ous Youth, of worthy Memory, <HI>to wit, THOMAS SCATTERGOOD,</HI>
<DATE>Jun. who departed this Life the <HI>19th</HI> of <HI>First Month, 1731,</HI> in the <HI>26</HI>th Year of his Age.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>IT being my Lot to be pretty much with him in the Time of his Illness, which he bore with Patience, to Admiration; his Distemper being a <HI>Stoppage in his Stomach or Breath,</HI> he was sometimes almost strangled; yet, when he could speak, his Words, though few, were savory: Many Times Praying to the Lord with a composed Mind, when in great Extremity of Body. I have of∣ten
<PB N="2" REF="040609_0002_101652FDC9DB50C0"/>
thought it great Encourage∣ment for People to endeavour to dwell near the Lord, when we see how he beareth up such as sincerely trust in him: As we have Cause to believe this Youth did. For he would call upon the Lord with a chearful Counte∣nance, and with such Hope and Confidence, as if he no Ways questioned the Lord's Mercy to him; and would often drop sweet Doctrine among such as came to see him, for their Encourage∣ment; often Praying to the Lord, not only for himself, but for the Family, and his Friends and Neighbours. O the many sweet Prayers that I have heard him put up unto the Lord, that he <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> pleased to give him <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> near what his holy Mind and Will was to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im.</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="040609_0003_10165240A3415848"/>
Adding: <HI>O thou pure Fountain! that never can be drawn dry, sweet∣en my Soul a little, and strengthen my inward Man</HI>; with many more precious Sayings: Often say∣ing; <HI>O Lord! raise up many Thou∣sands, from the</HI> East, <HI>from the</HI> West, <HI>from the</HI> North, <HI>and from the</HI> South; <HI>that they may be faith∣ful Ministers unto thee, that so thy Blessed Truth may grow and prosper in the Earth.</HI> Thus was the Concern of this virtuous Young Man, in the Time of his Illness, as it had been in his Health. He was a diligent Fre∣quenter of Friends Meetings, when well; and sometimes he had a Concern upon him to bear a Pub∣lick Testimony for the Truth; which I believe he was faithful to, and retained his Integrity to the End. O that the Youth of our Age
<PB N="4" REF="040609_0004_10165301D9DD6DF0"/>
would take him (and such as he was) for an Example. His De∣portment suited his Clothes, plain; and his Words were seasoned with Grace.</P>
<P>And he would often say: <HI>O that our young People would but give up their Days to serve the Lord! How would he adorn them!</HI> Often directing them to that <HI>Bles∣sed Guide,</HI> meaning the <HI>Spirit of Truth.</HI> He himself was wonder∣fully adorned with that inward Adorning of a <HI>meek and a quiet Spirit, which is with the Lord of great Price.</HI></P>
<P>I write these few Lines, chief∣ly to ease my own Mind concern∣ing One for the Loss of whom my Spirit mourns in secret: Having often been comforted with what dropt from his Mouth; the Pow∣er which attended his Words be∣ing
<PB N="5" REF="040609_0005_10165303C6157308"/>
to my needy Soul as the Oil of the good <HI>Samaritan</HI> to the wounded Man. But the Lord a∣lone is able to make up the Loss, and raise up many more faithful Ministers, as was the fervent Prayer of this Young Man.</P>
<P>I never perceived that the Thoughts of Death were any Sur∣prize to him: But sometimes, when he thought he was near his End, he would be very earnest with the Lord, that <HI>he would give him Patience to bear his Af∣fliction of Body, that he might not dishonour his Holy Name.</HI></P>
<P>I do not remember that I ever heard him speak a murmuring Word, though his Distemper was hard to bear for a long Time; only I have heard him say, <HI>O Lord! What have I done? What have I done, that thou art pleased thus to try me?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="040609_0006_1016530763D6B2A8"/>I have admired to see the Goodness of the Lord to him, and how he fed his Soul with Food convenient and suitable to the Day: For he would sing Praises to the Lord, when he could hard∣ly speak, his Pain of Body was so great: Which hath made my Soul to rejoice, altho', at the same Time, my Heart hath been pain∣ed within me, to see the Afflicti∣on of his Body. But after a long Time, and many Means used, he seemed somewhat to recover, which gave us great Hopes the Lord would have spared him with us longer; he being a Pattern of Piety, Meekness, and Plainness; and seemed as if he might have been of great Service among our young People. But his Distem∣per seizing him sharply again, put
<PB N="7" REF="040609_0007_1016530BE994BEB0"/>
a Period to his natural Life in a little Time, and set his Soul at Liberty from the distressed Body. And I am well satisfied the Lord hath taken him to Himself, to live with Him forever.</P>
<P>I was not with him in his last Moments: But a Person who was with him at that Time signified to me: "That the Night before he departed, he was in a sweet Frame of Spirit; and a few Mi∣nutes before he left the World, he was heard to say, <HI>How glori∣ous is thy powerful Presence, O Lord!</HI> And the last that he was heard to speak, was, <HI>Into thy Hands, O Lord, do I commit my Soul!</HI>"</P>
<P>Having been much with him, and seeing his Zeal, Courage and Constancy, I could do no less than make these Remarks thereof to
<PB N="8" REF="040609_0008_1016530E694E9D90"/>
his Memory. And conclude with Desires that we who have enjoyed so many of the Lord's Mercies, may prize them as we ought to do.</P>
<P><HI>Blessed are the Dead that die in the Lord, from henceforth; yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their Labours, and their Works do follow them,</HI> Rev. iv.13.</P>
<P>Written by One who hath been made a Sharer of the good Coun∣sel which the Lord enabled him to drop among his Relations and Friends, for their Edification and Instruction; Part of which I took to myself, and treasured it up in my Mind.</P>
