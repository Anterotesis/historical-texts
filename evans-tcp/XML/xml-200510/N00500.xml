<P>TIS very Surprising to see and read, what a [<HI>Mundus,</HI> or] <HI>World,</HI> of Pretended ORNAMENTS, the Bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> sets out. <HI>The Daughters of Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on▪</HI> which liv'd in <HI>his</HI> Dayes, as <HI>Rigg'd</HI> withal.

<P>IT may well be reckoned the Brightest <HI>Honour</HI> of that Sex, which the Holy Spirit of God ha's declar'd W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rthy of a Chast and a Kind <HI>Honour</HI> from us▪ <HI>That when the Fulness of Time was Come, God sent forth His Son, made of a Woman.</HI> As a Woman had the <HI>Disgrace</HI> to <HI>Go First</HI> in that horrid and Woful Trans∣gression of our fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st <HI>Parents,</HI> which ha's been the <HI>Parent</HI> of all our misery; so a Woman

<P>THE <HI>Fear of God</HI> is that which the Heart of a <HI>Vertuous Woman</HI> is under the Power of. The <HI>Female Sex</HI> is naturally the <HI>Fearful Sex</HI>; but the <HI>Fear of God</HI> is that which Exceeds (and

It may then be said of a <HI>Vertu∣ous Woman,</HI> That she is a <HI>Religious Woman</HI>; She ha's <HI>Bound</HI> her self <HI>again</HI> to that God, whom She had by the Sin and Fall of her <HI>First Mo∣ther</HI> departed from; She ha's a <HI>Love</HI> which do's not cast <HI>out the Fear</HI> that is no <HI>Fault,</HI> but confirm and settle her in that <HI>Fear</HI> of God; That all kind of <HI>Piety</HI> and of <HI>Charity</HI> is prevail∣ing in her Disposition; That <HI>Sobriety</HI> and <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Godliness</HI> are Visible in her whole Behaviour; and, That She does <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce,</HI> l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcy,</HI> and walks <HI>Humbly</HI> with her G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.
