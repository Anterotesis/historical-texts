<HEAD>EARLY RELIGION URGED.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">On a Day of PRAYER, kept by the Congregation at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eading,</HI> for the Success of the Gospel, on the Hearts of the <HI>Young</HI> in that Congregation. <HI>Anno 1693.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT was the Gracious and Savoury Speech uttered by One of the Greatest Personages in <HI>England,</HI> and perhaps in all <HI>Europe,</HI> unto a Grave Minister; <HI>I have</HI> (said he) <HI>passed thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laces of Honour and Trust, both in Church and State, more than any of my Or∣der in</HI> England, <HI>for Seventy Years before. But were I assured, that by my Preaching I had Conver∣ted but one Soul unto God,</HI> I <HI>should therein take more Comfort, than in all the Honours and Offices that have ever been bestowed upon me.</HI> Yea, 'Twas the Speech of a much Greater than <HI>he, He that Winneth Souls is wise.</HI> And in∣deed, a true Minister of the Gospel, can have no Joy equal unto that of seeing the <HI>Conversion</HI> of his people unto God! But if the <HI>Conversion</HI> of any among our people, more than others, would give Joy unto us, 'tis our <HI>Young</HI> People
<PB N="2" REF="000698_0003_0FA9A73C8821F860"/>
whose Turn to God, we should behold with most of Satisfaction. To <HI>win</HI> one of those, is both Argument and Apology sufficient, for the most vigorous <HI>Essayes</HI> of our Ministry. For my own part, I observe the <HI>Generation,</HI> whereto I do my self belong, advancing very far into the Affairs of the World; But I also observe, the dreadful Plagues of Heaven making a most Lamentable Havock of this my poor <HI>Generation.</HI> Upon this Ob∣servation, what better thing is there to be done for this Generation, then perswasively to Recommend unto them, that <HI>Religion,</HI> the want whereof does not only <HI>Unfit</HI> them for the Action expected from them, but also <HI>Expose</HI> them to the Judgments of a Righteous and a Terrible GOD? Where∣fore, although I have many a time already made the most publick Addresses, that I could, unto the <HI>Young</HI> People of my Coun∣trey, I am willing now at an Age thus far Extending, to conclude my own <HI>Youth,</HI> with one Affectionate Endeavour more, <HI>That they may know the Things of their Peace i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this their Day.</HI> And among other things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat give Countenance unto such an Undertaking, Let me particularly mention the Example of <HI>Jonathans</HI> Expedition, wherein we have one <HI>Young Man</HI> calling upon another, to do Ser∣vice for God and their Generation. When I Read the Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge of our Lord Jesus Christ▪

unto His <HI>Peter,</HI> and in him unto every <HI>Pastor,</HI> I find that the, <HI>Feeding of Lambs,</HI> is to be the <HI>First</HI> part, and at Least one <HI>Third</HI> part, of our <HI>Pastoral Care</HI> And standing this Day in an Assembly so much consisting of those <HI>Lambs,</HI> we would a little Exemplifie that <HI>Care,</HI> by setting before them that Word of God, which may be the more Adapted <HI>Food</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f their Souls. <HI>Young People,</HI> We that are this Day <HI>Fasting</HI> our selves with our <HI>Prayer</HI> to God, for your Conversion, would be <HI>Feeding</HI> of you, with the <HI>Word</HI> of God, in order to that Conversion.</P>
<P>Give now your particular Attention to that Portion of Scripture, in,</P>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM CXIX.9.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Wherewith shall a YOƲNG MAN cleanse his way? By taking heed, according to Thy Word.</P></Q>
<P>THERE are those <HI>Words</HI> now lai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before you, whereof I am to mind you, that like the rest of the Sacred LOOK, wherein you have these <HI>words,</HI> they are, <HI>Non tam Legenda, quam Vivenda,</HI> not only to be <HI>Read,</HI> but also, and much more, to be <HI>Liv'd,</HI> by all who desire the <HI>Lives,</HI> of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Never Dying Spirits.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="000698_0005_0FA9A73DE84F1B68"/>The Psalm wherein you find these <HI>words,</HI> was in a Vision Represented unto the Great <HI>Austin,</HI> as, <HI>The Tree of Life, in the midst of Paradise</HI>▪ and I have now gathered a Deli∣cate <HI>Fruit</HI> from this Glorious <HI>Tree,</HI> to partake whereof, I would this Day most affectionately Invite my own Generation; <HI>Eat, Friends, and Live; Eat, that your Souls may Live!</HI></P>
<P>We have here one of the <HI>greatest</HI> Paragraphs in the BIBLE, Written to Celebrate the <HI>great∣ness</HI> of all the rest. The Word of GOD mention'd in <HI>every Verse</HI> but <HI>Four</HI> or <HI>Five,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n this <HI>Longest,</HI> but <HI>Sweetest</HI> of the <HI>Psalms,</HI> is here justly magnify'd, for its manifold Excel∣lency, and Efficacy. And in <HI>this verse</HI> the <HI>Sanctifying</HI> Vertue of that Word, even upon the <HI>Young,</HI> which are the most unsancti∣fy'd part of Mankind, is particularly Speci∣fy'd.</P>
<P>The Psalmist had been showing that the Word of God points out the way to <HI>Happi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess</HI>; and it is here intimated, <HI>What way</HI> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, 'tis the <HI>Way</HI> of <HI>Holiness</HI>! and the <HI>Young</HI> Man is here called into that Blessed <HI>way.</HI></P>
<P>The Psalm i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Composed in a singular man∣ner <HI>Alphabetically</HI>; Wherein the <HI>Memories,</HI> and perhaps the <HI>Writing-books,</HI> of the <HI>Children</HI> a∣mong the Ancient People of God, seem con∣sulted: and a Text from such a Psalm then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay be very prope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> addressed unto a
<PB N="5" REF="000698_0006_0FA9A73ED8E51F88"/>
<HI>Young</HI> Auditory; as it this Day.</P>
<P>I Remember that the <HI>Wise man</HI> does <HI>in a certain place</HI> report unto us, How his Royal Father did use to <HI>Catechise</HI> him in his Youth; and his being so <HI>Catechised</HI> was that which more than a little contributed unto his beco∣ming so <HI>wise</HI> a <HI>man,</HI> even while a <HI>young</HI> one. It is likely that we have here found one of those Admirable <HI>Echo's</HI> which then passed between those Illustrious Personages: I pray, Let all of <HI>that age</HI> attend unto it.</P>
<P>Our Text is a Demonstration of the Asser∣tion, That the Word of God shows the way to our <HI>Happiness.</HI> 'Tis Demonstrated by this; That this Word Enjoyns and Effects our <HI>Ho∣liness.</HI> And this is here proved, with an Ar∣gument <HI>a Fortiori</HI>;
<Q>That which will be ser∣viceable unto the Designs of <HI>Holiness</HI> in a <HI>Young man,</HI> will be so for <HI>any man</HI>; for <HI>No man</HI> is ordinarily more <HI>Unholy</HI> or more <HI>un∣likely</HI> to be <HI>Holy,</HI> than the <HI>Young man</HI>: But the <HI>Word</HI> of God will do this; if such a wild, such a mad, such an unclean thing as a <HI>Young man,</HI> will <HI>Give Heed</HI> unto it, his <HI>clean∣sed</HI> Heart and Life will have the Marks of a Glorious <HI>Holiness</HI> thereupon.</Q></P>
<P>In the Text we have two things.</P>
<P>First, We have a <HI>Question.</HI> That is, <HI>VVhere∣with shall a Young Man cleanse his way?</HI> It is herein supposed, That the Wayes of <HI>Young</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="000698_0007_0FA9A73F88B8C9C0"/>
People have <HI>much,</HI> yea, <HI>most</HI> of <HI>Sinfulness</HI> defi∣ling of them. It is also supposed, That <HI>Young</HI> People should be sensible of their Defilement. It is further supposed, That the Defilement of <HI>Young</HI> People is Curable. But it is thereupon Enquired, What shall be done for the Redres∣sing of our Disorders▪ and which demands for yet more of your Observation, it was pro∣bably a <HI>Young</HI> man that here made this Enquiry</P>
<P>Secondly, We have an <HI>Answer</HI> to the <HI>Quest∣ion.</HI> That is, <HI>By Taking heed thereto according to thy VVord.</HI> In this <HI>Answer,</HI> we see, <HI>First,</HI> a <HI>Medicine</HI> to be apply'd. That is, The <HI>VVord</HI> of God; whereby is meant, the <HI>Revelation</HI> which God has given of His Mind and Will unto us. We see, <HI>Next,</HI> the <HI>Manner</HI> of applying it. That is, <HI>By taking heed</HI>; which imports a se∣rious Labour of Soul to <HI>Conform</HI> unto what∣ever our God has therein required of us.</P>
<P>I confess, That I want a further <HI>Commentary</HI> upon this Text; but that is a <HI>Practical</HI> one; and I must come to YOU, my <HI>Young</HI> People, for it. It is to YOU, that I come this Day; and it is with this All concerning <HI>Doctrine</HI> that I come.</P>
<P>It is the High <HI>Interest,</HI> and it should be the Great <HI>Study</HI> of YOUNG People, to <HI>TAKE HEED,</HI> that Their <HI>WAY</HI> may be <HI>Cleansed,</HI> according to Gods <HI>WORD.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="000698_0008_0FA9A74485F89080"/>There are two <HI>Propositions</HI> which I must Entreat my <HI>Young</HI> Folks, to Consider in the Fear of God. Believe it, Sirs;</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION I.</HEAD>
<P>There is a woful <HI>Uncleanness</HI> with which the <HI>VVay</HI> of <HI>All</HI> People, and especially of <HI>young</HI> People, too often is contaminated. Our <HI>way</HI> is the <HI>course</HI> of our Actions; the <HI>course</HI> of our Thoughts, our Words, our Deeds. That this <HI>VVay</HI> in <HI>young</HI> People, should be <HI>unclean,</HI> is not so great a matter of <HI>Wonder,</HI> as it is of <HI>Sorrow</HI>; for the <HI>Heart</HI> of <HI>young</HI> People is <HI>Unclean.</HI> The youngest of us all, have cause to say, as in <HI>Psal.</HI> 51.2, 5. <HI>Oh cleanse me from my sin, for I was shapen in Iniquity.</HI> But we may rather ask, what is that <HI>Uncleanness,</HI> which usually cleaves to our way? Now, to that I Reply shortly, SIN is that <HI>Un∣cleanness!</HI> The most vile Thing in the World, is not so odious unto <HI>Us,</HI> as all SIN is unto our <HI>God,</HI> who is <HI>Of Purer Eyes than to behold that Evil.</HI> Those <HI>Oracles</HI> of God, which never mis∣call'd any thing, do still represent, every <HI>Trans∣gression of His Law,</HI> as the vilest <HI>Filthiness.</HI> 'Tis possible, Young People, that when you do some <HI>Sinful</HI> Thing, they seem <HI>Comely</HI> or <HI>Plea∣sant</HI> things unto you; But I pray, Remember, They are all the most <HI>Filthy</HI> Things imagina∣ble.
<PB N="8" REF="000698_0009_0FA9A746C7E86DE8"/>
Rash <HI>Youths,</HI> you touch what is infinitely worse then the foulest <HI>Pitch,</HI> when you meddle with them. Now there is a double <HI>Unclean∣ness</HI> whereto our <HI>Wayes</HI> are liable; there is the <HI>Sin</HI> of <HI>Uncleanness,</HI> and there is the <HI>Uncleanness</HI> of <HI>Sin.</HI></P>
<P>First; Sometimes <HI>Uncleanness</HI> is taken in a stricter Sense, for the SIN OF UNCLEAN∣NESS; and there are few <HI>Young</HI> People so strict in their <HI>Wayes,</HI> as to be altogether free from that <HI>Uncleanness.</HI> The Luxuriant Intem∣perances, which Violate the <HI>Seventh</HI> Command∣ment in the Decalogue, are distinguished by the Name of UNCLEANNESS, because of a singular <HI>Loathsomness</HI> in those Enormities. But it is a rare thing for Young People duely to <HI>Loath</HI> all those Impieties: Oh! how rare a thing is it for Young People, <HI>truly</HI> to say after the Blessed <HI>Ezekiel, Ah Lord▪ My Soul ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not been p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lluted from my Youth up.</HI> 'Tis a common thing, for Young People to Debauch themselves in the <HI>Vomits,</HI> and <HI>Quag∣miras,</HI> of the Uncleannest <HI>Wantonness.</HI> VVe read of <HI>Some,</HI> in Job 36.14. <HI>They Dy in Youth, and their Life is among the Unclean</HI>; and in∣deed how <HI>Many</HI> are there that hasten upon themselves an <HI>Early Death,</HI> by wallowing in such <HI>Uncleanness</HI> until they Dy! The King of <HI>Israel</HI> saw once a wretched person Ensna∣red in the Ruines of <HI>Uncleanness</HI>; but whom
<PB N="9" REF="000698_0010_0FA9A7480E8CBB40"/>
did he see? VVe are told in Prov. 7.7. <HI>I discerned among the Youths, a Young Man void of Understanding. Young</HI> People, have in them the most of <HI>Tinder</HI> for the Temptations of the <HI>Unclean Spirit</HI>; and oftentimes that <HI>Spirit</HI> is hideously and hellishly inflaming of them. Hence 'tis, that if Young People are kept from <HI>Further Pollutions,</HI> yet they frequently plunge themselves into most horrible <HI>Self-pollutions</HI>; 'tis by <HI>them,</HI> that these woful Chil∣dren of <HI>Onan</HI> do Sacrifice the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lood of their Souls unto <HI>Baal-peor,</HI> unto <HI>Priapus,</HI> unto the Devil. Famous is the Story of the Young <HI>Nicaetas,</HI> who, being sollicited unto the Vio∣lations of his <HI>Chastity,</HI> with Circumstances, which he feared he should not otherwis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> withstand, he bit off a piece of his own Tongue, and Spit it in the Face of the Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lot; and by the pain of that VVound, in∣creased the Indignation which he thus Ex∣pressed on that occasion. But how seldom does the Resolution of <HI>Young</HI> People, against all <HI>Uncleanness,</HI> prove so obstinate? how sel∣dom do they Look upon every Glance of <HI>Uncleanness,</HI> with Resentments like those of <HI>Joseph, How shall I do thts VVickedness, and Sin against God!</HI> But,</P>
<P>Secondly, Sometimes <HI>Uncleanness</HI> is taken in a larger sense, for the UNCLEANNESS OF SIN; and in that sense also the <HI>ways</HI> of <HI>Young</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="000698_0011_0FA9A74874E703B8"/>
people are liable to very much <HI>Uncleanness.</HI> There is an <HI>Uncleanness</HI> in all Iniquity; <HI>Original Sin</HI> is a deadly <HI>Leprosy,</HI> and all the out-break∣ings of it are but so many <HI>Putrifying Sores.</HI> Now <HI>Young</HI> people, may upon this very account with peculiar Lamentations, lay their Hands upon their Lips, and cry out, <HI>Unclean! Un∣clean</HI>! T'were an impertinency to quote <HI>Au∣thority</HI> for it, <HI>That all men are sinners</HI>; but besides the Authority of <HI>Ambrose,</HI> that <HI>Vicina Lapsibus est Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scentia,</HI> we may bring an un∣happy <HI>Experience</HI> for it, <HI>That Young people are most emi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ntly, and most viol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntly sinners.</HI> And there are some <HI>Sins</HI> whereto the Young more than others are disposed. Such are the sins, where∣of it was Cautioned, in 2 Tim. 2.22. <HI>Flee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uthful Lusts:</HI> The <HI>Sins</HI> whereof it was re∣quested in Psal. 25.7. <HI>Remember not the sins of my youth:</HI> The <HI>sins</HI> whereof it was com∣plained, in Job 13.26. <HI>Thou makest me possess the Iniquities of my youth.</HI> There are some special <HI>Puddles of Hell,</HI> wherein Ungodly young people are, as in their Element. The Sin of <HI>Inconsiderateness,</HI> or, <HI>putting far away the evil day</HI>; the Sin of <HI>Sensuality,</HI> or, <HI>Walking in the sight of the Eyes</HI>; the sin of <HI>Evil-Fellowship,</HI> or <HI>sitting with vain persons</HI>; the sin of <HI>Mispence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f time,</HI> or <HI>Forgetting the Latter End</HI>; and, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Pride,</HI> or, <HI>the want of a sober mind</HI>; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as these are the sins, which young people
<PB N="11" REF="000698_0012_0FA9A7492FFDF708"/>
are generally too prone unto; yea, when shall you find any of them, that can say, <HI>I have cleansed my heart from such Iniqui∣ties!</HI></P>
<P>But there is a way for it. For, I am now to tell you,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION II.</HEAD>
<P>The WORD of GOD is of Glorious Use, to cleanse the <HI>way</HI> of <HI>all</HI> people, and even of <HI>Young</HI> people, from its Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>minations. Tis marvellous! What is the <HI>Word</HI> of God for? 'Tis answered, in Prov. 1.4. 'tis <HI>To give to the young man, knowledge and discretion</HI>; So, <HI>'twill Give to the Young man Cleanness and Purity.</HI> But there are Three Things, after which we are to be Inquisitive.</P>
<P N="1">I. What WORD of God, should Young people reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd, for the <HI>Cleansing</HI> of their way?</P>
<P>For Answ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; Let young people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no∣thing less tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the WHOLE WORD of GOD. There is no <HI>Word of God,</HI> whereof you may not say, <HI>Good is that word <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Lord</HI>! You are told, in 2 Tim. 3.16.17. <HI>All Scripture is profitable, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>struction in Righteousness; that the man of God ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be perfect, throughly furnished un∣to all good works.</HI> Truly so, <HI>The whole</HI> Word
<PB N="12" REF="000698_0013_0FA9A749E79EAB70"/>
<HI>God, is profitable to make Young people Righteous; that the young man may be throughly purified, in all good ways.</HI> But more particularly, There is the <HI>Word Written,</HI> and you are to regard that Word. It is said in, 2 Peter 1.9. <HI>We have a more sure word of Prophecy, whereto ye do well, that ye take heed, as unto a Light that shineth in a dark place.</HI> You, Young people, are <HI>Young Sai∣lors,</HI> thro' a Dark, Tempestuous, Dangerous World: You had need make the <HI>Written Word</HI> of GOD, the <HI>Pole-star,</HI> by which alone you may shape your Course; and therefore you had need, at least every Four and Twen∣ty Hours, to take <HI>Observation</HI> by that Word. Again, there is the <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd Preached,</HI> and you are also to regard that Word. It is said, in Jer. 3.15. <HI>I will give you Pastors according to mine Heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and with understanding.</HI> You that are Young People, are the <HI>Young Lambs</HI> of our Flocks; Where the <HI>Preached Word</HI> of GOD is to be Enjoy'd in those Assemblies are the <HI>Folds</HI> of Him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is the <HI>Great</HI> and the <HI>Good Shepherd</HI> of yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Souls; you should t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>efore every Week, be there <HI>Folding</HI> in the <HI>Green Pastures,</HI> and by the <HI>Still W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rs,</HI> where you may hear the Voice of your Eternal <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hepherd.</HI> But then,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="13" REF="000698_0014_0FA9A74AB6EA0390"/>II. What is that CLEANSING of the <HI>Way,</HI> which Young People may obtain from this Word of God?</P>
<P>For Answer; <HI>Young People,</HI> 'Tis the MEN∣DING of your <HI>Way,</HI> that is to be the <HI>Clean∣sing</HI> of your <HI>Way.</HI> The <HI>Purification</HI> of your Way, is to be by the <HI>Reformation</HI> of what is amiss in your way. The <HI>Cleansing</HI> of your way, has those two things belonging thereunto; in 2 Cor. 7.1. First, <HI>Let us cleanse our selves from all Filthiness of Flesh and Spi∣rit</HI>; and Secondly, <HI>Let us perfect Holiness in the Fear of God.</HI> The Way of Young Peo∣ple is <HI>Cleansed,</HI> Firstly, When they <HI>Repent</HI> what is <HI>Ill.</HI> It is prescribed, in Prov. 28.13 <HI>He that Confesseth and Forsaketh shall find Mer∣cy.</HI> When you do with a bitter Sorrow of Soul, Acknowledge and Abandon all that is amiss in your Wayes, you then have that <HI>Mercy</HI> of <HI>Cleansed Wayes.</HI> But the Way of Young People is further <HI>Cleansed,</HI> when they <HI>Practise</HI> what is <HI>Good.</HI> It is Expressed, in <HI>Act.</HI> 24.16. <HI>I Exercise my self to have always a Conscience void of Offence towards God and to∣wards Man.</HI> We have <HI>Cleansed Wayes,</HI> when we are <HI>Conscientious</HI> in all our Wayes; and when we have nothing <HI>Offensive,</HI> nothing Provoking, nothing Injurious in them. In short, Young People are to <HI>Forsake</HI> that Way, which the Preacher calls, <HI>The way of
<PB N="14" REF="000698_0015_0FA9A74D44D3E6A0"/>
their own Heart</HI>; and they are to <HI>Follow</HI> that way which the Prophet calls, <HI>The good way, Leading unto Rest.</HI> It is by doing so, that our <HI>way,</HI> is <HI>cleansed</HI> before the Lord. But now,</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> Which way does the <HI>Word</HI> of God <HI>Ope∣rate</HI> for this <HI>cleansing?</HI></P>
<P>For Answer; <HI>Many ways.</HI> But, <HI>Thus</HI> especially.</P>
<P>First, The <HI>Word</HI> of God, is the GLASS, which gives Young People, to see the <HI>Uncleanness</HI> of their Wayes. It is said, in <HI>James</HI> 1.23. <HI>The Hearer of the Word, is like to a man, be∣holding his Natural Face in a Glass.</HI> Young People do often visit the <HI>Glass</HI>; but, Look here, is a most Impartial and most Heavenly <HI>Glass</HI> for you; This <HI>Book</HI> is that <HI>Glass.</HI> If you will fairly set your selves before the <HI>Commandments</HI> in this Book; and Examine your selves upon every one of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Com∣mandments, <HI>How far have</HI> I <HI>Omitted, what is in this Law required</HI>? Or, <HI>How far have I Committed what is in this Law forbidden?</HI> You'l then see the manifold <HI>Uncleanness</HI> of your Wayes, in order to the Removal of that <HI>Uncleanness.</HI></P>
<P>Again, The <HI>Word</HI> of God is the RULE, which tells Young People, how to get off the <HI>Uncleanness</HI> of their Wayes. This is the <HI>Rule</HI> of proceeding, in that Business, in <HI>Isai.</HI> 1.16. <HI>Wash ye, Make you clean, put away the
<PB N="15" REF="000698_0016_0FA9A74DD3AE9300"/>
Evil of your Doings</HI>▪ Young People have a <HI>Rule</HI> here, to show them what is <HI>Clean,</HI> and what is <HI>Unclean</HI>; and a <HI>Rule,</HI> how to <HI>Gain</HI> the former, how to <HI>Shun</HI> the latter. If you will Consult this <HI>Directory,</HI> and the <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mits,</HI> and the <HI>Touchstones,</HI> of Christianity, therein <HI>directed</HI>; you'l see the <HI>Remedies</HI> of <HI>Uncleanness,</HI> as well as the <HI>Opposites</HI> of <HI>Uncleanness,</HI> and get your Wayes Conformed accordingly.</P>
<P>Furthermore, The <HI>Word</HI> of God, is the SPUR, which moves Young People, to seek a Cure for the <HI>Unclearness</HI> of their Wayes. What Incentives unto Holiness, have we in the Word of our God? <HI>Lord, Thy Word is very Pure, and we would Love it, because it quickens us to be so!</HI> The Apostle says, in 2 Cor. 7.1. <HI>Dearly Beloved, Having these Promises, Let us Cleanse our selves.</HI> Thus, Let me say, <HI>Belov∣ed Youths,</HI> In this Word, it is <HI>Promised,</HI> That if you'l be <HI>Pure in Heart,</HI> you shall <HI>See Good</HI>; it is <HI>Promised,</HI> That if you'l be <HI>Undefiled in way,</HI> you shall be <HI>Blessed</HI>; it is <HI>Prom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed,</HI> Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t if you'l have <HI>Clean Hands</HI> and a <HI>Pure Heart,</HI> you shall Receive the <HI>Blessing from the Lord, and Righteous∣ness from the God of your Salvation.</HI> But more than so; In this Word it is also <HI>Threatned,</HI> That if you <HI>Obey Unrighteousness,</HI> there is a Terrible <HI>Indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and Anguish,</HI> to be rendred unto <HI>Every Soul</HI> of you. Well then, How shall we do any other than
<PB N="16" REF="000698_0017_0FA9A74E69D35DF0"/>
<HI>Cleanse</HI> our Wayes, upon the awful Intimati∣ons of such a Word!</P>
<P>Moreover, The <HI>Word</HI> of God is the VEHI∣CLE of that <HI>Spirit,</HI> who Washes Young Peo∣ple from the <HI>Uncleanness</HI> of their Wayes. How or whence is it, that we are any of us Clean∣sed from our Sinfulness? It is answered, in 1 Cor. 6.11. <HI>Ye are Washed by the Spirit of our God.</HI> Now the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God applies Him∣self to the Souls of Young People, in and by this <HI>Word</HI> of His; a Word given by the <HI>Inspi∣ration of that Spirit.</HI> The Regenerating, the Sanctifying <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, Breathes in His <HI>Word</HI>; the <HI>Word</HI> of this Gospel, is the <HI>Dis∣pensation,</HI> and the <HI>Ministration of the Spirit.</HI> Young People, you are in the way of the <HI>Spi∣rit,</HI> when you are sitting under the <HI>Word</HI> of God: and that's the way for you, to obtain the <HI>Cleansing</HI> of your <HI>Way.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, The <HI>Word</HI> of God Exhibits unto Young People, the MEANS whereby they may be <HI>Cleansed</HI> from the <HI>Uncleanness</HI> of their <HI>Wayes.</HI> What is the only <HI>Abstersive,</HI> where∣by our Sinful <HI>Uncleanness</HI> may be taken a∣way? We are answered in 1 Joh. 1.7. <HI>The Blood of Jesus Christ, cleanseth us f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om all Sin.</HI> Now that Invaluable and Efficacious <HI>Blood,</HI> which is the <HI>Blood of God,</HI> is tendered unto Young People in the <HI>VVord</HI> of God. This is the Golden <HI>Vessel,</HI> wherein there is brought unto you that <HI>Liquor of Everlasting Life.</HI> The
<PB N="17" REF="000698_0018_0FA9A75340F64EB0"/>
<HI>Blood</HI> of our Saviour, is that <HI>Blood whereby we are Sanctify'd</HI>: Well, but when you have the <HI>Word</HI> of God Laid before you, you have a most Marvellous, and Gracious profer of this Inestimable <HI>Blood.</HI> The voice of this Word unto you is, <HI>Young People, Behold the Blood of a precious Redemer provided for you; Here, you may Enjoy the Benefits of that Glo∣rious Blood; it is a Soul-cleansing Blood, an Heart softning Blood, a Mind-Healing Blood; Consent that it should be to you such a Blood, and you shall Enjoy the Benefits of that Blood.</HI> The Word of God will <HI>Cleanse</HI> your Wayes, when it procures your Consent unto the <HI>Cleansing</HI> Vertue of our Lords BLOOD upon your Souls. But of these things we may now pass unto some,</P>

we hear a <HI>Sin</HI> rebuked in the Word of God, follow it wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h a Prayer, <HI>Lord, save me from that sin.</HI> When we hear a <HI>Grace</HI> proposed in the Word of God, follow it with a pray∣er, <HI>Lord, fill me with that Grace.</HI> When any thing is <HI>Promised</HI> in that Word, Pray, and Wish, <HI>Lord, let this be my Heritage, and the rejoycing of my heart.</HI> And when any thing <HI>Threatned,</HI> then Wish, <HI>Lord, let not those Judg∣ments come upon me.</HI> There was one of but <HI>Fight</HI> years old, that could say all the New-Testament by Heart: but it may be that thy Leaky Heart, like a <HI>Sieve,</HI> do's <HI>let slip</HI> the Word of God, which is poured thereinto; nevertheless, if the Word passing thro' thy Heart, excite such <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Wishes,</HI> in it, a marvellous <HI>Purificati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul,</HI> will be there∣by Attained.

And Why Then? That is, When Legions

of <HI>Devils</HI> Commissioned by a Neglected and Offended God are about you, throwing the <HI>Chains</HI> of Eternal Darkness, over you, you'l then think of escaping from them▪ You will then first fall to <HI>Serving of God,</HI> which cannot be done without <HI>Fervour of Spirit,</HI> when all the <HI>Spirits</HI> you have left you will not be enough to Grapple with the pains of your <HI>Bo∣dies! Then,</HI> when like <HI>Israel</HI> in Bondage, you will be able to hearken unto nothing for <HI>Anguish of Spirit,</HI> you will, it seems, never <HI>Hearken</HI> until <HI>Then</HI>! Yea, Art thou not fear∣fully <HI>Distracted,</HI> Silly <HI>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uth,</HI> to do nothing for thy Soul, until, the Time, when, for ought thou now knowest, thou shalt be so <HI>Distract∣ed,</HI> as that, not one <HI>Coherent Thought</HI> can come into thy mind! But I'l suppose, that God may Allow you such a long <HI>Space to Repent</HI> as you allot upon. I am nevertheless to tell you, That a <HI>Late</HI> Repentance, is very seldom a <HI>True</HI> Repentance. We have a Daily De∣monstration of this, in those Multitudes of Wretches, who while they lye, as they think, a <HI>Dying,</HI> do bitterly bewail all their <HI>Divellism,</HI> and yet recovering, they play the <HI>Devil,</HI> as much as ever they did before! We have the Report of such a Repentance, in those Terms, Psal. 78.34.36. <HI>When He slew them, then they sought Him; and they returned and Enqui∣red Early after God. Nevertheless they did Flatter Him with their Mouth, and they Lyed unto him,

with their Tongues; for their heart was not right with him!</HI> As I have known many Con∣demned Malefactors, under the Expectation of their Execution, have such Marvellous ex∣pressions of <HI>Repentance,</HI> that one could not have imagined meer <HI>Hyp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crisy</HI> in the bottom of all. And yet I must freely say it, Of those pretended Penitents, that have been Reprieved and Pardoned, I can't Remember <HI>Two,</HI> but what have afterwards Proved Prodi∣gies of Wickedness. Thus <HI>Deceitful</HI> uses to be that <HI>Repentance,</HI> which counts it <HI>Early</HI> e∣nough to be <HI>Seeking</HI> of God, when men find the Almighty God <HI>slaying</HI> of them! Yea, But I have another Check for your Young People's Dilatory Phrenzy; and that is <HI>this.</HI> How do you know, <HI>Young People,</HI> but that an <HI>Early</HI> and a <HI>Sudden</HI> Death, may overtake you! We Read of some, in Job 36.14. <HI>They dy in Youth.</HI> Pray, mind, the next time you step into the Burying-<HI>Place,</HI> whether you can see no <HI>Graves</HI> there, that are shorter than yourselves?

<P>I say then, Are you sure, that you shall e∣ver see either <HI>Old Age,</HI> or <HI>Sickness</HI>! If not, Be not so Mad, as to Venture your Everlast∣ing Interests, upon such desperate <HI>Peradven∣tures.

Young Man,</HI> What if thy <HI>Life</HI> should be out, before this <HI>Year</HI> be out? Why, as the Prophet of Old said unto <HI>One,</HI> thus 'tis probable, that there are <HI>some</HI> now in this Congregation, Whereof it may without an extraordinary Prophecy be said, <HI>This Year thou shalt dye.</HI> And What? will not the suspicion of such a Thing make thee <HI>this Year,</HI> Give <HI>All diligence to make thy Vocation and Election sure?</HI> Yea, 'twas a necessary Advice of a <HI>Rabbi</HI> to a Scholar, <HI>You must be sure to Repent, at Least one Day before you Dy.</HI> And I am to tell <HI>You,</HI> that your <HI>Death</HI> will be very lamen∣tably Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cumstanced, if at <HI>It</HI> you cannot say, <HI>'Tis at least a Day since I made my Peace with God.</HI> But I am to tell you one thing more; Namely; That you cannot <HI>Be sure</HI> of this most Necessary thing, except you do it this <HI>very Day.</HI> For, <HI>Boast not of to Morrow; thou knowest not what a Day may bring forth</HI>!</P>

<P><PB N="57" REF="000698_0058_0FA9AB81C690E498"/>'Tis beyond <HI>Peradventure,</HI> that if you don't hear the <HI>Voice</HI> of God now to <HI>To Day,</HI> your Hearts will grow <HI>Harder</HI> and <HI>Harder</HI> every <HI>Day,</HI> [See Hebrews 3.7. <HI>&amp;</HI> 8.]</P>
<P>'Tis beyond <HI>Peradventure,</HI> that the Longer you continue in your Sins, the deeper and the faster will those <HI>Weeds</HI> of Hell be <HI>Roo∣ted</HI> in your Souls: The Longer the Devil has possession of your hearts, the Strong Ar∣med One, will have so much the <HI>Stronger hold</HI> of you▪ The more <HI>Inveterate</HI> your Dis∣tempers are, the more like to be <HI>Incurable</HI>: Every Day that you go on in your Infide∣lity, you lay a New <HI>Stone,</HI> upon that Hide∣ous <HI>Wall of Separation</HI> between God and You.</P>

What will then become of you, throughout Eternal Ages? We read, That the Threat of a <HI>Fiery Furnace,</HI> once made all the Country, ex∣cept three or four <HI>Young men,</HI> to Renounce the God of Heaven. But I do this Day require all of our <HI>Young Folks,</HI> to Adore, to Obey, to Glorify that Great GOD, by the Denunciation of a more Terrible <HI>Fiery Furnace</HI> unto the Dis∣obedient. It was long ago said, in Mat. 3.7. <HI>Who hath Warned you to Flee from the VVrath to come?</HI> Let our Young People now take notice, <HI>That</HI> they have the fair <HI>VVarnings</HI> of such a <HI>VVrath,</HI> and <HI>VVho</HI> 'tis that has given them such <HI>VVarnings. Young People,</HI> you must Expect that the <HI>VVrath</HI> of God, will multiply Desolations upon you, in this World, if you Despise His Religion. It is from <HI>Him</HI> that I do this Day de∣clare this Thing among you; if you <HI>Apostatize</HI> from the God of your <HI>Fathers,</HI> He that was your <HI>Fathers Friend,</HI> will become <HI>your</HI> Unap∣peasable <HI>Enemy,</HI> and with Ireful, Direful, VVa¦sting <HI>Plagues,</HI> He will take Vengeance on you, for your <HI>Apostasy.</HI> If you persist in putting slights upon Him that would be the <HI>Lord-Re∣deemer</HI> of your Souls, the <HI>Angels of Death,</HI> will get leave to smite you with the <HI>Arrows of Death,</HI> till there be Left but a little <HI>Remnant</HI> of you.

Fury of the Lord is poured on the Assembly of our Young men together</HI>!

in this Land, one of the most Prodigious Things, that ever happened in the World!

As <HI>Moses</HI> could say to the perishing <HI>Israelites,</HI> in Deut. 1.43. <HI>I spake unto you, and ye would not Hear, but Rebelled against the Commandment of the Lord</HI>: Even so, There will at Last be a <HI>Triumph</HI> of <HI>Justice</HI> over you, when there shall come in an Army of <HI>Witnes∣ses</HI> against you; saying, <HI>We Spake to this Young man, but in spite of all our Speaking, he would Re∣bel against the God, that Made him.</HI> Tis possible, Your <HI>Parents</HI> may then after this manner testi∣fy against you: <HI>Lord, when this person, was un∣der our Instruction, we often charged him to Serve thee with a perfect Heart, and a willing Mind; We told him, that if he Sought thee, thou wouldest be found of him, and if he forsook thee, thou wou¦dest Cast him off for ever.

We did in our poor measure set the Example of a Godly, Zealous, Watchful Walk before him; we Pray'd for him, we Wept over him, we were in A∣gonies of Soul that we might see thy Image formed in him.

Nothing would work upon him; and therefore we cannot but Leave him to the Proceedings of thy Everlasting Righteous∣ness.</HI> Young man, Is this the <HI>Report</HI> which thou wouldest have thy <HI>Masters</HI> bring in, unto the Judge of the World▪ concerning thee?</P>

<HI>Lord, we spake unto these poor sinners; We told them of the sins that Ruined them; We told them of the Jesus that would save them from their sins; We told them, How and Why they should make their Peace with God; but no means would Prevail upon them!</HI> The Blood of Your Souls, will <HI>Then</HI> be <HI>Laid,</HI> where it <HI>Now</HI> truly <HI>Lies</HI>; As for us, <HI>We</HI> shall be <HI>Clear</HI> of that <HI>Blood</HI>!</P>

<P>When the Prophet spoke the Word of God, unto an Altar of <HI>Stones,</HI> it Rent be∣fore that Word; O let not your Hearts now be so much Harder than <HI>Stones,</HI> that the Word of the Most High, shall find, or make no entrance thereinto.

that I never had my Affections yet Spiritually Renewed. O Wretched Creature that I am!</P>
<P>But why should I be Discouraged as to the State of my Soul; feeling the <HI>Power of Sin</HI> never so great? Let <HI>Corruption</HI> have never so great Rooting in my Temper, Let my Con∣tinuance therein have been never so long; yet if I Come unto <HI>Christ,</HI> I cannot doubt His <HI>Power</HI> to Relieve me. These Three Scriptures do sufficiently clear <HI>That</HI>; 1 John 1.8. <HI>The Blood of Jesus Christ, Cleanseth from all Sin</HI>; And Mic. 7.14. <HI>He will Subdue our Iniquities</HI>; And, Heb. 7.25. <HI>He is able to Save unto the uttermost.</HI> As to His <HI>Willingness,</HI> 'tis sufficiently cleared, in Mat. 11.28. <HI>Come to Me, all ye that Labour and are heavy Laden:</HI> And, Joh. 6.7. <HI>Him that comes unto me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI> Shall I then Tarry and Perish in my Natural Estate? Shall I be so much wanting to my self, as to perish, while I have a <HI>Physician,</HI> that is both Able and Rea∣dy to help me? Is not his Death deserved, who may have a Physician to Cure him, and will yet Refuse him?</P>

<Q><P>Shall I not Prize the Word of God, not only as the <HI>Private Meditation,</HI> but also the <HI>Publick Dispensation</HI> of the Word? There are Motives to This, not Inconsiderable.</P>
<P>Is not the <HI>Word,</HI> especially the Publick Ministration thereof, that which doth In∣struct me, in the Knowledge of God, and Christ, <HI>whom to know is Life Eternal?</HI> Do's it not shew me what I am to <HI>Believe</HI> concerning God, and what <HI>Duty</HI> God re∣quires of Me? Does not attendance here∣on, Issue in Spiritual <HI>Life,</HI> and <HI>Quicken∣ing</HI>?</P>
<P>Again, Is not the Word of God, the means of Transforming me into His <HI>Image?</HI> Is it not the means, whereby I may hope to have my whole <HI>Soul</HI> cleansed from the <HI>Leprosy</HI> of Sin? Is not the <HI>Hiding of the word in my heart,</HI> the great means to keep me from <HI>Sinning against God?</HI> Is not here Di∣rection given me, how to apply the <HI>Word,</HI> for the Nourishment of my Soul?</P>
<P>Once more, Is it not by the <HI>Word</HI> of God, that I must have all the <HI>Assurance,</HI> that I must expect, to have in this World?</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="000698_0078_0FA9AB96E271D348"/>
Furthermore, If I be Deprived of the Publick Ministration of the Word, must not my Soul needs be in a Condition <HI>Languishing</HI> and <HI>Unprosp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing</HI>?</P>
<P>Yet Further, Is not the Word, the great Instrument of <HI>Regeneration?</HI> Must I not therein seek the Food of my Soul? Shall I not bring a <HI>Curse</HI> on my Soul by neg∣lecting it?</P>
<P>Finally, Is it not an <HI>Ordinance</HI> of Gods Institution?</P>
<P>And now, shall not this make me willing to chuse rather to suffer the greatest <HI>Afflicti∣ions,</HI> than not to attend on the Preaching of the Word?</P></Q>

<Q><P>I do [<HI>he Writes</HI>] much admire, how Persons, that know that they are Enemies to <HI>Religion,</HI> and that if they should be called out of the World within a little while, they should be excluded from the Fruition of Eternal <HI>Happiness</HI> in Heaven, can have a∣ny quietness in their Hearts, while they are yet unresolved, <HI>To live unto God</HI>! But when look upon <HI>my self,</HI> and see how <HI>Unconcerned</HI> I am in my Actings about these matters, which do call for the greatest <HI>Seriousness,</HI> it makes me the less to Wonder at it, yet it ex∣cites

Or, <HI>Whether he should make the Things of this VVorld the utmost of his hopes and his Desires?</HI> For my part, I cannot but greatly wonder to see my own <HI>Sluggishness</HI> in this particular! When I Consider, Whether of the <HI>Two,</HI> I should choose, if they were offered me, An Eternity in the <HI>Pleasures, Profits</HI> and <HI>Honours</HI> of this World, or, to speak specially to my self, That I might always continue in the Condition I am now in: Or, on the other side, An Eternity in the, <HI>Enjoyment of God in Christ,</HI> after my Living here a few years, at the utmost, <HI>Fourscore</HI> Years, and it may be not a <HI>Fourth</HI> part of so many years: And when I see how Loth I am to Choose this Latter, altho I cannot expect, now the Af∣fairs of the World are so Ordered as they are, to continue here on Earth for ever. But it is the most <HI>Reasonable</HI> Thing in the World, that I should make such a <HI>Choice,</HI> as is now

<Q><P>I address this Answer to your Request.

If they drive you to <HI>Despair,</HI> plead, <HI>That you allow them not.</HI> They are but your <HI>Crosses,</HI> as long as you hate them; however there may also be much of your <HI>Corruption</HI> in them. I advise you, to observe the scope of <HI>Satan</HI> in this Temptation; which is to Rob God of the Glory of His <HI>Grace.</HI> Wherefore Do not <HI>Conceal</HI> it; neither do you <HI>Reason</HI> with the Divel about it. When these thoughts a∣rise, tho' you are to be <HI>Humbled,</HI> and pray for pardon; yet you are not to be <HI>Dejected.</HI> But labour to <HI>Cross</HI> them with <HI>good thoughts,</HI> just contrary to them.

<P>IT is not a Year ago, that there Dy'd, a Serious, Vertuous, Hopeful <HI>Young man,</HI> a∣mong us; whose Name was, NATHANAEL SHOVE. He was the Son of a Worthy Minister, whom, the Town of <HI>Taunton,</HI> Long Enjoy'd, as their Watchful Pastor. But being Arrested by a Languishing and Consuming Sickness, he did with his <HI>Dying Hand,</HI> Write about <HI>Threescore</HI> Texts of Scripture, which God had made more singularly useful unto him; whereto he added this Account of his Experiences.</P>

<P>Having for a Long Time, been Lame, and much Afflicted in Body and Spirit, I am by Meditation brought to Look back, and see Gods former and present Dealings with me; and my own Behaviour under them; which, if I know my own Heart, I set down for my own Warning, and the promotion of Repentance in me; and, <HI>An Example to</HI> OTHERS, who may view it af∣ter
<PB N="86" REF="000698_0087_0FA9ABA21E3D3600"/>
me, that they by me, may warn them∣selves not to fall from their <HI>First Love.</HI></P>
<P>Happy are the Children of the Servants of God; who meet with a <HI>Blessing</HI> from e∣very Good <HI>Man</HI> they meet! For my Fathers Sake, I have had many a <HI>Blessing</HI>; and ma∣ny Instructions and Directions, from men of Great Worth. But that which most es∣pecially took place with me, was the Coun∣sel of Mr. — Who asking my <HI>Age,</HI> I told him, <HI>It was Twelve Years</HI>; and he there∣upon said, The Example of <HI>Josiah,</HI> would intimate, that it was <HI>High Time,</HI> and that God Expected it at Least Four Years ago, that I should set my self to <HI>Pray</HI> unto Him, and En∣gage my self, by the <HI>Vowes</HI> of my Soul to Seek and Serve Him. He brought many <HI>Ex∣amples</HI> to quicken me, and <HI>Scriptures</HI> to En∣courage me, and Laid the matter before me in a solemn manner. I now began to consi∣der with my self what a miserable Wretch I was, who had never <HI>Pray'd</HI> but Three or Four Times in my Life: and now I did not know how to go about it. But being also e∣very Sabbath Day at Night, after Repetition, pressed unto the same Duty by my Cousin <HI>Avery,</HI> with whom I dwelt: for it was his Custome, at those times, to warn all his Fami∣ly, with Renewed Arguments, unto their Du∣ties, pleading that if we hearkened not, his
<PB N="87" REF="000698_0088_0FA9ABA309E101C8"/>
<HI>Warning</HI> would be a <HI>Witness</HI> against us,; and he told us, that if we knew not how to Pray, we should Go to God, and He would help us; all this wrought upon me, so that I resol∣ved to beg the Help of God: which doing, I quickly found my self able, not only to Ex∣press my <HI>Desires</HI> unto Him, but to Maintain such a pleasant <HI>Communion</HI> with Him, that nothing could prevent my Morning and E∣vening <HI>Prayers</HI>; and in time, my Delight in it was such, that I Excited <HI>Others</HI> unto the Like; and I perswaded <HI>one other</HI> to Joyn with me, and tast the sweetness of it; and seeing, <HI>he</HI> was so easily drawn from his <HI>Play</HI> to that Duty, I was yet the more Encouraged to continue, and plead with God, His Promise of answering, <HI>Two</HI> or <HI>Three,</HI> that <HI>Gathered to∣gether in his Name.</HI> But in Time, being mis∣sed by our <HI>Play-mates,</HI> we were watched and discovered; and so being often interrup∣ted, we found out <HI>New-places</HI>; but at last, we could come together, but once a Day; and that in the <HI>Evening.</HI> I found then, that God did many times assist me greatly, in my secret Duties; and it was sweet unto me, to Go to God: for many times, in my <HI>Evening-Pray∣ers,</HI> I thought it hard to break off; I thought I could Pray all night, <HI>Without Ceasing.</HI></P>
<P>But after this, yielding to the Temptations of the <HI>Devil,</HI> I grew Dull, and Listless, and
<PB N="88" REF="000698_0089_0FA9ABA4C8F19CA0"/>
could scarce shed a <HI>Tear</HI> in the Duty, or per∣form it, but as a <HI>Task</HI> or <HI>Stint</HI>; and still growing more and more Slothful, at last God visited me by <HI>Sickness,</HI> and brought me <HI>Low,</HI> and made me a little more careful for a Time: but I returned unto my former Sins again, and my Prayers were very Rare and Cold. God had withdrawn His Assisting and Ex∣citing <HI>Spirit</HI> from me; and <HI>Satan</HI> came, and found me, not as our Saviour, in Joh. 14.30. without <HI>Matter</HI> for his <HI>Temptations</HI> to fasten on; but rather as in Mat. 12.44. <HI>Empty, Swept, and Garnished</HI>; tho' <HI>full</HI> of vain Thoughts; ready to Entertain him. My <HI>Goodness</HI> was as the <HI>Morning Cloud</HI> and the <HI>Early Dew,</HI> soon <HI>passing away</HI>; and as in Job 17.11. <HI>My Purpo∣ses were broken off, even the Thoughts of my Heart.</HI> I had had Good Intents, and Designs, made <HI>Vowes</HI> to Serve God; but then I was, as in Rev. 2.4. <HI>Fallen from my First Love.</HI> I was sometimes indeed something Awakened by a <HI>Sermon,</HI> and would just at such an In∣stant, Seek God; but for the most part, the <HI>Word</HI> of God was with me, <HI>As the Seed Sown by the Highway-side.</HI></P>
<P>At last, my <HI>Father</HI>; being visited with Sickness, and thinking himself, not likely to live, he called his Family together, and told us; That he was not like to continue long among us; and therefore he was willing to
<PB N="89" REF="000698_0090_0FA9ABA5EAD9C5B8"/>
give us <HI>Counsil,</HI> How to walk, when he should be gone from us. He Exhorted us, to <HI>Peace</HI> with, and <HI>Love</HI> to one another; He told us, <HI>There were evil times a coming, from which he should be taken away, tho' we should Live to see them:</HI> He therefore advised us, to go unto God, and Plead our <HI>Covenant,</HI> citing that place in Act. 2.39. <HI>for the Promise is to you, and to your Children, and to all that are afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call</HI>; and that in Heb 3.12. <HI>Take Heed, Lest there be in any of you an Evil Heart of Unbelief in De¦parting from the Living God</HI>: and many other Scriptures, with much other Counsel; stirring us up to the Duty of <HI>Prayer,</HI> and promising his <HI>Prayer</HI> for us, as long as he had any Breath; which in part he performed by then praying with us. Three Weeks after this; namely, on <HI>April</HI> 21. 1687. We were Called Early in the Morning, to see our Dear Father going out of the World; who now again told us, That <HI>He was going from the Evil Dayes that were a coming,</HI> and still warned us to be care∣ful, not to Forget the Wayes of God. So he continued Speaking, doubtless Praying for <HI>Us,</HI> Longer than we could understand; and so <HI>He Dyed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This</HI> was very grievous to me: Now my chief <HI>Soul Friend</HI> in this World was gone: I thought my only way was to Go to God, and
<PB N="90" REF="000698_0091_0FA9ABA680982D08"/>
Enquire the Cause of this Affliction; for I feared lest it might be in a way of Judg∣ment against <HI>me,</HI> for my not hearkening to the Word from <HI>Him</HI>: and sad Conclusions I was ready to draw concerning my self. I was now <HI>Young,</HI> (not much exceeding <HI>Eigh∣teen Years</HI>) and my Counseller, and Admoni∣sher, and he who used to Breathe out his Soul before God, with such fervour for me, was gone; which proved most unhappy in∣deed for <HI>me</HI>! For my subtile Adversary the Devil, knowing my Corrupt Nature, suited it with such <HI>Temptations,</HI> as were most Likely to take place. I not only Left off <HI>Constancy</HI> in my Duties, but Readily Entertained <HI>Idle Discourse,</HI> yea, I was too often an <HI>Abetter</HI> thereof; putting the <HI>Evil Day</HI> far away, and depending on a <HI>Too Morrow,</HI> for to do my Soul work in; and giving my self too much up unto the Pleasures of this World.</P>
<P>But in Time, calling to mind a Sermon, which was Preached by Mr. <HI>Brown,</HI> from that place, <HI>Boast not of a To Morrow; I</HI> con∣sidered, it was Dangerous to <HI>Delay</HI>; for Gods Pleasure was, I saw, to Remove <HI>Youn∣ger</HI> as well as <HI>Elder</HI> Ones. But I feared that God had now indeed withdrawn Him∣self from me, and said concerning me, as in Isa. 5.5. <HI>Why should you be stricken any more? Ye will Revolt more and more.</HI> So I begg'd
<PB N="91" REF="000698_0092_0FA9ABA73392FCD8"/>
of God, either to <HI>Draw</HI> me by his Mer∣cies, or <HI>Drive</HI> me by Afflictions. I was al∣so stirred up, by many Sermons of Mr. <HI>Danforths,</HI> to seek unto God, in my <HI>Youth,</HI> and give Him the <HI>Flower</HI> of my Age. And I Joyned my self to some <HI>Young men,</HI> who met at my House, every Sabbath-Evening, to Pray one with and for another. I ma∣ny times made many <HI>Vowes</HI> of Reformati∣on and Obedience, but still I forgat them, and neglected to Watch my Wayes. At last, God by Providences Diminished my Outward Estate, and Refused to Bless the World unto me. And in <HI>February,</HI> 1690. I was visited by Lameness, and forced there∣by to break up House keeping; whence all I had, came to Decay. Now! saw I had done wickedly; for which the Lord had (<HI>I</HI> fear'd) turn'd His Face against me, even for that <HI>I</HI> had not kept close to Him; as, <HI>The Face of the Lord is against them that do Evil.</HI> But yet notwithstanding, it was almost a Twelve month, before <HI>I</HI> had the Sense which I ought to have, of my Afflictions, and the Causes of them. And now, God has helped me to Consider, what should be the Sins, for which He did now Afflict me. I feared, Gods withdrawing of Himself, was not <HI>Probational,</HI> as it was to <HI>Job</HI>: but <HI>Paenal,</HI> for my Spiritual Sloth, as with the <HI>Spouse,</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="000698_0093_0FA9ABA7FA117698"/>
who in Cant. 5.2. was called to Open unto her <HI>Love,</HI> which she deny'd; and then she sought Him, but <HI>He was Gone</HI>; and when she called Him, He would not answer. This I feared to be my Misery; because I had neglected to hearken to the Motions of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> contrary to Gods Command, in 1 Thes. 5.19. <HI>Quench not the Spirit.</HI> I have also Committed some Sins, for which the Spirit checked me; and I have hearkened un∣to Satanical Delusions, rather than the Spirits Motions. Thus I hearkened unto my <HI>Ene∣my,</HI> and Left my <HI>Friend</HI>; and so Grieved the <HI>Spirit,</HI> contrary to that Command, in Eph. 4.30. and this I did with Reiterated Acts, vntil I did like them, in <HI>Isa.</HI> 63.14. <HI>They Re∣belled and Vexed the Spirit.</HI> All these things I knew, were contrary to what I had been in∣structed in: Therefore sometimes I was start∣led with that place, in Heb. 10.26. <HI>If they Sin wilfully, after they have Received the Know∣ledge of the Truth, there remains no more Sacrifice for Sin.</HI> But I Read that in Mr. <HI>Loves</HI> Works that satisfied me,; I was not fallen into the <HI>Unpardonable Sin.</HI> I hoped, I could say with <HI>Paul, That I hated what I did.</HI></P>
<P>But yet my Comforts Ebbing and Flowing, these places came to my sight, 1 Pet. 3.12 Rev. 21.8. 2 Tim. 2:12. 1 Cor. 6.22. John 8.34. John 3.18. Some of which, for a time
<PB N="93" REF="000698_0094_0FA9ABA8B6F25478"/>
Discouraged me, others Excited me to Duty: But I found in me, an unaptness to it.</P>
<P>I was yet Afflicted. But Reading Mr. <HI>Ven∣nings</HI> Works, I was advised, to view and plead the <HI>Promises</HI> of God. Whereupon I Studied so to do; and comforted my self with Heb. 12.8. <HI>If ye be without Chastening, then are ye Bastards and not Sons</HI>; and with the 6th and 7th Verses of that Chapter; and many other places, according to the Trou∣ble I was under. But I was afraid Lest I should deceive my self into Hell; wherefore I begg'd of God, that He would meet me in this <HI>Furnace</HI> of Affliction; and Purge me from my Dross, and shew me the Cause of his Controversy, and help me to cast away all Sin, and guide me rightly to Apply His Promises.</P>
<P>Soon after this, I was put in mind of my Duty, of <HI>Joining to the Church.</HI> I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een minded of it before; but now I was tho∣roughly convinced, that it was my Duty. So, after I had made Search into, <HI>The Order of Churches,</HI> I sought unto God, that He would make way for my being of <HI>One:</HI> which he did; and soon after that, I came to <HI>Braintree,</HI> putting my self into the Doctors Hands.</P>
<P>After <HI>I</HI> had been <HI>Lame,</HI> something more than two Years, I was Confined unto my
<PB N="94" REF="000698_0095_0FA9ABA9DC195C00"/>
Chamber, by a <HI>Consumption</HI>; and People be∣gan to speak unto me, of Death. It seemed comfortable unto me, to hear of <HI>Death,</HI> for I had been for a long time sub∣missively desirous of it; because my heart was so ready to be drawn into sin; and because of the great Danger, my soul was in thereby. But I began again, to enquire of my self, <HI>Why it was, that I was not now afraid of death</HI>? When it was a Terror to so many Good men. I continually examined my Heart, and begg'd of God that I might not be De∣ceived.</P>
<P>After this, a good Old Father, being at Prayer for me, pray'd that I might be <HI>Rai∣sed,</HI> and made Serviceable unto God. I then thought, I had not done well to desire <HI>Death</HI>; for sure, it was the Duty of One, who had had an Heart so sinful above all other Hearts, earnestly to Desire <HI>Life,</HI> that they might be as Extraordinary in the Service of God. I was then <HI>Willing to Live,</HI> and I considered, that God could Keep me from the Power of all my Spiritual Adversaries.</P>
<P>But my Distemper growing, there was lit∣tle Hope of my Life. I then began to be constant in seeking, whether my Courage was well grounded; and once studying on this thing, I looked about, and saw a <HI>Bible</HI> at my Elbow. I opened it, and Lit upon
<PB N="95" REF="000698_0096_0FA9ABABD46BD438"/>
Rom. 5 3, 4, 5. and I thought, I could say, I had Experienced it. After this, many other Comfortable <HI>Evidences</HI> came to my mind; as, The Certainty that there was a Change in me from what I had been; my <HI>Love to the Brethren,</HI> so that if I had only heard of a man Eminently Good, I had immediately a Love to him, tho' I never saw him. Ano∣ther Evidence, and all that my weak Hand is now able to Write, is, I am sure <HI>Sin</HI> is a <HI>Burden</HI> to me, and God has promised <HI>Rest</HI> un∣to such, if they come unto Him.</P>
<P>It is uncertain, How Long I may Ly Lan∣guishing by this Illness: therefore I was wil∣ling to Write something to Comfort me, by Looking on it. The Lord Write the rest in my Heart!</P>

<P>THe <HI>Wars</HI> that have Lately Distressed our Land, have been singularly Destru∣ctive to our <HI>Young men</HI>; but among the <HI>Young men</HI> Lost in these <HI>Wars,</HI> there were some, who were like <HI>Josiah.</HI> They <HI>Dy'd in Peace,</HI> tho' they Dy'd by the <HI>Sword,</HI> inasmuch as they had made their <HI>Peace</HI> with God before they <HI>Dy'd.</HI> Some of <HI>These</HI> had strange <HI>Fore-bodings</HI> upon their Minds, that they should not Survive the <HI>Expeditions</HI> which they were then upon; and according to those <HI>Fore-bo∣dings,</HI> tho' they Returned <HI>Alive,</HI> yet a mor∣tal
<PB N="96" REF="000698_0097_0FA9ABAC6EA9D0E8"/>
Sickness presently carried them off. But before their Going out, they Wrote some Affectionate <HI>Addresses,</HI> unto the Young Peo∣ple of their Acquaintance, of which Wri∣tings, there are some fallen into my Hands. From only <HI>Two</HI> of these, I shall now Tran∣scribe only a <HI>few</HI> Passages, which I hope will be considered, not only by the Young Peo∣ple of those Towns, whereto these belonged, but also, by the rest of our Generation.</P>
<P>The first of these hopeful Young men, be∣longed unto the Town of <HI>Weymouth</HI>; and his Name was <HI>Nash.</HI> He Left behind him, in the Hands of his Young Friends, a Large Paper, of <HI>Admonitions,</HI> wherein One might perceive what Impressions had been made upon his Young Soul, by the Ministry of that Able, Faithful, Painful, and Excellent Person, who is at this Time, the <HI>Burning and Shining Light,</HI> in that Plantation. Out of that Paper, I have Transcribed the following passages.</P>
<Q><P>In the first place, I do acknowledge my self to be unworthy, even to take the Name of the Great and Blessed God, into my mouth; and much more to do any Service for Him. Yet <HI>I</HI> know, it is my Duty to do what Good I can, in such an Extraordinary Time as this is.</P>
<P>We have been going away from the Lord our God; which doth plainly appear by His
<PB N="97" REF="000698_0098_0FA9ABAF1C08AA90"/>
Dispensations towards us. Would the Great and Blessed God, have sent His <HI>Judgments</HI> down upon our Heads, thus one time af∣ter another, if we had not provoked Him by our Sins in Departing from Him.? Hag. 1.5. <HI>Now therefore, thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Consider your Wayes.</HI> But God hath also been calling of us to Turn, by the Voice of His Servants in the Ministry. Oh the many solemn Warnings, we have had in Time past, by the Servants of Christ, especially upon <HI>Election Dayes,</HI> whereby we have been called upon to Repent and Re∣form, and have been told wherein we should Reform!</P>
<P>Now, notwithstanding all that God hath hath done in a way of Judgment, yea, and is yet doing, we have cause to hope, that God is saying, to <HI>New-England,</HI> as to <HI>E∣phraim</HI> of Old, <HI>How shall I give Thee up?</HI></P>
<P>If now we compare Gods <HI>Works</HI> with his <HI>Word,</HI> we shall certainly find, that we have <HI>Something to do,</HI> and that God is calling for some <HI>extraordinary thing</HI> from us; and there∣fore we should every one as we are able, be putting forward, and Labouring in this Great Work of REFORMATION.</P>
<P>Let us Look into the Word of God, and enquire there; and consider, <HI>Firstly</HI> whether
<PB N="98" REF="000698_0099_0FA9A71628468818"/>
there be not a Breach of <HI>Covenant,</HI> between us, and Our God; and that by a great neglect of Duty, in <HI>Parents</HI> towards their <HI>Children,</HI> in their not labouring to Train them up for God.</P>
<P>Secondly, We may Consider, Whether we have not provoked our Lord Jesus Christ exceedingly to Anger against us, by our <HI>Co∣veteousness</HI> and <HI>Worldliness,</HI> which is <HI>Idolatry.</HI> We seem to be Laying out the greatest part, if not all our <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Strength,</HI> in and about the Things of this Life; and so we have been <HI>Exchanging our God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> We may also Consider, Whether we have not provoked our Lord Jesus Christ exceedingly to Anger against us, by our un∣worthy Carriages one towards another; by giving one another just occasions of <HI>Offence.</HI> And for <HI>Church-Members,</HI> that have given themselves up unto the Lord Jesus Christ, to Walk with Him; their Scandalous Lives cause a Reproach to be cast upon Christ, His Church, and the Christian Religion. Also instead of <HI>Provoking one another to Love and Good Works,</HI> we have been provoking one a∣nother to Evil, and to Sin; and instead of <HI>Lo∣ving</HI> one another, as we are Commanded, there is <HI>Hating</HI> one another, and <HI>Envyings,</HI> and <HI>Backbitings,</HI> all which are directly contra∣ry to the Command of Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="000698_0100_0FA9A716ED7FB098"/>
<HI>Fourthly,</HI> We may also Consider, Whether we have not provoked the Lord to Anger, by the neglect of so great and profitable a Duty as, <HI>Secret Prayer.</HI> It is a Duty, whereby we may freely and fully pour out our Com∣plaints to God, which we cannot so freely do before others; and it is a Duty, that Christ has Commanded us to perform, in Math. 6.6. and Eph. 6.18. but it is to be feared, that <HI>many,</HI> if not <HI>the most</HI> of Visible <HI>Church Mem∣bers</HI> do neglect it, or at Least, are not <HI>Con∣stant</HI> in it. But I wonder, (saith Mr. <HI>Increase Mather,</HI> in his Sermon) <HI>how such Men and Women can think, that they belong to God, or that they have a Real Interest in Heaven, who can find in their Hearts to Live without Secret Prayer</HI>!</P>
<P>Yet Again, We may Consider farther, for our Humiliation, Whether or no, we may not be some Hindrance to the Work of <HI>Con∣version,</HI> by our <HI>Bad Examples</HI>; for many do give <HI>Bad Examples</HI> upon several Accounts. If Children and Young Persons, do see Pa∣rents and Masters, <HI>Sleep</HI> at the Meeting, they'l think, they may do so too; and we are all generally too apt to follow <HI>Bad Examples.</HI> And, tho' our Fore-fathers had a Design to Labour the <HI>Conversion of the Heathen,</HI> yet how many be there now, who Teach them to Sin, and so are an Hindrance to the Work of Christ among them?</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="000698_0101_0FA9A717AAD78F50"/>
We may Consider, whether there has been any thorough <HI>Reformation,</HI> since there was a <HI>Synod-Book</HI> put forth, wherein God did no doubt declare the very Evils, whereby He was provoked.</P>
<P>Oh! That we may therefore Set to it, in Good Earnest, that we may <HI>Pour out our Souls</HI> before God, in secret places, that He may be pleased to <HI>Pour out His Spirit,</HI> and Conver∣ting Grace, upon <HI>New-England,</HI> and upon His Churches here, and upon the Rising Genera∣tion!</P></Q>
<P>The other of those Young Men, belonged unto the Town of <HI>Dorchester</HI>; and his Name was <HI>Wykes.</HI> A little before his Decease, he wrote a Paper full of Affectionate and Broken Hearted Expressions, wherein he apply'd him∣self to the Young Folks of his Acquaintance, with Urgent Entreaties that they would mind such Lessons of <HI>Religion,</HI> as their Faithful Pa∣stor had so often pressed upon them. The most of what he writ, I shall Omit, as more proper to be Confined unto the <HI>Manuscript</HI>; but I shall Transcribe some of the more pun∣gent Passages,</P>
<Q><P>Tho' I am now in the Dust, and am Numbred with the Dead; yet here is my mind, while I were Alive; and that is, That you would take Warning by me, and prepare for <HI>Death,</HI> while you have <HI>Time,</HI> while your <HI>Golden Season Lasts.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="000698_0102_0FA9A7198E6C9C98"/>
We read in Rom. 13.11. <HI>Now 'tis High Time to Awake out of Sleep.</HI> Why should we Ly still, when Hell flames are kindling upon us? Why should we stay in this our Dunge∣on, when we may be in the clear Sun-shine? and why will we Love Darkness rather than Light? Surely, 'Tis because <HI>Our Deeds are Evil.</HI></P>
<P>How Delightful it is, unto Sinners, to do the <HI>Devils Drudgery</HI>! They will break whole Nights Sleep, but they will accomplish it; it is so delightful unto them, that they are never weary of it; it is a Race that is <HI>Down Hill,</HI> I think I may say, <HI>Down to Hell</HI>; they are in the way, and if they keep on, they will quickly be there; it may be, before they are aware of it.</P>
<P>I can safely say it, it is the mind of my Heart; I could freely give all the World▪ nay, Ten Thousand Worlds, had I them; could I Recal the Time that I have mispent; those Rich Opportunities that I have neglect∣ed.</P>
<P>The Thoughts of <HI>Death,</HI> are enough to Rend an Heart of Stone. The Thoughts of going out of the World, and beholding mans Face no more, are dismal indeed; to think to go down to the Pit of Silence, and into the Grave of Rest! Yet, these things are but a meer <HI>Shadow,</HI> to what shall be, when
<PB N="102" REF="000698_0103_0FA9A71A84807F10"/>
God shall say, <HI>Depart from Me, Ye Cursed, in∣to Everlasting Fire.</HI></P>
<P>I have taken Pleasure in <HI>Merry Meetings,</HI> and <HI>Company Keeping</HI>; and now, I would, give all the World, that I could undo these things. Now I begin to see the miserable Estate that I am in; and I would give all the World that I could do any good unto <HI>You,</HI> that I could any ways Awaken you.

<P>Sect. 1. LIttle more than Thirteen years Old, was JOHN CLAP of <HI>Scituate,</HI> when He Dy'd; but it might very Truly be said of him, <HI>That while he was yet Young, he began to seek after the God of his Fa∣ther.</HI> From his very Infancy he discovered a Singular Delight in the Holy Scripture, whereby he was made <HI>Wise unto Salvation</HI>; and he also made him self yet further Amiable, by his <HI>Obedience</HI> to his Parents, and his <HI>Courtesy</HI> to all his Neighbours. As he grew up, he signalized his Concern for Eternity, not only by his diligent attendance upon both Publick and Private <HI>Catechising,</HI> but also by the like attendance on the <HI>Mini∣stry</HI> of the Word, which he would Ponder and Apply, and confer about, with much Discre∣tion of Soul, and <HI>Pray</HI> for the Good effect thereof upon his own Soul. Yea, 'twas even from his Childhood observable in him, that
<PB N="104" REF="000698_0105_0FA9A71FA3873AE8"/>
ever after he began to speak Reasonably, he would both affectionately regard the <HI>Family-Prayers,</HI> and likewise, both Morning and E∣vening, with a most unwearied constancy re∣commend himself by his own <HI>Prayers</HI> unto the Mercies of God.</P>
<P>Sect. 2. Arriving higher in his Age, he was very Conscientious of his Duty, both to God, and Man; and particularly careful of his Fathers <HI>Business,</HI> which now became his own <HI>Calling.</HI> At Work with his Father in the Field▪ he would frequently be propounding of <HI>Questions,</HI> by the Answers whereof he might be promoted in the knowledge of God: and at the seasons which others usually imploy to vain purposes, he would be abounding in the exercises of Devotion. But of all the Imitable things to be seen in him, he was exemplary for nothing more, than his endeavours in <HI>Pre∣paration</HI> for, and <HI>Sanctification</HI> of, the <HI>Lords-Day.</HI> Yea, his Parents have affirmed, that for a Year or two before he Dy'd, <HI>They ne∣ver heard an Unprofitable Word come out of his Mouth; but,</HI> he would often bewayl the Idle, Tryfling, Vain Discourses of other People.</P>
<P>Sect. 3. About a a Year and a half be∣fore he Dyed, the Good Spirit of God, Bles∣sed him, with yet a more thorow Convicti∣on of his Misery by reason of <HI>Sin</HI> both <HI>Ori∣ginal,</HI> and <HI>Actual</HI>: whence tho' he had been
<PB N="105" REF="000698_0106_0FA9A720DDF51140"/>
such a <HI>Pattern</HI> of <HI>Innocency,</HI> yet he would ag∣gravate his own <HI>Sinfulness,</HI> with Lamentations truly extraordinary. And for his Relief a∣gainst the <HI>Terrors</HI> of God, wherewith he was now <HI>Distracted,</HI> he was brought unto an ut∣ter Dispair of his own Righteousnesses and Abilities; but in this Condition, he came to Adore the Grace of God, offering a JESUS who is <HI>Able to Save unto the Uttermost</HI>: In his Longings to enjoy the Love of God, thro' <HI>Jesus,</HI> He was like the <HI>Hart panting after the Water-brooks</HI>!</P>
<P>Sect. 4. The Wounds of his <HI>Spirit,</HI> were accompany'd with a Languishing and Con∣suming of his <HI>Flesh</HI>; yet with Great Patience he endured the Hand of God, and he follow∣ed the Lord with <HI>Prayers,</HI> with <HI>Cries,</HI> with <HI>Tears,</HI> for the manifestation of the Divine Love unto him.</P>
<P>It was also Observed and Admired, that when he was abroad at the Publick Worship, in the time of his Weakness, he would <HI>stand</HI> the whole time of the Long exercises, and be so affectionately attentive, that one might see every Sentence uttered in those Exercises, make some impression upon him. The best <HI>Christians</HI> in the place professed thems<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ves, made ashamed by the Fervency of this <HI>Toung Disciple</HI>! And in Days of Publick <HI>Humiliati∣ons,</HI> or <HI>Thanksgivings,</HI> kept with regard unto
<PB N="106" REF="000698_0107_0FA9A721783603C0"/>
the general Circumstances of the Countrey, he would bear his part, with such a sense of the Publick <HI>Troubles</HI> or <HI>Mercies,</HI> as argued more than a common measure of a Publick <HI>Spirit</HI> in him.</P>
<P>Sect. 5. The Minister of the Place, visit∣ing of him, after Sickness had confined him, found him, in an extreme dejection of Soul; his very Body Shook, thro' his Fear, lest the <HI>Day of Grace</HI> were over with him; yet jus∣tifying of God, tho' he should be forever cast among the Damned. But yet his <HI>Fears</HI> were accompany'd with <HI>Hopes</HI> in the Alsufficient me∣rits of the Blessed <HI>Jesus</HI>: in which <HI>Hopes</HI> he still continued using all the <HI>Means of Grace,</HI> according to his Capacity, and Lamen∣ting after those whereof he was not Capa∣ble.</P>
<P>Sect. 6. A month before he Dy'd, he kept his Bed; the <HI>First Fortnight</HI> whereof he was very Comfortless, and yet very <HI>Patient</HI>; a∣bounding all this while in Gracious Admo∣nitions unto other Young People, that they would be concerned for their own Eternal Salvation. And you should not now have heard him complain, that he wanted <HI>Health,</HI> and <HI>Ease,</HI> tho' he did <HI>so</HI>; but that he want∣ed <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Peace,</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI>; yet Expres∣sing a profound Submission to the Will of God. But in the <HI>Last Fortnight</HI> of his Life,
<PB N="107" REF="000698_0108_0FA9A72243A27B20"/>
this poor Child of God, had his weary Soul more comfortably Satiated with the <HI>Promises</HI> of the <HI>New-Covenant.</HI> God filled him with a marvellous Assurance of His Love, and so <HI>Sealed</HI> him with His own <HI>Spirit,</HI> that he <HI>Re∣joyced with Joy Unspeakable and full of Glory.</HI> He would often be saying, <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none on Earth, that I desire beside thee: My Flesh and my Heart faileth, but God is the Strength of my Heart, and my Portion for ever.</HI> And, <HI>I know that my Re∣deemer Lives, and that He shall Stand at the Lat∣ter Day upon the Earth.</HI> And, <HI>If I Live,</HI> I <HI>shall Live unto the Lord; if I Dy, I shall Dy unto the Lord; and whether I Live or Dy, I am the Lords.</HI> And, <HI>When Christ, who is my Life, shall appear, then shall I also appear with him in Glory.</HI> He would profess, that his Communion with the Lord Jesus Christ, was <HI>Inexpressible</HI>; and the Spectators judg'd his Consolations, to be as Great, as could be born, in a mortal Body. Being now asked, <HI>Whether the Thoughts of Dying Troubled him not</HI>? He replyed, <HI>No, Death is no Terror to me, because Christ has taken away my Sin, which is the Sting of Death.</HI> But being ask∣ed, <HI>Whether he was willing to Live?</HI> he answered, I <HI>am willing to submit unto the Will of God; but if God have appointed me to Life, I desire</HI> I <HI>may Live to His Glory.</HI> And being asked, Whether God had put out of Doubt, his Interest in a
<PB N="108" REF="000698_0109_0FA9A7260214BED0"/>
Dying and Rising <HI>Jesus</HI>? He returned, <HI>Yes; and God has fully answered my Desires</HI>; I <HI>am now going to a thousand times better World.</HI> He told his Mother, I <HI>Love you as dearly as my own Life, yet</HI> I <HI>had rather Dy, and be with Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Sect. 7. He continued <HI>Six Dayes,</HI> with his <HI>Teeth</HI> so shut, as that they could not be open∣ed; and for the first <HI>Three Dayes</HI> and Nights, he took no Sustenance; afterwards, tho' this also but seldome, he Sucked in between his Teeth, nothing but a little <HI>Cold Water</HI>: in which Time, they that Laid their Ears to his Lips, could over-hear him continually Expressing his Comfort in God. But just before his Death, his Teeth were opened; when he would often say, <HI>Oh! how precious is the Blood of Christ, it is worth more than a Thousand Worlds</HI>! and often pray, <HI>Come, Lord Jesus, Come quickly</HI>! and at Last, he gave up himself to God, in those words, <HI>Lord Jesus Receive my Spirit.</HI> He de∣sired his Mother to turn his <HI>Face unto the Wall</HI>; whereupon she said, <HI>John, Dost thou now Re∣member</HI> Hezekiah's <HI>Turning his Face unto the Wall?</HI> he said, <HI>Yes, I do Remember it:</HI> and as she Turned him in her Arms, he so quietly breathed his Soul into the Arms of his Blessed Saviour.</P>

<P>GOD was pleased by an <HI>Early Death,</HI> to take SARAH DERBY, out of this <HI>pre∣sent Evil World.</HI> Her <HI>Expectation</HI> of, and her <HI>Preparation</HI> for, her <HI>Death,</HI> even in the Time of her greatest Health, was more than usual; and having by an Exemplary Conversation Recom∣mended <HI>Early Religion</HI> unto those that knew her, about the Age of <HI>Nineteen,</HI> She left them to <HI>Follow her Faith, and Consider the End of her Conversation.</HI></P>

<Q><P>My Soul desires to Believe and Profess that Holy Religion, which is Contained in Mr. <HI>Cottons Catechism.</HI> The Spirit of God has been a Long Time Striving with me; tho' my <HI>Father</HI> Dy'd when I was a Child, <HI>yet</HI> God hath been a <HI>Father</HI> to me.

<P>It pleased God, in the Year 1688. To lay me under Sore Sickness. I was then A∣wakened with a Sense of my Condition, and made many Promises, about walking with God: Which I doubt I have not kept as I should have done.</P>

<P>I have been much Awakened <HI>&amp;</HI> Comfor∣ted by Mr. <HI>Increase Mathers</HI> Book Entituled, <HI>A Call to the Rising Generation.</HI></P>
<P>And I have been much Concerned that I might not resist the Strivings of the Holy Spi∣rit because it is said, in Gen. 6.3 <HI>My Spi∣rit shall not always strive.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="000698_0112_0FA9A727E32C1AC8"/>I humbly Bless God, for his <HI>Restraining Grace,</HI> which I have in some Good measure, enjoy'd all my Days. And I am not with∣out hopes, that he hath bestow'd something of his <HI>Renewing Grace</HI> upon me.</P>
<P>That Scripture has much comforted me, <HI>&amp;</HI> di∣rected me in the affairs of my Soul; Jer. 31.18 19. <HI>I have surely heard</HI> Ephraim <HI>bemoaning himself, thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised—Turn thou me, and I shall be turned.</HI></P>
<P>I have been brought to see <HI>Sin</HI> as a most <HI>Evil thing.</HI> God has enabled me, that I de∣sire to Mourn for it, and to Turn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from it; and therewithal to see more of its <HI>Loath∣someness,</HI> and the <HI>Loveliness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>I have been brought to see, my own <HI>Righ∣teousness</HI> and <HI>Strength,</HI> as nothing before the Lord; and I would go to the Lord Jesus for all; I must come to him, very poor and miserable.</P>
<P>I have thought my self a <HI>Great Sinner,</HI> and one of the Greatest. I have finned with <HI>Ag∣gravations</HI>; and been terrify'd by that Scrip∣ture, in Rom. 2:4.5. <HI>Despisest thou the rich∣es of his Grace? thou treasurest up to thy self Wrath against the Day of Wrath.</HI></P>
<P>But the three first Verses in the Fifty fifth Chapter of <HI>Isaias,</HI> have supported me.</P>

I have also had many sad <HI>Doubts</HI> and <HI>Fears</HI> whether <HI>I</HI> might venture upon all the Ordi∣nances of the Lord Jesus Christ, and whether I should walk answerably to my Engagements But I have been convinced, that I must not live in any sin of <HI>Omission,</HI> upon such ex∣cuses.</P>

<P>The last <HI>Lords Day</HI> of her being abroad, while she was yet in Perfect health, she told one of her intimate Friends, that She had lately in some singular Distress of her Mind, set up al∣most all night, crying to the Lord, that he would please to apply unto her, by His own Holy Spirit, a <HI>Promise,</HI> which might Releive the Disconsolations of her Soul.

<P>Sect. I. LOth to Leave the <HI>Other Sex,</HI> without some Entertain∣ment, which may more particularly Engage <HI>Them,</HI> unto <HI>Early Religion,</HI> I shall add this Example.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thomas Thornton</HI> the aged and faithful Pastor of <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> was blessed with a Daughter named <HI>Pris∣cilla,</HI> which at the Age of Eleven, left this world, ha∣ving first given demonstrations of an Exemplary Piety.</P>
<P>Sect. 2. She was one remarkably grave, devout, se∣rious; very inquisitive about the matters of Eternity; and in her particular Calling very diligent. She was nevertheless troubled with sore <HI>Temptations</HI> and <HI>Exer∣cises</HI> about the state of her own Soul: the Anguish of her spirit, about <HI>Her body of Death,</HI> caused her to pour out many tears &amp; prayers; and she pressed, That some other pious children of her acquaintance, might with her keep a Day of Humiliation together, <HI>That</HI> (as she expressed it) <HI>they might get power against their sin∣ful Natures.</HI> But it pleased God at length to bless the words of her godly mother, for the qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting of her mind. It was her singular Happiness, that she had such godly parents; but it was her Opinion and Ex∣pression, <HI>We trust too much to the Prayers of our Parents, whereas we should pray for our selves.</HI></P>
<P>Sect. 3. At last, she fell mortally sick. In the be∣ginning of her Sickness, she was afraid of Dying; <HI>For,</HI> said she, I <HI>know of no promise to encourage me.</HI> She could not but own that she had in some measure wal∣ked with God; yet she complain'd, That <HI>she had not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God meeting her in her prayers, and making her

heart willing to be at his Dispose</HI>; and that the <HI>Pride</HI> of her heart, now lay as a <HI>Load</HI> upon it. She own'd, That she had many Thoughts of Jesus Christ, &amp; that <HI>it grieved her that she had sinned against Him who had</HI> done <HI>and</HI> dy'd <HI>for her.</HI></P>
<P>Sect. 5. But many dayes were not past, before she could profess her self <HI>Willing to Dy,</HI> with some Assu∣rance of her then going to eternal Blessedness. Many Thanks and Loves did she now render to one of her Superiours, declaring, <HI>'Twas because they had curb'd her, and restrain'd her from sinful vanities.</HI> And she said, <HI>Were I now to choose my Company, it should be among the People of God</HI>; I <HI>see plainly that they are the only company.</HI> She was not without her Conflicts in this time, wherein one of her Speeches was, <HI>Damnation, that is the worst thing of all, but Christ is of all the best; I find it so; Christ is to me, Wisdom, Righitousness, San∣ctification, and Redemption.</HI> She told her Father, She knew she was made up of all manner of Sin; but said she, I <HI>hope God has humbled me and pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>doned me in the Merits of the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> Unto her affectionate Mother she said, <HI>Mother, why do you weep, when</HI> I <HI>am well in my soul? Will</HI> you mourn, <HI>when</HI> I <HI>am so full of</HI> Joy? <HI>I pray rejoice with me.</HI></P>
<P>Sect 5. When she was extreamly spent, she said unto her Parent, <HI>O my Father,</HI> I <HI>have been much trou∣bled by Satan, but</HI> I <HI>find Christ is too hard for him, and sin, and all.</HI> She now said, I <HI>know now that</HI> I <HI>shall dy</HI>; and being asked, Whether she were afraid of Death; with a sweet smile she replied, <HI>No not</HI> I, <HI>Christ is better than Life</HI>! And so she continued in a most joyful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ame, till she dyed: a little before which, it being the <HI>Lords-day,</HI> she asked, What time of the day 'twas,

and when they told her, 'Twas Three of the Clock; she replied, <HI>What? is the Sabbath almost done? well, my Eternal Sabbath is going to begin, wherein</HI> I <HI>shall en∣joy all Felicity, &amp; sing Hallelujahs to al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> ETERNITY.
