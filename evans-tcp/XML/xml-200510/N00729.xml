<HEAD>REFLECTIONS on the Dreadful CASE of Sin Punished With Sin.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Made,

at <HI>Boston</HI>-Lecture.</HEAD>
<P>Give Attention to as <HI>Dreadful</HI> a <HI>Case,</HI> as ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was discoursed! You find it proposed, in</P>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ROM. I.</HI>28.</BIBL>
<P>God gave them over unto a Reprobate Mind, to Do those things which are not Convenient.</P></Q>
<P>THE <HI>Fearful Judgments of Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> upon men, for their <HI>Sins</HI> against Him, are so observably multi∣plied among us, that we are un∣accountably <HI>Sinful,</HI> if we do not Cry out, <HI>Lord, My Flesh Trembleth for Fear of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hee, and I am Afraid of thy Judgments.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="000877_0004_0FAC94D8E09A5BF8"/>But it is to be <HI>Feared,</HI> That the most <HI>Fearful</HI> of all those <HI>Judgments,</HI> are least of all observed Namely, The <HI>Iudgments</HI> wherein the Holy God <HI>Punisheth one Sin with another,</HI> and Leaves a woful Sinner, yet more wofully to Sin against Him. Sirs, These <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, are of all the most <HI>Fearful</HI>; and yet, alas, they are of all the most <HI>Frequent.</HI> Of these amazing <HI>Judgments,</HI> we may say, <HI>How unsearchable are th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Judgments of God, and His Wayes past finding out</HI></P>
<P>These are the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God now before us. The Apostle of the Gentiles, is here decla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring, the <HI>Means</HI> to <HI>know God,</HI> which the <HI>Gentiles</HI> and particularly, the <HI>Romans,</HI> had Enjoy'd is the <HI>Light of Nature</HI>; and relating how they neg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lected and abused those Means, in their not <HI>Glo¦rifying Him as God</HI>; but Inventing, and Erecting and Adoring <HI>vain Images</HI> of Him. The pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gress of the Divine Judgments, against the For<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lorn Gentiles, for their not <HI>Glorifying of God,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> here described unto us. God Left them, <HI>Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this cause,</HI> in the first place, to <HI>become vain in thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Imaginations.</HI> It is a marvellous Thing, I hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> often marvelled at it! That while the more <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>barous Nations</HI> have Worshipped the <HI>Sun,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Moon,</HI> the Stars, and the more specious and gli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tering Objects of Idolatry; such <HI>Learned</HI> Nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ons as the <HI>Egyptians</HI> worshipped a <HI>Bull,</HI> a <HI>Dog</HI> and a <HI>Rat</HI>; The Learned <HI>Graecians,</HI> worshippe <HI>Feavers,</HI> and <HI>Passions,</HI> for their Gods; and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most Learned <HI>Romans</HI> worshipped the very <HI>Fur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>

of Hell. Truly, there was the <HI>Just Wrath</HI> of God, in this Thing, That the Nations, who had most of <HI>Light,</HI> whereby to <HI>know God,</HI> and yet <HI>Glorified Him not as God,</HI> should become thus <HI>Vain in their Imaginations.</HI> But stop'd they here? No; There is mention'd a further Depravation whereto God loft them, in His <HI>Just Wrath</HI> against them, for their Idolatries: <HI>For this cause God gave them up to Vile Affections</HI>; which also imply and comprize <HI>Vile Practices</HI> in them. It is here indeed, Three Times over noted, That God punished their <HI>Idolatries,</HI> by leaving the wretched <HI>Idolaters</HI> to other and farther Abomi∣nations; Especially, He punished the <HI>Spiritual Uncleannesses</HI> of <HI>Idolatry,</HI> by leaving them to the <HI>Corporal Uncleannesses</HI> of <HI>Debauchery</HI>: They who worshipped God under the Shape, it may be, of <HI>Bruits,</HI> were left by God, unto the <HI>Sins,</HI> which made them worse than <HI>Bruits.</HI> If you Read the Old Pagan <HI>Suetonius</HI> his life of <HI>Nero,</HI> you'l see those very Villanies acted, in the Unclean Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> which our Apostle here Brands with Infamy. The Christians at <HI>Rome,</HI> knew where to find a Court, that at this very Time▪ would afford an Exemplification, and Explication, of what the Apostle thus wrote unto them.</P>
<P>In our Text; the matter is once again Re∣peted. Behold, the Holy God here <HI>Punishing</HI> of <HI>Sinners,</HI> by <HI>Giving them over to a Reprobate mind.</HI> But what is a <HI>Rebrobate mind?</HI> It is here Expla∣ned;
<PB N="6" REF="000877_0006_0FAC94DBC6E9FD30"/>
A <HI>mind</HI> let upon doing of <HI>those Things which are not convenient</HI>: Or, which are unrea∣sonably wicked. And a <HI>Black Lest</HI> of those things then follows; The Bottom of Hell it self, could not afford but such a <HI>Black List</HI> of Crying Abominations.</P>
<P>Now there is a very Terrible <HI>Doctrine</HI> which even like a Thunder-bolt hence falls among us.</P>
<P>That the Holy God, often Punisheth <HI>many Sins</HI> of men, by Giving them up to still <HI>Blacker Sins</HI> against Him.</P>
<P>I find, the Jews have a Notable saying; <HI>Mer∣ces Transgressi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nis Transgressio</HI>; That is to say, Men are punished for <HI>One Transgression,</HI> by being therefore <HI>Given up</HI> unto <HI>Another.</HI> And this is the Thing, that is now to be <HI>said</HI> unto us; God help us to Receive with an Agreeable and Pro∣fitable Attention, what shall be <HI>said</HI> concerning it.</P>
<P>There are Two very Important CASES, to be now <HI>Treated</HI> upon.</P>
<P>In the first place, the <HI>Methods</HI> of the Divine <HI>Sov'raignty</HI> and <HI>Equity,</HI> in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> awful manner, are now to be set before us. It is a Subject of deep Enquiry;</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="case">

<P><PB N="7" REF="000877_0007_0FAC94DC612EA100"/>Now this is an Enquiry so full of dazzling <HI>Mystery</HI> and <HI>Amazement,</HI> that it must be answer∣ed, with all <HI>Humble Modesty.</HI> Our Humble An∣swer to it, must be, in these <HI>Conclusions.</HI></P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>Conclusion. I.</HEAD>
<P>There are certain <HI>Spiritual Plagues,</HI> as well as <HI>Temporal Plagues,</HI> among those <HI>Terrible Things,</HI> which a Sinful world is justly <HI>Plagued</HI> wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hal. <HI>Temporal Plagues,</HI> or, Disastrous Blows upon men, in their Secular concerns, are not the only <HI>Punishments,</HI> that their Sins are chastis'd withal; Calamities that befal Sinful men more immedi∣ately in their <HI>Outward man</HI>; Such as <HI>Poverty,</HI> and <HI>Slavery,</HI> and <HI>Reproach,</HI> and <HI>Sickness,</HI> and the Embittermen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and Abbreviations of the <HI>Na∣tural Life,</HI> are not all the Sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges, with which the Sins of men are punished. There is another Sort of <HI>Arrows,</HI> in the te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ible <HI>Quiver</HI> of the Sin-Revenging Lord: Even <HI>Spiritual Plagues,</HI> or direful and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul Strokes from God, upon the <HI>Spirits</HI> of them, that Sin against Him. In these <HI>Plagues,</HI> the God of Heaven, saith, as to that Sinner, in Exod. 9.14. <HI>I will send my plagues upon thy Heart</HI>; The Heart, the Soul, is the Object, that these <HI>Plagues,</HI> more immediately fall upon</P>
<P>This General Conclusion, we lay in the Foun¦dation of our whole Discourse; because to thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Head of <HI>Spiritual Plagues,</HI> is to be referred th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

whole <HI>Case,</HI> of, <HI>One Sin punished with another.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>Conclusion II.</HEAD>
<P>As an Instance of <HI>Spiritual Plagues,</HI> The <HI>Ora∣cles</HI> of God, have often told us, That <HI>Some Sins,</HI> are not only <HI>Consequents,</HI> but also <HI>Punishments</HI> of <HI>others.</HI> To this purpose, we have that famous passage, in <HI>Isa.</HI> 6.10. where, the people who had sinfully <HI>Stopt</HI> their <HI>Ears,</HI> and <HI>Shut</HI> their <HI>Eyes,</HI> have this Judgment passed upon them for it; <HI>Make the heart of this people Fat, &amp; make their Ears Heavy, and Shut their Eyes.</HI> The whole <HI>Jewish Nation,</HI> have now for many Ages, been a Flaming Monument of such <HI>Plagues,</HI> and Fulfilment of the Prophecy that praedicted them: God hath <HI>for this Cause given them up to a vile</HI> Unbelief: they are <HI>Shut up in Unbelief,</HI> as in the <HI>Utter Darkness</HI> of a <HI>Prison,</HI> because they have to criminally Refused the <HI>Lord Messiah</HI>; and in that <HI>Prison of Unbelief,</HI> must they Ly punished, until the <HI>Times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</HI> The Wrath of Heaven, does not <HI>Now</HI> commonly with such <HI>Visible Strokes</HI> from Heaven, cut off them that have provoked it, as perhaps it commonly did, when the Lord more <HI>visibly</HI> Exhibited Himself, as a <HI>King</HI> among His People, in the <HI>Mosaic Paedo∣gogy.</HI> But <HI>Spiritual Plagues,</HI> and such Derelicti∣ons, and such Dispensations, as more immedi∣ately affect the <HI>Spirits</HI> of men, with a <HI>Confirmed
<PB N="9" REF="000877_0009_0FAC953A18938100"/>
State of Sin,</HI> are those that are now <HI>Scattered like Brimstone on mens Habitations.</HI> And yet such <HI>Plagues</HI> also were of <HI>Old</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>flicted, as well as <HI>Now.</HI> Hence we read, in Psal. 81.11, 12. <HI>My people would not Hearken to my voice; so I gave them up, unto their own Hearts Lust, and they walked in their own counsels.</HI> This was to <HI>punish mens former Sins,</HI> by giving them up to <HI>further Sins</HI>; even all the <HI>other Sins,</HI> that their <HI>own Hearts Lust</HI> would incline them unto. Hence we read, in Psal. 95.10, 11. <HI>It is a people that Err in their Heart, and have not known my wayes: Unto whom I sware in my wrath, that they should not Enter into my Rest.</HI> This was to <HI>punish</HI> mens first Refusal of <HI>Entring into Rest,</HI> by giving them up, unto <HI>One Sin</HI> after another, which might bring Desolation upon them. Hence we read, in Hos. 4.17 <HI>Ephraim is joyned unto Idols:</HI> And now, What shall be done to Idolatrous <HI>Ephraim? Enemies</HI>▪ Devour him▪ <HI>Famines,</HI> Consume him! <HI>Thunders,</HI> Batter him▪ No; A worse Thing than all of This, <HI>Let him alone.</HI> But then, I am sure, <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Hell,</HI> won't <HI>Let him alone.</HI> Upon this Passage, I remember one of the Ancients, breaks forth into that Ex∣clamation, <HI>Vis Indignantis D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Terribilem vocem dudire</HI>? 'Tis the <HI>Dreadful Voice of an Angry God!</HI> Ponder to this purpose, Likewise that passage, in <HI>Isa.</HI> 63.17. <HI>O Lord, why hast thou made us to Err from thy wayes, and hardened our Heart from thy Fear</HI>? God punisheth One Sinful <HI>Error</HI> in
<PB N="10" REF="000877_0010_0FAC953A2CCE0FF0"/>
men, by giving them up to another, One Sinful <HI>Hardness,</HI> by giving them up to another. It is an awful Observation, of <HI>Austin's; Jussist et sic est, ut paena sua sibi sit omnis inordi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> affectus.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>Conclusion III.</HEAD>
<P>As well <HI>Scripture</HI> as <HI>Reason</HI> tells us, That <HI>Sins</HI> may truly be accounted <HI>Punishments</HI>; and that it is among the worst of <HI>Punishments,</HI> to be <HI>given up</HI> unto a <HI>Reprobate mind.</HI> As there is a <HI>Moral Evil</HI> in every <HI>Sin,</HI> so <HI>Sin</HI> may be reckoned a <HI>Paen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Evil</HI> too. There is no <HI>Sin,</HI> but what is a <HI>Misery</HI> as well as a <HI>Sin.</HI> A man, by Running into <HI>Sin,</HI> does run into <HI>Darkness</HI>: The Sinner does, according to 1 <HI>Joh</HI> 1 6 <HI>Walk in Darkness</HI>: And is it not a miserable thing to <HI>Walk in Dark∣ness</HI> from day to day? A plagued <HI>Egypt</HI> scarce knew a thing more miserable. By every <HI>Sin,</HI> a man is Degraded, and Debased and Disgraced, and made a miserable Wretch. Hence we are told, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 3 23. <HI>All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.</HI> Alas, By <HI>Sinning,</HI> we very sadly Loose our <HI>glory. Sin</HI> is in the very Nature of it, a Departure from <HI>God:</HI> and there∣fore it is a Departure from the <HI>Chief Good,</HI> and from that <HI>Faelicity,</HI> and <HI>Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ition</HI> which is most of all to be desired. In every <HI>Sin,</HI> a man does that astonishing Thing, in Jer. 2.12. <HI>To Forsake the Fountain of Living Waters, and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w out cisterns
<PB N="11" REF="000877_0011_0FAC953B00AD4B48"/>
that can hold no water.</HI> Now, Sy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Think, and judge, and say, Whether an Immortal Soul, can bring upon it self a greater <HI>misery.</HI> Yea, and the more of <HI>Sin</HI> any man doth commit, the more of <HI>misery</HI> does belong unto that man; and the more of <HI>Wrath</HI> will God at the last propor∣tion out unto him. The Sinner is, as the Bible speaks, <HI>Heaping up Wrath</HI>; and by every New <HI>Sin,</HI> he adds unto that <HI>Heap,</HI> which being Fired by the Breath of God, shall scorch and scald upon him, throughout Eternal Ages. <HI>The Wa∣ges of Sin is Death</HI>; and the more <HI>Sin</HI> that any man hath done, the more of <HI>Wages,</HI> and of Burn∣ings, and of Torments, will belong unto that man for ever. There are also <HI>Degrees</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI>; the Book of Truth informs us, that there are some <HI>Greater Abominations</HI>; and some <HI>Sins</HI> have more of <HI>misery</HI> in them, than others have. Some <HI>Sins</HI> bring more of <HI>Blemish</HI> on the <HI>Names</HI> of men, and more of <HI>Blindness,</HI> and <HI>Bondage,</HI> and <HI>Horror</HI> on their <HI>Minds.</HI> There are <HI>Miscarriages,</HI> that bring more of Confusion with them, and that more confound men in all their Interests. It may be, they are <HI>miscarriages,</HI> that render men presently and grievously obnoxious to the Resentments of the <HI>Societies</HI> which they belong unto, and that bring <HI>Censures</HI> and <HI>Ruins</HI> upon the obnoxious. I have read of a <HI>Judge,</HI> who being to punish a man for <HI>Drunkenness,</HI> ordered that the man should be <HI>Drunk</HI> over again: He
<PB N="12" REF="000877_0012_0FAC953BAB924C00"/>
judged it seems, That the Crime it self was its own <HI>punishment,</HI> a man could not be worse pu∣nished than by being Left unto such a <HI>Beastly Crime</HI>: [and have I not wrong'd the <HI>Beasts,</HI> in calling it so: The <HI>Beasts</HI> affect it not!] Indeed the very <HI>Pagans</HI> themselves have seen cause to say, <HI>Sceleris in Scelere Supplicium. Sin</HI> is its own plague. He that lays all these things together, will be convinced of This, <HI>Lord, Thou dost never punish our Sin more Terribly, than by Leaving us to Sin yet more against thee</HI>!</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>Conclusion IV.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Punishment</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> does ever proceed from the <HI>God,</HI> that is offended by <HI>Sin</HI>; though <HI>Sin</HI> it self do not so. A <HI>Reprobate mind</HI> is not <HI>made</HI> by that God, who is <HI>Goodness</HI> it self, and who alwayes <HI>made all Things very good:</HI> And yet this Good God may order the Effects of a <HI>Reprobate mind,</HI> for to be the <HI>punishments</HI> of those that have done <HI>Evil</HI> before Him. We are wise∣ly to Distinguish, between <HI>Sin,</HI> as it is a <HI>Crime,</HI> and as it may be the <HI>Punishment</HI> of a <HI>Crime.</HI> Now, according to this Distinction, we are cer∣tain, That <HI>God</HI> cannot be the <HI>Author of Sin: Ul∣tor peccati non est Author peccati.</HI> The <HI>Jesuites</HI> and <HI>Arminians,</HI> that Revile us, for Holding that <HI>God is the Author of Sin,</HI> do but show, that they <HI>Resolve</HI> to <HI>Revile: The Lord Rebuke them▪</HI> No, We all Agree to say, He that cannot <HI>Look on

several Holy <HI>Acts</HI> of the Thrice Holy God, in giving a Sinful man up unto a <HI>Reprobate Mind.</HI> When God <HI>Punishes one Sin,</HI> with leaving a man to Another, 'tis by doing that Stupendous Thing, whereof we often Read in His Word; Namely, <HI>The Hardening of the Heart</HI> in such a man. But how is this brought about? Some have con∣ceived, That this was one of the <HI>Unutterable Things,</HI> heard by our Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> when he was <HI>Caught up to the Third Heaven</HI>; Tis very sure, no man on <HI>Earth,</HI> can fully <HI>Utter</HI> this Tremen∣dous Operation of God.</P>
<P>In general; We all Agree with <HI>Austin,</HI> That God <HI>Hardens</HI> not the <HI>Heart</HI> of any man, or gives him up to a <HI>Reprobate Mind, Infundendo Maliti∣am,</HI> or, by Infusing of <HI>Sin,</HI> into his Heart: but He rather does it, <HI>Non Infundendo Gratiam,</HI> or, by not Infusing of <HI>Grace.</HI></P>
<P>Let us more particularly, take up these Appre∣hensions Concerning it.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> The <HI>Original Sin,</HI> which man hath De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raved himself withal, contains in it▪ an hideous and hellish Disposition, to <HI>Every Sin</HI> whatso∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver▪ Besides our <HI>Actual Sins</HI> which are Num∣berless, we have within us, an <HI>Original Sin</HI> which indeed, the <HI>Original</HI> of them all.

<PB N="15" REF="000877_0015_0FAC953DEA54C2F0"/>
<HI>Secret</HI>; the <HI>Original Sin</HI> defiling of our Hearts within us. However, of this most plainly, we have that Confession, in Psal. 51.5. <HI>Behold, I was shapen in Iniquity, and in sin did my Mother con∣ceive me.</HI> Our <HI>First Parents,</HI> whom God justly made the <HI>Representatives</HI> of all mankind, were made <HI>Mutable</HI>; and it was no Unjust Thing in the God of Heaven to make them thus <HI>Mutable: Immutability</HI> is the prerogative of God alone. These <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Parents</HI> being thus <HI>Mutable,</HI> abused the <HI>Liberty</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their own will, and by Sinning against God, they brought a <HI>Pravity</HI> upon their <HI>Natures.</HI> This <HI>Pravity</HI> is with all possible <HI>Equity</HI> unavoida∣bly derived unto <HI>Us,</HI> their Children; who ac∣cordingly bring <HI>Vicious Natures</HI> into the World with us. Now, in this <HI>Original Sin</HI> of our <HI>Na∣tures,</HI> there are the <HI>Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds</HI> of all the Wickedness Imaginable. We are told, in Matth 15.19 <HI>Out of the Heart proceed Evil Thoughts, Murders, Adul∣teries, Fornications, Thefts, False Witness, Blasphe∣mies.</HI> But we are sure, <HI>There comes nothing out of the Vessel, which was not first in the Vessel.</HI> Truly, This <HI>Evil Figment</HI> (as the Jews call it) in the <HI>Heart,</HI> is perpetually <HI>Forging</HI> of Wickedness, and it naturally carries us to all the villanies which a wicked world was ever defaced withal. When you have brought in (if you can do it) a <HI>Ca∣talogue,</HI> of all the monstrous Enormities, that have been drying this World for the Fires of the <HI>Last Conflagration,</HI> Then let me say, <HI>In my

Heart, and in thy Heart, there is a woful Disposition to all of those Enormities!</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II</HI> If God should not by His <HI>Grace,</HI> Restrain the <HI>Rage</HI> of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> in the Hearts of Men, they would soon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ush upon the most <HI>Outrage∣ous Impieties</HI> in the World. As it was said, in Psal. 76.10. <HI>Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee, the Remainder of that wrath shalt thou Re∣strain:</HI> So may we say, <HI>Surely the Rage of Sin is permitted by God, so far as His praise may be fetch'd out of it; but the Remainder of that Rage He Re∣strains most gloriously.</HI> The <HI>Restraints of Grace</HI> upon the children of men are Wonderful.

Hence the persons under those <HI>Restraints,</HI> heartily Hate <HI>Sin,</HI> and Loath <HI>Sin,</HI> &amp; will not freely commit any known <HI>Sin</HI>; but say as in Gen. 39.9. <HI>How can I do this great wickedness, and Sin against God?</HI> Upon <HI>Others,</HI> there are only the <HI>Restraints</HI> of <HI>Common Grace.</HI> There is a <HI>Conscience</HI> in them; and though that <HI>Light within</HI> be so <HI>Darkene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that it is not a sufficient guide unto <HI>Life,</HI> yet this <HI>Light</HI> shows men many <HI>Fair Things,</HI> and Like a <HI>Fire,</HI> it flashes Fiery Rebukes upon them, if they do not those things.

But every man of us all, would be a <HI>Dog</HI>; and a <HI>Devil</HI> too, if the <HI>Restraints of Grace</HI> were taken off. The Devout Martyr <HI>Bradford</HI> therefore, when he heard of any Ex∣traordinary Sin perpetrated in the Neighbour∣hood, would smite his own Heart, and say, <HI>In this Heart of mine is that which would soon betray me into the same Sin, if God should Leave me to my self</HI>! And such was the Speech of the Ancient, on such an occasion. <HI>Ille Heri, Tu Hodie, Ego Cras:</HI> If he Sin'd <HI>Yesterday,</HI> and if Thou Sin <HI>To Day,</HI> I am as Likely to Sin <HI>To morrow.</HI></P>

of</HI>: Men take up unreasonable prejudices against the <HI>way of Truth,</HI> and so they go on in the <HI>way of Sin,</HI> until they dy. Now, God <HI>Orders</HI> it, that when such Things <HI>Do</HI> fall out, as they <HI>must</HI> fall out, our ungodly people shall be acquainted with them. <HI>David,</HI> a professor of the <HI>way of Truth,</HI> did a very Scandalous Thing, upon which he received that Admonition, <HI>By this Deed, thou hast given great Occasion unto the Enemies of the Lord to Blaspheme.</HI> Now, the Lord ha's <HI>Ordered</HI> the Recording of <HI>This Deed,</HI> that men for the Sin of being the <HI>Enemies of the Lord,</HI> may be given up unto their <HI>Blasphemies.</HI> We find, in the writings of the Ancients, that about a Thousand years after this, namely, in the primitive Times of <HI>Christianity,</HI> many <HI>Pagans,</HI> would not be <HI>Christians</HI>▪ and made this plea for it: <HI>The Christians tell us, that their Christianity, is a thing much better than what we profess: but it can't be as they say: for one</HI> David, <HI>was one of their greatest Saints, and by their own Confession, this</HI> David, <HI>was one who did as Damnable Things, as could be done by a mortal man!</HI> Oh! Lamentable Wretchedness! [compare, Ezek. 36.20. with Rom. 2.23, 24.] Sometimes, when a multitude of Sinners must be <HI>Given up</HI> to Sin, God <HI>Orders</HI> it, that they shall see the Scandalous <HI>Immoralities,</HI> that some <HI>Eminent Man</HI> falls into.

An ungodly man, who before this, had some A wo upon him, from the words of that <HI>Minister,</HI> saw the Tragedy: And now, what followed? We read, in 1 King, 13.33. <HI>After this Thing, <HI>Jeroboam Returned not from his Evil way.</HI></HI> Thus, there are Strict pretenders to Godliness, that fall into <HI>Sins,</HI> which give <HI>Scandals</HI> to the Neighbour∣hood: The Neighbours, that were through their own <HI>Sinfulness,</HI> before this, not well-Established in <HI>Godliness, <HI>After this Thing</HI>,</HI> they cast off all Regards of Piety, and become very Impious.

a <HI>more Horrible Thing!</HI> The Revelation of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> is the most Glorious Favour, that ever the God of Heaven Enriched the World withal: And there is as full <HI>Demonstration</HI> given, to the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> as there is for the <HI>Being of a God</HI>: It is impossible for any thing to be more fully <HI>Demonstrated</HI> than This, <HI>That our Blessed Jesus is the Redeemer of the World, and that He is Risen from the Dead.</HI> And yet there is a <HI>Generation of Sinful men,</HI> of late horribly multi∣plyed in the English Nation, who Deride all this <HI>Reveled Religion,</HI> and Blaspheme the Glorious Lord of it.

<P><Q>The <HI>Hydra</HI> of <HI>Socinianism,</HI> hath not only Hissed, but mortally Stung many a Soul in the <HI>Polonian, Hungarian, Transylvanian,</HI> and <HI>Begick</HI> Churches, and I could heartily wish it had never S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vum after <HI>Pelagius,</HI> through the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Sea's, with whole <HI>Polios</HI> ty'd about its Neck, to lay its Poisonous Eggs, in our Se∣minaries.

<P>We read it <HI>Three Times</HI> noted concerning <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> That he <HI>Hardened his own Heart</HI>: But then it follows no less than <HI>Seven Times</HI> upon it, That <HI>the Lord Hardened the Heart of Pharaoh.</HI> Ah, miserable Unregenerates; The <HI>Spirit</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, with His <HI>Righteousness,</HI> is Tendred unto your Acceptance, even that <HI>Spirit</HI> whose office 'tis, to <HI>Preserve your whole Spirit, and Soul, and Body, Blameless unto His Com∣ing.</HI> If you <HI>Harden your own Hearts,</HI> against the calls of the Gospel, to Accept of this <HI>Grace,</HI> t'wil come to This, that <HI>the Lord will Harden your Hearts.</HI> And, when the <HI>Lord</HI> shall <HI>Harden your Hearts,</HI> alas, you'l be <HI>giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> over</HI> to Sin, and <HI>Wrath unto the uttermost.</HI> We read of Some in 2 Thes. 2 10, 11. <HI>Because they Received not the Love of the Truth, that they might be Saved; For this cause, God shall send them Strong Delusion.</HI> Sinners, if you don't <HI>Receive</HI> the <HI>Grace</HI> of the Lord Jesus

<P>Finally; It may be, a <HI>Spirit of Hatred</HI> and <HI>Railing</HI> against the <HI>Faithful Ministers</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, hath Seized some among you. God hath <HI>given over</HI> a Sinful man, to <HI>Sin,</HI> and <HI>Death,</HI> when he comes to say, about a Faithful Minister of God, in 1 King. 22.8. <HI>As for that man, I hate him.</HI> There are many <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, whose whole D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sign and Business it is, to Glorify their Lord, and Edify His people.

the worst <HI>Enemy</HI> they have in the World, makes that man to own, That these are <HI>Good men,</HI> and Love nothing so much as to <HI>Do Good</HI> continually. Well, If such Ministers of the Lord Jesus Christ, were duely <HI>Held in Reputati∣on,</HI> God would probably make their Ministry wonderfully profitable to you; their Ministry might vastly <HI>Help</HI> your <HI>Faith,</HI> your <HI>Joy,</HI> your E∣verlasting Salvation.

Great God is <HI>punishing</HI> of you: He <HI>Gives you over</HI> to all, of this Malignity, because of your <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arrenness</HI> under our Ministry. The Calls of Heaven in our Ministry, have not been duely Entertained; and now God Leaving you, to a Raging and Foaming Madness against <HI>Us,</HI> may seem to say, <HI>Never shall that Ministry, or any o∣ther be of much Benefit, unto those miserable Souls; Thus will I punish them, for their getting so little Benefit heretofore!</HI> O consider of it.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> Let the <HI>Sins</HI> of <HI>Unchastity</HI> be Loath'd by us, with a <HI>Peculiar Antipathy</HI>; because ordinarily there are <HI>more Sins</HI> that follow, to <HI>Punish</HI> them: 'Tis very Rarely otherwise. <HI>Unchast Persons</HI> have this foretold concerning them, in Prov. 5.11, 14. They shall <HI>mourn at the last,</HI> and say, <HI>I was almost in all evil.</HI> Alas, If you wallow in the Nasty Vices, and Puddles, of <HI>Unchastity,</HI> God will give you over, to be <HI>Almost all in Evil</HI>! There are Two Things, that frequently occur among us. One thing very Frequent is This; A per∣son that falls into One <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Unchastity,</HI> if they don't presently with Bleeding Souls fly to the <HI>Blood</HI> of the Lord for Pardon, they are usually left unto another. Yea, and God punishes the <HI>Unclean,</HI> by <HI>giving</HI> them <HI>over,</HI> to proceed from one <HI>kind</HI> of <HI>Unchastity</HI> unto another.

The <HI>Fire of Lust,</HI> becomes like the <HI>Fire of Hell,</HI> in the <HI>Oven</HI> of that <HI>Unchast</HI> Soul; 'tis never quench'd, until God shall drench it in the <HI>Lake</HI> that <HI>burns with Fire and Brimestone.</HI> And another Thing very Fre∣quent is This; A Person abandoned unto the Sins of <HI>Unchastity,</HI> is rarely brought unto Repen∣tance; God punishes the <HI>Unclean,</HI> by <HI>giving</HI> them <HI>over</HI> to Eternal Obduration in their <HI>Unchastity.</HI> These are Sins, whereof 'tis said, <HI>They take away the Heart:</HI> The Bruitified Wretch that is Habi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uated thereunto, ha's <HI>no Heart</HI> for Christ, <HI>no Heart</HI> for Penitence, <HI>no Heart</HI> for Piety left unto him.

I Remember a Notable Stroke of the <HI>Syriack</HI> Interpreter, on that passage, in Psal. 9.16. <HI>The wicked is snared in the work of his own Hand</HI>; unto this purpose, <HI>In senectute quando relinquitur Improbus, a Peccato, turpiter ad idem revocatur in Desiderijs.</HI> An <HI>Old</HI> Sinner, who instead of leav∣ing <HI>Sin,</HI> hath had <HI>Sin</HI> through <HI>Old</HI> Age leaving him, is yet in his <HI>Old Age</HI> again <HI>Ensnared</HI> with the <HI>Lusts</HI> of his youth. And when 'tis said, in Psal. 11.6. <HI>Upon the Wicked, God shall Rain Snares</HI>; I Remember some of the Ancients make this gloss upon it; <HI>Laquei sunt Vetera Peccata (et cupidines) iterum praedominantia</HI>; The <HI>Snares</HI> of the wicked, are their old <HI>Lusts</HI> again getting power over them: As the Poet complains of it, in a man of Fifty years Old, <HI>Intermissa Venus diu, Rursus Bella moves.</HI> Alas, how often do we see God, thus leaving men, to <HI>Ensnaring</HI> Unchastity.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>VI.</HI> Let us walk <HI>Humbly,</HI> and <HI>Softly,</HI> and <HI>Sad∣ly,</HI> all our Dayes, under the sense of <HI>Old Sins,</HI> that we may not be <HI>Punished</HI> with <HI>New Sins</HI> for the <HI>Old</HI> ones.

<P>And there is another Observable Thing, here proper to be mentioned.

<P N="7"><HI>VII.</HI> Let us all take heed of <HI>Sinning with <HI>Presumption</HI></HI>; for <HI>Sin</HI> is mostly and justly the <HI>punishment</HI> of all <HI>presumptuous</HI> Wickedness. 'Tis not usually for <HI>Sins of Infirmity,</HI> that God sends this Horrendous Damnation upon a Sinner, <HI>To give him up unto Sin</HI>: 'Tis for <HI>Sins of presumption,</HI> that is to say, when men <HI>Sin,</HI> and <HI>Know</HI> that they <HI>Sin</HI>: 'Tis as we are here told, for <HI>Holding the Truth in Unrighteousness</HI>; that is to say, when men <HI>Know</HI> the <HI>Truth,</HI> and yet will Do <HI>Unrighte∣ousness.</HI> Hence was that Supplication and Expe∣ctation, in Psal. 19.13. <HI>Keep back the Servant from presumptuous Sins; then shall I be Innocent from much Transgression.</HI> The Advice from Hea∣ven, then to us all, is This; <HI>Do not Rebel against the Light:</HI> God will give us over to the <HI>Dark Influences</HI> of more <HI>Sin</HI> for the punishment of such <HI>Rebellion.</HI></P>
<P>I Address this Advice, very particularly to you, that are <HI>Members</HI> of our <HI>Churches,</HI> in the Full Communion thereof, and Communicants at the Table of the Lord. Oh!

<P><PB N="48" REF="000877_0048_0FAC956125FA7538"/>And that this Advice, may reach to more, that are greatly concerned in it, I now further say, Behold, how much you that have had a <HI>Religious Education,</HI> are to be careful that you do not <HI>Irreligiously</HI> Sin against that <HI>Education.</HI> It may be Remark'd, That there are no greater <HI>Prodigies of Wickedness,</HI> and Scoffers and Haters o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Religion,</HI> than many who have had a <HI>Religi∣ous Education</HI>: There is a <HI>Corruptio Optimi,</HI> in them; the most Generous <HI>Wine,</HI> produces the sowrest and sharpest <HI>Vinegar</HI> of Wickedness.

from God upon thee, That thou shalt be <HI>Given over</HI> to more <HI>Sin,</HI> as one utterly <HI>Incorrigi∣ble</HI>: and as a <HI>Foolish</HI> one, <HI>who will be no more Ad∣monished</HI> There was a man once, who taunted and Scoffed at a man of God, that <HI>Reproved</HI> his Offences; and that man of God saith unto him, in 2 Chron. 25.16. <HI>I know that God ha's Deter∣mined to Destroy thee, because thou hast not Hearken∣ed unto my Reproof.</HI> Is there now any man, <HI>Re∣proved</HI> for an Omission or a Commission, which the Great God is offended at?

<P N="9"><HI>IX.</HI> Finally; Let us with a very particular and profitable Notice, Entertain the <HI>Warnings,</HI> of such as we have seen left unto <HI>Sins,</HI> that have at last brought <HI>Publick Shame</HI> upon them.

<PB N="51" REF="000877_0051_0FAC956362BB72F0"/>
what <HI>Sins</HI> they were, for which the Holy God left them unto the Grosser <HI>Sins,</HI> that have at last brought Ruin upon them. Those <HI>Confessions,</HI> what are they but so many <HI>Warnings</HI> from God unto us all, to <HI>Hear and Fear,</HI> and be∣ware of doing any such Dangerous <HI>Wickedness</HI>? In the Name of God, Sirs, Take these <HI>Warnings,</HI> lest we also be left unto the <HI>Sins,</HI> that have proved so Fatal unto others.</P>
<P>I must now Report unto you, the <HI>Horrible Cries,</HI> that I have known uttered, by Detected Sinners, under the Loads of <HI>Publick Shame,</HI> in the Hours of their Distresses.</P>
<P>There have been some, whom our <HI>Churches</HI> have laid under the <HI>Highest Censure,</HI> for their Wickedness; our <HI>Churches</HI> have in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, pronounced upon them, a <HI>Dreadful Sentence,</HI> of <HI>Excommunication,</HI> as a Token of a more <HI>Dreadful Sentence,</HI> to be pass'd in the Day of God, upon the <HI>Workers of Iniquity</HI>; our <HI>Churches</HI> have <HI>Chased</HI> them out of the <HI>Camp,</HI> for the <HI>Leprosy</HI> of their <HI>Iniquity</HI> found upon them. Now, the <HI>Censured Sinners,</HI> I think, generally make this <HI>Confession, That they made little Con∣science of <HI>Secret Prayer</HI>; long before they fell into the Sins, that brought the Censures upon them.</HI> 'Tis often seen, That when Christians grow Dull, and Cold, in <HI>Secret Prayer,</HI> 'tis not long before they fall into some <HI>Sin,</HI> that layes their Souls a bleeding, fainting, Dying before the

Lord. Grievous Falls from <HI>God,</HI> and Falls into <HI>Sin,</HI> They usually, if you mind it, <HI>begin at the Closet Door.</HI> Would you not be Punished, with Armies of <HI>Sin</HI> prevailing over you? O keep the Hands of <HI>Secret Prayer</HI> lifted up. You'l shortly fall into some horrid <HI>Sin</HI> else, and then have cause to Lament with <HI>Origen, My Secret Pray∣ers, were poorly, if at all, performed in the morning of the Black Day, when God left me to my self!</HI> Yea, some, that have Dyed not long since upon the <HI>Gallows,</HI> there Cryed out, <HI>That their Living without Prayer in their Families Laid them open to all the Wick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dness, for which they were now to Dy so Tragically.</HI></P>
<P>This leads me to add, There have been those among us, that have been Exterminated for <HI>Capital Sins</HI>: the <HI>Sword of Justice,</HI> hath cutt them off, in the Execution of <HI>Just Laws,</HI> which have Condemned such <HI>Criminals</HI> to Dy before their Time. And there are especially Four or Five <HI>Sins,</HI> which I have known, the Malefactors, in the <HI>Cords of Death</HI> at the Gallows, bemoan, as the <HI>Sins</HI> for which the Holy God left them unto the <HI>Crimes,</HI> that were so Capital.</P>
<P>First; Some of the <HI>Dying Malefactors,</HI> have much Lam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nted, the <HI>Sin,</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Apostasy from Good Beginnings in Religion.</HI> They had been un∣der some <HI>Convictions,</HI> and <HI>Awakenings</HI> in their Younger Time, and they had been concerned about the Condition of their <HI>Souls</HI>; but they
<PB N="53" REF="000877_0053_0FAC956516DCAD28"/>
have cast off all <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riousness,</HI> and so gone on from <HI>Bad to Worse,</HI> until they had utterly lost them∣selves in a Deep Gulf of Wickedness: <HI>First I left God, and then God left me, and now. I am come to This</HI>! Thus have I known them Cry out, when the Dimness of the Anguish of Death was upon them. Come then; You that have been well <HI>Catechised,</HI> and <HI>Admonished</HI> in your Child∣hood, and that have afterwards Joyned your∣selves unto <HI>Assemblies</HI> in which the Lord Jesus Christ hath been most <HI>Purely</HI> Worshipped: O Don't <HI>Cast off the Thing that is Good,</HI> lest you Roll down the Hill, without ever Stopping till you come at the <HI>Bottom</HI> of Wickedness. It was the Observation of an Excellent Man,
<Q>That if any began well in the wayes of Religion, &amp; Godliness, and afterwards cast off their Profes∣sion, God usually sets a <HI>Visible Mark</HI> of His Displeasure upon them, even by some Visible Judgment in this World; so that all who passed by, might say, <HI>This was an Apostate!</HI></Q></P>
<P>Again, The <HI>Dying Malefactors</HI> among us, have much Lamented, the <HI>Sin,</HI> of, <HI>Notorious Unprofi∣tableness under the Means of Grace.</HI> Their <HI>Out-cryes</HI> have been, That upon very <HI>Trivial Preten∣ces,</HI> they have commonly Absented themselves from the Publick Ordinances of God; and that when they have heard the <HI>Sermons</HI> in the Pub∣lick, and heard the <HI>Offers</HI> of a Lord Redeemer, they have Sleighted all that they have heard.
<PB N="54" REF="000877_0054_0FAC9565D8C6E540"/>
<HI>This,</HI> This hath been like a Dagger at their Hearts, when they have seen themselves going out of the World; and they have Cryed out, <HI>Oh! how many Worlds would I give now, for that Christ, and Pardon, and Glory, which once I trod un∣der foot! It is because I Refused a Blessed Saviour, that God hath justly let the Destroyer now take pos∣session of me</HI>! And hence also, there are no <HI>Out-cryes</HI> more usually groan'd and Shriek'd, by these Miserables, than those about, <HI>Their Pro∣fanation of the Lords Day!</HI> They usually tell us, That their neglecting to Sanctify the <HI>Lords Day,</HI> and Mispending the Holy Time of that <HI>Day,</HI> gave the <HI>Devil</HI> his <HI>First Advantage</HI> over them. <HI>Then,</HI> and <HI>Thence,</HI> it was, (they tell us) that the <HI>Devil</HI> fill'd their Souls, with all manner of Wickedness. Will you Remember these Things, My Neighbours; and Remembring them, Avoid these <HI>Paths of the Destroyer?</HI></P>

<P>ABout the Year, 1646. here was one <HI>Mary Martin,</HI> whose Father going from hence to <HI>England,</HI> Left her in the House of a Married Man, who yet became so Enamoured on <HI>her,</HI> that he attempted her Chastity.</P>
<P>Such was her Weakness and Folly, that she yielded unto the Temptations of that miserable man; but yet with such horrible Regret of Mind, that begging of God, for Deliverance from her Temptations, her plea was, <HI>That if e∣ver she were Overtaken again, she would Leave her self unto His Justice, to be made a publick Exam∣ple.</HI></P>
<P>Heaven will convince the Sinful Children of men, that the <HI>Vowes,</HI> which they make, Rely∣ing on the Stability and Resolution of their own Hearts, are of no Significancy. A <HI>Chain</HI> of <HI>Hell</HI> was upon her, and the forfeited <HI>Grace</HI> of <HI>Heaven</HI> was witheld from her; She fell a <HI>Third Time,</HI> into the Sin, against which her <HI>Vowes</HI> had been uttered.</P>
<P>Afterwards, going to Service in <HI>Boston,</HI> she found her self to have Conceived: But she Liv∣ed with a favourable Mistress, who would ad∣mit and allow no suspicion of her <HI>Dishonesty,</HI></P>
<P>A Question, Like that Convincing One, of our Saviours unto the Woman of <HI>Samaria,</HI> was once oddly put unto her; Mary, <HI>Where is thy

Husband?</HI> And One said also; <HI>Did I not think, thou wer't an honest and sincere Creature, I should verily think, thou wer't with Child!</HI> These passa∣ges, which were warnings from God, unto her guilty Soul, did serve only to strike her with <HI>A∣mazement,</HI> not with any true <HI>Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>She concealed her Crime, till the Time of her Delivery; and then, being Delivered a∣lone, by her self in a Dark Room, She Murder∣ed the harmless and helpless <HI>Infant</HI>; hiding it in a Chest, from the Eyes of all, but the Jealous GOD.</P>
<P>The <HI>Blood</HI> of the Child Cried, when the Cry of the Child it self were thus cruelly sti∣fled. Some circumstances quickly occurr'd, which obliged her Friends to charge her with an <HI>Unlawful Birth.</HI> She Denied it Impudently. A further Search confuted her Denial. She then said; <HI>The Child was Dead Born, and she had Burnt it to Ashes.</HI> With an Hypocritical Tear, she added, <HI>Oh! that it were True, that the poor Babe were any where to be seen</HI>! At Last it was found in her Chest; &amp; when she Touch'd the <HI>Face</HI> of it before the Jury, the <HI>Blood</HI> came fresh into it. So She confessed the whole Truth concerning it.</P>
<P>Great Endeavours were used, That she might be brought unto a True Faith in the <HI>Blood</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the pardon of her <HI>Blood guiltiness</HI>; and it may be, none <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndeavou∣red

it more, than that Reverend man, Old Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> who Wrote several Sheets of pathetical Instructions to her, while She was in Prison. That Renowned Man, Old Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> also, did his part in endeavouring that she might be Re∣newed by Repentance; and Preached a Ser∣mon, on Ezek. 16.20, 21. <HI>Is this of thy Whore∣doms a small matter, That thou hast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my Chil∣dren?</HI> Whereof great Notice was taken.

<P>ON <HI>June</HI> 6. 1662.

<PB N="72" REF="000877_0072_0FAC95788C061060"/>
take occasion, to Read a Paper, which he had Received from the Malefactory then present in the Assembly. It was as followeth.</P>
<P><Q>I <HI>James Morgan,</HI> being Condemned to Dye, must needs own to the glory of God, that He is righteous, and that I have by my sins, provoked Him to destroy me before my time. I have been a great Sinner, guilty of Sabbath-breaking, of Lying, and of Uncleanness; but there are especially two Sins whereby I have offended the Great God; one is that Sin of Drunkenness, which has caused me to commit many other Sins; for when in Drink, I have been often guilty of Cursing and Swearing, and quarrelling, and striking others: But the Sin which lies most heavy upon my Conscience, is, that I have despised the Word of God, and many a time refused to hear it preached. For these things, I believe God has left me to that, which has brought me to a shameful and mi∣serable death. I do therefore beseech and warn all persons, young men especially, to take heed of these Sins, lest they provoke, the Lord to do to them as He has justly done by me. And for the further peace of my own Conscience, I think my self obliged to add this unto, my foregoing Confession, That <HI>I own the Sentence</HI> which the Honoured Court has <HI>pass'd upon me,</HI> to be exceeding just; inasmuch as
<PB N="73" REF="000877_0073_0FAC95792AB2BD88"/>
tho' I had no former Grudge and malice a∣gainst the man whom I have killed, yet) my Passion at the time of the Fact was so outra∣gious, as that it hurried me on to the doing of that which makes me justly now proceeded against as a Murderer.</Q></P>

The Jews of Old put him to a worse death than yours will be this afternoon; and by your con∣tempt of Christ you have said, the Jews did well to do so. How justly might he now laugh at your Calamity? And for these sins of yours, besides the direful woes and plagues that have already come upon you, you are now expos'd unto the Vengeance of eternal fire. You are in danger of being now quickly cast into those exquisite amazing Torments, in comparison of which, the anguishes which your body ever did feel, or shall feel before night, or can ever feel, are just nothing at all; and these dolorous tor∣ments are such as never have an End; as many sands as could lie between this earth and the Stars in Heaven would not be near so many as the Ages, the endless Ages of these Torments.</P>

<P>Yes, and its a wonderful thing that I have now further to tell you. Mind, I entreat you. The Son of God is become the Son of Man; the Lord Jesus Christ is both God &amp; Man in one Person, and he is both sufficiently able &amp; willing also, to be your Saviour. He lived a most righteous life, &amp; this was that such as you and I might be able to say before God, <HI>Lord, accept of me as if I had lived righteously.</HI> He dyed at length a most cursed death, and this was that we might be able to say unto God, <HI>Lord, let me not dye for Sin, since thy Son ha's dyed in my room.</HI>

<P><HI>Sir, my Case in short is This, I have laid my self at the Feet of the Lord Jesus Christ for my Salvation; and had it not been for His meer Grace and Help, I had never been able to do That.
