<P>WHereas, by Advice of His Majesties Council for this Province, upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Mayor of New-York, to remove a Grievance from the Inhabitants (the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t of Bread) occasioned by great Quantities thereof, and of Flower &amp; Corn exported to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>West-Indies</HI> and <HI>Boston,</HI> I did issue forth Proclamation, prohibiting the Exportation of Flower, B<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead and Corn until the first of <HI>August</HI> next ensuing. And whereas many and frequent Applications <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made to me for liberty to Export the same, to supply the Neighbouring Provinces, who are in grea<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> want thereof, I have therefore, by the said Mayor and Aldermen of the said City, got Informa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on of what Quantity of Grain, Meal and Bisket remains therein. And to the end our Neighbo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs may have what Supply may be reasonably spared. I have, with Advice of the Council, given <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Liberty to all Persons, to Export Flower, Bread and Corn for the space of eight days, and from thence-forth, saving o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y that the former Prohibition shall continue in force against the Exportation of Corneel and course Bisket, any thing in the said Proclamation (bearing date the 11th of <HI>June</HI> last) to the contrary in any wayes notwithstanding. And all Officers of his Majestes Custom-House, and others are Required to take Notice thereof accordingly.</P>
