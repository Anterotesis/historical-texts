<P>MY Brethren: now hear me a few words, stand fast all you people in your praying to God, according to that word of God 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16.13. <HI>Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men and be strong in the Lord.</HI> Especially you that are <HI>Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI>: Fear not the face of man, when you judg in a Court together, help one another, agree together: Be not divided one against another, remem∣ber the parable of ten brethren that held together, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y could not be broken, nor overcome: but when thay divided one against another, then thay were easyly overcome: and all you that are Rulers, judg right judgment, <HI>for you doe not judg for man, but for God in your Courts.</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19.6, 7. Therfore judg in the fear of God.</P>
<P>Again, You that are judges, see that ye have not only humane wisdom, for mans wisdom is in many things contrary to the wisdom, of God counting it to be foolishnesse. Doe not judg that right, which only seemeth to be tight, and con∣sider <HI>Matt.</HI> 7.1▪ 2. <HI>Judg right, and God will be with you, when you so d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</HI></P>

<P>Again Lastly I say to you <HI>Daniel</HI> our Minister be strong in your work. As <HI>Matt.</HI> 5.14.16. <HI>You must bring Light into the world, and make it to shine, that all may see your good work, and glorify your heavenly Father.</HI></P>
