Billing</HI> and <HI>Sam. Jenings</HI>; &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas there was a late <HI>difference</HI> depending between <HI>E. Bil∣linge</HI> on the one part, &amp; <HI>S. Jenings, Tho. Budd</HI> &amp; <HI>G H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tch∣inson,</HI> &amp; some of the Proprietors of the Province of <HI>West New-Jarsey</HI> on the other part, concerning the Government of that Province, which they did refer and submit to the Judgment &amp; Determination of <HI>G. Fox, G. Whitehead, W. Gibson, Alex. Parker, W Shewin, Ch. Bathurst, Ch. Marshall, T. Ellwood, R. Whitpane, J. Park, G Crisp, T. Hart, J Osgood</HI> &amp; <HI>W.

Mo. 1684. and by adjournments continued to the 11. of 8 Mo. following, and no longer doth appear. Now we whose Names are here-under written having duely weighed &amp; considered the matter in difference, upon a full hearing of both Parties concerned▪ face to face, do, according to our Consciences &amp; best understandings of matters of Fact &amp; of the several Complaints, Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egations &amp; Evidences produced, understand, advise, judge and determine as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>E. Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inge</HI> hath, by Concessions, signed by himself, with other words &amp; circumstances, as also by Letters written by <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en Laury, Nicholas Lucas &amp;c.</HI> to the Proprietors, given them ground to expect that they should have and had the Government, with the Soyl, which he not performing, gave offence, and we judge they were to blame, and not well advised; for it appears something du∣bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us whether <HI>E.

<PB N="3" REF="000822_0003_0FAB4012A766AB80"/>
not being mentioned in the Dukes Grant to the Lord <HI>Berckly</HI> &amp; Sir <HI>George Cartwright.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. We find no mention made in the Concessions of such mode of Government as that a Governour is to be chosen by the People, but mention of an Assembly and ten Commissioners. Neither can we find any warrantable foundation and legal Right either from the Kings Grant, or in the Conveyances to the particular Proprietors from E Billing, &amp;c to justifie them in electing their Governor, nor yet for a popular Government without a single Governor, or Com∣missioners particularly assigned by legal Authority, NB.</P>
<P N="3">3. That <HI>E. Billinge</HI> by the last Grant from the Duke hath the Title &amp; Power of Government legally in him, as also by the Kings own approbation in his Declaration and Letter to and in behalf of the said <HI>E. Billinge,</HI> &amp; he cannot be divested thereof but by default or by his own consent, as we really apprehend.</P>
<P N="4">4. That <HI>E. Billing</HI> (as we really conceive &amp; understand) cannot legally fell and divide the Government in pieces, parcells or piece-meals to particular Proprietors, if he part with it, it must go whole to a single Person, or to a certain number by Name who must, as a Corporation, have the whole of him, in whom it legally resideth, and that by an entire Grant or Assignment for the same purpose.</P>
<P N="5">5. That whereas <HI>S. Jenings</HI> &amp; the Assembly in <HI>West-Jarsey</HI> had positively acknowledged <HI>E. Billing</HI> as Governor, and acted about two years by virtue of his Commission &amp; Power, and <HI>S. Jenings</HI> as his Deputy engaging to serve him, and preserve his Interest in that Capacity; now after all this they accepting <HI>E. Billing</HI> as Governor <HI>only in Trust,</HI> as they alledge, in order to have him assign his Power and Government to the People, which not being obtained with his consent, <HI>then they rejecting him the said</HI> Billing, <HI>and chusing</HI> S. Jenings <HI>Governor in his stead, and his accepting thereof,</HI> W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>S A BETRAY∣ING HIS TRUST, as also rejecting <HI>W. Welch,</HI> since deputed by <HI>E. Billing,</HI> without giving <HI>E. Billing</HI> any previous Notice of these their designs and proceedings against him and his Interest, <HI>These we judge irregular Proceedings, Ʋnfair and Ʋnwarrantable, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp; worthy of Blame in</HI> S. Jenings <HI>and all Persons concerned therein.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="4" REF="000822_0004_0FAB4013682E8F60"/>6. That seeing <HI>E. Billing</HI> and those of his Trustees did give such ground of expectation as aforesaid, by Concessions and Letters, &amp; also by some words in some of their Deeds, that the Proprietors should or might have the Government or Power to elect a Gover∣nour among themselves, which if be cannot legally or safely per∣form according to their expectations, yet we all agree, that he is thereby bound to perform to the Proprietors, so far as he legally &amp; safely may do. And also we judge, that the said <HI>Billing</HI> ought to go so far as he is able, and lawfully can in all things to their just Satisfaction, by making and confirming unto them such Funda∣mental Laws, Concessions and Provisions, consonant, and not re∣pugnant to the Laws and Government of this Realm of <HI>England,</HI> as may fully secure them from all Abuses, Oppressions &amp; Encroach∣ments upon their Freedoms &amp; Liberties, both as Men &amp; Christians, by and from himself, his Heirs or Assigns, according to the Con∣tents of his own Letter, dated the 15 of 8. mo. 1680. sent with his last Grant from the Duke.</P>
<P N="7">7. That seeing <HI>E. Billing</HI> hath declared that he hath settled the Reversion of the Government upon his Son-in Law <HI>B. Barclet,</HI> our advice is, That he do procure his said Son-in-Law to sign, with himself, such fundamental Laws, Concessions &amp; Provisions, so made and confirmed as above▪ and also that the said <HI>Billinge</HI> do produce and shew his Concessions, so made, to any 30. more of those 14 Friends before named▪ to whom the aforesaid Difference was refer∣ed, and take their advice and consent thereunto▪ before they be transmitted to the Proprietors, there to be passed into an Act or Law in the General Assembly of <HI>West-Jarsey</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. That the said <HI>S. Jenings, T. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, G. Hutchison</HI> and the rest of the Proprietors concerned, &amp; residing in <HI>West-Jarsey,</HI> do at present renew and continue their due acknowledgment of <HI>Billing,</HI> and peaceably aquiese, and quietly and duly submit to his Authority and Power, as their legal Governour, and receive and accept of those things before mentioned from him, and to be content and satisfied there-with. All which being effectually performed by
<PB N="5" REF="000822_0005_0FAB401428321D88"/>
the said <HI>E. Billinge</HI> then the Proprietors to pay their proportions of the Charge of the last Grant.</P>
<P N="9">9. We finding that many Errors, Mistakes, Misapprehensions, Misacting, Faults, Trespasses and Offences have been suffered and done and committed since the first proposal of inhabiting &amp; plant∣ing the said Province, not only by <HI>E. Billing,</HI> but also by <HI>S. Jen∣ings</HI> and others, therefore we do advise and judge it needful that an Act of Indemnity and Oblivion be provided and passed by the first opportunity by <HI>E. Billing</HI> and the Assembly of <HI>West-Jarsey,</HI> and that the same be drawn so full and effectual that all Persons con∣cerned in the said Province may be secured from being called to account for any thing done or acted in relation to himself a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Go∣vernor or to the Government before the date hereof; and that likewise therein provision be made to enjoyn the Inhabitants and Proprietors of the said Province not to upbraid, traduce or defame the said <HI>Billing,</HI> nor he them for any fault, mistake or miscarriage done, in relation to the said Difference before the date of the said Act of Oblivion; and that the said <HI>Billing</HI> procure his Son-in-Law <HI>B. Bartlet</HI> to sign the same with himself.</P>
<P N="10">10. It is our Christian advice, That no party concerned in the aforesaid Difference make or cause to be made any S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ife or Con∣tention therein, whereby the Peace or Prosperity of the said Pro∣vince, or any Member thereof may be disquieted or hurt thereby, and that all Persons concerned forbear to disquiet or molest each other by going to Law, or any vexatious Suit or Prosecution in any Courts of Judicature for or because of the said Difference. This we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o solemnly leave in Charge on all Persons concerned, for the holy Truth and the Name of the Lords sake.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> We do in all sincerity and godly Care <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nestly intreat and beseech, as well as advise all Parties and Persons he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ein con∣cerned, That they sincerely and heartily in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and for his sake, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orgive one another as Christians, &amp; endeavour with one accord to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out and extinguish all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mosities, Prejudices, Heart-b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnings, Heats, Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Divisions, and so b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the very remembrance thereof, that

<HEAD>Observations on the fore going Award.</HEAD>
<P><HI>REader,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> observe, That by the fore-going Award of those eminent <HI>Quakers,</HI> the Government was in <HI>Billing,</HI> and not in the People of <HI>West-Jarsey,</HI> and <HI>S. Jenings</HI> condemned by them <HI>for Betraying his Trust,</HI> in laying aside <HI>Billing's</HI> Commission, and taking the Government on him from the People; yet notwithstanding all this, the same <HI>Sam. Jenings</HI> being the leading man of that Party, &amp; chief in the Assembly, now sings his old Song over again, and affirms the Government to be in the People, thereby en∣couraging and exciting the People to Rebellion against the present Gover∣nour, and other their lawful Rulers, to the great obstruction of the Peace and Prosperity of the Province.</P>
<P>Hence is is that <HI>P. Fretwell</HI> and <HI>T. Gardner</HI> (two of the said <HI>Jenings</HI>'s Minions and Quondam Justices) have run from County to County to stir up People to Sedition, and to oppose the holding of any Courts by the Gover∣nours Authority, and threa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on such as yeild Obedience thereunto.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="000822_0007_0FAB4207AF902D90"/>And hence they themselves are so perverse and stubborn as not to come to Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for their setting the Province in a flame, at the Court of Appeals, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and for other Misdemeanours, without raising Souldiers to force them along, to the end that they may send these their Suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rings to <HI>London</HI> also, to be recorded among the rest of their Lyes) as a suffering for Truth and Religion. And hence the said <HI>Fretwell,</HI> the former Treasurer, refuses to give Account to Authority what he has done with all the Money he has received of the Province, and County Taxes: No, for doubtless he finds it more profitable to continue his former method, <HI>viz.</HI> to give account to his Fellows, who applaud him to the People, but pass his Accounts unexamined.</P>
<P>And hence it is that our Sheriff and his Assistant, for doing their Office at <HI>Barlington,</HI> are by the said <HI>Gardiner</HI> arrested and shed at a Court in <HI>Pennsil∣vania,</HI> directly contrary to the Laws and Liberties of our English Nation, and a notorious Violation of our antient Priviledges.</P>
<P>And from hence some others have been encouraged to resist the Govern∣ment lately at <HI>Salem,</HI> where some <HI>Quakers</HI> also assumed the Militia by beat of Dru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> &amp; Colours flying, and with Whips, Clubs and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>taves they forced off the Magistrates from the Court house, not suffering them to keep Court (thereby stopping the currant of Justice) till the Governour went with a Force of fifty Men in Arms, who by the Providence of God, and the said Governours discreet management, broke thorow, and que<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d the Rabble, without Blood-shed, even beyond the expectation of all concerned, the Captain of these Rioters having prepared his Gun with a Charge of thirty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eight small Bullets.</P>
<P>But all this seemed little in the Eyes of <HI>S. Jenings,</HI> therefore that he might more effectually accomplish his seditious Designs to subvert the Govern∣ment, he and his <HI>Quaker</HI>-Followers held a great Meeting, as private as they could, about <HI>December</HI> last, at the said <HI>Jenings</HI>'s Plantation House, which Meeting was appointed for his said Followers to draw up a Writing against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Governour and Government, to send to <HI>England</HI>; but when the said People met, they found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> said Writing ready contrived &amp; drawn to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ands, which, when 'twas read, a person was appointed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o set every mans Name thereunto the said <HI>Jenings</HI> having before threatned the Governour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his face to throw him out of the Government, &amp; therefore he [<HI>Quaker</HI>-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>] uses such landesti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e ways to get others to authorize his Plots, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t may be seen in <HI>England,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 'tis not he, but the People that does it; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll this must be for the Propagation of their Truth, yea, endeavours of Ruin to their peaceable Neighbours, nay, Province and all shall lie at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather than this man to want his Will.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="000822_0008_0FAB42086CBDE738"/>No wonder therefore that he and his Faction in the General Assembly re∣fuses to sign the Association of Fidelity to King <HI>William</HI> he being so great a <HI>Jacobite</HI> that he covenants with those to whom he sells h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Land, in their Deeds, to pay their Quit-Rents to the late King <HI>James,</HI> a known Enemy to the Kingdom; this all who please may see recorded in the Registers Office at <HI>Burlington.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis he that has got away the Book of the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ws of the Province (as his Friend <HI>H. Grubb</HI> informs us) and conceals it from the present Government, (for he had rather the Province should be without Laws than not to have them of his own making) but God be thanked he cannot conceal the Laws of <HI>England</HI> from us; but perhaps he conceals it for f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r of loosing their great Fundamental Law therein recorded, made wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the said <HI>Jenings</HI> was Governour, <HI>viz. That the Governour for the time being shall sign all Acts whatsoever the Representatives, from time to time, please to enact.</HI> This is the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st-Jarsey,</HI> made to out do t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t other <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of <HI>England</HI>: What think ye Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s! were not these men wiser than our English Legislators? Was not <HI>Cato</HI> of old inferiour to this Man? for they were but People of the World, but the <HI>Quakers</HI> say, They are the <HI>Only People of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>lastly,</HI> it is not to be doubted but when a Committee of both Houses did debate <HI>S. Jenings</HI> and his party's Pretentions to the Government, at the Assembly held in <HI>November,</HI> 1697. It did inspire great boldness to <HI>Jenings</HI> &amp; his Faction to proceed as they have done, that the then Governor <HI>Hamilton</HI> did plead so stifly for them and their pretended Right, and had not one word to offer on the behalf of the Society, for which his zeal on their account, and against the Society, they honestly answered his expectation with a Present of 200 <HI>l.</HI> I say, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> took great boldness, who being greedy of engrosing the whole Rule of the Province to themselves, they had not only outed every Justice in the County of <HI>Burlington,</HI> except their own faction of <HI>Quakers,</HI> but also they had turned out the Council from being Justices, <HI>ex officio,</HI> so that none but Illiterate and otherways Un∣qualified Persons bore Rule, the ill Effects whereof the Province in divers respects has and yet does groan under, as may in time be further manifested.</P>
<P>But to conclude, I leave these things to be considered, and whether there be not now need of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tia in the Province to secure our Lives &amp; Estates, left by the leading <HI>Quakers</HI> crying out against the Government, as no Go∣vernment, the Mob here and Scum of <HI>England,</HI> transported to these Plan∣tations, should jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to Ravage and Ruin both us and them? And 'tis seen already what Robberies have been lately committed by Pyrates at the lower parts of <HI>Delaware,</HI> for want of being opposed by Force, notwithstanding the <HI>Quakers</HI> boasting of their Trust in divine Providence to restrain <HI>evil Men.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Annimadversions upon the <HI>Quakers</HI> Award, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Pen'd under the direction and guidance of this godly Instruction and Caution, <HI>viz.</HI> He that justifieth the Wicked, and he that condemneth the Just, even they both are Abomination to the Lord, <HI>Prov. 17 15.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Impartial Reader;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MAny remarkable Observations the fore-going Award will offer to thy discreet and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>genious Consideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. That tho' the most antient and eminent Professors of the <HI>Quakers</HI> Communion, and their great Patriarch <HI>GEORGE FOX</HI> himself (who first gave birth and existence to that New Sect) were chosen Arbitrators by the mutual Consent and Agreement of the controverting Parties, all Disciples or Proselites of the said <HI>FOX,</HI> yet because they drew up an Award which did not in all points suit the haughty Genius and ambitious Pretensions of <HI>Samuell Jenings,</HI> he did not scrupled spensing with his <HI>Quakerism,</HI> utterly to reject it as Unjust, and by his Example others also, whom he headed and govern'd, and who could not, or d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st not see but with his Eyes, tho' they had bound themselves by a Writing under their hands (as is decl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d in the Award) to submit to the Judgment and Arbitrement of these venerable Friends, headed by their first Apostle, and the great Architect and President of their Society▪</P>
<P N="2">2. Which Proceedings do evince, how far such Persons are worthy to be credited, and what Confidence may reasonably be repos'd in them in other matters, whom neither so solemn a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ye▪ a Writing under their hands, nor the Authority of such Persons, could bind to their Promises, or engage a Conto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mity to their own free and spontaneous Act, and the Obligation they had voluntarily assum'd. Tho' this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame <HI>FOX,</HI> and others concern'd with him in this Arbitration, are the Men, whom, on other occasions (where Interest is not concern'd) for the reputation and support of their Party, they represent as <HI>Holy</HI> and <HI>Righteous,</HI> and would perswade the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld to reverence them as such, and accordingly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>each them up as the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngers of Truth, and not in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>iour to any of the holy Apostles.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That <HI>Sam. Jenings</HI> by his Non-acquiescence to their Decision doth draw great S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andal &amp; Disgrace upon himself and them. For, if <HI>Samuell</HI> should be ask't, Why <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e doth refuse to submit to their Determination? his answer could be no other, but that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se just Men had done Ʋnjustly,</HI> &amp;
<PB N="10" REF="000822_0010_0FAB4209ECBF0078"/>
that the Spirit of Iniquity had got the Ascendant over these Saints, so that their Understandings thereby were darkened and eclipsed, and their Wills also rendered partial, and averse to the Cause he had undertaken to main∣tain, and in vain was brought before them. And if, on the other hand, the Arbitrators should be interrogated, Why <HI>Samuell</HI> would not obey their Order and Determination, &amp; his own Engagement to conform according∣ly? What could they Reply, but <HI>That the Spirit of Pride</HI> (which had been a Lyar and a Rebel from the beginning) <HI>had subdued his Conscience to Oppose Gods Ordinance, and to confederate with him against them and the Truth, by whose Inspiration and Guidance they had pen'd that Award?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. So that by <HI>Sam. Jening<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s</HI> own Testimony, &amp; Theirs also whose Senses have been perverted to link themselves with him, <HI>G. FOX, G. Whitehead, S Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sp,</HI> and the rest of the Arbitrators, did not act according to Justice and Truth in this matter, nor <HI>Samuell</HI> and his Party by theirs; and conse∣quently by the Reciprocal Evidence of these Men against each other, none of them are <HI>Righteous, Perfect</HI> or <HI>Infallible,</HI> as they hold forth to others, and preach themselves to be. But <HI>Samuell</HI> must be content to knock under, and not pretend to stand in Competition, in point of Veracity, with these Arbi∣trators; for in the true Spirit of <HI>Quakerism,</HI> neither their <HI>Light</HI> nor <HI>Inte∣grity</HI> is to be disputed or called in question; since they were Men, that by the common Testimony of the whole Body, and the essentials of their own Creed, were illuminated and govern'd by the Spirit of Truth, and were taught all things (as formerly the Apostles of Christ) by the powerful Irradiation of its Light within them. By their very Fundamentals there∣fore, their Decision of the Controversie is Evidence sufficient to convince, that they understood it, &amp; consequently understood what they did there∣in, and ought to be done, in point of Justice, on the behalf of each party. If then Justice was equally distributed by them in this Award which can∣not be deny'd b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a <HI>Quaker,</HI> if he'll be true to, and not revolt from his Prin∣ciples) why did <HI>Samuell</HI> refuse to comply with it? And if <HI>Samuell,</HI> &amp; those under his Government, who pin'd their judgment on his Sleeve, had been men of common Probity, how could they have sham'd their Promise, and strain'd such a Case? a case so remarkable, so circumstantiated, to defeat so solemn an Obligation, to the disgrace of themselves, and the Pillars of their Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>?</P>
<P N="5">5 That even those moral Precepts enjoyn'd both Parties by these Arbi∣trators, as their Christian Dut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>Not to malign, not to Revile or Back bite each other,</HI> have been rejected by <HI>Samuell</HI> and his Accomplices, as Anti∣christian, even to this day; so that the Grave doth not yet defend <HI>Byllinge</HI> against their Slanders, nor the Authority of those antient select Friends (to
<PB N="11" REF="000822_0011_0FAB420AAD20C7B8"/>
whose Decision <HI>Jenings</HI> and his Adherents subjected their Cause and Contro∣ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> against their Rebellion. But they still as hotly inveigh against <HI>Billing,</HI> and as fiercely appear and concern themselves against that Power and Government, in whom it is now legally and rightfully invested, as formerly when it was lodged in <HI>Billing</HI>'s Person, before they consented and submitted to this Arbitration. And at this very present, this great Cham∣pion against <HI>Billing</HI> and this Award doth act this part so strenuously, and with such success, as to draw great Numbers after him in his Rebellion, and with such a stubborn Refractoriness as to tell the present Governeur to his face, <HI>He neither liked him nor his Commission</HI>; did therefore from thenceforth denounce perpetual Hostility against him, <HI>and should not cease to make War upon him untill he had driven him out of the Government.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. That not only <HI>Sam. Jenings,</HI> but whosoever beside combine with him to oppose the Governours Commission and Authority, oppose the Judgment of <HI>G. FOX,</HI> and the rest of the Arbitrators named in this Award, and con∣sequently the Judgment of the most antient Friends and principal Rulers of the whole Body, and censure them and it as Unjust &amp; Unworthy of their Regard. So that whilst they strive against the Government, they also strive to sully the good Name of these eminent Friends, and cast such a Reproach upon their Memories &amp; Reputation, as must inevitably form a bad Impres∣sion of them in others, &amp; will at once cancel their Pretensions to those high Dispensations which they claim and proclaim as peculiar to themselves, and were never before communicated to any other Name, Order or Society of Christian Professors.</P>
<P N="7">7. It cannot therefore but highly concern the People of <HI>West-New-Jarsey</HI> to consider whether it is not more just and safe to obey the Determination and Judgment of these antient Friends, than the bold seditious Notions of that Person, whom those Friends, in the Spirit of Truth (as all <HI>Quakers</HI> are obliged to believe, unless they will renounce Unity with their Friends and consistency with themselves) have stigmatiz'd with the infamous Character of <HI>Betraying his Trust,</HI> declaring, that hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Proceedings, and theirs also that did appear with him against <HI>Billing</HI>'s Authority (whom they did publish, testifie and recognize to be his and their lawful Governor) were <HI>Ʋnfair, Ʋnwarrantable, Ʋnsafe and worthy of Blame.</HI> And it is an indelible stain on the <HI>Quakers</HI> of <HI>West-Jarsey,</HI> that those who are not of the <HI>Quakers</HI> Profession in that Province conform themselves to the Award of these antient Friends, and religiously observe the good Advice therein incerted and urged, and those that profess themselves <HI>Quakers</HI> generally abhor, and spu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n against it, as if it were the Dictates of some Profligate Wretches, or the Resolution
<PB N="12" REF="000822_0012_0FAB420B6D881120"/>
and Sentiments of the <HI>Sons of B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lial,</HI> and not the conscientious Judgment and impartial Decree of honest Men?</P>
<P N="8">8. Nor can it be any Excuse for <HI>Sam. Jenings,</HI> and others (who are, and long have been active by his Motion, as the great Wheel to seduce and be∣tray the People into Sedition) that they have gain'd a Multitude to appear on their side against the present Governor and Government. The Success of this Agency will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xtenuate, but on the contrary aggravate both their Shame and Offence. For who are they, whose Judgments are debauched thereby? are they not generally professed <HI>Quakers?</HI> And what are the Fruits thereof? What doth such a N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ation operat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Peoples Disturbance, the Violation of the publick Peace, the Obstruction of Justice, and endles-Distractions, Ann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ties &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> among all Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es, and in a word, the <HI>Destruction of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Province?</HI> And as it shews their Power with the People, so their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Power, and how pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>niciou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and danger∣ous such Seditious, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Spirits are in any Government, in whose Breasts appears to be lodged a large Seminary of Contentions, Sedition, Factions and Hostilities, to use <HI>Samuell</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s own Term?</P>
<P N="9">9. Nor can this Plea or pretention be any Justification or Warrantee for their Proceedings, <HI>That the present Governour is not approved of by his Majesty, according to the Prescription and Tenor of the late Act of Parliament.</HI> This Argument will recoil upon themselves, and against the late Governour, and make him no Governour after the 25th day of <HI>March</HI>▪ 1697. and conse∣quently all Publick and Provincial Acts illegal, void, unwarrantable and dangerous after that time, especially since he did not so much for his War∣rantee to hold the Government after the Limitation exol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, as to obtain a <HI>Dedimus Potestatem</HI> to take the Oath, tho' so precisely and pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emprorily commanded by that Act. Which therefore neither was nor could be legally taken by or administred to him, according to the manner and direction, as thereby enjoyn'd.

could not but own to be legal &amp; plena<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and therefore yeilded Obedience to it, and went off, as superceded by it, which was about 15 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> after the time limitted by the Act, and were also so hot and z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s then to main∣tain his Authority (notwithstanding the above Defect, contrary to the Law) that they would not have fail'd to oppose any, that on pretence thereof should have call'd it in question.</P>
<P N="12">12. The present Governor brings over a <HI>Dedimus Forestatem</HI> under the broad Seal of <HI>England,</HI> takes the Oath, as prescribed by the Law. The Time, the Place, the Concourse of Spectators and Auditors made this Act so publick that it could not, that it cannot be deny'd by them. Nevertheless because he did not bring such Vouchers of his Majesties approbation as they could not except against (which was impossible, unless for this also he could have brought the broad Seal of <HI>England</HI> to answer their Quibbles &amp; Cavils, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>' he brought such assurances thereof (as was instanced before) as might have satisfied any reasonable unprepossessed Persons) they resist him as an illegal Usurper, and deny that his Commission ought to be received. So the late Governour, tho' he fail'd in both those Preliminaries required by the Act, was still notwithstanding own'd by them as the legal Governor of the Province, and the present Governor that in reality fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls in neither, and by them is supposed &amp; charged but to fail in one, is deny'd to be so for that precise Reason. And the Opposition they make against him hath such a leven and tincture of a Perverse Spirit in it, that they will tollerate any Mischief to be committed in the Province, rather than do any thing to redress, punish or prevent it, whereby it may be imply'd that they own the Governour, or in the least submit to his Administration. Cannot therefore by Subpaena's or any Inducements be compelled or prevail'd with to give Evidence at the Courts in any Causes either Civil or Criminal, or to per∣form any Services there.</P>
<P N="13">13. And tho' (as before recited) 'tis expresly enacted by the said Act, <HI>That all who shall be made Governors or Commanders in Chief of any of his Ma∣jesties Collonies or Plantations, shall take the Oath therein prescribed; and such as are not immediately Commissionated by his Majesty, shall not only take the same Oath, but also be approved of by his Majesty, before their enterance into their Go∣vernment. And if any of the said Governors or Commanders in Chief be convicted of failure, or to have made default in either of the Premises, by the Oath of two or more credible Witnesses, before his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, or such as he or they shall authorize and appoint, he shall be removed from his Government, &amp; forfeit the sum of One Thousand Pounds Sterling.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. Tho' the Act thus prescribes, yet the <HI>Quakers</HI> of <HI>West-Jarsey</HI> doubt not to confederate against this Authority, and as Patriots of the Province
<PB N="15" REF="000822_0015_0FAB420F0890AC38"/>
and Champions for the Publick (which Opinion they deceitfully insinuate into the credulous and simple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> boldly oppugne it. So they will not have the Governor removed from his Government, but kept out of it. Not to incur the Penalties for entering before the said Oath taken, and Approba∣tion obtained, but not to enter at all, nor consequently be liable to any F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>feitures. Nor to be convicted by the Oath of two, or more credible Witnesses, nor before his Majesty, but Themselves will be Judges, Wit∣nesses and Accusers also in this Controversie. And tho' the Act gives the Appelation and Character of Governor to all such as have received a Com∣mission for Government, tho' suppos'd to have fail'd in those Performances appointed by the Act, and to have made themselves obnoxious to the Penal∣ties thereby enjoyn'd, Yet these <HI>Confederate Friends</HI> disallow it, as a Title of Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ererogation, and both by their Words and Comportment censure it as an <HI>Ʋnreasonable, Erronious,</HI> and an <HI>Ʋnwarrantable Complement.</HI></P>
