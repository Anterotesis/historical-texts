<P>The Governours Answer was truly Christian▪ to this effect, viz. that the Narrative conteined a vindication of many excellent Truths of Christ Iesus; and therefore, the particulars concern my self, to which I humbly (before God Angels and men) say as followeth.</P>
<P>First, Mr. <HI>Coddington</HI> goes on in the same bruitish Tract that <HI>Fox</HI> and most of them run in, viz a simple kind of reviling▪ viz. Lyes Lyes, Slaunders, Slaunders, (like poor Children and Scolds <HI>&amp;c</HI>:) Thus most notoriously, doth <HI>G. Fox</HI> conclude most of his Answers to so many heavenly Pens in his Folio books, <HI>viz.</HI> [And as to the rest of thy Lyes and Slanders they are not worth the mentioning] And thus deals Mr. <HI>Coddington</HI> (childishly and clamorously) against me thus clamoring, <HI>viz.</HI> a most slanderous lying book, a bundle of lyes, a book full of lyes: horrible impudence! to invent so many lyes and present them to the K. of <HI>England,</HI> (good manners would have taught him to have said at least our Royal Soveraign, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) And except he had sold himself to do wickedly he had never uttered so many abominable lyes.</P>
<P>To these in general I Answer, what sober soul (not intoxicate with the bloody Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Whore of <HI>Rome</HI> who is drunk with the blood of Saints) but will proclaim that oftentimes the whore like <HI>Potiphars</HI> wise cryes out whore first! though the accused <HI>Joseph</HI> will be found heavenly chast, from these whorish Lights and worship, which will be found (with their worshippers) all the world over in Gods most holy season but Children of the <HI>Father of lyes</HI> the Devil.</P>
<P>But to particulars, he saith it is a lye, that I said that <HI>G. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> slily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, when saith he, he was never present, I say, who ever reads
<PB REF="039211_0003_1013F8826C154358"/>
this, will see (especially in my Narrative) that <HI>G. F.</HI> by Letters, by Relations, by Copies of my fourteen proposals, knew all matters per∣fectly, and they kept my Letters sent to the Dep. Governour <HI>Cra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ston,</HI> (in which Letters my fourteen Proposals to <HI>G. F.</HI> were) as the Deputy openly testified until <HI>G. F.</HI> was two or three hours under Sail, that it might be said, that <HI>G. F.</HI> never saw the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I sent of my fourteen Proposals to him. This business o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>G. F.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fectly informed of my offer of dispute on those fourteen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roposals and of his deliberate withdrawing (or running) is for apparent (as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made clear in my Narrative) that he that shall deny <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> most de¦ny that he himself hath any breath or life, or is a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>
<P N="2">2 Mr. <HI>Coddington</HI> saith that the first day of our dispute at <HI>New∣port</HI> was spent in examining whether any would subscribe to my four∣teen Positions, but they were found so gross that none would sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scribe to them.</P>
<P>But why doth Mr. <HI>Coddington</HI> forget these two things, First, that the first day was spent (mainly and chiefly after some preparations) in the examination of a true and false Quaker as appears in my Nar∣rative. 2. (and consequently) that many spake as my brother <HI>Ro∣bert Williams, Thomas Ward, Richard Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, William Hichcock,</HI> a∣gainst the monopolizing of Civil and Christian Liberty, <HI>viz.</HI> that none should speak to any point except they would subscribe to my fourteen propositions.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Coddington</HI> saith that these propositions were so gross that none would subscribe to them.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> What then? if I never offered them to any one Soul to subscribe to them?</P>
<P N="2">2. If they were so sudden so strange, and high, and unexpected, that my brother (as it is in print) thought I charged too deep <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But 3. What were my charges to this that Spanish Inquisition that none must speak or object, or query, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cept he subscribe to my pro∣posals? doth not this justifie the <HI>Popish,</HI> and <HI>Episcopal</HI> subscriptions, and proclaim that the Papists and <HI>Foxians</HI> are all one in their snares and Engines of subscription, which my brother <HI>Robert Williams</HI> in his Lette<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> proves from some propositions of the Bishops at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> shewing more moderation then pretended Quakers at <HI>Rhode Island.</HI></P>
<P>The third Lye Mr. <HI>Coddington</HI> fastens on me is that I should ac∣knowledge that <HI>John Burnet</HI> spake in his publick speech or Sermon) many excellent Truths of God, and that afterwards I denyed them.</P>
<P>This Charge hath reference (or may) to twelve distinct times and

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne to their General Assembly were I spake sol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mnly that <HI>John Burnet</HI> had spoke many holy Truths of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> also proposed many Queries whether their Spirit was the true <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> God by which they spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e then and whether their Christ was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Lord Jesus Christ? which shews my approbation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, but also my witness against their false application of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had gone on in pressing those Queries had not the pray∣ers of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Governours wife, and the singing of <HI>Henry Nic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ols,</HI> and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and dissolving of the meeting by <HI>John Burnet,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> proceedings.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> me off from their general meeting I resolved (by Gods help) to assault this Camp of Anti-Christian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to wit by off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng to <HI>G.

In this dispute <HI>Wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iam</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fell upon (con∣trary to the order of an equal dispute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a large Sermon of speech to the people, of about an hour long. <HI>John Stubs</HI> followed him▪ and afterward <HI>John Burnet,</HI> who spake best as to Repentance, in general, and turning unto God, and yet I said, although he had delivered ma∣ny heavenly general Truths: yet he had said no more then he might have said before the Pope and the Cardinals in the Popes Chappel at <HI>Rome,</HI> whereas if matters come to be examined what true Repen∣tance and Faith is▪ it will then be seen what the holy Truth of God is, and what the destroying juglings and Lyes of Satan are.</P>
<P N="4">4 Mr. <HI>Coddingtons</HI> fourth particular Charge against me is, that I lyed in saying that the first day of our dispute at <HI>Newport</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Eclipse of the Sun which I applied to the <HI>Foxians</HI> Eclipsing the Sun of Righteousness, and to his glorious breaking forth in his primitive and Eternal Truth at last, I know not the meaning or sense of this Lye charged on me▪ for he confesseth there was an Eclipse) as I af∣firm) only he saith there was a Thunder before it (which who de¦nyes?) Only Mr. <HI>Coddingtons</HI> Application▪ in opposition to mine) Let every Soul judge in the presence of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> who hath and will decide the Difference to Eternity.</P>
<P>A fifth Lye charged on me is, that as I abused <HI>G. F.</HI> so I abused the Original which <HI>John Stub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> (in effect) reproved me in, and I ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>knowledged my errour.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I do not think that <HI>John Stub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> (I hear gone to the pit of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and I am going) would have said so much: For the ninth of <HI>Isai▪</HI> which he quoted to prove that Christ was God, (which I no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no true Protestant denies) I perceived was quoted in der<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gation to

his true Manhood, (which was then in Agitation:) and therefor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> though I granted that Christ Jesus was an <HI>Everlasting Father</HI> (as he was God) yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> alleadged the thoughts of many excellent, holy, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> learned men, that the word <HI>Everlasting Father</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the He∣brew [<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>] did but s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnifie <HI>Pater <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>culi</HI> the Father of an Age or Ages signifying the propagation of and Succession of true Belie∣vers or followers of Jesus to the worlds end.</P>

<P>My sixth Lye is, that I denyed that <HI>Moses</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>John S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> produced <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.</P>
<P>I say it is not rational, that I should deny <HI>Moses,</HI> or <HI>David,</HI> or <HI>Ha∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>akk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks,</HI> or <HI>Daniels</HI> trembling only I denyed that the Quakers trem∣bling now in question is such a Quaking as theirs was, but is only an external and notoriously cheating, Quaking, instead of true Christi∣an trembling.</P>
<P>Unto these he addeth a Story, that <HI>Anthony Cook</HI> came to <HI>Provi∣dence</HI> to dispute with me but that I waved him and said, come let us gather Apples; The truth is, it is a silly and ridiculous passage, for it pleasing God to burn and break to pieces Mr. <HI>Scots</HI> house and Fence, (who was the great entertainer of the Quakers against his wives Conscience, no small persecution, though one of them formerly and a sufferer) my Lot being next, was open to all spoyle by Rea∣son of Mr. <HI>Scots</HI> defect: the Governour <HI>Clerk</HI> in Mr. <HI>Scots</HI> name a∣greed with me to make up all the Fences, and look to the Orchard, and gather the fruit, and to have the half, I did so, and the Gover∣nour coming to Town with Mr. <HI>John Easton, Christopher Hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sworth,</HI> Mr. <HI>Joseph Bria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and others coming into the Orchard and gather∣ing what they pleased: My self and my Indian were intent and care∣ful to gather Apples (what I could in hast) for Governour <HI>Clerk</HI> (who requested me <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) going away speedily, amongst others whom I knew, a stranger<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it seems one <HI>Arthur Cook</HI> asked me why I would write a book against innocent people called Quakers, I re∣member <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said to this purpose that every body was a Christian, eve∣ry body was Innocent in their own eyes, and it is possible I might say to my Indian, let us gather, or make haste but that I should avoid dispute with <HI>Arthur Cook,</HI> or all of them (in season or out of sea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on) is not to be imagined, considering what I have done already,
<PB REF="039211_0006_1013F8884E949AE0"/>
and what (through the help of the true Lord Jesus) I resolve to do while I have breath to draw or a pen and hand to handle it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mr. <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ddington</HI> saith <HI>Roger Williams</HI> his hands are bound, but he persecuted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Tongue▪ <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P N="3">3. Mr. <HI>Coddington</HI> saith that he hath the Word of two Majors in this Country the one of <HI>Major Winslow</HI> now Governour of <HI>Plymouth</HI> Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ony, who saith▪ Mr. <HI>Coddington</HI> after he had heard <HI>Iohn Burnet</HI> speak at or about <HI>Marsfield,</HI> he said, he had never heard so much of the Gospel in all his life: the second is of <HI>Major Cra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ston</HI> Dep. Go∣vernour of <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> &amp;c. who said after our disputations (as Mr. <HI>Coddington</HI> saith) that he was glad he heard so much, and he was satisfied: To which I say, what is this to the Truth? if all the Majors and Governours, Princes, Kings and Emperors of the world agree upon an Opinion, Verdict, Sentence, or Decree, may not <HI>Pete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> a poor Fisherman, and <HI>Paul</HI> a poor Tent-maker overturn them all? yea, a poor lad or Handmaid bringing one holy Scripture for evi∣dence?</P>
<P>But 2. I have many Arguments to perswade me that both the Go∣vernour <HI>Winslow</HI> &amp; Dep.

<P>I have humbly (in the presence of the Eternal, All-seeing Eye) presented my Apology for my self against Mr. <HI>Coddingtons</HI> charges of Lyes, Lyes, Slaunders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I end with a few questions friendly pro∣pounded to Mr. <HI>Coddington.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Will he deny what his Eyes and Ears have seen and heard in this business I Hath he not seen me (I know by the power of Christ Iesus whose is all power in Heaven and Earth a poor old Creature stand up alone against them all together in the flourishing of their Teachers and Professions of Earthly power about them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>I will not mention particulars at <HI>Portsmouth</HI> &amp; <HI>Newport,</HI> of which I have told him as I had opportunity, but I will only remember him of some Covetous and Unchristian passages during the late bloody <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> amongst us, and his high profession of a Quaker,</P>
<P N="1">1. A considerable company of <HI>Providence</HI> people fled to <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> their Houses here, their Forts, their Fences burnt up, and much if not most of their Cattel destroyed: they obteined leave of the Government at <HI>Newport</HI> to inclose a piece of the Common to get Corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They inclo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and sent two men (thought to be ac∣ceptable with Mr. <HI>Coddington</HI>) to pray his favour to make use of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me of his windf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Trees (which lay by them) for two gates▪ (that all might pass throu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) But Mr. <HI>Coddington</HI> (who had never had a foot on <HI>Rhode Island</HI> but by one man of <HI>Providence</HI> his means) now a¦bounding with Land and Trees, turns these poor <HI>Providence</HI> distres¦sed Souls off with a denyal, <HI>viz</HI> except they would gratify his world∣ly selfish ends and conditions, which their grieved Souls (cosider∣ing the most unseasonable Covetousness of them) turned away with grief, and made some other shifts which God provided for them:</P>
<P N="2">2. Again, when <HI>Providence</HI> men had broken up the Land, and planted the first year, and hoped to reap a second Crop [which we all know to be the better] Mr. <HI>Coddington</HI> for his own private end shewed himself a Mole-rooting in the Earth, and would not give way to it.</P>
<P N="3">3. I could name many Instances of elder and later date: One I will further particularize: A poor man came to Mr. <HI>Coddington</HI> in these late bloody distresses, and offers to buy a <HI>Bushel</HI> of Corn for his poor Wife and Children in great want, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Mr. <HI>Coddington</HI> though abounding, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> would not let this poor Soul have a <HI>Bushel,</HI> except he would pay him a weeks work for it, which it is said the poor man was forced to give him.
