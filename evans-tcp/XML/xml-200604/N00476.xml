<HEAD>The Christian Faith of the People of God called Quakers, Vindicated from the Calumnies of Christian Lodowick.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas <HI>Christian Lodowick</HI> hath given forth several Paper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Challenging all these belonging to <HI>Newport</HI> Meeting, who speak in the Meetings of the People called <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> and that within these few days past he hath renewed his Challenge, accusing the <HI>Foundation of their Gospel, Faith, Doctrine and Religion, to be unscriptural, false and naught, shaken and Sandy,</HI> and challanging them to appoint one of their Number to disput<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with him.</P>
<P>These are to give Notice to all sober People and Neighbours, that: these so challenged by him, having taken his Challenge into consideration, and finding many things in it falsly and perversly stated, which they could not own, (so stated by him) to be the Foundation of their Faith, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> did meet with him at the House of <HI>Walter Clark</HI> in <HI>Newport</HI> in <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> the 18<HI>th</HI> of the 4<HI>th</HI> Month, 1691. in order to have things fairly stated, that if any did dispute with him, they might know before hand, what he was to dispute against, but they could not procure him to allow of this; but after that some of the things, charged by him in his Papers, began to be discoursed of, in order to a fair and right stating of them, he would not hear of it, but went away.</P>
<P>And whereas divers of us challenged by him, declared sincerely before many People there assembled on the said day, their sincere Faith as concerning the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth,</HI> and what the holy Scriptures testifie of him, yet he did continue to accuse them still, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Denying the True Christ,</HI> alledging, <HI>they had another Sence than the Scripture words did hear, and that his Sence was True, but their Sence was False, appealing to their Consciences whether it was not so:</HI> Thus making himself Judge over our secret Thoughts, as having a secret sence in our Thoughts of Scripture words, con∣trary

And we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so believe, according to holy Scripture, that Christs Body that was crucified on the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of the Cross, was raised again on the third day, and after forty dayes did ascend into Heaven in the light of the Disciples, and who is exalted at the right Hand of God, and ever liveth to make Intercession for us, and that Christ hath his Body in Heaven a most glorious Body, not charged in Being or Substance, but in Condition &amp; Manner of being; and that Christ is true and perfect God, and true and perfect Man, the Son of God, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gotten of God from Everlasting, glorified with the Father before the World began, and also begotten of God in the Womb of the Virgin, called <HI>Mary,</HI> and born of her in the fullness of time, the Son of <HI>Abra∣ham,</HI> the Son of <HI>David,</HI> who took not on him the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and which he still hath; and that Christ, as Man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Soul and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ody, and his Manhood i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most excellently and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> United with his God end, yet his Manhood is not his Gounead, not is his Body that he had of the Virgin, and now hath in Heaven, his Godhead, but the Temple of it, as Christ ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed his body the Temple, and is the Garment or Cloathing wherewith the Eternal Word did cloa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he himself, who i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that New and living Way that he hath consecrated for us, through the Vail, that is to say his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>And we believe, That <HI>G</HI>od the Father hath appointed the

Man Christ Jesus to be the Judge of the Quick and the Dead, and that he is to come to Judge all Mankind, and that his Coming so to Judge all Mankind with the great and last Judgment is at the end of the World, the which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd of the World we do believe is not come, either within us or without us, as he doth fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly charge; for the End of the World, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Scripture declareth, it is the end of the Ages or Times of this World; for the Times and Ages of this World shall have an End; and God hath ap∣pointed a Day wherein he will judge the World in Righteousness by that Man Christ Jesus, whom he hath ordained, but of that Day and Hour knoweth no Man, as Christ hath declared, that all might be watchful.</P>
<P>And because, according to Scripture Testimony, we do faith∣fully believe, that Christ hath also inwardly and spiritually ap∣peared in the Hearts of men, and that all true Christians do believe and own his inward Appearance and Revelation in them, as he is the Word, Light and Life in them, in various Measures and Degrees of divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>tion, and that he is the true Light that ligh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth every man that cometh into the World, and that we Testifie that all should turn to his Light in them, that convinceth of sin, and should believe in it, and obey and follow it, and that all who so do, will be led in due time to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>eve in him in whom the Fullness is, and to receive the benefit of Christs Death and Resurrection in the outward, therefore hath this Accuser joyned with <HI>Thomas Hicks, a Baptist</HI> Teacher at <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>John Falao,</HI> an <HI>Independent</HI> Teacher, and divers others, to accuse us, as <HI>Deny∣ing the True Christ,</HI> be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e we believe and confess to Christ's inward and Outward Coming and Appearance, as if to believe and co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss to Christ's Inward Coming and Appearance, were to deny his Outward, or to hold forth two Christs, which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but their great Ignorance and Unbelief, and no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of our Principle for the true Christ of God is One, and the true Christians Faith, receiveth and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him whole and undivided, and own<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> his inward and outward Coming, who, as he did come without u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a state of Humiliation to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and is risen and ascended into Heaven, so he will come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Judge the Quick and the Dead, and all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d before him, the Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>p on his Right Hand, and the Goats on his Left.

under the Law, and whereof it was a Tipe: And this first Mini∣stration of the Law and Light in them, (that answereth to <HI>Moses</HI> and the Prophets, and to <HI>John,</HI> who are faithful and conscientious under it) prepareth them to receive the Knowledge and Faith of Christ crucified and raised again, and fitteth them for the Second Ministration of the Spirit, that bringeth them to witness the Spirit of Adoption, and the Anointing that maketh them true <HI>Christians,</HI> and conformeth them to Christ in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke Virtue, so as to love Enemies, and lay down the Life for Enemies, which is more than meer honest conscientious <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who have not the Faith of Christ cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cified and raised again, can do.</P>

<P>And as to the final state of all honest and conscientious <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who have not had Christ outwardly preached unto them either by the Ministry of Men or the holy Scriptures, it sufficeth us to believe that God is not wanting to them, and it is one God, who is the God both of <HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and who shall justifie the Cir∣cumcision by Faith, and the Uncircumcision through Faith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.30. and it is no greater, nor other difficulty to understand how Honest and Conscientious <HI>Gentiles</HI> can be saved by <HI>Christ Jesus of Nazareth,</HI> than how Infants, and Deaf and Dumb Persons, so bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, can be saved, which our Adversaries generally acknowledge, and there∣fore they can have no advantage against us in that respect.</P>

<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> We believe, That the God of all Grace has given a measure of Grace, or some Manifestation of his Spirit and Light thereof unto all men, who at some time or other do feel something in their Hearts and Consciences, that doth lust against the Flesh, and the Flesh against it, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat these two are contrary the one to the other, one lusting after Evil, which is Evil, and the other after good, which is good.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> We believe, by this Gift, Grace and Inspiration of the Al∣mighty, man only can come to know the true God truly, what he is, and how he works in the Hearts and Consciences of People, to re∣generate them, and make them hear his Image.</P>
<P N="3">3. We believe, That all the Errors and Mistakes about God, and the things relating to his Kingdom, sprang and arose from mens wandering from this Gift of God, into their own Imaginations.</P>

6. Through this Gift, we believe, That Christ Jesus, the Son of God, was manifest in the Flesh in the fullness of Time: and this we know, by the same Spirit by which our Fathers believed he should come, and <HI>Abraham</HI> saw his Day, by the same we do believe he is come, and do see his Day, as also by the Prophets and Apostles Wri∣tings, which <HI>Two-sold Cord is not easily broken.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. We believe also, That this same <HI>Jesus</HI> hath God highly exalted and given him a Name above every Name, that whosoever believes on him shall not perish, but have Everlasting Life, and that there is not another Name, whereby any can be saved, than this Name of <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI> Nor is Remission of sins to be preached by any other Name.</P>

We believe, That this Jesus dyed for or because of sin, and rose again for the Justification of those that believe in him, and that he thereby spoiled Principalities and Powers, and triumphed over them openly, and led Captivity captive in his own Person—It is not a Belief from the Letter only, that can give a man the saving Know∣ledge of the Death of Christ, but he must have the same Power, in measure, working in him, to beget Faith in his Heart, that he may believe unto Salvation, as well as confess with his Mouth: And this man whoever he be, Bond or Free, that thus believes the Death of Christ, and its Satisfaction to God, cannot make it void, nor divide it, but will say, <HI>Here is a dying man, witnessing the Death of Christ, and nevertheless the same man living with Christ,</HI> and concluding, <HI>if Christ had not dyed, man must have perished in his Sin;</HI> This being the way found out by God to recover him.</P>
<P N="9">9. By this Gift of God in our hearts, we further believe, That Christ Jesus rose again from the dead, and sits at Gods right Hand in glorious Body. And we believe, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r low Estates and humble Bodies shall be made like unto his glorious Body, through the work∣ing of his mighty Power, whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself; and that this Mortality shall put on Immortality.—And we believe, that Regeneration, or the believing in the Light of Christ within, doth not make void the Death and Sufferings of Christ without at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> no more than believing the Scripture Testimony without, concerning Christ Death, makes void the Work, of Regeneration &amp; Mortification within; but as the Apostle saith in another case, so I say in this, <HI>For as the Man is not without

<P N="10">10. And we also believe the Resurrection of the Just and Unjust, the one to Salvation, and the other to Condemnation, according to the Judgment of the <HI>Great Day,</HI> and then shall every Seed have its own Body; for if the Dead rise not, we are of all men most miser∣able. But because we da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e not be so foolishly inquisitive, as to say, With what Bodies do they arise, therefore do some say, <HI>We deny both the Resurrection of the Body of Christ, and of all that are or shall be Dead:</HI> But this also is false; for <HI>every man shall be raised in his own Order, but Christ the first Fruits,</HI> I Cor. 15.23.

We have al∣ways believed &amp; owned the Man Christ Jesus, according to the plain History of him in Holy Scripture, as namely, That he was miracu∣lously conceived by the holy Ghost overshadowing the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> that he lived an innocent &amp; sinless Life, preacht powerfully, wrought Miracles, was crucified and put to Death, as concerning the Flesh, buried and rose again the 3d day, and was seen of his Disciples and many Brethren after he arose; and that the <HI>Same Body</HI> that was put to Death, was raised by the Power of God, &amp; was a real Body really seen both before and after his Resurrection, and at his ascention also.

But if we shall be changed as to our low Body, and fashioned into a glorious and spiritual state, then is Christ as to his Body changed or translated into a far more glorious State than what it had when on Earth P.13. as for those Objections against the Man Christ his being in Heaven, they are to <HI>W.
