<HEAD>HIS <HI>HIGHNESS</HI> THE PRINCE OF ORANGE His <HI>LETTER</HI> to the <HI>LORDS SPIRITƲAL</HI> and <HI>TEMPORAL</HI> Assembled at <HI>Westminster</HI> in this present Convention.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have Endeavour'd to the utmost of my power to perform what was desired of me, in order to the publick Peace and Safety; and I do not know that any thing hath been omitted which might tend to the preservation of them, since the Administration of Affairs was put into my hands. It now lyes upon you to lay the Foundations of a firm Security for your RELIGION, your LAWS, and your LIBERTIES.</P>
<P>I do not doubt, but that by such a full &amp; free Representative of the Nation, as now is met, the Ends of my Declaration will be attained: and since it hath pleased GOD, hitherto to bless my good Intentions with so great Success, I trust in HIM that He will compleat his own Work, by sending a Spirit of peace and Union to Influence your COUNCILS. that no Interruption may be given to an Happy and Lasting Settlement. The Dangerous Condition of the Protestant Interest in <HI>Ireland,</HI> require∣ing a Large and Speedy Succour, and the present state of Things abroad, oblige me to tell you, That next to the Danger of unseasonable Divi∣sions among your selves, nothing can be so fatal as too great Delay in your Consultations. The States by whom I have been enabled to Rescue this Nation, may suddenly feel the ill Effects of it, by being too long deprived of the service of their Troops which are now here, and of your early Assistance against a powerful Enemy who hath Declared Warr against them. And as <HI>England</HI> is by Treaty already engaged to help them upon any such Exigencies, so I am confident that their cheerful Concurrence to preserve this Kingdom, with so much Hazzard to themselves, will meet with all the Returns of Friendship, and As∣sistance, which may be expected from you as Protestants and <HI>Englishmen,</HI> whenever their Occasions shall require it.</P>
