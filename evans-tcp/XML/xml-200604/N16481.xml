<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW-YORK, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends and Fellow Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE are times and seasons when <HI>general evils</HI> spread general alarm and uneasiness, and yet arise from causes too complicated, and too little understood by many, to produce a unanimity of opinions respecting their remedies. Hence it is, that on such occasions, the conflict of arguments too often excites a conflict of passions, and intro∣duces a degree of discord and animosity, which, by agitating the public mind, dispose it to precipitation and extravagance. They who on the ocean have been unexpectedly inveloped with tempests, or suddenly entangled among rocks and shoals, know the value of that serene, self-possession and presence of mind, to which in such cases they owed their preservation: nor will the heroes who have given us victory and peace, hesitate to acknowledge, that we are as much indebted for those bles∣sings to the calm prevision, and cool intrepidity which planned and conducted our military measures, as to the glowing animation with which they were executed.</P>
<P>While reason retains her rule, while men are as ready to receive as to give advice, and as willing to be convinced themselves, as to con∣vince others, there are few political evils from which a free and en∣lightened people cannot deliver themselves. It is unquestionably true, that the great body of the people love their country, and wish it pros∣perity; and this observation is particularly applicable to the people of a <HI>free</HI> country, for they have more and stronger reasons for loving it than others. It is not therefore to vicious motives that the unhappy divisi∣ons which sometimes prevail among them are to be imputed; the peo∣ple at large always mean well, and although they may, on certain oc∣casions,
<PB N="4" REF="021175_0003_0FB2705351F749F8"/>
be misled by the counsels, or injured by the efforts of the few who expect more advantage from the wreck, than from the preserva∣tion of national prosperity, yet the motives of these few, are by no means to be confounded with those of the community in general.</P>
<P>That such seeds of discord and danger have been disseminated and begin to take root in America, as unless eradicated will soon poison our gardens and our fields, is a truth much to be lamented; and the more so, as their growth rapidly encreases, while we are wasting the season in honestly but imprudently disputing, not whether they shall be pulled up, but by whom, in what manner, and with what instruments the work shall be done.</P>
<P>When the King of Great-Britain, misguided by men who did not merit his confidence, asserted the unjust claim of binding us in all cases whatsoever, and prepared to obtain our submission by force, the object which engrossed our attention, however important, was nevertheless plain and simple. "What shall we do?" was the question—the people answered, let us unite our counsels and our arms. They sent Delegates to Congress, and soldiers to the field. Confiding in the probity and wisdom of Congress, they received their recommendations as if they had been laws; and that ready acquiescence in their advice enabled those patriots to save their country. Then there was little leisure or disposition for controversy respecting the expediency of measures—hos∣tile fleets soon filled our ports, and hostile armies spread desolation on our shores. Union was then considered as the most essential of human means, and we almost worshipped it with as much fervor, as pagans in distress formerly implored the protection of their tutelar deities. That Union was the child of wisdom—Heaven blessed it, and it wrought out our political salvation.</P>
<P>That glorious war was succeded by an advantageous peace. When danger disappeared, ease, tranquility, and a sense of security loosened the bands of union; and Congress and soldiers and good faith depreci∣ated with their apparent importance. Recommendations lost their in∣fluence, and requisitions were rendered nugatory, not by their want of propriety, but by their want of power. The spirit of private gain ex∣pelled the spirit of public good, and men became more intent on the means of enriching and aggrandizing themselves, than of enriching and aggrandizing their country. Hence the war-worn veteran, whose re∣ward
<PB N="5" REF="021175_0004_0FB27056EECB0100"/>
for toils and wounds existed in written promises, found Congress without the means, and too many of the States without the disposition to do him justice. Hard necessity compelled him, and others under similar circumstances, to sell their honest claims on the public for a lit∣tle bread; and thus unmerited misfortunes and patriotic distresses be∣came articles of speculation and commerce.</P>
<P>These and many other evils, too well known to require enumeration, imperceptibly stole in upon us, and acquired an unhappy influence on our public affairs. But such evils, like the worst of weeds, will natu∣rally spring up in so rich a soil; and a good Government is as necessa∣ry to subdue the one, as an attentive gardener or husbandman is to de∣stroy the other—Even the garden of Paradise required to be dressed, and while men continue to be constantly impelled to error and to wrong, by innumerable circumstances and temptations, so long will society ex∣perience the unceasing necessity of Government.</P>
<P>It is a pity that the expectations which actuated the authors of the existing Confederation, neither have nor can be realized:—accustomed to see and admire the glorious spirit which moved all ranks of people in the most gloomy moments of the war, observing their steadfast at∣tachment to Union, and the wisdom they so often manifested both in choosing and confiding in their rulers, those gentlemen were led to flat∣ter themselves that the people of America only required to know what ought to be done, to do it. This amiable mistake induced them to institute a national Government in such a manner, as though very fit to give advice, was yet destitute of power, and so constructed as to be very unfit to be trusted with it. They seem not to have been sensible that mere advice is a sad substitute for laws; nor to have recollected that the advice even of the all-wise and best of Beings, has been always disregarded by a great majority of all the men that ever lived.</P>
<P>Experience is a severe preceptor, but it teaches useful truths, and however harsh, is always honest—Be calm and dispassionate, and listen to what it tells us.</P>
<P>Prior to the revolution we had little occasion to enquire or know much about national affairs, for although they existed and were managed, yet they were managed <HI>for</HI> us, but not <HI>by</HI> us. Intent on our domestic concerns, our internal legislative business, our agriculture, and our buying and selling, we were seldom anxious about what passed or was
<PB N="6" REF="021175_0005_0FB2705A5645FB08"/>
doing in foreign Courts. As we had nothing to do with that department of policy, so the affairs of it were not detailed to us, and we took as little pains to inform ourselves, as others did to inform us of them. War, and peace, alliances, and treaties, and commerce, and navigation, were con∣ducted and regulated without our advice or controul. While we had liberty and justice, and in security enjoyed the fruits of our "vine and fig tree," we were in general too content and too much occupied, to be at the trouble of investigating the various political combinations in this department, or to examine and perceive how exceedingly impor∣tant they often were to the advancement and protection of our prospe∣rity. This habit and turn of thinking affords one reason why so much more care was taken, and so much more wisdom displayed, in forming our State Governments, than in forming our foederal or national one.</P>
<P>By the Confederation as it now stands, the direction of general and national affairs is committed to a single body of men, viz. the Con∣gress. They may make war, but are not empowered to raise men or mo∣ney to carry it on—They may make peace, but without power to see the terms of it observed—They may form alliances, but without abili∣ty to comply with the stipulations on their part—They may enter into treaties of commerce, but without power to inforce them at home or abroad—They may borrow money, but without having the means of re∣payment—They may partly regulate commerce, but without authority to execute their ordinances—They may appoint ministers and other officers of trust, but without power to try or punish them for misdemea∣nors—They may resolve, but cannot execute either with dispatch or with secrecy—In short, they may consult, and deliberate, and recom∣mend, and make requisitions, and they who please may regard them.</P>
<P>From this new and wonderful system of Government, it has come to pass, that almost every national object of every kind, is at this day unprovided for; and other nations taking the advantage of its imbeci∣lity, are daily multiplying commercial restraints upon us. Our fur trade is gone to Canada, and British garrisons keep the keys of it. Our ship-yards have almost ceased to disturb the repose of the neigh∣bourhood by the noise of the axe and hammer; and while foreign flags fly triumphantly above our highest houses, the American Stars seldom do more than shed a few feeble rays about the humbler masts of river sloops and coasting schooners. The greater part of our hardy seamen
<PB N="7" REF="021175_0006_0FB2705BD1663170"/>
are plowing the ocean in foreign pay; and not a few of our ingenious shipwrights are now building vessels on alien shores. Although our in∣creasing agriculture and industry extend and multiply our productions, yet they constantly diminish in value; and although we permit all na∣tions to fill our country with their merchandizes, yet their best mar∣kets are shut against us. Is there an English, or a French, or a Spanish island or port in the West-Indies to which an American vessel can carry a cargo of flour for sale? Not one. The Algerines ex∣clude us from the Mediterranean, and adjacent countries; and we are neither able to purchase, nor to command the free use of those seas. Can our little towns or larger cities consume the immense productions of our fertile country? or will they without trade be able to pay a good price for the proportion which they do consume? The last season gave a very unequivocal answer to those questions—What numbers of fine cattle have returned from this city to the country for want of buyers? What great quantities of salted and other provisions still lay useless in the stores? To how much below the former price, is our corn and wheat and flour and lumber rapidly falling? Our debts remain undi∣minished, and the interest on them accumulating—our credit abroad is nearly extinguished, and at home unrestored—they who had money have sent it beyond the reach of our laws, and scarcely any man can borrow of his neighbour. Nay, does not experience also tell us, that it is as difficult to pay as to borrow? That even our houses and lands cannot command money—that law suits and usurious contracts abound —that our farms sell on executions for less than half their value, and that distress in various forms, and in various ways, is approaching fast to the doors of our best citizens.</P>
<P>These things have been gradually coming upon us ever since the peace—they have been perceived and proclaimed, but the universal rage and pursuit of private gain conspired with other causes, to prevent any proper efforts being made to meliorate our condition by due atten∣tion to our national affairs, until the late Convention was convened for that purpose. From the result of their deliberations, the States ex∣pected to derive much good, and should they be disappointed, it will probably be not less their misfortune than their fault. That Conven∣tion was in general composed of excellent and tried men—men who had become conspicuous for their wisdom and public services, and whose names
<PB N="8" REF="021175_0007_0FB2705D5E3ECC40"/>
and characters will be venerated by posterity. Generous and candid minds cannot perceive without pain, the illiberal manner in which some have taken the liberty to treat them; nor forbear to impute it to impure and improper motives—zeal for public good, like zeal for religion, may sometimes carry men beyond the bounds of reason, but it is not conceivable, that on this occasion, it should find means so to enebriate any <HI>candid</HI> American, as to make him forget what he owed to truth and to decency, or induce him either to believe or to say, that the almost unanimous advice of the Convention, proceeded from a wicked combination and conspiracy a∣gainst the liberties of their country. This is not the temper with which we should receive and consider their recommendations, nor the treat∣ment that would be worthy either of us or of them. Let us continue careful therefore that facts do not warrant historians to tell future generations, that envy, malice and uncharitableness pursued our pa∣triotic benefactors to their graves, and that not even pre-eminence in virtue, nor lives devoted to the public, could shield them from oblo∣quy and detraction. On the contrary, let our bosoms always retain a sufficient degree of honest indignation to disappoint and discourage those who expect our thanks or applause for calumniating our most faithful and meritorious friends.</P>
<P>The Convention concurred in opinion with the people, that a na∣tional government <HI>competent to every national object,</HI> was indispensably necessary; and it was as plain to them, as it now is to all America, that the present confederation does not provide for such a government. These points being agreed, they proceeded to consider how and in what manner such a Government could be formed, as on the one hand should be sufficiently energetic to raise us from our prostrate and distressed si∣tuation, and on the other be perfectly consistent with the liberties of the people of every State. Like men to whom the experience of other ages and countries had taught wisdom, they not only determined that it should be erected by, and depend on the people; but remembering the many instances in which Governments vested solely in one man, or one body of men, had degenerated into tyrannies, they judged it most prudent that the three great branches of power should be committed to different hands, and therefore that the executive should be separated from the legislative, and the judicial from both. Thus far the propriety of their work is easily seen and understood, and therefore is thus far <HI>almost</HI> uni∣versally
<PB N="9" REF="021175_0008_0FB2705F00210520"/>
approved—for no one man or thing under the sun ever yet pleased every body.</P>
<P>The next question was, what particular powers should be given to these three branches? Here the different views and interests of the different States, as well as the different abstract opinions of their mem∣bers on such points, interposed many difficulties. Here the business became complicated, and presented a wide field for investigation; too wide for every eye to take a quick and comprehensive view of it.</P>
<P>It is said that "in a multitude of counsellors there is safety," because in the first place, there is greater security for probity; and in the next, if every member casts in only his mite of information and argument, their joint stock of both will thereby become greater than the stock possessed by any one single man out of doors. Gentlemen out of doors therefore should not be hasty in condemning a system, which probably rests on more good reasons than they are aware of, especially when formed under such advantages, and recommended by so many men of distinguished worth and abilities.</P>
<P>The difficulties before mentioned occupied the Convention a long time, and it was not without mutual concessions that they were at last surmounted. These concessions serve to explain to us the reason why some parts of the system please in some States, which displease in others; and why many of the objections which have been made to it, are so contradictory and inconsistent with one another. It does great credit to the temper and talents of the Convention, that they were able so to reconcile the different views and interests of the different States, and the clashing opinions of their members, as to unite with such singular and almost perfect unanimity in any plan whatever, on a sub∣ject so intricate and perplexed. It shews that it must have been tho∣roughly discussed and understood; and probably if the community at large had the same lights and reasons before them, they would, if equal∣ly candid and uninfluenced, be equally unanimous.</P>
<P>It would be arduous, and indeed impossible to comprize within the limits of this address, a full discussion of every part of the plan. Such a task would require a volume, and few men have leisure or inclination to read volumes on any subject. The objections made to it are almost without number, and many of them without reason—some of them are real and honest, and others merely ostensible. There are friends to
<PB N="10" REF="021175_0009_0FB270634EA8F5D0"/>
Union and a national Government who have serious doubts, who wish to be informed, and to be convinced; and there are others who, neither wishing for Union nor any national Government at all, will oppose and object to any plan that can be contrived.</P>
<P>We are told, among other strange things, that the liberty of the press is left insecure by the proposed Constitution, and yet that Consti∣tution says neither more nor less about it, than the Constitution of the State of New-York does. We are told that it deprives us of trial by jury, whereas the fact is, that it expresly secures it in certain cases, and takes it away in none—it is absurd to construe the silence of this, or of our own Constitution, relative to a great number of our rights, into a to∣tal extinction of them—silence and blank paper neither grant nor take away any thing. Complaints are also made that the proposed Constitu∣tion is not accompanied by a bill of rights; and yet they who make these complaints, know and are content that no bill of rights accompa∣nied the Constitution of this State. In days and countries where Mo∣narchs and their subjects were frequently disputing about prerogative and privileges, the latter often found it necessary, as it were to run out the line between them, and oblige the former to admit by solemn acts, called bills of rights, that certain enumerated rights belonged to the people, and were not comprehended in the royal prerogative. But thank God we have no such disputes—we have no Monarchs to con∣tend with, or demand admissions from—the proposed Government is to be the government of the people—all its officers are to be their officers, and to exercise no rights but such as the people commit to them. The Constitution only serves to point out that part of the people's business, which they think proper by it to refer to the management of the per∣sons therein designated—those persons are to receive that business to manage, not for themselves, and as their own, but as agents and over∣seers for the people to whom they are constantly responsible, and by whom only they are to be appointed.</P>
<P>But the design of this address is not to investigate the merits of the plan, nor of the objections made to it. They who seriously contemplate the present state of our affairs will be convinced that other considerations of at least equal importance demand their attention. Let it be admit∣ted that this plan, like everything else devised by man, has its imperfec∣tions; That it does not please every body is certain, and there is little
<PB N="11" REF="021175_0010_0FB27069B400B2C8"/>
reason to expect one that will. It is a question of great moment to you, whether the probability of our being able seasonably to obtain a better, is such as to render it prudent and advisable to reject this, and run the risque.—Candidly to consider this question is the design of this address.</P>
<P>As the importance of this question must be obvious to every man, whatever his private opinions respecting it may be, it becomes us all to treat it in that calm and temperate manner, which a subject so deeply interesting to the future welfare of our country and posterity requires. Let us therefore as much as possible repress and compose that irritation in our minds, which too warm disputes about it may have excited. Let us endeavor to forget that this or that man, is on this or that side; and that we ourselves, perhaps without sufficient reflection, have classed our∣selves with one or the other party. Let us remember that this is not to be regarded as a matter that only touches our local parties, but as one so great, so general, and so extensive in its future consequences to America, that for our deciding upon it according to the best of our un∣biassed judgment, we must be highly responsible both here and hereafter.</P>
<P>The question now before us naturally leads to <HI>three</HI> enquiries:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Whether it is probable that a better plan can be obtained?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Whether, if attainable, it is likely to be in season?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. What would be our situation, if after rejecting this, all our ef∣forts to obtain a better should prove fruitless?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The men who formed this plan are Americans, who had long de∣served and enjoyed our confidence, and who are as much interested in having a good government as any of us are, or can be. They were ap∣pointed to that business at a time when the States had become very sensible of the derangement of our national affairs, and of the impossi∣bility of retrieving them under the existing Confederation. Although well persuaded that nothing but a good national Government could op∣pose and divert the tide of evils that was flowing in upon us, yet those gentlemen met in Convention with minds perfectly unprejudiced in fa∣vor of any particular plan. The minds of their Constituents were at that time equally unbiassed, equally cool and dispassionate. All agreed in the necessity of doing something, but no one ventured to say deci∣dedly what precisely ought to be done—opinions were then fluctuating and unfixed, and whatever might have been the wishes of a few indi∣viduals, yet while the Convention deliberated, the people remained in
<PB N="12" REF="021175_0011_0FB2706D3168F8B8"/>
silent suspence. Neither wedded to favorite systems of their own, nor influenced by popular ones abroad, the members were more desirous to receive light from, than to impress their private sentiments on one another. These circumstances naturally opened the door to that spirit of candor, of calm enquiry, of mutual accommodation, and mutual respect, which entered into the Convention with them, and regulated their debates and proceedings.</P>
<P>The impossibility of agreeing upon any plan that would exactly qua∣drate with the local policy and objects of every State, soon became evi∣dent; and they wisely thought it better mutually to concede, and ac∣commodate, and in that way to fashion their system as much as possible by the circumstances and wishes of the different States, than by perti∣naciously adhering, each to his own ideas, oblige the Convention to rise without doing any thing. They were sensible that obstacles arising from local circumstances, would not cease while those circumstances conti∣nue to exist; and so far as those circumstances depended on differences of climate, productions, and commerce, that no change was to be expected. They were likewise sensible that on a subject so comprehensive, and in∣volving such a variety of points and questions, the most able, the most candid, and the most honest men will differ in opinion. The same proposition seldom strikes many minds exactly in the same point or light: different habits of thinking, different degrees and modes of edu∣cation, different prejudices and opinions early formed and long enter∣tained, conspire with a multitude of other circumstances, to produce among men a diversity and contrariety of opinions on questions of diffi∣culty. Liberality therefore as well as prudence, induced them to treat each other's opinions with tenderness, to argue without asperity, and to endeavor to convince the judgment without hurting the feelings of each other. Although many weeks were passed in these discussions, some points remained, on which a unison of opinions could not be effected. Here again that same happy disposition to unite and conciliate, induced them to meet each other; and enabled them by mutual concessions, fi∣nally to compleat and agree to the plan they have recommended, and that too with a degree of unanimity, which, considering the variety of discordant views and ideas they had to reconcile, is really astonishing.</P>
<P>They tell us very honestly that this plan is the result of accommoda∣tion—they do not hold it up as the best of all possible ones, but only
<PB N="13" REF="021175_0012_0FB2706E925E9360"/>
as the best which they could unite in, and agree to. If such men, ap∣pointed and meeting under such auspicious circumstances, and so sin∣cerely disposed to conciliation, could go no further in their endeavors to please every State and every body, what reason have we at present to expect any system that would give more general satisfaction?</P>
<P>Suppose this plan to be rejected, what measures would you propose for obtaining a better? Some will answer, let us appoint another Con∣vention, and as every thing has been said and written, that can well be said and written on the subject, they will be better informed than the former one was, and consequently be better able to make and agree upon a more eligible one.</P>
<P>This reasoning is fair, and as far as it goes has weight; but it ne∣vertheless takes one thing for granted, which appears very doubtful; for although the new Convention might have more information, and perhaps equal abilities, yet it does not from thence follow that they would be equally <HI>disposed to agree.</HI> The contrary of this position is the most probable. You must have observed that the same temper and equanimity which prevailed among the people on the former occasion, no longer exists. We have unhappily become divided into parties, and this important subject has been handled with such indiscreet and offen∣sive acrimony, and with so many little unhandsome artifices and misre∣presentations, that pernicious heats and animosities have been kindled, and spread their flames far and wide among us. When therefore it be∣comes a question who shall be deputed to the new Convention; we can∣not flatter ourselves that the talents and integrity of the candidates will determine who shall be elected. Foederal electors will vote for foede∣ral deputies, and anti-foederal electors for anti-foederal ones. Nor will either party prefer the most moderate of their adherents, for as the most staunch and active partizans will be the most popular, so the men most willing and able to carry points, to oppose, and divide, and embarrass their opponents will be chosen. A Convention formed at such a sea∣son, and of such men, would be but too exact an epitome of the great body that named them. The same party views, the same propensity to opposition, the same distrusts and jealousies, and the same unaccomodat∣ing spirit which prevail without, would be concentred and ferment with still greater violence within. Each deputy would recollect <HI>who</HI> sent
<PB N="14" REF="021175_0013_0FB270731DAFA3D0"/>
him, and <HI>why</HI> he was sent; and be too apt to consider himself bound in honor, to contend and act vigorously under the standard of his party, and not hazard their displeasure by preferring compromise to victory. As vice does not sow the seeds of virtue, so neither does passion culti∣vate the fruits of reason. Suspicions and resentments create no disposi∣tion to conciliate, nor do they infuse a desire of making partial and per∣sonal objects bend to general union and the common good. The ut∣most efforts of that excellent disposition were necessary to enable the late Convention to perform their task; and although contrary causes sometimes operate similar effects, yet to expect that discord and animo∣sity should produce the fruits of confidence and agreement, is to expect "grapes from thorns, and figs from thistles."</P>
<P>The States of Georgia, Delaware, Jersey and Connecticut, have adopted the present plan with unexampled unanimity; they are content with it as it is, and consequently their deputies, being apprized of the sentiments of their Constituents, will be little inclined to make alterati∣ons, and cannot be otherwise than averse to changes which they have no reason to think would be agreeable to their people—some other States, tho' less unanimous, have nevertheless adopted it by very re∣spectable majorities; and for reasons so evidently cogent, that even the minority in one of them, have nobly pledged themselves for its pro∣motion and support. From these circumstances the new Convention would derive and experience difficulties unknown to the former. Nor are these the only additional difficulties they would have to encounter. Few are ignorant that there has lately sprung up a sect of politicians who teach and profess to believe, that the extent of our nation is too great for the superintendance of one national Government, and on that principle argue that it ought to be divided into two or three. This doctrine, however mischievous in its tendency and consequences, has its advocates, and should any of them be sent to the Convention, it will naturally be their policy rather to cherish than to prevent divisions: for well knowing that the institution of any good national Government, would blast their favorite system, no measures that lead to it can meet with their aid or approbation.</P>
<P>Nor can we be certain whether or not any and what foreign influence would, on such an occasion, be indirectly exerted, nor for what pur∣poses—delicacy forbids an ample discussion of this question. Thus
<PB N="15" REF="021175_0014_0FB2707557606BB8"/>
much may be said without error or offence, viz. That such foreign nations as desire the prosperity of America, and would rejoice to see her become great and powerful, under the auspices of a Government wise∣ly calculated to extend her commerce, to encourage her navigation and marine, and to direct the whole weight of her power and resources as her interest and honor may require, will doubtless be friendly to the Union of the States, and to the establishment of a Government able to perpetuate, protect and dignify it.—Such other foreign nations, if any such there be, who, jealous of our growing importance, and fearful that our commerce and navigation should impair their own—who behold our rapid population with regret, and apprehend that the enterprizing spirit of our people, when seconded by power and probability of success, may be directed to objects not consistent with their policy or interest, cannot fail at least to wish that we may continue a weak and a divided people.</P>
<P>These considerations merit much attention, and candid men will judge how far they render it probable that a new Convention would be able either to agree in a better plan, or with tolerable unanimity, in any plan at all. Any plan forcibly carried by a slender majority, must expect numerous opponents among the people, who, especially in their present temper, would be more inclined to reject than adopt any system so made and carried. We should in such a case again see the press teem∣ing with publications for and against it; for as the minority would take pains to justify their dissent, so would the majority be industrious to display the wisdom of their proceedings. Hence new divisions, new parties, and new distractions would ensue, and no one can foresee or conjecture when or how they would terminate.</P>
<P>Let those who are sanguine in their expectations of a better plan from a new Convention, also reflect on the delays and risques to which it would expose us. Let them consider whether we ought, by continuing much longer in our present humiliated condition, to give other nations further time to perfect their restrictive systems of commerce, to reconcile their own people to them, and to fence and guard and strengthen them by all those regulations and contrivances in which a jealous policy is ever fruitful. Let them consider whether we ought to give further oppor∣tunities to discord to alienate the hearts of our citizens from one another, and thereby encourage new Cromwells to bold exploits. Are we cer∣tain
<PB N="16" REF="021175_0015_0FB2707784FB19C8"/>
that our foreign creditors will continue patient, and ready to pro∣portion their forbearance to our delays? Are we sure that our distresses, dissentions and weakness will neither invite hostility nor insult? If they should, how ill prepared shall we be for defence! without Union, with∣out Government, without money, and without credit!</P>
<P>It seems unnecessary to remind you, that some time must yet elapse, before all the States will have decided on the present plan. If they re∣ject it, some time must also pass before the measure of a new Conven∣tion, can be brought about and generally agreed to. A further space of time will then be requisite to elect their deputies, and send them on to Convention. What time they may expend when met, cannot be divined, and it is equally uncertain how much time the several States may take to deliberate and decide on any plan they may recommend— if adopted, still a further space of time will be necessary to organize and set it in motion:—In the mean time our affairs are daily going on from bad to worse, and it is not rash to say that our distresses are accumu∣lating like compound interest.</P>
<P>But if for the reasons already mentioned, and others that we cannot now perceive, the new Convention, instead of producing a better plan, should give us only a history of their disputes, or should offer us one still less pleasing than the present, where should we be then? The old Confederation has done its best, and cannot help us; and is now so re∣laxed and feeble, that in all probability it would not survive so violent a shock. Then "to your tents Oh Israel!" would be the word. Then every band of Union would be severed. Then every State would be a little nation, jealous of its neighbours, and anxious to strengthen itself by foreign alliances, against its former friends. Then farewell to fra∣ternal affection, unsuspecting intercourse, and mutual participation in commerce, navigation and citizenship. Then would arise mutual re∣strictions and fears, mutual garrisons,—and standing armies, and all those dreadful evils which for so many ages plagued England, Scot∣land, Wales and Ireland, while they continued disunited, and were played off against each other.</P>
<P>Consider my fellow citizens what you are about, before it is too late —consider what in such an event would be your particular case.—You know the geography of your State, and the consequences of your local position. Jersey and Connecticut, to whom your impost laws have been
<PB N="17" REF="021175_0016_0FB270784D2D61F0"/>
unkind—Jersey and Connecticut, who have adopted the present plan, and expect much good from it, will impute its miscarriage and all the consequent evils to you. They now consider your opposition as dic∣tated more by your fondness for your impost, than for those rights to which they have never been behind you in attachment. They cannot, they will not love you—they border upon you, and are your neighbours, but you will soon cease to regard their neighbourhood as a blessing. You have but one port and outlet to your commerce, and how you are to keep that outlet free and uninterrupted, merits consideration.— What advantages Vermont in combination with others, might take of you, may easily be conjectured; nor will you be at a loss to perceive how much reason the people of Long-Island, whom you cannot protect, have to deprecate being constantly exposed to the depredations of every invader.</P>
<P>These are short hints—they ought not to be more developed—you can easily in your own minds dilate and trace them through all their relative circumstances and connections.—Pause then for a moment, and reflect whether the matters you are disputing about, are of suffici∣ent moment to justify your running such extravagant risques. Reflect that the present plan comes recommended to you by men and fellow-citizens, who have given you the highest proofs that men can give, of their justice, their love for liberty and their country, of their prudence, of their application, and of their talents. They tell you it is the best that they could form; and that in their opinion, it is necessary to re∣deem you from those calamities which already begin to be heavy upon us all. You find that not only those men, but others of similar cha∣racters, and of whom you have also had very ample experience, advise you to adopt it. You find that whole States concur in the sentiment, and among them are your next neighbours; both of whom have shed much blood in the cause of liberty, and have manifested as strong and constant a predilection for a free Republican Government as any States in the Union, and perhaps in the world. They perceive not those la∣tent mischiefs in it, with which some double-sighted politicians endea∣vor to alarm you. You cannot but be sensible that this plan or Con∣stitution will always be in the hands and power of the people, and that
<PB N="18" REF="021175_0017_0FB27079CCEB28D0"/>
if on experiment, it should be found defective or incompetent, they may either remedy its defects, or substitute another in its room. The objec∣tionable parts of it are certainly very questionable, for otherwise there would not be such a contrariety of opinions about them. Experience will better determine such questions than theoretical arguments, and so far as the danger of abuses is urged against the institution of a Govern∣ment, remember that a power to do good always involves a power to do harm. We must in the business of Government as well as in all other business, have some degree of confidence, as well as a great degree of caution. Who on a sick bed would refuse medicines from a physi∣cian, merely because it is as much in his power to administer deadly poi∣sons, as salutary remedies.</P>
<P>You cannot be certain, that by rejecting the proposed plan you would not place yourselves in a very awkward situation. Suppose nine States should nevertheless adopt it, would you not in that case be obliged either to separate from the Union, or rescind your dissent? The first would not be eligible, nor could the latter be pleasant—A mere hint is suffici∣ent on this topic—You cannot but be aware of the consequences.</P>
<P>Consider then, how weighty and how many considerations advise and persuade the People of America to remain in the safe and easy path of Union; to continue to move and act as they hitherto have done, as a <HI>Band of Brothers</HI>; to have confidence in themselves and in one another; and since all cannot see with the same eyes, at least to give the proposed Constitution a fair trial, and to mend it as time, occasion and experi∣ence may dictate. It would little become us to verify the predictions of those who ventured to prophecy, that <HI>Peace,</HI> instead of blessing us with happiness and tranquility, would serve only as the signal for facti∣ons, discords and civil contentions to rage in our land, and overwhelm it with misery and distress.</P>
<P>Let us also be mindful that the cause of freedom greatly depends on the use we make of the singular opportunities we enjoy of governing ourselves wisely; for if the event should prove, that the people of this
<PB N="19" REF="021175_0018_0FB2707B4FCF4590"/>
country either cannot or will not govern themselves, who will hereafter be advocates for systems, which however charming in theory and pros∣pect, are not reducible to practice. If the people of our nation, instead of consenting to be governed by laws of their own making and rulers of their own choosing, should let licentiousness, disorder and confusion reign over them, the minds of men every where, will insensibly become alie∣nated from republican forms, and prepared to prefer and acquiesce in Governments, which, though less friendly to liberty, afford more peace and security.</P>
<P><HI>Receive this Address with the same candor with which it is written; and may the spirit of wisdom and patriotism direct and distinguish your counsels and your conduct.</HI></P>
