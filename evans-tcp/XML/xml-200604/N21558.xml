<HEAD>DEDICATION. To the American Youth.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Rose</HI> of <HI>Sharon,</HI> and the <HI>Lilly</HI> of the <HI>valley,</HI> never so irresistibly charmed the eye of the beholder, as that part of the rising generation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whose minds are expanded with knowledge— whose hearts are glowing with love, and whose lives are regulated by the rules of politeness, prudence and virtue. To persons of sensibility, the natural creation can afford no sight more de∣lightful and enchanting.—Of course it must be a circumstance very important and interesting to all the friends of the rising generation, as well as to the youth themselves—to contribute all that lies in one's power, to promote their rising glo∣ry.</P>
<P><HI>Dear Youth,</HI></P>
<P>THIS little book is dedicated to you, not be∣cause the author thought it more re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lete with in¦struction

than many others, with which you are acquainted—but because it is upon a subject not frequently handled by writers of any age. Be so kind as to read it with candor, and it may contribute to advance your charms, pleasures and usefulness in life.</P>
<P>That you may far exceed all the generations which have gone before you, in beauty, wisdom, felicity and glory, is the humble prayer, not on∣ly of the benevolent in general—but in particu∣lar of</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>PREFACE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the subject of the following pages is of acknowledged importance to rising generations—I do not remember to have seen it in any publication, ancient or modern, cultivated with that force, perspic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity and fami∣liarity which it demands.</P>
<P>The short Discourse, with which this little volume begins, aims at nothing more, than to impress the minds of young people with a lively sense of the love and favour of heaven in grant∣ing to the human race, the <HI>Institution of Mar∣riage,</HI> which is so admirably calculated to pro∣mote their improvement, pleasure and happi∣ness.</P>
<P>The principal scenes of courtship, here dis¦played, are taken from actual life; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onse∣quently must be more interesting to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reader, than if they were merely fictitious Several of

<P>The language is not so polished, as on a sub∣ject of this kind, it might have been, had there been no regard paid to actual facts. Notwith∣standing, it is presumed our youth may read these several scenes of Courtship with a degree of pleasure and profit.</P>
<P>The novelty of such a publication as this, and the important hints interspersed through the whole, may prove both amusing and profitable.</P>
<P>Nothing of a temporal nature, can be more desirable to parents, than to see their offspring forming judicious connections in life; and no connection can be estimated of more importance than that of <HI>marriage.</HI></P>

<Q><BIBL>HEBREWS xiii.4.</BIBL>
<P>MARRIAGE IS HONOURABLE IN ALL, AND THE BED UNDEFILED: BUT WHOREMONGERS AND ADULTERERS GOD WILL JUDGE.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE natural propensity of the human spe∣cies to multiply and replenish the earth, has al∣ways been too great to go unregulated by some wise and wholsome institution from heaven. Therefore, for the great end of rendering mankind more happy, than they otherwise could have been, the God of love has favoured us with the institution of Marriage.</P>
<P>In discoursing upon the words of the text thus introduced, we will</P>
<P N="1">I. Illustrate the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>a, that marriage is hon∣ourable in all.</P>
<P N="2">II. Take notice, that the propagation of our species without marriage, must be whoredom and
<PB N="14" REF="028341_0009_0FD88C1C6EC2A078"/>
adultery, which will be condemned by a righteous God, the Judge of all the earth—and then,</P>
<P N="3">III. Draw a few inferences from the whole.</P>
<P N="1">1. Notwithstanding the example set us by the Clergy of the Church of Rome▪ and many others of the deistical tribe among civilians—notwith∣standing the sentiments of Lord Bolingbroke, that poligamy is a dictate of nature—notwithstanding the sentiments and examples of these and many others, who have foolishly ridiculed revealed institutions—we say, that our God has told us, that <HI>Marriage is honourable in all</HI>; this will ap∣pear▪ if we consider that marriage is an institution of heaven, and among the children of men, is a civil contract, by which, for life, one man and one woman are joined together as husband and wife. The Saviour of the world has told us— That he who made us <HI>at the beginning,</HI> made us <HI>male and female,</HI> and says, <HI>for this cause, a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve to his wife, and they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wain shall be one flesh.</HI> Hence one great end in the <HI>formation of man,</HI> was that they might multiply and replenish the earth.</P>
<P>The union of one man and one woman as hus∣band and wife, therefore, must be honourable in the sight of heaven, consequently, must be hon∣ourable in the sight of all those who have any respect to those institutions which God has made for the good of mankind.</P>
<P N="2">2. Marriage must be honourable, because this is the only way of propagating our species, which is truly virtuous. Nothing which is virtuous can be dishonourable in the sight of God, or even in the sight of men whose judgments are regulated by a love of propriety and truth.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="15" REF="028341_0010_0FD8B0FB9D653520"/>3. Marriage must be honourable, because it is profitable. Man and woman are mutually profit∣ed by a judicious connection of this kind; in this way their wants may be supplied by each other with more ease than in any other: this is a truth applicable to mankind in general.</P>
<P N="4">4. Marriage must be honourable, because it renders virtuous men and women more happy than they can be without it. In the married state, there are ten thousand joys and innocent pleasures, which men and women in a single state can never experience and be virtuous. The happy, virtuous and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ied pair, viewing them∣selves as having one common interest, and feel∣ing themsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> animated by one soul, will readily partic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> each others labours and sorrows, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> communicate to each plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> joys; and while they trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the rougher <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of life, hand in hand, they will beguile the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>esome walk with mutual and enchanting smile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—with pleasures, which have never yet found names to express them.</P>
<P N="2">II. We were to take notice, that the propaga∣tion of our species, without marriage, must be whoredom and adultery, which will be condemn∣ed by a righteous God, the judge of all the earth.</P>
<P N="1">1. Here let it be remembered, that God will censure and condemn every thing which in its nature, is contrary to his holy law, dishonourable to himself, and injurious to his creatures▪ but whoredom and adultery are unlawful, dishon∣ourable to God, and injurious to mankind, there∣fore, the perpetrators of these shameful crimes
<PB N="16" REF="028341_0011_0FD8B0FD43C25760"/>
must expect to meet their angry Judge, who will not fail to treat them as the rude violators of his holy laws, and abusers of his creatures.</P>
<P>That this vicious course of conduct is a viola∣tion of the law of God, must be evident to every one who reads his Bible; that it is injurious to mankind, will appear from the following consid∣erations:</P>
<P N="1">1. It never fails of introducing confusion and distress into families and societies where it take<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> place. How many of the fair and unguarded sex, by means of this disgraceful conduct, have been obliged to pine and die, in circumstances the most wretched and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orlor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> How many chil∣dren have been exposed to want, and even death in consequence thereof, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> might have been well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ided <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of infamy do all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them to the grave!</P>
<P N="2">2. Though it be a fact, that several men of fortune and influence have taken care to provide for, and educate their illegitimate and spurious offspring, yet it is more than probable, that ten to one of those unfortunate mortals have suffer∣ed beyond all expression by means of the un∣happy circumstances which attended their being brought into existence. The history of a Savage, one of the British Poets, would be enough to convince any one of this. And if the great and the opulent neglect their natural children, and suffer them to endure innumerable evils, for want of their assistance, what may we expect to find among the ignorant and indigent parts of society,
<PB N="17" REF="028341_0012_0FD8B0FE9B68C110"/>
who, without controul, give themselves up to the unlawful gratification of their passions?</P>
<P>The many instances of parents being executed for the murder of their illegitimate children, are more than ten thousand arguments against this absurd and vicious mode of propagating our spe∣cies in the world.</P>
<P>They who indulge themselves in whoredom or adultery, mutually abuse and defile one another: they disgrace their families, injure society, and dishonour their Maker; and therefore, without repentance, cannot escape the wrath of God.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Has God, for the happiness of mankind, given as the institution of marriage, and is <HI>mar∣riage</HI> and the <HI>bed undefiled</HI> honourable in all? Then we ought to feel the obligations we are un∣der, to observe this regulation of our passions in life. Have we not reason to fear, there are ma∣ny who live under the light of the Gospel, with∣out any realising sense of the goodness of God, in this happy institution—that feel themselves un∣der no obligation to observe the will of heaven respecting this matter? This is, and ought to be for a lamentation among christian people.</P>
<P N="2">2. From what has been said, we may learn, what an odious figure those make in the sight of God, and in the sight of all the virtuous part of mankind, who indulge themselves in propagating their species by acts of whoredom and adultery: such characters will not bear an examination; the pleasures which they take in these vicious ways are attended with stings of conscience, with disgrace and infamy to themselves and their
<PB N="18" REF="028341_0013_0FD8B103C02A8AA0"/>
wretched posterity in this life, and with punish∣ment in the life which is to come, if unrepented of.</P>
<P N="3">3. How thankful ought we to be for the insti∣tution of marriage, which is so wonderfully cal∣culated to promote the happiness of mankind. By entering into the married state, the natural propensities of male and female towards each other, may be indulged in perfect consistency, with the most elevated and pious feelings of an holy and humble heart: for there is nothing more criminal in that natural inclination which the sex have for the enjoyment of each other, than there is in hunger or thirst, with which the God of na∣ture has universally endowed the human species. As we are rational creatures, we are then crimi∣nal when we indulge these propensities, or natur∣al appetites in an unlawful way and manner, which constitutes whoredom, adultery, gluttony and drunkenness.</P>
<P N="4">4. Is marriage of so much importance as to promote the honour and happiness of mankind? then we may learn the propriety of laying down rules or directions for the choice of suitable com∣panions in life, that we may virtuously propagate our species in the world.</P>
<P>Therefore, we shall now lay down several gen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> rules or prudential Maxims, worthy to be treasured up in the memories of those young people, who would obtain suitable companions in life; after which we shall give several instan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of Courtships, not unworthy of the imitation of the American Youth.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="028341_0014_0FD8B104AB947E80"/>MAXIM 1.—Never undertake to woo a com∣panion previous to your arriving to an age fit for marriage: for not observing this precaution, ma∣ny a sprightly youth has been so entangled with premature connections, as have been very griev∣ous through life.</P>
<P>MAXIM 2.—No person ought to engage in the delightful business of courting, while his cir∣cumstances in life afford no rational prospect of supporting a small family, and of his pretty soon entering into a state of wedlock: for not observ∣ing these precautions, many evils have attended the married state, and injured the parties all their days.</P>
<P>MAXIM 3.—Youth who are under age, ought to form no connection for the purpose of keeping company, without the approbation of their par∣ents or guardians.</P>
<P>The not observing this maxim, has plunged many a promising youth into great difficulties. However, in all cases in which this is impractica∣ble, by means of the want of parents and guar∣dians, youth are justified in proceeding without it.</P>
<P>MAXIM 4.—Let none propose marriage, long before any real prospect of entering into that nearest and dearest of all connections. The do∣ing of this, has proved a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are to the undoing of many a lovely youth: the pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se of marriage has untied the bands of virtue, and thrown many innocent creatures off their guard, to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> entire ruin.</P>
<P>MAXIM 5 —It is not desirable for persons o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an unsuitable age to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n other▪
<PB N="20" REF="028341_0015_0FD8B107309ED6A0"/>
However, a few years more in the age of the male than the age of the female, has been found by experience not inconvenient, owing probably, to women's failing in their natural strength and vigour sooner than men. But when the age of the parties are so disproportionate, as to find the one party in the bloom and vigour of life, and the other undergoing all the infirmities of old age, much of the happiness of the married state is interrupted, if not wholly prevented.</P>
<P>MAXIM 6.—The parties who would wish to match with each other, ought to be as nearly of a level, as to reputation, and family, as possible; otherwise, scenes of contention may arise, which in time may ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the delicious sweets of matri∣mony, and render the conjugal life burdensome.</P>
<P>MAXIM 7.—It is undesirable, if not unlawful, for persons of piety, to match with open and a∣vowed infidels. It is likewise frequently incon∣venient for persons of one denomination, to match with persons of another, especially those, who are of such denominations as admit of no communion with each other. The evil effects of such heterogeneous connections, are too many here to be enumerated.</P>
<P>MAXIM 8.—It is preposterous for any to marry only for the sake of money; for riches may take unto themselves wings and fly away: and when this comes to pass, it will be ten to one if all the sweets of matrimony do not follow, and innumerable evils rise in their room. Instances of this kind have not been unfrequent in every part of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="028341_0016_0FD8B1086EC9DFF0"/>MAXIM 9.—Other things being equal, senti∣ment intermingled with unfeigned affection, ought to be the great basis on which a connection so honourable and pleasant as that of matrimony should be founded. They who suffer their fancy to take the lead of their judgment in the choice of companions, will be in great danger of being deceived, and finally rendered unhappy in the conjugal state.</P>
<P>MAXIM 10.—In the choice of companions, the parties should as thorougly as possible, investi∣gate each others natural tempers. Some are of a temper so rough and boisterous, or so sullen and unforgiving, that a person of a tender heart, calm disposition, and delicate constitution, could no more be happy with them in the bands of matri∣mony, than a lamb in the company of a tyger, or a dove in the presence of a hawk. Many a poor wretch having never seen the intended com∣panion, but in hours of the greatest pleasantry, has been decoyed into a match as unsuitable as can well be expressed. It is acknowledged, that in many instances, the natural tempers of young people lie much out of sight, and consequently cannot be known without much attention: this ought not to discourage, but engage all to obtain this knowledge.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Courtship of <HI>STREPHON</HI> and <HI>ELIZA;</HI> to∣gether with Lady <HI>G—'s</HI> Amour with <HI>Strephon.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE shall now give you an history of a courtship not unworthy of your imitation. It is that which took place between Strephon and Eliza, American you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h.</P>
<P>Strephon was a young gentleman of about twenty-five years of age; a person of gente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l de∣portment; his shapes, lim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and features were well proportioned; comely, though not very handsome; of good parentage, but of a moderate interest; of a most amiable moral character, and devoutly religious.</P>
<P>Eliza was a young lady of about eighteen years of age, whose person was in almost every respect captivating: she was rather above the middle size for height, strait and well proportioned through∣out, her features regular and charming, her skin admirably fair, her eyes black and expressive, her hair dark and flowing; she was of a modest, amiable and religious character, and of a family truly excellent.</P>
<P>Strephon and Eliza were of the same re∣ligion, and had natural tempers and turns of mind, in many respects, much alike. Strephon
<PB N="23" REF="028341_0018_0FD8B10F1F7F2BE0"/>
had been much more acquainted with the world than Eliza, for he had seen much company, for a man of his age. Eliza, by means of her tender parents, had been led in a course of life more re∣tired, till the age of seventeen; of consequence, her ideas and sentiments respecting matrimony, were such as she had gained from books, and from the wise and chaste conversation of her dear parents, and a few select friends of great modesty and worth.</P>
<P>Kind providence so ordered events, that Stre∣phon and Eliza became acquainted with each other, and indeed long before they had kept one anothers company; they were both in love, and both ignorant of their being beloved by each other. Their mutual feelings and conduct may be learned from the following correspondence, together with those historic sketches which are in∣terspersed through the whole scene of their Courtship, which was completed in less than two years.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I. STREPHON TO ELIZA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Eliza,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE given Miss B— I.— liberty to call on you for those volumes of Mr. Addisons works which I left with you some time since. If you have read them as much as you have an incli∣nation, you can spare them, if not, keep them still.
<PB N="24" REF="028341_0019_0FD8B1115B6A3BF8"/>
In the mean time, you shall be welcome to the other volumes of this great and elegant writer, if you will be at the trouble of calling upon my friend, and your neighbour, the Rev. Mr. C—r, in whose care I left them not long since. Per∣mit me to tell you, my dear friend, that if you treasure up an hundredth part of the excellent sentiments and beauties of expression contained in those masterly productions, you will have a rich reward for perusing them with the greatest care and diligence. To spend ones precious time and youthful thoughts principally on decorating the body and amusing the fancy, to the neglect of that far nobler part, the mind, is a blunder too common among the fair sex. Dear Eliza, it is with a pleasure not easily described, I behold you shuning this fashionable vice, and seeking those things which will inevitably render you more charming in the eyes of every man of sense, than the finest features and best turned shapes that na∣ture ever gave to a female, embellished with the gayest apparel the Indies afford. Persevere in your researches after knowledge, and you will soon get your head and heart filled—</P>

For you cannot be insensible, Strephon, that in my doing this, I assume a station most critical and delicate. However, such is the opinion I have formed of your honour and generosity, that I have presumed you will improve nothing which comes from me to my disadvantage. Perhaps I have ventured with unjustifiable confidence, too far upon the principles of friendship which have so long subsisted between you and your family▪ let this be as it may, I must tell you with all the sincerity I am mistress of, that I thank you for the books with which you were pleased to favour me, and likewise for the agreeable things you have said concerning the right understanding of them. I wish I may be so happy as to get my head and heart filled with those excellent things which surpass the glory of all those enjoyments the heedless world are panting for. I can assure you. Strephon, there is nothing I more earnestly desire, than to cultivate my mind, and regulate my affections—for,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV. STREPHON TO ELIZA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Eliza,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF I mistake not, I have heard you observe, that you were peculiarly fond of history. It has just come into my head to give you a sketch of my life from Friday last to the present time. I am sor∣ry my subject is of so melancholy a nature, how∣ever, I will comfort myself that perhaps the next time I write to you, I may have a subject more lively and entertaining. We should not know how to prize the innumerable favours of this life, were we to experience no evils while in the world.</P>
<P>Between ten and eleven o'clock on Friday last, in a very weak and languid situation of body (for you must know I have been sick since you went from home) I took my leave of your honoured parents and dear family with an heart penetrated with un∣dissembled gratitude, for the many favours they bestowed on me while at H—r. It would have been a consideration more pleasing than I am able to express, to have received a parting smile and charming look from my dearest friend, my lovely Eliza, but these were impracticable: The kindest hearts and dearest friends are sometimes ne∣cessitated to bleed alone. You were from home and knew nothing of my sickness or emotions of heart.</P>
<P>Upon the road from your fathers to the Rev. Mr. H—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my thoughts were principally em∣ployed on the various affections and mercies, pains and pleasures, enjoyments and disappoint∣ments of which I had been the subject during my
<PB N="28" REF="028341_0023_0FD8B11DD9F1E050"/>
Hanoverian visit. I could not help thinking that this visit was a picture of human life in miniature, nor forbear adoring the great Jehovah for the many useful lessons I had been taught during it. O Eliza, mankind may say what they please, but I am persuaded, that it is as impossible for us to be truly happy without real virtue, as it is for us to be rich without the possession of any thing whatever. When I arrived at my old friend's, Mr. H—s, I found his son, the scholar, from Philadelphia, and daughter from New-York, were both at home; the whole family were apparently pleased to see me so far recovered from that dreadful state of illness under which I had been labouring. When people appear happy in our company, we are naturally led to think they are our real friends: but this is not unfrequently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> delusion. In such cases we sometimes find our∣selves greatly deceived by the enchanting airs of love and friendship. O Eliza! Hypocrisy is one of the greatest blots that ever stained the dignity of man: may kind heaven ever keep you and I at the greatest remove from it.</P>
<P>I think Mrs. T— just as she was before she was married, only older—that Miss H— pants for the joys of matrimony—and that Miss P— will enter into the connubial state within ten days. At two in the afternoon I took my leave of the old gentleman and his lady, together with my merry friends, the young gentlemen and ladies, and proceeded on my way homeward a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> far as your brother B—l's, where I spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t my time with more pleasure than is common on su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> visits. It seems to me that your sister B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="29" REF="028341_0024_0FD8B11EEB93EA10"/>
woman of uncommon accomplishments; she is very agreeable in her conversation, and well worthy of the man who has chosen her for his com∣panion in life: I wish all her Papa's daughters may make women as excellent as she is.</P>
<P>My next stage was at Mr. P—'s, where I al∣ways call with peculiar pleasure. After some a∣greeable chat, I enquired for your intimate friend Miss —, who was from home. I told my friends I had been lately informed by one who pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ends to know almost every thing, that I was married to her, which raised an agreeable smile on every countenance in the room. Miss P—, however, not being at home, I was necessarily deprived of a sight of my bosom companion.</P>
<P>My next stage was at the Rev. Mr. L—s, where I was received just at dusk, with all that friendship which gladdens the heart of a weary traveller. Having supped, I walked out several rods from the house, where, in a sudden and sur∣prising manner, I was seized with a fit of languor so great, that for some time▪ I despaired of ever reaching the house again; however, by some means or other, I know not by what, I got into the house, where my good friends used every mean in their power to keep life in me, for sever∣al hours on the stretch. Miss B. your great inti∣mate and admirer, with her brother, watched with me through the night; her kindness brought my friend Eliza into full view, whose tenderness to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when formerly sick at her father's, can never be erased from my mind, while sensibility and r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ction are undestroyed. Saturday, in a melancholy and dejected frame of mind, I got
<PB N="30" REF="028341_0025_0FD8B1206571D4A8"/>
home, where I remained in this unhappy situa∣tion, till two in the afternoon of the next day, when I gained in some good degree, my natural flow of spirits, and experienced that pleasure and freedom of thought in contemplating the good∣ness and mercy of God our Saviour, which no words can fully express. O Eliza, it is in him we live, move, and have our being; and nothing ought to divert our attention from the great duty of ascribing to him glory and honour for ever and ever.</P>
<P>Thus I have given you an imperfect sketch of the most remarkable events which have happened to me since I left your Papa's: and though they may appear trifling to an indifferent person, they may administer some satisfaction to a friend. I conclude this long letter with requesting an his∣tory of your life since we had the happiness to see each other.</P>

I have asked myself a thousand times, what propriety there could be in my writing to a gentleman of your character and situation in life: my only a∣pology has been, that you were too much of a gentleman as well as friend to our family, to ex∣pose a young creature, who from friendship, had as it were, thrown herself within your power. And I am happy beyond expression to find that my judgment was not erroneous. Your last has put all my uneasy feelings to rest; I feel my cha∣racter safe in your generous hands. Be assured, my much esteemed friend (for in this style you will now permit me to address you) I most sin∣cerely thank you for those historical anecdotes concerning yourself, with which you have favour∣ed me. I do unfeignedly sympathize with you under all your sorrows, as well as rejoice with you in the participation of all those good things the God of love has bestowed on you. The re∣covery of your health, and that flow of natural spirits so common to you, together with that calmness and tranquility of mind in devotional exercises, are circumstances of too much value, to pass unnoticed by a friend.

<P>A FEW weeks after Strephon and Eliza had exchanged the foregoing letters, in the full bloom of youth, health, vigour and innocency, they had the plea∣sure of an interview at Eliza<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Father's, where un∣dissembled friendship, piety and joy, generally tri∣umph in every heart, and glow in every countenance.</P>
<P>At the first interview this couple ever had with each other, which was several years before this time, they were mutually struck with each other; but such were their circumstances that neither of them enter∣tained the least thought of ever forming any other connection, but that of friendship —However, love, innocent love, glowed in their hearts, pure as the breath of heaven.</P>
<P>On a summer's eve, being seated under a green ar∣bour, the thought for the first time sprang into Stre∣phon's mind, Why will not Eliza, the young, the charming Eliza, make thee happy, O Strephon, in the sweet bondage of honourable wedlock? As soon as the idea had gained a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance in Strephon's grow∣ing breast, he requested Eliza to spend a few hours with him that evening, in a manner they heretofore had not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne. A mixture of feelings now riotted in the heart of Eliza; and Strephon read in her lovely counte∣nance the interest he had in her affections. Eliza could not deny the request of Strephon The evening therefore was spent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a manner too tender for de∣scription.</P>
<P>Before this happy c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ple pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, Strephon propos¦ed a sec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd visit of this innocent and affectionate kind: but Eliza, with a dignity that became an angel, ref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed to comply with his request on any con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> short of his g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ang the approbation of her h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and dear Parents. The heart of Strephon was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="33" REF="028341_0028_0FD88C219AD6D1B0"/>
too much under the power of Eliza's charms, long to hesitate on a matter of such importance to his happi∣ness. And though the father of Eliza was a grave and reverend gentleman, whose presence never fail∣ed to awe the spirits of the young and sprightly, yet love gained the ascendency over the natural modesty of Strephon, who embraced the first opportunity to open the important and delicate subject to Eliza's parent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; and had the good fortune to obtain their full approba∣tion to pay his attention to their daughter as a courtier. He likewise received from the old gentleman several excellent remarks on the nature of young people's keep∣ing company with each other.</P>
<P>After which, Strephon made h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s returns to Eliza, with pleasure too great for language to express. And now the Courtship of Strephon and Eliza began to take place in form; their interviews were regularly once a week, for several months; after which the business of Strephon obliged this happy pair to part for some time. During their absence the following letters passed between them.</P>

things worthy to be treasured up in a female mind: When at the same time, there are many other things said by these ingenious and elegant writers, which I am afraid will do young ladies more harm than good: The general strain, in which these gentlemen write, favours too much of female flattery; which cannot fail of giving disgust to a lady of sensibility, and at the same time of ensnaring those of less penetration. To excite thoughts in the minds of young girls, that nothing ought to be more regarded by them than to render themselves the desirable subjects of men's pleasures during a leisure hour, is to abuse the dignity of the female mind: Will not this lead to a shameful neglect of the mind and reli∣gion, to make way for the purpose of decorating the body? If it be true, that the highest ambition a woman ought to have, is to please man (which seems to be the great theme of these writers) is it not true, they ought to be excused from know∣ledge and religion?—which is absurd, and what every lady of sense and piety must despise from the bottom of her heart. However, I am satis∣fied with your reading them, and think an inge∣nious mind ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be greatly entertained with ma∣ny things contained in them, especially those of the lower class of things worthy of a lady's atten∣tion.

<P>AGREEABLE to your desire and my prom∣ise, I embrace this opportunity of writing to you, by your friend Mr. D—, who was so o∣bliging as to spend several hours with me the day past. Forgive my not writing by the post last week; it was entirely owing to unavoidable and unforeseen events, and not to any want of respect in me—for I do assure you, that love which glows in my heart for your person, forbids my neglecting any suitable opportunity of fulfiling my engagements to you. This world is all hur∣ry, bustle, noise and nonsense, and they who are in it must be exposed to them: There are a few things, however, among the many disagreeable ones, which are truly desirable; a humble heart and a bosom companion, are things truly excel∣lent—these I am in great need of, but I consider them as peculiar gifts of heaven, and to heaven I must look for them. Perhaps you may be in the same condition with myself; if so, let us lay our accounts together, and see if we cannot so regu∣late matters as to obtain them.

<P>I wish her to be the favourite child of respect∣able parents, educated in the Christian religion. With respect to her person, I should wish she might be above the common size of women, well-proportioned in body and limbs; her skin white and ruddy; her eyes black and sparkling; her hair brown and flowing, and her features well pro∣portioned one with the other: But what I should prize above all the rest, is a dignified mind, full of activity, generosity and meekness—unless it be some peculiar qualifications of heart, such as be∣nevolence and patience, with a soul turned for love: For if ever I match with any one in this life, I mean to love her till death.

<P>AFTER Strephon and Eliza had exchanged the foregoing letters, they were favoured, for several months together, with frequent and endearing inter∣views with each other: And upon every interview, their affections for one another encreased with the greatest rapidity: However, such were the circum∣stances of Strephon, that he was obliged to take leave of the idol of his heart, his dear Eliza, for several months. This was truly mortifying, not only to Strephon, but to Eliza, who now began to feel her happiness connected with the company of her Streph∣on. At their parting, they mutually agreed to bear each other upon their hearts, before the throne of grace, morning and evening, till kind providence should bring them together again. The sight of a couple's parting, who were so happy in each other's company, must have been truly affecting. We will leave them to their own reflections for a few weeks, and then attend to the epistolary correspondence which followed.</P>

Three times successively have I been taken down within these two months, with the intermitting fever; and am now just recovering from the last and most severe turn of all.

<P>THE good people belonging to the family, except a man servant, are all gone to church; and though it is sabbath day, I have undertaken to write a few lines to my dearest friend. Yester∣day morning I proposed to set out for H—on the morrow; but to my great mortification, be∣fore eleven o'clock on that day, I was confined with my old disorder: This is the fourth severe turn of the fever I have experienced since we parted: When a kind providence will indulge me with health to pursue my delightful employ∣ment, God only knows: Within these six weeks past I have been bereaved of an affectionate mother, and five brethren and sisters; they all died suddenly, and in close succession to each other. Oh, Eliza, all earthly enjoyments are passing away; they are on the wing of time, and

The silent watches of the night will witness the fulfilment of my solemn en∣gagement to bear you on my heart at the throne of grace. May the God of love inspire our hearts with love unfeigned to himself, who is the foun∣tain of blessedness.—Without this, no enjoyment of any kind can save us from complete wretch∣edness and everlasting despair. Should you say I write like a preacher instead of a lover—I an∣swer, I mean to do nothing on God's holy day inconsistent with seriousness and solemnity of spi∣rit, for the blessing of heaven is pronounced on those who keep the sabbath holy unto the Lord.

Yea, what can I think of myself, that I should write in such a strain to one, with whom I have never had any very particular acquaintance—to one, whose sentiments of friendship, and circumstances respecting the fair sex, are unknown, is wonder∣ful to myself!

<P><PB N="54" REF="028341_0049_0FD8B1516DAEDEB8"/>Believe me, much respected Sir, since the de∣parture of my Lord G—, I have many a time drawn up, as I then thought, a firm resolution never to marry again; for I had concluded that it was impossible for me ever to esteem and love another man with that fervency of affection I have had for him: My present feelings towards you have detected the delusion, and proved all such opinions of the human species to be ground∣less: However, by some means or other, I have been led to imagine that our dispositions are so much alike, that we should be more happy in a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rried than we can be in a single state. A pri∣vate interview, perhaps, may settle this matter to our mutual satisfaction. After all, I must tell you, Sir, that did I not apprehend you to be a real friend to true virtue, I should by no means wish to form any intimate connection with you. For what purpose these throbbings of heart and glowings of soul towards you, are formed in my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reast, I cannot tell. Perhaps they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o try and prove my virtue: One thing, however, is certain, they have increased from the first moment I eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> saw you.—They have grown strong, and triumph∣ed over the most faithful remonstrances and ar∣guments I have been able to bring against them▪ For, when I have seriously reflected on the dis∣agreeable circumstances which frequently attend second marriages, both with respect to parents and children—when I have meditated upon matching with one whose employment will proba∣bly call for my removal from a situation near an aged and affectionate parent; a situation, sur∣rounded with numerous relatives, tried friends
<PB N="55" REF="028341_0050_0FD8B1529BA4DBC8"/>
and entertaining acquaintance: When I have re∣flected on these things, together with the possibil∣ity of my being less happy in the married than in the single state, my affections for you have not been at all abated. These facts lead me to ob∣serve, that in my view, I am a kind of miracle, for I cannot understand my own heart. I have no doubt but I could marry in a manner equal to my situation in life, were I disposed to accept any of the offers made to me of late; but this is not agreeable to my present feelings. It is not, there∣fore, barely for a companion, but for the man whom I love, that I would change my situation. And now, perhaps, I shall be obliged to taste the bitter cup, which I have turned out to others—I mean a denial of your affections. But, O Sir, think not of me as I have foolishly thought of others in like circumstances, that it is a slight of fancy, and not love, which so powerfully moves and agitates my soul. Sure I am, I never had that love for any man, while in a single state, which now glows in my wounded heart for you. But what am I doing? In days past my indigna∣tion has been fired against those ladies, who, sin∣gle, had openly expressed their affections for any particular man; and indeed, my reason now con∣demns this practice as imprudent: But love, all powerful love, triumphs over reason, judgment and education. My heart is engaged, and I must go through with the business. Dear Sir, be so kind as to inform me, whether you are under any particular engagement to any of my sex? If you are, I am undone▪ If you are not, I shall still hope for happiness in this life. I shall be in the

greatest anxiety till I know what reception you will please to give these lines. For whether I succeed or not, my troubled heart will give me no rest till I know my fate. There are sundry reasons I could mention, which have led me to indulge the flattering idea, that a near connection with me would not be disagreeable to you—but I must suppress them. And now I begin to trem∣ble, least my freedom in writing should lessen your affections, and excite in your heart hatred for my person. When I recollect myself, I am ready to conclude my pride must be asleep—to say nothing of those delicate feelings of the fe∣male of which I once flattered myself I was am∣ply possessed—otherwise I could not have ven∣tured so far, on imprudent ground, as I have done: However, I flatter myself, that you are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gentleman of too much goodness and generosity, not to fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for a person in my situation—not to cast a mantle of love over my weakness, folly and indiscretion.

to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rm of my person, sentiments and charac∣ter. You have graced the preface to your ad∣dress with a note of admiration. That a person of your birth, education, character and circumstan∣ces in life, should write to one in my situation on so tender and delicate a subject as love, is in∣deed not unworthy of several notes of admira∣tion. That foolish modesty, fear and bashful∣ness, which prevents your sex from disclosing the tender emotions of their hearts to gentlemen of character, has ever appeared to me an imperfec∣tion. I confess, the tyrannical laws of custom, however, in many cases, have put it out of their power to do this with so much safety and honour as the rights of women demand. Aside from this, I can see no more impropriety in a lady's communicating her thoughts on love to a gen∣tleman of character, than there is in a gentleman's communicating his thoughts on the same subject to a lady of character: Therefore I beg you would give yourself no uneasiness on the account of the innocent freedom you have taken in writ∣ing to me on the most tender and delicate sub∣ject that ever employed the pen of either men or women. It is evident to my mind, notwithstand∣ing all your notes of admiration and modest apol∣ogies, that had not the secret sentiments of your heart been similar to mine, on this subject your address would have never seen the light. In∣clination, honour and piety constrain me to deal generously with you, Madam: I must, therefore, let you know, that my circumstances in life are such as forbid my marrying so soon as perhaps would be agreeable to you. To match with a
<PB N="59" REF="028341_0054_0FD8B15F8EF63728"/>
lady surrounded with so many reputable friends and acquaintance—a lady who all her life has lived in the greatest affluence—without the means of supporting her in this way of life—is a thought so grating to my feelings, and mortifying to my spirits, that it cannot be harboured in my breas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a single moment: And yet I will no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elie my own feelings. The fact is, I have no objection <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o a married life, simply considered; but believe it the happi∣est situation, all things being equal, that men or women can be in, while in this imperfect state. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> soon, therefore, as circumstances shall unite to render it proper, I am determined to be bound by the sweet and delicate chains of matrimony. You will bear it in mind, that nothing which I have said, is designed to give you the most dis∣tant intimation of the least aversion from your person and connections; on the contrary, I feel myself greatly honoured by your unsought, your unexpected esteem and love. Notwithstanding it is very probable you would choose to alter your situation much sooner than it would be consist∣ent for me to do: Moreover, I am constrained to tell you (for I must and will be generous with you) that I have my eye on a young lady, whose per∣son, temper, character and circumstances are such as invite my attention, and create in my breast a hope, that in some future period, we may be in the enjoyment of each other: this I own is little more than conjecture; however, as her name is concealed, what I have written can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of no injury to her reputation, should it be made ever so public.

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS day your endearing favour came fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to hand, and met with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>indest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eption. Before I was informed of the occurrences which delayed your answer to my first, I was naturally led to fear, that the person, for whom I had ex∣pressed so much esteem and affection, was un∣grateful. Your letter, Sir, has banished all such apprehensions from my troubled breast, and ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ed the tumults of my bleeding heart. My affec∣tion for you, Sir, is truly great; and had I not been conscious of violating the tyrannical laws of custom, my address would not have been in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>lard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with so many notes of admiration. Not∣withstanding this concession, I must do myself the justice to affirm, that I am not wholly unac∣quainted with those delicate feelings which are always put on the rack, when a modest lady de∣clares
<PB N="61" REF="028341_0056_0FD8B16353D8C7B0"/>
her affections for any particular gentle∣man—I mean in an unmarried state. What mor∣tifies me most of all is, that upon so slight an ac∣quaintance, I should suffer my heart so quick to to be carried away with your charms—and my pen so soon to disclose the melancholy tale. Be assured, Sir, nothing alloys my anxiety on this subject so much as the testimony of my own con∣science, that I have acted in sincerity. Your strictures on the tyrannical laws of custom are, in my opinion, just; and indeed are such as have not unfrequently occurred to my own mind when reflecting on this subject. Were women allowed the same liberty to communicate their affections to men, as men are to communicate theirs to the women—I believe unhappy matches would be less numerous. One thing is certain, I shall now have no reason to reproach myself with the ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>glect of any mean I thought justifiable to obtain a gentleman for my companion, for whom I had the highest esteem and the most unbounded af∣fection. Your condescension in stating your ob∣jections against altering your situation soon, gives me both pleasure and pain; pleasure to find you so obliging and sincere; and pain lest some one or more of these objections may prove an insur∣mountable obstacle to my happiness: Politeness and sincerity are not unfrequent inducements to love; and in this instance I feel their influence most sensibly: However, I cannot forbear smil∣ing at one of your ingenious objections against soon entering the conjugal state. No wonder you imagine me disposed to marry soo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er than you are inclined to do—My letter has given you
<PB N="62" REF="028341_0057_0FD8B164C0761A60"/>
sufficient reason to draw this conclusion: But, dear Sir, I am unfeignedly sincere in the decla∣ration of my affection for you—and will now tell you, that I will wait for you any period of time you may think proper to propose; provided you can assure me, you are under no engagement to any of my sex, and will attend to my request, which to me is a subject of the last importance. In the mean time I must let you know, Sir, that I never shall consent to match with any person living—no, not even with yourself, whom I love almost to distraction, without ample evidence of being loved by the same. Where affections are not reciprocal, there can be nothing of the deli∣cate nature of social and refined happiness. Va∣rious circumstances have led me to conclude you have some esteem of and love for my person: This conclusion emboldened me to address you in the manner I have done, and yet I am afraid my un∣guarded expressions will lessen your affections for me. I must be indulged in hoping you will never improve my freedom to the injury of my character, whether you finally comply with my proposals or not. It gives me much satisfaction to hear that a private interview is not disagree∣able. I shall wait with great anxiety till that happy moment arrives—when we shall have op∣portunity, without the mediums of pen and ink, to know one anothers heart. It is the fervent and unceasing prayer of my soul, that the great disposer of all things may direct you, Sir, in the line of duty respecting this delicate and momen∣tuous affair. Though I feel that I should be hap∣py in forming with you the nearest connection in
<PB N="63" REF="028341_0058_0FD8B16983B416F0"/>
life, yet I cannot desire you to act contrary to your duty or your inclination.</P>
<P>Before I conclude this letter, I must observe, that your generosity will prompt you to pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>over my imperfections, and acknowledge my sincerity, as well as to plead with your God that I may be truly resigned to the will of that providence which regulates all things in the wisest and best manner. The continuation of a correspondence with you, is what I sincerely wish, provided it meets with your cordial approbation. With the greatest sin∣cerity, I beg leave to subscribe myself</P>

<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favour of the 13th instant, came safe to hand on the last Sabbath. I should have an∣swered it before now had it been in my power. Last Saturday, as you have doubtless heard, I was taken down with my old disorder, the intermitting fever.—This turn of the fever has proved more severe than any I have experienced heretofore. I am, however through the kind hand of provi∣dence, so far relieved from pain, as to be able to set up and write a few lines to my much respect∣ed friend.</P>
<P><HI>Dear Madam,</HI> The careful perusal of your se∣cond letter, has raised a doubt in my mind, whe∣ther you properly understood my first letter to you: Whether I was so explicit as the case re∣quired, I will not undertake to affirm. You will please to recollect, however, that among the seve∣ral reasons I offered for not chusing to marry ve∣ry speedily, I mentioned a young lady on whom I had fixed my eye, and for whom I had some regard; in the enjoyment of whom, I might, in some future period, be exceedingly happy. This, it is true, was mentioned as something entirely conjectured: However, from these representa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions, I imagined you would natu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lly draw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conclusion not far from the truth, <HI>viz.</HI> that I had n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> particular inclination to pay my addresses to yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as suitor; but as a friend; for w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om I had a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unfeigned esteem, and to whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> felt myself un∣der

peculiar obligations for that regard you have expressed for my person. Upon these principles I was ready to comply with your requests, both as to a private interview and familiar correspon∣dence. Whether you understood me in this manner, you will please to let me know in your next, Notwithstanding all this, I most seriously declare, that I know not, but on a farther ac∣quaintance, you may appear infinitely more love∣ly in my view than ever I have appeared in yours, or than any of your sex have ever appear∣ed in mine. I am certainly much pleased with that innocent and undisguised freedom—with those glows of modesty—with that happy talent of communicating your sprightly thoughts on the tender and delicate subject of love—as well as with your turn for poetry and religion; which you have exhibited in the scene you have been acting. Cultivate, my dear friend, by every possible mean, these excellent talents, and they will not fail of commanding the attention of ev∣ery man off sense, with whom you form an ac∣quaintance.

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE this moment received your letter of the 19th instant—for which I give you many thanks. The restoration of your health de∣mands my gratitude and joy, and they shall not be suppressed. Now, Sir, I will inform you, that I believe there is no misunderstanding between us. When I read your first letter, I was willing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o hope you were possessed of that tender and generous passion which heretofore has, and still does, so powerfully agitate my soul; for you can∣not be insensible that we naturally hope for those things we most fervently desire. It is an old adage, that love has no eyes; and this reminds me of my stupidity, in not taking your ideas from your first letter, however, you will forgive me, if I say you were not so explicit as my sincerity▪ frankness and love required. Be assured, dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sir, my tender and affectionate feelings for you have by no means left me on my disappointment Virtuous love yet glows in my bleeding hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with an irresistible sway.

love and affection are things quite different from the natural glows of heart which graceless persons experience towards each other: but you are sensible, Sir, that when two persons experi∣ence natural affections judiciously mingled with spiritual ones, they rise to the highest pitch of happiness they are capable of in time: This I have hoped might be our case—for I know my love to you, Sir, has been and still is sincere and ve∣hement, as well as virtuous; and although I may have been unguarded in my expressions, and per∣haps imprudent in my conduct (which are cir∣cumstances truly mortifying) yet I cannot reproach myself of doing that, which, at the time, I was conscious was very criminal. Had you not been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igh in the esteem of my greatest friends, as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> myself, prudence might have triumphed over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e clamors of my bleeding heart, and saved me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om that dilemma into which I have plunged, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d out of which I know not how to extricate myself with honour.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Courtship of <HI>EMILIUS</HI> and <HI>OLIVA,</HI> Ameri∣can Youth; together with an account of <HI>OLIVA</HI>'s death.</HEAD>
<P>EMILIUS was a gentleman of taste and information. Oliva was a young lady of good family; possessed of those charms, which at the same time, awe and enrapture the beholder. Her features, shapes and turn of mind, as well as her prospects in life, were exactly such as Emilius wished to find in the lady with whom he chose to match. And though Emilius was several years older than Oliva, he had not completed the knowledge of that profession upon which he had fixed for life. Oliva's youth on the one hand, afforded Emilius time to accomplish this impor∣tant business—and on the other, herself time to gain those personal embellishments, which Emi∣li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s wished to find in the object of his love. The circumstances of these youth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing thus situated, Emilius proposed his addresses to Oliva, who, by the approbation of her parents, gave her consent to treat him as a suitor. After enjoying intimate

and frequent interviews with Oliva, for several months on the stretch, Emilius was obliged to reside several hundred miles from the object of his affections. The following letters and historic sketches will display their mutual feelings to∣wards each other.</P>

<P>IT is with pleasure that I inform you, that I am in health, and that I hope you enjoy the same blessing. I am disappointed in journeying to the southward so soon as I expect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d when we parted. However, should no unforeseen accident prevent, I shall set out on the morrow. I need not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll you how much I esteem and love you, and how anxious I am you should obtain all those im∣provements of your mind, and embellishments of your person, for which you so vehemently thirst.

Nothing would give me more pain, than to find you patterning after these giddy and heedless creatures; you will therefore excuse me while I urge upon you the frequent and careful perusal of those writings which are infallible. Even now, at this late period of the age of the world, there are no volumes so full of important ideas—ideas so entertaining and su∣blime, as the scriptures of divine truth. Do you wish to obtain just ideas of the great creator and governor of the universe—here you may find them to perfection. Does your anxious heart en∣quire what course of life is most agreeable to the best of beings—here you have it fairly delineated. Do you wish to know the only method of salva∣tion—here you have it displayed in all its charms and beauties; yea, in these sacred writings, we have life and immortality brought to light.

<SALUTE>Much esteemed Oliva,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with peculiar pleasure I devote this late hour of the night to your service. My thoughts and affections are fixed on you, as the most agree∣able object in the whole circle of creation. Had I wings, I would soon fly to your distant apart∣ment, and embrace my dearest Oliva, in all the modest forms which love and virtue dictate. In former times my heart never so panted for an in∣terview with my dearest creature, as it has done within these six weeks past. You will excuse me if I tell you that it ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pleased the God of all grace, to impress my mind with a greater sense of divine things, than I have ever heretofore ex∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rienced. My heart is fixed: I am no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> de∣termined to shape my course for the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of
<PB N="78" REF="028341_0073_0FD8B187E82F0878"/>
glory. What I most earnestly desire of you, is, that you would accompany me to the paradise above—where immortal youth blooms—love tri∣umphs—and every tear is wiped away: Though the road which leads thither, is strait and narrow, yet it deprives us of no pleasures, but such as are beneath the dignity of man—such as are low, vi∣cious and diabolical. I am unwilling to leave you walking after the course of this vain world; for I most sincerely love you, and as sincerely pant for your everlasting welfare. Your tempta∣tions to vanity and irreligion, I confess are great and powerful: Youth, beauty and worldly pros∣pects of happiness here, which you possess above many of your sex, all conspire to work out your ruin: And what renders your situation more dangerous than all the rest, is that circle of con∣stant admirers, and subtle flatterers, with which you are perpetually surrounded.</P>
<P>Pause then, a moment, my dearest creature, and set the excellencies of real religion before your eyes; perhaps they may sway your mind to a life of humility and undissembled piety, which is of more value than all this wide world affords. Rude and trifling company is more frequently attended with greater evil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than young people in general imagine. Be therefore on your guard against the enchanting influence of the bad ex∣amples of the young, the beautiful, the gay and fashionable part of the world; otherwise you may be caught in the snare, and led captive at the will of the great enemy of all virtue. Think not, however, that I suppose you can, at all times, with decency, shun such unprofitable company;
<PB N="79" REF="028341_0074_0FD8B18F9E835338"/>
it is not at all probable: The part, then, which you have to act, is to guard against its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernici∣ous effects.</P>
<P>When we parted, I expected to have seen you again this fall; but events respecting me, in a course of providence, have so turned up, that I now despair of doing myself this pleasure. Whe∣ther ever we shall see one another again is en∣tirely uncertain. Wishing you all that happiness you are capable of enjoying, I beg leave to sub∣scribe myself</P>

<P>HAD I not given you my word, that after re∣ceiving two letters from you I would write you one, I should not have troubled you with this insignificant scrawl. To tell you the truth, Emilius, your affectionate, polite and instructive epistle, have been received with more pleasure than I chuse to express with pen and ink.

Be assured, Sir, I am not wholly insensible of the danger arising from a circle of flatterers: It has been my study what use to make of them; and, upon the whole, I must say, they have been the dangerous means of leading me to prize an open and candid friend more highly than ever I should have done with∣out them. I am mortified at the news of your being necessarily detained so long from the com∣pany of your best friends. May you be blessed and succeeded in all your enterprizes.

How lovely is the change—how charming is the sight to all the friends of Zion! O Oliva, let the <HI>one thing needful</HI> have the uppermost room in thy tender heart. What are all earthly enjoyments—what are all the glories of this transitory world, com∣pared to the sublime and satisfactory pleasures of real religion? Will not true religion improve your mind—grace your person, and add ten thou∣sand beauties to those which you now possess? Will she not give you that peace of conscience and joy of heart which are inexpressible and full of glory? Real religion will fit you for this and for the coming world; she will prepare you to meet with fortitude all the afflictions, and improve all the mercies of this life; and what is more, she will sit you for a state of everlasting glory. O that I were with you, then I could speak of these great things in a manner I cannot write. My heart has been remarkably affected of late.—If religion be a delusion, it is surely a pleasant de∣lusion: Therefore you will forgive me, though my letter should appear more lik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a sermon than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re epistle of a common lover—for I

With respect to the Saviour of sinners, can you say, he is the chiefest of ten thousand, he is altogether lovely? O set me a seal on thine arm, as a seal on thine heart, for love is stronger than death! Is the daily language of your heart for God— the living God? If these be the views of your mind, and exercises of your heart, you must be happy beyond expression: On the contrary, if nothing of this nature be sound in you▪ your state must be awfully dangerous!

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR long and entertaining letter of the 14th of the last month, I have received with pe∣culiar pleasure; and now embrace the first mo∣ment which presents, to make out some kind of answer to it. I heartily wish I could compose with that freedom and elegancy you do▪ then would I give you a long answer; but I must be content to communicate my ideas in a clumsy and inel∣egant style. Pardon my imperfections, and you will secure my heart. I am heartily rejoiced my honoured papa has been so good as to inform you of my welfare. I have written and thrown away several letters since my sickness; the reason of this conduct has been altogether owing to my
<PB N="89" REF="028341_0084_0FD88C464EE66460"/>
want of opportunity to convey them to you; and it is entirely uncertain whether this ever reaches you; therefore you will accept of a short and imperfect answer. Be assured, that it is with no small pleasure, that I find myself able to inform you that my health is perfectly restored. Oh how thankful ought I to be to the great disposer of all events, for this display of his goodness and mercy to an unworthy wretch. Many, many of my fellow mortals have been cut down as cum∣bers of the earth, and lodged in the silent grave, since I was first seized with my late bodily indis∣position. O Emilius! help me to praise the great preserver of man, for his distinguishing goodness to an unworthy and helpless creature. With re∣spect to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lemn and pointed questions you have asked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> concerning my love to religion— all I have to say is, my reason and conscience tell me I ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be able to answer them in the affirmative—But alas, my wretched heart stands in the way. One thing, however, you may de∣pend upon as fact; and that is, I have never had more serious thoughts on the great and important things of real religion, than I have had during my late sickness: And to tell you the truth, your pious letter has largely contributed to increase these solemn impressions on my naturally vain and trifling mind; but I am afraid they will soon wear away, and leave me worse than they found me. Oh the wretched influence of this vain and unsatisfactory world! How powerfully it allure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our imaginations, and commands our affections. O Emilius, on these accounts I should be more happy to see you, than ever I have been h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reto∣fore.
<PB N="90" REF="028341_0085_0FD8B19CE08D1588"/>
In the midst of your rapturous description of the happiness of the married pair, you check yourself for thus writing to one, whom you knew not but was then solacing herself in the embraces of some favoured and unknown youth: Give yourself no concern, Sir, about any such imagi∣nations; and believe me incapable of acting a part so base, so contrary to my most solemn in∣gagements to you. The following lines appear to me very beautiful:</P>
<L>"Be wise, cut off long cares</L>
<L>From thy contracted span.</L>
<L>E'en whilst we speak, envious time</L>
<L>Doth make swift haste away;</L>
<L>Then seize the present, use thy prime,</L>
<L>Nor trust another day."</L>
<P>My parents enjoy their usual health; Anna and Charlotte are well, and as w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ever: Your friends in general, in this town, are all in pros∣perous circumstances. Wishing you every bless∣ing you are capable of enjoying in this and the coming world, I beg leave to say</P>

<P>UPON the reception of the above letter, Emilius concluded to drop his important and delightful studies, and spend a few weeks with his enchanting Oliva, from whom he had endured an absence so long and painful. At their meeting, their mutual joys were expressed, not by the cold and lifeless language, which mere words compose—but by sparkling eyes, glowing countenances, and actions the most polite and endear∣ing.
<PB N="91" REF="028341_0086_0FD8B1A160A481A0"/>
The pious and dignified conduct of Emilius, on this occasion, was too perspicuous to pass unno∣ticed by the honoured parents of Oliva, who now be∣gan to feel themselves happy in their daughter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s con∣nection with a gentleman of so much worth: Every thing, of course, conspired to render them as happy in each others company as they could reasonably wish. Their circumstances, persons, amusements and devo∣tions, were such as mutually and constantly charmed each other, as well as entertained and delighted a numerous circle of friends and relatives: Every one who beheld their chaste, polite and dignified conduct, admired—and some even envied their hap∣piness. In circumstances so delightful, the time al∣loted by Emilius for this visit rolled away imper∣ceptibly, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> melancholly moment too soon arrived when he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to take his leave of the idol of his heart, and repair to his books, to complete his knowledge of the profession which he had chosen for life.—This was a scene too tender for description: We shall therefore give the reader liberty to indulge his imagination, and pursue the correspondence which afterward took place between these happy lovers.</P>

<SALUTE>My worthy dear Oliva,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I make it a point of no small importance to let no suitable opportunity pass without writing to you, so I would thank you to conduct towards me. This attention to each other, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what we have laid ourselves under mutual obli∣gations to perform. Every letter received from you is esteemed by me as a fresh evidence of your friendship; and I would have you esteem every letter you receive from me, not only as a token of friendship, but of real love. Of your friendship, I have looked for more frequent tes∣timonies of this kind than I have received; and sometimes have been almost r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ady to conclude, that my sweetest creature is not so a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>entive to her engagements as she ought to be: the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I check myself and fondly attribute her neglect to
<PB N="94" REF="028341_0089_0FD8B1A6A36BE2E8"/>
the want of suitable conveyance, rather than to any want of inclination to gratify her friend and lover. Be so kind as to free me from these per∣plexing thoughts, by a long letter filled with your sentiments upon the most important subject—I mean religion. Say not that religion is an un∣fashionable subject for the pens of youth and lovers—for it certainly lies near my heart, and I hope is not far from yours. I have not forgot∣ten the happy moments we spent, when last to∣gether, on the excellenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of this dignified and sublime theme—and hope your memory retains the same things we then caused to pass before our minds. I know that young people, especial∣ly lovers, must be indulged in dwelling on the charming subjects of beauty, frien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ship and love; but this is no reason they should not embrace re∣ligion, and frequently write to each other upon its divine and superlative beauties: for without this one thing needful all other possessions are nothing, less than nothing, and vanity. Young minds are too apt to imbibe unfavourable ideas of this glorious subject: they are too apt to con∣clude that religion will mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all their pleasures, and render themselves undesirable objects of the love and esteem of the most valuable youth in the land: but remember this is not only far from the truth, but an insinuation of the great enemy of all righteousness, who always strives to paint those ways which are ways of peace, and those paths which are paths of pleasantness, as too rug∣ged and thorny for the tender feet of the young and beautiful▪ Reflecting upon our first moth∣er's decep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion by this great enemy of all righte∣ousnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—</P>

<L>My dear Oliva fly;</L>
<L>Our parents found the snare to strong,</L>
<L>Nor should the children try.</L>
<P>But to drop this, and pass to a subject more cheerful.—In the midst of that large acquain∣tance which I have had with mankind, I have found it expedient that my peculiar friends should be but few, and well chosen. I have sought to associate with those only who were po∣lite, decent, sensible and virtuous. By this mean I have been often screened from that imprudent and vicious course of conduct, which otherwise I should probably have adopted; and perhaps brought upon myself disgrace, if not ruin.</P>
<P>It is my serio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> opinion, that young people in general, in no way expose themselves so much, as by keeping company with beautiful young, heed∣less and vicious youth. This proves beyond all contradiction, that our intimate and peculiar friends ought to be few and well chosen. There are several kinds of amusement peculiar to youth, which, though they are not always criminal, are notwithstanding very inconvenient: These I have frequently pointed out to you in days past: I will now content myself with mentioning one fol∣ly, too frequent among youth, which I have not heretofore laid before you: It is this—For a la∣dy to suffer several gentlemen to share her pecu∣liar attention in close succession one after another: Or a gentleman to divide his affections and at∣tentions among several of the fair sex. This shameful and disingenious practice has a tenden∣cy to ruin one's heart, and prevent it for ever
<PB N="96" REF="028341_0091_0FD8B1AD5C91DBA8"/>
fixing on a single object in that manner which is convenient for the consugal relation. It is no less an argument of wisdom to di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinguish between proper and improper conduct, than an argument of virtue to reject the former and adopt the lat∣ter. The study of prudence is worthy of every young mind; and always pays double wages to those who exercise themselves in this way.

<P>It has been with some degree of confusion, I have made your compliments to my parents. I wish for the future, you would excuse me from a task so trying to my nerves. Your advice, to be so much on my guard against the pernicious in∣fluence of youthful amusements, as to leave room in my heart for pious and devotional exercises, demands my unfeigned gratitude. The lines of poetry, with which you conclude this letter, are really charming; and indeed the whole letter is high in my estimation, except it be the last line—
"And you may prove a joyful wife."

Your declara∣tion, that my letters are received with pleasure, gives me no small satisfaction, for I know not a single creature within the whole circle of crea∣tion, that I should more wish to please than my ever lovely Oliva. Please still to give my let∣ters a favourable reception, till the period shall arrive, when we shall meet and embrace each

other, not barely as friends, but as unfeigned lov∣ers. You kindly intimate▪ that another six week's visit, at your papa's, would meet with the appro∣bation of a numerous circle of friends, and prove advantageous to myself.—I am much of your way of thinking, and will as soon as existing circum∣stances shall admit, do myself the pleasure to comply with your proposal; for, depend upon it, you share a too large proportion of my thoughts and affections, not to command my utmost atten∣tion. However, I must check my fond expec∣tations—knowing
there are ten thousand acci∣dents and misfortunes which may prevent our ever meeting again.—Death, that enemy to all our earthly enjoyments, may, before we are a∣ware, snatch you from me, or me from you.

Oliva, I am charmed with that rapid im∣provement you have made within the last six months, in your hand writing, and in composi∣tion.—An improvement in these particulars is an advantage which attends friends and lovers resid∣ing at a distance from each other.—You will not think it strange if I urge you on in this com∣mendable course; for you know, from your first acqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ntance with me, that it has been a matter which has lain near my heart Should you ask
<PB N="103" REF="028341_0098_0FD8B001E9D06050"/>
why I interest myself so much in your making progress in these improvements, my answer is, because I love you.

<SALUTE>My love,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT you may not think my attention to you is abated, I have enclosed several let∣ters to you which were written some time since, but not sent for want of suitable conveyance; be so kind as to give them all an answer in your next. I have ten thousand things in my head, which I could better tell you than write, were I in your agreeable company. Perhaps you may think my affections for you are greatly cooled— or I should have otherwise visited you before now.—Believe me, dearest of creatures, could I do myself this honour without making a sacrifice greater than you would wish me to do, I would be upon the wing immediately for B—m: however, I have fixed on the month of July next for this purpose. In the mean time, I shall let no opportunity of writing pass unimproved, in furnishing you with all that information re∣specting my person and circumstances, which you can desire—and beg you not only to adopt, but to persevere in the same line of conduct towards me.</P>
<P>I enjoy my health to a very great degree, and in many respects am exceedingly happy; there being nothing which troubles me much, except it be the want of my dearest Oliva's company. In my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> you were entertained with several re∣marks on the improvement of your already im∣proved

I would now observe, that it is a matter of importance, that those who are both a∣ble and inclined to make a shining figure in life, should be under all the advantages of improv∣ment—while it is of no consequence to those who are of a different make and turn of mind: for let their advantages for improvement be what they may, they will never mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any considera∣ble progress in knowledge. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> young lady of beauty, genius and fortune, should be careful to lay hold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f every mean to improve her mind, polish her manners, and set off her person with dignity and grace; otherwise she will do herself great dishonour in the view of persons of sense and r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>finement—for she had it in her power to make a shining figure among the upper classes of the human species, but through negligence falls far below what nature intended for her.

<P>IT is with more pleasing emotions of heart, than I will undertake to express, that I now inform you of the welcome reception of two en∣dearing and instructive letters—the one dated January 1, 1773; in which you are so kind as to wish me an happy new year—and the other dated March 18.</P>
<P>I can never be thankful enough for that un∣wearied and generous pains you have so long taken to render my person, mind and carriage, agreeable to men of taste, virtue and refinement; as well as for that concern you have exhibited for my happiness beyond this transitory state: these things I shall set down as real tokens of friendship. Be assured, my worthy Emilius, you are not dealing with an ungrateful girl. I have for more than eighteen months, carefully attend∣ed to those improvements, which you have so earnestly recommended; and I hope I have not been altogether unmindful of the one thing, which above all others, is needful.</P>
<P>I sincerely thank you for those lines on beauty; and think the sentiments are just, and the diction elegant; and should have been perfectly pleased with the whole, had one word only been omitted —but I will say no more, for I am determined

<P>A LITTLE after the date of the foregoing letter, the happy Emilius and lovely Oliva, enjoyed the plea∣sure of several weeks interview with each other. Their joys on this occasion were b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tter expressed, by the glows of their countenances, the sparkling of their eyes, and their polite and endearing behaviour to each other, than pen and ink could do were they in the hand of an angel. They had been loving each other at several hundred miles distance, for more than ten months, without the sight of one anothers faces; during which period, their persons and minds had received many embellishments which served to heighten their mutual esteem; and now they had an opportunity of feasting their eyes and hearts on each others personal beauties and mental accomplishments, which they did with transports too great to escape the notice of a numerous circle of friends and relatives.</P>
<P>The fond hearts of Oliva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s parents were now ex∣panded with generosity and benevolence; they were likewise relieved of ten thousand anxious thoughts re∣specting their daughter, who for several months be∣fore, seemed to take no pleasure in any company of any kind. The old mansion house became the resort of the most polite and improving company in the town. The happy lovers felt themselves standing at the next door to the summit of all earthly joys. The modes of entertainments, diversions and improvements adopted on this occasion, were such only as wisdom and virtue dictated. Thus Emilius and Oliva enjoyed each oth∣ers company for more than six weeks together; dur∣ing which time, they gained all that satisfaction with respect to the affections of each other they could wish; and consequently entered into a most solemn engage∣ment to mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y as soon as the circumstances of Emili∣us

In circumstances so agreeable the time alloted for the performance of this v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> passed away insensibly, both to Emilius and Oliva. How∣ever, when the period fixed on for their separation was come, these happy lovers, with glowing hearts, clasping hands and flowing tears, commended each other to the care of a kind and tender providence, and parted. We shall now leave them to their own reflections, and pursue their literary correspondence, which closed their coartship.</P>

I asked him what he meant— He answered, Miss <HI>Oliva</HI> is pining, and▪ I be∣lieve, unwell; and this was all I could get out of the philosopher on this subject, except that you looked unwell.

He answered, delicate ladies are not apt to communicate all their feelings to their suitors. Upon the whole, he talked with me till I heartily wished myself at B—m—where I might judge of the health of my dearest friend.

<SALUTE>Ever dear and charming Oliva,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOURS of May the 15th is this moment come to hand. I thank you for the several pieces
<PB N="121" REF="028341_0116_0FD8B02C1698C270"/>
of news you have been pleased to give me; and heartily sympathize with my friend in the loss of his leg. Old people who have been once mar∣ried, can better tell what they mean by second marriages, than young one's—I will therefore let them alone. Your poetical flight would not have met with my approbation, had it not been accom∣panied with that most solemn declaration in the beginning of your letter, that my wishes concern∣ing the crowning of the year, perfectly accord with your feelings. I am glad you have recover∣ed that natural cheerfulness, which is so peculiar to yourself; and wish you may never lose it a∣gain; for it must be a continual feast—this I can say by experience. I know what it is to be cheerful, and within these three weeks past I have felt what it is to be melancholy. Sometime since you were in this situation; now I am taking my turn. I could not before sympathize with you as I can now; what the reason is, I can give no ac∣count: but one thing is certain, I have no com¦fort of my life. My mind is so agitated with anxious thoughts, and perplexing fears, by night and by day, concerning you, that I get no rest. I am afraid we are never to see one another a¦gain; and that one or both of us, must soo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> launch into a boundless eternity! How solemn is the thought! The period on which we have fixed to consummate our joys, is only six weeks from the present moment. A thousand times since I saw you, I have looked forward to tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra, with raptures too great for description—bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as! my feelings now tell me, we shall never be∣hold

one another again. Even while I write, my heart bleeds, my tears flow, my very soul trembles! How vain is this transitory world; how uncertain are all earthly enjoyments! Our affec∣tions have been mutual and sincere—by many circumstances almost peculiar to ourselves, they have been tried and proved genuine. I thank you for all that unseigned friendship and gener∣ous love you have exercised towards me for sev∣eral years past. Thus, agreeable to your request, and my solemn promise, I have disclosed to you the feelings of my distressed soul.</P>
<P>Adieu then, my dearest creature, adieu—a long, an eternal adieu. I give myself—I give you afresh to the great disposer of all events. May heaven's best blessings descend and rest up∣on you forever. Once more I bid you an ever∣lasting adieu.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear and much respected Emilius,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE heavy tidings for you—My daughter, your Oliva, is no more. The last Sabbath she was so well as to attend the funeral of her youngest sister Charlotte, and the Tuesday fol∣lowing was a corpse. Our babe died with the canker—<HI>Oliva</HI> caught the dreadful malady; and being exceeding restless, her physician judged it expedient to give her a portion of opium; after receiving of which, she appeared for a while, to be in a sweet sleep, and our hopes of her restor∣ation were greatly revived: But to our astonish∣ment, before the time we expected she would awake, she ceased to breathe. Thus she is gone! forever gone! and we must submit to the Divine pleasure without a murmuring thought. Please to excuse my freedom, and come and see us as soon as convenient. Though our daughter is no more, you may depend on finding a father in her father. I unfeignedly thank you for all that friendship and love you have exercised towards her. Mrs. <HI>Calybs</HI> and <HI>Anna</HI> send their love to you: Be so kind as to pray for us, that our af∣flictions may be sanctified, and we made better by them. May God support you, as he has sup∣ported us, under this great and trying dispensation of his holy providence.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with pleasure intermingled with pain too great for pen and ink to express, that I ac∣knowledge the receipt of your letter, dated May 30, 1774. Your troubled imagination, and anx∣ious heart, are exact pictures of my own; for although, when I wrote to you last, my mind was much more calm than it had been some time before, yet, before I received your last, my dis∣tress returned upon me with double force. I have been preparing every thing for that happy moment, when you and I should participate of those virtuous and refined joys, of which none but true lovers are capable.—But, alas! all my labour, as well as my love for you, is in vain.— You feel that we are never again to see each oth∣er, and so do I. You have taken an everlasting farewel of me, and so I must treat you.—Which of us is soon to die—or whether both of us must speedily leave this world, are things unknown to

me; all I can say is, I have it impressed on my mind, that we shall behold one anothers faces, in this world, no more. I thank you a thousand times over for all that attention, friendship and love, you have shown for me, since the first mo∣ment of our acquaintance. Should I be called away before you are, love my dear parents, for they have ever esteemed and loved you. But what am I saying! I know not but we are both under a delusion, and may yet realize all our ex∣pected joys. However, my heart tells me some∣thing great is about to take place.

<P>YOU will excuse me if I call you father. Your letter has brought me tidings, the most me∣lancholy that ever wounded a tender and bleed∣ing heart. Is it indeed true, that <HI>Oliva</HI>—the young, the beautiful, the virtuous, the charming,
<PB N="126" REF="028341_0121_0FD8B0398CC2CCC8"/>
the all accomplished <HI>Oliva</HI> is no more!—Then break thou my heart, and burst ye mine eyes with sorrow—and be thou my soul dead to this world; for what is all creation to thee, when thy <HI>Oliva</HI> is no more. O mourn, mourn thou for thy <HI>Oliva,</HI> the idol of thine heart—for she is snatched from thine eager embrace. She has winged her way to the world of spirits—</P>
<L>But hark—the voice of reason cries</L>
<L>God lives—while thy <HI>Oliva</HI> dies.</L>
<L>'Tis joyful truth—let grief be stay'd,</L>
<L>For Nature's debts must all be paid.</L>
<P>Alas! what have I done, that I should be marked out for such peculiar afflictions? O Lord, did I love that dearest of creatures too much, that thou hast taken her away in the bloom of life? Was she not formed to charm my soul? and hast thou not cut her down to shew me the emptiness and uncertainty of all earthly enjoy∣ments? Have I not sought her welfare, as well as my own, in all my intercourse with her? And have I not also sought thy glory in the connec∣tion which now is no more? O Lord, I appeal to thee, for thou knowest the heart▪—but I must not forget that I am a poor imperfect crea∣ture; and though <HI>Oliva,</HI> above all others, was formed to charm my heart; and though I may have been upon my guard against loving her more than I ought to love any creature, yet God must be justified in his conduct, and I must sub∣mit to his holy pleasure.</P>
<P>Dear Sir, forgive me, if I have lost sight of you for a moment. My feelings are such as none
<PB N="127" REF="028341_0122_0FD8B03B29446078"/>
can conceive, who have not drank of the bitter cup I am now drinking. O my dearest, lovliest, sweetest creature, must my ears never more be charmed with the music of thy tongue, and my eyes never more be blessed with the beauties of thy form! My grief is too great for expression; I cannot suppress its overflowings: however, I will try to be calm and resigned—God has done nothing unrighteous—hush then my heart, be still, and know that God is the Lord.</P>
<P>Dear Sir, did the physician who administered the fatal dose, understand his business? Was he friendly to your family—was he himself? O that I had been present, and snatched it from those inchanting lips that received it, and saved the lovely creature from the deadly draught. But no more. I mean, dear Sir, to see you soon, when I shall enquire into all circumstances, and satisfy my wounded soul. But, alas—this will be the exact time when your daughter and I once expected to be triumphing in all the innocent joys of the conjugal state. O ye heavens, what a reverse is here! My dear parents, (for so you will permit me to address you) may he who gave you the most beautiful, virtuous and amiable child that ever lived, and has taken her away in the bloom of life, also give you grace to say, <HI>The Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away, and blessed be the name of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>The oldest and the youngest of your dear children are now no more; you have one who now lives: O that, like <HI>Anna</HI> of old, she may prove a favourite of heaven.</P>

<P>NOT long after the preceding letter was written, Emilius visited the disconsolate parents of his depart∣ed Oliva. The scene was truly affecting to all who beheld it. The good Mr. Calybs and his lady re∣ceived Emilius with all the demonstrations of love that tender parents could receive a son who had been long absent. They mingled sorrows with joys; their hearts bled; their tears flowed, till weeping could be endured no longer. At this solemn and tender interview, Mr. Calybs delivered Emilius the forego∣ing letters, which he had written to Oliva; togeth∣er with that which Oliva had written and directed to Emilius but a few days before her exit. The emotions of Emilius' heart, on reading this letter, exceeded all description.</P>
<P>The next day the whole family of Mr. Calybs went, in company with Emilius, to mourn over the grave of his Oliva. No language can express the sorrows of Emilius heart on this solemn and tremen∣dous occasion. Mr. Calybs presented Emilius with a suit of mourning, together with some of the favour∣ite rings and jewels of his departed daughter, before they parted.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Courtship of <HI>BRAGADOTIUS</HI> and <HI>NUM∣SKULDIA.—Not</HI> for example—but warning.</HEAD>
<P>THE following anecdotes of the actual Courtship of Bragadotius and Numskuldia, are recorded, not for the example, but for the amuse∣ment of the American youth.</P>
<P>As to parentage, education, turns of mind, and courses of conduct, Bragadotius and Numskul∣dia, were much on a level. At an early period in life they formed an acquaintance, which final∣ly issued in what they esteemed <HI>love</HI>—and marri∣age was its consequence.</P>
<P>While Bragadotius viewed himself the most accomplished young gentleman within the circle of his acquaintance—Numskuldia considered her∣self a lady inferiour to none, within the circle of her knowledge. Bragadotius, without counsel, felt himself equal to the important trust of pro∣viding a companion every way suited to his taste and views in life: and Numskuldia became the
<PB N="130" REF="028341_0125_0FD8B044A0AD5370"/>
object of his highest ambition. For notwith∣standing many fair creatures fell under the notice of his eye, none appeared to him so charming, none proved so captivating, as his incomparable Numskuldia. Contrary to the wholesome coun∣sels and solemn commands of his parents, Braga∣dotius was frequently out whole nights on what he called his own business. Sometimes he was obliged to break open his father's house; at others he was necessitated to take up his lodgings with the cattle in the barn, or some out house, till the day broke and the family were up.</P>
<P>The amorous Numskuldia was under less re∣straints, than her beloved Bragadotius; which frequently chagrined, and pained him to the very heart. Bragadotius and Numskuldia were equal as to religion; for neither they nor their parents had the least appearance of any such thing.</P>
<P>The following is an Epistolary correspondence which passed between them during their court∣ship.</P>

For I am sure there was not one who cut so grand a figure as you did. Notwithstanding the last night I ever saw you, was extremely boisterous, yet after we parted, I met with your brother and several others of equal spirit, who assisted me in pulling down several signs, and filling up sundry wells, together with a number of other heroic exploits, which become gentlemen of spirit. When I came home I found all bolted and barred against me, and therefore was oblig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to take the barn. I wish you had been with me, for I assure you, I was very lonesome, and could not help thinking how I had tired myself. My father says I shall ruin myself, and disgrace my family.

<P>YOUR concern for my welfare has added ten thousand charms to all you have heretofore possessed. I believe in my soul you think a thousand times as much of what is necessary for our subsistenee in this world, as I do. However give yourself no uneasiness about my sisters run∣ing away with the old gentleman's estate. They are as deep in the mire as I am in the mud.— They have, contrary to my father's express com∣mand, kept company with two young fellows, who indeed I esteem, but <HI>he</HI> despises.

After all I wish the girls no harm: Perhaps the old gentleman's dis∣pleasure may convince them that my conduct, or, in other words, a few funny tricks, should not set the world in an uproar, and hurl confu∣sion through the earth.</P>
<P>To tell you the plain truth, my father is against my keeping the company of any body; and es∣pecially
<PB N="135" REF="028341_0130_0FD8B0516319AFF0"/>
against my keeping your company. He says I am too young to be out in the night; and wonders what I can see in Capt. <HI>Mumpy's</HI> girls, that sets me so bewitch'd; and often tells me that I shall rue the day I ever formed any acquaint∣ance with them, and a thousand other things of the same tenor. Sometimes he puts on a pleasant countenance, and says, <HI>Bragadotius,</HI> if you will be a good boy, and behave yourself well, till you are sixteen, you shall see suitable company with my approbation; but if you cannot be re∣strained now, while you are so young, you may depend upon being ruined. These are the things, my dear <HI>Numskuldia,</HI> which made me intimate in my last, that if I did not consult my own taste, I should never see you again. After all, I am de∣termined so to conduct my affairs, that if it should be my good fortune to marry you, I may be able to support you in a manner that becomes your family.</P>

My heart has asked for you a thousand times since I left home; and I will be bound yours would have bled for me had you known the difficulties I have encountered since we part∣ed. I find strangers of my taste are friendly no longer than my money holds out—which for some time has been gone. I should comply with your request by Mr. <HI>Hunter,</HI> and return immedi∣ately to B—l, were it not that our parents appear to have no inclination ever to see me a∣gain. I begin to think I am undone; and shall never return to B—l till my father has left this world; after that I may inherit his estate; for I understand he is of the opinion, that I am no more: which opinion I hope he will keep till the day of his death.</P>
<P>I thank you for that love and concern you have shewed for me; and hope in some future time I shall be able to fulfill all my engagements to you. Please to write me by the first oppor∣tunity; and let no one know where I am, and you will oblige</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. Hunter has this moment returned from the country with the joyful news that you are yet alive. All your relatives and mine, have done all in their power to persuade me that you had put an end to your life▪ They had heard a rumour from P—l, a town about fifty miles distant, that a dead person was found in a swamp, whom they concluded must be you. None can conceive the distress I have undergone since you left us. My own circumstances are truly alarm∣ing; and the thought of your death have been distressing beyond all description. I must entreat you by all the ties of friendship, and by all those solemn promises you have so frequently repeated to me, to give me an opportunity soon to see you —for I am already undone—and shall be wretch∣ed beyond all conception, if you refuse my re∣quest.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear girl,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your affectionate letter yester∣day, and thank you for rejoicing that I am a∣live. I believe there are but few people in B—l of your temper. But what do you mean by your circumstances being so alarming? I hope you are in jest. You may depend upon my giving you an opportunity to see me in a private manner, before long: for I would by no means have our relations know I am alive. I shall be at D—y, which is only ten miles dis∣tant from you, in about eight days, when I hope to know your situation more particularly. I now begin to call to mind some things which my fa∣ther, in an angry fit, once told me, that I should bring upon myself. However, be of good cour∣age, I hope all will turn out well yet.</P>

This conduct filled <HI>Numskuldia</HI> with more distress than any thing she had ever seen in her beloved <HI>Bragadotius;</HI> for her parents had now began to suspect her circumstances were truly deplorable.

At first Bragadotius utterly refused to comply with the captain's proposal; but finding he could get no bail and must go to jail immediately, listened to the tears of Numskuldia, and humbled himself be∣fore his father and the captain—who forgave him upon condition of his promising to forsake his former vicious company, and attend to busi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> which he did, and was married.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the <HI>Courtship</HI> of <HI>PARAMOND</HI> and <HI>MATILDA</HI> —the former an old <HI>Bachelor,</HI> and the latter an old <HI>Maid.</HI></HEAD>
<P>PARAMOND was a bachelor of about fifty; who, notwithstanding his large interest, had all his life feared to marry, lest he should not be able to support his family in that splendor he wished. He was a man of as good character as one could expect for a bachelor. His person was not ungraceful, though not very beautiful; his manners acceptable, allowing for the oddities peculiar to bachelors: And notwithstanding all these things, he firmly adopted a resolution to change his situation.</P>
<P>What puzzled him more than every thing else, was whether he should woo a young girl, an old maid▪ of widow. After several years reflection— for bachelors' thoughts run not very rapidly—he came to the conclusion to marry an old maid; and in the whole circle of his acquaintance (which
<PB N="144" REF="028341_0139_0FD8B0641C64DC20"/>
was by no means contracted) he could not find a fairer candidate for his affections than <HI>Matilda. Matilda</HI> was a lady of good family, and of a most excellent character; she was in reality exceed∣ingly clever—but not handsome. Her good fa∣ther left her possessed of a fortune of about four thousand pounds; which rendered her more beautiful in the eyes of Paramond than any per∣sonal qualification whatever could have done.</P>
<P>At a certain wedding, Paramond and Matilda were rallied by some of the company then present, and put in mind of the propriety of their match∣ing with each other. This so emboldened Para∣mond in the secret conclusions of his heart, that he soon paid Matilda a visit in the character of a lover; which was received with that coldness and indifferency which are peculiar to old maids: However Paramond was not discouraged, as the following correspondence will shew.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Matilda,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FOR more than thirty years since, I have had a secret flame enkindled in my breast for your person. You may remember the silver snuff box I had the pleasure to present to you when we were children. The sparkling of your
<PB N="145" REF="028341_0140_0FD8B06A8B9BAE00"/>
eyes, on that occasion, wounded my heart, and it has never been healed from that day to this. Should you ask the reason why I did not declare my passion before, I would answer because it was very great. My circumstances in life were then by no means affluent; and my love for you was too great to bring you (had it been in my power) into a situation in which you must have lived in a style less elegant than that in which you have been brought up. For more than thirty years it has been my constant study, as well as labour, to lay up money for the sole purpose of your spend∣ing it in my company. The great disposer of all events has so far succeeded my worldly enter∣prizes, that I am now worth about six thousand pounds clear of all incumbrances: This, added to the generous portion which your honoured father has left to you, may, with mutual affec∣tions for each other, render us happy for that lit∣tle space of time we have to spend in this world. I say that little space, for you must know we can∣not live long in this world.</P>
<P>Thus, my dear Matilda, I have sincerely open∣ed my heart to you, and shall wait with great anxiety, till you declare your sentiments upon this important and interesting matter. One thing more: It has always given me pleasure to know that you have uniformly rejected the most ad∣vantageous proposals of matrimony.</P>

<P>THIS is the first time I have ever undertaken to write to a gentleman on the subject of your letter, with which I was honoured last even∣ing; and it is not impossible but it may be the last. Let this be as it may, I must confess that your letter has convinced me, that old bachelors are not such cold, frozen and stupid creatures as they are generally represented. The hearts of men are hidden from the common eye, and may contain many things—yea, and agreeable things too▪ which do not fall under the notice of super∣ficial observers. Who could have thought Pa∣ramond had been a lover for more than thirty years on the stretch! I confess I am surprized; and were it not for your known character, as a man of veracity, I would not now believe you. Your letter has likewise mended my opinion of old maids; perhaps they are not such cold and despicable creatures as they have been generally represented.</P>
<P><HI>Paramond,</HI> you have filled my head, to say nothing of my heart, with a thousand thoughts, which belong to youth, and not to old age. What shall I say? I will write no more, lest I expose myself.</P>

<P>IT was with peculiar pleasure I received your obliging favour, written last Monday, and should now do myself both the honour and plea∣sure, to wait on you, were it not for the agree∣able news of the ship Nancy's arrival from the East-Indies, which I am informed has made a very great voyage, and demands my immediate attention. I hope she contains the richest silk that ever was woven, to deck my dear Matilda on a bridal day.</P>
<P>I am sincerely glad to hear that your letter to me was the first that ever you have written on the subject of mine. However, it damps my spi∣rits to hear you say, that perhaps it may be the last. I hope this is nothing more than the ef∣fect of your native modesty, and that you will

I am really charm∣ed with your judicious observations on old bach∣elors and maids; and I suppose the great reason is, because they perfectly accord with my own feelings and sentiments. I hope your head is not so filled with youthful thoughts as to disturb your repose. It is truly an excellent character you have given of our first mother, out of Milton. I am perfectly willing that you should wear this excellent character; but I must beg leave to be the wooer.—Better late than never, is an old and good maxim.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Courtship of <HI>POLYMOND</HI> and <HI>SYLVIA;</HI> the former a Widower, and the latter a Widow.</HEAD>
<P>POLYMOND was a gentleman of about thirty eight years of age—a man of a fair mind, agreeable person, ana unexceptionable charac∣ter, and a good estate. He had two children, whose genius and persons promised fair to make a shining figure in life.</P>
<P>Sylvia was a widow of thirty years of age— had four children, (two sons and two daughters) —she had no estate; but what was of more value in the view of Polymond—she was a lady of the greatest beauty, taste and piety.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding Polymond and Sylvia had been born and brought up within twenty miles of each other, and were both persons of consid∣erable notoriety, yet they had formed little or no acquaintance with one another.</P>
<P>About ten months after Polymond had buried his dear companion, he came to a firm resolu∣tion,
<PB N="155" REF="028341_0150_0FD8B079E0788000"/>
to marry again, as soon as he could suit himself: But where to find a lady that would answer his ideas of a second match, he was whol∣ly ignorant. Upon a certain public occasion, he accidentally cast his eye upon Sylvia, whose graceful appearance shaded the glory of all a∣round her; she was dressed in half mourning, and appeared with innocence and dignity, which never fails to command the attention of men of sense, judgment and taste. Polymond soon made himself acquainted with the circumstances of the charming Sylvia, and found them to be such, as emboldened him to make her overtures of es∣teem, friendship and love; and accordingly spent several afternoons in her company. The follow∣ing letters will give the reader an idea of their views, sentiments and feelings, during their Ccurtship, which terminated in about six months, after their first interview.</P>

You, dear Madam, are the first I have seen, with whom I think I could be happy in the married state. And though I am not unacquainted with many of the pretty and enchanting feelings of the young and amorous, I will not trouble you with them on this occasion.</P>

My circumstances are such, that I am pretty sure, no person calculated to suit my taste, would ever think of matching with me.

I most sincerely thank you for that esteem you profess for my person, and for that generous proposal you have made—of keep∣ing my company.

<P>YOUR answer to my last has met with my ap∣probation and esteem. I was not wholly unapprized of your circumstances, and therefore am not shocked to hear them painted in the blackest colours. I knew you had four children, on whose welfare your heart has been justly fix∣ed.</P>
<P>That you have never thought of marrying since the departure of your worthy companion, is not strange; and is no reason I should not put such a thought into your mind.</P>
<P>I will assure you, that it is far from my mind to entertain the least thought of marrying you, without making handsome provision for your children; and likewise recommending myself to your taste.</P>
<P>With respect to a man's loving a second wo∣man well enough to render the married state de∣sirable, I must say, I have never had the least doubt of such a thing. The best proof, howev∣er, of this is drawn from men of virtue and in∣tegrity, who have had experience.

<HEAD>LETTER IV. SYLVIA TO POLYMOND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY some means or other, I am more pleased with your letters than I ever expected to be with the letters of any person living. Your gen∣erous thoughts respecting my children, not only please but charm me. I must confess you have recommended yourself to my particular taste in
<PB N="160" REF="028341_0155_0FD8B088DE656AF8"/>
a manner very agreeably indeed. Your obser∣vations on the possibility of esteeming and lov∣ing several persons in succession, meet with my approbation: For although I have as yet never experienced any thing of this nature, I can see no reason why I may not.</P>
<P>I have one request more to make, which lies with no inconsiderable weight on my mind; and that is—that you would give me an idea of your religious sentiments; for I know not that I could be cast into a more disagreeable situation, than to be thrown into the arms of an infidel: For what fellowship can light have with darkness— the servants of the Most High with the servants of the adversary of all righteousness?</P>
<P>I love religion more than I can love any thing else in this world; and therefore be not surprised if I assure you, that I would rather en∣dure ten thousand inconveniences in this life, than to match with an infidel, or even with an irreligious person: In this respect, I feel not on∣ly for myself, but for my children, who must look up to my companion as their father, and be instructed by him in matters most important and interesting. Excuse, and believe me</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V. POLYMOND TO SYLVIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Lovliest of Women,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM charmed with your piety—with that ten∣der regard you have for your children, and that sacred respect you pay to religion; and therefore there was no need of your asking par∣don for dwelling upon these great and interest∣ing subjects. It is with real pleasure, I comply with your pious and rational request, in giving you a summary of my religious sentiments.</P>
<P>My parents were christians, who lived in the strict observance of all the duties▪ and doctrines taught by <HI>Calvin,</HI> that eminent minister of Jesus Christ, and reformer of the christian church.— The religious sentiments which I, for myself, have adopted, comprehend the leading ideas of Calvinism—and differ from him in nothing ex∣cept several inconsistences, which he either had not time or wisdom to rectify.</P>
<P>True religion, in my opinion, consists in a conformity of mind, heart, and life, to the law of God and gospel of Jesus Christ.— In the midst of that almost infinite variety of sentiments, this, my dearest Sylvia, is all that I call religion; every thing else, in my opinion, being idolatry, superstition, enthusiasm and will-worship.</P>
<P>All the schemes of religion, ever yet published to the world of mankind, may be denominated
<PB N="162" REF="028341_0157_0FD88BF33B24C710"/>
selfish, or benevolent.—Under the head of selfish religion, may be comprehended every false scheme of religion which has ever taken place in the world.—Under that of benevolence, we may say of true religion, that it is a religion which is derived from and supported by the scriptures of the old and new testament. This is the religion which I profess to believe and practise, and up∣on which I mean to venture my soul into the world of spirits—for it bears the image of its ori∣ginal, the great author of the universe.</P>
<P>But the Apostle says, <HI>Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of your hope that is in you, with meekness and fear.</HI></P>
<P>That boasting and proud mode of giving a relation of what is called religious experiences, too frequently practised among the warm and de∣vout, is in my opinion, an abomination to the great God, and all good men.</P>
<P>With meekness and fear, therefore, I would now give you the following reason of my hope that I am an heir of the grace of God.</P>
<P>I now perfectly remember that when I was a∣bout seven years of age, after hearing one of my parents commend me, together with my brethren and sisters, to the grace of God, that I was ex∣ceedingly affected with a sense of my own vile∣ness. I really felt myself an exceedingly vile and unworthy creature in the sight of God—be∣fore whom I had been usually called to bow my∣self morning and evening. This idea grew up∣on me for more than ten years—I found myself
<PB N="163" REF="028341_0158_0FD9BA9F0C0D05A0"/>
a wretch undone; for notwithstanding I had been taught, and knew my duty, such was the pride of my unhumbled and unsanctified heart, that I loved not the things which my reason and con∣science told me were most excellent. Sometimes I was gay and airy; but never without some re∣flection.</P>
<P>When I was about twenty years of age, it pleased the great disposer of all things (as I hum∣bly hope) to change the temper of my heart. I remember perfectly well (which is not probably the case with every one) the place and time when I first discovered a change in my disposi∣tion and feelings of soul.—I felt deeply impress∣ed with a sense of the righteousness of the great Governor of the universe; and with the exceed∣ing vileness of my own conduct in life—though I have been so happy as to escape those blots and blurs, which blast the characters of many of my fellow-citizens—I found enough in my char∣acter and heart to fill me with blushing and con∣fusion.</P>
<P>About this time, I felt an uncommon disposi∣tion to take blame and shame to myself, for all my former conduct towards my creator; and was most sincerely disposed to censure and con∣demn myself as a sinner before heaven. Now my conduct appeared infinitely more vile than ever it had done before; and I felt myself eve∣ry way undone—and began to feel in such des∣pair as words cannot describe. In the midst of this distress and horror of soul, I was, in infinite mercy, favoured with a fresh idea of the glori∣ous gospel of Jesus Christ.—The glorious Re∣deemer
<PB N="164" REF="028341_0159_0FD88BFFE7ED34E8"/>
appeared just such a saviour as I need∣ed; and I thought I could with the greatest pleasure, yield my all up into his hands, without any reserve, for time and eternity. Since that time, the worship of God—his friends—his ordi∣nances, and precepts, have been my delight.</P>
<P>In about twelve months after I observed this alteration in my heart and life, I joined myself to a congregational church of Christ, with which I have lived in the greatest harmony for a num∣ber of years past. With great pleasure I have put my children under the watch and care of the church, with whom I am in covenant.</P>
<P>Thus, my dearest Sylvia, I have given you a summary of my religious sentiments; and, I hope, with meekness and fear, added a relation of my religious experiences. If I know my own heart, I must say, there is nothing in the whole circle of creation, which appears of more value, than real religion▪ it is in very deed <HI>the one thing needful.</HI> And to tell you the truth, all personal charms are of little value, where religion is de∣spised. My former companion was a person of universally acknowledged wit and beauty: but her piety added ten thousand charms to all her other excellencies—her last words to me were, "Polymond, if you ever should marry again, see to it, that you match with a lady of virtue and piety—and may the great disposer of all things direct you in the pathway of life."</P>

<P>AS Felix said unto Paul—thou almost persuad∣est me to be a christian—so must I say unto thee, Polymond—thou almost persuadest me to be thy companion. For notwithstanding I had drawn up a conclusion never to marry again, I begin to feel, that such a conclusion was rash, and unfounded on principles of wisdom; and that in the great store of my heavenly father, I may possibly find a companion, every way as agreea∣ble to me, as my former one was.</P>
<P>I am without dissimulation, perfectly charmed with your sentiments in religion; and hope that relation you have given of your attachment to the great and interesting truths of the gospel, is genuine.</P>
<P>Remember, Polymond, our heavenly Father knows what is best for all his children; some must be afflicted, and some most triumph in all the joys of prosperity: if I am a child, I am an afflicted one; but I would not despair of the goodness and mercy of God. Bear me upon your heart as often as you go before the throne of grace; and believe me</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII. POLYMOND to SYLVIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM exceedingly happy to find, that my sen∣timents on religion, so sweetly accord with yours. Depend upon it, it was your religious character that first led me seriously to reflect up on making proposals of matrimony to you. I am likewise happy to find that you are almost persuaded to comply with my request; and hope you will soon be altogether so.</P>
<P>It is an old maxim, and perhaps a true one, that widowers and widows ought not to spend so much time in courting, as it would seem neces∣sary for those to do, who had never been marri∣ed. Perhaps there is nothing within the bounds of decency, and limits of custom, to forbid our entering into the joyful bands of matrimony, within a few months from the present moment. You will say, I am plain and explicit—I mean to be so—and hope you will ever treat me in the same undissembled way.</P>
<P>I have found by happy experience, in days past, something irresistibly captivating, in the company of a fine woman: for though her tongue should be silent, her eyes teach wisdom; and the mind struck with the external graces, vi∣brates into respondant harmony.</P>
<L>And while I'm fir'd, at Sylia blest,</L>
<L>Amidst profusion still I pine;</L>
<L>For though she give me up her breast,</L>
<L>Its painting tenant is not mine.</L>
<P><PB N="167" REF="028341_0162_0FD8B092A12CF738"/>Believe me, dear madam, I am determined to see you soon, when I hope we shall understand one another so well, as to free ourselves from the necessity of conversing at a distance.</P>

<P>NOT long after writing the foregoing letter, Polymond spent several weeks in the company of his beloved Sylvia. And within six months from his first interview with this charming woman, was blessed with her hand. They have now lived several years as husband and wife, in the greatest harmony. Kind providence has indulged them with an happy pledge of their mutual affection.</P>
<P>There is no difference made between the children of the mother and the children of the father; all seem equally to share the affections of both. The too commonly odious idea of <HI>father in-law</HI> and <HI>mother in law,</HI> is sca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cely known by the children of this family.</P>
<P>Polymond feels himself more happy than he ever was before; and Sylvia finds no reason to complain. Their children are trained up in all the graceful and useful arts. And what is of more importance, than every thing else, both father and mother are ambitious to excel one another, in instilling into the minds of their children, just views of true reli∣gion. Wisdom, virtue, religion and harmony reign triumphant through the family.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Courtship of <HI>FAIRSHUTE</HI> and <HI>SHUTEFAIR.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FAIRSHUTE was a gentleman of about seventy five years of age, who had been favour∣ed with two wives: by the first he had several children; by the second he had none. How∣ever, his second wife brought him a considera∣ble fortune, which was a consolation to him as great, as if she had born him sons and daughters.</P>
<P>Shutefair was a young lady of about twenty-five; in indigent circumstances; her eyes were black and sparkling, her skin dark, and her per∣son not disagreeable.</P>
<P>Fairshute had cast his eye on Shutefair, and was determined to make one vigorous push to gain the young and fair creature, as a companion in his old age. But how to accomplish the mat∣ter, he could not for a while satisfy himself.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="028341_0164_0FD8B09985060A90"/>Shutefair lived with Mr. Peter Meansomething. A gentleman of a singular character, and in cir∣cumstances somewhat needy. Fairshute conclu∣ded that it would be a matter of the last import∣ance to gain the good graces of Mr. Meansome∣thing, if he expected ever to win the young and amiable Shutefair. These he soon obtained, by a few presents of no great value; and Mr. Mean∣something devoted himself to the service of Fair∣shute, who employed him in carrying his letters to Shutefair, and receiving hers. In this office Mr. Meansomething did wonders.</P>
<P>The following is a correspondence between this remarkable couple, which lasted for more than six weeks; and finally issued in that happy connection, of which Mr. Peter Meansomething was the principal occasion.</P>

<P>When you first proposed a connection between us, I was really surprised; but the more I think of it, the less I am shocked. We read in the good book, that when King David was old, and could get no heat, that the young and beautiful Bishag was presented to him for the purpose of administering to, and lodging with him.—We are moreover told, that the King knew her not. How your proposal will finally set on my mind, is what I will not undertake fully to determine, without more time, and further consideration.— However, you may rest satisfied, that I will treat the subject with that attention which is due to matters of the last importance, till I shall have made up my mind upon it.

Mr. Peter Meansomething says you look serious and very thoughtful, and thinks my proposals are the principal cause of this uncommon appearance. Remember, my dear Shutefair, the moment you consent to write your name Fairshute instead of Shutefair, you become the mistress of my house, and heir of my whole estate. I would moreover inform you, that I am by no means so debilitated as King David was, when Bishag the Shunamite was placed in his bosom; for my eye-sight has not so failed me, that I cannot discern a great difference between you and any other lady in town.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The Courtship of <HI>DAMON</HI> and <HI>HARRIOT.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>DAMON</HI>—an American youth—was twen∣ty-one years of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge, when he became the humble servant of <HI>Harriot.</HI> He was the oldest son of a reputable Clergymen; educated in the christian religion. However, during his residence at the University, from under the eye of his pious father, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e contracted sentiments and habits quite incon∣sistent with the christian religion, and returned home a finished Deist; which almost broke the hearts of his exemplary and pious parents. Not∣withstanding all this, Damon was possessed of such a degree of beauty, sense, modesty and po∣liteness, as never failed to gain him the esteem of those who beheld him—especially the esteem of the fair sex. Harriot, upon her first acquaint∣ance with Damon, was turned of eighteen. She was the only child of a rich and reputable mer∣chant, and of course heir to a very handsome for∣tune; her education was liberal for a female, and very particular in matters of christianity.
<PB N="178" REF="028341_0173_0FD8B0AB5E38D100"/>
Though Harriot was no beauty▪ yet, in her pre∣sence, it was not uncommon for beauties to be∣come dissatisfied with themselves. Harriot was one of those rare persons, the second sight of whom, always charms more than the first. She dresses with singular grace, always intermingling simplicity with elegance. Her ambition is to know what most becomes the fair sex, in every station of life; and her ruling passion the love of virtue. She is possessed of a tender, modest, del∣icate and benevolent heart. The peculiar turn of her mind is cheerfulness, unallied to vanity. She always appears pleased, at the stated returns of her seasons of devotion.</P>
<P>Damon and Harriot formed their first acquaint∣ance with each other, at a public entertainment. Damon, having entered the parlour, indulged his eye indifferently to wander over a numerous cir∣cle of beautiful and well dressed ladies; in the midst of whom his attention was irrisistably fixed on the incomparable Harriot—whose pene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing eye soon perceived herself the object of Da∣mon's admiration. Both brushed, and in vein strove to hide from the company the impressions a sight of each other had made upon their ten∣der and yielding hearts. The very next day, Damon found means to introduce himself to Har∣riot as a courtier, and met with her modest ap∣probation. The following correspondence will display before the reader, their sentiments, their love, and the obstacles which lay in their way▪ for a long time, of matching with each other.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="028341_0174_0FD8B0B15718C010"/>Damon having chosen the study of law, as the high road to political preferment, was obliged to reside at some considerable distance from his be∣loved Harriot, and therefore commenced the subsequent correspondence.</P>

<P>CONTRARY to that line of conduct, which heretofore I have adopted, and invariably followed, I now, with a trembling hand and anxious heart, set down to answer your favour received last evening. The business being quite new, and in every point of light very delicate, I must beg ten thousand pardons for whatever may

<P>Your professed esteem for my person is truly flattering; and what I never thought of taking place in the heart of any gentleman of your rare accomplishments But as flattery is too frequent∣ly used by young gentlemen, for the language of politeness to ladies, you will excuse me if I treat it as such, till I am furnished with more ample proofs of your sincerity. Perhaps the impression of which you speak, may soon prove quite tran∣sient and illusory both to you and myself. In this case, we may prove ourselves rash and in∣considerate, if we reckon much upon them, be∣fore their reality is more fully ascertained. Let this be as it may, be assured, Sir, your last visit left impressions on my heart too powerful not to demand my most serious attention: These shall all be unfolded to you as far as prudence shall dictate. From this declaration, you will easily see that I wish not to let my heart run away with my head—my fancy with my judgment. The first impressions made on the heart cannot always be relied on with safety; and therefore judg∣ment must have time to be brought to maturity.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. DAMON to HARRIOT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Lovely Harriot,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR obliging and delicate letter has filled my heart with more pleasure than I can command language to express. The line of con∣duct you formerly adopted, and constantly pur∣sued, was undoubtedly judicious for the time of life in which it subsisted. But all general rules have some exceptions; and I am happy to find, that in the present case you have laid hold of one so much in my favour. Be assured, dear Madam, your confidence in me shall never be abused. I most heartily confess, that the language of flatte∣ry is too often used to the ladies as the language of politeness. For, upon recollection, I find that I have in several instances been guilty of this un∣gentleman-like conduct to the ladies. This is a folly which shows the great importance of exam∣ining general customs, and shuning those things, which, tho' customary, are really unrighteous and abusive. But in the present case, you must give me leave to assure you▪ that my pen and heart have exactly corresponded with each other. And to convince you of the sincerity of this declara∣tion, I will wait on time and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rounding circum∣stances as far as the fervent emotions of my soul will admit. Your suggestion that my impressions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssibly prove illusory, and subject us both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and rash steps, is so far from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>robation, that it has increased my

For having detected my self in an error respecting my philosophical senti¦ments concerning the ladies, I am now determin∣ed to be more suspicious of my abilities to with∣stand the force of their charms. By some means or other, in the present case, I find my strength is weakness and my philosophy cool and unmean∣ing.—I am therefore your willing captive, and beg you would treat me with that generosity which becomes a mind fraught with so much virtue and dignity as the mind of my ever lovely H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>riot.</P>

give me the reasons of your faith in Revelation, I will gird up my loins, and attempt an answer to your request. In the mean time, let me humbly entreat you, as far as possible, to divest yourself of all former prejudices against the Book of God. —Set down, Damon, and read this sacred Book, with the greatest care and candour—asking your∣self the questions as you go through it—Is this like the productions of meer man—are these su∣blime descriptions of intelligent beings—of Dei∣ty, of angels and men, to be found in composi∣tions meerly human? Are the descriptions of cre∣ation—of the fall of man—of the redemption of man—of morality—of religion—of the resurrec∣tion—a day of judgment—a heaven and hell— equalled in any of the writings of any of the phi∣losophers, ancient or modern? This request, Da∣mon, cannot justly be thought unreasonable by you, who ingeniously have confessed that you have formed an opinion of Revelation at a period in life, when you must be sensible, that your judgment was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipened to that degree it is now.

<HEAD>LETTER XI. HARRIOT to DAMON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my last, I engaged to give you the reasons of my faith in Revelation. In doing which I must be excused from any thing more than a bare statement of them; for a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll illustration of them would require a volume of many pages.</P>
<P>The first reason of my faith, in Revelation is founded on the circumstances of mankind, who are destitute of what, enlightened christians plead, is a revelation from God. These are, in my view, evidently such as demonstrate that human nature, unassisted by supernatural aid, is in a most deplorable situation. The consequence must be that such supernatural aid is truly desirable.— When we contemplate the situation of the most enlightened and improved nations on earth, who are destitute of Revelation, the idea that the light of nature needs the assistanee of Revelation, rushes in upon our minds with irresistable force▪ I need not inform you, Sir, (whose mind is open to the various situations of those nations, which are destitute of Revelation) that not one of these nations have ever been known to form and em∣brace a scheme of religion which would bear the test of common sense: Witness the religions of the Pagan world; yea, all the schemes of religion which have not been founded on revelation— the grossest idolatry—the greatest injustice, as well as the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st immoral and obscene conduct, have been celebrated as acts of virtue and reli∣gion.
<PB N="193" REF="028341_0188_0FD8B0D0AF3FE6C8"/>
Thus the world by wisdom, or philosophy, knew not God.</P>
<P N="2">2. By contemplating the character of the one living and true God, I find it is not inconsistent with his perfections, to grant unto his depraved and benighted creature, man, an express revela∣tion of his mind and will. For if the great char∣acteristic of the Deity be goodness, and if the circumstances of men be such as call for such aid as a revelation from God—then his character cannot be impeached, provided he should give men such a revelation. The objection against the bible's being a revelation from God, because it is not given to all the nations of the earth at once, cannot be admitted; for in this case, we should be deprived of one of the greatest argu∣ments in favour of revelation, viz. the great need in which men stood of it. The revelation no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being sent to all men at the same time; those who enjoy it, may, by comparing themselves with those who do not, see in a more striking manner, the blessings of such a revelation, than otherwise it would be possible for them to do. Now, if it can be made to appear, that the scrip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tures of the old and new testament are such a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> aid to men as the circumstances of mankind re∣quired, and the character of God admitted to be given to them—I think we shall have gained our point, that it is rational to believe that the Bible is a revelation from God.</P>
<P>This then is the <HI>third</HI> reason of my faith in re∣velation, viz. That the scriptures of the old and new testament, are such a revelation of the mind and will of God, as the circumstances of men re¦quired,
<PB N="194" REF="028341_0189_0FD8B0D19D573B00"/>
and the holy character of the God of Nature would admit to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> given to mankind.</P>
<P>I shall not here stop to illustrate this idea, but proceed immediately to give you a fourth reason of my faith in revelation; which is, That the scriptures of the old and new testaments contain all the internal and external evidences of a reve∣lation of the mind and will of God, any one could reasonably expect or wish for.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, you see the ground upon which I go. Be so kind and generous as to examine each step with care and candor, and put me right where I have transgressed the laws of reason and common sense. I shall attempt some farther re∣marks on this subject in my next. O that I might be the happy instrument of convincing you that the Bible is in reality the word of the living God.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII. HARRIOT to DAMON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my last I endeavoured to state some of the first principles of my faith in revelation. In this I shall attempt some farther arguments in favour of the Bible's being the word of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. All the doctrines of the Bible are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght reason. It is not denyed, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sev∣eral
<PB N="195" REF="028341_0190_0FD8B0D66BA2F1B8"/>
of them, however, are such as men in the exercise of reason, unassisted by revelation could never have discovered. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t it is affirmed, that after their discovery—though several of them are too great and sublime for our scanty faculties to comprehend—yet none of them are contrary to right reason.—To exemplify—The law of God requires supreme love to God, and impartial and universal love to mankind—which exactly cor∣responds with the dictates of right reason and with common sense. The scheme of salvation revealed in the Bible, though incomprehensible and undiscoverable by the light of nature, has been acknowledged consonant to the dictates of right reason, by many of those wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se rational powers are acknowledgely inferior to none of their fellow-creatures. Witness a <HI>Boyle,</HI> a <HI>Bacon,</HI> a <HI>Newton,</HI> an <HI>Addison,</HI> and ten thousand more, whose names are recorded in the annals of reli∣gion and same.</P>
<P>Again, that true religion, according to the scriptures, consists in conformity to the moral law, which requires love to God and man, and compliance with the gospel—which requires re∣pentance towards God, and saith in the Lord Je∣sus Christ—together with a faithful observance of all the commandments and ordinances of God's house, has been found by the generation of the righteous in all ages, to be consonant to reason. The universality and perfection of the divine go∣vernment—a future state of rewards for the righ∣teous, and punishment for the unrighteous which is strictly eternal, are doctrines perfectly agree∣able to reason. The particular doctrines of to∣tal
<PB N="196" REF="028341_0191_0FD8B0D86476E278"/>
depravity, human dependence, and the seve∣ral operations of the spirit of God, with all those which are their consequents, are so evident to every judicious mind, that I need say nothing of their being consonant to right reason.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another argument which I consider in fa∣vour of the Bible's being the word of God, is the manner in which its doctrines were first propa∣gated. The writers of the several doctrines found in the holy scriptures, lived in different ages, and in different parts of the world; but all appear to speak the same language, to be moved by the same Holy Ghost; which could not have been the case had they not been inspired of God.— Moreover the propagation of these sentiments have not been accomplished by the powerful arm of the civil law—by the dint of the sword; their intrinsic excellency has been felt and ac∣knowledged by thousands. The spirit of God has evidently attended the reading and preaching of the great truths of the gospel, to the comfort and salvation of thousands who have been favor∣ed with them.</P>
<P>Moreover, the original propagators of the doc∣trines contained in the scriptures, were, generally speaking, illiterate men; and consequently un∣furnished with the means of deceiving the world; and the doctrines which they preached and prac∣tised were, in every point of light, contrary to the taste of selfish and wicked men. Their rapid spread, therefore, must be owing to the divine and not human agency.</P>
<P>A third argument in favour of the scri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s being of a divine original, is, that their contents
<PB N="197" REF="028341_0192_0FD8B0DA00B6A9B8"/>
are of such a nature as far exceeds the highest stretches of the most exalted created minds and powers. All finite powers are confined to limits infinitely short of those exalted and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>blime stretches of thought exemplified in the scriptures of divine truth.</P>
<P N="4">4. The whole of the scriptures are delivered, not in the name of the penman, as would natu∣rally have been the case, provided they had not been of a divine original—but in the name of the God of Nature, who undoubtedly is their au∣thor.</P>
<P N="5">5. Miracles, which were wrought in attestation of the truth of what the sacred penman wrote, are, notwithstanding all the Deistical tribe have said and written to the contrary, a powerful ar∣gument in favour of the divinity of the scriptures.</P>
<P N="6">6. The fulfilment of prophesies is an incon∣testible and powerful argument that the Bible is the word of God.</P>
<P N="7">7.

<P>IN your three last letters you have convinced me of one important fact, at least, viz. that there is one sincere believer in revelation. I must confess however, that I feel myself unarm∣ed, and cannot dispute the soundness of your reasoning upon this great subject; though at the same time I must in honesty say, my heart is not well pleased with the general ideas contained in your defence of the divinity of the scriptures. I know not how to account for it, but so the fact is, that since I sat down seriously to examine the contents of what you call the holy scriptures, I have formed different ideas of my own moral character than what I have ever heretofore im∣agined concerning myself.—The dread of the majesty of all the world has strangely fallen upon my mind, and I really have no peace of con∣science.</P>
<P>I begin to mistrust, that the great difficulty in believing the scriptures are the word of God, lies not in my understanding, nor yet in the na∣ture of the scriptures themselves, but in my own heart. O my dearest Harriot, pity and pray for me, who am unfeignedly</P>

<P>SINCE my last I have given up the point, and drawn the solemn conclusion▪ that the Bible must be the word of God; and from its contents, I imagine all men must be saved—for it says, that Christ has died for all, and willeth, that all men should be saved. This appears to me a glorious doctrine indeed; and what is e∣specially agreeable to me is, that if all men shall be saved, I myself shall be saved too. I hope now we shall be of a mind.

Please to reflect, Damon, that nothing can be more evident from scripture, than at the close of time, all men shall appear before the judge of quick and dead—the good at his right hand, the bad at his left—and the righteous shall enter in∣to life eternal, and the unrighteous shall go away into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.—How solemn, dear Damon, is the scene which is just before us.

<P>Giving up then, the sentiment that all men shall be saved, I have come to a conclusion, that sal∣vation is by the deeds of the law—for the righte∣ous only shall be saved.—You must be sensible, however, that this idea of salvation, must be very alarming and painful, to one so destitute of righ∣teousness as I am.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Harriot,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I KNOW not that ever I shall be otherwise than in the wrong. My early fixed deter∣mination to steer clear of superstition and enthu∣siasm, landed me in the deeps of Deism. Being driven from this ground by your masterly pen, I hastily adopted the idea of Universal Salvation but being convinced that this sentiment was un∣scriptural and illusory, I fell into the Arminian scheme, which promises salvation to those who are careful to obey the law; and of course have been seeking to establish my own righteousness as my only ground of hope. But from your last, I perceive that I am still in the wrong; and in∣deed I find that my own righteousness is far from that which God requires of every rational crea∣ture; and that there is no evidence from the Bible, that the righteousness of Christ is designed only to patch up our filthy rags. I now know not which way to turn, unless it be to believe that I shall be saved, let me live and do as I may. And yet this scheme of religion does by no means correspond with the dictates of my reason.</P>

<P>THE account which you give of yourself is like that of a slender barge tossed on the boisterous waves of the raging sea—always in danger, though sometimes faintly hoping soon to gain a safe and commodious harbour. God is my witness, that I pity you from my very heart, and would cheerfully do any thing and every thing in my power to pilot you into the only har∣bour of complete and eternal safety.

<P><PB N="206" REF="028341_0201_0FD8AFB1525A2A78"/>Be assured then, dear Sir, that the great obsta∣cle, which lies in your way of understanding and believing the truth unto salvation, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed in your own breast. Be not angry with me, when I tell you, that this obstacle is nothing more no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> less than the voluntary enmity of your heart a∣gainst the blessed God. Believe me, Damon, it was this that blinded your eyes against the reality and glory of that revelation which the God of love has been pleased to make of his mind and will, in the scriptures of the old and new testa∣ment. It was this wickedness of heart which led you to catch hold of that mistaken idea of salva∣tion, which the Universalists have presumptuous∣ly palmed on the holy scriptures. And after your good sense and uncommon talents had led you to give up these too often fatal delusions, it was the corruption of your own depraved heart, which spurre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you on to embrace the Arminian notion of salvation by the deeds of the law. And being again driven from the dangerous ground which you had inconsiderately taken, by the mighty power of truth—it was the same deceitful heart that led you, as your last resort, to the absurd and unscriptural scheme of salvation adopted by the Antinomians—which, give me leave to tell you, is no less foreign from the truth, than either of the former. Now, as these various schemes of religion will by no means answer your pur∣pose, permit me in faithfulness to your best inter∣est, to tell you, that your feet undoubtedly stand on slippery places. O, Damon, forgive me, if, by the terrors of the Lord I undertake to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you into the paths of peace and happiness.
<PB N="207" REF="028341_0202_0FD8AFB25D2A1850"/>
It is a fact little known and less felt by the care∣less and inattentive world, that men, as they are by nature, are totally depraved; that this deprav∣ity consists in selfishness—which, like a mighty fountain, bursts forth in innumerable streams, and deluges human nature with shame, disgrace and guilt; yea, ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s up every avenue to life ev∣erlasting. Till you are convinced of this great truth, you will be always laying hold of error in∣stead of truth. For, believe me, Damon, the gospel plan of salvation, in every point of light, is absolutely contrary to the views and feelings of a selfish creature. Hence have arisen those innumerable false schemes of religion, which have disgraced, confounded and ruined a great part of the human race. Know, then, my dear friend, thyself. By comparing your heart and life, with the moral law, which indeed is a transcript of the moral image of that God, the peculiar glory of whose nature is disinterested benevolence, you will soon see what a wretch undone you are. Should you ask, And what shall I then do, when I have gained this knowledge, which you consid∣er of so much importance—I answer, it will, as it always has been, be your duty immediately to repent and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ▪— From a sight of your true character, and a sight of your absolute dependance on God, the way will be opened, or more strictly speaking, pre∣pared for you to understand the gospel scheme of salvation through Christ. You will find, you need just such an atonement for sin, as that which is published in the gospel—that you need just such assistance as that which is pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ferred in the

I am moreover exceedingly pleas∣ed, that the truth has found you out—that in fact it has showed yourself to yourself in any degree. But I must be forgiven if I tell you, that you need further information still respecting the de∣ceitfulness of your own heart. Remember, my dear friend, the human heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked. You say that you perceive it your duty to believe on the Sa∣viour of men—but find yourself unable to per∣form this important task. Here let me freely observe, that this is a difficulty not uncommonly felt by those who are brought to the knowledge of the truth—and frequently got rid of with no

<P N="3">3. Carefully settle the matter, whether it be really a fact, that you feel yourself under obliga∣tions to exercise repentance towards God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ immediately, or not?</P>
<P>Now, that I might contribute, as far as in me lies, to your properly solving these momentuous questions—please to attend to the following re∣marks:</P>
<P N="1">1. There are many things incumbent upon men as duties, which they have no inclination to perform; but none which lie beyond the limits of their natural powers. The natural conse∣quence is, that the inability which men are under to obey God, must be of a moral and not a natu∣ral kind; and of course wholly inexcusable.— Hence</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The want of natural ability is the only thing which can excuse us for the non-perform∣ance of any thing which God commands.</P>
<P>But remember, dear Sir, a disapprobation of our wrong conduct towards God, lies within the limits of our natural powers and faculties; and of course is a duty incumbent upon us—for the non-performance of which, we can have no rea∣sonable
<PB N="211" REF="028341_0206_0FD8AFBC47CA9160"/>
excuse. Therefore, we may easily see, that when we feel it a duty to repent; and at the same time, feel no inclination to perform this du∣ty, the difficuly lies not in the want of power, but in the want of inclination only—or in other words, in the positive and voluntary opposition of our hearts against God. When you come care∣fully to examine these matters, I believe you will find I am not out of the way in my thoughts on this great and interesting subject.

I now humbly hope, God has in reality blessed your pious and unwearied labours, to my everlasting good; and doubt not but he will reward you for the same in the coming world, to which we are hastening.— When I reflect upon the remaining corruptions of my heart, I feel that I ought to rejoice in my prospects of future glory, with fear and trem∣bling; r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ling that none can be saved, but those who hold out to the end of life, in the exercise of every christian grace and virtue.</P>
<P>And now, Harriot, I must inform you, that I begin to find myself engaged in a warfare, of which previous to my change I had no idea. I find that I must, in fact, fight not with flesh and blood only, but with principalities and powers, with the rulers of the darkness of this world, or lose my soul after all. Little did I think, in that happy moment, when, without reserve, I gave my all into the hands of God, that I should so soon be called to put on the gospel armour, and plunge into the battles of the Lord, the Captain and Bishop of my soul. I find it impossible for one, who is really embarked in the cause of the dear Redeemer, to live in this world without re∣proach and persecution. My Deistical acquaint∣ance have got some idea of my views of mind,
<PB N="218" REF="028341_0213_0FD8AFD060694590"/>
feelings of heart, and determinations of soul, and begin to despise my company—Some say I am beside myself; others that I am acting a low∣lived and hypocritical part, only to please a lady whom I wish to marry. The followers of the Lamb of God seek my company, and call me brother; they mark the change through which I have passed, and bid me God's speed.</P>
<P>I am pleased with the change of company, which seems to be the consequence of my change of heart. But Oh, what will become of those sprightly youths, who formerly were my dearest companions? They certainly are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity. Their feet stand on slippery places, and must, unless sovereign grace prevent, slide in due time. Oh that each of them had an Harriot, whose instruc∣tions would be attended to out of love. I am determined to do all in my power to convince them of their errors, and persuade them to em∣brace the christian religion. You will join with me in addressing the throne of grace, night and day, with an express view to their salvation.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII. HARRIOT to DAMON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM extremely gratified with your last let∣ter, because▪ it speaks the language of the redeemed, struggling through this vale of tears— to come off conquerors, yea more than conquer∣ors, through him who hath loved and died for them. The effects of that change of sentiment and heart, you mention, are what I have been looking for, and so far as they evidence the real∣ity of your religion, rejoice at. I have felt sim∣ilar ones pressing upon my spirits for more than eight years; and no wonder, for the Lord God, immediately after the fall of man, put enmity be∣tween the serpent and the woman whom he had deceived, and between his seed and her seed. Hence the righteous are an abomination to the wicked, and the wicked are an abomination to the righteous—and can no more have fellowship with each other, than Christ and Belial. Perse∣cution is the natural consequence of these differ∣ent natures; but let us be careful that we are re∣proached and persecuted for nothing but well-doing—that we suffer for righteousness sake; then may we rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great will be our reward in Heaven; for so persecuted they the Prophets who were before us; yea our Lord and master himself. O Da∣mon, be not afraid to suffer the loss of all things for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath died for you; yea be

not afraid to die for the promotion of his cause, which you have so lately espoused.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII. DAMON to HARRIOT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Harriot,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the greater part of my letters I have said but little to you, on the subject with which our correspondence was first introduced; and the reason has been, because you have constantly entertained me with matters infinitely more im∣portant. I would now inform you, that my love for your person, instead of dying away, has en∣creased ten thousand degrees; but notwithstand∣ing all this, my love for the honour of christianity, which I have lately professed, and mean ever to advocate, is so much greater, that I can by no means adopt a line of conduct towards you, that can bring the least disgrace upon christianity.</P>
<P>The Deists say, that my profession of religion is only to please you. I wish to establish my own heart in the truth, and convince them, and you, and all the world, that my religion is not of such a hypocritical and selfish kind.—For this
<PB N="221" REF="028341_0216_0FD8AFD7F5101370"/>
reason, I am determined, at present, to say no∣thing to you upon the tender and commanding subject, with which our correspondence was in∣troduced.</P>
<P>I hope in a few months to see you, when I shall have an opportunity to unbosom my heart, to one who has proved herself my greatest friend. With every sincere and devout wish for your prosperity, I beg leave, dear Harriot, to subscribe</P>

<P><HI>AFTER the exchange of the foregoing letters, (which took up the space of near two years,) these pious youths had frequent interviews with each other, for about three months; when Damon's business call∣ed him to part with his beloved Harriot, for several months together. During this period the following letters were exchanged between them.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX. DAMON to HARRIOT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dearest Harriot,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I parted with you, I have come to a firm conclusion, to lay aside the study of the law, and all my worldly schemes of ambition,
<PB N="222" REF="028341_0217_0FD8AFDA620E9CD8"/>
and commence preacher of that gospel, which I have heretofore reproached and ridiculed. The reason of this is not because I imagined it im∣possible to be a christian, and at the same time a lawyer—to be a statesman, and at the same time a follower of the lamb of God; but because I think I can in this way do more to build up the cause, which before I strove to pull down, than in any other.</P>
<P>My dear and honoured father, considers me as the prodigal son; and rejoices over me, say∣ing, my son was lost, but now is sound; was dead, but now is alive. You will excuse my troubling you with an account of this change of my cir∣cumstances, and believe me,</P>

<P>I THANK you for the important intelligence with which you were pleased to favour me in your last. And heartily wish you may be suc∣ceeded in the great and important work you have engaged to pursue for life. Some may con∣sider you as descending exce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding low, by leav∣ing the law and politicks, and confining yourself

to the generally despised business of a preacher of the gospel. But this is by no means my opinion. For I consider the office, an ambassador for Christ, as the most weighty and honourable, that man can sustain in this life. What, my dear friend, can be more honourable, than to be vest∣ed with authority, to negociate a peace between the offended heaven and the rebellious earth? Than to bare the messages of love and peace to a perishing world? Gird up your loins then, Da∣mon, and prove yourself a workman that need∣eth not to be ashamed. O, that you may be a son of thunder unto those who are in a state of nature; and a son of consolation to those who are in a state of grace. O, that you may prove the happy instrument of turning thousands and tens of thousands to righteousness; and have them as the crown of your rejoicing at the great and last day▪</P>

<P>I AM not a little surprised at your delicate and important question; for I had conclu∣ded you would not think seriously of entering in∣to the married state till you had been settled: However, it is a question which lies too near my heart to admit of trifling. Our acquaintance with each other has been of so long standing, that there can be no impropriety in our fully knowing each others mind. You have declared yours by the question which you have proposed to me. I will declare mine by the following answer: Da∣mon, with chearfulness of sincerity of heart, I give myself to you.</P>
