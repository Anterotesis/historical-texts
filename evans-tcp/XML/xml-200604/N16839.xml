<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE thirst for Novelty is unextinguishable. The human mind is of such exquisite susceptibility, as to be insatiable to variety; hence it is the good peo∣ple of this town have more than once discovered their avidity to gratify this passion or affection by instantly snatching up newspapers, magazines, and even <HI>farces.</HI> Some people may perhaps attribute this eagerness in pursuit of literary entertainment to a <HI>love of scandal.</HI> With what greater degree of truth, might this be im∣puted to a desire of something <HI>new!</HI>—I have the charity to suppose this may be one of the causes which prompt the publick to buy new publications, not to say any thing of encouraging the Art of Printing—the boast of Americans—the palladium of liberty—and the cream of the Constitution. Sorry I am to add that this eager solicitude in a generous publick has oftentimes been ill requited; it has been requited with a farcical representation of a few heterogeneous incidents, thrown together with <HI>injudicious haste,</HI> and prompted solely by the lucre of gain—a few private anecdotes have been inserted in these pages, but without instruction, without even amusement for their aim, they have obtained, for the reason above cited, a temporary reception; but not deserving a repository in the library of Curiosity, or even in the memory of Slander, they have silently rolled down
<PB N="iv" REF="021678_0003_0FB50F4D68F66F58"/>
the stream of time into the dull lake of oblivion. The dramatick style is universally allowed to be a useful channel for conveying instruction to all classes of citi∣zens—and though a <HI>new play</HI> must necessarily loose a great part of its effect, because the <HI>advantage of action</HI>
is shut out, yet a candid mind will doubtless and nev∣ertheless <HI>receive the seed into good ground</HI>; the <HI>good humour</HI> of the reader must therefore supply the <HI>comick humour</HI> of an actor. Whence it appears that a <HI>Farci∣cal Opera</HI> presented to the American states at this junc∣ture, must be a very <HI>useful work.</HI> The following <HI>work,</HI> therefore, is now offered to the candour, and for the amusement and edification of the credulous publick. A publick whom I call <HI>credulous</HI> because they have generally purchased books of this kind before they took the trouble to examine them. If then they have been cheated by the empty sound of a title, the question is, <HI>How ought a Farce to be written.</HI> I can answer the question in no better way than by encouraging the reader diligently to peruse, what he now seeth before him. In a more especial manner will his good nature be awakened, when he finds that the conversation of the parties tends to some general point, that the <HI>unities</HI> of the Drama are not altogether violated, and that a PLOT is pursued and brought about, all which must provoke his patience to read these fifty pages clean through.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE. In the <HI>CHARACTER of MR. SENTENTIOUS.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LOOK round the world, how very few we see,</L>
<L>From prejudice and prepossession free!</L>
<L>Old customs are rever'd, and new ones curst,</L>
<L>The partial heart still faithful to the first.</L>
<L>Suppose, I say—"It might not come amiss</L>
<L>T' erect a Stage in such a town as this."</L>
<L>How many voices issue from the croud,</L>
<L>Some whisp'ring praise, while others damn aloud;</L>
<L>Some deprecate the time—and some rejoice—</L>
<L>A diff'rent int'rest prompts a different voice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye sober CITS, just, friendly, kind and civil,</L>
<L>Who dread the drama, as ye dread the devil,</L>
<L>Hear what our author bade me to impart,</L>
<L>And he's a warm, good fed'ralist at heart.</L>
<L>He says 'tis vice awakes the muses rage,</L>
<L>Her pow'rs satirick but reform the age.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perhaps some FEMALE FLIRT breaks forth in praise,</L>
<L>"Glorious! to sport it all the night at plays!</L>
<L>"Then should we see, in silks and satins lac'd,</L>
<L>"What Boston Lady has the greatest <HI>taste.</HI>"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Stop child," methinks the MATRON grave, replies,</L>
<L>(From a long life's experience render'd wise)</L>
<L><PB N="vi" REF="021678_0005_0FB50F51362D1460"/>"PLAYS (were there some committee to o'ersee 'em)</L>
<L>"Might be as useful as a long <HI>Te Deum</HI>;</L>
<L>"Thus to attend the labour'd works of bards,</L>
<L>"PLAYS might improve the time, that's spent at cards,</L>
<L>"At moral truth and social virtue aiming,</L>
<L>"PLAYS soon would supersede the vice of gaming."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The YOUTH from CAMBRIDGE thinks the matter fine—</L>
<L>"A school for wit, and eloquence divine!</L>
<L>"—That play'rs <HI>were</HI> moral men—appears quite fully,</L>
<L>"<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> you know, was hand-in-glove with <HI>Tully.</HI>"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A good MECHANICK, somewhat loth to flatter,</L>
<L>Owns, on the whole, he hugely likes the matter.</L>
<L>Staunch, to preserve the morals of THE PEOPLE,</L>
<L>He sees the <HI>buck</HI> at taverns run to <HI>tipple,</HI></L>
<L>Who ev'ry evening saunters on, and gapes,</L>
<L>From the <HI>Green Dragon</HI> to the <HI>Bunch of Grapes.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Spending his money!</HI> O the mighty curse!</L>
<L>In punch—at dice, and often <HI>something worse.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But see the BUCK himself—the painted creature,</L>
<L>Who always strives t' adorn the work of nature,</L>
<L>Strives to <HI>adorn,</HI> with all his might and pow'r,</L>
<L>His shirt with ruffles, and his cape with flour!</L>
<L>"<HI>Gads bod!</HI> a stage in Boston!—that's the <HI>broth,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A cant term for any thing very good.—</NOTE></L>
<L>"But our <HI>old</HI> DONS will all be mighty wroth—</L>
<L>"What <HI>sun</HI> we'd have, were't not for these <HI>old prigs,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Who never change their principles nor wigs."</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pope.</NOTE></L>

<L>O impotence of fools! to whom 'tis given</L>
<L>To countermine the choicest gifts of Heaven.</L>
<L>At social joys, their indiscretion strikes;</L>
<L>Of folly's tide, they raise the spacious dykes;</L>
<L>Follies unseen, gain power as they rise,</L>
<L>And mundate us with a flood of vice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To fix fair Virtue in her steadfast cause;</L>
<L>To improve your morals, more than win applause;</L>
<L>To shew the foibles of domestick strife,</L>
<L>The tyrant husband, and the scolding wife;</L>
<L>T' expose the father, who, by right divine,</L>
<L>Would sacrifice his child at MAMMON's shrine,</L>
<L>For this the <HI>Comick</HI> MUSE "first trod the stage,"</L>
<L>And scourg'd the vice and folly of the age,</L>
<L>Manners, and sometimes principles, she mended,</L>
<L>And took her task up—where the preacher ended.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But since a Theatre is not allow'd</L>
<L>T' amuse the great—t' instruct the vulgar croud,</L>
<L>A worthy lady of the "better sort,"</L>
<L>Consents to night to make a little sport,</L>
<L>This worthy lady in a merry mood,</L>
<L>Will risk the consequences—bad or good.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here, with conclusive, dictatorial pride,</L>
<L>To <HI>sum the evidence</HI> on either side,</L>
<L>Exceeds the limits of our small commission—</L>
<L>We leave the premises to your decision;</L>
<L>With you we rest the <HI>merits of the cause,</HI></L>
<L>And humbly hope the <HI>verdict</HI>—of applause.</L>

<HEAD>DUET. The <HI>FATHER</HI> and the <HI>DAUGHTER.</HI></HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FATHER.</SPEAKER>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>At the Comick Opera I have sometimes seen action alone excite the highest applause, independent of either the poetry or the musick. I saw a Duo performed by an old man and a young woman, supposed to be his daughter, in such an humourous manner, as drew an uni∣versal <HI>enchore</HI> from the spectators. The merit of the musical part of the composition, I was told, was but very moderate, and as for senti∣ment you shall judge.</P>
<P>The father informs his daughter, in a song, that he has found an excellent match for her; who, besides being rich, and very prudent, and not too young, was over and above a particular friend of his own, and, in person and disposition, much such a man as himself; he con∣cludes, by telling her, that the ceremony will be performed next day. She thanks him, in the gayest air possible, for his obliging intentions, adding, that she should have been glad to have shewn her implicit obe∣dience to his commands, provided there had been any chance of the man's being to her taste; but as, from the account he had given, there could be none, she declares she will not marry him next day, and adds, with a <HI>very long</HI> quaver, that if she were to live to <HI>eternity,</HI> she should continue of the same opinion. The father, in a violent rage, tells her, that instead of tomorrow, the marriage should take place that very day; to which she replies, Non; he rejoins, Si; she, Non, non; he, Si, si; the daughter, Non, non, non; the father, Si, si, si; and so the singing continues for five or six minutes. You perceive there is noth∣ing marvelously witty in this; and for a daughter to be of a different opinion from her father, in the choice of a husband, is not a very new dramatick incident. Well, I told you the Duo was encored—they im∣mediately performed it a second time, and with more humour than the first. The whole house vociferated for it again; and it was sung a third time, in a manner equally pleasant, and yet perfectly different from any of the former two.</P>
<P>I thought the house would have been brought down about our ears, so extravagant were the testimonies of approbation.</P>
<P>The two actors were obliged to appear again, and sing this Duo a fourth time; which they executed in a style so new, so natural, and so exquisitely droll, that the audience now thought there had been some∣thing deficient in all their former performances, and that they had hit on the true comick only this last time.</P>
<P>Some people began to call for it again; but the old man, now quite exhausted, begged for mercy; on which the point was given up. I never had any idea that such strong comick powers could have been displayed in singing a song.—MOORE'S ITALY, vol. i. page 222, &amp;c.</P></NOTE> Dear daughter, since wedlock's the balsam of life,</L>

<P>Every nation is undoubtedly characterized by their songs—They were anciently calculated to inspire the minds of the people with great ideas of liberty and sentiments of heroism. Even our American Indians have their war songs. Remember the effect of the songs of <HI>Ossian.</HI> The <HI>Welsh</HI> bards were put to death by <HI>Edward</HI> I. when he conquered <HI>Wales,</HI> for the reason I have given, and through motives of policy. I have now by me "<HI>General Montgomery,"—"The Battle of the Kegs,"—"Frencau</HI>'s Poems,"—and many others which were favourites with the <HI>Conti∣nental</HI>

<P>One may observe the songs of our <HI>British</HI> sailors in the same point of view—One of your <HI>Connecticut</HI> wits says "They have <HI>sung</HI> themselves into invinci∣bility"—and possibly "<HI>Hearts of Oak,</HI>" and the "<HI>Roast Beef of Old England,</HI>" may inspire their minds, as you say, with great and heroick sentiments.</P>

That's a good come off, <HI>Yorick</HI>—I applaud you, my boy—you were carried too far in your country's cause by the high blood of youth—you swum out of your depth, buoyed by a pure federal principle—and were the generality of mankind as ready to make concessions as you are, we should have none of your duels.</P>

<SPEAKER>YORICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>There I join you, Sir—I look upon all dueling, gaming and guzzling, and the like of that (excepting <HI>sleighing frolicks</HI>) to be perfectly antifederal—and as to you, Capt. <HI>Flash,</HI> when I happened to say that the French did not take such delight to misrepresent matters as the English, I considered the different in∣terests of the two nations. It is for the glory of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to depreciate the merit of <HI>America,</HI> that she may appear unrivalled—the like as we may see in our manner of electioneering; for instance; a man wants to be a Rep. or a Congress man, he in the first place puts a piece in the <HI>Centinel,</HI> telling how and a∣bout what a great man he is, with his name in a line of capital letters; but the cream of the jest is, that <HI>he takes care to black all the other candidates.</HI> A Frenchman, on the other hand, is a gentleman, and I love a Frenchman. We are under infinite obliga∣tion to that generous nation, and he who utters a syl∣lable disrespectful of our great ally, deserves the sever∣est

punishment that can be inflicted—the punishment of ingratitude.</P>

<SPEAKER>FLASH.</SPEAKER>
<P>If there be not solid truth in your reasoning, I grant that there is something like a show of plausi∣bility, and for which reason I accept it as a concession. But after all I advise you not to place too much con∣fidence in French faith—because they are deeply in∣terested in whatever concerns Great Britain.</P>

<P>I look upon America to be nothing more than a <HI>cats paw,</HI> which the ambition of France, prompted by diabolical antipathy to Old England, has made use of to stir up the embers of sedition. America, it is true, is independent, but in my mind she will soon rue the time she withdrew from the protection of the parent country.

<P>Be happy, my children—I was disappointed in the character of Old <HI>Hazard</HI>—Our friend <HI>Jenny</HI> has told me strange stories—alas! alas! that there should be so much dissimulation in mankind!—However, I learn thus much—that though it may be the duty of a father to see his daughter well <HI>married off,</HI> yet there can be no harm in a girl putting on <HI>a good share of spirit to every body whomsoever.</HI></P>

<P>As I have cut a great flash in the conversation of this evening, I now say, if it were possible I could for∣get my King and country, I would settle in Boston, and leave off my old pranks. In the mean time I most heartily <HI>drink</HI> to your health—

<HEAD>EPILOGUE. THE PRINTERS TO THE PUBLICK.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WE told our author that to be in vogue,</L>
<L>He ought t' have given us an Epilogue—</L>
<L>He sent us here (O help us out good Lord!)</L>
<L>Thus to harangue you of our own accord:—</L>
<L>Perhaps you'd have us tell you, if we're able,</L>
<L>Whether there's any Moral to our Fable.—</L>
<L>—A father contradicted by a daughter—</L>
<L>This, in our mind, is no such mighty matter.</L>
<L>—Morals we hate—we love to deal in fiction—</L>
<L>And what so charming as sweet contradiction?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>—LADIES, to you we make our first appeal,</L>
<L>Whose sympathetick hearts well know and feel</L>
<L>The whole extent of <HI>contradiction's</HI> power—</L>
<L>When did you know it gain so much before?</L>
<L>To you this <HI>Comick Opera</HI> belongs—</L>
<L>We'd have you read the <HI>Play</HI> and sing the <HI>Songs.</HI></L>
<L>Accept then ladies—what is but your due—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now dear GENTLEMEN, a word with you.</L>
<L><HI>And now,</HI> ye well bred, party colour'd crews,</L>
<L>Who deign this spotless pamphlet to peruse—</L>
<L>Ye husbands—ye who never yet were jealous!</L>
<L>Ye beaux, bucks, bloods and sops and pretty fellows.</L>
<L>Who complaisance and gallantry inherit,</L>
<L>We dare you all to toast—"<HI>The Girl of Spirit.</HI>"</L>
</LG>

<PB N="50" REF="021678_0049_0FB50FC3074947B8"/>
<L>Dear, rev'rend CRITICKS, must we then conclude</L>
<L>Without a word to you? we're not so rude—</L>
<L>We sought the <HI>bard</HI>—"a Farce, a Farce," we said—</L>
<L>"Ah, <HI>scandal,</HI>" quoth the man, and shook his head—</L>
<L>"Who dares a page of sland'rous <HI>lies</HI> to tell,</L>
<L><HI>"My soul detests him as the gates of hell."</HI></L>
<L>Then he talk'd something of a certain sage</L>
<L>Who wrote much <HI>po'try</HI> in th' Augustan age,</L>
<L>Who like <HI>Mahomet's</HI> pigeon, in his ears,</L>
<L>Did whisper, "<HI>Rhimer! Keep your farce nine years.</HI>"</L>
<L>To which we said—"since WE are here at home,</L>
<L>Tis very odd that you should go to Rome</L>
<L>To gain some <HI>typographical</HI> advice—</L>
<L>We'll put you in a method—in a trice—</L>
<L>Will let you know how Farces may be made,</L>
<L>Tis very odd if we dont know our trade.</L>
<L>If you're afraid of Satire, why indite it,</L>
<L>And as you say the matter, so we'll write it:</L>
<L>Or, give us <HI>sheet by sheet, and we will print,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Just as</HI> YOU <HI>write</HI>—if that won't do—the devil's in't."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perhaps there's some will say, "I'd give a guinea</L>
<L>To know who's Yorick, Flash, Sententious, Jenny.</L>
<L>Let's see the mangled characters that bleed—</L>
<L>Farce, and no Scandal, is a FARCE <HI>indeed.</HI>"</L>
<L>Know, slander-loving readers, great and small,</L>
<L>We scorn on private characters to fall—</L>
<L><HI>"They're Knights of the Shire, and</HI> represent <HI>you all.</HI></L>
