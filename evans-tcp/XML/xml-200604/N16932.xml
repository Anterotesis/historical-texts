<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Dramatic trifle was not written for publication, but merely to serve the Gentleman on whose night it was performed.—The Author is fully sensible, that the plea of its being a hasty Production is no excuse for obtruding on the Public an incorrect Composition; but, being importuned by his Friends, he has consented to throw this Child of the Day on the protection of the World, encouraged by the flattering reception it received at the Theatre, and the candour once before shewn to its Author.</P>
<P>☞ The lines marked with inverted comma's, were omitted in the representation.</P>

<L>My nice shock golden hair, black't, greas'd &amp; twisted:</L>

<L>No, to three halberts;—cat-o-nine-tail pay:</L>
<L>There I was sav'd by little <HI>Captain Pat,</HI></L>
<L>And where d'ye think I went to after that?</L>
<L>To Austria, my lads! and there I swagger'd,</L>
<L>Strutted &amp; puff'd, look'd big, drank hard &amp; stagger'd.</L>
<L>While my great master, doing much the same,</L>
<L>Bully'd the Dutchman—thus we play'd the game;</L>
<L>Till the curst Turks, those whisker'd, sabred dogs,</L>
<L>Men-eating Hannibals, with hearts like logs,</L>
<L>Made war upon us; then I thought 'twas best,</L>
<L>To seek an army that was more at rest;</L>
<L>Not that I minded fighting: Not a button!</L>
<L>(For some may think I meant to save my mutton:)</L>
<L>No, no!—But being taught by <HI>Father Luke,</HI></L>
<L>That Turks are heretics, I wisely took</L>
<L>Precautions not to have my morals hurt,</L>
<L>By any intercourse with such vile dirt:</L>
<L>So finding this was not the place for me,</L>
<L>Once more, good neighbours, I embark'd for sea.</L>

<P>Do <HI>Darby</HI> tell me!—Did you see a whale?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARBY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well neighbours, now by destinies and fates,</L>
<L>See me safe landed in the United States;</L>
<L>And now I'm at the best part of my story,</L>
<L>For there poor Darby was in all his glory;</L>
<L>From north to south, where ever I appear'd,</L>
<L>With deeds and words, my spirits oft they cheer'd;</L>
<L>But more especially I lik'd to work,</L>
<L>At one nice little place they call'd New-York;</L>
<L>Oh! there they lov'd me dearly, never fear</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="021804_0010_0FB75248E160DC60"/>But Darby loves them too, with heart sincere.</L>
<L>There too I saw some mighty pretty shows;</L>
<L>A revolution without blood or blows;</L>
<L>For as I understood the cunning elves,</L>
<L>The people all revolted from themselves;</L>
<L>Then after joining in a kind confession,</L>
<L>They all agreed to walk in a procession;</L>
<L>So turners, taylors, tinkers, tavern-keepers,</L>
<L>With parsons, blacksmiths, lawyers, chimney sweepers,</L>
<L>All neatly dress'd, and all in order fair,</L>
<L>Nice painted standards, waving in the air,</L>
<L>March'd thro' the town—eat beef—and drank strong beer.</L>
<L>Soon after that I saw another show,</L>
<L>A man who'd fought to free the land from woe,</L>
<L><HI>Like me</HI> had left his <HI>farm</HI> a <HI>soldiering</HI> to go;</L>
<L>But having gain'd his point, he had, <HI>like me,</HI></L>
<L>Return'd his own <HI>potatoe ground</HI> to see;</L>
<L>But there he coldn't rest;—with one accord</L>
<L>He's call'd to be a kind of—, not a Lord—</L>
<L>I don't know what—he's not a great man, sure,</L>
<L>For poor men love him, just as he was poor!</L>
<L>They love him like a father or a brother.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DERMOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>As we poor Irishmen love one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARBY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just so.</P>

<P>Why that's the strangest sight of all.</P>

<SPEAKER>KATHLEEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>How look'd he Darby? Was he short or tall?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARBY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why sure I didn't see him: to be sure,</L>
<L>As I was looking hard from out the door,</L>
<L>I saw a man in regimentals fine,</L>
<L>All lace and glitter, bother'um and shine;</L>
<L>And so I look'd at him, till all was gone,</L>
<L>And then, I found that he was not the one.</L>
<L>"By this time, boys, I wanted to get home;</L>
<L>"I thought you would be glad to see me come;</L>
<L>"So, as I've often heard the people say,</L>
<L>"The farthest round is much the shortest way,</L>
<L>"I went to France. I always did love quiet,</L>
<L>"And there I got in the middle of a riot.</L>
<L>"There they cried "<HI>vive la nation," "liberty</HI>"</L>
<L>"And all the <HI>bag and tails</HI> swore they'd be free;</L>
<L>"They caught the fire quite across the ocean,</L>
<L>"And to be sure, they're in a nice commotion:</L>
<L>"(Down with the bastile—tuck up the jailor,</L>
<L>"Cut off my lor's head, then pay his taylor.)</L>
<L>"Oh bless their hearts, if they can but get free,</L>
<L>"They'll soon be as fat and as jolly as we;</L>
<L>"Some took the <HI>liberty</HI> to plunder others,</L>
<L>"Because equality is more like brothers▪</L>
<L>"You may be sure I didn't stay there long,</L>
<L>"So here I am boys, hearty hale and strong!"</L>
<L>But oh, New-York's the place to get a wife.</L>
<L>Aye, that's the place to lead a merry life.</L>

<L>But I'll go back again, oh never fear!</L>
<L>I'll not be after leaving them, my dear:</L>
<L>You will not catch me staying a great while,</L>
