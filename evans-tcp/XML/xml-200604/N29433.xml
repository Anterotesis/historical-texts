<P>WHereas it hath pleased our gracious God, contrary to the ma∣ny evill-deservings of an unworthy and sinfull People such as we are, so far to espouse the interest of his poor people, as to plead their Cause with the Heathen in this Wilderness, that have risen up against us, and broken in upon many of our Towns and places as a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, seeking the utter extirpation and ruine of the interest of our Lord Jesus, in the Wilderness, and that with so considerable a progress, and such strange success, as ought not soon to be forgotten by us: in this day of our calamity, God hath made bare his own Arm for our Deliverance, by taking away courage and Counsel from our enemyes, and giving strange advantages and great success to our selves and Confederates against them, that of those several Tribes and Partyes that have risen up against us, which were not a few, there now scarce remains a Name or Family of them in their former habitations; but are either slain, captivated or fled into re∣mote parts of this wilderness, or lye hid despairing of their first intentions against us, at least in these parts: unto which mercy, God hath added an abatement of those Epidemical Sicknesses that have attended us most part of this Summer, and vouchsafed us a liberal portion of the fruits of the earth, for our comfortable susten∣tation and Relief: The joynt consideration of these things ministers great cause, and the same God that is Author of them, can give us hearts to offer our Praise that thereby we may glorifie him. Which that we may obtain,</P>
<P>THis Court doth appoint and set apart the ninth day of <HI>November</HI> next to be a Day of solemn <HI>Thanksgiving and Praise</HI> to God for such his singular and Fatherly Mercyes bestowed on us: and doe commend the same to the respective Elders, Ministers and People of this Jurisdiction, solemnly and seriously to keep the same.</P>
