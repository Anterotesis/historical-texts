<P>I find, my good friend, you have a genuine idea of taste.—From the many starched senti∣ments which some of our Old Dons have endeavour∣ed to instil among us by their resolves—town-meet∣ings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I expected we should all, at the close of the war, be obliged to be confined to our closets to learn political creeds and read political disquisiti∣ons—and instead of balls, concerts and card-parties, we should be employed in writing dissertations on government:—Happy reverse!

<P>WHAT most surprises me, is, that the plan was so readily consented to—the parade of the card-table has been so long out of fashion—I did
<PB N="9" REF="019234_0009_0FAA67A092BA28B0" MS="y"/>
not think they would with so much alacrity, have in∣troduced it into a publick assembly—however, we are fond of novelty, and the fascinating charms of high life have too many allurements to be resisted.— We have made a notable caveat—not to play beyond one shilling and six pence upon our HONOUR! there's the rub—Gaming is like a coy mistress, whose meer smiles we at first think a happiness—but when those become familiar, we urge forward to more <HI>substantial</HI> joys.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doct. GALLANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well it is quite right—professional characters must be supported with dignity—otherways, all dis∣tinctions will be lost in the levelling spirit of repub∣licanism—therefore, if we expect to support taste and stile, we must keep up this parade, and by as∣suming an appearance above the commonality, we may stamp on our characters a <HI>superiority</HI> of rank.— This may appear a new doctrine—<HI>that in order to promote distinction, we must introduce all into one society</HI>— but depend upon it, a particular <HI>deportment</HI> observed at such times, more effectually secures pre∣eminence than shutting ones self up from the crowd.</P>

<P>Upon my word, Doctor, you have improved on Chesterfield—I have ever thought that keeping aloof, and only appearing at times, when some im∣portant questions were agitated, would be most likely to secure my importance—a town-meeting harangue, (for instance) I conceived would produce wonderful effects—and then retiring with a peculiar easy air of consequence, would secure the respectful complai∣sance of the whole assembly.</P>

<P>I HAVE been complimented with a Card for a new Entertaiment called Sans Souci.</P>

<P>Have you attended?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>REP. HEROINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Madam, I was a long while consi∣dering whether it was a real or imaginary compliment: I could scarcely believe it possible, that this country, particularly this town, whose name stands foremost in the annals of America, should so early plunge into the utmost excesses of dissipation: How will such an account read among the friends of America in Europe. I could hardly refrain from tears when I entered the Hall, to see the respectable inhabitants of this metropolis, so wantonly introducing a custom of publick card playing, even at so early a period after the war. Forgive me, Madam, my expressing my sentiments so freely; but believe me I have hi∣therto indulged such pleasing ideas respecting this country, from their publick proceedings during the war, that when I find those sentiments of their virtue turn out mere chimeras of my own imagina∣tion, I cannot but lament my disappointment. The
<PB N="12" REF="019234_0012_0FAA67A2B5308808"/>
respect that has been shewn me since my arrival, I most gratefully acknowledge, but often on my re∣tiring from the parade of their entertainments. I can∣not but pity their delusion. I did not carry my en∣thusiasm so far as to expect to find the rigid Spartan principles practised; but I did conceive to be intro∣duced into societies of frugality and oeconomy: I did expect to find a cultivation of manners some∣what similar to their publick resolves; but again par∣don me, Madam, when I inform you I am greatly disappointed. British gewgaws —etiquette and pa∣rade, are too prevailing to be easily eradicated, un∣less some immediate exertions are made to turn this destructive current: As a stranger, I cannot with propriety set up to give examples, but on ladies of established characters in the country, much ought to be expected from them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W—N.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very unhappy to find your observations are so just. I cannot but acknowledge we have too far copied the vices of that nation which we have so late∣ly opposed: But however, I do not think this late entertaiment will be long continued; there are many respectable characters among them, who I am per∣suaded when they consider the dangerous tendency of this assembly, will readily discountenance it. We must be convinced how dangerous to the morals of youth—how destructive to the happiness of families and individuals, an introduction of card parties has ever been; therefore though they have become of the party, which from inattention, rather than from inclination to promote a spirit of dissipation they at
<PB N="13" REF="019234_0013_0FAA67A36E5E4128"/>
first engaged in it; they will readily give up the entertainment, and even discountenance the promoters of it.</P>

<P>I HAVE been to all the Booksellers in town to purchase <HI>Hoyle</HI>; but find they have been all bought up.—There are proposals in the Drawing-Room for a new edition with improvements; also there is to be kept a minute Book for remarks on the game of whist, as many particular cases may take place in the course of play which will render it a valuable collection, as an appendix to this new e∣dition; the whole are to be revised by our D-r-ct—s, and dedicated to them.</P>

<SPEAKER>LITTLE PERT▪</SPEAKER>
<P>A good proposal! Let me see the subscription:— To promote the work I will subscribe for 100 books. However, we are so d —d contracted in this town, we
<PB N="14" REF="019234_0014_0FAA67A44107C758" MS="y"/>
shall never come to a full improvement in the polite arts.—The present card party is a mere burlesque on the institution!—How ridiculous we appear!- A guinea a corner alarms one half of them:—There are but few tables here that dare hazard—I almost scar'd one fellow into panicks, and a lady into hyste∣ricks, by offering to bet ten guineas on the rubber: They made answer they did not play so high.—Was there any thing ever so laughable? What the devil do they come here for? Do they come merely to shuffle a pack of cards? We might as well be in a private party;—let us be something or nothing:— <HI>A card party gingling shillings and six pences</HI>; Ha, ha, ha.—The circle of etiquette with purses of sil∣ver;—this would sound high at BROOKs;—A re∣publican card party; quite a political phaenomenon. However never mind it, Rome was not built in a day;—<HI>free and easy</HI> is our motto, and we are fond of consistency—perseverando.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG FORWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are often bemoaning the want of plays in this town;—this will be a considerable introduction to this entertainment; we can with the greatest pro∣priety ask permission for a theatre after we have been indulged with a card party; for of two evils, plays must be considered the least;—so that we have no∣thing to do, but to resign for a season our card a∣musements until we can get a theatre erected, and af∣ter that we can return to our present entertainment by pleading <HI>precedents</HI>; for we must hold precedents as tenacious in the polite circle, as we lawyers do <HI>authorities</HI> in our profession.</P>

<P>But one essential matter I am afraid we shall be deprived of;—Graham —the celebrated Doctor Gra∣ham;—the coelestial bed;—hah!—here the Cu∣pids would nestle on the downy pillows: Lectures on love;—these are Evening Lectures worth attending to: I dare say he would have a thronged assembly; a full congregation—zealots—enthusiasts—high or∣thodoxy—this would be a hopeful school of good breeding—all well versed in the principles of galan∣try—no awkward modesty, and shame-face'd diffi∣dence—but full confidence—polite amours;—never be afraid, we shall soon pave the way for this amuse∣ment—lectures surely cannot be disapproved—who can object to lectures?—We could blind one half the old women in town, by telling them the cele∣brated Doctor Graham intended to deliver evening lectures on various subjects—they would at least think him a second Whitfield.</P>

As our assembly was somewhat similar to those in England—she (I suppose) thought we did in some degree practice playing, at least to the amount of so triffling a sum— we all stared at each other—for my own part I did not like to tell her we did not play so high, or to inform her of our resolutions to the contrary, as we should make but an indifferent appearance to her, if we supposed such a sum were extravagant—how∣ever, as it was late, I pretended to be fatigued, and threw up my hand, with an apology that I was in∣disposed;—she even seemed surprised at my indis∣position, and exclaimed—<HI>indisposed at a card-table!</HI> I therefore found my complaints were intirely foreign from etiquette—however, I still peristed in my in∣disposition, and the lady observing my embarrass∣ment, politely declined urging me any further.</P>

<P>This is a pretty harangue, brother <HI>Importance,</HI> one would almost suppose you was fee'd by the ladies— but I am sensible you have a good cause, and may be sure of a verdict in your favour. It is a pity you had not always spoke your mind with so much safe∣ty, for nothing is more fatal to a man of fashion than doing any thing reflecting on the ladies—it was ra∣ther unfortunate in your first appearing on the pub∣lick stage, to have such a hue and cry after you— but however, not to call to mind things past—I wish the ladies had heard this late panegyrick.</P>

<P>The Doctor would do to live in Carthage, Sparta, or Rome in the most rigid times; but now those sen∣timents are wholly imaginary ideas of a Republican's coran— they are too antiquated—modern rebublica∣nism is of a very different complexion, as contrasted as the severe countenance of Cromwell, and the pret∣ty smooth face of a petit maitre—those of the Doctor's are principles of republicanism of the un∣civilized kind—but now we soften them down in the school of politeness, and make them wear a more pleasing garb—the antient rebublican spirit is like the old principles of religion—staunch Calvinism— but now we have modernized them, and united them with the court stile of taste and fashion.</P>

<P>The Doctor's sentiments did well enough in war times, when we were under the influence of whig principles—this mercury did very well in our politi∣cal thermometer—but now we have no occasion for this blood heat—they were pleasing doctrines to preach up at that time, but now, why are we to be ding'd with national manners—national debts—oeco∣nomy—industry and such disagreeable subjects?— Independence in the original is my idea—high court independence—independent of every restraint which can mar the pleasures and amusements of life.</P>

<STAGE><HI>The</HI> HALL.—A Card Table.</STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Mr. BON TON, Madam IMPORTANCE▪ Madam BRIL∣LIANT,</HI> and <HI>Dr. GALLANT</HI>▪</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Madam BRILLIANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>A DIAMOND led, Mr. Bon Ton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. BON TON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg pardon, Madam—but there is so much laughing, whispering and talking in the room, that I am quite embarrassed in my play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Madam IMPORTANCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, Sir, you have not been used to play in a social circle—but rather in places where every idea is absorb'd in the game.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. BON TON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, Madam, I have imbibed the manners of Europe so far, that I cannot have ears to attend to conversation, and eyes to observe the variety of objects around me, and at the same time pay so great attention to the play as to know the disposition of the cards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Madam IMPORTANCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find, Sir, you practice wholly on the strictest principles of whist;—but we endeavour to make this game only an evening's amusement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="23" REF="019234_0023_0FAA67AC6DA30778"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. BON TON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amusement, Madam, is not the principle in Eu∣rope; possibly the first institutions of this kind were established on these principles and suppose the sums to be play'd for, were limited, as among us;—but the company which now visit those places of publick resort, do not go for amusement solely, but to pur∣sue a regular branch of business.—They have no idea of playing to pass away a few leisure hours, but to improve the moments for their profit—they are their busy hours—the time on which depends their future prospects. Therefore no conversation while at play is admitted, but what is on the subject of the game, and a person would appear equally as ridiculous to be speaking at that time on any other subject, as to be talking of Hoyle at the tabernacle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Madam BRILLIANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have quite forgot your play, by your lengthy observations.—Hearts are trumps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. BON TON.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have been so, Madam, ever since you entered the room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Madam BRILLIANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose compliments are agreeable to the rules laid down by Hoyle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. BON TON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam, and are often played to great advan∣tage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="019234_0024_0FAA67AD34C52F90"/>
<SPEAKER>Madam IMPORTANCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I always suspect a gentleman's hand when he be∣gins to compliment the lady he plays against.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. BON TON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose, Madam, you conceive it a <HI>finesse</HI>;—at least for the <HI>odd trick.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Madam BRILLIANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose you calculate by the table of chances?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. BON TON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do, Madam, but my success depends on your smiles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor GALLANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray how are we for game?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. BON TON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Madam BRILLIANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, we will for the present be whist, and endeavour to finish before 12 o'clock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. BON TON.</SPEAKER>
<P>The hours pass most rapidly;—but however, Ma∣dam, we must not find fault with time, for in your company <HI>eternity</HI> can be the only measure of our happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Madam BRILLIANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not answer you at present, as it is time to withdraw.</P>
