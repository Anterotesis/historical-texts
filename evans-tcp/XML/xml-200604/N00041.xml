<P><HI>First, is Objected,</HI> That there were but a few in comparison, who Dissented from the major part of the Assembly.</P>
<P>Answ. <HI>Suppose it were so; Is</HI> Truth bound up to Number? <HI>It was, indeed, a sore, Temptation to</HI> Luther, <HI>when it was Objected to him,</HI> Tune solus sapis? <HI>Is there never a wise man in the world but you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> It may be the same thing hath been as great a Temptation to some of us. In the</HI> Council of Constance, <HI>one of the Prelates said unto that blessed Martyr</HI> John Husse,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Histor <HI>John. Husse,</HI> fol 25.</NOTE> That he should never shew himself so Arrogant, as to preferre his own Opi∣nion above the Judgement of the whole Council. <HI>Yet the whole Council (though it were an Universal Council) erred, and this one good man held the Truth against so many. Which we do not mention, as though we would prefer our own Judgements above others; such a thought we abhor. Neither is it is our intentions, any wayes to reflect upon those Honoured and Reverend Persons from whom we</HI> Dissented; <HI>nay, we look upon them as far better then our selves: onely by this In∣stance given, we may see, that in a Council (nay, an</HI> Oecomenical Council) <HI>a few (nay</HI> one) <HI>may dissent from all the rest, and yet neither</HI> Ignorance <HI>nor</HI> Arrogance (<HI>but</HI> Truth <HI>and</HI> Conscience) <HI>be the ground of it. In the</HI> Nicen Council <HI>there was but one</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sozom.</HI> l. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 23. <HI>Magd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b.</HI> cent. 4. l. 7. pag. 486.</NOTE> Paphnutius, <HI>who op∣posed all the rest of the</HI> Synod, <HI>that had concluded upon a gross Errour.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="000078_0005_0F9F8FCD5749DA60"/>
<HI>And if we look into our own Nation, there were but Five</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Tho: Good-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> Mr. Nye, Mr. <HI>Sympson,</HI> Mr <HI>Burr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uges,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bridge.</HI></NOTE> Dissent∣ing Brethren <HI>who maintained the Truth (as we cannot but be per∣swadea) about</HI> Church-Government, <HI>against</HI> Seventy <HI>persons, who were also worthy of Respect and Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onr. Now though our</HI> Assem∣bly <HI>was not so Numerous as that, yet there were more then</HI> Five twice told, <HI>who could not see sufficient Reason to apprehend as others did. And that we are not singular in our apprehensions about those matters of</HI> Controversie <HI>now in agitation, appears from these following Wit∣nesses. Blessed Mr.</HI> Cotton <HI>hath these very words:</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Cotton's Way of the Chur∣ches measured by the Golden Reel of the Sanctuary,</HI> pag. 81.</NOTE> Infants cannot claim right to Baptism, but in the right of one of their Parents or both: where neither of the Parents cannot claim right to the Lords Supper, there their Infants cannot claim right to Baptism. <HI>That Learned man, and Renowned Sufferer for Christ under those</HI> Bloody Fathers, (<HI>as they would needs be styled</HI>) the Prelates, <HI>even Mr.</HI> Burton, <HI>writes after this manner:</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><HI>Burton vindic. of Independent Churches,</HI> p. 62.</NOTE> It is not now under the Gospel, as it was from <HI>Abraham</HI> unto Christ. The Covenant was made with <HI>Abraham</HI> and his seed, so as by <HI>virtue hereof</HI> all the Male-infants of believing <HI>Abraham</HI> were and ought to be Cir∣cumcised: But now, under the Gospel, those onely are accounted <HI>Abrahams</HI> seed, who profess the Faith of <HI>Abraham;</HI> so as that the Covenant is Entailed onely to Believers now, and so to their children, <HI>Acts.</HI> 2. 39. If then the Parents refuse Christ, they cut themselves off from the Covenant, and therewith out off their children. <HI>And Mr.</HI> Beverly <HI>(<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>late ingenious Writer) speaking the judgement of the</HI> Congregational-men in England, <HI>us farre as he had knowledge thereof, hath such passages-as-these:</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><HI>Beverly</HI> against <HI>Timson;</HI> p. 173,174.</NOTE> Let me beseech my Presbyterian Brethren to consider, what sad advantage you give to bold Intrenchments upon the Lords Supper, by your too loose Administring Baptism; me-thinks you do but contradict your selves, when you suspend from one Ordinance Signal, and yet allow the other Ordinance of Baptism, which is as Signal, <HI>&amp;c. Nor was there ever any such inlargement of Baptism, as is here plead∣ed for, practised in any</HI> gathered Churches <HI>in</HI> England, <HI>that ever we knew, or could hear of.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly, it is Objected,</HI> That we deny all Church-membership unto infants, which is a Principle of Anabaptism.</P>

So are we charged with</HI> laying Corner∣stones of Anabaptism; <HI>but this is injuriously laid unto our charger Yet let us not for fear of</HI> Anabaptism, <HI>do worse, even</HI> Defile our selves with Antichristianism. <HI>We are willing to profess, that we look upon it</HI> as great a sin to baptize all Children, (<HI>for that is no less then</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>Dum Sacra∣menta violantur, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pse cujus sunt violatur,</HI> Hieron, in Mal. 1.</NOTE> a violating of God, <HI>as</HI> Jerome <HI>speak</HI>) as to baptize no Children; <HI>though both Opinions, we think, are sinful. Neither can we plead</HI> Guilty <HI>unto that Charge,</HI> That we deny all Church-mem∣bership unto any Infants; <HI>we onely deny</HI> that they are personal and immediate Members. <HI>Indeed, as</HI> personal Membership <HI>is taken</HI> subjectively, <HI>so we say it is in Infants,</HI> i. e. <HI>their persons are</HI> Re∣cipients <HI>of the</HI> Adjunct <HI>of Church-membership: But as</HI> personal Membership <HI>is taken</HI> formally, i. e. <HI>for such as have by themselves in their own persons entred into Covenant with God and his People, so Infants are not capable of</HI> personal Church-membership. <HI>It's strange to us to conceive, that they should have this</HI> personal formal Membership, <HI>and yet that they should not be subjects capable of</HI> for∣mal personal Censures. <HI>We neither do, nor ever did dony,</HI> That the persons of Infants of Believing Confederate Parents are brought under the Covenant; <HI>onely we conceive, that</HI> their Member∣ship is<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">See the first <HI>Essay</HI> of this Re∣verend Author in Manuscript.</NOTE> Conjunct with, and Dependent upon the Membership and Covenant of their Parents, so as to live and die therewith. <HI>Hence Mr.</HI> Cotton <HI>hath these words;</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Cotton, Ho∣liness, of Church-members,</HI> p.63.</NOTE> The Membership of Children (I mean Infants) is sounded in the Faith and Profession of their Parents. <HI>Hence the Childes Membership may continue after the Pa∣rents decease, because his Parents Faith and Covenant may live, though himself be dead; as 'tis said,</HI> Abel being dead, yet speaketh. <HI>So the Covenant, and Faith, and Prayers of a godly man; who is dead, yet live. Hence also, when the Parents are</HI> Excommunicated, <HI>the Membership of the Infant-childe is </HI> cut off, <HI>because</HI> Excommunica∣tion <HI>puts an end to the</HI> Outward Covenant, (<HI>which</HI> Death it self <HI>doth not do;) and if the</HI> Root <HI>be destroyed, the</HI> Branches <HI>cannot live. True it is, that we have made much use of that distinction of</HI> Immediate, <HI>and</HI> Mediate Members, <HI>which seems, to us, to carry a mighty and constraining Evidence of Scripture-light along with it, yea, and so as to salve (if rightly understood and managed) the strongest
<PB REF="000078_0007_0F9F8FCEE90D6640"/>
Objections that are brought against the</HI> Cause <HI>and</HI> Truth <HI>we plead for. And let it be considered, that</HI> Church-members <HI>have been commonly distinguished into</HI> Compleat; <HI>and</HI> Incompleat: <HI>And</HI> Authors <HI>who have been</HI> Stars of the first Magnitude, <HI>if ever there have been such upon Earth, have made use thereof. We might instance in that</HI> Incomparable Champion for the Truth, <HI>and for the</HI> Non-Con∣formists, <HI>against</HI> Prelacy, <HI>Mr.</HI> Robert<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg"><HI>Parker de Pol Eccles.</HI></NOTE> Parker: <HI>so likewise</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ames. Med. Theal</HI> l. 1. c. 32.

<P><HI>Thirdly, it is Objected against us,</HI> That we maintain a strange Opinion, namely, That a person who is a Church-member, may become no Member, by an act (or a defect rather, which may be called an act, as Sins of Omission are termed Actual Sins) of his own, without any Church-act in Censuring of him.</P>
<P>Answ. <HI>Most true it is, that we do</HI> Maintain <HI>this, and must do so, till we see the contrary proved. Neuher do we know that this</HI> Opinion <HI>contains any thing in it dissent any from Scripture or good Reason: Nor see we how some</HI> Arguments <HI>for the Affirmative can fairly be answered. Suppose we an</HI> English Fugitive <HI>that is become a</HI> Priest <HI>in</HI> Antwerp, <HI>or a</HI> Cardinal <HI>at</HI> Rome: <HI>Or suppose we a</HI> Turk <HI>who is an</HI> English-man <HI>by Birth; this</HI> Turk <HI>was baptized a</HI> Member <HI>of some</HI> Parish-Church (<HI>which those that we dispute against mountain to be</HI> true Churches, <HI>and we are farre from denying of it universally) and he was never</HI> Censured <HI>by any</HI> Church <HI>for his</HI> Apo∣stacy: <HI>now we demand,</HI> Whether this Turk be a Member of the Church of Christ, yea or no? <HI>To affirm it, would be gross; To say that</HI> Turks are Members of the Church of Christ, <HI>is in truth to speak</HI> Daggers. <HI>When the</HI> Arch-Flamin Whitgift <HI>said, that</HI> Papists and Atheists might still remain Members of the visible Church: <HI>Mr.</HI> Parker <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><HI>De Pol. Eccles</HI> l. 3. c. 16.</NOTE> <HI>tells him,</HI> That even a <HI>Vorstius</HI> would condemn him. <HI>And it is no new Doctrine in the Schools, to say, that</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg"><HI>Morton Apol. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Catec.</HI> par. 1. l. 1. c. 3.</NOTE> An Heretical Apostate is no more a Member of the Church of Christ, then a Wound, a Sore, or a Brand, is a member of a man; <HI>which none can imagine. The truth of this none can doubt of, that is</HI> mediocritèr doctus <HI>in Scholastical Divinity, Therefore we conclude, that</HI> Church-members may become no Members by their own defection.
<PB REF="000078_0008_0F9F8FCFA2508BC0"/>
<HI>And we humbly conceive (though with submission, at is fit, to better judgements) That thus much is held forth by these Scriptures,</HI> Hebr, 10. 25 1 Joh. 2. 19. Jude <HI>ver.</HI> 19. <HI>Agam, how came</HI> Esau <HI>to lose his</HI> Membership? <HI>We reade not that he was</HI> Excommunicate: <HI>Therefore it remains, that he</HI> dis-Covenanted, <HI>and so</HI> dis-Membered <HI>himself. And how came the Children of</HI> Abraham <HI>by</HI> Keturah <HI>to lose their</HI> Membership? <HI>it was not by</HI> Censure. <HI>In like sort, when person,</HI> under the Gospel, <HI>do not come up to the</HI> terms of the Co∣venant, <HI>to shew themselves to be</HI> Abrahams <HI>Children, by holding forth</HI> his Faith, <HI>and</HI> walking before the Lord in simplicity and goldy sincerity, <HI>we suppose that they are justly deemed</HI> Breakers of the Covenant, <HI>and have justly put themselves</HI> Out of that Covenant which their Parents (<HI>because of their then personal incapacity to act for themselves</HI>) made for them. <HI>Alas! that any should look upon us as</HI> Maintaining dangerous Opinions, <HI>because of this! Wherefore, that all may know, that there is neither</HI> Danger <HI>nor</HI> Sin∣gularity <HI>in this our Assertion,</HI> That a Church-member may pos∣sibly become no Member, without any act of the Church in formal Censuring of him, <HI>give us leave to produce some</HI> Testi∣monies <HI>to prove it.

Thus though God promised <HI>A∣braham</HI> to be a God unto him and his seed, in their generations, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 7. yet the <HI>Ishmaelites</HI> and <HI>Edomites</HI> descending from <HI>Abraham,</HI> were discovenanted, by not promising nor perform∣ing those duties of Faith and Obedience, which God required on the peoples part. <HI>And the same</HI> Truth <HI>is held forth by the same</HI> Author, <HI>in</HI> The Answer to the XXXII. Questions <HI>before-mentioned. This is he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> main thing wherein we</HI> Dissent <HI>from the</HI> ma∣jor part of the Synod. <HI>Now, if this were</HI> Truth <HI>in the Year</HI> 1639. (<HI>as it then had the</HI> Approbation <HI>of the</HI> Elders <HI>hereabouts) we see no reason why it should not be</HI> Truth <HI>in the Year</HI> 1662. <HI>For,</HI> Veritas in omnem parteru sui semper eadem est. <HI>Either this as a</HI> Mistake <HI>then, or else it is a</HI> Truth <HI>at this day. Here let us adde the words of Mr.</HI> Cotton <HI>in his Excellent Treatise of</HI> The Ho∣liness of Church-members, <HI>which are these following:</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Cotton, Ho∣liness of Church-members,</HI> p. 19. c. 41.</NOTE> Such as are Born and Baptized Members of the Church, are not orderly Continued and Confirmed Members, unless when they grow up to years, they do, before the Lord and his People, profess their Repentance and Faith in Jesus Christ. <HI>To say no more of this; Renowned</HI> Parker, <HI>speaking of the Interpretation of those words</HI> [Laying on of Hands] <HI>in</HI> Heb. 6. 2. <HI>cites many judicious Writers, whose judgements be expresseth, in words to this purpose:</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Parker. de Pol. Eccles. in cap de Unione Ecclesiae visibil is,</HI> Sect. 9. c. 13.</NOTE> That they who were baptized in their minority, when they are grown up, after that the Church had approved their Faith by the Symbol of Imposition of Hands, they were admitted Mem∣bers of the Church. This was according to sound Doctrine in the Primitive times (<HI>as</HI> Parker <HI>saith.) Now we demand, How they can be admitted as Members, who are already as compleat and perfect Members as any in the Church? But the ancient Doctrins was,</HI> (<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Tertullion.</HI></NOTE> Antiquissimum unissimum) That Children who were ba∣ptized in their minority, after they shall come to profess their Faith, so as to be accepted of the Church, may be admitted as Members. <HI>Therefore, according to the ancient Doctrine,</HI> Such chil∣dren are not as compleat and perfect Members as any in the Church. <HI>Yea, therefore it follows, That when they are</HI> Adult, <HI>in case they do not, by holding forth Earth and Repentance, joyn unto
<PB REF="000078_0010_0F9F8FD11EF7BFE8"/>
the Church, that then they do not retain their Membership which they had in minority.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly, it hath been Objected,</HI> That we will not suffer Chil∣dren to come under the Watch and Care of the Church.</P>
<P>Answ. <HI>We are so farre from being of that</HI> Opinion, <HI>as that we verily fear there is great guilt lies upon the</HI> Churches, <HI>because they have neglected their duty towards the</HI> Children in question. <HI>It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> clear to us as</HI> the Light at Noon, <HI>or (to use</HI> Tertullians <HI>phrase</HI>) as if it were written with the Beams of the Sun, <HI>That a special Care (even</HI> Church-care) <HI>and Inspection is due, over those</HI> Children that are Born within the Gates of Zion. <HI>Happy might it be for us all, if the issue of these troublesome</HI> Controversies <HI>might be onely to</HI> awaken Churches to stricter Watch and Diligence, in Overseeing those Children that are in minority: <HI>Onely we con∣ceive, that the</HI> Watch over them is to be Mediate, <HI>according to the state of their</HI> Membership. <HI>The Church is to see that the</HI> Parents <HI>do their duty toward their Children, in</HI> bringing them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Luke 13. 7. Acts 8. 21. See Mr. <HI>Daven∣ports</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hookers</HI> Cate∣chism.</NOTE> And if when they shall be adult, they do not bring forth fruits of Repentance and Faith, then (as the Fig-tree which did not bear fruit, was to be cut down) the Church is to disown them, as <HI>having no part in the Lord,</HI> and to declare, that they by their unbelief have Dis∣covenanted themselves. <HI>But we see not sufficient warrant from the</HI> Word of God, <HI>to proceed to a</HI> formal Excommunication <HI>of the</HI> Children in question, <HI>because that is applicable unto none but those who have been in</HI> full Communion. <HI>Now if this be all that is striven after,</HI> That Church-children might be brought under Church-watch, <HI>why should the</HI> Contentions of Brethren be like the bars of a Castle, that cannot yield?</P>
<P><HI>Lastly, it hath been Objected,</HI> That the reason of our Dissent∣ing from the major part of the Synod, was Weakness and Igno∣rance and meer Wilfulness, in that we could bring no Arguments, but what were sufficiently refuted.</P>
<P>Answ. <HI>The very same thing hath been said of those Worthy Champions, who stood up for</HI> the Congregational-Way, in <HI>oppo∣sition to the Assembly at</HI> Westminster, <HI>that</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">See these words in <HI>The Antidote against Indepen∣dency,</HI> by D. p. p. p. 21,22.</NOTE> Their Arguments were weak and ridiculous, and had been Confuted, and sufficiently
<PB REF="000078_0011_0F9F8FD1EB31C8F8"/>
answered, and that themselves were Self-conceited, and Obsti∣nate. <HI>But these</HI> Criminations <HI>were unworthy</HI> Calumniations. <HI>It was a common Reproach cast upon the Christians of old,</HI> That they were all weak and unlearned men: <HI>which made</HI> Jerome <HI>write that Book</HI> De viris Illustribus. <HI>So</HI> Stapleton <HI>makes no bones to call</HI> Whitaker, An Asse, <HI>and</HI> A Fool. <HI>And the same</HI> hissing of the Serpent <HI>have we seen in the</HI> Prelates <HI>against the Renowned</HI> Non∣Conformists. <HI>But, we suppose, their saying so, did not prove it was so. Nevertheless, we are content to accept of the</HI> Charge, <HI>when we are charged with</HI> Weakness and Folly: <HI>Let us</HI> be fools for Christs sake, <HI>or</HI> for his Truth; <HI>Let us</HI> fall, <HI>so the</HI> Truth may rise; <HI>let us</HI> sit in the dust, <HI>so that</HI> Truth may sit in the Throne. <HI>We de∣serve not to be otherwise esteemed, then as</HI> Weakness and Igno∣rance it self: <HI>Yet let us not be reputed</HI> Obstinate, <HI>and such as are and will be blinde, because we dare not</HI> betray the Truth, and sin against our Consciences. <HI>For, our</HI> weightiest Reasons <HI>never were</HI> Answered <HI>unto any tolerable satisfaction, even to this day. If it be demanded here,</HI> What our Reasons were, why we accorded not with the major part of the Synod? <HI>We shall by the help of Christ, and in the fear of God, declare what our chief</HI> Reasons <HI>were, which caused our</HI> Dissent; <HI>which when they are</HI> Answered, <HI>we shall lay down our</HI> Opinion, <HI>as knowing that it is</HI> Nullus pudor ad meliora transire.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Synod did acknowledge, That there ought to be true saving Faith in the Parent, according to the judgement of ratio∣nal charity, or else the childe ought not to be baptized. <HI>We intreated, and urged again &amp; again,</HI> that this, <HI>which they themselves acknowledged was a Principle of Truth,</HI> might be set down for a Conclusion, and then we should all agree. <HI>But those</HI> Reverend Persons <HI>against whom we placidly disputed, would not consent to this, though</HI> our Unity lay at the Stake for it.</P>
<P N="2">2. We have not Warrant in all the Scripture, to apply the Seal of Baptism unto those Children, whose Parents are in a state of unfitness for the Lords Supper. <HI>Those,</HI> Acts 2. 41. who were Baptized, continued breaking Bread <HI>also,</HI> ver.42. <HI>'Tis granted, That those Children were Circumcised amongst the Jews, whose Parents were for a time debarred from the Passeover,
<PB REF="000078_0012_0F9F8FD2A9507E08"/>
but that was onely upon accident of</HI> Ceremonial Uncleanness, <HI>which alters not the case; for,</HI> Unless the father were in a state of fit∣ness for the Passeover, he was not fit to have his childe circum∣cised. <HI>The like may be said concerning the</HI> Gospel-Passeover, <HI>and the</HI> Gospel-Circumcision. <HI>Neither do we reade, that in the Pri∣mitive times</HI> Baptism <HI>was of a greater latitude, as to the</HI> Subject <HI>thereof, then the</HI> Lords Supper: <HI>but the contrary. The</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Catechumeni ad Baptis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erism nunquam admit∣tend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sunt.</HI> Con∣cil.

Ger<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dist.4.</NOTE> Baptism of the Catechumeni <HI>was deferred until then also.

Which</HI> Testimonies <HI>we produce, to shew, that former Ages have been farre from looking upon the</HI> Lords Supper, <HI>as being of a more sacred nature then the other Ordinance of</HI> Baptism. <HI>Indeed of late there have been those who have made</HI> Baptism <HI>of a far larger extent then the</HI> Lords Supper. <HI>This hath been one</HI> practical Difference <HI>between</HI> Congrega∣tional-men <HI>and</HI> Presbyterians (<HI>whom the Lord unite in the Truth</HI>) <HI>in that the</HI> Congregational-men <HI>would baptize the Children of none but such, whose Parents were sit for the</HI> Lords Supper: <HI>when-as the</HI> Presbyterians <HI>would Baptize the Children of such, whose Parents were not sit for the</HI> Lords Supper; <HI>and their promiscuous Admini∣stration of that</HI> Ordinance, <HI>was very grievous unto their</HI> Congrega∣tional Brethren. <HI>See</HI> Beverly <HI>against</HI> Timson.</P>
<P N="3">3.The Parents of the children in question, are not Members of any instituted Church, according to Gospel-Rules, because they were never under any explicite and personal Covenant. <HI>To prove which, we reason thus: If this</HI> second Generation <HI>do retain their Membership by virtue of their Parents Covenant made for them in minority; then, in case all the</HI> pro-Parents <HI>were dead, this</HI> second
<PB REF="000078_0013_0F9F8FD356CBF3E8"/>
Generation <HI>would be a</HI> true Church of Christ, <HI>without any further Act or Covenanting. But this</HI> second Generation <HI>are not a</HI> true Church of Christ <HI>without some further Act.</HI> Ergo, <HI>they do not retain their Membership. If they are a</HI> true Church of Christ <HI>then they have Power to Vote in</HI> Church-affairs, <HI>as to chuse Officers, and to cast out Offenders, and the like; because every</HI> true Church <HI>hath this power given to them by the Lord Jesus, who is the onely</HI> Head of his Church. <HI>But</HI> they have no such Power (<HI>say the Synod, who do expressly</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">See the <HI>Answ. to</HI> 21 <HI>Questions.</HI></NOTE> <HI>exclude the persons in question from the Lords Supper and Voting:</HI>)<HI>Therefore we conclude that they are no</HI> true Church of Christ. <HI>Therefore the persons in question do not re∣tain their Membership; therefore their children ought not to be Ba∣ptized.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. It is not Meer Membership,(<HI>as the Synod speaks</HI>) but quali∣fied Membership that gives right unto Baptism. <HI>For the evincing whereof, we argue thus:</HI> John's Baptism <HI>was</HI> Christian Baptism, (<HI>as all our Divines maintain against the Papists</HI>) John's Baptism <HI>might not be applied unto some, who were standing Members of the visible Church, because they were not qualified with</HI> Repentance, Luke 3.8. &amp; 7.30. <HI>Therefore</HI> Christian Baptism <HI>is not to be ap∣plied unto such as stand Members in the visible Church, if they be not qualified with</HI> fruits of Repentance. <HI>This seems to us to cut the Sinews of the strongest</HI> Arguments <HI>which are brought by the</HI> Synod <HI>for the</HI> Enlargement of Baptism: <HI>for, their strongest</HI> Argument▪ <HI>is</HI> the Membership of the Children <HI>in Controversie; when-as it seems to us, that the Scripture doth not acknowledge any such</HI> Meer Membership <HI>as they speak of. And besides that, the case is clear in our apprehension, from the Instance given, That 'tis not</HI> Meer Mem∣bership, <HI>but</HI> qualified Membership, <HI>that gives right unto this Di∣vine and Sacred Ordinance.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. That which will not make a man capable of receiving Baptism himself, in case he were unbaptized, doth not make him capable of transmitting right of Baptism unto his childe. <HI>It is a Ruled case,</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Hooker, Survey,</HI> part.3. p.17.</NOTE> That he that hath not Title himself unto any Priviledge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cannot entitle another. <HI>The lawyer saith,</HI> Acts (<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> non <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI>) are invalid. <HI>But all that the Synod hath said, will not give a man right to Baptism himself, in case he were un∣baptized
<PB REF="000078_0014_0F9F8FD416FBBA60"/>
for a man may be an unbeliever, and yet come up to all that the Synod hath said in their</HI> fifth Proposition, <HI>and more too.</HI> Ergo, <HI>all that the Synod hath said, is not enough to make a man ca∣pable of transmitting right of Baptism unto his childe. The judge∣ment of that famous</HI> Mattin Bucer, <HI>alledged and approved by</HI> Par∣ker, <HI>is worthy our consideration, who maintained, that</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bucer do reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Christi, in cap. de Confirmatione.</HI> Parker ubi Supra.</NOTE> None ought to be confirmed Members of the Church, besides those who do hold forth not onely verbal Profession of Faith, but apparent Signs of Regeneration. <HI>Nay, these great Divines Say, That if there he not</HI> tam necessaria signa fidei quam publica &amp; solennis Professio, <HI>as well</HI> such signs and outward appearances of Faith as shall necessarily argue (<HI>as farre as men can judge</HI>) that there is truth in the heart, as a publick solemn Profession, the Church ought not to accept of the Professions of such persons; so as to confirm them in their Membership. <HI>It the Synod would but have expressed as much as this, there had been no</HI> Dissenting <HI>on our parts. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re also we cannot but take notice, that the judgement of that worthy and for-ever famous Mr.</HI> Cotton <HI>Was as ours is; for his words are these:</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg"><HI>Holiness of Church-members,</HI> P.93.</NOTE> I conceive more positive fruits of Regene∣ration are required in the Church-members of the New Testa∣ment, then of the Old.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Application of the Seal of Baptism unto those who are not true Believers (<HI>we mean visibly, for</HI> de occultis non judicat Ecclesiâ) is a Profanation thereof, and as dreadful a sin, as if a man should administer the Lords Supper unto unworthy receivers, which is (<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI><NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg"><HI>Instit.</HI> l.4.6.12.</NOTE> Calvin <HI>saith</HI>) as sacrilegious impiety, as if a man should take the Blood or Body of Christ, and prostitute it to dogs. <HI>We marvel that any should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that the Blood of Christ is not as much profaned and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by</HI> undue Administration of Baptism, <HI>as by</HI> undue Administration of the Lords Supper. <HI>Yea, that saying of</HI> Austin's <HI>is solemn and serious,</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><HI>August, contra Fulgent. c.6.</HI></NOTE> Qui indign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> accipit Baptisma, judicium accipit non salutem. <HI>He who receives Baptism, either for himself or his childe, unworthily, is guilty of the Blood of Jesus, as well as he who receives the Lords Supper unworthyily.

If ever it be passant Doctrine in the Churches, that others have a right to it, Farewell to <HI>New-England'</HI>s Peculiar Glory of undefiled Administrations of holy things. These things are Discouragements with me, from hastening to <HI>New-England. Thus he. It may be some will think that we do</HI> (<HI>as it is in the Adagy</HI>) Nodum in scirpo quaerere, <HI>make scruples to our selves, and fear where there is no fear: Well it will be for us, and for the Churches, if in the end it prove so.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now the Lord grant, that his People may have</HI> one heart and one way (<HI>and that it may be the</HI> right way, <HI>even the</HI> way which is called Holy) to serve him, for the good of them, and of their Children after them. <HI>And the God of</HI> Truth <HI>and</HI> Peace, <HI>lead us by his Spirit into</HI> all Truth, <HI>through him who is made unto us of God,</HI> the Way, and the Truth, and the Life.</P>

<HEAD>CERTAIN POSITIONS Out of the HOLY SCRIPTURES, Premised to the whole ensuing DISCOURSE.</HEAD>
<P>WEE may fitly begin this Discourse, with what the Reverend Elders say (in their Preface to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Printed Book) That the Prayer of <HI>Ep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> for the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</HI> ought to be the Prayer and Labour of us all, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>That we may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> perfect and comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a in all the will of God.</HI> And it is a good Profession which they make, saying, <HI>We trust it is our sincere desire, that his will, all his will, and nothing but his will may be done among us. To the Law and to the Testimony we do wholly referre our selves; and if any thing in the following Conclusions be indeed found not to speak according thereunto, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it be rejected.</HI> This doth encourage me to joyn with them, in seeking, the right path in this unfrequented way▪ so far as the Glory of Gods Holiness and Grace, together with the honour of his Truth, may be manifested to be dearer to us then all Creature∣concernments and Self-respects. In order whereunto, I conceive our principal inquiry should be, what those more general Princi∣ples of Truth are, which lie in the things cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted, and how they may be rightly applied: using <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n onely such Light as the Scripture affordeth, by comparing one Text with another, and depending on God in Christ for supply and assistance of the Spirit of Truth to lead us into these Principles, and to teach us by them; that thereby we may be brought to an universal harmony
<PB N="2" REF="000078_0017_0F9F8FD65C0D0BA8"/>
of Truth; all the Lines of Truth (however separated in the Cir∣cumference) meeting together in these Principles, as in their Centre, and becoming one Point. The finding out of such Princi∣ples, and rightly applying them, would make the way to Truth shorter, the mystery of Truth clearer, and the united force of Truth stronger against Errour, a sweeter closing of Spirits among good men, and the examining of other mens Opinions easier, then walking after the larger Circumference of the voluminous Writings of men, which lead us further from these Principles, then the Scripture alone. This is that which I would attain, and am pressing after, as in other Controversies, so in these Questions. For clearing the truth wherein, I shill first propound certain <HI>Theses,</HI> or <HI>Positions:</HI> Secondly apply them, in a way of <HI>Replying</HI> to their <HI>Propositions.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="9" REF="000078_0024_0F9F8FDC4E7A5838"/>
The first Question propounded to them by the Honoured Ge∣neral Court, was,</P>
<Q><P>Quest. 1. <HI>Who are the Subjects of Baptism?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. <HI>The Answer may be given in the following Propositions.</HI> Which are seven in number.</P>
<P>Propos. 1. <HI>They that according to Scripture, are Members of the visible Church, are the Subjects of Baptism.</HI></P>
<P>Propos. 2. <HI>The Members of the visible Church, according to Scripture, are Confederate visible Believer, in particular Churches, and their infant-seed,</HI> i. e. <HI>children in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, whose next Parents, one or both, are in Covenant.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> I cannot approve the two first Propositions, without some change of the terms. In the first, thus; they that, ac∣cording to Christ's Ordinance, <HI>are regular, and actual Mem∣bers,</HI> &amp;c. The second, thus; <HI>The actual and regular Members of the visible Church, according to Christs Ordinance, are,</HI> &amp;c. The necessity of this alteration with appear, if, either the premised Positions be duely considered, wherewith these Proposition will not otherwise agree: or, if the Proofs alledged by them from Scripture for confirmation of these two Propositions, be duely examined; or, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f what is hereafter to be Replied unto the fol∣lowing Propositions, shall be duely weighed.</P>
<P><Q>Propos. 3. <HI>The infant-seed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f confederate visible believers, are Members of the same Church with their Parents, and when grown up, are personally under the Watc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Discipline and Go∣vernment of the Church.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This Proposition consisteth of two parts, both which they endeavour to prove distinctly.</P>
<P N="1"><Q><HI>1. That they are Members of the same Church with their Pa∣rent</HI></Q>] This may pass in a rig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t sense, being understood of <HI>Meditate Members,</HI> in and by their Parents covenanting for them, in their infancy, or minority. I shall not oppose it.</P>
<P N="2"><Q><HI>2. That when they are grow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, they are personally under that Watch, Discipline and Government of the Church</HI></Q>] This expression calls for serious consideration, and the Proofs of it require due examination. 1. For the Expression the meaning of it seems to be this; That when the children, that were baptized in their
<PB N="10" REF="000078_0025_0F9F8FE0E412FC40"/>
minority, are grown up to years of discretion, or become men, they are Members, (or, as they speak afterward, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Memory</HI>) and by that membership, are under the Watch, Discipline, and Government of the Church. But what membership is this? Their membership in their minority, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd by their Parents covenanting for them, as themselves say in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> 14. and answerably, they are under the Watch of the Church in and by their Parents, who are immediately, and personally under the Watch, Discipline and Government of the Church, which is to see that the Parents do their duty, and perform their Covenant for them, in <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inging them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, Eph.</HI> 6. 4, and to help them therein.</P>
<P>But by what right are they personally under the Watch Disci∣pline, and Government of the Church? Not by their Parents Covenant: for that was theirs onely in their infancy, and mino∣rity; because then they were not capable of covenanting for themselves personally. It remains then, that, when grown up, they must be, either not members of the Church personally▪ or members by their personal covenanting for themselves and theirs, as other adult persons must be who offer themselves to Church-fellowship: Else, though they were members o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the same Church with their Parents, in their infancy, and minority; yet they con∣tinue not members when grown up, not are personally under the Watch, Discipline, and Government of the Church, by their own fault. But they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay the contrary is manifest. Therefore let us examine their Arguments.</P>

<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Though it seems to them plain yet it seems not suf∣ficiently cleared by their Proofs. <Q>1. <HI>From</HI> 1 Cor. 11. 28,29. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as come to the Lords Supper, be able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Lords Body; else they will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> unworthily, and eat and drink damnation, or judge∣ment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they partake of this Ordinance.

and discern the Lords Body, as in the children of the Covenant that grow up to years is too often seen.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> 1. The want of such abilities in the children of the Covenant, is indeed too often seen, through the too frequent neglect of Parents in their Education, and of Ministers and Churches in their Institution, and Catecl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zing, and Watching over them: which should awaken their circumspection in looking narrowly to their fitness for <HI>personal Membership</HI> when they grow up to years.</P>
<P N="2">2. Though Membership be separable from, yea destitute of such ability in the infant-seed, or children of the Covenant in their minority, and therefore they are not to be admitted unto the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> and that text proyes it; yet it may not be granted that, when they are grown up to years, they are, and continue Members regu∣larly, being through want of that ability not fit for Church-com∣munion personally. For as if adult persons, being unbaptiz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, should desire to have the Covenant, and their Church-member∣ship sealed by Baptism, they must hold forth Faith in Christ, wrought in their hearts, as <HI>Philip</HI> required the Eunuch, before they may be baptized, <HI>Acts</HI> 8. 36 37. So, by parity of reason, if one baptized in infancy, being grown up to years, desires to be joyned to the Church by his own personal Right he must hold forth his personal Faith in the Son of God, to their charitable sa∣tisfaction, that they may know his ability <HI>to examine himself, and discern the Lords Body,</HI> before they admit him into <HI>personal Mem∣bership,</HI> which infers full communion with the Church.</P>
<P><Q>2.

<P><HI>Reply.</HI> The children in question, are children of Parents who are not members in full communion with the Church, and so not regu∣larly personal Members. If such &amp; their children, be denied to have any part in the Lord, it is the degenerate Parents, not the Chur∣ches fault. They who are not in Church-communion, cannot regularly communicate unto their infant-seed a right and title to Baptism, which is the first visible Seal of Church-communion, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 13. 2. It is not true, that the Churches denying Ba∣ptism to the children in question, is a denial of the children of the Church to have any part in the Lord; for such are not, accord∣ing to Scripture Rules▪ children of the Church successively: for the Parents have cut off the Entail of the Covenant from them∣selves and their seed, by their not confederating for themselves and theirs regularly. 3. That <HI>this denial hath a dangerous ten∣dency to I religion and Apostacy,</HI> is not proved by them, nor can be. That Text in <HI>Josh.</HI> 22. 24,25. speaks nothing for their advantage in this case; for the men there spoken of, were Members in full communion with the Church of Israel, and their children, when they were grown up, were joyned in Covenant personally, and immediately with the Lord and his Church, by a solemn Cove∣nant, every third year, <HI>Deut.</HI> 26. 17,18. which was to continue in <HI>Canaan,</HI> throughout their generations, till the coming of Christ. So that they had a part in the Lord successively, from which if they had been excluded causl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sly, it might have caused their chil∣dren to cease from fearing the Lord.

It is true, that the frame of the Covenant runs, <HI>To us, and to our seed after us in their gene∣rations;</HI> but it must be understood and applied suitably to the dif∣ferent constitution of Churches, under different administrations of the Covenant, under the Old Testament, and under the Gospel.</P>

<P><HI>Reply.</HI> It is indeed the Churches glory to keep in the Line, and under the influence and efficacy of this Covenant, successively, when the Spirit, as a free Agent, brings any into that Line, and under that efficacy of the Covenant, by succession in Faith, as he did <HI>Lois</HI> the Grandmother, and <HI>Eunice</HI> the Daughter, and <HI>Ti∣mothy</HI> her Grandchilde, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 5. That is the only true Gospel succession, when it is made visible to the Churches charitable judgement, according to Gospel Rules. But that cannot de done, by setting up such a <HI>Meer Membership</HI> in Christian Churches, whereby the infants shall be baptized, by a right derived to them from Parents, who are not in full communion with the Church by their personal Membership. What influence and efficacy hath the Covenant upon such Parents as are in such a Membership, wherein the Church judgeth them unfit for communion? and that, not for any Scandal given by them, after their admission, but for the nature of their <HI>Meer Membership.</HI> To disavow such a Membership, is so far from cutting off the prosperity of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on,</HI> and from hind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing it from being, as in the most glorious times it

<P>But they argue; <Q><HI>T is progress of the Covenant establisheth the Church,</HI> Deut. 29 13. Jer 30 20. <HI>Therefore the contrary doth dis∣establish it.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> The Argument is to be denied. For, it will not follow, that, if God did establish the Church of the Jews before the coming of Christ, by such a successive progress of the Covenant in <HI>Deut.</HI> 29. 13. therefore he doth so now. As for the place <HI>Jer.</HI> 30 20. where it is said, that <HI>the children of the Jews shall be as aforetime;</HI> it is meant only of their outward condition, that it shall be as good as before the Captivity. See <HI>Engl. Annot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</HI> This place then is imper∣tinent to Circumcision or Baptism. But there is a manifest diffe∣rence between the constitution of these Churches. The Church of the Jews before Christ, was for the matter of it, of the Israelites descended from <HI>Jacob,</HI> by successive natural propagation; yet this successive progress of the Covenant, did not then establish the whole Church of Israel in the twelve Tribes: for the ten Tribes f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll off under <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eroboan,</HI> and never returned again. The Church of the Jews that shall be under the <HI>New Jerusalem,</HI> must consist, for the matter of it, of Elect and Sincere Believers onely, both they and their children successively to the end of the world, according to the Prophesies in <HI>Isa.</HI> 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 15. <HI>&amp;</HI> 50. 21. <HI>Jer.</HI> 32. 39. Ezek. 37. 25—28. <HI>Psal.</HI> 102. 16,28 and sundry other places. But Chri∣stian Churches among the Gentiles now are constituted of visible Believers, for the matter of them, among whom sundry close Hypocrites creep in. The progress of the Covenant in them, by Christs Ordinance, is thus far successive, that the children in mi∣nority of confederate visible Believers shall be baptized, and thereby bound, when they become adult, to perform the Cove∣nant in their own persons, and to confederate for themselves and theirs, as their godly Parents did before them: which if they do not those Parents by their degeneracy stop the successive progress of the Covenant: In which case, Christ doth not allow the Churches to provide for a succession by setting up a <HI>Meer Mem∣bership</HI> of adult persons, that are visibly unfit for Church com∣munion

in all Ordinances. Such irregular bringing of men into Membership, will unavoidably bring in the corrupting of Reli∣gion, which will end in Apostacy.

The application is easie. I proceed to ex∣amine their sixth Argument.</P>
<P><Q>Arg. 6. <HI>The Parents in question are personal, immediate, and yet-continuing Members of the Church.</HI> This they endeavour to prove in the terms severally. 1. <HI>That they are personal Mem∣bers, or Members in their own persons, appears,</HI> 1. <HI>Because they are personally holy.</HI> 2. <HI>Because they are personally baptized.</HI> 3. <HI>They are personally liable to Church-censures.</HI> 4. <HI>They are personally, by means of the Covenant, in a visible state of Salvation.</HI> 5. <HI>When they commit iniquity, they personally break the Cove∣nant.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> The Argument hath <HI>Parents</HI> for its Subject, but most of the Proofs belong onely to <HI>Infants;</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> three of them; the other two belong onely to adult persons, regularly admitted into Church-membership, which therefore doth not concern the Pa∣rents in question. There are two sorts of Church-members, and both are accounted holy: 1. <HI>Children of Confederates in their mi∣nority,</HI> whose right to Membership is from their relation to con∣federate Parents covenanting for them; whence they are holy, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 14. though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in their persons, yet foederally &amp; relatively. 2.

By <HI>means of the Covenant▪ their persons are in a visible state of Salvation;</HI> while no∣thing appears to the contrary. 2. <HI>Adult persons,</HI> whose Mem∣bership is founded in their own personal Faith, made visible to the regular satisfaction of the Church. To these the other two
<PB N="36" REF="000078_0051_0F9F900116F00A30"/>
properties do agree: 1. That <HI>they are personally under Discipline, and liable to Church-censures in their own persons.</HI> See Propos 3. examined. 2. <HI>When they personally commit iniquity, they personally break the Covenant.</HI> This is not proved concerning infants, nor can be; for that in <HI>Jer.</HI> 11. 2,10. is spoken by the Prophet to the men of <HI>Iudah:</HI> so that in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.</P>
<P N="2"><Q>2. They say, that <HI>Children are immediate Members, as to the essence of Membership;</HI> i. e. <HI>they themselves in their own per∣sons are the immediate Subjects of this Adjunct, Membership, though they came to it by means of their Parents covenanting.</HI> This, they say, <HI>appears by like Reasons</HI> as the former.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> By what is answered to the former, it appears, that personal Membership is of two sorts; 1. <HI>Purely,</HI> or <HI>meerly Per∣sonal;</HI> such is the Membership of adult persons regularly admit∣ted: for their Membership is both <HI>subjectively,</HI> and <HI>formally</HI> per∣sonal, by their orderly covenanting for themselves. 2. <HI>Mixtly Personal;</HI> such is the Membership of the infants and chil∣dren in minority of confederate Parents. For their Membership is onely <HI>subjectively Personal,</HI> but <HI>formally Relative,</HI> by their Pa∣rents covenanting for them, they being unable to covenant for themselves. To apply this to childrens Membership, which they unfitly style <HI>Immediate:</HI> I say, <HI>unfitly;</HI> for two things are requi∣site to the denominating of a <HI>Member,</HI> Mediate or Immediate, 1. <HI>To an Immediate Member,</HI> that his Membership arise 1. From his personal Faith, made visible to the Church. 2. From his personal Confederating with the Lord and his Church, for himself and his seed Such an one is an <HI>Immediate Member,</HI> because his Membership is from himself, as well as in himself. 2. <HI>To a Me∣diate Member,</HI> 1. That is Membership ariseth, not from his personal Faith made visible to the Church, whereof he is not capable, but from his believing confederate Parents. 2. That it is from such Parents covenanting for him. Such an one is a <HI>Me∣diate Member,</HI> because his Membership, though it is <HI>subjectively</HI> in himself, yet it is <HI>relatively</HI> from his Parents. Whence it will follow, that this kinde of Membership is peculiar to such infants and children in minority, onely during their non-age. This di∣stinction of <HI>Mediate</HI> and <HI>Immediate Church-members,</HI> the Writers
<PB N="37" REF="000078_0052_0F9F9001DF985548"/>
of that Book exagitate causlesly, saying, <Q><HI>As touching that distinction of Mediate and Immediate, as applied to Membership, (which some urge) we are to distinguish</HI> 1. <HI>Between the Efficient and Essence of Membership.</HI> 2. <HI>Between the Instrumental Efficient and Means thereof, which is the Parents profession and covenant∣ing, and the Principal Efficient, which is Divine Institution. They may be said to be mediate (or rather mediately) members, as they become members by means of their Parents covenanting, as an in∣strumental cause thereof.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> I look at believing confederate Parents, not as the in∣strumental, but as the procreant cause, as of the childes natural being, by his generating him; so also of his Church-member∣ship, by his confederating for him, and this by Gods Institution: therefore I chuse rather to call him a <HI>mediate member,</HI> then to say he is a <HI>member immediately;</HI> to shew, that the childes Member∣ship differs from the Parents <HI>specifically,</HI> or in the kinde of Mem∣bership. For, the childes Membership is <HI>Relative,</HI> in it Essence, though <HI>Personal,</HI> in its Subject; which doth vary the Essence, or Nature of it, from the Parents, which is both in its Essence and Subject <HI>meerly Personal. Divine Institution</HI> giveth a <HI>real,</HI> and <HI>mixtly personal membership</HI> to such children by their Parents cove∣nanting for them, as the <HI>immediate procreant cause of their member∣ship,</HI> whereby the children become mediate Members, <HI>i. e. medi∣ante Parentum foedere,</HI> which gives Being to the Membership of such children, and differenceth it from the Membership of adult persons. <HI>Divine Institution,</HI> though it doth not make every Pa∣rent a <HI>Publick Person,</HI> against which Title I excepted in my <HI>first Essay,</HI> and whereunto I finde no Answer here: Yet it makes such Parents Covenant to be Obligatory to such children▪ and the Parents act in covenanting for the childe, to be the childes act <HI>interpretatively,</HI> not <HI>formally,</HI> so as to make the childe an imme∣diate Member thereby.</P>
<P><Q>They adde, <HI>Hence the Essence of membership,</HI> i. e. <HI>Covenant-interest, or a place and portion within the visible Church, is really, properly, personally and immediately the portion of the childe by Divine Gift and Grant,</HI> Josh. 22. 25,27.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> The interest in the Covenant, and thereby <HI>a place and
<PB N="38" REF="000078_0053_0F9F90029636AD10"/>
portion in the visible Church,</HI> is twofold: 1. <HI>A Childes interest and portion;</HI> which is in and by the Parents covenanting for him, and so is mediate. 2. <HI>A Mans interest and portion;</HI> which is by his own covenanting for himself and his childe, and so is imme∣diate. Though nothing comes between to sever the <HI>Adjunct</HI> from the <HI>Subject; The Childe,</HI> from <HI>A portion in the Lord:</HI> yet something comes between to bring that <HI>Adjunct</HI> and <HI>Subject</HI> to∣gether; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>The Parents covenanting for the Childe;</HI> which if it did not come between, they would be severed, as they are in other children, who have no such portion in the Lord, through their want of such Parents to covenant for them. Therefore the Membership of the Infants of confederates is truly and pro∣perly said to be mediate.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Again, though their visible ingraffing into Christ the Head, and so into the Church his Body, is sealed in their Baptism:</HI> and though <HI>in ingraffing, nothing comes between the graft and the stock; Their union is immediate.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Yet it will not follow, that <HI>they are immediate members of the visible Church:</HI> For, the union between Christ and the Church, and all visible Church-members, is not properly, but Metaphorically called <HI>Ingraffing,</HI> because there is some similitude of this Spiritual Union in Material and Corporal Ingraffing. Now similitudes do not run on four feet (as we commonly say) it sufficeth that they agree in the main point of Union: Whether that Spiritual Union, which is likened to corporal ingraffing of a graft to the stock of a Tree, be mediate, as that of confederate Infants is, or immediate, as that of Parents and adult persons is; both may be called <HI>Ingraffing,</HI> in respect of the event, which the Apostle notes in <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 17. that <HI>both, together with other branches or members, partake of the root and fatness of the Olive-tree,</HI> suit∣ably to their union with it. Mediate Members, as Infants, and children in minority, partake of Baptism, and the special In∣struction, Prayers, Blessing, and Watch of the Church, by their Parents covenanting for them: But Parents and adult persons, being immediate Members by their personal covenanting for themselves and their seed, partake of the <HI>root and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ness of the Olive-tree,</HI> in all Ordinances, as, <HI>The Lords Supper, and liberty of

Paul</HI> knew no such <HI>meer membership</HI> as they set up, who shall by their personal Membership be under the Watch, Discipline, and Censures of the Church, and have their children Baptized, but not partake of other Priviledges to∣gether with other adult Members, no offence intervening after their admission to put them under Church-censure, and so to de∣bar them regularly as delinquent Members, from full commu∣nion. So that this Text makes nothing for them in the case of Infants, but much against them, in the case of adult persons <HI>meer Membership.</HI> Nor doth that Text in <HI>Deut</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 11.

<P><HI>Reply.</HI> All that they have here expressed, doth not supply

what is wanting to little children, to invest them with an <HI>actual, compleat, proper, absolute, and immediate membership.</HI> For, though they are in Covenant, which is the <HI>formalis ratio</HI> of their Mem∣bership, yet it is mediately, (i. e. <HI>mediante Parentum foedere</HI>) and so their Membership is mediate. 2. Divine Institution giants unto the little children of his people such a portion in his Church as they are capable of, during their minority, and ap∣points them to be such Members, as such covenanting of Pa∣rents for them can make them. 3. This Divine Institution makes their Parents Undertakers for such children, and them bound, by their Parents acting, to perform that Covenant, when they shall become capable, and when they grow fit, to covenant with the Lord and his people for themselves and theirs, and so to be regu∣larly, in their own persons, by their personal act, immediate Mem∣bers. So that there is wanting unto children in minority, <HI>to make them actual, compleat, proper, absolute, and immediate Mem∣bers,</HI> A personal fitness in themselves, to act in orderly covenant∣ing for themselves, which is required in all adult persons unto immediate Membership. When one comes to be in Covenant in one way, an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her in another way; though both are in Co∣venant, yet these different wayes makes their being in the Cove∣nant different, and so their Membership. He that comes to be in the Covenant by his own immediate acting, is an immediate Member: He that comes into it by anothers acting for him, is a mediate Member. For, though we are as truly, personally, and immediately Members of the Body of faln Mankinde, and by Nature Heirs of Condemnation, as <HI>Adam</HI> was, though he came to it by his own personal act, and we by the act of our publick person; yet that doth not suit the case of Infants in que∣stion: for, 1. <HI>Adam</HI> stood as a publick person, in whose loyns all Mankinde were under the first Covenant, and to be happy or condemned, by his standing or falling. No Parent is such a publick person covenanting for all his Posterity, but for his In∣fants, and children in minority, while they are such, leaving his adult children to Covenant for themselves, if he hath any such children, when himself enters into Covenant. 2. <HI>Adams</HI> Cove∣nant was onely with the Lord, not with any Church, as the Co∣venant
<PB N="41" REF="000078_0056_0F9F9004DCCA0E60"/>
of confederate Parents is; and therefore, if <HI>Adam</HI> had stood, his posterity had not been Church-members thereby, as the infants of Church-confederates. 3. Nor doth the Parents breaking his Covenant, make his children Heirs of Condemna∣tion, as <HI>Adams</HI> did all Mankinde. So that this example of <HI>Adam</HI> is impertinently produced in this case of infants, and their Parents confederating for them, not as their publick person, but as Undertakers for their infant-seed by Gods Institution. Nor indeed is any to be accounted a publick person, as <HI>Adam</HI> was, but Jesus Christ, for all that are in him, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 14,to 20. Nor doth their similitude of <HI>a Prince giving Lands to a man and his heirs suc∣cessively, while they continue loyal,</HI> suit the case in question, concern∣ing Infants, who cannot be visibly disloyal; nor that, concerning adult persons not regularly joyned to the Church, as immediate Members, whose Parents were godly when they covenanted for them in their infancy. For, they have cut off the Entail of the Covenant from themselves and their Posterity, by their personal disloyalty: so that nothing is given to them and theirs by their Covenant which they presume to usurp, without warrant from God. They say true, that <Q><HI>A member is one, who, according to Rule (or according to divine Institution) is within the visible Church:</HI></Q> But that refutes nothing that I have said, concerning mediate and immediate Members; for both are within the Church, according to Rule and Divine Institution, though both have not full commu∣nion with the Church in all Ordinances, which is the priviledge of all adult persons, who are immediate Members by their own personal right, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 12. They frame an Objection thus:</P>
<P><Q>Obj. <HI>If children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e compleat and immediate members, as their Parents are, then they shall immediately have all Church-priviledges as their Parents have, without any further act or qualification.</HI></Q> And they Answer it thus: <Q>Ans. <HI>It followeth not. All priviledges that belong to members, as such, do belong to the children as well as to the parents: But all Church-priviledges do not so. A member, as such, (or all member) may not partake of all priviledges, but they are to make progress, both in memberly duties and priviledges, as their age, and capacity, and qualifications do fit them for the same.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> The intendment of the Objection (as I apprehend) is to
<PB N="42" REF="000078_0057_0F9F9005919D56A0"/>
shew, that compleat and immediate Membership, as such, doth infer compleat and immediate communion in all Church-privi∣ledges: But children in minority have not compleat and immediate communion in all Church-priviledges, without some further act or qualification: Therefore such children are not compleat and immediate Members, as such. Now to this, their Answer is insufficient: For, the best Members have need to make pro∣gress in memberly duties and qualifications, to fit them more and more for Church-priviledges. Yet all have that communion that suits their Membership: <HI>Infants,</HI> in Baptism, the Watch, Prayers, and Blessing of the Church, by their Parents covenanting for them: <HI>Adult persons, orderly and regularly joyned by their per∣sonal covenanting for themselves,</HI> in the Seals, Voting, and Censures, which belong to them, as such Members. Nor doth the Scripture any where allow the Church to admit any one by personal cove∣nanting for themselves and theirs, into any other Membership then compleat and immediate. But Infants are not capable of such Membership, without some further personal act and qualification, when they shall become adult. Therefore their Infant-mem∣bership is not compleat and immediate.</P>
<P N="3"><Q>3. <HI>That their Membership still continues in adult age, and ceaseth not with their Infancy, appears,</HI> 1. <HI>Because in Scripture persons are broken off onely for notorious sins, or incorrigible impenitency and unbelief, not for growing up to adult age,</HI> Rom. 11. 20.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> 1. When I affirm, that their mediate Membership con∣tinueth during their minority, while they are under the Institution and Government of Parents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I deny that that Membership continues in adult age, and when they are at their own disposal, or have children of their own to covenant for: because then the reason of their <HI>mediate Membership</HI> ceaseth, they being by age capable of covenanting for themselves. 2. Their first Reason doth not prove, that the Membership of all baptized in Infancy, continues in adult age: For the Text alledged, speaketh onely of such as have been received into compleat and immediate member∣ship regularly, by their personal Faith and Covenanting with the Church visibly, who are broken off, either by the just judgement of God, as the unbelieving Nation of the Jews are, or by the
<PB N="43" REF="000078_0058_0F9F9006518C5328"/>
just Censure of the Church. Whereas our question is, not of such, but of adult persons, that break off themselves from the Covenant, by profane neglect, or contempt of the Ordinances, or unsuitable Conversation. Who ever said, that any were broken off for growing up to adult age? Such intimations should be forborn by godly men.</P>
<P N="2"><Q>2.<HI>The Jews children circumcised did not cease to be members by growing up, but continued in the Church, and were by virtue of their membership received in infancy, bound unto various duties, and in special unto those solemn professions that pertained unto adult mem∣bers, not as then entring into a new membership, but as making pro∣gress in memberly duties,</HI> Deut. 26. 2—10. &amp; 16. 16,17. with Gal. 5. 3.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> 1. That the Jews children circumcised were bound to various duties, and to <HI>those solemn professions that pertained to adult members,</HI> when themselves were grown up, is clear enough by the Texts alledged, and sundry other. Whereunto I willingly adde, that <HI>Baptism also bindeth the Infant-seed of Confederates to various Gospel-duties, and especially this, of using all means that Faith may be wrought in their hearts, unto obeying the Call of God, and then holding forth their Faith unto the Church, that they may take hold of the Co∣venant for themselves and theirs, and so become compleat and imme∣diate Members.</HI> But 2. It is not proved, by those Texts, that when they were adult, they did not enter into a new Member∣ship; rather the contrary appears in <HI>Deut.</HI> 26. 17,18. For, they entred into that Covenant personally and immediately, not in and by their Parents, as they did in Infancy, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 7. If covenant∣ing be <HI>the Form of Church-membership,</HI> (which they affirm) then a different form of covenanting, makes a different kinde of Church-membership. <HI>Immediate covenanting,</HI> makes immediate Members; <HI>Mediate covenanting,</HI> makes mediate Members.</P>
<P>Their third Reason is, <Q><HI>Those relations of Born-servants and Subjects, which the Scripture makes use of to set forth the state of children in the Church by,</HI> Lev. 25. 41,42. Ezek. 37. 25. <HI>do not (as all men know) cease with infancy, but continue in adult age. Whence also it follows, that one special end of membership received in infancy, is to leave persons under engagement, to service and subjection to
<PB N="44" REF="000078_0059_0F9F9007127D2780"/>
Christ in his Church, when grown up, when they are fit for it, and have most need of it.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> 1. Those Relations of born Servants and Subjects in the Text alledged, have different respects. That <HI>Lev.</HI> 25. was typical, figuring the time of Grace, whereby now Christ hath freed us from the servitude of Sin and Satan, <HI>Joh.</HI> 8. 32,36. <HI>Rom.</HI> 6. 14,18. to become the Servants of God in Christ, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6 22. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 23. Parents and children, so far as they have interest in the Redemption wrought by Christ, as they are freed by him from <HI>other Lords,</HI> so they are bound thereby to <HI>serve him all the dayes of their life,</HI> Luke 1. 74,75. Therefore this relation doth not cease with infancy, but continueth in adult age. But this doth nothing concern the thing in question, concerning <HI>Mediate Membership.</HI> The other Text, in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37. 25. is a Prophecy of the calling of the Elect Nation of the Jews, and of the state of the Church under the <HI>New Jerusalem:</HI> the difference between which, and the Christian Gentiles now, I have formerly shewn: so that neither doth that fit the question. But 2. I grant, (though not as fol∣lowing thence) <HI>That one special end of membership received in In∣fancy, is to leave persons under engagement, to service and subjection to Christ in his Church, when grown up, when they are fittest for it, and have most need of it.</HI> The engagement is strong, both on the Pa∣rents, <HI>To train up their children,</HI> from their Infancy, <HI>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</HI> Eph. 6. 4. and upon the Children, <HI>To kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w the God of their Parents, and to serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing minde,</HI> 1 Chron. 28. 9. and upon the Church, <HI>To exercise their Watchfulness, that both Parent: and Children do their duty, helping them also therein with their Instructions, and Prayers, and Power, which is given for Edification, as the case may require.▪</HI> Yet, when all this is done, neither can the Parents nor the Church give Grace unto the Children, that, when they become adult, they may be spiritually fit for personal and immediate Member∣ship; and to bring them into it without such fitness visibly, is to profane the Ordinances, and to pollute the Lords Sanctuary.</P>
<P>"Reas. 4. <HI>There is no ordinary way of cessation of membership, but by Death, Dismission, Excommunication, or Dissolution of the So∣ciety: none of which is the case of the persons in question.</HI></P>

<HI>Reply.</HI> This enumeration is insufficient; there is another or∣dinary way of cessation of Membership, <HI>i. e. Desertion.</HI> Thus <HI>Esau'</HI>s Membership ceased, and so may the Membership of others, though they abide in the place where the Church is; yet, if being adult, they regard not to joyn, with the Church by their personal and immediate Confederation, nor to fit themselves for it, these despise the Church of God. And, if that is sufficient to deprive those of all Church-priviledges, who were before in personal and immediate Church-fellowship, when they forsake it, 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 2. 19. much more those who never had such Member∣ship, nor have approved their Spiritual fitness for it, to the Chur∣ches charitable judgement, nor truly desire and endeavour so to do. What can the mediate Membership, which such had in In∣fancy, advantage them for continuing thereby still in Member∣ship, when being adult, they live in the breach of that Cove∣nant, whereby they were left under engagement in their Infancy unto service and subjection to Christ in the Church?</P>
<P><Q>Reas. 5. <HI>Either they are when adult, Members, or Non-members; if Non-members, then a person admitted a Member and sealed by Baptism, not cast out, nor deserving to be, may (it Church whereof he was, still remaining) become a Non-member, and out of the Church, and of the unclean world, which the Scripture acknowledgeth not.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> A Freemans childe (suppose of <HI>London,</HI> or any other Corporation) was free-born, and might, in his minority, trade un∣der his father; yet, being grown up, he must personally enter into the common Engagement of Freemen, and be accepted of the Company, as his father was, unto all Duties and Liberties of that Society in his own person; else he may not trade for himself. If it be said, Why so? either he is a Freeman, or a Non-freeman. It will be readily answered, <HI>He is a Non-freeman, and that by his own default.</HI> If it be said, He was Free by his Fathers Copy, and is not dis-franchised by any publick Censure, nor hath de∣served so to be; may such an one (the Society whereof he was, still remaining) become a Non-freeman, and out of that So∣ciety, <HI>&amp;c?</HI> The answer will easily and readily be given, <HI>He hath lost his Freedome, by not entring, in his own person, unto the common

Engagement of Freemen, to the Duties whereunto all Freemen are per∣sonally bound.</HI> So, and much more justly it is in this case. An adult person makes himself to become a Non-member, as to pri∣viledges, by not performing the Duties whereunto he was bound by his Patents Covenant for him in his minority, and by his not regularly covenanting, as his Parents did. And this is according to Scripture, which tells us, that Circumcision received in Baptism may become, by his own fault, being adult, no Circumcision, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.25. Those Texts in <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.16. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.14 <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.7. are not applicable to the adult persons in question but onely to Infants, and Children in minority.</P>
<P><Q>Propos. 6. <HI>Such Church-members, who, either by death, or some other extraordinary Providence, have been inevitably hindred from publick acting, as aforesaid, yet, having given the Church cause, in judgement of charity, to look at them as so qualified, and such as had they been called thereunto, would so have acted, their children are to be baptized.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> This Proposition may not be granted. For, 1. It granteth the priviledge of Church-membership to such as are <HI>not actually and regularly Church-members,</HI> which is contrary to Christs Ordinance, whereby Baptism, being a publick Church-Ordinance, is due onely to them who have a publick state and Interest, such are onely the Members of the publick Ecclesiastical Body, the Church. Hence 1. An ordinary Minister cannot orderly per∣form an act proper to his Office, in reference to Church-com∣munion, to any that are not regularly and actually Members of the visible Church, without great usurpation: as, if a man do a work proper to Magistracy, to one that is not under his Magistra∣tical Power, he is an Usurper. So it is in this case of a Minister. To administer Baptism, is an act of his Office-power: If he ad∣minister Baptism to children, whose Parents are not regularly in Church-order; in so doing, why may not the Lord say, He is an Usurper? Suppose an unbaptized person, professing his Faith, and qualified according to the description in the sixth Proposition; yet deferring for some probable causes, to adjoyn himself to the Church, for the present, should desire Baptism of any of these Ministers who framed this Proposition; Should they administer
<PB N="47" REF="000078_0062_0F9F900A5D784020"/>
it to him, and so do a proper work of their Officè upon him? If yea; if they admit him to Baptism, why not to the Lords Sup∣per, and to the choice of Officers, and to the Censures of the Church, either actively or passively? for all these are Actions and Ordinances of one general nature: and it is meerly his want of Church-order that debars him from them. 2. The Church may not receive into any priviledge of Church-communion, such as Baptism is, (whatever cause they seem to have, in the judgement of charity, to think them fit for Church-membership, <HI>and such as had they been called, would have so acted</HI>) until they be actually in publick Church-order; no more then the Children of every good Subject of the King, may be admitted into the special Pre∣rogatives of a Corporation, whereof themselves, or their next Parents are not regularly free. <HI>All things must be done in order,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.40. whereunto, what is more contrary, then that he, who is not regularly and personally of a publick Society, should have Fellowship in a publick Priviledge, proper to that Society? Yet they say <HI>this,</HI> which the Proposition holds forth, <HI>is manifest:</HI></P>
<P N="1"><Q>1. <HI>Because the main foundation of the right of the childe to pri∣viledge, remains;</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Gods Institution: and the force of his Co∣venant, carrying it to the generations of such as are keepers of the Covenant,</HI> i. e. <HI>not visible breakers of it,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> The Parents of the children in question are visibly breakers of the Covenant, which was sealed to them by Baptism, in their Infancy, and obliged them to service and subjection to Christ in his visible Church, having confederated personally and regularly for themselves and theirs, as their Parents did before them. If they do not this, they are out of that order, by their own fault, wherein they might have given their children right to Baptism, according to Christs Institution. That right which Pa∣rents have not for themselves unto <HI>Baptism</HI> if they were unbaptized, they cannot give to their children. They who are not Members in their own personal and immediate right, cannot give a right of membership to their children. And though their Member∣ship in Infancy was distinct from their Parents, yet being onely mediate, by their Parents covenanting for them, it ceaseth, when they become adult, by their own fault, in that they were not or∣derly
<PB N="48" REF="000078_0063_0F9F900AF698C6B0"/>
joyned to the Church, immediately, by their personal cove∣nanting for themselves and theirs, regularly.</P>
<P N="2"><Q>2. <HI>Because Parents not doing what is required in the fifth Pro∣position, is through want of opportunity; which is not to be imputed as their guilt, so as to be a barre of the Childes priviledge.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> 1. It hath been already proved, in our examining the <HI>fifth Proposition,</HI> that more is required to fit one that is adult, for Church-membership, then is there expressed, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>Faith in Christ made visible to the Church,</HI> without which they are not regularly Church-members. Now Baptism administred by ordinary Church-Officers, to such as are out of Church-order, is profaned, as Circumcision was by the <HI>Shechemites,</HI> and would have been by the <HI>Ishmaelites,</HI> and <HI>Edemites,</HI> and the posterity of <HI>Abraham</HI> by <HI>Keturah,</HI> if it had been administred to their children, when their Parents were not joyned to the Church of God, or abode not in it, in the Families of <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob.</HI> For, 1. One end of Baptism now, (as it was of Circumcision then) is to seal Church communion, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 13. it is a publick Testimony of the Admission of the party baptized into the Family of God, <HI>The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,</HI> into whose Name he is baptized, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.20. either immediately, if he be adult, by his personal Covenanting for himself and his seed; or mediately, if in his mi∣nority, by his next immediate Parents Covenanting for him. This the Parent in question hath not done. Hence the want hereof is a bar to his childes Baptism. 2. The regular and lawful use of Baptism now (as of Circumcision of old) presupposeth both Gods Promise, and his Faith, who is to use it, either upon him∣self▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon his Infant. Therefore he that presumeth to use it, being not so qualified visibly, (<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> not having before the Pro∣mise of Christ, and Faith for Justification with <HI>Abraham</HI>) doth he not treacherously usurp the Great-Seal of King of Heaven and Earth?

<P><HI>Reply.</HI> We must distinguish between private and publick Ser∣vice in a publick state and order. 1. In private Service, God
<PB N="49" REF="000078_0064_0F9F900CACFD7C90"/>
accepts the will for the deed, when the acting of it is hindred, ei∣ther by God himself, as <HI>Abrahams</HI> sacrificing his Son, and <HI>Davids</HI> building <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by the parties inability to do so much as he wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld, as in hat case 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8. 12. and the like. 2. But in publick Service in a publick state and order, he doth not accept of that as done which is not done, so far as to bring them into that state and order, whatsoever their desires and endeavours have been; for this were to overthrow and subvert that Order, which God hath by his Instruction established, and to bring in Confusion. Will God accept a man in doing acts of Office power proper to a Minister of a Church, because he desired and endeavoured to be a Minister, when he is not actually and regularly in Office? Or may a Church receive unto Fellowship of the outward Seals of the Covenant such as are not actually and regularly joyned to the Church, because they desired and endeavoured to be of the Church, albeit their joyning with the Church was hindred? To be baptized, <HI>in voto,</HI> will nothing advantage any to Church-fellowship, though a Martyr, <HI>in voto,</HI> is accepted of God as a Martyr, because though God searcheth and knoweth the heart, yet the Church doth not: <HI>De occul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is non judicat Ecclesia;</HI> secret things belong to God, but revealed things to men, and things are not manifested to the Church, otherwise then by congruous act∣ings: nor, in this case, can they or theirs have a right to Church∣priviledges, otherwise then by actual joyning with the Church.</P>

If that which is mentioned to be done in the fifth Proposition expresly, is here done interpretatively, both being put together, will not avail to put the Parent regularly into Church-fellowship, in any sense, and to give his Infant a right to Baptism thereby. For, by Christs Ordinance, onely adult per∣sons, who have true Faith in Him, and Holiness, are adult Mem∣bers of the invisible Church, and the same persons, making holy Profession thereof outwardly in the order of him appointed,

may be Members of the visible Church; and they onely can give their Infant-seed a right unto Baptism. For, seeing <HI>without faith it is impossible to please God,</HI> in matters of his publick Worship and Service, whereof Baptism is one; and seeing God hath appoint∣ed us to Worship him, both in it, and in all other publick Duties and Services, so as we may please him therein: It followeth ne∣cessarily, that he requireth true visible Faith in all whom he privi∣ledgeth to baptize their Infants, which yet is not expresly required in the fifth Proposition, nor interpretatively in this.</P>

<P><HI>Reply.</HI> The regular Communion of approved Churches, I look at as the Ordinance of Christ, according to the 11<SUP>th</SUP> and 12<SUP>th</SUP> Positions premised: but this Proposition is so ambiguously ex∣pressed, that it leaves me in the dark, till some Questions be an∣swered, that the extent and compass of the sense and meaning of it may be better cleared. They distribute it into two parts, which they endeavour to prove severally: but neither of them are sufficiently explained.

These, and the like Questions, being clearly Answered, I shall understand the true and full sense of this Proposition, and what to say to it. So much may suf∣fice, for the present, for Reply to their Answer to the first Que∣stion.</P>
<P><Q>Quest. II. <HI>Whether according to the Word of God, there ought to be a Consociation of Churches? and what should be the manner of it?</HI></Q></P>
<P>"Answ. <HI>The Answer may be given in the Propositions following.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> The Propositions following are eight. As for the first four: The first, Concerning <HI>the full Power and Authority Eccle∣siastical, within it self, of each particular Congregation of visible Saints, in Gospel-Order, furnished, at least, with a Teaching Elder, and walk∣ing together in Truth and Peace.</HI> And the second, concerning <HI>The Sisterly Relation of the Churches of Christ each to other.</HI> And the third, concerning <HI>The Union and Communion of such Churches.</HI> And the fourth, concerning <HI>The Acts of Communion;</HI> I fully close with, as well agreeing with the 11<SUP>th</SUP> and 12<SUP>th</SUP> Positions premised. Excepting onely the sixth <HI>Act of Communion,</HI> and that, but in one part of it. For, <HI>To admonish one another, when there is need and cause for it,</HI> I confess is an Act of this Communion, and which may be proved from <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.11,24. by proportion. But, for that other part of it, <HI>To withdraw from a Church, or peccant party therein, after due means, with patience used, obstinately persisting in Errours or Scandals;</HI> this must be taken with a grain of Salt. They referre us to the <HI>Platform of Discipline,</HI> (Chap. 15. Sect. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Partic.3.) where they fetch a proof for this withdrawing, from
<PB N="53" REF="000078_0068_0F9F90185286DFC8"/>
<HI>Mat.</HI> 18.15,16,17. by proportion. But there seems to be a <HI>threefold disproportion</HI> between that and this. For, 1. There the <HI>Withdrawing</HI> is a consequent and effect of the Churches authori∣tative Censure of an obstinate offender after the first, and second, and third Admonition, the offender being a Member, and so un∣der the Power and Authority of the Church, and to be so censured by the Church, to whom Christ hath given <HI>the Keyes of the King∣dome of Heaven,</HI> and hath ordained, that such an one shall be Ex∣communicated for his obstinacy in offences, which were material∣ly of a lesser kinde, but, by obstinacy of the delinquent, (after secret, private, and publick Admonition) against the Ordinance of Christ for his reclaiming, becomes formally an heinous Scandal. But the <HI>Withdrawing of other Churches from a Church which they account peccant,</HI> is an act of different nature and kinde. For, it is not an act of publick Authority of such Churches over that Church, by virtue of <HI>the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven</HI> given to any Synod, or Council of Neighbour-Churches, as they them∣selves confess in their first Proposition, for Answer to this second Question.</P>
<P N="2">2. The steps, whereby they proceed to this <HI>Withdrawing,</HI> are, <Q>1. <HI>That one Church Admonish another.</HI> 2. <HI>If the Church under offence, doth not hearken to that Admonition; the offended Church is to acquaint other Neighbour-Churches with that offence, and with their neglect of that Admonition: whereunto those other Churches are to joyn, in seconding the Admonition formerly given: and if still the offending Church continue in obstinacy and impenitency, they may forbear communion with them.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> This is not, by proportion, according to <HI>Matth.</HI> 18. For, there Christ doth not allow them, who have proceeded in Admonishing but to the second step, to forbear communion with the delinquent: whereas these Neighbour-Churches are but in the second step. <HI>Yet,</HI> they say, <HI>he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may to hear communion with them.</HI> Then they ascend to the third step; <Q><HI>To proceed to make use of a Synod, or Council of Neighbour-Churches walking orderly (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f a greater cannot conveniently be had) for their conviction. If they hear not the Synod, the Synod, having declared them to be Obstinate, particular Churches, approving and accepting the judgement of the
<PB N="54" REF="000078_0069_0F9F90185D3D7558"/>
Synod, are to declare the sentence of Non-communion respectively concerning them; and thereupon, out of a Religious care to keep their own communion pure, they may justly withdraw themselves from participation with the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at the Lords Table, and from such other acts of holy communion, as the Communion of Churches doth otherwise allow and require.</HI></Q> Thus they speak, in that <HI>Platform.</HI> But, is this, in proportion, according to <HI>Mat.</HI> 18. that <HI>the Neighbour-Churches may first withdraw, and then a Synod or Council of Neigh∣bour-Churches must be made use of for their conviction?</HI> and, <HI>if the Synod declare them to be Obstinate, particular Churches are to declare the sentence of Non-communion, and then to withdraw themselves from all acts of holy communion?</HI> Till they can produce a clear Rule for warrant of such a proceeding, I cannot look at this otherwise, then as a meer humane Invention.</P>
<P N="3">3. Though Churches may <HI>withdraw from a Church that is ob∣stinate and impenitent</HI> in some cases, (without any such <HI>solemn sen∣tence of Non-communion declared by a Synod</HI>) yet, not for such causes as a delinquent Brother may be Excommunicated by a Church, according to <HI>Mat.</HI> 18. For there, though the Offence was in some lesser matter, and private between two at first; yet, by obstinacy against convincing light, held forth in those three steps of proceeding, it becomes a publick and heinous Scandal, and so the Delinquent must be at last Excommunicated by the command of Christ, and the Sentence of the Church, in obedi∣ence to Christ, who hath for such ends <HI>given the Keyes of the King∣dome of Heaven unto them.</HI> But Neighbour-Churches may not withdraw from a true Church for every <HI>Errour</HI> and <HI>Scandal,</HI> though persisted in, and, in their opinion, obstinately. For 1. It may be the <HI>Errour</HI> of Neighbour-Churches, to think that to be light from Scripture, which they hold forth for their conviction, when it is not from Scripture, rightly understood, and rightly applied▪ If the Synod, by whom this Book is published, should conclude any Church to walk in <HI>Errour,</HI> and <HI>Scandal,</HI> and <HI>Obstinately,</HI> which shall not be convinced from what light they have here held forth, nor practise accordingly, till what is Replied <HI>ad opposi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>▪</HI> be soundly Refuted, and their Allegations and Applications of Scri∣pture, more convincingly and irrefragably cleared, and <HI>Withdraw</HI>

communion from them, after the first, second, and third Admoni∣tion; and, If any Neighbour-Churches, for this or the like cause, should <HI>Withdraw</HI> from communion with them, after the Admoni∣tion of one Church, and, after that, of other Neighbour-Chur∣ches; They should greatly sin in so doing, and act contrary to their own Doctrine in their second Proof of their 7<SUP>th</SUP> Proposi∣tion for Answer to this second Question, <HI>pag.</HI> 28. where they say, <HI>To refuse communion with a true Church, in lawful and pious actions, is unlawful, and justly accounted Schismatical. For, if the Church be true, Christ holdeth some communion with it; therefore so must we.</HI> Now the Churches in <HI>New-England</HI> were approved by their Neighbour-Churches to be true Churches, by their giving unto them the right hand of fellowship: and an Errour in lesser matters, though persisted in against their Admonitions, (which may be from want of convincing light) doth not make any of them cease to be a true Church. But to <HI>Withdraw</HI> themselves from all holy communion with such a Church for such a cause▪ is <HI>Total se∣paration from a true Church, which,</HI> themselves say, <HI>is unlawful,</HI> Ibid. 2. The cases, wherein communion may be regularly <HI>Withdrawn</HI> from a Church or Person, are onely such as Subvert the Funda∣mentals of Religion, and are obstinately persisted in, against due means regularly used with patience for their conviction, being contrary to the <HI>Faith once given to the Saints;</HI> from whence they may be justly denominated <HI>Heretical,</HI> Tit.3.10,11. 2 Joh. <HI>ver.</HI> 10,11. Or to the <HI>communion of Saints;</HI> from whence they may be justly styled <HI>Schismatical,</HI> Rom.16▪17,18. Or to both, <HI>being fallen from the Truth once received;</HI> from whence they be justly called. <HI>Apostatical,</HI> 2 Tim 4.10. Or, if there be any other case of like heinousness. But in cases of lesser importance, Churches and Christians are to be exhorted to <HI>walk worthy of their calling, with all lowliness, and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one an∣other in love: Endevouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of peace,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 1.2,2, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> concluding with blessed <HI>Paul,</HI> that (the main things of Religion being provided for, and secured, for lesser matters) <HI>if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you,</HI> Phil.3.15.

the strength, others from the weakness of their Intellectuals: and the best <HI>know but in part.</HI></P>
<P>I have been the larger in clearing this Point for necessary causes. Having thus spoken to the four first Propositions, I proceed to the fifth and sixth Propositions.</P>
<Q><P>Propos. 5. <HI>Consociation of Churches, is their mutual and so∣lemn Agreement to exercise communion in such acts as aforesaid, a∣mong themselves, with special reference to those Churches, which by Providence are planted in a convenient vicinity, though with liberty reserved, without offence, to make use of others, as the nature of the case, or the advantage of the opportunity, may lead thereunto.</HI></P>
<P>Propos. 6. <HI>The Churches of Christ in this Country, having so good opportunity for it, it is meet to be commended to them as their duty thus to consociate: For,</HI> 1. <HI>Communion of Churches being commanded, and Consociation being an Agreement to Practise it, this must needs be a Duty also,</HI> Psal.119.106. Neh.10.28,29.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Before I proceed to argue upon these Propositions, some things should be premised, in way of Enquiry, that the terms may be rightly understood. <HI>Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re.</HI> Whether, by mutual and solemn Agreement, they mean a Vow? It seems by the Texts al∣ledged by them, in the first Proof of the sixth Proposition, that they mean so; and therefore I shall take it for granted that that is their meaning. 2. When they say, <HI>This solemn Agreement or Covenant must be made with special reference to Churches in vicinity: Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re.</HI> 1. How many Churches in Vicinity or Neighbour-Churches, must thus Covenant together? 2. Whether they must have set times of Meeting for this purpose? and who are to meet? Whether Elders alone? or others also sent from the Chur∣ches with them? and how frequent these Meetings must be? and whether the set times must be kept constantly, though they have no present need of counsel from another? 3. Whereas they speak of <HI>Liberty reserved, without offence, to make use of others, as the nature of the case,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>may lead thereunto. Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re.</HI> How they may avoid giving offence to Neighbour-Churches, if they use the help of Churches more remote? Whether they must have their consent thereunto before they use them? 4. Concern∣ing the end and issue of this Consociation of Churches; Whe∣ther
<PB N="57" REF="000078_0072_0F9F901A9E5EA498"/>
they are bound thereby to acquiesce in the judgement and de∣terminations of those Neighbour-Churches, and to practice ac∣cordingly, whether they see convincing light in the Scriptures, or Arguments propounded to them, or not, under a Penalty of be∣ing judged by the rest to be <HI>Obstinate in Errour and Scandal,</HI> and accordingly in time to have all <HI>holy communion with them withdrawn from them?</HI> It seemeth, by what was before said in the sixth <HI>Act of Communion</HI> for Answer to the first Question, <HI>pag.</HI> 31. that this will be the end and issue of this Consociation unto any Church that shall dissent from the rest. This Consociation they endea∣vour to prove to be a duty incumbent upon the Churches in <HI>New-England.</HI> I shall briefly weigh their Reasons.</P>
<P><Q><HI>For</HI> 1. <HI>Communion of Churches being commanded, and Conso∣ciation being but an Agreement to practise it, this must needs be a duty also,</HI> Psal.119.106. Nehem. 10.28,29.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> It doth not necessarily follow, till they have proved that Consociation of Churches by a mutual and solemn Covenant is commanded, as Communion of Churches is. Nor do the Texts alledged prove it in <HI>Psal.</HI> 119. 106. <HI>David</HI> swore <HI>to keep Gods righteous judgements,</HI> and would <HI>perform it;</HI> because, though he was not bound to swear, yet he had voluntarily sworn it, and so was under a double bond to perform it: for, both his <HI>keeping Gods righteous judgements,</HI> and his <HI>performing that Vow,</HI> were command∣ed of God, <HI>Deut.</HI> 10.13. with <HI>Psal.</HI> 76.11. 2. And his Vow was private, betwixt God and himself. Hence it will not fol∣low, that Churches are bound to consociate with a Vow or Co∣venant, after the manner here described, which is not proved to be a duty, and may be unsafe for particular Churches. That Cove∣vant, in <HI>Neh.</HI> 10.28,29. was their Church-covenant renewed and explained, and so was a mutual solemn Engagement, by <HI>entring in∣to a Curse, and into an Oath</HI> (to which form we are not bound) and Church-covenanting is Gods Ordinance, <HI>Isa.</HI> 19.21. <HI>&amp;</HI> 56.4, to 8. <HI>&amp;</HI> 62.5. all which are Prophesies of the Churches under the Go∣spel. But between the covenanting of a Church within it self, and such a covenanting as this for the consociating of Churches, there are considerable differences. 1. <HI>Because this wants Warrant from the Scripture, which that hath; there being neither any Precept in Scri∣pture
<PB N="58" REF="000078_0073_0F9F901BE966C528"/>
commanding it, nor any Pattern among the Primitive Churches, planted or approved by the Apostles, commanding it unto us. 2. Nor is there like Reason for such Consociation of Churches by a mutual and solemn Agreement or Covenant between Churches in a vicinity, as is for a Church-covenant within it self.</HI> For, the Church-covenant is ne∣cessary, because, without it, the ends of Church-fellowship can∣not be attained. For, 1. Each particular Church is a Spiritual Corporation; which therefore must receive its being from a Spi∣ritual Combination, or Foederal Engagement. 2. By virtue here∣of, they that had no natural impression to subject them to others, or to give them power over them, have mutual power each over o∣ther, to command, &amp; constrain, as the case requires; of which power they could not have been made partakers without mutual Agree∣ment and Engagement. 3. Hereby they come to enjoy such Spiritual and Ecclesiastick Priviledges unto which none can be ad∣mitted without the approbation and allowance of the whole; which necessarily requires this Engagement to the whole, which is by Covenant. Thus Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> argues, to prove <HI>the necessity of a Church-covenant,</HI> Survey, <HI>part.</HI> 1. <HI>chap.</HI> 4. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 50, to 55. But the ends of <HI>Church-communion,</HI> (which is mutual helpfulness by counsel) may be attained (without such a Consociation by mutual Engagement) <HI>by the Communion of Churches,</HI> which of it self, without any other Engagement, gives Churches a right and interest in another way mutually for their help by counsel, when their needs require it. The Churches in <HI>New-England</HI> have, by the blessing of Christ, found the benefit of the Communion of Chur∣ches for setling Truth and Peace among them, without such a <HI>Con∣sociation,</HI> and may so still. 3. Such an <HI>Agreement between Churches</HI> will become a Snare unto them, by straitning them in the use and exercise of their Church-power within themselves, <HI>in re propr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪</HI> 1. If, by virtue hereof, they may not administer Church-censures within themselves, without concurrence of Neighbour-Churches, or Elders approbation sought and attained thereunto before: Or, 2. If thereby they stand bound under the fore-noted Penalty, to rest in, and practise according to the judgement and advice of such Churches, having sufficient light and consent within them∣selves without them. 3. Mr. <HI>Rutherfurd</HI> affirms, <HI>That a conve∣nient
<PB N="59" REF="000078_0074_0F9F901C1967CCA8"/>
number of Churches, having ordinarily conversing one with an∣other, shall voluntarily combine themselves in one Society; this last gives in the formality of Classical Membership,</HI> Lib 2. p. 320. He addes: <HI>When God hath made him a combined Member, now, by insti∣tution, of one Presbyterian Church, not of another, though by ordinary converse with other Churches, in case of scandal, his example may prove prejudicial and infestuous to others, yet this Presbytery must proceed in Excommunication against him, because he is combined with them.</HI> Thus, you see, by this voluntary combination of Churches, a Church become a Classical or Presbyterian Church, and the Members, by consenting thereunto, become Members of a Classical Church, and under the power of it, so as to be Excom∣municated by it. And is not this Consociation to be looked at as a Snare to the Churches? which 1. Transforms them from Congregational Churches into a Classical Church? And 2. Sub∣jects them under the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction of that Classical Church? And 3. Without any warrant of Christs Institution? Let us see if there be more in their second Proof.</P>
<P N="2"><Q>2. Paul <HI>an Apostle sought with much labour the conference, concurrence, and right hand of fellowship of other Apostles: and ordinary Elders and Churches have not less need each of other, to pre∣vent their</HI> running in vain, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.2,6,9.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> 1. This necessity was proper to <HI>Paul'</HI>s case, who did not converse with Christ on earth, as the other Apostles did, but was as one <HI>born out of due time,</HI> 1 Cor. 15. 8. and so was more liable to be objected and excepted against, then the other Apostles; and therefore had more need to be countenanced among men, by them, then they by him: Whence he wisely sought approbation from them. But this is not the case of the Churches in <HI>New-England,</HI> each of them having been approved by <HI>the right hand of fellowship</HI> given to them by other Churches at their first ga∣thering, and at the Ordination of their Teaching and Ruling∣Elders 2. <HI>Paul</HI> did thus, not by reason of such a consociation of Churches, as is here described, but▪ for other Reasons. 3.

<P><HI>Reply.</HI> It is true, and it is their duty to make use of them, in obedience, and with thankfulness to God as need requires, when they want light or consent within themselves by virtue of the <HI>com∣munion of Churches,</HI> without such a Consociation as they describe.</P>

Nor by virtue of such a Con∣sociation of the Church at <HI>Antioch</HI> with that at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> but of the communion of Churches.</P>
<P N="5"><Q>5. <HI>Concurrence and communion of Churches, in Gospel-times, is not obscurely held forth in</HI> Isa.19 23,24,25. Zeph.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.9. 1 Cor.11.16. &amp; 14.32,36.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Some of those Texts note onely a communion of Saints in one and the same Church. 2. None of them hold forth a Consociation of Churches as they describe.</P>
<P N="6"><Q>6. <HI>There hath constantly been in these Churches a profession of Communion, in giving the right hand of fellowship at the gathering of Churches, and Ordination of Elders; which importeth a Con∣sociation, and obligeth to the practice thereof.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Together with the <HI>profession of communion,</HI> hath been the practice of it in these Churches. But that this communion importeth such a Consociation, as they describe, and obligation to the practice thereof, was not expressed, nor understood. Worthy Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> (whose Name ought to be honourable a∣mong the Saints, both in <HI>Old England</HI> and <HI>New</HI>) in that Book which he entituled, <HI>The Way of the Churches in New-England,</HI> the sixth chapter, speaketh of the Communion of Churches, and sheweth seven wayes, whereby it ought to be, and is, in these Churches, exercised. They do (as I apprehend) reach all the Duties to be performed, by virtue of Church-communion, mu∣tually, by each other: But of this Consociation (as it is here
<PB N="61" REF="000078_0076_0F9F901D952E60E8"/>
described) he speaketh not a word; nor, I believe, did apprehend any Necessity of it, or Rule in Scripture for it. Therefore, when they say, <HI>Without this, we shall w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt an expedient and suf∣ficient cure for emergent Church-difficulties and differences;</HI> the con∣stant experience of these Churches, from their beginning, to this day, evinceth the contrary. And though <HI>our Way is charged with the want hereof;</HI> yet <HI>it is unjustly,</HI> and by such as would bring us into their Way of Classical Churches, which is not proved to be the Ordinance of Christ, as this of the <HI>Communion of Churches</HI> is, and hath been found effectual, by the blessing of Christ, and so will be still. And though <HI>this part of the Doctrine of the Church,</HI> as they call it, concerning such a consociation, it being not proved to be the Doctrine of Christ, was never practised in these Chur∣ches: For without it, the Churches either have been, or might have been, and may be hereafter, kept in purity and peace with Brotherly love among themselves mutually, by the regular im∣proving the communion of Churches, which is manifested to be the Ordinance of Christ, who hath given us perfect Rules in the New Testament, for the ordering of the communion of Christian Churches, which are sufficient for attainment of the ends, for which Christ hath appointed it, according to the second, third, fourth, eleventh, and twelfth Positions premised. With which, if this way of Consociation of Churches shall be clearly proved to agree (which I do not finde to be yet done) I shall readily and heartily close with it, and submit unto it. For it is onely the Truth that I search for, and desire to bear witness unto, that, when my time shall come to <HI>lay down this earthly tabernacle</HI> (which I expect daily) <HI>I may give up my account with joy.</HI> 2.

<P><HI>Reply.</HI> If the Churches do express their Agreement herein openly, they do voluntarily engage themselves, and covenant to practise according to the things declared, not onely in the point of Church-communion, but also of such consociation as is here ex∣pressed, which they have need to see to be warranted by the Word, if they will act accordingly in faith, knowing that <HI>what∣soever is not of faith, is sin,</HI> Rom.14.23. What is said in the <HI>Plat∣form, chap.</HI> 15▪ hath been, in part, examined before in <HI>chap.</HI> 16.5.</P>
<P><Q>They say, <HI>The Synods Directions and Determinations, so farre as consonant to the Word of God, are to be received with reverence and submission, not onely for their agreement therewith,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>but also secondarily, for the power whereby they are made,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> I grant, that the <HI>Synods Directions and Determinations, so farre as consonant to the Word of God, are to be received with reverence and submission.</HI> But what if the Members of Churches, to which they are sent, do not finde them consonant to the Word rightly understood and applied? Are they nevertheless still bound to pra∣ctise according to <HI>the Synods Directions and Determinations,</HI> be∣cause the Synod coucludeth that they are <HI>consonant to the Word?</HI> I suppose, no Orthodox Synod, in these times, will arrogate to it self such infallible Assistance, as <HI>the Apostles, being assembled with the Church at Jerusalem,</HI> had, <HI>Acts</HI> 15. (though they argued and concluded onely from Scripture, yet that Council could not erre in their understanding and applying Scripture, having such guides as the Apostles were) but will confess that they may erre in their understanding and applying the Scriptures, whereupon they seem to ground their <HI>Directions and Determinations.</HI> And if so, it is the duty of every Church, and the Members thereof, to examine by the Scriptures whatsoever <HI>Direction or Determination</HI> is pro∣pounded by the Synod. If they finde that they are <HI>consonant to the Word of God,</HI> they are bound by Gods Authority to receive them <HI>with reverence and submission.</HI> It otherwise, <HI>we ought to obey God, rather then man,</HI> Acts 5. 29. 2. This power of the Synod (though they say it is <HI>but secondary,</HI> and that it is for their agree∣ment with the Word, which is the principal ground thereof, and
<PB N="63" REF="000078_0078_0F9F901F1BBAB970"/>
without which their Directions and Determinations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inde not at all, yet) they make so binding, that, if any Churches shall refuse to practise according to the Directions and Determinations of the Synod, (though they have strong grounds of dis-satisfaction a∣bout the Synods interpretation and application of the Scriptures alledged by them) they will <HI>withdraw themselves from communion with them.</HI> Whether such an authoritative urging their counsels upon Churches be warranted by Scripture, let the Reader enquire and consider: and, Whether it will agree with what themselves before declared, concerning <HI>the unlawfulness of a total Separation from a true Church:</HI> and, Whether there be need of it <HI>to cure emer∣gent Church-difficulties and differences;</HI> seeing all that are godly will readily close with such Directions and Determinations of Sy∣nods, as are clearly consonant to the Word of God: and, if any obstinately will persist in their own wayes, contrary to the Word held forth to them by the Synod, the Civil Power is Gods Ordi∣nance for <HI>punishment of</HI> such <HI>evil doers,</HI> that the Churches may be kept pure and peaceable, in the exercise of Church-communion among themselves in a Brotherly way. Which yet is no impedi∣ment to the Churches (and that by the declaratory Sentence of a Synod, that is, after due conviction of a Church that is <HI>Hereti∣cal, Schismatical, Apostatical,</HI> or the like, with <HI>due patience ex∣ercised</HI>) to <HI>withdraw the right hand of fellowship</HI> from such as make themselves worthy, by their obstinacy against the light clearly held forth from Scripture, to be <HI>rejected,</HI> as not true Churches of Christ. Yet this they may not regularly do, meerly for their Dis∣senting from the Determinations of the Synod, upon conscien∣tious grounds, and in lesser matters. What is before expressed in the fifth Proposition, hath been already examined.</P>
<P><Q>Propos. 8. concerneth <HI>The manner of exercising and practising that Communion, which this cousin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and agreement specially tendeth unto, which,</HI> they say, <HI>may be, by making use occasionally of Elders, or able Brethren of other Churches; or by the more solemn Meet∣ings of both Elders and Messengers, in lesser or greater Councils, as the matter shall require.</HI></Q> Such Meetings, for the end speci∣fied, being rightly ordered, and carried on in a Brotherly way, by men sincerely affected to establish Truth with Peace in the

<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS UPON THE SEVEN PROPOSITIONS Concluded by the SYNOD sitting at BOSTON, June 10<SUP>th</SUP>. 1662.</HEAD>
<HEAD>By the Reverend, Mr. NICHOLAS STREET, Teacher of the Church of Christ at New-haven.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I.THis Phrase, <HI>Members of the visible Church,</HI> in the first Proposition, I take to be explained in the se∣cond Proposition.</P>
<P N="2">II. By this Phrase in the second Proposition, <HI>Their Infant-seed,</HI> I suppose is meant onely their legitimate infant-seed, and is not to be extended to illegitimate children; against which a strong Argument may be gathered from <HI>Deut.</HI> 23.2.</P>
<P N="3">III. The second Proposition doth seem to distinguish of Mem∣bers in particular Churches: Some are said to be <HI>Confederate visible Believers;</HI> whereby, I suppose, is meant, such as have immediately and personally taken hold of the Covenant themselves, both for themselves, and for their seed: for it is manifest, that it is spoken of such as are made contradistinct to an infant-seed, that cannot thus do. Some are said to be <HI>Their infant-seed,</HI> (i.) <HI>children in minority,</HI> &amp;c. And how come these to be Members? The last words in the Pro∣position do shew; which are, <HI>Whose next Parents, one or both, are in Covenant:</HI> which doth imply at least, that they become Mem∣bers in and by their next Parents covenanting for them. Hence the ground of the distinction of Membership into <HI>Immediate</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="000078_0081_0F9F902151BF26E0"/>
and <HI>Mediate</HI> is very clear. The Argument may be thus framed: Such as is the <HI>ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> for malis</HI> of the Membership, such is the Mem∣bership, so may it be distinguished and denominated. But Con∣federation, which is the <HI>ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> for malis</HI> of the Membership, is im∣mediate in the Parent in the Childe mediate. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></P>
<P>A difference in Membership is granted, both in this second Proposition▪ and some others after; and if this distinction to ex∣press the difference be not proper, let some better be laid down, that doth more aptly and fully suit the nature of the thing, and we shall receive it. In the mean time we shall hold to this, as conceiving, that the admitting of it would be a good means to preserve the Churches in purity, to prevent many unprofitable and uncomfortable disputes, and other great inconveniences, which, the rejecting of it will unavoidably make way unto.</P>
<P N="4">IV. This clause in the third Proposition, <HI>When grown up, are personally under the Which, Discipline and Government of the Church;</HI> had need be warily understood, and doth call for some clear expli∣cation For, if it be meant that they are in the same way, and as fully under the <HI>Discipline and Government of the Church,</HI> as those who' in their own persons have taken hold of the Covenant, it cannot be assented unto: For then, in case of such delinquency, as doth call for Excommunication in another Member, they are formally to be Excommunicated. But this may not be admit∣ted. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. Formal Excommunication doth not suit their state; they are within the Church onely <HI>mediately,</HI> by their Parents confedera∣tion: Therefore are not to be cast out of the Church <HI>immediately and personally</HI> by formal Excommunication. 2. Besides, they are, in respect of strength, <HI>weak;</HI> and in respect of state, <HI>dead:</HI> especially being considered as in this third Proposition, <HI>without qualifications,</HI> even such as are mentioned in the fifth Proposition, which yet are <HI>separable from true and saving grace:</HI> They are too weak to bear the weight and strength of that Censure, which is <HI>mighty through God,</HI> 2 Cor. 10. 4. it is to <HI>put new wine into old bottles,</HI> which Christ doth dislike in Spiritual matters, <HI>Mat.</HI>9.</P>
<P N="2">2. It seemeth to be very injurious to them, to lay them open to the highest Censure, and not to allow them proportionable pri∣viledges.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="67" REF="000078_0082_0F9F902353D89100"/>
3. The main end of Excommunication, when it passeth upon such, is not like to be attained, which is, <HI>the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved,</HI> 1 Cor.5.5. The Ordinance doth suppose the Subject of it to be <HI>flesh and spirit;</HI> they who are con∣sidered as without qualifications to make them capable of Church-priviledges, as in this third Proposition, cannot be locked at as other then <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> flesh.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. In the fourth Proposition it is said, <HI>These adult persons are not therefore to be admitted to full Communion, because they are and continue Members, without such further qualifications as the Word of God requireth thereunto.</HI> But whether the children of such are to be baptized; or not, is not said; and it is necessary that it should have been expressed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the sense and meaning of the Synod might be rightly understood.</P>
<P N="6">VI. To the fifth Proposition many things may be said.</P>
<P N="1">1. This Proposition may rationally be looked at, as holding forth the qualifications wanting to full Communion, mentioned in the fourth Proposition: And if so, then it will follow, that such as have these qualifications, have right to full Communion: if I miss it, I would be thankful to him that should shew me my mis∣take; if I am right, and do rightly express the sense of that Pro∣position, it were expedient that the Synod should plainly and fully express their meaning therein, to the understanding of all.</P>
<P N="2">2. The qualifications are, <HI>Understanding the Doctrine of Faith, and professing their Assent thereunto; Not scandalous in life.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. There is more required in a Church-member, even in point of knowledge, then to <HI>understand the Doctrine of Faith, and assent thereunto.</HI> He ought, in a competent measure, to <HI>understand Church-Order and Discipline appointed by Christ,</HI> otherwise he can∣not Covenant in judgement, or own the Covenant; neither doth he <HI>know how to behave himself in the House of God,</HI> as a Member thereof.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Devil doth <HI>understand the Doctrine of Faith,</HI> and doth <HI>assent thereunto,</HI> Jam.2.19.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Not scandalous in life,</HI> is wholly Negative, and may be said of irrational Animals. <HI>He</HI> onely <HI>that doth righteousness,</HI> posi∣tively, can be denominated <HI>righteous,</HI> 1 Joh.3.7.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="68" REF="000078_0083_0F9F90250CC1B388"/>
4. Besides all these, there must be <HI>the work and grace of Faith</HI> held forth, <HI>Acts</HI> 8. 37, 38. <HI>&amp;</HI> 16. 31—34. before any medling with the Covenant, <HI>Isa.</HI> 19.21.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is said, <HI>And solemnly owning the Covenant,</HI> &amp;c. The Scripture speaketh of <HI>Entring into a Covenant,</HI> 2 Chron. 15. 12. of <HI>Making a Covenant with the Lord,</HI> 2 Chron.29.10. and, <HI>Be∣fore the Lord,</HI> 2 Chron. 34.31. of <HI>Taking hold of the Covenant, Isa.</HI> 56 4. Now if their <HI>Owning the Covenant</HI> be the same; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, not onely their children are to be baptized, but themselves ad∣mitted to full Communion; if short, then it is a meer humane invention, not warranted by the Word.</P>
<P N="4">4. Upon supposition, that the qualifications expressed be found in them, it is said, <HI>Their children are to be baptized.</HI> But</P>
<P N="1">1. The first and second Propositions are against it. The first Proposition doth limit Baptism to <HI>the Members of the visible Church:</HI> The second Proposition doth explain who are meant by <HI>Members of the visible Church according to Scripture;</HI> 1. <HI>Confede∣rate visible Believers in particular Churches,</HI> (i.) such as have per∣sonally and immediately Confederated for themselves, as the last clause sheweth. And 2. <HI>Their Infant-seed,</HI> (i.) <HI>children in mino∣rity, whose next Parents, one or both, are in Covenant.</HI> Now these mentioned in the fifth Proposition, to whom Baptism is allowed, are neither the one nor the other. <HI> Ergo.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>grace of Faith is wanting,</HI> if there be no more then the qualifications before mentioned, and that is necessary to give their children right to Baptism, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.38,39.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The children of such are not to be baptized, who themselves do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> under great offence visibly, and do not reform,</HI> Exod.20.5.</P>
<P><HI>But so do these Parents, in not taking hold of the Covenant per∣sonally and immediately, for themselves.</HI> Ergo.</P>
<P>It may easily and abundantly be proved, that such as have been baptized in the Church, and have lived under precious means and great light, untill they are Married, and have children, and all this while have neglected the main thing that doth concern them, which is <HI>to Believe,</HI> and upon their Believing, <HI>personally,</HI> and for them∣selves, to <HI>take hold of the Covenant,</HI> are under very great sin and offence. But I will onely use one Argument, which is this:</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="000078_0084_0F9F902519D39668"/>
<HI>Neglect of taking hold of the Covenant, or of entring into Covenant now under Christ and the Gospel, is as gross a neglect, as great a sin, as much displeasing to God, as was the neglect of Circumcision, the sign of the Covenant before Christ.</HI> Grounds of it are:</P>
<P N="1">1. The thing it self is as weighty, that I say not, more.</P>
<P N="2">2. As fully under command as that, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.23. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.9,10.</P>
<P N="3">3. The neglect of it doth as necessarily and peremptorily in∣fer Gods highest displeasure, and everlasting destruction, if con∣tinued in, as that, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.36. <HI>Mark</HI> 16.16. <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.3.</P>
<P><HI>But that neglect was gross, the sin great, and very displeasing to God, Gen.</HI> 17.14. <HI>Exod.</HI> 4.24—26. Ergo.</P>
<P N="4">4. If the children of such are to be baptized; if their chil∣dren again thus baptized, live to have children, themselves not <HI>personally taking hold of the Covenant,</HI> or not <HI>entring into Covenant,</HI> what shall become of them? shall they be baptized, or not?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>If not;</HI> it is needful that it should be declared, that all may know where to stop, and to understand, that this Priviledge is not to exceed the <HI>Third Generation.</HI> Again, <HI>if not,</HI> it is strange that a childe should be begotten or born of a Member, and yet it self be no Member; or, if a Member, have no right to Baptism.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>If so;</HI> it may be demanded, <HI>By what right?</HI> or, <HI>Where is the ground of their right to Baptism? Not in the Grandfather▪ or Great∣Grandfather;</HI> that is generally disliked: and the second Proposi∣tion doth limit it otherwise; but in <HI>the immediate Parent,</HI> I sup∣pose. But, <HI>how is the right of these childrens Baptism founded upon him?</HI> Not upon <HI>his personal Confederating;</HI> for it is supposed there is none: Nor upon <HI>his owning the Covenant of his father;</HI> for his father made no Covenant: he did onely <HI>own the Covenant of his Parents,</HI> and that gave the right of Baptism to his children, as is held forth in the fifth Proposition. It remaineth therefore, that this Parent of the <HI>third Generation</HI> doth own what his Parent of the <HI>second Generation</HI> (he can go no higher) hath done, and <HI>what is that?</HI> He <HI>entred not into Covenant,</HI> but onely <HI>owned the Co∣venant that his father entred into.</HI> And thus these last children, who are of the <HI>fourth Generation,</HI> do come to have right to Ba∣ptism, not by <HI>their Parents Confederation,</HI> as the <HI>second sort</HI> men∣tioned in the second Proposition; nor by <HI>their Parents owning
<PB N="70" REF="000078_0085_0F9F9025D0B8F9B0"/>
their fathers Covenant,</HI> as the <HI>third sort</HI> spoken of in the fifth Pro∣position; but <HI>by these Parents</HI> (of the <HI>third Generation</HI>) <HI>owning their Parents</HI> of the <HI>second Generation) owing the Covenant of their fa∣thers,</HI> of the <HI>first.</HI> This seemeth to be an uncouth way, and very unpleasant Divinity.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The sixth Proposition I look at as an <HI>Exception</HI> to the fifth; otherwise it is cross unto it, and against it. To this I say,</P>
<P N="1">1. If the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e be any weight in the Arguments used under the <HI>sixth Consideration,</HI> against the baptizing of children, to whom the fifth Proposition doth allow Baptism; the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they are likewise of force against the baptizing of children mentioned in this sixth Proposition.</P>
<P N="2">2. I cannot but take notice of the several sorts of Member∣ship, all giving right to Baptism: <HI>Two</HI> in the second Proposition, a <HI>Third</HI> in the fifth; a <HI>Fourth</HI> in the sixth: and if Membership, <HI>without personal Confederation by the seed of Confederate visible Be∣lievers,</HI> doth not end in the <HI>third Generation,</HI> then there is a <HI>Fifth,</HI> and a <HI>Sixth sort of Membership;</HI> and all these are differing one from the other. The two first are of God, and according to his Word, the rest are not.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The last Proposition seemeth to open a very wide gate in the Church, wider th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n God doth allow, <HI>Isa.</HI> 26. 2. for though it requireth qualifications in such Members who claim right to Ba∣ptism for their children in other Churches, by virtue of▪ <HI>Church-communion,</HI> yet it is altogether silent of the qualifications of such Churches themselves, onely they must be <HI>Orthodox;</HI> that respects the <HI>Doctrine of Faith</HI> alone. There is much more to be attended: A Church may be <HI>Orthodox in matters of Faith,</HI> yet <HI>Scandalous in Practice:</HI> A whole Church may be <HI>under Scandal,</HI> as well as a par∣ticular person; and in that case another Church may <HI>withdraw from it,</HI> and have no communion either with it, or its Members. And this was, not long since, the Judgement and Practice of some of the Chief Churches and Elders in the <HI>Bay.</HI></P>
<P>Again, a Church may believe the main <HI>Articles of Faith,</HI> yet be so <HI>defective in Discipline,</HI> yea, so <HI>opposite to Christs Government,</HI> as to lay aside his <HI>Laws and Institutions,</HI> and set up the <HI>Inventions and Traditions of men:</HI> And likewise may▪ have such a <HI>corrupt Consti∣tution,</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="000078_0086_0F9F902D0DCD7280"/>
both in regard of <HI>Matter, Open scandalous livers;</HI> and like∣wise of <HI>Form, No visible express Covenant according to the Rules of the Gospel,</HI> that there can be no such communion held and main∣tained with such a Church, or her Members holding communion with it, as is expressed in this seventh Proposition, without mani∣fest disobedience to the Word of God, in these, and many other places, <HI>Rev.</HI> 18.4. 2 <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> 6.17. <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.11.</P>
<P>If the Members of Orthodox Churches may▪ upon the terms expressed in the seventh Proposition, claim Baptism for their chil∣dren in our Churches, by virtue of <HI>Church-communion,</HI> then them∣selves have right to communicate with us in the Lords Supper; and then what should hinder but that we may, by virtue of <HI>Church-communion,</HI> occasionally coming to any of these Ortho∣dox Churches, have our children baptized in such a Church, and our selves partake in the Supper of the Lord? Or, if we should have occasion to remove our Habitation to such a place where such an Orthodox Church is, why may we not joyn unto it, and have fellowship with it? And if we may so do, <HI>New-England</HI> Chri∣stians are of all Christians in the world <HI>most miserable</HI> and foolish. We have <HI>suffered many things in vain,</HI> in leaving such a Countrey for this; our Estates Friends, Comforts there, to enjoy God, and Christ, and our Consciences in the <HI>Congregational-Way,</HI> in a low afflicted condition in the Wilderness, for so many years together; and now we must lose those things which we have wrought, and may return to our former sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e when we please: which the Lord preserve us from.</P>
