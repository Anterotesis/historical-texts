<HEAD>His Highness the Prince of Orange, His LETTER to the LORDS Spiritual and Temporal Assembled at WESTMINSTER, In this present Convention.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I <HI>Have Endeavoured to the utmost of my Power, to perform what was Desired of me in Order to the Publick Peace and Safety; and I do not know that any thing hath been Omitted which might tend to the Preservation of them, since the Admi∣nistration of Affairs was put into my hands. It now lies upon you to lay the Foun∣dation of a firm Security for your Religion, your Laws, and your Liberties. I do not doubt, but that by such a full and free Representative of the Nation as is now made, the Ends of my Declaration will be attained. And since it hath pleased God hitherto to bless my good Intentions with so great Success, I trust in him, that he will compleat his own Work, by sending a Spirit of Peace and Union to influence your Councils, that no interruption may be given to an happy and lasting Settlement. The Dangerous Condi∣tion of the Protestant Interest in Ireland, requiring a large and speedy Succour, and the present State of Things abroad, oblige me to tell you, that next to the Danger of unreasonable Divisions among your selves, nothing can be so fatal, as too great Delay in your Consultations. The States by whom I have been Enabled to Rescue this Nation may suddenly feel the ill effects of it. by being too long Deprived of the service of the Troops, which are now here, and of your early Assistance against a powerful Enemy, who hath Declared War against them. And as</HI> England, <HI>is by Treaty already Enga∣ged to help them upon any such Exigences, so I am confident that their cheerful Concur∣rence to preserve this Nation, with so much hazard to themselves will meet with all the Returns of Friendship and Assistance which may be expected from you as</HI> Pro∣testants <HI>and</HI> English-men <HI>whenever their Occasions shall require it.</HI></P>
