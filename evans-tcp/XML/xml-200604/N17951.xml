<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN the compilation of this volume, it has been the editor's object, while he provided an elegant fund of rational and innocent entertainment, to fix upon such pieces of poetry as have a tendency to enlarge the understanding, and resine the heart. He only hopes for the public approbation in proportion as he has succeeded in this. He has carefully guarded against the admission of such productions as might</P>
<L>"Make Virtue blush—give Innocence a fear—</L>
<L>"Or from the soft-ey'd virgin draw a tear."</L>
<P>He hopes that to Americans this worl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will be mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e acceptable than those on the same plan from G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat Britain as, besides the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>med pieces of Bri∣tish poetry, they will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pious extracts from the most celeb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated American ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds.</P>

<HEAD>FIRST PART. FROM BRITISH POETS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="poem">
<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON CRITICISM. POPE.</HEAD>
<L>'TIS hard to say, if greater want of skill</L>
<L>Appear in writing, or in judging ill:</L>
<L>But, of the two, less dang'rous is th'offence,</L>
<L>To tire our patience, than mislead our sense.</L>
<L>Some few in that, but numbers err in this;</L>
<L>Ten censure wrong, for one who writes amiss.</L>
<L>A fool might once himself alone expose;</L>
<L>Now one in verse makes many more in prose.</L>
<L>'Tis with our judgments, as our watches, none</L>
<L>Go just alike, yet each believes his own.</L>
<L>In poets, as true genius is but rare,</L>
<L>True taste as seldom is the critic's share;</L>
<L>Both must alike from heav'n derive their light,</L>
<L>These born to judge, as well as those to write.</L>
<L>Let such teach others, who themselves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>el,</L>
<L>And censure freely, who have written <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</L>
<L>Authors are partial to their wit, 'tis true;</L>
<L>But are not critics to their judgment too?</L>
<L>Yet, if we look more closely, we shall find</L>
<L>Most have the seeds of judgment in their mind:</L>
<L>Nature affords at least a glimm'ring light;</L>
<L>The lines, tho' touch'd but faintly, are drawn right.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="023246_0009_0FBEDD8A955DE8E0"/>But as the slightest sketch, if justly trac'd,</L>
<L>Is by ill colouring but the more disgrac'd,</L>
<L>So by false learning is good sense defac'd.</L>
<L>Some are bewilder'd in the maze of schools,</L>
<L>And some made coxcombs nature meant but fools.</L>
<L>In search of wit, these I se their common sense,</L>
<L>And then turn critics in their own defence:</L>
<L>Each burns alike, who can or cannot write,</L>
<L>Or with a rival's, or an eunuch's spite.</L>
<L>All fools have still an itching to deride,</L>
<L>And fain would be upon the laughing side.</L>
<L>If Maevius scribble in Apollo's spite,</L>
<L>There are, who judge still worse than he can write.</L>
<L>Some have at first for wits, then poets past,</L>
<L>Turn'd critics next, and prov'd plain fools at last:</L>
<L>Some neither can for wits nor critics pass;</L>
<L>As heavy mules are neither horse nor ass.</L>

<L>The watch-dog's voice that bay'd the whisp'ring wind,</L>

<L>The village pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cher's modes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mansion rose.</L>

<L>Remo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e from towns he ran his godly race,</L>
<L>Nor e'er had chang'd, nor wish'd to change his place;</L>
<L>Unskilful he to fawn, or seek for pow'r,</L>
<L>By doctrines fashion'd to the varying hour;</L>
<L>Far other aims his heart had learn'd to prize,</L>
<L>More bent to raise the wretched, than to rise.</L>
<L>His house was known to all the vagrant train,</L>
<L>He chid their wand'rings, but reliev'd their pain.</L>
<L>The long-remember'd beggar was his guest,</L>
<L>Whose beard descending, swept his aged breast;</L>
<L>The ruin'd spendthrift, now no longer proud,</L>

<L><PB N="23" REF="023246_0030_0FBEDDBFD7068FD0"/>The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,</L>
<L>Sat by his fire, and talk'd the night away;</L>
<L>Wept o'er his wounds, or tales of sorrow done,</L>
<L>Shoulder'd his crutch, and show'd how fields were won.</L>
<L>Pleas'd with his guests, the good man learn'd to glow,</L>
<L>And quite forget their vices in their woe;</L>
<L>Careless their merits or their faults to scan,</L>
<L>His pity gave ere charity began.</L>

<L>But in his duty prompt at every call,</L>
<L>He watch'd and wept, he pray'd, and felt for all.</L>
<L>And, as a bird each fond endearment tries,</L>
<L>To tempt her new-fledg'd offspring to the skies;</L>
<L>He try'd each art, reprov'd each dull delay,</L>
<L>Allur'd to brighter worlds, and led the way.</L>
<L>Beside the bed, where parting life was laid,</L>
<L>And sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns dismay'd,</L>
<L>The rev'rend champion stood. At his controul,</L>

<L>And pluck'd his gown, to share the good man's smile.</L>
<L>His ready smile a parent's warmth exprest,</L>

<L>To them his heart, his love, his griefs were giv'n,</L>

<L>As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form,</L>
<L>Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,</L>
<L>Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,</L>
<L>Eternal sunshine settles on its head.</L>
<L>Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way,</L>
<L>With blossom furze, unprofitably gay,</L>
<L>There, in his noisy mansion skill'd to rule,</L>
<L>The village master taught his little school:</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="023246_0031_0FBEDDC72095A8D8"/>A man severe he was, and stern to view;</L>

<L>While words of learned length and thund'ring sound,</L>
<L>Amaz'd the gazing rustics rang'd around;</L>
<L>And still they gaz'd, and still the wonder grew,</L>
<L>That one small head could carry all he knew.</L>
<L>But past is all his fame. The very spot,</L>
<L>Where many a time he triumph'd, is forgot.</L>
<L>Near yonder thorn, that lifts its head on high,</L>
<L>Where once the sign-post caught the passing eye,</L>
<L>Low lies that house where nut-brown draughts inspir'd,</L>
<L>Where grey-beard mirth, and smiling toil retir'd,</L>
<L>Where village statesmen talk'd with looks profound,</L>
<L>And news, much older than their ale, went round.</L>
<L>Imagination fondly stoops to trace</L>
<L>The parlour splendors of the festive place;</L>
<L>The white-wash'd wall, the nicely sanded floor,</L>

<L>When time advances, and when lovers fail,</L>
<L>She then shines forth, solicitous to bless,</L>
<L>In all the glaring impotence of dress.</L>
<L>Thus fares the land, by luxury betray'd,</L>
<L>In nature's simplest charms at first array'd:</L>

<L>To pamper luxury, and thin mankind;</L>
<L>To see each joy the sons of pleasure know,</L>

<HEAD>THE HERMIT. PARNELL.</HEAD>
<L>FAR in a wild, unknown to public view,</L>
<L>From youth to age, a rev'rend hermit grew:</L>
<L>The moss his bed, the cave his humble cell,</L>
<L>His food the fruits, his drink the crystal well;</L>
<L>Remote from man, with God he pass'd his days,</L>
<L>Pray'r all his business, all his pleasure praise.</L>
<L>A life so sacred, such serene repose,</L>
<L>Seem'd heav'n itself, till one suggestion rose—</L>
<L>That vice should triumph, virtue vice obey;</L>
<L>This sprung some doubts of Providence sway:</L>
<L>His hopes no more a certain prospect boast,</L>
<L>And all the tenor of his soul is lost.</L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="023246_0041_0FBEDDDA21F227B0"/>So when a smooth expanse receives imprest</L>
<L>Calm nature's image on its wat'ry breast,</L>
<L>Down bend the banks, the trees depending grow,</L>
<L>And skies beneath with answ'ring colours glow:</L>
<L>But if a stone the gentle sea divide,</L>
<L>Swift ruffling circles curl on ev'ry side,</L>
<L>And glimm'ring fragments of a broken sun;</L>
<L>Banks, trees, and skies, in thick disorder run.</L>
<L>To clear this doubt, to know the world by sight,</L>
<L>To find if books or swains report it right,</L>
<L>(For yet by swains alone the world he knew,</L>
<L>Whose feet came wand'ring o'er the nightly dew)</L>
<L>He quits his cell: the pilgrim staff he bore,</L>
<L>And fix'd the scallop in his hat before;</L>
<L>Then with the sun a rising journey went,</L>
<L>Sedate to think, and watching each event.</L>
<L>The mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n was wasted in the pathless grass,</L>
<L>And long and lonesome was the wild to pass:</L>
<L>But when the southern sun had warm'd the day,</L>
<L>A youth came posting o'er a crossing way;</L>
<L>His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aiment decent, his complexion fair,</L>
<L>And soft, in graceful ringlets, wav'd his hair:</L>
<L>Then near approaching, "Father, hail!" he cry'd;</L>
<L>And "hail my son!" the rev'rend sire reply'd;</L>
<L>Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds follow'd wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds; from question answer flow'd;</L>
<L>And talk of various kind deceiv'd the road;</L>
<L>Till each wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h other pleas'd, and loth to part,</L>
<L>While in their age they differ, join in heart.</L>
<L>Thus stands an aged elm in ivy bound,</L>
<L>Thus youthful ivy clasps an elm around.</L>
<L>Now sunk the sun: the closing hour of day</L>
<L>Came onward, mantl'd o'er with sober grey;</L>
<L>Nature in silence bid the world repose:</L>
<L>When near the road a stately palace rose.</L>
<L>There, by the moon, through ranks of trees they pass,</L>
<L>Whose verdure crown'd their sloping sides of grass.</L>
<L>It chanc'd the noble master of the dome</L>
<L>Still made his house the wand'ring stranger's home:</L>
<L>Yet still the kindness, from a thirst of praise,</L>
<L>Prov'd the vain flourish of expensive ease.</L>
<L>The pair arrive: the liv'ry'd servants wait:</L>
<L>Their lord receives them at the pompous gat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</L>
<L><PB N="35" REF="023246_0042_0FBEDDDCF273E4C0"/>The table groans with costly piles of food,</L>
<L>And all is more than hospitably good.</L>
<L>Then, led to rest, the day's long toil they drown,</L>
<L>Deep sunk in sleep, and silk, and heaps of down.</L>
<L>At length 'tis morn; and at the dawn of day</L>
<L>Along the wide canals the zephyrs play;</L>
<L>Fresh o'er the gay parterres the breezes creep.</L>
<L>And shake the neighbouring wood to banish sleep.</L>
<L>Up rise the guests, obedient to the call;</L>
<L>An early banquet deck'd the splendid hall:</L>
<L>Rich luscious wine a golden goblet grac'd,</L>
<L>Which the kind master forc'd the guests to taste.</L>
<L>Then, pleas'd and thankful, from the porch they go;</L>
<L>And, but the landlord, none had cause of woe:</L>
<L>His cup was vanish'd; for in secret guise</L>
<L>The younger guest purloin'd the glitt'ring prize.</L>
<L>As one who spies a serpent in his way,</L>
<L>Glist'ning and basking in the summer ray,</L>
<L>Disorder'd, stops, to shun the danger near,</L>
<L>Then walks with faintness on, and looks with fear;</L>
<L>So seem'd the fire, when, far upon the road,</L>
<L>The shining spoil his wiley partner show'd.</L>
<L>He stopp'd with silence, walk'd with trembling heart</L>
<L>And much he wish'd, but durst not ask, to part:</L>
<L>Murm'ring he lifts his eyes, and thinks it hard</L>
<L>That gen'rous actions meet a base reward.</L>
<L>While thus they pass, the sun his glory shrouds;</L>
<L>The changing skies hang out their sable clouds;</L>
<L>A sound in air presag'd approaching rain,</L>
<L>And beasts to covert send across the plain.</L>
<L>Warn'd by the signs, the wand'ring pair retreat,</L>
<L>To seek for shelter at a neighb'ring seat:</L>
<L>'Twas built with turrets on a rising ground,</L>
<L>And strong, and large, and unimprov'd around;</L>
<L>Its owner's temper, tim'rous and severe,</L>
<L>Unkind and griping, caus'd a desert there.</L>
<L>As near the miser's heavy doors they drew,</L>
<L>Fierce rising gusts with sudden fury blew;</L>
<L>The nimble lightning, mix'd with show'rs, began,</L>
<L>And o'er their heads loud rolling thunders ran.</L>
<L>Here long they knock; but knock or call in vain,</L>
<L>Driv'n by the wind and batter'd by the rain.</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="023246_0043_0FBEDDDE00FFDFE8"/>At length some pity warm'd the master's breast,</L>
<L>('Twas then his threshold first receiv'd a guest):</L>
<L>Slow creeking, turns the door with jealous care,</L>
<L>And half he welcomes in the shiv'ring pair;</L>
<L>One frugal faggot lights the naked walls,</L>
<L>And nature's fervor through their limbs recals:</L>
<L>Bread of the coarsest sort, with meagre wine,</L>
<L>(Each hardly granted) serv'd them both to dine;</L>
<L>And when the tempest first appear'd to cease,</L>
<L>A ready warning bid them part in peace.</L>
<L>With still remark the pond'rous hermit view'd,</L>
<L>In one so rich, a life so poor and rude;</L>
<L>And why should such (within himself he cry'd)</L>
<L>Lock the lost wealth a thousand want beside?</L>
<L>But what new marks of wonder soon took place</L>
<L>In ev'ry settling feature of his face,</L>
<L>When from his vest the young companion bore</L>
<L>That cup the gen'rous landlord own'd before,</L>
<L>And paid profusely with the precious bowl</L>
<L>The stinted kindness of this churlish soul!</L>
<L>But now the clouds in airy tumult fly;</L>
<L>The sun, emerging, opes an azure sky;</L>
<L>A fresher green the smiling leaves display,</L>
<L>And, glitt'ring as they tremble, cheer the day:</L>
<L>The weather courts them from their poor retreat,</L>
<L>And the glad master bolts the wary gate.</L>
<L>While hence they walk, the pilgrim's bosom wrought</L>
<L>With all the travel of uncertain thought;</L>
<L>His partner's acts without their cause appear:</L>
<L>'Twas there a vice, and seem'd a madness here:</L>
<L>Detesting that, and pitying this, he goes,</L>
<L>Lost and confounded with the various shows.</L>
<L>Now night's dim shades again involve the sky;</L>
<L>Again the wand'rers want a place to lie;</L>
<L>Again they search, and find a lodging nigh.</L>
<L>The soil improv'd around, the mansion neat,</L>
<L>And neither poorly low nor idly great;</L>
<L>It seem'd to speak it's master's turn of mind,</L>
<L>Content—and not for praise, but virtue, kind.</L>
<L>Hither the walkers turn with weary feet,</L>
<L>Then bless the mansion, and the master greet:</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="023246_0044_0FBEDDE0EE966FF8"/>Their greeting fair, bestow'd with modest guise,</L>
<L>The courteous master hears, and thus replies:</L>
<L>"Without a vain, without a grudging heart,</L>
<L>To him, who gives us all, I yield a part;</L>
<L>From him you come; for him accept it here,</L>
<L>A frank and sober, more than costly cheer."</L>
<L>He spoke; and bid the welcome table spread:</L>
<L>Then talk'd of virtue till the time of bed;</L>
<L>When the grave household round his hall repair,</L>
<L>Warn'd by a bell, and close the hours with pray'r.</L>
<L>At length the world, renew'd by calm repose,</L>
<L>Was strong for toil; the dappled morn arose;</L>
<L>Before the pilgrims part, the younger crept</L>
<L>Near the clos'd cradle, where an infant slept,</L>
<L>And writh'd his neck: the landlord's little pride,</L>
<L>O strange return! grew black, and gasp'd, and dy'd,</L>
<L>Horror of horrors! what! his only son!</L>
<L>How look'd our hermit when the fact was done?</L>
<L>Not hell, tho' hell's black jaws in sunder part,</L>
<L>And breathe blue fire, could more assault his heart.</L>
<L>Confus'd, and struck with silence at the deed,</L>
<L>He flies, but, trembling, fails to fly with speed.</L>
<L>His steps the youth pursues; the country lay</L>
<L>Perplex'd with roads; a servant show'd the way:</L>
<L>A river cross'd the path; the passage o'er</L>
<L>Was nice to find; the servant trod before;</L>
<L>Long arms of oaks an open bridge supply'd,</L>
<L>And deep the waves beneath the bending glide.</L>
<L>The youth, who seem'd to watch a time to sin,</L>
<L>Approach'd the careless guide, and thrust him in:</L>
<L>Plunging he falls, and rising lifts his head,</L>
<L>Then flashing turns, and sinks among the dead.</L>
<L>Wild sparkling rage inflames the father's eyes,</L>
<L>He bursts the bands of fear, and madly cries,</L>
<L>"Detested wretch!"—But scarce his speech began,</L>
<L>When the strange partner seem'd no longer man:</L>
<L>His youthful face grew more serenely sweet;</L>
<L>His robe turn'd white, and flow'd upon his feet;</L>
<L>Fair rounds of radiant points invest his hair;</L>
<L>Celestial odours breathe through purpled air;</L>
<L>And wings, whose colours glitter'd on the day,</L>
<L>Wide at his back their gradual plumes display,</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="023246_0045_0FBEDDE3D22E1168"/>The form ethereal bursts upon his sight,</L>
<L>And moves in all the majesty of light.</L>
<L>Tho' loud at first the pilgrim's passion grew,</L>
<L>Sudden he gaz'd, and wist not what to do;</L>
<L>Surprise in secret chains his words suspends,</L>
<L>And in a calm his settling temper ends.</L>
<L>But silence here the beauteous angel broke,</L>
<L>(The voice of music ravish'd as he spoke.)</L>
<L>"Thy pray'r, thy praise, thy life to vice unknown,</L>

<L>These charms success in our bright region find,</L>
<L>And force an angel down to calm thy mind;</L>
<L>For this commission'd, I forsook the sky;</L>
<L>Nay, cease to kneel!—thy fellow-servant I.</L>
<L>"Then know the truth of government divine,</L>
<L>And let these scruples be no longer thine.</L>
<L>"The Maker justly claims the world he made,</L>
<L>In this the right of providence is laid;</L>
<L>Its sacred majesty through all depends</L>
<L>On using second means to work his ends;</L>
<L>'Tis thus, withdrawn in state from human eye,</L>
<L>The pow'r exerts his attributes on high,</L>
<L>Your actions uses, nor controuls your will,</L>
<L>And bids the doubting sons of men be still.</L>
<L>"What strange events can strike with more surprise,</L>
<L>Than those which lately struck thy wond'ring eyes?</L>
<L>Yet, taught by these, confess th' Almighty just,</L>
<L>And where you can't unriddle, learn to trust.</L>
<L>"The great, vain man, who far'd on costly food,</L>
<L>Whose life was too luxurious to be good—</L>

<L>And drives vast billows to the distant land.</L>
<L>As yawns an earthquake, when imprison'd air</L>

<L>The whale expands his jaws' enormous size:</L>
<L>The prophet views the cavern with surprise;</L>
<L>Measures his monstrous teeth, afar descry'd,</L>
<L>And rolls his wond'ring eyes from side to side:</L>
<L>Then takes possession of the spacious seat,</L>
<L>And sails secure within the dark retreat.</L>
<L>Now is he pleas'd the northern blast to hear,</L>
<L>And hangs on liquid mountains, void of fear;</L>
<L>Or falls immers'd into the depths below,</L>
<L>Where the dead, silent waters never flow;</L>
<L>To the foundations of the hills convey'd,</L>
<L>Dwells in the shelving mountain's dreadful shade:</L>
<L>Where plummet never reach'd, he draws his breath;</L>
<L>And glides serenely through the paths of Death.</L>
<L>Two wond'rous days and nights, thro' coral groves,</L>
<L>Thro' labyrinths of rocks and sands, he roves:</L>
<L>When the third morning with its level rays</L>
<L>The mountains gilds, and on the billows plays,</L>
<L>It sees the king of waters rise, and pour</L>
<L>His sacred guest, uninjur'd, on the shore:</L>
<L>A type of that great blessing, which the Muse</L>

<HEAD>THE LAST DAY. BOOK III.</HEAD>
<L>THE book unfolding, the resplendent seat</L>
<L>Of saints and angels, the tremendous fate</L>

<L>The triumph rings! archangels shout around!</L>
<L>And echoing nature lengthens out the sound!</L>
<L>Ten thousand trumpets <HI>now</HI> at one advance;</L>

<L>So deep the silence, and so strong the blast,</L>

<L>Nor man, nor angel moves; the Judge on high</L>
<L>Looks round, and with his glory fills the sky:</L>
<L>Then on the fatal book his hand he lays,</L>
<L>Which high to view supporting seraphs raise;</L>
<L>In solemn form the rituals are prepar'd,</L>
<L>The seal is broken, and a groan is heard.</L>
<L>And thou, my soul, (O fall to sudden pray'r,</L>
<L>And let the thought sink deep!) shalt thou be there?</L>
<L>See on the left, (for by the great command</L>
<L>The throng, divided, falls on either hand,)</L>
<L>How weak, how pale, how haggard, how obscene,</L>

<L>They shock the heart, and turn away the sight;</L>
<L>In gloomy orbs their trembling eye-balls roll,</L>
<L>And tell the horrid secrets of the soul.</L>
<L>Each gesture mourns; each look is black with care;</L>
<L>And ev'ry groan is loaden with despair.</L>
<L>Reader, if guilty, spare the muse; and find</L>
<L>A truer image pictur'd in thy mind.</L>
<L>Should'st thou behold thy brother, father, wife,</L>
<L>And all the soft companions of thy life,</L>

<L>Cast on the left of all whom thou hast known—</L>
<L>How would it wound? what millions would'st thou give</L>
<L>For one more trial, one day more to live?</L>
<L>Flung back in time an hour, a moment's space,</L>
<L>To grasp with eagerness the means of grace:</L>

<L>What purple bloom my ravish'd soul admires,</L>
<L>And their eyes sparkling with immortal fires!</L>

<L>All lost, all undistinguish'd, no where found,</L>

<L>A Fellow in a market town,</L>
<L>Most musical, cried razors up and down,</L>

<LG>
<L>AT the close of the day, when the hamlet is still,</L>
<L>And mortals the sweets of forgetfulness prove—</L>
<L>When nought but the torrent is heard on the hill,</L>
<L>And nought but the nightingale's song in the grove—</L>
<L>'Twas then, by the cave of the mountain reclin'd,</L>
<L>A hermit his nightly complaint thus began:</L>
<L>Tho' mournful his numbers, his soul was resign'd;</L>
<L>He thought as a sage, tho' he felt as a man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Ah! why, thus abandon'd to darkness and woe,</L>
<L>'Why thus, lonely Philomel, flows thy sad strain?</L>
<L>'For spring shall return, and a lover bestow;</L>
<L>'And thy bosom no trace of misfortune retain.</L>
<L>'Yet if Pity inspire thee, O cease not thy lay!</L>
<L>'Mourn, sweetest complainer; man calls thee to mourn:</L>
<L>'O soothe him, whose pleasures, like thine, pass away!</L>
<L>'Full quickly they pass—but they never return!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Now, gliding remote on the verge of the sky,</L>
<L>'The moon, half extinct, a dim crescent displays;</L>
<L>'But lately I mark'd, when majestic on high</L>
<L>'She shone, and the planets were lost in her blaze.</L>
<L>'Roll on then, fair orb, and with gladness pursue</L>
<L>'The path that conducts thee to splendor again:</L>
<L>'But man's faded glory no change shall renew;</L>
<L>'Ah, fool! to exult <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a glory so vain!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>''Tis night, and the landscape is lovely no more▪</L>
<L>'I mourn; but, ye woodlands, I mourn not for you;</L>
<L>'For morn is approaching, your charms to restore,</L>
<L>'Perfum'd with fresh fragrance, and glitt'ring with dew.</L>
<L>'Nor yet for the ravage of winter I mourn;</L>
<L>'Kind Nature the embrio-blossom will save:</L>
<L>'But when shall spring visit the mould'ring urn!</L>
<L>'O when shall it dawn on the night of the grave!'</L>

<L>''Twas thus, by the glare of false science betray'd,</L>
<L>'That leads, to bewilder, and dazzles to blind:</L>
<L>'My thoughts wont to roam, from shade onward to shade,</L>
<L>'Destruction before me, and sorrow behind.</L>
<L>'O pity, great Father of light, then I cry'd,</L>
<L>'Thy creature, who fain would not wander from thee!</L>
<L>'Lo, humbled in dust, I relinquish my pride▪</L>
<L>'From doubt and from darkness thou only canst free.</L>

<L>'And darkness and doubt are now flying away,</L>
<L>'No longer I roam in conjecture forlorn,</L>
<L>'So breaks on the traveller, saint and astray,</L>
<L>'The bright and the balmy effulgence of morn.</L>
<L>'See Truth, Love, and Mercy, in triumph descending.</L>
<L>'And nature all glowing in Eden's first bloom,</L>
<L>'On the cold cheek of Death smiles and roses are blend∣ing.</L>
<L>'And beauty immortal awakes from the tomb.'</L>

<L>The mid-day toddy, and the evening sling.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, mighty Rum! and by this general name</L>
<L>I call each species—whisky, gin, or brandy:</L>
<L>(The kinds are various—but the effects the same;</L>
<L>And so I choose a name that's short and handy;</L>
<L>For, reader, know, it takes a deal of time,</L>
<L>To make a crooked word lie smooth in rhyme.)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, mighty Rum! thy song-inspiring merit</L>
<L>Is known to many a bard in these our days:</L>
<L>Apollo's drink, they find, is void of spirit—</L>
<L>Mere chicken-broth—insipid as their lays:</L>
<L>And, pleas'd, they'd give a riv'let—aye a sea</L>
<L>Of tuneful water, for one quart of thee!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, mighty Rum! how wond'rous is thy pow'r!</L>
<L>Unwarm'd by thee, how would our spirits fail,</L>
<L>When dark December comes, with aspect sour,</L>
<L>And, sharp as razor, blows the northern gale!</L>
<L>And yet thou'rt grateful in that sultry day,</L>
<L>When raging Sirius darts his fervid ray.</L>

<L>And find a sweet oblivion of their woes;</L>

<L>Forget their kindred—and forgive their foes.</L>
<L>And Lethe's stream, (so much extoll'd by some,</L>
<L>In ancient times) I shrewdly guess, was Rum.</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>When our bold fathers cross'd th' Atlantic wave,</L>
<L>And here arriv'd—a weak defenceless band—</L>
<L>Pray, what became of all the tribes so brave—</L>
<L>The savage owners of this happy land?</L>

<L>Our fathers were too wise to think of war;</L>
<L>They knew the woodlands were not quickly past:</L>
<L>They might have met with many an ugly scar—</L>
<L>Lost many a foretop—and been beat at last.</L>
<L>But Rum, assisted by his son, Disease,</L>
<L>Perform'd the business with surprising ease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And would our western brethren be less proud, or,</L>
<L>In other words, throw by their gun and drum—</L>
<L>For ducks and squirrels, save their lead and powder,</L>
<L>And send the tawny rogues some pipes of rum—</L>
<L>I dare predict, they all would gladly suck it;</L>
<L>And ev'ry mother's sun soon <HI>kick the bucket.</HI></L>

<L>Far from danger, void of fear,</L>
<L>Warbling to the list'ning ear,</L>
<L>Notes of pleasure, airy, wild,</L>
<L>Softly plaintive—sweetly mild;</L>
<L>Whisp'ring to the shady grove</L>
<L>Tender strains of artless love.</L>
<L>Of real or of fancy'd ills,</L>
<L>That human life incessant feels,</L>
<L>Our visionary hopes or fears,</L>
<L>It nothing knows, and nothing cares.</L>
<L>Often when the streaks of morn,</L>

<L>When, bursting on the verdant mead,</L>
<L>They bid the shades of night recede;</L>
<L>Or on the lawn clear splendors break,</L>
<L>And all the feather'd choir awake;</L>
<L>Then little red breast takes her seat,</L>
<L>Near my lone—my cool retreat.</L>
<L>There, in nature's melting lays,</L>

<L>WHEN from the deep, ascended earth and heav'n,</L>

<L>Unlike his sons, no guilt his mind deform'd;</L>
<L>His life, his limbs, no fierce diseases storm'd;</L>
<L>Nor Death's cold poison pal'd his glowing bloom,</L>
<L>Nor knew his feet the journey to the tomb.</L>
<L>Young Beauty's purple splendor round him play'd:</L>
<L>Immortal Health his vigorous limbs array'd;</L>
<L>Life, eldest heiress of th' empyreal sky,</L>
<L>Smil'd on his cheek, and blossom'd in his eye.</L>
<L>Array'd in endless light, his infant mind</L>

<L>And warm'd the bosom with a youth divine.</L>

<L>His hand such nature to the man assign'd,</L>

<L>His limbs incas'd, he flash'd devouring light:</L>
<L>On burning wheels, o'er heav'n's crystalline road</L>
<L>Thunder'd the chariot of the filial God;</L>
<L>The burning wheels on golden axles turn'd,</L>
<L>With flaming gems the golden axles burn'd.</L>
<L>Lo! the apostare host, with terror struck,</L>
<L>Roll back by millions! Th' empyrean shook!</L>
<L>Sceptres, and orbed shields, and crowns of gold,</L>
<L>Cherubs and seraphs in confusion roll'd;</L>
<L>Till from his hand the triple thunder hurl'd,</L>
<L>Compell'd them, headlong, to th' infernal world.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then tuneful Pope, whom all the nine inspire,</L>
<L>With saphic sweetness, and pindaric fire,</L>
<L>Father of verse! melodious and divine!</L>
<L>Next peerless Milton should distinguish'd shine.</L>
<L>Smooth slow his numbers, when he paints the grove,</L>
<L>Th' enraptur'd virgins list'ning into love.</L>
<L>But when the night, and hoarse resounding storm</L>
<L>Rush on the deep and Neptune's face deform,</L>
<L>Rough runs the verse, the son'rous numbers roar,</L>
<L>Like the hoarse surge that thunders on the shore.</L>
<L>But when he sings th' exhilirated swains,</L>
<L>Th' embow'ring groves, and Windsor's blissful plains,</L>
<L>Our eyes are ravish'd with the sylvan scene,</L>
<L>Embroider'd fields, and groves in living green:</L>
<L>His lays the verdure of the meads prolong,</L>
<L>And wither'd forests blossom in his song.</L>
<L>Thames' silver streams his flowing verse admire,</L>
<L>And cease to murmur while he tunes his lyre.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next should appear great Dryden's lofty muse,</L>
<L>For who would Dryden's polish'd verse refuse?</L>
<L><PB N="232" REF="023246_0239_0FBEEEDBC7111500"/>His lips were moisten'd in Parnassus' spring,</L>
<L>And Pho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bus taught his laureat son to sing.</L>
<L>How long did Virgil untranslated moan,</L>
<L>His beauties fading, and his slights unknown;</L>
<L>Till Dryden rose, and, in exalted strain,</L>
<L>Re-sang the fortune of the god-like man!</L>
<L>Again the Trojan prince, with dire delight,</L>
<L>Dreadful in arms, demands the ling'ring fight:</L>
<L>Again Camilla glows with martial fire,</L>
<L>Drives armies back, and makes all Troy retire.</L>
<L>With more than native lustre, Virgil shines,</L>
<L>And gains sublimer heights in Dryden's lines.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The gentle Watts, who strings his silver lyre</L>
<L>To sacred odes, and heav'n's all-ruling Sire;</L>
<L>Who scorns th' applause of the licentious stage,</L>
<L>And mounts yon sparkling worlds with hallow'd rage,</L>
<L>Compels my thoughts to wing the heav'nly road,</L>
<L>And wafts my soul, exulting, to my God:</L>

<L>Thy raptur'd breast with such seraphic fire;</L>
<L>But prompting angels warm thy boundless rage,</L>
<L>Direct thy thoughts, and animate thy page.</L>
<L>Blest man! for spotless sanctity rever'd,</L>
<L>Lov'd by the good, and by the guilty fear'd:</L>
<L>Blest man! from gay, delusive scenes remov'd,</L>
<L>Thy Maker loving, by thy Maker lov'd,</L>
<L>To God thou tun'st thy consecrated lays,</L>
<L>Nor meanly blush to sing Jehovah's praise.</L>
<L>Oh! did, like thee, each laurel'd bard delight</L>
<L>To paint Religion in her native light,</L>
<L>Not then with plays the lab'ring press would groan,</L>
<L>Nor Vice defy the pulpit and the throne;</L>
<L>No impious rhymers charm a vicious age,</L>

<HEAD>SKETCHES OF AMERICAN HISTORY. FRENEAU.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE American world, as our histories say,</L>
<L>Secluded from Europe long centuries lay,</L>
<L>But peopled by beings whom white men detest,</L>
<L>The sons of the Tartars that came from the west.</L>
<L>These Indians, 'tis certain, were here long before ye all,</L>
<L>And dwelt in their wigwams from time immemorial;</L>
<L>In a mere state of nature, untutor'd, untaught,</L>
<L>They did as they pleas'd, and they spoke as they thought:</L>
<L>No priests they had then for the cure of their souls,</L>
<L>No lawyers, recorders, nor keepers of rolls;</L>
<L>No learned physicians vile nostrums conceal'd—</L>
<L>Their druggist was Nature—her shop was the field.</L>
<L>In the midst of their forests how happy and blest,</L>
<L>In the skin of a bear or a buffalo drest!</L>
<L>No care to perplex, and no luxury seen</L>
<L>But the feast, and the song, and the dance on the green.</L>
<L>Some bow'd to the moon, and some worshipp'd the sun,</L>
<L>And the king and the captain were center'd in one;</L>
<L>In a cabin they met, on their councils of state,</L>
<L>Where age and experience alone might debate:</L>
<L>With quibbles they never essay'd to beguile,</L>
<L>And nature had taught them the orator's stile;</L>
<L>No pomp they affected, nor quaintly refin'd</L>
<L>The nervous idea that glanc'd on the mind.</L>
<L>When hunting or battle invited to arms,</L>
<L>The women they left to take care of their farms—</L>
<L>The toils of the summer did winter repay,</L>
<L>While snug in their cabins they snor'd it away.</L>
<L>If Death came among them, his dues to demand,</L>
<L>They still had some prospect of comfort at hand—</L>
<L>The dead man they sent to the regions of bliss,</L>
<L>With his bottle and dog, and his fair maids to kiss.</L>
<L>Thus happy they dwelt in a rural domain,</L>
<L>Uninstructed in commerce, unpractic'd in gain,</L>
<L>Till, taught by the loadstone to traverse the seas,</L>
<L>Columbus came over, that bold Genoese.</L>
<L>From records authentic, the date we can show,</L>
<L>One thousand four hundred and ninety and two</L>
<L>Years, borne by the seasons, had vanish'd away,</L>
<L>Since the babe in the manger at Bethlehem lay.</L>
<L><PB N="238" REF="023246_0245_0FBEEEE93984CEC8"/>What an era was this, above all that had pass'd,</L>
<L>To yield such a treasure, discover'd at last—</L>
<L>A new world, in value exceeding the old,</L>
<L>Such mountains of silver, such torrents of gold!</L>
<L>Yet the schemes of Columbus, however well plann'd,</L>
<L>Were scarcely sufficient to find the main land;</L>
<L>On the islands alone with the natives he spoke,</L>
<L>Except when he enter'd the great Oronoque:</L>
<L>In this he resembled old Moses, the Jew,</L>
<L>Who, roving about with his wrong-headed crew,</L>
<L>When at length the reward was no longer deny'd,</L>
<L>From the top of mount Pisgah he saw it, and dy'd.</L>
<L>These islands and worlds in the wat'ry expanse,</L>
<L>Like most mighty things, were the offspring of chance,</L>
<L>Since, steering for Asia, Columbus, they say,</L>
<L>Was astonish'd to find such a world in his way:</L>
<L>No wonder, indeed, he was smit with surprise—</L>
<L>This empire of nature was new to their eyes—</L>
<L>Cut short in their course by so splendid a scene,</L>
<L>Such a region of wonders intruding between!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet great as he was and deserving, no doubt,</L>
<L>We have only to thank him for finding the route;</L>
<L>These climes to the northward, more stormy and cold,</L>
<L>Were reserv'd for the efforts of Cabot the bold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where the sun in December appears to decline,</L>
<L>Far off to the southward, and south of the line,</L>
<L>A merchant <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Americus Vespucius.</NOTE> of Florence, more fortunate still,</L>
<L>Explor'd a new track, and discover'd Brazil:</L>
<L>Good fortune, Vespucius, pronounc'd thee her own.</L>
<L>Or else to mankind thou hadst scarcely been known—</L>
<L>By giving thy name, thou art ever renown'd—</L>
<L>Thy name to a world that another had found!</L>
<L>Columbia the name was, that merit decreed,</L>
<L>But Fortune and Merit have never agreed—</L>
<L>Yet the poets, alone, with commendable care,</L>
<L>Are vainly attempting the wrong to repair.</L>

<L>The bounds I prescribe to my verse are too narrow,</L>
<L>To tell of the conquests of Francis Pizarro;</L>
<L><PB N="239" REF="023246_0246_0FBEEEEE3882EF28"/>And Cortez 'tis needless to bring into view,</L>
<L>One Mexico conquer'd, the other Peru.</L>
<L>Montezuma with credit in verse might be read,</L>
<L>But Dryden has told you the monarch <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Indian emperor, a tragedy.</NOTE>is dead!</L>
<L>And the woes of his subjects—what torments they bore</L>
<L>Las Casas, good bishop, has mention'd before:</L>
<L>Let others be fond of their stanzas of grief—</L>
<L>I hate to descant on the fall of the leaf—</L>
<L>Two scenes are so gloomy, I view them with pain,</L>
<L>The annals of Death, and the triumphs of Spain.</L>
<L>Poor Ata-bualpa I cannot forget—</L>
<L>He gave them his utmost, yet died in their debt.</L>
<L>His wealth was a crime, that they could not forgive,</L>
<L>And when they possess'd it—forbade him to live.</L>
<L>Foredoom'd to misfortunes (that came not alone)</L>
<L>He was the twelfth Inca that sat on the throne,</L>
<L>Who fleecing his brother <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Huascar, who was legal heir to the throne.</NOTE> of half his domains,</L>
<L>At the palace of Cusco confin'd him in chains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But what am I talking—or where do I roam?</L>
<L>'Tis time that our story was brought nearer home—</L>
<L>From Florida's cape did Cabot explore</L>
<L>To the fast frozen regions of cold Labradore.</L>
<L>In the year fourteen hundred and ninety and eight</L>
<L>He came, as the annals of England relate:</L>
<L>But finding no gold in the lengthy domain,</L>
<L>And coasting the country, he left it again.</L>
<L>Next Davis—then Hudson adventur'd, they say,</L>
<L>One found out a streight, and the other a bay,</L>
<L>Whose desolate region, or turbulent wave</L>
<L>One present bestow'd him—and that was a grave.</L>

<L>Twelve years after this, some scores of dissenters</L>

<L>Outdone by the bishops, those great faggot fighters,</L>
<L>They left them to hell with their cassocks and mitres.</L>
<L>Thus banish'd forever, and leaving the sod,</L>
<L>The first land they saw was the pitch of Cape Cod,</L>
<L>Where, famish'd with hunger, and quaking with cold,</L>
<L>They plann'd their new Plymouth—so call'd from the old.</L>
<L>They were, without doubt, a delightful collection;—</L>
<L>Some came to be rid of a Stuart's direction;</L>
<L>Some sail'd with a view to dominion and riches,</L>
<L>Some to pray without book, and a few to hang witches;</L>
<L>Some came, on the Indians to shed a new light,</L>
<L>Convinc'd, long before, that their own must be right,</L>
<L>And that all, who had died in the centuries past,</L>
<L>On the devil's lee shore were eternally cast.</L>
<L>These exiles were cast in a whimsical mould,</L>
<L>And were aw'd by their priests, like the Hebrews of old;</L>
<L>Disclaim'd all pretences to jesting and laughter,</L>
<L>And sigh'd their lives through to be happy hereafter.</L>
<L>On a crown immaterial their hearts were intent,</L>
<L>They look'd towards Zion, wherever they went,</L>
<L>Did all things in hope of a future reward,</L>
<L>And worry'd mankind—for the sake of the Lord.</L>
<L>With rigour excessive they strengthen'd their reign,</L>
<L>Their laws were conceiv'd in the ill-natur'd strain;</L>
<L>With mystical meanings the saint was perplext,</L>
<L>And the flesh and the devil were slain by a text.</L>
<L>The body was scourg'd, for the good of the soul,</L>
<L>All folly discourag'd by peevish controul,</L>
<L>A knot on the head was the sign of no grace,</L>
<L>And the pope and his comrade were pictur'd in lace.</L>
<L>A stove in their churches, or pews lin'd with green,</L>
<L>Were horrid to think of, much more to be seen.</L>
<L><PB N="241" REF="023246_0248_0FBEEEF184563AC0"/>Their bodies were warm'd with the linings of love,</L>
<L>And the sire was sufficient that flash'd from above.</L>
<L>'Twas a crime to assert, that the moon was opaque;</L>
<L>To say the earth mov'd, was to merit the stake;</L>
<L>And he, that could tell an eclipse was to be,</L>
<L>In the college of satan had ta'en his degree.</L>
<L>On Sundays their faces were dark as a cloud—</L>
<L>The road to the meeting was only allow'd;</L>
<L>And those they caught rambling, on bus'ness or pleasure,</L>
<L>Were sent to the stocks, to repent at their leisure.</L>
<L>This day was the mournfullest day in the week:</L>
<L>Except on religion, none ventur'd to speak:</L>
<L>This day was the day to examine their lives,</L>
<L>To clear off old scores, and to preach to their wives.</L>
<L>In the school of oppression though woefully taught,</L>
<L>'Twas only to be the oppressors they sought;</L>
<L>All, all but themselves were be-devil'd and blind,</L>
<L>And their narrow-soul'd creed was to serve all mankind.</L>
<L>This beautiful system of nature below</L>
<L>They neither consider'd, nor wanted to know,</L>
<L>And call'd it a dog-house wherein they were pent,</L>
<L>Unworthy themselves, and their mighty descent.</L>
<L>They never perceiv'd, that in nature's wide plan</L>
<L>There must be that whimsical creature. call'd man,</L>
<L>Far short of the rank he affects to attain,</L>
<L>Yet a link in its place, in creation's vast chain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whatever is foreign to us and our kind,</L>
<L>Can never be lasting, though seemingly join'd—</L>
<L>The hive swarm'd at length, and a tribe that was teaz'd,</L>
<L>Set out for Rhode-Island, to think as they pleas'd.</L>
<L>Some hundreds to Britain ran murmuring home—</L>
<L>While others went o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the forests to roam,</L>
<L>When they found they had mist what they look'd for at first,</L>
<L>The downfall of sin, and the reign of the just.</L>
<L>Hence, dry controversial reflexions were thrown,</L>
<L>And the old dons were vex'd in the way they had shown;</L>
<L>So those, that are held in the work-house all night,</L>
<L>Throw dirt the next day at the doors, out of spite.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah, pity the wretches that liv'd in those days,</L>
<L>(Ye modern admirers of novels and plays)</L>
<L><PB N="242" REF="023246_0249_0FBEEEF3681F31C8"/>When nothing was suffer'd but musty, dull rules,</L>
<L>And nonsense from Mather, and staff from the schools.</L>
<L>No story, could tempt them, like Rachel's, to sigh,</L>
<L>Susannah and Judith employ'd the bright eye—</L>
<L>No fine-spun adventures tormented the breast,</L>
<L>Like our modern Clarissa, Tom Jones, and the rest.</L>
<L>Those tyrants had chosen the books for your shelves,</L>
<L>(And, trust me, no other than suited themselves,</L>
<L>For always by this may a bigot be known,</L>
<L>He speaks well of nothing but what is his own.)</L>
<L>From indwelling evil these souls to release,</L>
<L>The quakers arriv'd, with their kingdom of peace—</L>
<L>But some were transported, and some bore the lash,</L>
<L>And four they hang'd fairly for preaching up thrash.</L>
<L>The lands of New England (of which we now treat)</L>
<L>Were famous, ere that, for producing of wheat;</L>
<L>But the soil (or tradition says strangely amiss)</L>
<L>Has been pester'd with pumpkins from that day to this.</L>
<L>Thus, feuds and vexations distracted their reign,</L>
<L>(And perhaps a few vestiges still may remain.)</L>
<L>But time has presented an offspring as bold,</L>
<L>Less free to believe, and more wise than the old.</L>
<L>Their phantoms, their wizzards, their witches are fled—</L>
<L>Matthew Paris's story with horror is read—</L>
<L>His daughters, and all the enchantments they bore—</L>
<L>And the demon that pinch'd them, are heard of no more.</L>
<L>Their taste for the fine arts is strangely increas'd,</L>
<L>And Latin's no longer a mark of the beast;</L>
<L>Mathematics, at present, a farmer may know,</L>
<L>Without being hang'd for connexions below.</L>
<L>Proud, rough, independent, undaunted and free,</L>
<L>And patient of hardships, their task is the sea,</L>
<L>Their country too barren their wish to attain,</L>
<L>They make up the loss by exploring the main.</L>
<L>Wherever bright Phoebus awakens the gales,</L>
<L>I see the bold Yankees expanding their sails,</L>
<L>Throughout the wide ocean pursuing their schemes,</L>
<L>And chasing the whales on its uttermost streams.</L>
<L>No climate, for them, is too cold or too warm,</L>
<L>They reef the broad canvass, and fight with the storm;</L>
<L>In war with the foremost their standards display,</L>
<L>Or glut the loud cannon with death, for the fray.</L>
<L><PB N="243" REF="023246_0250_0FBEEEF53A922018"/>No valour, in fable, their valour exceeds,</L>
<L>Their spirits are fitted for desperate deeds;</L>
<L>No rivals have they in our annals of fame,</L>
<L>Or if they are rivall'd, 'tis York has the claim.</L>
<L>Inspir'd at the sound, while the name she repeats,</L>
<L>Bold Fancy conveys me to Hudson's retreats—</L>
<L>Ah, sweet recollection of juvenile dreams</L>
<L>In the groves, and the forests that skirted his streams!</L>
<L>How often, with rapture, those streams were survey'd,</L>
<L>When, sick of the city, I flew to the shade—</L>
<L>How often the bard, and the peasant shall mourn</L>
<L>Ere those groves shall revive, and those shades shall re∣turn!</L>
<L>Not a hill, but some fortress disfigures it round!</L>
<L>And ramparts are rais'd where the cottage was found!</L>
<L>The plains and the vallies with ruin are spread,</L>
<L>With graves in abundance, and bones of the dead.</L>
<L>The first that attempted to enter this streight,</L>
<L>(In anno one thousand six hundred and eight),</L>
<L>Was Hudson (the same that we mention'd before,</L>
<L>Who was lost in the gulph that he went to explore.</L>
<L>For a sum that they paid him (we know not how much)</L>
<L>This captain transferr'd all his right to the Dutch;</L>
<L>For the time has been here, to the world be it known,</L>
<L>When all a man sail'd by, or saw, was his own.</L>
<L>The Dutch on their purchase sat quietly down,</L>
<L>And fix'd on an island to lay out a town;</L>
<L>They modell'd their streets from the horns of a ram,</L>
<L>And the name that best pleas'd them was New Amsterdam</L>
<L>They purchas'd large tracts from the Indians for beads,</L>
<L>And sadly tormented some runaway Swedes,</L>
<L>Who, none knows for what, from their country had flown</L>
<L>To live here in peace undisturb'd and alone.</L>
<L>New Belgia, the Dutch call'd their province, be sure,</L>
<L>But names never yet made possession secure;</L>
<L>For Charly (the second that honour'd the name)</L>
<L>Sent over a squadron, asserting his claim.</L>
<L>(Had his sword and his title been equally slender,</L>
<L>In vain had they summon'd Mynheer to surrender)</L>
<L>The soil they demanded, or threaten'd their worst,</L>
<L>Insisting that Cabot had look'd at it first.</L>
<L>The want of a squadron to fall on their rear,</L>
<L>Made the argument perfectly plain to Mynheer—</L>
<L>Force ended the contest—the right was a sham,</L>
<L><PB N="244" REF="023246_0251_0FBEEEF7536E3A58"/>And the Dutch were sent packing to hot Surinam.</L>
<L>'Twas hard to be thus of their lab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> priv'd,</L>
<L>But the age of republics had not yet arriv'd—</L>
<L>Fate saw—tho' no wizzard could tell them as much—</L>
<L>That the crown, in due time, was to fare like the Dutch.</L>

<L>SCARCE had the morn her orient course begun,</L>

<L>When Mingo on Ohio's margin stood,</L>
<L>And told his sorrows to the gliding flood;—</L>
<L>"With love of glory would the chiefs inflame</L>

<L>"In vain with glee, they show their scalps and scars,</L>

<L>"On me their praises and reproofs are lost,</L>
<L>"No flame but love, but scorching love I boast,</L>
<L>"The nimble Lawrah does my breast inspire,</L>
<L>"Wakes every sense, and sets me all on fire;</L>
<L>"Enraptur'd while I view her yellow neck,</L>
<L>"As soft as bear-grease, and as beaver sleek.</L>
<L>"From her grey eyes the living lightnings rush,</L>
<L>"Like the fresh dew-drops glitt'ring thro' a bush.</L>
