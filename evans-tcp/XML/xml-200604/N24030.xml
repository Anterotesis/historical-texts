<P>THE great applause testified on the representation of the '<HI>Man of the Times,</HI>' and the advice of seve∣ral of the author's friends, by whom the manuscript was pe∣rused, and whose approbation it met with, induce him to present it to the public; expecting, that, as it is a maiden piece, and the mo∣ral being unexceptionable, it will not be treated with inurbanity, but meet with that candour, so grateful to an author, and so be∣coming in a generous, indulgent public, who wish to encourage native dramatic literature, so that our stage may not always exhi∣bit foreign productions.</P>

<SPEAKER>Major.</SPEAKER>
<P>I TELL you, Lydia, I'll hear no more.— Plague on his virtues! When did a wi∣thered, rotten tree produce good fruit? It is impossible but the errors of the father must, in some degree, attach themselves to the son: And I had rather (dear as you are to me) wit∣ness your obsequies, than see you in the arms of a man, whose principles I despise. Old Screwpenny's speculations, cheats, and frauds are related at every tea-table throughout the United States; and shall the daughter of Ma∣jor Upright, by a marriage with such a ras∣cal's son, bring disgrace on the fair fame of her own father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear father, you know I have always regarded you as a friend, as well as pa∣rent: you have ever been acquainted with the
<PB N="2" REF="031790_0006_0FEE639E34885958"/>
secrets of my heart, and you may rest assured, that my conduct shall never be the cause of uneasiness to you. My acquaintance with Young Screwpenny commenced in England, whither your kindness sent me for my educati∣on; we were often together, and frequent in∣timacy produced a mutual esteem: We have since been fellow-passengers from England, and his kind attentions to me, on ship-board, cer∣tainly have made an impression on my heart, which will require some time to eradicate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major.</SPEAKER>
<P>I almost wish you had never seen England: the death of your mother, (whose memory still demands the sigh of tenderness) and, at that time, a want of good seminaries for education in this country, induced me to send you thither: But, thank heaven, we can now enjoy the blessing of giving our children a so∣lid and useful education, without sending them to a foreign country, where for every single lesson of utility they obtain, fifty follies sprout up to choak its growth:—Republicans can only be properly instructed in republican go∣vernments. However, Lydia, I hope I shall find in you, an exception to my general opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, sir, you will believe I have sense enough to distinguish between useful arts, and the tinsel of a modern British education. And believe me, sir, were you acquainted with Mr. Charles Screwpenny, your prejudices a∣gainst the father would be lost in your admi∣ration of the virtues of his son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="031790_0007_0FEE63A3386276A8"/>
<SPEAKER>Major.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prejudices! What! when he cheat∣ed my noble disbanded troops out of seven-eighths of the pay they had so hardly earned, so richly deserved, and so patiently waited for, is it a prejudice in me to call him a ras∣cal? —When I see him invariably shifting his sentiments of politics, to the opinion of the strongest party, merely to further his merce∣nary views, is it a prejudice in me to despise him?—When I see him continually employ∣ed in baneful monopolies, oppressions, and land speculations, distressing the poor, and bringing disgrace, infamy, and dishonor on my country, is it a prejudice in me to hate and detest him? No! I hope Major Upright will always be remarked for love of virtue, and detestation of vice. But come, Lydia, should I find Young Screwpenny the character you have described him to be, far be it from me to oppose your happiness; however it must be on certain conditions; and such as will pre∣vent the disgrace such a connexion will una∣voidably tend to produce.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear sir, I thank you—I am sure you will admire his virtues, and I shall be the happiest—But, let me hope, sir, the condi∣tions you mean to propose will be such as are in his power to comply with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! Never fear, my girl, if he is really virtuous, and truly loves you, no doubt but he will comply with them.</P>

<P><HI>Larn</HI> your customs! To be sure I shall. Ah, poor James, to what a devil of a scrape have you brought yourself: three years to serve, for a bit of a passage to this fine coun∣try, where to be sure the captain told me, the streets were paved with dollars, and every branch of pine was loaded with kegs of whis∣ky, guggling out of their bungs, and singing 'come drink me:' Well 'twas a devil of a lie, to be sure it was: And yet I have some few comforts left—there's my little Katy, as pret∣ty a piece of Irish white and red as the moon ever shone upon: To be sure she mended the captain's linen on board, for which she used to get now and then a sneaker of fresh soup: Och, devil burn such travelling; I'd rather have stump'd it here on my own two good-looking legs; but walking might have been a little difficult, when a man, at every step, would be over his chin in water, and I was al∣ways afraid to try.</P>

<SP>

<P>So, Mr. Noteall, very correct, very correct: I commend your care:—What did you say my notes sell for to-day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Note.</SPEAKER>
<P>At seventy-five per cent discount, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Screwp.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's well! that's well!—But, Mr. Noteall, it must be better: When they are down to two and six-pence in the pound, Mr. Premium shall have directions to buy in. The report of my want of cash, and danger of failing, will do all, never fear.—Have you procured the title deeds of the land I bought yesterday of Ploughshare, the Kentucky far∣mer:
<PB N="6" REF="031790_0010_0FEE63ACAD31D6E8"/>
He has my notes for sixty thousand dol∣lars, payable in six, twelve, and eighteen months; which shall be years—You under∣stand me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Note.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, sir: I received the deeds last night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Screwp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then go directly to my worthy friend Mr. Grub, tell him to step immediately to the Washington's head, and enquire for Mr. Ploughshare, enter into conversation with him, and, in a round about manner, come to the business of my purchase of his lands; then let him insinuate that my notes, bonds, words, or oaths are not worth a groat, and so frighten him into a wish to dispose of my notes, when he has done which, he may say he knows a man that will purchase them; and then carry him to Premium, who may give as far as ten thousand for the sixty; but be sure he makes as good a bargain as he can; and at any rate must not give more than ten thousand; not more than ten: D'ye hear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Note.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm gone, sir: But the men employ∣ed about your new building are now in the next room, waiting for their money; they say they have now five weeks' wages due, and that they wont work another stroke till they are paid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Screwp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell 'em I'm not at home; that you'll speak to me, and get their money for 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Note.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your coachman, sir, hath informed

them already, that you <HI>are</HI> at home; besides the fellow is growling for money himself.</P>

<P>He growling! the rascal, hath he not my notes? Good as cash—bating the dis∣count: —However, Noteall, give 'em checks on the bank.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Note.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have no money there, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Screwp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you blockhead, I know it, I know it; but before they can present the checks, the bank will be shut: Save my credit, and save my money:—Fine maxims, fine max∣ims, Mr. Noteall.</P>

So far, so good:—Who says I'm a rogue? I only take advantage of the weakness and folly of my countrymen: they, simple people, have given me credit; And should I not accept it? To be sure I ought: It's a duty I owe myself; and as for the coun∣try, of what consequence is its deplorable state, dearness of provisions, &amp;c. as long as my speculations can produce me cash more than equivalent to the dearth I impose upon others?—But there's my son Charles; I sent him to England to learn chicanery and art; but, to my utter disappointment, he has re∣turned with a contempt for every thing, but what he calls honesty, sincerity, philanthro∣phy, and such stuff:—These may be virtues, but in the present day, they will be found but poor recommendations to either power or pro∣fit:
<PB N="8" REF="031790_0012_0FEE63AFFAA0D1D0"/>
—How he should learn such nonsense in England I am at a loss to account for; but, at any rate, I am determined he shall unlearn it here.—
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> CHARLES.</STAGE>
—Well, sir, where have you been idling your time? Time is precious, Charles; when I was of your years I improved every minute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, sir, and so do I:—After so long an absence from my native shores, I find the greatest pleasure and satisfaction in con∣templating the increase of population, which hath been added to our country since I left it. Our city of Philadelphia hath grown beyond my expectations: At present the superfice strikes me as the emblem of happiness, peace, and plenty, although I have been told, since my arrival, there is a canker preying upon its vitals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Screwp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! What canker? What d'ye mean? Do you wish to be a mender of govern∣ments?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, sir; it is not the government I mean, 'tis private speculation, in which every nobler faculty of the mind is absorbed, the distresses of the poorer class of citizens ne∣glected, and the interest of the whole coun∣try prostituted to the emolument of an indi∣vidual.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Screwp.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, sir, who has been filling your head with such nonsense: I suppose you have been introduced into the spouting clubs,
<PB N="9" REF="031790_0013_0FEE63B740540F88"/>
on t'other side of the water, where a parcel of 'prentices and fellows of no soul, meet to discuss what they don't understand; I gave you let∣lers to noblemen, had you kept their compa∣ny you would have found a more amusing and profitable way of spending your time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am obliged to you, sir, for your re∣commendations; but, in the midst of their dissipation and pleasure, I sickened with their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and vices, and left them to enjoy, by themselves, that luxury, which appeared to me <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> deprivation of rational existence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Screwp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, sir, your ideas are so refi∣ned, that, I hope, by them alone you will be able to work yourself through the world; for, depend upon't, till you alter your sentiments, I will never put it in your power to live inde∣pendent of me.

Well, hang me, if I have not a good mind to disinherit this father of mine: I was told he was a speculator, and I think I gave him a tolerable rub:—Had he wished me to have been a counterpart of him∣self, he should have bred me under his own eye; but, thank my luckier fortune, consci∣ence is not yet lull'd within me; and so, dear dad, if you are disappointed in me, I am disap∣pointed in you, and so our disappointment is mu∣tual. —But I must haste to my amiable Lydia, she can amply repay me for the ill-treatment of a father, who not only wishes to govern my actions but my sentiments; if once I can make

<P>How! a ship of his? I never heard my father traded thither.</P>

<P>Why as to that—I'm afraid I have made a small mistake: But,

I sup∣pose it can make but little difference your be∣ing acquainted with the secret;—you must know then, for certain purposes this vessel is ostensibly owned by Mr. Grub.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why? What purpose can that answer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Note.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why—you must be secret though— you must understand, your father has a num∣ber of bills due, and there is such a thing as seizure for debt; now the property being own∣ed by another, it makes all safe, all secure, as we say:—But I must find your father.

<P>I hope, sir, you will not esteem this visit an intrusion; as, although I am not per∣sonally known to you, yet your character is familiar to me:—I had the pleasure to arrive in the same ship with your amiable daughter, and this visit is merely to enquire after her health.</P>

<P>Sir, I am acquainted with the at∣tentions you paid to her on board, and thank you for your kindness.—I hope, sir, you left your friends well in England, and that your travels in that country have not only been a∣greeable, but useful to you; for my part, ha∣ving never been from the place of my nativi∣ty, I know but little of England, except from books.</P>

<P>Faith, sir, the greatest pleasure I de∣rived from my travels, is the zest they have given me for the charms of my native coun∣try.—I have seen people in England decorated with all the tinsel of distinction and honor, whose narrow souls might have been compri∣sed in an egg shell; whilst real merit, in a thread-bare coat, in silent anguish, picked the crumbs of penury and wretchedness:— I have seen great ladies riding after a fox, and noble lords weaving lace, and exercising themselves on a wooden horse:—I have seen their principal city oppressed by contractors, speculators, and money lenders, and the peo∣ple caress their oppressors.</P>

<P>You deceive yourself—our enmity is so rooted, that no time can eradicate, or cir∣cumstance meliorate it:—We detest each o∣ther, but upon different grounds: He hates me for possessing that which he has all his life des∣pised —Honesty—that virtue, which makes the poor man great, and which, the want of, no riches can attone for.</P>

<SPEAKER>Major.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not suppose, young man, that your sentiments, in this particular, would be congenial with my own; but, mark me, if your heart is really virtuous, it will soon teach you to despise the vices of your father;—and this is my firm resolution, That no one, who bears <HI>his</HI> name, shall ever be connected with <HI>my</HI> family; therefore, if you marry my daugh∣ter, you must bear my name:—You have your choice, and so farewell.

<P>'Tis very true, James; but don't say any more about it:—Do sing me the song that you made about our passage from Ireland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>James.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, to be sure, any thing to please you, my jewel;—but since I've got the salt

water down my throat, devil burn me, I've lost my voice, and, by St. Patrick, 'tis lucky if I have not lost the tune too.</P>
<LG>
<HEAD>SONG.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>When we took our departure from Dublin's fam'd city,</L>
<L>For Columbia's free land, thro' the seas did we plow;</L>
<L>For eleven long weeks our hard case you might pity;</L>
<L>By plaguy cross winds we were blown to and fro;</L>
<L>But when out at sea, short allowance of water,</L>
<L>Our beef and our pork, than raw brine was far salter,</L>
<L>Join'd with being quite sick, made our voices to falter,</L>
<L>That we never more thought to sing langolee.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>But when her gay shores fair Columbia presented,</L>
<L>And the Cape's pretty light-house rose high to our view,</L>
<L>Not a soul then on board to drink whisky dissented,</L>
<L>For we toasted our Judy's, and sang to them too:</L>
<L>And now 'fore the town our gay ship did cast anchor;</L>
<L>With our stomachs quite lean, and our faces far lanker,</L>
<L>For Freedom's sweet beef and fresh greens we did hanker,</L>
<L>And long'd safe on shore to sing langolee.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>But alack, to be sure, we were all disappointed,</L>
<L>For one grievous thing by the way, we'd forgot,</L>
<L>To pay for our passage, the cash we all wanted;</L>
<L>But tho' we'd forgot it, the captain had not;</L>
<L>So he put us all up, like lean sheep in a pen, sir,</L>
<L>To be sold, like poor rogues, to some fine gentlemen, sir,</L>
<L>Who bought us all up, and promis'd us then, sir,</L>
<L>They'd keep us three years to sing langolee.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>To be sure, being sold made me feel quite down-hearted,</L>
<L>For I, before this, was ne'er bought in my days,</L>
<L>I look'd back for Dublin, from whence I departed,</L>
<L>But, alas! all in vain for the sod did I gaze.</L>
<L>But my master's kind treatment, my heart hath reviv'd, sir,</L>
<L>I ne'er fed so well all the days that I've liv'd, sir,</L>
<L>For Liberty's tree in Columbia has thriv'd, sir,</L>
<L>And the fruit it produces is Equality.</L>

<P>Aye, James, to be sure, we're very lucky in so good a master as the Major.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>James.</SPEAKER>
<P>Och to be sure we are:—Why they told me bugaboo stories in little Ireland about one thing and 'tother, to frighten little James from coming over, but 'twas all nonsense:— Why, there's Dermot and Patrick, and a do∣zen or two, more or less, that are just as com∣fortable as heart could wish:—We have no brats of boys of lords, and honorable spindle shanked puppies, to kick us about here; and then we have plenty of whisky and good eat∣ables — Do you mind, Katy, how round and plump I've got since I came here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Katy.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure you have—and I think I look better a great deal:—But see, here's my young lady coming—do go now down the back stairs.</P>

<P>Och, to be sure I will—but you have not paid me for my song.—What, you wont? Why then, by the powers of Venus, I'll take my pay my own dear self.

<P>Why not, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Pray do not be so rude.</P>

<P>I begs pardon, ma'am, I'm sure I wou'dn't offend you 'pon any account; but I was thinking—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, what was you thinking?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Katy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, ma'am, I was thinking, it was very hard, just when you thought you were going to be happy with your lover, to be disappointed; it put me in mind, when the ship I came in, first came in sight of America land, and all of us were so happy to think of being near to get ashore, after our rumbustious passage, when up come a <HI>norwester,</HI> (as the sail∣ors called it) and kept us seven days longer on the water; oh I thought I should have died! —But then we got safe ashore at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you; but I have no hopes of my wishes being crowned with the same success:—My father is determined; and I fear expects too much from Mr. Screwpen∣ny, when he supposes he would relinquish his name and family on my account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Katy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why law, ma'am, doesn't the bible say, that a man shall leave father and all, and cleave to his wife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="33" REF="031790_0037_0FEE63FF10FCA200"/>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, but not his name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Katy.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fig for his name!—We women change our names very often to oblige the men, and why shou'dn't they, now and then, ob∣lige us by changing theirs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ridiculous!—But, Katy, I want not your advice; bring me a book, I'll try and reconcile myself to my disappointment.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Katy goes to side, and returns.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Katy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear ma'am, here is my master com∣ing up stairs,—he'll be as good as a book, I warrant, he talks so sententious, 'tis as good as a sermon to hear him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>If my father is coming, you may leave me.
<STAGE>[Exit Katy.]</STAGE>
Heavens!—When shall I recover my lost happiness?—I cannot accuse my father as the author of my misery; and yet, he alone is the bar to my obtaining that which appears to me my only felicity:— However, if rectitude of conduct insures peace of mind, that blessing is still my own.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Major</HI> UPRIGHT,</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Lydia,—I am come to spend a few hours in conversation with you:—You have been dull to-day—that I do not wonder at;—but you seem to shun me; surely I have given you no cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear sir, I do not believe you ever wished to infuse pain into the bosom of your Lydia; but our feelings are not always under our own controul:—Truth and justice, though ever to be admired cannot always be
<PB N="34" REF="031790_0038_0FEE638F22EC9CE0"/>
obeyed without a sigh; and when a sacrifice is made to their virtues, surely that may be allowed to the disappointment of a fond in∣clination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a good philosopher, Lydia: —But, perhaps, I have it in my power to make you forget your uneasiness; nay more, I think my company not only can alleviate the distresses of your mind, but raise it to rapture —joy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think not, sir:—Time, indeed, may efface the bitterness of my distress; but surely no power on earth could, at present, induce me to be joyful.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear father, this may be the result of his passion for me, rather than the cool dictates of reason; he may repent his con∣descension after marriage, and render me mi∣serable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[warmly]</STAGE>
Condescension?—What condescension?—To despise vice?—Is that a condescension?—If so, I wish all the world
<PB N="35" REF="031790_0039_0FEE640807CDBDE0"/>
possessed so valuable a qualification:— And as to his making you miserable, leave that concern to me;—he dares not do it, if he were so inclined; he should find, old as I am, that I could protect my daughter from in∣sult:—
<STAGE>[recovering]</STAGE>
But come, come, I be∣lieve he means well, if I can judge by what he has written:—You shall hear—
<STAGE>[reads]</STAGE>
'Dear sir, when I last parted from you, I was over∣whelmed with grief and disappointment, I could not imagine my father so unworthy as you represented him:—Some circumstances, added to his own confession, have opened my eyes to his true character; and although, as a son, I cannot but grieve for his vices, yet duty to myself obliges me no longer to res∣pect him as the author of my being; consider∣ing as I do, that he had better not have been so, than afterwards to wish me, to despise all duties, sacred and moral, for the gratification of ambition and avarice. I shall wait upon you this afternoon, and reassure you, that, with the greatest pleasure, I accept your pro∣posals, with the hand of your most lovely and amiable daughter; in the mean time, I remain your devoted, Charles Screwpenny.'—Now, Lydia, what do you think?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think! My dear sir, I am now convinced, and I am sure I can depend upon his sentiments and honor:—The man who can despise vice even in a father, must, in himself, be really good.</P>

<PB N="36" REF="031790_0040_0FEE640997187DA8"/>
<SPEAKER>Major.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think with you, Lydia, and feel no doubt of his virtue:—'Tis virtue alone, which raises man to the esteem of his Creator; 'tis not the words of devotion, but the acti∣ons of philanthrophy and justice, that must recommend him to that beneficent being, who delights to make happy, those to whom he has given existence.</P>

<P>My dear sir; no doubt you have re∣ceived my letter; I am now come to prove the truth of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have received your letter, and only hope that conscious worth indited it;— 'tis a hard task for a young man to discard his father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, sir, I see you yet suspect my principles; but, believe me, whatever regret I may feel for the frailty of the author of my
<PB N="37" REF="031790_0041_0FEE640B22110220"/>
being, yet justice and reason actuate my mind, devoid of selfish principles:—Had I believed my father virtuous, or even foolishly fantasti∣cal, I would not have patiently heard his name traduced; but his words and actions have con∣vinced me, that any connexion with him must destroy not only my public character, but rack my private happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am convinced:—Come, young man, no longer Screwpenny, but Charles Up∣right, I here give you my daughter;—come, Lydia, you shall not change your name; the family of the Uprights are so few, that the more they extend themselves the better it will be for the human species. Here I join your hands, and may heaven look down upon your union with a smile,—

take a claim on the body and heart of your servant, James O'Connor; now, your honor, if you will let us marry, to be sure it will please us both, and we'll remain your honor's faith∣ful redemptioners, 'till we can do better— Wont we, Katy?</P>

<P>I understand you, and if you think you can be happy, I will not prevent you;— do well;—and if you serve out your times faithfully, I will, at the conclusion, give you a little farm, where, by industry, you may succeed to render yourselves respectable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>James.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I truly thank your honor; and I am determined we will deserve your kindness.—Why?—Because your honor knows poor people are flesh and blood, and must marry, or live badly;—to be sure human nature is human nature, isn't it, Katy?—So give me your hand, my girl,—never fear, lit-James O'Connor shall do you justice; and now you are mine, why, you shall do an odd job for me too, as well as you did for the captain —Won't you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold your tongue, James;—whilst Major Upright hath the power to prevent it, you shall not want:—It gives me sincere sa∣tisfaction to have added one more to the Up∣right family, and as long as honesty is known and cherished by my countrymen, I am sure that the <HI>Man of the Times</HI> will be hated and despised, and <HI>virtue</HI> be ever crowned with success.
