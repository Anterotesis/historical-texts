<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Writer of the following Dramatic Representa∣tation, imagines that no apology will be necessary for it's publication: The transactions referred to, were singular and important, and deserve to be known and at∣tended to, by every friend to his country, throughout the United States; for whether it is believed or not, yet it is an indubitable truth, that that State or Kingdom is ap∣proaching, with a rapid step, to its final dissolution, wherein such execrable villainies are connived at, and such eminent patriotism disapproved of, as are displayed in the following pages.</P>
<P>It is expected that the Performance will be considered as a true and impartial history of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and not as a work of fancy: The Writer chose this dress, as it suited his in∣tention of representing things after the real life, better than any other; and the materials he was furnished with, being principally depositions given under oath, were more easily digested into it verbatim; and he can assure the world, that from this, and other sources equally certain, he obtained such a clear and positive knowledge of the whole affair, that he thinks he can safely vouch for the truth and justness of every material circumstance in the portrait; and that he can, under proper advantages, bring satisfactory proof for their support: He therefore claims no merit, nor demerit, further than the bare collation, and hopes to be secured from any severe reflections of the critical reader, upon the language, the characters or the drama. That every inhabitant of the United States may always for the future, receive his just deserts, and occa∣sion no more be given, for complaints of a similar kind, is the sincere wish of</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE, To be Spoken by Mr. FRANKLY.</HEAD>
<L>TO shew the vile intentions of the mind;</L>
<L>To paint the real vices of mankind;</L>
<L>To drag out crimes conceal'd in shades of nigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>To fetch the lurking mischief to the light;</L>
<L>To shew th' effects of ev'ry baleful ill,</L>
<L>By black examples drawn with won'drous skill:</L>
<L>For this, the Drama first adorn'd the stage,</L>
<L>Checking the progress of a vicious age;</L>
<L>Here see, our crimes and follies, all portray'd,</L>
<L>The road to virtue, joy, and bliss display'd▪</L>
<L>This, proves the wisdom of the heav'nly plan;</L>
<L>That, the perverseness in the heart of man:</L>
<L>But here our author far exceeds the rest,</L>
<L>He dwelt unnoticed in the villian's breast,</L>
<L>There saw how treason from th' infernal seed,</L>
<L>Sprung forth, increas'd, and ripen'd for the deed;</L>
<L>While Satan, pouring in th' invenom'd gall,</L>
<L>Conducted, guided, and assisted all.</L>
<L>Far distant since, before the world began,</L>
<L>Or ever being claim'd a kindred Man,</L>
<L>Within the blest abodes of heaven above,</L>
<L>Th' empyreal regions of eternal love;</L>
<L>Satan, that first old vile arch traitor, fell,</L>
<L>And drew with him his Myriads to rebel:</L>
<L>The great Supreme, in vengeance, quick prepar'd,</L>
<L>A fi'ry prison;—treason's just reward:</L>
<L>And thunders rolling from th' Almighty's throne,</L>
<L>To hell's dark centre, drove the traitors down:</L>
<L>So Judas too, when he his Lord betray'd,</L>
<L>Was sent to his own place, by Justice made;</L>
<L>There, join'd by kindred souls, with sim'lar guilt,</L>
<L>Feel weighty vengeance for the blood they've spilt.</L>
<L>Thus Heav'n and Earth were freed, the traitors now,</L>
<L>Were all imprison'd in the shades below,</L>
<L>No more to vex the realms of joy and peace,</L>
<L>With war, sedition, slaughter, and distress.</L>
<L>But see and wonder, that our happy Land,</L>
<L>Where freedom arms a patriotic band.</L>
<L><PB REF="017918_0005_0FA37B9342DE67D0"/>Where mild and equal Laws, by wisdom giv'n,</L>
<L>Form a most fair epitome of Heav'n;</L>
<L>Should be defac'd by treason's noxious breath;</L>
<L>Should, in it's bosom, keep and cherish death,</L>
<L>Transgress the first great Law; make nature groan;</L>
<L>And rob Newgate, and Satan, of their own.</L>
<L>Ye sons of freedom, rouse! avert your shame!</L>
<L>Pursue the glories of your dawning fame!</L>
<L>Distinguish well your friends, from artful foes!</L>
<L>These you'll reject, but honor pay to those:</L>
<L>Establish firm, the Fabric you've begun,</L>
<L>To last, and shine, as long as yonder sun,</L>
<L>Nor sooner fall, than when the King of Kings,</L>
<L>Brings to a final close, all earthly things.</L>

<STAGE><HI>SCENE opens, and discovers</HI> Frankly <HI>sitting solus, in a musing posture: After some time he speaks;</HI></STAGE>
<P>WELL! since it is so, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must acquiesce, and trust in Heaven for relief in Heaven, who is witness of all those vile transactions.—Internal Enemies, without number plotting the ruin of their Country;—their native County; which has given them being, subsistance and pro∣tection:—This is treason of the blackest dye!—It is real∣ly melancholy to reflect on our present dangers, more especially since there is so little probability, that we shall ever be extricated from them!—It seems that we are desti∣tute of Men of principle and stability:—Men, that in de∣fiance of every hazard and difficulty, dare boldly engage in an attempt to support the Laws, and to scourge those impudent offenders, who have so long transgressed with impunity.—This most scandalous illicit trade!—The gau∣dy glare of <HI>British</HI> finery, has allured the People into a fatal torpor and security:—They foolishly imagine, that those insignificant fripperies of <HI>English</HI> voluptuousness, will amply compensate the loss of every civil and religious privilege;—or rather, they reflect not at all, else they would shudder at the Idea of bartering their wealth, their liberty, their honor, their conscience, and their Country,
<PB N="8" REF="017918_0007_0FA37B94C12A2050"/>
for those cob-web vanities, the furniture of idleness and luxury:—<HI>Britain</HI> never hit upon such a promising prospect for obtaining their point as this nefarious commerce;— deceit and treachery have been ineffectual;—insidious proposals for an accommodation have proved abortive;— the enchanting glitter of their darling gold, lost it's be∣witching power, and produced no effect;—sire and sword, with all their attendant horrors, served no other purpose, but to exhibit to the admiring World, the patriotic virtue of <HI>America</HI>'s Sons:—The <HI>British</HI> Court were sensible that the reduction of this Country, could not be effected, unless the morals of it's inhabitants were first destroyed, and their principles debased, by the introduction of luxury and dissipation among them, from whence effeminacy, and an unfitness for the field might proceed:—The desired point is already nearly obtained:—And can nothing be done to prevent it's completion?—I fear nothing to ef∣fect.—There is such an inconsistency in the conduct of mankind!—Such a wavering in sentiments and actions! —Such a predominancy of self, that many of the most noi∣sy Patriots, are either Whigs or Tories, as the circumstances of the times suit themselves, or their particular connecti∣ons!—There is no dependence upon any one:—It is im∣possible to know who can be trusted and confided in:— He, therefore, that undertakes for his country at this juncture, must do it alone and unsupported;—he must expect to sacrifice ease, health, interest, character, and perhaps life; in the unequal struggle, and in the end will have no other consolation, but the approbation of his own conscience:—But I am resolved to make the experiment, to make one adventurous effort, for the relief of my Coun∣try, let the event be fortunate or adverse;—at the worst, I shall have the consolation to reflect, that I had tried; and that every event which may succeed, must be consi∣dered as fatalities, which I could neither avoid nor pre∣vent:—It is more eligible, to perish in an arduous strug∣gle for Liberty, than to be quiet and passive, 'till my Country is overthrown.
<STAGE>A short pause.</STAGE></P>
<P>I expect one or two Gentlemen here to night, to con∣sult on the subject:—I think they are faithful and such
<PB N="9" REF="017918_0008_0FA37B95839FB430"/>
as I can rely on:—But yet, upon recollection, I'll not trust them;—I'll trust no man living with any secret of importance:—I've been deceived so often, that it can be repeated no more:—I'll converse with them, hear their opinions, and then act agreeable to my own:—But—</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Fearless <HI>and</HI> Standwell.</STAGE>
<P>Gentlemen, you never were more welco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to me, than at this time:—Pray take seats, and let us have a confi∣dential review of the present state of our affairs.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is the design of our visit, and I dare say it will be very agreeable to all present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must be acknowledged, that the necessity of our meeting, is a very humiliating Idea;—that the Autho∣rity of the State, should be so destitute of power and effi∣ciency, that three private persons, in an obscure corner, should be called upon, by the urgency of affairs, to take the regulation of a great Empire into their hands:—But so it is, my friends, and let us discharge the important trust, with faithfulness to ourselves, and Country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stand.</SPEAKER>
<P>We shall all, Mr. <HI>Frankly,</HI> have reason to thank you, for proposing this interview, and making the first move for this consultation:—There is a strange supine∣ness, a surprising inattention, among all ranks of People, to the glorious cause, which at first animated them, with such a noble emulation, and distinguished them from the ordinary race of Patriots.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my friend, they have so far lost their first spirit, that instead of relieving their Country in it's present danger, I fear that an attempt for that purpose, would meet with a universal disapprobation, and be called a dis∣turbing of the public peace: But this, instead of frighten∣ing us from our pursuit, ought to be one of the most power∣ful motives, to engage us therein, with the greater resolu∣tion and ardour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stand.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir, the fewer our friends, the more ne∣cessity for our gallant and spirited exertions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope we shall never be deterred from the exe∣cution of our duty, by such a Bugbear as popular cla∣mour:
<PB N="10" REF="017918_0009_0FA37B9643FCA528"/>
—What! when our Country is on the verge of de∣struction, and just ready to tumble from the horrid preci∣pice; shall we, careless and supine, sit still, with folded hands, and not extend a finger to it's relief; because, for∣sooth, we are afraid that somebody or other, will insult, or laugh at us for it?—the bare Idea is disgraceful to hu∣manity:—I despise the dastardly soul, who could be ca∣pable of such meanness?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>And even here, my friends, great wisdom and prudence is necessary:—We must defeat the plots of our foes, without displeasing our friends, when it can possibly be avoided; for this will hurt the cause, we are endea∣vouring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o support.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing can be more just than this:—Great discretion must be used, lest by an ill placed zeal, and an imprudent ardour, we defeat our own purposes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>I readily grant, it will be of importance, to shew a proper regard, and deference, to our real friends; yet let no man be terrified, for fear our measures should not please them, so well as we could wish;—I have always been a Bigot to the public voice; but in this State, where is the importance of it?—When we have named a few, a very few, faithful friends, we have done; Tories, Tra∣ders, and the whole herd of timorous half toryfied Whigs, are worth not the least notice:—I still assert, that if we are to be so happy, as to adopt a plan against the illicit trade, the man that hesitates, and fails to execute his part, through fear that his character might suffer, deserves to have his name branded with eternal infamy, and sink in∣to endless oblivion and obscurity, never to see the light any more, unless it be to go</P>
<L>"Black'ning downward on the lapse of time,</L>
<L>"The equal object of eternal shame."</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stand.</SPEAKER>
<P>My friend's zeal and spirit pleases me:—The mode of conduct, which we may resolve upon, must cer∣tainly be carried into execution, in defiance of every op∣position:—But while we determine to act with the great∣est decision and spirit, we must remember to deliberate with the utmost caution and circumspection.</P>

<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us attend to the object of our meeting:— Let us open our minds with the greatest freedom:—I am impatient to know the result of our councils.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is really time to enter upon the business in hand:—Our introductory conversation has been suffici∣ently lengthy.—Mr. <HI>Frankly,</HI> we are all attention to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Britain</HI> having waged a cruel and unnatural war against us, which, in the utmost malice of her evil genius, she has been carrying on, for almost six years, with all her force:—Fire and sword, bribery and seducti∣on are among the weapons, that she has employed against us:—But finding that these proved ineffectual, to subju∣gate a brave and determined People, she now has recourse to artifice, hoping to effect by this, what her arms and gold, were unable to do.—General <HI>Robertson</HI> of <HI>New-York,</HI> has given a general invitation, to all the inhabitants of these States, to come thither and trade:—Nothing could be more pleasing to the Tories, and those of the Whigs, who were willing to sell their Country, as <HI>Judas</HI> did his Saviour, for hard money:—They have accepted the fatal invitation, and the illicit trade, through their hands, is briskly carried on, and rapidly increases every day.—This ruinous and destructive commerce, spills the vital blood of the Country, by stripping it of it's two most important articles, cash and provisions; while the wants of the enemy, are thereby immediately supplied:—But this is not the worst of it; those goods which are intro∣duced into the Country, in this way, are more destructive than Stygian poison;—dressed out in a sumptuous garb, we forget the great concerns of our Country, and sink into a state of langour and security, more fatal to the bo∣dy politic, than a Lethargy is to the human:—Add to this, the breach of saith to our generous Ally, who might, with Justice, be offended at such an illiberal return, for his unaffected generosity:—This, Gentlemen, is our situ∣ation!—These are the evils, under which we labour, and which demand our attention, and a spirited application of the proper remedies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gentlemen, the subject demands frankness;— our sentiments must not be disguised:—It appears, that a
<PB N="12" REF="017918_0011_0FA37B97D7792BA8"/>
number of the meanest, and vilest of those, whom <HI>Satan</HI> claims as his own, are now gaining the highest pitch of affluence, in the plunder of their Country;—directed and assisted by all the subtilties of their Master, they have hi∣therto proceeded with impunity, in defiance of every ef∣fort to interrupt their career:—Must the vengeance of my Country continue forever to sleep?—Are our disasters arisen to such a pitch, that the torrent of destruction must inevitably overwhelm us?—Must the glorious Fa∣bric, which we have so nobly reared, at the expence of so much blood and treasure, be destroyed to the founda∣tions, by a sett of base mercenary wretches, whom if we should extirpate from the face of the Earth, Humanity it∣self would give a smile of approbation?—No, my friends, it cannot, must not be!—Let us arouse from our supine∣ness, and make those Parricides feel the weight of our animated exertions:—Our Authority, conniving at those execrable doings, I doubt, will afford us no aid, nor sup∣port;—let us then proceed, without their knowledge or approbation, and with the resolution of Patriots, strike a blow, that may astonish the world:—Let us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m our∣selves and our trusty friends, and proceed without delay, to the cursed repositories, of forbidden luxury, and there, by an unusual and unexpected manoevre, commit to the flames, every remnant of those treacherous allurements:— This will be acting to purpose;—this will give a fatal check to those detestable practices:—Many will join and assist us;—more will approve of the design, and give us their best wishes;—and none will condemn it, but those that are interested, whose objections our Muskets will readily answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>I approve of your zeal, my friend, but not of your proposal:—The whole cause, and reason of those practices, which we complain of, is want of efficiency in our Laws; and their execution, would de attended with the accomplishment of all our desires:—What hinders our putting them in force?—They actually exist, with heir full Authority, and we are at perfect liberty to use them; and while this is the case, I fear it would be rash, and imprudent to act without them, in a matter of such
<PB N="13" REF="017918_0012_0FA37B98827EBF88"/>
consequence:—I would wish to do nothing inconsider∣ately, nothing that might appear rash and hasty, or that might give umbrage to our friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stand.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am much pleased with what you offer, Mr. <HI>Frankly,</HI>—you have convinced me, that a project, which lay in my mind, would be improper to adopt: I had pro∣posed, in Idea, to seize all suspected Persons, goods, and provisions, and retain them secure, 'till a legal trial could be ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ained:—But now I see, that if the Law will not support, and the Authority assist us, our efforts will be vain and futile, and instead of profiting the Country, will bring shame, and disgrace upon ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not urge the proposal, Gentlemen, but ac∣quiesce in your Judgment:—Yet I must confess, that I have a poor opinion of the Laws, if they are to be execu∣ted, by the present Authority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stand.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Laws of this State, I believe, Gentlemen, are sufficient, if duly executed, to remedy every evil we labour under▪—But, as Mr. <HI>Frankly</HI> has observed, they are not put in force;—they lie dormant and useless;—not the least respect is paid them;—and the hardy villain, continues in the open practice, of every enormity, fearless of punishment, and in defiance of the hand of Justice:— An undisturbed course of Law, would make the guilty culprits tremble:—To the attainment of this end, let a number of resolute citizens, associate together, under the strictest bonds of fidelity;—let them take those neglected Laws in their hands, and see them executed, with a for∣titude that no difficulties can dismay:—if they can be united in council, and vigilant, and decisive in conduct, we have every thing to hope, from such an attempt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear your proposal, Mr. <HI>Standwell,</HI> though a good one, is impracticable:—The objection again recurs, what can be done without the concurrence of the Autho∣rity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stand.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the Authority do not readily assist us, we will oblige them;—they dare not refuse their concurrence, when we have the Laws in our hands;—if they dare,— let infamy be their portion!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="017918_0013_0FA37B994129A738"/>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>But where shall we find a sufficient number of Men to join us;—Men possessed of fidelity secresy and inflexible constancy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stand.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will not be a little disgraceful to the Whigs, if they should be found, on tryal, to be more deficient in the practice of those virtues, than the faithless and un∣principled Tories:—However abandoned they may be, they can't be accused of betraying one another, divulging secrets of importance, or deserting their cause; for they are as true, and as persevering in their plans, as the Devils are in wickedness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt they will fail you, if you depend upon them, for great numbers of the pretended Whigs, are To∣ries in disguise, and the most numerous part of the rest, are neither Whigs, nor Tories from principle; but either, just as suits their passions, or interests.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though your representation, be just, as I fear it is, yet I am confident, that as many as one faithful and trusty Man, can be found in each parish, throughout the coast, who will be ready, and willing to engage in the af∣fair; and such a number, I believe, will be sufficient for the purpose:—let these be selected, and instructed in their several parts, and I do not doubt but we shall effectu∣ally succeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your plan is a good one,—I have no objections against it; yet, I fear, you are a little too sanguine in your expectations, of it's answering the desired purpose:— Suppose the Magistrates assist you, and you find a suffici∣ent number of true Men;—What will be the consequence of a general seizure?—You may be assured, that the Traders keep but a trifle on hand;—no sooner is a cargo landed, but it is put into fifty hands, and distributed through every part of the Country:—It would therefore, puzzle a Conjuror, to discover enough to pay the expence of seizure;—and if we once give the alarm, they will immediately adopt new measures, which may elude all future enquiries:—We shall therefore, defeat our own intentions if we don't strike the first blow, at the root.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you don't approve of the execution of the Laws, and the seizing of illicit goods?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="017918_0014_0FA37B9A8B000E28"/>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do;—I think it a necessary step; but at the same time, I think that this alone is not sufficient:—I say, that the Ax must be laid to the root of the tree:—The Guards on the Coast, must be enlarged, and regulated on a better establishment:—The civil Law must be support∣ed by the Martial, and Justice administered with more decision and dispatch; else our puny efforts will be suc∣ceeded by insults, more intollerable than death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am happy, my friend, to find that your sen∣timents exactly coincide with mine:—Something more must be done, than barely seizing a few articles of illicit goods, if we mean to rescue our Country, from the ra∣venous Jaws of those Harpies:—But won't it be difficult for us to effect those important matters?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, Sir:—We are of more importance, in the political scale, than perhaps you imagine;—by a plan concerted with wisdom, and executed with prudence and spirit, a few obscure persons may produce unthought of revolutions in a State:—This is sufficiently manifested, by those destructives plots, and machinations of the To∣ries, which we are met on purpose to counterplot and de∣feat:—Let us only be as wise and active for our own safety, as they be for our destruction, and all will be se∣cure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>We should be glad, Sir, to be made acquainted with the particular mode, you would wish to adopt, for the accomplishment of those desirable ends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let each of us exert the whole of our influence with our friends, both by writing and conversation:—Let us urge upon them, the exigency of our affairs, and the necessity of a speedy remedy;—let us not leave them, 'till an enumeration of facts, supported by the most co∣gent arguments, shall oblige them to be of our opinion:— Thus in a short time, the popular voice will be on our side, which the Assembly will hardly fail to notice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>By making our designs in this manner public, we give our Enemies every opportunity to oppose and defeat them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's no objection against the measure:— when I am going to hang a Man, I chuse to inform him of it, that he may prepare for his sate.</P>

<P>We will act more secretly then:—Let us inform, in a confidential manner, those Members of the Council, and Assembly, with whom we are acquainted, of our eminent dangers, and of the only means which can afford relief:—A few friends can be desired to support us:—A matter which equally concerns them, will be listened to with attention:—A number of General officers in the Army, might also be made acquainted with our distress;— they would do us most important service, both at Con∣gress and Assembly:—it might likewise, be a mean of procuring a detachment from the continental Line, to be sent into our neighbourhood, which is a circumstance that I judge to be of the utmost consequence.</P>

<P>Gentlemen, I am perfectly pleased with all parts of this last proposal;—I have listened to it, with the utmost attention, and satisfaction, and must beg leave to observe, that I had formed the out lines of the same plan, before this meeting, and had communicated it to one of the first Men in the State, who highly approved of it, and assured me of his support and assistance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no doubt of it's success, if we are not defi∣cient on our part;—the utmost vigilance is required.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you nothing further to suggest, that would be advantageous to our main design?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, Sir;—I believe the two plans which have been mentioned, are the only ones we can adopt, since my first proposal is discarded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall continue to object against that, 'till all others have been tried; but if every legal method fails, I shall be willing to have recourse to that in the last resort; for having begun, I shall not desist, 'till my Country is safe, or 'till I am frustrated of so desirable a good, by the failure of every possible remedy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Having determined upon the plans, let us be agreed as to their execution:—Mr. <HI>Fearless</HI> has given us sufficient instruction, concerning his own proposal, it on∣ly remains, that we take Mr. <HI>Frankly</HI>'s directions con∣cerning the other;—I suppose him to be much better ac∣acquainted
<PB N="17" REF="017918_0016_0FA37B9B82777C28"/>

<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt he is;—his industry and oppor∣tunities have greatly exceeded ours:—Mr. <HI>Frankly,</HI> we shall receive your commands with pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will be necessary, that you continue to make the most deligent and exact enquiry, into the state of the illicit trade;—by whom it is regulated and conducted;— at what times, and places the goods are landed from the Island; where, and in what manner they are secreted;— you must discover their private repositories;—the time, and manner of their conveyance from place to place;— what the chief remittances to the Island are, with every other circumstance that concerns the business:—To ef∣fect this, we must inviolably keep our own counsel;— our bosoms must be as impenetrable as the grave;—no∣thing must transpire as we regard the salvation of our Country;—and after we have obtained the necessary in∣formation, we must make a general seizure of all <HI>British</HI> goods, as near as may be, at the same hour, that the great∣est possible blow, may be struck at once; because, as has been already observed, as soon as they are alarmed, they will immediately change their measures; the detection of which, will be then more difficult than they be now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>We shall comply with all your requisitions, with the utmost readiness, and have only to desire you to ap∣point the time of seizure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I may be better able to observe, and chuse that, which will be the most proper, you will communi∣cate to me, from time to time, all intelligence of impor∣tance, which you may obtain.</P>

<P>We shall take every opportunity to answer your desires;—our discoveries will be always at your service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have likewise to observe, that I may probably stand in need of your assistance, at particular times, to convey intelligence to confidential friends, at a distance; and perhaps for some other purposes, not proper to name.</P>

<P>I WISH, You, you'd contrive some scheme to get rid of this plaguy state money;— it's falling all the while, and will be good for nothing bimeby: We shall certainly be ruin'd, You, and come to the town;—I'd g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t off such rotten stuff some way or rother, if I got nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or't, You.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dont be feart, Wife, afore you're hurt:—We shall do well enough, never fear: I shan't keep no more on't than I owe the collector for rates; and I shall keep it from him, as long as I can, to be sure:—and I wish'twou'd n't be good for nothing when he gets it;—for my part, I won't take no more on't, under four for one; —it will be ten for one afore I pay the collector;—and so much we gain clear, Wife, d'y' see, besides helping to kill the money, and, when the Country's conquer'd, and the times settled, I'll tell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> King, all I've done, and then he'll give me the best Rebel farm in the parish;— don't you think so, Wife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>There may be something in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, You;— but won't the collector make you, make up the sinkings; —I'm sure I've heard such a thing talkt on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't fear, Wife; they may perhaps ha' men∣tioned such a thing,—but they han't done it yet, as I've heard on, and they won't I don't think; for sometimes the Rebels an't always the cunningest, to find out the best plans for themselves, and when they have, they durst n't execute 'em, for fear the People will rise, and oppose'em; —as I guess wou'd be the case, in this case; for all the Loyals wou'd oppose it certainly, and I can tell you, Wife, for your comfort, that Squire <HI>Slipcoat</HI> told me t'other day, we were the strongest party hereabouts: But if they do their worst, I can e'en pay the collector when he calls, and so I shall lose nothing that way neither.</P>

<PB N="20" REF="017918_0019_0FA37B9E2CB1ECD0"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why yes you will, You, you'll lose the farm you talkt on, if you don't help to spoil the money, or hurt the Country some other way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wife, don't you be concern'd;—I do do a good deal slily;—'tan't but a few days ago, I gin <HI>Tom Ketchum,</HI> two hard dollars, to go to the Island to bring off counter∣feit money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I never heard o'that afore, You; I wonder you did n't tell me on't;—that was a good thing in you, You;—keep adoing so, and we shall have a farm, as sure as a Gun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I've done a great deal more than that, Wife; —three years ago, I laid in with a dozen young fellows, to go and join the Regulars, and I gin 'em a hard dollar apiece, for bounty; and I s'pose my name was sent to the King for't;—he's heard all about me afore now, I'll warrant ye, Wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, You, I'm glad on't with all my heart;—I use to be afraid, you was so softly a Man, you wou'd n't do nothing, and when the Reg'lars come, I al∣ways tho't they'd take you for a Whig, and send you to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and cumfristricate your farm, for you;— but I see you do do something, and I wish you'd do ten times as much again; I want to have you git three or four, or six or seven, or a dozen farms;—'twou'd n't be too much for us, You.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know that as well as you do, Wife;—but you don't consider the times are crooked as the Devil;—if one don't mind his hits, he'll get snubb'd as quick as you'd say <HI>Jack Robbinson</HI>;—I'd better be call'd a half Whig, whilst the times last, if I do lose a little by it; than to be hang'd for a Tory, and so lose all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>But ay, if I was a Man, I wou'd n't mind that, I'd warrant ye;—it's just as I told you, you're afraid on 'em, and durst n't stir, and do nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>No I an't, Wife, that an't the thing; I say 'tis better for the King, and me too, to keep doing a little for him a great while, than to get s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apt up by, trying to do more.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="21" REF="017918_0020_0FA37BA2B2D67720"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes▪ but I know you could do more, and be safe too, if you wan't afraid:—What'll you do when you're drafted one of these days;—I look for't every day when it'll come,—and if you should go, or hire a Man, 'twill be all up with you, if the King should hear on't; then where's all your farms, You?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I've got a plan for that too;—when cousin <HI>Jo</HI> was at our house t'other night from the Island, I sent word to son <HI>Billy,</HI> that I was going to clamming next <HI>Monday,</HI> and he must come over in a Boat, or send some∣body, and take me, and carry me to the Island, then they'd parole me, and send me home, and then you see, I shan't be drafted no more, for they don't draft pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'ners.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why railly, You, I believe that's a good plan;—I shou'd n't ha'tho't o'that:—I begin to think you do do something;—but I wish you'd do a great deal more, you cou'd I know if you wan't scart to death;—if you'd only take two or three of the leading Men in the Parish, and send 'em to the Island, the danger'd be over then, and we cou'd do what we pleas'd;—besides, such a thing'd be worth telling on;—you'd be call'd a bold Man amongst 'em, and one that fear'd nothing;—you'd stand a chance to be sent for to the Island, and made a serjeant on, be∣cause you'd got courage, they'd say;—if I only wore breeches, I'd see the Rebels all shot, afore I'd bear what you do, I'd warrant 'em;—all the money we can rap and rend, goes to pay rates, so that we are so poor, we can't do nothing, if we'd never so good a mind to:—As true as I live, and breathe, I'd send to <HI>Clinton</HI> and get a Regi∣ment of Reg'lars, to come here, and then the day'd be our own;—'twould be their turn to be hang'd, and go to Newgate;—that wou'd be something like a tanzy;—we shou'd live like folks then;—every body knows, that we can't never take no comfort, as long as them devilish Rebels an't hang'd, and nothing cou'd ever make me feel better, than to see them villains, with iron russles on, ago∣ing to Newgate, or the Gallows;—I'd have them to know if I cou'd have my will, I'd neither eat nor drink, 'till'twas done.</P>

that I and Father, don't know what we're about?—it don't signify, Mother, for you always to be finding fault with our plans, and telling what you'd do;—I tell you what, if you'd your will only three days, we shou'd all swing fort:—You don't know nothing about it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Wife, the King loves Justice, as well as mercy, as the poor wretches, who are fighting against him, will soon find to their sorrow;—they little think

<P>Yes, You, that will be something like a voice in shame, when they're all dying in a heap, and no notice taken on't;—yet as'ral all, I shou'd be a'most tempted to pity 'em, if they had n't us'd us so bad, and bro't it all upon themselves;—and more than all that, when the Rebels are all kill'd and cut to pieces, our trou∣bles will all be over and gone, and that'll be a joyful day to us:—<HI>Betty,</HI> you'd better draw some cyder;—let's drink, and be merry a little afore Mr. <HI>Frankly</HI> comes, for I guess he'll be here pretty soon, and spoil all our sun.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing of that, Sir;—we have trapped him once already, and having learned how it's done, we can do it again more easily;—so that if he comes, he will only march through the Country under guard again:— but they say also, that <HI>Greene</HI> has intirely defeated <HI>Corn∣wallis</HI>;—killed two thirds of his army, and made the rest prisoners;—of course the southern States, are once more freed, from the rapine of <HI>British</HI> tyranny.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>FASTEN all the doors in a minute, <HI>John,</HI> and let's have all the lights put out.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>John <HI>fastens the doors, and</HI> Gibber <HI>puts out the candles.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> how will the Loyals get in, now the doors are all lockt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>They must be help<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in at the back window, <HI>John</HI>; —you know it won't be safe for us to have the doors on the latch;—we shou'd be in danger every minute of being ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cht.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you don't mean to trust to the doors being lockt, I hope,—they can be broke down at a jerk, and then I wou'dn't give that
<STAGE>(<HI>Snapping his fingers</HI>)</STAGE>
for your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, <HI>John,</HI> we are better soldiers than that comes to;—here's a string, which I shall tie to my finger, and it goes down through a hole in the floor, and out at the backside of the house into the garden, where you mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t lye hid, and give notice of any body's coming, by pulling the string.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a good contrivance for your old pate;— I wonder who told you on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leave off being saucy, or I'll lather your hide well, you blockhead:—go and call the <HI>Spy</HI> this minute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>He needn't be disturbed yet;—nobody an't come;—and he, and our <HI>Betty</HI> want to lye together, all the time they can get.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I want to talk with him a little afore the rest come;—so go along I say.
<STAGE><HI>Exit.</HI> John.</STAGE></P>
<STAGE>Gibber <HI>solus.</HI></STAGE>
<P>I'm much mistaken, if we don't contrive some plan to night, to be reveng'd on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se devilish Rebels, that have had their heads so long, and have abus'd me so much,
<PB N="36" REF="017918_0035_0FA37BACC849E708"/>
and I cou'dn't help it;—Nobody knows, and never will know, how much I've undergone for my King;—but I trust a day of relief is at hand, when I shall receive full pay, for all I've suffered from 'em:—I'm a tenderhearted Man, and don't love to see my Neighbours in distress;— but I shan't pity 'em <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow, it is the fruit of their own do∣ings:—I shou'd be afraid they'd kill me, if I shou'd go and set their houses afire; but it wou'd do my soul good, to see 'em in flames, and they, poor wretches, in 'em.
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> John and <HI>Spy.</HI></STAGE>
Take your station, <HI>John,</HI> in the currant bushes, at the cor∣ner of the Garden, and if any body's a coming pull the string;—mind, and keep yourself hid.
<STAGE><HI>Exit.</HI> John.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's two o'clock devilish quick, Mr. <HI>Gibber</HI>;— it seems to me, 'tan't ten minutes, since <HI>Betty</HI> and I went to bed:—But what did you call me up for?—There's no∣body come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wanted to talk with you a little, about some things, first:—So I call'd you up afore the time a little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's pretty indeed;—I wish you'd been further off;—you've disturbed us in the midst of our sun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, I tho't you'd been a better Loyal, than not to be willing to deny yourself a few minutes pleasure, for the sake of promoting the good of the cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! I'll say no more about it then;—let us proceed on business:—Our situation is dangerous;—our time short;—our business important;—we must be vi∣gilent, and expeditious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wanted to know, before our friends come, what they say in <HI>New-York</HI> about the cause;—you know there, ten times as well as we do here, how things are like to go in the end:—Do they think they can ever subdue the Rebels?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not, Sir, the business I was sent upon, to tell you what they can do there; but to tell you what you can, and must do here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>No but if they can't do nothing there, we can't do nothing here:—If we shou'd only attempt such a
<PB N="37" REF="017918_0036_0FA37BAD81E104A0"/>
thing, without we cou'd be supported, we shou'd all be hung before we'd begun, and there'd be an end on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>There will be very little danger of being hung, for doing what is proposed;—you can't suppose we de∣sire to endanger your lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I s'pose you don't mean to;—but how can we do any thing without?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you know the Rebels have stopt the smug∣gling trade;—our first business will be to set that agoing again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well that's proper enough to be done:—but what else have you got for us to do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must hit upon some plan for the Loyalists in the Country, to assist the Associators when they come over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, that'll be a dangerous scheme I'll war∣rant ye▪—I wou'dn't give a copper for any Man's head that lifted a finger in that plan:—you're be conjur'd to set such a thing on foot among us;—we're all dead men if you don't withdraw that motion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're a man of fine courage upon my word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Sir, take care of yourself,—somebody's coming.

<P>What business have you to disturb me so late in the night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Arise, friend <HI>Gibber,</HI> arise and let me in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Arise, friend, arise; ay, that's the countersign; —'tis the Reverend Mr. <HI>Plunket</HI>'s voice;—they are the true Loyals, who were to meet here to night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Mr. <HI>Gibber,</HI> no delay.</P>
</SP>

<P>Stay a bit, Mr. <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bber,</HI> an't you mistaken a little? —If you an't you've got a good pair of owls eyes of your own, to see so well in the dark.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter, Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tlemen, for that small mistake;— a slip of the tongue don't always break the neck;—I'm as sorry as any body that we're oblig'd to sit in the dark: Can't you find chairs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fid.</SPEAKER>
<P>We shou'd pass very well for conjurors if we cou'd, when I don't believe it was ever darker in <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here, Gentlemen, sit down, and let's proceed on business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, with all expedition;—it's very uncomforta∣ble to sit here in the cold and dark, and the fear of being trapan'd makes my blood run cold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>My friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, we must bear up under every thing that befals us, with Christian fortitude, and constancy; and generously expose ourselves to every danger, in the execution of this charitable business; and if we fail of an adequate reward in this world, we may rest assur'd, we shall not in the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xt.</P>

<P>But my thinks, Sir, if I was sure of no other pay but what I shall get there, I'd not risk my neck for't, I'd warran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>The justic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of our cause is so conspicuous, that we cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> an ample recompence, even in this world:—The King is on our side, my friends, who will both pay and pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fid.</SPEAKER>
<P>We needn't multiply words about the Justice of our cause;—we're all sati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fied in that point:—And as to pay, I want no other than to see the damn'd Rebels once humbled:—If I cou'd but only see their houses in flames, and they themselves, with b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yonets at their breasts, beg∣ging for mercy 'twou'd make me feel better, than to be King of all the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That I'm afraid is more than can be bro't about at present:—The R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bels are plaguy stubborn fellow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and won't be bro't to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k for mercy, without many a hard blow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, you're a half Whig;—but 'tan't best for you to talk discouragingly; if you do, I'll be in your cho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>

<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be angry, I only tell you the truth, that you may be prepar'd for't;—and I shou'd think, Gentle∣men, that 'tan't best to say much about killing, and burn∣ing 'till we're stronger;—this <HI>Long-Island</HI> trade briskly carried on, does the business fast enough, so that in a little time we may be ready for every thing that can happen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fid.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may be sure, <HI>Flutter</HI> will stand up for the trade;—He gets money so, without fighting for't;—he cares for little else besides his purse; you may always find him, where there's the least fighting, and the most mo∣ney:—I tell you plainly, Gentlemen, I'm not very fond of such fellows;—give me the Man that will fight, and let the money go to the Devil:—I'll lay you a wager, that this same <HI>Flutter,</HI> tho' he's so zealous now, will be a Whig again, as soon as he has well lined his pockets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough on that head, Mr. <HI>Fidfaddy</HI>;—there's no necessity for all f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghting, and Mr. <HI>Flutter</HI> acts his part well:—But let us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Gentleman from <HI>New-York:</HI>—You have undoubtedly, Sir, information of im∣portance to communicate;—and in the first place, what are the politics of the day.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>emen, however disagre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able it may be, yet you may rest a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sur'd, that the <HI>British</HI> have laid aside all tho'ts of subduing this Country by force of arms;—the Rebels are so numerous and warlike, and have such pow∣erful Allies, and plentiful resourses, that 'tis impossible ever to conquer them:—You see the <HI>British</HI> troops are defeated in all parts;—every expedition miscarries;— their arms a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e disgrac'd;—and their power shamefully circumscribed to limits, which are every day growing narrower:—This is the daily topic of conversation of all ranks at <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>You relate such strange things, that it will give my faith a severe tryal to credit it;—What? The migh∣ty <HI>Britain</HI> not subdue the ignorant undisciplined rabble of <HI>America!</HI>—Astonishing! I won't believe a word of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm persuaded, Mr. <HI>Plunket,</HI> the man speaks the truth;—I've known him from a child, and he never was catcht in a lie in all his life;—his story makes my belly ach; but then I must believe him af'ral.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="40" REF="017918_0039_0FA37BAFC358C020"/>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy you may venture to believe me this once,— for I am here by General <HI>Clinton</HI>'s orders, and if I fail to execute them, he'll not fail to execute me:—I shou'd cut a fine figure to return to his Excellency, and tell him I could do no business, because nobody would credit me;—such horrid trifling in affairs of such importance, would entirely spoil the fine character you have there, and wou'd go near to cost me my head, besides breaking up the best plan that ever was laid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must hear him, I believe then;—but if you say any thing, beside the truth, the whole truth, and no∣thing but the truth, you will not only suffer immediate death, but will be eternally damned afterwards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, I never understood before, that Mr. <HI>Plun∣ket</HI> was a civil Magistrate, to administer oaths, and to pronounce sentence of death; and a Pope, to send folks to the Devil; yet as great a novelty as it is, I find it's true:—But leaving this, I return to the point:—I am sensible, Gentlemen, that what I've related has a melan∣choly aspect:—I wish things were otherwise;—but so matters are, and they can't be help'd;—we can only make the best of our situation, by rendering that of our enemies as distressing as possible:—This will be effected in part by plundering as much of their property as we are able, and by destroying the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how can we, under our present circum∣stances, attempt any such thing, with safety to ourselves: —without that support, which you say the King can't afford us, we shou'd soon lose our lives, if we begun to plunder and burn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't fear for your safety, Mr. <HI>Plunket</HI>;—every thing that can possibly happen has been attended to and provided against;—you have parts to act, in the execu∣tion of which, you will be perfectly safe:—to bring de∣vastation and distress upon the Country they can't con∣quer, is now the policy of <HI>Britain;—Arnold</HI> is at the head of the plan, and a good fellow he is;—he'll not stop his sword for the shrieks of the Virgin, nor the cries of the infant;—his malice against the Country is now rais'd to so high a pitch, that were it in his power, he
<PB N="41" REF="017918_0040_0FA37BB0806A2F98"/>
wou'd spread flames and death, from one end of the Con∣tinent to the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>To see him fulfil his warmest desires, would give me the sincerest pleasure;—my heart is intirely with his in this matter;—but how can this be done, without an armed force sufficient to disperse the Rebels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>It cannot be expected, that we shall do all at once; —we must do every thing we can, and leave the rest to Providence:—The first thing to be done, is to circulate as much counterfeit money as possible:—Money, Gen∣tlemen, is the sinews of war;—it is a hinge on which all their movements turn;—and we all know that <HI>America</HI> has none, but are sensible at the same time that their paper currency, has been a substitute for it, and has an∣swered all the purposes of solid coin:—Now to destroy the credit of this, is to baffle them in their only resource.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>The paper money is so sunk already, that I think it lost time to trouble ourselves any further about that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>The credit of it, though low, is not sufficiently gone;—it passes at the exchange as current as silver; and while that is the case, it much embarrasses the conduct∣ing of the illicit trade;—a most important consideration; since the express purpose of the trade is, to drain as much as possible of hard money, and provisions, from the Country; by which their affairs will be embarrassed;— their armies will want supplies;—and their resistance will be feeble:—Now it's evident, that while their cur∣rency has a circulation, the People will insist upon the Merchant's taking it, or they won't trade;—in either way Government will be disappointed in their designs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're right;—all paper money must be spoilt, and nothing will spoil it so well, as putting out so much counterfeit, as will make every body afraid on't all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's the design, Mr. <HI>Gibber,</HI> and you must be the man to receive and distribute it;—you, and your friends, must be indefatigable in conveying it into cir∣culation, as speedily as po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the question is first, how I shall git it?— For I'll be hang'd, if I get kill'd a gitting on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="42" REF="017918_0041_0FA37BB1423CD0A0"/>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's my business, Mr. <HI>Gibber</HI>;—you will receive the money free of trouble and danger;—it will be your part to circulate it, cautiously and faithfully.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear me, I'll scatter it fast enough, I'll war∣rant ye;—I love to live well, you know;—I can buy some cattle with it, and other articles;—spend a great deal more at taverns, and in good company;—give some away to children and Negroes;—contrive now and then to lose a bundle;—but above all, I can give it away, fas∣ter than you can make it at <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I depend, Mr. <HI>Gibber,</HI> on your fidelity;—and I have it in command from the General, to promise you a reward beyond your utmost wishes, if you conduct agree∣able to our expectations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gibb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall do the best I can, for this scheme will please my Wife beyond all bounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Having dispatched the money, let us attend, in the next place, to the trade, and how it may be conduct∣ed most successfully.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, I fancy, is a most intricate business;— it will require our utmost penetration and ingenuity, to guard it on all sides against interruption;—the Rebels are all alert on this subject, and seem to be determined to disconcert every measure; and they have been fortunate enough to succeed in their first attempt, so as to render a total change of the mode absolutely necessary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Mr. <HI>Plunket,</HI> I've experienced what you say to my sorrow;—I've been intirely out of business, ever since my goods were seized; and every scheme to get any more has fail'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fid.</SPEAKER>
<P>The coast is lined with guards all along shore, and the Sound is full of Boats and Privateers, so that I shou'd think it impossible ever to escape 'em all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and there's that damn'd <HI>Frankly,</HI> and his Comrades, whom I dread more than all the guards;— a few dollars will make any centry be still, but money nor threats can't move them, I know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's all true, Gentlemen; but you must remember that every thing is known better at <HI>New-York,</HI> than it is here, and they are better able to find remedies for all dif∣ficulties,
<PB N="43" REF="017918_0042_0FA37BB202476F60"/>
which I can assure you is already done;—a plan is deeply laid, and in part executed, that will effectually restore the trade;—all that is wanted is a little assistance from you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every assistance you request, will most readily be afforded:—but I'm impatient to hear what this plan can be;—it must certainly be an ingenious one, to over∣come so many obstacles, and at the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me time, to be kept a secret from the eyes of the world:—to me indeed it appears little less than impossible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Sir, nothing can be more natural and easy; 'tis no more than setting on foot, a plundering scheme to the Island, under a notion of retaliation:—Let a num∣ber of Boats be equip'd, and property officer'd, and the business is done:—The Governor of <HI>Connecticut</HI> is old, and can easily be duped into measures, by their having a plausible appearance, that will ultimately end in the ruin of the State.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is truly a deep laid plan, and I believe it will succeed, if Men subtle and faithful enough, can be found to execute it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's the easiest part of the whole:—The bare Idea of hard money, is so bewitching to Men, who have so long been destitute of it, that the consideration of a trifling sum in prospect, will induce the hottest Whig in the State, to abandon his principles, desert the cause of his Country, and join heartily with us, in subverting it's Independency.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>But can it be conceal'd from the prying eyes of the Populace?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I've no fear on that head:—Retaliation is a very popular notion in the Country now, and the pleasure ari∣sing from it's being put in practice, will overbalance eve∣ry consequence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm exceedingly pleas'd with the design:—I find that there's wiser heads in the world than mine:— but won't it be difficult to preserve, among those who car∣ry it on, an union and good understanding, so necessary to it's success?—From the nature of the service, they will be rivals of interest, as well as honour, whence jea∣lousies
<PB N="44" REF="017918_0043_0FA37BB2C1D54CA0"/>
and disputes, will be apt to arise, which will prove fatal to the plan, if not to all concerned.</P>

<P>Measures are concerted to prevent all this:—no one is to be employ'd to command a Boat in this service, but such as we shall chuse, from among those, who are in appearance the most furious, and noisy, in the cause of their Country, but in reallity, would readily sell it for hard cash;—and if any of a different character should unfortunately get a commission, reports must be circula∣ted to his disadvantage, and you must never leave tradu∣cing him, 'till he is either turned out, or quits the service: —Care must also be taken, to preserve the popular cla∣mour in favour of retaliation, and plundering those goods, which, it must be said, are placed along the north shore of <HI>Long-Island,</HI> for a bait to the <HI>Connecticut</HI> People:—by these means the business will receive no check;—but if any insuperable difficulties should arise, the party that thinks himself aggrieved, must be satisfied from the King's treasury.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>The whole is exquisite;—it charms my heart, to think of the important, and salutary consequences that must ensue:—But is not there a deficiency, observable in the plan?—You can transport as many goods as you please, across the Sound, and receive hard money there∣for, but you say nothing about provisions, and that's a capital point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we can exchange our goods for hard money, our principal end is obtained;—it being impossible for them to exist without it.—I would just observe here, that it is happy for us, in the execution of this project, that the <HI>Americans</HI> have yet to learn, that parting with staple commodities, and specie, for foreign articles of Luxury, introduces a gay and gaudy poverty:—Yet so great is their infatuation, through love of finery;—so agreeable are tinsel'd ornaments to their natural genius, that a man would part with his working cattle, for a velvet suit, and a woman her milch cow, for a si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k gown, tho' there∣by they deprive themselves of their only means of sub∣sistance:—This disposition properly encouraged, will assist us greatly;—we can lull them asleep, by our finery▪
<PB N="45" REF="017918_0044_0FA37BB382077860"/>
and make them forget the great concerns of their Coun∣try:—You never knew a peasant, that distinguished him∣self as a soldier, in a velvet coat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir;—but the Country will still be in a flourishing condition, tho' destitute of money, if they have plenty of provisions; while our friends at <HI>New-York</HI> are suffering for want of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing will be easier than to convey over all the provisions that can be procured:—They must be previ∣ously deposited in some secret, and unguarded place on the shore, from whence they will be taken in the night, by a boat which set sail for the Island the day before, and return'd under cover of the darkness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>No further objection can be made to the plan: —It is, I think, brought to perfection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have yet to mention one thing more, which will very greatly advance the trade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is making a sham use of hostilities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray how, and to what purpose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let one of the Traders go to the Island, and agree with the Merchants upon time and place:—After his re∣turn, he wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l sit out a vessel for the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> or else∣where; but before he gets out of the Sound, he must be taken, and carried to <HI>New-York,</HI> according to agreement: —Returning from his short captiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty, apparently in the greatest poverty and distress, he will sit out a Boat, or small Privateer, to get satisfaction for his late loss, and he will be sure to capture some small craft, loaded with goods, to the full amount of his vessel and cargo:—But this is a tender point:—I need not be explicit, for those, who act upon this plan, must first go to the Island, where they will receive every direction;—the Boatmen will be greatly assistant, and all may be helpful to one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>What wisdom and foresight in the Authors of such plans!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will just hint one thing more, to convince you, that every engine is at work, to accomplish this business: —Let all masters of vessels, and boats employ'd by us, have a written protection, from the Commander in Chief,
<PB N="46" REF="017918_0045_0FA37BB440BA3010"/>
that if they should happen to be really taken, by some of his Majesty's cruizers, that were ignorant of the plan, their vessels and cargoes might be return'd to them again without fraud or emb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zzlement:—This plan has this important advantage, that all Rebels, who may happen to be on board such captur'd vessels, may be retained pri∣soners of war, while all true Loyalists, will be immedi∣ately discharged, with all their proper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, unhurt.</P>

<P>It is expected, Gentlemen, that you will all be assiduous, in carrying into execution, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se plans for re∣newing the trade, tho' the greatest share of trouble will fall upon Mr. <HI>Flutter,</HI> who will go with me to the Island, and procure such papers, and instructions, as may be ne∣cessary:—You've no objections, Mr. <HI>Flutter?</HI></P>

<P>You may depend, Sir, upon the strenuous ex∣ertions of each of us:—But have you any thing more to communicate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, and most important matters too;—you no doubt have heard of the association of the Refugees on the Island.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>We've heard of it; but are entirely ignorant of it's design.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>The design is very extensive;—they've a number of armed vessels and transpor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, sufficient for defence, and conveyance across the Sound, to some of the sea port towns in this State, which is to be the seat of their operations;—they are to be supplied with arms, and am∣munition from the public stores, but are to have no pay, nor provisions, but what they can get;—this will be a stimulus to them, to urge them on in quest of plunder:— They will be directed to seize, and bring off as much property as possible, and to burn and destroy the rest; and all persons of every age and sex, will be put to the

sword without distinction, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cept perhaps a few, who may be preserved alive, from meer grace and favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt this last will hurt their character, as it appears rather too cruel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is thought to be necessary, since it will intimi∣date the Country, and strike it with a dread of their arms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear you'll be mistaken here; for I've observ∣ed that this Country is more apt to be enraged, than in∣timidated at such treatment;—they'll all share the same fate themselves, I doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>They certainly expect it, if they fall into the ene∣mies hands; but you may be assured they'll die to a man, rather than be taken;—it will be bloody work for the Rebels.</P>

<P>But don't relax in the least, on this account;—be as cautious and vigilant as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver;—you may be arrested and secured, before you can get under their protection: And besides, whilst you are here, you are much more ser∣viceable to the cause, than you cou'd be there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir, an open enemy is not so dangerous as a secret one;—this is the reason that Spies, by the Law of nations, are always executed, as soon as detected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ay, and the Rebels wou'd mutton me quick enough, if they knew of my being here; for I can do 'em more hurt in one night than I cou'd in ten years at <HI>New-York.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your being catcht now, wou'd be of infinite damage to us;—let our business be concluded with all expedition, and do you make your escape to <HI>New-York,</HI> with the utmost speed:—but can't the Loyals in the Country, be assistant to the associated force in their ope∣rations?</P>

<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Assistant?—Indeed Sir they will be;—so impor∣tant a circumstance as that, could not be neglected:—To raise a body of troops in the Country, and assist them in getting to <HI>New-York,</HI> is one thing designed to be effected by the Association:—It's above two months now, since <HI>Clinton</HI> and <HI>Arnold,</HI> sent each a declaration into the Coun∣try, offering full pardon and protection, to all who were willing to return to their allegiance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>These, Sir, we've seen, but have been doubtful of their effect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>The proposed effect could not fail to take place;— they were design'd, not to convert any of the adherents to Congress, but to revive the hearts of the true Loyalists, and convince them that they were not f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgotten, and thus preparing the way, for the inlisting orders, which im∣mediately followed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Inlisting orders d'ye say?—You surprise me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes!—'Tis now two months, since inlisting or∣ders were sent into different parts of the Country, by trusty hands:—And I know it to be true, that above two thousand Men are already inlisted, who are all ready, at a moments warning, to act in concert with the associated forces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I'm astonish'd!—Can it be true?—The world's now our own!—But how is it possible, that this could be compleated without a discovery?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>When it was proposed, to raise this body of troops, in the Country, the proper officers were all picked ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and▪ together with the orders, was sent a promise of their commissions, upon their procuring the specified number of Men:—This made them vigilant and circumspect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far is good; but how cou'd the inlistments be concealed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>When any man, after seeing the orders, and knowing the conditions, was desirous of inlisting, he de∣clared in the presence of two Men, who had previously engaged, that he accepted of the offers, and conditions, and was determined to comply with every requisition;— in confirmation of this, he then signed a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ank paper, which was carefully convey'd to me at <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w-York.</HI></P>

<P>What a wise foresight was this?—The disco∣very of a proper inlistment, would have been the death of all that had signed it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>We could not be ignorant of this; and therefore it was necessary to adopt a mode, that wou'd secure the inlisted from danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how are these men to be collected, and sent off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was a going to tell you;—the first descent that will be made by the Associators, is fixed at about the mid∣dle of <HI>April</HI>;—as many Men as possible must be in rea∣diness by that time, from this State, that of <HI>New-York,</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> and even as far as <HI>Vermont,</HI> whether inlistments are sent:—A few days before their approach, they will give you notice of the time;—this you will circulate to all friends, with the utmost expedi∣tion:—Then immediately, you will prepare to collect yourselves with all diligence, at some suitable rendezvous, a reasonable distance from the water side, and so situate, if possible, as to have considerable settlements, on the nearest rout, from thence, to the place where the descent will be made, so that you can do the more mischief, in your march to join the Associators:—They will assist your collecting, by making a false alarm, a day or two before the time appointed, and at some distance from the place of action;—at the alarm numbers of you will appear zealous in the Country's cause, and march with the rest for it's defence, taking care to leave them at the first op∣portunity, and immediately join your friends, at the ap∣pointed rendezvous:—After the inhabitants of the Coun∣try, are thus pretty generally drawn off, and the Loyalists collected, the true alarm will be given, by a heavy dis∣charge of artillery:—You will then, suddenly rush from your ambuscade, and, with an unrelenting hand, spread ruin, destruction, and slaughter;—killing, without pity, every man, woman, and child;—making compleat havock of cattle, and all other stock;—and burning every house, and other building, that may be within your reach, while marching to join the associated force.</P>

<P>It is the intention of his most gracious Majesty, not only to impoverish, but to depopulate the Country, as fast as possible:—You may be assured, that the King is meditating a terrible vengeance, against those daring Re∣bels, that refuse to submit to his righteous Authority:— The present design, I must confess, is unprecedented among civilized nations; but the enormities practised in this Country, are likewise unprecedented, and call aloud for unprecedented punishment:—His Majesty, therefore, determines, by the help of <HI>God,</HI> to extirpate them, by de∣grees, from the face of the Earth, that all nations may tremble, when they see the dreadful consequences of a∣waking the wrath of inexorable <HI>Britain:</HI>—And all that are assistant in accomplishing this desirable business, will not only save themselves from a swift destruction, but will merit applause from all good Men, and will receive a glo∣rious reward from the King.</P>
</SP>

<P>This is, this is, what I've always wisht for:—The Rebels deserve every thing, the King can do to 'em:— I've always told 'em they'd have it with a vengeance bime∣by, but they only laught at me sor't; and now they may take what follows;—my thinks they will cut a fine figure, running a wild goose chase after the Loyal Refugees, at the same time that their houses are in flames at home, and their wives and children, with their throats cut:— But they shall have no pity from me, I'll warrant 'em.</P>

<P>We need<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'t carry the point any further, Gen∣tleman; the case is very plain, that the exercise of pity towards them, at this critical juncture, will procure the ruin of ourselves, and our cause;—let us therefore, lay aside every unmanly passion, and forward this plan, all that lies in our power; the good consequences of which, can be proved from reason, and common sense, to out∣weigh every other consideration.</P>

<P>Well, my dear Christian friends, let no man's heart fail him, in this great and important business;—let none of those, that have put their hands to the plough, look back;—but let us persevere to the end, doing what our hands find to do, with all our might, as for our lives: —And if there is any so inconsiderate, as to refuse doing his duty in this day of need, I shall only repeat these words of scripture to him, "Cursed is he that keepeth his hands from shedding blood."</P>

<P>Then you, in effect, give the lie to the King;— you durst not trust so faithful a King;—astonishing!— Had you confidence in him, only as a grain of mustard seed, it would instantly remove all your doubts and fears, tho' they were as great, and extensive, as your guilt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt, Sir; but we lack such sort of faith:—I have no disposition to trust a man with my life, who has so often proved himself, to be totally devoid of every principle of truth and humanity.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plunk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who made you a judge of the truth of what the King says, or of the humanity of what he does!—I tell you, ye plaguy fools, if you believe 'tis possible, for the King ever to utter a fashood, or do a cruel action, you deserve to be hung in gibbets, as traitors.</P>

<P>Then you suppose the King to be as infallible as his Holiness, the Pope:—But what if be denies to day, what he asserted yesterday;—would not that be a contra∣diction?</P>

<P>If such a thing shou'd happen, you must sup∣pose that the nature of things alters just so;—or you must believe, that he is so much above the common race of mortals, that you are not able to comprehend the miste∣rious meaning of what he says;—at any rate, we are ne∣ver to dispute the truth of Majesty; but always to rest satisfied, that he never utters any thing but the simple verity.</P>

<P>Such conversation is surely intolerable;—but we must bear it for the present:—I hope before long, that we may have it in our power, to silence such foul mouth∣ed rascals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come think no more on 'em,—they're gone, and I'm very glad on't; for now I can take a little plea∣sure in your company:—Whilst they was here, I felt as bad as I shou'd in Newgate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stand.</SPEAKER>
<P>They must certainly have a peculiar faculty of producing pain, if they are capable of rendering the place where they be, as irksome as that den of horror:—To be confined so far under ground, and among such inhabitants, would be far more terrible to me than death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's the very design of the prison;—when a malefactor is found guilty of such enormous crimes, that death is too low a punishment for him, though inflicted with all it's horrors, and torments, he is then consigned to Newgate, as to a punishment, in some degree adequate, to the crimes of one, who deserves more than death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Considered in this view I approve of it;—though I must confess, that my nature revolted, at the Idea of treating a fellow creature with so much severity, though he were guilty of the blackest villainies;—but now I per∣ceive it was designed for the Tories, and it is suitable for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobody can ever pity those monsters, I'm sure, if they were to lie there all their days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Sir;—they would deserve no pity, though the horror of their confinement, should be aggravated by
<PB N="60" REF="017918_0059_0FA37BBEC1586410"/>
torments of the most excruciating nature:—The common death of a malefactor, would, in their case, by no means satisfy the broken Laws of their injured Country;—no∣thing but the painful extension of a miserable existence, can be adequate to their crimes, and make such atone∣ment for them, as humanity itself requires.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stand.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the Tories are as bad as I have lately heard hinted from you, and Mr. <HI>Frankly,</HI> I intirely acquiesce in what you say; but I can hardly believe them to be so horridly abandoned.</P>

<P>I'm not answerable for other people's faults;— I only told you what I heard, and if it's a lie, you have it as cheap as I;—nobody can blame me for telling what I hear, sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes they can;—the state of our affairs, at this juncture, is so critical, that every one, and post riders more especially, ought to spread no reports, but those they are satisfied are true, and even then, prudence is ne∣cessary:—To act otherways is a species of business, that no considerate man that is friendly, will be guilty of.</P>

<P>You may depend upon it, that the Southern post is a Tory, else he would never have reported such a notorious falshood.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you may;—but if you are a real friend to your Country, you ought to use a little prudence at least: —Indiscretion hurts the cause, as much as enmity; and when any one assists the enemy, through imprudence, he is so far a Tory:—I do not suppose that you are inimical upon design; yet I must observe, that you often do mis∣chief, for want of prudence and discretion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you what, Sir, the people ought to know every thing that's doing, that they may know how to take advantage of the times, and improve those good opportunities of making their fortunes:—They complain, and with reason too, that intelligence has often been kept from 'em, to their great damage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I'll tell you what too, Mr. <HI>Gallop,</HI> I'll exert myself to the utmost, to bring to the most exemplary punishment, the man that I find taking those advantages you mention;—it is most disgraceful to humanity, that
<PB N="62" REF="017918_0061_0FA37BC042470200"/>
any among the race, is capable of being so sordid, so base, so abject, and so lost to all the tender feelings of humani∣ty, as to improve opportunities of enriching themselves, out of the ruins of their Country;—yet this is what you recommend, and are using your influence to promote.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I've always been a friend to my Country, and really wish there was nothing done wrong in it;—I shou'd be as much pleas'd as any on you, to see the trade stopt, and the money not depreciate no more, and to have all hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ksters and sharpers banished the Country forever:—But as I know of a great many, that have got large fortunes, by trading and jockying about, why mayn't I do so as well as they?—It's unreasonable to for∣bid me, and permit them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>This I take to be a sample of your defence of such conduct, and it amounts to just this, that because there is a number of sly artful villain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that are able to elude the Laws, and continue in the practice of every species of enormity, in spite of every eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt to detect, and suppress them, that therefor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and what every one ought to do:—A most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vindication!—A little despicable wealth, though in distant prospect, has the lament<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le power, of unhinging the man, of suspending the use of his rational faculties, and of producing effects, which could only be expected from a confirmed state of madness and stupidity.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gal.</SPEAKER>
<P>What plan is it, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is this:—That considering we have plenty of provisions, and no money; and the enemy have money, but no provisions; all the meat and flour in the Country, is to be collected and sent to them, for which they will pay the solid coin:—By this mean, our finances will be established on a respectable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooting;—our soldiers will be paid;—and our cause flourish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I must confess, I'm full in the opinion, that such a step wou'd be the most proper we cou'd take at this time; for the enemy will, in spite of our teeth, have all our provisions that they want, and the money for 'em all centres in private hands, and does the Country no good:—Now I'd prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se that the matter be taken up by Congress, and let all the profits go into the continental Treasury, for the use of the States.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a happy thought;—it never entered my noddle before;—Congress would cut a glorious figure, in the eye of the world, in trading with the enemy, nay with the very garrison, which is in effect besieged:—This cannot fail of placing our finances upon a sure founda∣tion;—it will defuse life and vigour through every de∣partment;—restore the expiring patriotism of my Coun∣trymen, to it's original ardor;—but above all, by put∣ting a few dollars into the pockets of the soldiers, our army would make a most formidable appearance, though destitute of provisions;—the enemy sure, must tremble at the sight of such an invincible Phalanx.</P>

<P>How surprising it is!—How unworthy our rank in the scale of being! —To plot, for months together, the destruction of intimate friends, and neighbours, manifests a species of infernal malice, that wants a name, and exhi∣bits a specimen of the wickedness, that Man is capable of: —It is true indeed, that passion, and interest, can oblite∣rate every tender feeling of humanity; but when once mankind have given themselves up, to the entire domi∣nion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselves, of every restraint, the infernal Devils must acknowledge themselves exceed∣ed by the incarnate.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>America</HI> has hitherto been the peculiar care of a watchful Providence, and I believe will be so still:—Hea∣ven seems to design great and glorious things for this Country,—to make it the Theatre of some remarkable display of his mighty power, and will never suffer it to be desolated by his implacable enemies, in Earth, or Hell;— not a single instance of treason, of any consequence, du∣ring this long, and malevolent contest, has ever been exe∣cuted against us; though many times, the fatal train has been laid, and the match lighted and ready, when a bene∣ficent Providence, ever attentive to our welfare, averted the blow, and saved us from impending ruin:—the Deity, who has so often rescued us, almost miraculously, expects that we should still put confidence in him, and rely upon his power, for safety and protection:—Thus doing <HI>Ame∣rica</HI> never will fall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your observation is worthy of the highest no∣tice:—To have so few instances of treason (and none of those to succeed) in a war, from whose nature and cir∣cumstances, more than usual might have been expected, reflects the highest honour on our Country and cause, and proves both, to be under the peculiar care of Heaven:— But still it will be necessary to exert ourselves, and make use of our best endeavoure:—Providence don't usually work without means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir, to expect the Deity will help those, that wont help themselves is an impious presumption:— It is we ourselves, my friends, that must relieve our Coun∣try, with the aid, and guidance of Providence;—and, in the fullest confidence of those that are present, I inform you,
<PB N="67" REF="017918_0066_0FA37BC449F95070"/>
that we have only to execute a plan already concerted, that will be sufficient to unravel those dark proceedings of the Tories, and free the Country from such noisome pests, by the execution of ample justice.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ask no questions, Gentlemen; but rest satisfied, that the measures will be decisive, and that Men of Au∣thority, and ability are to have the chief management:— You are only to be faithful to your trust, and ready at all hours to execute every order that may be given you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stand.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will be only by secrecy, confidence, and fide∣lity, that we can hope for su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cess:—Let there be, there∣fore, no suspicion or distrust among us;—let each one ob∣serve a perfect silence:—It will be sufficient that Mr. <HI>Frankly</HI> knows the whole:—we can execute his orders as well, though we are unacquainted to what individual point they tend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us remember, my friends, to be as true, and faithful to ourselves, and our cause, as the Tories are to theirs; and not give occasion for a disgraceful contrast between us, and those abandoned villains:—That union, secrecy, and fidelity are qualities which they possess, none will deny; but that they are virtues in them none will allow, since they prostitute them, to the most bloody purposes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fear.</SPEAKER>
<P>The principles and conduct of the Tories must be most abominable, when they are able to turn into the most detestable vices, those qualities, which of themselves are most eminent virtues:—Faithfulness, secrecy, and concord, have ever been esteemed virtues of a superior rank; but no sooner are they contaminated, by the bale∣ful breath of those infidels in politics, but their amiable natures are changed into others as hideous and hateful:— As a body infected with the plauge, turns all it's mild and salutary food into a poisonous, and deadly contagion, destructive of all within the sphere of it's influence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us then practice them for the best of all purposes, as perseveringly as they do for the worst:—Let us prosecute the design, with unabating vigour, and faithfulness:—Let us be as wise as serpents, for the in∣dustry, and malice of the infernal regions is against us;—
<PB N="68" REF="017918_0067_0FA37BC4C21D2340"/>
yet let us not be disheartened on that account, for the chief Authority of the <HI>United States,</HI> have engaged their aid and support:—And I can with assurance flatter myself, that we shall finally have the pleasure, to see our exertions crowned with success;—our enemies baffled and con∣founded;—and treason receive it's just desert.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It is a pleasing thought, my friends, to reflect, that while our sanguinary foes are meditating a bloody carnage, a number of generous minds, animated with a patriotic ardor, nobly determine to make a voluntary sa∣crifice of ease, interest, and character, and to expose their lives to an enraged, and blood-thirsty foe, for the purpose of detecting their horrid plots, breaking up their treason∣able combinations, and bringing the black conspirators to condign punishment.</P>

<P>Those instantaneous feelings, which are occasi∣oned by grievous disappointments, heightened by the grossest abuse and insult, and still further aggravated, by an ungrateful return, for eminent services, never give a man time to reflect, whether relief and satisfaction is to be obtained by those means, which conscience in a calm moment would approve of: Common sense will direct him, in such an exigency, to the most suitable methods to obtain redress and safety, and these he will immediate∣ly determine to pursue, as being, in fact, his only alter∣native.</P>

<P>Being fully perswaded, that the Deity never designed, that man, who is endued with such strong de∣sires of existence, should be passive in distress, and quiet∣ly yield to his fate, I am firmly resolved, to act agreeable to the Laws of Nature, and to defend myself in every cir∣cumstance:—Let the villains stand aloof, and not irri∣tate men, that are deliberately desperate.—Every irra∣tional animal, by natural instinct, flies from danger, and boldly resists the hand, that attempts to do it an injury; and can it be supposed, that man, the glory of this lower creation, shall act counter, to the most vigorous, and po∣tent

<P>After being denied the support, and protection of the Laws of the State, it wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d be the completion of calamity, not to have it in our power, to recur to those of nature;—indeed the very supposition is absurd, for the Laws of nature necessarily take place, when all other Laws cease their operation;—and this, Gentlemen, must now be our support and defence, against the malice of friends and foes.</P>

<P>The sensibility of my soul has been so often ir∣ritated, by the barbarous repetitions of a series of the most cruel and pointed insults, that it is impossible I should endure them any longer:—An injury I can bear with some degree of of patience; but an affront, repeat∣ed with aggravating circumstances, is too bitterly pro∣voking for humanity:—Every one, therefore, must ex∣pect a severe return, for every scoffing reproach and in∣sult:—From my positive knowledge of the late designs of the Tories, I know they deserve death, by all Laws, human and divine; and if they should receive it from my hand, it would only be the execution of that justice, which ought to have been done by the magistrate; and thereby have prevented those high handed provocations, and threats, that may raise my hand.</P>

<P>If those base and unfeeling wretches, should continue in any reasonable bounds, it will be noble in us, to treat them, and their insults, with total neglect and inattention; but when they become outrageous either in words, or actions, the only way left, for us to preserve the least tincture of honour among mankind, will be to knock them down without hesitation:—Indeed what else can we do?—To scold and wrangle with them, will be only to return railing for railing, and will serve no other purpose, but to level us with the miscreants we dispute with;—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> submit the affair to the decision of fifty cuffs will be more ineligible than to die handsomely by a ball, or halter;—and if we wait for redress from the civil Law, we shall lean upon a broken st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff, which instead of

<P>If the Tories are wise for themselves, they will be more sparing of their provocations for the future,— this will be their only course to be safe;—I have been somewhat indulgent to them hitherto;—having turned the malice of magistrates, and people against us, and res∣cued themselves from a deserved punishment, they may be allowed to exult a little of their exploits:—But now they must stay their hand:—we can endure it no longer; honour and existence both forbid it.</P>

<P>And here, my friends, is a mistery that asto∣nishes;—a parcel of the refuge of mankind, numbers of whom notorious villains from their infancy, and all pro∣fessed and avowed enemies to this Country, have been able to obtain such influence over the minds of people, as to induce those, that are appointed by the community, to be executors of the Laws, scourges of the guilty, and protectors of the innocent; to induce these, I say, to lay aside every social, civil, and legal obligation;—to acquit those bloody wretches, that deserved the gibbit;—and to condemn to infamy the patriotic few, that boldly da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to oppose the overwhelming deluge, which was laying waste the Country.—Let those who have taken a solemn oath, to see justice administered, and the Laws executed, answer for their conduct, to their Maker, and their con∣sciences.</P>

<P>Happy should I be, if we had the conducting of this affair over again;—sure I am, that our measures should be concerted with so much prudence, and execu∣ted with such dexterity, that neither the connections that subsist between Whig and Tory, nor the malevolence of party jealousy, should ever be able to screen the culprits from the just vengeance of the broken Laws:—When we at first engaged in the matter, we thought that the justice of our cause, would ensure success, even against the tor∣rent of popular passion, prejudice, and jealousy:—But too late we found our error, and that the Tories, by skil∣fully employing a better policy, and adapting their artful insinuations, to the prevailing foibles of the populace, were lucky enough to ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e and confound us.—Such an interruption never could happen again.</P>

<P>I think we have nothing to accuse ourselves of, Gentlemen:—When every circumstance is considered, and every difficulty, with which we had to encounter, is taken into view, it is a matter of wonder, that we effected so much as we did:—In one thing we certainly succeed∣ed to admiration;—our councils and designs were per∣fectly concealed from the eyes of all;—every enterprise wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as sudden and unexpected as a thunder clap;—and it was so difficult to penetrate into our designs, further than we unfolded them, that it often gave me no small degree of pleasure, to see the rabble staring, and wonder∣ing what was on the carpet:—And indeed so decisive were our measures, that if the Whigs had not deserted us, at the critical moment of necessity;—if our friends, who were connected with us, had not betrayed and for∣saken us, at the very juncture, when their presence, and fidelity, were most especially important to our proceed∣ings, the Tories would have been crushed, treason punish∣ed, and patriotism rewarded:—But now the natural dis∣position

<P>Yes, those insults are too much to be born!— The world will say they are too much!—To undertake such an arduous business, alone, and unassisted;—to pass through all the dangers, and fatigues of it's prosecution; —to expend a large portion of time, and money;—to de∣tect, and unravel a fatal plot against the Country;—to rescue it from imminent dangers;—to bring the conspi∣rators to the bar of justice;—and at the time, when no∣thing was wanting, to rid the land of those noisome pests, but attention to the evidences, which were r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dy to be ad∣duced, in support of facts, to have the popular clamour, with the civil Authority at it's head, rise to such a height, as to render it prudent to stop the proceedings;—prudent did I say?—Nay it was absolutely necessary to leave the prosecution, and take care of ourselves; for we were hunted with more fury, than if we had been canibals, and pursued with greater rancour, and speed than high way robbers and all this, for no other reason, but because we had saved them from the sword, and the flames:—While at the very same time, to aggravate our painful feelings, those faithful servants of <HI>Satan,</HI> and genuine heirs of Hell, the Tories, were befriended, caressed, applauded, pitied, and treated with the greatest kindness, and atten∣tion:—All this is indeed too much!—It is too much for flesh and blood to endure!—Patience has nothing to do here!—She sinks under the burden of such complicated distress, and affords no relief!—What shall we say fur∣ther?—For such important services, instead of a reward, to lose our good name, to be condemned to infamy, to be esteemed pests to society, and disturbers of the public peace; and above all to be obliged to stand the taunt, and

<P>I can truly say.

<P>It is so trifling, compared with other things, that I shall never give myself the trouble of an uneasy thought about it:—All I lament is, that the virtue of my Country is so near expiring, while our dangers remain, and the great and arduous contest for Liberty, is yet to be closed:—It is certainly a symptom of a fatal disease approaching to the body politic, when the generous, and disinterested Patriot is neglected, and despised, while the sordid, and bloody Tory is honoured, and carassed; the certain consequene of which is, a decrease of the former, and an increase of the latter, to the destruction of the community, on the plan of independency▪—It is matter of no small surprise to me, that our State Doctors have never noticed this disorder, and made application of the proper remedies, by a total change of measures;—one would naturally think, that a consideration of their own safety, apart from any concern for their Country, would be sufficient, to influence them to this conduct; for they cannot be insensible, that they will be the first sacrifices, at the subjugation of <HI>America.</HI></P>

<L>But if you've seen the play to night,</L>
<L>You'll swear, that all was said in spite,</L>
<L>And that af'rall these plaguy jokes,</L>
<L>We women still are clever folks,</L>
<L>Are always wise, and good and kind,</L>
<L>No mischief dwells within our mind;</L>
<L>Think much, talk little, softly too,</L>
<L>We tell no tales, are chaste and true:</L>
<L>When an event has taken place,</L>
<L>We knew it well before it was.</L>
<L>And can declare▪ when things we see,</L>
<L>We told exactly how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey'd be;</L>
<L>We are, like turtle doves, most harmless,</L>
<L>Ne'er breed confusion in our fam'lies,</L>
<L>Nor raise disorders in the State,</L>
<L>Nor vent our malice, spleen, or hate:</L>
<L>Shou'd you suppose 'twere otherwise,</L>
<L>'Tis a deception of your eyes;</L>
<L>And if you ever find intrigues,</L>
<L>'Tis fate has plan'd them, or the Whigs:</L>
<L><PB REF="017918_0086_0FA37BD303216058"/>No Tory, male or female's found,</L>
<L>Obscurely working under ground,</L>
<L>Or ever once his cause forsook,</L>
<L>Or e'er trod back the step he'd took;</L>
<L>But Whigs, those inconsistent elves,</L>
<L>Will mob us first, and then themselves;</L>
<L>Contrive deep plans to undermine us;</L>
<L>But quickly change their minds▪ and join us;</L>
<L>Fight all the Reg'lars in <HI>New-York,</HI></L>
<L>Yet help them onward in their work;</L>
<L>Give them their money, and provision,</L>
<L>And sink the Country to perdition:</L>
<L>So if the land is overturn'd,</L>
<L>Themselves all kill'd, their towns all burn'd,</L>
<L>With not a house, or soul upon it,</L>
<L>'Tis they themselves, not us, have done it▪</L>
