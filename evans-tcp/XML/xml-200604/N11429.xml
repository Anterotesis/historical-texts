<P>Pretty well I thank you. Your servant Mr. <HI>Puff:</HI> Pray be seated gentlemen.

<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, by all means sir, I'm in no hurry—but as for politicks I can do well enough without them here, provided always that you don't banish them from my shop; for there they are a part of my trade; at least, they are the <HI>Causa sine qua non</HI> of my custom; and a trade in <HI>theory</HI> without the <HI>practical</HI> part, will go but little way towards keeping the pot boiling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Verily, friend <HI>Trim,</HI> thou art arch to day—why I have often heard thee holding forth to thy customers, with such energy and apparent zeal, against British tyranny and op∣pression, that I was verily persuaded thou wast infected with the epidemical frenzy of the times; but now I find thou wast only cunningly working at thy trade forsooth—truly thou art a very wag.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye friend <HI>Brim,</HI> all trades have their mysteries, and one half the world live by the follies of the other half.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray Mr. <HI>Trim,</HI> are you such a <HI>tory</HI> as to turn all our grievances into scorn and derision, and only pretend to be a friend to your country▪ for the sake of a living?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, between you and I and the post. Mr. <HI>Puff,</HI> I believe, <HI>you,</HI> when you would be a representative, and <HI>Trim</HI> the barber, when he would get and keep good custom, act upon much the same principles with ninety nine in a hundred of the most flaming, patriotic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of liberty. Interest is the word! But I claim the <HI>exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sive</HI> right of preaching <HI>myself,</HI> only in <HI>my own shop</HI>; every where else, I had much rather be a hearer of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y good minister Mr. <HI>Sharp</HI>—therefore you must excuse me from entering the lists here, unless it be now and then a word or so, by way of marginal note: And upon the word of an honest shaver, or trimmer, or, call me what you please, I'd shave or trim you all round for nothing, if I could but hear you settle intelligibly, what is a whig and what a tory—what is constitution, and what are charter rights and privileges—what is the obedience due from an American Englishman, to the king and parliament of Great-Britain, and what are our grievances; for by the mother that bore me, and by the father (if I ever had one) who begot me, I do so∣lemnly affirm, friend <HI>Brim,</HI> that notwithstanding all I have <HI>heard,</HI> and the still greater, <HI>all,</HI> I have <HI>preached</HI> upon this subject, I am ignorant of the essential difference (if there is any) between a <HI>true <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ig</HI> and an <HI>honest tory.</HI> I know nothing in our constitution by which we can claim any privileges which are deny'd us. I have never heard of any obedience, demand∣ed
<PB N="7" REF="014454_0007_0F928F6D25D15DB0"/>
by the king and parliament, which I can in conscience withhold; and I have no more idea of the grievances which for the sake of my custom, I am oblig'd to join in complain∣ing of than I have of the political disputes in the moon; though I believe they are pretty much alike, because our's, I can safely swear savor strong of <HI>lunacy.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend <HI>Trim,</HI> in good truth, thou speakest like an oracle— I would thou and I could hear these matters discuss'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I say, amen—for I hear them talk'd about and about every day, and many a good mug of flip do I sell upon the same account, and that's all I get by it; for, burn my bar-room, if I understand a word of the pudden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bump.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know where Mr. <HI>Trim</HI> got his learning, but in his majesty's name, I do solemnly declare, that in my judgment, no mere man, since the days of <HI>Coke</HI> upon <HI>Littleton,</HI> could in so few words have express'd more upon the subject than he has done; and I heartily second his motion—provi∣ded always, that we first light our pipes, after having previ∣ously put about the tankard—Once before you fill, and twice before you light says the proverb—You know revd sir—he! he! he! hem! excuse me—sir my service to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff,</SPEAKER>
<P>Hem! he! hem! I cannot for the life of me com∣prehend how it is possible for a man of Mr. <HI>Trim</HI>'s good na∣tural sense, to be so egregiously mistaken in his notions of our constitutional rights and privileges, as he seems to be; why, Mr. speaker!—I beg pardon—gentlemen, I mean—but, no matter—let that slip—I ask pardon gentlemen—but as I was saying—for him to say as this here—to wit—that there is no difference between a <HI>whig</HI> and a <HI>tory</HI>—why what a dickens are we contending about, if so be as how this here was the case—a fine case truly—why has not Lord <HI>North</HI> and Lord <HI>Hilsbor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and that <HI>George Greenville</HI> stript us of all our con∣stitutional charter rights and privileges—the birth-right of Englishmen, which our pious fore-fathers purchased with their blood and treasure, when they came over into this waste how∣ling wilderness—and has not lord <HI>Chatham,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pitt,</HI> and lord <HI>Cambden,</HI> and—and—and—lord what d'ye call 'em— it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s immaterial about their names—I say please your honors —gentlemen, I mean—'ask pardon; have not these great and good men stood up for our rights and privileges, against the tyrannical designs of the corrupt ministry and house of com∣mons—and now, for to tell me that there is no difference be∣tween a <HI>whig</HI> and a <HI>tory</HI>—and for a man to say as how our
<PB N="8" REF="014454_0008_0F928F6E0A3432A8"/>
constitution isn't taken away—and that we've no grievances, and the like of that—I say, in my humble opinion he is an <HI>enemy to his country</HI>—just as if every man did not know what constitution is—and whether we had any grievances, and so forth; why Mr. <HI>Trim</HI> may talk his latin stuff if he pleases, with his <HI>Causes sino quono,</HI> and such like—I know some latin as well as he; and I say he's an <HI>ignoramis,</HI> if so be he talks at this ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e—I hope in mercy we shall have no bloodshed; but I swagger. (I ask pardon for swearing) but I snore, before I'd give up our just rights and privileges, I'd take my gun, and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad and fire and pull trigger like the nation and fight up to the knees in blood—but I wont put myself in a passion—I ask pardon gentlemen—By your leave sir, I'll make bold to take a drink of your cyder Gentlemen all your healths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe Mr. <HI>Puff</HI> it is with you pretty much as it is with your humble servant, you can preach best in <HI>your own shop;</HI> but as <HI>your shop</HI> as well as <HI>mine</HI> happens to be <HI>shut up,</HI> at this present writing, I fancy we both should save credit, by leaving it to others to discuss these knotty points; for I have frankly confess'd my ignorance; and if you follow my exam∣ple, it will positively be your shortest way out of the labyrinth in which you seem to be bewildered—<HI>sat verbum sapienti.</HI></P>

<P>None of your unmanly reflections Mr. <HI>Trim.</HI> I sup∣pose you think I don't understand <HI>greek.</HI></P>

<P>Friend <HI>Trim,</HI> I like thee and thy discourse, well— thy motion is good, and thy humour pleaseth my mind; and I do verily believe a calm debate upon these matters, inter∣larded with thy pithy marginal notes, would tend greatly to our edification.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe so too; and, by my aunt <HI>Tabitha</HI>'s muff, I protest good Mr <HI>Puff,</HI> that I had no design to offend you in any thing I have said, and if I have offended, I ask par∣don, and that's the satisfaction of a gentleman; and now I hope we shall verify the old proverb, <HI>Amantium ira amoris redintegratio est.</HI></P>

matters—h—hugh—as Mr.—h—hugh—<HI>Puff</HI> has very well observed, all our charter rights and privileges are torn from us and we are made slaves, and the Lord send us deliverance —h—hugh—h—hugh—h—hugh.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you carry matters rather too far deacon? You certainly view our public affairs through a gloomy de∣ceitful medium; you say <HI>all</HI> our charter rights and privileges are torn from us—and that we are <HI>slaves.</HI> Pray consider, don't you sit quietly under your own vine and under your own fig-tree? Don't you enjoy full liberty of conscience in reli∣gious matters? Don't you reap without interruption, the fruit of your own labours? Does any one meddle with your person or property? Are you overburthened with taxes? Compare your situation with that of any other people under heaven: Turn your eyes to your brother Englishmen in Great-Britain—see with what taxes and duties they are bur∣thened—and you will find you enjoy liberty, freedom and ease in a degree so far superior to them, that if you have the least spark of gratitude in your bosom, you will be so far from murmering and complaining, like the grumbling, rebellious Jews of old, that you will exclaim, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the most grateful effusion of soul, "The lines are fallen to us in pleasant pla∣ces, yea▪ we have a goodly heritage."</P>

<P>Or with the poet,

That is to say, Mr. <HI>Puff, How happy are Americans, if they did but know it!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>The truth is, and it is a melancholly truth, we have been lifted up to heaven in privileges, and now like the cho∣sen people of old, we spurn at the hand that raised and has hitherto sustained us: Our king has planted us in a land flow∣ing with milk and honey, and has driven out the Canaanites from before us, and left us no thorn in our side—and now we vauntingly and ungratefully say, who shall be Lord over us? The description given of the Jews by Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> fits us, so very nearly, that I cannot help repeating it—</P>
<L>"The Jews, a head-strong, moody, murm'ring race,</L>

<P>But pray revd sir▪ have the parliament any right to make laws for us? And isn't this a grievance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fill.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, there was a Boston minister, and another gentle∣man, lodged at our house last night, and they talk'd a great deal about this very thing, and made it out as clear as the sun at noon-day, that the parliament have no such right; tho' I did not understand them—but I know they argued ve∣ry powerfully and proved that we ought to resist. However, I don't like taking up arms neither, that I must own.</P>

<P>Hold, hold, neighbour <HI>Trim,</HI> you are not to take liberties with my cloth because I do myself. But to proceed— In considering this question of the right of parliament to make laws to bind us, I shall observe the distinction made by Mr. <HI>Pitt,</HI> Mr. <HI>Dickinson,</HI> Mr. <HI>Wilkes,</HI> Mr. <HI>Otis,</HI> and all other advocates for the rights of the Colonies, between <HI>legislation</HI> and <HI>taxation</HI>—they say there must necessarily be a supreme power, lodg'd somewhere, of governing and regulating the trade of the Colonies; and this is in the King, Lords and Commons of Great-Britain, but that this does not extend to <HI>internal taxes,</HI> tho' it includes the right of laying <HI>duties</HI> on such articles of trade, as they allow us to import, if we choose to import them—and upon this distinction was founded our opposi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion to the unhappy stamp-act—we then acknowledged the authority of parliament, in it's full extent, excepting on∣ly in the matter of <HI>internal taxation;</HI> tho' it is very true, we have since been daily growing wiser and wiser, 'till at length, we openly avow principles of <HI>absolute independency,</HI> and deny that the parliament of Great-Britain have any more
<PB N="12" REF="014454_0012_0F928F70E81E91A0"/>
<HI>rightful authority</HI> over us, than the parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> or the divan of <HI>Constantinople.</HI> And the grand argument in sup∣port of this new doctrine is, that our <HI>charter</HI> is a <HI>compact</HI> between the king and our ancestors, by which the <HI>sole</HI> power of legislation is given forever to our general assembly. And in answer to this it is said, that it never was in the <HI>power</HI> of the king to put any British subjects out of the jurisdiction of parliament, and therefore, if he had given such a charter, it would be void; but it is said further, that it is not true in fact; for that no such grant of a supreme, independant, un∣controlable power of legislation is, or ever was contained in the charter. Now, if such a power he convey'd by the char∣ter, it is either <HI>expressed</HI> or <HI>implied</HI>—that it is not <HI>expressed</HI> is too clear to be deny'd—and therefore it must be <HI>implied,</HI> or it is not convey'd by the charter, but is merely imaginary. This is a question of the highest importance to every man who has got a head, or any property to save or to lose; for the principle, if wrong, leads directly to <HI>treason</HI> and <HI>rebellion</HI>; to which we are hastening with a rapidity which, I greatly fear, will soon plunge us headlong in irretrievable ruin, unless we are stopt in our career. In order to a right understanding of this important matter, it is necessary to go back and con∣sider how the case stood before, at, and eversince the time of our receiving the charter;—And from this view we shall also perceive whether the present claim of parliament is new, as many ignorantly suppose, or whether it was made, openly and expresly, before the grant of the charter, and has ever since been uniformly exercised by them, and acknowledged by us. To satisfy myself in this matter, I have made a journey to Boston, on purpose to see the statutes at large; and I find the case to be thus. In 1650, an act of parliament was made for blocking up the ports of <HI>Barbados, Virginia, Bermudas</HI> and <HI>Antigua,</HI> in which the supreme authority of parliament over all the Colonies is most clearly and expresly claimed, and it is declared "that they are, and ought to be, subor∣dinate to, and dependant upon England; and have, ever since the planting thereof, been, and ought to be subject to such laws, orders and regulations, as are, or shall be made by the parliament of England.—<HI>Any letters patent, or other authority formerly granted or given, to the contrary notwith∣standing.</HI>" This was during the protectorship of <HI>Oliver Cromwell.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>In 1663, under the reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the se∣cond, was passed <HI>An act for the encouragement of trade</HI>—in which is this very remarkable clause—"And in regard his majesty's plantations beyond the seas are inhabited and peo∣pled by his <HI>subjects</HI> of this <HI>kingdom of England;</HI> for the maintaining a greater correspondence and kindness between them, and keeping them in a <HI>firmer dependance</HI> upon it, and rendering them yet more beneficial and advantageous unto it, in the further employment and increase of English shipping and seamen, vent of English woollen and other manufactures and commodities, rendering the navigation to and from the same, more safe and cheap, and making this kingdom a staple, not only of the commodities of those plantations, but also of the commodities of other countries and places, for the supplying of them; and it being the usage of other nations to keep their plantation-trade to themselves:" &amp;c. Our charter was grant∣ed by King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> in 1692, which im∣powers the general-court to make laws "so as the same be not repugnant or contrary to the laws of the realm of Eng∣land." And in 1696, during the same glorious reign, an act of parliament was made extending all the acts of trade to the Colonies, and requiring all governors and commanders in chief, "to take a solemn oath to do their utmost, that all the clau∣ses, matters and things contained in that and former acts of parliament, relating to the colonies and plantations be punctu∣ally and <HI>bonâ fide</HI> observed." And it is therein expresly enacted, "That all laws, by-laws, usages and customs, at this time, or which hereafter shall be in practice, or endeavor∣ed or pretended to be in force or practice, in any of the said plantations, which are in any wise repugnant to the before-mentioned laws or any of them, so far as they do relate to the said plantations, or any of them, or which are any ways re∣pugnant to this present act, or to any other law hereafter to be made in this kingdom, so far as such law shall relate to and mention the said plantations, are illegal, null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever." Thus it appears that two and forty years before the grant of our charter, the jurisdicti∣on
<PB N="14" REF="014454_0014_0F928F726C2F3010"/>
of parliament over us▪ was openly and explicitly claimed; and again, twenty nine years before; and then in the charter itself, this supreme jurisdiction is expresly reserved; and four years after it is again confirmed in the most positive terms, and all governors bound by an oath to see it submitted to. Now, when we consider this claim, openly and repeatedly made, be∣fore, at, and immediately after, the granting and accepting of the charter, if the charter can be view'd in the light of a <HI>compact,</HI> is not this evidently one essential article of the agree∣ment, on our part, namely, that we will acknowledge and sub∣mit to the jurisdiction of parliament? It is plain we accepted the charter under this condition. How then can this, with the least colour of truth, be called a <HI>new</HI> claim? Especially, when this right of parliament, has not only been thus amply <HI>claimed,</HI> but has been all along <HI>exercised,</HI> in various in∣stances, and without any opposition, denial or question on our part—and this I find to be the case in fact—for, from the time of our charter, in every reign, acts of parliament have been continually making, imposing duties, and for re∣gulating the trade, manufactures and internal government and police of this and the other Colonies;—thus, duties have been imposed and paid upon sugar, rum, molasses, coffee, wines, &amp;c. and on the other hand, bounties and premiums have been granted on various articles; the trade of hatters, and the manufacture of iron, by flitting mills, has been regu∣lated and restrained—wool prohibited from being water-born —the post-office erected—the rates of coin established—the cuting of pine trees prohibited—lands made liable to the pay∣ment of debts—the statute of wills extended to the Colonies— the paper currency remained—in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ented servants impowered to in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist—troops raised nere made subject to the articles of war—acts of assembly made void—and in divers other instan∣ces has this supreme right of parliament been exercised and acquiesced in, continually, without interruption, from the usurpation of <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> to the reign of <HI>George</HI> the third.</P>

of a compact as you seem to suppose, why I'm free to own, that I don't see so much reason to complain; but then how can that be?

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>My opinion is this. Before the late tea act was made, no tea could be shipped to America, unless the merchant first paid a duty of <HI>one shilling</HI> sterling a pound; and this du∣ty was paid <HI>in England,</HI> and the merchant took the risque of it's ever reaching America. This made tea so dear, that the Dutch could greatly undersell the English East India compa∣ny; and the American merchants, at least some of them, found their account in purchasing tea of the Dutch, and run∣ning it here; wherefore to enable the English to sell as cheap as the Dutch, the parliament took off <HI>nine pence</HI> of the duty, and left only <HI>three pence;</HI> and this is not paid before the tea arrives safe here, but must be paid by the merchant before it is landed. And with the same view, they by another act, ena∣bled the East India company to sell their tea by wholesale, at public auction, in Boston; by this means, if we did not fool∣ishly oppose it, instead of paying from a dollar to eight shillings a pound for tea, we might have it at two pistareens, or half a dollar, at most.</P>

<P>This is a mighty grievance truly; who would not fight rather than be deprived of the liberty of paying treble price for what they buy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the grievance complain'd of lies here. This act laying the three-penny duty on tea, expresly mentions, among other purposes, the <HI>raising a revenue:</HI> This, say we, is taking money out of our pockets without our consent; and it is argued, that if they may do it in this trifling instance, they may do it in all others; and will go on till they leave us nothing. Upon which I would observe, in the first place, that it is not true▪ that this is taking money out of our pockets without our consent; because we are not <HI>compell'd</HI> to buy; and if we <HI>will</HI> buy, the small pittance which we pay for the duty, we pay with our own <HI>consent,</HI> as much as we do any money which we pay for any commodity we buy. The same might as well be said, when we buy a quart of rum, or a dram, for when we pay for it, we pay our proportion of the duty laid by act of parliament on molasses: This we have done a long time, and never found out that it was a <HI>grievance,</HI> or
<PB N="17" REF="014454_0017_0F928F788A381E90"/>
that we were thereby made <HI>slaves</HI>—but the consequence is false and absurd; for it can never follow, that because we submit to a <HI>reasonable</HI> law, therefore we must be call'd to submit to the most <HI>tyrannical, unjust</HI> and <HI>unreasonable</HI> laws. And what is the danger from this law, any more than from other reve∣nue laws to which we have so long submitted? Those laws have all along, in fact, <HI>raised a revenue;</HI> and because this is mentioned in the act, can this possibly alter the case? Yes, say our patriots, this is claiming a right to tax us; but I deny it; for as I have clearly shewn, this is no other claim than has been made, exercised and submitted to, for more than a century: It is essentially different from <HI>taxing</HI> us; for a <HI>tax</HI> is raised by <HI>compulsion,</HI> whether we will or no; but this is a <HI>regulation</HI> of <HI>trade,</HI> by which, though it <HI>may</HI> raise a <HI>revenue,</HI> and is <HI>designed</HI> for this purpose, yet no man ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be <HI>compell'd</HI> to pay any part of it; and if he does, it is his own voluntary act, as much as when he chooses to drink wine or rum, rather than cyder, or to wear English cloth, rather than homesp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n; and they are doing no service to their country, who thus ab∣surdly place <HI>tax acts</HI> and <HI>revenue laws</HI> upon the same footing, and infer a right of <HI>taxation,</HI> from a right of <HI>legislation</HI> in other respects. But further, The tea act, as it is called, was made in the seventh year of the present reign; and the pre∣amble, which I took a copy of, runs thus, "Whereas it is expedient that a <HI>revenue</HI> should be raised in your Majesty's dominions in America, for making a more certain and adequate provision for defraying the charge of the administration of justice, and the support of civil government, in such provinces where it shall be found necessary, and towards further defray∣ing the expences of defending, protecting and securing the said dominions."—Now it is generally supposed, that this <HI>express purpose of raising a revenue,</HI> in the Colonies, is en∣tirely new and unprecedented; but to show that this is a mistake, I will read you a copy of the preamble to an act passed in the fourth year of this reign, which is thus, "Where∣as it is expedient that new provisions and regulations should be established for improving the <HI>revenue</HI> of this kingdom, and for extending and securing the navigation and commerce between Great-Britain and your Majesty's dominions in America, which by the peace have been so happily enlarged: And whereas it is just and necessary that a <HI>revenue be raised</HI> in your Majesty's said dominions in America, for defraying the expences of de∣fending protecting and securing the same," &amp;c. and then the
<PB N="18" REF="014454_0018_0F928F7A15A2E8F0"/>
act goes on to lay duties on sugars, wines, East-India goods, &amp;c. imported from Great-Britain &amp;c. This act has been, and still is, submitted to, without the least complaint. Now I should be glad to know what difference there is between these two preambles, so far as respects the matter of <HI>raising a revenue.</HI></P>

<P>Nay, so long ago ago as the year 1670. In an act made for regulating the plantation trade, one reason expresly assign'd, is that otherwise "the trade of them would, in a great measure be diverted from England, and carried else∣where, and his Majesty's customs and <HI>revenues</HI> much <HI>lessened.</HI>" In short, every <HI>revenue act</HI> is, in the nature of it, <HI>an act</HI> for <HI>raising</HI> a <HI>revenue,</HI> whether it be so express'd or not; and it is trifling at this time of day, to start an objection, which does not carry the force even of a quibble. If it be said that the money raised by this act is misapplied, because our civil offi∣cers are paid out of it; I answer, this is a distinct matter: The monies raised by this, and all other revenue acts, are, and, for more than a century, have been, paid into his Ma∣jesty's exchequer; and if when there, instead of being appli∣ed towards easing British subjects in their taxes, as formerly, they are now applied for our ease, by paying the salaries of our governor, judges, &amp;c. which, otherwise, we must pay by an internal tax on our poles and estates, it seems as if we could have no reason to complain of this as a grievance: However, even though the money when raised was never so grosly <HI>misapplied,</HI> it would by no means affect the legality and constitutional right of <HI>raising</HI> it; these are matters quite di∣stinct and independant of each other.</P>

<P>That the new method of appointing the council, is an alteration of that part of our charter is true, and that the new regulation respecting jurors is different from that pre∣scribed by our province law is also true, but that these are <HI>grievances,</HI> may well be questioned.—The English constitu∣tion has ever been thought by the wisest men of all nations, the best form of government in the whole world—and if so, these two alterations in our constitution are so far from being <HI>grievous,</HI> that they are <HI>benefits,</HI> because they bring us nearer to <HI>perfection</HI>—for our jurors are now to be chosen in the same manner they are in England; and our council being now made independent of the governor and people, and removeable only

by the king, as the governor is, brings them to a much nearer resemblance to the house of lords; and besides, both council and juries are now upon exactly the same footing as they are in New-Hampshire, New-York and all the southern govern∣ment's, and in all the West-India Islands, so that if this makes us <HI>slaves,</HI> all those other governments, as well as England, are, and ever have been, slaves—and the same may be ob∣served of the king's paying his governor and judges, for the case is just the same in all king's governments; and in England likewise, so far as respects the judges—and if we look back to former times, and consider how our council was situated.</P>

<P>That Boston minister, as well as some others, I'm sorry to say it, has much to answer for—he knows b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tter— the Quebec-bill can no more affect our civil or religious liber∣ties, than the laws of Holland can,—what parliament has done is no more than they were bound to do, by every rule of equity and common justice: The Canadians surrendered their country to his Britanni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Majesty upon express condition, among others, that they should enjoy the free exercise of their religion; and to this end, that they should have a Roman-catholic bishop, to be approved of by the king of England— this was one article of the capitulation, expresly agreed to by the general to whom they surrendered—this engagement
<PB N="23" REF="014454_0023_0F928F7CF4CC47F8"/>
is now confirm'd by parliament, and this is all—now it is plain, they are entitled to the enjoyment of their religion, according to the full extent and meaning of this agreement, or their country ought to be restored to them—and if the English go∣vernment intended to comply with their terms of capitulation, ought they not to give them the fullest assurance of it, by confirming them by an act? Surely, if parliament is to be blamed for any thing, it should seem to be rather, that they have not quieted the minds of the Canadians by giving them this assurance before—for we must remember that their religion is as dear to them, as ours is to us, and they have the same right to worship God, in the way they think right, that we claim for ourselves—they have prejudices of education to bless them, as we have; and they have their own natural under∣standings, and their priests to guide them as we have; and they have an equal right with us to the benefit of the gospel rule, "Do to others as ye would they should do unto you". And we should do well to remember that, "with what mea∣sure we mete, it shall be measured unto us again.—In short, the only principles upon which parliament can be arrainged in this instance, are entirely destructive of all liberty of conscience; and in point of common justice, and the faith of nations, they can be found fault with, only upon the malevolent, unjust, diabolical position, which, God forbid Protestants should ever adopt, that no faith is ever to be kept with hereticks.—As to the danger arising to our religion, from this act, it is a mere bugbear, raised to disturb weak minds; for nothing can be more egregiously absurd than to infer, that because the king and parliament from the plain dictates of justice and humanity have comply'd with their most solemn treaty made by their general, and upon the faith of which, an extensive country has been surrendered to them, that therefore the king intends to violate his coronation oath, and break thro' the condition upon which he holds his crown; and that the lords and com∣mons, collected from all parts of England, are joining in this impolitic, iniquitous, foolish design.—Let us turn the tables, and make the present case of the Canadians, our own.—Suppose the king of France had conquer'd New-England, at the time the king of England conquer'd Canada; and we had capitulated upon condition, that we should enjoy our own religion, and choose our own ministers, as we had done from the first set∣tlement of the country to this time; and the French general had agreed to this, as general Amherst did to their terms;
<PB N="24" REF="014454_0024_0F928F7E0D53A2E8"/>
and we had remained ever since under the French government; and when the king of France and his parliament had confirmed this treaty by a law; and the province of Canada should make a clamour, and say the king of France, being governed by his mistresses, intended to introduce the Protestant religion among them: I ask every unprejudiced man, whether he would not think, and say, the Canadians were the most jealous, unrea∣sonable and unjust people under heaven?—I will venture to answer, yes, for every Englishman upon the continent—and are our clamours less unreasonable than theirs would be under similar circumstances? Certainly with what judgment we should judge them, we ought to be judged—but further, whence arises the mighty danger? The act of parliament grants no new liberty; it only confirms what they have enjoy'd for eleven or twelve years, since the conquest, and for a century before; and has Popery spread or prevail'd in any degree in the other Colonies, during that time—or has our religion suffered from the prevalency of that of the Roman catholics in <HI>Virginia,</HI> for many years past—surely people must feel but little of the power and influence of their religion, who fear any danger arising to it, from the bare <HI>toleration</HI> of any <HI>other religion</HI> in any <HI>other part</HI> of the globe. In short, it is plain, beyond a possibility of doubt, that this innocent and just act of parliament is gree∣dily catch'd at, by your deceivers, as a lucky prop to a cause which has no foundation, but in delusion; and consequently, is in danger of falling every moment—they have persuaded you that the two grand objects for which men in society, will fight, if they ever fight, are now at stake, viz. <HI>religion</HI> and <HI>property.</HI></P>

England is a powerful state by sea, su∣perior to all the rest of the world combined; she can block up all our harbors, and prevent all foreign imports, and cut off all communications between the Colonies by sea; by this means we may at once be cut off from all supplies of cloath∣ing, grain▪ <HI>rum</HI>▪ sugar, molasses, <HI>salt,</HI> ammunition, fish, and every article of foreign trade, either for our own necessary consumption, or for re-exportation; the shipping of the pro∣vince may all be made lawful prize, and every sea-port town be laid in ruins —By land, with a very few regiments, she may cut off all intercourse between town and town, and go on to lay waste and utterly destroy our houses, barns, fields, cattle, grain and stock of all kinds, until a body can assemble who shall dare to face them in the field: And here arises to our view innumerable difficulties not yet attended to; our wives and Children must be secured; our estates deserted; provisions, arms, ammunition, camp-equipage and other necessaries of war must be provided; leaders skill'd in the art of war must be found; and if we think we have any such among us, what a vast proportion of them will, before the crisis comes on, de∣clare for the loyal side, and what numbers, must we be sure,

will follow them when we reflect, that this is a country of <HI>property,</HI> and consider what will be the certain consequences of a defeat: For the punishment of open traitors and rebels is not, and cannot be, governed by any certain rules of law, but is inflicted summarily, according to the exigence of the times: and what these consequences must be, it is shocking to humanity to consider▪ Suppose a battle, and numbers slain and the rest put to flight, what maltitudes must be sacrificed in the subsequent pursuit; what numbers taken prisoners, impaled and gibbetted from unavoidable necessity; and what then becomes of their wives and helpless innocent children; and of the aged and infirm; for then it will be impossible to make those distinctions which humanity would wish for, but one general calamity must involve the innocent, if such there are, with the guilty—but suppose by a lucky accident, a body of the King's forces, should be worsted, how long would it be before they would appear again with an irresistable force, and with a resentment that would mark the whole country with desolation and misery; imagine to yourselves, an indivi∣dual head of a family, mortally wounded in battle, but lin∣gering in the pangs of death—what would be his bitter reflec∣tions, and how would he condemn his own rashness, and folly in that awful interval; in some such plaintive moans as these, may we well suppose, he would breathe out his life.—"What have I done, foolish man that I was—why did I blindly rush upon certain ruin—now that my passions are cooled, and rea∣son, alas! too late, has resumed her seat, all those imaginary grievances disappear—I now die a traitor and rebel by the laws of my country—my estate is forfeited—my affectionate wife and our innocent babes, the sweet pledges of our loves— how have I, who ought to have been their guide and protec∣tor —how have I left them friendless, forlorn, destitute of the means of procuring daily bread—to what hardships, dangers and distresses have I abandoned them—O my God, how shall I look up in this hour of torture—take them, O take them under thy protection—for they are innocent of the heavy crime that now weighs down the soul of their unhappy husband and father."</P>

of justice; and to compel one, two or at most three counsel∣lors, appointed by the King, to resign their seats at the board, which seats they either h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> never accepted, or if they had, their resignations were void and of no effect,— Other bodies of wiseacres have assembled, in warlike array, for the heroic purpose of compelling an aged, infirm justice, who had sign'd an address, to <HI>recant</HI>; that is, to set his name to an infamous lie, fabricated, in general, if they have been truly retailed in the news papers, by heroes in their <HI>cups,</HI> incapable of spelling or reasoning. And in those instances where the devoted vic∣tims, have either secreted themselves, or had resolution enough to appear and refuse▪ like Shadrach, Meshech and Abednego, to fall down and worship the <HI>brazen</HI> image, some have been deny'd the common rights of humanity; such as having coin ground for the daily bread of themselves and families; others the common privileges and conveniences of society, such as employing laborerers for hire, to reap mow, thresh, &amp;c nay the very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umb beasts of some, have been deny'd the common rights of nature; an instance of this kind happened in the coun∣ty of Middlesex, where an unfortunate addresser having a cow, sent her over to his neighbor, a deacon, who was the owner of a bull, and to whom he had▪ for some years, sent all his cows in the like exigencies; but the pious deacon, animated with a holy zeal against Lord <HI>North</HI> and Gov. <HI>Hutchinson,</HI> warmed with the steams of <HI>modern patriotism,</HI> and free from the infir∣mity of <HI>universal benevolence,</HI> swore <HI>his</HI> bull should not bull a <HI>tory</HI> cow; and accordingly the poor cow returned home burn∣ing incontinently with a flame, which the more humane bull would gladly have quenched, but for the heated patriotism of the good deacon, his master.</P>

<P>In all parts of the province, we have seen instances of this egregious folly of the mob, in compelling addressers to Gov. <HI>Hutchinson,</HI> and to his present excellency Gen. <HI>Gage,</HI> to recant; just as if such forced recantations could persuade the world that such addressers did <HI>not</HI> address! The actors in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese tragi comi sarcical scenes have no meaning at all; in them it is all the effect of rum and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>p: Their abettors mean to make admistration believe that we are all of one mind; but their folly is glaring; a band of highway robbers might as well make the world believe that they and the persons rob'd are all of a mind, by obliging them, when in their power, to sign a confession that they consented to the robbery. People have been guiled, imposed on, and misled long enough; it is

high time for them to look about them; the night is far spent, the day is at hand—the day of reckoning—the day, when the friends and foes, the liege subjects, and the rebels and traitors, to George the third, must be distinguished: And however speciously the leaders may flatter their blind followers with hopes of success in their opposition, by publishing <HI>extracts of letters from England,</HI> they may assure themselves there is not the least reason to suppose that parliament will not support their authority, even to the ruin of the present generation, in this and all the other Colonies, if it can't be established at a less expence: And it is as certain that <HI>submission</HI> is required only to save the <HI>honor</HI> of government; they never intend to tax us; they don't wish to enslave us; they abhor the thought; they want us to be happy and free; but no, we forsooth▪ must quarrel for a <HI>shadow,</HI> under a moral certainty of losing the <HI>substance</HI> in the contest. The people are told by their oracles, that, if they give way now, their chains are rivetted, and such kind of trumpery; but, if they would but open their eyes, they might see that this is mere delusion; let them try the experiment of submitting; and if all their grievances are not redress'd, they may as well take up the cudgels, one or two, or ten years hence, as now. They will have hands and guns <HI>then</HI> as well as <HI>now</HI>; and the deuce is in it, if they don't think their wives, their children, their estates and their necks worth <HI>trying</HI> to save. Some tell them they have been <HI>gui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty of trea∣son already,</HI> they have <HI>put their hands to the plough,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t's too late to look back. This is the langu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge of vile seducers; but it is never too late, in this world, to repent; and the soon∣er the better; they have a gracious King to deal with and a parliament of Britons, who know the value of civil and religi∣ous liberty▪ and can make all due allowances for the sudden extravagancies of Englishmen when first impressed with the fear of losing it; but it must be remembered, that the obstinate perseverance of incorrigible offenders, will put a period to the long suffering even of the Deity. I think I can perceive, that the eyes of many begin to open; I heartily wish they may attain a full view of their danger, before the door of mercy is shut. But I ask pardon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evd sir, for breaking in upon your discourse, and interrupting it so long; the distresses coming upon my country, through the wicked mac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inations of mock patriot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ lie uppermost in my mind; and when I enter upon the subject, I know not where to stop.

<P>I profess, I'm of the same mind; I begin to see things in a different light from what I did: Indeed I never liked the high proceedings of the provincial congr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss; this affair of seiz∣ing the King's monies, and taking the militia out of the hands of the governor, I could never see through; it is against the King's prerogative, and sounds too much like treason; and I'm resolved not to go to the next, if I am chosen.</P>

And as to you, neighbour <HI>Puff,</HI> you have made the wisest speech, and the best resolution you ever made in your life; stand by it, and you may save your bacon yet. I hope my past offences will be forgiven, in consideration of the strength of the temp∣tation; and I'll give them leave to tuck me up, without ce∣remony, if ever I preach up treason and rebellion again, so long as my name's <HI>Trim.</HI></P>
