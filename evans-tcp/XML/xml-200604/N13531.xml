<P>IT may not be amiss to inform the subscri∣bers for the following performance, that a copy was not given at the time it was requested, on account of its containing several passages taken from a larger work which the author has by him, unfinished. Upon farther consideration however, it is thought not improper to present to the Public a specimen of that work, in this incorrect manner, that a conjecture may be form∣ed what success it may meet, when the whole shall make its appearance. The passages are those that respect the affairs of America at large, and the future progress of Society. As to the other parts of the Poem which are consined to the state of education in Connecticut, although the subject may be thought too particular to be relished beyond the limits of a Commencement Auditory, yet if they should serve to turn the atten∣tion of any part of the Public to the real situation of Yale College, it may justify the publication.</P>

<L>ONCE more, thou sacred Seat, the changing year</L>
<L>Hath circled heaven and bid the day appear,</L>
<L>That opes thy portals, gilds thy spiry dome,</L>
<L>And calls thy children from their joyous home.</L>
<L>Thro' seven long years hath war's terrific power</L>
<L>Rang'd every town and crimson'd every shore,</L>
<L>Pursu'd fair Science from each happy seat,</L>
<L>Rav'd in her domes and forc'd her last retreat,</L>
<L>And oft, Yalensia, doom'd thy final fall,</L>
<L>While thy sad Genius trembled for thy wall.</L>
<L>Now see, at last, the venerable train,</L>
<L>Thine elder sons ascend thy courts again!</L>
<L>We joy the reverend, happy throng to see,</L>
<L>We wake thy own blest Muse, and bid her sing to thee.</L>
<L>Long have we liv'd beneath thy nurturing care,</L>
<L>And joy and friendship crown'd our labors there;</L>
<L>No more within those blissful haunts we dwell,</L>
<L>To all thy train we bid a long farewel;</L>
<L>One gentle grasp, one silent, sorrowing tear,</L>
<L>And joys and friends forever disappear;</L>
<L>Fate calls us hence the world's broad stage to tread,</L>
<L>Act a short part, and mingle with the dead.</L>
<L>We go—but may thy glory still ascend,</L>
<L>Thy fame, thy virtues thro' the world extend;</L>
<L>Thy future sons, a calm, delightful throng,</L>
<L>As following years shall lead their steps along,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="017090_0004_0F9FC2C9BADA8B28"/>To peace, to happiness, to glory rise,</L>
<L>Shine thro' the earth and brighten in the skies.</L>
<L>No russian force that treads the distant shore,</L>
<L>Shall dare invade thy peaceful labors more;</L>
<L>While the proud foes beneath our standards yield,</L>
<L>And our brave brethren claim the crimson field,</L>
<L>Within thy courts shall pride and slaughter cease,</L>
<L>And genius dignify the walks of peace.</L>
<L>And oh! may some blest hand regard thy cries,</L>
<L>Some great, some liberal benefactor rise,</L>
<L>Whose soul awakes at thy inspiring call,</L>
<L>To lift thy spires, enlarge thy scanty wall,</L>
<L>Who joys to aid the Muse's feeble voice,</L>
<L>And bid bright learning in her sons rejoice,</L>
<L>Bid wealth and dignity thy steps attend,</L>
<L>And rival arts and rival virtues blend,</L>
<L>O'er all the happy land thy beauties shine,</L>
<L>And every joy, and every wish be thine.</L>
<L>Ye patriot worthies, whom these strains assail,</L>
<L>Ye Reverend Sires, and all ye sons of Yale,</L>
<L>Behold our seat, by former bounty given,</L>
<L>Pride of our land and favorite child of heaven,</L>
<L>Whence liberal arts and liberal thoughts ye drew,</L>
<L>When few her children and her wants were few;</L>
<L>Now see, the narrow bounds can scarce contain</L>
<L>Half the throng'd numbers of her joyous train,</L>
<L>While every friend averts th' unconscious eye,</L>
<L>And power, and interest pass unheeding by.</L>

<L>And evening mists and distant fires arose,</L>
<L>Far in a gloomy grove I pensive stray'd,</L>
<L>Where death's pale phantoms walk'd the midnight shade,</L>
<L>Thin clouds of sickening damps, o'er ether driven,</L>
<L>Obscur'd the stars and shut the eye from heaven;</L>
<L>Unwonted sighs within my bosom rose,</L>
<L>Cities o'erturn'd and all my country's woes</L>
<L>Pour'd on my heart; but chief thy feeble cries,</L>
<L>Neglected Science, bade my griefs arise.</L>
<L>I saw, from Briton's Isle, thy genius flown,</L>
<L>In these fair climes to fix a nobler throne,</L>
<L>While here thy sons the peaceful myrtle yield,</L>
<L>To pluck the crimson laurel of the field.</L>
<L>I saw thy seats to scenes of slaughter turn'd,</L>
<L>Thy walls defac'd, thy fairest labours burn'd;</L>
<L>E'en Yale, thy loveliest handmaid, now no more,</L>
<L>Knew the gay smiles of youth she knew before,</L>
<L>Her funds decreas'd, her strength, her int'rest fled,</L>
<L>Her friends neglectful, and her <HI>Hosmer</HI> dead.</L>
<L>Now a calm splendor burst the saddening gloom,</L>
<L>And gales etherial breath'd a glad perfume,</L>
<L>Mild in the midst a form celestial shone,</L>
<L>Rob'd in the vestments of the rising sun;</L>
<L>Tall rose his stature, dignity and grace</L>
<L>Mov'd in his limbs and wanton'd in his face,</L>
<L>His folding mantle slow'd in easy pride,</L>
<L>His harp divine lay useless by his side,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="017090_0006_0F9FC2CEAF7FE1B0"/>His locks in curls from myrtle chaplets hung</L>
<L>And sounds melodious melted from his tongue.</L>

<L>Nor think fair Science left her heaven in vain.</L>
<L>A while my skill must guide the wild affray,</L>
<L>Range the red field and sweep thy foes away,</L>
<L>Soon shall this arm a milder sceptre bear,</L>

<L>Her sons and friends, a numerous concourse, meet;</L>
<L>Once more to view her, greet her youthful train,</L>
<L>And hear her feeble, saddening voice complain.</L>
<L>Go thou, in pride of youth, attend them there,</L>
<L>And these commands in strains melodious bear.</L>
