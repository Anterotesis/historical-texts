<HEAD>AT A GENERAL COURT ON ADJOURNMENT, Held at <HI>Boston,</HI>
<DATE>March, <HI>14. 1682.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>THis Court considering the Solemn Warnings of Pro∣vidence; both by Signs in the Heavens, and the various Instances and Effects of Divine Displea∣sure, which we have felt formerly and of late, by Sword, Fire, Blastings, Losses at Sea, Sicknesses and Deaths of many Eminent and Ʋseful Persons amongst us; and those Difficult Circumstances we have been, and are yet labou∣ring under, with respect to our Publick Affairs: As also the Troubles of the People of God, and Low and conflicting Condition of the Protestant Interest in <HI>Christendom;</HI> And knowing that our Sins against, and Provocations of the Lord (which yet visibly increase amongst us) are the procuring Causes thereof, and for which, without Reformation, we may yet justly expect greater and more Ʋniversal Calamityes; And that the onely Means for the a∣verting Impending Judgement, and lengthening out of our Tran∣quillity, are Sincere Humiliation and Repentance,</P>
<P><HI>Do therefore Appoint the Tenth of</HI> May <HI>next for a Day of Solemn</HI> HƲMILIATION <HI>throughout this Colony, therein humbly to implore the Mercy and Favour of God for our selves here in respect of our Sacred, Civil, and Temporal Concerns; and more especially those in the Hands of our A∣gents abroad; as also for those Kingdoms, upon whose VVel∣fare our own doth so nearly depend; and for the Protestant Churches and Interest elsewhere. And all Ministers are de∣sired to give timely Notice to their People in their respective Churches and Towns, that they may be the better Prepared to attend upon the VVork of the Day, according to the Nature thereof, and the Solemn Calls of God thereunto. And all People are Forbidden servile Labour upon that Day.</HI></P>
