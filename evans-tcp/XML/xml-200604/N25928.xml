<BIBL><HI>GOLDSMITH.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a common place observation "that man is born with a capacity to enjoy happiness." Each one believes this true in theory, and imagines, how∣ever others have failed of practically verifying it, he shall certainly be an illustrious instance of its ex∣emplification. His predecessor has blindly mistaken the way, and he has found it; but at the close of life, when he is taking a retrospective view of his journey, he finds that he has been pursuing a phan∣tom, like those who went before him, and while, with the wise man, he exclaims that "all is vanity," he feels, on his dying bed, experimental evidence, that the only real "good under the sun, is for a man to eat, and drink, and enjoy the fruit of his labour, for that is the gift of God."</P>
<P>Something here is in the wrong. Either happi∣ness is not to be obtained in this world, or those who seek it mistake the road which leads to it. Un∣doubtedly the former is the fact—though I believe, much more felicity might be enjoyed than there is, if people knew how to seek for it. If the intellectu∣al
<PB N="4" REF="034482_0003_0FFDE742E93996C0"/>
faculties of man, did not participate in his joys and sorrows, his tranquility would but rarely be dis∣turbed, where objects for sensual gratification were within his reach. Having satisfied the claims of hunger and thirst, and protected his body from in∣clement seasons, his remaining care would be, to sooth the calls of sensuality, by indulgence to the full. But this is not the case. Man is created with a sensual, and a mental, capacity for enjoyment.— These are not unfrequently in direct opposition at each other, where the senses desire what reason disapproves. Notwithstanding they are often at variance, yet they are perfectly reconcilable; and when in harmony, a rational indulgence of the one, will contribute much to the gratification of the o∣ther. But the passions get the start in infancy, and by the time that reason begins to exercise its influ∣ence, they have generally become so headstrong, that they turn a deaf ear to her advice, and like Je∣hu, drive furiously after their enemy.</P>
<P>The infant scarcely opens its eyes before it cries for the moon. It is a pleasing object to its sight, and reason has not yet taught it to know the im∣possibility of its indulgence. The school-boy finds his gratification, at times, in his bow and arrow, in his popgun, in his skates, his hoop and his whistle— and, although actual possession at this time of life, affords more lasting contentment, than at any sub∣sequent period, yet, even now, it is fleeting; it fades with the novelty of its object, and is forgotten almost as soon as known. How soon will the boy forget his whistle, when his comrade produces a jews harp? And how readily does the jews-harp give place to the top? as childhood draws to a close, the childish sports are laid aside, and the young man places his happiness in his horses, his beauty, the favorable reception which he may meet with among the young ladies, or on some other object equally
<PB N="5" REF="034482_0003_0FFDE742E93996C0"/>
trivial. It is not enough that he possesses these— but they must be pre-eminently his. So long as his horse is the handsomest and most the subject of com∣mendation, he is contented with it. But no sooner does his townsmen appear with a handsomer horse, and a fine new chaise, than his own looses half its value, and immediately he sets his thoughts at work to invent how he can surpass his comrade in both. Suppose he does it. His happiness is again dissipated the moment he sees an acquaintance in his phaeton, drawn by his span and driven by his servant.— Should he procure these, his felicity would again be destroyed by the first coack and four which he saw.</P>
<P>A small part even of our temporal happiness con∣sists in actual possession. While an object of desire is contemplated in futurity, we behold in it nothing but that which promises pleasure. When obtained, though it may possess all that which made it desira∣ble while at a distance, it is found usually to possess more. The rose blossoms on a briar bush, and the sun too long beheld, destroys the sight. To illus∣trate the foregoing, we will turn our thoughts, for a moment, to a child, and follow him in his progress to old age. His first great wish, which promises fe∣licity, is to have his petticoats exchanged for a boy's dress. He soon wants a penknife, a top or a pair of skates. These afford him no permanent satisfac∣tion, until he can open the first, spin the second, and run upon the third. After he has learned these, do they satisfy him? No; he now longs to be of age. At twenty-one years, he wants to be in bu∣siness by himself, to have a house, and to be married. A wife cannot render him contented without chil∣dren. Is he contented with these? He now must have an estate to educate them, and to secure them from poverty, if he should die during their child∣hood. How many anxieties does he feel on their account? If one of them is sick, the parent takes
<PB N="6" REF="034482_0004_0FFDE744A4BAB1D8"/>
no rest until he thinks him out of danger. When he is in health, his solicitude is transferred to some other concern for the good of his child. After his children are reared up to manhood, he is uneasy un∣til they are married and settled in life. His next wish must be gratified, for without it, this is of no importance; he must see their children▪ and be con∣vinced that his name will be perpetuated to posteri∣ty; else all his former cares, and anxieties, are not worth the trouble they have cost. Does this grati∣fy him? Is he now ready to resign up all to them, and be laid down in peace? No; all the solicitude, the disappointments, and mortifications, he has met with in this world, do not alienate his affections from life; nor does his experience yet make him feel that permanent happiness cannot be procured. He will <HI>tell</HI> you that it cannot, before he is ten years old, but he never practically believes it until on his deathbed. I have known a man, of nearly four score years, who had lived in sorrow all his days, and had struggled with poverty and sickness, during his whole life, who had been blind for about a year. Often has he told me, that all the troubles of his life were not half so burthensome as the loss of his eye sight. He had enjoyed it longer than the period usually allotted to man, and it had served him only to witness scenes of pain and wretched∣ness; yet he thought that if he could only have his sight restored to him, if it was but just enough for him to walk about, he should be <HI>perfectly happy.</HI>— Just such creatures we are. When we possess a blessing, we know not how valuable it is, nor how much our happiness depends upon it, until we are deprived of it. Some future good allures us; and, when obtained, we find it not to possess <HI>that</HI> for which we so earnestly sought it; and away our wishes fly to something <HI>still remote</HI>—which, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>btained, serves us in the same manner. And if
<PB N="7" REF="034482_0004_0FFDE744A4BAB1D8"/>
we were to push on, like Alexander the Great, to the conquest of the world, like him, we should sit down and cry when it was vanquished; not because we had possessions enough, but because there would be <HI>nothing more to seek for.</HI></P>
<P>Providence has so formed us, and so variegated our lives, with good and evil, pleasure and pain, happiness and misery, that we may not become so attached to this world, as to be unwilling to pre∣pare for another. He has sent us here as guests to an entertainment, in which there are nourishing and poisonous ingredients. He has taught us how to distinguish between them—has set before us the strongest motives to improve the one, and to shun the other, and left us to exercise our own discreti∣on. Such was the case with Eve, and such has been the case with all of her descendants. The forbidden fruit "was fair to look upon," and she eat it; and by eating it, she lost paradise—tainted the whole of her descendants, and, from her, they inherit the same disposition. They, like her, wan∣der about in pursuit of happiness. She enjoyed it in paradise, and knew it not until it was forfeited. When forfeited, she sought in vain to find it on earth. She lost it for her children, and they will, like her, seek it in vain, unless they pursue it in that road which will re-conduct them to paradise.</P>

<HEAD>THE MATRIMONIAL CREED.</HEAD>
<P>WHOSOEVER will be married, before all things it is necessary that he hold the conju∣gal faith; and the conjugal faith is this: That there were two rational beings created, both equal, and yet one superior to the other—and the inferi∣or shall bear rule over the superior; which faith, except every one keep whole, and undefiled, with∣out doubt, he shall be scolded at everlastingly.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="034482_0005_0FFDE74757203250"/>The man is superior to the woman and the wo∣man is inferior to the man; yet both are equal, and the woman shall govern the man.</P>
<P>The woman is commanded to obey the man, and the man ought to obey the woman; and yet there are not two obedients, but one obedient.</P>
<P>For there is one dominion nominal of the husband, and another dominion real of the wife.</P>
<P>And yet there are not two dominions but one dominion.</P>
<P>For, like as we are compelled by the christian verity to acknowledge, that wives must submit themselves to their husbands, and be subject to them in all things;</P>
<P>So we are forbidden by the conjugal faith to say, that they should be at all influenced by their wills, or pay regard to their commands.</P>
<P>The man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man;</P>
<P>Yet the man shall be the slave of the woman, and the woman the tyrant of the man:</P>
<P>So that in all things, as aforesaid, the subjection of the superior to the inferior is to be believed.</P>
<P>He, therefore, that will be married, must thus think of the woman and the man.</P>
<P>Furthermore, it is necessary to submissive matri∣mony, that he also believe rightly the infallibility of the wife.</P>
<P>For the right faith is, that we believe and con∣fess, that the wife is fallible and infallible;</P>
<P>Perfectly fallible and perfectly infallible; of an erring soul and unerring mind subsisting; fallible, as touching human nature; and infallible, as touch∣ing her female sex.</P>
<P>Who, although she be fallible and infallible, yet she is not two, but one woman; who submitted to lawful marriage to acquire unlawful dominion, and
<PB N="9" REF="034482_0005_0FFDE74757203250"/>
promised religiously to obey, that she might rule with uncontroled sway.</P>
<P>This is the conjugal faith; which, except a man believe faithfully, he cannot be married.</P>

<HEAD>HAPPINESS: NOW JUDGED OF.</HEAD>
<P>IMPERFECTLY can we judge of real happiness or misery from external appearance.—We are sedu∣ced and deceived by that false glare which prosperi∣ty throws around bad men; we are tempted to imi∣tate their crimes, in order to partake of their ima∣gined felicity.</P>
<P>The pageant of grandeur displayed to public view, is not the ensign of certain happiness. We must follow the great man into the retired apart∣ment, where he lays aside his disguise, in order to form any just conclusion. We must have a facul∣ty by which we can look into the inside of hearts; then should we behold good men in pro∣porti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to their goodness, satisfied and easy; attr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cious sinners always restless and unhappy.

<HEAD>GAMING.</HEAD>
<P>GAMING is the curse that spreads the widest, and sticks the closest to the present times: All ranks and degrees of people are infected with it; it is the livelihood of many, and so countenanced by all, that it is almost scandalous to forbear it, and esteemed down-right ill-breeding to expose it. But where∣ever you are, if cards are called for, let it be a signal for you to take your leave. Nor let the proposal of a trifling stake be a bait to induce you to sit
<PB N="10" REF="034482_0006_0FFDE748E47F4EB8"/>
down: Adventurers heat themselves by play, as cowards by wine; and he that began timorously, may, by degrees, surpass the whole party in rash∣ness and extravagance. Besides, as avarice is one of our strongest passions, so nothing flatters it more than play. Good success has an almost irresistable charm, and ill prompts us to put all to the hazard, to recover our losses; either way, nothing is more infatuating, or destructive.</P>
<P>This is but a faint sketch of the mischiefs attend∣ing gaming, even upon the square; but, where it is otherwise, which often happens, as numbers have found to their cost, what can save the wretched bubble from imminent and inevitable ruin; or who can enumerate the snares, the blinds, the lures em∣ployed by sharpers, to entrap their prey, and ratify the premeditated mischief? To be safe, then, keep out of the possibility of danger. Strangers, how∣ever dazzling their appearance, are always to be mistrusted. Even persons who prided themselves on their birth, rank and fortune, have been found confederates with these splendid pick-pockets. And to play with your friends, is an infallible receipt to lose them; for, if you plunder them, they'll aban∣don you with resentment: and, if they plunder you, they'll decline an interview, that must be at∣tended with secret ill-will, if not open reproaches. To avoid all these hazards, play not at all; but, when you find yourself giving way to the dange∣rous temptation, by casting your eyes on those who gain a livelihood by these execrable means, let their detested reputations, and the contempt always con∣nected with them, deter you from the detestable ambition of making your way to fortune by the same infernal road; or, if that reflection proves ineffectual for your preservation, look with horror on the num∣bers of meagre faces that haunt gaming houses, as ghosts are said to do the places where their treasure

<HEAD>THE POOR MAN's APOLOGY For marrying a <HI>POOR WOMAN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MY lot was cast among those to whom fortune deals her favors sparingly: nature, as if to make amends for the niggardliness of the capricious god∣dess, made me heir to a constitution, though not the most robust, equal to the station heaven had allotted to me; and I thought my condition enviable, endu∣ed as I was with fortitude sufficient to encounter poverty in wedlock. All my acquaintance cried shame on the man who had been so blind to his in∣terest, and in the most unreserved terms censured me for shaking hands with beggary. The custom of this thrifty age, indeed, and the oppressive tem∣per of the times, gave a color of justice to a censure apparently dictated by friendship. Nevertheless their remonstrances made but a transient impression on a mind like mine, which had armed itself against the vicissitudes of the world by the following reflec∣tions, previous to the solemn engagement into which I had entered.</P>
<P>Every man who marries without a fortune, pledg∣es himself to the state for his industry; after having turned the matter in my mind, I am the more con∣vinced that my country has a similar claim upon me. But shall I marry to gratify the inclinations of others, perhaps to humor their caprices? or indulge a wish of my own? Some friends I have, who are very importunate with me to be directed by them—one tells me, he has had in his eye for me, ever since my birth, a lady who is immensely rich, but mon∣strously hunchbacked withall, and arrived at the so∣ber age of sixty—from her having been unsolicited
<PB N="12" REF="034482_0007_0FFDE74A79564C88"/>
so long, I must needs suppose her to be the refuge of her whole sex. Now, should I, in a fit of insani∣ty, for nothing short of a derangement of my intel∣lects could urge me to the rash act, link myself to decrepidate, and her disposition be as crooked as her person, where should I hope for redress? Could this friend of mine dissolve the tie, or I recal my words? No, the words are irrevocable, the bond indissoluble, "till death doth us part." To wish that death would step in, to rid me of my incum∣brance, by summoning away my joke fellow, or my∣self, would be sinful; besides that such a wish would be fruitless for she might live long enough to break my heart. At her age, the turbulence of the pas∣sions is supposed to be calmed, it is true; but were the forty years younger, would that better my situa∣tion? Upon consideration I think it would not; by the time a woman sits down to serious housewifery, her marriage portion is spent in the indulgencies, which she expects forsooth in consideration of her dower. Hence I conclude, that my friend, in his recommendation of a wife to me, is actuated by no other motive than his pride, which would be wound∣ed by his owning a poor relative. So help me God then, I will chuse for myself, and woo happiness in a person whose disposition I think congenial to my own.</P>

<HEAD>THE GRUMBLER. <HI>Madeira</HI> is not bad, but RUM is good.</HEAD>
<P>"FOR every creature of God is good." "Rum is one of these creatures." To a man in his right mind it would only be necessary to say <HI>ergo;</HI>
but as this number may light upon some not in a situation to comprehend the whole meaning of <HI>ergo,</HI> I will put the inference in language suited to their capacities, <HI>ergo, Rum is good.</HI> If there is one of my readers who is not in perfect good humour on hearing this phrase, it must be some churlish old bachelor, too nigardly ever to buy rum enough to make himself happy. These reasonings are just, the first quotation is taken from the sacred book, the second is as undeniable as the first; and as to the inference, witness ye dram-drinkers who love a <HI>good suck</HI> in the morning—witness ye bucks and blades, who sit in the tavern and drink rum nekus till your vociferous brawls set the house in an uproar —witness ye tavern hunters, who spend your time and your estates in defence of this great, but simple truth that rum is good. Rum is good, and so is Arsenic, and a man who prefers a sudden death to a lingering one would sooner swallow the latter than the former. I speak of the immoderate use of rum. Rum is good—for a wound—a dislocated limb—and a thousand other things; but swallowed in large draughts, is as certain death as arsenic.— To depict the whole catalogue of evils which attend the free use of rum, is beyond my abilities, and would do no good. It has been done a thousand times to no purpose. There are men who drink too much rum: There are others who do not drink enough—at each of these I shall grumble. As I have taken a parson's text, I may as well take his mode too, and divide my work into firstlys and se∣condlys: And</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="034482_0008_0FFDE74D59BF7DE0"/>Firstly, In grumbling at those who drink too much, self-interest is at the bottom. No sooner do I seat myself in my neighbour's house, than he brings out his bottle of rum, orders a picher of wa∣ter, and I must drink a little of his old spirits and water—If it is winter, it will warm my stomach and cure my head ache,—if it is summer, 'its a fine cool∣ing thing, and as good for the head-ache as any thing in the world. The next thing is to visit me and taste my old spirits. Your common six shilling rum does not answer, it must be old spirit. Now as I cannot but just suport my family with the neces∣saries of life, this needless expence is irksome, and complied with, only from a false delicacy. Besides, I shall soon love it. The appetite furnished by na∣ture, is well and easily regulated; but when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce viciated by unwarily getting into such habits as this, there is no knowing where it will end. I wish they would treat me with a cup of cold water.</P>
<P>Secondly, As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o those who do not drink enough— A neighbour called on me a few days since before breakfast on business; the effluvia from a half point of rum met me as soon as he opened his mouth. He is a clever fellow, and a man of some interest; but if he had drank a quart that morning, instead of a half point, his family might have been worth ten times more ten years hence, than they will if he lives ten years. The young "dasher," who has drank enough to make him mischievous, who gets a rail to break open windows, and finds the rail has got him down and will not get off, ought to have drank more; for then he would have fallen before he touch'd the rail, and it easier lying alone than un∣der a rail. Young gentlemen of good fortunes and prospects, who are apt to get high, as they call it, are unpardonable in not drinking more rum.— They can afford it. A little rum or brandy makes

Besides, these boisterous, mischievous fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eks waste their estates, and the example is perni∣cious; because young men of lower rank are apt to think if they imitate a gentleman of fortune, even in his foibles, they shall be gentlemen themselves; whereas if these young gentlemen were to drink deep enough to kill themselves, it would save their estates, and nobody would think of imitating them.</P>

<P>NOthing sooner discover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> imbecility in a man than credulity (this is a sentiment of the celebrated Fiel∣ding).

Weep not, unerring virtue, I greatly bear up against the attacks of scornful inhuman men—they may erect the sharp-poized blade of calumny; and wield the triumphant falchion of slander, but let them remember that their victory is mortal, that yours is the reward of Eternity. The rich man may pride in destroying the only comfort, the virtuous solace of the indigent—his reputation—but let him also remember that the day of retribution will come when all his boasted millions shall not purchase him one moment of the poor man's happiness. "For Death, stern Death doth vastly change the scene!" Where rests the ashes of Alexander, or the manes of Clitus? They are both lost in decay and scattered by the winds of heaven. The master's, perhaps on some cobler's dung-hill, the servant's on the fertile banks of the Granick! The sting of slander, though pungent and mutinous, can only wound the bosom of guilt; but like all other incorrigible vices it sel∣dom attacks those of its own species, but is continu∣ally in ambush for innocence.

<P>WHAT do folks say? is the question—a question that has more influence on the manners of mankind, than all the laws of society. Folks must talk—the more they talk the better.

this discovers the good effect it has. At first we re∣sent the injury; but folks talk again; we then be∣gin to consider whether we have given occasion for the observations; if so, we shall reform, at least be more circumspect in our behaviour. Few of us are such veterans, as to move on in defiance of the good opinion of the people among whom we live.

What great injury is done? our neighbour perceives that we are watching and talking about his conduct in life, and will set a guard over all his actions, lest he give occasion for folks to talk in future. Talk away may friends, and keep talking; enjoy secrecy if you please; no matter; your friend has always his bosom friend to whom he can entrust the secret; and you may be sure it will not fail coming to the ears of the person talked a∣bout: it all tends directly to the formations of man∣ners, and surely must be the only reason why there is so much talking about each other.</P>

<P>IN the book of Ecclesiastes, we find related in a very familiar and simple apologue, the siege of a certain city.

We might suppose that the wealthy citizens would pay liberal tithes to one, by whom their all had been saved. Chaste dames and coy virgins, exulting that their purity had not been violated, by a licentious soldiery, would naturally crowd around their protector, and the blushes of a thousand cheeks attest that modesty had not been injured by the brutal ravisher. But he, who would draw his conclusion, and imagine that even useful poverty must necessarily be recompensed, would prove himself a rash and unobserving man. We might allow the benevolence of his own heart, but what should we think of his knowledge of the hearts

That men are not always grateful for signal favours, that poverty is ever contemptible, even when accompanied by merit, may be learned in the course of every days experience, may be learned from the sequel of the story, which began this sermon.

<P>FROM my attachment to simplicity in writing, I read Sterne more attentively than Stackhouse, and prefer a story in Genesis to a volume of Gibbon.— It appears to me that, notwithstanding the sarcasms of Voltaire, and other French infidels, that mode of writing, which finds a ready way to the heart, was never more successfully atchieved, than by the Ori∣entals. The other evening, as I was turning over agreeably to my usual practice, the pages of scrip∣ture, I dwelt with undescribable pleasure upon cer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain passages in the life of the patriarch Abraham. I had passed the afternoon, in what is called modish company, and yet could not avoid remarking that the extreme selfishness of men and women <HI>of the world,</HI> led them, even at a moment, when they as∣sembled for ostentatious civility, to behave discour∣teously. If such rudeness, I murmured to myself, be in a refined age, let me view the behaviour of those of old time, before dancing masters were dis∣covered, and when the message cards were not sent by one Patriarch's lady to another. I found as I expected, that even herdsmen and shepherds had as

much genuine politeness as Lord Chesterfield, and that a country maiden, the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, could behave with as much pro∣priety, as though she had been educated in a boar∣ding school. The story of this pastoral girl's con∣duct I wish to tell at large, and with that the deli∣cacy of fashionable readers would allow me, on this occasion, so much pedantry as to quote the original. But, as a whole chapter in Genesis might appear too long, and disproportionate for a short sermon, I will attempt to narrate in my own words.</P>
<P>Abraham a most affectionate parent, perceiving that his life declined, and zealous with the anxiety of old age, for an establishment for Isaac, intreats a confidential steward of the household, that he would not suffer the inexperienced heart of his son to be captivated by the Canaanitish beauties. At the ear∣nest request of the patriarch, the servant binds him∣self to solicit for Isaac a wife of his own rank, reli∣gion, and country. After sanctioning this promise by one of the most tremendeous oaths among the Jewish usages, he harnesses his camels, and departs for Mesopotamia. On his arrival at the suburbs of Nahor, a city of that country, fatigued with a te∣dious journey, and tender of his drudging camels, he makes them kneel by a well of water, to take their necessary refreshment. In this weary moment, Re∣bekah appears; and the first accents that fall from the parched tongue of the traveller, were to solicit a little water from the pitcher, which she carried, "<HI>And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also.</HI>"</P>

Her father was of a sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k abundantly respectable, for he was allied to Abraham, and her brother was the opulent Laban, whose cattle strayed on a thou∣sand hills. Engaged in domestic duty, she meets a stranger, in the garb, probably of a hireling, as he is called, in the text "servant," be grimmed with dust, and having no claim to her favor. She is asked for water, which she cheerfully gives, and the careless reader will not be aware of the extent of the obli∣gation, if he had not surveyed a map of Palestine, and adverted to the sandiness and thirst of the soil. In that arid region, a brook was a more joyous sight to a panting shepherd, than a bumper would be now to the votary of wine. The invaluable well spring eagerly sought, and abstinately contended for, by different tribes, was, from the nature of the earth, at such a distance below the surface, that to obtain water was a work both of toil and time. But, for∣getting her home, forgetting herself, and "dis∣daining little delicacies," she thinks only of the suf∣ferings of the way-faring stranger, and with that "<HI>kind charity</HI>" which the Apostle emphasizes, with that genuine, disinterested civility, <HI>beyond</HI> the court of Versailles, the tedious descent of the well she re∣peatedly tries, and the cooling pitcher imparts, not only to the man, but even to his unpetitioning beasts. "Drink," says the generous girl, and, trust me that I can feel likewise for your burdened companions, "for I will give thy camels drink also." This was benevolence such as is not generally found. It was eminently disinterested, prompt and diffusive. It was disinterested; for the tongue which she cool∣ed was not that of a youthful gallant, trolling the oily phrases of flattery. He who drained the pitch∣er, which the assiduity of Rebekah filled, was an old man, a servant and a stranger. It was prompt; for she "hasted," and she "ran to do do good; and

<HEAD>"Watchmen, what of the night?"</HEAD>
<P>TO this query of Isaiah the watchmen makes I think but a simple reply; and tells the prophet what, if he had the least smattering of astronomy, he must have well known before, "That the morning com∣eth, and also the night." Any old Almanac could have said as much. I think that night, however sooty and illfavoured it may be pronounced by those who were born under a day star, merits a more par∣ticular description. I feel particularly disposed to arrange some ideas in favour of this sable season.— I know that the majority are litterally blind to its merits, they must be prominent indeed to be discer∣ned by the <HI>closed</HI> eyes of the snores, who think that night was made for nothing but sleep. But the student and the sage are willing to believe that it was formed for higher purposes; and that it not only recruits exhausted spirits but sometimes in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orms inquisitive, and amend wicked ones.</P>

in the morning, and to observe various characters at noon will leave but little time, except the night to digest the one, or speculate upon the other.— The night therefore, is often dedicated to composi∣tion, and while the light of the pale plannets discov∣ers, at his desk the Preacher, more wan than they, he may be heard repeating emphatically with Dr. Young,

He is then alone, he is then at peace. No compan∣ions near, but the silent volumnes on his shelf, no noise abroad, but the click of the village clock, or the bark of the village dog.

However injuriously night is treated by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> moderns, the vigilence of the ancients could n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> overlook its benefits and joys. In as early a recor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as the book of Genesis, I find that Isaac, thoug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he devoted his assiduous days to action, reserve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> speculation till night. "He went out to meditat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the field at the eventide." He chose that sad that solemn hour, to reflect upon the virtues of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> beloved and departed mother. The tumult an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> glare of the day suited not with the sorrow of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> soul. He had lost his most amiable, most genuin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="35" REF="034482_0018_0FFDE770C4B6C980"/>
friend, and his unostentatious grief was eager for privacy and shade. Sincere sorrow rarely suffers its tears to be seen. It was natural for Isaac to se∣lect a season to weep in, which would resemble the color of his fate. The darkness, the solemnity, the stillness of eve were favorable to his melancholy purpose. He forsook therefore the busting tents of his father, the pleasant "south country" and "well of Lahairoi," he went out and pensively meditated on the eventide.</P>
<P>The Grecian and Roman Philosophers firmly be∣lieved that "the dead of midnight is the noon of thought." One of them is beautifully described by the Poet, as soliciting knowledge from the skies, in private and nightly audience, and that neither his theme nor his importunity were forsaken till the sun appeared and dimmed his "nobler intellectual beam." We undoubtedly owe to the studious nights of the ancients most of their elaborate and immortal productions. Among them it was neces∣sary that every man of letters should trim the mid∣night lamp. The day might be given to the Forum or the Circus, but the night was the season for the statesmen to project his schemes, and for the Poet to pour his verse. Night has likewise with great reason been considered in every age as the ostrono∣mer's day. Young observes with energy, that "an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vout astronomer is mad.</HI>" The privilege of contemplating these brilliant and numerous myriads <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> planets which benifit or bedeck our skies is pecul∣lar to night, and it is ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> duty, both as lovers of moral and natural <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>auty, to bless that season, when we a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> indulged with such a gorgeous display of glittering and useful light. It must be confessed that the seclusion, calmness, and tranquility of mid∣night is most friendly, to serious and even airy
<PB N="36" REF="034482_0019_0FFDE774D1EEF140"/>
contemplations. Milton, in one of his poems, says fervently,
<Q><L>Let my lamp, at midnight hour</L>
<L>Be seen in some high lonely tower</L>
<L>—To unfold</L>
<L>What worlds or what vast regions hold,</L>
<L>Th' immortal mind that hath forsook</L>
<L>Her mansion in this fleshly nook.</L></Q></P>
<P>But the night is not only propitious to specula∣tive, but likewise to gay and social men. Even the rigid Dr. Johnson was so convinced that late hours were auxiliary to the <HI>feast of reason and the flow of soul,</HI> that he used to declare "no man, but a scoun∣drel went to bed before midnight." This expres∣sion was perhaps too strong, and he would not have used it, had he lived in a farm house. But his love of the conversation of men of letters and his experi∣ence that fancy is generally most wakeful, when dulness sleeps, tempted him to employ a phrase which must startle every labourer, who, by mere lassitude of limb is compelled early to retire.</P>
<P>But night is friendly to playful no less than to met∣aphysical, and abstract thought, not only the author and statesman watch, but likewise the sons of socia∣bility and glee. Those, who eat "the bread of carefulness," go soon to bed, to digest their meal, and leave the darkened hours to be enjoyed by men of genius, or wasted by men of pleasure. St. Paul avers that they that be drunken are drunken in the night, and I know that its broad mantle is frequent∣ly employed to cover excess from the world. Still, the arrival of night is greeted by many, who wish neither to sleep nor drink it away. Conversation often holds a levee at midnight, and wit and senti∣ment and song like the Fairies, assemble and sport before the cock crow. I think it treason to this sable power, who holds divided empire with day
<PB N="37" REF="034482_0019_0FFDE774D1EEF140"/>
constantly to shut our eyes at her approach.— To long sleep, I am decidedly a foe. As it is ex∣pressed by a quaint writer, we shall all have enough of that in the grave. Those who cannot break the silence of night by vocal throat or eloquent tongue may be permitted to disturb it by a <HI>snore.</HI> But he, among my readers, who possesses the power of fan∣cy and strong thought, should be vigilant as a watch∣man. Let him sleep abundantly for health, but sparingly for sloth. It is better sometimes to consult a page of phylosophy than the pillow.</P>

<P>IN every annual revolution there are certain pe∣riods, at which men indulge ideas of association, whence they may derive, either the pleasant or the profitable. Thus, the gradual approach of cheer∣ful spring, the youth of the year, naturally induces us to speculate upon the youth of human life: The naked boughs and dropping leaf of the autumnal tree remind us of mortal decay. On the first of January we ponder on the past, and project for the

<P>These periodical habits are of peculiar utility, and deserve to be studiously cherished. They be∣get serious reflection and communion with one's self. They suggest at least, <HI>plans</HI> of reformation. "In castle building," as a sagacious philosopher has re∣marked, "no man is a villian." Though our <HI>inten∣ded</HI> good deeds terminate, as they began, in reverse▪ still it is better for our thoughts merely to hover round the temple of virtue than to be utterly stag∣nant. Among the forcible arguments ingeniously urged, by the pious advocate for the observance of the sacred day, that is not the least impressive, which proves that by going melancholly to church we shall at length, go religiously there.</P>
<P>For these and other reasons, a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mon on the sea∣son may be useful. Whatever recalls man from low cares to extended views, whatever rouzes in∣sensibility and exites to gratitude, and a love of na∣ture is surely meritorious.

<P>Spring and Summer are periods of expectation. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>armer beholds the corn fall into the bosom of the ground, and the young shoots rise, but all is uncertainty, till the produce is gathered into the garner. Many an anxious look is cast up to the va∣rying sky, lest the former and latter rain should too scantily, or too copiously descend, lest the sun should too fiercely glow, or mildewing vapour float, on vegetation. But, when the grass is dryed and secu∣red, when the mellow fruit of the orchards is melting into his casks, and the <HI>harvest</HI> moon lights his reap∣er to the last wheat sheaf, then is solicitude appeas∣ed, and he, exultingly, exclaims "I have finish∣ed."</P>
<P>The present, is the very period, in which harvest that "consummation" so "devoutly to be wished" by every husbandman, takes place. Of those di∣vines, who use themselves to preach occasional ser∣mons, I percieve it is the practice, to paint, and to praise the benefits of that particular year, in which eulogium is composed. But although of the nume∣rous good days which happy Americans have reck∣oned, those, which compose the current year, have shone among the fairest, yet, it is not the design of this discourse to speak only of the <HI>fruit basket</HI> of the present season. Our baskets are always full, ours are those regular alterations of heat and moisture, which beget plenty to the husbandman, for we have

"a south land," and "springs of water," we have the "upper and the nether springs."</P>
<P>At all times, America seems a privileged quarter of the globe. "Fruit" ever abounding, subject to no tithe, and eaten in tranquility marks our happy dis∣tinction. These topicks being slightly considered, the patience of the reader shall be relieved by the close of the sermon.</P>
<P>Whatever historical volumes, or system of ge∣ography we peruse, we find that most countries are exposed either to baleful vicissitudes of climate, or the capricious violence of tempest, drought, or inun∣dation. In the hallowed volume, almost every verse allusive to the natural history of Palestine, in old time, contains some memorial of the irregularity of its seasons. Agreeably to modern travellers, the inhabitants of many parts of the East, still smart un∣der the scourge of the elements. In Syria, rain is not witnessed, for months, and who has not heard of the scorching sands of Arabia? The Nile, the grand fertilizer of Egypt, like an over fond parent, sometimes smothers the object which it cherishes.— Cairo the mart of nations, sometimes bemoans in dust, her scanty harvests.
<Q>"And Mecca, saddens at their long delay."</Q>
If we survey regions of happier temperature, still the journals of their weather mark extreme varia∣ableness, and, in many years, their "baskets of sum∣mer fruit" are not high piled. We can scarcely look at a paragraph of foreign news in our Gazetts, without remarking a melancholly narrative of the scarcity of corn, and of a famished populace, clamo∣ring for bread. But why▪ my countrymen do you suf∣fer these calamities? What year is of such Egyptian sterility, that ye can be asked the question, proposed to the prophet, in my text, and not answer, like him?

<P>When the harvests of America are ripe for the sickle, the product is completely ours without de∣duction. According to Brydone, a lazy lording eats what the slavish Secillian peasant has sown.

<P>EARLY in the morning, Obidah, the son of A∣bensina, left the caravansera, and pursued hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> journey through the plains of Indostan; being vig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orous with rest, animated with hope, and incited by desire, he walked swiftly forward over the vallies and saw the hills gradually rising before him. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he passed along, his ears were delighted with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> song of the bird of Paradise; he was fanned by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> last flutters of the sinking breeze, and sprinkled wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dew by groves of spices; he sometimes contempla∣ted the towering height of the cedar which ador<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed the hills, and som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>times caught the gentle fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>grance of the flowers which enamelled the plains thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all his senses were gratified, and care entire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> banished from his heart.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="034482_0024_0FFDE78314A79518"/>In this manner he continued his journey till the sun approached his meridian, and the increasing heat preyed upon his strength; he then looked care∣fully round him, to discover some more agreeable and shady path. On his right hand he saw a grove, that seemed to wave its shades, as a sign of invita∣tion; he entered it, and found the coolness and ver∣dure irrestibly pleasant. He did not, however, for∣get whither he was travelling, but found a narrow way bordered with flowers, which appearing to have the same direction with the main road, he was pleas∣ed that, by this happy experiment, he had found means to unite pleasure with his business, and to gain the rewards of diligence, without suffering its fatigues. He, therefore, for a time still continued to walk, without the least remission of his ardor, ex∣cept that he was sometimes tempted to stop by the music of the birds, whom the heat had assembled in the shade; and sometimes amused himself with plucking the flowers which grew on either side, or the fruits that hung upon the branches. At last the green path began to decline from its first direction, and to wind among hills and thickets, cooled with fountains, and murmuring with the falls of water. Here Obidah paused for a time, and began to consi∣der whether it were safe for him to forsake any longer the known and open road; but remember∣ing that the heat was now in its greatest violence, and that the plain was dusty and uneven, he resolved to pursue the new path, which he supposed only to make a few meanders, in compliance with the vari∣eties of the ground, and to end at last in the com∣mon road.</P>
<P>Having thus calmed his solicitude, he renewed his pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, though he suspected he was not gaining ground. The uneasiness of his mind inclined him to lay hold on every new object, and gave way to
<PB N="48" REF="034482_0025_0FFDE785CA17E0A8"/>
every sensation that might sooth, or divert him.— He listened to every echo, he mounted every hill for a fresh prospect, he turned aside to every cas∣cade, and pleased himself with tracing the course of a gentle river that rolled among the trees, and wa∣tered a large region with innumerable circumvolu∣tions. In these amusements the hours passed away uncounted, his deviations had perplexed his memory and he knew not towards what point to travel.— He stood pensive and confused, afraid to go forward lest he should go wrong, yet conscious that the time of loitering was now passed. While he was thus tortured with uncertainty, the sky was overspread with clouds, the day vanished from before him, and a sudden tempest gathered round his head. He was now roused from his danger to a quick and painful remembrance of his folly; he now saw how happi∣ness is lost when ease is consulted, and lamented the unmanly impatience that prompted him to seek shel∣ter in the grove, and despised the petty cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osity that led him on from trifle to trifle; while he was thus reflecting▪ the air grew blacker, and a clap of thunder broke his meditation.</P>
<P>He now resolved to do what remained yet in his power, to tread b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k the ground which he passed, and try to find some issue, where the wood might open into the plain. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e prostrated himself on the ground, and commended his life to the Lord of na∣ture. He rose with confidence and tranquility, and pressed on with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bre in in his hand, for the beasts of the desart were in motion, and on every hand were heared the mingled howls of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age and fear, and ravage, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d expiration; all the horrors of dark∣ness surrounded him; the winds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oared in the woods, and the torrents tumbled fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the hills.</P>
<P>Thus▪ forlorn and distressed, he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ered through the wild, without knowing whither he was going,
<PB N="49" REF="034482_0025_0FFDE785CA17E0A8"/>
or whether he was every moment drawing nearer to safety or distruction. At length not fear but labour began to overcome him; his breath grew short, and his knees trembled, and he was on the point of ly∣ing down in resignation to his fate, when he beheld, through the brambles, the glimmer of a taper. He advanced towards the light, and finding it proceed∣ed from the cottage of a hermit, he called humbly at the door, and obtained admission. The old man set before him such provisions as he had collected for himself, on which Obidah fed with eagerness and gratitude.</P>
<P>When the repast was over, 'Tell me, said the her∣mit, by what chance you have been brought hither; I have been now twenty years an inhabitant of the wilderness, in which I never saw a man before.— Obidah then related all the occurrences of his jour∣ney, without any palliation.</P>
<P>'Son said the hermit, let the errors and follies, the dangers and escape of this day, sink deep into thine heart; remember, my son, that human life is the journey of a day. We rise in the morning of youth, full of vigour, and full of expectation; we set forward with spirit and hope, with gaiety and diligence, and travel on a while in the straight road of piety, towards the mansions of rest. In a short time we remit our fervour, and endeavour to find some mitigation of our duty, and some more easy means of obtaining the same end. we then relax our vigour, and resolve no longer to be terrified at crimes at a distance, but rely upon our own constan∣cy, and venture to approach what we resolve never to touch. We thus enter the bowers of ease, and repose in the shades of security. Here the heart softens, and vigilence subsides; we are then willing to enquire whether another advance cannot be made and whether we may not at last turn our eyes upon
<PB N="50" REF="034482_0026_0FFDE7887379FA80"/>
the gardens of pleasure; we approach them with scruple and hesitation, we enter them, but enter timorous and trembling, and always hope to pass through them without losing the road of virtue, which we, for a while, keep in our sight, and to which we propose to return. But temptation suc∣ceeds temptation, and one compliance prepares us for another; we in time lose the happiness of inno∣cence, and solace our disquiet with sensual gratifica∣tions. By degrees we let fall the remembrance of our original intention, and quit the only adequate object of rational desire. We entangle ourselves in business, immerge ourselves in luxury, and rove through the labyrinths of inconstancy, till the dark∣ness of old age begins to invade us, and disease and anxiety obstruct our way. We then look back upon ourselves with horror, with sorrow, with repen∣tance; and wish, but too often vainly wish, that we had not forsaken the ways of virtue. Happy are they, my son, who shall learn, from thy example, not to despair, but shall remember, that though the day is past, and their strength is wasted, there yet remains one effort to be made; that reformation is never hopeless, nor sincere endeavours ever unassis∣ted but the wanderer may at last return after all his errors; and he who implores strength and cou∣rage from above, shall find danger and difficulty give way before him. Go now, my son, to thy repose; commit thyself to the care of omnipotence, and when the morning calls again to toil, begin a new thy journey and thy life.'</P>

<HEAD>"Let us get up early."</HEAD>
<P>SOLOMON could hardly have written three thou∣sand proverbs and a madrigal to his love, with such wisdom and wit, if he had not by the air and scenery of the morning, corroborated his health and kindled his fancy.—Whether active as a king or indolent as a lover, he perceived that early hours were auxiliary both to business and pleasure, and therefore judiciously advises to rise with the lark.</P>
<P>In our climate, a midsummer <HI>morning's</HI> dream not SHAKESPEARE himself should be permitted to tell.

<P>But in the course of my parochial visitations, my early tap at many a door is often answered by a voice, exclaiming from behind a curtain; it is the voice of the sluggard. The cock has crowed thrice and certain robbins have sung two hymns and a bal∣lad, before half my acquaintance have "girded their loins," buckled their shoes and combed their hair. Yet these creatures, not content with the naps of the night, swathe themselves, like so many Egyptian mummies, in a sheet, four hours after sun rise, and then have the impudence to rise and talk about business, and the beauty of the day.</P>
<P>The princely poet, author of our excellent text, when exhorting to summer enjoyments, points out to the night season, nor to the "inner pavilion" of the palace, but informs us that his "bed is <HI>green,</HI>" and his love displayed in the open air.</P>

<PB N="54" REF="034482_0028_0FFDE78F51908948"/>
and give her his love, amidst the dews of dawn. Well wert thou called wise, thou gallant prince, if it were only for thy knowledge of the fe∣male heart. Well didst thou know that the buds, of beauty, like the blossoms of Shinah, stealing fresh vigor from slumber, expand all their sweetness to the morning ray. In our time the torpid admirer snores, amidst the evening fog, the praises of his mistress, while the sprightly strains of his serenade are obtruded by the thick mists of midnight.</P>
<P>In close parlours and the long winter's eve, we may pore over rent rolls and engross marriage set∣tlements. Let the city lover, in cork soalec laces, goloshoes and flannel, court the delicate maiden, in the close cap and comfortable bed gown. But he, that would woo the buxom Health, must

must not seek thee behind fire screens, or lolling on a sofa, but must erect a lodge in the village; and before the day break, and the shadows flee away, when the rose and the mandrake give a sweet smell, listen for thy jocund song, mingling with the matin of the lark. In lieu of the ticket for the foetid thea∣tre, or the card for the crowded ball room, the American lover should bid good morning to his fair one's night cap, and salute her with the early call of arise, my beloved, and come away, for the flow∣ers <HI>appear</HI> on the earth and the <HI>time</HI> of the singing of the birds is come.

<HEAD><HI>COMMON SENSE,</HI> in Dishabille. Win Gold, and wear it.</HEAD>
<P>MANY suppose the plain meaning of this text is, lay your earnings out in clothes; others have thought it referred to gamblers. They would do well to understand it literally. If you have been so unfortunate as to win money at the card table, I should choose to see it sparkling in a pair of paste knee buckles, or dingling in a gold watch chain, or

pearl key, rather than trusted again to the disposal of these fickle arbitrators, hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Whatever may be your opinion of law decisions, I verily believe thy money would stand a better chance with lawyer, judge and jury. If gamblers win gold let them wear it. I am inclined to think the sage authors of good old English pro∣verbs intended something more here than has been observed. Their adages are brim full of meaning; so full of good wholesome every-day fare, that the sickly stomachs of your Lord Chesterfields, and your humble servant Smokeface, cannot digest them.— But the Prompter, whose writings have a much more conspicuous place in the library of Common Sense than my Lord Chesterfield's, is not so squeam∣ish; according to him, "they contain the experi∣ence, the wisdom of nations and ages, compressed into the compass of a nut-shell." This, I hope, will be a sufficient apology for my frequent use of those old sayings, homespun expressions, and coarse ideas, so offensive to those, who are "more refined than refinement, more sensible than sense:" or, as I understand it, just as foolish as folly. Now I be∣lieve if we crack the shell of this nut I have sent you wrapt up in this sheet of paper, you will find no jest, that will burst your sides with laughter, but this wholesome viand, "Earn industriously, and spend prudently," which will not only afford you nourishment from the first of January to the last of December, but prevent thee from taking a single pill from the doctor, and keep you warm in the coldest winter day. As this is a large mouthful, and so full of nutriment, I advise thee, if thou hast a good store of last year's corn, meat and cider, to lay it by until next week; in the mean time, if I have an hour's leisure, I will set down and pick it

<HEAD>Earn industriously, and spend prudently.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is the construction Common Sense is pleas∣ed to put upon my last week's text. If the interpretation seems too rigid, and bears too hard upon your pride and vanity, it is only to qualify you to enter the "<HI>little end</HI> of the horn," with a good grace, that you may find the cornucopia at the other. Clerical method would divide my lecture into two heads; the division is natural; I will follow it.— First, Earn industriously. When the sun has begun his daily task, expanded the flowers and set all the busy agents of vegitation to work, if these do not afford you a sufficient stimulus to industry, walk out to your bee hive: these little laborers shall preach you a better sermon against indolence than you will often hear from the pulpit. If, after observing their activity and oeconomy fifteen minutes, you do not profit by the lecture, let them sting you for a drone. "Spend prudently." Never lay out more at the tavern, after sun set, than you have earned, before sun rise; nor even that, if your last year's taxes are not crossed out from the collector's book. Dress in homespun three years, and if vanity or de∣cency require, you may wear superfine the fourth. What folly lays out in sheepskin gloves in ten years, if managed by prudence, might fill a small purse — Are not white dollars worth more to a farmer than white hands?

<HEAD>"Then went Sampson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot."</HEAD>
<P>STRONG as he was, such a journey debilitated him. It was not the length of the way from Timnah; it was not the rugged road, nor the irk∣someness of a hard trotting mule; it was not a stroke of the sun, nor a bleak air that shook the nerves, and prostrated the life of Sampson; for not one of these circumstances is ever glanced at by the historian; no, he saw, in one of the stews of Gaza, a venal beauty and was undone. His wit evapora∣ted, his wisdom turned babbler, he lost his vigilance, his eyes and his life.</P>
<P>One licentious indulgence excites to another. The blandishments of his courtezan allured to the cells of the whole sisterhood. He lays his head in the lap of voluptuousness, and gives full scope to criminal desire. For it came to pass afterwards, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.</P>
<P>Let us ponder a little the history of these unlucky amours. A sketch of the wars and vicissitudes of passion is of more interest than the narrative of a battle or siege, or the annals of an empire.</P>
<P>To display a striking, as well as useful contrast,
<PB N="59" REF="034482_0030_0FFDE7981023B6C0"/>
it may be correct to view Sampson, before he enter∣ed the gates of Gaza, and after his acquaintance with two bad women.</P>
<P>His first was by no means a love adventure. It was in the style of chyvalry without a damsel. Lurking in the vines of rude territory, a lion roared against our juvenile hero, who as it is in a lively man∣ner expressed, rent his verocious adversary, as he would have rent a kid. A bold encounter, but not half so dangerous as the smiles of the lady in the valley of Sorek. Mere brute force, however was not the sole attribute of Sampson. For seven days he tortures the ingenuity of thirty friends to re∣solve an enigma. He had the palm of wit and the chaplets of victory; by his art he destroys the pro∣perty, and by his arm the life of his enemies. Not only the family of his father, Manoah, but the whole circumjacent region must have rung with the praises of this youth of promise; and even indiffer∣ent men, and abstract reasons would alertly from such imposing premises draw the happiest conclusion.</P>
<P>But behold how, in one hour, so great riches come to nought. Thus far, what a tissue of brilliant atchievments do we admire! The next scene is madly mortifying. In the very summer of the en∣suing page of his story what are the humiliating particulars of his downfall? Sampson, the valiant, the witty and the wise, is the dupe of female jug∣glers; is enticed; is overcome. In the arms of a "twining Lais" of the Philistines, his superna∣tural strength melts away. He awakes out of his lethargy of pleasure, and hopes to go out, as at other times, rejoicing in his might. But the ener∣gy of the soul is no more. He, whom once nothing could restrain, is bound. He grinds in the prison house, and dwindled into a buffoon, is <HI>invested with his motley</HI> to amuse the rabble.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="034482_0031_0FFDE7999F04B068"/>In the life of this extraordinary personage it is a matter of regretful speculation that the field of ho∣nor should be changed for the valley of Sorek. Hence an abundant crop of evil. It was not the Philistines, it was impure passion that extinguished the discernment of Sampson. He never saw any object clearly, after he went to Gaza, and saw an harlot. It is true, he saw Delilah, but probably, through the obscurity of nocturnal hours. Of her arts, of her perils, he surely ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but an imperfect vision. Hood winked by pleasure, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e could not see the seven locks of his head, scattered on the toilet of a woman. The scissars of a gypsey proved shar∣per than the sword of enemies; and the flowing hair of the hero, once covered with laurel, is now tortured into meretricious ringlets, or periwigs some pimp in Delilah's antichamber.</P>
<P>Genius, said the amiable clergyman, with whom I studied divinity, is invariably connected with strong passions. When men, exquisitely organized, indulge pleasure, it is with that species of fervour, noted in the oriental page—it is with all their hearts, and with all their soul, and with all their strength, and with all their mind. The insensible lounger, the self engrossed coxcomb, may sleep upon the knees of Delilah, and wake again to puny life. But of that opiate of joy, of that golden cup of abomina∣tion, which the harlot presents, if you sip, man, of feeling, you will "drain the chalice to the lowest and foulest dregs." Keep the high and safe ground;—beware of sliding down the slope of plea∣sure. It conducts you to some vale of Sorek, be∣neath whose roses are the serpent and the dagger. Go up to Parnassus and see the muse—An excur∣sion to Gaza to see a mortal beauty, is not half so exhilerating.</P>

<HEAD>The MORALIST.</HEAD>
<P>HEALTH is so necessary to all the duties, as well as pleasures of life, that the crime of squandering it is equal to the folly; and he that for a short gratification brings weakness and disease up∣on himself, and for the pleasure of a few years pass∣ed in the tumults of diversion and clamors of meri∣ment, condemns the maturer and more experienced part of his life to the chamber and the couch, may be justly reproached, not only as a spendthrift of his own happiness, but as a robber of the public; as a wretch that has voluntarily disqualified himself for the business of his station and refused that part which Providence assigns him, in the general task of hu∣man nature. There are very few conditions more to be pitied than that of an active and elevated mind, laboring under the weight of a distempered body; the time of such a man is always spent in forming schemes, which a change of wind hinders from exe∣cuting, his powers fume away in projects and in hope, and the day of action never arrives. He lies down, delighted with the thoughts of to-morrow, pleases his ambition with the fame he shall acquire, on his benevolence with the good he shall bestow.— But, in the night, the skies are overcast, the temper of the air is changed, he wakes in langour, impa∣tience and distraction, and has no longer any wish, but for ease, nor any attention but for misery. It may be said that disease generally begins that equal∣ity, which death completes; the distinctions, which set one man so much above another are very little perceived in the gloom of a sick chamber, where it will be vain to expect entertainment from the gay, or instruction from the wise, where all human glory is obliterated, the wit is clouded, the reasoner per∣plexed and the hero subdued; when the highest and brightest of mortal beings finds nothing left him, but the consciousness of innocence.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE great business of nature, with respect to the vegetable creation, at this season is <HI>dissem∣ination.</HI> Plants having gone through the progres∣sive stages of springing, flowering and seeding, have at length brought to maturity the rudiments of a future progeny, which are now to be committed to the fostering bosom of the earth. This being done, the parent vegetable, if of the <HI>herbaceous</HI> kind, either totally dies, or perishes as far as it rose above ground: if a <HI>tree</HI> or <HI>shrub,</HI> it loses all its tender parts which the Spring and Summer had put forth. Seeds are scattered by the hand of nature in various manners. The winds which at this time arise, dis∣perse far and wide many seeds which are curiously furnished with feathers or wings for this purpose. Hence plants with such seeds are, of all, the most universally to be met with; as dandelion, ground∣sel, ragwort, thistles, &amp;c. Other seeds by the means of hooks, lay hold of passing animals, and are thus carried to distant places. The common burs are examples of this contrivance. Many are con∣tained in berries, which being eaten by birds, the seeds are discharged again uninjured, and grow where they happen to light. Thus carefully has nature provided for the distribution and propagation of plants.</P>
<P>The gloom of the falling year is in some measure enlivened, during this month especially, by the va∣riety of colours, some lively and beautiful, put on by the fading leaves of trees and shrubs.</P>
<Q><PB N="68" REF="034482_0035_0FFDE7A19C6F9638"/>
<L>Those virgin leaves, of purest vivid green,</L>
<L>Which charm'd ere yet they trembled on the trees,</L>
<L>Now cheer the sober landscape in decay:</L>
<L>The lime first fading; and the golden birch</L>

<L>Th' ensanguin'd dogwood; and a thousand tints</L>
<L>Which Flora dress'd in all her pride of bloom,</L>
<L>Could scarcely equal, decorate the groves.</L></Q>
<P>To these temporary colours are added the more durable ones of ripen'd berries, a variety of which now enrich our hedges.</P>

<P>THE improvement of the mind, has ever been observed by the judicious, to be one of the no∣blest employments of an intelligent being: Not on∣ly because this part constitutes the true dignity of man; but because by such pursuits, the rational soul receives the most sublime and permanent ideas.

<HEAD>MATERNAL ARTIFICE. A TRUE STORY.</HEAD>
<P>TWO young gentlemen of fashion and fortune, students of law, some years ago rented an el∣egant double set of chambers, and lived together in Gray's-Inn. The apartments were on the ground floor, and the windows looked into and had an ea∣sy communication with the charming garden belong∣ing to that ancient seminary. One Sunday morn∣ing, being at breakfast, with the window open, they observed a very beautiful young woman in the gar∣den, with a child in her arms equally beautiful: she passed them several times, sedate and unobserving, but at length her attractions becoming too irresisti∣ble, they spoke to her, and with much earnestness invited her to partake of their breakfast. The beau∣tiful <HI>nursery maid,</HI> however, was inflexible; she re∣sisted all intreaties, and in some time retired. For the whole day nothing else was thought of but her, and a thousand schemes devised to entrap her into the chambers.</P>
<P>The next morning, like a bright ray of returning Phoebus, she appeared in her former station, and the hearts of the young heroes felt, with redoubled force, the increasing energies of her charms; invi∣tations

were reiterated, but she still remained inex∣orable, and, as on the preceding morning, left the garden at a particular hour. One of the youths followed, and watched her, but he was observed, and the game evaded his pursuit. In this manner did this extraordinary phoenomenon appear, and tor∣ment for several days; until at length it was set∣tled that, upon her next visit, one of the youths should contrive to secure the child, and give it in at the window to the other. This scheme was accord∣ingly exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uted, on a supposition that the maid, or mother, would soon follow: but alas! the device failed, for from that moment to this, neither maid nor mother ever troubled them with inquiries, or has since been heard of!</P>

<P><PB N="vi" REF="034482_0045_0FFDE7BE518100B8"/>It is well known that many impositions have been inflicted upon mankind, by particular persons in every country; and in the earliest periods of time, many re∣markable occurrences took place, that much surprised the greater part of mankind, induced them to believe that such wonderful phenomina could not take place, only by a supernatural power.</P>
<P>Every person that is acquainted with human nature, or has studied the disposition of mankind, must be fully convinced of the deception of man, and certainly know, there are persons, whose abilities, disposition and genius, are in every respect, adequate to the profession of deceivers. And many of their co-temporaries confide in their abilities, integrity and veracity, to that degree, that they will sacrifice their property, through ignorance, to support a vicious, ignoble, defrauder. Nor is this much to be wondered at, if we contemplate the avaricious disposition of men, who are ever in search of objects in futurity, especially such as have a tendency to produce gain, they will pursue with the greatest alacrity, anticipating joys which, upon a near approach, elude the grasp. It is obvious, that some illiterate persons have a genius adequate to prepossess themselves in favor with many, and by an enegmatical behavior, induce some to form eminent opinions of their merit, at the same time it was paradoxical. And if we suppose that every generation grows wiser, we must believe that ignorance has been gradually extinguishing for some hundred years past; and it is almost incredible to believe, that any impositions could be practised upon mankind at this enlightened period: but although knowledge is more diffuse, human nature is still the same, and Judas like, will perpetrate enormous deeds to satisfy an avaricious mind. And if we admit the same disposition to reign predominent, in the deceived, as the deceiver then let the deceived pay their money to the deceiver, who has been at trouble and cost in obtaining his art of extracting, for those who go to the sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ool of experience may expect to pay dear for their tuition.</P>

<HEAD>The Morris-Town Ghost DELINEATED.</HEAD>
<P>A DIABOLICAL intrigue invaded the county of <HI>Morris,</HI> in the state of <HI>New Jersey,</HI> in the year 1788. This unequalled performance, has taken vent and is promulgated througout the continent, and de∣serves the attention of every person. But before I proceed any further, I think it requisite to advert a few minutes to the general character of that place.</P>
<P>It is very conspicuous that many of the people in that county, are much attached to machinations, and will spend much time in investigating curiosities. I don't say whether such a turn of mind is to be imputed to indigence or owing to the operation of the climate: this I submit to the candor of every person to deter∣mine within himself—it is obvious to all who are acquainted with the county of Morris, that the pheno∣mena and capricious notions of witchcraft, has engaged the attention of many of its inhabitants for a number of years, and the existence of witches is adopted by the generality of the people.</P>
<P>I was once in Morristown, and happened to be in conversation with some gentlemen, who had, as it were, the faith of assurance it witchcraft. They informed me that there were several young women who were be∣witched; and they had been harrased so much by witches for a long time, and all their experiments proved abortive, and the young women were so much debilitated they were fearful they would never recover their healths. They related several occurrences, that I think too simple to mention; but one instance was, "That an old lady was churning, and being much fatigued, and unable to obtain butter, she at last con∣cluded that the witches were in the churn, and imme∣diately
<PB N="8" REF="034482_0046_0FFDE7C0F9AFDA50"/>
had recourse to experiments, which were, that of heating several horse-sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, and putting them into the churn alternately—she burnt the devil out, and immediately obtained butter."</P>
<P>I perceived that the generality were apprehensive of witches riding them, and the greatest evidence of a witch was, if a woman had any deformity, or had lived to that age to cause wrinkles in her face, she had the appella<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of a witch. There was another occurrence that happened on Sunday. They informed me, a man was driving his sheep from his grain, and an accident happened as they were jumping ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a fence, one of the sheep broke its leg. The man for some time before supposed that the same sheep was bewitched. About the same time, an aged old lady returning from church, her horse unfortunately stumbled, she fell to the ground and broke her leg—This was received as an indication that she was a witch: And in fact, if a horse had the belly-ache, or any beast was in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gony of pain and be∣haved uncommon, the general opinion was, that the crea∣ture was bewitched.</P>
<P>It is my opinion, that persons actuated by such ca∣pricious notions, are pre-disposed for the reception of marvelous curiosities whenever they occur.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to detail as near as possible, re∣lative to the transactions of that phenomena, <HI>Legerde∣main</HI> and <HI>Hobgoblins,</HI> that happened in Morristown, in the year 1788.</P>
<P>This transaction has occupied the attention of many▪ &amp; caused great wondering through the state, and every person is eager to acqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re a thorough knowledge of the real transactions; and I hope this will have a tendency to eradicate such capricious notions from every ration∣al mind—The chief conductor of this deception, was <HI>Ransford Rogers,</HI> a native of Connecticut, in New-England. He was an illiterate person, but very aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ble, possessed of a genius adequate to prepossess himself into favor with many, and great facility to display his abilities with the geatest brilliancy. He resided in the state of Massachusetts for a number of years, and from
<PB N="9" REF="034482_0046_0FFDE7C0F9AFDA50"/>
thence to the state of New-York. His place of resi∣dence, before he came to New Jersey, was Smith's Clove, where he taught a school. During his residence at Smith's Clove, two gentlemen from the county of Morris, who had been long in search and digging of mines, but had always proved unsuccessful for the want of a per∣son whose knowledge descended into the bowels of the earth, and could reveal the secret things of dark∣ness. There was also, a prevailing opinion, that there was money deposited in the bowels of the earth, at Schooler's mountain, with an enchantment upon it— that it could not be obtained without a peculiar art in legerdemain, or to dispel the hobgoblins &amp; apparitions. These gentlemen, in pursuit of a man that could work miracles, accidentally found Rogers, and after a short conversation, made known their business to him, and concluded that he was the man every way calculated to their wishes, for he was very fond of giving hints of his extensive knowledge in every art and science, but careful not to go so far as to demonstrate his pro∣positions. He had a pretended copious knowledge in chemistry; and could raise or dispel good or evil spirits. He then agreed with those gentlemen to supply them with whatever was requested—This was a noble man indeed! Now they concluded the man was found who could supply them with all things; and one who was endowed with power and sagacity not to be exceeded by finite wisdom!</P>
<P>But altho' Rogers had engaged to exhibit miracles, knowing that he must seek inventions, he thinking it too great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n undertaking, began to regret, fearing that he was not able to perform: but after he had underta∣ken, and given hints of his knowledge and abilities, and being solicited by the gentlemen to proceed, he could not elude what he had advanced, but resolved to have recourse to experiments and stratagem to prove his assertions. He was then solicited to remove to Morristown. Those gentlemen, with indifatigable pains, procured him a school, three miles from Morris∣town. This was satisfactory to Rogers being confi∣dent of their integrity, and perceiving their flexibility
<PB N="10" REF="034482_0047_0FFDE7C28A3EB9F8"/>
and readiness to administer to his relief, he thinking himself happy with such noble concomitants, left Smith's Clove, with the greatest alacrity, and took his ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de about three miles from Morristown, where he presided over a common English school. This was a place every way suitable for a man of his profession, for they were pre disposed for his reception, fond of mar∣ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us exhibitions, which he was able to facilitate with the greatest alacrity— his was in August 1788 While he presided over this school, he gave satisfaction to his employers, and manifest proofs of his integrity. By this time he had possessed himself in favor with many, but it is likely they expected reward. Sometime in S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ember, as he had been importuned to exhibit his art in r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sing and dispelling apparitions, and prove his abilities as he had asserted. He then finding himself deficient, and perceiving it requisite to have an assistant in order to carry on nocturnal performances, with the greatest secrecy. He then obtained leave of his em∣ployers, to absent himself a few days and return to New England for his family and some other business, upon his promise to return as soon as possible.</P>
<P>While he was in New-England, he contracted with a person, a schoolmaster, to return with him, insuring him a school that would be very lucrative.—Rogers, agree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble to his promise, was as brief as possible, and returned with his new companion to Morristown, where he was saluted by persons of eminence and congratula∣ted by many after his long absence. This was in Sep∣tember 1788.</P>
<P>Rogers now being furnished with an assistant, he is able to facilitate nocturnal performances with the great∣est dispatch. As it was now the last of September, many soliciting Rogers to exhibit his art in raising and exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing apparitions, as he had engaged. The first obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct that is to be now attended to is, to obtain a sup∣po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed hidden treasu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, that lies dormant in the earth at Sch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oler's M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untain.</P>

part of Morristown, as they said there had been re∣peated efforts made to obtain the treasure, but all had proved abortive; for whenever they attempted to break the ground, there would many hobgoblins and appari∣tions appear, which in a short time, obliged them to evacuate the place. [It is well known, that persons be∣ing apprehensive of seeing apparitions, their imagination causes them to arise; but they always imputed their disappointments, to the misman gement of their con∣ductor, as not having sufficient knowledge to dispel those apparitions, that impeded them from obtaining the treasure.]</P>
<P>Rogers, after gathering information from every quar∣ter, and hearing the obstructions that debarred them from obtaining immense riches, was now satisfied this was the time for him to fulfil his former assertions.</P>
<P>He then secured the veil of ignorance upon their head<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, with an intention to extract money from their p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ckets; therefore, after deliberation, he thought ne∣cessary to convene a number of gentlemen at a certain place in order to consult what method must be taken to obtain the above mentioned treasure. This meet∣ing was the greatest secrecy, &amp; their number about eight.</P>
<P>Here R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gers communicated to them the solemnity of the business and the intricacy of the undertaking, in∣forming them there was an immense sum deposited at the abovementioned place; and there had been several persons murdered and buried with the money, in order to retain it in the earth. He likewise informed them, that those spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>its must be rais<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and conversed with, before the money could be obtained. He likewise de∣clared, that he could by his act and power, raise them apparitions, and the whole company might hear him converse with them, and satisfy themselves that there was no deception. This was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved with belief and admiration by the whole com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>any, without ever in∣vestigating whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was probab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssible.—This meet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, terminated with g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat assurance, they all be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nfident of the abili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, knowledge and power of Rogers.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="034482_0048_0FFDE7C436FD2DD0"/>By this time it appeared to those gentlemen, that the hidden treasures of darkness which had so long lay dormant in the earth, was to be obtained by the pow∣er of this mighty man!</P>
<P>Rogers informed them, that he should have inter∣views with the spirits; and as the apparitions knew all things, they must be careful to walk circumspectly, and refrain from all immorality, or they would stimu∣late the spirits to withhold from them the treasures.</P>
<P>These gentlemen now under apprehensions of vast riches, began to propagate their intentions to particu∣lar friends, and there was such a prospect of being rich, that many were anxious to become members; and ad∣ditions were added unto it daily, of such as expected great riches. The company convened almost every evening until their number increased to about forty. During this time, none had interviews with the spirits except Rogers, and he communicated their conversation to the society, which was admitted as real facts.</P>
<P>Now you will observe, that it is highly necessary, that Rogers would have associates, in order to facilitate his manoeuvres and avoid detection. During this time, Rogers and his connections had recourse to several ex∣periments in compounding various substances, that be∣ing thrown into the air would break with such appear∣ances as to indicate to the beholders to arise from a su∣perna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ural power. He had composi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions of various kinds: Some by being buried in the earth for so many hours, would break and cause a great explosion, which appeared dismal in the night and would cause great timidity.</P>
<P>The company were all anxious to proceed and much elevated with such uncommon curiosities A night was appointed for the whole company to convene, and it happened to be a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st severe stormy night, but every man was punctual in his attendance Some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ode eight, some twelve miles, when the incleme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cy of the wea∣ther was sufficient to extinguish health.</P>
<P>At this interview they were all much aston<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shed with an unexpected interview with the spirit, who related
<PB N="13" REF="034482_0048_0FFDE7C436FD2DD0"/>
unto them the importance of their regular proceedings, or they could not obtain their desire. The spirits informed them, that they must meet on such a night, at a certain place, about half a mile from any house in a field, retired from travelling and noise: and they must form certain angles and circles, and they must proceed in drawing their lines and forming their circles as Rogers directed, and then be careful to keep within the circles, or they would provoke the spirits to that degree, they would finally extirpate them from the place.</P>
<P>The night appointed for them to convene, being now arrived, they all with joy, fear and trembling, conven∣ed at the appointed house, about half a mile from the field. This field was environed on the north and west by a thick wood. The circles and angles being drawn the preceding day, they all proceeded from the house about ten o'clock in the evening, with peculiar silence and decorum▪ and entered the circles with the greatest solemnity, and being fully sensible they were surround∣ed by apparitions and hobgoblins.</P>
<P>Upon one part of the circle was erected four posts, in order to spread a cloth, and form a tent, where Ro∣gers could preside, as governor of the ghastly procession. The number that entered these circles were about for∣ty. This number was walking alternately during the whole procession. It is not to be wondered at, if peo∣ple were timorous in this place; for the candles illum∣ing one part of the circle, caused a ghastly, melancholy, direful gloom, towards the woods, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r it was a dark night. Every person must suppose that this is a suita∣ble place for the pretended ghosts to make their appear∣ance and establish their faith in hobgoblins, apparitions, witch-craft and the devil.</P>
<P>After they had been rotating within the circles for a considerable time with great decorum, they were in∣stantaneously, shocked with the most impetuous explo∣sion from the earth at a small distance from them — This substance was previously compounded, &amp; secreted in that place a few hours before.

<P>Rogers to confirm them in the faith, pretended to have nocturnal interviews with the spirits, and com∣municated to the society, therefore, they convened some of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m almost every night, and as fast as they could get the money, they would convene and deliver it to the spirits; and whenever they met in a secret room, the door and window shutters being made fast, and R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gers communicating his interviews to the compa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, unu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l noises would be heard ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e▪ that would cause great timidity. Groanings, and wrapping upon the house, the falling of boards in the chamber, the gingling of money at the window, and a voice speaking, "Press forward!" The superficial machine that was over the mouth of him who spoke, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o much altered his voice, that no one could detect him.</P>
<P>The spirits declared that they were sent to deliver that s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ciety great riches, and they could have no re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t until they had given it up; but the money they re∣quested, was only an acknowledgement for such im∣mense treasures. Methinks I hear every m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n antici∣pating future greatness, but I expect time will defeat the enterprise.</P>
<P>There was now a sort of emul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion among them, who should first deliver the money to the spir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, but some of them was weak in faith, which caused animo∣sities and disputes among them; and meetings were called almost every night during the winter. The reader will observe one circumstance in particular, that occasioned the business to continue through the winter▪ which was▪ the money that the spirits requested, must be silver or gold, and the current money then in Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sey, was loan paper: This money did not circulate only in that state, and no person would take it in lieu of silver and gold, only at one quarter discount. This therefore had a tendency to continue the business thro' the winter, as it was almost impossible for some of them to get silver or gold; but all of them were very
<PB N="16" REF="034482_0050_0FFDE7CA49610810"/>
industrious seeking the sum required. They would give almost any discount or interest that any man pleased to ask. They would mortgage their farms and dispose of their cattle at half price, rather than fail in obtaining the required sum.</P>
<P>It is very obvious why Rogers and his associates, the supposed spirits, requested silver or gold, for they wanted to carry it out of the state, and paper money would have been of but little service.</P>
<P>Sometime in March, the money being chiefly de∣posi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in the hands of the spirits. Rogers fearing that something might happen, pretended to have nocturnal interviews with the spirit, likewise several persons, especially those who had the most faith and men of veracity were called out of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> beds in the night by the spirits, and directed how to proceed.</P>
<P>These gentlemen immediately made known to the company their interviews with the spirit; and when the company were convened in a private room▪ the pretended spirits were out side of the house, gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aning, gingling of money, telling them to have faith, be of good cheer, and keep secret all transactions, and in May next they should receive the treasure.—This was in March 1789. They all returned with joy, fear and wondering, being very liberal, waiting impatiently for May to come.</P>
<P>Now Rogers and his associates have received the greater part of the money, and they are full of machi∣nations, how they shall postpone the business the next meeting, for all expected to proceed to Schooler's Mountain the next May, and receive the treasure.</P>
<P>The night appointed being now arrived, they all convened in a large circle in an open field, waiting for the ghosts to appear and give them farther directions, and proceed with them to the place where the money was deposited. Immediately the ghosts appeared with∣out the circle, with great choler, and hedious groanings, wreathing themselves in various positions, that appeared most ghastly in the night—then upbraiding the company declaring they had not proceeded regular, and some
<PB N="17" REF="034482_0050_0FFDE7CA49610810"/>
of them was faithless, and had devulged many things that ought to have been kept secret; and by their wicked dispositions and animosities that had taken place among them, debarred them at present, from obtaining the treasures. The pretended ghosts, raging to that degree at the misconduct of the company, that Rogers, who appeared or pretended to be very much frightened with the rest, with all his art and pleading was scarcely able to pacify the raging ghosts!</P>
<P>At this the company confiding in Rogers, looked to him for protection. The ghosts informed them, they must wait patient<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, until some future period. They were now so much timidated, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t they thought but little about money, at length Rogers, after a variety of ceremonies by his art and power, dispelled the frightful apparitions, and tranquility, once more, resides within the circle.</P>
<P>They now returned from the circle, still retaining their belief, reve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing and adhering to Rogers in all things. Thus far they have been seduced. They have given their money to Rogers and his associates, instead of apparitions; and are waiting for the spirit to return and lead them to anticipated fortunes.</P>
<P>Had Rogers now halted, and not proceeded upon another project, he would have been feared and respect∣ed; &amp; the capricious notions of witchcraft, hobgoblins, and the devil would have prevailed among them, with prejudice, fear and ignorance, until this day. But this diabolical intrigue and the succeeding one, has d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffused light, and eradicated ignorance from the minds of many. This scene ended the first of May, 1789.</P>
<P>It is evident that Rogers did not intend to proceed any further upon such diabolical intrigues; but some∣time in the fall preceding the termination of the first scene, two young men from New England, took up their abode in the county of Morris: Some time the fore part of the winter, one of them took up his abode in Morris. Rogers at that time taught a school three miles out of town, but soon quitting his school there, removed to Morristown. These young men soon became
<PB N="18" REF="034482_0051_0FFDE7CE0CB77670"/>
very intimate with Rogers, which was the cause of another diab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cal intrigue, altho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh their behavior was circumspect —Som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n April these young men left Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ristown, and removed about twenty miles, but still con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nuing a correspondence with Rogers, by letters and frequent visits.</P>
<P>Alth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugh these two men were removed at the distance of twenty miles from Rogers, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a favorable oppor∣tunity for them to gain pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lites; as it is evident they seduced many, and some of eminent char<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cters, that would have joined the company and proceeded in anti∣cip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iches, but Rogers thought it not proper to admit them, as appeared from the corresponding letters wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Rogers and the fire club.</P>
<P>I before mentioned, that the business of the former company terminated the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st of May, and as Rogers and his former associ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tes have succeeded so well, in ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>racting money with new inventions, that Rogers again undertakes, with great alacrity upon a new project.</P>
<P>A company now convene, that consists only of five. They proceed upon various manoeuvres, rotating the room in order to raise the spirit, while they were performing many ceremonies, va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous noises were heard around the house: The rattling of a waggon—groaning —striking upon the windows, &amp;c. Then each one taking a sheet of paper, extending his arm, holding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he paper out at the door, waiting for the spirit to write upon one of the papers, how they should proceed! After waiting some time, each one folding his paper, proceed∣ing regular around a table, then opening their papers on one of them was a writing, directing them to convene upon such a night, and the spirit would give further directions how they must proceed. Previous to this, Rogers had prepared the writing, but wanted more time for consideration; therefore they were dismissed with orders to convene on such a night.</P>

<P>This gent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eman, not apprehending any deception, believed it to be a spirit.

They fell upon their knees to pray; and after this ceremony was past, all arose and walked alternately around the room, five times; then parading around a table, and each man drawing a sheet of paper from a quite, it was folded up, and all hustled together, and each man taking one, and tying a white handker∣chief round his head and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins, they all marched wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h great decorum into a meadow about one hundred yards from the house.

was to see if the spirit had given them any directions how to proceed; then each one unfolding his paper, the writing exhibited plain on one of their papers in a most curious manner. This writing was so elegant, that they were much astonished, thinking it a miracle, or supposing that the spirit entered the circle and wrote the contents, while they were on their faces at prayer.</P>
<P>The contents of the writing was, <HI>O faithless man! What more need I exhibit unto you! I am the spirit of a just man▪ sent from Heaven to declare these things unto you; and I can have no rest until I have delivered great possessions into your hands; but look to</HI> GOD, <HI>there is greater treasure in Heaven for you! O faithless men! Press forward in faith, and the prize is yours!</HI> It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mentioned various chapters in the Bible, that the members must peruse, and particular psalms for them to sing; and the company must consist of thirty seven members; and each man must deposit into the hands of the spirit according to his circumstances, not ex∣ceeding twelve, nor less than six pounds; and the mo∣ney must be given up as soon as possible, in order to relieve the spirit from his exigencies, that he might return from whence he came.</P>
<P>Rogers and two of his associates were present and appeared to be astonished with the rest, but were not suspected by any of the company.</P>
<P>They all agreed, that as fast as any of them could get the money, it should be given to the spirit; but they must meet at such a place, and give it up in a legal manner. A few days after this about twelve members convened, but only seven had the money ready to appropriate unto the spirit.</P>
<P>The manner of their proceeding was, they convened in a room, and after several ceremonies and prayer being ended, they arose, &amp; rotated the room, alternately, several times; then went with the greatest decorum, into a meadow, about one hundred yards from the house and drawing a circle about twenty feet diameter, they stepped within it, waiting for the spirit to make its appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="034482_0053_0FFDE7D4F04F9D60"/>After a short time, the spirit whistling at the distance of about sixty yards from the circle, the commander then left the company and went to converse with the spirit; he soon returned with orders from the spirit, that all those who had the money, should retire to a certain tree, about forty yards from the circle. Now those who had the money went with the commander to the tree. The spirit appeared about twenty yards distant from the tree, with a sheet around him, jumping and stamping, repeating these words, "<HI>Look to</HI> GOD!" Those that stood by the tree made a short complicated prayer, and laying the money at the root of the tree for the spirit to receive, they retired to the company. They all returned to the house, observing the greatest order, trembling at every noise and gazing in every direction; supposing they were surrounded by hob∣goblins, apparitions, witches and the devil. Rogers and two of his associates pretended to give up the money which was only blank paper.</P>
<P>This pretended spirit was one of the associates with a white sheet around him, and a machine over his mouth that his voice might not be de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cted by any that knew him; and immediately after the spirit had deposited his money, this spirit takes it to himself, which was about forty pounds.</P>
<P>Previous to this, Rogers pulverized some bones and had given it to the commander, declaring that it was the dust of their bodies, and each man must have some of this powder in a paper sealed, as a token of the spirits approbation, &amp; that he was one of the company. This powder was to be kept secret, and no one to touch it upon his peril. A sufficient quantity of liquor was also prepared, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e spirit had ordered to be used very freely; then each one taking a hearty dram, they all united in fervent prayer, after which the meeting was concluded.</P>
<P>It is very obvious that spiritous liquors, when taken in large q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ntities, will augm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the ideas of men and induce them to anticipate profit and pleasure, although they are inaccessible in futurity.—Some of the
<PB N="24" REF="034482_0054_0FFDE7D7C32F8570"/>
members caused great disturbance, by their divin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ inadvertantly, to excess in that powerful stimulus, but it is something pleasing to see aged, sober, ab∣st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ious men with their ideas raised, put on cheer∣fulness and viva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y.</P>
<P>Thus they proceeded as above mentioned, in giv∣ing their money to the spirit every few evenings.— The spirits brought to the commander several curio∣sities, that were to be exhibited to the company in order to confirm their faith, but were to be delivered to the spirits whenever they called for them.</P>
<P>Various ceremonies were performed that I shall omit as they are too simple to mention, but every means were taken in order to make the members use liquor freely, the spirits gave unto the command∣er a compounded ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s that was to be made into pills, and each one to take a pill at every meeting, and except he used ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y freely of liquor it would operate in making his mouth and lips swell; thus they caused some to drink to exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss through fear, although they before observed the greatest tempe∣rance, and in fact some drank to that degree, to ob∣viate the effects of the pill, that they were almost in∣capable of navigating in the night.</P>
<P>Thus the company had increased to about thirty-seven in number; and the greater part had given the money to the sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rits and circumstances prevent∣ed or delayed the rest from doing it, although every one was as bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssible and spared no pains to procure the money.</P>
<P>The company were now all engaged being much augment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with the prospect of being rich a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on expected to reap the harvest with pleasure, and receive their anticipated gain; but an accident now occurs, that terminates in the discovery of the plot, which is this: One of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he aged members that had one of these papers, supposed to contain some of the dust of the body of the spirits, as I before mention∣ed▪
<PB N="25" REF="034482_0054_0FFDE7D7C32F8570"/>
was to be kept secret and no one to touch it. This man, leaving it accidently in his pocket one day in the house, his wife happened to find it, broke it open and perceiving the contents, feared to touch it supposing it to be witchcraft: She went immediate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to the priest for advice—He, not knowing i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> composition was un∣willing to touch it for fear it might have some ope∣ration upon him.</P>
<P>When her husband discovered what she had done, he was much terrified, declaring that she had ruined him forever, in breaking open that paper. This made her more solicitous to know the contents; and she de∣claring not to devulge any thing, he told her the whole of their proceedings; she insisted on it, they were serv∣ing the devil, and thought it her duty, to put an end to such proceedings. This made great disturbance in the company, and Rogers and his associates were in disguise every night, appearing to particular persons as spirits, in order to confirm them in the faith and prevent a discovery. At last one evening Rogers having drank too much of the good creature, taking a sheet with him rode to a house of a certain gentleman in order to converse with him at a spirit; but making many blunders the woman thought it was a man, but after conversing with him some time, and going to prayer, Rogers departed declaring▪ that he was the spirit of a just man.</P>
<P>In the morning as soon as it was light, the man went out where the spirit appeared, and as there had been a heavy dew that night, he perceived the tracks of a man, and following him some distance to the fence where he perceived a horse had been tied; he then tracking the horse to the door where Rogers lived—But as Rogers was not within, he followed the same track to the house of a certain gentleman, about half a mile distant, where he found Rogers; and as the gentleman of the house had, the evening before, lent Rogers a horse, together with many other circumstan∣ces, sufficient to convict him. The authority was
<PB N="26" REF="034482_0055_0FFDE7DB9F3E69C0"/>
then consulted, and judging him culpable, he was im∣mediately apprehended and committed to prison.</P>
<P>This detection greatly alarmed the whole company, as they were unwilling to believe that Rogers was the spirit, even when the clearest evidence demonstrated the fact, but Rogers declaring his innocence, was in a few days bailed out, by a gentleman that I shall call by the name of compassion, and to this gentleman Rogers ought ever to pay a debt of gratitude and benevolence.</P>
<P>After Rogers was clear of the gaol, he perceived he was among his enemies, he therefore made his flight, but being pursued and apprehended the second time, he confessed his faults, and owned that for his conduct and the expressions he had used in his projects, he de∣served punishment; but fortune favored him, and he once more eluded their hands.</P>
<P>Now many threatenings and horrid imprecations proceed from many after this man, who only a few days before, they revered and thought him a superior being.</P>
<P>The cause of these imprecations being cast after him is very obvious, that is while he continued with them in parables, working miracles, he promised them vast riches, but now he is gone, their hopes are all eradicated. But ought not the county of M— to perpetuate and honor the name of Rogers for eradicating ignorance and causing the light of reason to illume the minds of many, where obscurity had reigned for many years?</P>
<P>There have been various reports propagated con∣cerning the sum that Rogers and his associates ob∣tained from the believers of witchcraft, but the whole amount was about five hundred pounds. But after Rogers had taken the veil from their eyes, and extracted money from their pockets, they were unwil∣ling that he should have any compensation, but insist∣ed that he should be brought to condign punishment, therefore Rogers is detected in his knavery, and his ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ciates are unknown to the world; but had Rogers persevered, and avoided detection until all had given
<PB N="27" REF="034482_0055_0FFDE7DB9F3E69C0"/>
in their money, he would have left them in ignorance waiting with patience, for the return of the spirit, as was the case with the former company; but his being detected, and confession, demonstrated to every person that there was neither witchcraft nor black art in any of his performances, which they thought to proceed from supernatural power. I am confident that this occurrence is sufficient to exterpate all capri∣cious notions of witchcraft, wizzards, hobgoblins, ap∣paritions and frightful imaginations from the minde of rational beings.</P>
<P>I am confident that there are many such kinds of impositions transacted by particular persons, and many illiterate and vulgar readily believe that they have power sufficient to call into being the souls of those dead bodies that have long slept dorment in the earth▪ But let reason be our guide, and we shall soon exclaim against such capricious declarations—But one half of the world will not investigate whether these things are either probable or possible, but proceed with alacri∣ty, upon the affirmation of others. Again, there are some, that are as destitute of honesty as the devil is of holiness, and will persevere in hopes of gain, and will grasp at every opportunity to take advantage, but when they are outwitted, they will exclaim against knavey and plead innocence.</P>
<P>It is obvious to every person that it is among the most vulgar and illiterate part of the world, where the capricious notions of witchcraft and hobgoblins reside. But in those parts of the world where learning and science has prevailed, every idea or pretension towards raising demons are excluded. The Laplanders the most ignorant beings on earth, pretend to work miracles, raise, demons, and predict future events, and many with weak intellects and tremulous readily adhere to their fantastical declarations; but nature is uniform in her course, and deviates not, and when such wonderful phaenomena presents, as I have been treating of, we m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y reasonably expect that is the production and craft of vicious persons, to support their indolence. But
<PB N="28" REF="034482_0056_0FFDE7DE86AC0200"/>
the flexibility and readiness of man, to adhere to ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cious declarations, when interest occurs, is very o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and impositions only proceed from a wan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sagacity and deliberation, to investigate whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> proposi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions are compatible with philosophy or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> course of nature.</P>
<P>In the above mentioned o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>currence, many emine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> characters, possessed of morality and veracity had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> misfortune to be led captive in pursuit of anticipa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> riches, conducted by an inferior who was as dest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of honesty, as Lucifer of holiness.

<HEAD>COURT OF KING's BENCH, WESTMINSTER. SITTING OF JUNE TWENTY-FOUR, Before LORD KENYON and a SPECIAL JURY. THE KING v. WILLIAMS, FOR PUBLISHING PAINE'S AGE OF REASON.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="speech">
<HEAD>Mr. Erskine's Speech on the part of the Prosecution:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE charge of blasphemy, which is put upon the record against the printer of this publication, is not an accusation of the servants of the crown, but comes before you sanctioned by the oaths of a grand jury of the country. It stood for trial upon a for∣mer day; but it happening, as it frequently does, without any imputation upon the gentlemen named in the pannel, that a sufficient number did not appear to constitute a full special jury, I thought it my duty to withdraw the cause from trial, till I could have the opportunity which is now open to me of addres∣sing myself to you, who were originally appointed to try it. I pursued this course, however, from no jealousy of the common juries appointed by the laws for the ordinary service of the court, since my whole life has been one continued experience of their virtues; but because I thought it of great im∣portance, that those who were to decide upon a cause so very momentous to the public, should have the highest possible qualifications for the decision. That they should not only be men capable from their educations of forming an enlightened judgment, but
<PB N="4" REF="034482_0058_0FFDE7E31EB3FC40"/>
that their situations should be such as to bring them within the full view of their enlightened coun∣try, to which in character and in estimation, they were in their own turns to be responsible.</P>
<P>Not having the honour, gentlemen, to be sworn for the king as one of his counsel, it has fallen much oftener to my lot to defend indictments for libels, than to assist in the prosecution of them. But I feel no embarrassment from that recollection; since I shall not be found to-day to express a sentiment, or to utter an expression inconsistent with those inva∣luable principles for which I have uniformly con∣tended in the defence of others. Nothing that I have ever said, either professionally or personally for the Liberty of the Press, do I mean to-day to contrad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct or counteract. On the contrary, I desire to preface the very short discourse I have to make, with reminding you, that it is your most solemn duty to take care that it suffers no injury in your hands. A free and unlicensed press <HI>(in the just and legal sense of the expression)</HI> has led to all the blessings both of religion and government, which Great Britain or any part of the world at this moment enjoys, and is calculated still farther to ad∣vance mankind to higher degrees of civilization and happiness. But this freedom, like every other, must be limited to be enjoyed, and like every human ad∣vantage, may be defeated by its abuse.</P>
<P>Gentlemen! the defendant stands indicted for having published this book, which I have only read from the obligations of professionly duty, and which I arose from the reading of with astonishment and disgust. Standing here with all the privileges be∣longing to the highest counsel for the crown, I shall be entitled to reply to any defence that shall be made for the publication. I shall wait with patience till I hear it. Indeed, if I were to anticipate the defence which I hear and read of, it would be defaming by
<PB N="5" REF="034482_0058_0FFDE7E31EB3FC40"/>
anticipation, the learned counsel who is to make it. For if I am to collect it, even from a formal notice given to the prosecutors in the course of the pro∣ceedings, I have to expect, that instead of a de∣fence conducted according to the rules and princi∣ples of English law and justice, the foundation of all our laws, and the sanctions of all our justice, are to be struck at and insulted. What is the force of that jurisdiction which enables the court to sit in judgment? What but the oath which his lordship, as well as yourselves, have sworn upon the gospel to fulfil. Yet in the king's court, where his majes∣ty is himself also sworn to administer the justice of England—in the king's court—which receives its high authority under a solemn oath to maintain the christian religion, as it is promulgated by God in the Holy Scriptures, I am nevertheless called upon as counsel for the prosecution to produce a certain book described in the indictment to be the Holy Bible. No man deserves to be upon the rolls of the court, who dares, as an attorney, to put his name to such a notice. It is an insult to the authority and dignity of the court of which he is an officer; since it seems to call in question the very foundation of its jurisdiction. If this is to be the spirit and temper of the defence; if, as I collect from that ar∣ray of books which are spread upon the benches be∣hind me, this publication is to be vindicated by an attack of all the truths which the christian religion promulgates to mankind, let it be remembered that such an argument was neither suggested nor justi∣fied by any thing said by me on the part of the pro∣sacution. <HI>In this stage of the proceedings,</HI> I shall call for reverence to the Sacred Scr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ptures, not from their merits, unbounded as they are, but from their authority in a christian country—not from the obli∣gations of conscience, but from the rules of law. For my own par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Gentlemen, I have ever been deeply
<PB N="6" REF="034482_0059_0FFDE7E6EDD57988"/>
devoted to the truths of Christianity, and my firm belief in the Holy Gospel is by no means owing to the prejudices of education, (though I was religious∣ly educated by the best of parents) but arises from the fullest and most continued reflections of my ri∣per years and understanding. It forms at this mo∣ment the great consolation of a life, which, as a shadow, must pass away; and without it, indeed▪ I should consider my long course of health and pros∣perity (perhaps too long and too uninterrupted to be good for any man) only as the dust which the wind scatters, and rather as a snare than as a blessing.— Much, however, as I wish to support the authority of Scripture from a reasoned consideration of it, I shall repress that subject for the present.

be effected. The solution is easy:—Let us examine what are the genuine principles of the li∣berty of the press, as they regard writings upon general subjects, unconnected with the personal reputations of private men, which are wholly fo∣reign to the present enquiry! They are full of sim∣plicity, and are brought as near perfection, by the law of England, as perhaps, is consistent with any of the frail institutions of mankind.</P>

The same principles, which vindicate civil conten∣tions honestly directed, extend their protection to the sharpest controversies on religious faiths. This rational and legal course of improvement, was re∣cognized and ratified by Lord Kenyon, as the law of England, in a late trial at Guildhall, when he look∣ed back with gratitude to the labors of the reform∣ers, as the fountains of our religious emancipation, and of the civil blessings that followed in their train. The English constitution, indeed, does not stop short in the toleration of religious opinions, but li∣berally extends it to practice. It permits every man, <HI>even publicly,</HI> to worship God according to his own conscience, though in marked dissent from the national establishment, so as he professes the general faith, which is the sanction of all our moral duties, and the only pledge of our submission to the system which constitutes a state. Is not this system of free∣dom of controversy, and freedom of worship, suf∣ficient for all the purposes of human happiness and improvement? And can it be necessary for either, that the law should hold out indemnity to those who wholly abjure and revile the government of their country, or the religion on which it rests for its foundation? I expect to hear, in answer to what I am now saying, much that will offend me. My learned friend, from the difficulties of his situation, which I know, from experience, how to feel for very sincerely, may be driven to advance proposi∣tions which it may be my duty, with much freedom, to reply to; and the law will sanction that freedom. But will not the ends of justice be completely an∣swered by that right, to point out the errors of his discourse in terms that are decent and calculated to expose its defects; or will any arguments suffer, or will public justice be impeded, because neither pri∣vate honor and justice, nor public decorum, would induce my telling my learned friend, that he was a
<PB N="9" REF="034482_0060_0FFDE7E99CB49260"/>
fool, a liar, and scoundrel in the face of the court, because I differed from him in argument or opin∣ion? This is just the distinction between a book of free legal controversy, and the book which I am arraigning before you. Every man has a legal right to investigate, with modesty and decency, contro∣versial points of the christian religion; but no man, consistently with a law, which only exists under its sanctions, has a right, not only broadly to deny its very existence, but to pour forth a shocking and insulting invective, which the lowest establishments, in the gradations of civil authority, ought not to be permitted to suffer, and which soon would be borne down by insolence and disobedience, if they did.</P>
<P>The same principle pervades the whole system of the law, not merely in its abstract theory, but in its daily and most applauded practice. The inter∣course between the sexes and which, properly regu∣lated, not only contiues but humanizes and adorns our natures, is the foundation of all the thousand romances, plays, and novels, which are in the hands of every body. Some of them lead to the confirma∣tion of every virtuous principle; others though with the same profession, address the imagination in a manner to lead the passions into dangerous excesses. But though the law does not nicely discriminate the various shades which distinguish these works from one another, so as that it suffers many to pass through its liberal spirit, that upon principle might be suppressed, would it, or does it tolerate, or does any decent man contend that it ought to pass by unpunished, libels of the most shameless obscenity, manifestly pointed to debauch innocence, and to blast and poison the morals of the rising generation? This is only another illustration to demonstrate the obvious distinction between the work of an author, who fairly exercises the powers of his mind, in investi∣gating doctrinal points in the religion of any country,
<PB N="10" REF="034482_0061_0FFDE7EB77047518"/>
and him who attacks the rational existence of every religion, and brands with absurdity and folly the state which sanctions, and the obedient tools who cherish the delusion. But this publication appears to me to be as mischievous and cruel in its probable effects, as it is manifestly illegal in its principles; because it strikes at the best, sometimes, alas! the only refuge and consolation amidst the distresses and afflictions of the world. The poor and humble, whom it af∣fects to pity, may be stabbed to the heart by it.— They have more occasion for firm hopes beyond the grave, than those who have greater comforts to ren∣der life delightful. I can conceive a distressed but virtuous man, surrounded by children looking up to him for bread, when he has none to give them, sink∣ing under the last day's labor, and unequal to the next, yet still looking up with confidence to the hour when all tears shall be wiped from the eyes of affliction, bearing the burden laid upon him by a mysterious Providence which he adores, and look∣ing forward with exaltation to the revealed pro∣mises of his Creator, when he shall be greater than the greatest, and happier than the happiest of man∣kind. What a change in such a mind might not be wrought by such a mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iless publication? Gentle∣men! Whether these remarks are the overcharged declamations of an accusing Counsel, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the just re∣flections of a man anxious for the public freedom, which is best secured by the morals of a nation, will be best settled by an appeal to the passages in the work, that are selected by the indictment for your consideration and judgment. You are at li∣berty to connect them with every context and se∣quel, and to bestow upon them the mildest inter∣pretation. [<HI>Here Mr. Erskine read and commented upon several of the selected passages, and then pro∣ceeded as follows:</HI>]</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it would be useless and disgusting to
<PB N="11" REF="034482_0061_0FFDE7EB77047518"/>
enumerate the other passages within the scope of the indictment. How any man can rationally vin∣dicate the publication of such a book, in a country where the Christian Religion is the very foundation of the law of the land, I am totally at a loss to con∣ceive, and have no ideas for the discussion of! How is a tribunal, whose whole jurisdiction is founded upon the solemn belief and practice of what is denied as falsehood, and reprobated as impiety to deal with such an anomolous defence? Upon what principle is it even offered to the court, whose authority is contemned and mocked at? If the religion propo∣sed to be called in question, is not previously adopt∣ed in belief and solemnly acted upon, what authori∣ty has the court to pass any judgment at all of acquit∣tal or condemnation? Why am I now, or upon any other occasion, to submit to your Lordship's author∣ity? Why am I now, or at any time, to address twelve of my equals, as I am now addressing you, with reverence and submission! Under what sanc∣tion are the witnesses to give their evidence, with∣out which there can be no trial? Under what obli∣gations can I call upon you, the jury representing your country, to administer justice? Surely upon no other than that you are sworn to administer it under the oaths you have taken. The whole judi∣cial fabric from the king's sovereign authority to the lowest office of magistracy, has no other foundation. The whole is built, both in form and substance, up∣on the same oath of every one of its ministers to do justice <HI>as God shall help them hereafter.</HI> What God? And what hereafter? That God undoubtedly who has commanded kings to rule, and judges to decree with justice, who has said to witness, not by the voice of nature, but in revealed commandments— <HI>Thou shalt not bear false testimony against thy neigh∣bor;</HI> and who has enforced obedience to them by the revelation of the unutterable blessings which
<PB N="12" REF="034482_0062_0FFDE7F034DE0AD8"/>
shall attend their observances, and the awful pun∣ishments which shall await upon their transgressions. But it seems, this is an age of reason, and the time and person are at last arrived, that are to dissipate the errors which have overspread the past genera∣tions of ignorance. The believers in Christianity are many, but it belongs to the few that are wise to correct their credulity. Belief is an act of reason, and superior reason may, therefore, dictate to the weak. In running the mind along the long list of sincere and devout Christians, I cannot help lament∣ing, that Newton had not lived to this day, to have had his <HI>shallowness</HI> filled up with this <HI>new flood</HI> of <HI>light.</HI>—But the subject is too awful for irony. I will speak plainly and directly. Newton was a Christian—Newton, whose mind burst forth from the fetters cast by nature upon our finite concep∣tions—Newton whose science was truth, and the foundation of whose knowledge of it was philoso∣phy. Not those visionary and arrogant presump∣tions which too often usurp its name, but philosophy resting upon the basis of mathematics, which, like figures, cannot lie. Newton, who carried the line and rule to the uttermost barriers of creation, and explored the principles by which, no doubt, all cre∣ated matter is held together and exists. But this extraordinary man, in the mighty reach of his mind, overlooked, perhaps, the errors, which a minuter investigation of the created things on this earth might have taught him, of the essence of his Creator. What shall then be said of the great Mr. Boyle, who locked into the Organic structure of all matter, even to the brute inanimate substances, which the foot treads on. Such a man may be supposed to have been equally qualified with Mr. Paine to look up through nature to nature's God. Yet the result of all his contemplation was the most confirmed and devout belief in all which the other holds in con∣tempt,
<PB N="13" REF="034482_0062_0FFDE7F034DE0AD8"/>
as despicable and driveling superstition.— But this error might, perhaps, arise from a want of due attention to the foundations of human judgment and the structure of that understanding which God has given us for the investigation of truth—Let that question be answered by Mr. Locke, who was, to the highest pitch of devotion and adoration, a Chris∣tian. Mr. Locke, whose office was to detect the errors of thinking, by going up to the fountains of thought, and to direct into the proper track of rea∣soning, the devious mind of man, by shewing him its whole process, from the first perceptions of sense to the last conclusions of ratiocination, putting a rein besides upon false opinion, by practical rules for the conduct of human judgment. But these men were only deep thinkers, and lived in their clo∣sets, unaccustomed to the traffic of the world, and to the laws which practically regulate mankind.</P>
<P>Gentlemen! in the place where we now sit to administer the justice of this great country, above a century ago, the never to be forgotten Sir Matthew Hale presided; whose faith in christianity is an ex∣alted commentary upon its truth and reason, and whose life was a glorious example of its fruits in man, administering human justice with wisdom and purity drawn from the pure fountain of the christian dis∣pensation, which has been, and will be, in all ages, a subject of the highest reverence and admiration. But it is said by the author, that the christian fable is but the tale of the more ancient superstitions of the world, and may be easily detected by a proper understanding of the mythologies of the heathens. Did Milton understand those Mythologies? Was <HI>he</HI> less versed than Mr. Paine in the superstitions of the world? No, they were the subject of his im∣mortal song; and though shut out from all recur∣rence to them, he poured them forth from the stores of a memory rich with all that man ever knew,
<PB N="14" REF="034482_0063_0FFDE7F3010496F0"/>
and laid them in their order as the illustration of that real and exalted faith, the unquestionable source of that fervid genius, which cast a sort of shade up∣on all the other works of man—
<Q><L>He passed the bounds of flaming space</L>
<L>Where angels tremble while they gaze;</L>
<L>He saw, till blasted with excess of light,</L>
<L>He closed his eyes in endless night.</L></Q>
But it was the light of the BODY only that was ex∣tinguished; "The celestial light shone inward, and enabled him to justify the ways of God to man." The result of his thinking was nevertheless not the same as the author's. The mysterious incarnation of our Blessed Saviour (which this work blasphemes in words so wholly unfit for the mouth of a Chris∣tian, or for the ear of a court of justice, that I dare not, and will not, give them utterance) Milton made the grand conclusion of the <HI>Paradise Lost,</HI> the rest from his finished labors and the ultimate hope, expectation, and glory of the world.</P>
<Q><L>A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire,</L>
<L>The power of the Most High; he shall ascend</L>
<L>The Throne hereditary, and bound his reign</L>

<P>The immortal poet having thus put into the mouth of the angel, the prophecy of man's redemp∣tion, follows it with that solemn and beautiful admo∣nition, addressed in the poem to our great First Pa∣rent, but intended as an address to his posterity through all generations.</P>
<Q><L>This having learn'd, thou hast attain'd the sum</L>

<L>A Paradise within thee, happier far.</L></Q>
<P>Thus you find all that is great, or wise, or splen∣did, or illustrious, amongst created beings; all the minds gifted beyond ordinary nature, if not inspired by its universal author for the advancement and dig∣nity of the world, though divided by distant ages, and by the clashing opinions, distinguishing them from one another, yet joining as it were in one sub∣lime chorus, to celebrate the truths of Christianity, and laying upon its holy alters the neverfading of∣ferings of their immortal wisdom.</P>
<P>Against all its concurring testimony, we find suddenly, from the author of this book, that the bi∣ble teaches nothing but "lies, obscenity, cruelty, and injustice." Had he ever read our Saviour's ser∣mon on the Mount? Against all this concurring tes∣timony, we find suddenly, from this publication, that the Bible teaches nothing but lies, obscenity, cruelty, and injustice. Had the author or publisher ever read the sermon of <HI>Christ upon the Mount,</HI> in which the great principles of our faith and duty are sum∣moned up?—Let us all but read and practise it, and lies, obscenity, cruelty, and injustice, and all human wickedness would be banished from the world!"</P>
<P>Gentlemen, there is but one consideration more, which I cannot possibly omit, because I confess it
<PB N="16" REF="034482_0064_0FFDE7F6E2B4EEF8"/>
affects me very deeply. The author of this book has written largely on public liberty and govern∣ment; and this last performance has, on that ac∣count, been more widely circulated, and principally among those who attached themselves from principle to his former works. This circumstance renders a public attack <HI>upon all revealed religion</HI> from such a writer, infinitely more dangerous. The religious and moral sense of the people of Great-Britain, is the great anchor which alone can hold the vessel of the state amidst the storms which agitate the world; and if I could believe for a moment, that the mass of the people were to be debauched from the prin∣ciples of religion, which form the true basis of that humanity, charity, and benevolence, that has been so long the national characteristic, instead of mixing myself, as I sometimes have done, in political refor∣mations, I would rather retire to the uttermost cor∣ners of the earth to avoid their agitation; and would bear, not only the imperfections and abuses com∣plained of in our own wise establishment, but even the worst government that ever existed in the world, rather than go to the work of reformation with a multitude set free from all the charities of christiani∣ty, who had no sense of God's existence, but from Mr. Paine's observation of nature, which the mass of mankind have no leisure to contemplate; nor any belief of future rewards and punishments to animate the good in the glorious pursuit of human happi∣ness, or to deter the wicked from destroying it even in its birth. But I know the people of England bet∣ter. They are a religious people, and with the blessing of God, as far as it is in my power, I will lend my aid to keep them so. I have no objections to the freest and most extended discussions upon doc∣trinel points of the christian religion, and <HI>though the law of England does not permit it,</HI> I do not dread the reasoned arguments of Deists against the existence
<PB N="17" REF="034482_0064_0FFDE7F6E2B4EEF8"/>
of christianity itself, because, as was said by its Divine Author, if it is of God, it will stand. An intellec∣tual book, however erroneous, addressed to the in∣tellectual world upon so profound and complicated a subject, can never work the mischief which this in∣dictment is calculated to repress.—Such works will only employ the minds of men enlightened by study, to a deeper investigation of a subject well worthy of their deepest and continued contemplation. The powers of the mind are given for human improve∣ment in the progress of human existence. The changes produced by such reciprocations of lights and intelligences are certain in their progressions, and make their way imperceptably, as conviction comes upon the world, by the final and irresistible power of truth. If christianity be founded in false∣hood, let us become Deists in this manner, and I am contented. But this book has no such object, and no such capacity: it presents no arguments to the wise and enlightened. On the contrary, it treats the faith and opinions of the wisest with the most shocking contempt, and stirs up men, without the ad∣vantages of learning, or sober thinking, to a total disbelief of every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing hitherto held sacred; and consequently to a rejection of all the laws and ordi∣nances of the state, which stand only upon the assump∣tion of their truth.</P>
<P>Gentlemen! I cannot conclude without expres∣sing the deepest regret at all attacks upon the chris∣tian religion by authors who profess to promote the civil liberties of the world. For under what other auspices than christianity have the lost and subverted liberties of mankind in former ages been reasserted? By what zeal, but the warm zeal of devout chris∣tians have English liberties been redeemed and con∣secrated? Under what other sanctions, even in our own day, have liberty and happiness been extending and spreading to the uttermost corners of the earth?
<PB N="18" REF="034482_0065_0FFDE7FA01D7BDA0"/>
What work of civilization, what commonwealth of greatness, has this bold religion of nature ever esta∣blished? We see, on the contrary, the nations that have no other light than that of nature to direct them, sunk in barbarism or slaves to arbitrary govern∣ments; whilst, since the christian aera, the great ca∣reer of the world has been slowly, but clearly ad∣vancing, lighter at every step, from the awful pro∣phecies of the gospel, and leading, I trust, in the end to universal and eternal happiness. Each generation of mankind can see but a few revolving links of this mighty and mysterious chain, but by doing our seve∣ral duties in our allotted stations, we are sure that we are fulfilling the purposes of our existence. You, I trust, will fulfil yours this day!"</P>
<P>A Mr. Fleming, one of the Clerks of the Bank, was the only witness called on the part of the prose∣cution. He said, he purchased the book in question, of the defendant, at his shop, on the 7th of Februa∣ry last.</P>
<P>The Notice which Mr. Erskine mentioned in his speech was here read, and Mr. John Martin, the attorney for the defendant, readily admitted that he had sent it to those who were concerned for the pro∣secution.</P>
<P>Mr. Kyd made a very learned and ingenious speech for the defendant. He said he would endea∣vor to discharge the important duty which he ow∣ed to his client, in a manner, that was consistent with the dignity of that court, and with that decency and solemnity which, he felt, belonged to the subject. The question was, whether the author, when he wrote this book, felt as he wrote, and expressed him∣self as he felt. He humbly submitted, that the in∣ferences which Mr. Paine had drawn from the pre∣mises, were such as he might have drawn with a fair and honest intention. Whether those inferen∣ces were just or not, was totally a different ques∣tion.
<PB N="19" REF="034482_0065_0FFDE7FA01D7BDA0"/>
But, if his lordship and the gentlemen of the jury could discover no wicked or malicious intent, they would not punish a man for a mere error in judgment. If the jury could collect no wicked in∣tention in the author from reading the whole of this performance, he contended he was completely pro∣tected under the right which he and every other man had to exercise the powers of his mind in dis∣cussing any controversial points of religion. Suppo∣sing then the book had been written innocently, he might infer, as a general proposition, that it was al∣so published with an innocent intention. At the same time he admitted, that what was so written, might be published from a malicious motive, for which the publisher would be amenable to the laws of his country. The learned council next selected several passages from this performance, to shew, that the author felt the most profound reverence and veneration for the supreme being, and denied the truth of revelation only because he could not re∣concile it to the character and attributes of the Deity. It was stated in that publication, that the law of na∣ture was engraven on every man's heart, and that he might clearly collect the knowledge of that duty which he owed to his creator from a contemplation of his works. Mr. Kyd next endeavored to justify the charges made upon the Bible by the author, by a variety of passages which he selected, but which, at the desire of his lordship and the jury, he did not read, but only referred to them, and contended, that if those passages were found in any other book, they would be considered as indecent and immoral. He appealed to the writings of Dr. Lairdner, Dr. Bentley, and other eminent divines in support of the right of free discussion, upon all subjects of a controversial nature. He then spoke in severe terms of this prosecution, which he said, would ne∣ver have been instituted, had it not been for Bishop
<PB N="20" REF="034482_0066_0FFDE7FCABCEE7A0"/>
Watson's Apology, which had been very widely circulated, and had excited a curiosity to read the book, to which it was an answer; and to gratify that public curiosity, it was that this book, which, he believed, had been first published at Paris, was afterwards published in this country. Mr. Kyd in∣sisted, at a great length, upon the freedom of enqui∣ry, and a free press, and gave the reformation and revolution as two instances of the inestimable bles∣sings which had resulted from them to this country.</P>
<P>Mr. Erskine made a most eloquent reply. He said, he was bound, in respect to his learned friend, as a member of a most honorable profession, to sup∣pose, that he was placed in a very irksome situation, to be called for on a defence so exceedingly difficult to make and so extremely delicate to manage, with∣out violating that common decency that was due to a court of justice. He could not therefore help con∣sidering him as entitled to a considerable degree of indulgence. Mr. Erskine here adverted to several of the passages selected from the Old Testament by Mr. Kyd, and explained the reason of the introduc∣tion into the sacred writings. The history of man, he said, was the history of man's vices and passions, which could not be censured without adverting to their existence, and many of the instances that had been referred to were recorded as memorable warn∣ings and examples for the instruction of mankind.— Mr. E. next entered most forcibly and deeply into the evidences of christianity, particularly those that were founded on that stupendous scheme of prophe∣cy, which formed one of the most unanswerable ar∣guments for the truth of the christian religion.— "It was not," he said, the purpose of God to de∣stroy free agency by overpowering the human mind with the irresistable light, and conviction of revela∣tion, but to leave men to collect its truths, as they were gradually illustrated in the accomplish∣ment
<PB N="21" REF="034482_0066_0FFDE7FCABCEE7A0"/>
of the divine promises of the gospel. Bred as he was to the consideration of evidence, he declared he considered the prophecy concerning the destruc∣tion of the Jewish nation, if there was nothing else to support christianity, absolutely irresistable. The division of the Jews into tribes, to preserve the gen∣ealogy of Christ, the distinction of the tribe of Ju∣dah, from which he was to come; the loss of this distinction when that end was accomplished; the predicted departure of the sceptre from Israel; the destruction of the temple of Jerusalem, which im∣perial munificence in vain attempted to re-build to disgrace the prophecy; the dispersion of this na∣tion over the face of the whole earth, the spreading of the gospel throughout the world; the persecution of its true ministers, and the foretold superstitions which for ages had defiled its worship—these were topics upon which Mr. Erskine expatiated with great eloquence, and produced a most powerful effect on every part of the audience. He concluded with a vindication of the authors of this prosecution. He said, they were men of the highest character and greatest consideration in the country. Many of them were charged with the offices of religion, others of them were cloathed with the robes of magistracy; most of them were men of deep learn∣ing and thinking; and all of them justly entitled to the thanks of the public for their noble exertions in the cause of religion and virtue.</P>

<P>Being now in possession of all the facts of this ease, and convinced, in my own mind, what conclu∣sion ought to be drawn from them, I am not sure, that it is necessary to say any thing at all to you up∣on the subject. Gentlemen, before you proceed to decide on the merits of this, or any other cause, it is
<PB N="22" REF="034482_0067_0FFDE7FE3AFC8E30"/>
proper to see whether the parties litigating stand in a fair light before you. I was extremely hurt when the learned Counsel for the defendant thought fit to state to you, with very considerable emphasis, and a very determined tone of voice, that this was a scandalous prosecution. I cannot help wishing that this sentence had not been uttered.—Who commenced this prosecution, I certainly know not. But from what fell from the very learn∣ed Counsel who just sat down, I am inclined to sup∣pose it proceeded from a society of gentlemen insti∣tuted for the most important of all purposes, for preserving the morals of the people; a society com∣posed of Clergymen, and Laymen of the most re∣spectable characters in the kingdom, who, feeling how the country is overrun with profligacy and wickedness, which boldly raise their heads in defi∣ance of the law of the land, were determined to see whether, in the first place, by admonition and ad∣vice, they could not stop the torrent of vice and im∣morality; and secondly, if that should fail, to try what could be done by punishment. If people with the very best intentions carry on prosecutions that are oppressive, the end may not always perhaps sanctify the means. But the manner in which this prosecution has been conducted, is certainly not oppressive; for instead of proceeding in the more expensive mode, the prosecutors went before a Grand Jury of the country: and it was necessary to obtain the opinion of that Grand Jury before the party could be put in process.—Gentlemen! we sit here in a Christian Assembly to administer the laws of the land, and I am to take my knowledge of what the law is from that which has been sanc∣tioned by a great variety of legal decision. I am bound to state to you, what my predecessors in Mr. Woolston's case (2 Strange, 834) stated half a century ago, in this Court of which I
<PB N="23" REF="034482_0067_0FFDE7FE3AFC8E30"/>
am an humble member, namely, that the christian religion is part of the law of the land. Christianity from its earliest institution met with its opposers. Its professors were very soon called upon to publish their apologies for the doctrines they had embraced. In what manner they did that, &amp; whether they had the advantage of their adversaries, or sunk under the su∣periority of their arguments mankind for near two thousand years have had an opportunity of judging. They have seen that Julian, Justin Martyr, and o∣ther apologists have written, and have been of opin∣ion the argument was in favour of those very publi∣cations. The world has lately been favoured with another apology from a most learned and respecta∣ble prelate, who calls his work <HI>An Apology for the Christian Religion.</HI> I shall not decide between the merits of the one and the other. The publications themselves are in the hands of the world: and I sincerely wish in the concluding language of the work to which I have just referred (I do not affect to use the very words) I sincerely wish that the author of the work in question may become a partaker of that faith in revealed religion, which he has so gross∣ly defamed, and may be enabled to make his peace with God for that disorder which he has endea∣voured to the utmost of his power to introduce into society. We have heard to-day, that the light of Nature, and the contemplation of the works of cre∣ation are sufficient, without any other revelation of the Divine Will. Socrates, Plato, Xenophon, Tul∣ly—each of them in their turns professed they want∣ed other lights; and knowing and confessing that God was good, they took it for granted that the time would come when he would impart a farther revelation of his will to mankind. Though they walked as it were through a cloud, darkly, they hop∣ed their posterity would almost see God face to face. —This condition of mankind has met with repre∣hension
<PB N="24" REF="034482_0068_0FFDE8020CC62440"/>
to-day. But I shall not pursue this argu∣ment. Fully impressed with the great truths of re∣ligion, which, thank God, I was taught in my ear∣ly years to believe, and of which the hour of reflec∣tion and inquiry, instead of producing any doubt has fully confirmed me in. I expected the learned Counsel for the Defendant would have differed the case of the publisher from that of the author of this work; that he would have endeavored to convince you that whatever guilt might belong to the author, nothing was imputable to the publisher. He has, however to my utter surprise, exactly reversed the case. He tells you it was originally published at Paris in 1794; that the feelings of the author's friends were wounded by this work, which I call a nefarious publication, and that it was in a great measure forgotten; and you are now called upon to judge of the merits or demerits of the publisher, who has brought forth a still-born work, forgotten by every body, till he ventured in defiance of the verdicts of mankind on the author's political works to send it forth among the inhabitants of this coun∣try. Unless it was for the most malignant purposes, I cannot conceive how it was published. It is how∣ever for you to judge of it, and to do justice between the public and the defendant."</P>

<HEAD>AN ORATION DELIVERED ON THE
<DATE>FOURTH JULY, 1794.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>THIS auspicious day, my fellow citizens, is the epoch from which we date our national existe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce; it ranks first in our American calander. From one extreme to the other of these extensive states, does this anniversary of freedom and independ∣ence call forth the patriotic citizens of Americ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to mirth and festive joy. The birth-day of kings, their accessions to their thrones, and the periods of their victories, when thousands of their fellow men have fallen, constitute, in general, the great festivals of the earth; but in the view of reason and philosophy these are days of sorrow not of joy. We, on the contrary, assemble to celebrate a day,
<PB N="8" REF="034482_0071_0FFDE80BE986BCC0"/>
the first in the annals of time, which gave to a kind equal rights and equal privileges—How striking the contrast! the one sinks and degrades, the other exalts and ennobles the human charact∣er—How august the contemplation! that through the various changes and national revolutions which the historic page unfolds, this should be the first p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>d of time, when in truth and reality man became re-invested with that equal liberty, which the God of nature gave him. It is right therefore, that we commemorate this joyous day; and in the commemoration there∣of, what contemplations, my fellow citizens, more useful &amp; instructive, than the causes from whence resulted this our great revolution. The principles on which it was defended and supported—the distinguished rank it takes among the other revo∣lutions of the earth, and the conduct of its brave defenders in the days of danger and distress.</P>
<P>A British political writer observes, that the
<Q>American war originated in parliamentary job∣bing, and its great purpose was to transfer enormous masses of English property into loans, funds and taxes, to form that corrupt ministe∣rial phalanx called the friends of government; while this faction, like a malignant disease, was
<PB N="9" REF="034482_0071_0FFDE80BE986BCC0"/>
draining the vital substances of Britain, and even armies and navies were meerly its ramifi∣cations.</Q></P>
<P>If this representation of the cause of the Ame∣rican war be true, and such a faction, or such a parliament, could obtain such an ascendency in Britain as to draw forth the vital substances of that nation to effect such purposes, how awfully wretched must have been our situation and cir∣cumstances had they been enabled to rear and establish the standard of corruption on our Ame∣rican shores—instead of rejoicing this day, we should have been mourning—instead of celebrat∣ing the triumphs of freedom, we should have been languishing in the shackles of despotism.</P>
<P>The frequent representations which were made in England of the wealth of the Americans by the British officers, who had served here against the French, and who had fared sumptuously at the American tables, roused into action the contemp∣lations which had long been entertained by the government, to raise a revenue in America.</P>
<P>Early in 1764, the question of right to tax was brought forward in the house of commons, and so strong was the impulse of avarice, and such the
<PB N="10" REF="034482_0072_0FFDE80EC8246190"/>
influence which a corrupt administration had ac∣quired at this period, that not a person in the house ventured to controvert the right. After∣wards however, many illustrious characters came forward in the opposition; and the names of those whose motives were pure and uncorrupt will ever brighten and adorn the page of Ameri∣can freedom. They improved us in the knowledge of our political rights, and confirmed us in the sup∣port of them. The first, the foremost, and I may add, the most sincere, was the celebrated Colonel Barre, for whose noble defence of virtue, and America, in opposition to the whole house; "May recorded honors gather round his monument and thicken over him."</P>
<P>Subsequent to the revolution of 1688, the most prominent features in the British system of politics was "That taxation could only result from repre∣sentation," or, in other words, that the property of the subject could never be taken without his consent. But the influence of corruption and the anxiety to draw resources from America to sup∣port its sooted stream, in all its branches, from the king on the throne down to the lowest ministerial hireling, had opperated such an entire dereliction of principles, that when the question of right, as
<PB N="11" REF="034482_0072_0FFDE80EC8246190"/>
before observed, first came forward, there was not an advocate in its favor; and they considered the future opposition as merely the petulance of discontent and not the voice of reason.</P>
<P>From hence, my fellow citizens, we have this instructive lesson, never to permit a departure from a political principle of freedom, known, es∣tablished and felt to be right—it augurs corruption in the government, and will never be attempted from motives pure and virtuous.</P>
<P>To supply the priviledged and pampered orders of state, the heart of poverty in Britain had been probed, from every quarter, for many years, and for new sources they turned their baleful eyes across the atlantic.</P>
<P>America was seen like a fair flower rising in the wilderness, untouched and unblighted by the breath of corruption. The hierarchy of that country ever closely united with the ministry and with hands equally impure, as anxiously desired to grasp and enjoy the flower—it was as strongly inculcated that the establishment and support of a Bishopric in America, with its desirable append∣ages, was as essential to the support and preserva∣tion of the mother church, as the obtaining a
<PB N="12" REF="034482_0073_0FFDE8106D8C89A8"/>
revenue was essential to the support of the state▪ Thus united with these views and these desires, they commenced the operation from whence re∣sulted the glorious revolution which we this day celebrate.</P>
<P>But let us turn, my countrymen, from that bar∣ren waste "in which no salutary plant takes root, no verdure quickens," to a soil, as I willingly be∣lieve, pure as the limped stream, and fertile in every great and good qualification.</P>
<P>It is the observation of an elegant writer, "That the Americans, dispersed throughout an immense continent, free as the wilds of nature which surrounded them; amidst their rocks, their mountains, the vast plains of their deserts, on the confines of those forests, in which all is still in its sa∣vage state, and where there are no traces of either the slavery or the tyranny of man; seemed to re∣ceive from every natural object a lesson of liberty and independence—as far removed from riches as from poverty, they were not corrupted either by the excess of luxury or the excess of want. Feed us with food convenient for us, lest we be full and deny thee, and say, who is the Lord, or lest we be poor and steal and take the name of our God in vain," was their united prayer.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="034482_0073_0FFDE8106D8C89A8"/>From this natural equality in which man is more jealous of his rights than perhaps in any other state of society, flowed a greater effusion of knowledge than falls to the lot of mankind in ge∣neral, as they better understood their rights, so were they more ready to repel every unjust inva∣sion of them.</P>
<P>The principle, that representation and taxation must go together, was well understood in America; there were comparatively few, so illiterate, but knew it to be a political axiom; none so insensible but felt it as their only security against the grasp of oppression—this principle individuals in Ame∣rica opposed in their public prints to the repeated attempts making in Britain to bring forward bills to tax them; and illustrated it with a strength of argument that sunk beneath contempt the vile and slavish yell of the minions of despotism, that all opposition to government was rebellion, and re∣bellion treason.</P>
<P>The plan however progressed in Britain, and when matured, was brought into action; it was like putting fire to the train; the noble sentiment of <HI>Freedom or Death</HI> spread quick as the electric flame from one extreme of our continent to the other, and roused, as it were, instantaneously, three millions of people in support of their right.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="034482_0074_0FFDE81213FA1320"/>The forming a Congress by a representation from the then different Colonies, circumstanced as they were, is a phenominon in political science, and the strongest evidence of the happy effects resulting from a general diffusion of knowledge among the people; spread over an immense tract of territory, strangers to each other, with different customs, manners and local prejudices, under strong colli∣sions of interest, flowing from commercial rival∣ships and disputed boundaries of territory, reason and policy required their union under one head, to render effectual the defence of their freedom.

of opinion, as to the means of obtaining it, was discussed with the calmness of reason, seeking for truth, and not with the keen personal invective only aiming at party superiority. And to the honor of our country would it be, could we in truth pass this eulogium from the Congress of '75 to every subsequent Congress of America. Their compositions united a manliness of sentiment with an elegance of stile that seemed inspired by the pure spirit of the cause in which they were engag∣ed, and will go down to posterity as illustrious monuments of American genius.</P>
<P>To show to you, my countrymen, the character of these our youthful politicians in the mind of the un∣prejudiced in Europe; permit me to repeat the lan∣guage of the first statesman and orator of Britain: "The representatives of America (said he) meet with the sentiments and temper, and speak the sense of the continent. For genuine sagacity, for singular moderation, for solid wisdom, manly spi∣rit, sublime sentiments and simplicity of language, for every thing respectable and honorable, the Congress of Philadelphia shine unrivalled. They are viewed as the northern constellation of glori∣ous worthies illuminating and warming the New World." These eulogiums resulted from that
<PB N="16" REF="034482_0075_0FFDE81703DC4BE8"/>
policy, spirit and union, which they exercised in the support of their grand principle, that no Ame∣rican could be taxed without his consent, expres∣sed by himself or representative, which right they contended, our ancestors derived both from nature and the British constitution, and transmitted, un∣marred, to their posterity; and to the honor of our country be it remembered, that this principle, as their leading star, was unremittingly pursued from the gloom of unsuccessful supplication to the splendor of victory and acknowledged sovereignty.</P>
<P>But let us pass to a comparative view of this our glorious revolution, with the other revoluti∣ons of the earth, having <HI>Liberty</HI> for their object. In one respect, my countrymen, there is a distin∣guishing difference which gives lustre to the Ame∣rican character. The revolution of this country proceeded from a well digested knowledge of civil rights, the result of philosophical reflection, and speculative enquiry. The other revolutions, which have preceded it, have been caused either by a series of oppressions which could no longer be endured, or have sprung from the impulse of the moment, occasioned by some unexpected and vio∣lent act of despotism that tortured human nature into action—the one pourtrays the reason and reflection of man, the other the limits of his pati∣ence,
<PB N="17" REF="034482_0075_0FFDE81703DC4BE8"/>
and the keenness of his sensations. The Romans, so celebrated in history for their patrio∣tic virtues, were roused from slavery to freedom by the sight of the poignard reeking with the blood of the virtuous Lucretia.</P>
<P>The death of the chaste Virginia, by the hand of her father to save her honor from the tyrannic Decimvir, and her body exposed to the public view, impelled that people again to revolt and to annihilate the order of the Decimvirs, which had violated the rights of the Roman citizens.</P>
<P>And to come down to more modern times—the introduction of the inquisition into the Nether∣lands by the despotic Philip,—The terrible spec∣tacles daily presented by that awful institution of men perishing in the flames on account of their religion; and the ignomineous death of Egmont and Horn, two popular favorites, at length tor∣tured the people into that opposition which, even∣tually, issued in the emancipation of the seven united provinces. Even the hardy robust inha∣bitants of the Alps, since so famous for the Hel∣vetic confederacy, for a long time, bore the most degrading oppressions until the manly virtues of a TELL excited them to resistance. Nor is the important revolution in France, so justly celebrat∣ed
<PB N="18" REF="034482_0076_0FFDC59269025E08"/>
for the magnitude of its object, and the trans∣cendant brilliancy of execution, an exception; those heroic and unconquerable republicans had borne the hard hand of despotism, till forced by its oppressive weight to avenge their wrongs.</P>
<P>The guardian genius of America, on the con∣trary, would never permit the fangs of despotism to fasten on our hallowed soil. And may it fore∣ver be our great characteristic to foresee danger at a distance, and to repel its approach on principle and rational enquiry.</P>
<P>Where are the liberties of the republics which have preceded us; except the Swis Cantons▪ I know of no republican state at this day but has returned to the dark glooms of despotism, and the name of <HI>Republic</HI> and <HI>Liberty</HI> is, with them, meer sounding brass and tinkling cimbal. The cause of this awful relapse from freedom to slavery is well worth the enquiry of every American. And the great source from whence it has proceeded, my countrymen, is the want of general instruction and information among the people. This forms an unsurmountable barrier against their investigat∣ing their political rights, renders them inattentive thereto, and obliges them to intrust the sacred deposit in the hands of a few individuals, whose
<PB N="19" REF="034482_0076_0FFDC59269025E08"/>
conduct they are unable to scrutinize, and subjects them to be carried away credulous victims to the artifice of every designing demagogue.</P>
<P>But it is time we turn to a summary consideration of the conduct of the brave defenders of our coun∣try in its days of danger and distress. "And what hand withholds the lawrel so justly due to the virtues of our patriotic warriors," called from the peaceful walks of private life by their coun∣try's danger—from citizens they became soldiers. What hardships, incident to that situation, for se∣ven long years did they not endure? Where is the example in history of equal gallantry and per∣severance in every difficulty and danger unsupplied and unpaid, owing to the impoverished state of their country. In the dark seasons of the war when the genius of liberty seemed to languish un∣der the pressure of despotism, and many of her sons, in moments of despondency, sought protec∣tion from the relentless foe; who saw the army discover simptoms of despair, or heard from them the language of submission?</P>
<P>Permit me here, my fellow citizens, to pay the tribute of praise to the patriotic soldier who con∣tinued on the banks of the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leware, with their illustrious commander, after the expiration of their
<PB N="20" REF="034482_0077_0FFDE81BDF0D5358"/>
enlistments, and with whom he was enabled to recross that river &amp; turn the tide of the war by his victories at Trenton and at Princeton. But why do I particularize? Scarcely a town in our coun∣try but where have been displayed acts which sound their panegyric—when the cause of free∣dom was finally triumphant, and the minions of despotism obliged to withdraw from its shores, which they had so long stained with the blood of its citizens, these patriotic warriors gave to the world an example of the love of country ever to be admired and imitated. Unsatisfied and unre∣quited for their long laborious toils and services, the moment their country ceased to call, they for∣sook the insignia of <HI>War</HI> for the mantle of <HI>Peace,</HI> and returned to the bosom of that country whose rights they had so nobly defended.</P>
<P>And here they have pursued the various occu∣pations of civil life with an industry which distin∣guishes them in society; and at this day are, al∣most unexceptionably, conspicuous examples of attachment to the <HI>Rights of Man</HI> and the cause of <HI>Liberty</HI> in general, in opposition to all arbitrary power—sentiments that were so strongly impres∣sed in the course of their illustrious service. The pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ise, the respect and affection due to distinguish∣ed
<PB N="21" REF="034482_0077_0FFDE81BDF0D5358"/>
merit, is the only compensation they can now receive. These will never be withheld while gratitude is an American virtue; and when time shall cease with them and us, let their monumenal inscription be "HE FOUGHT AND CON∣QUERED IN HIS COUNTRY's CAUSE." It will serve both for Epitaph and Elegy, and en∣dear their memory with posterity.</P>
<P>The brilliant exploits of the militia of our country ought never, on an occasion like this, to be passed over in silence. They have ever been considered as the grand defence of every land of freedom, and in the course of our struggle for in∣dependence, they proved themselves eminently worthy of the sacred charge. The scenes of Bunker's hill, of Bennington and the Sarratoga heights, will stand to the latest time, illustrious examples of their prowes and intripidity. But to enumerate all the glorious deeds of our warring yeomanry would require time far beyond my pre∣sent limits. Permit me only to add, that the mi∣litia of New-Jersey acquired lawrels which will ever be conspicuous in the volums of American history.</P>
<P>I will not lead you on this occasion to the tombs of our illustrious warriors who fell in their coun∣try's
<PB N="22" REF="034482_0078_0FFDE81E8BBDA550"/>
cause—it would touch the springs of grief in the heart of sensibility, and draw the sympathetic tear from many an eye. The renumeration of their names without the annexation of their shin∣ing virtues, would be too melancholy a detail— and to give to each his characteristic glory is the pleasing task of the historian. The memory of every son and daughter of liberty will embalm them as long as time and recollection shall exist.</P>
<P>And now permit me to close this address, my countrymen, in reminding you that the preserva∣tion of that liberty, which you have so gloriously obtained, depends on your own knowledge and the right instruction and education of your chil∣dren; for you and they can only be thereby en∣abled to guard the avenues to the temple of free∣dom, from the first approaches of tyranny, and to detect both oppression and anarchy, which are equal evils in all their variety of shapes—guard with anxious care your present free and glorious Constitution, and afford at all times your ready exertions to support it in its purity against either its destroyer or corrupter; for by either its des∣truction or corruption you loose your all; <HI>in vain you fought—in vain you conquered.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LIBERTY TREE—1775.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN a chariot of light, from the regions of day,</L>
<L>The goddess of liberty came;</L>
<L>Ten thousand celestials directed the way,</L>
<L>And hither conducted the dame.</L>
<L>A fair budding branch from the gardens above,</L>
<L>Where millions with millions agree,</L>
<L>She brought in her hand, as a pledge of her love,</L>
<L>And the plant she nam'd <HI>liberty tree.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The celestial exotic stuck deep in the ground,</L>
<L>Like a native it flourish'd and bore;</L>
<L>The fame of its fruit drew the nations around,</L>
<L>To seek out this peaceable shore.</L>
<L>Unmindful of names or distinctions they came,</L>
<L>For <HI>Freemen</HI> like brothers agree;</L>
<L>With one spirit endu'd, they one friendship pur∣su'd,</L>
<L>And their temple was <HI>liberty tree.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Beneath this fair tree, like the patriarchs of old,</L>
<L>Their bread in contentment they ate,</L>
<L>Unvex'd with the troubles of silver and gold,</L>
<L>The cares of the grand and the great.</L>
