<HEAD>ADVANTAGES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN BROWN was servant in the family of a respectable Merchant in this city. He had lived there for several years; and from his regular honesty, so∣briety and diligence, possessed the confi∣dence and affection of his master. While in that family, he married a fellow-ser∣vant, a young woman whose name was Mary Coates, and they lived for more than seven years very happily together. They had one child living, a fine little boy about six years old, whom they main∣tained at a school, kept some miles from town by Mary's father. This was though better than putting him to school in Lon∣don, as he was under an affectionate rela∣tion, and less exposed to the company of wicked children. John and his wife go leave from time to time to visit their child and were always able to take him one little article or other of clothes, as we as a small present to the grandfather.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="037131_0003_100C9196786F20D8"/>
Thus comfortable were John and Ma∣ry, and had John been religious like his wife, they would have had a very fair prospect of continuing so. He, like ma∣ny others, thought Religion rather an unnecessary thing for a man who made it a rule to be sober, and honest, and dili∣gent, and kind. Besides the other very important considerations against which <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shut his heart, he did not reflect that without religion his good conduct to his family and his master stood on no solid foundation.</P>
<P>One unfortunate day as he was going on a message, he received a hand-bill from a man standing at the door of a Lot∣tery Office. This hand-bill set forth ma∣ny wonders, and invited all who had a mind to be rich in a hurry, to seize the lucky hour of adventuring in the wheel of fortune; shewing them how many thou∣sand pounds they would be sure <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> for one guinea! Casting his eye over the advertisement, the thought struck him that he would <HI>try his fortune.</HI> Why may not I get a prize as well <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> said he to himself; and if I get the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thousand pound prize, or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="4" REF="037131_0004_100C91980A473DA8"/>
the ten thousands, I shall be as great a man as my master? It was a woeful mo∣ment for poor John, when this imagina∣tion fastened on his mind. Full of the notion of getting rich, John returned home, and appeared all that day unusu∣ally thoughtful. At night, as he was not used to conceal any thing from his wife, he told her his intention. 'Molly, (said he) we have just got our wages, and the drawing begins to-morrow; suppose <HI>we try our fortune</HI> in the Lottery. Not with my consent, she replied; I think we are rich enough as we are, and ought to be thankful to God that we want for nothing. John was obliged to acknowledge this; but observed that it would do them no <HI>harm</HI> to have something <HI>more.</HI> Indeed, but it might, (said Molly) for you know, John, God is the best judge of what is good for us, and it is his Providence that has placed us in our present situation. If he saw that more riches would do us good, I believe he would send them to us in an honest way: but I am sure you and I know some people, that are not at all the better for their riches, no nor the hap∣pier either.' But what harm (said he) can there be in <HI>trying our fortune?'</HI> 'I
<PB N="5" REF="037131_0005_100C919A42DB1828"/>
know there is harm, (replied his wife, who was well read in the bible,) I know there is harm in covetousness; for the word of God says, <HI>Be content with such things as you have; and he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent; and the love of money is the root of all evil.</HI> For my part I am very well satisfied as I am, and when I think of the poverty and distress our blessed Saviour submitted to, I find great reason to praise him for the abundance we enjoy. Besides trying our fortune, as you call it, is no better than tempting God, who is the real giver of what men say fortune gives them. Our blessed Saviour refused, you know, when he fasted in the wilderness to act in an extraordinary manner, in order that God might give him riches and other things, for he said that would be tempting God: and what would going into the Lottery be but tempting God, for would it not be taking an extraordinary course in or∣der to try whether God would make us rich? But, my dear, what has put this matter into your head? John pulled the hand-bill out of his pocket, and explain∣ed to her as well as he could, all the won∣derful advantages which it promised.
<PB N="6" REF="037131_0006_100C919CF3F6BC00"/>
This did not satisfy his wife: and she wisely observed, that if there were so much to be got by these same tickets, it was strange that the people who sold them would not rather keep them for themselves. 'But do you not see there before your eyes, said John, the number of prizes that were sold last year at the <HI>Lion's Of∣fice?'</HI> 'Well, replied his wife, I wish they had published the number of <HI>blanks</HI> that were sold too.'</P>
<P>'But ah! John, there are a great ma∣ny lies in print: and to tell you the truth, I fancy it is all a gambling trick, and that the people who sell these tickets are little better than <HI>knaves,</HI> and the folks who buy them no better than <HI>fools.</HI> And you know, my dear, our little boy wants clothes, and this is the time that you generally take something to his old grand∣father. Sure, said she, while a tear stole down her cheek, you will not forget our dear Johnny.' But all her arguments were in vain; and he concluded the con∣versation rather peevishly, with declar∣ing. 'It is a folly to talk; I am resolv∣ed to try.' His wife wiped her eyes, and
<PB N="7" REF="037131_0007_100C919E85974258"/>
only said with a sigh, 'I am sorry for it.' He had never grieved her so much before.</P>
<P>That night John slept little; he was anxiously debating which of the various modes of adventuring was to be prefer∣red, and laying a thousand plans as to what he would do upon getting his ex∣pected riches. Early next day he got from his wife some money which he had given her to keep; and making a false excuse of business for leaving home, he hurried to the Lottery Office. There, looking at various tickets, and shares, and policies that were shewn, out of se∣veral numbers that he was informed were peculiarly <HI>lucky</HI> he selected one ticket. But as he was returning with it home, beginning to think that it was foolish to spend <HI>all his luck</HI> (as he called it) upon <HI>one</HI> number, he went back, and changed the ticket for six policies, which he got at a guinea a piece. 'Well (said he) as he put them in his pocket, they can never be all drawn-blanks.' Upon hearing that the ticket he had taken first was drawn the next day a prize of ten pounds, he thanked his <HI>stars</HI> that he had parted with it, as he should by no means be satisfied
<PB N="8" REF="037131_0008_100C91A1579C3850"/>
with gaining so little as two or three pounds by his venture.</P>
<P>John now became hourly anxious to know whether his numbers were drawn or not, and often neglected his business to enquire after them. He appeared thought∣ful and gloomy in the house; and some∣times gave his master a very short an∣swer, if he found fault with him. All in the family wondered at the entire change in his conduct;—his poor wife alone guessed at the cause. To her he now obser∣ved an entire silence upon the subject, as he had found her so decided against his venturing in the Lottery. But one day, when he had come home after hearing that two of his numbers were drawn blanks, and a third drawn a 10l. prize, (from which he of course got nothing,) she affectionately seized his hand, and with a flood of tears asked him why he had been for some days so peevish to her. 'My dearest husband, said she, it was never so with you before since our mar∣riage. If I have done any thing lately to offend you, I am ready to go on my knees to ask your pardon. Only do not break my heart by behaving as if you did
<PB N="9" REF="037131_0009_100C91A2F6049530"/>
not love me.'—'Pugh! Woman! (repli∣ed he sullenly)—don't make a fool of yourself.' 'Alas! (said she) is it a fol∣ly to be grieved at seeing you unhappy, or at the fear of having displeased you? But, ah! I fear the Lottery is the cause. I thought no good would come of it.' Molly perceived that his mind was in a state of vexation; and therefore did not press the subject then. But in the even∣ing she took an opportunity of tenderly entreating him to rest satisfied under any loss he had already suffered, without venturing farther; observing that he might thus learn a lesson which might be useful to him all his life; but that in the course in which he was he could not ex∣pect the blessing of God.—'And surely (added she) we shall be richer with that blessing and a few worldly comforts, than if we had all the world without it. Ah! John! there is indeed, as our Saviour says, but <HI>one thing needful.</HI> What mat∣ter whether we be rich or poor in this life, if we get to heaven at last? And truly God is so gracious a master, that his service brings peace and comfort with it even here: while on the contrary, those who set their hearts upon the world, do
<PB N="10" REF="037131_0010_100C91A634FE73B8"/>
not even find in it <HI>now</HI> the enjoyment which they seek; not to say, <HI>that if they gained the whole world, and lost their own souls,</HI> they would make a fool's bargain.'</P>
<P>Though John seldom read his Bible; yet he knew enough of it to be satisfied, that what she said was all very true; and she spoke with so much gentleness and affection that he could not take it amiss. He then promised her, that he would not throw away any more money in the Lot∣tery. She thanked God for her husband's resolution, and prayed that he might have grace to keep it. But wishing to with∣draw him from the scene of temptation, she proposed that he should ask leave of his master to visit their little child in the country. To this John consented, and easily obtained permission. It was with joy that Molly saw him set off next morn∣ing; but she little thought how soon her joy was to be succeeded by the bitterest sorrow. Her husbands heart was still hankering after his three numbers that remained in the wheel; and as the draw∣ing was pretty far advanced, he became every day more anxious and impatient.
<PB N="11" REF="037131_0011_100C91A7C8226D90"/>
He therefore resolved, instead of leaving town that day to spend it in the place where the drawing was going on. 'Who knows (said he to himself) but I may re∣turn to my wife this evening, with news that will make her own, that I did right in <HI>trying my fortune?'</HI> As he was on his way, he came to a famous office for insu∣ring numbers. John had often heard of <HI>insuring,</HI> but did not well know what it meant. Having however become a gam∣bler, he had an itch after <HI>trying his for∣tune</HI> in this way also. He therefore step∣ped into the office. 'I want (said he) to <HI>insure;</HI> but I don't know how to do it, nor indeed what it is.' 'Sir, (replied a well-drest man behind the counter) you are perfectly right. Insuring, Sir, is the only way to make money; and I will ex∣plain it all to you in a moment with the greatest pleasure.' John thanked his ho∣nour. 'Only give me (continued the o∣ther) the trifling premium of 6s. 10d. on any number you chuse, and if it be drawn either blank or prize in the course of the day you may call on me for Five Gui∣neas, and they will be paid you down upon the nail: hard guineas, Sir, hard and heavy. There is no office in this
<PB N="12" REF="037131_0012_100C91AAE48A04E8"/>
city that pays <HI>hits</HI> with so much honour as this. I had demands on me yesterday to the <HI>tune</HI> of 300l. and all were answer∣ed as soon as called for.' 'Well, (said John, who had not the wit to ask himself how the gentleman came to be so finely drest while he was losing so much money,) 'Well, and if the number be not drawn to-day at all, will you give me <HI>any thing?'</HI> 'O! Sir (replied the office-keeper) as to that, it is very unlikely. And really, it is not any interest I have in this, that makes me carry on the business; but a pleasure I have in offering better terms to my customers than any other office in London can boast of. And I would re∣commend it to you, as a friend, to insure at least ten or twelve numbers; that you be <HI>certain</HI> of winning. Take my word for it that is playing a sure game. Five Guineas, Sir, for 6s. 10d.! think of that.' The cunning office-keeper was so friendly and so obliging, that he easily prevailed on John to insure his three remaining numbers, besides several others, for that day. The poor man now thought it was hardly possible but that he must put some∣thing in his pocket. 'Whether the num∣bers (thought he) be drawn blanks or
<PB N="13" REF="037131_0013_100C91AD6DC2FB28"/>
prizes I get money; and if any of my three remaining policies turn up the 10,000l. prize, my fortune is made. It is yet in the wheel; and why may not I get it as well as another?' Full of this thought he hastened to watch the drawing while the office-keeper, as he went out, put the money in his pocket▪ and his tongue in his cheek, sneering at John's simplicity. John found at the place of drawing a number of drunken, ragged, blaspheming wretches. Their appearance and language at first shocked him; espe∣cially when he heard one and another cursing themselves for their folly in <HI>trying their fortune.</HI> But he now became all attention to the numbers that were de∣clared as soon as drawn; and his heart beat, whenever any one near his own was mentioned. In a little time, wearied with expectation, he began to imitate the example of others around him in laying wagers whether the number next drawn would be a blank or prize: and a decent looking man, who sat near, soon engaged with him in the business. The stranger, who knew better than John how to reck∣on chances, let him win a few shillings at first; but soon stript him of every far∣thing
<PB N="14" REF="037131_0014_100C91AF5D0CC480"/>
in his pocket. He was ashamed to confess that he had no more money, and the spirit of Gaming having now com∣pletely seized him, he hurried back to his master's house; and when his wife with surprize asked the cause of his sud∣den appearance, he pretended that he recollected on his way to their little boy some article which he had forgotten to take with him, and returned for it. He had not been used to <HI>lying;</HI> but having now commenced Gamester, he was going on step by step in wickedness. His poor wife perceived confusion and distress in his countenance; but believing what he said she made no farther enquiries, and only urged him to hasten his departure. She knew not that he took away with him a silver goblet and some spoons, which belonged to his master, and were under his care. These he immediately pawned, expecting that he should be able to release them before they would be missed. But sooner or later the devil always leaves his servants in the lurch: and so now he ser∣ved John.</P>
<P>With the money thus wickedly obtain∣ed he returned to the place of drawing
<PB N="15" REF="037131_0015_100C91B0E98B1DD8"/>
and arrived just time enough to lose it all▪ except a few shillings, before that day's drawing ended. Stung with vexation he came out into the street, cursing himself▪ and cursing others; and hurried along with some of his new companions to a public house. Public houses in his better days he had not been accustomed to fre∣quent. The liquor which he drank to <HI>drown care</HI> soon inflamed him to madness, and prepared for every thing that was bad. At one moment he thought of put∣ting an end to his own life, which had now become a burthen. Alas! had he followed the advice of his wife, or taken the word of GOD for his direction, how different would his situation have been! He knew not what to do. Return home he durst not: for he dreaded the thought of its being discovered that he had em∣bezzled his masters property. And to continue adventuring in the Lottery he had not the means. His mind was torn by various passions; it was a kind of Hell. But he was not truly penitent for his of∣fence; and did not pray to GOD for HIS gracious assistance: He therefore went on from bad to worse. His companions, more hardened in wickedness, laughed
<PB N="16" REF="037131_0016_100C91B279E2F458"/>
at his distress. He heard them with sur∣prise boast of the various cheats by which they supported themselves in their villa∣ny. But one of them took him aside into an inner room, and after they had called for more drink, told him plainly that he was a blockhead for being so much cast down by his losses; and that if he had only spirit enough, he might soon have as full a purse as ever. First swearing John to secrecy, he proposed that they should join together in a scheme which he had formed of committing a highway robbery that night. He mentioned a gentleman who was to return to town with a sum of money late in the evening by the Edge∣ware road; and assured John of getting a rich and easy booty. 'I lived in this gen∣tleman's family, said he, till a year ago; and a good service it was, for I had high wages and little work. But truly because I got drunk now and then, he parted with me and would not give me a character for sobriety, and I have been out of place ever since. But I am now my own mas∣ter; get money in an easier way, and drink as much as I please. A short life and a merry one, say I.' John was at first startled by the proposal; but after a
<PB N="17" REF="037131_0017_100C91B4E5351DB0"/>
moment's pause, observed with an oath, that <HI>he was in for it,</HI> and would not <HI>flinch.</HI> He was soon furnished with pistols by his companion, whose name was Smith; but when John took them, he expressed a hope that there might be no blood shed.</P>
<P>They sallied forth together, and lay concealed in a field near the road. A few days before John would have started with horror at the thought of being engaged in such a business: but when a man once gives way to what is evil, it is impossible to say where he will stop. The expected gentleman soon arrived; when rushing out, one of them seized the reins of his horse, while the other held a pistol to his breast, and with horrid oaths demanded his money. The gentleman, a Mr. Stew∣art, immediately snapped a pistol, which missed fire; and both the robbers dischar∣ging theirs, shot him dead on the spot. They had hardly time to rifle his pockets, when the neighbourhood was alarmed by the report of the pistols, and they were obliged to fly with all speed: but being favoured by the darkness of the night, they got clear off from their pursuers. After hastily sharing the spoils, and again
<PB N="18" REF="037131_0018_100C91B7869420B8"/>
swearing each other to secrecy, (as if oaths could bind villains,) they separated, for greater safety, and spent the remain∣der of the night at different houses of ill∣fame. But John's mind was now racked with remorse, and guilt was visible in his countenance. When day-light came, he endeavoured to compose himself to sleep; but in vain: the image of the person whom he had murdered haunted his imaginati∣on; and the torment of his conscience was almost more grievous than the pu∣nishment of the law which he dreaded. He had intended to employ his ill-gotten gain in <HI>trying his fortune</HI> farther in the Lottery, that cursed Lottery which had brought on all his misery; and had he done so, it is most probable that he would have been stripped as he was the day be∣fore. But all courage now failed him; and being afraid to appear in public, he slunk to his master's house at an early hour, and indulged the hope that as there was no witness of the horrid deed but himself and his companion, it would re∣main undiscovered for ever. He little remembered that GOD'S eye saw it; and that his Providence seldom (if ever) suf∣fers
<PB N="19" REF="037131_0019_100C91B913FFB870"/>
such wickedness to pass unpunished, even in this world.</P>
<P>His wife, though surprised at her hus∣bands speedy arrival, welcomed him with affection; and tenderly enquired after the welfare of their little boy. 'Ask no questions, Woman!' was his only reply. She was struck dumb with astonishment! but when she perceived a pistol under his coat, she clasped her hands in agony of horror; and not daring to ask a question, she sunk on the chair, and trembled like aspen leaf.</P>
<P>The robbery and murder now became the talk of the town; and John's master asked him whether he had heard any thing of the circumstances. He had only pow∣er to answer, 'No, Sir,' with a faultering voice. But how did his heart sink with∣in him, when he heard soon after that his companion (who had been a notorious offender) was taken up on suspicion of having committed the fact! yet he still thought there was no evidence that could prove the charge. Every rap at the door startled him. Every person that looked at him seemed to know his guilt. He
<PB N="20" REF="037131_0020_100C91BAA0C196F0"/>
sometimes thought of flying; but again determined to stand his ground, lest his absconding should occasion an immediate pursuit. Some days passed thus, and he began to flatter himself that all was safe. But as he lay one night sleepless and tos∣sing, his afflicted wife weeping by his side and afraid to enquire into the cause of his situation, a noise was heard at the door; and on its opening, the officers of jus∣tice entered to apprehend him. Smith had <HI>turned king's evidence</HI> to secure his own life: so little confidence can villains place in each other, John was now drag∣ged pale and trembling to Newgate, while poor Molly clung to him shrieking, and fainted away as soon as they entered the prison. When she came to herself, she felt that her heart was broken. She ne∣ver raised her head again. Yet she at∣tended him closely for a while; but pi∣ned, and soon sunk beneath the weight of her affliction. With her dying breath she prayed that her husband might be brought to repentance, and might yet obtain mercy at the hand of God. When brought to the bar, he cast a look of indig∣nation and reproach at his accomplice, who now appeared as evidence against
<PB N="21" REF="037131_0021_100C91BD8B511840"/>
him; which the other returned with a malicious sneer. His guilt was clearly proved: all circumstances confirmed it. When the Judge was going to pass sen∣tence, he cried out for a <HI>long day.</HI> Oh that a <HI>long day</HI> were granted to every man sentenced to suffer death; even to a mur∣derer! But in the case of murderers the law determines otherwise, and it was not the business of the Judge to give his opi∣nion of the law, but to pass its sentence. He addressed John as follows; "Unhappy man! you seem to have forgotten that in the murder of Mr. Stewart you allowed him no time. In a moment, and without provocation, you sent a worthy person who had never harmed you into Eternity. The laws of GOD and man demand your forfeited life. You must prepare for al∣most immediate execution. Your fate will, I trust, be an awful warning to ma∣ny. You might have lived long, useful, and respected, had you been content with what you acquired by honest industry; had not the desire of hasty and unrighteous gain taken possession of your heart. I mourn over the existence of such a public nui∣sance as appears to have been the first oc∣casion of your fall: and I cannot help de∣claring,
<PB N="22" REF="037131_0022_100C91BFE5B6E840"/>
that I have never sat upon this bench after the drawing of the Lottery, but I had reason to think it had proved the ruin of many of the unhappy culprits who appeared before me. I would earnestly exhort the crowds that hear me to abhor the thoughts of adventuring in it, and to fly from it as from a plague, which will destroy domestic happiness and inward peace, and bring upon them every kind of distress. Prisoner! I mourn that o∣thers should be involved in your calami∣ty, who have not been partners in your guilt: that an amiable and virtuous wo∣woman, as I am informed, should have died broken-hearted on your account; [here the prisoner groaned]—and that your infant child must be left an orphan in the world, that will be too forward to reproach him with his father's crime. But your doom in <HI>this</HI> world is sealed. Your state in the <HI>next</HI> now calls loudly for all your attention, and I most earnest∣ly exhort you to call upon Him for repen∣tance and pardon, who came into the world to save even the chief of sinners. May you have grace therefore to employ the little time remaining for you in this world, in imploring His mercy! As to
<PB N="23" REF="037131_0023_100C91C1713BCE38"/>
the wretch before me, who has been an accomplice with you in your crime, and upon whose evidence you have been con∣victed, he will not escape justice. I must remand him back to Newgate, that he may stand his trial upon the charge of two other robberies. It is a painful but ne∣cessary part of my office to which I now proceed. It is with a bleeding heart I pronounce your sentence, which is, that you be <HI>hanged, drawn and quartered</HI> on Saturday next the 15th instant, and may the LORD have mercy on your soul!"</P>
<P>He was executed according to his sen∣tence; and would to GOD that this histo∣ry might prove a warning to all, against <HI>trying their fortune</HI> in the LOTTERY!</P>

<HEAD>THE HAPPY WATERMAN.</HEAD>
<P>A Gentleman and lady walking on the banks of the river Thames, spi∣ed a small ferry-boat with a neatly dressed waterman rowing towards them; on his nearer approach, they read on the stern of his boat, these words, THE HAPPY WATERMAN.—Without taking any no∣tice of it, they determined to enter into conversation with him, and inquiring into his situation in life, they found that he had a wife and five children, and support∣ed also an old father and mother-in-law by his own labour. The gentleman and lady were upon this still more surprised at the title he had given himself, and said, "my friend, if this is your situation, how is it that you call yourself the happy wa∣terman?" I can easily explain this to your satisfaction," answered the young man, "if you will give me leave;" and they desiring him to proceed, he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as follows: "I have observed that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> greatest blessings in life are often looked up∣on as the greatest distresses, and are in fact

made such by means of imprudent con∣duct. My father and mother died a few years ago, and left a large family; my father was a waterman, and I was his as∣sistant in the management of a ferry-boat, by which he supported his family; on his death it was necessary (in order to pay his just debts) to sell our boat, I parted from it—even with tears—but the distress that I felt spurred me on to industry, for I said, I will use every kind of diligence to purchase my boat back again. I went to the person who had bought it, and told him my design; he had given five <HI>guineas</HI> for it, but told me, as I was once the owner, that I should have it whenever I could raise five <HI>pounds.</HI> "Shall the boat be mine again! said I; my heart bounded at the thought!</P>
<P>"I was at this time married to a good young woman, and we lived in a neigh∣bouring cottage; she was young, healthy, and industrious, and so was I, and we lo∣ved one another.—What might we not undertake? My father used to say to me, "Always do what is right; labour dili∣gently, and spend your money carefully; and GOD will bless your store." We
<PB N="27" REF="037131_0027_100C91C8F0567748"/>
treasured up these rules, and determined to try the truth of them. My wife had long chiefly suported two aged parents: I loved them as my own—and the desire of contributing to their support, was an additional spur to my endeavours to re∣purchase the boat. I entered myself as a day-labourer, in the garden of our squire: and my wife was occasionally to perform some services at the house, and employed herself in needle work, spin∣ning or knitting at home; not a moment in the day was suffered to pass unemploy∣ed—we spared for ourselves and furnish∣ed all the comforts we could to the poor about us—and every week we dropped a little overplus into a fairing-box, to buy the BOAT. If any accident or charity brought us an additional shilling, we did not enlarge our expence, but kept it for the BOAT! The more care we took the more comfortable we felt, for we were the nearer the possession of our little BOAT. Our labour was lightened, by looking for∣ward to the attainment of our wishes. Our family indeed increased, but with it our friends increased also, for the clean∣liness and frugality which furnished our cottage, and the content and cheerfulness
<PB N="28" REF="037131_0028_100C91CB01F622E0"/>
that appeared in it, drew the notice of our rich neighbours; of my master and mistress particularly, whose rule was not to encourage the idle. They did not approve of giving money to the poor; but in cold winters, or dear times, allowed us to buy things at a cheaper rate: this was <HI>money to us,</HI> for when we counted our little cash for the week's marketing, all that was saved to us by our tickets to purchase things at reduced prices, went into our "little box." If my children got a pen∣ny at school for a reward, to buy ginger∣bread, they brought it home, they said, to help buy the BOAT—for they would have no gingerbread till dady has got his boat again! Thus from time to time our little store insensibly increased, till one pound only was wanting of the five, when the following accident happened. Coming home one evening from my work, I saw in my road a small pocket book: on opening it, I found a bank note of ten pounds, which plainly enough belong∣ed to my master, for his name was upon it, and I had also seen him passing that way in the evening; it being too late however to return to the house, I went on my way. When I told my family of
<PB N="29" REF="037131_0029_100C91CDB674B838"/>
the accident, the little ones were thrown into a transport of joy. My dears, said I, what is the matter? "Oh! daddy, the BOAT! the BOAT! we may have two or three boats!" I checked them by my looks, and asked them if they recollected whose money that was? they said, "your's, as you found it." I reminded them that I was not the real owner, and bid them think how they would all feel, supposing a stranger was to take our box of money, if I should happen to drop it on the day I went to buy back the boat! This thought had the effect on their young minds that I desired: they were silent, and pale with the representation of such a disaster! and I begged it might be a lesson to them ne∣ver to forget the golden rule of "doing, as they would others to do by them;" for by attention to this certain guide, no one would ever do wrong to another. I also took this opportunity, to explain to them, that the possession of the BOAT by dishonest means would never answer, since we could not expect the blessing of GOD upon <HI>bad deeds.</HI></P>
<P>To go on with my story—the next morning I put the pocket-book into my
<PB N="30" REF="037131_0030_100C91CFA59DF1A0"/>
bosom, and went to my work, intending as soon as the family rose to give it to my master, but what were my feelings, when, on searching in my bosom, it was no where to be found! I hasted back, along the road I came, looking diligently all the way, but, in vain; there were no traces of any such thing.—I would not return into my cottage because I wished to save my family the pain I felt, and in the hope of still recovering the book, I went to my work, following another path which I recollected I had also gone by; on my return to the garden gate, I was accosted by the gardener, who, in a threatening tone told me, I was suspect∣ed; that our master had lost a pocket∣book, describing what I had found, and I being the only man absent from the gar∣den at the hour of work, the rest of the men also denying that they had any such thing, there was every reason to conclude that I must have got it. Before I could answer, my distressed countenance con∣firmed the suspicion! and another servant coming up, said I was detected, for that a person had been sent to my house, and that my wife and family had owned it all, and had described the pocket-book. I
<PB N="31" REF="037131_0031_100C91D1A36464F0"/>
told them the real fact, but it seemed to every one unlikely to be true; every cir∣cumstance was against me, and, my heart trembles to look back upon it, I was ar∣rested, and hurried away to prison! I protested my innocence, but I did not wonder that I gained no credit! Great grief now oppressed my heart! my poor wife, my dear children, and my grey∣headed parents, were all at once plunged into want and misery, instead of the ease and happiness which we were expecting; for we were just arriving at the height of our earthly wishes! I had, however, one consolation left, that knew <HI>I was inno∣cent,</HI> and I trusted that by "persevering in honesty," all might come right at last! My resolution was, as I had certainly been the cause, tho' without any design, of the second loss of the property, that I would offer, alas! the whole of our little store, to make it good as far as in my pow∣er; and I sent for my wife to give her this sad commission, but she informed me that even this sacrafice could be of no a∣vail, for, said she, my master has been at the cottage, when I told Him freely how you had found the note, but unfortu∣nately had lost it again; and I added, that
<PB N="32" REF="037131_0032_100C831E914C0E08"/>
I was sure both I and my husband would make the best return in our power, after which I produced our little fairing-box and begged him to accept the contents, which had been so long raising, as all we had to offer: But, Sir, said the waterman, conceive my agony, when she added, that my master angrily refused, saying, that our Being in possession of all that money was of itself the clearest proof of my guilt: for it was impossible, with my large fami∣ly, and no greater opportunities than my neighbours, that I could come honestly by such a sum; therefore he was deter∣mined to keep me in goal till I should pay the whole. My unhappiness was very great; however my mind by degrees be∣gan to be more easy, for I grew confident that I should not trust in <HI>God</HI> and my own innocence in vain:—and so it happened, one of my fellow-labourers proved to be the person who had picked up the note after I had dropt it, having come a few minutes after me along the same road to work, and hearing that the suspicion had fallen altogether upon me, he was tempt∣ed to turn the accident to his own advan∣tage, and conceal the property; which having kept in his own box for a few
<PB N="33" REF="037131_0033_100C91D642FA38E8"/>
weeks, till he thought no suspicion would rest upon him, he went and offered the note for change, and being then suspected, my master had him taken up, and I was released.</P>
<P>This second change from so much mi∣sery to happiness was almost too much for us! My master sent for me, and with many expressions of concern for what had passed, made me give him an account of the means by which I had collected the little fund, that fixed his suspicions so strongly upon me. I accordingly re∣lated the history of it as I have now done; and when I came to that part, where I checked my children for their inconsider∣ate joy, on my finding the note, he rose, with much kindness in his looks, and putting the bank bill into my hand, he said, "Take it!—the bank note shall be theirs. It is the best and only return I can make you, as well as a just reward of your honesty: and it will be a substan∣tial proof to your children of the good∣ness of your instructions, for they will thus early see, and feel the benefit of ho∣nesty and virtue!"</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="037131_0034_100C91D831184C60"/>
This kind and worthy gentleman inte∣rested himself much in the purchase of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> boat, which, in less than a week I was in full possession of. The remainder of my master's bounty, and the additional advantage of the ferry, has placed me in comfortable circumstances, which I hum∣bly trust in God will continue to us as long as we continue our labour, and ho∣nest diligence; and I can say from my long experience that the fruit of our own industry is always sweetest. I have now also the pleasure of being able to help others, for when a rich passenger takes my ferry; as my story is well known in the neighbourhood, he often gives me more than my fare, which enables me to let the next poor person go over for half price.</P>
<P>The lady and gentleman were extreme∣ly pleased with the Watermans story, and willingly joined in calling him the HAP∣PY WATERMAN. They passed over in his ferry-boat for the sake of making him an handsome present. And from this time, becoming acquainted with his fami∣ly, they did them every service in their power, giving books and schooling to the
<PB N="35" REF="037131_0035_100C91D9C1515F30"/>
little ones, and every comfort to the old father and mother-in-law as long as they survived. They were very desirous of knowing what became of the unfortunate fellow-labourer, who had so dreadfully gone aside from the principles of honesty, and they learnt that he was, after a short imprisonment, set at liberty by his master at the earnest entreaty of the honest Wa∣terman, as he said it was partly thro' his carelessness in losing the note, that the temptation had fallen in his fellow-labour∣er's way; he had moreover a very large family his master also was so good as to consider that he was a man who had not been blessed with a good education in his youth, so that having little fear of God before his eyes, and having a great tempta∣tion in his way, he had been the more easily led to commit this very wicked ac∣tion, by which he would have enriched himself at the expence of an innocent man. I have a great pleasure in adding, that the thought of what he had done, to∣gether with the generosity of the water∣man, had so strong an effect upon this poor fellow, that he afterwards had it written up on his cottage door, DO AS YOU WOULD BE DONE UNTO. And he
<PB N="36" REF="037131_0036_100C91DB5A1AF008"/>
hath resolved to follow this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> himself in future, and also taught it to all his chil∣dren: indeed it became a rule well known over the whole parish, for every little child having been informed of this story, was told that he ought to consider before he did any action, whether he would like his brother, or sister, or school-fellow, to do the same by him; and if not that the action was wrong, and not to be done let the profit be ever so great. Surely then, those who have lived long, and seen much of life, and have had much religious instruction also, should never depart from this simple and certain rule. And it is the same to all ranks—it requires neither learning nor abilities to "do as you would be done unto," nor can any station how∣ever great, no nor any circumstances, however trying, excuse men from giving their constant attention to it.</P>
