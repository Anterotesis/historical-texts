<Q><P>THY country's happiness is trusted to thy care—O happy country, blest UNITED STATES!</P>
<BIBL>MR. WORTHY.</BIBL>
<P>My life is nothing but a scene of woe—How often have I wish'd the gordian knot of matrimony were again untied!—For MRS. JENSON—<HI>Vashti</HI> like, must be ador'd, or else—Fare∣well to all domestic ease—I'm almost weary of her—She must and shall submit.</P>
<BIBL>MR. JENSON.</BIBL>
<P>God knows I am, at heart, a friend to none on earth, except my own beloved self—I've sworn his ruin, ever since her father gave her to his rival arms—My plan succeeds—Yet what a wretch I am, to triumph thus, at the misfortunes of my fellow men!—'Tis truly devilish, I confess it is—Well, well, I'll think of it another time.</P>
<BIBL>MAJ. SHAPELY.</BIBL>
<P>I long to wear the shining crown of fame—And yet, I wish I could have liv'd contented here—I shall be ruin'd, after all.</P>
<BIBL>MR. LYNDALL.</BIBL>
<P>This is the consequence of being brib'd, to murder honest peo∣ple in their sleep!</P>
<BIBL>CAPTAIN.</BIBL>
<P>I gave my hand, though nature held my heart—His <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> never harmonize with mine—Good heav'ns! How complaisant the MAJOR is!—I wish I were his bride—It makes me curse my fate—I'm wrong'd, neglected and despis'd—O cruel husband! O unfeeling man!—He has debas'd himself, to ruin me—My cruel father too—But he is gone, and all are gone—I've not a friend on earth—Alas! I am undone—Detested wretch! Prove false himself, th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n lay that charge on me!—I'll be his death, or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> myself.</P>

<L>GOOD friends, who come to hear and see the play,</L>
<L>Our Author bids me just appear and say,</L>
<L>The characters which he unfolds to view,</L>
<L>Are not sublime, although he thinks them true.</L>
<L>He wakes no Grecian here from his tomb,</L>
<L>Or slumbering patriot of imperial Rome;</L>
<L>He calls no Gallic Prince or British lord,</L>
<L>To walk the stage, and wield the tragic sword▪</L>
<L>Employs no Washington to aid his plan,</L>
<L>Or faithless Arnold—that disgrace to man:—</L>
<L>But shows the miseries of a man and wife,</L>
<L>A simple circumstance of common life.</L>

<HEAD>ACT I.</HEAD>
<STAGE>SCENE, <HI>a garden.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE>Mrs. Jenson, <HI>alone.</HI></STAGE>
<L>ONCE more, my soul, releas'd from sleep,</L>
<L>And all the horrors of terrific dreams,</L>
<L>I rise before the Sun; and here alone,</L>
<L>Amidst this garden's solitary walks,</L>
<L>Await the earliest beam, that from the east,</L>
<L>May come, to usher in approaching day:</L>
<L>Thrice hapless day to me! For now the year,</L>
<L>Revolving thrice, has roll'd the seasons round;</L>
<L>Since, in obedience to my father's will,</L>
<L>I yielded to the matrimonial yoke.</L>
<L>At each return of this unhappy day,</L>
<L>The sun (methinks) should be o'erspread with clouds,</L>
<L>And sympathizing nature rob'd in black.</L>
<L>Little, ah! little did I then conceive</L>
<L>The ills that haunt a <HI>mercenary match.</HI></L>
<L>I envy now the homeless vagabond,</L>
<L>Who begs her daily bread from door to door;</L>
<L>For surely she is blest with sweet content:</L>
<L>While, in the harness of a nuptial vow,</L>
<L>I drag along the heavy lead of life,</L>
<L>Join'd with a partner, whom my soul detests.</L>
<L>Unthinking maid! Why did my tongue consent,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="018365_0007_0FA6A5FDB7BF02E8"/>To change my name, my fortune and my <HI>all?</HI></L>
<L>Against my own desire, I gave my hand,</L>
<L>(Oh! let oblivion blast the painful thought!)</L>
<L>I gave my <HI>hand,</HI> though nature held my <HI>heart.</HI></L>
<L>Thence I begin the aera of my woes.</L>
<L>Had I then known, what torments would ensue,</L>
<L>I should (unnatural thought) I should have dar'd</L>
<L>His most indignant wrath. Relentless fire,</L>
<L>What had I done, to forfeit thy regard?</L>
<L>How couldst thou trifle with thy daughter's life,</L>
<L>And bid me wed despair? Sure, 'twas unkind.</L>
<L>Yet, gracious heav'n, forgive the cruel deed!</L>
<L>And shall not <HI>I</HI>? Yes, O my father, now</L>
<L>No more my guide, since death hath clos'd thine eyes,</L>
<L>And laid thee mouldering in the silent grave;</L>
<L>Though, when alive, thy pretence was my dread,</L>
<L>Repose in peace: No more I fear thy rage.</L>
<L>I will not violate thy sacred dust,</L>
<L>Or call thy slumbering memory into mind:</L>
<L><HI>Adieu</HI> to all my pleasing dreams of bliss,</L>
<L>And hope, that sweetness life's insipid cup.</L>
<L>The gall of sorrow tinctures all my life,</L>
<L>And grief embitters ev'n the bitterest dregs.</L>
<L>My fate is fixt, beyond redress.
<STAGE>[Weeps.]</STAGE></L>
<STAGE>Betty <HI>enters.</HI></STAGE>
<L>What! Whence is this?</L>
<L>Why, Betty, dare you come, without command,</L>
<L>To interrupt my morning thoughts?</L>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<L>I come, through fear that thou art ill,</L>
<L>To walk abroad, at such an early hour.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>My, more than <HI>maid</HI>—my ever-constant <HI>friend,</HI></L>
<L>Such kind attention claims my gratitude.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thy looks and voice,</L>
<L>Thy bursting sighs and overflowing tears,</L>
<L>Confirm the tidings, that my fears foretold.</L>
<L>Art thou not faint? It seems to me, thou art.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. J.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, faint indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<L>I am afraid,</L>
<L>Those fits of faintness, which thou often hast,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="018365_0008_0FA6A5FE77715FE8"/>On sudden shocks, are coming on again.</L>
<L>Shall I not run, and fetch thy cordial drops?
<STAGE>[Going.]</STAGE></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>Stay, Betty, stay, 'twould be to no effect,</L>
<L>If all the Atlantic ocean were refin'd</L>
<L>To cordials, and administer'd to me;</L>
<L>It could not, for a moment, ease my pain.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<L>What shall we do? I fear the consequence,</L>
<L>For several days thou hast appear'd unwell.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'll tell you, honest Betty, once for all;</L>
<L>I'm sick at <HI>heart,</HI> though otherwise in health.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<L>How great must be that grief,</L>
<L>Which spreads this lowering cloud upon thy brow!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ah! great indeed—too great to be endur'd!</L>
<L>My sun of joy has long withdrawn from view;</L>
<L>While hope, which wanes and waxes, like the moon,</L>
<L>And never shines, but with a borrow'd light,</L>
<L>Reflected faintly from some distant good—</L>
<L>Ev'n glimmering hope is totally eclips'd,</L>
<L>And every star of comfort disappears.</L>
<L>In vain you'll strive, to chear my gloomy thoughts:</L>
<L>For still the darkest shades of midnight are</L>
<L>No more than twilight, to this night of <HI>woe.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<L>Pray, gentle lady, stifle these complaints!</L>
<L>Though melancholy overspreads thy soul,</L>
<L>And reigns in darkness there; yet day will rise,</L>
<L>More pleasing, for this antecedent gloom.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. J.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish it may; but can't believe it will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<L>It surely must. Come, wake to chearful thoughts,</L>
<L>And yield no more to leaden grief; for, see!</L>
<L>The sun peeps over yonder eastern hill,</L>
<L>And heaves his head majestic up to view.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>These eyes have been so long suffus'd with tears,</L>
<L>The sun affects my fight, as through a mist,</L>
<L>And gives but little pleasure to my sense.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thy tears have flow'd too long:</L>
<L>Come, condescend to brighten up those eyes.</L>
<L>Since nature all around thee smiles,</L>
<L>Why wilt thou not partake the spreading joy?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="018365_0009_0FA6A6009E0257B0"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>O that such thoughts could bury up my pains!</L>
<L>But all attempts, like these, though meant for good,</L>
<L>Can only stir the coals of discontent;</L>
<L>And serve, to heat again, with seven-fold rage,</L>
<L>The glowing passion, that enflames my breast.</L>
<L>'Tis true, <HI>all nature smiles,</HI> and thus proclaims</L>
<L>Her joy: Yet <HI>smiling</HI> thus, in <HI>joyful</HI> mood,</L>
<L>She only mocks at my extreme distress.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<L>Indulgent made in, wilt thou always live,</L>
<L>Among thy friends, thus pensive and forlorn?</L>
<L>I've scarcely seen a smile upon thy face,</L>
<L>Since the completion of thy bridal day.</L>
<L>I am a witness to thy discontent,</L>
<L>As once I shar'd in thy delightful scenes:</L>
<L>Thy virgin checks then wore a smiling blush;</L>
<L>Contentment sparkled from those jetty eyes,</L>
<L>And every word bespoke a mind at ease.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. J.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those days are past, and will no more return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet other days succeed, and why not other joys?</L>
<L>Does marriage always throw a damp on I so,</L>
<L>Or is this plague peculiar to thyself?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>I cannot tell:</L>
<L>Of <HI>this,</HI> however, I am well assured;</L>
<L>It is a source of wretchedness to <HI>me.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<L>Were not the thought too bold,</L>
<L>I would desire to know the cause of this.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>If you have not already guest it out.</L>
<L>'Twill give me pleasure to inform you now.</L>
<L>I love to tell the story of my woe,</L>
<L>To vent my sorrows, and unload my heart;</L>
<L>It seems to sooth my grief, when any one</L>
<L>Will listen to the undissembled tale.</L>
<L>Know then, my <HI>husband</HI> is this mighty cause;</L>
<L>And 'tis not in the compass of my pow'r,</L>
<L>To hide my hatred of the man.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thy father said,</L>
<L>Though thou dislik'dst his person at the first,</L>
<L>That time would pour the balm of love,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="018365_0010_0FA6A600B921EE48"/>Into thy mind, and heal the festering wound.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>He promis'd, as you say; but all in vain.</L>
<L>For three long, tedious years have roll'd away,</L>
<L>And yet I hate him still; yea (what is worse)</L>
<L>I hate him more and more, at every thought.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<L>How canst thou hate so excellent a man?</L>
<L>He certainly is kind.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. J.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he is kind enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>His person and complexion are not bad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. J.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't object to him, in that respect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<L>His fortune is above the reach of want,</L>
<L>Although beneath the aim of envy.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. J.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't complain of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<L>His reputation stands as fair,</L>
<L>As yonder cloudless sun, that chears the day.</L>
<L>All ranks of people venerate his name;</L>
<L>The public too of late have honour'd him,</L>
<L>With an appointment to the court of <HI>France,</HI></L>
<L>Which he is now preparing to attend—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>And will, I doubt not, faithfully discharge.</L>
<L>I own, I can't dislike his character:</L>
<L>But there is something in the whole of him,</L>
<L>Discordant with the wishes of my soul.</L>
<L>His passions never harmonize with mine.</L>
<L>Some secret jarr, I can't tell what, prevails,</L>
<L>To disconcert the music of our lives.</L>
<L>I could esteem him, as a worthy friend,</L>
<L>An honour'd father, or an uncle dear:</L>
<L>But, as the social partner of my life,</L>
<L>I can't approve of him.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<L>Softly, good madam, lest he overhear:</L>
<L>For he is coming in at yonder gate.</L>
<L>Shall I retire?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. J.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Betty <HI>retires, and</HI> Mr. Jenson <HI>enters.</HI></STAGE>

<L>What does my dear abroad,</L>
<L>So early in the day?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. J.</SPEAKER>
<P>I watch the progress of this pleasant morn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>Delightful prospect! How it fills the mind,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="018365_0011_0FA6A60179B0BCE0"/>With sentiments of joyful gratitude!</L>
<L>For every thing conspires, to give delight.</L>
<L>Dread winter lately bound the earth with ice,—</L>
<L>In howling tempests swept along our coasts,</L>
<L>Benumb'll the limbs, and chill'd the thoughts of men,</L>
<L>In short, froze up each genial source of joy:</L>
<L><HI>Now</HI> breathing spring, with milder gales succeeds,—</L>
<L>Dissolves the hoary frost,—spreads o'er the fields</L>
<L>A curious carpet (wrought in nature's loom)</L>
<L>Of chearing green, diversify'd with flowers;</L>
<L>And bids the year unfold her stores to man.</L>
<L><HI>Now</HI> night, which wraps one half the earth in gloom</L>
<L>Has roll'd her shadows over to the west.</L>
<L>Alternate day pursuing night around,</L>
<L>Comes laughing from the east, array'd in light,</L>
<L>Invites the flocks to play, the birds to sing,</L>
<L>And drowsy mortals to arise from sleep.</L>
<L><HI>Now</HI> pleasure greets the soul, through every sense.</L>
<L>Enjoy, my fair, the beauties of the <HI>spring,</HI></L>
<L>And all the fragrance of the lovely <HI>morn</HI>:</L>
<L>But I must hasten hence, at duty's call.</L>

<P>Why hence, so soon?</P>

<L>Does thy commission specify the time,</L>

<L>To him I may unbosom all my mind,</L>
<L>And freely reckon o'er my numerous pains:</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<L>No farther, Sir, than was within my power.</L>
<L>From motives of unfeigned love to thee,</L>
<L>I undertook indeed on thy behalf,</L>
<L>And urg'd thy suit to <HI>Mr. Worthy</HI>'s ear.</L>
<L>Yet, though there seem'd a prospect of success,</L>
<L>Our rival just obtain'd the prize.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>I wish I could have liv'd contented here,</L>
<L>And never entertain'd a thought of fame.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<L>Whence that desponding wish my friend?</L>
<L>Because thou hast been baffled once,</L>
<L>Wilt thou supinely throw aside thine arms,</L>
<L>And yield thyself a prisoner to despair?</L>
<L>I should disdain to have it known, that thou,</L>
<L>For whom I have so often banish'd sleep,</L>
<L>To tend the solitary lamp of care;</L>
<L>And spent whole days of hurry and fatigue;</L>
<L>That thou, dear Sir,—I blush to name the thought▪</L>
<L>That thou, alas! wert such a child.</L>

<L>'Tis downright madness to resist our fate.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis downright folly to submit to fear:</L>
<L>Be brave, I say. Let slaves and cowards drudge,</L>

<L>Why should I run a race, when time and strength</L>

<L>My own expereince gives sufficient proof</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou hast but just set out;</L>
<L>And starting always is a painful step,</L>
<L>Though afterwards there's nothing but delight.</L>
<L>Since thou canst boast of an aspiring soul,</L>
<L>I'm sure, a whole infinity of fame</L>
<L>Will animate thee to pursue the course.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lynd.</SPEAKER>
<L>Although the thought of glory is sublime,</L>
<L>My doubts and fears block up the way.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<L>Those obstacles are only in thyself.</L>
<L>Let generous courage once possess thy breast,</L>
<L>And they will vanish, like a morning dream:</L>
<L>For courage elevates the towering soul,</L>
<L>And builds a bridge o'er every obstacle</L>
<L>But fear. This bore great ALEXANDER's train,</L>
<L>Upon their march through <HI>Asia</HI>'s conquered realms,</L>
<L>To his imperial throne, amidst the shouts</L>
<L>Of victory and war. Upon the same,</L>
<L>The mighty CAESAR stood, and wav'd his flag</L>
<L>Of joy and triumph o'er the trembling world.</L>
<L>And this, e'en now, supports a WASHINGTON,</L>

<L>Can heap upon a single character.</L>
</SP>

<L>Wilt thou desert thy standard first thyself,</L>

<L>Ungrateful wretch! Go, muffle up in sloth,</L>
<L>And pine away, with indolent despair.</L>
<L>Thou fear'st "the toil and danger that attend."</L>
<L>These are design'd to season our delights;</L>
<L>They serve as sauce for milder happiness;</L>

<L>Say, is he not confirm'd?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<L>In some degree, but may be thence remov'd.</L>
<L>A single chance assign'd that place to him;</L>
<L>Another chance may turn him out again.</L>
<L>'Tis easy to discover some mistake</L>

<L>That will be glorious, if that can be done;</L>

<L>If you will favour me, in this attempt,</L>

<L>Thou know'st I always glory in thy good;</L>
<L>Nor do I cover any recompence:</L>

<L>I do no more, dear Sir, than I should wish</L>

<SPEAKER>Mr. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>The preparation for my voyage succeeds,</L>
<L>According to my wish. Did nothing else</L>
<L>Retard my progress, or perplex my mind,</L>
<L>I should be soon in readiness to sail.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<L>What is there else?</L>
<L>Does any obstacle impede thy way?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>The circumstances of my family</L>
<L>Affect my soul, with great uneasiness,</L>
<L>And quite embarrass my designs.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou art afraid, to leave them here with me:</L>
<L>I know, I have not merited the trust.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>No; that is not the ground of my concern.</L>
<L>If <HI>Mrs. Jenson</HI> would declare her choice,</L>
<L>Either to go with me, or tarry here,</L>
<L>I might prepare accordingly for her:</L>
<L>But it disturbs and disconcerts my schemes,</L>
<L>To be in doubt, respecting that affair.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<L>Hast thou then offer'd her a choice;</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. J.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have; and beg'd of her to choose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure, that was fair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. J.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet she utterly declines.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<L>Perhaps she has not yet had time enough,</L>
<L>To form a prudent choice.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>She asks no longer time;</L>
<L>But seems determin'd not to choose at all.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<L>What reason does she urge,</L>
<L>To justify, or rather to excuse,</L>
<L>Her unaccountable behaviour?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>Instead of justifying it,</L>
<L>She is forever muttering out complaints,</L>
<L>Of her unhappy life.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<P>She can't blame <HI>thee,</HI> for that which <HI>heav'n</HI> ordains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>She does; however strange it may appear.</L>
<L>And calls me the destroyer of her bliss.</L>

<SPEAKER>Mr. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh I'm the most unhappy man on earth.</L>
<L>My life is nothing but a scene of woe.</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<L>No man of sense and sentiment:</L>
<L>For nature is abus'd, when ladies scold.</L>
<L>Let men, upon occasion, fret and rage;</L>

<L>No more, dear Sir. no more!</L>
<L>I know the force of female exellence;</L>

<L>I wonder other people have not heard</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>They have;</L>
<L>I am become a proverb in the streets.</L>
<L>I heard a man observing to his friend,</L>
<L>"'Tis base for one of <HI>Mr. Jenson</HI>'s rank,</L>
<L>"To be so tamely govern'd by his wife."</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<P>My sorrow! has it come to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>To this, it has.</L>
<L>His words were sharper than a two-edg'd sword;</L>
<L>I feel them still; they pierc'd my foolish heart,</L>
<L>And left a sting behind.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<L>So I believe. I wish that were the end:</L>

<L>Will be as sure, as death.</L>
</SP>

<L>How rule my house?</L>
<L>I've us'd uncommon lenity with her,</L>
<L>In all our intercourse.</L>

<L>That seems to be reason of her scorn;</L>
<L>Thou wast in fault. 'Twas best to be severe.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. J.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hop'd to win her by indulgent means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<L>The consequence too sadly proves,</L>
<L>That such indulgence only tempted her,</L>
<L>To run a greater length of wilfulness.</L>
<L>Thy kind civility encreas'd her pride,</L>
<L>As cultivation helps a weed to grow.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>I wish, I had begun to use the curb,</L>

<P>It is not yet too late.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. J.</SPEAKER>
<P>How may her stubborn soul be sway'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<L>How? There's no difficulty, in the case:</L>
<L>For woman is as weak as proud.</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="018365_0026_0FA6A60E3A3B0738"/>Pride has its origin in impotence.</L>
<L>Apply a little opposition to her will;</L>

<SPEAKER>Mr. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>Dost thou imagine she may thus be rul'd,</L>
<L>By gentle exercise of government?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<L>Perhaps her stubbornness has grown so strong,</L>
<L>As to require a little longer time,</L>
<L>Or harder trial of authority;</L>
<L>However she will gladly yield.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. J.</SPEAKER>
<L>I am almost persuaded to attempt</L>
<L>Her subjugation:—But I hate the task.</L>

<L>I have perform'd a grand discovery,</L>
<L>Which makes my heart exult for joy</L>
<L>Within the progress of a few more months,</L>

<L>A prince? How grand the sound of prince?</L>
<L>Then you shall be the next in dignity.</L>

<L>I must be very brief.</L>
<L>Among the incidents of our discourse,</L>
<L>I fortunately found a secret way,</L>
<L>That led me to the very cabinet</L>

<L>Aye, that is well observ'd.</L>
<L>The secret must be kept, and well thou know'st,</L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="018365_0033_0FA6A614F7570DA0"/>A secret is a dangerous, slippery thing:</L>

<L>Away the secret glides, as quick as light,</L>

<L>Poor bleeding, murder'd friend, repose in death.</L>

<L>Are nothing now, alas! but ghastly clods,</L>
<L>Death sets in triumph on his wither'd face.</L>
<L>That tongue, which ably plead his country's cause,</L>
<L>Is stiff? And all his limbs refuse to move.</L>
<L>How will his friends and country mourn his death,</L>

<L>Seiz'd by a murderer's hand, and plung'd in death!</L>

<L>Thou child of darkness!</L>
<L>Why didst thou perpetrate the hellish deed?</L>

<SPEAKER>Shap.</SPEAKER>
<L>To satiate my desires.</L>
<L>The love of happiness has been my bane;</L>
<L>For this, through peaceful calms and storms of strife,</L>
<L>I've travel'd round the globe of human life;</L>
<L>At length, my race of villany is run,</L>
<L>My guilt compleated and my journey done.</L>
<L>Farewell, sweet hope! expected bliss, farewell!</L>
<L>Come, dire despair, thou blackest imp of hell,</L>
<L>With all the plagues, that form thy cursed train,</L>
<L>Remorse and envy, jealousy and pain;</L>
<L>Come, from the realms of misery below,</L>
<L>And take me down to everlasting woe.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>TO generous souls, whose sentiments are right▪</L>
<L>The exercise of candour gives delight▪</L>
<L>But other persons, of a different make,</L>
<L>Rejoice to find and censure a mistake.</L>
<L>As every audience is composed of these,</L>
<L>This evening's play must consequently please:</L>
<L>For here are faults of almost every name,</L>
<L>That candour can forgive, or censure blome.</L>
<L>Ye critics, then, and patrons of the stage.</L>
<L>The just resiners of the present age,</L>
<L>Who fill, adorn and dignify these seats,</L>
<L>Pray, grant this savour, which your friend entreats;</L>
<L>Be good enough our foibles to excuse,</L>
<L>Indulge the boldness of a youthfull muse,</L>
<L>And thus declare to each unbiass'd mind,</L>
<L>That skilful judges are most freely kind.</L>
