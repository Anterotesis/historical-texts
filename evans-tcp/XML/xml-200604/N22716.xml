<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>A Simplicity in diet, whether it be con∣sidered with reference to the happiness of individuals or the prosperity of a nation, is of more consequence than we are apt to imagine. In recomending so important an object to the rational part of mankind, I wish it were in my power to do it in such a man∣ner as would be likely to gain their attention. I am sensible that it is one of those subjects in which example has infinitely more power than the most convincing arguments or the highest charms of poetry. Goldsmith's DE∣SERTED VILLAGE, though possessing these two advantages in a greater degree than any other work of the kind, has not prevented villages in England from being deserted. The apparent interest of the rich individuals, who
<PB REF="030023_0003_0FE3C6A8F9DC1E58"/>
form the taste as well as the laws in that coun∣try, has been against him; and with that in∣terest it has been vain to contend.</P>
<P>The vicious habits which in this little piece I endeavour to combat, seem to me not so dif∣ficult to cure. No class of people has any in∣terest in supporting them; unless it be the interest which certain families may feel in vying with each other in sumptuous enter∣tainments. There may indeed be some in∣stances of depraved appetites, which no argu∣ments will conquer; but these must be rare. There are very few persons but what would always prefer a plain dish for themselves, and would prefer it likewise for their guests, if there were no risk of reputation in the case. This difficulty can only be removed by exam∣ple; and the example should proceed from those whose situation enables them to take the lead in forming the manners of a nation. Persons of this description in America, I should hope, are neither above nor below
<PB N="v" REF="030023_0004_0FE3C6AE447B2010"/>
the influence of truth and reason, when con∣veyed in language suited to the subject.</P>
<P>Whether the manner I have chosen to ad∣dress my argments to them be such as to pro∣mise any success is what I cannot decide▪ but I certainly had hopes of doing some good, or I should not have taken the pains of putting so many rhymes together—The example of domestic virtues has doubtless a great effect. I only wish to rank SIMPLICITY of DIET a∣mong the virtues. In that case I should hope it will be cherished and more esteemed by o∣thers than it is at present.</P>

<HEAD>The Hasty-Pudding,</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="canto">
<HEAD>CANTO I.</HEAD>
<L>YE Alps audacious, thro' the heav'ns that rise,</L>
<L>To cramp the day and hide me from the skies;</L>
<L>Ye Gallic flags, that o'er their heights unfurl'd,</L>
<L>Bear death to kings, and freedom to the world,</L>
<L>I sing not you. A softer theme I chuse,</L>
<L>A virgin theme, unconscious of the Muse,</L>
<L>But fruitful, rich, well suited to inspire</L>
<L>The purest frenzy of poetic fire.</L>
<L>Despise it not, ye Bards to terror steel'd,</L>
<L>Who hurl your thunders round the epic field;</L>
<L>Nor ye who strain your midnight throats to sing</L>
<L>Joys that the vineyard and the still-house bring;</L>
<L>Or on some distant fair your notes employ,</L>
<L>And speak of raptures that you ne'er enjoy.</L>
<L>I sing the sweets I know, the charms I feel,</L>
<L>My morning incense, and my evening meal,</L>
<L>The sweets of Hasty Pudding. Come, dear bowl,</L>
<L>Glide o'er my plate, and inspire my soul.</L>
<L>The milk beside thee, smoaking from the kine,</L>
<L>Its substance mingled, married in with thine,</L>
<L>Shall cool and temper thy superior heat,</L>
<L>And save the pains of blowing while I eat.</L>
<L>Oh! could the smooth, the emblematic song</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="030023_0006_0FE3C6B6E8C170F0"/>Flow like the genial juicies o'er my tongue,</L>
<L>Could those mild morsels in my numbers chime,</L>
<L>And, as they roll in substance, roll in rhyme,</L>
<L>No more thy aukward unpoetic name</L>
<L>Should shun the Muse, or prejudice thy fame;</L>
<L>But rising grateful to th' accustom'd ear,</L>
<L>All Bards should catch it, and all realms revere!</L>
<L>Assist me first with pious toil to trace</L>
<L>Thro' wrecks of time thy lineage and thy race;</L>
<L>Declare what lovely squaw, in days of yore,</L>
<L>(Ere great Columbus sought thy native shore)</L>
<L>First gave thee to the world; her works of fame</L>
<L>Have liv'd indeed, but liv'd without a name.</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tawny Ceres, goddess of her days,</L>
<L>First learn'd with stones to crack the well-dry'd maize,</L>
<L>Thro' the rough seive to shake the golden show'r,</L>
<L>In boiling water stir the yellow flour:</L>
<L>The yellow flour, bestrew'd and stir'd with yeast,</L>
<L>Swells at the flood and thickens to a paste,</L>
<L>Then puffs and wallops▪ rises to the brim,</L>
<L>Drinks the dry knobs that on the suface swim;</L>

<L>And the whole mass its true consistence takes.</L>

<L>To her, to them, I'd consecrate my lays,</L>
<L>And blow her pudding with the breath of praise.</L>
<L>If 'twas Oella, whom I sang before,</L>
<L>I here ascribe her one great virtue more.</L>
<L>Not thro' the rich Peruvian realms alone</L>
<L>The fame of Sol's sweet daughter should be known,</L>
<L>But o'er the world's wide climes should live secure,</L>
<L>Far as his rays extend, as long as they endure.</L>
<L>Dear hasty-pudding, what unpromis'd joy</L>
<L>Expands my heart, to meet thee in Savoy!</L>
<L>Doom'd o'er the world thro' devious paths to roam,</L>
<L>Each clime my country, and each house my home,</L>
<L>My soul is sooth'd, my cares have found an end,</L>
<L>greet my long-lost, unforgotten friend.</L>
<L>For thee thro' Paris, that corrupted town,</L>
<L>How long in vain I wandered up and down,</L>
<L>Where shameless Bacchus, with his drenching hoard,</L>
<L>Cold from his cave usurps the morning board.</L>
<L>London is lest in smoak and steep'd in tea;</L>
<L>No Yankey there can lisp the name of thee;</L>

<L>For climes oblique, that fear the sun's full rays,</L>
<L>Chill'd in their fogs, exclude the generous maize;</L>
<L>A grain whose rich luxuriant growth requires</L>
<L>Short gentle showers, and bright etherial fires.</L>
<L>But here, tho' distant from our native shore,</L>
<L>With mutual glee we meet and laugh once more.</L>
<L>The same! I know thee by that yellow face,</L>
<L>That strong complection of true Indian race,</L>
<L>Which time can never change, nor soil impair,</L>
<L>Nor Alpine snows, nor Turkey's morbid air;</L>
<L>For endless years, thro' every mild domain,</L>
<L>Where grows the maize, there thou art sure to reign</L>
<L>But man, more fickle, the bold licence claims,</L>
<L>In different realms to give thee different names.</L>
<L>Thee the soft nations round thi warm Levant</L>
<L><HI>Polanta</HI> call, the French of course <HI>Polante;</HI></L>
<L>Ev'n in thy native regions, how I blush</L>

<L>On Hudson's banks, while men of Belgie spawn</L>

<L>And while they argu'd in thy just defence</L>
<L>With logic clear, they thus explain'd the sense:—</L>

<L>"No carving to be done, no knife to grate</L>
<L>"The tender ear, and wound the stony plate:</L>

<L>"And taught with art the yielding mass to dip,</L>
<L>"By frequent journeys to the bowl well stor'd,</L>
<L>"Performs the hasty honors of the board."</L>
<L>Such is thy name, significant and clear,</L>
<L>A name, a sound to every Yankey dear,</L>
<L>But most to me, whose heart and palate chaste</L>
<L>Preserve my pure hereditary taste.</L>
<L>There are who strive to stamp with disrepute</L>
<L>The lucious food, because it feeds the brute;</L>
<L>In troops of high-strain'd wit, while gaudy prigs</L>

<L><PB N="11" REF="030023_0010_0FE3C6C907E531C8"/>With sovereign scorn I treat the vulgar jest,</L>

<L>The milk nutritious; am I then a calf?</L>
<L>Or can the genius of the noisy swine,</L>
<L>Tho' nurs'd on pudding, thence lay claim to mine?</L>
<L>Sure the sweet song, I fashion to thy praise,</L>
<L>Runs more melodious than the notes they raise,</L>
<L>My song resounding in its grateful glee,</L>
<L>No merit claims; I praise myself in thee.</L>
<L>My father lov'd thee thro' his length of days;</L>
<L>For thee his fields were shaded o'er with maize;</L>
<L>From thee what health, what vigor he possest,</L>
<L>Ten sturdy freemen from his loins attest;</L>
<L>Thy constellation rul'd my natal morn,</L>
<L>And all my bones were made of Indian corn.</L>
<L>Delicious grain! whatever form it take,</L>
<L>To rost or boil, to smother or to bake,</L>
<L>In every dish 'tis welcome still to me,</L>
<L>But most, my Hasty-Pudding, most in thee.</L>
<L>Let the green Succatash with thee contend,</L>

<L>Except in dear New-England, where the last</L>

<L>The pudding of the bag, whose quivering breast,</L>

<L>The Charlotte brown, within whose crusty sides</L>
<L>A belly soft the pulpy apple hides;</L>
<L>The yellow bread, whose face like amber glows,</L>

<HEAD>CANTO II.</HEAD>
<L>TO mix the food by vicious rules of art,</L>
<L>To kill the stomach and to sink the heart,</L>
<L>To make mankind to social virtue sour,</L>
<L>Cram o'er each dish, and be what they devour;</L>
<L>For this the kitchen Muse first fram'd her book,</L>
<L>Commanding sweat to stream from every cook;</L>
<L>Children no more their antic gambols tri'd,</L>
<L>And friends to physic wonder'd why they died.</L>
<L>Not so the Yankey—his abundant feast,</L>
<L>With simples furnish'd, and with plainness drest,</L>
<L>A numerous offspring gathers round the board,</L>
<L>And cheers alike the servant and the lord;</L>
<L>Whose well-bought hunger prompts the joyous taste,</L>
<L>And health attends them from the short repast.</L>
<L>While the full pail rewards the milk-maid's toil,</L>
<L>The mother sees the morning cauldron boil;</L>
<L>To stir the pudding next demands their care,</L>
<L>To spread the table and the bowls prepare;</L>
<L>To feed the children, as their portions cool,</L>
<L>And comb their heads, and send them off to school.</L>
<L>Yet may the simplest dish some rules impart,</L>
<L>For nature scorns not all the aids of art.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="030023_0013_0FE3C6D3AEE8BA60"/>Ev'n Hasty-Pudding, purest of all food,</L>
<L>May still be bad, indifferent, or good;</L>
<L>As sage experience the short process guides,</L>
<L>Or want of skill, or want of care presides.</L>
<L>Whoe'er would form it on the surest plan,</L>
<L>To rear the child and long sustain the man;</L>
<L>To shield the morals while it mends the size</L>
<L>And all the powers of every food supplies,</L>
<L>Attend the lessons that the Muse shall bring.</L>
<L>Suspend your spoons, and listen while I sing.</L>
<L>But since, O man! thy life and health demand</L>
<L>Not food alone, but labour from thy hand,</L>
<L>First in the field, beneath the sun's strong rays,</L>
<L>Ask of thy mother earth the needful maize;</L>
<L>She loves the race that courts her yielding soil,</L>
<L>And gives her bounties to the sons of toil.</L>
<L>When now the ox, obedient to thy call,</L>
<L>Repays the loan that fill'd the winter stall,</L>
<L>Pursue his traces o'er the furrow'd plain,</L>
<L>And plant in measur'd hills the golden grain.</L>
<L>But when the tender germe begins to shoot,</L>
<L>And the green spire declares the sprouting root,</L>
<L>Then guard your nursling from each greedy foe,</L>
<L>Th' insidious worm, the all devouring crow.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="030023_0014_0FE3C6D8F990B1C0"/>A little ashes, sprinkled round the spire,</L>
<L>Soon steep'd in rain, will bid the worm retire;</L>
<L>The feather'd robber with his hungry maw</L>
<L>Swift flies the field before your man of straw,</L>
<L>A frightful image, such as school-boys bring</L>
<L>When met to burn the Pope, or hang the King.</L>
<L>Thrice in the season, through each verdant row</L>
<L>Wield the strong plow-share and the faithful hoe;</L>
<L>The faithful hoe, a double task that takes,</L>
<L>To till the summer corn, and roast the winter cakes</L>
<L>Slow springs the blade, while check'd by chilling rains,</L>
<L>Ere yet the sun the seat of Cancer gains;</L>
<L>But when his fiercest fire emblaze the land,</L>
<L>Then start the juices, then the roots expand;</L>
<L>Then, like a column of Corinthian mould,</L>

<L>The bushy branches all the ridges fill;</L>
<L>Entwine their arms, and kiss from hill to hill.</L>
<L>Here cease to vex them, all your cares are done;</L>
<L>Leave the last labours to the parent sun;</L>
<L>Beneath his genial smiles the well-drest field,</L>
<L>When autumn calls, a plenteous crop shall yield.</L>
<L>Now the strong foliage bears the standards high,</L>

<L>High as a hop-field waves the silent grove,</L>
<L>A safe retreat for little thefts of love,</L>
<L>When the pledg'd roasting-ears invite the maid,</L>
<L>To meet her swain beneath the new-form'd shade</L>
<L>His generous hand unloads the cumbrous hill,</L>
<L>And the green spoils her ready basket fill;</L>
<L>Small compensation for the two-fold bliss,</L>
<L>The promis'd wedding and the present kiss.</L>
<L>Slight depredations these; but now the moon</L>
<L>Calls from his hallow tree the sly raccoon;</L>
<L>And while by night he bears his prize away,</L>
<L>The bolder squirrel labors thro' the day,</L>
<L>Both thieves alike, but provident of time,</L>
<L>A virtue rare, that almost hides their crime.</L>
<L>Then let them steal the little stores they can,</L>
<L>And fill their gran'ries from the toils of man;</L>
<L>We've one advantage where they take no part,—</L>
<L>With all their wiles they ne'er have found the art</L>

<L>Then drop with care along the silver lake</L>
<L>Your flakes of pudding; these at first will hide</L>
<L>Their little bulk beneath the swelling tide;</L>
<L>But when their growing mass no more can sink,</L>
<L>When the soft island looms above the brink,</L>
<L>Then check your hand; you've got the portion due,</L>
<L>So taught our sires, and what they taught is true.</L>
<L>There is a choice in spoons. Tho' small appear</L>
<L>The nice distinction, yet to me 'tis clear.</L>
<L>The deep bowl'd Gallic spoon contriv'd to scoop</L>
<L>In ample draughts the thin diluted soup,</L>
<L>Performs not well in those substantial things,</L>
<L>Whose mass adhesive to the metal clings;</L>
<L>Where the strong labial muscles must embrace.</L>
<L>The gentle curve, and sweep the hollow space</L>
<L>With ease to enter and discharge the freight,</L>
<L>A bowl less concave but still more dilate,</L>
<L>Becomes the pudding best. The shape, the size,</L>
<L>A secret rest unknown to vulgar eyes.</L>
<L>Experienc'd feeders can alone impart</L>
<L>A rule so much above the lore of art.</L>
<L>These tuneful lips, that thousand spoons have tried,</L>
<L>With just precision could the point decide,</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="030023_0021_0FE3C6F8EA1E6CC8"/>Tho' not in song; the muse but poorly shines</L>
<L>In cones, and cubes, and geometric lines.</L>
<L>Yet the true form, as near as she can tell,</L>
<L>Is that small section of a goose-egg-shell,</L>
<L>Which in two equal portions shall divide</L>
<L>The distance from the centre to the side.</L>
<L>Fear not to slaver; 'tis no deadly sin.</L>
<L>Like the free Frenchman, from your joyous chin</L>
<L>Suspend the ready napkin, or, like me,</L>
<L>Poise with one hand your bowl upon your knee;</L>
<L>Just in the zenith your wise head project,</L>
<L>Your full spoon, rising in a line direct,</L>
<L>Bold as a bucket, heeds no drops that fall,</L>
<L>The wide mouth'd bowl will surely catch them all.</L>
