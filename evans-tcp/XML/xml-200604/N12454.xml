<HEAD>THE PROSPECT OF PEACE.</HEAD>
<L>THE closing scenes of Tyrants' fruitless rage,</L>
<L>The opening prospects of a golden age,</L>
<L>The dread events that crown th' important year,</L>
<L>Wake the glad song, and claim th' attentive ear.</L>
<L>Long has Columbia rung with dire alarms,</L>
<L>While Freedom call'd her injur'd sons to arms;</L>
<L>While various fortune fir'd th' embattled field,</L>
<L>Conquest delay'd, and victory stood conceal'd;</L>
<L>While closing legions mark'd their dreadful way,</L>
<L>And Millions trembled for the dubious day.</L>
<L>In this grand conflict heaven's Eternal Sire,</L>
<L>At whose dread frown the sons of guilt expire,</L>
<L>Bade vengeance rise, with sacred fury driven,</L>
<L>On those who war with Innocence and Heaven.</L>
<L>Behold, where late the trembling squadrons fled,</L>
<L>Hosts bow'd in chains, and hapless numbers bled,</L>
<L>In different fields our numerous heroes rouse,</L>
<L>To crop the wreath from Britain's impious brows▪</L>
<L>Age following age shall these events relate</L>
<L>'Till Time's old empire yield to destin'd Fate;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="015729_0003_0F99DE18A4ADBD70"/>Historic truth our guardian chiefs proclaim,</L>
<L>Their worth▪ their actions, and their deathless fame;</L>
<L>Admiring crouds their life-touch'd forms behold</L>
<L>In breathing canvass, or in sculptur'd gold,</L>
<L>And hail the Leader of the favorite throng,</L>
<L>The rapt'rous theme of some heroic song.</L>
<L>And soon, emerging from the orient skies,</L>
<L>The blisful morn in glorious pomp shall rise,</L>
<L>Wafting fair Peace from Europe's fated coast;</L>
<L>Where wand'ring long, in mazy factions lost,</L>
<L>From realm to realm, by rage and discord driven,</L>
<L>She seem'd resolv'd to reascend her heaven.</L>
<L>This LEWIS view'd, and reach'd a friendly hand,</L>
<L>Pointing her flight to this far-distant land;</L>
<L>Bade her extend her empire o'er the West,</L>
<L>And Europe's balance tremble on her crest!</L>
<L>Now, see the Goddess mounting on the day,</L>
<L>To these fair climes direct her circling way,</L>
<L>Willing to seek, once more, an earthly throne,</L>
<L>To cheer the globe, and emulate the sun.</L>
<L>With placid look she eyes the blissful shore,</L>
<L>Bids the loud-thundering cannon cease to roar;</L>
<L>Bids British navies from these ports be tost,</L>
<L>And hostile keels no more insult the coast;</L>
<L>Bids private feuds her sacred vengeance feel,</L>
<L>And bow submissive to the public weal;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="015729_0004_0F99DE1D251A13D0"/>Bids long, calm years adorn the happy clime,</L>
<L>And roll down blessings to remotest time.</L>
<L>Hail! heaven-born Peace, fair Nurse of Virtue hail!</L>
<L>Here, fix thy sceptre and exalt thy scale;</L>
<L>Hence, thro' the earth extend thy late domain,</L>
<L>'Till Heaven's own splendor shall absorb thy reign!</L>
<L>What scenes arise! what glories we behold!</L>
<L>See a broad realm its various charms unfold;</L>
<L>See crouds of patriots bless the happy land,</L>
<L>A godlike senate and a warlike band;</L>
<L>One friendly Genius fires the numerous whole,</L>
<L>From glowing Georgia to the frozen pole.</L>
<L>Along these shores, amid these flowery vales,</L>
<L>The woodland shout the joyous ear assails;</L>
<L>Industrious crouds in different labors toil,</L>
<L>Those ply the arts, and these improve the soil.</L>
<L>Here the fond merchant counts his rising gain,</L>
<L>There strides the rustic o'er the furrow'd plain,</L>
<L>Here walks the statesman, pensive and serene,</L>
<L>And there the school boys gambol round the green.</L>
<L>See ripening harvests gild the smiling plains,</L>
<L>Kind Nature's bounty and the pride of swains;</L>
<L>Luxuriant vines their curling tendrils shoot,</L>
<L>And bow their heads to drop the clustering fruit;</L>
<L>In the gay fields, with rich profusion strow'd,</L>
<L>The orchard bends beneath its yellow load,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="015729_0005_0F99DE1ED4A245B8"/>The lofty boughs their annual burden pour,</L>
<L>And juicy harvests swell th' autumnal store.</L>
<L>These are the blessings of impartial Heaven,</L>
<L>To each fond heart in just proportion given.</L>
<L>No grasping lord shall grind the neighbouring poor,</L>
<L>Starve numerous vassals to increase his store;</L>
<L>No cringing slave shall at his presence bend,</L>
<L>Shrink at his frown, and at his nod attend;</L>
<L>Afric's unhappy children, now no more</L>
<L>Shall feel the cruel chains they felt before,</L>
<L>But every State in this just mean agree,</L>
<L>To bless mankind, and set th' oppressed free.</L>
<L>Then, rapt in transport, each exulting slave</L>
<L>Shall taste that Boon which God and nature gave,</L>
<L>And, fir'd with virtue, join the common cause,</L>
<L>Protect our freedom and enjoy our laws.</L>
<L>At this calm period, see, in pleasing view,</L>
<L>Art vies with Art, and Nature smiles anew:</L>
<L>On the long, winding strand that meets the tide,</L>
<L>Unnumber'd cities lift their spiry pride;</L>
<L>Gay, flowery walks salute th' inraptur'd eyes,</L>
<L>Tall, beauteous domes in dazzling prospect rise;</L>
<L>There thronging navies stretch their wanton sails,</L>
<L>Tempt the broad main and catch the driving gales;</L>
<L>There commerce swells from each remotest shore,</L>
<L>And wafts in plenty to the smiling store,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="015729_0006_0F99DE200B665D90"/>To these throng'd seats the country wide resorts,</L>
<L>And rolls her treasures to the op'ning ports;</L>
<L>While, far remote, gay health and pleasure flow,</L>
<L>And calm retirement cheers the laboring brow.</L>
<L>No din of arms the peaceful patriot hears,</L>
<L>No parting sigh the tender matron fears,</L>
<L>No field of fame invites the youth to rove,</L>
<L>Nor virgins know a harsher sound than love.</L>
<L>Fair Science then her laurel'd beauty rears,</L>
<L>And soars with Genius to the radiant stars.</L>
<L>Her glimmering dawn from Gothic darkness rose,</L>
<L>And nations saw her shadowy veil disclose;</L>
<L>She cheer'd fair Europe with her rising smiles,</L>
<L>Beam'd a bright morning o'er the British isles,</L>
<L>Now soaring reaches her meridian height,</L>
<L>And blest Columbia hails the dazzling light!</L>
<L>Here, rapt in tho't, the philosophic soul</L>
<L>Shall look thro' Nature's parts and grasp the whole.</L>
<L>See Genius kindling at a FRANKLIN'S fame,</L>
<L>See unborn sages catch th' electric flame,</L>
<L>Bid hovering clouds the threatening blast expire,</L>
<L>Curb the fierce stream and hold th' imprison'd fire!</L>
<L>See the pleas'd youth, with anxious study, rove,</L>
<L>In orbs excentric thro' the realms above,</L>
<L>No more perplex'd, while RITTENHOUSE appears</L>
<L>To grace the museum with the rolling spheres.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="015729_0007_0F99DE20D7020B90"/>See that young Genius, that inventive soul,</L>
<L>Whose laws the jarring elements control;</L>
<L>Who guides the vengeance of mechanic power,</L>
<L>To blast the watery world &amp; guard the peaceful shore.</L>
<L>And where's the rising Sage, the unknown name,</L>
<L>That new advent'rer in the lists of fame,</L>
<L>To find the cause, in secret nature bound,</L>
<L>The unknown cause, and various charms of sound?</L>
<L>What subtil medium leads the devious way;</L>
<L>Why different tensions different sounds convey;</L>
<L>Why harsh, rough tones in grating discord roll,</L>
<L>Or mingling concert charms th' enraptur'd soul.</L>
<L>And tell the cause why sluggish vapors rise,</L>
<L>And wave, exalted, thro' the genial skies;</L>
<L>What strange contrivance nature forms to bear</L>
<L>The ponderous burden thro' the lighter air.</L>
<L>These last Displays the curious mind engage,</L>
<L>And fire the genius of the rising age;</L>
<L>While moral tho'ts the pleas'd attention claim,</L>
<L>Swell the warm soul, and wake the virtuous flame;</L>
<L>While Metaphysics soar a boundless height,</L>
<L>And launch with EDWARDS to the realms of light.</L>
<L>See the blest Muses hail their roseate bowers,</L>
<L>Their mansions blooming with poetic flowers;</L>
<L>See listening Seraphs join the epic throng,</L>
<L>And unborn JOSHUAS rise in future song.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="015729_0008_0F99DE21723B15C8"/>Satire attends at Virtue's wakening call,</L>
<L>And Pride and Coquetry and Dulness fall.</L>
<L>Unnumber'd bards shall string the heavenly lyre,</L>
<L>To those blest strains which heavenly themes inspire;</L>
<L>Sing the rich Grace on mortal Man bestow'd,</L>
<L>The Virgin's Offspring and the <HI>filial God</HI>;</L>
<L>What love descends from heaven when JESUS dies!</L>
<L>What shouts attend him rising thro' the skies!</L>
<L>See Science now in lovelier charms appear,</L>
<L>Grac'd with new garlands from the blooming Fair.</L>
<L>See laurel'd nymphs in polish'd pages shine,</L>
<L>And Sapphic sweetness glow in every line.</L>
<L>No more the rougher Muse shall dare disgrace</L>
<L>The radiant charms that deck the blushing face;</L>
<L>But rising Beauties scorn the tinsel show,</L>
<L>The powder'd coxcomb and the flaunting beau;</L>
<L>While humble Merit, void of flattering wiles,</L>
<L>Claims the soft glance, and wakes th'enlivening smiles.</L>
<L>The opening lustre of an angel-mind,</L>
<L>Beauty's bright charms with sense superior join'd,</L>
<L>Bid Virtue shine, bid Truth and Goodness rise,</L>
<L>Melt from the voice, and sparkle from the eyes;</L>
<L>While the pleas'd Muse the gentle bosom warms,</L>
<L>The first in genius, as the first in charms.</L>
<L>Thus age and youth a smiling aspect wear,</L>
<L>Aw'd into virtue by the leading Fair;</L>

<L>Here the pure Church, descending from her God▪</L>
<L>Shall fix on earth her long and last abode;</L>
<L>Zion arise, in radiant splendors dress'd,</L>
<L>By Saints admir'd, by Infidels confess'd;</L>
<L>Her opening courts, in dazzling glory, blaze,</L>
<L>Her walls salvation, and her portals praise.</L>
<L>From each far corner of th' extended earth,</L>
<L>Her gathering sons shall claim their promis'd birth.</L>
<L>Thro' the drear wastes, beneath the setting day,</L>
<L>Where prowling natives haunt the wood for prey,</L>
<L>The swarthy Millions lift their wondring eyes,</L>
<L>And smile to see the Gospel morning rise:</L>
<L>Those who, thro' time, in savage darkness lay,</L>
<L>Wake to new light, and hail the glorious day!</L>
<L>In those dark regions, those uncultur'd wilds,</L>
<L>Fresh blooms the rose, the peaceful lilly smiles.</L>
<L>On the tall cliffs unnumber'd <HI>Carmels</HI> rise,</L>
<L>And in each vale some beauteous <HI>Sharon</HI> lies.</L>
<L>From this fair Mouth th'excinded stone shall roll,</L>
<L>Reach the far East and spread from pole to pole;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="015729_0010_0F99DE22E81EEB78"/>From one small Stock shall countless nations rise,</L>

<L>Earth's blood-stain'd empires, with their Guide the Sun,</L>
<L>From orient climes their gradual progress run;</L>

<L>From calm Vesperia, thro' th' etherial way,</L>
<L>Back sweep the shades before th' effulgent day;</L>
<L>Thro' the broad East, the brightening splendor driven,</L>

<L>Rise in the West and streak its golden way:</L>
<L><HI>That</HI> signal spoke a Savior's humble birth,</L>
