<P>THe Governour and Magistrates being assembled in Council, and in some measure sensible of the many tokens of the Lords displeasure against the cutting short the Fruits of the Earth for sundry years past, and otherwise bringing us low more then formerly; together with the many provoking Evils that do abound among us, to the great dishonour of God, and our Profession of his holy Name, and that notwithstanding all means used for to reclaim the same, which being in conjunction with sundry other things that are among us, threatning yet more displeasure against us, if the compassions of our tender hearted and long-suffering God do not timely prevent: Do therefore commend to all the Inhabitants of this Colony the Twenty fifth day of this instant to be kept a Publick Day of Hu∣miliation, and spent in Fasting and Prayer to the Lord for pardon of whatever have been, or is provoking to his holy eyes, and that he will be pleased to give unto us, from the greatest to the least, truely to Repent of all our sins, and to reform the same; and that those uncomfortable Breaches made in several Societies may be again repaired, and we may obtain his favourable Pre∣sence with us this following year, and his blessing upon our pre∣sent Seed-time, that so it may appear that the Lords anger is turned away from us, and that he is yet in our <HI>Zion,</HI> ruling in the midst of us, uniting the hearts of his poor people to do all his pleasure, and nothing else. Also the present low Estate of the Churches of Christ in <HI>Europe,</HI> and especially in our dear Native Country, is to be humbly presented before the Lord.</P>
