<HEAD>At A COUNCIL, Held at Charlestown, June the 20th, 1676.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The holy God having by a long and Continued Series of his Afflictive dispensations in &amp; by the present Warr with the Heathen Natives of this Land, written and brought to pass bitter things against his own Covenant people in this wilderness, yet so that we evidently discern that in the midst of his judge∣ments he hath remembred mercy, having remembred his Foot∣stool in the day of his sore displeasure against us for our sins, with many singular Intimations of his Fatherly Compassion, and regard: reserving many of our Towns from Desolation Threatned, and attempted by the Enemy, and giving us espe∣cially of late with our Confederates many signal Advantages against them, without such Disadvantage to our selves as for∣merly we have been sensible of, if it be of the Lords mercies that we are not consumed, It certainly bespeaks our positive Thankfulness, when our Enemies are in any measure disap∣pointed or destroyed: and fearing the Lord should take notice under so many Intimations of his returning mercy, we should be found an Insensible people, as not standing before him with Thanksgiving, as well as lading him with our Complaints in the time of pressing Afflictions:</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>COUNCIL</HI> have thought meet to appoint and set apart the 29<HI>th.</HI> day of this In∣stant <HI>lune,</HI> as a day of Solemn Thanksgiving and praise to God for such his goodness and Fa∣vour, many Particulars of which mercy might be Instanced, but we doubt not those who are sensible of Gods Afflictions, have been as diligent to espy him returning to us; and that the Lord may behold us as a People offering praise and thereby glorifying him; The <HI>Coun∣cil</HI> doth Commend it to the <HI>Respective Ministers, Elders</HI> and people of this Jurisdiction; Solemnly and seriously to keep the same. Beseeching that being perswaded by the mercies of God we may all, even this whole people offer up our Bodies and Souls as a living and Ac∣ceptable Service unto God by Jesus Christ.</P>
