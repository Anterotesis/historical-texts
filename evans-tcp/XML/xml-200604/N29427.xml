</FIGURE> At A GENERAL COƲRT Held at Boston, March the eleventh 1673/4.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas it pleaseth GOD still to Exercise his peo∣ple here &amp; else-where, with many and various Difficulties &amp; Trialls: Particularly, the brea∣king forth of Notorious &amp; scandolous Sinns among us, The straitning of several persons with respect to the scar∣city of Grain &amp; other provision, Divisions in some Socie∣ties, Danger of Warr threatning us, The condition of our Dear native Country and the people of God there &amp; else where in Europe, respecting the Warrs &amp; other Troubles:</P>
<P>These and other considerations hath moved this Court, Who do hereby Order &amp; Appoint That the Twenty Sixt day of this instant March, be set apart &amp; kept as a day of Humiliation and Prayer, to seek the Lord in these things, and for a blessing upon the Country, and the Labours of the People the year ensuing. And do Commend it to all the Churches, Pastours, Teachers, Mi∣nisters and People within this Jurisdiction, solemnly and seriously to keep the same accordingly.</P>
