<HEAD>The Town called Providence Its Fate.</HEAD>
<L>Why muse wee thus to see the wheeles run cross</L>
<L>Since <HI>Providence</HI> it self sustaines a loss:</L>
<L>And yet should <HI>Providence</HI> forget to watch</L>
<L>I fear the enemy would all dispatch;</L>
<L>Celestial lights would soon forget their line,</L>
<L>The wandering planets would forget to shine,</L>
<L>The stars run all out of their common spheres,</L>
<L>And quickly fall together by the eares:</L>
<L>Kingdoms would jostles out their Kings and set</L>
<L>The poor Mechanick up whome next they met,</L>
<L>Or rather would whole kingdoms with the world</L>
<L>Into a <HI>Chaos</HI> their first egge be hurl'd.</L>

But of a solitary town I write,</L>
<L>A place of darkness yet receiving light</L>
<L>From pagan hands, a miscellanious nest</L>
<L>Of errors Hectors, where they sought a rest</L>
<L>Out of the reach of Lawes but not of God,</L>
<L>Since they have felt the smart of common rod.</L>
<L>T was much I thought they did escape so long,</L>
<L>Who Gospel truth so manifestly wronge:</L>
<L>For one <HI>Lots</HI> sake perhaps, or else I think</L>
<L>Justice did at greatest offenders wink</L>
<L>But now the shott is paid, I hope the dross</L>
<L>Will be cashiered in this common loss.</L>
<L>Houses with substance feel uplifting wings,</L>
<L>The earth remains, the last of humane things:</L>
<L>But know the dismal day draws neer wherein</L>
<L>The fire shall earth if self dissolve and sin.</L>

<L>They sink and all their sorrows ponderous weight</L>
<L>Down at their feet they cast and tumble straight.</L>
<L>Such who outliv'd the fate of others fly</L>
<L>Into the Irish bogs of misery.</L>
<L>Such who might dye like men like beasts do range</L>
<L>Uncertain whither for a better change,</L>

<L>Confusive outcryes every where resounds:</L>
<L>The natives shooting with the mixed cryes,</L>
<L>With all the crueltyes the foes devise.</L>
<L>Might fill a volume, but I leave a space</L>

<L>Their undulating silks they closely furle.</L>
<L>The pick-axe one as a Commandress holds,</L>
<L>While t'other at her awkness gently scolds.</L>
<L>One puffs and sweats, the other mutters why</L>
<L>Cant you promove your work so fast as I?</L>
