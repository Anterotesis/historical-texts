<OPENER><SALUTE>SIRE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN recounting the numerous blessings which have arisen to mankind from the discovery of America, the mind dwells with particular pleasure and grati∣tude upon those Characters, from whose hands these blessings have immediately flowed. That change in the political face of Europe, that liberality of sentiment, that enlargement of commercial, milita∣ry and philosophical knowledge, which contrast the present with the fifteenth century, are but so many consequences of this great event; an event whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> laid open all parts of the earth to the range of the
<PB REF="020220_0003_0FAE44D826CC4FE0"/>
liberal mind. The illustrious line of your royal Ancestors have been conspicuous in seizing those advantages and diffusing their happy effects. The great Father of the House of Bourbon will be held in the highest veneration, till his favourite political system shall be realized among the nations of Eu∣rope, and extended to all mankind. But it was left to his more glorious Descendant, to accelerate the progress of society, by disregarding the tempo∣rary interests and local policies of other Monarchs, reaching the hand of beneficence to another hem∣isphere, and raising an infant empire, in a few years, to a degree of importance, which several ages were scarcely thought sufficient to produce.</P>
<P>THIS is the sublime of humanity, to feel for fu∣ture ages and distant nations; to act those things, as a Monarch, which another can only contemplate as a Philosopher, or image in the flights of poetry. America acknowledges her obligations to the Guar∣dian of her rights; mankind, who survey your con∣duct, and posterity, for whom you act, will see that the tribute of gratitude is paid.</P>
<P>IF to patronize the Arts can add to the praise of these more glorious actions, your Majesty's fame in this respect will be ever sacred; as there are none, who can feel the subject so strongly as those who
<PB REF="020220_0004_0FAE44D8EB556240"/>
are the particular objects of your royal condescen∣sion.</P>
<P>THE following work, which may be considered in part, as the offspring of those reflections which your Majesty's conduct has taught me to make, possesses one advantage scarcely to be expected in a Poem written in a foreign language. Your Majes∣ty's permission, that the unfortunate Columbus may once more enjoy the protection of a royal ben∣efactor, has added a new obligation to those I be∣fore felt—in common with a grateful country. It is the policy of wise Princes to encourage the liberal arts among their subjects; and, as the human race are the objects of your extended administration, they may all in some measure claim the privilege of subjects, in seeking your literary as well as po∣litical protection.</P>
<P>WITH the deepest sense of your Majesty's royal munificence to my country, and gracious condescen∣sion to myself, I have the honour to be,</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY circumstance relating to the discovery and settlement of America, is an interesting object of enquiry. Yet it is presumed, from the present state of literature in this country, that many persons, who might be entertained with an American production of this kind, are but slightly acquainted with the life and character of that great man, whose extraordinary genius led him to the discovery of the continent, and whose singular sufferings ought to excite the indigna∣tion of the world.</P>
<P>THE Spanish historians, who treat of the discovery and settlement of South-America, are very little known in the United States; and Doctor Robertson's histo∣ry of that country, which, as is usual in the works of that judicious writer, contains all that is valuable on the subject, is not yet reprinted in America, and therefore cannot be supposed to be in the hands of American readers in general: and perhaps no other writer in the English language has given a sufficient account of the life of Columbus to enable them to un∣derstand many of the necessary allusions in the fol∣lowing Poem.</P>
<P>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS was born in the repub∣lic of Genoa about the year 1447; at a time when the navigation of Europe was scarcely extended be∣yond the limits of the Mediterranean. The mari∣ner's compass had been invented and in common use for more than a century; yet with the help of this
<PB N="viii" REF="020220_0006_0FAE44DA6C008E90"/>
sure guide, prompted by the most ardent spirit of discovery, and encouraged by the patronage of prin∣ces, the mariners of those days rarely ventured from the sight of land. They acquired great applause by sailing along the coast of Africa and discovering some of the neighbouring islands; and after pushing their researches with the greatest industry and perseverance for more than half a century, the Portuguese, who were the most fortunate and enterprising, extended their discoveries southward no farther than the equator.</P>
<P>THE rich commodities of the East had for several ages been brought into Europe by the way of the Red Sea and the Mediterranean; and it had now become the object of the Portuguese to find a passage to In∣dia, by sailing round the southern extremity of Africa and then taking an eastern course. This great object engaged the general attention of mankind, and drew into the Portuguese service adventurers from every maritime nation in Europe. Every year added to their experience in navigation and seemed to promise a reward to their industry. The prospect however of arriving at the Indies was extremely distant; fifty years perseverance in the same track, had brought them only to the equator, and it was probable that as many more would elapse before they could accomplish their pur∣pose. But Columbus, by an uncommon exertion of genius, formed a design no less astonishing to the age in which he lived, than beneficial to posterity. This design was to sail to India by taking a western direc∣tion. By the accounts of travellers who had visited India, that country seemed almost without limits on the east; and by attending to the spherical figure of the earth, Columbus drew this conclusion, that the At∣lantic ocean must be bounded on the west either by India itself, or by some great continent not far distant from it.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="020220_0007_0FAE44DB28427520"/>THIS extraordinary man, who was now about twen∣ty-seven years of age, appears to have united in his character every trait, and to have possessed every tal∣lant, requisite to form and execute the greatest enter∣prizes. He was early educated in all the useful sci∣ences that were taught in that day. He had made great proficiency in geography, astronomy and draw∣ing, as they were necessary to his favourite pursuit of navigation. He had now been a number of years in the service of the Portuguese, and had acquired all the experience that their voyages and discoveries could afford. His courage and perseverance had been put to the severest test, and the exercise of every amiable and heroic virtue rendered him universally known and respected. He had married a Portuguese lady by whom he had two sons▪ Diego and Fardinand; the younger of whom is the historian of his life.</P>
<P>SUCH was the situation of Columbus, when he form∣ed and thoroughly digested a plan, which, in its op∣eration and consequences, unfolded to the view of mankind one half of the globe, diffused wealth and dignity over the other, and extended commerce and civilization through the whole▪ To corroborate the theory which he had formed of the existence of a wes∣tern continent, his descerning mind, which always knew the application of every circumstance that fell in his way▪ had observed several facts which by others would have passed unnoticed. In his voyages to the African islands he had found, floating ashore after a long western storm, pieces of wood carved in a curi∣ous manner, canes of a size unknown in that quarter of the world, and human bodies with very singular features. Fully confirmed in the opinion that a con∣siderable portion of the earth was still undiscovered, his genius was too vigorous and persevering to suffer an idea of this importance to rest merely in specula∣tion,
<PB N="x" REF="020220_0008_0FAE44DCA8770240"/>
as it had done in the minds of Plato and Seneca, who appear to have had conjectures of a similar na∣ture. He determined therefore to bring his favourite theory to the test of actual experiment. But an ob∣ject of that magnitude required the patronage of a Prince; and a design so extraordinary met with all the obstructions, delays and disappointments, which an age of superstition could invent, and which personal jealousy and malice could magnify and encourage. Happily for mankind, in this instance, a genius, ca∣pable of devising the greatest undertakings, associat∣ed in itself a degree of patience and enterprize, mo∣desty and confidence, which rendered him superior, not only to these misfortunes, but to all the future ca∣lamities of his life. Prompted by the most ardent enthusiasm to be the discoverer of new continents, and fully sensible of the advantages that would result to mankind from such discoveries, he had the mortifica∣tion to waste away eighteen years of his life, after his system was well established in his own mind, before he could obtain the means of executing his designs. The greatest part of this period was spent in successive and fruitless solicitations, at Genoa, Portugal and Spain. As a duty to his native country, he made his first proposal to the Senate of Genoa; where it was soon rejected. Conscious of the truth of his theory, and of his own abilities to execute his design, he re∣tired without dejection from a body of men who were incapable of forming any just ideas upon the subject; and applied with fresh confidence to John the second, King of Portugal, who had distinguished himself as the great patron of navigation, and in whose service Columbus had acquired a reputation which entitled him and his project to general confidence and appro∣bation. But here he suffered an insult much greater than a direct refusal. After referring the examina∣tion of his scheme to the council who had the direc∣tion
<PB N="xi" REF="020220_0009_0FAE44DED562D2B0"/>
of naval affairs, and drawing from him his gen∣eral ideas of the length of the voyage and the course he meant to take, that great monarch had the mean∣ness to conspire with this council to rob Columbus of the glory and advantage he expected to derive from his undertaking. While Columbus was amused with this negotiation, in hopes of having his scheme adopt∣ed and patronized, a vessel was secretly dispatched, by order of the king, to make the intended discovery. Want of skill and perseverance in the pilot rendered the plot unsuccessful; and Columbus, on discovering the treachery, retired with an ingenuous indignation from a court capable of such duplicity.</P>
<P>HAVING now performed what was due to the coun∣try that gave him birth and to the one that had a∣dopted him as a subject, he was at liberty to court the patronage of any prince who should have the wisdom and justice to accept his proposals. He had com∣municated his ideas to his brother Bartholomew, whom he sent to England to negotiate with Henry seventh; at the same time that he went himself into Spain to apply in person to Fardinand and Isabella, who go∣verned the united kingdoms of Aragon and Castile. The circumstances of his brother's application in Eng∣land, which appears to have been unsuccessful, is not to my purpose to relate; and the limits prescribed to this introduction will prevent the detail of all the par∣ticulars relating to his own negociation in Spain. In this negociation Columbus spent eight years, in the various agitations of suspence, expectation and disap∣pointment; till, at length his scheme was adopted by Isabella, who undertook, as Queen of Castile, to de∣stroy the expences of the exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dition; and declared herself, ever after, the friend and patron of the hero who projected it.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="020220_0010_0FAE44DEE9A0E7F8"/>COLUMBUS, who, during all his ill success in the ne∣gotiation, never abated any thing of the honours and emo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ments which he expected to acquire in the ex∣pedition, obtained from Fardinand and Isabella a full stipulation of every article contained in his first pro∣posals. He was constituted high Admiral and Vice∣roy of all the Seas, Islands and Continents which he should discover; with power to receive one tenth of the profits arising from their productions and com∣merce. These offices and emoluments were to be heredita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in his family.</P>
<P>THESE articles being adjusted, the preparations for the voyage were brought forward with rapidity; but they were by no means adequate to the importance of the expedition. Three small vessels, scarcely suffici∣ent in size to be employed in the coasting business, were appointed to traverse the vast Atlantic; and to encounter the storms and currents that might be ex∣pected in so lengthy a voyage, through distant and un∣known seas. These vessels, as might be expected in the infancy of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avigation, were ill constructed, in a poor condition, and manned by seamen unaccustomed to distant voyages. But the tedious length of time which Columbus had spent in solicitation and sus∣pence, and the prospect of being able soon, to obtain the object of his wishes, induced him to overlook what he could not easily remedy, and led him to dis∣regard those circums<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ances which would have intimid∣ated any other mind. He accordingly equiped his small squadron with as much expedition as possible, manned with ninety men and victualled for one year. With these, on the 3d of August 1492, amidst a vast croud of anxious spectators, he set sail on an enter∣prize, which, if we consider th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ill condition of his ships, the inexperience of his sailors, the length and
<PB N="xiii" REF="020220_0011_0FAE44DFA9BBC2F8"/>
uncertainty of his voyage, and the consequences that flowed from it, was the most daring and important that ever was undertaken. He touched at some of the Portuguese settlements in the Canary Isles; where, although he had had but a few days run, he found his vessels needed refitting. He soon made the necessary repairs, and took his departure from the westermost Islands that had hitherto been discovered. Here he left the former track of navigation and steered his course due west.</P>
<P>NOT many days after he had been at sea, he began to experience a new scene of difficulty. The sailors now began to contemplate the dangers and uncertain issue of a voyage, the nature and length of which was left entirely open to conjecture. Besides the fickle∣ness and timidity natural to men unaccustomed to the discipline of a seafaring life, several circumstances contributed to inspire an obstinate and mutinous dispo∣sition, which required the most consummate art as well as fortitude in the admiral to controul. Having been three weeks at sea, and experienced the uniform course of the trade winds, which always blow in a west∣ern direction, they contended that, should they con∣tinue the same course for a longer period, the same winds would never permit them to return to Spain. The magnetic needle began to vary its direction. This being the first time that phenomenon was ever discovered, it was viewed by the sailors with astonish∣ment, and considered as an indication that nature it∣self had changed her course, and that Providence was determined to punish their audacity, in venturing so far beyond the ordinary bounds of man. They declared that the commands of their sovereign had been fully obeyed, in their proceeding so many days in the same direction, and so far surpassing the attempts of all for∣mer
<PB N="xiv" REF="020220_0012_0FAE44E4090B98F8"/>
navigators, in quest of new discoveries. Every talent, requisite for governing, soothing and temper∣ing the passions of men, is conspicuous in the conduct of Columbus on this occasion. The dignity and af∣fability of his manners, his surprising knowledge and experience in naval affairs, his unwearied and minute attention to the duties of his command gave him a complete ascendant over the minds of his men, and inspired that degree of confidence which would have maintained his authority in almost any possible cir∣cumstances. But here, from the nature of the under∣taking, every man had leisure to feed his imagination with all the gloominess and uncertainty of the pros∣pect. They found, every day, that the same steady gales carried them with great rapidity from their na∣tive country, and indeed from all countries of which they had any knowledge. Notwithstanding all the variety of management with which Columbus addressed himself to their passions, sometimes by soothing them with the prognostics of discovering land, sometimes by flattering their ambition and feasting their avarice with the glory and wealth they would acquire from discovering those rich countries beyond the Atlantic, and sometimes by threatening them with the displea∣sure of their sovereign, should their timidity and dis∣obedience defeat so great an object, their uneasiness still increased. From secret whisperings, it arose to o∣pen mutiny and dangerous conspiracy. At length they determined to rid themselves of the remonstran∣ces of Columbus, by throwing him into the sea. The infection spread from ship to ship, and involved Offi∣cers as well as common sailors. They finally lost all sense of subordination, and addressed their command∣er in an insolent manner, demanding to be conducted immediately back to Spain; or, they assured him, they would seek their own safety by taking away his life.
<PB N="xv" REF="020220_0013_0FAE44E5A7756508"/>
Columbus, whose sagacity and penetration had dis∣covered every symptom of the disorder, was prepared for this last stage of it, and was sufficiently apprized of the danger that awaited him. He found it vain to con∣tend with passions he could no longer controul. He therefore proposed that they should obey his orders for three days longer; and, should they not discover land in that time, he would then direct his course for Spain. They complied with his proposal; and, hap∣pily for mankind, in three days they discovered Land. This was a small Island, to which Columbus gave the name of San Salvador. Their first interview with the natives was a scene of amusement and compassion on the one part, and of astonishment and adoration on the other. The natives were entirely naked, sim∣ple and timorous, and they viewed the Spaniards as a superior order of beings, descended from the Sun, which, in that Island and in most parts of America, was worshiped as a Deity. By this it was easy for Colum∣bus to perceive the line of conduct proper to be ob∣served toward that simple and inoffensiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> people. Had his companions and successors, of the Spanish na∣tion possessed the wisdom and humanity of that great discoverer, the benevolent mind would feel no sensa∣tions, of regret, in contemplating the extensive advan∣tages arising to mankind from the discovery of A∣merica.</P>
<P>IN this voyage, Columbus discovered the Islands of Cuba and Hispaniola; on the latter of which, he erect∣ed a small fort, and having left a garrison of thirty∣eight men, under the command of an Officer by the name of Arada, he set sail for Spain. Returning a∣cross the Atlantic, he was overtaken by a violent storm, which lasted several days and increased to such a degree, as baffled all his naval skill and threatened
<PB N="xvi" REF="020220_0014_0FAE44E7892F8448"/>
immediate destruction. In this situation, when all were in a state of despair, and it was expected that ev∣ery sea would swallow up the crazy vessel, he manifest∣ed a serenity and presence of mind, perhaps never e∣qualled in cases of like extremity. He wrote a short account of his voyage and of the discoveries he had made, wrapped it in an oiled cloth, enclosed it in a cake of wax, put it into an empty cask and threw it o∣verboard; in hopes that some accident might pre∣serve a deposit of so much importance to the world.</P>
<P>THE storm however abated, and he at length ar∣rived in Spain; after having been driven by stress of weather into the Port of Lisbon, where he had oppor∣tunity in an interview with the King of Portugal, to prove the truth of his system by arguments more con∣vincing than those he had before advanced, in the character of an humble and unsuccessful suitor. He was received every where in Spain with Royal hon∣ours, his family was ennobled, and his former stipula∣tion respecting his offices and emoluments was ratifi∣ed in the most solemn manner, by Fardinand and Isa∣bella; while all Europe resounded his praises and re∣ciprocated their joy and congratulations on the discov∣ery of a new world.</P>
<P>THE immediate consequence of this was a second voyage; in which Columbus took charge of a squad∣ron of seventeen Ships of considerable burthen. Vo∣lunteers of all ranks and conditions solicited to be employed in this expedition. He carried over fif∣teen hundred persons, together with all the necessa∣ries for establishing a Colony and extending his dis∣coveries. In this voyage he explored most of the West-India Islands; but, on his arrival at Hispaniola, he found the garrison he had left there had been total∣ly
<PB N="xvii" REF="020220_0015_0FAE44E8235EDAF8"/>
destroyed by the natives, and the fort demolished. He however proceeded in the planting of his colo∣ny; and, by his prudent and humane conduct towards the natives, he effectually established the Spanish au∣thority in that Island. But while he was thus laying the foundation of their future grandeur in South A∣merica, some discontented persons, who had returned from the colony to Spain, together with his former enemies in that Kingdom, conspired to accomplish his ruin.</P>
<P>THEY represented his conduct in such a light at court, as to create uneasiness and distrust in the jeal∣ous mind of Fardinand, and made it necessary for Co∣lumbus again to return to Spain, in order to counter∣act their machinations, and to obtain such farther sup∣plies as were necessary to his great political and be∣nevolent purposes. On his arriving at court, and stating with his usual dignity and confidence the whole history of his transactions abroad, every thing wore a favourable appearance. He was received with usual honours, and again solicited to take charge of another squadron, to carry out farther supplies, to pursue his discoveries, and in every respect to use his discretion in extending the Spanish Empire in the new World. In this third voyage he discovered the Con∣tinent of America at the mouth of the river Oronoque. He rectified many disorders in his government of Hi∣spaniola which had happened in his absence; and ev∣ery thing was going on in a prosperous train, when an event was announced to him, which completed his own ruin, and gave a fatal turn to the Spanish policy and conduct in America. This was the arrival of Francis de Bovadilla, with a commission to supercede Columbus in his government; and with power to ar∣raign him as a criminal, and to judge of his former administration.</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="020220_0016_0FAE44E8B3138BD8"/>IT seems that by this time the enemies of Columbus, despairing to complete his overthrow by groundless insinuations of mal-conduct, had taken the more ef∣fectual method of exciting the jealousy of their Sove∣reigns. From the promising samples of Gold and oth∣er valuable commodities brought from America, they took occasion to represent to the King and Queen, that the prodigious wealth and extent of the countries he had discovered would soon throw such power into the hands of the Viceroy, that he would trample on the Royal Authority and bid defiance to the Spanish pow∣er. These arguments were well calculated for the cold and suspicious temper of Fardinand, and they must have had some effect upon the mind of Isabella. The consequence was the appointment of Bavadilla, who had been the inveterate enemy of Columbus, to take the government from his hands. This first tyrant of the Spanish nation in America began his admini∣stration by ordering Columbus to be put in chains on board a ship, and sending him prisoner to Spain. By relaxing all discipline he introduced disorder and licen∣ciousness throughout the colony. He subjected the unhappy natives to a most miserable servitude, and ap∣portioned them out in large numbers among his adhe∣rents. Under this severe treatment perished in a short time many thousands of those innocent people.</P>
<P>COLUMBUS was carried in his fetters to the Spanish court, where the King and Queen either feigned or felt a sufficient regret at the conduct of Bovadilla to∣wards this illustrious prisoner. He was not only re∣leased from confinement, but treated with all imagin∣able respect. But, although the king endeavoured to expiate the offence by censuring and recalling Bova∣dilla, yet we may judge of his sincerity from his ap∣pointing Nicholas de Ovando, another bitter enemy of Columbus, to succeed in the government, and from
<PB N="xix" REF="020220_0017_0FAE44E97052C9E0"/>
his ever after refusing to reinstate Columbus, or to ful∣fil any of the conditions on which the discoveries were undertaken. After two years solicitation for this or some other employment, he at length obtained a squadron of four small vessels to attempt new discove∣ries. He now set out, with the ardour and enthusiasm of a young adventurer, in quest of what was always his favourite object, a passage into the South Sea, by which he might sail to India. He touched at Hispan∣iola, where Ovando, the governor, refused him admit∣tance on shore even to take shelter during a hurricane, the prognostics of which his experience had taught him to discern. By putting into a small creek, he rode out the storm, and then bore away for the conti∣nent. Several months, in the most boisterous season of the year, he spent in exploring the coast round the gulph of Mexico, in hopes of finding the intended navigation to India. At length he was shipwrecked, and driven ashore on the Island of Jamaica.</P>
<P>HIS cup of calamities seemed now completely full. He was cast upon an island of savages, without pro∣visions, without any vessel, and thirty leagues from any Spanish settlement. But the greatest providen∣tial misfortunes are capable of being imbittered by the insults of our fellow creatures. A few of his hardy companions generously offered, in two Indian canoes, to attempt a voyage to Hispaniola, in hopes of obtaining a vessel for the relief of the unhappy crew. After suffering every extremity of danger and hardship, they arrived at the Spanish colony in ten days. Ovando, through personal malice and jeal∣ousy of Columbus, after having detained these mes∣sengers eight months, dispatched a vessel to Jamaica, in order to spy out the condition of Columbus and his crew; with positive instructions to the Captain not to afford them any relief. This order was punctually executed. The Captain approached the
<PB N="xx" REF="020220_0018_0FAE44EA4A983C08"/>
shore, delivered a letter of empty compliment from Ovando to the Admiral, received his answer and re∣turned. About four months afterwards a vessel came to their relief; and Columbus, worn out with fatigues and broken with misfortunes, returned for the last time to Spain. Here a new distress awaited him, which he considered as one of the greatest he had suf∣fered, in his whole life. This was the death of Queen Isabella, his last and greatest friend.</P>
<P>HE did not suddenly abandon himself to despair. He called upon the gratitude and justice of the King; and, in terms of dignity, demanded the fulfilment of his former contract. Notwithstanding his age and infirmities, he even solicited to be farther employed in extending the career of discovery, without a pros∣pect of any other reward but the consciousness of doing good to mankind. But Fardinand, col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ungrateful and timid, dared not to comply with a single propo∣sal of this kind, lest he should encrease his own obli∣gations to a man, whose services he thought it danger∣ous to reward. He therefore delayed and avoided any decision on these subjects, in hopes that the declining health of Columbus would soon rid the court of the remonstrances of a man, whose extraordinary merit was, in their opinion, a sufficient occasion of destroy∣ing him. In this they were not disappointed. Co∣lumbus languished a short time, and gladly resigned a life, which had been worn out in the most essential services perhaps that were ever rendered, by any hu∣man character, to an ungrateful world.</P>
<P>SOMETIME in this gloomy interval, before his death, the Vision is supposed to have been presented to him; in order to satisfy his benevolent mind, by unfolding to him the importance of his discoveries, in their ex∣tensive influence upon the interest and happiness of mankind, in the progress of society.</P>
<P><PB N="xxi" REF="020220_0019_0FAE44EAFA0E7128"/>THE Author has indulged a small anachronism in the opening of the Poem, for the sake of grouping the misfortunes of the hero; as the time of his actu∣al imprisonment was previous to his last voyage and to the death of Isabella.</P>
<P>THE Author, at first, formed an idea of attempting a regular Epic Poem, on the discovery of America. But on examining the nature of that event, he found that the most brilliant subjects incident to such a plan would arise from the consequences of the discovery, and must be represented in vision. Indeed to have made it a patriotic Poem, by extending the subject to the settlement and revolutions of North America and their probable effect upon the future progress of soci∣ety at large, would have protracted the vision to such a degree as to render it disproportionate to the rest of the work. To avoid an absurdity of this kind, which he supposed the critics would not pardon, he rejected the idea of a regular Epic form, and has con∣fined his plan to the train of events which might be re∣presented to the hero in vision. This form he con∣siders as the best that the nature of the subject would admit; and the regularity of the parts will appear by observing, that there is a single poetical design con∣stantly kept in view, which is to gratify and sooth the desponding mind of the hero: It being the greatest possible reward of his services, and the only one that his sit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion would permit him to enjoy, to convince him that his labours had not been bestowed in vain, and that he was the author of such extensive happiness to the human race.</P>

<HEAD>THE VISION OF COLUMBUS. BOOK I.</HEAD>
<L>LONG had the Sage, the first who dared to brave</L>
<L>The unknown dangers of the western wave,</L>
<L>Who taught mankind where future empires lay</L>
<L>In these fair confines of descending day,</L>
<L>With cares o'erwhelm'd, in life's distressing gloom,</L>
<L>Wish'd from a thankless world a peaceful tomb;</L>
<L>While kings and nations, envious of his name,</L>
<L>Enjoy'd his toils and triumph'd o'er his fame,</L>
<L>And gave the chief, from promised empire hurl'd,</L>
<L>Chains for a crown, a prison for a world.</L>
<L>Now night and silence held their lonely reign,</L>
<L>The half-orb'd moon declining to the main;</L>
<L>Descending clouds, o'er varying ether driven,</L>
<L>Obscured the stars and shut the eye from heaven;</L>
<L>Cold mists through opening grates the cell invade,</L>
<L>And deathlike terrors haunt the midnight shade;</L>
<L>When from a visionary, short repose,</L>
<L>That raised new cares and temper'd keener woes,</L>
<L>Columbus woke, and to the walls address'd</L>
<L>The deep-felt sorrows of his manly breast.</L>

<L>Of painful years and persevering toil:</L>
<L>For these dread walks, this hideous haunt of pain,</L>

<L>Dared all the dangers of the dreary wave,</L>

<L>Till, tost far onward to the skirts of day,</L>
<L>Where milder suns dispens'd a smiling ray,</L>
<L>Through brighter skies my happier sails descry'd</L>
<L>The golden banks that bound the western tide,</L>
<L>And gave the admiring world that bounteous shore</L>
<L>Their wealth to nations and to kings their power.</L>
<L>Oh land of transport! dear, delusive coast,</L>
<L>To these fond, aged eyes forever lost!</L>
<L>No more thy gladdening vales I travel o'er,</L>
<L>For me thy mountains rear the head no more,</L>
<L>For me thy rocks no sparkling gems unfold,</L>
<L>Or streams luxuriant wear their paths in gold;</L>
<L>From realms of promised peace forever borne,</L>
<L>I hail dread anguish, and in secret mourn.</L>
<L>But dangers past, fair climes explored in vain,</L>

<L>Whose union'd souls the mighty plan design'd,</L>
<L>To bless the nations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>From the traditions of Capac and Oella, mentioned by the Spanish historians, they appear to have been very great and distin∣guished characters. About three centuries previous to the discov∣ery of that country by the Spaniards, the natives of Peru were as rude savages as any in America. They had no fixed habitations, no ideas of permanent property; they wandered naked like the beasts, and, like them, depended on the events of each day for a precarious subsistence. At this period, Manco Capac and his wife Mama Oella appeared on a small island in the lake Titiaca; near which the city of Cusco was afterwards erected. These persons, in order to establish a belief of their divinity, in the minds of the peo∣ple, were clothed in white garments of cotton; and declared them∣selves descended from the Sun, who was their father and the God of that country. They affirmed that he was offended at their cruel and perpetual wars, their barbarous modes of worship, and their neglecting to make the best use of the blessings he was constantly bestowing, in fertilizing the earth and producing vegetation; that he pitied their wretched state, and had sent his own children to in∣struct them, and to establish a number of wise regulations, by which they might be rendered happy.</P>
<P>By some extraordinary method of persuasion, these persons drew together a number of the savage tribes, laid the foundations of the city of Cusco, and established what was called the kingdom of the Sun, or the Peruvian empire. In the reign of Manco Capac, the dominion was extended about eight leagues from the city; and at the end of three centuries, it was established fifteen hundred miles on the coast of the Pacific ocean; and from that ocean to the mountains of the Andes. During this period, through a succession of twelve monarchs, the original constitution, established by the first Inca, remained unaltered; and was at last overturned by an acci∣dent, which no human wisdom could foresee or prevent.</P>
<P>For a more particular disquisition on the character and institu∣tions of this great Legislator, the Reader is referred to a dissertation prefixed to the third Book.</P>
<P>Mama Oella is said to have invented many of the domestic arts, particularly that of making garments of cotton and other vegetable substances.</P>
<P>In the passage preceding this reference, I have alluded to most of the traditions, relating to the manner of their introducing them∣selves, and establishing their dominion. In the remainder of the second, and through the whole of the third Book, I have given what may be supposed a probable narrative of their real origin and con∣duct. I have thrown the episode into an epic form, and given it so considerable a place in the Poem, for the purpose of exhibiting <HI>in action</HI> the characters, manners and sentiments of the different tribes of savages, that inhabit the mountains of South-America.</P>
<P>In reviewing this part of my subject, I have to lament, that so extraordinary and meritorious a Poem, as the Araucana of don Alonso de Ercilla, of the sixteenth century, has never yet appeared in our language. The account given of that work by Voltaire ex∣cited my curiosity at an early day; as I conceived the manners and characters of the mountain savages of Chile, as described by that heroic Spaniard, must have opened a new field of Poetry, rich with uncommon ornaments.</P>
<P>That elegant and concise sketch of it lately given to the pub∣lic by Mr. Hayley, has come into my hands, since I have been writing these notes, and but a few days previous to the Poem's being put to the press. Yet it gives me reason to hope, with every friend of literature, that the whole of that great work will ere long be presented to the English Reader by the same hand.</P>
<P>It is usually presumed, that every Author must have read all that have gone before him, at least on subjects similar to what he at∣tempts; yet the Lusiad of Camoens, a Poem of great merit on the expedition of Gama, I had sought for in vain in different parts of America, and even sent to Europe without being able to obtain it; till, a few days since, it came to hand in the majestic and spirited translation of Mr. Mickle. The extensive and sublime objects opened to our view in a work which celebrates the discovery of one part of the globe, may well be thought worthy the contemplation of a writer, who endeavours to trace the consequences of a similar event in another. Of this I was before sensible; but these are not the only disadvantages that an Author, in a new country, and in moderate circumstances, must have to encounter.</P></NOTE> and reform mankind.</L>

<HEAD>A DISSERTATION ON THE GENIUS AND INSTITUTIONS OF MANCO CAPAC.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH the original inhabitants of A∣merica in general deserve to be classed among the most unimproved savages that have ever been disco∣vered; yet the Mexican and Peruvian governments exhibit remarkable instances of order and regularity. In the difference of national character between these two empires, we may discern the influence of political systems on the human mind; and infer the import∣ance of the task which a legislator undertakes, in at∣tempting to reduce a barbarous people under the con∣troul of government and laws. The Mexican con∣stitution was formed to render its subjects brave and powerful; but, while it succeeded in this object, it tended to remove them farther from the real blessings of society, than they were, while in the rudest state of nature. The history of the world affords no instance of men whose manners were equally ferocious, and whose superstition was more bloody and unrelenting. On the contrary, the establishments of Manco Capac carry the marks of a most benevolent and pacific system; they tended to humanize the world and ren∣der his people happy; while his ideas of the Deity were so perfect, as to bear a comparison with the en∣lightened doctrines of Socrates or Plato.</P>
<P>THE most distinguished characters in history, who have been considered as legislators among bar∣barous
<PB N="78" REF="020220_0074_0FAE453489E35B58"/>
nations, are Moses, Lycurgus, Solon, Numa, Mahomet and Peter of Russia. Of these, only the two former and the two latter appear really to deserve that character. Solon and Numa possessed not the means nor the opportunity of shewing their talents in the business of original legislation. Athens and Rome were considerably advanced in civilization, before these characters arose. The most they could do was to correct and amend constitutions already formed. So∣lon, in particular, may be considered as a wise politi∣cian; but by no means as the founder of a nation. The Athenians were too far advanced in society to admit any radical alteration in their form of govern∣ment; if indeed any form can be said to exist, where every thing is left to the controul of a capricious multitude. The institutions of Numa were more ef∣fective and durable; his religious ceremonies were, for many ages, the most powerful check upon the li∣centious and turbulent Romans. By inculcating a remarkable reverence for the Gods, and making it ne∣cessary to consult the Auspices, when any thing im∣portant was to be transacted, he rendered the popular superstition subservient to the views of policy, and gave the senate a steady check upon the extravagance of the plebeans. But the constitutions of Rome and Athens, however the subject of so much injudicious applause, were never fixed upon any permanent prin∣ciples; though the wisdom of some of their rulers, and the spirit of liberty that inspired the people, justly demand our admiration.</P>
<P>EACH of the other legislators above mentioned de∣serves a particular consideration; as acting in stations somewhat similar to that of the Peruvian lawgiver. Three objects are to be attended to, by the legislator of a barbarous people. <HI>First,</HI> that his system be such as is capable of reducing the greatest number of men under one jurisdiction. <HI>Secondly,</HI> that it apply to such
<PB N="79" REF="020220_0075_0FAE453521D164F8"/>
principles in human nature for its support, as are uni∣versal and permanent; in order to ensure the duration of the government. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> that it admit of im∣provements correspondent to any advancement in knowledge or variation of circumstances, that may happen to its subjects; without endangering the prin∣ciple of government, by such innovations. So far therefore as the systems of those legislators agree with these fundamental principles, they are worthy of res∣pect; and so far as they deviate, they may be consi∣dered as defective and imperfect.</P>
<P>TO begin with Moses and Lycurgus; it is necessary in the first place to observe, that, in order to judge of the merit of any institutions, we must take into view the peculiar character of the people for whom they were framed. For want of this attention, many of the laws of Moses have been ridiculed by ignorant scep∣tics, and many establishments of Lycurgus censured by as ignorant politicians. The Jews, who were led by Moses out of Egypt, were not only uncivilized, but, having just risen to independence from a state of servitude, they united the manners of servants and savages; and their national character is a composition of servility and contumacy, ignorance, superstition, filthiness and cruelty. Of their cruelty as a people we need no other proof than the account of their avengers of blood, and the readiness with which the whole con∣gregation turned executioners and stoned to death the devoted offenders. The Leprosy, a disease now whol∣ly unknown, was undoubtedly produced by their to∣tal want of cleanliness, continued for successive genera∣tions. In this view the frequent ablutions, the pecu∣liar modes of trial, and many other institutions may be wholly vindicated from ridicule, and proved to be not only wise, but even necessary regulations.</P>
<P>THE Spartan lawgiver has been equally censured
<PB N="80" REF="020220_0076_0FAE4538567AF588"/>
for the toleration of theft and adultery. Among that race of Barbarians, these crimes were too general to admit of total prevention or universal punishment. By vesting all property in the community, instead of encou∣raging theft, he removed the possibility of the crime; and, in a nation where licentiousness was generally in∣dulged, it was a great step towards introducing a purity of manners, to punish adultery in all cases, wherein the crime was not committed by the free consent of all parties injured or interested.</P>
<P>THOSE constitutions of government are best calcu∣lated for immediate energy and duration, which are interwoven with some religious system. The legisla∣tor, who appears in the character of an inspired person, renders his political institutions sacred, and interests the conscience as well as the judgement in their sup∣port. The Jewish lawgiver had this advantage over the Spartan. He appeared not in the character of a mere earthly governor, but as an interpreter of the divine will. By injoining a religious observance of certain rites, he formed his people to habitual obedi∣ence; by directing their cruelty against the breakers of the laws, he at least mitigated the rancour of private hatred; by forbidding usury, and directing that real property should return to the original families in the year of Jubilee, he prevented too great an inequality of property; and by selecting a particular tribe, to be the guardians and interpreters of religion, he prevent∣ed its mysteries from being the subject of profane and vulgar investigation. To secure the permanency of his institutions, he prohibited any intercourse with foreigners, by severe restrictions▪ and formed his peo∣ple to habits and a character disagreeable to other na∣tions; by which means any foreign intercourse was prevented, from the mutual hatred of both parties.</P>
<P>TO these institutions the laws of Lycurgus bear a
<PB N="81" REF="020220_0077_0FAE45394895E810"/>
most striking resemblance. The features of his con∣stitution were severe and forbidding; it was however calculated to inspire the most enthusiastic love of li∣berty and martial honour. In no country was the patriotic passion more energetic than in Sparta; no laws ever excluded the idea of separate property in an equal degree, or inspired a more thorough contempt for the manners of other nations. The utter prohibi∣tion of money, commerce and almost every thing de∣sirable to effeminate nations, entirely excluded fo∣reigners from Sparta; and, while it inspired the people with contempt for others, it rendered them agreeable to each other. By these means, Lycurgus rendered the nation powerful and warlike; and to insure the duration of his government he endeavoured to interest the consciences of his people, by the aid of oracles, and the oath he is said to have exacted from them, to obey his laws till his return; when he went into a volun∣tary and perpetual exile.</P>
<P>FROM this view of the Jewish and Spartan institu∣tions, applied to the principles above stated, they ap∣pear, in the two first articles, considerably imperfect, and in the last, totally defective. Neither of them was calculated to bring any considerable territory or number of men under one jurisdiction; from this cir∣cumstance alone, they could not be rendered perma∣nent, as they must be constantly exposed to their more powerful neighbours. But the third object of legis∣lation, that of providing for the future progress of so∣ciety, which, as it regards the happiness of mankind, is the most important of the three, was in both instan∣ces entirely neglected. These systems appear to have been formed with an express design to prevent all fu∣ture improvement in knowledge, or enlargement of the human mind; and to fix those nations forever in a state of ignorance, superstition and barbarism. To
<PB N="82" REF="020220_0078_0FAE4539AB6F1848"/>
vindicate the Spartan from an imputation of weakness or inattention in this particular, it may be urged that he was surrounded by nations more powerful than his own; it was therefore impossible for him to com∣mence an establishment upon any other plan. And Moses must be vindicated upon this idea, that the di∣vine moral law, which was designed, at a future peri∣od, to regulate and harmonize the whole human race, must be preserved in that nation, which was to give birth to the Saviour of mankind. If we allow him to have had a prophetic knowledge of these events, his institutions may be pronounced unexceptionable in every part.</P>
<P>THE institutions of Mahomet, are next to be con∣sidered. The first object of legislation appears to have been better understood by the Arabian Prophet, than by either of the preceding sages; his jurisdic∣tion was capable of being enlarged to any extent of territory, and governing any number of nations, that might be subjugated by his powerful and enthusiastic armies; and to obtain this object his system of reli∣gion was admirably calculated. Like Moses, he con∣vinced his people that he acted as the vicegerent of Heaven; but with this capital advantage, adapting his religion to the natural feelings and propensities of mankind, he multiplied his followers, by the allure∣ments of pleasure and the promise of a sensual para∣dise. These circumstances were likewise sure to ren∣der his constitution permanent. His religious system was so easy to be understood, so splendid and so invit∣ing, there could be no danger that the people would lose sight of its principles, and no necessity of future prophets, to explain the doctrines, or reform the na∣tion. To these advantages if we add the exact and rigid military discipline, the splendor and sacredness of the monarch, and that total ignorance of the people, which such a system will produce and perpetuate, the
<PB N="83" REF="020220_0079_0FAE453A69DC2408"/>
establishment must be evidently well calculated for extent and duration. But the last and most import∣ant end of government, that of mental improvement and social happiness, was deplorably lost in the insti∣tution. And there was probably more learning and real genius in Arabia, in the days of this extraordina∣ry character, than can now be found in all the Turk∣ish dominions.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, the enterprising genius of the Russian monarch appears to have been wholly bent on the arts of civilization, and the improvement of society among his subjects. Happy in a legal title to a throne which already commanded a prodigious extent of country, he found that the first object of govern∣ment was already secured; and by applying himself with great sagacity and perseverance, to the third ob∣ject, he was sure that the second would be a necessary and invariable consequence. He effected his purpo∣ses, important as they were, merely by the introduc∣tion of the arts, and the encouragement of politer manners. The greatness of his genius appears not so much in his institutions, which he copied from other nations, as in the extraordinary measures he followed to introduce them, the judgement he showed in select∣ing and adapting them to the genius of his subjects, and his surprising assiduity and success, by which he raised a savage people to a dignified rank among Eu∣ropean nations. All his plans were formed to encou∣rage the future progress of society; and their dura∣tion was ensured by their obvious value and import∣ance. His successors have followed his political mea∣sures, with great attention to the same objects; and the present reigning empress has rendered herself not unworthy of so high and honourable a descent.</P>
<P>TO the genius and operation of the several forms of government above mentioned, we will compare
<PB N="84" REF="020220_0080_0FAE453B2ACB7D78"/>
that of the Peruvian Lawgiver. It is probable that the savages of Peru, before the time of Capac, among other objects of adoration, paid homage to the Sun. By availing himself of this popular sentiment, he ap∣peared, like Moses and Mahomet, in the character of a divine legislator, endowed with supernatural pow∣ers. After impressing these ideas strongly on the minds of the people, drawing together a number of the tribes and rendering them subservient to his be∣nevolent purposes, he applied himself to forming the outlines of a plan of policy, capable of founding and regulating an extensive empire; wisely calculated for perpetual duration; and expressly designed to im∣prove the knowledge, peace and happiness of a consi∣derable portion of mankind. In the apportionment of the lands, and the assignment of real property, he invented a mode somewhat resembling the Feudal System of Europe: yet this system was wisely check∣ed in its operation, by a law similar to that of Moses, which regulated landed possessions in the year of Ju∣bilee. He divided the lands into three parts; the first was consecrated to the uses of religion, the se∣cond set apart for the Inca and his family, to enable him to defray the expences of government and to ap∣pear in the style of a monarch, the third, and much the largest portion, was allotted to the people; and this allotment was repeated every year, and varied ac∣cording to the number and exigencies of each family.</P>
<P>AS the Incan family appeared in the character of Divinities, it was necessary that a subordination of ranks should be established; in order to render the distinction between the monarch and his people more perceptible. With this view he created a band of Nobles, who were distinguished by personal and here∣ditary honours. These were united to the monarch by the strongest ties of interest; in peace they acted as Judges, and superintended the police of the empire,
<PB N="85" REF="020220_0081_0FAE453BE619E418"/>
in war they commanded in the armies. The next order of men were the respectable peasantry of the country, who composed the principal strength of the nation. Below these was a class of men, who were the servants of the public; who cultivated the public lands. They possessed no property, and their only security depended on their regular industry and peace∣able demeanour. Above all these orders, were the Inca and his family. He was possessed of ab∣solute and uncontroulable power; his mandates were regarded as the word of Heaven, and the double guilt of impiety and rebellion attended on disobedience. To impress the utmost veneration for the Incan family, it was a fundamental prin∣ciple, that the royal blood should never be contami∣nated by any foreign alliance. The mysteries of re∣ligion were preserved sacred by the high priest of the royal family, under the controul of the king; and celebrated with rites, capaple of making the deepest impression on the multitude. The annual distribu∣tion of the lands, while it provided for the varying circumstances of each family, strengthened the bands of society, by preventing the different orders from in∣terfering with each other; the peasants could not vie with their superiors, and the Nobles could not be subjected by misfortune to a subordinate station. A constant habit of industry was inculcated upon all ranks by the surprizing force of example and emula∣tion. The cultivation of the soil, which in most other countries is considered as one of the lowest employ∣ments, was here regarded as a divine art. Having had no idea of it before, and being taught it by the children of their God, the people viewed it as a sacred privilege, and considered it as an honour, to imitate and assist the Sun in opening the bosom of the earth and producing vegetation. That the government might be able to exercise the endearing acts of be∣nevolence, the produce of the public lands was re∣served
<PB N="86" REF="020220_0082_0FAE453EF92092A0"/>
in magazines, to supply the wants of the un∣fortunate, as a deposit for the people in times of gen∣eral scarcity, and as a resource in case of an invasion.</P>
<P>THESE are the outlines of a government, the most simple and energetic conceivable, and capable of re∣ducing the greatest number of men under one juris∣diction; at the same time, accommodating its principle of action to every state of society, and every stage of improvement, by a singular and happy application to the passions of the human mind, it encouraged the ad∣vancement of knowledge, without being endangered by success. That such a government has a fair chance for perpetual duration is evident from this consideration, that a band of Nobles are ever the firm supporters of regal authority; unless the monarch is so limited in his power, that the Nobles despise his in∣fluence. This could not be the case in Peru; the Nobles were justly proud of their elevated station, though they could have no ambition to controul the Inca. They were sensible that their interest was con∣nected with that of the monarch; and, supposing the influence of religion to be out of the question, they would not attempt to destroy an institution on which their happiness depended. A check equally effective was, by the constitution of human nature, imposed on the Inca. Elevated above the competition and rival∣ship which corrode and torment the bosoms of the great, he could have no ambition to gratify and no motive to induce him to an improper exercise of arbi∣trary power.</P>
<P>IN the traits of character which distinguish this institution, we may discern all the great strokes of each of the legislators above mentioned. The pre∣tensions of Capac to divine authority were as artfully contrived and as effectual in their consequences, as those of Mahomet; his exploding the worship of evil
<PB N="87" REF="020220_0083_0FAE4540516AA610"/>
beings and objects of terror, forbidding human sacri∣fices, inculcating more rational ideas of the Deity, and accommodating the rites of worship to a God of justice and benevolence, produced a greater change in the national character of his people, than any of the laws of Moses: Like Peter, he provided for the fu∣ture improvement of society; while his actions were never measured upon the small and contracted scale, which limited the genius of Lycurgus.</P>
<P>THUS far we find the political system of Capac at least equal to those of the most celebrated ancient or modern lawgivers. But in one particular his charac∣ter is placed beyond all comparison; I mean for his religious institutions, and the just ideas he had formed, by the unenlightened efforts of human wisdom, of the nature and attributes of the Deity.</P>
<P>AND here I shall premise, that idolatrous nations have never been guilty of those glaring absurdities with which they are usually charged by the christian world. The Persian or Peruvian, when he directed his adoration to the Sun, considered it as the place of residence for the unknown Deity, whom he wor∣shipped, and who communicated from thence the blessings of light, warmth and vegetation; the Greek, who bowed at the statue of Jupiter, supposed it ani∣mated with the presence of his God; the Egyptian Apis, Isis and Orus, the calf, the leek and the onion, though the theme of universal ridicule to other nations, were, in their first consecration, like the Jewish Cheru∣bim, symbolical representations of the nature and attri∣butes of their Deities. No man ever erected a stock or a stone for a real object of worship; but all igno∣rant nations have paid their adoration before the sym∣bol of the Deity, in some shape or other, and directed their homage to the place of his supposed residence. Even among enlightened nations, we find many traces
<PB N="88" REF="020220_0084_0FAE45418FC13BD0"/>
of the same ideas; the Papist bows to the Picture and the Crucifix; and the Methodist rolls up his eyes in prayer to the Sky. Perhaps unassisted wisdom can rise no higher; and the reason why idol worship was forbid∣den in the divine law, was not because of the erroneous ideas of the original institutors, but because the views of the vulgar, in process of time, are apt to stop short at the intermediate object, and to lose sight of the orig∣inal invisible Essence. But the great crime of idola∣trous nations consisted in their ascribing to the Deity the passions and attributes of the Devil, and in the horrid and murtherous rites of their worship. Man∣kind are more inclined to consider the Deity as a God of vengeance than a God of mercy. Even among christians most persons ascribe afflictions to the hand of Heaven and prosperity to their own merit and prudence. This principle operates in its full effect among savages. They usually form no idea of a gen∣eral superintending Providence; they consider not the Deity as the author of their beings, the Creator of the world and the dispenser of the happiness they en∣joy; they discern him not in the usual course of nature, in the sunshine and in the shower, the productions of the earth and the blessing of society; they find a Dei∣ty only in the storm, the earthquake and the whirl∣wind; or ascribe to him the evils of pestilence and fa∣mine; they consider him as interposing in wrath to change the course of nature, and exercising the attri∣butes of rage and revenge. They adore him with rites suited to these attributes, with horror, with pe∣nance and with sacrifice; they imagine him pleased with the severity of their mortifications▪ with the ob∣lations of blood and the cries of human victims; and hope to compound for greater judgements, by volun∣tary sufferings and horrid sacrifices, suited to the re∣lish of his taste.</P>
<P>PERHAPS no single criterion can be given, which
<PB N="89" REF="020220_0085_0FAE45421429AEA0"/>
will determine more accurately the state of society in any age or nation, than their general ideas concern∣ing the nature and attributes of the Deity. In the most enlightened periods of antiquity, only a very few of their wisest Philosophers, a Socrates, a Tully, or a Confucius, ever formed a just idea on the subject, or described the Deity as a God of purity, justice and be∣nevolence. Can any thing then be more astonishing than to view a savage native of the southern wilds of America, rising in an age, void of every trace of learn∣ing or refinement, and acquiring by the mere efforts of reason, a sublime and rational idea of the Parent of the universe!</P>
<P>HE taught the nation to consider him as the God of order and regularity, ascribing to his influence the rotation of the seasons, the productions of the earth and the blessings of health; especially attributing to his inspiration the wisdom of their laws and that hap∣py constitution, which was the delight and veneration of the people.</P>
<P>THESE humane ideas of religion had a sensible ope∣ration upon the manners of the nation. They never began an offensive war with their savage neighbours; and, whenever their country was invaded, they made war, not to extirpate, but to civilize. The conquered tribes and those taken captive were adopted into the nation; and, by blending with the conquerors, forgot their former rage and ferocity.</P>
<P>A SYSTEM so just and benevolent, as might be ex∣pected, was attended with success. In about three hundred years, the dominions of the Incas had ex∣tended fifteen hundred miles in length, and had in∣troduced peace and prosperity through the whole re∣gion.
<PB N="90" REF="020220_0086_0FAE4542A97B0C90"/>
The arts of society had been carried to a con∣siderable degree of improvement, and the authority of the Incan race universally acknowledged; when an e∣vent happened, that disturbed the tranquility of the empire. Huana Capac, the twelfth monarch, had reduced the powerful kingdom of Quito, and annexed it to his empire. To conciliate the affections of his new subjects, he married a daughter of the ancient king of Quito. Thus, by violating a fundamental law of the Incas, he left at his death a disputed succession to the throne. Atabalipa, the son of Huana by the heiress of Quito, being in possession of the principal force of the Peruvian armies, which was left at that place on the death of his father, gave battle to his brother Huascar, who was the elder son of Huana by a lawful wife, and legal heir to the crown. After a long and destructive civil war, the former was victori∣ous; and thus was that flourishing and happy king∣dom left a prey to civil dissentions, and to the few soldiers of Pizarro, who happened at that juncture to make a discent upon their coast. Thus he effected an easy conquest and an utter destruction of that unfor∣tunate people. It is however extremely obvious, that this deplorable event is not to be charged on Capac, as the consequence of any defect in his institution. It is impossible that any original legislator should effectu∣ally guard against the folly of a futute sovereign. Capac had not only removed every temptation that could induce a wise prince to wish for a change in the constitution, but had connected the ruin of his author∣ity with the change; for he, who disregards any part of institutions deemed sacred, teaches his people to consider the whole as an imposture. Had he made a law ordaining that the Peruvians should be absolved from their allegiance to a prince, who should violate the laws; it would evidently have implied possible er∣ror and imperfection in those persons whom the people
<PB N="91" REF="020220_0087_0FAE45439B27BC88"/>
were ordered to regard as Divinities: the reverence due to characters who made such high pretensions, would have been weakened; and, instead of rendering the constitution perfect, such a law would have been its greatest defect. Besides, it is probable the rupture might have been healed, and the succession <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ettled, with as little difficulty as frequently happens with partial revolutions in other kingdoms; had not the de∣scent of the Spaniards prevented. And this event to a man in that age and country, was totally beyond the possibility of human foresight. But viewing the con∣currence of these fatal accidents, which reduced this flourishing empire to a level with many other ruined and departed kingdoms, it only proves that no human system has the privilege to be perfect.</P>
<P>ON the whole, it is evident, that the system of Ca∣pac is the most surprizing exertion of human genius to be found in the history of mankind. When we consider him as an individual emerging from the midst of a barbarous people, having seen no possible exam∣ple of the operation of laws in any country, originat∣ing a plan of religion and policy never equalled by the sages of antiquity, civilizing an extensive empire, and rendering religion and government subservient to the general happiness of mankind, there is no danger that we grow too warm in his praise, or pronounce too high an eulogium on his character. Had such a ge∣nius appeared in Greece or Rome, he had been the subject of universal admiration; had he arisen in the favourite land of Turkey, his praises had filled a thousand pages in the diffusive writings of Voltaire.</P>

<HEAD>THE VISION OF COLUMBUS. BOOK IV.</HEAD>
<L>IN one dark age, beneath a single hand,</L>
<L>Thus rose an empire in the savage land.</L>
<L>Her golden seats, with following years, increase,</L>
<L>Her growing nations spread the walks of peace,</L>
<L>Her sacred rites display the purest plan,</L>
<L>That e'er adorn'd the unguided mind of man.</L>
<L>Yet all the pomp, the extended climes unfold,</L>
<L>The fields of verdure and the towers of gold,</L>
<L>Those works of peace, and sovereign scenes of state,</L>
<L>In short-lived glory, hasten to their fate.</L>
<L>Thy followers, rushing like an angry flood,</L>
<L>Shall whelm the fields and stain the shrines in blood;</L>
<L>Nor thou, Las Casas, best of men, shalt stay</L>
<L>The ravening legions from their guardless prey.</L>
<L>Oh! hapless prelate, hero, saint and sage,</L>
<L>Doom'd with hard guilt a fruitless war to wage,</L>
<L>To see, with grief (thy life of virtues run)</L>
<L>A realm unpeopled and a world undone.</L>
<L>While impious Valverde, mock of priesthood, stands,</L>
<L>Guilt in his heart, the gospel in his hands,</L>

<L>And thou, brave Gasca, with thy virtuous train,</L>
<L>Shalt lift the sword and urge thy power in vain;</L>
<L>Vain, the late task, the sinking land to save,</L>
<L>Or call her slaughter'd millions from the grave.</L>
<L>The Seraph spoke. Columbus, with a sigh,</L>
<L>Cast o'er the hapless climes his moisten'd eye,</L>
<L>And thus return'd: Oh, hide me in the tomb;</L>
<L>Why should I live to view the impending doom?</L>
<L>If such dread scenes the scheme of heaven compose,</L>
<L>And virtuous toils induce redoubled woes,</L>
<L>Unfold no more; but grant a kind release,</L>
<L>Give me, 'tis all I ask, to rest in peace.</L>
<L>Thy soul shall rest in peace, the Power rejoin'd▪</L>
<L>Ere these conflicting shades involve mankind:</L>
<L>But nobler views shall first thy mind engage,</L>
<L>Beyond the bounds of this destructive age;</L>
<L>Where happier fruits of thy unwearied toil,</L>
<L>Thro' future years, and other empires, smile.</L>
<L>Europe's contending realms shall soon behold</L>

The rising of sand-banks, which are perpetually increasing along the shores of Virginia and the Carolinas—the layers of sea-shells and pieces of wood, which are found at the depth of forty or fifty feet below the surface, at the distance of a hundred miles from the sea, in the middle and southern States—the level and uniform ap∣pearance of the country, from New-Jersey to East-Florida—and the vast cavity which appears to have been scooped out of the earth, to form the gulph of Mexico, are circumstances which establish the above as an undoubted fact. It is evident, that, not only the island of Newfoundland, Cape-Cod, &amp;c. but the greater part of the settled country, from the river Delaware to Cape St. Augustine, is an accretion of earth worn off from the Isthmus of Darien, by that strong current of water which follows the trade winds; and, meet∣ing the obstruction of the Isthmus, takes a northern direction and sweeps the coast, as far as the river St. Laurence.</NOTE> and raised the extended clime;</L>

<L>COLUMBUS hail'd them with a father's smile,</L>
<L>Fruits of his cares and children of his toil;</L>
<L>With tears of joy, while still his eyes descried</L>
<L>Their course adventurous o'er the distant tide.</L>
<L>Thus, when o'er deluged earth her Seraph stood,</L>
<L>The tost ark bounding on the shoreless flood,</L>
<L>The sacred treasure claim'd his guardian view,</L>
<L>While climes unnoticed in the wave withdrew.</L>
<L>He saw the squadrons reach the rising strand,</L>
<L>Leap from the wave and share the joyous land;</L>
<L>Receding forests yield the heroes room,</L>
<L>And opening wilds with fields and gardens bloom.</L>
<L>Fill'd with the glance extatic, all his soul</L>
<L>Now seems unbounded with the scene to roll,</L>
<L>And now, impatient, with retorted eye,</L>
<L>Perceives his station in another sky.</L>
<L>Waft me, O winged Angel, waft me o'er,</L>
<L>With those blest heroes, to the happy shore▪</L>
<L>There let me live and die—but all appears</L>

<L>THUS view'd the sage. When, lo, in eastern skies,</L>

<L>Bright o'er the scenes of state, a golden throne,</L>
<L>Instarr'd with gems and hung with purple, shone.</L>
<L>Great Louis there, the pride of monarchs, sate,</L>
<L>And fleets and moving armies round him wait;</L>
<L>O'er western shores extend his ardent eyes,</L>
<L>Thro' glorious toils where struggling nations rise;</L>
<L>Each virtuous deed, each new illustrious name,</L>
<L>Wakes in his soul the living light of fame.</L>
<L>He sees the liberal, universal cause,</L>
<L>That wondering worlds in still attention draws;</L>
<L>And marks, beyond, through western walks of day,</L>
<L>Where midnight suns their happier beams display,</L>
<L>What sires of unborn nations claim their birth,</L>
<L>And ask their empires in that waste of earth.</L>
<L>Then o'er the eastern world he turn'd his eye;</L>
<L>Where, sunk in slavery hapless kingdoms lie;</L>
<L>Saw realms exhausted to enrich a throne,</L>
<L>Their fruits untasted and their rights unknown:</L>

<P>The vision suspended. Causes of the slow progress of Science and its frequent interruptions. Its ancient compared with its modern establishment. Consequen∣ces of the latter. Causes of the apparent uncertainty in matters of theology. Superstition built on the pas∣sions; scepticism on the reasoning power.

<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Since finishing the Poem (the whole of which, except a small part of the seventh Book, was written previous to the conclusion of the late war) the Author is happy to find that his general ideas, res∣pecting the future progress and final perfection of human society, are supported by those of so respectable a Character as Dr. Price. In his Observations on the Importance of the American Revolution, he remarks,
<Q>That Reason, as well as Tradition and Revelation, lead us to expect that a more improved and happy state of hu∣man affairs will take place before the final consummation of all things. The world has been hitherto gradually improving; light and knowledge have been gaining ground, and human life at present, compared with what it <HI>once</HI> was, is much the same that a youth approaching to manhood is, compared with an in∣fant.</Q></P>
<P>It has long been the opinion of the Author, that such a state of peace and happiness as is foretold in scripture and commonly called the millennial period, may be rationally expected to be introduced without a miracle. <HI>Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> nisi dignus vindice nodus,</HI> is a maxim, as useful to a Christian Philosopher as to a Heathen Poet. Although, from the history of mankind, it appears, that the pro∣gress of improvement has be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ow and often interrupted, yet it gives pleasure to observe the causes of these interruptions, and to discern the end they were designed in the course of Providence to answer, in accelerating the same events, which they seemed for a∣while to retard. The state of the arts among the ancients, viewed with reference to the event under consideration, was faulty or ra∣ther unfortunate in two particulars; <HI>first,</HI> in their comparative es∣timation; and <HI>secondly,</HI> in their not flourishing in more than one nation at a time. These circumstances were highly favourable to the exertions of individual genius, and may be assigned both as causes of the universal destruction of the arts by the Gothic conquest, and as reasons why we should not greatly lament that destruction. From the situation of mankind in the days of ancient literature, it was natural that those arts which depend on the imagination, such as Architecture, Statuary, Painting, Eloquence and Poetry, should claim the highest rank in the estimation of a people. In several, and perhaps all of these, the ancients remain unrivaled. But these are not the arts which tend greatly to the general improve∣ment of mankind. The man, who in those days could have ascer∣tained the true figure of the earth, would have rendered more ser∣vice to the world, than he that could originate a heaven and fill it with all the Gods of Homer; and had the expences of the Egyptian pyramids been employed in furnishing fleets of discovery, to be sent out of the Mediterranian, the civilized world would probably never have been ov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrun by Barbarians. But the sciences of Ge∣ography, Navigation and Commerce, with all their consequential improvements in natural philosophy and humanity, could not, from the nature of things, be objects of great encouragement or enter∣prize among the ancients. They therefore turned their attention to the cultivation of arts more striking to the senses; such as re∣quire the strongest exertion of the human genius, and would be en∣titled to the highest rank in any age of universal refinement. As these arts were adapted to gratify the vanity of a prince, to fire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ambition of a hero, or to gain a point in a popular assembly▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were carried to a degree of perfection, which prevented their being relished or understood by barbarians. The literature of the world therefore descended with the line of conquest from one nation to another, till the whole was swallowed up in the Roman Empire. There its tendency was to inspire a contempt for nations less civil∣ized, and to induce the Romans to consider all mankind as the objects of their insult, and all countries as the scenes of their mili∣tary parade. These circumstances, through a course of ages, pre∣pared and finally opened a scene of wretchedness, at which the hu∣man mind has been taught to shudder, but it was wisely calculated to reduce mankind to a situation, capable of commencing regular and extensive improvements. And, however novel the sentiment may appear, yet the Author will venture to assert, that, as to the pros∣pect of universal civilization, mankind were in a much more eligi∣ble situation in the time of Charlemagne than they were in the days of Augustus. The final destruction of the Roman empire left the nations of Europe in circumstances similar to each other; and their consequent rivalship prevented any disproportionate refinement from appearing in any particular region. The seeds of govern∣ment, firmly rooted in the principles of the feudal system, laid the foundation of that balance of Power, which discourages the Caesars and Alexanders of mankind from attempting the conquest of the world.</P>
<P>It seems necessary, that the arrangement of events in civilizing the world should be in the following order. <HI>First,</HI> all parts of it must be considerably peopled; <HI>secondly,</HI> the different nations must be known to each other; and <HI>thirdly,</HI> their imaginary wants must be increased, in order to inspire a passion for commerce. The first of these objects, was probably not accomplished till a late period. The second, for three centuries past, has been greatly accelerated, but is now very far from being completely obtained. The third is al∣ways a necessary consequence of the two former. The spirit of commerce is happily calculated by the Author of wisdom to open an amicable intercourse between all countries, to soften the horrors of war, to enlarge the field of science and speculation, and to assi∣milate the manners, feelings and languages of all nations. This leading principle, in its remoter consequences, will produce a thou∣sand advantages in favour of government and legislation, give Pa∣triotism the air of Philanthropy, induce all men to regard each oth∣er as brethren and friends, eradicate all kinds of literary, religious and political superstition, prepare the minds of all mankind for the rational reception of moral and religious truth, and finally evince that such a system of Providence, as appears in the unfolding of these events, is the best possible system to produce the happiness of creatures. I conceive it is no objection to this plan, that the pro∣gress has hitherto been slow; when we consider the vast magnitude of the object, the obstructions to be removed, and the great length of time that will probably be taken to accomplish it. To resume the comparison of Doctor Price, perhaps the world can hardly be said as yet to be "approaching to manhood"; probably we are rather rising out of infancy; we have not yet been able to wander over the whole house and observe upon the furniture. It is possible that some considerable revolutions are yet to happen, before the progress will be entirely free from embarrasments. But the gener∣al system appears so rational and complete, that it furnishes a new source of satisfaction, in contemplating the apparent dispensations of Heaven.</P>
<P>The author first ventured upon these ideas, in the course of the Poem, with all the timidity of youth; determining not to risk a se∣rious illustration of the sentiment in prose. But finding that a theo∣ry so pleasing to himself has not been unnoticed by others, he feels a greater confidence in the subject, and hopes the importance of it will apologize to the reader for so lengthy a note.</P></NOTE>And one wide interest sways the peaceful race.</L>
