<HEAD>The First Question.</HEAD>
<P>O<HI>H Wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver me from the Wrath to come? for my sins are many, and my iniqui∣ties are great; and if the Lord should deal with me according to his Justice and my De∣serts, my Portion must needs be in the Lake of Fire with the Devil and his Angels. For the Scripture pronounceth every man Cursed that continueth not in all things Written in the</HI> Book <HI>of the</HI> Law, <HI>to do them,</HI> Gal.3.10. <HI>Shew me therefore (I beseech you) shew me what course to take, to come out of this misery; shew me the way how to get the Pardon of my sins, and the favour of God, I care for nothing but this, neither is there any thing in the World, that I do desire in comparison of this.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>This is that (indeed) which of all other
<PB N="2" REF="000547_0002_0FA6B65E35C25828"/>
things doth most concern us: For upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> pardon of our Sins, and Peace with God, de∣pends all Solid Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> while we are here, and the Eternal Salvation of our most precious Souls hereafter. And therefore for our better, both Direction and Consolation in this behalf, let us take notice of this that follows:</P>
<P>There is a way for men to come out of the misery of sin, and to obtain and enjoy the Mercy and favour of Almighty God, and that is <HI>Faith in Christ:</HI> this is the way, and there is none but this; neither is there any thing in the World, that can help us to the Pardon of our Sins, to the Love of God, and the Salvation of our Souls, but only <HI>Faith in the Lord Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>That this is the way, is apparent enough by the Answer which was given by <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas Act.</HI> 16.31. for when the Keeper of the Prison cried out with trembling, <HI>Sirs what must I do to be saved?</HI> they made him this answer, <HI>belie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved.</HI> The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is in Christ sufficiency enough for the obtain∣ing of our Pardon, and the procuring of our Peace; and there is in Faith Ability enough to make us partakers of Christs sufficiency. Christ is the only way whereby we come unto etern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Life, and Faith is the only way whereby w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> come to be partakers of Christ; by Faith w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> come unto him, and through him unto God.</P>
<P>And that we may the better know, that the
<PB N="3" REF="000547_0002_0FA6B65E35C25828"/>
is in Christ sufficiency enough for the Pardon of our Sins, and the salvation of our Souls, let us consider a little, both who Christ is, and also what he hath done for the working out of our deliverance, and the procuring of our Peace.</P>
<P>The Lord Jesus Christ is the <HI>E</HI>ternal Son of God, who pitying that sinful and miserable con∣dition, whereinto we are all brought by the dis∣obedience of our first Parent, undertook to Mediate the matter betwixt God and us, and to reconcile us again unto God. For the better effecting of which great work. He came down from Heaven, and was Incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and was made Man yea in all things like unto other men, save only in sin, that so be might the better make us free from all sin. Being thus found in the fashion as a Man, he set himself in our stead, ond for us Men, and for our Salvation, he became obe∣dient unto Death, even the Death of the Cross. And by his Obedience and Death he hath per∣fectly alone by himself accomplished whatever was requisite for our Salvation.</P>
<P>The wretchedness of our condition is briefly this: We all like Sheep have gone astray, nei∣ther have we only omitted those Duties, which the Law requires, but we have also committed those Evils, which the Law forbids; and as the want of Righteousness doth exclude us from the favour of God, and the Kingdom of Hea∣ven:
<PB N="4" REF="000547_0003_0FA6B663E5608EC8"/>
so the guiltiness of sin doth expose us to the wrath of God, and the Damnation of Hell. But the Lord Jesus Christ hath fulfilled all Righteousness. For in his Life he performed as much obedience, as the Law in rigor could exact; and by suffering Death upon the Cross, he underwent as much Punishment as could be required of Sinners, in the severity of Justice: and so by his Death and Obedience hath he provided against our double Misery. For by his sufferings upon the Cross, the Justice of God is satisfied, and his Wrath appeased; and by his Obedience the Law is fulfilled, and we are ac∣cepted. And as by his Death comes the par∣don of sin, and deliverance from wrath, so by his Obedience comes the imputation of Righ∣teousness, and life Everlasting. All which as they were done in our Nature, so they were done for us, and in our behalf, he stood in the place of Sinners, that we might be numbred a∣mong the Righteous; he took our sins upon him, that he might put his Obedience upon us; the chastisement of our Peace was upon him, that with his stripes we may be healed; he was made a Curse for us, that he might Redeem us from it; he was made sin for us, that knew no sin, that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him: <HI>2 Cor.</HI> 5.22.</P>
<P>And the better to assure us that by his Death upon the Cross, there was paid a price sufficient
<PB N="5" REF="000547_0003_0FA6B663E5608EC8"/>
enough for the procuring of our Pardon, He arose again from the dead, which he could not have done, if the Justice of God had not been satisfied to the very full in every particular. For as sin is the sting of Death, and the only thing that makes Death terrible, so it is the strength of Death, and it is that only that doth give Death dominion over us: Sin is the Lock, and Bar, and Bolt, that makes fast the Gates of Death; and as the Door cannot be opened to let out a Prisoner, till the Bar be removed; so there is no escaping from Death, until sin be taken out of the way. Christ therefore by Rising from the Dead hath mightily declared unto us, that he hath paid the utmost farthing of our Debts, and that by his Death he hath fully satisfied the Justice of God. So that now by vertue of his Sufferings, the greatest sins are made pardonable, and there is a way set open for the worst of sinners, both to Grace and Glory. I say even for the worst sinners. There is no man now that can deny himself to be capable of Grace; there are too many, who from the greatness of Gods Mercy, do without any cause prusume to sin; but there is no man, who from the heinousness of his sins hath any just cause to despair of Mercy: for though our sins be many, yet the mercies of God be more; though they be great, yet his Mercies are above them; he is rich in Mercy,
<PB N="6" REF="000547_0004_0FA6B664475B31A8"/>
yea, his Mercy is Infinite, so that though he hath spent much Mercy already upon our Fore∣fathers, yet he hath Mercy enough in store for us also; with him there is plenty of Forgive∣ness, and his Mercy endureth for ever: And the Merits of Christ are of the same Nature for he is Mighty to save, and he is the same for e∣ver; and though the Riches of these Merits of Christ, there is a way set open, even for the worst sinners, to become partakers of the Riches of the Mercies of God. Now if any Man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous, and he is the propitiation for our sins, <HI>&amp;c. I Joh.</HI> 2, 1, 2. And though the time of his abode upon earth in the days of his Flesh were but short, though his sufferings were but for a season; yet such was and is the dignity of his Person (being the Eternal Son of God) that his Sufferings and Obedience are infinitely Meritorious, and his Blood is able to cleanse us from all Unrighteousness: so that we may well say with the Apostle, <HI>Who is be that condemneth? It is Christ that Dyed, or rather who is risen again, and now maketh Inter∣cession for us, Rom.</HI> 8. 33, 34. But let no Man turn this Doctrine of Comfort to a liberty of sinning: against the greatest sins there is hopes an Christ for penitent Believers. But because there is Mercy with God, shall we therefore go on in sin? God forbid: There is Mercy with
<PB N="7" REF="000547_0004_0FA6B664475B31A8"/>
him, and therefore he must be Feared. But if any Man shall presume to sin, because there is Mercy with God, through Jesus Christ; in stead of Mercy, that man is like to meet with nothing but Justice: for as merciful as God is, and as All-sufficient as the Death of Christ is, there is no Mercy for such as go on still in their wickedness.</P>
<P>And thus you see that Christ is mighty enough to save us from all our Sins, and to re∣concile us unto God: now that we may have benefit by this sufficiency of Christ, we must lay hold upon it by a lively Faith. This is that which Unites us unto Christ, and makes us one with him; this is that which gives us Interest in him, and makes us partakers of his Merits; this makes the Death and Obedience of Christ as verily our own, and as effectual for the Pardon of our Sins, as the Salvation of our Souls, and if they had been performed by our very selves. So that if we do-truly believe in the Lord Jesus, then is God well pleased with us for his sake, and by Vertue of his Merits, being made ours by Faith, our Sins are Pardon∣ed, and our Souls and Bodies shall be Eternally saved. And so much the Scripture doth plainly testifie in several places. As <HI>Joh.</HI> 3. 16. God so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that <HI>Whosoever believe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han him should not Perish, but have Life Everlasting.</HI> And again
<PB N="8" REF="000547_0005_0FA6B667906DA0A0"/>
<HI>Act.</HI> 10. 43. <HI>Through his Name, whosoever belie∣veth in him, shall have remission of Sins (be they never so many, never so hainous)</HI> And again, <HI>Act.</HI> 13. 38, 39. <HI>Be it known unto you, that through this Man is Preached unto you the Forgive∣ness of Sins, and by him all that believe are Justifi∣ed, from all those things, from which they could not be justified by the Law of</HI> Moses. By the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> we could never have been acquitted ei∣ther from the guiltiness of Sin, or from the wrath of God: But we are delivered from both, by Faith in Christ; for by it we obtain the for∣giveness of our Sins and the Salvation of our Souls.</P>
<P>And thus it is manifest, <HI>That Christ is the way by which we are to obtain the Pardon of Sin, and Peace with God; and that Faith is the way whereby we are made Partakers of the Merits of Christ for our Justification and Salvation.</HI> Pro∣ceed we now in a word, to shew that nothing but Christ can reconcile us unto God, and that nothing but Faith can make us partakers of Christ for our reconciliation.</P>
<P>There is no way whereby to come unto God but only Christ: It is only in Christ that God is well pleased; neither is there salvation in any other. For there is none other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby we must be saved, <HI>Act.</HI> 4. 12. Neither is there any o∣ther means on our part, whereby to receive
<PB N="9" REF="000547_0005_0FA6B667906DA0A0"/>
Christ, but only Faith, and yet unless we do receive him, we get no benefit by him; and therefore unless we do believe in him, we shall perish in our sins. And to this purpose speakes our Saviour, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3. 36. <HI>He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting Life; and he that believeth not the Son, shall not see Life, but the Wrath of God abideth on him.</HI> See the sum of all this, in that place of St. <HI>John, I Epist.</HI> 11. 12, and 13. <HI>ver∣ses.</HI> God hath given to us Eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son. He that hath the Son, hath Life; and he that hath not the Son, hath not Life. These things have I written to you, that believe in the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have Eternal Life, and that ye may believe in the Name of the Son of God. By which place it is plain, that there is a way to Life; that Christ is the way to it; that Life is so in him, that it is in no other but him; that it is so in him, that by believing in him, we obtain Life; and that it is so in him, that without believing in him, we get no benefit at all by him. And thus you have the Truth of the former Answer enlarged and that confirm∣ed according to its several Branches; by which it is manifest, that <HI>Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and nothing else but only Faith in him,</HI> can help us to the pardon of sin, the love of God, and the salvation of our souls.</P>
<P>Hereupon it may be thus applyed.</P>

<HEAD>The Second Question.</HEAD>
<P>I<HI>F I cannot obtain the pardon of my sins, and the favour of God, without Faith in Christ, I doubt my condition is woful, and that I am yet in my sins, and liable into Wrath. For I fear I have not this Faith in Christ, and that I do not as yet believe in him. Shew me therefore (I pray you) how I may be comforted against this fear, and how I may know whether I do believe in Christ, yea or no.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>Doubtless if we do not believe in Christ, our condition is woful: for there is no salvation in any other; and without Faith in him, we can get no benefit by him, but we are in our sins, and the obligation unto wrath is in full power and force against us. For though the Ransom which Christ paied by his Death upon the Cross, be a Ransome abundantly sufficient for the sins of the whole World; yet the benefit of that Death of his is bestowed on none, but upon such conditions as God himself pleaseth: which conditions for such as be of years, are Faith and Repentance; which if we want, we shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sure to perish in our sins, not out of any de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ct in Christ, but only because we want those conditions, whereby we came to have interest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him, and to be partakers of his Merits. Now, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we may the better know whether we have his Faith in us, yea or no (and so neither be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eceived with vain hopes) nor yet discomforted with false fears) consider this which follows,
<PB N="11" REF="000547_0006_0FA6B668CCDFO758"/>
and see what answer you can make to these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣veral demands.</P>
<P>Are you sensible of the misery wherein <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are by reason of your sins? And do you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that you need a Saviour? Do you know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is the Saviour of the World? Do you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in some good measure who Christ is, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he hath done for us, and what are the bene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> that are to be had by him? Do you know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a necessity there is of having of him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a misery it is to be without him, and what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must do, if we would have any benefit in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. And do you verily believe that Christ Jesus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> none but he, is the Saviour of the World, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that he hath both done and suffered, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ptures Testifie of him? Do you verily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that there is no way to Heaven but Christ, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there is no part to be had in him, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouncing all other Lords, and all other Sav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and by adhering wholly unto him for all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> consolation and salvation? And do you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> desire from the Heart to be made parta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Christ? And do your sincerely endeavo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> accept of him, and to embrace him? And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you be content for his sake to forsake all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and to undergo any misery, rather then to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with him? Can you be content to take him we say) <HI>For better or worse,</HI> and not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for your Jesus, to save you from your sins, also for your Lord, to command and dispose
<PB N="12" REF="000547_0007_0FA6B669882D8D38"/>
you at his pleasure? And is it your care to know his Will? And is it your endeavour to yield him an Universal Obedience? And is it your pra∣ctice in Obedience unto him, to exercise your self to keep a Conscience void of offence, both toward God and toward Men, and constantly, and Conscionably to deny all ungodliness and Worldly Lusts, and to live godly, and righte∣ously, and soberly in this present World? Do You thus accept of Christ, and submit unto him? Nay, <HI>It is your hearty desire and unfam∣ed endeavour so to do?</HI> Then you may be sure that you have some degrees of true Faith in Je∣sus Christ, and therefore that Christ is yours, that God is yours, that all is yours. For this is such a qualification as hath the promise, both of the Life that now is, and also of that, that is to come.</P>
<P>By these questions we may examine our con∣dition. For after this manner is Faith wrought in us; such are the preparatives, such is the nature, and such are the effects of a true, Faith, as are implied in these Questions; so that if we can in some good measure make un∣derstanding and affectionate answer to them all, then we may be sure that we have a true Faith, in Christ: But if either we know him not, or desire not to accept of him, or care not to obey him, we have then cause to think that we do not believe in him; and if we think otherwise,
<PB N="13" REF="000547_0007_0FA6B669882D8D38"/>
we do but deceive our own souls.</P>
<P>Now if upon examination had, we find that we want Faith, we must be diligent in using the means whereby to get it, which by reading and hearing of the Word of God, and con∣ferring about it. <HI>For Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word.</HI> If we find that we have this Faith, we must be careful to keep it, and so increase it, by the Word, by the Sacra∣ments, and by Prayer.</P>

I do in some measure know who Christ is, and I do believe he is a Saviour All-sufficient, and that there is no other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay to Salvation, but him, and that whosoever be∣lieveth in him shall not perish: And I my self would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> believe in him: But how may I know that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight to believe in him, and that the invitati∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Faith do concern me?

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">

<P>To this end let a Man examine himself by the Law of God. For by the Law is the knowledge of sin. And let him duly think upon that fearful curse of God, whereunto e∣very the least sin doth make us liable. Let him diligently consider, how ugly and loath∣some sin doth make us in the sight of God, and what a fearful thing it is to be deprived of the Love of God, and the joyes of Heaven, and what a misery it is to be exposed to the Wrath of God, and the Torments of Hell. Let him seriously ponder what a misery it is to lose the Soul. Let him throughly weight the Na∣ture of Eternity, and the strictness of that Ac∣count that is to come; and the severity of that
<PB N="16" REF="000547_0009_0FA6B66B0A81ED18"/>
Sentence, which in that last and dreadful Day shall be pronounced upon all impenitent sin∣ners, when they shall be adjudged to that ever∣lasting Fire, which is prepared for the Devil and his Angels. All these are of singular use to wound our souls, and to effect our hearts with sorrow for our sins. It is the Law that makes way for the Gospel: for thus <HI>John</HI> the Baptist by denouncing the Judgments of God upon wicked courses, prepared the way for our blessed Saviour. But especially let him con∣sider, how great things God hath done for him. For as there is no greater obligation to obedience, than the loving-kindness of the Lord so there is no thing that doth more aggravate our sins, and so consequently our misery; and therefore nothing that can tend more to the breaking of the heart, than the consideration of the bounty and long-suffering of God to us∣wards. And this plainly appears by that course which the Prophet <HI>Nathan,</HI> at the Lords ap∣pointment took with <HI>David, 2 Sam.</HI> 12. for by setting before his eyes Gods many and wonder∣ful mercies vouchsafed, and his own extream in∣gratitude and ill requital of so great goodness, he was constrained to cry out with shame and sorrow, <HI>I have sinned against the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>And amongst all the mercies of God, there is none that doth more deserve to take up all our thoughts, than that departure of Christ, which
<PB N="17" REF="000547_0009_0FA6B66B0A81ED18"/>
he accomplished at <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> neither is there any thing that doth more tend, either to pre∣serve us from sin, or to humble us for our fail∣ings, than the death of our Saviour.</P>
<P>For, suppose the Lord Jesus should present himself unto us, when we are about to commit any sin, or after we have done it, as he was hanging upon the Cross, with his Sides Scour∣ged, his Face Buffeted, his Hands and Feet Nailed, his Head Crowned with Thorns, his very Heart pierced, his whole Body upon the Rack, and Trickling down with Drops of Blood, speaking unto us after this or the like manner. <HI>Behold, if ever sorrows were like unto my sorrows; and yet all this was but the punish∣ment of thy sins. It is thy sins that have brought me to all these Torments, and canst thou delight in that which was the cause of such misery? All this have I done for thy good, and is this the requital of my Love? I have born thy sins, that thou mightest be eased, mine hands were bound, that thine might be freed; my Sides were Scourged, that thine might be spared; my Cheeks were Buffeted, that thine might be Kist; my Head was Crowned with Thorns, that thine might be Crowned with Glory; and is this thy kindness to thy Friend, thus to re∣turn me hatred for my good-will? Hast thou not put me to pains enough already, but that thou must Rake in my Wounds, and make a sport of my misery? or if thou wilt not pity me, yet pity thy self. For
<PB N="18" REF="000547_0010_0FA6B66C5D190538"/>
can that be light to thee, which cost me so heavy? or shalt thou escape the Cup, that art a sinner, when my Beloved Father would not spare me that was but a Surety.</HI></P>
<P>Suppose (I say) that the Lord Jesus should present himself and speak unto us, after this or the like manner; would not such a sight make our Bowels to yern, and such Words cut us to they very heart? Doubtless it were enough to make the dryest eyes to wish for Tears of Blood, and the hardest heart of the most obstinate Sin∣ner, to become in the midst of his Body like melting Wax, thus to hear and look upon him whom they have pierced: yea it is impossible for any man to think on this, and to go on in sin, but such as could be content to Crucifie a∣gain the Lord of Glory.</P>
<P>And thus you see, what are the chiefest helps to Humiliation, and by what means our Hearts may be brought to be deeply affected with sor∣row for our sins.</P>

<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>True it is, that Sorrow for Sin makes ready an Heart prepared for the Lord; and as usu∣ally in the course of Nature, there is no Birth without some pain. So in the work of Grace there is no regeneration, (that of Infants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Baptism excepted) without some Sorrow. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as there are Degrees of pain in the Natur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Birth: So in the Degrees of Spiritual Birth there are Degres of Sorrow. Some Women have a quick dispatch, others have a more te∣dious Travel: and so it is in the New Birth, all are not pained alike. Some there be that go mourning all the day long, yea, day after day, whereas unto others, heaviness indures, but as it were for a night, and joy cometh in the morning. We must know therefore, and that for our comfort that it is not the quantity but the quality of Sorrow, that God looks af∣ter; neither matters it so much, how great our Sorrow be, as how true it is.</P>
<P>If a Youth, upon due examination be found fit for the University, his Tutor never demand how long he hath been at School, how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

he hath been dealt withal, how often he hath been Whipt, before he could come to that per∣fection; all that he looks after is, whether or no he be fit to be admitted: So it fares with us; the Law is our School-master to bring us unto Christ; and this it doth, partly by discovering unto us our sins, whereby we see that we need a Saviour: and partly by threatning of us with the Curse, whereby we are made more careful to look our after this Saviour, and more willing to accept of him, and for our own ease to sub∣mit unto him, when once we have found him.</P>

Consider there∣fore with your self, had you ever such a sight and sorrow for your sins, as made you weary of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em, and out of love with them, and willing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be eased <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, and desirous of Interest in Christ, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ady to accept of Christ upon any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rms rather than to go without him? is it your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ief that you cannot be more sorrowful, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not you desire as much to be kept from sin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the time to come, as to have all that par∣doned
<PB N="21" REF="000547_0011_0FA6B66E77487F10"/>
that is past? Surely, if you stand thus af∣fected, then are you fitted and made ready for Christ; and whether your sorrow were great or little, yet it is a token, that it was a true and a godly sorrow, because it worketh repentance unto Salvation, never to be repented of.</P>

<P>I <HI>Confess that I have been grieved for my sins, and I have been desirous to believe in Christ: but I fear that my Sorrow is not good, nor my Faith sound, because my Obedience is so faulty; for I am not so willing to forsake all my sins, nor so careful to yield Christ Obedience, as I should be; or if I am wil∣ling so to do, yet mine infirmities and my failings are such, and so many, that I fear my Sorrow and my Faith, are not such as they ought to be.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>Certain it is, that sorrow for sin will nothing avail us, without amendment of Life; the wicked must forsake his wayes, if he expect par∣don, <HI>Isa.</HI> 55. 7. <HI>And it is he that confesseth his sins, and forsaketh them, that shall find Mercy, Prov.</HI> 28. 13. If we willingly allow our selves in the practice of any thing displeasing unto God, our condition is dangerous. If we say that we abide in Christ, we must walk as he walked, or else we deceive our own Souls, <HI>I Joh</HI> 2 6. <HI>If we say that we have fellowship with God,

and yet walk in Darkness, we Lye, and the Truth is not in us, I Joh.</HI> 1. 6. And if it be not our Study and Exercise to yield Christ an Universal Obedience, our, Faith is but Presumption, our Peace is but Security, our Hopes are but Sha∣dows, and our Expectation will perish.</P>
<P>But if we have an hearty desire, and a sincere endeavour in all things to live Honestly, we may not from our failings and imperfections presently conclude that we are not sanctified at all, that we have no Faith, no Interest in Christ, no Love of God in us. For perfection is not to be attained unto, while we be in the Body; but sincerity is that which may be had, and af∣fords unto us matter of Comfort; for the Lord loves them that follow after Righteousness, <HI>Pro.</HI> 15. 9. And they whose sincere desire and en∣deavour it is to have respect to all the Com∣mandments, are accepted of him. If it be our unfeigned desire, study and endeavour, in obe∣dience unto Christ, to do whatsoever he com∣mandeth; if it be our care to cleanse our selves from all filthiness both of flesh and spirit, and to perfect Holiness in the fear of God, and not wickedly to depart from him in any thing: I say, if it be our unfeigned desire, study and endeavour so to do, we may safely conclude, notwithstanding all our imperfections, that our sorrow is good, and our Faith sound, and that our sins are pardoned, and our service is accep∣ted
<PB N="23" REF="000547_0012_0FA6B66EE0DCEB08"/>
and our souls shall be saved. For in Gods ac∣count and acceptation, that goes for a clean life, which is not stained with wilful pollutions, and whose obedience is extended to the utmost of his knowledge, and hath withal a purpose to attend what God shall hereafter make him know to be sinful; to that Man is allowed the opinion of gracious.</P>

Nevertheless there is comfort in God against this fear also; yea, <HI>this very fear of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> away</HI> hath in it matter of Consolation, for it is a means to keep us from departing from God, <HI>Jer.</HI> 32. 40. <HI>And I will make an everlasting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</HI></P>
<P>Many there be that having begun well, do yet at length grow weary of well-doing, and so lose what they have done; and therefore let him that thinketh that he standeth, take heed lest he fall: But yet let not our Hearts be troubled let us not be dismay'd with fear, for the perse∣verance of such as are <HI>Justified and Sanctified in Deed and in Truth,</HI> is certain, and the Founda∣tion of God standeth sure, the Lord knoweth who are his, and he knoweth how to deliver them out of Temptation.

Shew me therefore, I pray you, how I may be comforted against this Fear, and how I may be enabled to Wade
<PB N="32" REF="000547_0017_0FA6B674CB008358"/>
through all with Christian Patience?</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>True it is, that the crosses and troubles which Men shall meer withal in the way to Heaven, are matters of offence, and unto some they are very powerful, turning them back from the hope laid before them, to the embracing of this present World. But if we would think upon things aright, in the midst of Misery; we should have comforts enough to refresh our Souls. Neither is there any trouble that can befal us, in the midst of which they have not matter of strong consolation, <HI>now being justified by Faith, are at peace with God, through Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Now to the end that we may be the better comforted against all crosses, let us make use of these few considerations following:</P>
<P N="1">1. Consider that it is no new or strange thing to be exercised with afflictions; neither are crosses and troubles of themselves an Ar∣gument of Gods hatred, but rather a token of his love, and a witness of our Adoption, if we bear them patiently, and make good use of them. There is not any affliction Incident to the nature of Man, which some one or o∣ther, even of Gods own dear Servants and Children, have not been exercised withal. Look upon <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> and <HI>Joseph</HI> and <HI>Job,</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> and all that cloud of Witnesses made mention of, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. and we shall find
<PB N="33" REF="000547_0017_0FA6B674CB008358"/>
that through many afflictions, they all entred into the Kingdom of God. Nay, look upon the Captain of our Salvation, and we shall find that even he himself was made perfect through sufferings, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.10. and this must needs be a special means to enable us to bear all with the greater patience, when we shall know and con∣sider, that though our affliction be for number many, and for nature grievous, yet they are but the measure of our Betters.</P>
<P N="2">2. Consider that God hath promised never to leave us nor forsake us, <HI>Heb.</HI> 13. 5. and his presence alone is support sufficient even in the worst of miseries. How can <HI>Jacob</HI> be afraid to go down into <HI>Egypt,</HI> when God himself hath said, he will go with him? <HI>Gen.</HI> 46. 34. God hath made the like promise unto us, and there∣fore if he bid us go into troubles; if he com∣mand us to walk through the Valley of the shadow of Death, yet we need fear no evil, as long as he is with us; for <HI>if God be with us, who can be against us?</HI> Rom.8.31.</P>
<P N="3">3. Consider, that unto such as do believe in Christ, the nature of afflictions is wholly al∣tered; for their sting is pull'd out, and their bitterness is allay'd, they may favour of Anger, of Wrath they do not: Crosses they may be, Curses they are not: they may b<HI>e</HI> Chastise∣ments for our Correction, but they are not Judgments for our Confusion. For Christ
<PB N="34" REF="000547_0018_0FA6B67592E54F90"/>
hath suffered whatever Wrath was due unto us by reason of our sins; and if we be once re∣conciled unto God by Faith in Christ, there is more ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er of comfort in the assurance of his love, than there can be of dejection in the greatest trouble.</P>
<P N="4">4. Consider that God intends nothing but good unto us, in his sharpest dealings with us: for it is all to humble us, and to prove us, and to do us good at our latter end; all is for our profit, that we may be partakers of his Holi∣ness. For hereby he reforms what hath been amiss in us in times past; <HI>hereby our iniquity shall be purged, and this is the fruit, to take away our sin,</HI> Isai.27.9.</P>
<P>Hereby he prevents sin in us for the time to come, as he did <HI>Paul,</HI> unto whom there was sent the Messenger of Satan to buffet him, lest he should have been exalted above measure, <HI>2 Cor.</HI> 12.7.</P>
<P>Hereby he doth wean us from the Love of the World and worldly Vanities. As long as all goes well with us, we are ready to say with <HI>Peter, It is good to be here:</HI> but when once we begin to be afflicted, then presently with the Prodigal, our minds are home-wards,</P>
<P>Hereby he deals with us as the Husband-man doth by the Vine, he pares and prunes us, to make us the more fruitful, <HI>Joh.</HI> 15.2.</P>
<P>Hereby he doth exercise our Faith and Pa∣tience,
<PB N="35" REF="000547_0018_0FA6B67592E54F90"/>
and makes trial of our sincerity, as he did by <HI>Job.</HI> And so in this he layes the ground of our greater Glory: for greater afflictions require greater patience; and the greater our patience is, the greater shall be our future hap∣piness.</P>
<P>And the consideration of this must needs be a means to perswade us to Patience: for if we can willingly endure smarting-water for the clearing of our eyes; and bitter Pills, and sharp Lances for the Health of our Bodies: much more ought we to bear with patience the smarting hand of the Almighty God for the health of our Souls. There is no affliction in∣deed joyous for the present, but grievous; but after it worketh the peaceable fruit of Righte∣ousness to such as are exercised thereby, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.11.</P>
<P>Consider that if we do continue faithful un∣to death, we shall receive a Crown of life. And if we do but have an eye to that recompence of reward, we shall easily be drawn, as <HI>Moses</HI> was, to esteem the reproach of Christ greater than the Treasures of <HI>Egypt;</HI> and to chuse ra∣ther to suffer affliction with the People of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.25,26. For the happiness of that King∣dom which is to come, is such, that our blessed Saviour accounts it matter of comfort against all fear whatsoever, as it doth plainly appear by
<PB N="36" REF="000547_0019_0FA6B6765043F0C0"/>
those words of his, <HI>Luk.</HI> 12. 32. <HI>Fear not little flock, for it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.</HI> Where the only Argument that he makes use of for the encouraging of his little Flock, is the hopes of the Kingdom. And again by that place, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.11,12. <HI>Blessed are ye, when Men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you for my Names sake. Rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in Heaven, for so persecu∣ted they the Prophets which were before you.</HI> Wherein our Saviour doth hearten his Disci∣ples against Persecution, only upon this ground, because their reward should be great in Heaven. And surely in St. <HI>Paul's</HI> computation, the pre∣sent affliction is not worthy the speak∣ing of, in regard of that glory that shall be revealed, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 18. neither is there indeed any comparison at all between them; for the one is but a light and momen∣tary affliction, the other is a far more exceed∣ing and eternal weight of Glory, <HI>2 Cor.</HI> 4. 17. So that this goodness of God in the Land of the living, is enough to keep us from fainting under the heaviest Burden; for though our outward Man decay, yet while we have an eye to this joy set before us, our inward Man will be renewed day by day. Fitly therefore is the hope of this happiness, called the <HI>Anchor of the Soul,</HI> and the <HI>Helmet of Salvation;</HI> for by this
<PB N="37" REF="000547_0019_0FA6B6765043F0C0"/>
<HI>Anchor</HI> we are preserved in the deep waters, by this <HI>Helmet</HI> we are protected in the times of danger; and by flying unto this hope, we are sure to find refuge in the day of evil.</P>
<P>And thus we may be comforted against evils present. Now as for those that are yet to come we may thus resolve, <HI>either they shall not come at all:</HI> for God will stand between us and harm, and keep us quiet from fear of evil: without his providence nothing can befal us, and there∣fore nothing shall befal to do us hurt: for he is a God that delighteth in the prosperity of his Servants.</P>
<P>Or if they do come, <HI>yet the Lord will deliver us out of all,</HI> there shall be an end. Enlarge∣ment will come, and he will deliver his People, even because he hath a favour unto them.</P>
<P>And in the mean time, <HI>he will support us in them,</HI> till deliverance do come: and his Grace will be sufficient for us. <HI>For God is faithful, and will not suffer us to be tempted above that we are able: but with the temptation also make away to escape, that we may be able to hear it,</HI> I Cor.10.13.</P>
<P>And <HI>he will also give us benefit by them:</HI> for he maketh all to work together for good to those that love him, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.28. And thus we may be comforted against our fears also. In a word, there's none can know the way to hea∣ven, better than he that dwells there. And therefore which way soever God leads us, it is
<PB N="38" REF="000547_0020_0FA6B676F9FD4A88"/>
safe to follow him. The uneasiness of the way, makes us think that it is the farthest way about; but the Lord knows it is the next way home. And whatsoever they seem to us, yet <HI>all the wayes of the Lord are mercy and truth,</HI> un∣to such as keep his Covenant, and his Testi∣monies, <HI>Psal.</HI> 25.10.</P>

<P>This is answered in a word.

<P><HI>But my affliction is such, that I am kept from enjoy∣ing the Liberty of the House of God, and from praising him in the Congregation.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>This must needs be troublesome to Mindes well affected; howbeit if God himself restrains us, we may then be sure that he requires not our presence. And in such a case, if our de∣sires be with the Congregation, even that desire will be sufficient. Neither is the Lord so con∣fined to the Congregation, but that he is near to all, that call upon him faithfully wheresoe∣ver they be, when necessity, and not neglect is the reason of their absence. And besides all this, if at any time, by reason of Age or Sick∣ness, we are not able to do those things which we do desire, and did perform in the time of our health and strength, then shall a willing Mind be well-pleasing unto God, and good de∣sires shall be accepted. Yea, furthermore, this we must know for our consolation; that a Patient submiting to the good will of God, is a worshiping of him, as appears by that <HI>Job</HI> 1. 20, 21. where <HI>Job</HI> is said to worship God, when he did with Patience and contentedness submit un∣to him: This is indeed a glorifying of God, and herein we acknowledge him to be our God, and in thus submiting we shall perform unto God as good service as ever we did in all
<PB N="40" REF="000547_0021_0FA6B7BAA52BB388"/>
our Lives. For this is the passive part of true Obedience, and the Tryal of sincerity in other things. To serve the Lord when all goes well with us, is much; and it is altogether as much, if not more, to resolve to trust in him, though he should Kill us. And if we can with <HI>Job</HI> hold fast our Righteousness, and in the hour of Temptation not fall away, this is a true Note of pure Religion, and a manifest Argument of Sincerity and Truth.</P>

<P>A<HI>Nd yet after all this I must dye; and when a few years are come, I shall go the way whence I shall not return: and the fear of Death doth much amaze me.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>Verily there is no solid Reason why it should; for God hath given us Victory over Death it self; through our Lord Jesus Christ. The Death of Christ was the Death of Death. Death fastning upon him, to whom it was not due, lost its sting, and so became less able to hurt those that had deserved it. Christ hath pul'd out the sting of Death, by dying for sin; so that now, like a Bee, or Snake without a sting, it may buzze about us and fright us, but it can∣not hurt us. All the hurt that Death can do to such as believe in the Lord Jesus, is to free them out of Prison, to put an end to their days of sin, to carry them home to their Fathers
<PB N="41" REF="000547_0021_0FA6B7BAA52BB388"/>
house to let them into their Masters joy, to pull down those Mouldring Cottages wherein they dwell, and to build them up to immortality. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, them also that sleep in Jesus, shall God bring with him, and they shall be for ever with the Lord. And of this Happiness the worst kind of death that can befall us, cannot deprive us. A Man may dye in Poverty, he may dye with extremity of Torments, he may dye by common Calamities, and yet he may dye in Faith; and so dying his End shall be Peace: <HI>For blessed are the dead which dye in the Lord, even so saith the Spirit,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Rev.</HI> 14. 13. So that if we did but throughly under∣stand the nature of Death, and what it is to the People of God, we should be so far of being a∣fraid of it, that with St. <HI>Paul, We should rather desire to be desolved, because then we should be with Christ, which is the best of all.</HI></P>
<P>To shut up this point, and so likewise the whole matter concerning afflictions, this let me add to all the rest, that if we desire to get good by these Meditations, and to be upheld with Comfort in the time of trouble, we must con∣tinue instant in Prayer. This is that Receipt which the Holy Ghost prescribes to all sorts of Persons, against all manner of grievances what∣soever, <HI>James</HI> 5. 23. This is the Remedy that is alwayes at hand, and never out of season. Yea, this is that Messenger which being dis∣patch'd
<PB N="42" REF="000547_0022_0FA6B7BB03A46B38"/>
aright, was never sent empty away. Believe it, If a Man were in a Case more despe∣rate then Death, in a place worse then Hell, yet if there he could pray heartily, he should find comfort and strength, even beyond Hope: for our Prayers use to be with the utmost of our Hopes, if not beyond them, and yet God doth use to be better to us than our Prayers.</P>

<HEAD>The Sixteenth Question.</HEAD>
<P>I <HI>See now that there is matter enough of Solid Comfort in the Word of God. But the uneven∣ness of my walking makes me to doubt, that I have no part nor portion in those precious promises, which God hath made unto his People.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>Promises I confess that are misapplied, can afford to the Soul no solid Comfort. But from our Failings we may not presently conclude that they do not at all belong to us: for God looks upon the heart; and where Ability is want∣ing, the Will is accepted.</P>
<P>Are not our Failings your Grief? Are they not besides your Will? Are they not contrary to the current of your Desires, and the main bent of your Resolutions and Endeavours? It is not your Endeavour to do the Will of God, though it cost you the parting with the sweet∣ness of Sin, even your own Iniquity? And is it 
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot your Resolution, that you will not wicked∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> depart from God? If it be so, then notwith∣standing 
<PB N="43" REF="000547_0022_0FA6B7BB03A46B38"/>
your Failings, you may say with <HI>Da∣vid, I have kept thy Word:</HI> For though this be not such a measure of keeping as the Law re∣quireth, yet it is such a keeping as God accept∣eth: for he accounteth such as keep themselves from wilful sins, upright and innocent through Christ their strength and their Redeemer, as appears by that passage, <HI>Psal.</HI> 19. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</P>
<P>And this is a true Rule, whereby to proceed in the judging of our selves. If a Man that be∣lieves in Christ, continues in an unknowen sin that cannot hinder the uprightness of his heart, so the Ignorance be not wilful; but the least touch of knowledge or wilfulness mars Sinceri∣ty. So that if our failings be not wilful, though they be many, yet they cannot hinder our inte∣rest in the promises of God.</P>
<P>And what can we now object more? Do we doubt the Truth of all these Promises? Surely we need not; for God is not a Man that he should lie, neither the Son of Man that he should repent: Hath he spoken, and shall he not do it? Hath he said, and shall it not come to pass? Was he ever yet worse then his word? And have not we had experience of his Love, as well upon our selves as others? Is he not the true witness, and a God that is most zealous of his own glory? Why then are we disquieted, and why are our hearts dejected within us? Still trust in God, make straight steps to your
<PB N="44" REF="000547_0023_0FA6B7BBC2143230"/>
Feet: Pray for Faith in the promises, and sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up your selves to take hold of God, tarry the Lords Leasure, and fear not; light is Sown for the Righteous, and gladness for such as be up∣right in heart; it may lie buried in the ground out of sight for a season, it may be somewhat long in coming up, and very unlikely to come to any perfection: Nevertheless, in due season we shall reap if we faint not. And therefore cast not away your confidence. For the worst is past, the good is begun, the best is at hand: Lift up therefore the Hands that hang down, and strengthen the feeble Knees; and run with Patience the Race set before us; and being partakers of such precious promises, let us think upon them, believe in them, and live in them: and in so doing, we shall rejoyce with joy unspeakable and full of glory.</P>
<P>Here is the sum of all. <HI>There is no condem∣nation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit,</HI> Rom.8.1. <HI>There is no condemnation,</HI> and there's our comfort: the ground hereof is Christ; the way unto it, is by Faith to be in him; the evidence of it, is <HI>to walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit.</HI> In the matter of merit, Christ is all; in matter of interest and application Faith is all, in mat∣ter of Evidence and manifestation, new Obe∣dience is all. Nothing can free us from con∣demnation, but Christ; nothing can give us
<PB N="45" REF="000547_0023_0FA6B7BBC2143230"/>
interest in Christ, but Faith; nothing can as∣sure us that we do truly believe in Christ, and shall be delivered from condemnation, but a care to be obedient unto Christ in all things: wherefore let us so believe, and so live: for as many as walk according to this Rule, Peace shall be upon them, and upon the <HI>Israel</HI> of God.</P>
<P>Now the God of Hope, fill us with all joy and Peace in believing, that we may abound in Hope through the Power of the Holy Ghost <HI>Amen</HI> and <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
