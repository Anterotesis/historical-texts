<HEAD>AT A General COURT Held at Charlstown by Adjournment. Feb. 12<SUP>th</SUP> 1689/90.</HEAD>
<P>THis Court taking into their serious Consideration the many Calls of God's Providence upon his People, to be much and often in solemn manner imploring his Favour; and having by Experi∣ence found it good to draw nigh to God, <HI>who will be sought to by the House of Israel,</HI> Do therefore Recommend to the earnest Supplications of all that fear God, the common Interest of the Protestant Re∣ligion in the World, which hath so many potent Adversaries; as also the Ac∣complishment of such Scripture-Prophesies, as seem to be near the birth, and must be ushered in with Prayer. More specially the present state of our own Na∣tion, with their Allies; that the Wars in <HI>Ireland</HI> may have a good issue; that all Animosities amongst God's People may be removed, and their hearts uni∣ted; that King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> may have their Throne Establish∣ed, and be made great Blessings: That Peace and Truth may flourish in those Kingdoms under their happy Conduct.</P>
<P>The Condition also of the Land we live in, which is under many awful Frowns of God; That He will pardon the Sins that have so provoked Him; that He will reform and heal us; that He will preserve us from the Rage of our Heathen Enemies; that He will improve and prosper us in winning the Natives of the Country, to the saving Knowledge and Obedience of the only True God; that so there may be One Fold, and One Shepherd: That He will guard us against Foreign Invasion; take away the prevailing and mortal Di∣stempers of the Fever and Small Pox. That <HI>He</HI> will provide for us a Settle∣ment of our Liberties, giving us to that end, Favour with our Soveraign: De∣feating all Enterprises against us: Preserving and giving good success to our Agents: affording Direction in the management of all our arduous Affairs: That He will uphold our Churches, bless our Seed-time and Harvest: that there may be no Famine of Bread, nor of Hearing the Words of the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>Now that all Persons, in their several Places; Ministers and People, may with the more Intenseness and Solemnity apply themselves, to so great and seasonable a Duty: This Court doth Appoint the sixth of</HI> March <HI>next, to be Observed as a Day of Publick <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Fasting</HI> throughout this Jurisdiction; Hereby For∣bidding all Servile Labour thereon.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><HI>By the COURT,</HI> <SIGNED>Isaac Addington, Secr'.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
