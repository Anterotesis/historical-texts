<HEAD>The <HI>Argument.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>FLorio</HI> and <HI>Albinus,</HI> two young Gentlemen of good Edu∣cation, and Admirers of the Deceased, had retired for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. In a pleasant Morning Walk, they chance to meet on the summit of a gently rising Hill; their mutual Salutation, introduces a short Discourse on the Beauties of the Country which is suddenly interrupted by the Sight of a Tree which had been shattered by the Lightning. Admiration of the <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> gives Occasion to <HI>Florio</HI> to communicate to his Friend the News of a far more awful and surprizing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Providence, in the Removal of their once beloved and worthy Pastor by Death. <HI>Albinus</HI> is surprized, but recollecting a remarkable Dream, emble∣matical of the Occurrence he relates it to <HI>Florio,</HI> who full of Grief laments the Life of so great and good a Man; while <HI>Albinus</HI> represents the infinite Advantage to himself by the Change, and his Admission into the Society of the Blessed: After which they join in a sacred Ode, expressive of their Resignation to divine Providence.</P>
<P><HI>The Eclogue is formed partly on the Plan of</HI> Virgil<HI>'s</HI> Daphnis.</P>

<L>"SWeet is the Breath of Morn." The fragrant Air</L>
<L>Dispensing balm: Sweets, and od'rous Gales,</L>
<L>Filled with melodious Notes, of warbling Birds</L>
<L>Invites me, from my downy Couch to rise;</L>
<L>And on this gently rising Hill to walk.<MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>Here let me muse, and from this Top survey</L>
<L>The pleasing Landschape, Nature spreads around.—</L>
<L>But yonder comes my Florio; I'll advance,</L>

<L>I bid you welcome to this rural Seat.<MILESTONE N="10"/></L>

<L>All hail, my Friend, I wish you Health and Peace;</L>

<SPEAKER>ALBINUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>How Nature smiles! This is the lovely Time</L>
<L>For Contemplation, and sublime Delights.</L>
<L>See how the Clouds disperse, the orient Blush <MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L>Proclaims th' Approach of the bright Lamp of Day.</L>
<L>What beauteous Verdure covers all the Ground!</L>
<L>How pleasing to behold those Flocks, that graze</L>

<L>Expand their ruddy Bosoms to the South,<MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L>Adorn the Trees, and load their bending Boughs!</L>

<SPEAKER>ALBINUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>— What is that <MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>Obtrudes itself upon my wondring Eyes?</L>
<L>Observe it's shatter'd Trunk! it's broken Boughs!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>This Trunk, my Friend, was once a stately Oak,</L>
<L>Sublime, it rear'd it's verdant Top above</L>
<L>The lofty Cedars which around it grew▪ <MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>Deep rooted in the Earth, it mock'd the Blasts</L>
<L>Of bell'wing Storms, and jarring Elements:</L>
<L>But not long since, upon a gloomy Day,</L>
<L>When Heav'n's Artillery began to roar,</L>
<L>And forky Lightnings glar'd around the Sky; <MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>A fiery Shaft, wing'd with impetuous Speed</L>
<L>Flash'd from the warring Clouds, and darted down</L>
<L>Upon the Summit of this tow'ring Oak;</L>
<L>Rent it's strong Trunk, and marr'd it's lofty Pride,</L>
<L>And, instantaneous, fell'd it to the Dust.<MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALBINUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>O wondrous Force! that in a Moment could</L>
<L>Shatter the tow'ring Monarch of the Grove,</L>
<L>And cleave it's knotty Trunk, amazing Power!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Amazing Power indeed! how wondrous then</L>
<L>That Arm, which guides th' unerring Shafts of Death?<MILESTONE N="45"/></L>
<L>O my <HI>Albinus,</HI> would these Tears permit,</L>
<L>A far more awful Stroke I could relate,</L>
<L>And more surprizing Frown of Providence</L>
<L>Than what stands here presented to our View.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALBINUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Declare, my <HI>Florio,</HI> what's the mournful Cause <MILESTONE N="50"/></L>
<L>Of this so sad Commotion in your Breast;</L>
<L>For never did your Countenance before</L>
<L>Discover such deep Woe, and heart-felt Grief.</L>
<L>What sad Catastrophe affects you thus?</L>

<SPEAKER>FLORIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Last Night, returning from my Ev'ning Walk <MILESTONE N="55"/></L>
<L>Calm and compos'd, I met a neighbouring Swain</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="009338_0005_10317CA4204ADC68"/>Returning from the Town; into my Hands</L>
<L>He gave a Letter, and strait bid adieu.—</L>
<L>Black was the Seal, Omen lugubrious!</L>
<L>Scarce had I op'd the yielding Folds, when lo!<MILESTONE N="60"/></L>
<L>These piercing Words presented to my View,</L>
<L>"<HI>Cumming is dead.</HI>—O had ten thousand Swords</L>
<L>Been darted thro' my Soul; their sharpest Pain</L>
<L>I had deem'd Pleasure, when compar'd with this.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALBINUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Is <HI>Cumming</HI> gone, and left a World in Tears?<MILESTONE N="65"/></L>
<L>Amazing News! it thrills my inmost Soul!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Had then ten thousand Thunders burst at once,</L>
<L>And thro' the Concave roar'd their horrid Peal;</L>
<L>The Shock I could have borne with seeming Ease;</L>
<L>But this, my Friend, is insupportable.<MILESTONE N="70"/></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALBINUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Repine not, O my <HI>Florio,</HI> but submit;</L>
<L>'Tis Heav'n that gives, and Heav'n that takes away.</L>
<L>Some sudden ill, my Phant'sy did presage</L>
<L>Had happ'ned to Mankind: For as I lay,</L>
<L>Last Night, invelop'd in the Arms of Sleep,<MILESTONE N="75"/></L>
<L>A sudden Vision on my Phant'sy pour'd,</L>
<L>Methought I gazing stood, and view'd the Heav'ns</L>
<L>With all their starry Glories shining fair,</L>
<L>Tho' past their Midnight Splendor; when behold!</L>
<L>As tow'rd the East I turn'd my wandring Eye,<MILESTONE N="80"/></L>
<L>Twinkling, the <HI>Morning Star</HI> sunk from it's Orb,</L>
<L>And in a Moment vanish'd from my Sight!</L>
<L>I gaz'd astounded, wondring what might be</L>
<L>The Cause of this so rare Phaenomenon.</L>
<L>When lo! a shining <HI>Seraph</HI> strait appear'd,<MILESTONE N="85"/></L>
<L>(Immortal Beauty sparkled in his Face.)</L>
<L>And thus address'd me: 'Cease, fond Man, to gaze,</L>
<L>'Thy mortal Skill can never comprehend</L>
<L>'JEHOVAH'S deep, unfathomable Ways.<MILESTONE N="90"/></L>
<L>'This heav'nly Visitant, altho' it shone</L>
<L>'With such surpassing, splendid Radiance,</L>
<L>'Yet by ungrateful Man was scarcely own'd;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="009338_0006_10317CAA6991EC08"/>'Base Man <HI>would</HI> sleep, and by it's chearing Beams</L>
<L>'Would never be enlightned, nor receive</L>

<L>'Therefore th' almighty GOD at length saw fit</L>

<SPEAKER>FLORIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>If ought could mitigate my heart-felt Grief,<MILESTONE N="100"/></L>
<L>That Thought alone, methinks would be sufficient:</L>
<L>Yet who can estimate the Loss we bear?</L>
<L>Not five swift circumvolving Suns have roll'd</L>
<L>Their annual Orbits, round our dreary Globe,</L>
<L>Since PRINCE, the great, the good, the learn'd, the wise,</L>
<L>Descended to the silent Shades of Death. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev. THOMAS PRINCE A. M. to whom Mr. CUMMING immediately succeeded, departed this Life <HI>Oct.</HI> 22. 1758. Ae 72.</NOTE><MILESTONE N="106"/></L>
<L><HI>Mankind</HI> deplor'd his Fall. Scarce had we now</L>
<L>Emerg'd out of that Gulph of gen'ral Woe,</L>

<L>The King of Terrors visits us again▪ <MILESTONE N="110"/></L>
<L>And moves our Candlestick out of his Place.</L>
<L>"<HI>Cumming</HI> is dead." No more that sacred Dome</L>
<L>With his harmonious Accents shall resound:</L>
<L>No more those glorious, evangelic Truths,</L>
<L>On which his Faith, and Hope were firmly built,<MILESTONE N="115"/></L>
<L>With such celestial <HI>Pathos,</HI> shall devolve</L>
<L>From his persuasive Tongue. Oft have I stood,</L>
<L>And join'd with him in ardent Pray'r to Heav'n;</L>
<L>Till I have almost seen his active Soul,</L>
<L>With inward Fervour, and Devotion fir'd <MILESTONE N="120"/></L>
<L>Burst thro' its feeble Tenement of Clay,</L>
<L>And wing its Flight up to the Throne of God.</L>
<L>But now, alas! no longer shall I hear</L>
<L>Those ardent Breathings. His pure Hands no more</L>
<L>Shall break the Bread of Life, unto our Souls.<MILESTONE N="125"/></L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="009338_0007_10317CABED2D3F20"/>Lament, and mourn, ye poor bereaved Flock;</L>

<L>Lament no more, my Friend, but change the Scene;</L>

<L>What tho' the Grave his mortal Part consume?</L>
<L>His disembodied Spirit still survives,</L>
<L>Releas'd from the frail Prison of his Flesh,</L>
<L>And to the Spirits of Just Men has fled.<MILESTONE N="135"/></L>
<L>We only part, till the great rising Day;</L>
<L>When this corruptible shall change its Mould,</L>
<L>This mortal put on Immortality;</L>
<L>And Earth, and Seas resign their sleeping Dead.</L>
<L>Why mourn we then? why would we wish him back</L>
<L>Into this gloomy Vale of Tears again?<MILESTONE N="141"/></L>
<L>He's far remov'd from Pain, and Sorrow now,</L>
<L>Where Anguish, Grief and Death can never wound:</L>
<L>No Calumny his spotless Soul can reach:</L>
<L>Nor warm Opponents e'er disturb his Peace▪— <MILESTONE N="145"/></L>
<L>Let not the mourning Flock too sorely grieve;</L>
<L>Yet SEWALL lives, and from his aged Lips</L>
