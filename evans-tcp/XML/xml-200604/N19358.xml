<P>THE POSTHUMOUS WORKS OF ANN ELIZA BLEECKER, IN PROSE AND VERSE.</P>

<HEAD>To the Public.</HEAD>
<P>IN the publication of <HI>Posthumous Works,</HI> it has been usual for the Editors or Publishers to accom∣pany them with a Prefatory Address,—generally explaining the particular reasons for offering them to the world, or relating their peculiar merits, and consequently their claim to the patronage of the lovers of science. In compliance with this general custom we think it necessary merely to note, that having been frequently solicited to publish, in a separate volume, a part of those writings of Mrs. BLEECKER which had appeared in the <HI>New-York Magazine,</HI> we conceived a collection of all such of her poems and essays as might with propriety come before th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> public, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould be more likely to meet the approbation bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of <HI>her</HI> friends, and of the friends of American l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ature. Having sug∣gested this idea to those who appeared most strenu∣ous for the measure, we were pleased to find it met their hearty concurrence; and through the oblig∣ing disposition of her husband and daughter, we are now happy in being able to present this volume to our fellow citizens.</P>
<P><PB REF="025208_0004_0FCC8E9FE858F6D8"/>We are indebted to a friend for the idea of adding a number of prose and poetical essays, which like∣wise first appeared in the <HI>New-York Magazine,</HI> most of them under the signature of ELLA, and which are the production of Mrs. MARGARETTA V. FAU∣GERES, the daughter of Mrs. BLEECKER. Our obligations to this lady are much increased by the addition of several Original Essays in verse, which the reader will find interspersed in that part of the collection which comprehends her writings.</P>
<P>It is not our intention to recommend this volume by an elaborate display of its particular merits or peculiar excellencies: the best recommendation we can give it, is an attentive perusal: and when this is done, that the reader of taste and elegance will join in asserting, that though it is not faultless, yet that its merits preponderate, and entitle it to the patronage of every true American, is the candid opinion of</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF Mrs. ANN ELIZA BLEECKER.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. ANN ELIZA BLEECKER was the youngest child of Mr. BRANDT SCHUYLER, of this city, (the place of her nativity;) she was born in October, anno Domini 1752; and though in her early years she never displayed any partiality for school, yet she was passionately fond of books, insomuch that she read with propriety any book that came to hand long before the time that children in common pass their Spelling-Books. But though her poetical produc∣tions (which made their appearance very early) displayed a taste far superior to her years; yet, so great was her diffidence of
<PB N="ii" REF="025208_0012_0FCCA28E37E26198"/>
her own abilities, that none but her most intimate acquaintance were ever indulged with a view of any of her performances, and <HI>then</HI> they were no sooner perused than she destroyed them.</P>
<P>Hence it comes, that none of her com∣positions previous to the year 1769, are extant: in that year she married JOHN J. BLEECKER, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>New-Rochelle</HI>; and being willing <HI>now</HI> to cherish her genius, after a short residence in the capital, they retired to <HI>Poughkeepsie,</HI> where they stayed a year or two; and then taking a liking to the northern parts of this state, they removed to <HI>Tomhanick,</HI> a beautiful solitary little village eighteen miles above <HI>Albany.</HI> Here Mr. BLEECKER built him an house on a little eminence, which commanded a pleasing prospect. On the <HI>east</HI> side of it was an elegantly simple <HI>garden,</HI> where fruits and flowers, exotics as well as natives, flourished with beauty; and a little beyond it the roaring river of <HI>Tomhanick</HI> dashed
<PB N="iii" REF="025208_0013_0FCCA290222009C8"/>
with rapidity its foaming waters among the broken rocks; toward the <HI>west,</HI> lay wide cultivated fields; in the <HI>rear,</HI> a young or∣chard, bounded by a thick forest; and in <HI>front,</HI> (after crossing the main road) a mea∣dow, through which wandered a dimpling stream, stretched itself to join a ridge of tall nodding pines, which rose in awful grandeur on the shelving brow of a grassy mountain. Through the openings of this wood you might descry little cottages scat∣tered up and down the country, whose environs the hard hand of Industry had transformed into rich fields and blooming gardens, and literally caused the wilderness to blossom as the rose—It is to this scene she alludes where she so beautifully says,
<Q><L>Cast your eyes beyond this meadow,</L>
<L>Painted by a hand Divine,</L>
<L>And observe the ample shadow</L>
<L>Of that solemn ridge of pine.</L></Q>
This was such a retreat as she had always desired—the dark forest, the rushing river,
<PB N="iv" REF="025208_0014_0FCCA291992A8140"/>
and the green valley had more charms for her than the gay metropolis she had left, and in which she was so well calculated to shine: and she was so much attached to rural pleasures, that no birds (those of prey excepted) were ever suffered to be shot near her habitation if she could pre∣vent it—indeed, they built their nests un∣molested in the very porch of the house.</P>
<P>And the cultivation of flowers had like∣wise a large share of her attention, so much, that where <HI>Flora</HI> had been remiss in deck∣ing the sod, she took upon herself that office, by gathering seeds from her own garden and strewing them promiscuously in the woods and fields, and along the clo∣very borders of her favourite brook.</P>
<P>'Till the memorable 1777, they lived in the most perfect tranquillity—fair pros∣pects were opening on every side—Her mother, a widow, (an ornament to the sex) lived with her—her half-sister, Miss TEN EYCK <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er cheerful sprightly
<PB N="v" REF="025208_0015_0FCCA2931C8FDFD8"/>
companion—and her attentive husband and prattling children closed the circle, and left her scarce another wish on this side of the grave—<HI>Then,</HI> indeed, the clamorous thunders of <HI>War</HI> frighted them from their peaceful dwelling, and the blasting hand of <HI>Desolation</HI> dispersed them as a flock in the desert.</P>
<P>Mr. BLEECKER, hearing of the ap∣proaches of the infatuated BURGOYNE, had left Mrs. BLEECKER with the children and servants, while he went to <HI>Albany</HI> to seek a place for them, (her mother and sister having just quitted her.) But he had scarce been gone a day when, as she sat at breakfast, she received intelligence that the enemy were within two miles of the vil∣lage, burning and murdering all before them. Terrified beyond description she rose from the table, and taking her ABELLA on her arm, and her other daughter (about four years old) by the hand, she set off on foot, with a young mulatto girl, leav∣ing
<PB N="vi" REF="025208_0016_0FCCA294345EB530"/>
the house and furniture to the mercy of the approaching savages. The roads were crouded with carriages loaded with women and children, but none could afford her assistance—distress was depictured on every countenance, and tears of heartfelt anguish moistened every cheek. They passed on—no one spoke to another—and no sound but the dismal creaking of bur∣dened wheels and the trampling of horses interrupted the mournful silence. After <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tedious walk of four or five miles, she ob∣tained a seat for the children upon one of the waggons, and she walked on to <HI>Stony-Arabia,</HI> where she expected to find many friends; but she was deceived—no door was open to <HI>her,</HI> whose house by many of them had been made use of as a home— she wandered from house to house, and at length obtained a place in the garret of a rich old acquaintance, where a couple of blankets, stretched upon some boards, were offered her as a bed; she, however, sat up
<PB N="vii" REF="025208_0017_0FCCA295AEBC5718"/>
all night and wept, and the next morning Mr. BLEECKER coming from <HI>Albany,</HI> met with them and returned to that city, from whence they set off with several other fa∣milies by water. At twelve miles below <HI>Albany</HI> little ABELLA was taken so ill that they were obliged to go on shore, where she died. The <HI>impressions</HI> this event made on Mrs. BLEECKER's mind were never effaced. The remembrance of every cir∣cumstance that led to it—the return of the season—the voice of an infant—or even the calm approach of a summer's evening, never failed to awaken all her sorrows; and she being naturally of a pensive turn of mind, <HI>too</HI> freely indulged them.</P>
<P>From this they proceeded to <HI>Red-Hook,</HI> where she met with her mother, who was declining very fast, and died a little after her daughter's arrival. The capture of BURGOYNE soon after taking place, they again set off to visit their little solitude; but, in their journey thither, she had the
<PB N="viii" REF="025208_0018_0FCCA297E2200DB0"/>
sorrowful office of closing the eyes of her last remaining sister.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Her own sister, Mrs. SWITS—her half-sister, Mrs. DARBE, (then Miss TEN EYCK,) is still living.</NOTE></P>
<P>The description she has given of these events, in a letter to a friend, may not be unacceptable.</P>

<P>CURST be the heart that is callous to the feelings of humanity, and which, concentered in itself, regards not the wail∣ings of affliction! Excuse my enthusi∣asm—it is the effect of repeated injuries received in my flight; but thank heaven I have supported every shock with tole∣rable fortitude, except the death of my ABELLA—she indeed had wound herself round every fibre of my heart—I loved, I idolized her—however, my little love languished and died, and I believe I
<PB N="ix" REF="025208_0019_0FCCA29994D10E48"/>
could then have beheld with less anguish the dissolution of Nature than the last gasp of my infant. The sensations I felt at the death of my dear parent were of a different nature—it was a <HI>tranquil sorrow,</HI> a <HI>melancholy</HI> which I have heard observ∣ed <HI>soothes</HI> the soul instead of corroding it. While I held the expiring saint in my arms, and saw her just verging into eternity—while I dropt tear after tear in solemn silence over her livid countenance, oh how sincerely did I wish to accom∣pany her from those scenes of vanity, from which her admirable precepts had so much detached my affections! <HI>Oh my mother! cried I,</HI> you <HI>lately wept for my</HI> ABELLA, <HI>we now pay the same mourn∣ful tribute to</HI> you! Oh Death! thou greatest evil annexed to human nature, how dost thou dissolve the sweet connec∣tions among men, and burst away the silken bands of Friendship! I thought I had <HI>now</HI> descended the lowest vale of
<PB N="x" REF="025208_0020_0FCCA29BA27A81F0"/>
mortal sorrow, but the deception vanish∣ed at the bed-side of my expiring sister. To enhance the distress, six tender in∣fants were clamouring round their insen∣sible mother, the one half unconscious of the occasion of the general grief, and only lamenting because the rest did.</P>
<P>After her interment I returned hither, truly convinced how visionary the eclat of <HI>this</HI> world is, and desiring to pass the remainder of my life in a tranquil enjoy∣ment of the bounties of heaven, neither elated to the extravagance of <HI>mirth,</HI> nor sunk to the meanness of <HI>dejection.</HI></P>

<P>From this period till the year 1781, they lived in tolerable tranquillity, when, in the beginning of August, as Mr. BLEECKER was assisting in the harvest, he, with two of his men, were made prisoners by a party
<PB N="xi" REF="025208_0021_0FCCA29DD6DF9740"/>
from <HI>Canada,</HI> and taken off immediately. As it was late in the afternoon, Mrs. BLEECKER expected him with a degree of impatience, and began to be apprehensive that something uncommon had occurred: a servant was therefore dispatched, who soon returned with the sorrowful account, that he could not see any of them, and that the waggon and horses were in the road tied to a tree.</P>
<P>She was at no loss to conjecture what was become of him, for a number of small parties from <HI>Canada</HI> were known to be sculking in the woods, for the sole pur∣pose of carrying off the most active citi∣zens. The neighbours therefore were im∣mediately alarmed, and the woods, as far as was practicable, were searched; but they could not discover a single trace of the party. Mrs. BLEECKER, giving him up for lost, set off for <HI>Albany</HI> directly, though it was then near night, and abandoned her∣self to the most hopeless grief; but, by a

wonderful train of events, Mr. BLEECKER was re-taken by a party from <HI>Bennington,</HI> after having passed the last habitation on this side of the <HI>Green-Mountains,</HI> and when his conductors for the <HI>first time</HI> had consi∣dered themselves as perfectly secure. He returned to her in six days, and the joy she felt at finding him operating more power∣fully than the grief she experienced at his loss, a fit of sickness ensued, which nearly proved fatal. They again returned to <HI>Tomhanick.</HI></P>
<P>Though Mrs. BLEECKER was witness to many scenes of distress during the late war, in many of which she was the principal sufferer; yet, the idea of a <HI>far distant</HI> peace, which should again restore her to her friends, gilt the solitary shades which encompassed her, and bore her up under frequent and poignant griefs.</P>
<P>In the year 1783, (the spring after the peace,) she re-visited <HI>New-York,</HI> in hopes of seeing her old acquaintance and friends;
<PB N="xiii" REF="025208_0023_0FCCA2A02C893AD8"/>
but her hopes were far from being realiz∣ed—some were dead; others had left the continent; and the few who remained were in different states: She saw her half-sister, Miss TEN EYCK, but once, and then but for a few minutes, as one party was em∣barking for <HI>New-York</HI> just as the other ar∣rived at <HI>Albany.</HI> Her principal correspon∣dents and much-loved relatives, the Miss V** W***'s, were in <HI>Jersey</HI>; and as the British were still here, she could not (with∣out the greatest difficulty) visit them. But the ruinous condition of her native city gave such a shock to her spirits as the unit∣ed efforts of her reason and fortitude were not able to ward off. The places which she once knew as the scenes of festivity, were now sunk into dust—the place that once knew them knowing them no more; or if by hard searching she at last descried them, they only met her eye as monuments of her past pleasures—dreary piles, mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l∣dering fast beneath the relentless hand of
<PB N="xiv" REF="025208_0024_0FCCA2A2E808A070"/>
<HI>Time</HI> and <HI>War.</HI> Her sensibility was too keen for her peace—She had struggled on through the war, and had suffered <HI>Hope</HI> to beguile the hours devoted to distress: but <HI>now</HI> the scene was changed—the illusion vanished, and she concluded <HI>now</HI> she should see no more good upon earth. She return∣ed again to her cottage, where she found her health very rapidly decline; and on the 23d of the following November, about noon-day, (after two days confinement to her bed) her calm spirit took its flight from its shattered habitation, without a struggle or a groan. She retained her sen∣ses till within a few minutes of her death; and the last words she uttered to her weep∣ing husband and family, were assurances of the pleasing prospect <HI>Immortality</HI> offered her.</P>
<P>It is needless to say her loss was severely felt—it may be naturally supposed. The benevolence of her disposition had extend∣ed itself to all classes of people; and in
<PB N="xv" REF="025208_0025_0FCCA2A3EDD886C8"/>
the village where she dwelt, there were several families who might be called her dependants. To the aged and infirm she was a physician and a friend—to the or∣phan she was a mother—and a soother of the widow's woes; all loved—all honour∣ed her: and when they followed her to the grave, they weeping said, (though differ∣ently expressed, still meaning the same,) "<HI>We have lost</HI> HER <HI>whose equal we shall never see again!</HI>"</P>
<P>It is to be regretted that the writings which we now have are but a small part of what she composed: she was frequently very lively, and would then give way to the flights of her fertile fancy, and write songs, satires, and burlesque: but, as draw∣ing a cord too tight will make it break, thus she would no sooner cease to be <HI>merry,</HI> than the heaviest <HI>dejection</HI> would succeed, and then all the pieces which were not as melancholy as herself, she destroyed. As she seldom kept copies of her poetical epis∣tles,
<PB N="xvi" REF="025208_0026_0FCCA2A5ED56F2E8"/>
the most of <HI>them</HI> are lost; one in par∣ticular, written some little time before she fled from <HI>Tomhanick,</HI> in 1777, and directed to General BURGOYNE, was left in her bu∣reau; the bureau was broken open and its contents plundered by his men; but whe∣ther the letter ever reached him or not, is unknown. In the winters of 1779 and 1780, she amused herself and friends by writing what she called the <HI>Albany Gazette,</HI> which was sent by every opportunity to <HI>Fishkill,</HI> where several of her relations lived. This lively and ingenious performance was much admired, and being handed about from one company to another, is entirely lost. Several political and satirical pieces shared a similar fate.</P>
<P>Some of those, however, which are left, are here presented to the public. The poli∣tical sentiments displayed in several of them will, it is probable, recommend them to the notice and favour of the Patriot, and the rest may please the lovers of artless style.
<PB N="xvii" REF="025208_0027_0FCCA2A75BB260B8"/>
Many of them are faulty, but their merits are more numerous than their <HI>defects,</HI> and <HI>these</HI> will be easily pardoned and forgotten by all who knew her; for <HI>Detraction</HI> will not rise up against <HI>her,</HI> after death, whose virtues, when alive, endeared her to so many admiring <HI>friends,</HI> and whose <HI>enemies</HI> (and <HI>Envy</HI> created her some) could not speak evil of her.</P>
<P>As most of these pieces were intended for the amusement of herself and particular friends, and not for the public eye, they appear as they flowed extempore from her pen. Frequently she wrote while with company, at the desire of some one present, without premeditation, and at the same time bearing a part in the conversation.</P>
<P>Mrs. BLEECKER possessed a considerable share of beauty; her countenance was ani∣mated, and expressive of her benevolent, feeling mind; her person, rather tall, was graceful and elegant; her easy, unaffected deportment and engaging manners pro∣cured
<PB N="xviii" REF="025208_0028_0FCCA2A88A2ECFC0"/>
her the esteem of most persons at first sight, which generally increased on a more intimate acquaintance.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF MARIA KITTLE. In a Letter to Miss Ten Eyck.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Tomhanick,</HI>
<DATE><HI>December,</HI> 1779.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SUSAN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOWEVER fond of novels and romances you may be, the unfortunate adventures of one of my neighbours, who died yesterday, will make you despise that fiction, in which, know∣ing the subject to be fabulous, we can never be so truly interested. While this lady was ex∣piring, Mrs. C— V—, her near kins∣woman, related to me her unhappy history, in which I shall now take the liberty of interest∣ing you benevolent and feeling heart.</P>
<P>MARIA KITTLE was the only issue of her parents, who cultivated a large farm on the
<PB N="20" REF="025208_0031_0FCCA2AB69C874F8"/>
banks of the <HI>Hudson,</HI> eighteen miles above <HI>Al∣bany.</HI> They were persons of good natural abi∣lities, improved by some learning; yet, con∣scious of a deficiency in their education, they studied nothing so much as to render their little daughter truly accomplished.</P>
<P>MARIA was born in the year 1721. Her promising infancy presaged a maturity of excel∣lencies; every amiable quality dawned through her lisping prattle; every personal grace at∣tended her attitudes and played over her fea∣tures. As she advanced through the playful stage of childhood, she became more eminent than a Penelope for her industry▪ yet, soon as the sun declined, she always retired with her books until the time of repose, by which means she soon informed her opening mind with the principles of every useful science. She was beloved by all her female companions, who, though they easily discovered her superior ele∣gance of manners, instead of envying, were excited to imitate her. As she always made one in their little parties of pleasure on festival days, it is no wonder that she soon became the reigning goddess among the swains. She was importuned to admit the addresses of numbers,
<PB N="21" REF="025208_0032_0FCCA2ACE8D71BD0"/>
whom she politely discarded, and withdrew herself awhile from public observation. How∣ever, the fame of her charms attracted several gentlemen of family from <HI>Albany,</HI> who intruded on her retirement, soliciting her hand. But this happiness was reserved for a near relation of her's, one Mr. KITTLE, whose merits had made an impression on her heart. He, although not handsome, was possessed of a most engaging address; while his learning and moral virtues more particularly recommended him to her esteem. Their parents soon discovered their reciprocal passion, and highly approving of it, hastened their marriage, which was celebrated under the most happy auspices.</P>
<P>MARIA was fifteen when married. They removed to his farm, on which he had built a small neat house, surrounded by tall cedars, which gave it a contemplative air. It was si∣tuated on an eminence, with a green inclosure in the front, graced by a well cultivated gar∣den on one side, and on the other by a clear stream, which, rushing over a bed of white pebble, gave them a high polish, that cast a soft gleam through the water.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="025208_0033_0FCCA2AF30C37988"/>Here they resided in the tranquil enjoyment of that happiness which so much merit and in∣nocence deferred: the indigent, the sorrowful, the unfortunate were always sure of consola∣tion when they entered those peaceful doors. They were almost adored by their neighbours, and even the wild savages themselves, who often resorted thither for refreshments when hunting, expressed the greatest regard for them, and admiration of their virtues.</P>
<P>In little more than a year they were blessed with a daughter, the lovelier resemblance of her lovely mother: as she grew up, her graces increasing, promised a bloom and understand∣ing equal to her's; the Indians, in particular, were extremely fond of the smiling ANNA; whenever they found a young fawn, or caught a brood of wood-ducks, or surprised the young beaver in their daily excursions through the forests, they presented them with pleasure to her; they brought her the earliest strawberries, the scarlet plumb, and other delicate wild fruits in painted baskets.</P>
<P>How did the fond parents hearts delight to see their beloved one so universally caressed! When they sauntered over the vernal fields
<PB N="23" REF="025208_0034_0FCCA2B0AAA8A780"/>
with the little prattler wantoning before them collecting flowers and pursuing the velvet elu∣sive butterfly, MARIA's cheek suffusing with rapture, "Oh my dear," she would say,
<Q>we are happier than human beings can expect to be; how trivial are the evils annexed to our situation! may God avert that our hea∣ven be limited to this life!</Q></P>
<P>Eleven years now elapsed before Mrs. KIT∣TLE discovered any signs of pregnancy: her spouse silently wished for a son, and his desires were at length gratified; she was delivered of a charming boy, who was named, after him, WILLIAM.</P>
<P>A French and Indian war had commenced sometime before; but about eight months after her delivery, the savages began to commit the most horrid depredations on the English frontiers. Mr. KITTLE, alarmed at the danger of his brothers, who dwelt near <HI>Fort-Edward,</HI> (the eldest being just married to a very agree∣able young woman) invited them to reside with him during the war.</P>
<P>They were scarce arrived when the enemy made further incursions in the country, burn∣ing the villages and scalping the inhabitants,
<PB N="24" REF="025208_0035_0FCCA2B25623BD68"/>
neither respecting age or sex. This terribly alarmed Mrs. KITTLE; she began to prepare for flight, and the next evening after receiving this intelligence, as she and Mr. KITTLE were busily employed in packing up china and other things, they were accosted by several Indians, whose wigwams were contiguous to the village of <HI>Schochticook,</HI> and who always seemed well affected to the English. An elderly savage undertook to be prolocutor, and desired the family to compose themselves, assuring them they should be cautioned against any approach∣ing danger. To inforce his argument, he pre∣sented MARIA with a belt interwoven with silk and beads, saying,
<Q>There, receive my token of friendship: we go to dig up the hatchet, to sink it in the heads of your ene∣mies; we shall guard this wood with a wall of fire—you shall be safe.</Q>
A warm plow of hope deepened in MARIA's cheek at this— Then ordering wine to be brought to the friendly savages, with a smile of diffidence, "I am afraid," said she,
<Q>necessity may oblige you to abandon us, or neglect of your pro∣mise may deprive us of your protection.</Q>— "Neglect of my promise!" retorted he with
<PB N="25" REF="025208_0036_0FCCA2B3AC9AF9D0"/>
some acrimony:
<Q>No, MARIA, I am a true man; I shoot the arrow up to the Great Captain every new moon: depend upon it, I will trample down the briars round your dwelling, that you do not hurt your feet.</Q>
MARIA now retired, bowing a grateful ac∣knowledgment, and leaving the savages to in∣dulge their festivity, who passed the night in the most vociferous mirth.</P>
<P>Mrs. KITTLE, with a sort of exultation, re∣lated the subject of their conference to her hus∣band, who had absented himself on their first appearance, having formed some suspicion of the sincerity of their friendship, and not being willing to be duped by their dissimulation. "And now," added MARIA smiling,
<Q>our fears may again subside: Oh my dear! my happiness is trebled into rapture, by seeing you and my sweet babes out of danger.</Q>
He only sighed, and reaching his arm round her polished neck, pressed her to his bosom. After a short pause, "My love," said he,
<Q>be not too confident of their fidelity; you surely know what a small dependence is to be placed on their promises: however, to appear sus∣picious might be suddenly fatal to us; we
<PB N="26" REF="025208_0037_0FCCA2B592BC3808"/>
will therefore suspend our journey to <HI>Albany</HI> for a few days.</Q>
Though MARIA's soul saddened at the conviction of this truth; though her fears again urged her to propose immediate flight, yet she acquiesced; and having supped with the family, this tender pair sunk asleep on the bosom of rest.</P>
<P>Early the next morning Mr. KITTLE arose, first impressing a kiss on MARIA's soft cheek, as she slumbered with her infant in her arms. He then awaked his brother, reminding him that he had proposed a hunting match the pre∣ceding evening. "It is true," replied PETER,
<Q>but since hostilities have commenced so near us as the Indians inform, I think it rather imprudent to quit the family.</Q>—<Q>Come, come,</Q>
replied the other,
<Q>do not let us intimidate the neighbours by cloistering our∣selves up with women and children.</Q>—<Q>I reject the thought,</Q>
rejoined PETER,
<Q>of being afraid.</Q>
Then having dressed him∣self, while his brother charged their pieces, they left the house, and traversed the pathless grass for many hours without perceiving any thing but small birds, who filled the fragrant air with melody, "PETER," said Mr. KIT∣TLE,
<PB N="27" REF="025208_0038_0FCC8E99E5CBEB28"/>
casting his eyes around the lovely land∣scape,
<Q>what a profusion of sweets does Na∣ture exhale to please her intelligent crea∣tures! I feel my heart expand with love and gratitude to heaven every moment, nor can I ever be grateful enough. I have health and competence, a lovely fond wife whose smile would calm the rudest storm of passion, and two infants blossoming into perfection; all my social ties are yet unbroken—PETER, I anticipate my heaven—But why, my bro∣ther, do you turn pale? what dreadful idea stiffens your features with amazement? what in God's name ails you, PETER? are you unwell? sit down under this tree awhile.</Q>
—To these interrogatories PETER replied,
<Q>Excuse my weakness, I am not unwell, but an unusual horror chilled my blood; I felt as if the damps of death prest already round my soul; but the vapour is gone off again, I feel quite better.</Q>
Mr. KITTLE cheered his brother, attributing his emotion to fear; who, by this time, having re-assumed his com∣posure, entered into discourse with cheerful∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess, refusing to return home without having killed any thing.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="025208_0039_0FCC8E9B62BED620"/>Then rising, they proceeded through lofty groves of pine, and open fields that seemed to bend under the heavy hand of Ceres. At last, disappointment and fatigue prevailed on them to return home▪ they had gone farther than they apprehended; but passing along the bank of the river within a few miles of Mr. KIT∣TLE's, they espied a fat doe walking securely on the beach, which PETER softly approach∣ing, levelled his piece with so good an aim that the animal dropped instantly at the explosion. This seeming success was, however, the origin of their calamities; for immediately after, two savages appeared, directed in their course by the firing. Setting up a loud yell, they ran up to the brothers and discharged their fire-arms. Mr. KITTLE started back, but PETER receiv∣ed a brace of balls in his bosom. He recoiled a few steps back, and then sunk down incom∣passed by those deadly horrors of which in the morning he had a presentiment. Mr. KITTLE stood awhile aghast, like a person just waked from a frightful dream; but on seeing the In∣dian advancing to tear the scalp from his dying brother, he suddenly recollected himself, and shot a bullet through his head: then grappling
<PB N="29" REF="025208_0040_0FCC8E9D48CC2AB0"/>
with the other, who was loading again, he wrested his firelock from him, and felled him to the ground with the but-end of it. This was no time for reflection or unavailing laments; the danger was eminent: so leaving the savages for dead, with a mournful silence Mr. KITTLE hastened to throw the deer from off his horse, and laid his bleeding brother across him.</P>
<P>When our souls are gloomy, they seem to cast a shade over the objects that surround us, and make nature correspondent to our feelings: so Mr. KITTLE thought the night fell with a deeper gloom than usual. The soft notes of evening birds seemed to be the responses of sa∣vage yells. The echo of his tread, which he never before regarded, now rung dismally hol∣low in his ears. Even the rustling of the winds through the leaves seemed attended with a so∣lemnity that chilled him with cold tremors. As he proceeded with his mournful charge, his feelings were alarmed for his dear MARIA; he dreaded the agitation and distress this ad∣venture would throw her in: but it was un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oidable!</P>
<P>The sound of his horses feet no sooner in∣vaded the ears of MARIA, than seizing a light
<PB N="30" REF="025208_0041_0FCCA2B6A1F11A28"/>
she sprung with a joyful impatience to the door, and was met by her partner pale and bloody, who endeavoured to prevent too sudden a dis∣covery of this calamity. But at the first glance she comprehended the whole affair, and retir∣ing a few steps, with the most exquisite agony in her countenance, "Oh Mr. KITTLE!" she cried, clasping her hands together,
<Q>it is all over—we are betrayed—your brother is killed!</Q>
—"Too true, oh, too fatally true!" replied he, falling on his knees beside her as she sunk down,
<Q>my angel! the very savages that solemnly engaged to protect us have de∣prived him of life; but I am yet alive, my MARIA, be comforted—I will instantly pro∣cure carriages, and before morning you and your innocents shall be beyond the reach of their malevolence.</Q></P>
<P>By this time the family had crouded about them, and with grievous wailings were inquir∣ing the particulars of this sad adventure. Mr. KIITLE having related every circumstance with brevity, ordered the corpse to be laid in a remote chamber, desiring at the same time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> horse to be saddled for him. Then, more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pressed by his wife's griefs than his own, he
<PB N="31" REF="025208_0042_0FCCA2B8530E5778"/>
led the disconsolate fair to her chamber, where, being seated, she sighing demanded where he intended to go at that time of night. "Only," said he,
<Q>to the village of <HI>Schochticook</HI> to hire a couple of waggons; I shall return in an hour I hope, with a proper guard to secure our retreat from this hostile place.</Q>
MARIA was silent; at length she burst into a flood of tears, which his endearments only augmented. Then expostulating with him,
<Q>Is it not enough,</Q>
cried she,
<Q>that you have escaped one danger, but must you be so very, eager to encounter others? besides, you are spent with sorrow and fatigue—let one of your brothers perform this silent expedition.</Q>— "It is impossible," replied the tender husband;
<Q>how can I dare to propose a danger to them from which I would shrink myself? their lives are equally precious with mine: but God may disappoint our fears, my love!</Q>
He would have continued, but his spouse, rising from her seat, interrupted him—
<Q>At least, my dear, before you leave us give your lovely babes a farewell embrace, that if fate should —should separate us, <HI>that</HI> yet shall sweeten our hours of absence.</Q>
Here she found
<PB N="32" REF="025208_0043_0FCCA2BAB06B7A30"/>
herself clasped in her consort's arms, who ex∣claimed,
<Q>My MARIA! I love you passion∣ately, and if the least shadow of danger did appear to attend this night's travel, for your sake, for my blessed children's sake I would decline it: but I have left the Indians lifeless, who no doubt attacked us from some private pique; nor will they be discovered until morning.</Q>—"Well then," MARIA an∣swered,
<Q>I no longer oppose you; forgive my fears.</Q>
Meanwhile, as she stept to the cra∣dle for her suckling, the fair ANNA, who was listening at the door anxious to hear her parents sentiments on this occasion, quitted her station and flew to them swift as light; dropping on her knees before her father, and looked up in his face with the most attractive graces and the persuasive eloquence of simplicity. Her neck and features were elegantly turned, her com∣plexion fairer than the tuberose, and contrasted by the most shining ringlets of dark hair. Her eyes, whose brilliancy was softened through the medium of tears, for a while dwelt tenderly on his countenance. At length, with a voi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> scarce audible, she sighed out,
<Q>Oh papa! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not leave us; if any accident should happen
<PB N="33" REF="025208_0044_0FCCA2BBE528AA30"/>
to you, mamma will die of grief, and what will become of poor ANNA and BILLY? who will care for me? who will teach me when my papa, my mamma's papa is gone?</Q>
"—"My sweet child," replied he, embrac∣ing her and holding her to his bosom,
<Q>there is no danger; I shall return in an hour, and before to-morrow you shall be safe on the plains of <HI>Albany,</HI> and my heart shall exult over the happiness of my family.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. KITTLE now approached with her playful infant in her arms; but its winning ac∣tions extorted nothing but groans from her pain∣ed bosom, which was more stormy than On∣tario-Lake, when agitated by fierce winds. Mr. KITTLE perciving this uncommon emo∣tion, gently took the child from her, and re∣peatedly kissed it, while new smiles dimpled its lovely aspect. "Oh!" said he to himself,
<Q>this gloom that darkens MARIA's soul is su∣pernatural!—it seems dreadfully portenti∣ous!—Shall I yet stay?</Q>
But here a servant informing him that his horse was ready, he blushed at his want of fortitude; and having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>quered his irresolution, after the most af∣fecting and solemn parting▪ he quitted his house, never to review it more▪</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="025208_0045_0FCCA2BD6A619818"/>MARIA then walked sadly back again, and having assembled the family in a little hall, they closed and barred the doors. Mrs. CO∣MELIA KITTLE, MARIA's sister-in-law, was far advanced in her pregnancy, which increas∣ed her husband's uneasiness for her; and they were debating in what manner to accommo∣date her at <HI>Albany,</HI> when the trampling of feet about the house, and a yell of complicated voices, announced the Indians arrival. Struck with horror and consternation, the little family crouded together in the center of the hall, while the servants at this alarm, being in a kitchen distant from the house, saved them∣selves by a precipitate flight. The little BIL∣LY, frightened at such dreadful sounds, clung fast to his mother's throbbing breast, while ANNA, in a silent agony of amazement, clasp∣ed her trembling knees. The echo of their yells yet rung in long vibrations through the forest, when, with a thundering peal of strokes at the door, they demanded entrance. Distrac∣tion and despair fat upon every face. MARIA and her companions gazed wildly at each oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> till, upon repeated menaces and efforts to bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> open the door, COMELIA's husband, giving all
<PB N="35" REF="025208_0046_0FCCA2BFB52C0B98"/>
for lost, leisurely advanced to the door. CO∣MELIA seeing this, uttered a great shriek, and cried out,
<Q>O God! what are your doing, my rash, rash, unfortunate husband! you will be sacrificed!</Q>
Then falling on her knees, she caught hold of his hand and sobbed out,
<Q>O pity me! have mercy on yourself, on me, on my child!</Q>—"Alas! my love," said he, half turning with a look of distraction,
<Q>what can we do? let us be resigned to the will of God.</Q>
So saying he unbarred the door, and that instant received a fatal bullet in his bosom, and fell backward writhing in agonies of death; the rest recoiled at this horrible spectacle, and huddled in a corner, sending forth the most piercing cries: in the interim the savages rush∣ing in with great shouts, proceeded to mangle the corpse, and having made an incision round his head with a crooked knife, they tugged off his bloody scalp with barbarous triumph. While this was perpetrating, an Indian, hi∣deously painted, strode serociously up to COME∣LIA, (who sunk away at the sight, and fainted o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a chair) and cleft her white forehead deep∣ly with his tomahack. Her fine azure eyes just opened, and then suddenly closing for ever,
<PB N="36" REF="025208_0047_0FCCA2C12C426220"/>
she tumbled lifeless at his feet. His sangui∣nary soul was not yet satisfied with blood; he deformed her lovely body with deep gashes; and, tearing her unborn babe away, dashed it to pieces against the stone wall; with many additional circumstances of infer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al cruelty.</P>
<P>During this horrid carnage, the dead were stripped, and dragged from the house, when one of the hellish band advanced to MARIA, who circling her babes with her white arms, was sending hopeless petitions to heaven, and bemoaning their cruelly lost situation: as he approached, expecting the fatal stroke, she en∣deavoured to guard her children, and with sup∣plicating looks, implored for mercy. The sa∣vage attempted not to strike; but the astonished ANNA sheltered herself behind her mamma, while her blooming suckling quitting her breast, gazed with a pleasing wonder on the painted stranger.—MARIA soon recognized her old friend that presented her with the belt, through the loads of shells and feathers that disguised him. This was no time, however, to irritate him, by reminding him of his pro∣mise; yet, guessing her thoughts, he antici∣pated her remonstrance. "MARIA," said he,
<Q>be not afraid, I have promised to protect you;
<PB N="37" REF="025208_0048_0FCCA2C2A8A07788"/>
you shall live and dance with us around the fire at <HI>Canada</HI>▪ but you have one small in∣cumbrance, which, if not remove, will much impede your progress thither.</Q>
So saying he seized her laughing babe by the wrists, and forcibly endeavoured to draw him from her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s. At this, terrified beyond conception, she exclaimed,
<Q>O God! leave me, leave me my child! he shall not go, though a legion of de∣vils should try to separate us!</Q>
Holding him still fast, while the Indian applied his strength to tear him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, gnashing his teeth at her op∣position; "Help! God of heaven!" screamed she,
<Q>help! have pity, have mercy on this infant! O God! O Christ! can you bear to see this? O mercy! mercy! mercy! let a little spark of compassion save this inoffend∣ing, this lovely angel!</Q>
By this time the breathless babe dropt its head on its bosom; the writs were nigh pinched off, and seeing him just expiring, with a dreadful shriek she resigned him to the merciless hands of the savage, who instantly dashed his little forehead against the stones, and casting his bleeding body at some distance from the house, left him to make his exit in feeble and unheard groans.—Then in∣deed,
<PB N="38" REF="025208_0049_0FCCA2C52B064070"/>
in the unutterable anguish of her soul, she fell prostrate, and rending away her hair, she r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ared out her sorrows with a voice louder than natural, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>endered awfully hollow by too great an exertion. "O barbarians!" she exclaimed,
<Q>surpassing devils in wicked∣ness! so may a tenfold night of misery en∣wrap your black souls, as you have deprived the babe of my bosom, the comfort of my cares, my blessed cherub, of light and life— O hell! are not thy flames impatient to cleave the center and engulph <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wretches in thy everburning waves? are there no thun∣ders in Heaven—no avenging Angel—no God to take notice of such Heaven defying cruelties?</Q>
Then rushing to her dead infant with redoubled cries, and clapping her hands, she laid herself over his mangled body; again softened in tears and moans, she wiped the blood from his ghastly countenance, and prest him to her heaving bosom, alternately caressing him and her trembling ANNA, who, clinging to her with bitter wailings, and kissing her hands and face; entreated her to implore the sa∣vages for mercy. "Do, my angel mamma," she urged,
<Q>do beg them yet to pity—beg them yet to save you for my poor, poor papa's
<PB N="39" REF="025208_0050_0FCCA2C66D816230"/>
sake!—Alas! if we are all killed, his heart will break!—Oh! they can't be rocks and stones!—Don't cry mamma, they will spare us!</Q>—Thus the little orator endea∣voured to console her afflicted mother; but their melancholy endearments were soon in∣terrupted by the relentless savages, who hav∣ing plundered the house of every valuable thing that was portable, returned to MARIA, and rudely catching her arm, commanded her to follow them but repulsing them with the bold∣ness of despair, "Leave me, leave me," she said.
<Q>I cannot go—I never will quit my murdered child! Too cruel in your mercies, you have given me life only to prolong my miseries!</Q>—Meanwhile the lovely ANNA, terrified at the hostile appearance of the enemy, left her mamma struggling to disengage her∣self from the Indians, and fled p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cipitately to the house. She had already concealed he self in a closet, when Mrs. KITTLE pursuing her, was intercepted by flames, the savages having fired the house. The wretched child soon dis∣covered her depl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>able situation, and almost suf∣focated by the smoke, with piercing cries called for help to her dear, dear mother.—Alas!
<PB N="40" REF="025208_0051_0FCCA2C875F61640"/>
what could the unhappy parent do? who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e shee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ames rolled between them, while in a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of grief she screamed out,

<Q>Why do you not attempt to rescue my sweet innocent? can your unfeeling hearts not bear to leave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e one—a solitary single one?</Q>
Again calling to her ANNA, she received no answer, which being a presumption of her death, the Indians obliged MARIA and her brother HEN∣RY to quit the house, which they effected with some difficulty, the glowing beams falling a∣round them and thick volumes of smoke ob∣scuring their passage. The flames now struck a long splendor through the humid atmosphere, and blushed to open the tragical scene on the face of heaven. They had scarce advanced two hundred yards with their reluctant captives, when the flaming structure tumbled to the earth with a dreadful crash. Our travellers by in∣stinct
<PB N="41" REF="025208_0052_0FCCA2CA2A2B0758"/>
turned their eyes to the mournful blaze; and MARIA, bursting afresh into grievous la∣mentations, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ied,
<Q>There, there my brother, my children are wrapt in arching sheets of flames, that used to be circled in my arms they are entombed in ruins that breathed their slumbers on my bosom! yet, oh! their spotless souls even now rise from this chaos of blood and fire, and are pleading our injur∣ed cause before our God, my brother!</Q>
He replied only in sighs and groans; he scarcely heard her; horror had froze up the avenues of his soul; and all amazed and tremblings, he fol∣lowed his leaders like a person in a troublesome dream.</P>
<P>The distant flames now cast a fainter light, and the northern breeze bent the columns of smoke over the south horizon. Sad and be∣nighted they wandered through almost impe∣netrable swamps, forded the broad stream of <HI>Tomhanick</HI> and the rapid river of <HI>Hosack</HI>; they passed through deserted settlements, where the yelling of solitary dogs increased the solemnity of midnight, nor halted till the stars, emitting a feebler lustre, presaged the approach of day. MARIA, overcome by s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>row and fatigue, im∣mediately
<PB N="42" REF="025208_0053_0FCCA2CBA3FF7828"/>
sunk helpless at the foot of a tree, while the savages (who were six in number) kindled a fire, and prepared their meal, (in a calabash) which consisted only of some parched maize pulverized and enriched with the fat of bears flesh. Observing MARIA had fallen asleep, they offered not to disturb her, but in∣vited HENRY KITTLE to partake of their re∣past. He durst not refuse them; and having swallowed a few mouthfuls of their unpalatable food, and accepted of a pipe of tobacco, he de∣sired leave to repose himself, which being rea∣dily granted, they soon followed his example, and sunk asleep, leaving two centinels to guard against surprise, which precaution they always make use of.</P>
<P>I am sorry, dear SUSAN, to quit MARIA in this interesting part of her history; but order requires that we should now return to her spouse, whom we left on his way through the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood.</P>
<P>The village of <HI>Sch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hticook</HI> is situated on a circular plain, surrounded by high hills, rising in form of an amphitheatre. Mr. KITTLE had just gained the verge, when, chancing to cast his eyes around, he perceived the whole south∣ern
<PB N="43" REF="025208_0054_0FCCA2CD9E396D40"/>
hemisphere suddenly illuminated with a bright blaze; however, being accustomed to the forest's being often fired to clear it from the under-wood, he was not much surprised, but proceeded to descend the hill. On his arriving with the account of his brother's murder, the place was put in the highest commotion; the men fitting up their arms, and the women cla∣mouring about them, highly importunate to be removed to <HI>Albany</HI>; but the night being very dark, this manoeuvre was deferred till morn∣ing; no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could Mr. KITTLE prevail on a single person to return with him during the darkness he felt himself strangely agitated at this disap∣pointment, and refusing to repose himself, with great impatience he watched the first orient beam of Phosphor, which appearing, he fat off for home with two waggons and a guard of three Indians. As he approached his late happy dwelling, his bosom dilated with the pleasing hope of soon extricating his beloved family from danger; he chid the slowness of the carriages, and felt impatient to dissipate the apprehensions of MARIA, to kiss the pendant tear from her eye, and press his sportive inno∣cents to his bosom. While these bright ideas
<PB N="44" REF="025208_0055_0FCCA2CEE2EF9698"/>
played round his soul, he lifted up his eyes, and through an opening in the woods beheld his farm: but what language can express his surprise and consternation at seeing his habita∣tion so suddenly desolated! a loud exclamation of amaze burst from the whole company at so unexpected a view—the blood revolted from Mr. KITTLE's cheek—his heart throbbed un∣der the big emotion, and all aghast, spurring on his horse, he entered the inclosure with full speed.—Stop here unhappy man! here let the fibres of thy heart crack with excruciat∣ing misery—let the cruel view of mangled wretches, so nearly allied to thee, extort drops of blood from thy cleaving bosom!—It did— it did. Uttering a deep groan he fell insensible from his horse, while his attendants, hastening towards him, were shocked beyond concep∣tion at the dismal spectacle; and, starting back with averted eyes from the dead, were thun∣der struck, not having power to move or speak. After awhile two Indians (who being used to sanguinary scenes, recovered them∣selves first) took a blanket, and walking back∣ward to the mangled COMELIA, threw it over her naked body; the others then timidly
<PB N="45" REF="025208_0056_0FCCA2D0303A40A0"/>
advanced, and Mr. KITTLE opening his eyes, groaned again bitterly; then raising himself on his knees, with a look of unutterable an∣guish, he called upon his dear MARIA. Alas! no voice but the solemn repetition of his own cries was articulated to him: then rising with an air of distraction, he stalked round the bloody scene, and examined the dead bodies; first uncovering the pale visage of COMELIA, he surveyed in silence her distorted features; but perceiving it was not MARIA, he gently laid the cloth over again, and turning furi∣ously, caught up his ghastly infant, whose little body was black with contusions, and his skull horribly fractured. Almost fainting un∣der his mournful load, and staggering at the dreadful discovery, he deposited it again on the bloody earth, and clapping his hands to∣gether repeatedly with violence,
<Q>O hell! hell!</Q>
he cried,
<Q>you cannot inflict tor∣ments so exquisite as those I now suffer! how am I crushed to the center! how deeply am I degraded below the worms of the sod! O my children! my children! where are you now? O my wife! my MARIA! the beloved of my bosom, are you
<PB N="46" REF="025208_0057_0FCCA2D1B3880058"/>
too fallen a sacrifice? Why do I survive these miseries, my God? how can mortality support them? Burst—burst my shrinking heart, and punish a wretch for not having died in the defence of such lovely and in¦nocent beings! Oh! why was I absent in this fatal hour? why did not their groans vibrate on my soul that I might have flown to their aid?</Q>
Thus wildly lamenting and wandering among the smoaking ruins, he picked up some of the calcined bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of his once beautiful ANNA. At this sight despair shook his soul afresh, new agonies convulsed his features, and dropping the sad evidence of his miseries, he extended his arms to Heaven, and roared out,
<Q>Revenge! great God! re∣venge if thou art just and kind as represent∣ed! Oh! that I had the power of an arch∣angel to thunder eternal horrors on the guilty wretches who have blasted the bud of my happiness, who have darkened the brightest eyes that ever opened on the light!</Q></P>
<P>The men here interfering, to console him observed, the bones were probably those of his brother PETER; but on finding his skeleton entire, Mr. KITTLE insisted that it must have
<PB N="47" REF="025208_0058_0FCCA2D36526A2A8"/>
been MARIA and ANNA, who, having hid themselves, had doubtless perished in the flames. Again, in the furious extravagance of passion, he tore the hair from his head, and casting himself p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>strate on the ashes, he gathered the crumbling bones to his bosom, while the big drops of anguish issued at every pore, till life, unable longer to sustain the mental con∣flict, suspended her powers, and once more deprived him of sensation. His companions having laid him on a waggon, now conferred together in what manner to proceed, and ap∣prehending an attack from the savages, they unanimously concluded to lay the dead bodies on the remaining carriage, and make the best of their way to <HI>Schochticook,</HI> which they ac∣cordingly performed with great silence and expedition.</P>
<P>You may judge, my dear, what a panic the appearance of this mournful cavalcade struck over the inhabitants of this defenceless village. Mr. KITTLE was gently laid on a bed, and being let blood, his respiration became less obstructed, though he continued senseless till his unfortunate family were interred. Six weeks elapsed before he recovered any degree
<PB N="48" REF="025208_0059_0FCCA2D4AA7B6978"/>
of strength; but even then he appeared pale and emaciated, like a second LAZARUS; his disposition was entirely changed, his looks were fierce, his attitudes wild and extravagant, and his conversation, which formerly was sensible, commanding attent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on by a musical voice, now was incoherent, and his cadence deep and hol∣low, rather inspiring terror than any pleasing sensation. Thirsting for revenge, and perceiv∣ing that solitude only tended to corrode his mo∣ments with the blackest melancholy, he soon after entered the British service in the capacity of gentleman volunteer, and signalized him∣self by his prudence and intrepidity, attract∣ing the particular notice of his officers, who being affected with his misfortunes, proffered their services to him with so much friendship and candour, as obliged him to accept of them, and yet lightened the obligation.</P>
<P>But doubtless, my dear, your generous sen∣sibility is alarmed at my silence about Mrs. KITTLE; I think we left her reposing under a tree: she was the first that awaked as the sun began to exhale the crystal globules of morning, when half rising, and reclining on her elbow, she surveyed the lovely landscape
<PB N="49" REF="025208_0060_0FCCA2D673C4E630"/>
around her with a deep sigh; they were on an eminence that commanded an unlimited pros∣pect of the country every way. The birds were cheerful; the dee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bounded fearless over the hills; the meadows blushed with the ena∣mel of FLORA: but grief had saddened every object in her sight; the whole creation seemed a dark blank to the fair mourner. Again re∣collection unlocked the sluices of her eyes, and her soft complaints disturbed her savage com∣panions, who, rising and kindling up the dying embers, began to prepare their victuals, which they invited her to partake of. This she de∣clined with visible detestation; and turning to her brother, with the dignity of conscious merit in distress, "No," said she,
<Q>I never will receive a morsel from those bloody hands yet dropping with recent murder!—let me pe∣rish—let the iron hand of famine first pinch out my vitals and send me after my chil∣dren!</Q>
Notwithstanding this, HENRY added his solicitations that she should accept of some refreshment, remi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>g her of the con∣sequence of her fatal resolution, which could be deemed no otherwise than suicide. Find∣ing this had no effect, he tried to touch her feelings on a softer key—
<Q>Remember, MA∣RIA,</Q>
<PB N="50" REF="025208_0061_0FCCA2D7A5768BB0"/>
said he,
<Q>you have a tender husband yet living; would you wish to deprive him of every earthly consolation? Would you add affliction to affliction, and after he has performed the sorrowful obsequies of his children, to crush all his remaining hope by the news of your voluntary death? No, live my sister! be assured he will soon get us exchanged, when soft sympathies shall wash away your sorrows; and after a few years, who knows but the smiles of a new lovely progeny may again dawn a paradise of happiness on you.</Q>
MARIA was affect∣ed, and half raising her eyes from the earth, she replied,
<Q>O my brother! how consoling do your words sink on my heart! though my reason tells me your arguments are im∣probable and fallacious, yet it soothes the tempest of my soul—I will try to live— perhaps I may again behold my dear, dear, dear husband!</Q>
Here a flood of tears inter∣rupted her.</P>
<P>As this conversation was held in English, the savages were inquisitive to know the sub∣ject of it, at the same time enjoining them both never to utter a syllable in their presence ex∣cept
<PB N="51" REF="025208_0062_0FCCA2D939FB1BF0"/>
in their own uncouth dialect, which, as they perfectly understood, they coul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not ex∣cuse themselves from. HENRY then informed them that his sister, objecting to their method of preparing food, had desired him to prevail with them to indulge her in dressing her meals herself. This they readily granted, and farther to ingratiate themselves in the prisoners' fa∣vour, they dispatched a young Indian to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at for partridges or quails in the groves ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng them: He instantly returned with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> wood-pigeons, scarcely fledged, which he p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣sented to HENRY, who cleaned and broiled them on sticks, with an officious solicitude to please his sister, which she observed with a look of gratitude, and taking a pigeon from the stick, began to eat more from complaisance than inclination. HENRY was delighted at her ready acquiescence, and their repast being end∣ed, they proceeded on their tiresome journey with less repining than the preceding night. MARIA was exempted from carrying a bur∣den, yet she found the fatigue almost intolera∣ble. They continually passed through a scene of conflagration, the savages firing every cot∣tage in their way, whose mournful blaze catch∣ing
<PB N="52" REF="025208_0063_0FCCA2DAB400AEE0"/>
the dry fields of grain, would scorch off hundreds of acres in a few moments, and form a burning path for their destroyers. As the sun advanced to his zenith, its rays beat fierce∣ly on our travellers, augmented by the crack∣ling flames around them; when meeting with a cool stream of water, MARIA was com∣manded to sit down (being over-heated) while the rest approached the rivulet: the Indian that guarded MARIA was stooping down to drink, when a loud rustling among the leaves and trampling of bushes attracted his attention; he listened awhile seemingly much alarmed, then starting up suddenly, he flew to MARIA, and caught hold of her hair, aiming his hatchet at her head: the consequence was obvious, and her fate seemed inevitable; yet, with a stoical composure, she folded her arms across, and waited the fatal stroke with perfect resigna∣tion; but while the weapon was yet suspended over her, chancing to look around, he perceived the noise to proceed from a large deer, whose antlers were entangled in the branches of a thicket. Though an uncivilized inhabitant of the forest, he blushed at his precipitancy, and returning the instrument of death to his
<PB N="53" REF="025208_0064_0FCCA2DC777D5280"/>
girdle, after some hesitation made this apology:
<Q>MARIA, this sudden discovery is well for you; I thought we had been pursued, and we never suffer our prisoners to be re-taken; however, I was imprudent to attempt your life before there was a probability of your being rescued▪</Q>
then desiring her to rise and drink, he quickly shot the deer, his associ∣ates helping him to skin it. Instead of quench∣ing her thirst she sat down pensive on the flow∣ery margin, casting he eyes carelessly on the stream: she knew not whether to esteem her late deliverance from death a happy provi∣dence or protraction of misery. Observing the spotted trout, and other fish, to dart spor∣tively across the water, she could not help exclaiming,
<Q>Happy! happy animals! you have not the fatal gift of reason to embit∣ter your pleasures; you cannot anticipate your difficulties by apprehension, or pro∣long them by recollection; incapable of of∣fending your Creator, the blessings of your existence are secured to you: Alas! I envy the meanest among ye!</Q>
A gush of tears concluded her soliloquy; and being called to attend the company, she arose, and they began
<PB N="54" REF="025208_0065_0FCCA2DDDACC9880"/>
their journey for the afternoon. HENRY de∣siring to have a piece of venison (having left it behind, seldom incommoding themselves with more than the hide and tallow) they re∣turned and obliged him with a haunch, which was very fat: at the next interval of travel he dressed it for himself and MARIA. In the evening they crossed the river somewhat be∣low <HI>Fort-Edward,</HI> in a canoe left hid under some bushes for that purpose. They observed the most profound silence until they entered the woods again; but it was very late before they halted, which they did in a deep hollow, surrounded by pines whose tops seemed to be lost in the clouds. It was necessary here to light a fire, for the wolves howled most dread∣fully, and the whole forest rung with the cries of wild beasts of various sorts. The confines of hell could not have given MARIA more dismal ideas than her present situation: the horrid gloom of the place, the scowling looks of her murderous companions, the shrill shrieks of owls, the loud cries of the wolf, and mournful screams of panthers, which were redoubled by distant echoes as the terrible sounds seemed dying away, shook her frame
<PB N="55" REF="025208_0066_0FCCA2DF23854EB8"/>
with cold tremors—she sunk under the op∣pression of terror, and almost fainted in HENRY's arms; however, on perceiving the beasts durst not approach the light, but began to retire, she became a little more assured, and helped HENRY to erect a booth of pine branches, making a bed of the same materials in it while he prepared their supper: having eaten, and kindled a large fire in the front of her arbour, she laid down and soon fell in a deep sleep. She felt herself refreshed by this unexpected repose, and the next morning, with some alacrity, continued her journey, hoping at last to arrive at some Christian set∣tlement. Arriving at <HI>Lake-Champlain,</HI> they raised a wigwam on the bank, expecting the coming of Indians from the opposite shore to carry them over.</P>
<P>Here our unfortunate captives were stript of their habits, already rent to pieces by briers, and attired each with remnants of old blankets. In this new dress Mrs. KITTLE ventured to expostulate with the savages, but it was talk∣ing to the stormy ocean; her complaints serv∣ed only to divert them; so retiring among the bushes, she adjusted her coarse dress somewhat
<PB N="56" REF="025208_0067_0FCCA2E0A1923918"/>
decently, and then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ing herself silently un∣der a spreading tree, indulged herself in the luxury of sorrow. HENRY, sensible that they expected more fortitude from him, and that if he sunk under his adverse fortune he should be worse treated, affected to be cheerful; he assisted them in catching salmon, with which the lake abounds; an incredible quantity of wild fowl frequenting the lake also, he laid snares for those of the lesser sort, (not being allowed fire-arms) and succeeded so well, that his dexterity was highly commended, and night coming on, they regaled themselves on the fruits of their industry. The night was exceedingly dark, but calm; a thick mist ho∣vered over the woods, and the small ridgy waves softly rolled to the shore, when sudden∣ly a large meteor, or fiery exhalation, passed by them with surprising velocity, casting on every side showers of brilliant sparkles. At sight of this phenomenon the Indians put their heads between their knees, crying out in a la∣mentable voice, "Do not! do not! do not!" continuing in the same attitude until the va∣pour disappeared. HENRY, with some sur∣prise, demanded the reason of this exclama∣tion;
<PB N="57" REF="025208_0068_0FCCA2E2731FC0D8"/>
to which they replied,
<Q>What he had seen was a fiery dragon on his passage to his den, who was of so malevolent a tem∣per, that he never failed, on his arrival there, to inflict some peculiar calamity on man∣kind.</Q>
In about five minutes after the earth was violently agitated, the waves of the lake tumbled about in a strange manner, seem∣ing to emit flashes of fire, all the while attend∣ed with most tremendous roarings, intermixed with loud noises, not unlike the explosion of heavy cannon. Soon as the Indians perceived it was an earthquake, they cried out,
<Q>Now he comes home!</Q>
and casting themselves in their former posture, filled the air with dis∣mal howlings. This was a terrible scene to MARIA, who had never been witness to so dreadful a convulsion of Nature before; she started up and fled from her savage companions towards an eminence at some distance, where, dropping on her knees, she emphatically im∣plored the protection of Heaven: however, she was followed by an Indian and HENRY; the latter, highly affected with her distresses, taking hold of her trembling hand,
<Q>But why, my sister!</Q>
said he,
<Q>have you fled from
<PB N="58" REF="025208_0069_0FCCA2E3A8879858"/>
us? is the gloom of a forest more cheering than the sympathising looks of a friend?</Q>
"No, my brother!" replied MARIA;
<Q>but the thought was suggested to me, that the supreme God perhaps was preparing to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enge himself of these murderers by some awful and uncommon judgment, and I fled from them as LOT did from <HI>Sodom,</HI> lest I might be involved in the punishment of their guilt.</Q>
They conversed in English, which displeasing the Indian, he ordered them to re∣turn to the wigwam, threatening to bind MA∣RIA fast if she offered to elope again. The shock being over, silence again spread through the realms of darkness, when a high wind arose from the north and chilled our half-naked travellers with excessive cold. The savages (whose callous skins were proof against the in∣clement weather) not caring to continue their fires, lest they should be discovered and sur∣prised by some English party, they passed here a very uncomfortable night; but the wind sub∣siding, and the sky growing clear, the sun rose peculiarly warm and pleasant, streaming ten thousand rays of gold across the lake. MARIA had scarcely performed her oraisons, when the
<PB N="59" REF="025208_0070_0FCCA2E5F608FA30"/>
savages, forming a circle round her and HENRY, began to dance in a most extravagant manner, and with antic gestures that at another time would have afforded mirth to our travellers. Having continued their exercise some time, they incontinently drew out boxes of paint, and began to ornament their captives with a variety of colours; one having crossed their faces with a stroke of vermilion, another would intersect it with a line of black, and so on until the whole company had given a specimen of their skill or fancy.</P>
<P>Soon after two canoes arrived, in which they passed over the lake, which was uncom∣monly serene and pleasant. They proceeded not far on their way before they were obliged to halt for two days, on account of MARIA's inability to travel, her feet being greatly swoln and lacerated by the flinty path. At length, by easy stages, they came in view of an Indian settlement, when MARIA's long unbent fea∣tures relaxed into a half smile, and turning to HENRY, "Here, my brother!" said she,
<Q>I shall find some of my own sex, to whom sim∣ple Nature, no doubt, has taught humanity; this is the first precept she inculcates in the
<PB N="60" REF="025208_0071_0FCCA2E81975D280"/>
female mind, and this they generally retain through life, in spite of every evil propen∣sity.</Q>
As she uttered this elogium in favour of the fair, the tawny villagers, perceiving their approach, rushed promiscuously from their huts with an execrable din, and fell upon the weary captives with clubs and a shower of stones, accompanying their strokes with the most virulent language; among the rest an old deformed squaw, with the rage of a Tisi∣phone, flew to MARIA, aiming a pine-knot at her head, and would certainly have given the wretched mourner her quietus had she not been opposed by the savage that guarded Mrs. KITTLE: he at first mildly expostulated with his passionate countrywoman; but finding the old hag frantic, and insatiable of blood, he twisted the pine-knot from her hand and whirled it away to some distance, then seizing her arm roughly and tripping up her heels, he laid her prostrate, leaving her to howl and yell at leisure, which she performed without a prompter.—MARIA was all in a tremor, and hastily followed her deliverer, not caring to risk another encounter with the exasperated virago. By this time the rage and tumult of

the savages subsiding, the new-comers were admitted into a large wigwam, in the center of which blazed a fire. After they were seated, several young Indians entered with baskets of green maize in the ear, which, having roasted before the fire, they distributed among the company.</P>
<P>Mrs. KITTLE and her brother complaining of the bruises they met with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their reception, an old Indian seemed to attend with great con∣cern; then leaving the place, in a little time returned with a bundle of aromatic herbs under his arm, the juice of which he expressed by rubbing them between two stones with flat surfaces; this he gave them to drink, applying the leaves externally. They instantly found relief from the medical quality of this extraor∣dinary plant, and composing themselves to sleep, expected a good night's repose; but they were mistaken, for their entertainers growing intoxicated with spirituous liquors, which ope∣rating differently, it produced a most compli∣cated noise of yelling, talking, singing, and quarrelling: this was a charm more powerful than the wand of Hermes to drive away sleep: but grown familiar with sorrow and disap∣pointment, MARIA regarded this as a trifle,
<PB N="62" REF="025208_0073_0FCCA2EAC6C71F68"/>
and when HENRY expressed his concern for her smiling, she replied,
<Q>We must arm our∣selves with patience, my brother! we can combat with fate in no other manner.</Q></P>
<P>It were endless to recapitulate minutely every distress that attended the prisoners in their tedious journey; let it suffice, that hav∣ing passed through uncommon misery, and im∣minent danger, they arrived at <HI>Montreal.</HI>— Here the savages were joined by several scalp∣ing parties of their tribe, and having previously fresh painted themselves, appeared in hideous pomp, and performed a kind of triumphal en∣try. The throng of people that came out to meet them, threw MARIA in the most painful sensations of embarrassment; but as the cla∣mours and insults of the populace increased, a freezing torpor succeeded, and bedewed her limbs with a cold sweat—strange chimeras danced before her sight—the actings of her foul were suspended—she seemed to move me∣chanically, nor recollected herself till she found she was seated in the Governor's hall, surrounded by an impertinent, inquisitive cir∣cle of people▪ who were inquiring into the cause of her disorder, without attempting any thing towards her relief. Discovering her
<PB N="63" REF="025208_0074_0FCCA2EBE8C1BB28"/>
situation, she blushingly withdrew to a dark corner from the public gaze, and could not help sighing to herself,
<Q>Alas! but a very few days ago I was hailed as the happiest of wo∣men—my fond husband anticipated all my desires—my children smiled round me with filial delight—my very servants paid me the homage due to an angel—O my God! what a sudden, what a deplorable transition! I am fallen below contempt!</Q>
As she thus moralized on her situation, an English woman (whom humanity more than curiosity had drawn to the place) approached MARIA, and observing her tears and deep dejection, took hold of her hand, and endeavoured to smile; but the soft impulses of nature were too strong for the efforts of dissimulation—her features instantly saddened again, and she burst into tears, exclaiming, (with a hesitating voice,)
<Q>Poor, forlorn creature! where are thy friends! perhaps the dying moments of thy fond parent, or husband, have been cruelly embittered with the sight of thy captivity! perhaps now thy helpless orphan is mourn∣ing for the breast which gave him nourish∣ment! or thy plaintive little ones are won∣dering
<PB N="64" REF="025208_0075_0FCCA2EDC6137350"/>
at the long ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> miserable mother.</Q>—"Oh! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> more!" interrupted MARIA;
<Q>your pity is severer than savage cruelty—I could stand the shook of fortune with some degree of firm∣ness, but your soft sympathy opens afresh the wounds of my soul! my losses are be∣yond your conjecture—I have no parent, no sportive children, and, I believe, no husband, to mourn and wish for me!</Q>
These words were succeeded by an affecting silence on both sides: meanwhile the Indians testified their impatience to be admitted to the Governor by frequent shouts; at length his Excellency appeared, and having held a long conference with the savages, they retired with his Secretary, and our prisoners saw them no more.</P>
<P>After their exit the Governor turning round to MARIA and HENRY, demanded who they were? Mrs. KITTLE's perplexity prevented her reply; but HENRY, in a most respectful manner, gave him a succinct account of their misfortunes. The Governor perceiving him sensible and communicative, interrogated him farther, but he modestly declined giving any
<PB N="65" REF="025208_0076_0FCCA2EEEB9C4A98"/>
political intelligence. Observing that MARIA suffered greatly in this interview, he soon con∣cluded it, after having presented several pieces of calicoes and stuffs to them, desiring they would accept what they had occasion for. Mrs. KITTLE immediately singled out a piece of black calimanco with tears of gratitude to her benefactor; who, smiling, observed she might chuse a gayer colour, as he hoped her distresses were now over. MARIA shook her head in token of dissent, but could make no reply. He then dismissed them, with a small guard, who was directed to provide them with decent lodgings.</P>
<P>HENRY was accommodated at a baker's, while his sister, to her no small satisfaction, found herself placed at the English woman's who, on her arrival, had expressed so much good nature. She had scarcely entered, when Mrs. D—, presenting her with a cordial, led her to a couch, insisting on her reposing there a little, "for," says she,
<Q>your waste of spirits requires it.</Q></P>
<P>This tenderness, which MARIA had long been a stranger to, relaxed every fibre of her heart: she again melted into tears; but it was a
<PB N="66" REF="025208_0077_0FCCA2F0C9583640"/>
gush of grateful acknowledgment, that called a modest blush of pleasure and perplexity on Mrs. D—'s cheek. Being left alone, she soon fell in a profound sleep; and her friend having prepared a comfortable repast, in less than an hour awaked her, with an invitation to dinner—
<Q>And how do you find yourself, my sister?</Q>
said she instinctively, seizing MARIA's hand and compressing it between her's;
<Q>may we hope that you will assist us in conquering your dejection?</Q>
—MARIA smiled benignly through a crystal atmosphere of tears, and kissing the hand of her friend, arose. Having dined, and being now equip∣ped in decent apparel, MARIA became the ad∣miration and esteem of the whole family. The tempest of her soul subsided in a solemn calm; and though she did not regain her vivacity, she became agreeably conversable.</P>
<P>In a few days, however, she felt the symp∣toms of an approaching fever. She was alarmed at this, and intimating to Mrs. D— her fears of becoming troublesome,
<Q>Do not be con∣cerned,</Q>
returned that kind creature;
<Q>my God did not plant humanity in my breast to remain there an inactive principle.</Q>
MA∣RIA
<PB N="67" REF="025208_0078_0FCCA2F244AB82C8"/>
felt her oppression relieved by this gene∣rous sentiment; and indeed found her friend∣ship did not consist in profession, as she inces∣santly tended her during her illness with in∣expressible delicacy and solicitude. When she was again on the recovery, Mrs. D— one day ordered a small trunk covered with Mo∣rocco leather to be brought before her, and opening it, produced several sets of fine linen, with some elegant stuffs and other necessaries. —"See," said she,
<Q>what the benevolence of <HI>Montreal</HI> has done for you. The ladies that beg your acceptance of these things, intend likewise to enhance the favour, by waiting on you this afternoon.</Q>—"Ah!" interrupted MARIA,
<Q>I want them not; this one plain habit is enough to answer the pur∣pose of dress for me. Shut the chest, my dear Mrs. D—, and keep them as a small compensation for the immense trouble I have been to you.</Q>—<Q>If this is your real sen∣timent,</Q>
replied her friend, (shutting▪ the chest, and presenting her the key,)
<Q>return your gifts to the donors; and since you will reward me for my little offices of friendship, only love me, and believe me disinterested,
<PB N="68" REF="025208_0079_0FCCA2F372891E58"/>
and I shall be overpaid.</Q>—<Q>I see I have wronged your generosity,</Q>
answered MA∣RIA.
<Q>Pardon me, my sister, I will offend no more. I did not think you mercenary— but—but—I meant only to disengage my heart of a little of its burden.</Q>—As this tender contest was painful to both parties, Mrs. D— rising abruptly, pretended some busi∣ness, promising to return again directly.</P>
<P>In the afternoon MARIA received her visi∣tants in a neat little parlour. She was dressed in a plain suit of mourning, and wore a small muslin cap, from which her hair fell in artless curls on her fine neck: her face was pale, though not emaciated, and her eyes streamed a soft languor over her countenance, more bewitch∣ing than the sprightliest glances of vivacity. As they entered she arose, and advancing, modestly received their civilities, while Mrs. D— handed them to chairs: but hearing a well-known voice, she hastily lifted up her eyes, and screamed out in an accent of sur∣prise,
<Q>Good Heaven! may I credit my sen∣ses? My dear Mrs BRATT, my kind neigh∣bour, is it really you that I see?</Q>
Here she found herself clasped in her friend's arms,
<PB N="69" REF="025208_0080_0FCCA2F5004847E8"/>
who, after a long subsiding sigh, broke into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears. The tumult of passion at length abating —"Could I have guessed, my MARIA," said she,
<Q>that you was here, my visit should not have been deferred a moment after your arri∣val; but I have mourned with a sister in affliction, (permit me to present her to you,) and while our hearts were wrung with each other's distress, alas! we inquired after no foreign calamity.</Q>
Being all seated,
<Q>I dare not,</Q>
resumed MARIA,
<Q>ask after your family; I am a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>id you only have escaped to tell me of them.</Q>—<Q>Not so, my sister,</Q>
cried Mrs. BRATT;
<Q>but if you can bear the recollection of your misfor∣tunes, do oblige me with the recital.</Q>
The ladies joined their intreaty, and Mrs. KITTLE complied in a graceful manner.</P>
<P>After some time spent in tears, and pleas∣ing melancholy, tea was brought in; and to∣wards sun-set Mrs. D— invited the com∣pany to walk in the garden, which being very small, consisted only of a parterre, at the far∣ther end of which stood an arbour covered with a grape-vine. Here being seated, after some chat on indifferent subjects, MARIA de∣sired
<PB N="70" REF="025208_0081_0FCCA2F6D9590768"/>
Mrs. BRATT, (if agreeable to the com∣pany) to acquaint her with the circumstances of her capture. They all bowed approbation; and after some hesitation Mrs. BRATT be∣gan:—</P>
<P><Q>My heart, ladies, shall ever retain a sense of the happiness I enjoyed in the society of Mrs. KITTLE and several other amia∣ble persons in the vicinage of <HI>Schochticook,</HI> where I resided. She in particular cheered my lonely hours of widowhood, and omit∣ted nothing that she thought might conduce to my serenity. I had two sons; she recom∣mended the education of them to my leisure hours. I accepted of her advice, and found a suspension of my sorrows in the execution of my duty. They soon improved beyond my capacity of teaching. RICHARD, my eldest, was passionately fond of books, which he studied with intense application. This naturally attached him to a sedentary life, and he became the constant instructive com∣panion of my evening hours. My youngest son, CHARLES, was more volatile, yet not less agreeable; his person was charming, his wit sprightly, and his address elegant.
<PB N="71" REF="025208_0082_0FCCA2F7EDB1FB98"/>
They often importuned me, at the com∣mencement of this war, to withdraw to <HI>Albany</HI>; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as I apprehended no danger, (the British troops being stationed above us, quite from <HI>Saratoga</HI> to the Lake) I ridicul∣ed their fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>One evening as my sons were come in from reaping, and I was busied in preparing them a dish of tea, we were surprised by a discharge of muskerry near us We all three ran to the door, and beheld a party of Indians not twenty paces from us. Struck with astonishment, we had no power to move; and the savages again firing that in∣stant, my CHARLES dropped down dead beside me. Good God! what were my emotions! But language would fail, should I attempt to describe them. My surviving son then turning to me, with a countenance expressive of the deepest horror, urged me to fly. "Let us be gone this instant," said he;
<Q>a moment determines our fate. O my mother! you are already lost.</Q>
But despair had swallowed up my fears; I fell shrieking on the body of my child, and rending away my hair, endeavoured to re∣call
<PB N="72" REF="025208_0083_0FCC8E95663C0278"/>
him to life with unavailing laments. RICHARD, in the meanwhile, had quitted me, and the moment after I beheld him mounted on horseback, and stretching away to the city. The Indians fired a volley at him, but missed, and, I flatter myself that he arrived safe. And now, not all my prayers and tears could prevent the wretches from scalping my precious child. But when they rent me away from him, and dragged me from the house, my grief and rage burst forth like a hurricane. I execrated their whole race, and called for eternal ven∣geance to crush them to atoms. After a while I grew ashamed of my impetuosity: the tears began again to flow silently on my cheek; and, as I walked through the forest between two Indians, my soul grew sudden∣ly sick and groaned in me; a darkness, more substantial than Egyptian night, fell upon it▪ and my existence became an insupport∣able burthen to me. I looked up to Hea∣ven with a hopeless kind of awe, but I murmured no more at the dispensations of my God; and in this frame of sullen resigna∣tion I passed the rest of my journey, which
<PB N="73" REF="025208_0084_0FCCA2FB091BAE28"/>
being nearly similar to Mrs. KITTLE's, I shall avoid the repetition of. And now per∣mit me (said she, turning to the French la∣dies) to acknowledge your extreme goodness to me. I was a stranger, sick and naked, and you took me in. You indeed have proved the good Samaritan to me, pouring oil and wine in my wounds.</Q>—<Q>Hush, hush! (cri∣ed Madame DE ROCHE,) you estimate our services at too high a rate. I see you are no connoisseur in minds: there is a great deal of honest hospitality in the world, though you have met with so little.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I now reject, (interrupted Mrs. BRATT,) all prejudices of education. From my in∣fancy have I been taught that the French were a cruel perfidious enemy, but I have found them quite the reverse.</Q></P>
<P>Madame DE R. willing to change the subject, accosted the other stranger,—<Q>Dear Mrs. WILLIS, shall we not be interested likewise in your misfortunes?</Q>—<Q>Ah! do, (added Mademoiselle V.) my heart is now sweetly tuned to melancholy. I love to indulge these divine sensibilities, which your affecting his∣tories are so capable of inspiring.</Q>—MA∣RIA
<PB N="74" REF="025208_0085_0FCCA2FC76DCD0A8"/>
then took hold of Mrs. WILLIS's hand, and pressed her to oblige them.—Mrs. WIL∣LIS bowed. She dropt a few tears; but as∣suming a composed look, she began:—</P>
<P><Q>I am the daughter of a poor clergyman, who being confined to his chamber by sick∣ness▪ for several years, amused himself by educating me. At his death, finding my∣self friendless, and without money, I ac∣cepted the hand of a young man who had taken a leased farm in Pennsylvania. He was very agreeable, and extravagantly fond of me. We lived happily for many years in a kind of frugal affluence. When the savages began to commit outrages on the frontier settlements, our neighbours, intimi∣dated at their rapid approaches, erected a small fort, surrounded by a high palisade. Into this the more timorous drove their cat∣tle at night, and one evening, as we were at supper, my husband (being ordered on guard) insisted that I should accompany him with the children (for I had two lovely girls, one turned of thirteen years, and an∣other of six months.) My SOPHIA assented to the proposal with joy.
<Q>Mamma▪
<PB N="75" REF="025208_0086_0FCCA2FE229EB390"/>
(said she,) what a merry woman the Cap∣tain's wife is; she will divert us the whole evening, and she is very fond of your com∣pany: come, I will take our little CHAR∣LOTTE on my arm, and papa will carry the lantern.</Q>
I acceded with a nod; and al∣ready the dear charmer had handed me my hat and gloves, when somebody thundered at the door. We were silent as death, and instantly after plainly could distinguish the voices of savages conferring together. Chil∣led as I was with fear, I flew to the cradle, and catching my infant, ran up into a loft. SOPHIA followed me all trembling, and panting for breath cast herself in my bosom. Hearing the Indians enter, I looked through a crevice in the floor, and saw them, with menacing looks, seat themselves round the table, and now and then address them∣selves to Mr. WILLIS, who, all pale and astonished, neither understood nor had power to answer them. I observed they took a great pleasure in terrifying him, by flourishing their knives, and gashing the table with their hatchets. Alas! this sight shot icicles to my soul; and, to increase my
<PB N="76" REF="025208_0087_0FCCA2FF6F02BE88"/>
distress, my SOPHIA's little heart beat against my breast, with redoubled strokes, at every word they uttered.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Having finished their repast in a glutti∣nous manner, they laid a fire-brand in each corner of the chamber, and then departed, driving poor Mr. WILLIS before them. The smoke soon incommoded us; but we dreaded our barbarous enemy more than the fire. At length, however, the flames be∣ginning to invade our retreat, trembling and apprehensive, we ventured down stairs; the whole house now glowed like a furnace; the flames rolled towards the stairs, which we hastily descended; but just as I sat my foot on the threshold of the door, a piece of timber, nearly consumed through, gave way, and fell on my left arm, which supported my infant, miserably fracturing the bone. I in∣stantly caught up my fallen lamb, and has∣tened to overtake my SOPHIA. There was a large hollow tree contiguous to our house, with an aperture just large enough to admit so small a woman as I am. Here we had often laughingly proposed to hide our chil∣dren, in case of a visit from the olive colour∣ed
<PB N="77" REF="025208_0088_0FCCA300E9C33538"/>
natives. In this we now took shelter; and being seated some time, my soul seemed to awake as it were from a vision of horror: I lifted up my eyes, and beheld the cottage that lately circumscribed all my worldly wealth and delight, melting away before the devouring fire. I dropt a tear as our apostate first parents did when thrust out from <HI>Eden.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>The world lay all before them, where to chuse their place of rest, and Providence their guide. Ah, EVE! thought I, hadst thou been like me, solitary, maimed, and unprotected, thy situation had been deplo∣rable indeed. Then pressing my babe to my heart,
<Q>How quiet art thou, my angel, (said I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) sure—sure, Heaven has stilled thy lit∣tle plaints in mercy to us.</Q>—<Q>Ah! (sobbed SOPHIA,) now I am comforted again that I hear my dear mamma's voice. I was afraid grief would have forever deprived me of that happiness.</Q>
And here she kissed my babe and me with vehemence. When her transports were moderated.
<Q>How cold my sister is, (said she,) do wrap her up warmer, mamma; poor thing, she is not used to such uncomfortable lodging.</Q></Q></P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="025208_0089_0FCCA3033AF68350"/>
<Q>The pain of my arm now called for all my fortitude and attention; but I forbore to mention this afflicting circumstance to my daughter.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The cheerful swallow now began to usher in the dawn with melody; we timidly pre∣pared to quit our hiding place; and turning round to the light, I cast an anxious eye of love on my innocent, wondering that she slept so long. But oh! horror and misery! I beheld her a pale, stiff corpse in my arms; (suffer me to weep, ladies, at the cruel re∣collection.) It seems the piece of wood that disabled me, had also crushed my CHAR∣LOTTE's tender skull, and no wonder my hapless babe was quiet. I could no longer sustain my sorrowful burden, but falling prostrate, almost insensible at the dreadful discovery, uttered nothing but groans. SO∣PHIA's little heart was too susceptible for so moving a scene. Distracted between her concern for me, and her grief for the loss of her dear sister, she cast herself beside me, and with the softest voice of sorrow, bewail∣ed the fate of her beloved CHARLOTTE— her sweet companion—her innocent, laugh∣ing
<PB N="79" REF="025208_0090_0FCCA304B16F6540"/>
play-fellow. At length we rose, and SOPHIA, clasping all that remained of my cherub in her arms,
<Q>Ah! (said she,) I did engage to carry you, my sister, but little did I expect in this distressing manner.</Q>
When we came in sight of the fort, though I endeavoured to spirit up my grieved child, yet I found my springs of action begin to move heavily, my heart fluttered, and I suddenly fainted away. SOPHIA▪ conclud∣ing I was dead, uttered so piercing a cry, that the centinel looking up, immediately called to those in the fort to assist us. When I recovered, I found myself in a bed encir∣cled by my kind neighbours, who divided their expressions of love and condolement between me and my child. I remained in the fort after this; but, ladies, you may think, that bereft as I was of so kind a husband and endearing child, I soon found myself soli∣tary and destitute. I wept incessantly; and hearing nothing from my dear WILLIS, I at length resolved to traverse the wilds of <HI>Canada</HI> in pursuit of him. When I com∣munica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed this to my friends, they all strong∣ly opposed it; but finding me inflexible,
<PB N="80" REF="025208_0091_0FCCA30628B75700"/>
they furnished me with some money and ne∣cessaries, and obtained a permission from the Governor to let me go under protection of a flag that was on the way. Hearing likewise that a cartel was drawn for an ex∣change of prisoners, I sat out, flushed with hope, and with indefatigable industry and painful solicitude, arrived at <HI>Montreal,</HI> worn to a skeleton (as you see ladies) with fatigue.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I omitted not to inquire of every officer, the names of prisoners who had been brought in. At length I understood that Mr. WIL∣LIS had perished in jail, on his first arrival, of a dysentery.—Here my expectations ter∣minated in despair. I had no money to re∣turn with, and indeed but for my SOPHIA no inclination—the whole world seemed dark and cheerless to me as the fabled re∣gion of Cimmeria, and I was nigh perishing for very want, when Mrs. BRATT, hearing of my distress, sought my acquaintance: she kindly participated my sorrows, and too— too generously shared her purse and bed with me. This, ladies, is the story of a broken-hearted woman, nor should I have intruded it in any other but the house of mourning.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="025208_0092_0FCCA307B3E998B8"/>Here she concluded, while the ladies se∣verally embracing her, expressed their ac∣knowledgments for the painful task she had complied with to oblige their curiosity.— "Would to Heaven!" said Madame DE R.
<Q>that the brutal nations were extinct, for never—never can the united humanity of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Britain</HI> compensate for the horrid cruelties of their savage allies.</Q></P>
<P>They were soon after summoned to an ele∣gant collation; and having spent best part of the night together, the guests retired to their respective homes.</P>
<P>During two years, in which the French ladies continued their bounty and friendship to Mrs. KITTLE, she never could gain the least intelligence of her husband. Her letters, after wandering through several provinces, would often return to her hands unopened. Despairing at length of ever seeing him, "Ah!" she would say to Mrs. D—,
<Q>my poor husband has undoubtedly perished, per∣haps in his fruitless search after me, and I am left to be a long—long burden on your goodness, a very unprofitable dependant.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="025208_0093_0FCCA3094CDD4620"/>In her friend's absence she would descend into the kitchen, and submit to the most me∣nial offices; nor could the servants prevent her; however, they apprised Mrs. D— of it, who seized an opportunity of detecting her at her labour. Being baffled in her humble attempt by the gentle reproaches of her indulgent pa∣troness, she sat down on the step of the door, and began to weep.
<Q>I believe, good Mrs. D—,</Q>
said she,
<Q>were you a hard task-master, that exacted from these useless hands the most slavish business, I could acquit my∣self with cheerfulness: my heart is like ice, that brightens and grows firmer by tempests, but cannot stand the warm rays of a kind. sun.</Q>
Mrs. D— was beginning to an∣swer, when hearing a tumult in the street, they both hasted to the door, and MARIA, casting her eyes carelessly over the crowd, in an instant recognized the features of her long-lamented husband, who sprang towards her with an un∣describable and involuntary rapture: but the tide of joy and surprise was too strong for the delicacy of her frame: she gave a faint excla∣mation, and stretching out her arms to receive him, dropped senseless at his feet. The suc∣cession
<PB N="83" REF="025208_0094_0FCCA30B70ED8728"/>
of his ideas was too rapid to admit describing. He caught her up, and bearing her in the hall, laid his precious burden on a settee, kneeling beside her in a speechless a∣gony of delight and concern. Meanwhile the spectators found themselves wonderfully affect∣ed—the tender contagion ran from bosom to bosom—they wept aloud; and the house of joy seemed to be the house of lamentation. At length MARIA opened her eyes and burst into a violent fit of tears—Mr. KITTLE, with answering emotions, silently accompanying her; then clasping his arms endearingly round her, "It is enough, my love," said he,
<Q>we have had our night of affliction, and surely this blessed meeting is a presage of a long day of future happiness; let me kiss off those tears, and shew by your smiles that I am indeed welcome.</Q>
MARIA then bending fondly forward to his bosom, replied, sighing,
<Q>Alas! how can your beggared wife give you a proper reception? she cannot restore your prattling babes to your arms—she comes a∣lone! Alas! her presence will only serve to remind you of the treasures—the filial delights you have lost!</Q>
—"God forbid,"
<PB N="84" REF="025208_0095_0FCCA30CE8608470"/>
answered he,
<Q>that I should repine at the loss of my smaller comforts, when so capital a blessing as my beloved MARIA is so won∣derfully restored to me.</Q>
Here he was in civility obliged to rise and receive the compli∣ments of Mrs. BRATT, Mrs. WILLIS, and Madame DE R—, who, hearing of his ar∣rival, entered just then, half breathless with impatience and joy. The company increas∣ed; an elegant dinner was prepared: in short, the day was devoted to pleasure; and never was satisfaction more general—festivity glow∣ed on every face, and complacency dimpled every cheek.</P>
<P>After tea MARIA withdrew in the garden, to give her beloved an account of what had be∣fallen her during their separation. The elo∣quence of sorrow is irresistible. Mr. KITTLE wept, he groaned, while all impassioned (with long interruptions of grief in her voice) she stammered through her doleful history; and yet she felt a great satisfaction in pouring her complaints into a bosom whose feelings were in unison with her's—they wept—they smiled —they mourned, and rejoiced alternately, with an abrupt transition from one passion to another.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="025208_0096_0FCCA30E66BD3C80"/>Mr. KITTLE, in return, informed her, that having thrown himself into the army, in hopes of ending a being that grew insupport∣able under the reflection of past happiness, he tempted death in every action wherein he was engaged, and being disappointed, gave himself up to the blackest melancholy.
<Q>This gloomy scene,</Q>
he observed,
<Q>would soon have been closed by some act of despera∣tion; but one evening, sitting pensive in his tent, and attentively running over the cir∣cumstances of his misfortunes, a thought darted on his mind that possibly his brother HENRY might be alive.</Q>
This was the first time the idea of any one of his family's surviving the general murder had presented it∣self to him, and he caught at the flattering sug∣gestion as a drowning wretch would at a plank. "Surely, surely," said he,
<Q>my brother lives—it is some divine emanation lights up the thought in my soul—it carries convic∣tion with it: I will go after him—it shall be the comfort and employment of my life to find out this dear brother—this last and only treasure.</Q>
Persuaded of the reality of his fancy, he communicated his design to a
<PB N="86" REF="025208_0097_0FCCA31015408188"/>
few of his military friends; but they only laughed at his extravagance, and strongly dis∣suaded him from so wild an undertaking. Be∣ing discouraged, he desisted; but shortly after, hearing that a company of prisoners (who were enfranchised) were returning to <HI>Quebec,</HI> he got permission to accompany them. After a very fatiguing journey he arrived at <HI>Mon∣treal,</HI> and was immediately introduced to the General Officer, who patiently heard his story, and treated him with great clemency. Hav∣ing obtained leave to remain a few days in town, he respectfully withdrew, and turning down a street he inquired of a man who was walking before him, where lodgings were to be let? The stranger turned about, civilly taking off his hat, when Mr. KITTLE, start∣ing back, grew as pale as ashes—
<Q>Oh, my God!</Q>
cried he, panting,
<Q>oh! HENRY, is it you! is it indeed you! No, it cannot be.</Q>
Here he was ready to fall; but HEN∣RY, with little less agitation, supported him; and a tavern being at hand, he led him in. The master of the hotel brought in wine, and they drank off many glasses to congratulate so happy a meeting. When their transports were
<PB N="87" REF="025208_0098_0FCCA31176489B40"/>
abated, HENRY ventured to tell him that his MARIA was living and well. This was a weight of joy too strong for his enfeebled pow∣ers—he stared wildly about. At length, re∣covering himself, "Take care, HENRY," said he, "this is too tender a point to trifle upon." —"My brother," replied HENRY,
<Q>be calm, let not your joy have a worse effect than your grief—they both came sudden, and it behoves a man and a christian to shew as much fortitude under the one as the other.</Q>
—<Q>Alas! I am prepared for some woeful de∣ception,</Q>
cried Mr. KITTLE; but, "HEN∣RY, this suspence is cruel."—<Q>By the eter∣nal God!</Q>
rejoined his brother,
<Q>your MARIA, your wife, is in this town, and if you are composed enough, you shall imme∣diately see her.</Q>
Mr. KITTLE could not speak—he gave his hand to HENRY, and while (like the Apostles friends) he believed not for joy, he was conducted to her arms, and found his bliss wonderfully real.</P>

<HEAD>THE STORY OF HENRY AND ANNE. FOUNDED ON FACT.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY and ANNE were born in <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> in the Marquisate of <HI>Bade<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> their pa∣rents dwelt contiguous to each other, and the most sentimental friendship subsisted between the two families. ANNE was graceful even in infancy; HENRY tall and majestie, strong and active, though not regularly beautiful their poverty early introduced them on the fields: their little hands were lacerated by the bearded grain, and their tender feet wounded by the asperities of a flinty soil. ANNE's lovely complexion soon lost its delicate white∣ness, but was amply recompensed by the bloom
<PB N="90" REF="025208_0100_0FCC8EB69044F290"/>
of luxuriant health. Whilst they toiled to∣gether in gathering the stones from the green surface of a meadow, or weeding the vines, the courtly passenger would stop and gave with pity to see so much elegance and beauty of form joined to the servility of unremitted la∣bour. HENRY redoubled his exertions con∣stantly to lessen little ANNE's fatigue; and when their task was done, they rejoined their companions, assisted them to complete their work, and with gleeful hearts sported them∣selves to sleep.</P>
<P>Nor were the old farmers displeased to see the growing affection between their children: "We shall soon be closer united," said they:
<Q>HENRY and ANNE (our only offspring) shall cement our friendship, and perpetuate our names to remotest centuries.</Q>
Alas! in the midst of this inchanting vision, an of∣ficer, attended by a file of musqueteers, de∣manded HENRY. He was now seventeen, full grown, and must enter his Lord's service. It was in vain to expostulate. Without a fare∣well sigh from ANNE, or scarce an embrace from his distracted parents, he must depart. Being escorted to a distant town, he was there
<PB N="91" REF="025208_0101_0FCC8EB7F4076988"/>
initiated into all the military manoeuvers, and three weeks after joined his regiment, which left that part of <HI>Germany</HI> soon after. HENRY's disappointed love sunk him into melancholy— he grew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>perate, and negligent of life. In a very warm action, being engaged with the enemy in sight of the General, he vent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red himself rashly, and fought without caution. It was called intrepidity, and he was advanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to the rank of serjeant. Having acquitted himself with honour, and the time of his ser∣vice being elapsed, his Captain gave him his discharge, with previous offe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> promotion if he would continue in his company.
<Q>I blush to decline my officer's generous pro∣posal,</Q>
said HENRY;
<Q>but it is better to be virtuous than fortunate— I have left three broken hearts at home, I must hasten to heal them—the soft voice of my ANNE calls me from the thunder of <HI>Bellona.</HI></Q>—"Go," said his commander in a softened tone,
<Q>I know what love is—my HENRY can be happy, I only great;</Q>
then dropping a tear,
<Q>Go HENRY—farewell—I know you de∣serve to be happier than I am.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="025208_0102_0FCC8EC335AD8BF0"/>The interview between the lovers was ten∣der and romantic.—ANNE, to console her HENRY's parents, remitted not her assiduities to please them. She cultivated their garden; she culled the richest fruit and brightest flowers to amuse them: her active fingers extended an imperceptible thread of flax to provide them linen of finer texture than the product of Egyptian looms: she resisted the importunity of HENRY's rivals heroically, while her old father, weeping for joy, commended her con∣stancy. "My child," said he,
<Q>thou art no disgrace to thy lineage; HENRY loves thee, he is worthy of thee, and worthy of every sacrifice thou canst make him; cheer up my little one, he will soon return.</Q>—<Q>No, my father, some inexorable shot will cleave his brave heart.</Q>
So saying, she rose agi∣tated from weeding a bed of lupins, when a foot soldier approached. Scarce had the old man civilly accosted the stranger over the hedge, when ANNE screamed out,
<Q>Oh heaven! father, it is our HENRY, our own HEN∣RY.</Q>—In an instant the family was con∣vened; from tears they made abrupt transitions to mirth, which soon caught the cars of the
<PB N="93" REF="025208_0103_0FCC8EC568BF51F8"/>
good neighbours, who came in crouds to feli∣citate the soldier's arrival. His parents invited them to return the next day and share the ge∣neral festivity, which they freely accepted, and assisted to slaughter the poultry and fattest lambs. The entertainment was truly pastoral. The tables were spread in the vineyard, be∣neath verdant arches that were impurpled by weighty clusters of grapes; a gushing fountain close by dispensed a delicious coolness, and bas∣kets of flowers filled the air with balmy sweet∣ness. To heighten the scene, the silvery airs of music, from the violin, harp, and melli∣fluous flute, softly circled through the sky. In short, a priest was called and our lovers married.</P>
<P>For two years peace and plenty were their houshold gods; but then HENRY seeing a fa∣mily increasing, began to reflect on the means of supporting them. He had no land, and had never been taught any mechanical branch of business; however, after taking advice, he purchased a small stock of merchandise, and prepared to follow the army. The good parents exhausted themselves to increase his commodities. "Be frugal and cautious, son,"
<PB N="94" REF="025208_0104_0FCC8EC6EC0E32C0"/>
said they; "remember ANNE and her babe." —"Ah!" cried HENRY, embracing them,
<Q>if I dishonour my parents, take ANNE from my bosom, give my paradise to a stranger, and let me die the death of a villain!</Q></P>
<P>HENRY visited his beloved friends frequent∣ly, but the army being stationed at a consider∣able distance from them, after an interval of three years, he sighed in absence near eleven months; he had accumulated eight hundred pounds in cash by extraordinary application, which compensated in some measure this pain∣ful separation, when he received a summons to return home. It seems his father-in-law had been dispossessed of his farm, through inabi∣lity to discharge his rent. The good old man retired with his child to HENRY's parents, where they were cordially received; but grief made insensible inroads in his constitution; in less than three weeks (having languished a few days) he died in ANNE's arms.</P>
<P>HENRY burst into tears at the news.
<Q>Cru∣el parent,</Q>
said he,
<Q>you knew my happy situation—why did you let the canker of disappointment abridge your days? my trea∣sure was your own—I am infinitely your
<PB N="95" REF="025208_0105_0FCC8EC86D8EB458"/>
debtor—I never yet earned my RACHEL.</Q>
—Having paid a tribute of sincere drops of gratitude and love, he sighed and went to bed; he slumbered, and saw his ANNE smile with joy at the gold and silver he poured at her feet: his little ones climbed his knees, and seemed to be delighted with the glitter of his treasures: his enamoured fancy called up every pleasing idea to sport round his innocent family, when he was suddenly awaked by four ruffians, who entered his tent well armed; and, advancing to his bed, bade him be silent, at the peril of immediate destruction. Regardless of their menaces, he started up and demanded their business; upon which they seized and bound him hand and foot, then fell to rummaging the tent. They soon discovered his money— what a glorious booty! In vain did he plead, soothe, and threaten.
<Q>Leave me a few pieces: leave me but a little, a very little, to carry me to my poor wife and children.</Q>
His rhetoric made no impression—they left him not a sous.</P>
<P>Being at some distance from the camp, his repeated calls for help were not heard; at length, in the silence of midnight, a centinel
<PB N="96" REF="025208_0106_0FCC8EC9F641BD70"/>
distinguished a mournful cry for assistance, and sent a couple of veterans to reconnoitre▪ HENRY, now relieved from corporeal con∣finement, began to feel his heart contracted and shrunk by ideas of approaching beggary. He looked round him; the whole creation seemed comfortless and desolate.
<Q>How shall I behold my domestic blessings? how shall I look ANNE in the face? would to God I had tilled some sterile spot of ground, we would have been content in indigence; na∣ture would have been satisfied with herbs and lentils. Cursed ambition to be rich has ruined me, and I am a traitor to my fami∣ly.</Q>
With these bitter reflections the day broke, and having collected the little furniture of his tent, he disposed of it to advantage to the humane soldiery, who universally loved him and pitied his misfortunes. Having se∣cured his cash in a small bag, he set off with a reluctant step for home. In vain did the birds carol on the elms that shaded the road. In vain did the ploughman whistle gleefully, and the lambs wanton o'er the green hillocks. No enlivening scene could dissipate his melan∣choly.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="025208_0107_0FCC8ED9B002B5E0"/>He protracted his journey through fear of being too soon the messenger of ill tidings. On the second day at noon, having bought a loaf of bread, he sat down by a rivulet to eat; his tears flowed apace, and he began to deli∣berate whether he should return to ANNE or not. He counted his little store, and fell list∣less on the grass through despondency. While thus he lay sadly ruminating, a handsome cou∣ple (thinking themselves unobserved) passed through the bushes. "Alas!" said the man,
<Q>for six years my EMMA you have sustained the most bitter poverty with your unfortu∣nate husband. My heart breaks under the oppression of your misery; I cannot bear it —return I beseech you, to the Baron; ask his fatherly forgiveness; he will reinstate you to favour—and lovely EMMA I shall die content.</Q>—"I smile," replied the fair one,
<Q>at your ignorance: gold and gems and banquets have no charms for me; my heart was formed for social happiness; I love you, and deprived of your company I should languish and die, whereas I feel no uneasiness at the absence of riches; we have enough to subsist comfortably on,
<PB N="98" REF="025208_0108_0FCC8EDB284D42C0"/>
though it be coarse; so pray, my dear, drop this unwelcome delicacy.</Q>
Here they went out of hearing, and HENRY, struck with the lady's sentiments, began to resume courage. "I am ashamed," said he,
<Q>at my want of fortitude; here is voluntary po∣verty accepted in preference of an anxious mind: surely ANNE will have as much philosophy in that article as the unfortunate EMMA: what a destruction have I escap∣ed! had I wandered away from my desolate family, we had all been miserable indeed.</Q>
So thinking, he took his pack on his shoulders and proceeded or his journey.</P>
<P>The fourth evening, passing leisurely by his deceased parent's door, he involuntarily turned back and walked in. Here his feelings received a new shock. Strange faces accosted him—rudeness and dirt had usurped the place where ANNE once reigned the goddess of ci∣vility and neatness. The green inclosure, surrounded by jessamine, was trampled on by swine, and lean cattle browzed on the vines that mantled over ANNE's window. He turn∣ed with grief and disgust from this mortifying scene, and had gone but a little farther, when
<PB N="99" REF="025208_0109_0FCC8EDE182C04D0"/>
ANNE descrying him at a distance, flew like a bird across the meadow, and fell into his arms. After the first emotions of transport were subsided, HENRY affectionately em∣braced his lovely babes and tender parents, who met him on the road.
<Q>I miss but one from this beloved company,</Q>
said HENRY. —ANNE burst into tears.
<Q>My HENRY, you will miss the chief of our good neigh∣bourhood—our indulgent old Lord is dead; his tyrannical heir oppresses his tenants with heavy rents and severe exactions, and they have unanimously agreed to shelter them∣selves from this great burden, by flying to the wilds of <HI>America.</HI></Q></P>
<P>After they were seated in the house,
<Q>What your spouse advances,</Q>
said the old man,
<Q>is true; and your aged parents would have also been forced to venture their trembling limbs and grey hairs over the dangerous ocean, had not our blessed HENRY's indus∣try secured us a competency.</Q>
This trial was too severe. HENRY changed counte∣nance, and cast his eyes around with an alarming wildness.
<Q>What is the matter with my child?</Q>
cried his mother. Alas!
<PB N="100" REF="025208_0110_0FCC8EF4E2BF8200"/>
this encounter was too sudden.
<Q>Old and experienced as I am, I feel almost over∣come with joy myself.</Q>—"Ah!" ex∣claimed her son (recollecting himself)
<Q>fain would I conceal from such endearing friends the motive of my distress; but I should ex∣pire in the effort: forgive and pity a wretch who brings home nothing but misery— who can see his family fall to ruin, and yet live.</Q>—All astonished they gazed at each other in silence, while HENRY sobbed, un∣able to articulate a word. At length ANNE, all shining through tears, drew nigh and kneeled before him—
<Q>Keep us not in sus∣pence, my husband; pour your griefs into our bosoms, and wrong us not by reserve; you can never bring misery to us whilst you remain virtuous and loving as now.</Q>— HENRY clasped the sad orator with passionate fondness in his arms; and after a little hesita∣tion acquainted them with the particulars of his misfortune.</P>
<P>It was in vain to try to conceal their surprise and disoppointment, though HENRY's afflic∣tion forbad them to fall into repining, or any expression of discontent. By degrees their
<PB N="101" REF="025208_0111_0FCC8EF6C61EA298"/>
chagrin subsided. The poor acquiesce with greater resignation to calamity than the rich, who seldomer meet with disappointment. At last, by an insensible gradation, our pensive associates became blest and easy. A small re∣past was provided, and shutting out corrosive Care, they indulged the hour of festivity with as much glee as if the robbers had restored the money ten fold.</P>
<P>The story of HENRY's robbery was soon known, and his parents concluded that their Lord would shew some lenity to them; but finding him invariably cruel and oppressive, they began to attend to the flattering informa∣tions about the New World.—"At least," said ANNE,
<Q>we shall go into a land of sim∣plicity—the artless savages subsist not by rapine and deceit: pride and hypocrisy and avarice are strangers where luxury and titles are unknown.</Q>—The old man dis∣sented from this opinion.
<Q>Wherever the print of human footsteps have appeared, there certainly, my child, all human vices follow, though often under different appel∣latives; however, we must hazard this ad∣venture. As the Lepers said at <HI>Samaria</HI>▪
<PB N="102" REF="025208_0112_0FCC8EF822318270"/>
if we stay here we shall certainly perish, and if we go away, at the worst, we can but die.</Q></P>
<P>The ensuing week, as they were merrily chatting on the green before the door, a sud∣den cloud overspread the heavens with black∣ness, which soon fell in a torrent of rain, in∣termingled with thunder and lightning. The family retired in the house; but HENRY hast∣ed to drive the cattle and sheep to a place of security. All wet and dropping with rain he was returning to the house, when an elegant phaeton, attended by a number of domestics, stopped at the gate. A gentleman handed out a lady, who seemed much affrighted with the storm, and conducted her, with a delicate ten∣derness, to the door. HENRY opened it wide, and bowing to the ground, desired them to walk in, presenting them each with a chair. The noble air, and rich dresses of the new guests, awed our humble rustics, who scarcely durst lift up their eyes at them, until the gen∣tleman, saluting the lady, inquired how his fair EMMA did after her fright. HENRY then instantly recollecting the lady's countenance, with a modest apology for his boldness, re∣counted
<PB N="103" REF="025208_0113_0FCC8EF9479A9820"/>
his adventure at the brook—<Q>I pre∣sume,</Q>
added he,
<Q>this lady is the very same lovely EMMA whose noble disinterested∣ness made me blush at my want of fortitude, and in effect saved my family from ruin.</Q>
Here EMMA, starting up, seized his hand—
<Q>I little thought, my kind friend, that our conversation had an auditor at that time▪ but since you have been a witness of my distress, rejoice with me in my present hap∣py situation.</Q>
He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> resuming her seat, while her spouse hung enamoured over her chair, she favoured the attentive circle with an abridgment of her history.—</P>
<P><Q>I am the only child of the present Baron of <HI>Schauffhousen,</HI> who was particularly cau∣tious that my education should render me up an accomplished lady to the world. On my first introduction into the <HI>grande monde,</HI> I found myself encompassed by admirers, whose addresses I permitted from vanity; but advancing to my twentieth year, my father grew solicitous that I should select a husband from the number. It was in vain to remonstrate to him that my heart was dis∣engaged. He insisted on my accepting a
<PB N="104" REF="025208_0114_0FCCA31606233290"/>
partner for life.</Q>—<Q>Chuse, my child, (said he,) throughout all the empire: you can ennoble a peasant by your alliance with him, or cast a new lustre over the escut∣cheon of a prince.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Seven months after this I became ac∣quainted with my present husband; and not doubting but that the Baron would accede to our union, I permitted the most violent love to steal into my bosom. I acquainted him in a dutiful and affectionate manner of my attachment, to which he made no reply; but turning from me with a stern look (to my surprise) shut his closet door full in my face.</Q>
In ten minutes I received this note—</P>
<LETTER>
<P>If you are determined, Miss, to debase the nobility of your birth, by a marriage with your present object, I renounce you forever. Take your jewels and clothes, and be miserable.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>LODOVICUS STRELITZ.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><Q>I wept incessantly on the perusal of this cruel billet. I wrote one to my lover, de∣siring him to forget me; but before I could dispatch it, my cousin CHARLOTTE enter∣ed
<PB N="105" REF="025208_0115_0FCCA3176C1E99F8"/>
the room in great confusion.</Q>
<Q>Begone, EMMA,</Q>
said she,
<Q>your father is exas∣perated to a degree of madness. He bide me to give you this purse of pistoles, and commands you to quit the castle instantly.</Q>
—"Alas!" said I, sinking on the floor,
<Q>I sacrifice my love to my duty. My dear cousin, tell my old parent I am no longer a rebel to his will.</Q>
Here I wept bitter∣ly;
<Q>but the cruel CHARLOTTE called out, Here, JOSEPH, if the chaise is ready, hand your young lady in. I am commissioned, dear EMMA, to wait on you to another lodging. The angry Baron is from home, and I forfeit his favour if I do not oblige you to submit.</Q>—I then rose from my
<Q>knees, and sullenly giving my hand to her, said faintly,
<Q>I see, CHARLOTTE, you have supplanted me; your undermining arts have ruined me.</Q>
She made no reply, and I suffered myself to be conducted to the chaise. In two hours we came to a neat farm-house. CHARLOTTE formally took leave of me, and I was shewn to a small, clean apartment, where, in a fit of agonizing des∣pair, I threw myself upon a little bed.
<PB N="106" REF="025208_0116_0FCCA318E924F580"/>
The woman of the house, coming in, in∣formed me that CHARLOTTE had advanced the pay for my year's board at her house; and concluding I was some refractory child, gave me a long lecture on obedience to pa∣rents. I scarcely heard her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After a few days I wrote to my father. I begged the intercession of my relations, but in vain; CHARLOTTE had stopped up every avenue to mercy. Finding myself rejected totally, I at length yielded to the emotions of a soft passion, and accepted the hand of my present husband. We lived happily during six years, when, being seized with a pleu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isy, my physician made a report of my danger and poverty to my father. We had a small hut on the common. The Baron's coach drove up to the door. He stooped as he entered, and walked cautious∣ly over the loose uneven floor of my poor bed-room. I rose up surprised to see him; and as I sat leaning against a pillow, the old man, in a gush of grief and remorse, fell on my bed sobbing and unable to speak. My two little ones seeing me weep, came up with visible concern. The eldest kissed
<PB N="107" REF="025208_0117_0FCCA31AA52074A0"/>
my hand and said,
<Q>Don't cry any more, mamma, Mrs. MORELY has sent us bread and milk enough for two days.</Q>
Here the Baron redoubled his sighs and seemed nearly suffocated, when I feebly bent towards him. O my father! am I then forgiven?</Q>
But
<Q>what he replied I know not—I fainted on the pillow. To be short, he took us all home. CHARLOTTE's indiscretions drew the odium of the family on her, and a bro∣ken lieutenant carried her off to <HI>England.</HI> My father became excessively fond of my spouse and children, and we are now upon a visit to an old aunt, who lays a dying, and to whom I am sole heiress. My friends,</Q>
<Q>continued she, <Q>I see by your looks my history is not impertinent, and I acknow∣ledge myself yet indebted to HENRY for his obliging partiality to me.</Q></Q></P>
<P>ANNE, with pleased looks, immediately spread a table with a clean diaper cloth, and placed on it several earthen plates, filled with the most delicious fruits, some biscuits, a plate with honey-combs, and a flask of wine; while HENRY, bowing low, thanked the lady for the honour she had done him.
<Q>I bless the Almighty,</Q>
said HENRY,
<Q>for so signally
<PB N="108" REF="025208_0118_0FCCA31C6A402598"/>
rewarding virtue. I even rejoice that the Baron's cruelty gave your excellent qualities an opportunity to shine out so philosophical∣ly in the test of poverty. Believe me, Ma∣dam, the lustre of many a soul lies hidden beneath the splendor of affluence, like the Grand Duke's gems in the green vault.</Q>
The gentleman smiled—<Q>And many a senti∣mental mind, my HENRY,</Q>
said he,
<Q>is circumscribed by poverty, and is of little utility to mankind beyond the limits of his own family. I heartily wish you, my friend, a fortune equal to your merit; in the mean∣while accept this trifle,</Q>
handing him a purse with twenty pistoles. HENRY, amid the highest confusion of blushing gratitude, re∣ceived the gift gracefully, and pressed his be∣nefactors to accept of his little regale. When they had eat, the sun began to shine out with new lustre after the rain, and EMMA proposed to proceed on their journey. She took a ten∣der leave of HENRY, and kissing ANNE, stept into the carriage, which instantly drove out of sight.</P>
<P>Soon after this agreeable interview, they prepared for their long voyage. The pensive
<PB N="109" REF="025208_0119_0FCCA31D6E0D13E8"/>
neighbours assembled, and having delivered their ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle to the Marquis's steward, they all embarked in a small vessel on the <HI>Rhine.</HI> After a tedious sail down the river, they were taken aboard a ship bound for <HI>New-York,</HI> in <HI>America.</HI> A fair wind sprung up; they soon lost sight of the Imperial shores, and found themselves sur∣rounded by a horizon of waters. The poor cottagers viewed the uncommon scene with pleasure, mixed with dread; but in a few days were accustomed to the prospect, and great agitation of the vessel. HENRY, to lessen the expence, had conditioned to work out his pas∣sage; but he could procure only very indiffe∣rent accommodations for his family, the ship being so crouded. After a few weeks sail ANNE's eldest son sickened and died, and the mournful parents, with agonizing hearts, com∣mitted the babe of their hopes, the darling of their bosoms, to the waves.
<Q>There sinks my child,</Q>
cried ANNE, weeping,
<Q>in the depth of the wild ocean: instead of slumber∣ing in my arms, he is gone to be the food of sea monsters.</Q>
HENRY supported and comforted her.
<Q>We have another, my beloved; let us not sin away the only re∣maining
<PB N="110" REF="025208_0120_0FCCA31EE4D64088"/>
little one by fruitless repinings; our son is ascended to his Creator; it is not him that welters in the deep: O! grieve not that he is taken from the evil to come; from evils which we shall yet sorrow over! Wisely and mercifully has Providence pro∣portioned our sufferings to our strength, and given the lenient hand of Time power to mollify those griefs he cannot cure.</Q>
In a little space ANNE's sorrows sunk into a lan∣guid serenity. She began to smile as usual, and HENRY was happy.</P>
<P>They had a tedious passage; but at length, one moonshine night, the sailors cried out, "land!" In a moment they all crouded upon deck: it was very calm, and near day: a gen∣tle south breeze arose soon after, and by sun∣rise they clearly distinguished the little islands covered with verdure, and the white beach on the bold continent. As they sailed up the Narrows, with a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir wind, the strangers admired the beauty of the country, which they little expected to find so well cultivated. When they were anchored in the harbour, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> requested a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll-boat to go on shore; upon whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> an Engli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h sail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r offered his assist∣ance,
<PB N="111" REF="025208_0121_0FCCA3721FB251A0"/>
rallying him a little;
<Q>Why, demme brother, these people can't understand your gibberish; they will set you in the stocks for a Jesuit.</Q>
They got on shore, and the sailor procured for HENRY's little family a de∣cent apartment in Beaver-street. HENRY ex∣pressed his acknowledgments to the generous sailor, for he really found he should never have been able, in his uncouth broken language, to make the people understand him.</P>
<P>Here HENRY left his little family while he went to seek a spot on the vacant lands of this state, where he might accommodate them. He sailed with a Dutch skipper to <HI>Albany,</HI> and being informed by him where he might find such a place as he wished for, he set off early the morning after his arrival on foot.

<P>The sun was setting when they entered the beautiful village of <HI>Tomhanick.</HI> The farmers had finished their daily task, and were smoak∣ing by their doors, while the younger tribe gamboled on the green before them: the blush of health hung careless on every cheek, and content smoothed every brow. FREDERICK invited the cottagers home with him; and as they were seated round a table covered with the fruits of the season, he related to them the history of HENRY's life. The good people were affected by the recital of his misfortunes, and promised to assist him.

<P>WHEN I had wrote you my last narra∣tive of distresses, I was afraid I had discouraged you, by my complaints, from continuing a cor∣respondence so pleasing to me. My soul was then responsive only to the voice of grief, and the whole world seemed cheerless to me as the fabled region of Cimmeria. The tempest of my soul has again subsided: But, my dear, as you desire to know how we are circumstanced, in compliance with your request, I must again wound your feelings with a lamentable story: therefore, sadden your countenance according∣ly; and I stipulate, that between every para∣graph you shall pause and make a moral re∣flection.</P>

You may guess (but 'tis likely you will not) that our disorder on this exceeded the confusion of AGRAMONTA's camp: every thing topsey-turvy, every one hurrying to se∣crete some little bundle in an unsuspected va∣cancy, and one dreadful apprehension expel∣ling another; for SUSAN and I ventured up in a loft without light, where spectres have been gamboling for at least a dozen centuries—by report.</P>
<P>We still remain greatly alarmed, and never undress for bed. However, we have passed the preceding season in security and pleasure▪ we have frequently had sociable dances, which by way of eminence we stile a ball.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR COUSIN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letter was more acceptable to me than the smiles of the returning spring after this long rigid winter; (and indeed your silence contributed to make it more tedious.) But I wonder what caprice of fortune intercepts all my epistles: surely she owes you several volu∣minous pacquets which I committed to her care. And since I am in a vein of wondering, I wonder how you could be so long ignorant of the place of our KITTY's residence: her stay with us was short; the charming city tempted her away: but shortly after she emi∣grated to <HI>Halfmoon,</HI> five miles from here, where she remains.</P>
<P>As to myself, I have but little to inform you, unless it should be the history of my heart, and even in that there is no novelty. I love the same persons, the same amusements, the same opinions I did ten years ago. But my affection is almost become a painful sensation to me; for, except my dear little family, all my friends are dead, or far, far absent. This, the poet observes, is the perquisite of long life: but my days have been evil and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew▪ I find no

disposition towards new attachments; and if but a few more of those I love drop from me, I shall be left a wretched individual as I began.</P>
<P>How shall I apologize, my cousin, for writ∣ing in this strain to a fair lady who would chuse to hear of none but metaphorical deaths, and innocent murders caused by her eyes? I will exclude these heavy ideas, and be gay to please my sprightly correspondent.</P>
<P>I believe Hymen likes a southern clime: our northern blasts would blow out his torch: but I hope he will return with the Zephyrs, to legitimate several premature children in our neighbourhood, which Love has produced in his absence. I hear of but one marriage round here this winter. Our girls begin to tremble. I believe I must send the following advertise∣ment to LOUDON:—</P>

JEREMIAH did at the removal of the camp.

<P>But, my dear, I have been considering in what manner you will accommodate your∣selves again to the silent and soft melancholy of a rural scene.

This I would by no means admit, assuring him you were a superior order of beings to our common chit-chat females, wishing him no greater punishment for his rash judgment than once to be exposed to an electrical glance from your fine azure eyes.

<P>We live perfectly retired, and see very lit∣tle company at present, as the ladies in our vicinage are busy hoeing their corn and plant∣ing potatoes. As we are not quite so well cal∣culated for this rural employment, we left the sun-burnt daughters of Labour yesterday, and went on pilgrimage to the <HI>Half-Moon,</HI> to visit Mrs. P****s.

<SALUTE>MY DEAR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Could not see the folly and deformity of my impetuous behaviour this morning, while blinded by passion; but after you was gone, when I felt lonesome, and had leisure for re∣flection, when my fever returned, and I mis∣sed that tender solicitude which always allevi∣ated my pain when you was near, I cannot de∣scribe

how exquisite a compunction seized me; I have been lost the whole day in sorrow. Good God! how inconsistent is the human mind! obstinate in passion, and stormy as the <HI>Caspian</HI>; then again soft and yielding to per∣suasion, as snow before the warm influence of a summer heaven; and yet perhaps this great agitation of the spirits is meant to keep them from subsiding into a state of insensibility, as strong winds prevent the waters of a lake from stagnating.</P>
<P>I hope health and pleasure will attend you in your journey, and sometimes I hope you will call in my idea to amuse your silent hours when you ride alone through the lofty forest, or along the bank of some placid river, or over some flowery mead, whose glowing gems glitter beneath the crystal globules of morn∣ing; these objects inspire love and softness, and it is in such moments I would fain have you think of me.

<P>I can communicate nothing that may pro∣long this letter agreeably.

<P>YOU ask me whether I am sincere? To disguise my sentiments is an art I have yet to learn. I wish, my dear, I had some spice of the hypocrite; I should then possibly attain a better knowledge of this world, which de∣serves to be treated with less candour. I have studied it but superficially; and the more I consider it, the less I like it. You, my dear, have met with rough tempests in it; and I, who have encountered rougher, can now sin∣cerely sympathize with you.

<P>Mr. POPE observes, that resignation is the most melancholy of all the virtues; but we can combat Fate with no other weapon than Patience, and it is not so hard to effect as we are apt to imagine; the practice is easy and full of consolation.

<P>When will you come to us? we will shut out the world; we will shut out every thing but love and joy. My heart tells me we will soon meet, and that is happiness: Perhaps I may be deceived; but you never will, my dear, in believing me to be your assured and tender friend,</P>

<PB N="133" REF="025208_0142_0FCCA33E69AF3808"/>
was torn (perhaps for ever) from my arms: he was taken by tories in sight of his house. O! this cruel disaster has crushed me to the cen∣tre: I am sunk deeper than the grave. In the bitterness of my soul I forget to eat my bread, and mingle my drink with tears. Alas! the man I have lost was too good, too kind; his qualities were so gentle and amiable; he loved me with too great an excess of tender∣ness; with so much delicacy and softness, as becomes very painful for me to recollect: And his affection seemed to increase every day: he was always endeavouring to please me; always anxious about my happiness. If I looked but a little pensive, he was alarmed. It was but two nights ago that he waked me by putting his hand across my forehead, and finding me in a cold clammy sweat, he started up and got me a glass of wine. I was not sensible of any disorder, but was surprised to find myself cold as a corpse. I sat up, while he, kneeling by the bed side, grasped my hand in an agony of concern and tenderness.
<Q>Ah! my beloved, (said he) we must quit this place: you try to hide your distress from me, but I perceive your mind is filled with

occasion.—He was busied in the harvest, at a small distance from the house; but having been previously menaced bv our inveterate tories, and my heart presaging some heavy calamity, I pressed him to remain at home, but without effect. Towards evening, parting from his labourers, he was returning home with old MERKEE, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hite servant, and a load of wheat; when six men, starting from among the bushes, presented their fixed bayonets to his breast, bidding him to surrender or he was a dead man. "I yield myself, cried he in surprise,
<Q>pro∣vided you promise to use me as a gentle∣man.</Q>—"You shall be used," replied their leader, "as a prisoner of war commonly is." Upon this they were taken farther in the wood, where they pinioned my husband; a cut-throat looking Hessian leading him by the rope with one hand, while the other h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld a tomahawk, with which he swore to dispatch the prisoner if pursued. But his great anguish for me made him insensible of ferr; he begged, in the most pathetic terms▪ that the negro might return to let me know what was become of him, but all in vain. MERKEE wept bitterly—"O▪" said he,
<Q>I am an old negro—no matter for

me; but my good master is a young man, and my dear mistress will break her heart— she will die.</Q>
After a most fatiguing and rapid march, towards day they encamped in a deep swamp, where they produced General St. LEDGER's orders to take my husband and bring him to <HI>Canada,</HI> but to use him tenderly, take particular care of his health, and not to pillage his house. They had watched for him four days▪ on a small as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent which command∣ed a full view of whatever was transacted in our family▪ but growing impatient, they had determined to storm the house that very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight; and swore, had they met with resistance, they would have sacrified the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le family. The pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty consisted of three tories, one Hessian, and two British; they were afterwards joined by two more tories. The British were hu∣mane, and wept whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever my sad spouse de∣plored the mournful fate of his wife and child. After three nights march through horrid woods, (for they slept in the day) my hus∣band's intreaties prevailed on them to let the boy return with a letter for me. When he read it to them, most of them shed tears, and swore it was damned hard a gentleman should suffer so, but they must obey their orders.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="025208_0146_0FCCA344888AAD10"/>When the fourth evening arrived, despair∣ing of relief, (though he still looked up to God with a hopeless kind of dependence,) three Yankees appeared a little way off. One of whom, advancing, bade them surrender; but mistaking BLEECKER for the commander (not observing his ropes,) he presented his piece to shoot him through the head, when the tories, seeing a large party coming up, ground∣ed their arms. They all proceeded to <HI>Benning∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> where the party is laid in irons; while my spouse flew to my arms amid the shouts and congratulations of the whole city, which had seemed wonderfully anxious about his fate. As to my own wanderings, they were trifling. I fled instantly from a place where every object presented me with horror. S—, after weeping for several minutes on my neck, from a noble exertion of fortitude and friend∣ship, insisted on remaining there a while to have an eye to our effects. Our wailings filled the dismally echoing forest; even the tory women melted into tears and compassion, and several fainted in the hall. You may judge with what a broken heart I entered <HI>Albany</HI>; but blessed be the Saviour of sinners, I found it kind and sympathising beyond my merits.</P>

<Q>Heaven tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.</Q>
The hand of an Almighty Protector was so obvious in lead∣ing my husband through his imminent dan∣gers, and "hair breadth escapes," that on his return home (he told me) he almost fainted under his gratitude, and had so firm a trust and reliance on the goodness of God, that had he been surprised by a new party, he would have been assuredly confident of again escaping. My hour of darkness and astonishment was very great: I prayed with unknown fervency; but, O! I lifted my broken heart in despair▪ great God! I will no more distrust thy love; I will endeavour no more to offend thee. Ah! how insipid, how trifling appear the honours, and riches, and vanities of life, to being held in the shadow of his hand who is the living God; to having him on our side who is the Arbiter of all nature! Rejoice with us, my cousin.</P>

<HEAD>To Mrs. <HI>F.</HI> at Mount-Hope.</HEAD>
<P>I Sit down, dear BETSEY, to congratulate you on a new occasion of happiness to your family, by the birth of another daughter. This agreeble event I never was informed of until this morning, and though you may think my compliment of the latest, yet I would rather be thought impertinent than unfriend∣ly. I fancy you exclaim with LEAH, (in your exultation) "a troop cometh." Happy are you, my cousin, enjoying health, peace and every domestic blessing. Content hath limited your desires to your own mansion; and there every innocent pleasure waits to gratify them. All that remains is to wish you may insure those mercies by a grateful dis∣position to the giver of them.</P>
<P>Our situation is more precarious. To-day▪ happy in our Sylvan recess, surrounded by blooming gardens, orchards, and well culti∣vated fields; the whole valley echoing with the bleatings of sheep, &amp;c. and an air of tran∣quillity and plenty diffused around our cotta∣ges: to-morrow, even this very night, the de∣stroying savage may change this pleasing pros∣pect

Pardon this flight, my dear; but let me further insist, that as our education has given us a similarity of ideas, and an equal bias to friendship, such congenial minds ought not to lapse into a neglect of each other: permit me, therefore, my lovely Mrs. F. to renew our obsolete cor∣respondence,

<P>I Must decline your compliments (or rather oblique flatteries) my lovely cousin; my reason will not admit of them, whatever latitude my vanity might insist on.

who sacrificed every thing, even life, to their fame! Yet my resentment subsides into contempt, when I reflect what an abject, vile wretch General ARNOLD is become.

A traitor is a general object of scorn; and if his feelings are not quite lost in apathy, surely he may borrow CAIN's exclamation▪

<P>I AM wholly discouraged from writing any more to your quarter: our letters, I am sensi∣ble, are lost on the way, as I have not received a line from you or M— since early last fall. This interruption must certainly be the conse∣quence of an impertinent curiosity in some people, who break every seal they meet with, and then destroy the letters for fear of detection. If this should fall into such hands, I must ob∣serve to the gentlemen (few ladies being capa∣ble of such ungenerosity) that such a proceed∣ing betrays a want of common honesty and common humanity in them.

Will you not return be∣fore spring? Ah! SUSAN, if you do not I shall begin the labours of our flower beds with a heavy hearts, your favourite lillies will droop; nor shall I have courage to disengage your pinks from entangling weeds: endeavour, my dear, to come up; I am sure we shall be happy together.

Our small force there increases daily, and begins to brow-beat the enemy: in short, we are all anarchy and confusion: heaven only knows when it will end.</P>
<P>The most tragical affair has happened here that I ever remember to have heard of.

General ALLEN was barred up in gold-lace, and felt himself grand as the Great Mogul: they had an old spiked up field-piece, which, however, looked mar∣tial. I sat myself down among this formida∣ble set, and being cold, mildly desired one of their Captains to fetch a little dry wood. He obligingly complied, and we soon had a fine fire. I then began humbly to expostulate with these wise men of the east about the commence∣ment of this civil war; and at length demand∣ed how they could expect to support their ju∣risdiction, in the center of the states, who had not acceded to their claim? They replied,
<Q>The four eastern states were their own peo∣ple, and would certainly assist them.</Q>
I told them I could not see how they dared break through the confederacy while they were sensible all America's happiness depend∣ed upon the union. Captain R— inter∣rupted,

more are all fled with their families in a clan∣destine manner. This elopement of the tories gives us new apprehensions: we fear they will attempt in the spring a descent on this quarter; and though the sea-coast is well defended, our poor frontiers are commonly forgotten.</P>
<P>We have not seen the lads this winter. M— P— was here yesterday with A— L—; they have stolen a wedding. L— S— and the Major have likewise conclud∣ed their long courtship. J— H— is going to die, and old F— sends his respects to you.</P>
<P>Miss T— E—, you have all the news, but I must add one trifle more:—Your admirer R— is no warrior; not all the eloquence of our <HI>York</HI> party could induce him to face the enemy: but his situation admits of some apo∣logy: depressed with the loss of you, perhaps he is become indifferent about character, pro∣perty, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

I also insist, that you shortly make an excursion this way, and bring our fair cousins with you: the con∣trast between the gloom of a deep forest and the brilliancy of a lighted ball-room will make you return to the latter with a double relish. But the gloom of our forest has no ill influence on our conversation; we laugh, and sing, and chat in spite of winter and wars; nor does any thing prompt a momentary sigh, but the loss of our dear SUSAN.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SISTER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS day (the anniversary of an event sadly important to me) awakes me from a de∣ception I have admitted since our separation. I have been losing relations, friends, children and acquaintances many years: but with the last farewell salute you gave me, in the bitter∣ness of grief I reproached Providence it had not left me one friend: I retired hither, with my very little family, mourning, and could not help repeating the words of HEZEKIAH, "I shall go softly all my days."—Your letters, PEGGY's and MARIA's I have re∣ceived, often read, and wept over; but, con∣scious that my gloomy ideas would be unsea∣sonable
<PB N="160" REF="025208_0169_0FCCA3632B66A050"/>
in the circle of pleasure, I omitted answering as much as possible.</P>
<P>But this day tells me I have yet a kind com∣panion, who might now have lain fettered in a dungeon, had not Providence interposed. I have an endearing child, who might have now lain in the dark grave, if the same mercy had not restored her. And in spite of habit, gra∣titude shall make me this day cheerful.</P>
<P>Dear SUSAN, you must peruse the above <HI>alone:</HI> the genuine sentiments of a broken heart appear ridiculous to inexperienced levity: and though your fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> companions are sweetly sympathising, their very sensibility induces me to conceal from them the history of my feel∣ings.</P>
<P>The news of this place is, that Miss P— T— is married to Mr. J— P—; Mr. S— T— obliged to abscond for forgery; and Miss S— C— is like to take H— G— for better for worse. To descend a little— DIANA has lost SHOCK, and is on the verge of marrying with a certain CUFFE; FAN remains a widow, and MERKEE is the most constant lover I ever knew: but poor Mrs. F— was lately delivered of a child who is a

terror to every one that sees it. It seems she was struck with so much horror at the sight of JAMES YATES's murdered family, that it made too fatal an impression.</P>
<P>I had almost forgot to mention, that simple BETT HERMAN is married to a Hessian: Mr. B. officiated as priest, and I gave the happy couple a wedding-dinner, to which we invited our most civilized neighbours. E. and G. lodge here alternately, to guard Mr. B. and beg their regards may be presented you.</P>
<P>To return to myself—an unimportant and almost forgotten subject—I have been em∣ployed during the winter and spring in attend∣ing to my health, which has been considerably impaired and weather-beaten by the storms of affliction.
<Q><L>For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,</L>
<L>This pleasing, anxious being e'er resign'd;</L>
<L>Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,</L>
<L>Nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind?</L>
<BIBL>GRAY's ELEGY.</BIBL></Q>
Forgive my relapsing into melancholy: I will make one more exertion to be lively, and if I cannot succeed, will conclude my paper.</P>
<P>I have the finest garden in the country. In the center of four grass walks we have erected
<PB N="162" REF="025208_0171_0FCCA366587A6738"/>
a spacious arbour, closely shaded with annual vines, where we often drink tea, and enjoy the prospect of a lovely collection of flowers on one hand, and a cool shady orchard on the other; a luxuriant lot of herbage behind, and directly opposite a blushing vineyard in minia∣ture. Here, often, when perusing THEOCRI∣TUS, TASSO, and VIRGIL, I drop those pas∣toral enthusiasts, to reflect on the hours of friendship I have passed with my SUSAN: my cheek then glows with delight, pleasure deli∣cately touches my nerves, and all the springs of life mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e on cheerily. Ah, SUSAN! I love you more than you imagine. Wherefore are we separated? if for your advantage, I am more than resigned, I am contented.</P>
<P>Do you never hear of SAMMY? does he not write to you? Though I dwell in the depth of a vast forest, that need not limit his love: the still voice of affection cannot be lost in the thunder of war. What can be the reason he forgets me? I must either entertain a con∣tempt of my own demerits, or this—but love and partiality forbid a decision.</P>
<P>After all, my SUSAN, I will endeavour to circumscribe my happiness to the little lovely
<PB N="163" REF="025208_0172_0FCCA367A57C63C8"/>
spot I occupy, and try to forget the friends whose absence is so painful to me. O! could I think (like the inhabitants of <HI>Topinamboo</HI>) that the mountains which surround me were the limits of the earth, and that the individual spot I dwelt on was the whole world, I might then truly enjoy the pleasures it produced.</P>
<P>What ails the lads in your quarter? They must be very insensible, or you three fair nymphs very cruel, or Hymen surely would light his taper at <HI>R</HI>—. If this vein of celibacy continues, I would advise to erect a cloister, and then your nominal Lady Abbess would have something to do; the Miss W.'s would be large contributors, as they have taken the veil thirty years ago. But least the con∣finement of a number of beauties in a nunnery should cause an insurrection in the <HI>beau monde,</HI> we must also contrive to shut up all the gay, sighing, useless fops in a monastery; and to keep up forms and decencies, Mr. P— H—, a superannuated but constant adorer of the widow B. shall be appointed <HI>Monsieur L' Abbé.</HI></P>
<P>We have lived very quiet this summer. Once a party of five men, headed by ROGER
<PB N="164" REF="025208_0173_0FCCA369385E30E8"/>
STEVENS, lay concealed in the thicke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our orchard for three nights; but Mr. B. get∣ting intelligence of it, the neighbours collected and put them to slight, very indiscreetly, for they might easily have surprised and taken them. I went to see the place where they had stationed themselves; they had made a com∣modious bed of dry leaves, and had amused themselves with plaiting grass and making true lovers knots. Dear sister, farewell.</P>

<P>YOUR black eyes seem to have done some execution already; but you, more cruel than the Princess of the Steel Castle, who pitied the Knight of the Burning Pestle, have discarded your STREPHON without a sigh. But if you continue invincible to love fifty years hence, when your black eyes begin to twinkle through
<PB N="165" REF="025208_0174_0FCCA36AC26B2400"/>
"a pair of green spectacles, with silver rima and a shagreen case," you may possibly repent.</P>
<P>Dear SUSAN, you will easily distinguish this raillery from the undisguised sentiments of my heart: your letter made me feel that I am indeed your sister: I love you, my SUSAN; and since your departure there is a chasm in my family, at my table, at my fire-side, that is not filled to my liking by any other; but so far I am happy, that you are in a family where, with proper attention, you will gain every useful, every ornamental accomplish∣ment.</P>
<P>Now let me tell you the news of these parts. NANNY BOSTWICK died lately of a consump∣tion. I went to see the little beauty in her last moments; her piety, resignation and fortitude were very striking: she smiled disapprobation when, to console her, I hinted she might re∣cover. Mrs. P— too lays very ill. Papa, who was here yesterday, told me she could not recover to all human appearance: I shall visit her to-morrow, and if this paper is not sealed, will let you know her true situation.—I hear Doctor BROWN is dead in <HI>Virginia</HI>; that H— is very much reduced; and that W— has
<PB N="166" REF="025208_0175_0FCCA36C2911E698"/>
made a great fortune in <HI>New-England</HI> by pri∣vateering, and improved it by a wealthy mar∣riage. Undoubtedly he omits his usual ques∣tion, "What do the ladies say of me?"— Bless me, I could fill a volume. S— C— has accidentally blest <HI>Vermont</HI> with a fatherless son, and is gone to <HI>Canada.</HI> We are all well, except JOHNNY. Domine B. dresses like a very beau. JAMES H— and MAG S— traverse the bushes on horseback; and MER∣KEE thanks you kindly for recollecting him; but FAN resents your neglect, and begs me to let you know that she thinks you lose your manners. I suppose you know that MOLLY P— is married: yes, I recollect I formerly wrote it to you.</P>
<P>All this nonsense, my sweet SUSAN, will remind you of the many laughing, indolent hours we have passed, in the cool of summer evenings, on our green, where we chatted without reserve or impertinent caution, and as the full moon rose bright in a cloudless sky, when the simple lads and lasses were convened, we sported in the innocency of childish amuse∣ments, and pleased and fatigued with blind∣man's-buff,
<PB N="167" REF="025208_0176_0FCCA36DDFADAA38"/>
and hide-and-seek, and puss-in-the-corner, we went sweetly to rest.</P>
<P>SUSAN, all this little chat is for your own inspection. Were you to shew this letter to some belle or fop, you would be the less esteem∣ed for conversing with such a very rustic, such a stranger to the etiquette of a polite circle. The well-bred hate simplicity: there is a great gulph between the vulgar adepts of nature, and the artificial, mechanical sons of cere∣mony.</P>
<P>To-day is my birth-day: I have made it a day of thanksgiving to my God, who has often brought my soul out of trouble, and have made it sacred to the memory of my best loved friends, by writing them severally long letters. External rejoicing and festivity I care not for: the secret approbation of my conscience is all the praise I now seek after, and more, in my esteem, to be valued, than the acclamations of an empire.</P>
<P>How shall I conclude this incoherent epis∣tle? When I begin to talk to my SUE, (for, as Mr. POPE says, this is not writing) I know not how to be silent.</P>

<P>IT is three days since I wrote the above. That evening I was seized with a fever; I had a sleepless, melancholy night; and the next morning Doctor YOUNGLOVE bled me; but having a dull lancet, he made too large an ori∣fice, by which I lost too much blood: he could hardly stop it. I was so weakened that I have lain yesterday and to-day in the hysteries, and can just sit up to finish this for Major V— B—, who will take my letters with him to-morrow to <HI>Albany.</HI> However, I have spirits enough to laugh at my odd figure before com∣pany: I sit up in my short-gown, a cloak over my shoulders, no shoes, no roll on, with my night-cap. I want a deal of indulgence when I am sick; and blessed be Providence, your brother is the tenderest of nurses; so many nameless assiduities, such a winning softness and complacency in his manner, as palliate my distemper and prevent my complaints.

<P>I Have been a sad girl, my dear M—, to suspend writing to my fair one so long. They tell me you are the prettiest wit about <HI>R</HI>—, so that I ought to be cautious how I scribble; but I will go on in the innocency of my heart, and if you criticise, do it mercifully.</P>
<P>We have had an agreeable jaunt to <HI>New-England,</HI> but in passing the mountains of <HI>Tawkanok</HI> I think I never saw a more lovely scene: we had ascended the last declivity; the vallies below us, interspersed with farms, and plains, and villages, seemed to be at an in∣credible depth; when we entered on a level, overshaded with evergreens, laurel, and hem∣lock,
<PB N="170" REF="025208_0179_0FCC8EB36375C628"/>
pine and spruce, intermixed with red, blue and yellow berries—imitating the softest bowers of summer. These greens naturally struck out into long vistas, through which we saw the gildings of the setting sun long after the mortals below us were sunk in darkness.</P>
<P>We found the people hospitable and social; were invited cheerfully into almost every genteel house we chanced to pass; and return∣ed home, like JACOB's sons from <HI>Egypt,</HI> with our money, if not in our sack's mouth, at least in our pockets: but tell SUSAN we left little BENJAMIN behind, who is preceeding to the <HI>Nine-Partners.</HI></P>
<P>I begin to find the winter tedious; my circle of friends here is too small; that of my rustic acquaintance too large: when the heart is not interested, the mind has little satisfaction in company: your own feelings will confirm my observation. Dear cuz, can't you contrive to visit us? In vain would the winds beat, and the hail rattle; deep snows might confine us, and arctic blasts condense the atmosphere; still our fires should sparkle, pleasure and joy and plenty attend us—and friendship should triumph. Pardon, M—, the trans∣ports
<PB N="171" REF="025208_0180_0FCCA373A70C5E50"/>
of a soul whose feelings are too acute: the distant idea of an interview with those whom I love elevates me beyond reason, and ten times a day I anticipate our happy meet∣ing.</P>
<P>I received yesterday a long letter from Mr. A—: he tells me our KITTY is <HI>increasing:</HI> possibly I may inclose a letter for him: I wish she would write; she can (if she will) chat very agreeably. One of these days I intend to tire cousin B. with an epistle as long and prolix as an homily: we used to be corres∣pondents, but I am afraid she grows too proud to recollect her country friends. A certain Colonel told me last week that Mrs. F— used to be a charming and instructive compa∣nion, but that now she was grown too fine a lady for conversation. I told him I never would believe that the tinsel of fortune could rob my B— of the ornaments of humanity: so please to inform her of the Colonel's malignity.</P>

<P>Could not read sister's letter, because I must dress, Major ARROGANCE, Colonel BOM∣BAST, and TOM FUSTIAN being to dine with us; could not suit my colours—fretted—got the vapours: DINE, handing me the salts, let the vial fall and broke it; it was diamond cut crystal, a present from Mr. S.

<P>I Congratulate you, my dear brother, on the peace; in consequence of which I sincerely hope you may see many happy years: as for me, my bright prospects lie beyond the grave; I have little to promise myself on this side of eternity. Affliction has broken my spirit and constitution; I grow daily weaker and more emaciated, and depressed with the reflection of leaving my husband and child—alas! the only treasures I have now on earth.</P>
<P>Let me talk freely to you for the last time, my brother:—You know your poor BETSEY was born a solitary orphan: though enjoying a genteel fortune, yet friendless, and a wan∣derer,
<PB N="178" REF="025208_0187_0FCCA37E2CC65378"/>
at length I found peace in the company of a tender husband. Ah, how soon interrupt∣ed! my lovely babes died away like summer blossoms before the frost: still I had a kind mother to complain to; we wept together: but soon the enemy rushing upon us like a hurri∣cane, we were scattered like a flock of frighted birds: our dear mother fled to <HI>Red-Hook</HI> with SUSAN; I staid awhile at the farm; but a sud∣den incursion of some savages hastened my re∣treat; I took my beautiful ABELLA on my arm, and PEGGY by the hand, and wandered solitary through the dark woods, expecting every moment to meet the bloody ally of <HI>Bri∣tain:</HI> however, we arrived safe at <HI>Arabia,</HI> where I met my husband, who had been to <HI>Albany</HI>; he procured a chaise, and took us to the city; the alarm increasing, we got a passage in a sloop with sister SWITS and family; twelve miles below <HI>Albany</HI> my ABELLA died of a dysentery; we went ashore, had one of my mahogany dining-tables cut up to make her coffin, and buried the little angel on the bank. I was seized with the distemper; and when we came to <HI>Red-Hook,</HI> found my dear mamma wasted to a shadow: she mourned over the ruins of her

family, and carried me to uncle H—'s, who received us very reluctantly. Soon after my dear mother died, and I returned to <HI>Albany,</HI> where, in a few days, I saw poor sister CATY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. SWITS.</NOTE> expire. We retired again to <HI>Tomhanick,</HI> where we lived sometime blest in domestic tranquilli∣ty, though under perpetual alarms from the savages: at length, one afternoon, a small party from <HI>Canada,</HI> who had unperceivedly pene∣trated the country, carried off Mr. BLEECKER with his two servants. This shock I could not support. My little PEGGY and I went to <HI>Albany,</HI> where we wept incessantly for five days, when God was pleased to restore him to our arms. Soon after I fell into premature labour, and was delivered of a dead child. Since that I have been declining; and though we often fled from the enemy since, been cruelly plundered, and often suffered for very necessaries, yet your silence, my brother, hurts me more than these.</P>
<P>Mr. BLEECKER talks of taking me to <HI>New-York</HI> this spring, but I believe I shall never reach it; my health is so precarious that I dare not, even here, venture an afternoon's visit. I

could wish to see you before I died; but I am used to disappointments. I have given you my little history that you may see I die of a broken heart. Farewell, my only brother; may God preserve your family, and continue all your blessings. When you see my poor little PEGGY, and my poor little HANNAH SWITS, think of your friends who have perished before you, and love and pity them for their sakes. Give my kindest love to BETSEY, and accept of your brother's. I am, dear SAMMY, your very af∣fectionate sister,</P>

<P>INDISPOSITION has of late so dispirited me that I ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mitted to write to any of my friends; but within <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese few days I am sen∣sibly better, and feel this even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in a chatty humour. Let me first of all give you the news—LYDIA S— is married to Mr.

JOHN B—▪ and Miss POLLY S— to Lieutenant G— (son of ENNIS G— the taylor;) moreover, NATJE L— (your old enemy) is likewise become somebody's es∣poused wife. Lord STERLING died last night, and (I am quite a gazette) beau T— is gone to <HI>Canada.</HI> The lads lodge with us, and we have endeavoured to pass the winter as gleefully as plenty and simplicity can make us—E— kisses your hands▪ JAMES is a profess'd slave to PEGGY S—; and POLLY will join us to∣morrow, when Mr. B. and his spouse intend to leave the merry circle at <HI>Tomhanick,</HI> and take a ramble to <HI>New-England.</HI> I have been informed that Mrs. A— has blest the Doctor with a son and daughter; if so, I give you joy. Did you ever see so incoherent an epistle▪ however, you must confess, did I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>educe so much news to order, and tell every thing elegantly, it would swell my paper be∣yond the common limit; besides, I do not mean to set up for "the complete letter-wri∣ter." My PEG is quite disappointed at your silence, and regrets that she ever sent her scrawl to <HI>R</HI>—: and indeed, SUSAN, (now I think on it) you have corresponded with me

rather like a formal acquaintance than a warm friend; with every post you might have sent me some scribble▪ sometimes a half a quire, sometimes a half a line; the dawnings of friendship, emotions of humanity, sentiments of piety, or impressions of love, ought to have been candidly confided in the bosom of your own ELIZA: they would have brightened my moments of solitude, and have made me for∣get my oblivious situation. SAMMY too has helped to embitter my cup of life; he has con∣tracted his affection within the orb of his lit∣tle family, and cannot shoot out a ray of love at this distance, to enlighten and bless a for∣lorn sister▪ I love him sincerely; may he and his be forever happy. My sister, I shall grow too dull if I proceed; I had better conclude; but I am fond of talking to you. Let me drop into news again—POLLY P— (Mrs. L.) has a fine son; and I had like to have for∣got to mention that <HI>Vermont</HI> intends again to renew the east and western claims. Upon a late resolve of Congress, (handed particularly to them) they have assumed an insulting arro∣gance of behaviour, threaten Congress, and

imprecate <HI>New-York.</HI> In short. I fancy we shall have all our persecutions to go over again.</P>
<P>But what have your black eyes been doing all this while? have you captured no heart worth retaining? I am afraid the gentlemen are so severely attracted by the charms of three fair ones, that (like Mahomet's shrine) they cannot attach themselves to either. Pray be seen separate.</P>
<P>We have here a rustic beauty come into our forest, that would be much admired (I mean for person, not manners) by all the beaus of <HI>R—:</HI> the symmetry of her form, glitter of her eyes, and lessening shades of vermi∣lion on her cheek, which lose themselves im∣perceptibly in a complexion of the most deli∣cate whiteness; these, when improved in the <HI>beau monde</HI> by artificial graces, would make her an irresistible toast; she has the romantic name of MELANESSA; but being of a tender constitution, not able to work, has no declar∣ed admirer.</P>
<Q><L>Full many a gem of purest ray serene,</L>
<L>The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear;</L>
<L>Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,</L>
<L>And waste its sweetness on the desert air.</L>

<L>'And shall we fall as suppliants on the knee?</L>

<L>There, while the kids and lambs crop off the flow'rs,</L>
<L>In close converse they pass th' eloping hours:</L>
<L>Beneath a cedar's boughs, whose awful shade</L>
<L>Extended o'er the plain, was <HI>Levi</HI> laid:</L>

<L><HI>Issacher</HI> ask'd; and <HI>Levi</HI> thus replies:</L>

<L>'Have we not toil'd beneath the burning ray</L>

<L>'And from the rav'ning wolves protect the sheep?</L>
<L>'Is this the kind return for all our care?—</L>

<L>Rush to the guilty heart and refuge seek.</L>
<L>Now vice prepares the formidable blow,</L>
<L>Yet shrinks, encountering a defenceless foe:</L>

<L>The cavern'd echos doubly loud rebound:</L>
<L>A placid stream meanders on the steep,</L>
<L>'Till tumbling from the cliff, divides the frown∣ing deep.</L>
<L>Oh tempt not Fate on those stupendous rocks,</L>
<L>Where never shepherd led his timid flocks;</L>
<L>But shagged bears in those wild deserts stray,</L>
<L>And wolves, who howl against the lunar ray:</L>
<L>There builds the rav'nous hawk her lofty nest,</L>
<L>And there the soaring eagle takes her rest;</L>
<L>The solitary deer recoils to hear</L>
<L>The torrent thundering in the mid-way air.</L>
<L>Ah! let me intercede—Ah! spare her breath,</L>

<HEAD>BENEFITS OF SCOLDING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>1790.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE often wondered that amongst the numbers who write for the edification of the public, no one has ever thought fit to expatiate upon the <HI>Benefits of Scolding</HI>; nor can I con∣ceive why an art, whose origin we may trace in years before the flood, and which is so much in use among the moderns▪ should be disre∣garded by writers.</P>
<P>It is an ancient art, and I am persuaded a very beneficial one, not only to individuals, such as husbands, wives, children, and ser∣vants, but to the community at large. Schools, in particular, are much indebted to it; and though they may not acknowledge it, nor think it merits an eulogy from their pens, yet the flourishing state of many of our seminaries speaks loudly in its favour. People in general would rather suffer corporeal punishment than
<PB N="266" REF="025208_0274_0FCCA3F57621C9C0"/>
be lectured upon their faults; and I have known many who did not mind the rod to be deterred from a continuance of their follies, merely by the lashes of the tongue.</P>
<P>A scolding officer has often made his subal∣terns as angry as hornets in an engagement; and a coward, when enraged, will fight most courageously. Perhaps he might have called them cowards in his ill-humour, and they, out of spite, have exerted themselves and per∣formed wonders, which, had their leader been a tame, peaceable creature, they would have looked upon as impracticable: and we know an able politician, when a motion was made in the house of which he was a member, preju∣dicial to the state which he lived in, who not only scolded the house out of countenance, but out of the motion too, and made them lay it by for years.</P>
<P>The spouse of SOCRATES was of a turbu∣lent temper, which made his friends pity him much; but SOCRATES was a wise man, and well knowing the utility of scolding, told them, that she taught him patiently to put up with the humours of other men.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="025208_0275_0FCCA3F6F440E078"/>Scolding is not only good for the mind but the body too. It makes respiration more free, and cures colds; and by promoting perspiration, has been known to remove complaints of long standing. Let the following account speak for it:—</P>
<P>A lady of my acquaintance was in a very ill state of health some time ago, as every body thought in a consumption; but one day (as the Doctors were sitting by her) luckily something went wrong, and the poor invalid forgetting her reduced situation, gave vent to her feelings, and scolded most eloquently, and displayed her talents in such a manner as rectified the mistake, brought on a profuse perspiration, and greatly relieved her. The benefits arising from such proceedings were more than she could have expected; she, however, repeated it with the same success, and is now a hearty woman.</P>
<P>But some may be apt to inquire, "If this is true, might not people live for ever were they to keep on scolding?" No one, I believe, has ever yet made the experiment, nor should I dare wish to propagate such an opinion; but this I know, that almost all scolds live to be
<PB N="268" REF="025208_0276_0FCCA3F8961244C0" MS="y"/>
pretty old, nor do I remember ever to have heard of a person who died scolding.</P>
<P>My scolding abilities are at present very slender, but there is room for improvement; and it is probable, if I should make any con∣siderable proficiency in that science, I may favour the public with a specimen.</P>

<HEAD>FINE FEELINGS Exemplified in the Conduct of a Negro Slave.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>1791.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING what the learned Mr. JEFFERSON has said respecting the want of finer feelings in the blacks, I cannot help thinking that their sensations, mental and ex∣ternal, are as acute as those of the people whose skin may be of a different colour; such an as∣sertion may seem bold, but facts are stubborn things, and had I not <HI>them</HI> to support me, it is probable I should not attempt to oppose the opinions of such an eminent reasoner.</P>
<P>In the interior parts of this state lived (a few years ago) a man of property, who owned a number of blacks; but formed in Nature's
<PB N="269" REF="025208_0277_0FCCA3F9F817C978" MS="y"/>
most savage mould, his chief employment was inventing punishments for his unfortunate de∣pendants, and his principal delight in practis∣ing the tortures he had invented. Among the number of his slaves was an old Negro, who, in his younger days, had been a faithful ser∣vant; but captivity and sorrow had at length broken his spir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and destroyed that ambition which actuates the free, and gives energy and life to all they perform. This was a proper subject for the cruelty of Mr. A— to act upon. Upon the commission of the smallest fault, on the most trifling neglect, he would himself tie MINGO, (as butchers do sheep in∣tended for slaughter) and after having beaten him till the blood followed every stroke of the whip, he would retire, leaving the wretch weltering in his gore, exposed to the burning rays of summer or the gelid gales of winter. When rested he would return, and after a re∣petition of his amusement, would release the sufferer, lest a few more minutes of such ex∣treme agonies should shorten the period of MINGO's woes, and his master's felicity. However, this mode of punishment becoming a little troublesome to Mr. A—, he thought
<PB N="270" REF="025208_0278_0FCCA3FC2F8E29F0"/>
of another which he believed would answer nearly as well: he caused a large ox-chain to be made, and putting it about MINGO's waist, he brought it round his neck, and there fastened it again, leaving an end of about four yards, to which he nailed a piece of wood weighing upwards of forty weight. With this clog the slave was obliged to work—and this at night was placed in the master's chamber, (the chain passing through a hole in the door) while MINGO slept on the ground out side of the house, from which uncomfortable couch no∣thing but the most bitter cold excused him.</P>
<P>Seven long years did the miserable being groan under this load, when the captain of a vessel, hearing of his hard fate, out of pity bought him.</P>
<P>After having paid the money he went home, and sending for MINGO, told him he was free:—"You are your own master," said the humane sailor;
<Q>but you are old, and help∣less—I will take care of you.</Q>—Over∣powered with joy, the old man clasped the captain's knees; he wept aloud—he raised his swimming eyes to heaven—he would have spoken his thanks;—but his frame was too feeble for the mighty conflict of his soul—he expired at his benefactor's feet!</P>

<LG>
<L>WHEN drowsy Sleep had clos'd my weary eyes</L>
<L><HI>Fancy</HI> convey'd me to a sandy shore,</L>
<L>Where the steep cliffs, wet with the midnight dews,</L>
<L>Re-echo'd to the surge's hollow roar;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Night</HI> had methought put on her soberest charms,</L>
<L>The silvery stars a feeble glimmer gave,</L>
<L>The winds rung mournful through the elm's green arms,</L>
<L>And the wan moon-beams trembled on the wave;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When from among the rocks the voice of Grief</L>
<L>I heard, it sadly warbled in the air;</L>
<L>Wond'ring, I turn'd to view from whence it came,</L>
<L>And lo! a <HI>form</HI> appear'd divinely fair:</L>

<PB N="276" REF="025208_0284_0FCCA40532727590"/>
<L>Her auburn hair hung creless round her neck,</L>
<L>Sorrow sat weeping in her beauteous eye;</L>
<L>The rose had faded in her downy cheek,</L>
<L>And from her beating bosom fled a sigh:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Grief</HI> from her frame the bloom of health had chas'd,</L>
<L>The flood she approach'd with tott'ring pace and slow;</L>
<L>To the blue vault of heav'n her eyes she rais'd,</L>
<L>And, sighing, thus began a tale of woe:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Still as the eve returns, my pensive soul</L>
<L>'O'er the <HI>Atlantic</HI> casts a mournful glance,</L>
<L>'And o'er the swelling surges, as they roll,</L>
<L>'Pursues my BELMONT to the shores of <HI>France.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'When he departed tears refus'd to flow,</L>
<L>'Seal'd were the fountains of my aching eyes,</L>
<L>'And my big heart swell'd with oppressive woe,</L>
<L>'Just breath'd a wish to yonder beaming skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>

<L>ALEON is dead!—The sullen trump of fame</L>
<L>Blew the sad tidings to the western shore:</L>
<L>The scythe of Time, the wasting hand of Pain</L>
<L>Hath lodg'd him with the myriads gone be∣fore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How late he wept his brother-warriors dead!</L>
<L>Cut off untimely in Life's early day:</L>
<L>Alas! the kindred spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it too is fled;</L>
<L>We now to him the same sad tribute pay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He, like themselves, 'the creature of a day,'</L>
<L>Beneath the frigid arm of Death hath bow'd:</L>
<L>Yes, <HI>Aleon</HI> lies—the valiant and the gay,</L>
<L>Deep in the bosom of the stormy flood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus courage, beauty, sentiment, and wit</L>
<L>Bloom in an hour, and bloom but to decay:</L>
<L>Life quits its suppliants, as the airy sprite</L>
<L>Before the morning gale fleets fast away.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="289" REF="025208_0297_0FCCA4196D9DB430"/>
<L>Yet to his mem'ry shall a pile be rear'd,</L>
<L>And each past service meet a kind return;</L>
<L>Still shall his name by freemen be rever'd,</L>
<L>And laurels spring and blossom round his urn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'But pensive poetess,' some one may say,</L>
<L>'When these memorials of the <HI>good</HI> shall fade,</L>
<L>'Will not his worth to time become a prey,</L>
<L>'And sink into Oblivion's darkest shade?'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! surely no—the triumph ends not here,</L>
<L>Beyond the tomb his brightest prospects rise;</L>
<L>Sublime he soars above this <HI>vale of tears</HI>—</L>
<L>He gains a life eternal when he dies.</L>
