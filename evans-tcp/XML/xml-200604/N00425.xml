<P>HISTORY tells us that the Antient <HI>cedoemonians</HI> in their Publick and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Festivals, did use to have Three made among them; the first, of <HI>Old Men,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made a Song to the Spectators, of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>

<P>It were a <HI>Spectacle</HI> very much more Desirable and Considerable, if Christians of all <HI>Ages</HI> might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his Day stand forth among us; and in the Capa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> not only of <HI>Men,</HI> but also of <HI>Saints,</HI> give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a good account of themselves.

<P><PB N="3" REF="000534_0007_0FA6B418ACF9F638"/>
We have before us, an Inspired Epistle, which not only as <HI>Austin</HI> observes, has been <HI>Unquestiona∣bly</HI> and <HI>Universally</HI> received as <HI>Canonical;</HI> but also <HI>Jerom</HI> testifies, has as <HI>Unquestionably</HI> and <HI>Uni∣versally</HI> been ascribed unto the Holy Apostle <HI>John.</HI> There is indeed running thro' the whole Epistle, the plain <HI>Character</HI> of the Spirit breathing in that Apostle, of whom one of the Antients does report, That when thro' extream Age, he was unable to <HI>Walk</HI> or <HI>Speak</HI> to the Church, he would be carried by the Disciples thither, and with his Aged, Fee∣ble, Broken Voice, only say unto them, <HI>My Dear Children, Love one another.</HI></P>
<P>Our Apostle in our Context, is pressing the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣neral</HI> Duty of <HI>Conformity</HI> to the Lord Jesus Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and under that Head, the <HI>particular</HI> Duty of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣rity</HI> towards all our Brethren; and hereupon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> addresses all Christians of <HI>several Ages,</HI> there∣withal very pertinently and elegantly declaring to them the Reasons of his thus Addressing them.</P>
<P>All Christians are first addressed under the name of <HI>New-born Babes;</HI> for indeed we all should be like <HI>Babes</HI> for our Humility, for our Innocency, for our Placability; or else, our Lord has told us, <HI>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> shall not enter in o the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> But these <HI>Babes</HI> are then ranked under three Denomi∣nations, <HI>Fathers, Young Men, Little Children;</HI> to each of these does the Apostle say, <HI>I write unto you;</HI> For truly, our God hath His <HI>Children</HI> in all <HI>Ages,</HI> and all <HI>Ages</HI> ought very much to be con∣versant with the <HI>written</HI> Word of God.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="000534_0008_0FA6B41D313179B0"/>
Let us begin at the first, and of them: note,</P>
<P>First, The <HI>Persons</HI> apply d unto. <HI>Fathers.</HI> By these are meant, not meerly <HI>Fathers in Grace,</HI> but likewise, <HI>Fathers in Age;</HI> the Expression intimates <HI>Old Men,</HI> that are in the School of the Lord Je∣sus Christ, And mark, the old Apostle calls them, <HI>Fathers;</HI> which was not from any <HI>Relation</HI> of theirs to him, but from his <HI>Reverence</HI> to them. 'Tis to teach us. That, <HI>Old Men</HI> should have much <HI>Respect</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> from us; we ought still to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them as our <HI>Fathers,</HI> &amp; use no Terms unto them, which discover not our sense of something <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erable in them, but remember that Charge of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, in Lev. 22. 19. <HI>Thou shalt Honour the Face <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>he Old Man, and Fear thy God;</HI> there is no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the <HI>Great God</HI> where the <HI>Face</HI> of an <HI>Old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> is not beheld with Regards of Honour.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The <HI>Character</HI> and <HI>Priviledge</HI> of these persons. 'Tis, <HI>Ye have known Him that is from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Beginning.</HI> By that is meant, our Lord Jesus Christ; of whom this very Apostle elsewhere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aks, in <HI>John</HI> 1. 1, 2. <HI>In the Beginning was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> which Name <HI>he</HI> (and none but <HI>he</HI>) in e∣very one of his Books, put upon the Lord Jesus Christ; and he adds, <HI>The same was in the Begin∣ning with God.</HI> But if you ask, why the Lord Je∣sus Christ, is here called, <HI>He that is from the Beginning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> I answer,</P>
<P>'Tis first, to assert the <HI>Divinity</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ; against those <HI>Carpocratians,</HI> are <HI>Ce∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>fans</HI> and <HI>Ebionites,</HI> who were the <HI>Antichrists,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="5" REF="000534_0009_0FA6B4204D58A810"/>
appearing in the Days of <HI>John.</HI> Those Heretic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> affirmed our Blessed Lord Jesus to be a <HI>Meer man</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but in opposition to them, 'tis here said, <HI>That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lord had a Being</HI> from, <HI>and</HI> at, <HI>and Indeed influite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> before <HI>the beginning of the World.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis also to commend the Lord Jesus Christ upon the score of His <HI>Antiquity; old men</HI> love to pretend unto the Knowledge of <HI>old Things;</HI> and it is here intimated, That as they knew <HI>Him,</HI> so there was nothing <HI>older</HI> than He for them to be conversant withal.</P>
<P>Let this then be the Doctrine which our Thoughts may at this Time a little dwell upon.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine and exegesis">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>That a peculiar Acquaintance with the Lord Jesus Christ, who is God as well as Man, is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Attainment of</HI> old men <HI>walking in the Ways of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>We have three Propositions here to be regarded.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>Proposition I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>All men,</HI> and particularly <HI>Old Men</HI> should study <HI>a peculiar Acquaintance with the Lord Jesus Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> All men</HI> should be of the same Resolve with <HI>That Man</HI> in a Cor. 2. 2. <HI>I determined not to know any thing, but Jesus Christ, and Him Crucify'd.</HI> This
<PB N="6" REF="000534_0010_0FA6B42225CD98D8"/>
was the <HI>Determination</HI> of one whom the Antients do nor unfi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly call, <HI>An uns<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>table Admirer of the Lord Jesus Christ!</HI> and there was no Occasion for that Famous and Learned Philosopher among the Antient Heathens to <HI>pity</HI> the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> upon this account, that such <HI>Rare Parts</HI> as <HI>Pauls</HI> were, should be thrown away upon the <HI>Knowledge of Je∣sus Christ.</HI> A Needless, Bootless pity! For <HI>No <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> can any where find a fitter Subject for his Acquaintance, than the Lord Jesus is; not have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay of those <HI>Doctors</HI> who have worn the pompous Titles of <HI>subtil,</HI> and <HI>profound,</HI> and <HI>Angelical,</HI> bin worthy of the Titles, unless this Acquaintance have made them so.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Si Christum discis nihil est si coetera nescis.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Si Christum</HI> nescis <HI>nihil est si coetera</HI> discis.</L>
</LG>
<P>But <HI>Old Men</HI> should have a very particular Dis∣position hereunto. For having try'd an Acquain∣tance with all other Things, they can upon a long Experience, resent the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty</HI> and <HI>Vexation</HI> that is in them all, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out, <HI>I have seen an end of all persection in the world.</HI> It is therefore time for <HI>them</HI> to Resolve, <HI>I have determined to know nothing but Him that is from the Beginning!</HI></P>
<P>If you Enquire, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> is a <HI>peculiar Acquain∣tance</HI> with the Lord Jesus Christ?</P>
<P>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> imports, First, <HI>A Speculative</HI> or <HI>Notional</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Christian Religion, and especi∣ally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>That Great M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tery of Godliness, God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in the flesh. Old Men</HI> should become well
<PB N="7" REF="000534_0011_0FA6B422C0046118"/>
informed about the <HI>Natures</HI> of Him, who is <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man</HI> in One Person; about the <HI>Offices</HI> of Him, who is the <HI>Prophet,</HI> the <HI>Priest,</HI> and the <HI>King</HI> of our Souls; about the <HI>Endowments</HI> of Him, who is both <HI>Able</HI> and <HI>Willing</HI> to <HI>save us unto the uttermost;</HI> a∣bout the <HI>Benefits</HI> of Him, who bestows upon us <HI>Justification,</HI> and <HI>Sanctification</HI> and <HI>Redemption,</HI> and all the Inheritance of <HI>Adoption;</HI> in fine, about the <HI>Conditions</HI> of Him, <HI>who Humbled himself, and be∣came obedient unto Death, Wherefore God hath highly Exalted Him.</HI> These are the points of our <HI>Cate∣chism,</HI> and the first <HI>Principles of the Doctrine of Christ;</HI> it is a shame for <HI>any,</HI> but above all, for <HI>Old Men,</HI> to be Ignorant of these principles.</P>
<P>But here is not all; a <HI>Devil</HI> once could say to our Lord Jesus, as in Lue. 4. 34. <HI>I know thee, who thou art.</HI> Wherefore it imports, Also, a <HI>Fiducial</HI> and an <HI>Experimental</HI> Knowledge of the Lord Je∣sus Christ. <HI>Knowledge</HI> is put for <HI>Faith,</HI> in Isa. 53. 11. <HI>By his Knowledge, my righteous Servant, shall justifie many.</HI> We ought so to <HI>know</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ, as to prize Him, and Love Him, and Apply our selves unto Him, and appropiate Him unto our selves, and say unto Him, like the Disci∣ple, <HI>My Lord and my God;</HI> or with the Believer, <HI>My Beloved is mine, and I am His!</HI> And <HI>Knowledge</HI> must be with <HI>Tast,</HI> as in I Pet. 2. 3. <HI>Ye have tasted that the Lord is Gracious.</HI> We ought so to <HI>know</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ, as to he very Really sensi∣ble of the Beauty and Sweetness that is in Him, &amp; like that woman once, we should <HI>feel Vertue going
<PB N="8" REF="000534_0012_0FA6B42381F0A0B8"/>
forth from Him</HI> unto our Souls; or like <HI>Paul,</HI> find upon our selves the <HI>power</HI> of what is in our Lord. <HI>Old Men</HI> are miserable Non-proficients, if they do not arrive to <HI>such</HI> a knowledge of our Lord Redeemer. In a word, <HI>All men,</HI> and especially <HI>Old Men</HI> should so know the Lord Jesus, as to lead a life of Communion with Him.</P>
<P>But if you Enquire, WHY we should be studi∣ous of such an <HI>Acquaintance</HI> with the Lord Jesus Christ? Briefly,</P>

Secondly, We have nothing so <HI>Useful</HI> to be ac∣quainted withal, as the Lord Jesus Christ. For,</P>
<P>The <HI>Knowledge</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ will fill us with a blessed variety of other <HI>Knowledge.</HI> As now, Would we know <HI>God?</HI> we are told in 2 Cor. 4. 6. T<HI>he glory of God is to be seen in the Face of Jesus Christ.</HI> Right Notions about the <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> and <HI>Justice,</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, are shaped in our Minds, by the Knowledge of our Lord Jesus; when we know Him, we are like <HI>Moses,</HI> put into the Clefts of a <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k,</HI> where the <HI>glory of the great God</HI> now passes before us. Or, would we know <HI>our selves?</HI> The Knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, will help us to know what our <HI>sins</HI> are. Well sings the Christian Poet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Who would know</HI> Sin, <HI>Let him repair</HI></P>
<P><HI>Unto</HI> M<HI>ount</HI> Olivet.</P>
<P>The Knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ will help us to know what our <HI>plagues</HI> are. We may pass a judgment upon our own <HI>Wounds</HI> by the <HI>pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sler</HI> in Him provided for us; and by what was Exacted from our S<HI>urety,</HI> we may guess what our own <HI>Debts</HI> have been. And we may come likewise to know our <HI>Duties,</HI> by the Knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. He has been a com∣pleat <HI>Copy</HI> and a perfect <HI>Pattern</HI> for us; and His Call unto us is, <HI>Lock on me and do likewise.</HI> In short, Jesus Christ is the <HI>Key</HI> that unlocks all the <HI>Scriptures.</HI> We have <HI>scarcht</HI> the Scriptures, and <HI>known</HI> them to good purpose, when we have Dug so far into them, as to find them all <HI>testifying</HI> of
<PB N="10" REF="000534_0014_0FA6B4251BFDDCF0"/>
the Lord Jesus Christ. The Knowledge of Him exposes to us the <HI>Pearl of great Price</HI> in that Sa∣cred <HI>Field. All men</HI> should know these things, but for <HI>old</HI> men to be un-instructed in them, is re∣markably disgraceful and pernicious.</P>
<P>Again, The <HI>Knowledge</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, will afford an unspeakable <HI>satisfaction</HI> to our Souls. An Artist, that has met with some <HI>New,</HI> tho' but <HI>small,</HI> Discovery, with a strange <HI>Satisfaction</HI> crys out, <HI>I have found, I have found!</HI> But above all, the Knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, is a <HI>River</HI> of <HI>honey</HI> to them that are made partakers of it; hence could the Psalmist say, in Psal. 17. 5. <HI>I will behold thy Face, I shall be satisfied.</HI> This <HI>Manna</HI> will fully answer the vast craving raging Appetites of an Immortal Soul; whatever fiery <HI>thirst</HI> was once in such a Soul, yet now, <HI>It shall never thirst.</HI> We read in Phil. 2. 1. about, <HI>Consolation in Christ;</HI> the Knowledge of Christ places us amidst the Springs and Veins of an interminable <HI>consolation. All</HI> men should seek for such a <HI>Satisfaction;</HI> but it is particularly incumbent upon <HI>old</HI> men, who may complain with <HI>Bartillai,</HI> that they are past the relish of those <HI>worldly</HI> pleasures in which others <HI>labour</HI> to <HI>delight</HI> themselves. Once more,</P>
<P>The <HI>Knowledge</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, will convey an Eternal <HI>Salvation</HI> to our Souls. A man may go to Hell, with all other <HI>Sciences</HI> about him; and sink into that horrible devouring Pit, with such a shriek as that, <HI>Qualis Artifex pereo! Be∣hold an Artist, going to be Damned!</HI> The Floor,
<PB N="11" REF="000534_0015_0FA6B429D86898A0"/>
the hideous Floor of Hell, is paved with the skulls of admirable <HI>Scholars.</HI> You know who said, <HI>No's cum nostr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Doctrinis mergimur in Infernum.</HI> Who better <HI>Scholars</HI> than the <HI>Devils</HI> themselves? All the Learning that many have, serves only as a bag of <HI>Gold</HI> about a Drowning Man; it sinks them the deeper into the scalding Floods of the Lake that burns with fiery Brimstone: But the Know∣ledge of the Lord Jesus Christ is a <HI>saving</HI> thing. He that calls in Isa, 45. 22. <HI>Look unto me, and be saved,</HI> also says, <HI>O</HI> know <HI>me, and you shall be saved.</HI> A Look to Him, will bring an Healing to our Dy∣ing Souls; as a Look to the <HI>Coper Serpent,</HI> once did unto the <HI>Israelites.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Knowledge</HI> will cause us to <HI>escape the pollu∣tions of the World;</HI> this <HI>Knowledge</HI> will cause us to <HI>grow in Grace;</HI> and in fine, this <HI>Knowledge</HI> has no less a thing spoken of it, than that in Joh. 17. 3. <HI>It is Life Eternal.</HI> The fame that makes it thus Necessary for <HI>All men,</HI> makes it for <HI>Old men</HI> more eminently so. <HI>Old men</HI> have a <HI>Night</HI> coming up∣on them; and they above all, had need get their <HI>Lamps</HI> lighted with such a Knowledge, as may light them into the Chambers of Everlasting Glo∣ry.</P>

First, The <HI>Knowledge</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ is a <HI>special Attainment</HI> in whomsoever 'tis. It can't be said of all people. <HI>They have known him that is from the Beginning.</HI> 'Tis the distinguishing favour of God, that has made <HI>some</HI> Acquainted with the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ; and hence 'twas the Rapturous Doxology of our Lord, in Mat. 11. 25. <HI>I thank thee, O Father, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and Revealed them unto Babes.</HI> Those few, that have the true Knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, are those to whom, the most high God may say, <HI>You only have I known, among all the Families of the Earth.</HI> And as there is a singular <HI>Difference</HI> or <HI>Dignity</HI> in this <HI>Attainment,</HI> which renders them that have it, the <HI>happy Servants</HI> that may see the Glory and hear the Wisdom of Him that is, <HI>A Greater than Solomon;</HI> so there is a singular <HI>Excellency</HI> in it, upon this Account; that it finds a singular <HI>Acceptance</HI> with God; we are told in <HI>Joh.</HI> 6. 29. <HI>This is THE work of God, that ye believe on Him, whom He hath sent;</HI> God is pleased with no <HI>work</HI> that we can do, so much as this, <HI>that we so know his Son, as to put our trust in Him;</HI> and it brings a singular. <HI>Advan∣tage</HI> to men; 'tis wished in 2 Pet 1. 2. <HI>Grace and Peace be multiplied unto you, thro' the Knowledge of Jesus our Lord;</HI> may we but well <HI>Know</HI> our Lord Jesus, that's the way fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> manner of <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> to be <HI>multiply'd unto us.</HI></P>

The God of Heaven does gradually give unto Christians, a more large and clear insight into the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> and so they have a <HI>growing Ac∣quaintance</HI> with the Lord Jesus Christ, the <HI>Media∣tor</HI> of that Covenant. At our first Conversion we have indeed so much <HI>knowledge</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, as <HI>Draws us to Run after Him;</HI> but we find that <HI>Knowledge</HI> increasing as long as we live.

We do not know <HI>Him that is from the Beginning;</HI> unless we own that He is <HI>without all Beginning,</HI> unless we think him to be as the Philosopher expressed it, [<HI>Presbytato<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oon Ontoon</HI>] <HI>The most Ancient of all Beings;</HI> and unless we are sensible of the Challenge made by <HI>Wisdom</HI> for Him, in Prov. 8. 23. <HI>I have been declared Prin∣cess, from the Beginning.</HI> No <HI>Arian,</HI> or <HI>Socinian</HI> has a Knowledge of our blessed Jesus, enough to Entitle him to the Denomination of a <HI>Christian</HI> in the Churches of God. Our Lord is indeed a real and a proper <HI>man;</HI> but it is the Marble Rock up∣on which our whole Christianity is founded, that He is more than so; for 'tis his Title, in Rom 9. 5. <HI>God over all blessed for ever.</HI> Thus the Name of <HI>the most High,</HI> (or <HI>Gneljon,</HI> which the Poet means I suppose by <HI>Anchialus</HI>) the peculiar Name of God among his ancient people, is given to our Lord Jesus. Let it be observed, first, That the <HI>Names</HI> of <HI>GOD</HI> are put upon our Lord. The Lord Je∣sus Christ is the Redeemer, of whom <HI>Job</HI> says, <HI>In my Flesh I shall see God.</HI> The Lord Jesus Christ is the <HI>Angel,</HI> of whom <HI>Jacob</HI> says, <HI>He is the God that Redeemed me from all Adversity.</HI> 'Tis the Lord Je∣sus Christ, whom <HI>John,</HI> in 1. Joh. 5. 20. calls, <HI>The</HI> True <HI>God,</HI> whom <HI>Paul</HI> calls, in Tit. 2. 13. <HI>the Great God;</HI> &amp; whom <HI>Isaiah</HI> in Cap 9. 6. calls, <HI>the Mighty God.</HI> What tho' He once were <HI>smitten</HI> with many Sorrows in an evil world? still in his deepest Obscurity, He was, as we may read that
<PB N="15" REF="000534_0019_0FA6B4302C1D1358"/>
clause in Isa. 53. 4. <HI>A smitten God.</HI> Yea, 'tis <HI>Je∣hovah,</HI> who says in Zech. 12. 10. <HI>They have pierced me;</HI> Behold, the Incommunicable Name of <HI>Jeho∣vah</HI> given to a crucify'd Jesus; unto which Name answers that in the New Testament, <HI>the Lord which is, and which was, and is to come.</HI> Hence al∣so our Lord exhibits Himself by that Name, in Joh. 8. 58. <HI>I AM.</HI> And elsewhere He is called, <HI>the Lord of Glory;</HI> that is, the most gracious Lord.</P>
<P>And as the <HI>Incommunicable Names,</HI> thus also the <HI>Incommunicable Attributes</HI> of the Almighty God, belong to our Blessed Saviour. Shall we speak of <HI>Eternity?</HI> Says our Lord in Joh. 17 5. <HI>I had glo∣ry before the world was.</HI> Shall we speak of <HI>Omnipo∣tance?</HI> 'Twas said by our Lord, in Mat. 18. 20. <HI>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midst of them;</HI> or shall we speak of <HI>Omniscience?</HI> 'Twas said by our Lord, in Rev. 2. 23. <HI>I am He that searches the Hearts and Reins.</HI> None but a <HI>God may</HI> speak at such a rate as this!</P>
<P>What shall I say more? let it be observed,</P>
<P>Secondly, That the <HI>Works</HI> of God are perform∣ed by our Lord Jesus Christ. The <HI>Creation</HI> of the World, is the Work of God; but of our Lord Jesus Christ, is it said, in Joh. 1. 3. <HI>All things were made by Him.</HI> The <HI>Government</HI> of the World, is the work of God; but of our Lord Jesus Christ, is it again said, in Heb 1. 3. <HI>He upholds all things by the word of his power.</HI> 'Tis undoubted, <HI>That none can forgive sins but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> nevertheless 'tis said in Mat. 9. 6. <HI>The Son of Man has power to forgive

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Who but God can <HI>send</HI> the <HI>Holy Spirit?</HI> yet said our Lord Jesus in Joh. 16. 7. <HI>I will send the Comforter.</HI></P>
<P>In a word how many <HI>Miracles</HI> has our Lord Jesus wrought, &amp; this in his <HI>own Name</HI> How often were the <HI>Sick</HI> Healed, the <HI>Dead</HI> raised, the <HI> Possessed </HI> Res∣ened, by the Hand of this, Blessed Redeemer, co∣ming in his <HI>own Name</HI> unto us! And hence also, let it be observed, Thirdly, That the <HI>Rights</HI> of God are pertaining to our Lord Jesus Christ. None but <HI>God</HI> may be the Object of our <HI>Worship.</HI> Yet we are commanded in Joh. 5. 23. <HI>To honour the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, its we honour the Father.</HI> And <HI>Joshua</HI> adored <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Captain to the Hosts of the Lord.</HI> Our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should be to none but God; yet the Dying <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>phen,</HI> in Act. 7. 59. <HI>They stoned</HI> Stephen <HI>calling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> God, <HI>and saying, Lord Jesus.</HI> Our <HI>Faith</HI> should be in none but God; yet we read in Rom. 15. 12. <HI>There shall be a Root of Jesse, in Him shall the</HI> Gentiles <HI>trust.</HI> We may <HI>Swear</HI> by none but God; yet the Apostolical Oath ran in such Terms at those in Rom. 9. 1. <HI>I say the truth in Christ.</HI> Hence also, 'tis into the name of <HI>Christ,</HI> that we are <HI>Baptised,</HI> when we receive the first of our Sa∣craments; which implies his being a <HI>God</HI> unto us.</P>
<P>The Lord Jesus Christ is no less than <HI>God;</HI> and oh how much is our <HI>Love</HI> to Him obliged, our <HI>Hope</HI> in him strengthened by that Consideration!</P>

<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT I.</HEAD>
<P>We may Infer from hence, as we go along, <HI>how foolish, how absurd, how wicked are the</HI> Defpisers <HI>of the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> If the Lord Jesus be <HI>God</HI> as well as <HI>Man,</HI> and if an <HI>Acquaintance</HI> with Him be an <HI>Attainment</HI> in us, then 'twere very reasona∣ble to Admire Him, Adore Him, and Magnifie Him for ever; to <HI>Despise</HI> him, is of all Follies the most abominable.</P>
<P>But are any so <HI>absurd</HI> and <HI>wicked?</HI> I would to God, there were <HI>None.</HI> But I am to tell you, All that <HI>Neglect</HI> a Christ, so far <HI>Despise</HI> a Christ. Say sincerely, Have you made sure of a <HI>Christ</HI> or no? Have you Accepted him, Embraced him, tho∣roughly <HI>Closed</HI> with him? Can you certainly and joyfully say, <HI>Christ is mine?</HI> It is to be doubted, that many must confess this thing to have been left undone all this while. But what is the rea∣son of this horrible Neglect? Why, men are so taken up with <HI>secular</HI> and <HI>sensual</HI> matters, that they have no leisure to acquaint themselves with a precious Jesus? A filthy <HI>Lust,</HI> and a wretched <HI>World,</HI> are the things for the sake of which, a Matchless <HI>Christ</HI> is Neglected by Impenitnent Un∣believers; it may be said of them, as in Mat. 22. 5. <HI>they made light of him, and went their ways; One to his Farm, another to his Merchandise.</HI> Did not the Jews <HI>Despise</HI> a Jesus, when they preferred a <HI>Barabbas</HI> before Him? every Unbeliever does
<PB N="18" REF="000534_0022_0FA6B431C99CFBB8"/>
as had as this comes unto; and there are two ter∣rible considerations to be therefore laid before all such woful Creatures.</P>
<P>Consider first, The time will come when there shall <HI>None</HI> of you all <HI>Despise</HI> an Inestimable Jesus. As 'twas said in Isa. 13. 12. <HI>I will make a man more precious than fine gold, even a man than the gol∣den wedge of</HI> Ophir: So there will a time come, when whole <HI>Wedges,</HI> yea, and whole <HI>Mountains</HI> of the finest <HI>gold,</HI> will not be so <HI>precious</HI> to your poor Souls, as that <HI>man</HI> who is <HI>from the Beginning.</HI> When you shortly see a <HI>God</HI> angry, with you, a Soul going from you, and an <HI>Hell</HI> gaping for you, how much do you think, a <HI>Christ</HI> will then be worth? The Day is at the door, when the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>inate Sinner among us all, will pierce the very Heavens, with such a lamentable cry as that, <HI>O for a Christ, a Christ! a thousand worlds for a saving Acquaintance with Him!</HI></P>
<P>Consider Secondly, The holy Jesus will then despise, all such as have not seasonably Repented their slighting of him. It is said in Psal. 73. 20. <HI>O Lord thou shalt despise their Image.</HI> Thus, the <HI>Sha∣dow,</HI> (the <HI>ghost</HI>) of such a sinner, appearing before Christ, the Judge of departed Spirits, with im∣portunate Petitions for pity, and pardon, and mercy, will be answered with nothing but an infi∣nite Contempt. The Lord Jesus will then con∣temn the <HI>Souls</HI> of such miscreants, and when they shriek, <HI>what will become of me?</HI> He will say, <HI>Let the Devils take them, if they will, I will make no
<PB N="19" REF="000534_0023_0FA6B432867A3400"/>
provision for them.</HI> He will then also contemn their <HI>prayers,</HI> and when they Supplicate unto him with never such raging Ardors, <HI>Lord, Lord, open to us!</HI> He will only Reply, <HI>I know you not.</HI> Where∣fore, <HI>Hear, ye Despisers, and wonder, that ye may not perish.</HI></P>
<P>But of these things, there must be a further Improvement made.</P>

<P>It remains, that <HI>Old men</HI> be now called up∣on, to do several <HI>good things which the Lord then God requireth of them.</HI> As the Prophet <HI>Joel,</HI> chap. 1. 2. began a Sermon so; <HI>Hear this ye old men;</HI> this is the preface that I am to give unto the rest of my Discourse, <HI>Hear, this ye old men; O hear</HI> that your <HI>Souls</HI> may live.

but an <HI>old man</HI> once under the inspirations of the Almighty, gave that advice to <HI>Solomon,</HI> in Prov. 4. 7. <HI>Wisdom is the principal thing, therefore get Wisdom.</HI> And surely, an <HI>old man</HI> himself is not unconcerned in that Advice! A <HI>common knowledge</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, indeed is not enough to make you happy; but I am sure, the want of <HI>such</HI> knowledge will render you both <HI>wretched</HI> here and <HI>undone</HI> for ever. He was a wise man that said, in Prov. 19. 2. <HI>That the Soul be without knowledge, it is not good;</HI> but it is not so <HI>bad</HI> being without a∣ny <HI>Knowledge,</HI> as being without the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. This <HI>ignorance</HI> will prove the woful <HI>mother</HI> of two things. It will render your <HI>Unbelief</HI> incurable. As it was said, in I Cor. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 8. <HI>Had they known, they would not have Crucify'd the Lord of glory;</HI> so may it be said, those that re∣main in their Distance from the Lord Jesus Christ <HI>They refuse the Lord of glory, because they have not the</HI> Knowledge of <HI>Him.</HI> And it will also render your <HI>Destruction</HI> unavoidable. It was of old com∣plained, in Hos, 4.6. <HI>my people are destroy'd for the lack of knowledge;</HI> but the Knowledge of our Lord Jesus is that, the <HI>lack</HI> whereof is most of all destructive; the world will one day with hot Thunderbolts be set on a light <HI>Fire</HI> for it. Well then, look to it, <HI>Fathers,</HI> that you been't unac∣quainted with the <HI>Great Mystery of Godliness.</HI> If you have never yet studied that <HI>Mystery,</HI> I pray begin, and count not your selves <HI>too old to learn;</HI> that man is <HI>too old to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> that is <HI>too old to learn.</HI>

The Ancient Heathen had an higher opinion than so, of their meaner Learning. <HI>Socratos</HI> would go to School when an <HI>old man,</HI> pleading that it was better to be <HI>Opsimathes</HI> than <HI>Amathes,</HI> better to be <HI>Late-learned,</HI> than to be <HI>Unlearned.</HI> How much ought <HI>old men,</HI> to think thus of that <HI>Learning</HI> with∣out which <HI>All men</HI> must find, <HI>That He that made them, will not have mercy on them, and He that for∣med them will shew them no Favour?</HI> 'Tis to be fea∣red, that there is a lamentable ignorance about the Lord Jesus Christ, in many that have lived unto old Age under the Gospel of that blessed Lord. A famous Divine tells us, of an <HI>old man,</HI> who had enjoyed the constant Preaching of the Word, and yet when he lay on his Death-bed, he still thought, <HI>Jesus Christ was an amiable Youth,</HI> and other things too ridiculous to be recited. And he has been a scandal to me to see, how little many <HI>old men</HI> among our selves do understand about <HI>The Covenant of Redemption,</HI> and some other i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣portant Articles. But, O get a little more know∣ledge of Jesus Christ, before you go; lest that most forlorn and fearful case be yours, in Job <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 12. <HI>They shall dy without Knowledge.</HI> To be <HI>corporal∣ly blind</HI> with Age, is not unusual; But for men to be Spiritually <HI>blind</HI> in Age is very dreadful. The <HI>Gray Hairs</HI> on the outside of your Heads, are not more Honourable, than the <HI>wrong Thoughts</HI> in the inside of them are pernicious, while you have not a good knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, Old <HI>Luther</HI> did not reckon it a shame to profess

himself, <HI>Discip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>um Catechism<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> one that still was every day learning his <HI>Catechism.</HI> Whether it be a <HI>shame</HI> or no, for you that are <HI>old</HI> men, to be students in your <HI>Catchisms,</HI> I am certain, 'tis a more burning shame for you to be ignorant of the points which your <HI>Catechisms</HI> are to teach you. You have not so much as the <HI>beginning</HI> of true knowledge, till you know Him <HI>that is from the Be∣ginning.</HI> The Apostle rebuked it, as a <HI>shameful</HI> Deficiency in those, Heb. 5. 12. <HI>For the time, ye ought to be Teachers, yet ye need that one Teach you, which be the first principles of the Oracles of God.</HI> They say, <HI>old men</HI> are <HI>twice Children;</HI> but O for shame, do not want the instruction which when you were <HI>first Children,</HI> you ought to have had a∣bout the Lord Jesus Christ. Nay, albert, you knew never so much about the Lord Jesus Christ, yet there is a vast deal more behind still to learn. <HI>Old men,</HI> study a blessed Jesus, till you fathom yet more of his matchless Excellencies! If one of the Roman Emperours, had such a value for know∣ledge, as in his <HI>old Age</HI> to be a sort of pupil still, and say, <HI>'Tis good for</HI> old men <HI>to be</HI> learning <HI>still;</HI> surely, it becomes <HI>you</HI> to have as much value for the peerless knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>In a word, since you are so near to your Eternal <HI>Sabbath,</HI> you should gather a double portion of this <HI>Manna</HI> for your Souls; and follow these Di∣rections in it.</P>
<P>First, <HI>Pray</HI> much for the knowledge of the
<PB N="23" REF="000534_0027_0FA6B43AE1591048"/>
Lord Jesus Christ. Would we have this <HI>Know∣ledge?</HI> we are counselled in Prov. 2. 5. <HI>cry after it;</HI> he that writ that Counsel did himself obtain <HI>knowledge</HI> by <HI>asking</HI> for it. It is said, in Jam. 1. 5. <HI>If any man lack wisdom, let him ask it.</HI> A sincere <HI>Prayer</HI> will do more, towards the <HI>Unveiling</HI> of Christs FACE, and the <HI>Unsealing</HI> our EYe, than the <HI>prayeriess Enquiries</HI> of many years. Now that the <HI>Eyes</HI> of your <HI>Bodies</HI> are almost out, O follow the Lord Jesus with such a cry for your <HI>Souls,</HI> as once that poor <HI>Son of sorrow</HI> made, <HI>Lord, that we may receive our sight!</HI> Those Mini∣sters that study much on their <HI>Knees,</HI> will <HI>Preach best,</HI> and those <HI>Christians</HI> that wrestle much on their <HI>Knees,</HI> will <HI>know most,</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ. Be continually praying like <HI>Moses, Lord, I beseech thee, shew we thy glory;</HI> and let not your Declining <HI>Sun</HI> set with you, till by ardent prayer, you have got the <HI>Day-star to arise in your Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Think</HI> much for the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. The <HI>custome</HI> of <HI>Isaac</HI> will very much befriend the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of Jesus; that <HI>young man</HI> has left a pattern for <HI>old man</HI> to follow. <HI>Old men,</HI> you have now time to <HI>think;</HI> O spend as much as you can of that little time in <HI>Meditations</HI> upon the Lord Jesus Christ. 'Tis said of <HI>Moses</HI> in Exod. 19. 3. That he <HI>went up to God,</HI> and then the Lord called unto him, <HI>come up?</HI> The <HI>Jewish</HI> Expositors have this gloss upon it; That <HI>Moses</HI> first made a <HI>spiritual Ascent</HI> by <HI>Meditation,</HI> &amp; then he was favoured with a <HI>bodily Ascent</HI> unto very
<PB N="24" REF="000534_0028_0FA6B43CBB8D0E60"/>
heavenly Communions. <HI>Meditation,</HI> 'twill carry you up into the Mount of God, when you are so <HI>old,</HI> that you cannot <HI>Ascend</HI> a Chamber in your Houses without help or pain; yea, twill carry you within the <HI>Vail</HI> of God, and bring you to the view of, <HI>Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant.</HI> Every day then discourse unto your selves on some Divine Subject, until you feel some lively Impres∣sion of it, on your Souls; and have special Eye to the Lord Jesus Christ in your Assiduous <HI>Medi∣tations:</HI> said the Psalmist, Psal 119. 100. <HI>I have more understanding than all my Teachers, for thy Te∣stimonies are my meditation; I understand more than the Ancients.</HI> Behold the way, for you that are <HI>Ancients,</HI> to get much <HI>Understanding</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ; let your daily <HI>meditation</HI> be on those Oracles of God, whereof he says, <HI>They testifie of me.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly and lastly, Frequent the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the knowledge of him; these are the <HI>glasses,</HI> of which we are told, 2 Cor. 3. 18. Therein <HI>we behold the glory of the Lord;</HI> and so, <HI>we attain the knowledge of the Lord. Old men,</HI> as long as ever your legs can carry you, O be getting into those <HI>Galleries</HI> where you may find the Lord Jesus Christ. Yea, attend upon His Worship, tho you do it as good old <HI>Jacob, learning on the top of a staff.</HI> Be glad of every <HI>App oint∣ment,</HI> wherein you have that Invitation, <HI>behold, the Lamb of God;</HI> be glad of every <HI>Opportunity</HI> where∣in you may have that priviledge, <HI>to see the goings of the great King in the Sanctuary.</HI> Repair to all the
<PB N="25" REF="000534_0029_0FA6B43D04226D08"/>
Ordinances, of the Lord, saying like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Greeks of old, <HI>we would see Jesus! we would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jesus!</HI> But for this end, especially repair to the <HI>Supper</HI> of the Lord. It is an horrible thing to see an <HI>old man</HI> turn his back on the Holy Table, and it is a <HI>sorrowful</HI> thing for such an one to dy ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Church-fellowship. The psalmist could say, in psal. 92. 13, 14. <HI>they that are planted in they House of the Lord, shall bring forth fruit in old Age<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 'tis a barren <HI>old man</HI> that is not found in <HI>the house of the Lord.</HI> I beseech you, that before you go out of the world, you get into the <HI>Church</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when you are at the Sacrament in the <HI>Temple,</HI> you may like old <HI>Simeon,</HI> take up the Lord Jesus in your Arms, and sing, <HI>Lord, now lettest thou thy Ser∣vant depart in peace; for mine Eyes have seen thy Jesus here.</HI></P>
<P>I remember an Apparition of our Blessed Lord Jesus Christ, wherein he seems to have something of an <HI>old man</HI> upon him; 'tis said in Rev. 1. 1. <HI>His Head and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>irs were white like Wool, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> white as the Snow.</HI> O that <HI>old men,</HI> that all of you, whose <HI>heads</HI> are <HI>white</HI> with Age, would he restless till you have a sight of Him.</P>

<P><PB N="26" REF="000534_0030_0FA6B43DDA4C0670"/>
Consider, first, You cannot be far from the <HI>end of your days</HI> in this evil world. You may sadly look backward on the few days that have already <HI>passed,</HI> and as it were, <HI>stolen,</HI> from you; and you may then look forward, assuring of your selves, <HI>I have not near so many years to Live, as those that have already gone from me like a tale that is told; it was but yesterday that I came</HI> into <HI>the world, and now before to morrow, I shall be gone</HI> out <HI>again.</HI> It was the Emphatical Expession of the Apostle, in I Cor. 7. 29. <HI>this I say, Brethren, the time is short,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Greek word carries it, <HI>the time is Fur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. d. you are like Mariners, just ready to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shore. Even so, <HI>this I say, Futhers, the Sail of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is just furling with you; you are just putting into the harbour, where you shall step a shore on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a long Eternity.</HI> An old Grecian walking once very <HI>slowly,</HI> said unto a Stander by, <HI>After this fashion I am stepping into the Grave;</HI> and another old Grecian that felt his Ancles failing him, com∣plain'd, <HI>that death had bitten him by the Legs.</HI> You cannot stir many steps, without many such admo∣nitions of the Mortality, which you are near un∣to. It can't be long, before you pass into your Eternal State; the <HI>vital Ty</HI> between your Spirits and your Bodies, will not much longer hold toge∣ther; there are but a few Sands now left in the bottom of your <HI>Glass,</HI> and your <HI>Light</HI> is within one Inch of going out. You may say like Father <HI>Isaac,</HI> in Gen. 27. 1. <HI>Behold, now I am old, and I know not the day of my death;</HI> but you may also
<PB N="27" REF="000534_0031_0FA6B43E897956B8"/>
say, <HI>since I am old, I do know that my Death cannot be many days off.</HI> It was the Speech of as good an <HI>old man,</HI> as ever lived, in Josh. 23 2, 4. <HI>I am old and stricken in Age; behold this day I am going the way of all the Earth.</HI> If you are <HI>old,</HI> I am sure you are <HI>going.

<P>Consider Secondly, The <HI>End</HI> of your Days, will be but the <HI>beginning</HI> of your never-ending Miseries, if you dy without a saving Interest in <HI>Him that is from the Beginning.</HI> 'Tis none o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he <HI>that</HI> is <HI>from the Beginning,</HI> who can deliver you from the woes and plagues that will never have an end. We are told in I Thes. 1. 10. It is Jesus <HI>who delivers from the wrath to come;</HI> without an <HI>U∣nion</HI> to Him, that <HI>wrath</HI> will <HI>come</HI> upon you, and after it is already <HI>come,</HI> it will be still <HI>to come,</HI> there will be more of it still <HI>to come</HI> throughout, Eternal Ages. You that are near to your <HI>Death,</HI> are as near unto the <HI>Worm that never dyes,</HI> and unto the <HI>Fire that never shall be quenched,</HI> if a speedy Con∣version prevent it not. It is a dreadful word in Joh. 8. 24. <HI>Ye shall dy in your sins.</HI> Be not so thick of Hearing in this your old Age, as to be deaf unto this Warning of God; If you do not quickly <HI>get</HI> out of your <HI>sins</HI> by a closure with the Lord Jesus Christ, you I <HI>dy in them;</HI> but so to <HI>Dy</HI> is to dy under the formidable Curse of the Om∣nipotent

God, and it is to Dy exposed unto the Vengeance of Eternal Fire. Poor <HI>old man,</HI> Thou hast already seed many bitter dismal doleful days, and had thy Heart often broken with those <HI>Evil Days;</HI> but be assured, all the past black Hours of thy life are but the <HI>beginning of sorrows;</HI> if thou dost not immediately get an Interest in <HI>Him that is from the Beginning.</HI> If an <HI>old man</HI> don't get out of <HI>old Adam</HI> before he die, he will find an <HI>old Hell</HI> prepared for him; and this also circumstanced with very dreadful Aggravations. How many <HI>sins</HI> does a man commit in one Fifty or Threescore Years! But <HI>old men,</HI> if you are still out of Christ, the God of Heaven remembers all your <HI>old sins,</HI> as fresh as if they had been done but this very morning. Our Lord said of some that were Dead and Damn'd many years before, in Joh. 10. 8. <HI>They ARE Theives.</HI> Even so, the <HI>old man</HI> out of Christ <HI>IS</HI> in the account of God, the same sinner that once he <HI>was;</HI> it may be said of him, as once it was of some, <HI>He is not purged from his old sins.</HI> But what a prodigious load of sins then lies upon such an <HI>old man,</HI> to sink him into the Sulphureous Abyss of Hell! Hence 'twas said in Isa. 65. 20. <HI>the Sinner an hundred years old, shall be Accursed.</HI> It is promised as a great blessing, to live near an <HI>hundred years;</HI> but if a man be a <HI>Sinner</HI> at that Age, his <HI>Age</HI> will be but a <HI>Curse</HI> unto him, he shall have cause to wish that he had never seen such an <HI>Age</HI> as that. Such a wretched <HI>old man</HI> must not only perish, but also go down to the Pit with
<PB N="29" REF="000534_0033_0FA6B44433387CE0"/>
heavier Loads of Confusion and Vexation than those that had not lived so long; that as 'twas said of one, <HI>It had been good for that man, he had never been born;</HI> so it may be said of this man, <HI>It had been good for him, he had never lived half so ma∣ny years in the world.</HI> When he is Roaring in the Fiery Vaults below, <HI>I am tormented in this Flame!</HI> he will add this Lamentation &amp; Execration there∣unto, <HI>Why dyed I not from the Womb? why did I not give up the Ghost when I came out of the Besly?</HI> It was of old given, as a Resolve to the problem, <HI>Quis miserrimus Senex egenus.</HI> What is the <HI>most miserable sight in the world?</HI> Answer, <HI>an old man in want;</HI> an old man without <HI>bread.</HI> But I'le tell you a far more miserable sight; and that is, <HI>An Old man in sin;</HI> an Old man without <HI>Christ,</HI> an Old man without <HI>Grace;</HI> an Old man tumbling down into the pits of Eternal Desolation.</P>
<P>Consider, Thirdly; It is not as yet altogether too late for you to <HI>Begin</HI> the work of getting a saving Interest in <HI>Him that is from the Beginning.</HI> 'Tis indeed a thousand pitties that you have thus long delay'd this work; which is, <HI>the One thing Need∣ful.</HI> If you should now be brought home unto Lord Jesus Christ, you must bewayl your selves, like <HI>Paul,</HI> in I Cor. 15. 8.

The blessed Lord Jesus Christ is this Day making an Offer of <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Strength</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> unto us all, and the <HI>old men</HI> a∣mong us, as well as the rest are concerned in it.

the Earth, as it has been there,</HI> and <HI>your Spirit shall Return unto God that gave it.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Believe that <HI>till</HI> your Change comes, you shall be sufficiently provided for, by <HI>Him that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s from the Beginning.</HI> 'Tis a meer paradox of <HI>O∣riginal Sin,</HI> 'tis a <HI>Mystery of Iniquity,</HI> that the <HI>Ol∣der</HI> men grow, they often grow the more <HI>Earthly,</HI> &amp; the more <HI>careful.</HI> As 'tis hard to say whether the Greek Name for an old man, intimates one <HI>Looking</HI> to, or one <HI>Loving</HI> of the <HI>Earth;</HI> So, Old Men too much lay their <HI>Hearts</HI> where their <HI>Heads</HI> are going to be laid; <HI>Solum unum hoc vitium adfert senect us homini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us: Attentiores sumus ad rem omnes, quam sat est;</HI> the fear of want comes upon them; and they are then most anxious about living in the world, when they are just going out of the world. Hence they become infinitely <HI>sparing</HI> and <HI>sor did,</HI> and they scrape to lay up, without any Bounds. It is needless to bring <HI>Augustin</HI> for a Voucher, That <HI>cum cuncta vitia in sene senescat sola Avaritia Juvenescit.</HI> But, <HI>Fathers,</HI> your dishonour your selves. You are at this pains to hoard u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Legacies and Portions, for those that perhaps wil not thank you for them; and you fearfully dis∣oblige the kind Providence of the Lord Jesus Christ. Said the Psalmist in Psal. 71. 17, 18. <HI>O God, thou hast taught me from my youth; now also, when I am Old and Gray-headed,</HI> O God <HI>forsake me not.</HI> Why, good Sir, you need not fear it. Who is it that has <HI>fed</HI> you from your Youth? &amp; <HI>cloath'd</HI> you, from your Youth? and <HI>kept</HI> you, from your
<PB N="43" REF="000534_0047_0FA6B684371CDF18"/>
Youth? Why, the fame Lord will still provide for you. <HI>He that is from the Beginning,</HI> has look't after you hitherto <HI>from the Beginning;</HI> and will he leave you now! No, <HI>He hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.</HI> The Philosopher said, Before <HI>Old Age, my care was to live well; but now</HI> under <HI>Old Age, all my care is to Dy well.</HI> And in∣deed you have nothing else to take any <HI>care</HI> a∣bout; let the promise encourage you to confine your Cares unto <HI>Dying in the Lord.</HI> 'Tis hor∣rible to see with what a possession the Devil holds the Soul of many a poor <HI>Old</HI> man, when he has made them lay aside their dependance upon that unfailing promise of God. The very design of the Apostle in our Context here, is to correct the sin of <HI>worldiness,</HI> particularly in Aged Men. Let them that may have done with <HI>Hopes,</HI> have also done with <HI>Cares</HI> about the world.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Rejoice that <HI>when</HI> your Change comes, you shall go to the Enjoyments and Embraces of <HI>Him that is from the Beginning.</HI> Say with Aged <HI>Paul,</HI> in Phil. 1. 23. <HI>I desire to Dislodge, and be with Christ, which is by far the best of all.</HI> Death is a fort of a <HI>Cloud</HI> now before your Eyes; but there is a <HI>Bright</HI> as well as a <HI>Dark</HI> side of that Cloud. Look on it, not as a <HI>Destroyer</HI> of your <HI>life,</HI> but as a <HI>Messenger</HI> of your Lord; it is but a Waggon that our <HI>Joseph,</HI> our <HI>Jesus,</HI> will shortly send for you, to fetch you thither, where you shall <HI>behold his Glo∣ry:</HI> O be Ravished at the Thought of this, and <HI>Rejoice in the Hope of the glory of God.</HI> If it in a∣ny

measure afflict you to think, what you are go∣ing <HI>from:</HI> then think joyfully, what you are go∣ing <HI>to.</HI> Think, that you are going <HI>from</HI> a World wherein your <HI>Dayes</HI> have been <HI>few</HI> and <HI>ill,</HI> and wherein you never can expect them to be other∣wise a but think that you are going <HI>to</HI> a world of undisturbed Happiness, where there is <HI>Fulness of joy in the presence of your Lord, and there are Plea∣sures at his Right-hand for evermore.</HI> Methinks <HI>life</HI> should become a matter of <HI>patience,</HI> while <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath</HI> should be rather a matter of <HI>Desire</HI> with you, un∣der the apprehension of the <HI>Joy</HI> that you are now To near unto. Methinks the Terrors of <HI>Death</HI> should be no more to you than they were to old Mr. <HI>Dod,</HI> who under a threatning Sickness being told, there was hope of his <HI>Life,</HI> reply'd, <HI>A∣lass, this is just as if a weather-beaten Marriner ar∣riv'd unto his Haven, should be told he must put out to Sea again.</HI> My Fathers, how can you forbear lon∣ging to be in the Fruition of Him that has <HI>loved you, and washed you from your Sins, in his own Blood!</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, Let all the little spot of time between this and your Change, be wholly spent in a <HI>Com∣munion</HI> with <HI>Him that is from the Beginning.</HI> An Impartial <HI>Reflection</HI> will give you to see that you have lost a world of <HI>time,</HI> since you first came in∣to the world; and how much ought this to fill you with an unalterable Resolution that you will well Husband the little inch of <HI>time</HI> which yet re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ains.

You should now more than ever engage in such a <HI>walk,</HI> as you may expect like <HI>Elias</HI> to be snatched up into eternal Glory from Let not a <HI>day</HI> now pass you without many salleys of your Souls towards a sublime Acting of many <HI>Graces</HI> in it; and let not a <HI>night</HI> come upon you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> without renewing your <HI>peace</HI> with God, and your <HI>close</HI> with Christ.

<P>IT was an Observation long since made by a Re∣nowned Ancient, <HI>That</HI> our Lord Jesus Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave the most sensible and pathetick manifestati∣ons of his <HI>Love</HI> to the <HI>Youngest</HI> of his Disciples; and it is a common temper in the Owner of eve∣ry Orchard, more particularly to take notice of a new <HI>Fruits</HI> appearing on a young <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree, then of much larger Quantities on a Tree of longer stan∣ding: It becomes <HI>me</HI> therefore to acknowledge it with a singular Affection, that there are in this poor Town so many scores of <HI>young</HI> persons, who having taken upon them a more serious profession of Religion, do endeavour to quicken &amp; strength∣en one another in it, by <HI>meeting</HI> together for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Devotion every week; especially in
<PB N="47" REF="000534_0051_0FA6B686D3881388"/>
the <HI>Evening</HI> after the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> which is a spot of time too meanly and vainly and impertinently<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not to say <HI>perniciously,</HI> spent by multitudes in the midst of us. I count it not the smallest Happiness of my life that I have been for perhap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a dozen years acquainted with some of those use∣ful Meetings; as having in them had more than a little of my <HI>Education,</HI> and my <HI>Preparation,</HI> for my public Ministry. The sense of my Obligations to them, has caused me some while ago to ask their Acceptance of a little Book, Entituled, <HI>Early Piety Exemplify'd,</HI> and intended in a particular manner for <HI>their</HI> Edification; and for the same cause it is, that I now put into their hands another little Dis∣course, recommending unto them, <HI>A victory over the Wicked One;</HI> 'tis because I am desirous that in their Journey Heaven-wards, they may not prove like young Travellers, that at first gallop furiously, but soon <HI>tire,</HI> and come <HI>late</HI> or <HI>lame</HI> home at last; and that while they are upon the Road, they may not be <HI>thrown backwards by the Serpent in the way, the Adder in the path</HI> waiting for them.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> I can from a troublesome Experience tell you, that when once you come to <HI>Renounce</HI> the <HI>Service</HI> and (as then you must) <HI>oppose</HI> the <HI>Interest</HI> of the Devil, he will quickly persecute you with his unwearied <HI>Molestations;</HI> and you are yet in too good terms with him, if you do not already find him, <HI>You Adversary going about like<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Roaring Lion,</HI> When <HI>Sampson</HI> was entring upon the work of God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was not long before the <HI>Lion</HI> Roar'd on him,

For my own part, I mourn bitterly to think, that I have done so <HI>little</HI> towards Destroying and Con∣founding the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of the <HI>Devil;</HI> for which, the writing and spreading of Books is none of the least Expedients; but <HI>something</HI> I have done; and the <HI>Wicked One,</HI> has like a <HI>Dragon,</HI> been spitting <HI>Fire</HI> at me for it. While I was preparing for the Press, one of those little Books which I have sent abroad, the <HI>Devil</HI> from the mouth of a possessed person, in the Audience of several standers by, threatned me with much <HI>Disgrace</HI> for what I was about. Whereupon <HI>presently</HI> and <HI>ever-since,</HI> those great Agents of the Devil, the modern leaders of the poor deluded <HI>Quakers,</HI> have in one Pamphlet after another been loading of me with most viru∣lent and malicious Reproaches, in hopes, <HI>That some will stick;</HI> but the dirt they cast happily proves like that of <HI>Oysters;</HI> it more <HI>cleanses</HI> than <HI>defiles,</HI> The same disturbance, that was given to the De∣vil by that little Book, I am willing should arise unto him from all the rest of my poor composures; and I suppose he will have it from <HI>This,</HI> which <HI>particularly</HI> treats him as our <HI>Enemy,</HI> and <HI>professedly</HI> pursues a <HI>victory</HI> over him. This (which was once a) <HI>Land of Uprightness,</HI> now is not without some people in it, than which I believe, the <HI>Devil</HI> has not more devoted and resolved <HI>Vassals</HI> in all his Territories; people that have sinned <HI>against,</HI> until they have sinned <HI>away,</HI> all the <HI>strivings</HI> of Gods Holy Spirit, and that are now <HI>full of all frau∣dulence and craftiness, and the Enemies of all Righ∣teousness.</HI>

I do expect that if their <HI>father</HI> can have his will, <HI>these</HI> will quickly be inspired with a rage that will vent it self a thousand ways against all my poor Endeavours to annoy that Wicked One. And since, 'tis especially by <HI>Printing</HI> of <HI>Sermons</HI> that I labour to give most provocation to the De∣vil, 'twill be no more surprise to me, if I find the Devil assaying by the <HI>Printing</HI> of <HI>Slanders</HI> to take his Revenges on me; than it was to a man so much better and greater than my self, as <HI>Athana∣sius,</HI> to read the Libels of a wicked Generation a∣gainst him, wherein as the Historian tells it, <HI>Cades, Adulteria, Furta, quicquid Atrox confingi poter a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sancto Viro objiciebantur;</HI> all manner of <HI>Devilism,</HI> was by the Devil forged of that good man; but as 'twill be my Honour herein to endure no other <HI>Buffetings</HI> than what have been bestow'd upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> best of men, so I have already published, in the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth pages of the Discourse which God helped me to make at our last <HI>Anniversary Election,</HI> all the Answer that I count it worth while to give unto whatever Ca∣lumnies a buisy Devil may go to afflict me with.</P>
<P>I mention this rather to alarm <HI>you,</HI> than to comfort <HI>my self,</HI> and I advise you that if the Devil now assault you with various <HI>Temptations,</HI> to divert you and seduce you from the good ways which you are now walking in, you would not <HI>think strange of the trial, as though some strange thing happened unto you.</HI> My Dear Brethren, go ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

'Tis unto <HI>young</HI> men, that we now see an inspired Apostle writing; and unto pious, gracious, Christian <HI>young</HI> men; such <HI>young men</HI> as <HI>all men</HI> may behold a pattern in.

<HEAD>Proposition 1.</HEAD>
<P>We are to look upon the <HI>Devils</HI> as a <HI>Wicked One.</HI> That there are <HI>Devils</HI> in the world, is un∣questionable to all but those absurd <HI>Sadduces,</HI> that say, <HI>seeing is believing,</HI> and will <HI>believe</HI> nothing but what they <HI>see.</HI> And yet if even <HI>seeing</HI> would con∣vince them, after their contemning of the Scrip∣tural Evidence which may be read in Jude 6. and Mat. 18. 16. and Luc. 4. 33. and many other pla∣ces, we have in a manner <HI>seen</HI> such Beings as <HI>De∣vils</HI> are. That is, we have seen such preternatu∣ral operations in some <HI>Enchantments</HI> and <HI>Possession<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> among us, as could never have been without the Existence of <HI>certain spiritual and rational Substan∣ces, as are full of all Wickedness against God, and enmity against man.</HI> Would you know what a De∣vil is? The Apostle gives a description of him, in Eph. 6. 12. <HI>a spiritual wickedness,</HI> that is, <HI>a wicked Spirit.</HI> Hideous Droves of those <HI>wicked Spirits,</HI> being <HI>fallen Angels,</HI> are made prisoners within the Atmosphere of that Earth which we walk upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>High-places</HI> of our <HI>Air,</HI> are, as the Apostle in∣timates, the Receptacles of those <HI>wicked Spirits.</HI> But now,</P>
<P>First, we may look upon all the Devils as ONE. On what account? Briefly, altho' as to their <HI>Indu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tion</HI> they are <HI>several,</HI> yet they are <HI>One</HI> for their <HI>Unanimity.</HI> It is their <HI>agreement</HI> and <HI>union</HI> in mis∣chief, on the score of which they are to be called <HI>One.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="000534_0058_0FA6B68EF9B7DD18"/>
The Devils are <HI>many</HI> for <HI>Number;</HI> their Troops amount unto many <HI>Regions.</HI> We read in Luc 8. 30. about a <HI>Legion</HI> of them, that kept a Garrison in one single person; though a <HI>Legion</HI> contained perhaps twelve thousand and five hundred in it. Very probably there are far more Devils than men in the world; and they swarm like the Frogs of <HI>Egypt</HI> in every one of our Chambers. Yet are they <HI>one</HI> in their <HI>design, one</HI> in their <HI>Interest;</HI> they make as it were <HI>one</HI> grand: Enemy of Mankind &amp; <HI>one</HI> mystical body of Wickedness. They have their Devilish <HI>Confoederacies,</HI> and are <HI>not divided a∣mong themselves:</HI> there are no <HI>Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es.</HI> in the Ar∣mies of Hell, for want of pay: nor do they com∣plain of <HI>hard Marches,</HI> tho' they are always com∣passing of the Earth. They have <HI>one</HI> Commander <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>over them; for there is a <HI>Government; a Monar∣chy</HI> in the infernal Regions, the Commander where∣of is called in <HI>Mat.</HI> 12. 24. <HI>Belzebub, the Prince of Devils.</HI> They have a <HI>grand Segniour</HI> among them; <HI>one</HI> of peculiar Dignity and Influence; this <HI>chief</HI> Devil we may call <HI>the</HI> Devil; but in the same term we likewise comprehend all the <HI>Slaves,</HI> and <HI>Officers,</HI> and <HI>Emissaries</HI> of that Hellish Tyrant.</P>
<P>Secondly, We may also look upon the Devils as a Wicked <HI>One.</HI> The Greek word here notes one who <HI>takes pains</HI> to do amiss. [<HI>ponefos</HI> from <HI>po∣nos</HI>] That is properly a <HI>Wickedness;</HI> to do an ill thing, with <HI>counsel</HI> and <HI>study,</HI> and <HI>labour</HI> in the do∣ing of it; this is just like the Devil indeed! it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard, in I.

may devour.</HI> The Devil is called, a <HI>wicked one,</HI> part∣ly as an object for our <HI>batred;</HI> it is to provoke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> detestation <HI>of</HI> him, our indignation <HI>at</HI> him. As <HI>the Holy One,</HI> is a Name of <HI>honour,</HI> so, the <HI>wicked one</HI> is for a name of <HI>hatred</HI> set before us. He is also call∣ed a <HI>wicked</HI> one, partly, as an object for our <HI>contempt.</HI> Tho he be like a <HI>Lion,</HI> yet he has not <HI>Righteousness</HI> to make him as <HI>bold as a Lion. Wickedness</HI> is ac∣companied with <HI>Weakness;</HI> as one says, it would put a mettle into a Coward to fight with such a <HI>wicked</HI> one as the Devil is.</P>

<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>Proposition II.</HEAD>
<P>The Devil, who is an Enemy to <HI>all</HI> men, is to <HI>young</HI> men a peculiar Enemy.</P>
<P>That the Devil is the Enemy of us <HI>all,</HI> is a thing very sensible unto us; and his <HI>power</HI> is called in the sacred Oracles, <HI>the power of the</HI> Enemy. If you ask, <HI>how</HI> the Devil is our Enemy, the Answer is obvious; he is our <HI>Accuser,</HI> and he is our <HI>Destroy∣er.</HI> The Devil does every day <HI>accuse</HI> us; 'tis his character, Rev. 12. 10. <HI>the Accuser of our Brethren which accuses them before God, day &amp; night.</HI> There is a <HI>Court</HI> some-where kept in the <HI>invisible world,</HI> at which the Devils prefer as many complaints as they can against us; it is in this <HI>Court</HI> that they represent us as doing the <HI>things for which the wrath of God should come upon the Children of Disobedience.</HI> The Devil would also very fain <HI>destroy</HI> us; as he urged against a good man, in Job 1. 11. <HI>put forth
<PB N="56" REF="000534_0060_0FA6B690779BA438"/>
thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh.</HI> The Devils pray and plead, like so many <HI>Atto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nies,</HI> that a <HI>Judgment</HI> may be granted against us all; &amp; they are not satisfy'd unless they themselves be made the <HI>Executioners</HI> thereof.</P>
<P>If you ask, <HI>why,</HI> the Devil is our Enemy, the Reply is likewise easy; 'tis from his malignant <HI>spite</HI> at <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>spleen</HI> at <HI>man:</HI> The Devils can∣not endure that the Name of God should be own∣ed in the world; now 'tis our priviledge that we both do the <HI>Service</HI> of God, and bear the <HI>Image</HI> of God; but because the Devil would be in the Throne of God, therefore he is unwilling that God should have any <HI>Children</HI> or <HI>Subjects</HI> upon the face of the Earth. Moreover, the Devils cannot brook it, that any should be above them; as 'tis intima∣ted, that <HI>pride was the condemnation of the Devil.</HI> Because he sees man <HI>Saved,</HI> and himself <HI>Damned;</HI> man <HI>Advanced,</HI> and himself <HI>Degraded;</HI> hence he will do us all the Hurt he can.</P>
<P>But he that is thus an Enemy to <HI>all</HI> men, is to <HI>young</HI> men, more eminently so. As the Apostle speaks to <HI>Christians,</HI> thus I may to <HI>young</HI> men, in I Pet. 5. 8. <HI>The Devil is your Adversary;</HI> young men, the Devil is remarkably ambitious to make a prey of <HI>your</HI> precious and immortal Souls. The Devil is an <HI>Abaddon and Apollyon;</HI> for to give him his <HI>due,</HI> to him does appertain the Name, which the <HI>Apocalypse</HI> justly puts upon a <HI>great Son</HI> of his. But <HI>young</HI> men do most of all find him such an one; that as our Lord said unto young <HI>Peter,</HI> in Luc 22. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="57" REF="000534_0061_0FA6B69141370130"/>
31. <HI>Behold, Satan hath desired to have you.</HI> So may it be said unto <HI>young</HI> persons, <HI>Behold, Satan is pecu∣liarly desirous to have you in his ravenous, devouring Jaws.</HI> The Devil goes ranging, raging, roaring about the world; and <HI>young</HI> men are those whom he is most concerned for the catching and spoiling of. Some have observed, That most of the Temp∣tations recorded in the Scripture, still fell upon <HI>younger</HI> men. Be sure the Tempter falls foul upon them with a particular eagerness, and energy. And this for two causes.</P>
<P>'Tis first, because the Devil sees a great <HI>likelihood</HI> of prevailing on <HI>young</HI> men. Young men have much <HI>matter</HI> in them, for the <HI>Devil</HI> to work upon; there is much <HI>folly</HI> in <HI>young</HI> men, 'tis said in Prov. 7. 7. <HI>I beheld among the simple ones, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rscerned among the youths, a</HI> young man <HI>void of Understanding:</HI> there is much <HI>vanity.</HI> in young men, 'tis said in Ecl. 11. 10. <HI>Youth is vanity.</HI> Now the <HI>Devil</HI> beholds the natural <HI>folly</HI> and <HI>vanity</HI> of young men, as a ve∣ry agreeable <HI>Tynder,</HI> for the sparks of his insinu∣ations to fall upon. He thinks with himself, <HI>This rash</HI> young <HI>man will suspect none of my hooks and snares; now will be consider his latter End.</HI> He thinks, <HI>This wild young man will take me at my wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and never consider the Chambers of death, which I am bringing him unto.</HI> For this cause he sets upon <HI>young</HI> men with greater <HI>expectation;</HI> and hence u∣sually with greater <HI>frequency</HI> and <HI>industry</HI> than he does assault other Ages. The <HI>Lusts</HI> of <HI>young</HI> men after those three baits of the Devil, <HI>pleasures, pro∣fits,
<PB N="58" REF="000534_0062_0FA6B692032924A0"/>
grandeur,</HI> are more lively and stirring; and hence a particular activity of Hell shall be bestow∣ed upon them.</P>
<P>Secondly, 'Tis because the Devil sees a great <HI>advantage</HI> in prevailing on <HI>young</HI> men. The gain∣ing of <HI>young</HI> men thereunto, is a thing most sig∣nally useful to the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of the Devil. It se∣cures the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of the Devil in their own Souls. If men are converted unto God, it is usually in the <HI>morning</HI> of their days, if they do not then ga∣ther the <HI>Manna</HI> of Christ and Grace, 'tis a thou∣sand to one but they miss of it for ever. God says in Eccl. 12. 1. <HI>Remember thy Creator in the days of thy Youth;</HI> and the devil knows, that if the Creator be not then <HI>Remembred,</HI> it is likely that he I be <HI>forgotten</HI> for ever. The <HI>strong armed</HI> one is very studious to get and keep a <HI>strong hold</HI> in the Soul of a <HI>young</HI> man; as being sensible, that in <HI>Age,</HI> it will be harder to cast him out. We read in the Gospel about a very <HI>painful Dispossession;</HI> but this was the reason of it, Marc. 9. 21. <HI>This evil spi∣rit came unto him of a child.</HI> If the devil make sure of a wretched sinner, till his <HI>youth</HI> he over, 'twill not be easy to eject him; every <HI>new Act</HI> of sin, has given him a <HI>new hold</HI> of the Soul. The Devil haunts the soul of a <HI>young</HI> man, giving interrupti∣on to all the motions of the blessed Jesus, &amp; how∣ling, <HI>What have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Son of God? Art thou come hither to torment us before our time?</HI> But Alas, if the Devil been't shaken off, before <HI>the time</HI> that age grows upon <HI>us,</HI> he will
<PB N="59" REF="000534_0063_0FA6B692B6096B78"/>
ordinarily defie the holy Spirit upon <HI>him;</HI> and he will have a confidence that any <HI>blind</HI> and <HI>lame</HI> De∣vils will be strong enough to maintain the Castle, against our glorious <HI>David.</HI> It also promotes the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of the Devil among their neighbours <HI>Young</HI> men have a special fitness for the Devils <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>usiness; they lay themselves out with more ser∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>our, and more success; they keep more compa∣ny, and so they diffuse their poison further, than can be said of other people. When that <HI>Nebu∣chadnezzar</HI> had work to be done, we find in <HI>Dan.</HI> 1. 4. he will have <HI>young</HI> men brought before him, <HI>skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge.</HI> Thus the furious <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> of Hell, singles out <HI>young</HI> men, that <HI>their</HI> skill and <HI>their</HI> wit, and <HI>their</HI> vigour help to carry on his Affairs, the more effec∣tually. Good old <HI>Austin</HI> therefore said unto a young Gentleman, <HI>Diabolus cupit abs te ornari;</HI> the devil would be glad if such Accomplishments as yours might be employed for him.</P>
<P>From this 'tis, that all <HI>young</HI> men may have their hearts aking to think, how much they are exposed unto the devil; as 'twas cry'd unto that Champion. <HI>The Philistines be upon thee</HI> Sampson; so may it be alarm'd into the ears of young men, <HI>The Philistines of Hell are your peculiar Enemies, O young men, and those Enemies are upon you every day.</HI></P>

<P>First, That Religious <HI>young</HI> men are victorious over the devil, is evident from the <HI>instances</HI> of the <HI>victory.</HI> To instance a little,</P>
<P>First, Religious <HI>young</HI> men there are who over∣come the devil, in respect of the general and na∣tural <HI>Estates</HI> which they are escaped from. What in the condition of them that continue in their un∣regenerate Estate? Alas, 'tis that of <HI>Band-slaves,</HI> and <HI>Captives</HI> to the devil. It may be said of un∣renewed Sinners, as in a 2 pet. 2. 19. <HI>They are o∣verrcome and brought into Bondage;</HI> and it may be said of them, as in 2 Tim. 2. 26. <HI>They are taken Captive,</HI> (and as it were carried away <HI>alive) by the Devil at his will.</HI> The devil has conquered all unrenewed Sinners, and he does horribly lead them, act them, rule over them; he is a sort of a <HI>Prince</HI> and a <HI>God</HI> unto them. But when a Sinner in Converted, he is brought out of this miserable state; he is, according to that in Acts. 26 18. <HI>Turned from the power of Satan unto God.</HI> The devil does not any longer domineer over a Sinner, that is <HI>born again;</HI> he gets rid of his former <HI>Task∣masters,</HI> like <HI>Israel</HI> escaped from <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his Armies. Now 'tis the priviledge of some <HI>young</HI> men, that they are thus brought home to God. We read of one that could say in I King. 18. 11. <HI>I fear the Lord from my youth;</HI> now to <HI>fear</HI> the Lord is to <HI>fight</HI> the devil, with a blessed victory indeed.

There have been young <HI>Josiahs,</HI> that have <HI>sought the Lord while they were yet young;</HI> there have bin young, <HI>Davids,</HI> that have had God for their <HI>Hope;</HI> their <HI>Trust,</HI> their <HI>Teacher</HI> from their <HI>youth;</HI> and there have been young <HI>Samuels,</HI> that have been <HI>waiting</HI> on God, and <HI>bearing</HI> from him, in their early days As one says, <HI>Wisdom, gravity, pru∣dence, temperance, are not always confined unto them, that have wrinkled faces, furrowed Brows, dim eyes, palsey hands, leaning on a Staff.</HI> So may we say of this divine <HI>victory.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Religious <HI>young</HI> men there are, who overcome the devil, in respect of the particular <HI>Trials</HI> that are made upon them. The devil makes these and those particular Batteries upon <HI>young</HI> men; he says, <HI>I'le now trip up the heels of this young man,</HI> and immediately applies all his Engines to draw the poor <HI>young</HI> man into some <HI>abominable thing.</HI> The devil is conquered in such Encounters, when he can't proceed and prevail in them; 'tis said in Jam. 4. 7. <HI>Resist the Devil, and he will flee from you.</HI> The Devil is meerly over∣come, when a tempted Soul, silences his Banters, with saying like our Lord, <HI>Get thee behind me Satan,</HI> or as <HI>Job</HI> answered a Fool, <HI>Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh.</HI> As on the other side, when <HI>David</HI> sends for a Mistriss, when <HI>Peter</HI> denie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> his Master, when <HI>Confessors</HI> come to Recant th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Cause of God, then the Devil gets the day, and goes with flying colours out of the Field. But it is the priviledge of some <HI>young</HI> men, that they
<PB N="62" REF="000534_0066_0FA6B698EEAB3460"/>
come off well in their spiritual Combates. We read of such a <HI>young</HI> man in Gen 39. 9. who be∣ing sollicited unto sin, vanquish'd and extinguish'd the sollicitation, by answering. <HI>How shall I do this wickedness, and sin against God?</HI> There are <HI>young</HI> men that won't be gull'd by the proposals of the Devil; but know how to fli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht them and scorn them all, and with an holy bravery, make him weary of tendring them. Some <HI>young</HI> men are before all the Devils of <HI>Hell,</HI> as young <HI>Jeremiah</HI> was before those of <HI>Earth; Defenced Cities, Iron Pillars, Brazen Walls;</HI> the devils <HI>fight against them, but cannot prevail against them.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, That it is a singular and special <HI>Ho∣nour</HI> unto <HI>young</HI> men to be thus victorious, is evi∣dent from the <HI>qualities</HI> of the <HI>Enemy.</HI> It is said in Prov. 16. 32, <HI>He that rules his own spirit, is better than he that taketh a City;</HI> and indeed there have been those great <HI>Plunderers</HI> and <HI>Murderers,</HI> whom we call <HI>Conquerors,</HI> in the world, that have <HI>taken Cities,</HI> when they could not subdue the passions &amp; Phrensies of their own <HI>Spirits.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fortior est qui se, quam qui fortissima vincit Moenia—</HI></P>
<P>But what is it then to be Conquerors over those vast throngs of <HI>Spirits</HI> which assail us from the world <HI>which is not seen, and is Eternal?</HI> Indeed the victory is not purely <HI>our own,</HI> it is said in Rom. 8. 37. <HI>We are more than Conquerors, through him that
<PB N="63" REF="000534_0067_0FA6B699C3656668"/>
has lived us.</HI> Nevertheless, the <HI>victory</HI> becomes <HI>ours,</HI> because <HI>he that hath loved us,</HI> makes us <HI>active</HI> in it; the <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> employ's the hands of the young <HI>David</HI> when 'tis He Himself that lays the <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liah</HI> of Hell sprawling on the ground before us; and the victory makes for our <HI>Honour.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Young</HI> men, have you <HI>overcome the Wicked One <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Then.</P>
<P>First, you have overcome a <HI>potent Enemy.</HI> 'Twas said in Judg. 14. 18. <HI>What stronger than a Lion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> But you have been too hard for a <HI>stronger Lion,</HI> than that which Roared upon <HI>Sampson</HI> of old. Tho' they say, <HI>The Lion is not so fierce as he is pain∣ted,</HI> I am sure, 'tis impossible to paint or speak what a <HI>Lion</HI> the <HI>Devil</HI> is.</P>
<P>The Devils have us at a mighty disadvantage, upon this account; it is said in Eph.6. 12. <HI>We fight not against flesh and blood, but against principa∣lities &amp; powers, and</HI> spiritual <HI>wickednesses;</HI> the De∣vils are <HI>spiritual,</HI> and that renders them very <HI>pow∣erful;</HI> they can <HI>smite</HI> us when we can't <HI>see</HI> them; they can attack us &amp; surprise us, by undiscoverable stratagems. Add unto this, That the devils which fall upon us, may say, as they said in that poor man of old, <HI>We are many;</HI> and these <HI>many</HI> devils have our hearts on their parts; there is in us a <HI>party</HI> for them. 'Tis a piece of most Heavenly Gallantry to overcome such an Enemy.</P>
<P>Secondly, You have overcome a <HI>subtle</HI> Enemy. He has those things that are called in 2 Cor. 2. 11. <HI>His Devices.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="000534_0068_0FA6B69A70981428"/>
There are above twenty names put upon the Devil in the Scripture; and not a few of them are forch'd from his <HI>Deceitfulness.</HI> Hence particu∣larly, this <HI>Father of Lies,</HI> is called in Rev. 12. 9. <HI>The old Serpent;</HI> he has not only the <HI>paw</HI> of the <HI>Lion,</HI> but also the <HI>head</HI> of the <HI>Serpent,</HI> and he has <HI>wiles</HI> as well as <HI>darts</HI> to molest us with. The de∣vils have the <HI>experience</HI> of more than five thousand years to furnish them with skill; and you know who says <HI>Multitude of years teaches Wisdom.</HI> How easily might these old <HI>Souldiers</HI> out-wit us a com∣pany of raw, new, unexperienced little Folks, that are <HI>but of yesterday, and know nothing!</HI> how many <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ricks,</HI> and <HI>Arts</HI> have they to manage their mali∣cious Intreagues withal? For such a cunning <HI>Ene∣my</HI> to be overcome is wonderful!</P>
<P>Thirdly, you have overcome a <HI>restless</HI> Enemy. 'Tis said of him in I Pet. 5. 8. <HI>He goes about.</HI> Like his eldest Son, <HI>Cain,</HI> he is <HI>A Vagabond:</HI> he gave that account of himself, in Job 1. 7 <HI>I came from going to and from the Earth.</HI> But it is to trepan and rume us, that he goes about. This Prince goes in <HI>progress,</HI> rides a <HI>Circuit</HI> through his whole Dominions to see how his business is carried on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and all his Vassals are also travelling in the prose∣cution of this devilish business. No <HI>Beasts</HI> of prey do toil with such a painful, watchful, inde∣fatigable Industry, as the Devils do for the ruine of Souls; they lull others <HI>asleep</HI> what they can, but they never can take any <HI>sleep</HI> themselves; I may say of them, <HI>They wonder up and down for

Souls, and grudge if they be not satisfy'd.</HI> For such a busy <HI>Enemy</HI> to be overcome, how great a thing is it!</P>

<P><HI>Young</HI> men; There are too many of you, that are to this day in the <HI>Devils</HI> Vassalage; and that have the curse of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am</HI> upon you, to be the <HI>Ser∣vant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of servants.</HI> Let me tell you plainly, fairly, faithfully, who among you, are yet the Slaves of the <HI>Wicked One.</HI></P>
<P>I am to tell you, That all <HI>wordly</HI> young men, are among those miserable slaves.

<P>I am once more, to tell you, that all <HI>unconverted</HI> young men are under this woful Slavery. To all that are not born from above, belongs the Descrip∣tion in Eph. 2 2: <HI>They walk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> according to the prince of the power of the Air.</HI> Young men, don't you <HI>walk</HI> as the Devil would have you to <HI>walk?</HI> if the devil say, <HI>Live without prayer, and without Christ and without God;</HI> an unconverted young man lives accordingly.

pilgrims, and be astonished. Yea, this Tyrant will be not content unless the very <HI>life</HI> and <HI>blood</HI> of men be sacrificed unto him. 'Tis well known what was done this way among the cursed <HI>Atheni∣ans</HI> of old; and among the <HI>Romans</HI> afterwards. The poor Heathen could fall into no calamity, but presently there must be found men among them to be made <HI>Katharmata</HI> for a publick Expiation.

Behold what your Ma∣ster is! But, ye inconsiderate youths, what will become of you, if you continue thus <HI>Enslaved?</HI> Briefly, all the blows, and all the plagues, that fall upon the <HI>Devils,</HI> must also fall upon your unhappy Souls. Your doom at last will be that, in Matth. 25. 41. <HI>Depart ye cursed, into everlasting fire, pre∣pared for the Devil and his Angels.</HI> As, the <HI>Devil and his Angels,</HI> thus the <HI>Devil and his Vassals,</HI> must be together punished in <HI>Everlasting Fire.</HI> In the <HI>Day of the Lord</HI> that shall <HI>burn as an Oven,</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ will say to the impenitent young man, <HI>since you like so well to be with the Devil, you shall now go and be with him</HI> for ever.</P>

<P N="2">II. Having so shaken off the Tyranny of the
<PB N="69" REF="000534_0073_0FA6B69E0FA5AD20"/>
<HI>Wicked One,</HI> then, <HI>young men,</HI> endeavour to <HI>overcome</HI> him, in all your particular Encounters with him; endeavour, that the Devil may find you too <HI>strong</HI> for him, when-ever he shall make his bloody <HI>As∣saults</HI> upon your Souls.</P>
<P>There are two things that I am now to set be∣fore you: the first is, <HI>In what</HI> you <HI>should</HI> be; the second is, <HI>By what</HI> you <HI>may</HI> be, victorious over the Wicked One.</P>
<P>First, IN WHAT? There are many things; <HI>wherein</HI> you should overcome the Devil. In gene∣ral, I would only say,</P>
<P>Let not the Devil overcome you, when he <HI>tempts</HI> you to any sin whatever; and especially to the sins which <HI>your age</HI> is more peculiarly dispos'd unto. Whenever the Devil urges you to an evil thing, rebuke and repel his Temptations, with such an Answer as our Saviour once gave unto him, in Mat. 16. 23. <HI>Get thee behind me Satan.</HI> Courageously, reply, <HI>Satan, have done,</HI> and, <HI>Satan, be gone!</HI> and make him <HI>turn his bark</HI> upon <HI>you,</HI> by turning of yours upon <HI>him.</HI> But there are some sins <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which, <HI>your age</HI> is more eminently inclined, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by which 'tis most of all endangered. I pray, let <HI>These</HI> be the Objects of your more undoubted <HI>victory,</HI> and therefore of your more solicitous <HI>watchfulness.</HI> It was the Advice of the Apostle to that young man, whom old <HI>Chrysostom</HI> I remember, very justly styl'd, <HI>a wonderful youth,</HI> in 2 Tim 2. 22. <HI>Flee youthful lusts.</HI> As there are the Lusts of every <HI>place;</HI> the Prophet notes it about the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> they were a

<HI>bitter</HI> and <HI>hasty</HI> and furious people; and the A∣postle notes it about the <HI>Cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tans,</HI> they were a peo∣ple grievously given to <HI>Lying:</HI> the Levity of <HI>France,</HI> the Haughtiness of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Revengful∣ness of <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Drunkenness of <HI>Germany,</HI> has been the Remark of us <HI>English-men,</HI> who per∣haps give too great l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ences of all those vices.

Indeed, the best <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght</HI> with these, is a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>light</HI> from them; here, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</HI> these are the Ene∣mies whereof the <HI>Captain of our Salvation</HI> has gi∣ven us that word of Command, <HI>Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>!</HI> But what are they? what be the <HI>Names</HI> of them?</P>
<P>First Overcome the Devil, when he Tempts you to the <HI>youthful</HI> sin of <HI>Evil-company keeping.</HI> Where may you look to see a Carnal <HI>young man?</HI> The wise men has told us, in Prov. 7. 7. <HI>I behold among the simple o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, I discerned among the youths, a young man.</HI> The Devil would fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cy young men, into the Knots, and Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of what they call, <HI>Good Fellowship;</HI> he would perswade them to <HI>Mer∣ry-Meetings,</HI> and link them with such Associates as will Drink and Drab and Game, and be infinitely wicked, and help to drown one another in perditi∣on. But when you are thus tempted, by the <HI>De∣vil,</HI> forget not the caution of your Saviour, <HI>My

Son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</HI> If you have been seduced into a Society and Intimacy with ungodly persons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>magine that you hear that Counsel from on High unto you, <HI>Depart from the Tents of those wicked ones, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you perish in all their sins!</HI> and that you hear that Thunder of Heaven over you, <HI>A Companion of Fools shall be destroyed</HI> I Think with your selves, whether you would be willing to spend your Eternity with such Compa∣nions; and whether it be not convenient for you <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> to say, <HI>Depart from me, ye evil-doers, for I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Commandments of my God!</HI> unto those wild Creatures, unto whom the Lord Jesus will one day say, <HI>Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting Fire?</HI> O let not the Devil cause you now to be Familiar with the Robbers and the Cut-throats of your Souls; and with hose of whom your Death-bed Groans will be, <HI>Lord, gather not my soul with such unhappy sinners.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Overcome the Devil when he tempts you to the <HI>youthful</HI> sin of <HI>Uncleanness.</HI> It is a pas∣sage relating probably to the young men of <HI>Sodom,</HI> in Job 36. 14. <HI>They dy in youth, their life is among the unclean.</HI> The <HI>Uncleannesses</HI> into the Quagmires whereof young men too often plunge themselves, to use the Apostles cleanly language, 'tis a shame <HI>to speak of them.</HI> 'Tis a monstrous and a cursed <HI>wantonness,</HI> wherein young people too often indulge themselves; and some things that are counted the parts of a gentile breeding do but cast oyl into the Hellish Flames of that <HI>wantonness:</HI> I mean parti∣culars

<HI>promiscuous Dancings,</HI> against which the faith∣ful Servants of God in all Ages have born their ve∣ry zealous Testimonies.

<P>Avoid all <HI>Uncleanness</HI> whatsoever; and particu∣larly, beware of having light thoughts about some sorts of <HI>Uncleanness</HI> wherein many young people have been so infatuated as to excuse themselves.

<P>Thirdly, Overcome the De`vil, when he tempts
<PB N="74" REF="000534_0078_0FA6B6A5834FBB88"/>
you to the <HI>youthful</HI> sin of <HI>Drunkenness.</HI> 'Tis a sharp <HI>Irony</HI> in the Speech of the Wiseman to the young man, Eccl. 11. 9. <HI>Rejoice, O young man in thy youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy youth.</HI> And the Devil perswades many a foolish young man, to think or act, as if this were a liberty in <HI>good earnest</HI> allow'd unto him. Alas, how common is it for young persons to be at merry Bouts, and there to disguise themselves by a sin so much worse than <HI>Beastly,</HI> that the very <HI>Bruits</HI> themselves cannot be frequently or easily compelled into it! But I beseech all young people to beware of this pernicious vice, from which I had almost said, <HI>None returns to take hold on the path of life.</HI> The careful Father that heard his young Son was given to <HI>Gaming</HI> and <HI>Whoring,</HI> and some such things, yet encouraged himself with hopes that <HI>Age would Cure</HI> him: but when he heard he was become addicted un∣to Drunkenness, with despair he cry'd out, <HI>Nay then, I have no hope concerning him.</HI> Dili∣gent Enquires have been able to find but one or two Notorious Drunkards in an Age, made so∣ber men; Drunkenness is <HI>Vitium maximo adhe∣ventia;</HI> it is rare that any leave it off; see deut. 21. 18, 19, 20, 21.

the <HI>Reckoning</HI> that is to come <HI>at the last!</HI> Of <HI>Drunkenness</HI> we are told in Prov. 23. 32. <HI>At the last, it bites, it stings;</HI> and indeed how should it o∣therwise? for it breaks not <HI>one,</HI> but <HI>all</HI> of the Commandments; <HI>Ebrietas in se culpas complectitur omnes.</HI> Hence, how many Drunkards have <HI>at the last</HI> roared out, <HI>Ale-houses are Hell-houses!</HI> Know it, that <HI>at the last,</HI> you shall <HI>for every cup of pleasure here</HI> (as one expresses it) <HI>receive a gallon of Wo.</HI> Let all young people take up a just prejudice against this <HI>youthful,</HI> but <HI>woful</HI> vice; and bear in mind that word of God in Isa 28. 1. <HI>Wo to Drunkards.</HI> Young men, 'twill bring a <HI>wo</HI> upon your <HI>Nanes;</HI> your <HI>Credit</HI> irreparably falls and breaks every time you Reel with Drink.

However, the irreclaimable Drunkard cannot escape the <HI>vengeance of eternal Fire,</HI> he must be Tormented for-ever in those Fires, from whence his vain and sad cries will be continually going up, <HI>O for a drop of w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er to cool<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry longue!</HI> We pity that King who of old lost a <HI>Kingdom</HI> for a cup of <HI>drink; but</HI> the drunkard will do a more la∣mentable thing; he loses a <HI>Soul</HI> for a cup of <HI>drink,</HI> a loss which the <HI>gain of the whole world</HI> would not compensate; and he procures himself a <HI> ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>shm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht</HI> and an exclusion from <HI>the Kingdom of Heaven for ever.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, Overcome the devil, when he tempts you to the <HI>youthful</HI> sin of <HI>Haughtiness.</HI> We read concerning a <HI>Novice,</HI> in I Tim. 3. 6. there is dan∣ger <HI>least being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the condemnation of the Devil.</HI> Truly, <HI>young people</HI> are but <HI>Novices;</HI> whatever good they have or do, they are <HI>but newly come to it;</HI> it will be a wonder if the devil do not look them, as he did <HI>Rehoboam</HI> into Ruine, by their Pride, unto which they are too naturally disposed by their self-igno∣rance and their small experience. In many Obses∣sions we see the devil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI> lymp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nizing</HI> the Bodies, which he has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into; he swells them most unreasonably. But O let not the devil cause
<PB N="77" REF="000534_0081_0FA6B6A7C31A1140"/>
you to <HI>swell</HI> with any proud Apprehensions of your selves; be not proud of your own Abilities, your own Excellencies, your own performances; but let a most humble <HI>modesty</HI> accompany your whole Behaviour. The Devil will trip you into some grievous <HI>fall,</HI> when once he has got you <HI>lifted up with pride.</HI> But, there is also a more childish kind of <HI>pride,</HI> which the airy minds of young people, are too prone unto; and that is, <HI>A pride in Appa∣rel.</HI> There is a certain flant of Gayety and Vanity in Attire, wherein young people do too often ma∣nifest their inward inclinations to Extravagancies; and sometimes they go so far as to transgress the <HI>seventh Commandment</HI> in it. We that are <HI>Protest∣ants</HI> may blush to read what rebukes the graven sort of <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> themselves have bestow'd upon such Exorbitancies. One of them has writ∣ten a whole Book of Reprehensions to <HI>Naked Breasts and Shoulders;</HI> and others of them have published whole Discourses, <HI>Contre les vains Ornemens de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣femmes,</HI> against the <HI>vain Ornaments of the Female Sex.</HI> Young People, would you have <HI>Ornament's.</HI> The Apostle says in I Pet. 5. 5. <HI>Be Adorned with Humility;</HI> Humility it self is represented there as the most comely knot of <HI>Ribons</HI> in the world. Let your <HI>Garments</HI> not want any Decency, but let your <HI>vertues</HI> be your chiefest Ornaments. [study I pet. 3. 3, 4, 5.] To use the Expressions of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ancient; I pray, ponder, <HI>whence you came;</HI> that will make you <HI>blush;</HI> ponder, <HI>what you are;</HI> that will make you <HI>sigh;</HI> ponder, <HI>where you go;</HI> tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

will make you <HI>shake.</HI> Mortify your <HI>Pride</HI> with all humbling Thoughts; and be able to say with young <HI>David,</HI> in Psal. 131. 1. <HI>Lord, my Heart is not haughty; nor mine eyes lofty.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, Overcome the Devil, when he tempts you to the <HI>youthful</HI> sin of <HI>Inconsiderateness.</HI> It is mentioned as the rashness of many a <HI>young</HI> man, in Prov. 7. 23. He <HI>is as a Bird hastning to the snare, and he knows not that it is for his life.</HI> How few young persons are there, that ever trouble them∣selves about, <HI>wherefore's?</HI> and <HI>what if's?</HI> and the greatest consequences? For the most part they put none of their concerns into <HI>Ballances,</HI> and they come under that reproof, <HI>My people do not consider.</HI></P>
<P>But let young people now <HI>consider,</HI> that the God of Heaven is uttering over them such a wish as that in Deut. 32. 29. <HI>O that they were wise, that they would consider their latter end?</HI> We read about a young <HI>Isaac,</HI> that it was his manner, to <HI>walk in the Fields for Meditation.</HI> O that young persons were so <HI>wise,</HI> as to Retire and <HI>Consider</HI> upon the circumstances of their Souls! Retire and <HI>look upward;</HI> consider <HI>who</HI> made you, and <HI>what</HI> he has prepared for you, If you seek Him. Retire, and <HI>look downward;</HI> con∣sider the Everlasting <HI>Fire</HI> and the Never-dying <HI>worm,</HI> which is reserved for the Torture of all im∣penitent Unbelievers. Retire, and <HI>look backward;</HI> consider the sin in which you were <HI>born,</HI> and the many Follies and Errors which you have <HI>lived</HI> in. Retire, and <HI>look forward;</HI> consider the <HI>death,</HI> and the <HI>Judgment,</HI> and the <HI>Eternity,</HI> into which you are
<PB N="79" REF="000534_0083_0FA6B6AA76639580"/>
hastening apace every day. Retire, and <HI>look in∣ward;</HI> consider, whether you have yet made your <HI>peace</HI> with God, and whether you are yet arriv'd unto a blessed <HI>Union</HI> and <HI>Communion</HI> with the Lord Jesus Christ. Let every young person become like that <HI>Ephraim,</HI> and that <HI>Prodigal,</HI> whom in the Bi∣ble we find considerately bemoaning of themselves. If the Devil offer you at any time a <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t,</HI> present∣ly consider whether some cruel <HI>Hook</HI> be not covered with it; and be able to say like that <HI>young Saint,</HI> in Psal. 119. 59. O Lord, <HI>I thought on my ways, and I turned my feet unto thy Testimonies.</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly, Overcome the Devil, when he tempts you to the <HI>youthful</HI> sin of <HI>Apostasy.</HI> Of many young persons may that complaint be made, in <HI>Hos.</HI> 6. 4. <HI>your Goodness is as the morning cloud, and as the early Dew it go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th away.</HI> 'Tis not unusual for persons in their <HI>youth</HI> to have many Convictions on their minds; they have some troubles, <HI>O what shall I do to be Saved?</HI> and they have some wishes, <HI>O that I may dy the death of the Righteous:</HI> But what comes of all? They frequently vanish like the <HI>mor∣ning cloud,</HI> any the <HI>early Dew;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these people never could be really <HI>young Saints,</HI> yet from being seemingly such, they become <HI>old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> as a wretch∣ed Proverb has expressed it; and this is from the Seduction of that <HI>old Devil,</HI> who is himself the firsh and worst Apostate that ever was. But, <HI>young</HI> men, if you have lest off any of your old sinful ways, tremble to return like a <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> to that vomit, like a <HI>Swine</HI> to that quagmire, any more. Let not

the <HI>foul Spirit</HI> which will cause you to <HI>leave off the thing that is good,</HI> Renew his Interest in you; it will quickly render you <HI>seven times worse than you were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> Tremble at forsaking of those Devo∣tions and Societies whereat you have sometimes had your <HI>Hearts burning</HI> within you; Tremble at Em∣bracing any more those Abominable things, which you have pretendedly given a bill of <HI>Divorce</HI> unto; such <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ksladings</HI> will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndanger your hearing that voice from Heaven, which thunderstruck the mise∣rable <HI>Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> upon his Apostasy, <HI>Hence! Hence! thou vile Apostate! and carry away the Sentence of thy E∣ternal Damnation in thy Soul!</HI> Forget not that word of the Lord Jesus, in Luc. 9. 62. <HI>No man having put has hand to the Plough, and looking back, is sit for the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> And forget not that word of the Lord Jesus, in Heb 10. 38. <HI>If a∣ny man draw back my Soul shall have no pleasure in him.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, Overcome the Devil, when he tempts you to the <HI>youthful</HI> sin of <HI>Mispending precious time.</HI> We are told of some young men, in Job 32. 2. <HI>In whom old age is perished,</HI> or, as it may be rendred, <HI>In whom time is perished.</HI> Little do the most of young people know or weigh the worth of <HI>Time;</HI> it lies like a dead Commodity on their hands, and be∣cause they have so much of it they contrive that monstrous thing which they call, <HI>pastime,</HI> to get it off. But God forbid, that you should any more allow your selves in such a transcendent madness, as the ill husbandry of <HI>Time.</HI> O this invaluable
<PB N="81" REF="000534_0085_0FA6B6ADE28B27A8"/>
Jewel! <HI>Time!</HI> this Treasure, the <HI>Enjoyment</HI> where∣of is of all things the most uncertain, this Trea∣sure, the <HI>Improvement</HI> whereof is of all things the most important; be no more spendthrifts of it; but be always either doing or getting of some good while you have <HI>time</HI> by the Forelock. <HI>Young</HI> peo∣ple, you reckon upon a <HI>long time;</HI> but you must <HI>reckon again.</HI> It has been said, <HI>The old man has death before his-Face, but the young man has death be∣hind his back;</HI> Death may be as near to you, as to your Grand-father. Besides were you to live unto Gray-hairs, how fast will one year after another slip away! no <HI>Post,</HI> no <HI>Ship,</HI> no <HI>Eagle,</HI> moves with such velocity. Be assured, let the <HI>Devil</HI> tell you what he will, it wont be long before your <HI>time</HI> will all be flown away; I may say as in I Cor. 7. 29. <HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is short.</HI> But when this time is gone there will be two dismal issues of your mispending it. First, <HI>you</HI> must be <HI>accountable;</HI> it is a warning of Heaven to every young man, <HI>Know thou, that God will for this bring thee into Judgment.</HI> The great God will make that solemn demand, <HI>What have you done with the time that I lent you?</HI> And then also, <HI>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> will not be <HI>recoverable;</HI> what the Wiseman says o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Love,</HI> may be said of this, when once 'tis gone from us, <HI>If a man would give all the substance of his House for it, it would utterly be contemned.</HI> There tho' we cry never so bitterly, <HI>Lord, Lord, for a lit∣tle of the time that we have lost,</HI> no tears of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will fetch back one hour of it. Wherefore, that much of your little <HI>Time,</HI> say of every day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aga∣zin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

used of a fair day, <HI>'Tis pity such a day should be lost;</HI> squander none of your life away in <HI>Diversions</HI> whol∣ly impertinent: prize your <HI>Time</HI> now, as you will when 'tis just expiring; and follow the Divine Counsel in Eph. 5. 15. <HI>Walk not as Fools, but as Wise, Redeeming of the Time.</HI></P>
<P>These are some of the things <HI>In what</HI> you are to overcome the Wicked One. But,</P>
<P>Secondly, BY WHAT? And in general, the direction for us, is that of the Apostle, in Eph. 6. 11. <HI>Put on the whole Armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the De∣vil.</HI> For a <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt,</HI> let the <HI>truths</HI> of God, be un∣to you as the <HI>girdle of your Loins;</HI> and unto the knowledge of divine <HI>Truths,</HI> add <HI>Sincerity</HI> of <HI>Heart</HI> and <HI>Integrity</HI> of <HI>Life</HI> before the Lord. For a <HI>Breast-plate,</HI> put on <HI>Righteousness;</HI> preserve the <HI>vitals</HI> of your inner-man harmless by a thorough work of Sanctification, and a <HI>Conscience void of of∣fence towards God and Man.</HI> For a pair of <HI>Shoes,</HI> go to the Gospel, which declares and settles a <HI>peace</HI> between God and us; that the <HI>Counsels</HI> and <HI>Comforts</HI> thereof, may prepare us for all our Trials! For a <HI>shield,</HI> hold up your <HI>Faith</HI> against the <HI>venemous darts</HI> of Hell that may be hurled at you; let that put you under the conduct of the Lord Jesus, and be to you the <HI>Evidence of things not seen.</HI> For an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>delmet,</HI> get a <HI>lively Hope</HI> that you shall be <HI>saved</HI> or ever; and hereby let your <HI>Heads</HI> be guarded a∣all<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t all hard thoughts of God: and of his Grace:</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="000534_0087_0FA6B6B106BA3E880"/>
This is a <HI>defensive Armour</HI> against the Devil, which better befits every young person, than that of <HI>Saul</HI> did the young <HI>David</HI> of old. But there is one <HI>offensive weapon,</HI> with which we are to manage our Combate against the Devil; and there are two <HI>Stratagems</HI> to be annexed there∣unto.</P>
<P>In short, there are two particular Directions, for our Encounters with the <HI>Wicked One;</HI> and the quoting of two Texts may lay them suffi∣ciently before us.</P>
<P>The first proper Direction for us, is that in Eph. 6. 17. <HI>Take the Sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</HI> Compare our Context, I Joh. 2. 14. If young men would <HI>overcome the wicked one,</HI> they must have the <HI>word of God abi∣ding in them.</HI></P>
<P>The Bible is a <HI>spiritual sword</HI> shaped and formed by the Inspirations of the <HI>Eternal Spirit;</HI> and for a Conflict with the <HI>Infernal Spirit,</HI> it is a <HI>sword</HI> where∣of I may say as <HI>David</HI> of <HI>Goliah's, There is none like it.</HI> When the blackest and fiercest of all the de∣vils made an Onset upon our blessed Saviour, and this with all the three Batteries which he once fa∣tally overthrew the first <HI>Adam</HI> withal, how did our Lord <HI>overcome the wicked one?</HI> It was by reply∣ing upon him, <HI>It is written,</HI> and by holding up a∣gainst him the <HI>Scripture</HI> of God. It is remarkable that all the <HI>swords</HI> or <HI>words</HI> used by our Lord for the <HI>overcoming</HI> of the devil were fetched from that one Book of <HI>Deuteronomy;</HI> but how rich a Maga∣zine
<PB N="84" REF="000534_0088_0FA6B6B17A1D9FE0"/>
may the whole Bible then be unto us?</P>
<P>Let all young people then study the Word of God; we read in Psal 119. 9. Of <HI>a young man</HI> thus cleansing of his way. There was once a young Gentlewoman, that before she was <HI>Nine years old</HI> could say, all the New Testament by <HI>Heart.</HI> O that all young persons would every day seriously and pensively Read the Bible, till their Hearts were become, as <HI>Jerome</HI> call'd his Friends, <HI>The Libraries of the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> Young people, see that you become ready at <HI>Scrip∣ture;</HI> and learn to Fence with a sentence of <HI>Scrip∣ture</HI> against all the passes that the devil is making at you. All the <HI>Commandments,</HI> all the <HI>Promises,</HI> all the <HI>Threatnings</HI> of the Bible, will be like so many <HI>swords all-edge,</HI> for your service against the <HI>wicked one.</HI> Let the devil see, that you bear in mind what is <HI>written</HI> in Eccl. 11. 9, in Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21. and other such awful places. These <HI>Writ∣tens</HI> will be more terrible to the Devil, than the Hand-writing on the wall, was to the <HI>Babylonian</HI> Emperour; such is his <HI>Antipathy</HI> to them, that if you thus <HI>Resist the Devil, he will flee from you.</HI></P>
<P>The second proper Direction for us, is in Mat. 26. 41. <HI>Watch and Pray, that ye enter not into temptation.</HI></P>
<P>When the Devil is busy with us, 'tis by these two Duties that we may overcome him and his Temptations.</P>
<P>First, <HI>Be watchful.</HI> Or, in <HI>Solomons</HI> Dialect, <HI>Be fearful.</HI> Here, quite contrary to what is in other Warfares, The best <HI>Souldier</HI> is he that <HI>feareth al∣way
<PB N="85" REF="000534_0089_0FA6B6B2374EFB38"/>
ways.</HI> Be always on your guard; and continually suspect that the <HI>wicked one</HI> has an <HI>ill design</HI> upon you. Be so watchful, as to keep an Eye upon the <HI>Season</HI> which the devil may be most likely to make an <HI>Hour of temptation.</HI> Is it with you a time of <HI>Security?</HI> Are you grown formal, flighty, weary in Religion? Are your Graces in a slumber? Then wake presently; if you ben't now very watchful, the Devil will serve you, as the Watchmen did the <HI>sleepy</HI> Soul, in Cant. 5. 7. <HI>Smite you, wound you.</HI> Or, are you very confident of your selves? are you ready to say, <HI>I shall never be moved?</HI> Then also wake pre∣sently; for if you be not now watchful, the de∣vil will break your bones, as much as he did pre∣sumptuous <HI>Peters,</HI> when our Lord said unto him, in Luc. 22. 31. <HI>Satan has desired to have you.</HI> Or, Is it with you a time of <HI>prosperity?</HI> Are you <HI>Out∣wardly</HI> under the smiles of God? Do Riches and Honours come in upon you? Be sure the Devil will now have a blow at you, if you be not very watchful: this was wise <HI>Agurs</HI> apprehension. For this cause 'tis said in Prov. 1. 32. <HI>The prosperity of Fools shall destroy them;</HI> it furnisheth the Devil with opportunities. When we have an high Sail, he will try to overset us. Or, are you <HI>Inwardly</HI> hap∣py in the Light of Gods Countenance? Have you newly been <HI>sealed</HI> with Assurances of his Favour? Be sure you shall now also find that the Devil will not let you alone. When <HI>Paul</HI> had been in Rap∣tures, we find in 2 Cor. 12. 7. he is not long free from the <HI>Buffetings of the Devil.</HI> If we have been
<PB N="86" REF="000534_0090_0FA6B6B308B4FD18"/>
in the Mount with God, it is well if you been't quickly pushed upon breaking both Tables of the Law. And yet also perswade your selves that in a time of <HI>Adversity</HI> too, you shan't be free from <HI>Temptation:</HI> He that fell upon our Lord, <HI>when he was hungry,</HI> will fall upon us <HI>when we are troubled.</HI> You had now need beware lest you either <HI>despise the chastening of the Lord,</HI> or <HI>faint, when rebuked of Him;</HI> for you will be shrowdly tempted unto both of these.</P>
<P>Be so watchful as likewise to mind the <HI>Subject</HI> which the devil visits with his Temptations. 'Tis the <HI>Heart,</HI> that the devil falls upon; wherefore, as the wise man says in Prov. 4. 25. <HI>Keep they heart with all diligence.</HI> Be vigilant about the <HI>tempers</HI> &amp;<HI>postures</HI> of your own hearts, take notice of the <HI>Bi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss</HI> which is upon them. Know what part you are most <HI>vulnerable</HI> in; and be not like those to whom our Saviour said, <HI>Ye know not what spirit you are of.</HI> That part of your disposition, which like a <HI>Dlilah,</HI> is most likely to betray you into the hands of the hellish <HI>Philistines,</HI> be most exact in your observations of; and let not the devil therein circumvent you, and entangle you.</P>
<P>Finally, Be watchful as to keep always alive within you; <HI>a sense of the Love of God in Christ.</HI> That is the <HI>peace</HI> of which we are told in Phil. 4. 7. <HI>It shall keep our hearts;</HI> 'tis a military word, <HI>To keep as in Garrison.</HI> O get a rellish of the divine Love in the Mission and Passion of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in our admission to the saving be∣nefits
<PB N="87" REF="000534_0091_0FA6B6B3B6BFA3E8"/>
thereof; this will be a sort of a <HI>garrison</HI> for our Souls, and free us very much from the distur∣bance of our Temptations; it will not be easy for the devil now to disturb the serenity and satisfac∣tion, and holy inclinations of our minds. If we begin at any time therefore to lose the lively sense of this <HI>Love,</HI> be so watchful as immediately to recover it; and so, tho' the <HI>Archers</HI> of Hell may sorely grieve us, yet like young <HI>Joseph,</HI> we may have our <HI>Bow abide in strength.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Be prayerful;</HI> and like <HI>Paul, beseech the Lord thrice.</HI> He that would be little in <HI>Temptation,</HI> let him be much in <HI>Supplication.</HI> When the devil is galling of you, do like those Warriours in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Chron. 5. 20. <HI>Cry to</HI> God <HI>in the Battel.</HI> Keep con∣tinually praying unto God, that he would <HI>gird you with strength unto your Battels, and subdue, under you the Devils that rise up against you.</HI> The Trumpet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of <HI>Gideon</HI> did not more fright the <HI>Midianites,</HI> than your <HI>prayers</HI> will the <HI>Devils</HI> that are vexing you. The woful day wherein the Devil gave poor <HI>Ori∣gen</HI> such a bloody overthrow, was a day wherein <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is prayers had not been carefully enough attend∣ed. The best posture to fight the Devil in, is <HI>upon our knees.</HI> There was a woman once in this Land, very strangely <HI>possessed</HI> with divers devils who would <HI>audibly</HI> speak within her, while her self knew no∣thing of it; these Devils very <HI>audibly</HI> spoke of di∣vers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ischiess they would inflict upon her, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they made this answer to one another. <HI>Ah! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> runs to the Rock, she runs to the Rock!</HI> and they
<PB N="88" REF="000534_0092_0FA6B6B7472AC338"/>
could not here her there. Why, see to it, that by your daily prayers you <HI>Run to the Rock;</HI> a Dove in the <HI>clefts of that Rock,</HI> will be defended against all the Vultures of Hell that would seize upon it. But unto Prayer, joyn a true Faith in the <HI>Blood</HI> of Christ; look upon <HI>that</HI> as the <HI>meritorious</HI> and also as the <HI>exemplary</HI> cause of all your Successes against the Devil. A filly Papist, will sign himself with a <HI>Cross,</HI> that the devil may have no power over him. Behold, the right way of signing our selves with the <HI>Cross.</HI> Encourage our selves from the view of the Lord Jesus hanging there.</P>
<P>And let this be accompanied with a strong Faith in the <HI>Grace</HI> of Christ. Let that be the <HI>Fountain</HI> from whence we derive all our strength against the devil. A good woman troubled by a devil, said unto him, <HI>Satan, don't meddle with a poor silly woman; but if thou hast any thing to say, speak it unto my Ad∣vocate, the blessed Jesus, and see whether he cannot answer thee.</HI> O let us beg the Lord Jesus to give us a little of that <HI>Grace,</HI> by which he did himself once heat the devil here; and let us hope in Him us in that Redeemer, <HI>Who knows how to succour the Tempted.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Dedication of, The little Childs Lesson.</HEAD>
<HEAD>To the CHILDREN Dwelling in the North-part of BOSTON.</HEAD>
<P>VEry terrible and sorrowful are the <HI>Pre∣sages</HI> which many Learned, Holy, Thinking Men have had about the State which they have suspected <HI>New-England</HI> as running apace into. One of our Seers hath long since in publick writings told us, <HI>The Gospel, I fear, is going, the Lord Jesus is departing from these Coasts.</HI> Another of our Watchmen foretold it a great while ago unto us, <HI>That God would punish the wantonness of this people, with a sad loss, and want, of Able Men.</HI> And a third of our Shep∣herds, did not stick to tell us many years ago, <HI>I am verily afraid such a dismal night is towards us
<PB N="90" REF="000534_0094_0FA6B6BB71694EA8"/>
and such sore Afflictions, that the Lord will fill the hearts of all that shall be saved in those days with such Anguish of Spirit, as never more in the worst days of our Eore-fathers.</HI> These and many more such as these, have been the dark thoughts which our <HI>Fathers</HI> have had concerning our condition; and our Hearts are wonderfully hard, if we tremble not at the late and large steps of Providence towards the fulfilment of such Pre∣dictions upon us. But among all the <HI>deadly Symptoms</HI> which threaten us with a speedy Ru∣ine, there is none more ghastly, than the ig∣norance, the wildness, the lewdness found in so great a part of the <HI>Rising Generation.</HI> Multi∣tudes of our <HI>Children</HI> are very much <HI>Un-Catechised,</HI> as to the principles, and sadly <HI>Unnur∣tured</HI> and <HI>Ungoverned</HI> as to the practices of Christianity. Our Children are miserably both <HI>neglected</HI> and <HI>indulged;</HI> tho' <HI>too much</HI> be made of them, in gratifying of their <HI>unruly wills,</HI> nevertheless <HI>too little</HI> is made of them in pro∣viding for their <HI>immortal souls;</HI> and, <HI>some of you have no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Knowledge of God; I speak this to the shame</HI> of your ungodly Tutors. It was the last and worst of all the <HI>Egyptian</HI> plagues, That a <HI>Child</HI> was <HI>dead</HI> in every house. But may it not now be reckoned among the <HI>New-English</HI> Ones, that in so many Houses all the <HI>Children</HI> are <HI>dead in trespasses and sins,</HI> &amp; have their <HI>Eyes</HI> closed and muffled by a most unhappy <HI>Ignorance.</HI> 'Tis <HI>This</HI> that of all our
<PB N="91" REF="000534_0095_0FA6B6BBF9D71D18"/>
<HI>dismal Omens</HI> looks blackest upon us; and it should awaken the vigorous endeavour of every sensible <HI>Christian</HI> to prevent that woful <HI>Degene∣racy</HI> in which <HI>There will arise another Generation that know not the Lord;</HI> and by which the God of our Fathers will be so provoked at us as to say with the expence of all his Arrows upon us; <HI>What shall I do unto thee? What shall I do unto thee?</HI></P>
<P>Here was the consideration that produced the little Discourse, which I now put into the hands of <HI>Children,</HI> and especially of <HI>those</HI> Children which are the <HI>Lambs;</HI> that I have received a spe∣cial charge from the Lord Jesus Christ about the <HI>Feeding of.</HI> Our Saviour, <HI>in a certain place;</HI> hath intimated, That <HI>His little Children</HI> have the Angels of Heaven marvelously concerned about them; be sure those <HI>Mintsters</HI> forget the deno∣mination of <HI>Angels</HI> put upon us in the Oracles of God, that have not their very hearts within them working and yerning towards the <HI>Little</HI> Children that are under the watch of their Mi∣nistry. For my own part, I must be impatient until I see the <HI>little</HI> children here so well instruct∣ed, that a <HI>Papist;</HI> or which is much what one, a <HI>Quaker,</HI> shall be as unable to seduce them, as the <HI>Jesuits</HI> were to corrupt the well educated Chil∣dren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the <HI>Waldenses</HI> when they were sent a∣mong them; and until I see also the <HI>Little</HI> Chil∣dren here as forward in all Piety, as the Well∣informed Children of the Ancient Jews were in

the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> the six hundred and thir∣teen Precepts whereof they had by heart be∣fore they were thirteen years of Age.</P>
<P>My dear Children, when <HI>Pharaoh</HI> could not hinder the people of God from going to serve the <HI>Lord</HI> in the <HI>Wilderness,</HI> he still objected a∣gainst their therein having the company of, <HI>their little Ones;</HI> this is the desire, this the design which the Devil, is here with great fury managing; that so he may have his long en∣joyed <HI>America,</HI> all return into his bloody hands. But you have now before you, some of our cares to engage our <HI>Little Ones</HI> with us, in the Service of our God; O that the <HI>Little Ones</HI> among us, might become greatly solicitous, <HI>to know the God of our Fathers, and serve Him with a perfect hearts, and a willing mind.</HI> It raised surely some Agony in the mind of <HI>David,</HI> when there befell him the dis∣aster, whereof he afterwards gave that Report, <HI>Thy Servant kept his Fathers Sheep, and there came a Lion and took a Lamb out of the Flock.</HI> In like manner, when I understand that any of <HI>you</HI> are ignorant, or naughty and vicious Children, me∣thinks I see the horrid <HI>Lions</HI> of Hell, fetching some of my poor <HI>Lambs</HI> away, and how shall I answer it, if I do not <HI>go out after them!</HI> The following pages are some of my Essays to pluck you out of your Eternal Perdition; and I hope you will read them seriously, frequently, very profitably.

<HI>Addresses,</HI> notwithstanding the toyl of my public <HI>Employments,</HI> treated with many scores of you; I have seen the <HI>tears,</HI> and heard the <HI>vows,</HI> with which many of you have declared, <HI>That you would be the Servants of</HI> God <HI>as long as you live;</HI> and I shall be a witness against you, if af∣ter this you be of them <HI>who draw back.</HI> But I do now before all the world, renew my Appli∣cations to you for your <HI>early</HI> Repentance and O∣bedience. Hence as I have studied in a <HI>Sermon</HI> to touch your <HI>Affections,</HI> I have laboured also to help your <HI>Understandings,</HI> by a <HI>Scriptural Cate∣chism,</HI> annexed thereunto; and tho' I am far from not encouraging any of you to prize and learn those, excellent <HI>Catechisms</HI> which are now commonly used among us; yet I was willing to offer you <HI>one</HI> more, because it pretends to these few little Singularities.</P>
<P>First, The <HI>Answers</HI> are all of them, the <HI>express words</HI> of sacred Scripture; which have in them a force beyond the <HI>purest words</HI> of any Writing else. And now also, you are at once taught with case not only to <HI>Assert,</HI> but also to <HI>Confirm</HI> all the Do∣ctrines of the Christian Religion. Besides, the <HI>Answers</HI> are for the most part <HI>short,</HI> and not sel∣dom explained in the <HI>Questions,</HI> to which they do belong; and as for the younger of you, I have distinguished a few of them by <HI>little Stars,</HI> that you may single out <HI>them,</HI> to begin the charg∣ing of your infant-Memories therewithal.

<Q><HI>I write unto you, Little Children, because ye have known the Father.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BEhold the Aged, Beloved, Inspired Apostle <HI>John,</HI> applying himself to Christians of all Ages; wherein, as it has been observed long since, <HI>Dat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ui{que} or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> qua <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>psi con∣veniant,</HI> he speaks things marvellously conveni∣ent and agreeable to them all. The <HI>last</HI> Subjects of the Apostolical Address, are the <HI>least</HI> that can be written unto; namely, <HI>Little Children;</HI> for even among <HI>such,</HI> there may sometimes be found the true <HI>knowledge</HI> of God. Our holy <HI>John</HI> thought himself concerned in the Charge, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had over-heard the Lord giving unto <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> a little before he left the world, <HI>Feed my Lambs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>

and accordingly he does here take a most pater∣nal and pathetick notice of the <HI>Lambs,</HI> in the Flock of the Lord Jesus; indeed the Greek word in our Text, rendred <HI>Little</HI> Children, car∣ries <HI>Feeding</HI> In the Notation of it. We have before us the Attainment of devout and pious <HI>Children,</HI> in the School of the Lord Jesus Christ; it is, <HI>They have known the Father;</HI> by which <HI>Fa∣ther,</HI> is meant the God of Heaven. <HI>Little</HI> Chil∣dren scarce know any man or thing so soon as they know their <HI>Father;</HI> nor are they so fond of any man or thing as they are of their <HI>Father.</HI> Now 'tis the prerogative of some <HI>little</HI> Chil∣dren to know the great God, as their <HI>Fa∣ther;</HI> yea, to <HI>love</HI> Him, and <HI>serve</HI> Him as their <HI>Father</HI> too, which is implied in the <HI>know∣ing</HI> of Him.

our <HI>little</HI> Children. Religious <HI>Children</HI> when they are sitting perhaps upon the knee of an Earthly <HI>Father,</HI> may remember that there is a∣nother <HI>Father,</HI> whom they belong unto; namely, <HI>A Father which is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>But in what Respects may gracious <HI>little</HI> Chil∣dren call God, <HI>Their Father.</HI></P>
<P>First, Gracious <HI>little</HI> Children may look upon God as their <HI>Father,</HI> in respect of <HI>Creation;</HI> for indeed all <HI>Creatures</HI> thus have Him, for their <HI>Fa∣ther.</HI> 'Tis intimated in Job 38. 28. He is the <HI>Father of the Rain, and of the Dew.</HI> But he is es∣pecially thus a <HI>Father</HI> unto all <HI>Spirits;</HI> it is said, in Heb. 12. 9. <HI>He is the Father of Spirits;</HI> and thus the <HI>Angels,</HI> are styled, <HI>The Sons of God.</HI> Hence <HI>man</HI> also, every <HI>man</HI> may say unto God, <HI>our Father;</HI> we all owe unto God, our <HI>Production</HI> and <HI>Original;</HI> and, as the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> speaks in the words of the Greek Poet, <HI>Aratus;</HI> in Acts 17. 18. <HI>We are his Offspring.</HI> Thus, little Chil∣dren should betimes be sensible of this, <HI>I am newly come out of the hands of the great God; it is God that made me, and shap'd me, and bestow'd my life and my Being on me.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Gracious <HI>little</HI> Children may look upon God as their <HI>Father,</HI> in respect of <HI> Suscepti∣on;</HI> He <HI>undertaketh</HI> for them. God owns a <HI>Pa∣ternity</HI> unto gracious little Children, by <HI>underta∣king</HI> of their <HI>Patronage.</HI> Indeed, there is a con∣tract and a consent of them concerning it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they desire of God, that he would Undertake the Of∣fice
<PB N="98" REF="000534_0102_0FA6B6C458FE8770"/>
of a <HI>Father</HI> for them; and they say to him, as in Isa. 63. 17. <HI>Doubtless, thou art our Father.</HI> They see that their natural <HI>Fathers</HI> cannot Re∣lieve all their <HI>wants,</HI> and Remove all their <HI>woes,</HI> and prevent all their <HI>fears;</HI> and hence the glo∣rious God, upon an humble Request of theirs, becomes concerned as a <HI>Father</HI> for them. 'Tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> especially, when they have no other <HI>fathers</HI> to look after them; 'tis said of God, in Psal. 69. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>He is a father of the fatherless.</HI> When gracious little Children are left as <HI>Orphans</HI> in a wide and a wild world, they may assure them∣selves, <HI>My best father is yet alive; tho my father do for sake me, yet the Lord will take me up.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, Gracious <HI>little</HI> Children may look up∣on God as their Father, in respect of <HI>Adoption.</HI> God in his free grace, accounts them his Children, through the <HI>Sonship of</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ; &amp; thus, as 'tis said in Joh. 1. 11. <HI>They have power to be called the Sons of God.</HI> Gracious little Chil∣dren are <HI>united</HI> unto Him that is the Saviour of the World. As <HI>young</HI> as they are, the Almighty Lord of Lords, and King of Kings counts them <HI>old</HI> enough to be married unto Himself. In the Ancient, Eternal, Well-ordered <HI>Covenant of Re∣demption,</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ was made a pub∣lick person, representing of all his chosen Ones; he was thus constituted by an Eternal <HI>Agreement</HI> between God and Him; and gracious little Chil∣dren say their <HI>Amen,</HI> to that Agreement; those little <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> put themselves under the <HI>wing</HI> of
<PB N="99" REF="000534_0103_0FA6B6C509E0AFC0"/>
the Lord Jesus Christ, and cry unto him, <HI>O be our Surety for good.</HI> Now Christ and they are <HI>one;</HI> the <HI>Reck'ning</HI> of God from all Eternity, and the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God in fulness of Time, hath made them so; and thus these little Children become the Children of the great God. For the Name of God is, <HI>The Father of our Lord Jesus Christ;</HI> the Word of God is, <HI>He shall, cry unto me, Thou art my Father.</HI> It now follows, that all gracious little Children arrive unto that Advancement, in Rom.8.16.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>Children of God, and joint Heirs with Christ.</HI> Now they have a <HI>New Name</HI> upon them, and the Lord Jesus now speaks unto them in such Heart-breaking terms as those, <HI>My Father is your Father, and my God is your God.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, Gracious <HI>little</HI> Children may look up∣on God as their <HI>Father,</HI> in respect of <HI>Regeneration.</HI> 'Tis the preheminence of all Converted persons; that they are <HI>Born again by the Word of God.</HI> But who is their <HI>Father?</HI> We are told in John 1. 13. <HI>They that believe, are born of God;</HI> and there are some <HI>little Children</HI> to be found among true Be∣lievers. These are not by <HI>generation</HI> the Children of God; for thus God is a <HI>Father</HI> only to the Lord Jesus Christ. But they are by <HI>Regeneration</HI> so. The Almighty God says to the Lord Jesus Christ as <HI>Jacob</HI> to <HI>Joseph</HI> of old, <HI>Thy Sons shall be mine.</HI> But as for little Children that are brought home to God, by the <HI>Renewing of the Holy</HI> Ghost, these are the Children of the Lord Jesus Christ; they are call'd in Isa. 53. 10. The <HI>Seed</HI> of that Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

they are born of him, and <HI>born twice</HI> perhaps within one seven years.</P>

<HEAD>Proposition II.</HEAD>
<P>Gracious <HI>little</HI> Children endeavour to <HI>Know</HI> God, as thus an Heavenly <HI>Father</HI> to them.</P>
<P>But what is implied in this <HI>Knowledge?</HI></P>
<P>First, Gracious <HI>little</HI> Children would not be without the saving and sincere <HI>Knowledge</HI> of God. They <HI>know</HI> the truth of that in Joh. 17 3. <HI>This is Life Eternal, to know the only true God;</HI> they <HI>know</HI> the truth of that in Prov. 19. 2. <HI>For the Soul to be without knowledge, it is not good.</HI> And this awakens them to seek the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of God, with such <HI>cares</HI> and <HI>cries</HI> as the Wise man in the <HI>Proverbs</HI> advised his Children unto. Gracious <HI>little</HI> Children complain of themselves, as <HI>he</HI> did of old, in Prov. 30. 3. <HI>I have not the knowledge of the Holy;</HI> and so they become willing to learn; they are willing to learn what <HI>God is,</HI> what His Three <HI>Persons.</HI> and what His Infinite <HI>Perfections</HI> are; they are willing to learn what He <HI>does</HI> in the <HI>World,</HI> as Creating and Preserving of all things; and as Redeeming his Elect; they are willing to learn what He <HI>says</HI> in the <HI>Word,</HI> what Mysteries, what Histories, what Commandments, what Promises, and Threatnings He has therein set before us. They think that without some <HI>Knowledge</HI> of these things they must grind like <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mpson</HI> with his Eyes put out by Hellish <HI>Phi∣listines;</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="000534_0105_0FA6B6C8062BA6A0"/>
and they tremble at such a Doom as that, in Isa. 27. 11. It is a people of <HI>no Under∣standing; wherefore he that made them, will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no Favour.</HI> There is no need of whipping them to their <HI>Catechisms;</HI> to be learning of <HI>them,</HI> is as Pleasant and welcome an Exercise unto these Children, as any that they can be put upon.</P>
<P>Secondly, Gracious little Children would not be without an assured <HI>Knowledge,</HI> that in the fur∣thest and the sweetest sense, God is indeed a <HI>Fa∣ther</HI> to them; they would have an Assurance of their being <HI>Adopted</HI> and <HI>Regenerated</HI> by the Lord. They look upon God, as the best <HI>Father</HI> in the World; and as the son of <HI>Jesse</HI> sometimes could say, in I Sam. 18. 23. <HI>Seemeth it unto you a light thing to be a Kings Son-in-law?</HI> So 'tis not a <HI>light thing</HI> in the Opinion of these, to become the Chil∣dren of that God, who is <HI>a great King,</HI> and whose <HI>Name is Dreadful.</HI> Gracious little Children are sensible, that they have been the children of wrath, and the Children <HI>of Hell,</HI> and that while they were in their sins they have had the Devil for their <HI>father;</HI> but when they read the eighth Chap∣ter to the <HI>Romans,</HI> they count it a thing of inex∣pressible importance for them, to get into the <HI>li∣berty of the Sons of God.</HI> It affects them to see how the children of men are divided, in 1 Joh. 3. 10. Either <HI>the children of God,</HI> or the <HI>children of the Devil;</HI> and they can by no means bear to con∣tinue the children of so black a <HI>father</HI> as the De∣vil
<PB N="102" REF="000534_0106_0FA6B6C8B78D6F80"/>
is. Hence they do most heartily, readily, cheerfully close with the motions which the Son of God makes unto them; and as it is said in Gal 3. 26. <HI>Ye are all the children of God, by faith in Jesus Christ;</HI> so, these Children do by <HI>faith</HI> accept of the Lord Jesus Christ as offered unto them in the Gospel; 'tis the language of their Souls, <HI>Blessed</HI> Lord <HI>Jesus, be thou mine, and let me be Thine; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thou bestow Righteousness, and grace, and life upon me; and let me be for Thee and not for another.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, Gracious little Children study to pay unto God the <HI>Acknowledgements</HI> which are due unto a <HI>Father,</HI> yea, unto an <HI>Heavenly Father.</HI> The Carriage of Children to a <HI>father</HI> is imitated in their Deportment before the Lord. And,</P>
<P>First, They place on God, the <HI>Affection</HI> which is due unto a <HI>father.</HI> A <HI>father,</HI> is a Name all made up of <HI>love.</HI> As the <HI>fatherly love</HI> of God unto gra∣cious little Children is very marvellous; for thus 'tis said in 1 Joh 3. 1. <HI>Behold, what manner of love, the Father has bestow'd upon us, that we should be called the Sons of God!</HI> So the <HI>Filial Love</HI> of these Children unto <HI>God,</HI> is likewise, <HI>Behold, what man∣ner of love!</HI> They love none so much as <HI>God,</HI> but tho' they love their <HI>fathers</HI> more than all Creatures, yet they love their <HI>God</HI> with greater out-goings of their little Souls.</P>
<P>Secondly, They pay to <HI>God,</HI> the <HI>Reverence</HI> which is due unto a <HI>father.</HI> They dare not therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rude, saw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, impudent, in the special presence
<PB N="103" REF="000534_0107_0FA6B6C975D38698"/>
of the Lord; nor Talk, nor Sport, nor Sleep, when they should be worshipping of Him. 'Tis the voice of <HI>God</HI> in Mal. 1. 6. <HI>A son honoureth his father; if then I be a Father, where is my Honour?</HI> Gracious little Children give unto their God the <HI>Honour</HI> of a <HI>father;</HI> if they speak <HI>of</HI> God, it is in a most humble, serious, awful strain, they will not say, <HI>O God,</HI> or, <HI>O Lord,</HI> or say, <HI>God bless me,</HI> and, Lord <HI>bless me,</HI> with a frothy, carnal, heedless interjection; if they speak <HI>to</HI> God, it is with an exceeding veneration: while they are at prayer, they compose themselves unto a very di∣ligent Attention and Intention of Soul; once more, if they hear <HI>from</HI> God, they set themselves as in the sight of him, who is <HI>greatly to be feared and had in Reverence;</HI> while they are in the As∣semblies where the Word of God is Preach'd un∣to them, they would not use the least wildeness for a thousand worlds.</P>
<P>Thirdly, They yield to God the <HI>submission</HI> which is due unto a <HI>father.</HI> They will by no means dis∣pute the will of God, but render a most full, pro∣found, absolute Obedience thereunto. Our Lord Jesus could say unto God, as in Luc. 22. 42. <HI>Fa∣ther, not my will, but thine be done;</HI> and gracious little Children will herein say after that <HI>Holy Child Jesus.</HI> As for the will of God in his <HI>Pre∣cept,</HI> they are very ready to <HI>do</HI> it; they say, <HI>Lord, what wouldst thou have me to do;</HI> and they <HI>do</HI> what∣soever they understand he does <HI>bid;</HI> they would fain do, <HI>The thing that good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and what the Lord
<PB N="104" REF="000534_0108_0FA808C108B34F68"/>
has required of them.</HI> As for the will of God in his <HI>Providence,</HI> they are very ready to <HI>bear</HI> it; they say <HI>The will of the Lord be done!</HI> and they bear what strokes, what pains, what sorrows, his <HI>Rod</HI> may lash them with; so they <HI>are subject unto the father of Spirits, and live.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, They have a <HI>Dependance</HI> on God as <HI>Children</HI> on a <HI>Father.</HI> Gracious Children are <HI>pray∣ing</HI> Children, they won't easily let a day pass them without <HI>praying</HI> to God, and they go unto God as unto a <HI>father</HI> in their prayers. There was a very little Child whose prayers were so frequent and so fervent, that a Neighbour which discovered them cryed out, <HI>The prayers of that Child will sink me to the bottom of Hell.</HI> Gracious little Children will <HI>pray</HI> at such a rate as to condemn the <HI>prayer l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss</HI> lives of all the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>But how is that? briefly,</P>
<P>Gracious little Children, will use to pray with <HI>Boldness.</HI> As a Child will go <HI>boldly</HI> to his Father upon all occasions; thus will these Children be ever now and then coming to <HI>God,</HI> and as the A∣postle speaks in Heb. 4. 16. <HI>Come boldly to the Throne of Grace.</HI> When they see the infinite Ma∣jesty and Purity of <HI>God,</HI> they do with much fear approach unto Him; but when they see, that <HI>God</HI> is their <HI>father,</HI> this does again encourage them. They been't loth to go tell this <HI>father</HI> of theirs, what they all, in all of their Distresses; no, they go to <HI>God;</HI> and cry, <HI>Abba, father!</HI> and in <HI>all things make known Requests unto God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="000534_0109_0FA6B6CB678877D8"/>
Again, gracious little Children, will use to pray with <HI>Comfort.</HI> These Children are <HI>comfortably</HI> perswaded of success in their Cryes to <HI>God,</HI> as Children in theirs unto a Father; and they ar∣gue at that rate, in Mat. 7. 11. <HI>If ye, being E∣vil, know how to give good gifts unto your Chil∣dren, how much more shall your</HI> Father <HI>which is in Heaven.</HI> As L<HI>uther</HI> would say, <HI>That word,</HI> my Father, <HI>used by a praying Saint, all the Rhe∣torick and Eloquence in the world could never e∣qual it.</HI> Thus, these, when they say unto <HI>God, my father,</HI> they promise themselves that no good thing shall be deny'd unto them. Since <HI>God</HI> is their Father, they expect that their Fa∣ther will Pity them, that their Father will coun∣sel them, that their Father will supply them; and make them happy for-ever.</P>
<P>Fifthly, They have a <HI>Resemblance</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Children</HI> of a Father: gracious Children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> like their <HI>father;</HI> and are as the Apostolical ex∣pression has it, in Eph. 5. 1. <HI>followers of God as dear</HI> Children. Yea, they are not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Pictures,</HI> which may have something of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and feature in them, but they are Chil∣dren that will <HI>talk</HI> and <HI>walk</HI> just like their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ther. Thus our Lord says in Luc. 6. 35. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and do <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>like</HI> to <HI>God, and you shall be the children of the Highest.</HI> In short, what is grievous to <HI>God</HI> is grievous also to gracious little Children, that, have his Image on them. These Children are grieved at <HI>their own sins,</HI> because <HI>God</HI> is grieved at them. When <HI>Casar</HI> saw an intimate
<PB N="106" REF="000534_0110_0FA6B6CD80B6A5D0"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of his, among the Murderers, that were as∣saulting of him, he most bitterly cry'd out, <HI>What, my</HI> Child <HI>among them!</HI> Thus a Child whose heart <HI>God</HI> has touched, thinks with himself, <HI>If such an one as I sin, it will be as if a Child should go to stab his Father;</HI> and so it <HI>stabs</HI> him at the heart in∣deed, when he sees how many sins he has Offend∣ed the great <HI>God</HI> withal. These Children are al∣so grieved at the <HI>sins of others,</HI> because God is grieved at them. It is related of <HI>Croesus,</HI> that he had a <HI>dumb Son;</HI> which Son seeing a Souldier about killing of his Father, he was in such an A∣gony, that tho' he never spoke before, yet now he spoke, and shriek'd, <HI>O don't you kill my father!</HI> Thus, if a Child belonging to God, see any body profane and wicked, it is as if he saw one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at his Father; he is in a just passion at it, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>O don't serve my Eternal father so!</HI> If any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of his play-mates, or school-mates, go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do any naughty thing, he will zealously <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them for it. In a word, These gracious Children, are loth to do any thing that may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> displeasing to such a Father as the blessed God. If such a Child be tempted unto <HI>Sab∣bath-breaking</HI> he thinks, <HI>What shall I dishonour my father so as to take the Devil for my play∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>!</HI> If he be tempted unto Cursing, Swear∣ing, Lying, or the calling of wicked Names, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>No, my Heavenly Father does cast Chil∣dren into those flames where they shall not have a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of water to cool their Tongues, for such crimes
<PB N="107" REF="000534_0111_0FA6B6CEE8ED3410"/>
as these!</HI> He abhors all that is contrary to the thrice-Holy-God.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>Proposition III.</HEAD>
<P>It is the <HI>peculiar priviledge</HI> of gracious little Children thus to know the Almighty God.</P>
<P>These three things are to be affirmed.</P>
<P>First, There are <HI>some</HI> little Children, that <HI>have</HI> and <HI>own,</HI> God, for their <HI>Father.</HI> Such a Child might S<HI>amuel</HI> be; of whom we find in I Sam. 3. 1. that while he was a Child, <HI>he Ministred unto the Lord;</HI> he kept <HI>waiting</HI> on God, and <HI>serving</HI> of God, in his House continually; and had a most intimate Communion with him there. Such a Child might also <HI>David</HI> be; who was able to say in Psal. 22. 9. <HI>Thou didst make me Hope when I was upon my Mothers Breasts; thou art my God from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mothers Belly;</HI> he speaks, as if before he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>weaned,</HI> there had been some <HI>hope</HI> and some <HI>fau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> on <HI>God,</HI> beginning to dawn in his little Soul. And such a Child seems <HI>Timothy</HI> to have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unto whom 'twas said in 2 Tim. 3. 15. <HI>From <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Child thou hast known the Scriptures;</HI> he was in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very Infancy acquainted with the mind of the great God. The Father of <HI>Origen</HI> took him to be such a Child, when he would kiss the breast of the lovely youth while he lay asleep, as a young <HI>Temple</HI> to the Eternal Spirit of God. Some <HI>little</HI> Children have been so devoted unto God, as to prove the most Eminent <HI>Witnesses</HI> and <HI>Confessors
<PB N="108" REF="000534_0112_0FA6B6CF8D67A400"/>
for him; the bloody Papists butchered four hun∣dred such precious Infants at once among the <HI>Waldenses</HI> long ago. When the Noble <HI>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>anus</HI> was Martyr'd, in one of the Primitive Perscuti∣ons, a <HI>little</HI> Child but seven years old, bravely suffered with him, for asserting the Christian Re∣ligion, <HI>which</HI> (said the child, unto his furious Persecutors) <HI>I learnt of my christian Mother, with whose Milk I suck'd it in.</HI> Yea, many children then accompanied their courageous Parents, in re∣ceiving the Crown of <HI>Martyrdom.</HI> And certain∣ly, those were very well disposed <HI>little</HI> children, who in the horrible <HI>Marian Dayes,</HI> came about the Martyr <HI>Lawrence;</HI> as he was dying in the flames, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry'd out, <HI>Lord, strengthen thy servant &amp; keep thy pro∣mise!</HI> Lord, strengthen thy servant, and keep thy Promise.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, some worthy men, have made Col∣lections, of Histories, concerning <HI>little</HI> children, that have given wonderful Instances of an <HI>Early Piety</HI> before they left the world. The Excellent <HI>Janeway,</HI> has done excellently well this way, in his <HI>Tokens for Children,</HI> which little Books, I most af∣fectionately Recommend unto the perusal of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you all. He tells of one child admirably wrought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon by the grace of God, when between two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and three years old. He writes of a Boy remar∣kable for Devotions, which dy'd at the age of twelve years, and being, in his lingring sickness, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old of a fair Estate which he might live to enjoy, bravely answered, <HI>I had rather have the Kingdom

of Heaven, than a thousand such Inheritances! I desire to dy, that I may go to that.</HI>He writes of ano∣ther, which having walked with God from the fourth to the twelfth year of his Age, then dy'd, professing, <HI>This is a most wicked world, it is indeed good to live with my Parents, but it is better to love in Heaven.</HI> He writes of a Girl also remarkable for Devotions, which being converted unto God, when eight or nine years old, not long after dy'd in the midst of incredible. <HI>Raptures,</HI> wherein she cry'd out, <HI>Oh! If you knew what Christ were! Oh! If you had but one tast of his infinite sweetness, you would a thousand times rather go to Him, than stay in this wicked world<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I would not for ten thousand and ten thousand worlds part with my Interest in him; or go back from the everlasting Joys which I am now near unto.</HI> He writes of another brought home to God, when between four or five years old; which would sometimes be thinking, <HI>O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> they <HI>doing, that are already in Heaven!</HI> and being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> last smitten with the marks of the <HI>Plague</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out upon her, she cryed out, <HI>Behold, God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> marked me, for one of his own; the Lord has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> told me, that I am one of his dear Children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> several other such Examples, have been Record∣ed; not only by that man of God, but also by Mr. <HI>White,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ness,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bidbank,</HI> and sundry o∣ther such holy Men.</P>
<P>Yea, and the place where our selves do live, hath not been without such <HI>Examples;</HI> and those; of both Sexes. Unto such as have been already
<PB N="110" REF="000534_0114_0FA6B6D2561CB4A0"/>
Published, it were easy to add many more.</P>
<P>To <HI>Male-children,</HI> I might particularly mention one who at the age of <HI>twelve</HI> years, among other expressions of an unusual <HI>seriousness</HI> and <HI>gravity,</HI> wrote from his Lodging at <HI>Cambridge</HI> to his Fa∣ther in <HI>Dorchester,</HI>—These very syllables. </P>
<LETTER>
<P>'Tho I am thus well in my <HI>Body,</HI> yet I question whe∣ther my <HI>Soul do prosper as my Body doth;</HI> for I perceive yet to this very day, little <HI>growth</HI> in grace; and this makes me question, whether <HI>grace</HI> be in mine heart, or no. I feel also daily great <HI>unwillingness</HI> to good Duties, and the great ruling of <HI>Sin</HI> in my heart; and that God is angry with me, and gives me no <HI>Answer to my prayers,</HI> but many times he even throws them down as dust in my face; and he does not grant my c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntinual Requests, for the <HI>spiritual blessing of the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning of my hard heart.</HI> And in all this, I could yet take some Comfort; but that it makes me to wonder, what God's <HI>secret Decree</HI> concerning me, may be. For I doubt whether God is ever wont to deny grace and mercy to his <HI>chosen,</HI> (tho' uncalled) when they feek un∣to him by prayer for it; and therefore seeing he does thus deny it to me, I think that the reason of it is most like to be, because I belong not to the Election of Grace. I desire you, that you would let me have your prayers, as I doubt not but I have them; and rest.</P>

This was he, whom twenty years afterwards, all <HI>Ireland</HI> had a Blessing in; contradicting that Needless Proverb, <HI>soon ripe, soon rotten.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>Female Children,</HI> I might mention, <HI>Ann Greenough,</HI> the Daughter of Mr. <HI>William Greenough</HI> Deceased; who left the world, when she was but about five years old, and yet gave astonishing Discoveries of a Regard unto God and Christ &amp; her own Soul, before she went away: When she heard any thing about the Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> she would be strangely transported and ravished in her Spirit at it; and had an unspeakable Delight in <HI>Catechising.</HI> She would put strange <HI>Questions</HI> about eternal things, and make <HI>Answers</HI> her self that were extreamly pertinent. Once particular∣larly she asked, <HI>Are not we dead in Sin?</HI> and pre∣sently added, <HI>But I will take this way, the Lord Je∣sus Christ shall make me alive.</HI> She was very fre∣quent and constant in <HI>secret prayer,</HI> and could not with any patience be interrupted in it. She told her gracious Mother, <HI>That she there prayed for her!</HI> and was covetous of being with her Mother, when she imagined such Duties to be going for∣ward. When she fell sick at last of a Consump∣tion, she would not by any sports be diverted from the Thoughts of <HI>Death,</HI> wherein she took such pleasure that she did not care to hear of any thing else. And if she were asked, <HI>whether she were willing to dy?</HI> she would still cheerfully Reply, <HI>Ay, by all means, that I may go to the Lord</HI> Jesus Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="000534_0116_0FA6B6D353B73DC0"/>
Indeed-sundry <HI>such</HI> little Children, have there been among us; but now, as he that heard a sto∣ry of <HI>two</HI> faithful Friends, presently said, <HI>I would I were a third with them!</HI> So, I hope every one of the <HI>little</HI> Children that have seen these Examples, will say, <HI>O that I may be a third! O that I might be like one of these happy Children!</HI> But,</P>
<P>Secondly, There are <HI>few</HI> little Children, that have and own God for their Father. Indeed, those few little Children, that are descended of Believing Pareuts, have the same <HI>God</HI> that their Parents have chosen both for themselves &amp; theirs, until they are <HI>old</HI> enough to <HI>revoke</HI> or to <HI>renew</HI> the choice; the Children are included in what their Parents <HI>do,</HI> and <HI>have,</HI> until they can stand upon their own Legs; and at what age that is, our God has not, that I remember, expresly spoken; which ought therefore to hasten the cares of little Children, about their own Salvation. Hence we read concerning the children of Believers in I. Cor. 7. 14. <HI>They are holy;</HI> God accepts them, &amp; regards them, as consecrated unto himself. But of those little Children that are come to a Capa∣city of acting <HI>deliberately</HI> and <HI>rationally</HI> about E∣ternal Matters, how few are there that carefully say, <HI>Let God be a father to me!</HI> We may with a special Reference to <HI>little</HI> Children speak in such terms as those, in Psal. 14. 2,3. <HI>The Lord looked down from Heaven upon the children of men, to see of there were any that did understand and seek God; they are all gone aside, they are all-together become
<PB N="113" REF="000534_0117_0FA6B6D402BFBC40"/>
filthy; there is none that doth good, no, not one.</HI> E∣ven so, 'tis a rare thing, an hard thing, among <HI>little</HI> Children, to find so much as <HI>one</HI> that has an awful <HI>Respect unto all the Commandments of God.</HI> About the generality of little Children, it may be complained as in Jer. 4. 22. <HI>they are sottish Children, and they have no understanding, they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> or it may be complained as in Isa. 1. 4. <HI>A seed of evil Doers, children that are corrupters, they have forsaken the Lord.</HI> I confess, there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and then a Child which has the <HI>Seeds</HI> of grace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>odged in its Infant Soul, and less or more sprouting forth▪ according to various Temptations; but, how few do ever throughly turn to God until their <HI>Childhood</HI> be all expired!</P>
<P>Thirdly, Very glorious is the <HI>priviledge</HI> of those <HI>Little Children,</HI> that have and own God, for their Father. 'Tis a glorious <HI>priviledge</HI> to be Interested in the <HI>fatherly</HI> Regards of the great God; but so these gracious little Chil∣dren are.</P>
<P>'Tis their priviledge, that God has the <HI>Love</HI> of a Father for them. As 'twas said of a du∣tiful and a towardly Child, in Gen. 44. 20. <HI>His father loved him;</HI> unspeakably and infinite∣ly more loving is the <HI>love</HI> of God unto all gracious little Children. A father loves his <HI>Children</HI> more than all his <HI>Riches</HI> in the world<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and so does God love these Children more than the whole world besides; unto such a
<PB N="114" REF="000534_0118_0FA6B6D4B5D8C658"/>
Child, the great God says with a peculiar Em∣phasis as in Isa. 43. 4. <HI>I have loved thee!</HI></P>
<P>'Tis their priviledge, that God has likewise the <HI>pity</HI> of a <HI>Father</HI> for them. When a Child is in <HI>sickness,</HI> or <HI>distress,</HI> the heart of a father even yearns towards it. But the heart of God moves with a more compassionate pity towards gracious little Children in all their Troubles; thus 'tis said in Psal. 103. 12. <HI>As a Father pities his Chil∣dren, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Lord pities them that fear him.</HI> He feels <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sorrows with a most <HI>parental Sympathy;</HI> and if at any time he Chastise them with necessa∣ry Afflictions, he says upon it, <HI>My Bowels are troubled for them, I will surely have mercy upon them.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis moreover their priviledge that God has the <HI>pardon</HI> of a <HI>Father</HI> for them. A Father will bear with many <HI>Infirmities</HI> in his Children; but God passes by more far away in gracious little Chil∣dren. Tho' they desire to do and be better, yet they are attended with many daily <HI>childish weak∣nesses;</HI> but then our God says, in Mal. 3. 17. <HI>I will spare them as a man spareth his own Son, that serveth him.</HI> Yea, if thro' Temptation they fall into <HI>grosser Scandals,</HI> nevertheless when they come to loath and judge themselves for their mis∣carriages, the Lord will be as ready to forgive them, as <HI>David</HI> was to forgive his Rebellious, but Relenting <HI>Absalom.</HI></P>
<P>Once more, 'tis their priviledge, that God makes the <HI>provision</HI> of a <HI>Father</HI> for them. Chil∣dren
<PB N="115" REF="000534_0119_0FA6B6D858815C78"/>
shall not <HI>want,</HI> so long as they have a Li∣ving and a Tender <HI>Father,</HI> able to look after them. But God will provide for gracious <HI>little</HI> Children, after a manner which <HI>Eye has not seen, Ear has not heard, and heart has not conceived.</HI> We are told in Psal. 34. 10. <HI>They that fear the Lord, shall not want any good thing.</HI> These belong to the Family of the Almighty God; and, <HI>Their Heavenly Father knows what things they have need of.</HI> He will furnish them with all suitable mer∣cies both Temporal and Eternal.</P>
<P>Finally, 'Tis their priviledge, that when they ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e any allowable <HI>prayers,</HI> God like a <HI>Father</HI> will hear them all. If Children go to a <HI>Father</HI> for any convenient thing, 'tis but, <HI>Ask and Have;</HI> much more is the blessed Access and Success which gracious little Children have in their Supplications to the Lord. Of their prayer, we may say as in Prov. 15. 8. 'Tis his <HI>Delight.</HI> God propounds to them, <HI>Children, what do you want? What would you have? Children, when shall I do for you?</HI> And he <HI>delights</HI> to see them, spreading their Ails before him. Tho' their prayers are but like the <HI>Chat∣terings</HI> and <HI>Lispings,</HI> of Children, yet the Lord says concerning them, <HI>Let me hear thy voice, for it is sweet;</HI> their prayers make a most Heavenly Me∣lody in the Ears of the Eternal God.</P>
<P>Behold, ye pious little Children, what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you are priviledged with! And yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for your <HI>Everlasting Comfort,</HI> that it is an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Father,</HI> who will do for you such things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.
<PB N="116" REF="000534_0120_0FA6B6D965B80D38"/>
The best <HI>Father</HI> else may leave you <HI>Fatherless,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en you will sit wishing in your solitary hours, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>that it were with me, as in months past, when my Father was alive!</HI> But you are now priviledged with a <HI>Father</HI> worth infinitely more than ten thousand of any that can be taken from you. It was the encouragement of the Psalmist, in Psal. 27. 10. <HI>When my Father, and Mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up.</HI> 'Tis an allusion to the Journeys of <HI>Israel</HI> thro' the Wilderness; when the three first Squadrons were passed on before, the fourth and last Squadron were to gather up the sick, and the weak, and the same, that had been left behind. Thus, tho' thy Father be mar∣ched away, and has left thee a shiftless little crea∣ture here, yet the Lord, he is thy <HI>Father</HI> still, and he will <HI>take thee up.</HI></P>
<P>But for the brief Improvement of these things.</P>

<P N="1">1. Let all <HI> Parents </HI> endeavour that their <HI>Chil∣dren</HI> may be those gracious Ones which may <HI>know</HI> God for their <HI>Father.</HI> Methinks, you that are the <HI>Fathers</HI> of these poor little Creatures, if you had any <HI>bowels</HI> in you, should be concerned that they may have an <HI>Heavenly Father,</HI> to do that which you <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sire,</HI> but, cannot <HI>perform</HI> for them. Let me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Name of God, lay before you two or three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>estions to be thought upon.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have you no <HI>Kindness</HI> for your poor chil∣dren
<PB N="117" REF="000534_0121_0FA6B6DA0B2FE440"/>
'Tis by <HI>your</HI> means, that they are now born defiled, depraved, horribly polluted, with <HI>Original Sin,</HI> and fearfully perishing under the wrath and curse of God; and what amends will you make 'em, for this infinite wrong? It was the law for a man that had wounded another, in Exod. 21. 19. <HI>He shall cause him to be throughly healed.</HI> And will you do nothing towards <HI>healing</HI> those prodigious wounds, which your Falls have caused your Children to lie bleeding under? Your poor Children, can you endure to see them star∣ving, burning, dying before your Eyes? but thus they are till by Conversion they are become <HI>gra∣cious little Children.</HI> We read in Lam. 4. 3. <HI>Even the Sea-monsters draw out the Breasts, they give suck to their young ones.</HI> If you will do nothing for the Souls of your poor Children, you are worse than the cruellest <HI>Sea-monsters</HI> in the world.</P>
<P>Secondly, Have you no Regard for Gods <HI>Com∣mand</HI> and <HI>Glory?</HI> Why, the Immortal God, who <HI>made</HI> your <HI>children</HI> has committed them into your Hands, and said, as the Princess of <HI>Egypt</HI> unto the Mother of <HI>Moses, Here, take this Child, Nurse it for me, and I'le give thee thy wages.</HI> 'Tis the charge which God has given you, about your Children, in Eph. 6. 4. <HI>Bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</HI> And this is the way to propagate and continue the <HI>Service</HI> of God, unto after-generations; you that make it not your study, to see your Offspring become <HI>gracious little Children,</HI> are willing that God
<PB N="118" REF="000534_0122_0FA6B6DAB6D9B7B0"/>
could never have any honour in the world, after this Generation shall be expired.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Have you no Regard for your own <HI>Credit</HI> and <HI>Comfort?</HI> It is said in Prov. 23. 24. <HI>The father of the Righteous shall greatly Rejoyce:</HI> Truly, if you had <HI>gracious little Children,</HI> you might, you would <HI>Rejoyce</HI> exceedingly. Which of you had not rather have a <HI>Joseph</HI> than an <HI>E∣sau,</HI> for his Age to lean upon? And when you leave your <HI>Children,</HI> or your Children leave <HI>you,</HI> how much would you give to have just <HI>Hopes,</HI> of having their Company in the sweet <HI>Joyes,</HI> of the Third Heaven for-ever? Besides, it will be a blessed mark upon your Souls, it will be a sign that you are among the Children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> if you <HI>Command your Children to keep the way of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Would you be informed then, what you may do for your poor Children? Do you ask, as <HI>Manoah</HI> of old, <HI>How shall we order the child, and what shall we do unto him?</HI> There are four things by which you may save the Souls of your little Children; yea, there are five things to be obser∣ved, that God may be a <HI>Father</HI> to them.</P>
<P>The first thing necessary for your poor Chil∣dren, is, your <HI>Authority.</HI> 'Twas said in Lev. 19. 3. <HI>Ye shall fear every man, his Mother and his Fa∣ther;</HI> the <HI>Mother</HI> is first mentioned, because that she commonly first loses her <HI>Authority.</HI> Look to it, that you keep up a <HI>Fear</HI> of you, in the hearts of your Children, and make them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to
<PB N="119" REF="000534_0123_0FA6B6DB79ABDEC8"/>
<HI>Refuse</HI> any fit thing that you shall <HI>Enjoyn</HI> upon them.</P>
<P>Another thing necessary, is, your <HI>Instruction.</HI> 'Twas the Report of the <HI>Wise-man,</HI> in Prov. 4. 3, 4. <HI>I was my Fathers Son, he taught me also;</HI> and without this he had never prov'd so <HI>wise</HI> a <HI>man.</HI> Let your Children be most frequently, se∣riously, exactly <HI>Catechised;</HI> and let your Admo∣nitions teach them, how they should <HI>think,</HI> how <HI>pray,</HI> and how <HI>live,</HI> before the Lord.</P>
<P>A Third thing necessary, is, your <HI>Inspection.</HI> As our Lord asked His Houshold, in Joh. 16. 31. <HI>Do ye now Believe?</HI> So, do you ask your Children, what their <HI>Experience,</HI> and what their <HI>Behaviour</HI> is; penetrate as far into their Circumstances, as that you may assist them against their Difficulties.</P>
<P>A Fourth necessary thing, is your <HI>Example.</HI> Re∣solve like him, in Psal. 101. 2. <HI>I will walk within my House with a perfect heart.</HI> It is no rare thing to find it of the Son, <HI>He did according to all, that his Father did.</HI> Let your Children see by your Piety and Charity and Zeal, how they may please God; and never expose, like disguised <HI>Noah,</HI> your <HI>Nakedness,</HI> unto them. And unto all these things add your <HI>Prayer;</HI> your fervent and constant <HI>prayer,</HI> to God. Pray <HI>with</HI> your Children; and let not your Houses be liable to that hideous Thunder-clap, in Jer. 10. 25. <HI>Pour out thy Eury on the Families that call not on thy Name.</HI> A dole∣ful Meeting must you have with your Children in another world, If you there have them article
<PB N="120" REF="000534_0124_0FA6B6DC35EC7D38"/>
at this rate against you, <HI>Lord, if this Bloody Fa∣ther of mine had learnt me to acknowledge thee, I had never come to this place of Torment.</HI> But pray for your Children too; and be like those who, in Mat. 19. 13. <HI>brought little children unto Jesus</HI> O carry them to God in Christ, with your im∣portunate Cries, <HI>That</HI> He would heal their spi∣ritual Diseases; <HI>That</HI> He would cast every evil Spirit out of them; and <HI>that</HI> according to His promise, He would <HI>circumcise their Hearts to fear His Name for ever.</HI></P>
<P><HI>H.</HI> But then, <HI>My little children, of whom I tra∣vel in Birth again, until</HI> Christ <HI>be formed in you;</HI> I pray, let it be your endeavour to be those gra∣cious Ones, which God may be an Heavenly <HI>Fa∣ther</HI> unto. 'Tis impossible to express, how wil∣ling, how ready, the Lord is to be the <HI>Father</HI> of you all. He has already been a <HI>Father</HI> to ma∣ny thousands of such as <HI>you;</HI> and there are doubtless more <HI>little</HI> Children in Heaven, even in the <HI>Fathers House,</HI> than there are persons of any other Age. How much may <HI>this</HI> encourage you; but in the mean time, consider, my dear Children, consider what your condition is. <HI>A Little</HI> Child once became a very <HI>holy</HI> Child, and being asked the reason of it, he said, <HI>Why, I was t'other day in the burying-place, and there I saw a Grave shorter than any self.</HI> Truly, if you'll repair to the <HI>Graves</HI> among us, you'll see many an one of your own Dimensions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="121" REF="000534_0125_0FA6B6DE773D5B80"/>
<HI>young</HI> as you are, you are <HI>old</HI> enough to Dy; the <HI>Lambs-skin</HI> is in the Market as well as the <HI>Sheep's.</HI> But O consider what will then become of your never-dying Souls, if you have not be∣fore then made sure of an Interest in God as a <HI>Father</HI> for you. What a terrible thing will it be for you to be then clap'd up in <HI>chains of Darkness</HI> among black Devils against the <HI>Judgment of the Great Day!</HI> When the <HI>Last Judgment</HI> comes upon the world, who shall then appear before the dreadful Tribunal of the Lord Jesus Christ? It is said in Rev. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. 12. <HI>I saw the Dead, small and great stand be∣fore God;</HI> the <HI>smallest</HI> of you all must then have a Sentence of <HI>Weal</HI> or <HI>Wo</HI> passed upon you; a Sentence that will fix you in your state, for infinitely more than as many milli∣ons of Ages as the Ocean has drops of wa∣ter in it.</P>
<P>But, I again say, consider what will become of you, if God be not as a <HI>Father</HI> concerned for you. You cannot then escape the <HI>Venge∣ance of eternal Fire,</HI> which Fire hath millions of small <HI>Chips,</HI> as well as of great <HI>Logs,</HI> hor∣ribly burning in it.</P>
<P>My Children, consider what has been set be∣fore you, and immediately turn it all into most <HI>importunate Supplications.</HI> We read, That when <HI>little</HI> Children were carried unto the Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>He Blessed them;</HI> how much
<PB N="122" REF="000534_0126_0FA6B6E29D5EF778"/>
more will He <HI>bless</HI> those <HI>little</HI> Children that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>themselves</HI> go unto Him! Go then unto the Lord; go daily, go seriously, go heartily unto him, and beg of him, <HI>Lord, be thou a Father to me, and help me to be as one of thy Children for-ever.</HI></P>
<P>You may remember that when <HI>little children mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked the Prophet,</HI> there came two <HI>Bears</HI> which devoured some scores of them. To slight the <HI>Counsels,</HI> is in a manner to mock the <HI>Prophets</HI> of the Lord Jesus; and you will become a prey to <HI>Devils</HI> that are worse than <HI>Bears,</HI> if you are guilty of that Impiety. 'Tis my wish for <HI>you,</HI> that you may so hearken to the Messages of Hea∣ven, us to be the <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Care</HI> of Holy Angels all your Dayes. <HI>Come, ye Children, hearken to me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I have Taught you the Fear of the Lord.</HI></P>
