<HEAD>A brief Answer to two Papers procured from Friends in <HI>Maryland,</HI> the one con∣cerning <HI>Thomas Budds</HI> favouring <HI>John Lynam, &amp;c.</HI> the other concerning his owning <HI>George Keith's</HI> Principles and Doctrines.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas there is two Papers procured from Friends in <HI>Maryland,</HI> on purpose to defame me, I think fit to give a true relation of the whole matter, and leave it to the Consideration of all Impartial Friends of Truth: <HI>T</HI>he matter then is this, as followeth. <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>About twelve Years ago <HI>John <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ary</HI> and his Wife came to <HI>Burlington,</HI> and shew a Letter from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> directed to him and three other Friends, in which they were advised by G. F. to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Friends in <HI>West-Jarsey,</HI> and Friends not knowing of the difference betwixt them and Friends in <HI>Maryland,</HI> they were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dly received, and her <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y owned. When they went back <HI>Robert Stacy</HI> and my self took the opportunity of going in th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Boat to the Meeting at <HI>West River,</HI> where some of <HI>Rob. Stacy's</HI> old Acquaintance came to visit us, and much frequented our Company, <ABBR><HI>viz</HI></ABBR> <HI>John Lynam</HI> and his Wife, <HI>Edw S<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rson,</HI> and others, all of them being strangers to me. Now I found Friends to carry it very straitly to us, but not one of them did in the least inform me the reason of their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> carriage all the time of the Meeting, or that <HI>John Lynam</HI> and his Wife, <HI>&amp;</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. were out of unity with Friends, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rved that they were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o speak in their Mee∣ting and what information I had of the matter it was from
<PB N="2" REF="000589_0002_0FA95B049C96AE08"/>
some of the above-said Persons that much frequented our com∣pany, and who no doubt would make the best of their own Cause, which I had not favoured, had Friends discharged their duty to me, by giving me an account of their being out of Unity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for when I came to have a right information concerning them, I writ to Friends my sence thereof, and did also write a Letter to <HI>John Lynam, &amp;c.</HI> advi-sing them to be reconciled to their Brethren; and the next time that I was at the Meeting at <HI>West-River,</HI> which was about two years ago, where I publickly declared against that Conten∣tious Spirit in <HI>J. L.</HI> and his Wife, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> declaring it (as they say in their Paper) to be a killing Spirit, which I still own, believing that <HI>J. L.</HI> and the rest, (having so many years con∣tinued in that contentious Spirit) had lost their condition, and were thereby become very unfit to preach so <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ntly as they now do. But it is very strange that Copi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uld be given out of the Meeting-Book, to let People kno<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the hurt they say I received by a few days accompanying with the said Persons, when at the same time they own their Ministry, and <HI>John Lynam</HI> is one of the 28 Judges against <HI>G. K.</HI> and his Friends, altho' a stranger to the Differences. But the reason of the reviving of these old matters is to insinuate into People that I having once been mistaken, so as to favour such bad Spirits as <HI>John Lynam</HI> and the rest, I might also be mistaken in my Friend <HI>G. Keith.</HI> To which I say, That it was not suddainly that I joyned with G. K. but after diligent search and enquiry into the matter, and earnest Supplication to the Lord, that he would guide me aright, I was drawn forth to joyn with <HI>G. K.</HI> in his Christian Testimony, and witness Peace and Satisfaction from the Lord therein. And not withstanding the 28 Judges say, that <HI>G. K. is fallen from the High Places of</HI> Israel, <HI>as a man slain in his High Places, and become Treacherous to the Spouse of his Youth, &amp; as a man without the fear of God before his Eyes; G. K.</HI> is a living man, and it
<PB N="3" REF="000589_0003_0FA95B0515EC7128"/>
is the Glory of God, Prosperity of Truth, and Salvation of Souls that he travails for; and these things are Slanders and Lyes writ on purpose, by prejudiced men against him, to slay him in his Reputation, and lessen Peoples Love to him and his Powerful Gospel Ministry, and to hide their own Ig∣norance, Error &amp; Unbelief in those Fundamental Principles of Christian Doctrine, which are the Foundation Cause of the present Difference and Seperation.</P>
<P>The other Paper, which they also recommend to Friends, (signed by <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nry Hosier, John True</HI> and <HI>Charles Hollisworth</HI>) saith, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>Understanding that</HI> Thomas Budd <HI>is one with</HI> George Keith, <HI>owning his Principles, which for some Years past he by his own mouth declared &amp; cautioned several to beware of saying, there were dangerous Doctrines that would break forth among us before long by</HI> George Keith.</P>
<P><HI>Answer;</HI> I do freely acknowledge that I am one with G. K. in his present Christian Testimony, and own his sound Chri∣stian Principles; but that he doth hold any dangerous Do∣ctrines, or that dangerous Doctrines are broken forth amongst us who are joyned with <HI>G. K.</HI> remains for them to tell where∣in; if they had known of any dangerous Doctrines among us, it had been more Christian in them to have writ to us and told wherein we were in an Error, than to have sent Papers privately abroad, insinuating as if there were dangerous Do∣ctrines broken forth among us; by which it appears, they are either ignorant of the Doctrines &amp; Principles we own, or unbelievers therein, and for their better Information, I recom∣mend to their perusal the Sheet called, <HI>An Account of the Sin∣cere Christian Faith of some of the faithful People called</HI> Qua∣kers <HI>in</HI> Pennsilvania, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> wherein I hope will be found no dangerous Doctrines. But that dangerous Doctrines are held by them that we meet apart from, will easily appear by a few things mentioned, that are well known to be true, <ABBR><HI>viz</HI></ABBR> <HI>Tho Fitzwater</HI> said to me, in the presence of divers Witness, <HI>That
<PB N="4" REF="000589_0004_0FA95B06920FA070"/>
he did not own any Man Christ Jesus as Mediator in H<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en with∣out him, but the</HI> G<HI>race of God within him;</HI> and tho' I complain∣ed against him to Friends of the Ministry at their Meeting at <HI>Burlington,</HI> yet they dealt not with him, nor so much as blamed him, which manifests they are one with him in his Un∣belief. And the Act of their Monthly Meeting may witness what dangerous Doctrines they hold, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That the Light is sufficient to Salvation without any thing else, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> without the <HI>Man Christ Jesus,</HI> and without the Faith of his <HI>Death, Resurrection, Assention</HI> and <HI>Mediation,</HI> which is that something else we hold to be necessary to make a man a true Christian, as well as to believe in the Light within.</P>
<P>And whereas they say, <HI>That I said after a mysterious manner, That a star would fall, cautioning all to beware of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that were coming.</HI> In answer, I say, that several Stars are fallen, and many apostatized from the Faith, witness <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> who said, <HI>That to preach Faith in Christ within, and in Christ without was to preach two Christs;</HI> and <HI>Arthur Cook</HI> put G. K. to prove by Scripture, <HI>that we were to believe in Christ within and in Christ without.</HI> And in opposition to <HI>G. K.</HI> affirming the necessity of the Faith of Christ without, as well as in <HI>Christ</HI> within. <HI>Tho Lloyd</HI> said, <HI>That Christ within did all</HI> and argued so<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e hours, <HI>That we might be Christians good enough without all Faith of Christ as he dyed for our sins, rose again &amp; R<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>oing</HI> said, <HI>That he never read in all the Scriptures of Christ without, if that Christ was separated from his Body in the Clo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI> &amp;c. Also, witness some here called <HI> Quakers</HI> at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> men to fight, and signing Commission so to do, and turn <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Indians</HI> with Powder &amp; Lead to go to war with other <HI>Indians,</HI> and some called Ministers among them being worldly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and have sentenced to Death, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by fining and Imprisoning of some of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the ancient Principles of Truth and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> apostatized from.</P>
