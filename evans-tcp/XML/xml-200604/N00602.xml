<HEAD>A PROCLAMATION</HEAD>
<P>WHereas I have found the Detaching of the Inhabitants of this Province, for Defence of the Fronteers, hath been a grievous <HI>B</HI>urthen, and have used my outmost Endeavours to provide for the Security of the Fronteers, and the Ease of the Inhabitants, which is not so far (at present) effected, but that it requires a Sum of Money to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>me, as well to retain those that are willing to serve, as to keep those I have already <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with the Assembly, making unusual Condescentions.</P>
<P>And whereas the Assembly have continued sitting Twenty Three Days, which has been a great Charge to the Country, and have made no suitable Return to answer the End I have <HI>P</HI>roposed, I do therefore think fit, by and with the Advice of the Council, to Dissolve the present Assembly of this Province, and they are hereby Dissolved accordingly.</P>
<P><HI>Given at</HI> Fort William Henry <HI>the Two and Twentieth Day of</HI> April, 1695. <HI>Anno{que} Regni Regis &amp; Regina,</HI> Gulielmi <HI>&amp;</HI> Mariae, Angliae, <HI>&amp;c. Sept. mo.</HI></P>
