<HEAD>STATE OF SOUTH-CAROLINA. IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, December 6th, 1793. The Committee to whom was referred the business of examining into, and ascertaining the truth of a report that an armed force is now levying within this state, by persons under a foreign authority, without the permission, and contrary to the express prohibition of the government of the United States, and of this state, REPORT,</HEAD>
<P>THAT they have made diligent enquiry respecting the truth of this re∣port, and have collected such evidence relating thereto as was immediately within their reach—that your committee are perfectly satisfied, from the infor∣mation, on the oaths of divers credible persons, which they have received, that William Tate, Jacob R. Brown, William Urby, Robert Tate, Richard Speke, citizens of this state, and other persons unknown to your committee, also citi∣zens of this state, have received and accepted military commissions from M. Genet, minister plenipotentiary from the republic of France to the United States of America, authorising them, and instructions requiring them, to raise, or∣ganize, train, and conduct troops, within the United States of America—That the avowed purpose for which these troops are now raising, is, to rendezvous in the state of Georgia, and from thence to proceed into the Spanish dominions, with a view to conquest or plunder, as their strength might enable, or opportu∣nity might tempt them—That in the event of a French fleet approaching the coasts of the southern states, a junction and co operation with it is contemplated by the persons abovementioned; but that though this was the avowed object of these troops and their leaders, among themselves; from the injunction to conceal the whole system from persons not initiated, and the subordination established to Mr. Genet, the author of the plan, and the source of authority to the officers. It is probable that the corps, when raised, must yield to any change of destina∣tion which the judgment or inclination of Mr. Genet may point out to them— That several of the persons above named, received, together with their com∣missions, instructions by which they were to regulate their enrollments of men, stating the pay, rations, cloathing, plunder, and division of conquered land, to be allotted to the officers and men who should enter into this service, and mark∣ing the proportions of the acquisitions to be reserved to the republic of France— That the persons above named, in pursuance of the powers vested in them by the said commissions, and in obedience to the instructions of M. Genet and his agents, particularly M. Mangourit, who signed some of the papers, have proceeded by themselves, and by their agents, without any authority from the United States, or from this state, to enroll numbers of the citizens of this state, whom they de∣luded with the hopes of plunder and the acquisition of riches, in the service of the republic of France, to be subject to the orders of Mr. Genet, the Minister Plenipotentiary of France.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="027920_0004_0FD65B2F63424E60"/>That Stephen Drayton and John Hamilton, also citizens of this state, have made application to the good citizens thereof to engage in this scheme of raising men in this state for the service of France, to act under the orders of M. Genet, and to commit acts of hostility against nations at peace with the United States of America; and have avowed that they acted by the authority of M. Genet, the Minister Plenipotentiary of the Republic of France; that upon the whole of the information which your committee have been able to obtain, this is a daring and dangerous attempt by a foreign minister to intermeddle in the affairs of the United States, to usurp the powers of government, and to levy troops in the bosom of the union, without the authority, and contrary to the express sense of the government of the United States, and in violation of the laws of nations—</P>
<P>That the direct tendency of these measures of the foreign minister is to disturb the internal tranquility of the United States, and to involve them in hostilities with nations with whom they are now at peace, which sound policy requires should be preserved.—That in the opinion of your committee this attempt is the more dangerous and alarming as many citizens of the United States have been thereby seduced from their duty by insidious arts practiced on their kindred af∣fection to the French republic; and have been drawn into a scheme, in the exe∣cution of which they have usurped the functions of government, and exercised the power of the sword, which the wisdom of the constitution hath vested exclu∣sively in the Congress and President of the United States.—That this committee therefore recommend that the governor of this state be requested to issue his pro∣clamation, forbidding all persons from enrolling any of the citizens of this state, and prohibiting the citizens from enlisting under any officers, or for any pur∣poses not previously sanctioned by the government of the United States, or of this state; and also forbidding all unlawful assemblages of troops, unauthorised by government; and that the governor be requested to exert the whole public force to the utmost extent, if necessary, to insure obedience to his proclamation.</P>
<P>That in the opinion of this committee, the said William Tate, Jacob R. Brown, Robert Tate, Stephen Drayton, John Hamilton, and Richard Speke, have been guilty of high crimes and misdemesnours; and they recommend that the attorney-general and solicitors be directed, forthwith to institute, or cause to be instituted and conducted, prosecutions in the proper courts of law, against the said William Tate, Jacob R. Brown, Robert Tate, Stephen Drayton, John Ha∣milton, and Richard Speke, for accepting, or engaging to accept commissions from a foreign power, to raise troops within the United States, and for going about within the state, levying or attempting to levy troops, and for seducing, and en∣deavoring to seduce the citizens of this state, to enroll themselves for foreign service, to commit acts of hostility against nations, with whom the United States are at peace, without the permission of the government, and contrary to the proclama∣tion of the President of the United States, declaring these states to be in a state of neutrality and peace.</P>
<P>That copies of the evidence collected by this committee, together with the proceedings of this House thereon, be forwarded immediately to the President of the United States, and to the executives of the states of North-Carolina and Georgia, for their information.</P>
<P><HI>Resolved unanimously,</HI> That this House do concur in the said report.</P>

That the spoil was to be so distributed, as to leave a certain portion thereof to the French nation, viz. two parts; but into how many parts the whole was to be divided, the deponent cannot recollect—The said William Tate, informed this deponent, that in pursuance of his instructions, he had sent out several persons, to enlist men in this state, into the French service; that if the measures taken, should be successful, blank commissions would be sent on from the Northward, and each person would receive a commission, according to the number of men he should enlist—The deponent saith, that this was set forth in the instructions; this deponent, further saith, that the said William Tate, told this deponent, that the object of the enlistment was, to march to South America, and attack the Spanish dominions.
