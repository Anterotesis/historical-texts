<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>THAT little part of the Earth which this Age has known by the Name of <HI>New-England,</HI> has been an object of very signal both <HI>Frowns</HI> and <HI>Favours</HI> of Heaven. Besides those <HI>Stars of the first Magni∣tude,</HI> which did sometimes <HI>Shine</HI> and at last <HI>Set,</HI> in this Horizon, there have been several men of Renown, who were preparing and fully resolved to Transport themselves hither, had not the Lord seen Us Unworthy of more such Mercies. It is still fresh in the memory of many yet Living, that that great man Dr. <HI>John Owen,</HI> had given order for his passage in a Vessel bound for <HI>Boston;</HI> being invited to Succeed the other Famous <HI>Johns,</HI> who had been <HI>Burning and Shining Lights</HI> in that which was the first Candlestick, set up in this Populous Town; but a special Providence diverted him. Long before that, Dr. <HI>Ames</HI> (whose Family and whose Library <HI>New-England</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="000724_0004_0FAA446D244650E0"/>
has had) was upon the Wing, for this <HI>American Desert:</HI> but-God then took him to the <HI>Heavenly Canaan.</HI> Whether he left his fellow upon Earth I know not: such acuteness of <HI>Judgment,</HI> and affectionate <HI>Zeal,</HI> as he Excelled in, seldom does meet together in the same Person. I have often thought of Mr. <HI>Paul Bayne,</HI> his farewel words to Dr. <HI>Ames</HI> when going for <HI>Holland;</HI> Mr. <HI>Bayne</HI> perceiving him to be a man of Extraordinary parts, <HI>Beware</HI> (said he) <HI>of a Strong Head, and a Cold Heart.</HI> It is rare for a <HI>Scholastical Wit,</HI> to be joined with an <HI>Heart warm in Religion:</HI> But in him it was so. He has sometimes said, that he could be willing to walk Twelve Miles on his Feet, on condition he might have an Opportunity to <HI>Preach</HI> a Sermon: And he seldom did Preach a Sermon without <HI>Tears.</HI> When he lay on his Death-bed, he had such Tasts of the <HI>First Fruits of Glory,</HI> as that a Learned Physitian (who was a Papist) wondring, said, <HI>Num Protestantes sic solent mori:</HI> Is the Latter End of <HI>Protestants</HI> like this mans? But although some Excellent Per∣sons, have, by a Divine hand been kept from coming into these <HI>Ends of the Earth,</HI> yet there have been others, who whilest Living made this <HI>Land</HI> (which before their Arrival was an <HI>Hell of Dark∣ness</HI>) to be a place full of <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Glory:</HI> a∣monst whom the <HI>Champions,</HI> whose <HI>Lives</HI> are here described, are worthy to be reckoned as those that have <HI>attained to the First Three.</HI></P>

There are many who have (and some to good purpose) Endeavoured to Collect the Memora∣ble Passages that have occurred in the <HI>Lives</HI> of Eminent men, by means whereof Posterity has had the knowledge of them. <HI>Hierom</HI> of old, wrote <HI>De Viris illustribus:</HI> The like has been done by <HI>Gennadius, Epiphanius, Isidore, Prochorus,</HI> and o∣ther Ancient Authors. Of Later Times, <HI>Schopfius,</HI> his <HI>Academia Christi; Meurs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us,</HI> his <HI>A∣thenae Batavae; Verheiden,</HI> his <HI>Elogia Theologorum, Melchior Adams,</HI> Lives of Modern Divines, have preserved the Memories of some that did worthily, and were in their day Famous. There are two Learned men who have very lately ingaged in a Service of this nature, <ABBR>Viz.</ABBR> <HI>Paulus Freherus,</HI> who has Published two Volumns in <HI>Folio,</HI> with the Title of, <HI>Theatrum virorum Eruditione clarorum, ad haec usque Tempora.</HI> He proceeds as far as the year 1680. The other is <HI>Henningus Witten,</HI> who has Written, <HI>Memoriae Theologorum nostri seculi.</HI> It is a <HI>Trite</HI> (yet a <HI>true</HI>) Assertion, that <HI>Historical Studies</HI> are both Profitable and Pleasant. And of all Historical Narratives, those which give a Faithful account of the <HI>Lives</HI> of Eminent Saints, must needs be the most Edifying. The great∣est part of the <HI>Sacred Writings</HI> are <HI>Historical;</HI> and a Considerable part of them is taken up in relating the Actions, Speeches, Exemplary <HI>Lives,</HI> and <HI>Deaths,</HI> of such as had been choice Instruments in the Hand of the Lord, to promote His Glory in
<PB N="6" REF="000724_0006_0FAA446EADBB4298"/>
the World. No doubt but that the Commemo∣ration of the <HI>Remarkable Providences</HI> of God to∣wards His Servants, will be some part of their Work in Heaven for ever, that so He may have Eternal Praises for the Wonders of His Grace in Christ towards them. It must needs therefore be in it self, a thing pleasing to God, and a special act of <HI>Obedience</HI> to the <HI>Fifth Commandment,</HI> to En∣deavour the Preservation of the Names and Ho∣nour of them, who have been <HI>Fathers</HI> in <HI>Israel.</HI> On which account, I caneot but Rejoyce in what is here done. Although <HI>New England</HI> has been favoured with many Faithful and Eminent Mi∣nisters of God, there are only <HI>Three</HI> of them all, whose <HI>Lives</HI> have been as yet Published, <ABBR><HI>Viz</HI></ABBR> Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> whose Life was Written by his Immediato Successor Mr. <HI>Norton:</HI> and my Father <HI>Mather,</HI> whose was done by another Hand, and is Re∣published in Mr. <HI>Sam. Clark's</HI> last Volumn: and Mr. <HI>Eliot,</HI> whose was done by the same Hand, which did <HI>these,</HI> and has been several Times Reprinted in <HI>London.</HI> Here the Reader has presented to him <HI>Five</HI> of them who were amongst the chief of the <HI>Fa∣thers,</HI> in the Churches of <HI>New England.</HI> The same Hand has done the like Office of Love and Duty, for many others who were the <HI>Worthies</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> not only in the Churches, but in the <HI>Civil State,</HI> whom the Lord Christ saw meet to use as instruments in Planting the <HI>Heavens</HI> and Laying the Foundation of the <HI>Earth,</HI> in this <HI>New

<P>Whether what is herewith Emitted and Writ∣ten by my <HI>Son,</HI> be as to the <HI>Manner</HI> of it, Well performed, I have nothing to say, but shall leave it unto others to judge as they shall see cause; only as to the <HI>Matter</HI> of the History, I am as∣certained that things are truly related. For al∣though I had Little of personal acquaintance with Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> being a Child not above Thirteen years old when he Dyed, I shall never forget the last Sermon which he Preached at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and his particular Application to the Scholars there, amongst whom I was then a Student new∣ly admitted; and my Relation to his Family since, has given me an Opportunity to know many observable things concerning him. Both <HI>Bostons</HI> have reason to Honour his Memory; And <HI>New England-Boston</HI> most of all, which oweth its Name and being to him more than to any one Person in the World: He might say of <HI>Boston,</HI> much what as <HI>Augustus</HI> said of <HI>Rome, La¦teritiam reperi, mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oream r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liqui:</HI> He found it Little better than a Wood or Wilderness, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ft it a Famous Town with Two Churches in it. I remember, Dr. <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghtfoot</HI> in Honour to his Patron Sir <HI>Roland Cotton,</HI> called one of his Sons, <HI>Cotton:</HI> It doth not repent me, that I gave my Eldest Son, that name in Honour to his Grand∣Father;
<PB N="8" REF="000724_0008_0FAA447026AB1BE0"/>
And the Lord Grant that both of us may be <HI>Followers of him, as he followed Christ.</HI></P>
<P>As for the other three Worthies who have taught the Word of God in this Place, they had their peculiar Excellencies.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> (like <HI>John</HI> the Apostle) did Ex∣cel in <HI>Love:</HI> and he was also strong in <HI>Faith.</HI> In the Time of the <HI>Pequod-War,</HI> he did not only hope, but had assurance, that God would make the English Victorious. He declared that he was, as certain of it, as if he had with his Eyes seen the Victories obtained▪ which came to pass according to his Faith. I well remember, that I heard him once say, that when one of his Daugh∣ters was Sick, and given up as Dead, past re∣covery, he desired Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> to Pray with that Child, and (said he) <HI>Whilest</HI> Mr. <HI>Cotton was Praying I was sure that Child should not then Dy but Live.</HI> That Daughter did Live to be the Mother of many Children; Two of which are now Useful Ministers of Christ: and She is still Live∣ing, a Pious Widow, another <HI>Anna, Serving God Day and Night.</HI> When Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> was called from the Church of <HI>Ipswich</HI> to <HI>Boston,</HI> Mr. <HI>Natha∣nael Rogers</HI> (that Excellent man who was Son to the Famous Mr. <HI>Rogers</HI> of <HI>Dedham</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> and Pastor of the Church of <HI>Ipswich</HI> in <HI>N. E.</HI>) opposed Mr. <HI>Nortons</HI> removal from <HI>Ipswich.</HI> Some saying, that Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> would by his Ar∣gument
<PB N="9" REF="000724_0009_0FAA4474D17E1A88"/>
or Rhetorick or both, get Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> from them at last; Mr. <HI>Rogers</HI> replyed, That <HI>He was afraid of his Faith, more than his Arguments.</HI> Sometimes he was transported with a Prophetical <HI>Afflatus,</HI> of which there were marvellous Instances. His Conversation was both pleasant and profitable; in that he could relate many <HI>Memorable Provi∣dences,</HI> which he himself had the certain know∣ledge of. Whilest I am Writing this, there comes to my mind one very <HI>Pleasant</HI> and yet very <HI>Se∣rious</HI> Story, which he told me▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd I do not Re∣member that ever I met with it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>any where but from him. It was this. There was one Mr. <HI>Snape,</HI> a Puritan Minister, who was by the Bishops, cast into Prison for his <HI>Non-conformity;</HI> when his Money was spent, the Jailour was unkind to him: but one day as Mr. <HI>Snape<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> was on his knees at Prayer, the Window of his Chamber being open, he perceived something was thrown into his Chamber, but resolved he would finish his Work with God, before he would divert to see what it was. When he arose from his knees, he saw a <HI>Purse</HI> on the Chamber floor, which was full of <HI>Gold,</HI> by which he could make his Keeper better natured than he had been. Many such passages, could that good man relate.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> was one whose Memory I must acknowledge, I have peculiar cause to Love and Honour. I was his Pupil several years. He had
<PB N="10" REF="000724_0010_0FAA44755DF0B028"/>
a very <HI>Scholastical Genius.</HI> In the Doctrine of <HI>Grace,</HI> he was exceeding clear; indeed ano∣ther <HI>Austin.</HI> He Loved and Admired Dr. <HI>Twiss,</HI> more than any man that this Age has produced. He has sometimes said to me, Doctor <HI>Twiss</HI> is <HI>Omni Exceptione Major.</HI> He was much in <HI>Prayer:</HI> He would very often spend whole <HI>Dayes</HI> in <HI>Pray∣er</HI> with <HI>Fasting</HI> before the Lord alone in his Study. He kept a strict daily <HI>Watch</HI> over his own heart. He was an <HI>hard Student.</HI> He took notice in a private <HI>Diary,</HI> how he spent his Time every Day: If he found himself not so much inclined to diligence and study, as at other Times, he would reflect on his heart and wayes, lest haply some unobserved sin should provoke the Lord to give him up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Slothful Listless frame of Spirit. In his <HI>Diary,</HI> he would some∣times have these words, <HI>Leve desiderium ad studen∣dum: forsan ex peccato admiss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> I bless the Lord that ever I knew Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> and that I know so much of him as I did.</P>
<P>As for Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> I have in a Preface to his Sermons on the <HI>Canticles,</HI> which are Trans∣cribed for the Press, and now at <HI>London,</HI> given what accounted could then obtain concerning the Remarkable passages of his <HI>Life.</HI> I several Times desired him to imitate <HI>Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius</HI> and some others, who had Written their own <HI>Lives.</HI> He told me, he did intend it: but I could not find any thing of that nature among his Maniscr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pts,
<PB N="11" REF="000724_0011_0FAA447785396700"/>
when many years <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agoe, I had an Occasion to seek after it. He was a <HI>Princely Preacher.</HI> I have heard some say, who knew him in his <HI>Younger years,</HI> that he was then very Fervent and Vehe∣ment as to the manner of his delivery: but in his <HI>Later Times,</HI> he did very much imitate Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> whom in the Gravity of his Countenance, he did somewhat resemble. <HI>Sic ille monus, sic ora ferebat.</HI></P>
<P>The Reader will find many observable things in what is here related concerning Mr. <HI>Hooker.</HI> Yet, great Pity it is that no more can be Col∣lected of the <HI>Memorables</HI> relating to so Good and so Great a man as he was; then whom <HI>Con∣necticut</HI> never <HI>did,</HI> and perhaps never <HI>will,</HI> see a greater Person. Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> in his Preface to Mr. <HI>Nortons</HI> Answer to <HI>Apollonius,</HI> sayes of Mr. <HI>Hooker, Dominatur in Concionibus.</HI> Dr. <HI>Ames</HI> used to say, <HI>He never knew his Equal:</HI> There was a great Intimacy between them two. I remem∣ber, my Father told me, that Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> was the Author of that large Preface which is before Dr. <HI>Ames,</HI> his <HI>Fresh Suit against Ceremonies.</HI> He would sometimes say, that <HI>next to Converting Grace, he Blessed God for his acquaintance with the Principles and Writings of that Learned man,</HI> Mr. <HI>Alexander Richardson.</HI> It was a <HI>Black day</HI> to <HI>New England</HI> when that <HI>Great Light</HI> was removed.</P>
<P>There are some who will not be pleased that any notice is taken of the hard measure which
<PB N="12" REF="000724_0012_0FAA4478257D4A40"/>
these Excellent men had from those <HI>Persecuting Prelates,</HI> who were willing to have the World rid of them. But it is impossible to Write the Histo∣ry of <HI>New-England,</HI> and of the <HI>Lives</HI> of them who were the chief in it, and yet be wholly silent in that matter. That Eminent Person, Dr. <HI>Tillot∣son</HI> (the Late Arch Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI>) did, not above Four years ago, sometimes Express to <HI>Me</HI> his resentments of the injury which had been done to the first Planters of <HI>New-England,</HI> and his Great dislike of Arch Bishop <HI>Lauds</HI> Spirit towards them. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my knowledge, there are <HI>Bishops</HI> at this day, of the same Christian <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Moderation</HI> with that Great and Good man, lately dead.

<P>§. 1. WHEN the God of Heaven had carried a Nation into a <HI>Wilderness,</HI> upon the Designs of a Glorious REFORMATION, He there gave them a Sin∣gular Conduct of His <HI>Presence</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> in a cer∣tain <HI>Pillar,</HI> which by Day appear'd as a <HI>Cloud,</HI> and by Night as a <HI>Fire,</HI> before them; and the Report of the Respect paid by the <HI>Israelites</HI> unto this <HI>Pillar,</HI> became so Noised among the Gen∣tiles, that the Pagan Poets derided them on this Account,</P>
<P><HI>Nil praeter Nubes et caeli Lumen adorant,</HI></P>

<P><PB N="14" REF="000724_0014_0FAA4479F3972B28"/>
But I must now Observe unto my Reader, That more than a Score of years after the Be∣ginning of the <HI>Age</HI> which is now expiring, our Lord Jesus Christ, With a Thousand Wonders of His Providence, carried into an <HI>American</HI> Wil∣derness, a People, Persecuted for their Desire, to See, and Seek a REFORMATION of the Church ACCORDING TO THE SCRIP∣TURE: Of which Matter, it cannot give a <HI>Briefer,</HI> and yet <HI>Fuller,</HI> History, than by Reciting the Memorable Words, of that Great Man, Dr. JOHN OWEN, Who, in his Golden Book of, <HI>Communion with God,</HI> thus Expresses it; <Q>They who hold <HI>Communion</HI> with the Lord Jesus Christ, will Admit <HI>Nothing,</HI> Practise <HI>Nothing,</HI> in the Worship of God, but what they have <HI>His</HI> War∣rant for; Unless it comes in His Name, With a, <HI>Thus saith the Lord Jesus,</HI> they will not Hear an <HI>Angel from Heaven:</HI> They know, the <HI>Apo∣stles</HI> themselves were to teach the Saints, only <HI>What He Commanded them:</HI> And <HI>You</HI> know, How many in this Very Nation, in the Dayes not long since passed, Yea, how many <HI>Thousands,</HI> Left their <HI>Native Soyl,</HI> and went into a Vast and howling <HI>Wilderness,</HI> in the uttermost parts of the World, to keep their Souls Undefiled, and Chast unto their dear Lord Jesus, as to <HI>This</HI> of His Worship and Institutions.</Q> Now though the <HI>Reformed Church,</HI> thus <HI>Fled into the Wilderness,</HI> Enjoy'd not the Miraculous <HI>Pillar</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="000724_0015_0FAA447AA3FA24E0"/>
Vouchsafed unto the <HI>Erratic Church,</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> for about Forty years together; Yet, for that Num∣ber of years, We Enjoy'd many a <HI>Person,</HI> in whom the Good <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, gave a Conduct unto us, and Mercifully dispensed, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Direct∣ing, Defending, Refreshing Influences, which were as necessary for us, as any that the Cele∣brated <HI>Pillar</HI> of <HI>Cloud,</HI> and <HI>Fire,</HI> could have afford∣ed. The <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Good Shepherd</HI> of the Church, favoured His distressed <HI>Flocks in the Wilderness,</HI> with many <HI>Pastors,</HI> that were Learned, Prudent, and Holy, beyond the Common Rates, and <HI>Men after His own Heart:</HI> and it would be an In∣gratitude many wayes Pernicious, if the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> should not, like those of the Primitive Times, have their <HI>Diptychs,</HI> Wherein the Memory of those Eminent CONFESSORS, may be Recorded and Preserved.</P>

and Salvations, of the Churches in my Country, from Corruption, and Oblivion; and <HI>Assist</HI> the Interests of <HI>Religion</HI> in the Churches abroad, with the <HI>Experiences</HI> of a Renowned Plantation, Settled in a NEW WORLD, Purely for the sake of the most <HI>Reformed Religion;</HI> I set my self to Write the <HI>Church-History</HI> of these <HI>American</HI> Colonies. In the Writing of this <HI>Church-History,</HI> the <HI>Biography</HI> of several Persons, that were <HI>Stars of the First Magnitude</HI> in our <HI>Hea∣vens,</HI> was no little part of my Labour; Wherein, my <HI>Memoirs</HI> of Mr. <HI>John Wilson</HI> happening to be seen by a Gentleman related unto <HI>him,</HI> he Im∣portuned me, that I would Permit the Publica∣tion of those <HI>Memoirs</HI> apart themselves. That I might somewhat accommodate my self unto this Importunity, I did consent that Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> should first Go out of my <HI>Church-History,</HI> provided he might go accompanied with no Less than <HI>Three</HI> other JOHNS, who were all of them, Successively Ministers of that <HI>One Church,</HI> Where∣of <HI>He</HI> was the First Pastor; all of them, <HI>Lovely in their Lives,</HI> and in the Place <HI>of</HI> their <HI>Death,</HI> as well as in their Better Place <HI>after</HI> their Death, <HI>not Divided;</HI> and, thought I, by my first sending abroad this <HI>Dove,</HI> I shall understand, Whether the <HI>Flood</HI> of Disorders upon the World, be so Circumstanced, That the rest of my Composure, Whereof <HI>These</HI> are but some <HI>Rescinded Sheets,</HI> may have Encou∣ragements also to come Abroad. <HI>Four</HI> of my

Worthy Friends accordingly, whose Names, I hope, are in the <HI>Book of Life,</HI> took the charge of these <HI>Four Lives,</HI> and send forth a Little <HI>Book,</HI> embalming the <HI>Names,</HI> of <HI>Just men, Wor∣thy to be had in Everlasting Remembrance.</HI> But though this were the <HI>Occasion</HI> of this <HI>Offer,</HI> yet here was not all the <HI>Intention</HI> of it: For I saw a Fearful <HI>Degeneracy, Creeping,</HI> I cannot say, but <HI>Rushing,</HI> in upon these Churches; I saw to mul∣tiply continually, our Dangers, of our Loosing no small Points in our <HI>First Faith,</HI> as well as our <HI>First Love,</HI> and of our Giving up the <HI>Essen∣tials</HI> of that <HI>Church Order,</HI> which was the very END of these Colonies; I saw, a Visible <HI>Shrink</HI> in all Orders of Men among us, from that <HI>Greatness,</HI> and that <HI>Goodness,</HI> which was in the <HI>First Grain,</HI> that our God brought from <HI>Three Sifted Kingdoms,</HI> into this Land, when it was a <HI>Land not Sown;</HI> That while the <HI>Papists</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI> have grown better of late years, by the Growth of <HI>Jansenism</HI> among them, while the <HI>Protestants</HI> have Prodigiously <HI>Waxed Worse,</HI> for a Revolt unto <HI>Pelagianism,</HI> and <HI>Socinianism,</HI> or what is <HI>Half way</HI> to it, has not been more Surprising to me, than to see that in <HI>America,</HI> while those parts which were at first Peopled by the <HI>Refuse</HI> of the English Nation, do sensibly amend in the Regards of Sobriety and Educa∣tion, those parts which were <HI>Planted with a more Noble Vine,</HI> do so fast give a Prospect of
<PB N="18" REF="000724_0018_0FAA447CDDF27548"/>
affording only the <HI>Degenerate Plants of a Strange Vine.</HI> What should be done, for the Stop, the Turn, of this <HI>Degeneracy?</HI> It is Reported of the <HI>Scythians,</HI> who were, doubtless, the Ancestors of the <HI>Indians</HI> first Inhabiting these Regions, That in Battels, when they came to stand upon the <HI>Graves</HI> of their <HI>Dead Fathers,</HI> they would there <HI>Stand,</HI> Immoveable, till they Dy'd upon the Spot: And, thought I, Why may not such a Method now Effectually Engage the <HI>English</HI> in these Regions, to <HI>Stand Fast</HI> in their <HI>Faith</HI> and their <HI>Order,</HI> and in the <HI>Power of Godliness?</HI> I'le show them, the <HI>Graves</HI> of their <HI>Dead Fathers;</HI> and if any of them do Retreat, unto a Con∣tempt or Neglect of <HI>Learning,</HI> or unto the <HI>Errors</HI> of <HI>Another Gospel,</HI> or unto the Superstiti∣ons of <HI>Will-Worship,</HI> or unto a <HI>Worldly,</HI> a <HI>Selfish,</HI> a <HI>Little</HI> Conversation, they shall undergoe the Irresistible Rebukes of their Progenitors, here fetch'd <HI>from the Dead,</HI> for their Admonition: and I'le therewithal advertise my NEW-ENG∣LANDERS, That if a Grand child of a <HI>Moses</HI> become an <HI>Idolater,</HI> he shall, [as the Jews Re∣mark upon Judg. 18. 30 be destroy'd, as if not a <HI>Moses,</HI> but a <HI>Menasseh,</HI> had been his Fa∣ther.

<PB N="21" REF="000724_0021_0FAA4480DE4D81E0"/>
of the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> to be the <HI>Terms</HI> of our Sacred Fellowship: We dare make no Difference between a <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> a <HI>Congregational,</HI> an <HI>Episcopalian,</HI> and an <HI>Antipaedo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aptist,</HI> where their <HI>Visible Piety,</HI> makes it probable, that the Lord Jesus Christ has Received them. And such Reverend Names, as HALL, and KID∣DER, most Worthy <HI>Bishops</HI> now adorning the <HI>English Church,</HI> as well as the Names of such Reverend and Excellent Persons among the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> as BATES, ANNESLY, HOW, MEAD, and ALSOP, (with many <HI>Others</HI>) are, on <HI>that Score,</HI> together Precious unto this part of the Christian-<HI>America.</HI> On the other side; The <HI>TRUE PROTESTANT REFOR∣MING Church of ENGLAND,</HI> contains the whole <HI>Body of the Faithful,</HI> Scattered through the English Dominions, though of Different Perswasions about some <HI>Rites,</HI> and <HI>Modes,</HI> and Lesser points of Religion: And All the Friends of the last <HI>Reformation,</HI> Who, whether they think there needs a <HI>Further Progress</HI> in that Work or no, yet are Willing to make the WORD OF GOD, the <HI>Rule</HI> of their Serving Him, do come under this Denomination. Those Divines, who, with Arch-Bishop <HI>Usher</HI> in the Head of them, did, more than Fifty years ago, give in a Paper touching the <HI>Innovations</HI> of Doctrine and of Discipline in the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and make near Forty Exceptions against
<PB N="22" REF="000724_0022_0FAA44815FD05D08"/>
Things in the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> were still as Good Mem∣bers of that Church, as they that <HI>Hated to be Reformed;</HI> and the Assembly of Divines at <HI>Westminster,</HI> which made the Catechisms now used among us, were as genuine <HI>Sons of the Church</HI> after they became <HI>Non-Conformists,</HI> as while they Lived in <HI>Conformity,</HI> which every one of them, Except <HI>Eight</HI> or <HI>Nine,</HI> did, when they first came together. One who is at this Day a Right Reverend BISHOP, has in his <HI>Irenicum</HI> well Expressed, the Sense, which I believe, the biggest party of Christians in the Realm, Three to One, have of those matters, which have been, <HI>The Apples of Strife,</HI> among us: <Q>That Christ, who came to take away the Insupportable Yoke of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Ceremo∣nies, certainly did never intend to Gall the Necks of the <HI>Disciples</HI> with <HI>another</HI> instead of it; and it would be Strange, the <HI>Church</HI> would Require more than <HI>Christ</HI> Himself did, and make more Terms of <HI>Communion,</HI> than our Saviour did of <HI>Disciple-ship.</HI> The Grand <HI>Com∣mission</HI> the Apostles were sent out with, was only to <HI>Teach, What Christ had Commanded them;</HI> not the Least Intimation of any <HI>Power,</HI> given them to Impose or Require any Thing, beyond what He <HI>Himself</HI> had spoken to them, or they were directed to, by the Immediate Guidance of the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God.</Q>—And, [Speaking of the Reason, why our first Compilers of the <HI>Com∣mon
<PB N="23" REF="000724_0023_0FAA448225C2A428"/>
Prayer,</HI> took in so much of the <HI>Papish Service</HI>] <Q>Certainly, those Holy men, who did seek by any Means, to Draw in others, at such a Distance from their Principles, as the Papists were, did never intend, by what they did for that End, to Exclude any truly Tender Consciences, from their Communion; That which they laid as a <HI>Bait</HI> for them, was never intended by Them as an <HI>Hook</HI> for those of our own Profession.</Q> And if this be the <HI>TRUE, Church of ENGLAND,</HI> give me leave to say, The Churches of <HI>New England,</HI> are no Incon∣siderable part of <HI>it;</HI> and that accordingly we may have a Room in it, I may safely, in the Name of them all, offer, (as did the Renowned Author of our <HI>Martyr books,</HI> when they demand∣ed <HI>Subscription</HI> from him,) <HI>To Subscribe the New Testament.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole then; If any be displeased at my Report of the Unjust <HI>Impositions</HI> and <HI>Per∣secutions,</HI> which drove into <HI>America,</HI> as Good <HI>Christians,</HI> and <HI>Protestants,</HI> as any that were Left behind them, it will not be, the <HI>TRUE Church of ENGLAND;</HI> For why should <HI>That</HI> be called, <HI>The Church of England,</HI> which has caused Thou∣sands of as Real and Thorough <HI>Christians,</HI> as any upon Earth, to say, <HI>It is better to dwell in the Wilderness, than with such an Contentious and Angry One!</HI> That <HI>Church of ENGLAND,</HI> which alone is Worthy to be called <HI>So,</HI> will bewayl,

Let my Reader, thus Prepared, now Entertain himself, as far as he pleases, with our Four JOHNS, to whose <HI>Lives,</HI> I have, upon the Counsil and Command of an Ever-Honoured Parent, Appendiced the <HI>Life</HI> of a Famous THOMAS, in this Publication: JOHNS, with whom among the Five or Six Hundred Noted Persons of <HI>that Name,</HI> Celebrated by <HI>One</HI> Historian, I find not many that were Worthy to be Compared; JOHNS, fuller of Light and Grace and the Good Spirit, than all those Four or Five and Twenty of <HI>that Name,</HI> who have Sat in the Chair that Pretends to <HI>Infallibility.</HI> And, if he pleases, Let him see that Old Little Observations Confirmed, that, as the Name <HI>Henry,</HI> has been Happy in Kings, <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in Queens, <HI>Edward,</HI> in Law∣yers, <HI>William,</HI> in Physicians, <HI>Francis,</HI> in Scholars, <HI>Robert,</HI> in Souldiers and States-men, So, JOHN, has been happy in <HI>Divines.</HI> But let him Con∣sider these <HI>Lives,</HI> as tendered unto the Publick, upon an Account no less, than that of keeping <HI>Alive,</HI> as far as this poor <HI>Essay</HI> may Contribute thereunto, the Interests of <HI>Dying Religion</HI> in our Churches. I Remember a Learned mans Con∣jecture, That [in 1 Tim. 3. 15.] it is <HI>Timothy,</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="000724_0025_0FAA4483CEED4230"/>
and not, <HI>The Church,</HI> which is called, <HI>The Pillar and Ground of Faith:</HI> Such Able, Holy, and Faith∣ful Ministers, as <HI>Timothy,</HI> are the Great <HI>Proclamers,</HI> and <HI>Preservers</HI> of <HI>Truth,</HI> for the Church of God: <HI>Such</HI> were these Famous JOHNS, while they <HI>Lived,</HI> and now they are <HI>Dead,</HI> I have done my Endea∣vour that they may still be <HI>Such,</HI> unto the Churches, to whom I owe my <HI>All.</HI> I'l say but This. The Last words of the most Renowned Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ebend of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> Dr. <HI>Peter du Moulin,</HI> who dyed, a very Old Man, about Eleven years ago, were, <HI>Since Calvinism is Cryed down</HI> [Actum est de Religione Christi apud Anglos] <HI>Christianity is in Danger to be last in the English Nation.</HI> Allud∣ing to what <HI>he</HI> said, about his JOHN CALVIN, I will take Leave to say with respect unto our JOHN COTTON, and the rest that here ac∣company him, <HI>Christianity will be Lost among us, if their Faith and Zeal, must all be Buried with them:</HI> Which, God Forbid! As there would be an hazard, that the Early and Better Times of <HI>New England,</HI> would have the <HI>True Story</HI> there∣of, within a While, as Irrecoverably Lost, as the Story of the World, relating to those Times, which <HI>Varro</HI> Distinguished unto <HI>Incognit,</HI> and <HI>Fabulous,</HI> preceding the <HI>Historical,</HI> and we should Shortly have as Wretched Narratives of the first <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Actions</HI> in this Land, as <HI>Justin</HI> gives of the <HI>Jewes,</HI> when he makes <HI>Moses</HI> the Son of their <HI>Joseph,</HI> and the Sixth of their <HI>Kings,</HI> or when he

makes <HI>Them</HI> Expell'd from <HI>Egypt,</HI> because the Gods would not otherwise allay a Plague that Raged there, or such as are given by <HI>Pliny,</HI> when he makes <HI>Moses</HI> a Magician, or <HI>Strabo,</HI> that makes him an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Priest; if no speedy <HI>Care</HI> be taken to preserve the <HI>Memorables</HI> of our <HI>First▪ Settlement;</HI> So, I wish, the Laudable <HI>Principles</HI> and <HI>Practices</HI> of that <HI>First Settlement,</HI> may be kept from utterly being Lost in our Apostasies, by the <HI>Care</HI> which is now taken thus to preserve what was <HI>Memora∣ble,</HI> of the <HI>Men</HI> that have delivered them down unto us.</P>
<P>§. 5. Finally; When the Apostles had set before Christians, the Saints, which were a <HI>Cloud of Witnesses,</HI> by Imitating of whose Exemplary Behaviour we might <HI>Enter into Rest,</HI> he concludes with a <HI>Looking unto Jesus;</HI> or, according to the Emphasis of the Original, <HI>A Looking off</HI> (from them) <HI>unto Jesus,</HI> as the Incomparably most perfect of all. So, Let my Reader do, when, all that was <HI>Imitable,</HI> in the <HI>Lives</HI> of these Worthy Men, has had his Contemplation and Admiration; They all yet had their <HI>Defects,</HI> and therefore, <HI>Look off unto Jesus; Following Them</HI> no farther than they <HI>Followed Him.</HI> It is a notable Passage, [in Luk. 7. 28.] which we mis-translate; <HI>The Least in the Kingdom of God, is Greater than JOHN.</HI> In the Greek, What we Translate, <HI>The Least,</HI> is, <HI>He that is Lesser;</HI> that is, <HI>He that is Younger. [Minor,</HI>

still has been the same with, <HI>Junior.</HI>] Our Lord means <HI>Himself,</HI> who was <HI>Lesser,</HI> that is, <HI>Younger,</HI> than JOHN, His <HI>Fore-runner;</HI> but, <HI>Greater than He!</HI> Truly, whatever was Excellent in these our JOHNS, I would Pray, that the Minds of all that see it, may be Raised still to Think, <HI>Our Precious Lord JESUS CHRIST, is Greater than these</HI> JOHNS: All their <HI>Excellencies,</HI> are in Him Transcendently, Infinitely; as they were from <HI>Him</HI> Derived. <HI>High Thoughts</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, Provoked by <HI>Reading</HI> the Descriptions, of these His <HI>Excellent</HI> Servants, that had in them a Little of <HI>Him,</HI> and were no farther <HI>Excellent</HI> than <HI>as</HI> they had so, will make me an abundant Recompence, for all the Difficulties, and all the Temptations, with which my <HI>Writing</HI> is attended. And as, it quickens the <HI>Joyes</HI> of my Hastening <HI>Death,</HI> when I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have through Grace, a Prospect of being then in that State, whereto the <HI>Spirits</HI> of these <HI>Just Men made Perfect,</HI> are all of them <HI>Gathered,</HI> So I would have <HI>This</HI> now to Out do all those <HI>Joyes, To be with JESUS CHRIST, That</HI> Surely, <HI>is by far the best of all.</HI></P>

<P>After the INTRODUCTION,</P>
<P>FIRST, The DESIGN Where-<HI>on,</HI> the MAN∣NER Where-<HI>in,</HI> the PEOPLE Where-<HI>by,</HI> the several Colonies of NEW-ENGLAND were Planted, is Declared: And a Narrative is given of many <HI>Memorable Passages,</HI> relating to the Set∣tlement of those Plantations: Concluded with an <HI>Ecclesiastical Map</HI> of the Country, or, a List of the several <HI>Assemblies</HI> in these Colonies, Where∣in the Gospel is at this Day Preached, and of the
<PB N="29" REF="000724_0029_0FAA448876DA1958"/>
<HI>Ministers</HI> who Preach the Gospel to those Assemblies.</P>
<P>The FIELD being thus prepared, We Pro∣ceed, <HI>Then,</HI> unto the <HI>History</HI> of what has been <HI>Acted</HI> there▪upon. And here,</P>
<P>First, The ACTORS of <HI>New England,</HI> are with a very Entertaining Variety of <HI>Story,</HI> Introduced.</P>
<P>The ACTORS, in a <HI>Civil Order,</HI> are first brought in.</P>
<P>Here we Write the <HI>Lives</HI> of the Four among the <HI>First Governours,</HI> BRADFORD, WIN∣THROP, HOPKINS, and EATON, in each of the Four Colonies, (and of WINTHROP, the First Governour of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>New-haven</HI> united,) and <HI>Characters</HI> of all the rest: With the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ames,</HI> of all that have been their Magistrates.</P>
<P>The ACTORS, in a <HI>Sacred Order,</HI> are then brought in. <HI>Brief Memoirs,</HI> are here at∣tempted, concerning all the MINISTERS, Which have come over from <HI>England</HI> for the Service of these Churches: With more <HI>Large Accounts</HI> of Mr. <HI>Bulkly, Bur, Chauncey, Cobbet, Cotton, Daven∣port, Eliot, Fisk, Hooker, Knowles, Mather, Newman, Norton, Parker, Philips, Rogers, Rogers, Shepard, Symmes, Stone, Ward, Whiting, Wilson:</HI> Of all whom, a <HI>Biography</HI> is Endeavoured. Whereto are Appendiced, <HI>Brief Memoirs,</HI> on such as coming over in the Infancy of the Settlement, Entered not upon their Ministry, until their E∣ducation was here perfected, but Before or With∣out
<PB N="30" REF="000724_0030_0FAA448918D0A558"/>
the Advantages of the <HI>Colledge;</HI> With more <HI>Large Accounts,</HI> of Mr. <HI>Sherman,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thacher.</HI></P>
<P>From hence, We pass on to the History of our <HI>University.</HI> Where, with its <HI>Lawes, Bene∣factors,</HI> and <HI>Vicissitudes,</HI> We give a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of such as have been therein Educated; and many <HI>Historical Remarks</HI> upon that <HI>Catalogue.</HI> With fuller Essayes upon some that have been more Eminent <HI>Plants</HI> issuing from this <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsery;</HI> Es∣pecially, Mr. <HI>Samuel Mather,</HI> Mr. <HI>Mitchel, Oakes, Shepard,</HI> and <HI>Collins.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, The ACTIONS of <HI>New England,</HI> are then Considered: Which are of Two Sorts.</P>
<P>First, The SYNODICAL ESTABLISH∣MENTS, are Produced; With many Material <HI>Relations,</HI> and <HI>Conclusions,</HI> further tending to Il∣lustrate the Determinations of our several SYNODS.</P>
<P>Here we do at Large, Lay before the Reader,</P>
<P>The <HI>Faith</HI> professed by the Churches of <HI>New England.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Discipline</HI> Practised in the Churches of <HI>New-England;</HI> With the <HI>Platform</HI> agreed by the <HI>Synod,</HI> in 1648. Whereto are added, The <HI>Heads of Agreement,</HI> in the Late Union between the Ministers formerly called, <HI>Presbyterian</HI> and <HI>Congregational.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Principles</HI> owned and <HI>Endeavours</HI> used by the Churches of <HI>New England</HI> concerning the <HI>Church-state</HI> of their <HI>Posterity:</HI> With the
<PB N="31" REF="000724_0031_0FAA4489E8952130"/>
Propositions of the <HI>Synod,</HI> in 1662: and follow∣ing Occurrences.</P>
<P>The <HI>Reforming Synod.</HI> of <HI>New England,</HI> in 1679. With Subsequent Essayes of <HI>Reformation</HI> in the Churches.</P>
<P>Unto all which, there are annexed, The Pro∣posals that have been made in these Churches, about the Recording of <HI>Remarkable Pro∣vidences:</HI> and many <HI>Remarkables</HI> are here particularly Recorded.</P>
<P>Then, the OPPOSING, and AFFLICTIVE <HI>Disturbances,</HI> which have been given to the Interests of the Churches under these <HI>Establish∣ments,</HI> are Exhibited.</P>
<P>The General Heads of <HI>Temptation,</HI> which have been distressing of Good Men in the Land, from the Beginning, are Enumerated, and Conveniently Exemplified.</P>
<P>The Encounters, which the Churches have had, with several Sorts of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> are, with Proper and Useful Reflections, described.</P>

<HEAD>OR, THE LIFE OF Mr. JOHN COTTON.</HEAD>
<P>§. 1. WERE I Master of the Pen, wherewith <HI>Palladius</HI> em∣balmed his <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> the Greek Patriark, or <HI>Posid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nius</HI> Eternized his <HI>Austin,</HI> the Latin Oracle, among the Ancients; Or, were I Owner of the Quil, where∣with among the Moderns, <HI>Beza</HI> celebrated his Immortal <HI>Calvin,</HI> or <HI>Fabius</HI> Immortalized his Ve∣nerable <HI>Beza;</HI> the Merits of <HI>John Cotton</HI> would oblige me to Employ it, in the Embalm∣ing his Famous Memory. If <HI>Boston</HI> be the chief <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat of <HI>New England,</HI> it was <HI>Cotton</HI> that was the
<PB N="2" REF="000724_0034_0FAA448BDF3B02A8"/>
Father and Glory of <HI>Boston:</HI> Upon which account it becomes a piece of pure <HI>Justice,</HI> that the <HI>Life</HI> of Him, who above all men gave <HI>Life</HI> to his Country, should bear no little Figure in <HI>its</HI> intend∣ed History; and indeed it any Person in this Town or Land, had the <HI>Blessedness,</HI> which the Roman Historian, long since pronounced <HI>Such,</HI> even, <HI>To do Things worthy to be Writ, and to Write Things worthy to be Read,</HI> it was <HI>He;</HI> who now claims a Room in our Pages. If it were a Com∣parison sometimes made of the Reformers, <HI>Pome∣ranus</HI> was a Grammarian, <HI>Just<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Jonas</HI> was an Orator, <HI>Melancth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> was a Logician, but <HI>Luther</HI> was <HI>All:</HI> even that Proportion, it may without <HI>Envy</HI> be acknowledged that <HI>Cotton</HI> bore to the Rest of our <HI>New English</HI> Divines; He that, whil'st he was <HI>Living</HI> had this Virtue Extraordinarily Conspicuous in him, <HI>That it was his delight always, to acknowledge the Gifts of God, in other men,</HI> must now he is <HI>Dead,</HI> have other men acknowledge of him, what <HI>Erasmus</HI> do's of <HI>Jerom, In boc uno con∣junctum fuit et Eximium, quicquid in al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is partim ad∣miramur.</HI></P>
<P>§. 2. There was a good <HI>Heraldry</HI> in that speech of the Noble <HI>Romanus, It is not the Blood of my Progenitors, but my Christian Profession that makes me Noble.</HI> But our <HI>John Cotton,</HI> besides the Advantage of his <HI>Christian Profession,</HI> had a Descent from Honourable <HI>Progenitors,</HI> to render him <HI>dou∣bly</HI> Honourable. His Immediate <HI>Proginitors</HI> being
<PB N="3" REF="000724_0035_0FAA448CF3D44B98"/>
by some Injustice, Deprived of Great Revenues, his Father Mr. <HI>Roland Cotton,</HI> had the Education of a <HI>Lawyer</HI> bestowed by his Friends upon him, in hopes of his being the better capacitated there∣by to Recover the Estate, whereof his Family had been wronged; and so the Profession of a <HI>Lawyer,</HI> was that unto which this Gentleman ap∣plied himself all his Dayes. But our <HI>John Cotton,</HI> in this Happier than <HI>Austin,</HI> whose <HI>Fa∣ther</HI> was carefuller to make an <HI>Orator</HI> than a <HI>Christian</HI> of him, while his Gracious <HI>Mother</HI> was making him on greater <HI>Accounts, A Son of her ma∣ny Tears,</HI> had a very pious <HI>Father</HI> in this worthy, <HI>Lawyer,</HI> as well as a pious <HI>Mother,</HI> to Interest him in the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God. That worthy man was indeed very singular in two most Imitable <HI>Practices.</HI> One was, that when any of his Neigh∣bours desirous to Sue▪ one another, addressed him for <HI>Counsel,</HI> it was his manner, in the most per∣swasive and obliging terms that could be, to En∣deavour a <HI>Reconciliation</HI> between both parties; pre∣ferring the <HI>Consolations</HI> of a <HI>Peace-maker,</HI> before all the <HI>Fees,</HI> that he might have got by Blowing up of <HI>Differences.</HI> Another was, that every <HI>Night,</HI> it was his Custome to <HI>Examine Himself,</HI> with Re∣flections on the Transactions of the Day past; wherein, if he found, that he had not either, <HI>Done</HI> good unto others, or <HI>Got</HI> good unto his own Soul, he would be as much grieved as ever the Famous <HI>Titus</HI> was, when he could complain in
<PB N="4" REF="000724_0036_0FAA448D6205AFB0"/>
the Evening, <HI>Amici Diem Perdidi!</HI> Of such Pa∣rents was Mr. <HI>John Cotton</HI> born, at the Town of <HI>Derby,</HI> on the Fourth of <HI>December;</HI> in the year 1585.</P>
<P>§. 3. The Religious Parents of Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> were Solicitous to have him indued with a <HI>Learn∣ed,</HI> as well as a <HI>Pious</HI> Education; and being nei∣ther so <HI>Rich,</HI> that the <HI>Mater Artis,</HI> could have no Room to do her part, nor so <HI>Poor</HI> that the <HI>Res Augusta D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mi,</HI> should clog his Progress, they were well fitted thereby, to bestow such an E∣ducation upon him. His first Instruction was under a Good School-Master, one Mr. <HI>Johnson,</HI> in the Town of <HI>Derby:</HI> whereon the Intellectu∣al Endowments of all sorts, with which the <HI>God of our Spirits,</HI> adorned him, so discovered themselves, that at the Age of <HI>Thirteen,</HI> his Pro∣ficiency procured him Admission into <HI>Trinity-Colledge</HI> in <HI>Cambridge.</HI> Indeed the Proverb, <HI>Soon Ripe, Soon Rotten,</HI> has often been too <HI>Hastily</HI> ap∣plyed unto <HI>Rathe-ripe Wits,</HI> in young People; not only <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mpadius</HI> and <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ancihon,</HI> who Com∣menced <HI>Batchelours of Arts,</HI> at <HI>Fourteen</HI> years of Age, and <HI>Luther,</HI> who Commenced <HI>Master of Arts</HI> at Twenty; but also our Dr. <HI>Juel</HI> sent unto <HI>Oxford,</HI> our Dr. <HI>Usher</HI> sent unto <HI>Dublin,</HI> and our Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> sent unto <HI>Cambridge,</HI> all at the Age of <HI>Thirteen,</HI> do put in a <HI>Barr</HI> to the Universal Ap∣plication, of that Proverb. While Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> was at the University, his <HI>Diligent Head,</HI> with <HI>Gods
<PB N="5" REF="000724_0037_0FAA449138D80850"/>
Blessing,</HI> made him a <HI>Rich Scholar;</HI> and his Ge∣nerous mind found no little <HI>Nourishment</HI> by that <HI>Labour,</HI> which like the Sage Philosopher, he found <HI>Sweeter than any Idleness:</HI> insomuch that his being Elected Fellow of <HI>Trinity Colledge,</HI> as the Reward of his Quick-Proficiency, was Diverted by no∣thing but this, that the Extraordinary Charges for their Great <HI>Hall</HI> then in Building, did put by their <HI>Election.</HI> And there was this Remarkable in the Education of this <HI>Chosen Vessel,</HI> at the Univer∣sity: That while he continued <HI>there,</HI> his Father's Practice was, by the special Providence of God, augmented so much beyond what it had been <HI>before,</HI> as was enough to mentain him there: Up∣on which Observation Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> afterwards would say, <HI>'Twas God that kept me at the Univer∣sity!</HI> Indeed some have said, That the Great Notice quickly taken of the Eminency in the <HI>Son,</HI> was one Reason, why his <HI>Father,</HI> not only came to be complemented on all sides, and <HI>Omnes Om∣nia Bona dicere, &amp; laudare Fortunas ejus, qui Filium haberet Tali Ingenio praeditum,</HI> but also had his <HI>Clients</HI> more than a little multiplied.</P>
<P>§. 4. Upon the Desires of <HI>Emanuel</HI>-Colledge, Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> was not only <HI>Removed</HI> unto that Col∣ledge, but also <HI>Preferred</HI> unto a <HI>Fellowship</HI> in it; in order whereunto, he did according to the Cri∣tical and Laudable <HI>Statutes</HI> of the House, go through a very severe <HI>Examen</HI> of his Fitness for
<PB N="6" REF="000724_0038_0FAA4491DE23F140"/>
such a Station; wherein 'twas particularly Re∣marked, that the <HI>Poser</HI> trying his <HI>Hebrew</HI>-skill by the Third Chapter of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> a Chapter which, containing more Hard Words, than any one <HI>Pa∣ragraph</HI> of the Bible, might therefore have puz∣zled a very good Hebrician, yet <HI>he</HI> made nothing of it. He was afterwards, the <HI>Head Lecturer,</HI> the <HI>Dean,</HI> the <HI>Catechist,</HI> in that Famous Colledge; and became a <HI>Tutor</HI> to many Scholars, who after∣wards proved Famous Persons, and had cause to Bless God, for the Faithful, and Ingenious and Laborious <HI>Communicativeness</HI> of this their <HI>Tutor. Here,</HI> all his Academical Exercises, whether in <HI>Disputations</HI> or in <HI>Common-places,</HI> or whatever else, did so <HI>smell of the, Lamp,</HI> that the Wit, the Strength, the Gravity, and the Fulness, both of <HI>Reason</HI> and of <HI>Reading</HI> in them, caused him to be much Admired by the Sparkling Wits of the University. But <HI>One</HI> thing among the Rest, which caused a Great Notice to be taken of him, throughout the whole University, was his <HI>Funeral Oration</HI> upon Dr. <HI>Some,</HI> the Master of <HI>Peter House,</HI> wherein he approved himself such a Master of <HI>Periclaean,</HI> or <HI>Ciceronian</HI> Oratory, that the Auditors were even ready to have Acclamed, <HI>Now Vox Ho∣minem Sonat!</HI> And that which added unto the Reputation, thus Raised for him, was, an <HI>Univer∣sity-Sermon,</HI> wherein Aiming more to Preach <HI>Self,</HI> than <HI>Christ,</HI> he used such Florid Strains, as extreme∣ly Recommended him, unto <HI>the most,</HI> who Relished
<PB N="7" REF="000724_0039_0FAA44939FB278B0"/>
the <HI>Wisdom of words</HI> above the <HI>Words of Wis∣dom:</HI> though the Pompous Eloquence of that Sermon, afterwards gave such a Distast unto his own <HI>Renewed Soul,</HI> that with a Sacred Indignation he threw his Notes into the Fire.</P>
<P>§. 5. Hitherto we have seen the <HI>Life</HI> of Mr.<HI>Cotton,</HI> while he was not yet <HI>Alive!</HI> Though the Restraining and Preventing <HI>Grace</HI> of God, had kept him from such Out-breakings of Sin, as Defile the Lives of most in the World, yet like the <HI>Old man,</HI> who for such a cause ordered this Epitaph to he Written on his Grave, <HI>Here lyes an Old Man, who lived but Seven years,</HI> he Reckoned himself to have been but a <HI>Dead Man,</HI> as being <HI>Alienated from the Life of God,</HI> until he had Expe∣rienced that <HI>Regeneration,</HI> in his own Soul, which was <HI>thus</HI> Accomplished. The Holy Spirit of God had been at work upon his <HI>Young Heart,</HI> by the Ministry of that Reverend and Renowned <HI>Preacher of Righteousness,</HI> Mr. <HI>Perkins;</HI> but he Re∣sisted and Smothered those <HI>Convictions,</HI> through a vain <HI>Perswasion,</HI> that if he became a <HI>Godly</HI> Man 'twould spoil him for being a <HI>Learned</HI> One. Yea such was the Secret Enmity and Prejudice of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Unregenerate Soul,</HI> against <HI>Real Holiness,</HI> and such the <HI>Torment,</HI> which our Lords <HI>Witnesses</HI> give t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Consciences of the <HI>Earthly-minded,</HI> that whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he heard the Bell toll for the Funeral of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Perkins,</HI> his mind secretly rejoyced in his Delive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ance,
<PB N="8" REF="000724_0040_0FAA4494A26C58F0"/>
from that Powerful Ministry, by which his Conscience had been so oft Beleagured: The Remembrance of which thing afterwards, did break his Heart Exceedingly! But he was, at length, more effectually awakened, by a Sermon o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Dr. <HI>Sibs,</HI> wherein was Discoursed the Misery of those, who had only a <HI>Negative Righteousness,</HI> or a Civil, Sober, Honest <HI>Blamlesness</HI> before men. Mr▪ <HI>Cotton</HI> became now very sensible of his own Miserable Condition before God; and the <HI>Ar∣rows</HI> of these Convictions, did stick so fast up∣on him, that after no less than <HI>Three years</HI> Dis∣consolate Apprehensions under them, the <HI>Grace</HI> of God made him a throughly <HI>Renewed Christian,</HI> and filled him with a Sacred <HI>Joy,</HI> which Accom∣panied him, until he went unto the <HI>Fulness of Joy</HI> for ever. For this cause, as Persons truly Converted unto God have a mighty and lasting Affection for the Instruments of their Conversi∣on; thus Mr. <HI>Cottons</HI> Veneration for Dr. <HI>Sibs,</HI> was after this very particular and perpetual; and it caused him to have the <HI>Picture</HI> of that Great Man, in that part of his house, where he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight oftenest Look upon it. But so the <HI>Yoke</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f sore Temptations and Afflictons and long Spi∣ritual Trials, fitted him, to be an Eminently Use∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l Servant of God in his Generation!</P>
<P>§. 6. Some time after this Change upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> it came unto his turn again to
<PB N="9" REF="000724_0041_0FAA4495945E4390"/>
Preach at St. <HI>Maries;</HI> and because <HI>he</HI> was to Preach, an High Expectation was Raised, through the <HI>whole University,</HI> that they should have a Ser∣mon, flourishing indeed, with all the <HI>Learning</HI> of the <HI>whole University.</HI> Many Difficulties had Mr▪ <HI>Cotton</HI> in his own Mind now, what Course to steer. On the one side▪ he considered, That if he should Preach with a Scriptural and Christian <HI>Plainness,</HI> he should not only wound his own <HI>Fame</HI> exceedingly, but also Tempt Carnal men to Revive an Old Cavil, <HI>That Religion made Schol∣ars turn Dunces,</HI> whereby the Name of God might suffer not a little. On the other side, he consi∣dered, That it was his Duty to Preach with such a <HI>Plainness,</HI> as became the <HI>Oracles</HI> of God, which are intended for the Conduct of men in the <HI>Pathes of Life,</HI> and not for <HI>Theatrical</HI> Ostentations and Entertainments, and the Lord needed not any <HI>Sin</HI> of ours to mentain His own Glory. Hereupon Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> Resolved that he would Preach a <HI>Plain Sermon,</HI> even such a Sermon, as, in his own Conscience, he thought would be most pleasing unto the Lord Jesus Christ; And he dis∣coursed Practically and Powerfully, but very so∣lidly upon the <HI>Plain</HI> Doctrine of <HI>Repentance.</HI> The Vain Wits of the University, Disappointed thus, with a <HI>more Excellent</HI> Sermon, that shot some Troublesome Admonitions into their Conscien∣ces, discovered their Vexation at this Disappoint∣ment, by their not <HI>Humming,</HI> as according to
<PB N="10" REF="000724_0042_0FAA4495ABE0E518"/>
their sinful and absurd Custome, they had for∣merly done; and the <HI>Vice-Chancellor</HI> for the very same Reason also, <HI>Graced</HI> him not, as he did o∣thers, that pleased him. Nevertheless, the satis∣faction, which he enjoyed in his own <HI>Faithful Soul,</HI> abundantly compensated unto him, the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of any Humane Favour or Honour; nor did he go without many Encouragements from so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Doctors,</HI> then having a Better Sense of <HI>Religion</HI> upon them, who Prayed him to persevere in the <HI>Good way of Preaching,</HI> which he had now taken▪ But Perhaps the Greatest Consolation of all, was a Notable Effect of the Sermon then Preached The Famous Dr. <HI>Preston,</HI> then a Fellow of <HI>Queen's Colledge</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and of Great Note in the University, came to hear Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> with the same <HI>Itching Ears,</HI> as others were then led withal. For some good while after the beginning of the Sermon, his Frustrated Expectation caused him to manifest his Uneasiness all the ways that were then possible; but before the Sermon was end∣ed, like one of <HI>Peter's</HI> Hearers, he found himself <HI>Pierced at the Heart▪</HI> His Heart within him wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now struck with such Resentments of his ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Interiour state</HI> before the God of Heaven, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could have no Peace in his own Soul, till with <HI>Wounded Soul,</HI> he had Repaired unto Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> from whom he received those Further Assistances wherein he became a <HI>Spiritual Father,</HI> unto one of the Greatest men in his Age.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="000724_0043_0FAA44967B4F45F8"/>
§. 7. The Well-disposed People of <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> after this, Invited Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> to be∣come their Minister; with which Invitation, out of a Sincere and Serious Desire to Serve our Lord in His Gospel, after the Solemnest Addres∣ses to Heaven for Guidance in such a Solemn Affair, he complied. At this Time, the <HI>Mayor</HI> of the Town, with a more Corrupt Partie, hav∣ing procured another Scholar from <HI>Cambridge,</HI> more agreeable to them, would needs have him to Preach before Mr. <HI>Cotton:</HI> but the <HI>Church-Warden</HI> pretending to more of Influence, upon their Ecclesiastical matters, over-ruled it. How∣ever when the matter came to a <HI>Vote,</HI> amongst those to whom the Right of Election did by Charter belong, there was an <HI>Equi-Vote</HI> for Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> and that other Person; Only the <HI>Mayor,</HI> who had the Casting-Vote, by a strange Mistake pricked for Mr. <HI>Cotton.</HI> When the <HI>Mayor</HI> saw his Mistake, a <HI>New-Vote</HI> was urged and granted; wherein it again proved an <HI>Equi-Vote;</HI> but the <HI>Mayor</HI> most unaccountably mis∣tooke again, as he did before. Extremely Dis∣pleas'd here at, he pressed for a <HI>Third Vote;</HI> but the Rest would not Consent unto it; and so the Election fell upon Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> by the <HI>Involuntary Cast</HI> of that very Hand, which had most oppos∣ed it. This Obstruction to the Settlement of Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> in <HI>Boston,</HI> being thus Conquered, ano∣ther follow'd; For the Bishop of the <HI>Diocess,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="000724_0044_0FAA44971ED762C0"/>
having understood that Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> was infected with <HI>Puritanism,</HI> set himself immediatly to Dis∣courage his being there; only he could Object nothing but, <HI>That</HI> Mr. Cotton, <HI>being a Young man, he was not so fit upon that Score, to be over such a Numerous and such a Factious People.</HI> And Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> having Learned no otherwise to value himself, than to Concur with the Apprehensions of the <HI>Bishop;</HI> intended, therefore, to Return unto <HI>Cambridge:</HI> But some of his Friends, against his Inclination, knowing the <HI>True way of doing it;</HI> soon charmed the <HI>Bishop,</HI> into a Declared O∣pinion; that Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> was an Honest, and a Learned Man. Thus the Admission of Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> unto the Exercise of his Ministry in <HI>Boston,</HI> was Accomplished.</P>
<P>§. 8. Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> found the more <HI>Peaceable</HI> Reception among the People, through his own want of Internal <HI>Peace;</HI> and because his continu∣al Exercises, from his <HI>Internal</HI> Temptations and Afflictions, made all People see, that instead o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Serving this or that Party, his chief care was a∣bout the Salvation of his <HI>Own Soul.</HI> But the Stirs, which had been made in the Town, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Arminian Controversies,</HI> then Raging, put him upon Further Exercises; whereof he has him∣self given us a Narrative in the Ensuing Words <Q>When I was first called to <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> so it was, that Mr. Dr. <HI>Baron,</HI> Son of Dr. <HI>Baron,</HI> (the Divinity Reader of <HI>Cambridge</HI>) first broach∣ed,
<PB N="13" REF="000724_0045_0FAA4497E3081FD8"/>
that which was, then, called <HI>Lutheranism;</HI> since <HI>Arminianism:</HI> as being indeed himself, Learned, Acute, Plausible in Discourse, and fit to Insinuate into the Hearts of his Neighbours. And though he were a <HI>Physitian</HI> by Profession (and of a good skill in that Art) yet he spent the greatest Strength of his Studies, in clearing and promoting the <HI>Arminian</HI> Tenents. Whence it came to pass, that in all the great <HI>Feasts</HI> of the Town, the chiefest-Discourse at the Table, did ordinarily fall upon <HI>Arminian</HI> Points, to the Great Offence of Godly Ministers, both in <HI>Boston,</HI> and Neighbour-Towns. I coming a∣mong them, a <HI>Young man,</HI> thought it a part both of Modesty and Prudence, not to speak much to the Points, at first, among Strangers and Antients: Untill afterwards, after hearing of many Discourses, in Publick Meetings, and much Private Discourse with the Doctor, I had Learned at length, where all the great <HI>Strength</HI> of the Doctor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay. And then Observing (by the <HI>Strength</HI> of Christ) how to avoid such Ex∣pressions, as gave him any Advantage, in the Ex∣pressions of <HI>Others,</HI> I began Publickly to Preach and in Private Meetings to Defend, the Doctrine of Gods <HI>Eternal Election,</HI> before All <HI>Fore-sight</HI> of <HI>Good</HI> or <HI>Evil,</HI> in the Creature; and the <HI>Redemp∣tion (ex gratia)</HI> only of the <HI>Elect;</HI> the Effectu∣al <HI>Vocation</HI> of a sinner, <HI>Per <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rresist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bilem Gratiae Vim,</HI> without all Respect of the Preparations of

<HI>Free-Will;</HI> and Finally, the Impossibility of the <HI>Fall</HI> of a Sincere Believer, either Totally or Fi∣nally from a <HI>Sate of Grace.</HI> Hereupon, when the Doctor had Objected many Things; and heard my Answers to those <HI>Scruples,</HI> which he was wont most plausibly to urge; presently af∣ter, our Publick Feasts, and Neighbourly Meet∣ings were Silent, from all further Debates about <HI>Predestination,</HI> or any of the Points, which de∣pend thereupon, and all matters of Religion were carried on Calmly and Peaceably.</Q></P>
<P>About half a year after Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> had been at <HI>Boston,</HI> thus usefully employ'd, he visited <HI>Cambridge,</HI> that he might then and there proceed <HI>Batchelour of Divinity;</HI> which he did: And his <HI>Concio ad Clerum▪</HI> on Math. 5. 13. <HI>Vos estis Sal Terrae,</HI> was highly esteemed by the Judicious. Nor was he less Admired for his very Singular Acuteness, in <HI>Disputation,</HI> when he answered the <HI>Divinity Act</HI> in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chools; wherein he had for his Opponent a most A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>te Antagonist, namely Dr. <HI>Chappel,</HI> who was afterwards Provost of <HI>Trinity-Colledge</HI> in <HI>Dublin;</HI> and one unhappily Successful in promoting the <HI>New Pelagianism.</HI></P>

Settled now at <HI>Boston,</HI> his Dear Friend, Holy Mr. <HI>Bayns;</HI> recommended unto him a Pious Gentlewoman, one Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Horrocks▪</HI> the Sister of Mr. <HI>James Horrocks,</HI> a Famous Minister in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> to become his Consort in a <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>yed

Estate.</HI> And it was Remarkable, that on the very <HI>Day</HI> of his <HI>Wedding,</HI> to that Eminently Vir∣tuous Gentlewoman, he first Received that As∣surance of God's <HI>Love</HI> unto his own <HI>Soul,</HI> by the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, effectually Applying His <HI>Promise</HI> of Eternal <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> unto him, which happi∣ly kept with him all the Rest of his Dayes: For which cause he would afterwards often say, <HI>God made that Day a Day of Double Marriage to me!</HI> The <HI>Wife</HI> which by the <HI>Favour of God,</HI> he had now <HI>Found,</HI> was a very Great <HI>Help</HI> unto him, in the Service of God; but especially upon <HI>this,</HI> among many other Accounts; That the Peo∣ple of her own Sex, observing her more than Ordinary <HI>Discretion, Gravity,</HI> and <HI>Holiness,</HI> would still Improve the Freedom▪ of their Address unto <HI>her,</HI> to acquaint her, with the Exercises of their own Spirits; who acquainting her Husband with convenient Intimations thereof, occasioned him in his Publick Ministry more <HI>Particularly</HI> and <HI>Profitably,</HI> to Discourse those things that were of Everlasting Benefit.</P>
<P>§. 10. After he had been three years in <HI>Boston,</HI> his careful Studies and Prayers brought him to apprehend more of <HI>Evil</HI> remaining <HI>Unreformed</HI> in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> than he had hereto∣fore considered; and from this time, he became a Conscientious <HI>Non-Conformist,</HI> unto the <HI>Unscrip∣tural,</HI> Ceremonies and Constitutions yet mentained

by that Church; but such was his Interest in the Hearts of the People, that his <HI>Non-Confor∣mity</HI> instead of being <HI>Disturbed,</HI> was indeed <HI>Em∣braced,</HI> by the greatest part of the Town. How∣ever, at last, Complaints being made against him unto the <HI>Bishops-Courts;</HI> he was for a <HI>while▪</HI> then put under the Circumstances of a <HI>Silenced Mini∣ster</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in all which <HI>while,</HI> he would still give his Presence at the <HI>Publick Sermons,</HI> though never at the <HI>Common Prayers,</HI> of the <HI>Conformable.</HI> He was now offered▪ not only the <HI>Liberty</HI> of his Ministry, but very great <HI>Preferment</HI> in it also, if he would but Conform to the <HI>Scrupled Rites,</HI> though but in <HI>One Act,</HI> and but for <HI>One Time:</HI> Nevertheless his Tender Soul, afraid of being thereby <HI>Polluted,</HI> could not in the least comply with such Temp∣tations. A <HI>Storm</HI> of many Troubles upon him, was now <HI>Gathering;</HI> but it was very Strangly diverted! For that very man, who had Occa∣sioned this Affliction to <HI>him,</HI> now became hear∣tily Afflicted for his own Sin in doing of it; and a Stedfast, Constant, Prudent Friend, Presenting a <HI>Pair of Gloves</HI> to a <HI>Proctor</HI> of an Higher Court▪ then appeal'd unto, that <HI>Proctor</HI> without Mr. <HI>Cotton's</HI> Knowledge, Swore <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Animam Domini,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> was a <HI>Conformable man:</HI> which things Issued in Mr. <HI>Cotton's</HI> being Restored unto the Exercise of his Ministry.</P>
<P>§. 11. The <HI>Storm</HI> of <HI>Persecution</HI> being thus Blown

over, Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> enjoyed <HI>Rest</HI> for many years. In which time he Faithfully employed his great Abilities, not in Gaining, men to this or that <HI>Party</HI> of <HI>Christians,</HI> but in Acquainting them with the more Essential and Substantial Points of <HI>Christianity.</HI> In the space of Twenty years that he lived at <HI>Boston,</HI> on the <HI>Lord's Days</HI> in the <HI>Afternoons,</HI> he Thrice went over the <HI>Body of Di∣vinity</HI> in a <HI>Catechistical, way;</HI> and gave the Heads of his Discourse to Young Scholars, and others in the Town, that they might answer to his Questions in the Congregation; and the An∣swers he opened and applied unto the General Advantage of the Hearers. Whilest he was in this way Handling the <HI>Sixth Commandment,</HI> the Words of God which he uttered were so <HI>Quick and Powerful,</HI> that a Woman among his Hearers, who had been Married Sixteen years to a <HI>Second Husband,</HI> now in Horrour of Conscience, openly Confessed her Murdering her <HI>Former Husband</HI> by Poison, though thereby the exposed her self to the Extemity of being <HI>Burned.</HI> In the <HI>Forenoons</HI> of the <HI>Lord's Days,</HI> he Preached over the First Six Chapters in the Gospel of <HI>John,</HI> the whole Book of <HI>Ecclesiastes,</HI> the Prophesy of <HI>Zephaniah,</HI> the Pro∣phesy of <HI>Zechary,</HI> and many other Scriptures. When the Lords Supper was Administred, which was once a Month, he Handled the <HI>Eleventh</HI> Chapter in the First Epistle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> and the <HI>Thirteenth</HI> Chapter in the Second Book of
<PB N="18" REF="000724_0050_0FAA449DE47319B8"/>
the <HI>Chronicles;</HI> and some other pertinent Para∣graphs of the Bible. In his <HI>Lectures,</HI> he went through the whole First and Second Epistles of <HI>John;</HI> the whole Book of <HI>Solomons Song;</HI> the <HI>Parables</HI> of our Saviour to the Seventeenth Chap∣ter of <HI>Matthew.</HI> His House also was full of Young Students; whereof some were sent unto him out of <HI>Germany,</HI> some out of <HI>Holland;</HI> but most out of <HI>Cambridge.</HI> For Dr. <HI>Preston,</HI> would still Advise his near-fledg'd Pupils, to go live with Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> that they might be fitted for Publick Service; insomuch that it was grown almost a Proverb, <HI>That Mr. Cotton, was Dr. Prestons Seasoning Vessel:</HI> and of those, that issued found this Learned Family, Famous, and Useful in their Generation, the well known Dr. <HI>Hill,</HI> was not the least. Moreover he kept a <HI>Dayly Lecture</HI> in his House, which, as very Reverend Ear-Wit∣nesses have expressed it, <HI>He performed with much Grace, to the Edification of the Hearers:</HI> And unto this <HI>Lecture</HI> many Pious People in the Town, would constantly resort, until upon a Suspicion of some Inconveniency, which might arise, from the growing <HI>Numerousness</HI> of his Auditory, he left it off. However, besides his Ordinary Lecture every <HI>Thursday,</HI> he Preached <HI>thrice</HI> more; every Week, on the <HI>Week-Days;</HI> namely on <HI>Wednesdays</HI> and <HI>Thursdays,</HI> early in the Morning, and on <HI>Sa∣ture-Dayes</HI> at Three in the Afternoon. And be∣sides these Immense Labours, he was frequently

Thus was this <HI>Good man</HI> a most Indefatigable <HI>Doer of Good.</HI></P>
<P>§. 12. The Good <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, so Plenti∣fully, and Powerfully accompanied the Ministry of this Excellent man, that a Great <HI>Reformation</HI> was thereby wrought in the Town of <HI>Boston. Profaneness</HI> was extinguished, <HI>Superstition</HI> was aban∣doned, <HI>Religion</HI> was Embraced and Practised a∣mong the <HI>Body</HI> of the People; yea, the <HI>Mayor</HI> with most of the Magistrates were now called <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ritans,</HI> and the <HI>Satanical party,</HI> was become Insignificant. As to the matter of <HI>Non Conformi∣ty,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> was come to Forbear the <HI>Ceremo∣nies</HI> enjoyned in the Church of <HI>England;</HI> for which he gave this Account. <Q>The Grounds were two: <HI>First,</HI> The <HI>Significacy</HI> and <HI>Efficacy</HI> put upon 'em, in the Preface to the Book of <HI>Com∣mon-Prayer;</HI> That <HI>they were neither Dumb, nor Dark, but apt to stir up the Dull Mind of Man, to the Remembrance of his Duty to God, by some No∣table

Which made it appear to me utterly un∣lawful for any <HI>Church Power</HI> to enjoyn the Ob∣servation of <HI>Indifferent Ceremonies,</HI> which Christ had <HI>not commanded:</HI> And all the <HI>Ceremonies</HI> were alike <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the <HI>Commandment</HI> of Christ, though they had been <HI>Indifferent</HI> other∣wise; which, indeed <HI>Others</HI> have Justly pleaded, they were <HI>not.</HI></Q> But this was not all; For Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> was also come to Believe, That <HI>Scripture-Bishops</HI> were appointed to Rule no larger a Dio∣cess, than a <HI>Particular Congregation;</HI> and that the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Lord, with the <HI>Keyes</HI> of Ecclesi∣astical Government, are given by Him to a <HI>Con∣gregational Church.</HI> It hence came to pass that our Lord Jesus Christ, was now Worshiped in <HI>Boston,</HI> without the use of the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> or of those <HI>Vestments,</HI> which are by <HI>Zanchy</HI> called <HI>Execrabile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Vestes;</HI> yea, the sign of the <HI>Cross</HI> was laid aside, not only in <HI>Baptism,</HI> but also in the <HI>Mayors Mace,</HI> as worthy to be made a <HI>Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ushtan,</HI> be∣cause it had been so much abused unto <HI>Idola∣try.</HI> And besides all this, there were some Scores of Pious People in the Town, who more exactly formed themselves, into an Evangelical <HI>Church-State,</HI> by entring into <HI>Covenant</HI> with God, and
<PB N="21" REF="000724_0053_0FAA44A029971458"/>
with one another, <HI>To follow after the Lord, in the Purity of his Worship.</HI> However the main Bent and Aim of Mr. <HI>Cottons</HI> Ministry was, <HI>To Preach a Crucified Christ;</HI> and the Inhabitants of <HI>Boston</HI> Observed, that God Blessed them in their <HI>Secu∣lar</HI> Concernments, remarkably the more, through <HI>his</HI> Dwelling among them: For many <HI>Strangers,</HI> and some too, that were Gentlemen of Good Quality, Resorted unto <HI>Boston,</HI> and some Remo∣ved their Habitations thither, on <HI>his</HI> Account; whereby the Prosperity of the Place, was very much promoted.</P>
<P>§. 13. As his <HI>Desert</HI> of it was very <HI>High,</HI> so the <HI>Respect</HI> which he met withal was far from <HI>Low.</HI> The <HI>Best</HI> of his Hearers <HI>Loved</HI> him Great∣ly, and the <HI>Worst</HI> of them <HI>Feared</HI> him, as <HI>Know∣ing that he was a Righteous &amp; an Holy man.</HI> Yea, such was the <HI>Greatness</HI> of his Learning, his Wis∣dom, his Holiness, that <HI>Great Men</HI> took no little notice of him. A very Honourable Per∣sonage Rode Thirty Miles to see him; and af∣terwards professed, <HI>That he had as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hear</HI> Mr. Cottons <HI>Ordinary Exposition in his Family, as any Ministers Publick Preaching that he knew in</HI> Eng∣land. Whilst he continued in <HI>Boston</HI> Dr. <HI>Preston</HI> also would constantly come once a year to visit him; from his Exceeding value for Mr. <HI>Cottons</HI> Friendship. Arch Bishop <HI>Williams</HI> did likewise greatly Esteem him, for his Incomparable Parts;
<PB N="22" REF="000724_0054_0FAA44A0E161F1B8"/>
and when he was <HI>Keeper of the Great Seal▪</HI> he Recommended Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> to the Royal Favour. Moverover the Earl of <HI>Dorchester</HI> and of <HI>Lindsey,</HI> had much Regard unto him; which Happened partly on this Occasion: The Earl's coming in∣to <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> about the Dreyning of some Fenny Grounds. Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> was then in his course of Preaching on Gal. 2. 20. Intending to Preach on the Duties of <HI>Living by Faith in Adversity;</HI> but considering that those Noble-men were not much Acquainted with <HI>Afflictions,</HI> he altered his In∣tentions, and so ordered it, that when they came to <HI>Boston,</HI> he Discoursed on the Duties of <HI>Living by Faith in Prosperity:</HI> When the Noble∣men were so much <HI>Taken</HI> with what they <HI>Heard,</HI> that they assured him, If at any time, he should want a <HI>Friend</HI> at Court, <HI>They</HI> would Improve all their Interest for him. And when Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> did <HI>Plainly</HI> but Wisely Admonish them, of cer∣tain <HI>Pastimes on the Lords Day,</HI> whereby they gave some Scandal, they took it most kindly from him; and promised a <HI>Reformation.</HI> But none of the <HI>Roses</HI> cast on this Applauded <HI>Actor, Smothered</HI> that Humble, that Loving, that Graci∣ous Disposition, which was his Perpetual <HI>Ornament.</HI></P>
<P>§. 14. At Length, doubtless to Chastise, the Seldom Unchastised Evils of <HI>Divisions,</HI> crept in among the Christians of <HI>Boston,</HI> in pleased the God of Heaven to deprive them of Mr. <HI>Cottons</HI>

Ministry, by laying a <HI>Tertain Ague</HI> upon him, for a year together. But being Invited unto the Earl of <HI>Lincoln's,</HI> in pursuance to the Advice of his Physicians, that he should <HI>change the Air,</HI> he removed thither; and thereupon he happily Re∣covered. Nevertheless, by the same Sickness he then lost his Excellent Wife; who having liv∣ed with him <HI>Childless,</HI> for Eighteen years, went from him now to be <HI>For ever with the Lord:</HI> whereupon he travelled further a field, unto <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and some other Places, whereby the Reco∣very of his Lost Health was further perfected. About a year after this, he Practically appeared in Opposition to <HI>Tertullianism,</HI> by proceeding unto a <HI>Second Marriage;</HI> wherein one Mrs. <HI>Sarah Story,</HI> a Virtuous Widow, very Dear to his for∣mer Wife, became his Consort; and by her he had both <HI>Sons and Daughters.</HI></P>
<P>§. 15. Although our Lord had hitherto made the Discretion and Vigilancy of Mr. <HI>Thomas Leveret</HI> (afterwards a <HI>double Honoured</HI> El∣der of the Church, in another Land) the hap∣py Occasion of Diverting many Designs, to molest Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> for his <HI>Non Conformity,</HI> yet when the Sins of the place had Ripened it, for so <HI>Dark</HI> a Vengeance of Heaven, as the <HI>Removing of this Eminent Light,</HI> a Storm of Persecution could no longer be avoided. A Debauch'd Fellow in the Town, who had been punished by the
<PB N="24" REF="000724_0056_0FAA44A4D9100FB8"/>
Magistrates for his Debaucheries, Contrived and Resolved a <HI>Revenge</HI> upon them, for their <HI>Justice:</HI> and having no more Effectual way to vent the Cursed Malice of his heart, than by bringing them into Trouble at the <HI>High Commission Court,</HI> up he goes to <HI>London,</HI> with Informations to that Court, that the Magistrates did not <HI>Kneel at the Sacrament,</HI> nor observe some other <HI>Ceremonies</HI> by Law imposed. When some that belonged unto the Court signified unto this Informer, that he must put in the <HI>Ministers Name, Nay</HI> (said he) <HI>the Minister is an Honest man, and never did me any wrong:</HI> but it being further pressed upon him, that all his Complaints, would be Insignifi∣cant, if the <HI>Ministers Name</HI> were not in them, he then did put i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in: And <HI>Letters Missive</HI> were dispatched Incontinently, to Convent Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> before the Infamous <HI>High Commission Court.</HI> But before we Relate, what became of Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> we will enquire, what became of his <HI>Accuser?</HI> The Renowned Mr. <HI>John Rogers</HI> of <HI>Dedham,</HI> having been on his Lecture-Day, just before his going to Preach, Advised, that Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> was brought into this Trouble, he took Occasion, to speak of it in the <HI>Sermon,</HI> with just <HI>Lamen∣tations</HI> for it; and among others, he used Words to this purpose: <HI>As for that man, who hath caused a Faithful Pastor, to be driven from his Flock, he is a Wisp, used by the Hands of God, for the Scowring of his People; But mark the words now spoken by a

Minister of the Lord! I am verily perswaded, the Judgments of God, will overtake the Man, that has done this thing: Either he will Die under an Hedge, or something else, more than the Ordinary Death of men shall befall him.</HI> Now behold, how this Prediction was accomplished! This miserable man quickly after this, Dy'd of the <HI>Plague,</HI> un∣der an <HI>Hedge</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire;</HI> and it was a long Time, e're any could be found, that would Bury him. <HI>This 'tis to turn Persecutor!</HI></P>
<P>§. 16. Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> knowing that <HI>Letters Missive</HI> were out against him, from the <HI>High Commission Court;</HI> and knowing, that if he ap∣peared there, he could expect no other, than to be choaked with such a <HI>Perpetual Imprison∣ment,</HI> as had already Murdered such men as <HI>Bates</HI> and <HI>Udal,</HI> he concealed himself as well as he could, from the Raging <HI>Pursevants.</HI> Ap∣plication was made, in the mean time, to the Earl of <HI>Dorset,</HI> for the Fulfilment of his old Engagement unto Mr. <HI>Cotton;</HI> and the Earl did indeed intercede for him, untill the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Cantebury,</HI> who would often Wish, <HI>Oh! That I could meet with Cotton!</HI> Rendered all his Intercessions both Ineffectual, and Un∣seasonable. Hereupon that Noble Person sent Word unto him, that if he had been guilty of <HI>Drunkenness,</HI> or <HI>Uncleanness,</HI> or any such <HI>Lesser-fault,</HI> he could have obtained his Pardon; but
<PB N="26" REF="000724_0058_0FAA44A720B7EA60"/>
inasmuch as he had been Guilty of <HI>Non-Con∣formity,</HI> and <HI>Puritanism,</HI> the Crime was unpar∣donable; and therefore, said he, <HI>You must Fly for your Safety!</HI> Doubtless, it was from such unhappy <HI>Experiments,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> afterwards Published this Complaint; <HI>The Ecclesiastical Courts are like the Courts of the High Priests and Pharisees, which</HI> Solomon <HI>by a Spirit of Prophecy Styleth,</HI> Dens of Lyons, and Mountains of Leopards. <HI>And those who have to do with them, have found them Markets of the Sins of the People, the Cages of Uncleanness, the Forges of Extortion, the Tabler∣nacles of Bribery, and they have been contrary to the End of Civil Government, which is,</HI> The <HI>Punishment</HI> of Evil Doers, and the <HI>Praise</HI> of them which do well.</P>
<P>§. 17. Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> therefore, now, with <HI>Supplications</HI> unto the <HI>God</HI> of <HI>Heaven</HI> for His Direction, joined <HI>Consultations</HI> of Good <HI>men</HI> on <HI>Earth;</HI> and among others, he did with some of his <HI>Boston</HI> Friends, visit Old Mr. <HI>Dod,</HI> unto whom he laid open the Difficult case now be∣fore him, without any Intimation of his <HI>Own.</HI> Inclination, whereby the Advice of that Holy man, might have been at all forestalled. Mr. <HI>Dod</HI> upon the whole, said thus unto him; <HI>I am Old</HI> Peter, <HI>and therefore must stand still, and bear the Brunt; but you being Young</HI> Peter <HI>may go whether you will, and ought, being Persecuted in one City, to Flee unto another!</HI> And when the <HI>Boston</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="000724_0059_0FAA44A7A1280598"/>
Friends urged, <HI>That they would Support and Pro∣tect Mr.</HI> Cotton, <HI>though Privately; and that if he should leave them, very many of them would be ex∣posed unto Extreme Temptations;</HI> he readily an∣swered, <HI>That the Removing of a Minister, was like the Draining of a Fish-pond; the Good Fish will follow the Water, but Eeles and other Baggage Fish will stick in the Mud:</HI> Which things when Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> heard, he was not a little confirmed in his Inclination to leave the Land. Nor did he forget the Concession of <HI>Cyprian,</HI> That a Seasona∣ble <HI>Flight,</HI> is in Effect▪ <HI>A Confession of our Faith;</HI> for it is a <HI>Profession</HI> that our <HI>Faith</HI> is Dearer un∣to us, than All the <HI>Enjoyments</HI> from which we <HI>Flie.</HI> But that which is further memorable in this Matter, is, That as the Great God often makes His <HI>Truth</HI> to spread by the Sufferings of them, that Profess the <HI>Truth;</HI> Four Hundred were Converted by the Death of one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersecu¦ted <HI>Cecilia;</HI> And the Scotch Bishop would leave off Burning of the Faithful, because the Smoke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> infected as many, as it Blew upon; Thus, the Silencing and Removing of Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> which was to him, a thing little short of <HI>Martyrdome,</HI> was an Occasion of more thorow <HI>Repentance</HI> in sundry of his Bereaved People, who now began to Consider, that God by taking away their Minister, was Punishing their former <HI>Unfruitfulness</HI> under the most Fruitful Ministry, which they had thus long
<PB N="28" REF="000724_0060_0FAA44A87068CAB0"/>
Enjoyed. And there was yet another such Effect of the matter, which is now to be Related.</P>
<P>§. 18. To avoid them, that thirsted for his Ruine, Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> travelled under a Chang'd <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Garb,</HI> with a full purpose of going over for <HI>Holland;</HI> but when he came near the Place; where he would have Shipped himself, he met with a Kinsman, who Vehemently and Effectually perswaded him to Divert into <HI>Lon∣don.</HI> Here the Lord had A <HI>Work</HI> for him to Do, which he little thought of! Some Re∣verend and Renowned Ministers of our Lord in that Great City, who yet had not seen Sufficient Reason to Expose themselves unto <HI>Per∣secutions</HI> for the sake of <HI>Non-Conformity,</HI> but Look'd upon the Imposed <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> as <HI>Indifferent and Sufferable Trifles,</HI> and Weigh'd not the Aspect of the <HI>Second Commandment,</HI> upon all the <HI>Parts</HI> and <HI>Means</HI> of <HI>Instituted Worship;</HI> took this Op∣portunity for a <HI>Conference</HI> with Mr. <HI>Cotton;</HI> be∣ing perswaded, That since <HI>he</HI> was, <HI>No Passionate, but a very Judicious man,</HI> they should prevail with him rather to <HI>Conform,</HI> than to leave his <HI>Work</HI> and his <HI>Land.</HI> Unto the Motion of a <HI>Conference</HI> Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> most readily yielded; and <HI>First,</HI> all <HI>their</HI> Arguments for <HI>Conformity,</HI> toge∣ther with Mr. <HI>Byfields,</HI> Mr. <HI>Whatel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> and Mr. <HI>Sprints,</HI> were produced; all of which Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> answered, unto their Wonderful Satisfaction.
<PB N="29" REF="000724_0061_0FAA44A948949C08"/>

the year 1633. Where he put a Shore at <HI>New-Boston,</HI> which in a few years by the Smile of God; especially upon the Holy Wisdom, Con∣duct and Credit of our Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> upon some Accounts of Growth, came to exceed <HI>Old Boston</HI> in every thing that Renders a Town <HI>Considerable.</HI> And it is Remarkable, that his Arrival at <HI>New-England,</HI> was just after the People there, had been by Solemn <HI>Fasting</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> seeking unto God, that in as much, as they had been en∣gaging to walk with Him in His <HI>Ordinances,</HI> ac∣cording to His <HI>Word,</HI> He would mercyfully send over to them, such as might be <HI>Eyes unto them in the Wilderness,</HI> and strengthen them in Dis∣cerning and Following of that <HI>Word.</HI></P>
<P>§. 20.

The Good <HI>Spirit</HI> of God by that Sermon had a mighty Influence, upon all Ranks of men, in the <HI>Infant-Plantation;</HI> who from this time, carried on their Affairs▪ with a New-Life, Satis∣faction, and Unanimity. It was then, requested of Mr. <HI>Cotton;</HI> that he would, from the <HI>Laws,</HI> where-with God Governed His Ancient People, form an <HI>Abstract</HI> of such as were of a Moral and a Lasting <HI>Equity;</HI> which he performed, as Ac∣ceptably; as Judiciously. But inasmuch as very much or an <HI>Athenian Demacracy,</HI> was in the Mould of the <HI>Government,</HI> by the <HI>Royal Charter,</HI> which was then Acted upon, Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> Effectu∣ally recommended it unto them, that none should be <HI>Electors</HI> nor <HI>Elected</HI> therein, except such as were <HI>Visible Subjects</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ; personally <HI>Confederated</HI> in our Churches. In these, and many other ways, he Propounded unto them, an Endeavour after a <HI>Theocracy,</HI> as near, as might be, to that which was the Glory of <HI>Israel,</HI> the <HI>Peculiar People.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Ecclesiastical Constitution</HI> of the Country, was that on which, he Employ'd his Peculiar Cares; and he was one of those <HI>Olive Trees,</HI> which afforded a Singular measure of <HI>Oyl,</HI> for the Illumination of our <HI>Sanctuary.</HI> Now that the World may know the <HI>First Principles</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> it must be known, That until the <HI>Plat∣form of Church Discipline,</HI> Published by a <HI>Synod</HI> in the year 1648 and Composed (chiefly) by

Disseminate and Dissemble their <HI>Errors;</HI> and because the chief of them in their Private Con∣ferences with him, would make such fallacious <HI>Professions</HI> of <HI>Gospel-Truths,</HI> that his Christian and Abused <HI>Charity,</HI> would not permit him to be so <HI>Hasty,</HI> as many others were, in <HI>Censuring</HI> of them.

certain Scandalous Writer, having Publickly Re∣proached Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> with his former Inclination to <HI>Remove,</HI> there was thereby provoked his Pub∣lick and Patient Answer; which being a Sum∣mary Narrative of this whole Business, I shall here transcribe it.</P>
<P><Q>There was a Generation of <HI>Familists,</HI> in our own and other Towns, who under Pretence of Holding forth, what I had taught, Touching <HI>Union</HI> with Christ, and <HI>Evidencing</HI> that Union, did Secretly vent Sundry and Dangerous Er∣rors and Heresies, denying all <HI>Inherent Righte∣ousness,</HI> and all Evidencing of a <HI>Good Estate</HI> there∣by in any sort, and some of them also Deny∣ing, <HI>the Immortality of the Soul,</HI> and <HI>the Resur∣rection of the Body.</HI> When they were question∣ed by some Brethren about those things, they carried it, as if they had Held forth nothing, but what they had Received from <HI>me:</HI> where∣of, when I was Advised, to cleer my self, I Publickly Preached against those Errors. Then, said the Brethren to the Erring Party, <HI>See, Your Teacher declares himself cleerly to differ from you▪ No matter</HI> (say the other) <HI>what he saith in Pub∣lick, we understand him otherwise, and we know what he saith to us in Private.</HI> Yea, and I my self could not easily Believe that those Er∣ring Brethren and Sisters, were so Corrupt in their Judgments as they were Reported; they seeming to me forward Christians, and utterly
<PB N="39" REF="000724_0071_0FAA44B22CC06FA8"/>
Denying any such Tenants, or any thing else but what they received from my self. All which bred in Sundry of the Country, a Jea∣lousy, that I was in Secret, <HI>A Fomentor of the Spirit of Familism,</HI> if not <HI>Leavened</HI> my self that way. Which I discerning, it wrought in <HI>me,</HI> thoughts (as it did in many other sincerely Godly Brethren of our Church) not of a <HI>Se∣paration</HI> from the Churches, but of a <HI>Removal</HI> to <HI>Newhaven,</HI> as being better known to the Pastor, and some others <HI>there,</HI> than to such as were, at that time Jealouse of me <HI>here.</HI> The true Ground whereof was an <HI>Inward Loathness to be Troublesome unto Godly Minds,</HI> and a Fear of the Unprofitableness of my <HI>Ministry</HI> there, where my <HI>way</HI> was suspected to be Doubtful and Dangerous. I chose therefore rather to meditate a <HI>Silent Departure,</HI> in Peace, than by Tarrying here, to make way for the Breaking forth of <HI>Temptations.</HI> But when, at the <HI>Synod,</HI> I had discovered the Corruption of the Judge∣ment of the <HI>Erring Brethren,</HI> and saw their Fraudulent pretence of Holding forth no other, but what they received from <HI>me</HI> (when as in∣deed they pleaded for Gross Errors contrary un∣to <HI>my</HI> Judgment) I thereupon did bear Witness against them; and when in a private Confe∣rence with some Chief <HI>Magistrates,</HI> and <HI>Elders,</HI> I perceived, that my Removal upon such Diffe∣rences was Unwelcome to them, and that such

the <HI>New-English</HI> Churches, under the Influence of Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> I have sometimes thought much of a piece, with what we have in the Old Histories of <HI>Lysimachus;</HI> That when a <HI>Leprous,</HI> and <HI>Scabby</HI> fort of a People were Driven out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> into the Wilderness, there was a certain man call'd <HI>Moses,</HI> who counselled them to March on in a Body, till they came to some Good Soyl. This <HI>Moses</HI> commanded them to be Kind unto no man; To give <HI>Bad</HI> Advice rather than <HI>Good,</HI> upon all Occasions; and to Destroy as many <HI>Temples</HI> as they could find; So, after much Travail, and Trouble, they came to a <HI>Fruitful Soyl,</HI> where they did all the Mis∣chief that <HI>Moses</HI> had recommended, and built a City, which was, at first, called <HI>Hier<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>syla,</HI> from the spoiling of the <HI>Temples:</HI> but afterwards, to shun the Disgrace of the Occasion, they changed it into <HI>Hierosolyme,</HI> and bore the Name of <HI>Hierosolymitans.</HI> But thus must a <HI>Bad Report,</HI> as well as a <HI>Good Report</HI> follow such a man as Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> whose only Fault af∣ter all, was that, with which, that memora∣ble Ancient <HI>Nazianzen</HI> was taxed sometimes; namely, the Fault of <HI>Mansuetude.</HI></P>

Some Great Persons in <HI>England,</HI> were intending to have sent over a Ship, on purpose to fetch him o∣ver, for the sake of the Service, that such a Man as <HI>He,</HI> might then Do to the Church of God, then, <HI>Travelling</HI> in the Nation. But al∣though their Doubt of his <HI>Willingness to Remove,</HI> caused them to forbear that <HI>Method</HI> of obtain∣ing him, yet the Principal Members in both Houses of <HI>Parliament</HI> Wrote unto him, with an Importunity for his Return into <HI>England;</HI> which had prevailed with him, if the Dismal Showres of <HI>Blood,</HI> quickly after breaking upon the Na∣tion, had not made such Afflictive Impressions upon him, as to prevent his purpose. He continued, therefore, in <HI>Boston,</HI> unto his Dying Day; Counting it a great Favour of Heaven un∣to him, that he was Delivered from, <HI>the Unset∣tledness of Habitation,</HI> which was not among the least of the Calamities, that Exercised the A∣postles of our Lord. <HI>Nineteen Years</HI> and odd Months, he spent in this Place, doing of <HI>Good,</HI> Publickly, and Privately, unto all sorts of men, as it became, <HI>a Good Man, full of Faith, and of the Holy Ghost.</HI> Here in an Expository way, he went over the <HI>Old Testament</HI> once, and a Second Time as far as the Thirtieth Chapter of <HI>Isaiah;</HI> and the whole <HI>New Testament,</HI> once, and a Second time, as far as the Eleventh Chapter to the <HI>He∣brews.</HI>

Upon <HI>Lord's-Dayes,</HI> and <HI>Lecture-Dayes,</HI> he Preached thorow the <HI>Acts of the Apostles;</HI> the Prophesies of <HI>Haggai,</HI> and <HI>Zechariah;</HI> the Books of <HI>Ezra,</HI> the <HI>Revelation, Ecclesiastes, Canticles,</HI> the Second and Third Epistles of <HI>John<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> the Epistle to <HI>Titus,</HI> both Epistles to <HI>Timothy;</HI> the Epistle to the <HI>Romans;</HI> with Innumerable other Scrip∣tures on Incidental Occasions.

About that <HI>Glory of the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> from the <HI>Faith</HI> to the <HI>Sight</HI> whereof, he was now Hastening. After this in that <HI>Study,</HI> which had been <HI>Perfumed</HI> with many such <HI>Dayes</HI> before, he now spent a <HI>Day</HI> in Secret <HI>Humiliations</HI> and <HI>Supplications,</HI> before the Lord; seeking the Special Assistences of the Holy Spirit, for the Great Work of <HI>Dying,</HI> that was now before him.

<HI>Presages</HI> in his Heart, that God would by his Present Sickness, give him <HI>an Entrance into the Everlasting Kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> Wherefore, <HI>Setting his House in Order,</HI> he was now so far from unwilling to Receive the <HI>Mercy-Stroke</HI> of <HI>Death,</HI> as that he was Desirous to be with Him, <HI>With whom to be, is, by far, the Best of All.</HI> And although the chief Ground of his <HI>Readiness</HI> to be <HI>Gone,</HI> was from the unutter∣ably Sweet and Rich <HI>Entertainments,</HI> which he did by <HI>Fore-tast,</HI> as well as by <HI>Promise,</HI> know that the Lord had Reserved in the Heavenly Regions for him, yet he said, it contributed unto this <HI>Readiness</HI> in him, when he consider'd the <HI>Saints,</HI> whose Company and Communion he was Going unto; Particularly <HI>Perlins, Ames, Preston, Hildersham, Dod,</HI> and others, which had been peculiarly Dear unto himself; besides the Rest, in that <HI>General Assembly.</HI></P>

The <HI>Hebrew</HI> he un∣derstood so exactly, and so readily, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was able to <HI>Discourse</HI> in it. In the <HI>Greek,</HI> he was a Cri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick, so Accurate, and so Well-Versed, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he needed not, like <HI>Austin,</HI> to have Studied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in his Reduced Age. Thus, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many of the <HI>An∣cients</HI> committed Gross mistakes, in their <HI>Inter∣pretations</HI> of the Scriptures, through their want skill in the Originals, Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Qualified for an <HI>Interpreter.</HI> He both Wrote Spoke <HI>Latin</HI> also with great Facility; and with most <HI>Ciceroman</HI> Elegancy, Exemplified in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Published Composure. Next, for his <HI>Logic,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was compleatly furnished therewith to Encoun∣ter the Subtilest Adversary of the Truth. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> although he had been Educated in the <HI>Per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> patetick</HI> way, yet like the other <HI>Puritans</HI> of the

times, he rather affected the <HI>Romaean</HI> Discipline; and chose to follow the Methods of that Ex∣cellent <HI>Ramus,</HI> who like <HI>Justin</HI> of old, was not only a <HI>Philosopher,</HI> but a <HI>Christian,</HI> and a <HI>Martyr</HI> also; rather than the more Empty, Trifling, Altercative Notions, to which the Works of the Pagan <HI>A∣ristotle</HI> derived unto us, through the Mangling Hands of the Apostate <HI>Porphyrie,</HI> have Disposed his Disciples. Lastly, for his <HI>Theologie, There</HI> 'twas that he had his Greatest <HI>Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ordinariness,</HI> and most of all, his <HI>Textual Divinity.</HI> His Abilities to Expound the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> caused him to be Ad∣mired by the Ablest of his <HI>Hearers.</HI> Although his Incomparable <HI>Modesty</HI> would not permit him to speak any more than the <HI>Least</HI> of <HI>Himself,</HI> yet unto a private Friend he hath said, <HI>That he knew not of any Difficult Place in all the whole Bible, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had not weighed, somewhat unto Satisfaction.</HI> And hence, though he Ordinarily bestowed much pains upon his <HI>Publick Sermons,</HI> yet he hath some∣times Preached most Admirably, without any Warning at all; and a <HI>New Note</HI> upon a Text <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore him, occurring to his mind, but just as he was going into the Assembly, has taken up his Discourse for that Hour, so Pertinently and Judiciously, that the most Critical of his Auditors, imagined nothing <HI>Extemporaneous.</HI> Indeed his <HI>Library</HI> was vast, and vast was his <HI>Acquaintance</HI> with it; but although amonst his Readings, he had given a Special Room, unto the <HI>Fathers,</HI> and

If <HI>Erasmus,</HI> when offered a Bishoprick to Write against <HI>Luther</HI> could answer, <HI>There was more Divinity in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of</HI> Luther, <HI>than in all</HI> Thomas Aquinas; T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no wonder that <HI>Salmasius</HI> could so Venera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Calvin,</HI> as to say, <HI>That he had rather be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Author of that One Book, The Institutions written by</HI> Calvin, <HI>than have written all that was ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> done by</HI> Gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.

that Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> would say, Mr. Cotton <HI>Preaches with such Authority; Demonstration, and of Life, that methinks, when he Preaches out of any Prophet, or A∣postle, I hear not him; I hear that very Prophet &amp; Apostle; yea, I hear the Lord Jesus Christ Himself speaking in my Heart.</HI> And the <HI>Success</HI> which God gave to these <HI>Plain Labours,</HI> of His Faith∣ful, Humble, Deligent Servant, was beyond what most Ministers in the Country ever did Experience; There have been Few that have seen so many and mighty Effects, given to the <HI>Travels of their Souls.</HI></P>

much Abroad; but he judged Ordinarily that more Benefit was obtain'd, according to the Ad∣vice of the Wise King, by conversing with the <HI>Dead</HI> [in <HI>Books</HI>] than with the <HI>Living</HI> [in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alks:</HI>] and that <HI>Needless Visits</HI> do commonly Unframe our <HI>Spirits,</HI> and perhaps disturb our <HI>Comforts.</HI> He was an <HI>Early Riser,</HI> taking the <HI>Morning</HI> for the <HI>Muses;</HI> and in his Latter Dayes forbearing a <HI>Supper,</HI> he turn'd his former <HI>Supping-Time,</HI> into a <HI>Reading,</HI> a <HI>Thinking,</HI> a <HI>Praying</HI>-Time. <HI>Twelve-Hours</HI> in a Day he commonly Studied, and would call that, <HI>A Scholars-Day;</HI> resolving to wear out rather with <HI>Using,</HI> than with <HI>Rusting.</HI> In Truth, had he not been of an Healthy and Hearty Constitution, and had he not made a Careful though not Curious <HI>Diet</HI> serve him, in∣stead of an <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> his <HI>continued Labour</HI> must have made his <HI>Life,</HI> as well as his <HI>Labour,</HI> to have been but of a <HI>Short</HI> Continuance. And, indeed, the Work which lay upon him, could not have been performed, without a <HI>Labour</HI> more than Ordinary: For besides his constant Preach∣ing more than Once, every Week, many <HI>Cases</HI> were brought unto him far and near, in Resol∣ving whereof, as he took much <HI>Time,</HI> so he did much <HI>Good:</HI> being a most Excellent <HI>Casuist.</HI> He was likewise very Deeply concerned in Peace∣able and Effectual Disquisitions of the Contro∣versies about <HI>Church-Government,</HI> then Agitated in the Church of God. And though he chiefly

gave himself to <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Exhor∣tation,</HI> depending much on the <HI>Ruling Elders</HI> to Inform him, concerning the State of his <HI>Particu∣lar Flock,</HI> that he might the Better Order him∣self in <HI>the Word and Prayer,</HI> yet he found his <HI>Church-Work,</HI> in this Regard also, to call for no little Painfulness, Watchfulness, and Faithfulness.</P>

He was One so <HI>Clothed with Humi∣lity,</HI> that according to the Emphasis of the Apo∣stolical Direction, by this <HI>Livery</HI> his Relation as a <HI>Disciple</HI> to the <HI>Lowly Jesus,</HI> was notably dis∣covered; and hence he was <HI>Patient</HI> and <HI>Peacea∣ble,</HI> even to a Proverb. He had a more than Common Excellency in that <HI>Cool Spirit,</HI> which the Oracles of Wisdom describe as, <HI>The Excel∣lent Spirit in the Man of Understanding;</HI> and there∣fore Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> would parallel him, with <HI>Moses</HI> among the <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> with <HI>Melancthon</HI> among the <HI>Reformers.</HI> He was rather Excessive, than Defective in <HI>Self-Denial,</HI> and had the <HI>Nimia Humilitas,</HI> which <HI>Luther</HI> sometimes blamed in <HI>Staupicius:</HI> yea, he was, at last, himself sensible that some fell very Deep into the Sin of <HI>Corah,</HI> through his Extreme <HI>Forbearance,</HI> in matters re∣lating to his own <HI>Just Rights</HI> in the Church of God.

Once particularly, an Humourous and Imperious Brother, following Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> home to his House, after his Publick Labours, instead of the Grateful Respects with which these Holy Labours, were to have been encouraged, Rudely told him, that his Ministry was become Generally, either <HI>Dark,</HI> or <HI>Flat:</HI> whereto this Meek man, very mildely and gravely, made only this Answer, <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th, Bro∣ther, it may be, both; Let me have your Prayers that it may be otherwise!</HI> But it is Remarkable, that the Man <HI>Sick</HI> thus, of <HI>Wanton Singularities,</HI> afterwards <HI>Dyed</HI> of those <HI>Damnable Heresies,</HI> for which he was deservedly Excommunicated Another time, when Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> had modestly Replyed unto one that would much Talk and Crack of his Insight into the <HI>Revelations; Brother I must confess my self to want Light in those Mysteries</HI> the man went home, and sent him <HI>A Pound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Candles;</HI> upon which Action, this Good Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bestowed only a Silent Smile; he would not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Becon</HI> of his Great Soul on <HI>Fire,</HI> at the Lan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing

of such a Little Cock-boat. He Learned the Lesson of <HI>Gregory, It is better, many times, to fly from an Injury by silence, than to overcome it by Re∣plying;</HI> and he used that Practice of <HI>Grynaeus, To Revenge Wrongs, by Christian Taciturinty.</HI> And it may pass for a Branch of the same Temper in him, That he extremely hated all <HI>Allotri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Episco∣pacy,</HI> and though he knew, as practically, as most men in the World, <HI>That we have a Call to do Good, as often as we have Power &amp; Occasion,</HI> yet he was very Slow of Apprehending any <HI>Occasion</HI> of meddling <HI>At all,</HI> though he might have had never so much <HI>Power</HI> to meddle <HI>For Good,</HI> any where but within the <HI>Sphere</HI> of his own proper <HI>Calling.</HI> As he understood that <HI>Leontius</HI> blamed <HI>Constantine,</HI> for Interposing too far in <HI>Ecclesiastical Affairs,</HI> thus Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> on the Other side had a Great Aversion from Engaging in any <HI>Civil</HI> Ones; he would Religiously Decline taking into his Cognisance all <HI>Civil</HI> Controversies or Um∣pirages, and whatever Looked <HI>Heteroge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ous</HI> to the Calling of One, whose whole Business 'twas, <HI>To Feed the Flock of God.</HI> Nevertheless in the Things of God, of Christ, of Conscience, his <HI>Condesending Temper</HI> did not hinder him, from he most <HI>Immoveable Resolution.</HI> He would not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Follow Peace with all men,</HI> as to abandon or rejudice, one Jot, the Interests of <HI>Holiness.</HI></P>

particularly Observable in his Government of his <HI>Family,</HI> where he would never Correct any thing in a <HI>Passion;</HI> but, first, with much Deliberation show what Rule, in the Holy Word of God, had been Violated, by the Fault lately committed. He was, indeed, one that <HI>Ruled well his own House!</HI> He therein Morning and Evening, Read a <HI>Chap∣ter,</HI> with a Little Applicatory <HI>Exposition,</HI> before and after which, he made a <HI>Prayer;</HI> but he was very <HI>Short</HI> in all, accounting as Mr. <HI>Dod,</HI> Mr. <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins,</HI> and other great Sainte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>id before him, <HI>That it was a Thing inconvenient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wayes to be Tedious in Family Duties.</HI> He also <HI>Read</HI> constantly a Portion of the Scripture alone, and he <HI>Prayed</HI> over what he <HI>Read; Pray'd,</HI> I say; For he was very much in <HI>Prayer,</HI> a very <HI>Man of Prayer;</HI> he would rarely sit down to Study; without a <HI>Prayer</HI> over it, referring to the Presence of God, accompanying what he did. It was the Advice of the Ancient, <HI>Si vis esse Semper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Sem∣per Ora, Semper Lege;</HI> and agreeably hereunto, Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> might say with <HI>David, Lord, I am still with Thee!</HI> But he that was <HI>with God,</HI> all the Week, was more Intimately <HI>with Him,</HI> on His <HI>Own Day,</HI> the Chief Day of the <HI>Week;</HI> which he Observed most Conscientiously.

and Practice, that the Christians of <HI>New-England</HI> have Generally done so too. When that <HI>Even∣ing</HI> arriv'd, he was usually Larger in his <HI>Expo∣sition</HI> in his Family, than at other times; He then <HI>Catechised</HI> his Children and Servants, and <HI>Prayed</HI> with them, and <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng</HI> a Psalm; from thence he Retired unto <HI>Study,</HI> and Secret <HI>Prayer,</HI> till the Time of his going unto his Repose.

<P>§. 31. Without <HI>Liberality</HI> and <HI>Hospitality,</HI> he had been Really as <HI>Underserving</HI> of the Character of <HI>a Minister of the Gospel,</HI> as the <HI>Sa∣crilegious Niggardliness</HI> of the People dos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> often endeavour to make Ministers <HI>Uncapable</HI> of answer∣ing that Character. But Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> was most Exemplary for this Virtue; wherein there are of his <HI>Children,</HI> that have also Learned of him. The Stranger and the Needy were still Enter∣tained at his Table, <HI>Episcopaliter &amp; Benigne,</HI> as was the Phrase Instructively used for a, <HI>Cha∣ritable Entertainment,</HI> of old. It might be said of him, as once it was of the Generous Cor∣inthian, <HI>Semper Aliquis in</HI> Cottoni <HI>Domo,</HI> He was ever Shewing of Kindness to Some-body or o∣ther. What <HI>Posidonius</HI> relates of <HI>Austin,</HI> and what <HI>Peter Martyr</HI> affirms of <HI>Bucer,</HI> was very true of our <HI>Cotton; His House was like an Inn, for the Constant Entertainment, which he gave upon the Account of the Gospel;</HI> and he would say, <HI>If a man want an Heart for this Charity, it is not fit, such a Man should be Ordained a Minister:</HI> con∣senting

therein to the Great Canonist, <HI>Hospitali∣tas usque adeo Episcopis est Necessaria, at si ab ea inveniantur alieni, Jure prohibentur Ordinari.</HI> While he lived Quietly in <HI>England,</HI> he was noted for his Bountiful Disposition; especially towards Mi∣nisters driven into <HI>England,</HI> by the Storms of Persecution then Raging in <HI>Germany;</HI> for which cause <HI>Libingus, Saumer, Tolner,</HI> and others of the <HI>Germane Sufferers,</HI> in their Accounts of him, would Style him, <HI>Fautor Doctissimus, Cla∣rissimus, Fidelissimas, plarimumque Honorandus.</HI> It was Remarked, that he never omitted Inviting unto his House any Minister Travelling to or through the Town, but only that <HI>One</HI> man, who perfidiously Betray'd Mr. <HI>Hildersham,</HI> with his <HI>Non Conformist</HI> Associates, into the Hands of their Enemies.

indeed, say, what they Report of <HI>Hilary,</HI> that <HI>Serpents were not able to Look upon him;</HI> neverthe∣less it was commonly Observed, that the worser sort of <HI>Serpents,</HI> would from the awe of his Pre∣sence keep in their <HI>Poisons.</HI> As the Keeper of the <HI>Inn,</HI> where <HI>he</HI> did use to Lodge, when he came to <HI>Derby,</HI> would profanely say to his <HI>Com∣panions,</HI> That he Wished Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> were gone out of his House, for, <HI>he was not able to Swear white that man was under his Roof:</HI> So, other wicked Persons could not show their Wickedness, whilest this <HI>Holy</HI> and <HI>Righteous</HI> man was in the Company.

Tang, Reader, 'Twas none of Mr. <HI>Cottons;</HI> Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> was Troubled when he saw such a Passage, in an Imperfect Copy of his Writings, exposed unto the World, under his <HI>Name,</HI> against his <HI>Will:</HI> and he took an Opportunity, in the most Publick manner, to Declare as much unto the World. He was also sometimes put upon Writ∣ing yet more <HI>Polemically.</HI> Indeed there was one Occasion of so Writing, which he Declined med∣dling withal; and that was this. Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> having in his Younger years, Written to a Pri∣vate Friend some Things, tending (at his Desire) to Clear the Doctrine of <HI>Reprobation,</HI> from the Exceptions of the <HI>Arminians;</HI> and this Manus∣cript falling into Dr. <HI>Twiss's</HI> Hand, that Learned man Published it, with his own Confutation of certain Passages in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which did not agree so well with the Doctor's own <HI>Supralapsarian Scheme.</HI> Now, when Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> saw himself Reviled for this Cause by <HI>Baily,</HI> as being a <HI>Pelagian,</HI> he only made this meek Reply; <HI>I hope God will give me Opportunity e're long to Consider of this, the Doctors Labour of Love. I Bless the Lord, who has taught me to be willing to be Taught, of a far meaner Dis∣criple, than such a Doctor, whose Scholastical Acuteness, Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gnancy of Wit, Solidity of Judgment, and Dexte∣rity of Argument, all Orthodox Divines do Highly Honour, and whom all Arminians and Jesuites do sall down before, with Silence.

Only I desire I may not be Condemned as a Pelagian or Arminian before I he heard.</HI> Moreover, Mr. <HI>Cawdry</HI> fell hard upon him; to whom he prepa∣red an Answer, which was afterwards Published and Seconded by Dr. <HI>Owen.</HI> But besides these, he was twice compelled unto some other <HI>Eristical</HI> Writings: Once in <HI>Answer</HI> to <HI>Baily;</HI> another time in <HI>Answer</HI> to <HI>Williams:</HI> In both of which, like <HI>Job,</HI> he <HI>Turned the Books, which his Adversaries had written against him, into a Crown.</HI> I believe, never any meer Man, under such open and hor∣rid Injuries as these two <HI>Reporters</HI> heaped upon Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> did <HI>Answer</HI> with more Christian <HI>Pa∣tience;</HI> his <HI>Answer</HI> are indeed a Pattern for all <HI>Answerers</HI> to the World's End. But it was par∣ticularly remarkable, that, in this matter, certain Persons, who had fallen under the <HI>Censures</HI> of the Civil Authority in the Country, Singled out Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> for the Object of their Displeasure, although <HI>he</HI> had, <HI>most, of all men,</HI> declined Inter∣esting himself in the Actions of the Magistrate, and had also done <HI>more than all men</HI> to obtain Healing and Favour for those ungrateful Delin∣quents. However if Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> would from his own profitable Experience, have added Another Book unto this Catalogue, it might have been on the Subject Handled by <HI>Plutarch De Capienda ex Hostibus Utilitate.</HI> This is the <HI>Elenchus</HI> of Mr. <HI>Cottons</HI> Published Writings; whereupon we might make this Conclusion.</P>

<P><HI>These</HI> were some of the Lines, which the Renowned <HI>Bulkly,</HI> justly wept upon his Grave. Yea, we may, on as many Accounts as <HI>These Dayes</HI> will allow, Reckon him to have been a <HI>Prophet of the Lord:</HI> and when we have Entertain'd ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> selves with a Memorable Demonstration of <HI>it,</HI> in One Surprising and Stupendous Article of our <HI>Church History,</HI> we will put a Period unto <HI>This part</HI> of it.</P>
<P>At the Time, when some unhappy Persons were just going from hence to <HI>England,</HI> with cer∣tain <HI>Petitions,</HI> which had a Tendency to Disturb
<PB N="71" REF="000724_0103_0FAA4747A46D9B78"/>
the Good Order of Things in both <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> then settling among us, Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> in the Ordinary Course of his Lectures on the <HI>Canticles,</HI> Preached on Cant 2. 15. <HI>Take us the Foxes, the Little Foxes, which Destroy the Vines.</HI> Having thence ob∣served, <HI>That when God has Delivered his Church from the Dangers of the Persecuting Bear &amp; Lyon, then there were Foxes that would seek by Policy to Under∣mine it;</HI> and, <HI>That all those who Go by a Fox like Policy to Undermine the Churches of the Lord Jesus Christ, shall be taken &amp; overtaken by his Judgments;</HI> he came at Length to his <HI>Application,</HI> where with a more than Ordinary Majesty, and Fervency, he after This manner, expressed himself.</P>
<P><Q>First, Let such as <HI>Live</HI> in this Country Take Heed, how they go about in any Indirect Way or Course to Prejudice the <HI>Churches</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ in the Land, or the <HI>Government</HI> of the Land. If you <HI>Do,</HI> The <HI>Keeper of Israel, who neither Slumbereth nor Sleepeth,</HI> will not Take it well at your Hands. He that brought this Peo∣ple hither, and preserved them from the Rage of <HI>Persecution,</HI> and made this Wilderness an <HI>Hiding∣place</HI> for them, whilst he was Chastising our Nation, with the other Nations round about it, and has manifested his <HI>Gracious Presence</HI> in the midst of these His <HI>Golden Candlesticks,</HI> and secured us from the Plots of the Late <HI>Arch Bishop,</HI> and his Confederates abroad, and from the Plots of the <HI>Heathen</HI> here at home; there is no Question
<PB N="72" REF="000724_0104_0FAA47488C869E88"/>
but <HI>He</HI> will Defend us from the Underminings of <HI>False Brethren,</HI> and such as are Joined with them. Wherefore, let such know, That this is, in many Respects <HI>Immanuels</HI> Land, and they shall not Prosper that Rise up against it, but shall be <HI>Taken every One of them</HI> in the Snares they lay for it. This I speak <HI>as a Poor Prophet of the Lord, according to the Word of His Grace now Be∣fore us!</HI> But in the Second Place, whereas ma∣ny of our Brethren are Going to <HI>England,</HI> Let me Direct a Word unto <HI>Them</HI> also. I desire the Gracious Presence of our God may Go with you, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is <HI>Angels</HI> Guard you, not only from the <HI>Dangers</HI> of the <HI>Seas,</HI> while you are thereupon, but also from the <HI>Errors</HI> of the <HI>Times,</HI> when you arrive. Nevertheless, If there be any among you, my Brethren, as tis Reported there <HI>are,</HI> that have a <HI>Petition</HI> to prefer unto the <HI>High Court of Parliament,</HI> that may Conduce to the Distracti∣on and Annoyance of the Peace of our <HI>Churches,</HI> and the Weakning the <HI>Government</HI> of the Land where we Live, Let <HI>Such</HI> Know, the Lord will never Suffer them to Prosper, in their Subtil, Malicious, Desperate Undertakings against His People, who are as Tender unto Him as the <HI>Apple of His Eye.</HI> But if there be any such among <HI>You,</HI> who are to <HI>Go,</HI> I do exhort you, and I would advise you, in the Fear of God, that when the Terrors of the Almighty shall Beset the <HI>Vessel</HI> wherein you are, when the Heavens shall frown
<PB N="73" REF="000724_0105_0FAA474922E69DB8"/>
upon you, and the Billowes of the <HI>Sea,</HI> shall swell above you, and the Dangers of <HI>Death</HI> shall Threaten you, <HI>as I am verily perswaded they will,</HI> I would have you then to <HI>Consider your Wayes.</HI> I will not give the Counsel, that was taken con∣cerning <HI>Jonas,</HI> to cast such a Person into the Sea; God forbid! But I Counsel such to come then unto a Resolution in themselves to <HI>Desist</HI> from their Enterprises, and <HI>Cast their Petitions into the Sea.</HI> It may be, that Hardness of Heart, and Stoutness of Spirit may cause you to Persist, and yet in Mercy to some Gracious Persons a∣mong you, the Lord may Deliver the <HI>Ship</HI> from <HI>Utter Destruction</HI> for <HI>their</HI> sakes. But the Lord hath further Judgments in Store; He is the God of the <HI>Land,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Sea.</HI> I speak this also, <HI>as an unworthy Prophet of the Lord!</HI></Q></P>
<P>These Things were then uttered by a Person, that was as Little of an <HI>Enthusiast,</HI> as most men in the World. Now attend the Event!</P>
<P>That <HI>Ship,</HI> after many Stresses of Weather in the <HI>Harbour,</HI> puts out to Sea; but at Sea, it had the Terriblest <HI>Passage,</HI> perhaps, that ever was Heard of; The Marriners not being able to take any <HI>Observation</HI> of either <HI>Sun</HI> or <HI>Star,</HI> for Seven Hun∣dred Leagues together. Certain Well Disposed Persons aboard, now Calling to Mind the Words of Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> thought it necessary to Admonish the Persons, who were carrying over their Malig∣nant <HI>Papers</HI> against the Country; and <HI>some</HI> of those
<PB N="74" REF="000724_0106_0FAA4749E01F0D90"/>
Papers were by them, thereupon Given to the <HI>Sea-men,</HI> who immediately cut them in Pieces, and threw them over board. The <HI>Storm</HI> forthwith Abated; however there afterwards, came up <HI>New Storms,</HI> which at last Hurried the Ship a∣mongst the Rocks, of <HI>Silly;</HI> where they yet Re∣ceived a Deliverance, which most of them that Consider'd it, pronounced <HI>Miraculous.</HI> When the Rude <HI>Cornish</HI> men saw how Miraculously the Ves∣sel had escaped, they said, <HI>God was a Good Man to Save them So!</HI> But the more Instructed and Obliged Passengers, kept a Day of Solemn <HI>Thanks∣giving</HI> to God; in which, even the Profanest Persons on Board, under the Impression of what had Happened, then bore a part. However, the <HI>Corn-fields</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> still stood Undisturb∣ed, notwithstanding the Various <HI>Names</HI> Affixed unto the <HI>Tailes</HI> of <HI>Petitions</HI> against their <HI>Liberties.</HI> For, as Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> Elegantly expressed it, <HI>God then R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cqued Three Nations, with Shaking Dispensations, that He might procure some Rest unto His People, in this Wilderness!</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF Mr. JOHN NORTON.</HEAD>
<P>§. 1. THERE was a Famous JOHN whose <HI>Atchievements</HI> are by our Lord <HI>Emblazoned</HI> in those Terms; <HI>He was a Burning and a Shining Light.</HI> In the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> of Old, erected by the Order and for the Worship, of God, there were those Two Things, A <HI>Candlestick,</HI> and an <HI>Altar;</HI> in the One a <HI>Light,</HI> that might never Go out, in the Other a <HI>Fire,</HI> that might never be Extinguish∣ed; and yet such an Affinity between these that there was a <HI>Fire</HI> in the <HI>Light</HI> of the One, and a <HI>Light</HI> in the <HI>Fire</HI> of the other. Such a Mixture of both <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> should be in Those, that
<PB N="2" REF="000724_0114_0FAA4752695DDFD0"/>
are employed about the Service of the <HI>Tabernacle:</HI> And though the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> erected for our Lord in this Wilderness, had many such <HI>Burning and Shining Lights;</HI> vet among the <HI>Chief</HI> of them is to be Reckoned, that <HI>JOHN</HI> which we had in our Blessed NORTON.</P>
<P>§. 2. He was Born, the Sixth of <HI>May</HI> 1605. at <HI>Starford</HI> in <HI>Hartfordshire;</HI> descended of Ho∣nourable Ancestors. In his Early Childhood he discovered a Ripeness of Wit, which gave just Hopes of his proving <HI>Extraordinary:</HI> and under Mr. <HI>Strange</HI> in the School of <HI>Bunningford,</HI> he made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Proficiency, that he could betimes Write Good <HI>Latin,</HI> with a more than common Elegancie and Invention. At <HI>Fourteen</HI> years of Age, being sent unto <HI>Peter-house,</HI> he staid there, till after his taking of his <HI>First Degree;</HI> where a <HI>Romish</HI> Emissary, taking a curious and exact Observation of his Notable Accomplishments, used all the Me∣thods he could think of, to have seduced him over unto the <HI>Romish</HI> Irreligion: but God intending him to be a <HI>Pillar</HI> in His own <HI>Temple,</HI> Mercifully pre∣vented his Hearkening unto any Temptations to become a <HI>Support</HI> unto the Tower of <HI>Babel.</HI></P>
<P>§. 3. In his <HI>Youth,</HI> he was Accustomed unto some <HI>Youthful Vanities;</HI> especially unto <HI>Card-Play∣ing;</HI> an Evil which he did first <HI>Ponder</HI> and <HI>Re∣form</HI> upon a Serious Admonition, which a <HI>Servant</HI> of his Father's gave unto him. When he came to Consider that a <HI>Lot,</HI> is a <HI>Solemn Appeal</HI> unto the
<PB N="3" REF="000724_0115_0FAA475512CBDBF0"/>
God of Heaven, and even by the Rudest Gen∣tiles counted a <HI>Sacred Thing,</HI> he thought that <HI>Play∣ing</HI> with it, was a Breach of the <HI>Third Command∣ment</HI> in the Laws of our God; It should be used, he thought, rather <HI>Prayerfully,</HI> than <HI>Sportfully.</HI> He considered, that the <HI>Papists</HI> themselves do not al∣low these <HI>Games</HI> in <HI>Ecclesiastical Persons,</HI> and the <HI>Fathers</HI> do Reprove them with a Vehement Zeal in <HI>all sorts of Persons.</HI> He considered, that when the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire became a <HI>Christian,</HI> severe <HI>E∣dicts</HI> were made against these <HI>Games,</HI> and that our Protestant <HI>Reformers</HI> have Branded them with an Infamous Character; Wherefore Inclining now to follow <HI>Whatsoever Things are of a Good Report,</HI> he would no longer meddle with <HI>Games</HI> that had so much of a <HI>Scandal</HI> in them.</P>
<P>§. 4. An Extreme Disaster befalling his Fa∣thers Estate, he left the <HI>University;</HI> and became at once <HI>Usher</HI> to the School, and <HI>Curate</HI> in the Church, at <HI>Starford:</HI> Where a <HI>Lecture</HI> being men∣tained by a Combination of several Godly and Able Ministers, he, on that Occasion, fell into Acquaintance with several of them; especially Mr. <HI>Jeremiah Dyke</HI> of <HI>Epping,</HI> by whose Ministery the Holy Spirit of God, gave him a Discovery of his own Manifold Sinfulness and Wretchedness in an <HI>Unregenerate State,</HI> and Awakened him unto such a <HI>Self-Examination,</HI> as Drove him to a <HI>Sor∣row</HI> little short of <HI>Despair:</HI> but after some, time,
<PB N="4" REF="000724_0116_0FAA4755F75C0328"/>
the same Holy Spirit, enabled him to Receive the <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> tendered in the <HI>Promises of</HI> the <HI>Gospel,</HI> with an <HI>Unspeakable Consolation.</HI> Where upon he thought himself concerned in that Ad∣vice of Heaven, <HI>When thou art Converted, Strengthen thy Brethren!</HI></P>
<P>§. 5. Having before This, been well Studi∣ed in the <HI>Tongues</HI> and <HI>Arts,</HI> he was the better fit∣ted for the Higher Studies of <HI>Divinity;</HI> whereto he now wholly Addicted himself: And being in his own Happy Experience Acquainted with <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> and <HI>Holiness,</HI> he did from that Experience now make <HI>Lively Sermons</HI> on those points unto his Hearers. He soon grew Eminent in his Ministry; setting off the Truths he Deliver'd, not only with such <HI>Ornaments</HI> of <HI>Laconic</HI> and Well contrived Expression, as made him worthy to be called, <HI>The Master of Sentences,</HI> but also with such <HI>Experimental Passages</HI> of Devo∣tion, as made him Admired, for <HI>A Preacher seek∣ing out Acceptable Words.</HI></P>
<P>§. 6. His Accomplishments Render'd him, as capable of <HI>Preferments,</HI> as most in his Age; but <HI>Preferments</HI> were then so Glogg'd, with Trouble∣some and Scruplesome <HI>Impositions,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> as well as other Conscientious Young Ministers, his Contemporaries, declined medling with them His <HI>Aversion,</HI> and indeed <HI>Antipathy,</HI> to <HI>Arminianism,</HI> and his Dislike of the <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> particularly hin∣dered
<PB N="5" REF="000724_0117_0FAA47577AF05160"/>
him from a Considerable Benefice, where∣to his Unkle might have helped him. Dr. <HI>Sibs</HI> also, the Master of <HI>Katharine Hall</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> taken with his Abilities, did earnestly Sollicite him, to have Accepted of a <HI>Fellowship</HI> in that, Colledge; but his Conscience being now Satisfied in the <HI>Unlawfulness</HI> of some Things then Requir∣ed in Order thereunto, would not permit him to do it. Wherefore he contented himself with a more Private Life, as Chaplain in a Knights House at <HI>High-Laver</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> namely Sir <HI>William Masham's;</HI> there waiting, till God might furnish, him with <HI>Unexceptionable Opportunities,</HI> for his more Publick Preaching of the Gospel. But ge∣nerally, all those who had any Tast of his Mini∣stry, had a very high Opinion of it; nor was there any man in that part of the Country more esteemed than <HI>he</HI> was, for all sorts of Excellencies; insomuch, that when he came away, an Ancient Minister said, <HI>He Believed there was not more Grace and Holiness left in all</HI> Essex, <HI>than what</HI> Mr. Norton, <HI>had carried with him.</HI></P>
<P>§. 7. His Natural Temper had a Tincture of <HI>Choler</HI> in it; but as the Sowrest and Harshest <HI>Fruits</HI> become the most <HI>Pleasant,</HI> when tempered with a due Proportion of <HI>Sweetness</HI> added there∣unto, so the <HI>Grace</HI> of God <HI>Sweetned</HI> the Dispositi∣on of this Good Man, into a most Affable, Cour∣teous, and Complaisant Behaviour, which render'd
<PB N="6" REF="000724_0118_0FAA47585DABB7E8"/>
him exceeding <HI>Amiable.</HI> Indeed when the Apo∣stle speaks of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Body,</HI> being <HI>Sanctified,</HI> some do by <HI>Spirit</HI> Understand the Na∣tural <HI>Temper,</HI> or <HI>Humour;</HI> and accordingly the <HI>Spirit</HI> of this <HI>Quick</HI> Man being <HI>Sanctified,</HI> he be∣came a Man of an <HI>Excellent Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>§. 8. Vast was the Treasure of <HI>Learning</HI> in this Reverend Man. He was not only a most Accurate <HI>Grammarian,</HI> which is abundantly mani∣fested by his Printed Works in Diverse Languages; but an Universal <HI>Scholar:</HI> nevertheless, 'twas as a <HI>School man</HI> that he show'd himself the most of a <HI>Scholar.</HI> He accounted that the Excellency of a <HI>Scholar,</HI> lay more in <HI>Distinctness of Judgment,</HI> than in <HI>Elegancy</HI> of <HI>Language;</HI> and therefore, though he had a neater Style than most other men, yet he was Desirous to furnish himself <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugnam,</HI> rather than, <HI>ad pompam.</HI> Hence having Intimately Acquainted himself with the <HI>Subtleties</HI> of <HI>Scholastic Divinity,</HI> he made all to Illustrate the, <HI>Doctrine of Christ and of Grace,</HI> unto which he made all the Spoils of the <HI>Schools</HI> gloriously Sub∣servient. He was a most Elegant Preacher, and the True Follower of Dr. <HI>Sibs!</HI></P>
<P>§. 9. But let his <HI>Excellencies</HI> have been what they will, there was in those Dayes a <HI>Set of Men,</HI> Resolved that the Church of God should Lose the Benefit of all those Excellencies, except the
<PB N="7" REF="000724_0119_0FAA4758EB088E48"/>
Person which had them, could comply with cer∣tain Uninstituted <HI>Rites</HI> in the Worship of God; which <HI>Our Mr. Norton</HI> could not; and it was <HI>That</HI> which made him <HI>Ours. This</HI> Drove him to the Remote Regions of <HI>America,</HI> where he <HI>hoped,</HI> as well he <HI>might,</HI> that there would never be done so <HI>Unreasonable</HI> a Thing, as to ob∣struct that <HI>Evangelical Worship</HI> of Our Lord Jesus Christ, for the sake <HI>whereof,</HI> those Regions have been added unto the <HI>English Dominions.</HI> Where∣fore in the year 1634. Having Married a Gen∣tle woman both of Good Estate, and of Good Esteem, he took Shipping for <HI>New-England;</HI> accompanied in the same Ship with the Famous Mr. <HI>Thomas Shepard.</HI></P>
<P>§. 10. In the Road betwixt <HI>Harwich</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> he very narrowly escaped a Terrible. Shipwrack: for by the Venemency of a Storm, all their Anchors gave way, so that they were Driven within a Cables Length of the <HI>Sands;</HI> but yet the <HI>Anchor</HI> of their <HI>Hope</HI> in God, held fast unto the <HI>Last.</HI> Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI> having taken the <HI>Mariners</HI> above Decks, Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> took the <HI>Passengers</HI> between Decks, and each of them with their Company, applyed themselves unto Fervent Prayer, whereto the Almighty God gave a present Answer in their Wonderful Deliverance. After this Tempest, which Disappointed their Voyage to <HI>New England</HI> for that Season, Mr.
<PB N="8" REF="000724_0120_0FAA4759B5424ED0"/>
<HI>Norton</HI> Returned unto his Friends in <HI>Essex;</HI> where Mr. <HI>Dyke</HI> welcomed him, as One come from the Dead, professing to him, <HI>That he would have given many Pounds for such a Tryal of his Faith, as this his Friend had newly met withal.</HI></P>
<P>§. 11. The next year Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> Renew∣ed his Voyage to <HI>New-England;</HI> but intervening Accidents made it very late in the year, before he could begin the Voyage: and so, coming upon the <HI>American</HI> Coast in the Month of <HI>October,</HI> they encountred with Another very Terrible Storm, which lasted Eight and fourty Hours, with Great Extremity, and had broken the Vessel to pieces, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it had not had a Strength more than Ordinary. One Wave remarkably washed some of the <HI>Sea-men</HI> overboard on one side and then threw them in again on 'tother; and so Ve∣hement was the Storm, that they were forced at Length to undergird the Ship with the <HI>Cable,</HI> that they might keep her sides together. But within Ten Dayes after this, they were brought safe into <HI>Plymouth</HI> Harbour.</P>
<P>§. 12. There had been some Overtures be∣tween him, and Mr. <HI>Winslow,</HI> the Agent of <HI>Ply∣mouth</HI> now on board with him, about his Accept∣ing of a Settlement in that Plantation; and the People of <HI>Plymouth</HI> now Courteously and Earnest∣ly Invited him, accordingly to continue with them.
<PB N="9" REF="000724_0121_0FAA475A6E452760"/>
Nevertheless the State of Things in the <HI>Massachu∣set</HI> Colony, was more agreeable unto him; and the Church of <HI>Ipswich</HI> made their speedy Appli∣cations unto him, to take the Pastoral charge of <HI>them.</HI> This Occasioned his Deliberation, with his Friends in the <HI>Bay,</HI> What Course to Steer.</P>
<P>§. 13. While he Sojourned in his Unsettled State at <HI>Boston,</HI> he came into Acquaintance with the <HI>Ministers</HI> thereabouts, who entertained him with a very high Opinion of him; especially Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> of <HI>Dorchester,</HI> who though of longer standing than <HI>he,</HI> yet consulted him as an <HI>Oracle,</HI> in matters of greatest Consequence unto him; and found him to Accomplished and Experienced a Person, that he mentained a most Valuable <HI>Friendship</HI> with him to the Last. Yea, though he were yet a Young man, and short of <HI>Thirty,</HI> when he first came into the Country, yet the <HI>Magistrates</HI> of the Colony soon became so sensible of his Abilities, as to make use of him in some of their most arduous Affairs. And there happened se∣veral Occasions to try the <HI>Scholastic</HI> Emmencies, whereto he was Arrived; One of which was, when there was in these parts a <HI>French Friar,</HI> who found in Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> a Protestant, equal to his own <HI>School-men,</HI> and well Acquainted with them all. Indeed there was in him the Union of <HI>two Excellencies,</HI> which do not always meet. It was the Character of <HI>Hortensies,</HI> that he was
<PB N="10" REF="000724_0122_0FAA475B488A9D70"/>
Weak in <HI>Writing,</HI> and yet able to <HI>Speak;</HI> It was the Character of <HI>Abericus,</HI> that he was Weak in <HI>Speach,</HI> and yet Able in <HI>Writing;</HI> but our <HI>Norton</HI> was in both of these a very <HI>Able</HI> Person.</P>
<P>§. 14. It was the Church of <HI>Ipswich,</HI> that our Lord gave so Rich a Thing, as His Eminent Servant <HI>Norton:</HI> but besides the constant La∣bours of his Holy and Fruitful Man, in that <HI>Par∣ticular Church,</HI> he there did several great Services of a more Extensive Influence to the <HI>whole Church</HI> of God; whereof One was <HI>This, Guiliel∣mus Apollonii,</HI> at the Direction of the Divines in <HI>Zealand,</HI> in the year 1644. Sent over to <HI>New-England</HI> a Number of Questions, relating to our Way of <HI>Church-Government;</HI> whereto the Mini∣sters of <HI>New-England</HI> unanimously imposed upon Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> the Task of Drawing up an Answer; which he finished in the year 1645. And it was, I suppose, the first <HI>Latin Book</HI> that ever was Written in this Country. What satisfaction it gave, may be gathered, not only from the At∣testations of Dr. <HI>Goodwyn,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nye,</HI> Mr. <HI>Sympson,</HI> thereunto, but also from the Expressions of Dr. <HI>Hornbeck,</HI> who frequently magnifies the <HI>Reason,</HI> and the <HI>Candour</HI> of our <HI>New-English</HI> Divine, even in those Points, wherein he dos himself Dissent from him. Nor is it amiss to add the Words, in Dr. <HI>Fullers</HI> Church History, hereupon; which are, <HI>Of all the Authors I have perused concerning
<PB N="11" REF="000724_0123_0FAA475BE521B108"/>
these Opinions, none to me was more Informative than</HI> Mr. John Norton, <HI>One of no less Learning than Modesty, in his Answer to</HI> Apollonius, <HI>Pastor in the Church of</HI> Middleburgh.</P>
<P>§. 15. It will do no Hurt, for me to Repeat one Passage on this Occasion, which to <HI>me</HI> seem∣ed worthy of some Remark. While Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> was Deeply engaged in Writing his Latin Ac∣count of our <HI>Church-Discipline,</HI> some of his more Accurate and Judicious Hearers, Imagined that his <HI>Publick Sermons</HI> wanted a little of that Ex∣actness, which did use to attend them; Whereof one said something to that Mr. <HI>Whiting,</HI> whom I may well call the <HI>Angel</HI> in the Church of <HI>Lyn.</HI> Mr. <HI>Whiting</HI> hereupon in a very Respectful and Obliging manner, spoke to Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> saying, <HI>Sir, There are some of your People, who think that the Services wherein you are engaged for all the Churches, Do something take off the Edge of the Mi∣nistry, wherewith you should Serve your own particu∣lar Church: I would entreat you, Sir, to consider this matter; for our Greatest Work is to Preach the Gospel unto that Flock, whereof we are Overseers.</HI> Our Great and Good man took the <HI>Excellent Oyl</HI> of this Intimation, with the <HI>Kindness</HI> which be∣came such a Man, and made it Serviceable unto his Holy <HI>Studies.</HI></P>
<P>§. 16. Another considerable Service, which then called for the Studies of this Excellent man,
<PB N="12" REF="000724_0124_0FAA475FE5757A40"/>
was the Advising, Modelling, and Recommend∣ing the <HI>Platform of Church Discipline,</HI> Agreed by a <HI>Synod</HI> at <HI>Cambridge</HI> in the year 1647. Into that <HI>Platform</HI> he would sain have had Inserted, cer∣tain <HI>Propositions</HI> concerning the <HI>Watch,</HI> which our Churches are to have over the <HI>Children</HI> Born in them; which <HI>Propositions</HI> were certainly, <HI>The First Principles of New-England:</HI> only the fierce Oppo∣sitions of One eminent Person, caused him that was of a <HI>Peaceable Temper,</HI> to forbear urging them any further; by which means, when those very <HI>Propositions</HI> came to be Advanced and Em∣braced in Another <HI>Synod,</HI> more than twice Seven years after, many People did Ignorantly count them <HI>Novelties.</HI> Moreover, when the <HI>Synod</HI> first Assembled, it was a thing of some unhappy Con∣sequence, that the Church of <HI>Boston</HI> would not send any <HI>Messengers</HI> unto it: but Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> Preaching the next Lecture there, wherein he Handled the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Councils,</HI> and the <HI>Power</HI> of Civil <HI>Magistrates</HI> to call such Assemblies, and the <HI>Duty</HI> of the Churches in Regarding their <HI>Advice,</HI> the Church of <HI>Boston</HI> were therewithal so satisfi∣ed, as to Testify their Communion with the Rest of the Churches, by sending three Messengers to accompany their Elders now in the <HI>Synod.</HI> And when the Result of the <HI>Synod,</HI> came to try it's Acceptance in the Churches; he did his part, especially in <HI>his own,</HI> with a Prudent and Pious Diligence, to obtain <HI>it;</HI> which was happily Ac∣complished.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="000724_0125_0FAA476101905460"/>
§. 17. There was yet one Comprehensive Service more, which this Learned man here did for the Church of God: and that was this. A Gentleman of <HI>New-England▪</HI> had Written a Book, Entituled, <HI>The Meritorious Price of Mans Redemption,</HI> Wherein he pretends to prove, <HI>That Christ Suffer∣ed not for us those unutterable Torments of Gods Wrath, which are commonly called</HI> Hell-Torments, to <HI>Redeem our Souls from them; and that Christ bore not our Sins by Gods</HI> Imputation, <HI>and, therefore, also did not bear the Curse of the Law for them.</HI> The <HI>General Court</HI> of the Colony, concerned that the Glorious Truths of the Gospel might be Res∣cued from the Confusions, whereinto the <HI>Essay</HI> of this Gentleman had thrown them, and afraid lest the Church of God abroad should Suspect that <HI>New-England</HI> allow'd of such <HI>Exorbitant Aberra∣tions,</HI> appointed Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> to Draw up an An∣swer to that <HI>Erroneous Treatise.</HI> This Work he performed with a most Elaborate and Judicious Pen; in a Book afterwards Published, under the Title of, <HI>A Discussion of that Great Point in Divi∣nity,</HI> The Sufferings of Christ; <HI>And the Questions about His Active and Passive Righteousness, and the Imputation thereof.</HI> In that Book the true Princi∣ples of the Gospel, are Stated with so much <HI>De∣monstration,</HI> as is indeed unanswerable. The Great Assertion therein Explained and Mentained is (according to the Express Words of the Re∣verend
<PB N="14" REF="000724_0126_0FAA476131909170"/>
Author) <Q>That the Lord Jesus Christ as <HI>God-Man,</HI> and <HI>Mediatour,</HI> according to the Will of the Father, and His own Voluntary Consent, fully Obeyed the <HI>Law, Doing</HI> the <HI>Command</HI> in a Way of <HI>Works,</HI> and <HI>Suffering</HI> the <HI>Essential Punishment</HI> of the Curse, in a Way of Obedient Satisfaction unto Divine Justice, there∣by Exactly fulfilling the <HI>First-Covenant:</HI> Which <HI>Active</HI> and <HI>Passive</HI> Obedience of His, together with His <HI>Original Righteousness,</HI> as a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> God, of His Rich <HI>Grace,</HI> actually Imputeth unto Believes, whom, upon the <HI>Receipt</HI> thereof, by the <HI>Grace of Faith,</HI> He Declareth and Accepteth, as <HI>Perfectly Righteous,</HI> and acknowledgeth them to have a <HI>Right</HI> unto <HI>Eternal Life.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And in every Clause of this Position, the Au∣thor Expressed, not his own Sense alone, but the Sense of all the Churches in the Country: In testimony whereof, there was Published at the End of the Book, an Instrument Signed by Five considerable Names, <HI>Cotton, Wilson, Mather, Symmes,</HI> and <HI>Tompson,</HI> who in the Name of others, declare, <Q><HI>As they Believe, they do also Profess,</HI> That the <HI>Obedience</HI> of Christ to the whole Law, which is the Law of Righteousness, is the <HI>Matter</HI> of our <HI>Justification;</HI> and the <HI>Imputation</HI> of our Sins to Christ (and thereupon His <HI>Suffering</HI> the <HI>Sense of the Wrath of God</HI> upon Him, for our Sin) and the <HI>Imputation</HI> of his Obedience and Suffer∣ings to us, are the <HI>Formal Cause</HI> of our
<PB N="15" REF="000724_0127_0FAA4761E450C4A8"/>
<HI>Justification;</HI> and that they who Deny this, do now Take away both of these, both <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Form</HI> of our <HI>Justification,</HI> and take away also our <HI>Justification,</HI> which is the <HI>Life</HI> of our Souls and of our Religion, and therefore called, <HI>The Justi∣fication of Life.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This being the Primitive Doctrine of JUSTI∣FICATION, among the Churches of <HI>New-England;</HI> the Things that were judged Opposite hereunto, in the Renowned RICHARD BAX∣TERS <HI>Aphorisms of Justification,</HI> did then give a Great and Just Offence unto the Faithful in this Country; albeit, the other more Practical and Savoury Books of that <HI>Holy Man,</HI> were highly Valued, in these <HI>American</HI> Regions; and not a sew have here Blessed God for him, and for his Labours. And as in those <HI>Elder</HI> Dayes of <HI>New-England,</HI> the esteem, which our Church had for that Eminent Man, did not hinder them, from Rejecting that <HI>New Covenant of Works,</HI> with which they thought he Confounded that most Important Article, upon the Notions whereof the <HI>Church</HI> either <HI>Stands</HI> or <HI>Falls;</HI> thus, it is <HI>a Grief of Mind</HI> unto our Churches at this Day, to find that Great and Good Man, in some of his <HI>Last Works,</HI> under the Blinding Heat of his Indignation against some which <HI>we</HI> also account, <HI>Unjustifiable,</HI> yea, <HI>Dangerous,</HI> Opinions and Expressions of Dr. <HI>Crisp,</HI> Reproaching some of the most undoubted Points in our <HI>Common Faith.</HI> We Read him unaccount∣ably
<PB N="16" REF="000724_0128_0FAA4762DB2F2AE0"/>
Enumerating among, <HI>Errors,</HI> which he sayes, have <HI>Corrupted Christianity,</HI> and <HI>Subverted the Gos∣pel,</HI> such things as these;</P>
<P><HI>They Feign,</HI> That God made a Covenant with <HI>Adam,</HI> that if he stood, God would continue him, and his Posterity and if he fell, God would take it, as if all his Posterity, then Personally Sinned in him.—<HI>Feigning</HI> God, to make <HI>A∣dam</HI> not only the Natural Father and Root of Mankind, but also Arbitrarily; a <HI>Constituted Re∣presenter</HI> of all the Persons that should Spring from him. Whence they infer, that Christ was by Gods Imposition, and his own Sponsion, made the <HI>Legal Representative</HI> Person of every one of the Elect, taken singularly: So that, what He did for them, God Reputeth them to have done by Him. Hereby they <HI>Falsely</HI> make the Person of the Mediator, to be the <HI>Legal Person</HI> of the Sinner.</P>
<P>They <HI>Forge</HI> a Law, that God never made, that saith, <HI>Thou or thy Surety, shall obey Perfectly or Dy.</HI></P>
<P>They <HI>Feign</HI> God to have made an <HI>Eternal Covenant</HI> with His Son.</P>
<P>They <HI>Feign</HI> Christ to have made such an <HI>Ex∣change</HI> with the Elect, as that having taken all <HI>their Sins,</HI> He hath given them all <HI>His Righteous∣ness;</HI> not only the <HI>Fruit of it,</HI> but the <HI>Thing in it self.</HI></P>
<P>They say, That by the Imputation of Christs

Righteousness, <HI>Habitual</HI> and <HI>Actual,</HI> We are Judged <HI>Perfectly Just.</HI></P>
<P>They Talk of <HI>Justification</HI> in meer Ignorant Confusion;—They say, That to <HI>Justify</HI> is not to <HI>make Righteous,</HI> but to <HI>Judge Righteous.</HI></P>
<P>They <HI>Err Grossly,</HI> saying, that by [<HI>Faith Im∣puted for Righteousness</HI>] and [<HI>our being Justified by Faith</HI>] is not meant, the <HI>Act,</HI> or <HI>Habit</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> but the <HI>Object,</HI> Christs <HI>Righteousness:</HI> Not stick∣ing thereby to turn such Texts into worse than <HI>Non-sense.</HI></P>
<P>These Things, which our Churches with a∣mazement, behold Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> thus calling <HI>Fictions, Falsehoods, Forgeries, Ignorant Confusions,</HI> and <HI>Gross Errors,</HI> Were Defended by Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> as the, <HI>Faith once Delivered unto the Saints:</HI> Nor do our Churches at this Day consider them, as any o∣ther than, <HI>Glorious Truths of the Gospel;</HI> which, as they were mentained by Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> So, two Divines which were the Scholars of Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> Well-known in both <HI>Englands, Nathanael</HI> and <HI>In∣crease Mather,</HI> (<HI>Fratrum D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lce Par;</HI>) and a Third, a Worthy Minister of the Gospel, Mr. <HI>Samuel Willard,</HI> now Living in the same House from whence Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> went, unto <HI>that not made with Hands,</HI> have in their Printed Labours most accurately Expressed them, and Confirmed them▪ Hence, although, as on the One side, I have this Passage of Mr. <HI>Baxters,</HI> in a Letter from him, written but a few Months before he Dyed, <HI>I am

That which gave Encouragment unto this Business, was not a <HI>Dream</HI> of Mr. <HI>Cottons;</HI> though it was, indeed, a Strange Thing, that Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> in his Illness, being Solli∣citous what Counsel to give unto his Church, he <HI>Dreamt,</HI> that he saw Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> Riding unto <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ston,</HI> to Succeed him, upon a <HI>White Horse,</HI> in Circumstances, that were exactly afterwards Ac∣complished: but it was a Design which Mr. <HI>Norton</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="000724_0133_0FAA4766AA9D7838"/>
had of Returning for <HI>England;</HI> A Design which he had so laid before his People, as to obtain their Grant, that if upon staying a <HI>Twelve Month Longer</HI> among them, there did Occur no Occasion for him, to alter his purposes, they would not Oppose his Going. Now, when the Agents of the Church at <HI>Boston,</HI> made this Motion to the Church of <HI>Ipswich,</HI> there was much Debate about it; Wherein at Length an Honest Brother made this Proposal, <HI>Brethren, A Case in some things like to This, was once that Way determined,</HI> We will call the Damsel, and Enquire at her Mouth; <HI>Where∣fore I propose, that our Teacher himself be Enquired of, whether he be Inclined to Go?</HI> They then put that Question to Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> himself, who being Troubled at the Offer of the Qustion unto <HI>him,</HI> answered, <HI>That, if they Judged such Reasons as caused his Removal from</HI> Europe <HI>into</HI> America, <HI>now call'd for his Removal from</HI> Ipswich <HI>to</HI> Boston, <HI>he should Resign himself; but he could not be Active.</HI> How∣ever, at Length, they consented, that he should for the present, go sojourn at <HI>Boston,</HI> to Try, and see how far the <HI>Will of God</HI> about this matter, might be afterwards Discovered; but after Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> was gone, many of the People fell into a very unreasonable Indisposition towards Mr. <HI>Rogers,</HI> as if he had not been <HI>Active</HI> enough, al∣though he had, indeed, been as Active, as he well could be, to Retain his <HI>Collegue</HI> among them. The Melancholy Temper of Mr. <HI>Rogers</HI> felt so
<PB N="22" REF="000724_0134_0FAA476733629A20"/>
Deep an Impression from these <HI>Paroxysms,</HI> and <HI>Murmurings,</HI> of the People, that it is Thought, his End was thereby Hastned; but the Church, upon the Death of Mr. <HI>Rogers,</HI> Renewing their Demands of Mr. <HI>Nortons</HI> Return, a <HI>Council</HI> was upon that Occasion called; which <HI>Council</HI> advised <HI>Ipswich</HI> to Grant Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> a fair Dismission unto the Service of <HI>Boston,</HI> and in <HI>Boston,</HI> of All <HI>New-England.</HI> However Diverse Les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er <HI>Councils,</HI> that were Successively called on this Occasion, could not comfortably procure this <HI>Dismission,</HI> till at last the Governour and Magistrates of the Colony called a <HI>Council</HI> for this End; in their <HI>Order</HI> for which, they Intimate their Concern, Lest, while the <HI>two Churches</HI> were contending, which of them should enjoy Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> they should <HI>both</HI> of them, and the whole Country with them, Lose that Reverend Person, by his Prosecuting his Inclination to Remove into <HI>England.</HI> Hereupon such a <HI>Dismission</HI> could not be Denyed; but now <HI>Boston</HI> Joyfully Receiving Mr. <HI>Norton, Ipswich</HI> applyed themselves unto Mr. <HI>Cobbet,</HI> who afterwards continued a Rich Blessing among them. And Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> did, indeed, the part of a Surviving <HI>Brother</HI> for Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> in Raising up, or, at least, Keeping up, the <HI>Name</HI> of that Great Man, by Publishing a most Elegant Account of his <HI>Life,</HI> part whereof was afterwards <HI>T</HI>ranscribed by <HI>Sam.

§. 20. Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> being now Transplanted into that Garden, which our Lord had in <HI>Boston,</HI> did there bring forth much of that <HI>Fruit</HI> where∣by the <HI>Heavenly Father was Glorified.</HI> There he Preached, he Wrote, he Pray'd, and mentained without any <HI>Prelatical Episcopacy,</HI> a <HI>Care of all the Churches.</HI> And <HI>New England,</HI> being a Country whose Interests were most Remarkably and Ge∣nerally Enwrapped in its <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Circum∣stances, there were many Good Offices, which Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> did, for the Peace of the whole Coun∣try, by his Wise <HI>Counsels</HI> upon many Occasions, given to its <HI>Counsellours.</HI> In Truth, if he had ne∣ver done any thing, but that one thing of pre∣venting by his Wise Interposition, the Acts of <HI>Hostility,</HI> which were like to pass between <HI>Our People,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Manhataes, That</HI> alone were well worth his coming into the <HI>Station,</HI> which he now had at <HI>Boston.</HI> But the Service which now most Signalized him was, his Agency at <HI>Whitehal;</HI> for, it being found necessary to Ad∣dress the <HI>Restored King;</HI> the Worshipful <HI>Simon Bradstreet</HI> <ABBR>Esq.</ABBR> and this Reverend Mr. <HI>John Norton,</HI> were sent over as <HI>Agents,</HI> from the Colo∣ny, with an Address unto His Majesty; wherein there were among others, the following Passages.</P>
<P><Q>We Supplicate Your Majesty for Your Gra∣cious Protection of us, in the Continuance both

of our Civil, and of our Religious <HI>Liberties;</HI> ac∣cording to the <HI>Grantees</HI> known End of Sueing for the <HI>Patent;</HI> conferr'd upon this Plantation by Your Royal Father. <HI>Our Liberty to Walk in the Faith of the Gospel, with all Good Conscience, according to the Order of the Gospel,</HI> was the Cause of our Transporting our selves, with our Wives, our Little Ones, and our Substance, from that Pleasant Land, over the <HI>Atlantic Ocean,</HI> into the Vast Wilderness; choosing rather the Pure <HI>Scripture Worship,</HI> with a <HI>Good Conscience,</HI> in this Remote Wilderness, than the Pleasures of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> with Submission to the Impositions of the, then so Disposed, and so far prevailing <HI>Hierarchy,</HI> which we could not Do without an <HI>Evil Conscience.</HI>—We are not <HI>Seditious</HI> as to the Interests of <HI>Cesar,</HI> nor <HI>Schismatical</HI> as to the Matters of <HI>Religion.</HI> We Distinguish between <HI>Churches,</HI> and their <HI>Impurities.</HI>—We could not Live without the <HI>Publick Worship</HI> of God, nor be permitted the <HI>Publick Worship</HI> with∣out such a <HI>Yoke</HI> of <HI>Subscription</HI> and <HI>Conformity,</HI> as we could not Consent unto without Sin. That we might, therefore, enjoy <HI>Divine Worship,</HI> free from <HI>Humane Mixtures,</HI> without Offence to God, Man, and our own Consciences, We, with <HI>Leave,</HI> but not without <HI>Tears,</HI> departed from our Country, Kindred and Fathers Houses, into this <HI>Patmos.</HI>—</Q></P>
<P>It was in <HI>February</HI> 1661,2. that they Began their

Voyage, and it was in <HI>September</HI> following, that they Returned; Mr. <HI>Nortons</HI> place, being the mean time supplyed by the Neighbouring Mi∣nisters, taking of their Turns. And by <HI>their Hands</HI> the Country Received the <HI>Kings Letters,</HI> wherein he signified, that the Expressions of their Loyalty and Affection to Him, were very Acceptable, and that consuming to them their <HI>Priviledges,</HI> He would Cherish them with all manner of Encou∣ragement, and Protection.</P>
<P>§. 21. Such has been the <HI>Jealous</HI> Disposi∣tion of our <HI>New-Englanders</HI> about their Dearly-bought <HI>Priviledges,</HI> and such also has been the <HI>Various</HI> Understanding of the People about the Extent of those Priviledges, that of all the <HI>Agents,</HI> which they have sent over unto the Court of <HI>England,</HI> for now Forty years together, I know not any <HI>One,</HI> who did not at his Return, meet with some very froward Entertainments among his Country-men: and there may be the <HI>Wis∣dom</HI> of the Holy and Righteous God, as well as the <HI>Malice</HI> of the Evil One, acknowledged, in the Ordering of such <HI>Temptations.</HI> Of these <HI>Tempta∣tions,</HI> a Considerable share fell to Mr. <HI>Norton;</HI> Concerning whom there were many, who would not stick to say, that <HI>he had laid the Foundation of Ruine to all our Liberties;</HI> and his Melancholly Mind Imagined, that his Best Friends began, therefore, to <HI>Look awry</HI> upon him.</P>

§. 22. In the Spring before his Going for <HI>England,</HI> he Preached an Excellent Sermon unto the Representatives of the whole Colony, Assem∣bled at the Court of <HI>Election,</HI> wherein, I take par∣ticular Notice of this Passage, Moses <HI>was the Meekest Man on Earth, yet it went ill with</HI> Moses, <HI>tis said, for</HI> THEIR SAKES. <HI>How long did</HI> Moses <HI>live at</HI> Meribah? <HI>Sure I am; it kill'd him in a Short Time; a man of as Good a Temper as could be expected from a meer Man: I tell you, it will not only Kill the People, but it will Quickly, Kill</HI> Moses too! And in the Spring after his Return from <HI>England,</HI> he found his own Observation in himself too much Exemplified. It was common∣ly Judged, That the <HI>Smothered Griefs</HI> of his Mind, upon the <HI>Unkind Resentments,</HI> which he thought many People had of his Faithful and Sincere En∣deavours to Serve them, did, more than a Little, Hasten his End; an End, whereat <HI>JOHN NORTON</HI> went, according to the Anagram of his Name <HI>INTO HONNOR.</HI> But he had the Priviledge to enter into <HI>Immortality,</HI> without such a Formal and Feeling Death, as the most of <HI>Mortals</HI> Encounter with; for though in the <HI>Forenoon</HI> of <HI>April</HI> 5. 1663. it was his Design to have Preach∣ed in the <HI>Afternoon,</HI> he was that <HI>Afternoon</HI> taken with a sudden <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pothymie,</HI> which presently and easily carried him away to those Glories, wherein the <HI>Weary are at Rest;</HI> but it was a <HI>Dark Night,</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="000724_0139_0FAA476D5240DDE8"/>
which the Inhabitants of <HI>Boston</HI> had upon the Noise of his Death: Every Corner of the Town was filled with Lamentations, which left a Cha∣racter upon that <HI>Night,</HI> unto this <HI>Day,</HI> not for∣gotten! His Dearest Neighbour, Mr. <HI>Richard Mather,</HI> wept over him, at his Funeral, which was on the next <HI>Lecture Day,</HI> a Sermon most Agree∣able to the Occasion; And the Son o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Fel∣low-Traveller, Mr. <HI>Thomas Shepard,</HI> was One of the Many, who bestowed their <HI>Elegies</HI> upon him; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing <HI>This,</HI> among his other Strokes.</P>

<P><Q>We give thanks to Mr. <HI>Dury,</HI> into whose heart it came to Remember, <HI>Joseph Separate from his Brethren</HI> at so great a Distance both by Sea and Land: and who hath vouchsafed with so comfortable a Message to visit us, poor People, cloathed in <HI>Sackcloth,</HI> for our Warfare; yet, as we trust, the <HI>Sackcloth</HI> of the Gospel: who hath not refused to put <HI>New-England</HI> as part of the skirt of <HI>Aarons Garment,</HI> upon which hath Descended some of the <HI>Precious Oyl,</HI> into the Catalogue of the so much famed <HI>Agreement:</HI> And who hath by his Letter exhorting to such Agree∣ment given us an Occasion to bring in this Testimony, such as it is, for our <HI>Brotherly Communion</HI> with the whole Company of <HI>Protestants</HI> professing the Faith of Christ Jesus.

<PB N="37" REF="000724_0149_0FAA4776EB4DE060"/>
to <HI>Neglect;</HI> They supposed that a Minister, who should only Read <HI>Forms of Sermons</HI> composed for him, would as Truly Discharge the Duty of <HI>Preaching,</HI> as One that should only Read such <HI>Forms of Prayers,</HI> would the Duty of <HI>Praying,</HI> in it: They could not find, that any Humane <HI>Forms of Prayer</HI> were much used in any part of the Church, until about <HI>Four Hundred</HI> years after Christ, nor any made for more than some Single Province, until <HI>Six Hundred</HI> years; nor any Imposed until <HI>Eight Hundred,</HI> when all manner of <HI>Ill-formed Things,</HI> began to be found in the <HI>Temple</HI> of God: Nevertheless very many of our Greatest Ministers, in our more Early times, did not use to Expatiate with such a Significant and Admirable <HI>Variety</HI> in their <HI>Prayers</HI> before their <HI>Sermons,</HI> as many of our Later Times have attained unto: Nor indeed <HI>Then</HI> did <HI>They,</HI> nor <HI>Still</HI> do <HI>We,</HI> count all <HI>Forms of Prayer</HI> Simply Unlawful. But the more General Improve∣ments and Expressions of <HI>The Gift of Prayers,</HI> in our Ministers, have <HI>Since</HI> been the matter of Observation; and Particularly Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> therein was truly Admirable!

we are furnished in the <HI>New-Covenant,</HI> for our <HI>Prayers.</HI> I have Heard of a Godly man in <HI>Ipswich,</HI> who after Mr. <HI>Nortons</HI> Going to <HI>Boston,</HI> would Ordinarily Travel on foot from <HI>Ips∣wich</HI> to <HI>Boston,</HI> which is about Thirty Miles, for nothing but the Weekly <HI>Lecture</HI> there; and he would profess, <HI>That it was worth a Greater Journey, to be a Partaker in One of Mr.</HI> Nortons <HI>Prayers▪</HI> This Pattern of <HI>Prayer</HI> in Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> had some Influence upon it, that since his Time, our <HI>Pulpits</HI> have been fuller than ever, of <HI>Experimental Demonstrations,</HI> that the Ministers of the Gospel may on All Occasions present their Supplications be∣fore God, in the Discharge of their Mini∣stry, with more Pertinent, more Affecting, more Expanded <HI>Enlargments,</HI> than any <HI>Form</HI> could Afford unto them. <HI>New-England</HI> can show, even <HI>Young Ministers,</HI> who never did in all Things Repeat <HI>One Prayer</HI> twice over, in that part of their Ministry wherein we are <HI>First of All, to make Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions, and Thanksgivings;</HI> and yet some∣times, for much more than an <HI>Hour</HI> together, they pour out their Souls unto the Almighty God in such a Fervent, Copious, and yet <HI>Proper</HI> Manner, that their most Critical Au∣ditors, can complain of Nothing <HI>Disagreeable</HI> but profess themselves extreamly Edifyed.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF Mr. JOHN WILSON.</HEAD>
<P>§. 1. SUCH is the Natural <HI>Tendency,</HI> in Humane Minds to <HI>Poetry,</HI> That, as tis Observed, the <HI>Roman Historian,</HI> in the very first Line of his <HI>History,</HI> fell upon a Verse,</P>
<P><HI>Urbem Romam, In Principl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Reges habuere;</HI></P>
<P>So, the <HI>Roman Orator,</HI> though a very <HI>Mean Poet,</HI> yet making an <HI>Oration</HI> for a <HI>Good One,</HI> could not let his First Sentence pass him, without a per∣fect <HI>Hexameter,</HI>

<P><PB N="2" REF="000724_0153_0FAA477A2104DD98"/>
If therefore, I were not of all men the most <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> my Reader might now Expect an Entertainment altogether in <HI>Verse;</HI> for I am go∣ing to Write the <HI>Life</HI> of that <HI>New-English</HI> Divine, who had so nimble, a Faculty of putting his De∣vour thoughts into <HI>Verse,</HI> that he Signalized him∣self by the Greatest <HI>Frequency,</HI> perhaps, that ever Man used, of sending <HI>Poems,</HI> to All Persons, in All Places, on All Occasions; and upon this, as well as upon Greater Accounts, was a <HI>David</HI> un∣to the <HI>Flocks</HI> of our Lord in the <HI>Wilderness:</HI>
<Q><L>Quicquid tentabat Dicere, Versus erat;</L></Q></P>
<P>Wherein, if the <HI>Curious</HI> Relished the <HI>Piety</HI> some∣times rather than the <HI>Poetry,</HI> the Capacity of the <HI>Most,</HI> therein to be accommodated, must be Con∣sidered. But I intend no further Account of this matter, than what is given by his Worthy Son, (Reprinting at <HI>Boston</HI> in the year, 1680 the <HI>Verses</HI> of his Father, upon the Famous Deliverances of the English Nation, Printed at <HI>London,</HI> as long a∣go, as the year 1626) Whose Words are, <HI>What Volumns hath he Penned, for the help of Others, in their several Changes of Condition? How was his Heart full of Good Matter? And has Verses past, like to the Handkerchiefs carried from</HI> Paul, <HI>to up∣hold the Disconsolate, &amp; Heal their Wounded Souls?</HI> For indeed this is the <HI>Least Thing,</HI> that we have to Relate of that <HI>Great Saint;</HI> and accordingly,

it is under a more Considerable Character, that I must now Exhibit him, Even, as a <HI>Father</HI> to the Infant Colonies of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>§. 2. Mr. <HI>John Wilson,</HI> descending from Eminent Ancestors, was Born at <HI>Winsor</HI> in the <HI>Wonderful Year</HI> 1588 The Third Son of Dr. <HI>William Wilson,</HI> a Prep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd of St. <HI>Pauls,</HI> of <HI>Roch∣ester</HI> and of <HI>Winsor,</HI> and Rector of <HI>Cliff:</HI> having for his Mother, a Neece of Dr. <HI>Edmund Grindal,</HI> the most Worthily Renowned Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> His exact Education under his Pa∣rents, which betimes <HI>Tinged!</HI> him with an Aver∣sation to Vice, and above all, to the very shadow of a <HI>Lye,</HI> fitted him to Undergoe the further Education, which he received in <HI>Eaton-Colledge,</HI> under <HI>Udal</HI> (and <HI>Langely</HI>) whom now we may Venture, after Poor <HI>Tom. Tusser,</HI> to call, <HI>The Seve∣rest of Men.</HI> Here he was most Remarkably Twice Delivered from Drowning; but at his Book, he made such Proficiency, that while he was the <HI>Least Boy</HI> in the School, he was made a <HI>Propositor;</HI> and when the Duke of <HI>Biron,</HI> Emba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sador from the French King Henry IV, to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Visited the School, he made a Latin Oration, for which the Duke bestowed Three <HI>Angels</HI> upon him. After four years Con∣tinuance at <HI>Eaton,</HI> he was Removed unto <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI> between the Fourteenth and Fifteenth year of his Age; and Admitted into <HI>Kings College</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="000724_0155_0FAA477B7B4508E0"/>
in the year 1602. When he came to stand for a <HI>Fellowship</HI> in that <HI>Colledge,</HI> his Antipathy to some Horrid Wickednesses, whereto a Detestable Wretch that had been Acquainted with him, would have betray'd him, caused that Malicious Wretch by Devised and Accursed <HI>Slanders</HI> to ruin so far the Reputation of this Chast Youth with the other <HI>Fellows,</HI> that had not the Provost, who was a Serious and a Reverend Person, in∣terposed for him, he had utterly lost his Privi∣ledge; which now by the <HI>Major Vote</HI> he Ob∣tained. But this Affliction put him upon many <HI>Thoughts</HI> and <HI>Prayers</HI> before the Lord.</P>
<P>§. 3. He had hitherto been, according to his Good Education, very <HI>Civilly</HI> and <HI>Soberly</HI> Dis∣posed: but being by the Good Hand of God, Led unto the Ministry of such Holy men as Mr. <HI>Rains,</HI> Dr. <HI>Taylor,</HI> Dr. <HI>Chadenton,</HI> he was by their Sermons Enlightned and A wakened, unto more Sollicitous Enquiries after, <HI>The One Thing yet Lack∣ing in him.</HI> The Serious Dispositions of his Mind, were now such, that besides his pursuance after the <HI>Works</HI> of <HI>Repentance</HI> in himself, he took no little pains to pursue it in others; especially the <HI>Malefactors</HI> in the Prisons, which he Visited with a Devout, Sedulous, and Successful Industry. Nevertheless, being forestalled with Prejudices against the <HI>Puritans</HI> of those Times, as if they had held, he knew not well what <HI>Odd Things,</HI> he
<PB N="5" REF="000724_0156_0FAA477C217EA948"/>
Declined <HI>Their</HI> Acquaintance; although his Good Conversation had made him to be accounted <HI>One</HI> of them, <HI>Himself.</HI> Until going unto a <HI>Book∣sellers</HI> Shop to Augment his Well-furnisht <HI>Library,</HI> he Lit upon that Famous Book of Mr. <HI>Richard Rogers,</HI> called, <HI>The Seven Treatises;</HI> which, when he had Read, he so Affected, not only the <HI>Mat∣ter,</HI> but also the <HI>Author</HI> of the Book, that he took a Journey unto <HI>Wethersfield,</HI> on purpose to hear a Sermon, from that <HI>Boanerges.</HI> When, he had heard the Heavenly Passages that fell from the Lips of that Worthy Man, <HI>Privately,</HI> as well as <HI>Publickly,</HI> and compared therewithal the Writings of <HI>Greenham,</HI> of <HI>Dod,</HI> and of <HI>Dont,</HI> especially <HI>The Path way to Heaven,</HI> Written by the Author last mentioned, he saw that <HI>They</HI> who were Nicknamed, <HI>Puritans,</HI> were like to be the <HI>Desirablest Companions,</HI> for One that intended his own Everlasting Hap∣piness; and pursuant unto the Advice, which he had from Dr. <HI>Ames,</HI> he associated himself with a Pious Company in the University, who kept their Meetings in Mr. <HI>Wilsons</HI> Chamber, for <HI>Prayer, Fasting,</HI> Holy <HI>Conference,</HI> and the Exercises of true Devotion.</P>
<P>§. 4. But now, perceiving many Good men to Scruple many of the <HI>Rites,</HI> Practised and Im∣posed in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> he furnished himself with all the <HI>Books,</HI> that he could find Written on the Case of <HI>Conformity,</HI> both <HI>Pro</HI> and
<PB N="6" REF="000724_0157_0FAA477F217C24C0"/>
<HI>Con,</HI> and pondered with a most Conscientious Deliberation, the Arguments on both sides pro∣duced. He was hereby so convinced of the E∣vil in <HI>Conformity,</HI> that at Length, for his Obser∣veable Omission, of certain Uninstituted <HI>Ceremo∣nies</HI> in the Worship of God, the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> then Visiting the University, pronounced upon him the Sentence of <HI>Quindenum,</HI> that is, That, be∣sides other Mortifications, he must within <HI>Fifteen Dayes,</HI> have been <HI>Expelled,</HI> if he continued in his Offence. His Father, being hereof Advised, with all Paternal Affection, Wrote unto him to <HI>Con∣form;</HI> and at the same Time, interceded with the Bishop, that he might have a Quarter of a year allowed him; in which time, if he could not be Reduced, he should then leave his <HI>Fellow∣ship</HI> in the Colledge. Hereupon he sent him un∣to several <HI>Doctors</HI> of Great Fame, to get his Ob∣jections Resolved; but when much <HI>Discourse,</HI> and much <HI>Writing,</HI> had passed between them, he was rather the more confirmed in his Principles a∣bout <HI>Church-Reformation.</HI> Wherefore his Father, then diverting him from the Designs of the <HI>Mi∣nistry,</HI> disposed him to <HI>the Inns of Court;</HI> where he fell into Acquaintance with some Young Gen∣tlemen, who associated with him in constant Exercises of Devotion, to which Meetings the Repeated Sermons of Dr. <HI>Gouge</HI> were a continual Entertainment: and here it was, that he came into the Advantageous Knowledge of the Learn∣ed
<PB N="7" REF="000724_0158_0FAA4780074BFF08"/>
<HI>Scultetus,</HI> Chaplain to the Prince Palatine of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> then making some stay in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>§. 5. When he had continued Three years at the <HI>Inns of Court,</HI> his Father discerning his Dis∣position to be a <HI>Minister</HI> of the Gospel, permitted his Proceeding <HI>Master of Arts,</HI> in the University of <HI>Cambridge;</HI> but Advised him to Address ano∣ther <HI>Colledge,</HI> than that, where he had formerly met with Difficulties. Dr.<HI>Cary,</HI> who was then Vice-Chancellour, understanding his former Cir∣cumstances, would not Admit him without <HI>Sub∣scription:</HI> but he refused to <HI>Subscribe.</HI> In this Dis∣tress he Repaired unto his Father, at whose House there happened then to be present, the Countess of <HI>Bedfords</HI> Chief Gentleman, who had Business with the Earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> the <HI>Chancellour</HI> of the University. And this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ble Person upon the Information, which that Gentleman gave him of the matter, presently Wrote a Letter to the Vice Chancellour on the Behalf of our Young <HI>Wilson;</HI> whereupon he received his <HI>Degree,</HI> and continued a while after this, in <HI>Emanuel-Colledge:</HI> from whence he made frequent and useful Visits unto his Friends, in the Counties adjoining, and became further fitted for his Intended Service. But while he was passing under these Changes, he took up a <HI>Resolution,</HI> which he thus expressed before the Lord; <HI>That if the Lord would Grant him a Liberty of Conscience, with Purity of Worship,
<PB N="8" REF="000724_0159_0FAA478177C21028"/>
he would be content, yea, thankful, though it were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the furthermost End of the World.</HI> A most Pro∣phetical <HI>Resolution!</HI></P>
<P>§. 6. At Length, Preaching his first Ser∣mon at <HI>New-Port; he set his Hand unto that Plough from whence he never afterwards Looked Back:</HI> not very long after which, his Father lying on his Death Bed, he kneeled, in his Turn, before him, for his <HI>Blessing,</HI> and brought with him for a share in that <HI>Blessing,</HI> the Virtuous Young Gen∣tlewoman, the Daughter of the Lady <HI>Mansfield</HI> (Widow of Sir <HI>John Mansfield</HI> Master of the <HI>Minarys</HI> and the Queens Surveyor) whom he Designed afterwards to Marry: Whereupon the Old Gentleman said, <HI>Ah,</HI> John <HI>I have taken much Care about thee, such time as thou wast in the Uni∣versity, because thou wouldest not Conform; I would fain have brought thee to some higher Preferment, then thou hast yet attained unto: I see thy Conscience is very Scrupulous, concerning some things that have been Observed and Imposed in the Church: Never∣theless, I have Rejoyced to see the Grace and Fear of God, in thy Heart; and seeing thou hast kept a Good Conscience hitherto, and walked according to thy Light So Do still; and Go by the Rules of Gods Holy Word: The Lord Bless thee, and her, whom thou hast chosen to be the Companion of thy Life!</HI> Among other Places, where he now Preached, <HI>Moreclake</HI> was One; where his <HI>Non-Conformity</HI> exposed him to
<PB N="9" REF="000724_0160_0FAA47823A379080"/>
the Rage of <HI>Persecution;</HI> but by the <HI>Friendship</HI> of the Justice, namely Sir <HI>William Bird,</HI> a Kinsman of his Wife, and by a <HI>Mistake</HI> of the Informers, the Rage of that Storm was moderated.</P>
<P>§. 7. After this, he Lived as a Chaplain Successively in Honourable and Religious Fami∣lies; and, at last, was Invited unto the House of the most Pious Lady <HI>Scudamore.</HI> Here Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> observing the Discourse of the Gentry at the Table, on the <HI>Lords-Day,</HI> to be too Disagree∣able unto the Devout Frame to be mentained on such a Day, at Length he Zealously stood up at the Table, with Words to this purpose, <HI>I will make bold to Speak a Word or Two; This is the Lords Holy Day, and we have been hearing His Word, and after the Word Preached, every One should think, and speak about such Things, as have been Delivered in the Name of God; and not Lavish cut the Time in Discourses about Hawks &amp; Hounds.</HI> Whereupon, a Gentleman then present, made this Handsome and Civil Answer, <HI>Sir Wee Deserve all of us to be thus Reproved by you; This is, indeed, the Sabbath∣Day, &amp; we should, surely, have better Discourse; I hope, it will be a Warning to us.</HI> Notwithstand∣ing this, the next Lords Day, the Gentry at the Table were at their <HI>Old Notes;</HI> which caused Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> again to tell them, <HI>That the Hawks which they Talkt of, were the Birds, that Picked up the seed of the Word, after the Sowing of it;</HI> and
<PB N="10" REF="000724_0161_0FAA4782E85316F0"/>
Pray'd them, <HI>That their Talk might be of such Things, as might Sanctify the Day, and Edify their own Souls;</HI> which caused the former Gentleman to Renew his former Thankfulness for the Ad∣monition. But Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> the Ladys Husband, was very angry; whereof when the Lady ad∣vised Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> wishing him to say something, that might Satisfy him, he Replyed, <HI>Good Madam, I know not wherein I have given any just Offence; and therefore, I know of no Satisfaction that I owe Your Ladyship has Invited me to Preach the Good Word of God among you; and so I have endeavoured according to my Ability: Now such Discourse as this, on the Lords Day, is Profane &amp; Disorderly: If your Husband Like me not, I will be gone.</HI> When the Lady informed her Husband how Peremptory Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> was, in this matter, he mended his Countenance and Carriage; and the Effect of this Reproof was, that unsuitable Discourse, on the <HI>Lords Day,</HI> was cured among them.</P>

Removing from this Family, after he had been, a while at <HI>Henly,</HI> he continued for three years together, Preaching at Four Places, by Turns, which lay near one another, on the Edges of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> namely <HI>Bumsted, Stoke, Clare,</HI> and <HI>Candish.</HI> Here, some of <HI>Sudbury</HI> happening to hear him, they Invited him to Succeed the Emi∣nent Old Mr. <HI>Jenkins,</HI> with which Invitation, he cheerfully complied, and the more cheerfully be∣cause

of his Opportunity to be near Old Mr. <HI>Richard Rogers,</HI> from whom afterwards when Dying, he Received a <HI>Blessing</HI> among his Children; yea, to encourage his Acceptance of this Place, the very <HI>Reader</HI> of the Parish did <HI>Subscribe,</HI> with many Scores of others, their Desires of it; and yet he accepted not the <HI>Pastoral Charge</HI> of the Place, without a Solemn Day of <HI>Prayer</HI> with <HI>Fasting,</HI> (wherein the Neighbouring Ministers assisted) at his Election: Great notice was now taken of the <HI>Success,</HI> which God gave unto his Labours, in this Famous Town; among other Instances whereof, One was this. <HI>A Tradesman</HI> much given to <HI>Stealing,</HI> as well as other Profane and Vicious Practices, One Day seeing People flock to Mr. <HI>Wilsons</HI> Lecture, thought with himself, <HI>Why should I Tarry at Home to Work, when so many Go to Hear a Sermon?</HI> Wherefore, for the sake of <HI>Company,</HI> he went unto the Lecture too; but when he came, he found a Sermon, as it were, particularly Directed unto himself, on Eph. 4.28. <HI>Let him that hath Stole, Steal no more;</HI> and such was the Im∣pression thereof upon his Heart, that, from this Time, he became a Changed and Pious man.</P>

<PB N="12" REF="000724_0163_0FAA47846B118728"/>
Principal Author of it. This <HI>A—n</HI> had former∣ly been an Apprentice in <HI>London,</HI> Where the Bishops deteined him some years, under an hard Imprisonment, because he Refused the Oath <HI>ex Officio,</HI> which was pressed upon him to tell, <HI>Whe∣ther he had never heard his Master Pray against the Bishop?</HI> The Charity of Well Disposed People now Supported him, till he got abroad, Recom∣mended by his Hard Sufferings, unto the Good Affections of the <HI>Puritans,</HI> at whose Meetings he became so Conversant, and thereupon such a for∣ward and zealous Professor, that, at Length he Took upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, under the Confidence of some <HI>Latinity,</HI> whereof he was Owner, to be a Sort of a <HI>Preacher</HI> among them. This man would Re∣verence Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> as his <HI>Father,</HI> and yet upon the Provocation of seeing Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> more highly Valued and Hououred, than himself, he not only became a <HI>Conformist</HI> himself, but also, as <HI>Apostates</HI> use to be, a Malignant and Violent <HI>Persecutor</HI> of those, from whom he had <HI>Apostatized.</HI> By his means, Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> was put unto Trouble in the <HI>Bishops Courts;</HI> from whence his Deliverance was, at Length Obtained by certain <HI>Powerful Mediators.</HI> And once by <HI>his</HI> Tricks the most noted Pursevant of those Times, was employed for the Siezing of Mr. <HI>Wilson;</HI> but though he Siezed upon many Scores of the People coming from the Lecture, he Dismissed the rest, because he could not meet with Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> himself, who by a Special Provi∣dence,
<PB N="13" REF="000724_0164_0FAA4785D1A25010"/>
went out of his direct way, to Visit a Worthy Neighbour, and so escaped this <HI>Mighty Hunter.</HI> Afterwards an Eminent Lady, happen∣ing Innocently to make some Comparison be∣tween the Preaching of Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> and one Dr.<HI>B.</HI> of <HI>B.</HI> the Angry Doctor presently applied him∣self unto the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> who for a while <HI>Suspended</HI> him. And when that Storm was over; he with several other Worthy Ministers, came to be wholly Silenced, in another, that was Raised upon Complaints made by one Mr. <HI>Bird,</HI> unto the Bishop of <HI>Norwich</HI> against them. Concern∣ing this <HI>Ill Bird,</HI> there happened one passage hereupon, which had in it something Extraordi∣nary. Falling very Sick, he had the help of a Famous and Skilful Physician, One Dr. <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Colchester;</HI> who having left his Patient, in his Opinion, safely Recovered, gave Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> a Visit with an Account of it. <HI>Recovered!</HI> Says Mr. <HI>Wilson; You are mistaken Mr. Doctor, He's a Dead man!</HI> The Doctor answered, <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ever I re∣covered a Sick man in my Life, that man is Recover∣ed:</HI> but Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> replied, <HI>No, Mr. Doctor, He's a Dead man, he shall not Live; Mark my Words!</HI> The Doctor smiled; but for all that, before they parted, the News was brought them, that the man was <HI>Dead</HI> indeed, and, <HI>The Lord known by the Judgment, which He Executed.</HI> But at last, Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> obtained from the truly Noble Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> to Sign a Letter, which the Earl bid
<PB N="14" REF="000724_0165_0FAA4786C0AC0AF8"/>
himself to draw up, unto the Bishop, on his be half; by the Operation of which Letter, his Li∣berty, for the Exercise of his Ministry, was again procured. This Bishop was the Well-known Dr. <HI>Harsnet,</HI> who a Little while after this, Travelling <HI>Northward,</HI> upon Designs of mischief against the Reforming Pastors and Christians there, certain Ministers of the <HI>South</HI> set apart a Day, for Solemn <HI>Fasting</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> to Implore the Help of Hea∣ven, against those Designs; and on that very Day, he was taken with a Sore and an odd Fit, which caused him to stop at a Blind House of Entertain∣ment on the Road, where he suddenly Dyed.</P>
<P>§. 10. At Last, <HI>being Persecuted in One Coun∣try, he must Flee into another.</HI> The Plantation of a <HI>New-English</HI> Colony was begun; And Mr <HI>Wil∣son,</HI> with some of his Neighbours, Embarked themselves in the Fleet, which came over thither in the year 1630. Where he applied himself with all the Vigour Imaginable, to Encourage the poor People, under the Difficulties of their <HI>New Plan∣tation.</HI> This Good People buried near Two Hundred of their Number, wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in a Quarter of a year after their first Landing; which caused Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> particularly to Endeavour their Con∣solation, by Preaching on <HI>Jacobs</HI> not being dis∣heartned by the Death of his nearest Friends in the way, when God had called him to Remove. And how <HI>Remarkably,</HI> perhaps I might say, <HI>Ex∣cessively,</HI>

Liberal he was in Employing his Estate for the Relief of the <HI>Needy,</HI> Every such One so beheld him, as to Reckon him, <HI>The Father of them all:</HI> Yea, the poor <HI>Indians</HI> themselves also tasted of his <HI>Bounty.</HI> If it were Celebrated, as the Glo∣ry of <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> that he would Sell his <HI>Goods</HI> to convert them into <HI>Alms</HI> for the poor, yea, that, <HI>Quadam Die proprium Atramentarium Argenteolum, it ditaret Inopes, inter pig nora obligavit,</HI> out Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> though a greater Disclaimer of <HI>Merit,</HI> than <HI>Bellarmine</HI> was, not only in his Writings, but on his Death-bed it self, yet came not behind <HI>Bellar∣mine</HI> for the Extension of his <HI>Charity.</HI> To give <HI>Instances</HI> of his, even over-doing <HI>Liberality,</HI> would be to do it <HI>Injuries;</HI> for indeed they were In∣numerable; He acted as if the Primitive Agree∣ment of having <HI>All Things in Common,</HI> had been of all things the most Agreeable unto him.

<P>§. 11. Mr. <HI>Wilsons</HI> Removal to <HI>New-England,</HI> was rendred the more Difficult, by the Indisposi∣tion of his Dearest <HI>Consort</HI> thereunto; but he hoping, that according to a <HI>Dream,</HI> which he had before his coming hither, <HI>That he saw here a little Temple, rising out of the Ground, which by Degrees increased into very high and large Dimensions,</HI> the Lord had a <HI>Temple</HI> to build in these Regions; Resolved never to be Discouraged from his Un∣dertaking Wherefore, having first sent over an Encouraging Account of the Good <HI>Order,</HI> both <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Sacred,</HI> which now began to be Esta∣blished in the Plantation, he did himself Return into <HI>England,</HI> that he might further pursue the

Effect thereof; and accordingly he made it his Business, wherever he came, to Draw as many Good men, as he could, into this Country, with him. His <HI>Wife</HI> remained unperswadeable till upon <HI>Prayer</HI> with <HI>Fasting</HI> before the Almighty <HI>Turner of Hearts,</HI> he Received an Answer, in her becoming Willing to accompany him over an <HI>Ocean</HI> into a <HI>Wilderness.</HI> A very sorrowful Part∣ing they now had from their Old Friends in <HI>Sudbury,</HI> but a Safe, and a Quick Passage over the <HI>Atlantic;</HI> and whereas the Church of <HI>Boston,</HI> ob∣serving that he Arrived not, at the Time expect∣ed, had set apart a <HI>Day</HI> of <HI>Humiliation</HI> on his Be∣half, his Joyful Arrival before the Day, caused them to turn it into a <HI>Day</HI> of <HI>Thanksgiving.</HI> But Mrs. <HI>Wilson</HI> being thus perswaded over, into the Difficulties of an <HI>American</HI> Desart, I have heard, that her Kinsman, Old Mr. <HI>Dod,</HI> for her Conso∣lation under those Difficulties, did sent her a <HI>Present,</HI> with an <HI>Advice,</HI> which had in it, some∣thing of <HI>Curiosity.</HI> He sent her, at the same Time, a Brass <HI>Counter,</HI> a Silver <HI>Crown,</HI> and a Gold <HI>Jaco∣bus;</HI> all of them severally wrapped up: With this Instruction unto the Gentlemen who carried it; That he should first of all Deliver only the <HI>Counter,</HI> and if She Received it with any Show of Discontent he should then take no further Notice of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but if She gratefully Resented that <HI>Small Thing,</HI> for the sake of the Hand it came from, he should then go on to deliver the

Confusion, if the Good God had not Remarka∣bly Blessed the Endeavours of a <HI>Synod;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> for a while, met with hard measure for his Early Opposition to those Errors, until by the Help of that <HI>Synod,</HI> the Storm was Weathered out.

himself a Liberty, to <HI>Preach</HI> more after the <HI>Pri∣mitive</HI> Manner; without any Distinct <HI>Propositi∣ons,</HI> but Chiefly in <HI>Exhortations</HI> and <HI>Admonitions,</HI> and Good wholesome <HI>Counsils,</HI> tending to Excite Good Motions, in the Minds of his Hearers; (but upon the same Texts that were Doctrinally hand∣led by his Colleague instantly before:) and yet sometimes his Pastoral Discourses had such a <HI>Spirit</HI> in them, that Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI> would say, <HI>Me∣thinks I hear an Apostle, when I hear this Man!</HI> Yea, even One of his <HI>Ex Temp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re</HI> Sermons, has been since his Death, counted worthy to be Pub∣lished unto the World.

Diligence Visited the Congregations of the Neighbouring Towns, at their <HI>Weekly Lectures,</HI> until the Weaknesses of <HI>Old Age</HI> rendered him Uncapable. And it was a delightful Thing, then to see upon every Recurring Opportunity, a large Company of Christians, and even <HI>Magistrates</HI> and <HI>Ministers</HI> among them, and Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> in the Head of them, Visiting the <HI>Lectures</HI> in all the Vi∣cinage, with such Heavenly Discourses on the Road, as caused the Hearts of the Disciples, to <HI>Burn within them:</HI> and indeed it was Remark'd, That though the Christians <HI>Then</HI> Spent Less Time, in the <HI>Shop,</HI> or <HI>Field,</HI> than they do <HI>Now,</HI> yet they did in <HI>Both</HI> prosper more. But for Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> I am saying, That a <HI>Lecture</HI> was a <HI>Treasure</HI> unto him; he Priz'd it, he Sought it, until <HI>Old Age</HI> at Length brought with it <HI>a Sickness,</HI> which a Long while confined him. In this Illness, he took a Solemn Farewel of the <HI>Ministers,</HI> who had their Weekly Meetings, at his <HI>Hospitable House,</HI> and were now come together from all parts, at the Anniversary <HI>Election</HI> for the Government of the Colony. They asked him, to declare Solemn∣ly, what he thought might be the <HI>Sins,</HI> which provoked the Displeasure of God against the Country. Whereto his Answer was, <HI>I have long feared several Sins;</HI> Whereof; One, he said, was <HI>Corahism;</HI> <Q>That is, when People rise up as <HI>Corah</HI> against their <HI>Ministers,</HI> as if they took too much upon them, when indeed they do but
<PB N="27" REF="000724_0178_0FAA4792D4A84CB0"/>
Rule for Christ, and according to Christ; yet it is nothing for a Brother to stand up and Oppose, without Scripture, or Reason, the Word of an Elder, saying [<HI>I am not Satisfied!</HI>] And hence, if he do not like the Administra∣tion (be it <HI>Baptism</HI> or the Like) he will turn his back upon God and His Ordinances, and Go away. And for our Neglect of <HI>Baptising</HI> the Children of the <HI>Church,</HI> those that some call <HI>Grand-children,</HI> I think God is provoked by it. Another Sin (<HI>said he</HI>) I take, to be the making Light of; and not Subjecting to the Authority of <HI>Synods,</HI> without which the Churches cannot long Subsist.</Q></P>
<P>§. 18. Afterwards, having Solemnly with Prayer, and <HI>Particularly</HI> and very <HI>Prophetically</HI> Blessed his Relations and Attendants, he now thus comforted himself, <HI>I shall e're Long be with my Old Friends,</HI> Dr. Preston, Dr. Sibs, Dr. Taylor, Dr. Gouge, Dr. Ames, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Norton, <HI>my Inns of Court Friends, and my Consort, Children, Grand children in the Kingdom of God.</HI> And when some then present, magnified God, for making him a Man of such <HI>Use,</HI> and Lamented themselves, in their own <HI>Loss</HI> of him, he replied, <HI>Alas, Alas; Use no such Words concerning me; for I have been an Unprofitable Servant, not worthy to be called a Servant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Lord: but I must say,</HI> The Lord be merciful to me a Sinner, <HI>and I must say,</HI> Let Thy

Tender Mercies come unto me, O Lord, Even Thy Salvation according to Thy Word. The Evening before he Dyed, his Daughter asking him, Sit, <HI>How do you Do?</HI> he held up his Hand, and said <HI>Vanishing Things! Vanishing Things!</HI> But he then made a most affectionate Prayer, with and for his Friends; and so Quietly <HI>Fell Asleep</HI> on August 7.1667. in the Seventy ninth year of his Age. Thus Expired that Reverend Old man: of whom, when he left <HI>England,</HI> an Emi∣nent Personage said, <HI>New-England, shall Flourish, free from all General Desolations, as long as that Good man Liveth in it!</HI> Which was Comfortably accomplished. He was <HI>Interr'd</HI> with more than Ordinary Solemnity; and his Neighbour, Mr. <HI>Richard Mather</HI> of <HI>Dorchester,</HI> thereat Lamented the Publick Loss in his Departure, with a Sermon upon Zech. 1.5. <HI>Your Fathers where are they, and the Prophets, do they Live for ever?</HI></P>

<P>When one Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> who waited on him from <HI>Hartford</HI> unto <HI>Weathersfield,</HI> was followed with the news of his Daughters being fallen suddenly and doubtfully Sick, Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> looking up to Heaven, began mightily to Wrestle with God for the Life of the Young woman: <HI>Lord</HI> (said he) <HI>with thou now take away thy Servants Child, when thou seest he is attending on thy Poor unworthy Ser∣vant in most Christian Kindness; Oh! do it not!</HI> And then turning himself about unto Mr. <HI>Adams, Brother</HI> (said he) <HI>I trust your Daughter shall Live, I believe in God She shall Recover of this Sickness!</HI> And so it marvellously came to pass, and She is now the fruitful <HI>Mother</HI> of several desireable Children.</P>

<P>Once passing over the <HI>Ferry</HI> unto a <HI>Lecture,</HI> on the other side of the Water, he took notice of a Young man in the Boat, that Worded it very unhandsomely unto his Aged <HI>Father:</HI> whereat this Faithful <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> being much Troubled, said un∣to him <HI>Young man, I advise you to Repent of your Undutiful Rebellious Carriage towards your Father; I expect else to hear, that God has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut you off, before a Twelve month come to an End!</HI> And before this time expired, if came to pass, that this unhappy Youth, going to the Southward, was there Hack'd in pieces, by the <HI>Pequod</HI> Indians.</P>
<P>A <HI>Company</HI> of People in this Country, were mighty hot upon a Project of Removing to <HI>Pro∣vidence,</HI> an Island in the <HI>West Indies;</HI> and a Vene∣ratle <HI>Assembly</HI> of the Chief <HI>Magistrates,</HI> and <HI>Mi∣nisters</HI> in the Colony, was addressed for their <HI>Counsil</HI> about this undertaking; which <HI>Assembly</HI> laid before the <HI>Company</HI> very weighty Reasons to Disswade them from it.

you come to Ask Counsel in so weighty a matter at this, and to have Help from an Ordinance of God in it? and are you aforehand Resolved, that you will Go on?

<P>A <HI>Council</HI> sitting at a Town, where some <HI>Eccle∣siastical Differences</HI> called for the Assistances of the Neighbours to Compose them, there was one man, observed by Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> to be extreamly perverse, and most Unreasonably Troublesome, and Mischievous, to the Peace of the Church there; Whereupon Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> told the <HI>Council;</HI> he was confident, <HI>That the Jealousy of God would set a Mark upon that Man, and that the Ordinary Death of men should not befall him.</HI> It happened shortly after, that the man was barbarously Butchered by the <HI>Salvages!</HI></P>
<P>While Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> was Minister of <HI>Sudbury,</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> there was a Noted Person, who had been absent, for some while among the Papists. This man Returning Home, Offered himself to the <HI>Communion;</HI> whereat Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> in the open Assembly Spoke unto him after this manner; <Q>Brother, you, here; present your self, as if you would partake in the Holy Supper of the Lord. You cannot be Ignorant of what you
<PB N="33" REF="000724_0184_0FAA479722BE8800"/>
have done in withdrawing your self from our Communion, and how you have been much conversant, for a Considerable while, with the Papists, whose Religion is Antichristian. There∣fore, though we cannot so absolutely Charge you, God knows, who is the Searcher of All Hearts; and if you have Defiled your self with their Worship and Way, and not Repent∣ed of it, by offering to partake, at this Time, in the Holy Supper with us, you will Eat, and Drink your own Damnation; but if you are clear, and have nothing wherewith to charge your self; you your self know; upon this Account you may Receive.</Q> The man did then partake at the <HI>Lords Table,</HI> professing his Innocency. But as if the <HI>Devil had entered into him,</HI> he soon went and <HI>Hanged</HI> himself.</P>
<P>In the Circumstances of his own Children, he saw many Effects of an <HI>Extraordinary Faith.</HI></P>
<P>His Eldest Son, <HI>Edmund,</HI> while Travelling into the Countries, which the Bloody Popish Inquisiti∣on, has made a Clime too <HI>Torrid</HI> for a <HI>Protestant,</HI> was Extreamly Exposed: but the Prayers of the Young Gentlemans continually Distressed Father, for him, were answered, with Signal Preservati∣ons. When he was under Examination by the Inquisitors, a Friend of the Chief among them, suddenly arrived; and the Inquisitor not having seen this Friend for many years before, was
<PB N="34" REF="000724_0185_0FAA479A392253D8"/>
hereby so diverted and mollified, that he car∣ried the Young Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> to Dinner with him; and, though he had passed hitherto <HI>Unknown</HI> by his True Name, yet this Inquisitor could now call him, to his great Surpize, by the Name, of Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> and report unto him the Character of his <HI>Father,</HI> and his <HI>Fathers</HI> Industry in Serv∣ing the Hereticks of <HI>New-England.</HI> But, that which I here most of all design, is an Account of a thing yet more Memorable and Unaccounta∣ble. For, at another Time, his Father Dream'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> himself Transported into <HI>Italy,</HI> where he saw a Beautiful Person in the Sons Chamber, Endea∣vouring, with a thousand <HI>Enchantments</HI> to debauch him; whereupon the <HI>Old</HI> Gentleman made, and was by his Bed-fellow overheard making, first, <HI>Prayers</HI> to God full of Agony, and then <HI>Warnings</HI> unto his Tempted Son, to Beware of Defiling himself with the <HI>Daughter of a Strange God.</HI> Now, some Considerable while after this, the <HI>Young.</HI> Gentleman Writes to his Father, that on such a Night, (which was upon Enquiry found the very <HI>same Night,</HI>) a Gentlewoman had caressed him, thus and so (just according to the <HI>Vision,</HI>) and that his <HI>Chastity</HI> had been Conquered, if he had not been Strongly Possessed with a Sense of his Fathers <HI>Prayers</HI> over him, and <HI>Warnings</HI> unto him, for his Escape from the Pits, whereinto do fall the <HI>Abhorred of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>His other Son, <HI>John,</HI> When a Child, fell upon
<PB N="35" REF="000724_0186_0FAA47A5A8569578"/>
his Head from a Loft, Four Stories high, into the Street; from whence he was taken up for Dead, and so battered and bruised and bloody with his Fall, that it struck Horror into the Be∣holders: but Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> had a Wonderful Re∣turn of his Prayers, in the Recovery of the Child, both unto <HI>Life,</HI> and unto <HI>Sense;</HI> inso∣much, that he continued unto <HI>Old Age,</HI> a Faith∣ful, Painful, Useful Minister of the Gospel; and but lately went from the Service of the Church in <HI>Medfield,</HI> unto the Glory of the Church <HI>Tri∣umphant.</HI></P>
<P>After Mr. <HI>Wilsons</HI> arrival at <HI>New-England,</HI> his Wife, who had Left off bearing of Children for many years, brought him another <HI>Daughter;</HI> which <HI>Lamb,</HI> was indeed unto him, <HI>as a Daughter;</HI> and He would present her unto other Ministers, for their Blessing, with Great Affection, Saying <HI>This is my</HI> New-England <HI>Token!</HI> But this Child, fell Sick of a <HI>Malignant Feaver,</HI> wherein She was gone so far, that every one despaired of her Life; Except her Father, who called in several Ministers, with other Christians, unto a <HI>Fast,</HI> on that Occasion; and hearing the Prayers of Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> for her, found his Heart so Raised, that he Confidently declared, <HI>While I heard,</HI> Mr. Cot∣ton <HI>at Prayer, I was Confident the Child should Live!</HI> And the Child accordingly <HI>did</HI> Live; yea, She is to this Day alive, a very <HI>Holy Woman, Adorned like them of Old Time, with a Spirit of Great Price!</HI></P>

The <HI>Blessings</HI> Pronounced by Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> upon many Persons and Affayrs, were observed so <HI>Prophetical,</HI> and especially his Death-bed Blessings upon his Children and Grand-children were <HI>so,</HI> that the most Considerable Persons in the Coun∣trey, thought it not much, to come from far, and bring their Children with them, for the En∣joyment of his <HI>Patriarchal Benedictions,</HI> For which cause, Mr. <HI>Thomas Shepard,</HI> in an <HI>Elegy</HI> upon him, at his Death, Pathetically thus Ex∣pressed it;</P>

But it is to the <HI>Last Place</HI> in our History of <HI>this</HI> Worthy Man, that I reserve that part of his Character, which lay in his Dispo∣sition to allot unto <HI>Himself</HI> the <HI>Last Place</HI> among <HI>all</HI> Worthy Men; for his <HI>Low</HI> Opinion of him∣self, was the <HI>Top</HI> of all his other Excellencies. His <HI>Humility</HI> not only caused him, to prefer the Meanest of his <HI>Brethren,</HI> above himself, but also to Comply with the meanest Opportunities of being Serviceable: Hence t'was, that when his Voice in his Age did so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail him, that his Great Congregation could be no longer Edified by his <HI>Publick Labours,</HI> he Cheerfully and Painfully set himself to do all the Good, that he could by his <HI>Private Visits;</HI> and such also, as he could not reach with <HI>Sermons,</HI> he often <HI>found</HI> with <HI>Verses:</HI> Hence t'was, that when that plea was used with the Church of <HI>Ipswich</HI> to resign Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> unto the Church of <HI>Boston,</HI> after the Death of Mr. <HI>Cotton;</HI> Because it was said, <HI>Let him that hath two Coats give to him that hath None;</HI> and a Person of Quality replied, <HI>Boston hath One,</HI> [mean∣ing Mr. <HI>Wilson:</HI>] this Good man answered; <HI>Who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Me! I am Nothing!</HI> Yea, Hence t'was, that when Malefactors had been openly Scourged upon the just <HI>Sentence</HI> of Authority, he would presently send for them to his House, and having first expressed his Bounty to them, he would then bestow upon them such gracious Admoni∣tions
<PB N="41" REF="000724_0192_0FAA47A9E45A1F30"/>
and Exhortations, as made them to become, instead of <HI>Desperate,</HI> remarkably <HI>Penitent.</HI> Indeed, I know not whether his <HI>Humility,</HI> might not have some <HI>Excess,</HI> in some Instances charged up∣on it; at least Once, when he had Promised unto a Neighbouring Minister, to Preach a Sermon for him, and after his Promise came in Season to that Minister, saying, <HI>Sir, I told you, that I would Preach for you, but it was rashly done of me; I have on my knees begg'd the Pardon of it, from the Lord; That I should offer thus to deprive His People, of your Labours, which are so much better than any of mine can be: Wherefore, Sir, I now come Seasona∣bly to tell you, that I shall fail you!</HI> And accor∣dingly, there was no perswading of him to the contrary.</P>
<P>But from the like <HI>Humility</HI> it was, That a Good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>insman, of his, who deserves to Live in the same <HI>Story,</HI> as he now Lives in the same <HI>Hea∣ven</HI> with him, namely Mr. <HI>Edwards Rawson,</HI> the Honoured Secretary of the <HI>Massachuset</HI>-Colony, could not by all his Intreaties perswade him, to let his <HI>Picture</HI> be drawn; but still refusing it, he would reply, <HI>What! Such a Poor, Vile Creature as I am! shall my Picture be drawn? I say, No; it never shall!</HI> And when that Gentleman in∣troduced the Limner, with all things ready, Vehemently importuning him to gratify so far the Desires of his Friends, as to sit a while, for the taking of his <HI>Essigies,</HI> no Importunity
<PB N="42" REF="000724_0193_0FAA47AAAEA24738"/>
could ever obtain it from him. However, being bound in <HI>Justice</HI> to Employ <HI>my Hand,</HI> for the Memory of that Person, by <HI>whose Hand</HI> I was my self Baptised, I have made an Essay, to draw his <HI>Picture,</HI> by this Account of his <HI>Life;</HI> wherein if I have missed of doing to the <HI>Life,</HI> it might be made up, with several Expressive Passages, which I find in <HI>Elegits</HI> Written and Printed upon his <HI>Death:</HI> Whereof there were many Composed, by those, whose Opinion was well Signified by one of them:</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF Mr. JOHN DAVENPORT.</HEAD>
<P>§. 1. A Noted Author of more than Twice Seven <HI>Treatises,</HI> and Chaplain to two Successive Queens of <HI>England,</HI> was that <HI>Christopher Davenport,</HI> whose Assumed Name was, <HI>Franciscus a Sancta clara.</HI> And in Mr. <HI>Rashworth▪</HI> Collection of Speeches, made in the Celebrated Parlaiment, 1640. I find Sir, <HI>Benjamin Rudyard;</HI> using these Words; <Q><HI>Sancta Clara,</HI> hath Publish∣ed, That if a Synod were held, <HI>Non intermixti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Paritanis,</HI> Setting <HI>Puritans</HI> aside, Our <HI>Articles</HI> and, Their <HI>Religion</HI> would soon be Agreed. They have so brought it to pass, that under the

Name of <HI>Puritans,</HI> all our Religion is branded Whosoever Squares his Actions by any <HI>Rule,</HI> either Divine or Humane, He is a PURITAN: Whosoever would be Governed by the Kings <HI>Laws,</HI> He is a PURITAN!</Q>—Whether, this Account of Matters be allow'd or no; there was, though not a <HI>Brother</HI> (as a certain <HI>Woodden</HI> Historian, in his <HI>Athenae Oxonienses,</HI> has reported) yet a <HI>Kinsman</HI> of that <HI>Sancta Clara;</HI> who was among the most Eminent <HI>Puritans</HI> of those Days; And this was our <HI>Holy</HI> and <HI>Famous</HI> Mr. <HI>John Da∣venport:</HI> One of whom I may, on many Ac∣counts use the Elogy, with which the Learned still mention <HI>Salmasius, Vir <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unguam Satis Lauda∣tus, nec Temere sine Laude nominandus.</HI></P>
<P>§. 2. Mr. <HI>John Davenport,</HI> was born at <HI>Coventry,</HI> in the year 1597. of Worthy Parents; a <HI>Father,</HI> who was Mayor of the City, and a Pious <HI>Mother,</HI> who having Lived just long enough, to devote him, as <HI>Hannah</HI> did her <HI>Samuel,</HI> unto the Service of the <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> left him under the more immediate Care of Heaven to fit him for that Service. The Grace of God Sanctified him with <HI>Good Principles,</HI> while he had not yet seen Two Sevens of years in an <HI>Evil World;</HI> and by that Age he had also made such Attainments in Learning, as to be admitted into <HI>Brasen-Nose</HI> Col∣ledge in <HI>Oxford.</HI> From thence, when he was but Nineteen years Old, he was called unto Pub∣lick
<PB N="3" REF="000724_0200_0FAA46FCA97EB228"/>
and constant Preaching in the City of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> as an Assistent unto another Divine; where his Notable Accomplishments for a <HI>Minister,</HI> and his Couragious <HI>Residence</HI> with, and <HI>Visiting</HI> of, his Flock in a dreadful <HI>Plague time,</HI> caused much no∣tice to be quickly taken of him. His Degree of <HI>Master of Arts,</HI> he took not until, in Course, he was to proceed <HI>Batchelour of Divinity;</HI> and then with Universal Approbation, he Received both of these <HI>Laurels</HI> together.</P>
<P>§. 3. This Pious man was both an hard <HI>Student,</HI> and a Great <HI>Preacher.</HI> His <HI>Custome</HI> was to sit up very late at his <HI>Lucubrations;</HI> whereby, though he found no sensible Damage himself, and never felt his Head ake, yet his Counsil was that other <HI>Students</HI> would not follow his Exemple. But the Effects of his <HI>Industry</HI> were seen by all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, in his approving himself upon all Occasions, <HI>An Universal Scholar.</HI> As for the <HI>Sermons,</HI> where∣with be fed the Church of God, he <HI>Wrote</HI> them for the most part, more largely than the most of Ministers; and he <HI>Spoke</HI> them with a Gravity, an Energy, an Acceptableness, whereto few Mini∣sters ever have arrived: indeed his Greatest Enemies, when they heard him, would acknow∣ledge him to be among <HI>the best of Preachers.</HI> The <HI>Ablest men</HI> about <HI>London</HI> were his <HI>nearest Friends;</HI> among whom he held a very particular Correspondence with Dr. <HI>Preston;</HI> He, when he
<PB N="4" REF="000724_0201_0FAA46FD769655B0"/>

<P>§ 4. About the year 1626. there were se∣veral Eminent Persons, among whom were Two <HI>Doctors</HI> of Divinity, with two other Divines, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our <HI>Lawers,</HI> whereof One of Kings <HI>Sergeant</HI> at Law, and four <HI>Citizens,</HI> whereof One the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> engaged in a Design to pro∣cure a Purchase of <HI>Impropriations.</HI> and with the Profits thereof to mentain a Constant, Able, and Painful Ministry, in those parts of the Kingdom, were there was most want of such a Ministry. The <HI>Divines</HI> concerned in this Design, were Dr. <HI>Gouge,</HI> Dr. <HI>Sibs,</HI> Mr. <HI>Offspring,</HI> and our Mr. <HI>Da∣venport;</HI> and such an Incredible progress was made in it, that it is judged, all the <HI>Impropriations</HI> it; <HI>England</HI> would have been honestly and easily Recovered unto the Immediate Service of the <HI>Reformed Religion.</HI> But Bishop <HI>Laud</HI> looking with a Jealous eye on this undertaking, least it might in time give a Secret growth to <HI>Non Conformity,</HI> he obtained a Bill to be Exhibited in the <HI>Exche∣quer Chamber,</HI> by the Kings Attorney General, against the <HI>Fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffees,</HI> that had the Management of it.

§ 5. It happened that soon after this, the Famous Mr. <HI>John Cotton</HI> was fallen under such a Storm of Persecution for his <HI>Non Conformity,</HI> as made it necessary for him to propose and pur∣pose a Removal out of the Land: Whereupon, Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> with several other Great and Good men, considering the Eminent Learning, Prudence, and Holiness of that Excellent Person, could be at no Rest, until they had by a Solemn <HI>Conference</HI> inform'd themselves of what might move him to such a Resolution. The Issue of the <HI>Conference</HI> was, that instead of <HI>their</HI> Disswad∣ing <HI>him,</HI> from exposing himself to such Sufferings, as were now before him, <HI>he</HI> convinced <HI>them</HI> of the Truth in the <HI>Cause</HI> for which he Suffered and they became Satisfied both of the <HI>Evil</HI> in Sundry <HI>Matters</HI> of <HI>Worship</HI> and <HI>Order</HI> imposed up∣on them, and of the <HI>Duty,</HI> which lay upon them, in their places to endeavour the <HI>Reformation</HI> of things in the Church according to the Word of God. Mr. <HI>Davenports</HI> Inclination to <HI>Non Confor∣mity</HI> from this time, felt under the Notice, and Anger of his <HI>Diocesan;</HI> who presently determined the Marks of his Vengeance for him: Of which being Seasonably and Sufficiently advertised, he convened the Principal Persons under his Pasto∣ral Charge in <HI>Coleman-street,</HI> at a General <HI>Vestry,</HI> desiring them on this Occasion to declare, what they would advise; for, acknowledging the <HI>Right,</HI> which they had in him, as their <HI>Pastor,</HI> he would
<PB N="7" REF="000724_0204_0FAA46FFE2D294D0"/>
not, by any Danger, be driven from any Service, which they should expect or demand at his hands; but he would Imitate the Exemple of <HI>Luther,</HI> who upon Letters from the Church of <HI>Written berg,</HI> from whence he had with-drawn for his Security, upon the Direction of the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> returned unto the Couragious Exercise of his Ministry. Upon a Serious Deliberation, they Discharged his <HI>Conscentious Obligations,</HI> by Agree∣ing with him, that it would be best for him to <HI>Resign;</HI> but although he now Hoped for some∣thing of a Quiet Life, his <HI>Hope,</HI> was disappointed; for he was continually dogg'd by Raging, Busy <HI>Pursevants,</HI> from whom he had no safety but by Retiring into <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>§. 6. Over to <HI>Holland</HI> he went, in the Lat∣ter end of the year 1633. Where the Messen∣gers of the Church under the charge of Mr. <HI>Paget,</HI> met him in his way to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> inviting him to become the Collegue of their Aged Pastor. But Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI> had not been long there, be∣fore his Indisposition to the Promiscuous Baptising of <HI>Children,</HI> concerning whom there was no <HI>Cha∣ritable</HI> or <HI>Tolerable</HI> Testimony of their belonging to <HI>Christian Parents,</HI> was by Mr. <HI>Paget</HI> so improv∣ed against him, as to procure him the Displeasure of the Dutch <HI>Classes</HI> in the Neighbourhood. The <HI>Contention</HI> on this Occasion, proceeded so far, that though the Dutch Ministers had under their
<PB N="8" REF="000724_0205_0FAA4700792FFBF0"/>
Hands declared.—<HI>We desire nothing more, than that</HI> Mr. Davenport, <HI>whose Eminent Learning and Singu∣lar Piety is much approved and commended of all the English our Brethren, may be Lawfully promoted unto the Ministry of the English Church; We do also great∣ly approve of his Good Zeal and Care, of his having some precedent private Examination of the Parents, and Sureties of Children to be Baptised, in the Christi∣an Religion:</HI> Yet the matter could not be Accom∣modated; Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI> could not be allowed except he would promise to Baptise the <HI>Children</HI> of such whose <HI>Parents</HI> and <HI>Sureties</HI> were, upon Examination, found never so much <HI>Unchristianised,</HI> Ignorant or Scandalous. He, therefore, desisted from his Publick Ministry in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> about the Beginning of the year 1635. Contenting himself to set up a <HI>Catechetical Exercise</HI> in the Family, where he sojourned, on the Afternoon of the <HI>Lords Days,</HI> and Hour after the Publick Ser∣mons were over. But some considerable num∣ber of People, at Length, resorting to this Exer∣cise, a Jealousy was pretended by his Adversary, that the Design of it was to <HI>Promote</HI> such <HI>Sects,</HI> as indeed the chief Design of it was to <HI>Prevent;</HI> and, upon this pretence, he was hindered, even from this Lesser Opportunity of Doing Service also. The fuller Story of these Uncomfortable, and Unreasonable Brangles, the Reader may find in an <HI>Apologetical Discourse</HI> of Mr. <HI>Davenports,</HI> Published for his own Vindication; wherein he
<PB N="9" REF="000724_0206_0FAA47030D7D2FA0"/>
do's with a Learned Pen, handle several points much controverted in the <HI>Reformed Churches,</HI> and show himself a Divine well studied in the Con∣troversies of the Present, and the Former Ages. But the Upshot of all was, that he Returned back to <HI>London;</HI> where he told his Friends, <HI>That he thought God carried him over into</HI> Holland, <HI>on pur∣pose to bear Witness against that</HI> Promiscuous Bap∣tism, <HI>which at least Bordered very near upon a Pro∣fanation of the Holy Institution.</HI></P>
<P>§ 7. He observed, that when a <HI>Reformation</HI> of the Church has been brought about in any part of the World, it has rarely been <HI>Afterwards</HI> carried on any One step further, than the <HI>First Reformers</HI> did Succeed in their <HI>first Endeavours;</HI> He observed that as easily might the <HI>Ark</HI> have been removed from the Mountains of <HI>Ararat,</HI> where it first Grounded, as a People get any Ground in <HI>Reformation,</HI> after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beyond the <HI>first Remove</HI> of the <HI>Reformers.</HI> And this Observa∣tion quickened him to Embark in a Design of <HI>Reformation,</HI> wherein he might have Opportunity to Drive things in the <HI>First Essay▪</HI> as near to the Precept and Pattern of <HI>Scripture,</HI> as they could be driven. The Plantation of <HI>New England</HI> afforded him this Opportunity, with the Chief Undertakers whereof he had many Consultations, before he had ever taken up any Purpose of Go∣ing himself into that part of the World; and he

had, indeed, a very great stroke in the En∣couraging and Enlivening of that <HI>Noble Under∣taking.</HI> He was one of those by whom the Pa∣tent for the <HI>Massachuset</HI> Colony was procured; and though his <HI>Name</HI> were not among the <HI>Paten∣tees,</HI> because he himself desired it might be omit∣ted, Left his Enemy, the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> then of the Kings Privy. Council, should upon <HI>his</HI> Ac∣count appear the more fiercely against it, yet his <HI>Purse</HI> was in it, his <HI>Time</HI> was in it, and he contri∣buted unto it all manner of Assistences: This he did before his Going to <HI>Holland.</HI> And while he was in <HI>Holland,</HI> he received Letters of Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> from the Country whereto he had thus been a <HI>Father;</HI> telling him, <HI>That the Order of the Churches, and of the Common wealth, was now so settled in</HI> New England <HI>by common consent, that it brought into his Mind the New Heaven and the New Earth, wherein dwells Righteousness.</HI> Wherefore, soon after his Return for <HI>London,</HI> he Shipt himself with several Eminent Christians and their Families, for <HI>New England;</HI> where, by the Good Hand of God upon them, they arrived in the Summer of the year 1637.</P>

Opinions then spread abroad; but the Learning and Wisdom of this Worthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an, in the <HI>Synod</HI> then Assembled at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> did contribute more that a Little to dispel the <HI>Fascinating Mists</HI> which had suddenly disordered all our Affayres. Having done his part in that <HI>Blessed Work,</HI> (as we have else where more fully related) <HI>He,</HI> with his Friends, who were more fit for <HI>Zebulons</HI> Ports, than for <HI>Issachars</HI> Tents, chose to go farther West∣ward; Where they began a Plantation, and a Colony, since distinguished by the Name of NEW-HAVEN; and Endeavoured, according to his Understanding, a yet stricter Conformity, to the <HI>Word of God,</HI> in Settling of all Matters, both <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Sacred,</HI> than he had yet seen Exempli∣fied in any other Part of the World. There, the Famous Church of <HI>New haven,</HI> as well as the other Neighbouring Towns, Enjoyed his <HI>Ministry,</HI> his <HI>Discipline,</HI> his <HI>Government,</HI> and his Universal <HI>Di∣rection,</HI> for many years together; Even, till, after the Restoration of K. <HI>Charles</HI> II. <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and <HI>New haven,</HI> were by <HI>One Charter</HI> Incorporated. And here, with what <HI>Holiness,</HI> with what <HI>Watch∣fulness,</HI> with what <HI>Usefulness</HI> he discharged his <HI>Mi∣nistry,</HI> it is Worthy of a Remembrance, among all that would propose unto themselves a Worthy <HI>Exemple.</HI> Nevertheless, all that I shall here pre∣serve of it, is this One Article. A Young Mini∣ster, once Receiving of Wise and Good Counsils, from this Good and Wise and Great Man, he Re∣ceived

<HI>this</HI> among the rest, <HI>That he should be much in Circulatory Prayer:</HI> for indeed, <HI>Ejacula∣tory Prayers, As Arrows in the Hand of a Mighty Man, so are</HI> they, <HI>Happy is the man that has his Quiver full of them!</HI> And it was Believed, by some Curious Observers, That Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI> himself, was well used unto that Sacred skill of, <HI>Walking with God,</HI> and, <HI>Having his Eyes ever to∣wards the Lord,</HI> and, <HI>Being in the Fear of the Lord all the Day Long,</HI> by the use of <HI>Ejaculatory Prayers,</HI> on the Innumerable Occasions, which every <HI>Turn</HI> of our Livers does bring for those Devotions. He was not only Constant in more <HI>Settled,</HI> whether <HI>Social,</HI> or <HI>Secret,</HI> Prayers; but also in the midst of all Besieging Incumbrances, tying the Wishes of his Devout Soul, unto the <HI>Arrows</HI> of <HI>Ejaculatory Prayers,</HI> he would shoot them away unto the <HI>Hea∣vens,</HI> from whence he still Expected all his <HI>Help.</HI> With such a <HI>Glory,</HI> with such a <HI>Defence,</HI> was <HI>New-haven</HI> Blessed!</P>

<P>On June 6. 1662. At <HI>New haven,</HI> there was a most Unparallel'd Wretch, one <HI>Potter</HI> by Name, about Sixty years of Age, Executed for Damnable <HI>Bestialities;</HI> although this Wretch, had been for now Twenty years, a Member of

the Church in that Place, and kept up among the holy People of God there, a Reputation, for Serious Christianity. It seems that the <HI>Unclean Devil,</HI> which had the possession of this Monster, had carried all his Lusts with so much Fury into this One Channel of Wickedness, that there was no Notice taken of his being Wicked in any other. Hence t'was, that he was <HI>De∣vout</HI> in Worship, <HI>Gifted</HI> in Prayer, <HI>Forward</HI> in Edifying Discourse among the Religious, and <HI>Zealous</HI> in Reproving the Sins of the other Peo∣ple; Every one counted him, <HI>A Saint:</HI> And he Enjoy'd such a <HI>Peace</HI> in his own mind, that in several Fits of Sickness, wherein he seem'd <HI>Nigh unto Death,</HI> he seem'd <HI>Willing to Dy;</HI> Yea, <HI>Death</HI> (he said) <HI>Smiled on him.</HI> Nevertheless, this Diabolical Creature, had Lived in most infandous <HI>Buggeries</HI> for no less than Fifty years together; and now at the Gallows, there were killed before his Eyes, a <HI>Cow,</HI> Two <HI>Heifers,</HI> Three <HI>Sheep,</HI> and Two <HI>Sowes,</HI> with all of which he had Committed his <HI>Bru∣talities.</HI> His <HI>Wife</HI> had seen him Confounding himself with a <HI>Bitch,</HI> Ten years before; and he then Excused his Filthiness, as well as he could, unto her, but Conjured her to keep it Secret: but he afterwards Hanged that Fitch himself, and then Returned unto his for∣mer Villanies, until <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> last, his <HI>Son,</HI> saw him hideously converting with a <HI>Sow.</HI> By these

means, the burning <HI>Jealousy</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, at Length <HI>made the Churches to know,</HI> that He had all this while seen the Covered Filthi∣ness of this Hellish Hypocrite, and Exposed him also to the Just Judgment of Death, from the Civil Court of Judicature. Very Remar∣kable had been the Warnings, which this <HI>Hell∣Hound,</HI> had Received from Heaven, to Repent of his Impieties. Many years before this, he had a Daughter, who Dreamt a <HI>Dream,</HI> which caused her, in her Sleep, to cry out most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣terly; and her Father, then with much ado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> obtaining of her, to tell her <HI>Dream,</HI> She told him, she Dream't, that she was among a great Multitude of People, to see an <HI>Execution,</HI> and it prov'd her own <HI>Father</HI> that was to be hang'd, at whose Turning over, she thus cryed out. This happened, before the Time, that any of his Cursed Practices were known unto her! At another Time, when there was a Malefactor adjudged in those parts to Dy, for the very same Transgressions, which this Rotten Fellow was guilty of, 'the Governour with some of the Magistrates, most unaccountably, without, any manner of Reason, for their so doing, turn'd about unto this Fellow, and said, <HI>What think You? Is not this man worthy to Dy?</HI> He now Confessed, That these Warnings, did so awaken his Conscience, as to make him, for a Time, Leave off his lately al Debauches; and
<PB N="21" REF="000724_0218_0FAA470FDD81D540"/>
so, he said, <HI>He thought, all was Pardoned, all was well with him.</HI> Nevertheless, he Return'd unto his <HI>Vomit,</HI> and his <HI>Quagmire,</HI> until the Sentence of Death, at last fell upon him; and then he acknowledged, That he had Lived in the Sin of <HI>Bestiality,</HI> ever since he was Ten years Old, but had sometimes Intermitted the Perpetration of it, for some years together. During his Imprisonment, he continued in a <HI>Sottish,</HI> and <HI>Stupid,</HI> frame of Spirit, and mar∣vellously <HI>Secure</HI> about his Everlasting <HI>Pardon</HI> and <HI>Welfare:</HI> but the Church whereto he be∣longed, kept a Solemn Day of <HI>Humiliation</HI> on this Occasion, wherein Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI> Preach∣ed on Josh. 22. 20. <HI>Did not Achan Commit a▪ Trespass, in the Accursed Thing, and Wrath fell on all the Congregation of Israel?</HI> And in the close of the <HI>Fast,</HI> that Faithful People of God, Excommunicated this <HI>Accursed Achan,</HI> from their own Society. But as I have seen <HI>Be∣witched Self Poisoners,</HI> under a Singular Energy of some <HI>Devil,</HI> obstinately Refuse all offered, Relief, until the Poisons had prevailed so far that all Relief was too late, and then with roaring Agonies they would have given Ten Worlds for it; So this <HI>Bewitched Beast,</HI> that, had not been afraid of Dying, till he came to the Place of Execution, when he came <HI>There,</HI> he was Awakened into a most Unut∣terable and Intolerable Anguish of Soul, and
<PB N="22" REF="000724_0219_0FAA471027B3DD38"/>
made most Lamentably Desperate Out-cryes; Among which Out-cryes, he warned men, par∣ticularly, to <HI>Take heed of Neglecting Secret Prayer;</HI> which he said, <HI>had been his Bane.</HI> He said, he never used <HI>Secret Prayer</HI> in his Life, and that he frequently omitted <HI>Family-Prayer</HI> too; Yet, he said, he had <HI>Prayed</HI> and <HI>Sinned,</HI> and <HI>Sinned</HI> and <HI>Prayed;</HI> namely, by <HI>Ejaculations,</HI> with which he Contented himself, throwing <HI>Set-Prayer</HI> aside.

Aged <HI>Seventy two</HI> years, he was by an <HI>Apo∣plexy</HI> fetcht away to that Glorious World, where the <HI>Spirits</HI> of <HI>Cotton</HI> and <HI>Davenport,</HI> are together in Heaven, as their <HI>Bodies</HI> are now in <HI>One Tomb</HI> on Earth.</P>

§. 13. His Constant and Various Em∣ployments otherwise, would not permit him to Leave many Printed Effects of his Judicious Industry, besides those <HI>Few</HI> already mentioned: although he were so close and bent a <HI>Student,</HI> that the rude Pagans themselves took much notice of it, and the Indian Salvages in the Neighbour-hood, would call him, <HI>So Big Study▪ Man.</HI> Only there is in the Hands of the <HI>Faithful,</HI> a Savory Treatise of his, Entituled, <HI>The Saints Anchor-hold;</HI> in the Preface whereof a <HI>Duumvirate</HI> of Renowned men, to wit, Mr. <HI>Hook</HI> and Mr. <HI>Caryl,</HI> give this Attestation, <Q>As touching the <HI>Author</HI> of this Treatise, in whose Heart the <HI>Text</HI> was written by the Finger of God, before the Discourse was Penned by his own Hand; His <HI>Piety, Learning, Gravity, Experience, Judgment,</HI> do not more commend him to all that know him, than this Work of his may commend it self to them that read it.</Q> The <HI>Christian Faith</HI> has also been Solidly and Learnedly mentain'd by him; in a Discourse, long since, Published, for the <HI>De∣monstration of our Blessed Jesus, to be the True Messias.</HI> Nor would I forget a Sermon of his on 2 Sam. 23. 3. at the Anniversary Court of <HI>Election</HI> at <HI>Boston</HI> 1669. afterwards Published: And among the many <HI>Epistles</HI> which he hath prefix'd unto the Books of other Authors, I

know not whether his Excellent Epistle be∣fore Mr. <HI>Scudders Dayly-Walk,</HI> may not, for the worth of it, be Reckoned it self a <HI>Book:</HI> as the Book it self, was the Directory of his own <HI>Duyly-Walk.</HI> Moreover, there is Published a Treatise of his, under this Title, <HI>The Power of Congregational Churches;</HI> in the Preface where of, Mr. <HI>Nathanael, Mather,</HI> (at this Time, the Worthy, and Well-known, Pastor of <HI>such</HI> a Church in the City of <HI>London</HI>) has these very Signifi∣cant Expressions concerning him. <HI>Certain it is, The Principles held forth in this Treatise, cost the Reverend Author, not only many Sufferings, but also many, very many sad Searchings, and much Reading and Study on set purpose, accompanied with manifold Prayers and Cryes to the Father of Lights, for Light therein. After all which, he was more confirmed in them, and attained to such comfortable Clearness therein, as bore him up with much inward Peace and Satisfaction, under all his Afflictions on the Account of his Perswasion in these points. And so perswaded Lived, and so Dyed, this Grave and Serious Spirited Man!</HI> There is likewise Published, <HI>A Discourse about Civil Government, in a New-Plantation, whose De∣sign is Religion;</HI> in the Title-Page whereof, the Name of Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> is, by a Mistake, put for that of Mr. <HI>Davenport.</HI> And there was lately transcribed for the Press, from his Notes, a Large Volumn of Accurate and Elaborate
<PB N="27" REF="000724_0224_0FAA4713F0437418"/>
Sermons, on the whole Book of <HI>Canticles.</HI> But the <HI>Death</HI> of the Gentleman chiefly con∣cerned in the Intended Impression, proved the <HI>Death</HI> of the Impression it self.</P>
<P>§. 14. To Conclude: There will be but an <HI>Unjust Account</HI> given of the Things Preached and Written, by this Reverend Man, if we do not mention one Singular Favour of Heaven unto him. It is well known, That in the Earliest of the <HI>Primitive Times,</HI> the Faithful did in a Literal Sense, Believe, the <HI>Second Coming</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the <HI>Rising</HI> and the <HI>Reigning</HI> of the <HI>Saints</HI> with Him, a <HI>Thousand Years</HI> before the <HI>Rest of the Dead Live again:</HI> A Doctrine, which however some of Later years have counted it <HI>Heretical,</HI> Yet, in the Dayes of <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> was question'd by none but such as were counted <HI>Hereticks.</HI> Tis Evident from <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> that this Doctrine of the <HI>Chiliad,</HI> was in his Dayes Embraced, among all <HI>Orthodox Christians;</HI> nor did this <HI>Kingdom</HI> of our Lord, begin to be doubted until the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of Antichrist began to advance into a Considerable Figure; and then it fell chiefly under the Reproaches of such men, as were faign to Deny the Divine Authority of the Book of <HI>Revelation,</HI> and of the Second Epistle of <HI>Peter.</HI> He is a Stranger to Antiquity, who does not find and own

the Ancients generally of the Perswasion, which is Excellency Summ'd up, in those Words of <HI>Lactantius, Veniet Summi et maximi Dei Filius. Verum ILLE, cum deleverit Injustitiam, Judici∣umque maximum fecerit, ac. Justos, qui a Princi∣pio fuerunt, ad vitam Restauraverit, MILLE ANNIS inter Homines Versabitur, cosque Justiffimo Imperto reget.</HI> Nevertheless, at Last, Men came, not only to lay aside the Mo∣desty Expressed, by One of the first Consi∣derable <HI>Anti-Millenaries,</HI> namely <HI>Jerom,</HI> when he said, <HI>Quae Licet non Sequamur, tamen Con∣demnare non Possumus, eo quod multi Virorum Ecclesiasticorum et Martyrum, ista dixerint:</HI> but also with Violence to persecute the <HI>Millenary Truth</HI> as an <HI>Heretical Pravity.</HI> So the <HI>Mystery</HI> of our Lords <HI>Appearing in his Kingdom,</HI> lay buried in Popish Darkness, till the light there∣of hath had a fresh <HI>Dawn,</HI> since the <HI>Antichrist</HI> entred into the Last <HI>Half Time</HI> of the Period allotted for him; and <HI>Now,</HI> within the Last few Sevens of years, as things grow nearer to Accomplishment, Learned and Pious Men, in Great Numbers every where, come to Re∣ceive, Explain, and Mentain, the <HI>Old Faith</HI> about it. But here was the Special Favour of Heaven, to our <HI>Davenport,</HI> That so many years ago, When in both <HI>Englands,</HI> the True Notion of the <HI>Chiliad,</HI> was hardly apprehend∣ed by as many Divines of Note, as there
<PB N="29" REF="000724_0226_0FAA471560293EF0"/>
are Mouths of <HI>Nilus,</HI> Yet this Worthy Man, <HI>Clearly Saw</HI> into it; and both Preach't and Wrote, Those very Things, about the <HI>Future State,</HI> the <HI>Coming</HI> of the Lord, the <HI>Calling</HI> of the Jews, and the First and Second <HI>Re∣surrection</HI> of the Dead, which do now of Late years get more ground against the Opposi∣tion of the <HI>otherwise minded,</HI> and find a kinder Entertainment among them that <HI>Search the Scriptures:</HI> and whereof he afterwards, when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an <HI>Old Man,</HI> gave the World a Little Tast, in a Judicious Preface before a most Learned and Nervous Treatise, composed by one that was then a <HI>Young Man,</HI> about, <HI>The Mystery of the Salvation of Israel.</HI> Even, <HI>Then,</HI> so long ago, it was, that he asserted, <HI>A Per∣sonal, Visible, Powerful, and Glorious Coming of the LORD JESUS CHRIST unto JUDG∣MENT, Long before the End of the World.</HI> But thus we take our Leave of this Renowned Man, and Leave him <HI>Resting</HI> in Hope, to <HI>Stand in his Lot,</HI> at that END.</P>

<P>Although the Providence of Heaven, whereby the <HI>Bunds of People are set,</HI> hath carried you so far <HI>West∣ward,</HI> that some have pleasantly said, <HI>The Last Corflict with Antichrist must be in your Colony, yet</HI> I believe, you do not reckon your selves Removed beyond the reach of <HI>Temptation</HI> and <HI>Corruption.</HI> 'Tis a Great World that you have done, for our Lord Jesus Christ, in For∣ming Colony of <HI>Evange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iea Churches</HI> for Him, where Satan alone and Raigned without Control in all for∣mer Ages: but your Incomparable HOOKER, who was one of the Greatest in the Foundation of that <HI>Work,</HI> was in his Day, well aware, that Satan would make all the Hast he could, unhappily to get all Buri∣ed in the <HI>Degeneracies</HI> of <HI>I</HI>gnorance, Worldliness, and Profanitie. To Advise you of your Dangers, and uphold the <HI>Life of Religion</HI> among you, I presume Humbly to Lay before you, the <HI>Life</HI> of that Excellent Man, who for Learning, Wisdom, and <HI>Religion,</HI> was a Pattern well worthy of perpetual Consideration.

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF Mr. THOMAS HOOKER.</HEAD>
<P N="1">§. 1. WHEN <HI>Toxaris</HI> met with his Countryman <HI>Ana∣charsis</HI> in <HI>Athens,</HI> he gave him this Invitati∣on, <HI>Come along with me, and I will shew Thee at once all the Wonders of Greece:</HI> whereupon he shewed him <HI>Solon,</HI> as the Person in whom there Centered all the Glories of that City or Countrey. I shall now Invite my Reader to Behold at once the <HI>Wonders</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> and it is in one THOMAS HOOKER that he shall behold them: Even in that <HI>Hooker,</HI> whom a Worthy Writer would needs call, <HI>Saints</HI> HOOKER, for the same <HI>Reason,</HI> (he said)
<PB N="4" REF="000724_0231_0FAA471ADDE146D8"/>
and with the same <HI>Freedom,</HI> that <HI>Latymer,</HI> would speak of <HI>Saint</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ILNEY, in his Com∣memorations. Tis that HOOKER, of whom I may venture to say, that the famous <HI>Romanist,</HI> who wrote a Book, <HI>De Tribus THOMIS,</HI> or, <HI>of Three THOMASes,</HI> meaning THOMAS the <HI>Apostle, THOMAS Becket,</HI> and Sir <HI>THOMAS MORE,</HI> did not a thousandth part so well sort his THOMAS's, as a <HI>New Englander</HI> might; if he should write a Book, <HI>De Duckus THOMIS,</HI> or, <HI>Of Two THOMAS's;</HI> and with THOMAS the <HI>Apostle,</HI> joyn our Celebrious THOMAS HOOK∣ER: my <HI>One</HI> THOMAS, even our <HI>Apostoli∣cal</HI> HOOKER, would in <HI>Just Ballances</HI> weigh down two of Campians Rebellious <HI>Archbishops,</HI> or bigotted <HI>Lord-Chancellours.</HI></P>
<P N="2">§ 2. This our HOOKER, was Born at <HI>Marfield</HI> in <HI>Leicester▪ shire,</HI> about the Year 1586. of Parents that were neither Unable, nor Un∣willing, to bestow upon him a <HI>Liberal Edu∣cation;</HI> whereto the Early and Lively Sparkles of Wit observed in him, old very much En∣courage them. His Natural Temper was Cheerful and Courteous, but it was accom∣panied with such a sensible <HI>Grandeur of Mind,</HI> as caused his Friends, without the Help of Astrology, to Prognosticate that he was Born to be <HI>Considerable.</HI> The Influence which he had upon the Reformation of some Growing
<PB N="5" REF="000724_0232_0FAA471B68441B00"/>
Abuses, when he was one of the <HI>Procters</HI> in the University, was a Thing, that more eminently Signalized him, when his more publick Appea∣rance in the Worl§d was coming on: which was attended with an Advancement unto a <HI>Fellowship</HI> in <HI>Emanuel</HI> Colle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge in <HI>Cambridge;</HI> the Students whereof were Originally Design∣ed for the Study of <HI>Divinity.</HI></P>
<P N="3">§ 3. With what Ability and Fidelity be acquitted himself in his <HI>Fellowship,</HI> it was a Thing sensible unto the whole University. And it was while he was in this Employ∣ment, that the more Effectual <HI>Grace</HI> of God, gave him the Experience of a true <HI>Regenera∣tion.</HI> It pleased the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God very Pow∣erfully to break into the Soul of this person, with such a Sense of his being Exposed unto the Just <HI>Wrath</HI> of Heaven, as fill'd him with most unusual Degrees of Horror and Anguish, which broke not only his <HI>Rest,</HI> but his <HI>Heart</HI> also, and caused him to cry out, <HI>While I suffer thy Terrors, O Lord, I am Distracted!</HI> While he long had a Soul Harassed with such Distres∣ses, he had a singular Help in the Prudent and Piteous Carriage of Mr. <HI>Ash,</HI> who was the Sizer, that then waited upon him; and attended him, with such Discreet and Proper Compassions, as made him afterwards to Re∣spect him highly all his Dayes. He after∣wards
<PB N="6" REF="000724_0233_0FAA471C820E13C8"/>
gave this Account of himself, <HI>That in the time of his Agonies, he could Reason himself to the Rule, and Conclude that there was no way but Submission to God, and Lying, at the Foot of his Mercy in Christ Jesus, and waiting humbly there, till He should please to perswade the Soul of his Favour: nevertheless when he came to apply this Rule unto himself in his own Condition, his Reasoning would fall him, he was able to Do nothing.</HI> Having bin a considerable while thus Troubled with such Impressions from the <HI>Spirit of Bondage,</HI> as were to fit him for the Great Services and Enjoy∣ments, which God intended him; at length he Received the <HI>Spirit of Adoption,</HI> with well groun∣ded Perswasions of his Interest in the New-Covenant. It became his manner, at his Lying down for Sleep in the Evening, to Single out some certain <HI>Promise</HI> of God, which he would Repeat, and Ponder, and Keep his Heart close unto it, until he found that satisfaction of Soul where∣with he could say, <HI>I will Lay me down in Peace, and Sleep; for thou, O Lord, makest me Dwell in Assurance.</HI> And he would afterwards Counsel others to take the same Course; telling them, <HI>That the Promise was the Boat, which was to carry a Perishing Sinner over unto the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="4">§ 4. Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> being now well got through the S<HI>torm</HI> of Soul, which had Helped him unto a most <HI>Experimental Acquaintance</HI> with the Truths
<PB N="7" REF="000724_0234_0FAA471CE561C360"/>
of the Gospel, and the way of Employing and Applying those Truths, he was willing to Serve the Church of God in the <HI>Mini∣stry,</HI> whereto he was Devoted. At his first leaving of the University, he Sojourned in the House of Mr. <HI>Drake,</HI> a Gentleman of great Note, not far from <HI>London;</HI> whose worthy Comfort being Visited with such Di∣stresses of Soul, as Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> himself had passed through, it proved an unspeakable advantage unto both of them, that he had that opportunity of being Serviceable; for, indeed, he now had no <HI>Superiour,</HI> and scarce any <HI>Equal,</HI> for the Skill of Treating a <HI>Trou∣bled Soul.</HI> When he left Mr. <HI>Drakes</HI> Family, he did more publickly and frequently Preach about <HI>London;</HI> and in a little time, he grew famous for his Ministerial Abilities, but es∣pecially for his Notable Faculty at the wise and fit management of <HI>Wounded Spirits.</HI> How∣ever he was not Ambitious to Exercise his Ministry among the <HI>Great Ones</HI> of the World, from whom the most of Preferment might be expected: but in this, Imitating the Ex∣ample and Character of our blessed Saviour, of whom 'tis noted, that according to the Prophesie of <HI>Isatah,</HI> by Him, <HI>The Poor had the Gospel Preached unto them;</HI> he chose to be where great numbers of <HI>the Poor</HI> might Re∣ceive the <HI>Gospel</HI> from him.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="8" REF="000724_0235_0FAA471DADED6688"/>
§ 5. About this time it was, the Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> grew into a most intimate Acquaintance with Mr. <HI>Rogers</HI> of <HI>Dedham;</HI> who so highly valued him for his Multitarious Abilities, that he used and gained many Endeavours to get him Settled at <HI>Colchester;</HI> whereto Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> did very much Incline, because of its being so near to <HI>Dedham,</HI> where he might Enjoy the <HI>Labours</HI> &amp; <HI>Lectures</HI> of Mr. <HI>Rogers,</HI> whom he would some∣times call, <HI>The Prince of all the Preachers in En∣gland.</HI> But the Providence of God gave an Obstruction to that Settlement; and, indeed, it was an Observation, which Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> would sometimes afterwards use unto his Friends, <HI>That the Providence of God often Diverted him from Em∣ployment in such Places, as he himself Desired, and still Directed him to such Places, as he had no thoughts of.</HI> Accordingly, <HI>Chelmsford</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> a Town of great Concourse, wanting one to <HI>Break the Bread of Life</HI> unto them; and hear∣ing the Fame of Mr. <HI>Hooker's</HI> Powerful Mini∣stry; Addressed him to become their <HI>Lecturer:</HI> and he accepted their Offer about the Year 1626. becoming not only their <HI>Lecturer,</HI> but also on the Lord's Dayes, an <HI>Assistent</HI> unto one Mr. <HI>Mitchel,</HI> the Incumbent of the Place; who though he were a <HI>Smaller,</HI> yet being a <HI>Godly</HI> Person, gladly Encouraged Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> &amp; Liv'd with him in a most Comfortable Amity.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="9" REF="000724_0236_0FAA471E6137F3B8"/>
§ 6. Here his Lecture was exceedingly Fre∣quented, and proportionably Succeeded; and the Light of his Ministry shone through the whole County of <HI>Essex.</HI> There was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are mixture of <HI>Pleasure</HI> and <HI>Profit</HI> in his Preachi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; and his Hearers felt those penetrating Impres∣sions of his Ministry upon their Souls, which caused them to Reverence him, as, <HI>A Teacher sent from God.</HI> He had a most excellent Facul∣ty at the <HI>Applications</HI> of his Doctrine; and he would therein so Touch the <HI>Consciences</HI> of his Auditors, that a Judicious Person would say of him, <HI>He was the Best at an Use that ever he heard.</HI> Hereby there was a great Reformation wrought, not only in the <HI>Town,</HI> but in the Adjacent <HI>Countrey;</HI> from all parts whereof they came to <HI>Hear the Wisdom of the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> in His Gospel, by this worthy man Dispensed: and some of great Quality among the rest, would often Resort from far to his Assembly; parti∣cularly the truly Noble Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of <HI>Warwick,</HI> whose Countenance of Good Ministers, procured more <HI>Prayers</HI> to God for him, than most Noble Men in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>When he first Set up his Lecture, there was more <HI>Prophaneness</HI> than <HI>Devotion</HI> in the Town: and the Multitude of <HI>Inns</HI> and <HI>Shops</HI> in the Town produced one particular Disorder, of <HI>Peoples</HI> filling the Streets with unsuitable Beha∣viours,
<PB N="10" REF="000724_0237_0FAA4720A679BF28"/>
after the Publick Services of the <HI>Lords-Day</HI> were over. But by the Power of his <HI>Mi∣nistry</HI> in Publick, and by the Prudence of his Carriage in Private, he quickly cleared the Streets of this Disorder, and the <HI>Sabbath</HI> came to be very visibly Sanctified among the People.</P>
<P N="7">§ 7. The <HI>Joy</HI> of the People in this <HI>Light</HI> was <HI>but for a Season.</HI> The Conscientious Non-Conformity of Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> to some Rites of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> then vigorously pressed, especially upon such Able and Useful Ministers, as were most likely to be Laid aside by their scrupling of those Rites; made it necessary for him to Lay down his Ministry in <HI>Chelmsford,</HI> when he had been about four years there, Em∣ployed in it. Hereupon, at the Request of several Eminent Persons, he kept a <HI>School,</HI> in <HI>his own Hired House,</HI> having our▪ Mr. <HI>John Eliot</HI> for his <HI>Usher,</HI> at little <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>addow</HI> not far from <HI>Chelmsford;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he managed his Charge with such Discretion, such Authority, and such Effi∣cacy, that, able to do more with a <HI>Word,</HI> or a <HI>Look,</HI> than most other men could have done by a <HI>Severer Discipline,</HI> he did very great <HI>Service</HI> to the Church of God, in the Education of such, as afterwards proved themselves not a little <HI>Serviceable.</HI> I have in my Hands, a Ma∣nuscript, written by the Hands of our Blessed ELIOI, wherein he gives a very <HI>Great</HI> Account
<PB N="11" REF="000724_0238_0FAA47217B4CB5B8"/>
of the Little <HI>Academy</HI> then mentained in the <HI>House</HI> of Mr. <HI>Hooker:</HI> and among other things, he says, <HI>To this place I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, through the In∣finite Riches of Gods Mercy in Christ Jesus to my poor Soul: For here the Lord said unto my Dead Soul,</HI> Live; <HI>and through the Grace of Christ, I do Live, and I shall Live for ever! When I came to this Blessed Family, I then saw, and never before, the Power of Godliness, in its Lively Vigour and Efficacy.</HI></P>
<P N="8">§ 8. While he continued thus in the <HI>Heart</HI> of <HI>Essex,</HI> and in the <HI>Hearts</HI> of the People there, he signalized his <HI>Usefulness</HI> in many other Instan∣ces.</P>
<P>The Godly Ministers round about the Coun∣trey, would have Recourse unto him to be Di∣rected and Resolved, in their <HI>Diffic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Cases;</HI> and it was by his means that those Godly Ministers held their <HI>Monthly Meetings</HI> for <HI>Fasting</HI> and <HI>Pray∣er,</HI> and profitable <HI>Conferences.</HI> 'Twas the <HI>E</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of his <HI>Consultations</HI> also, that such Godly Mini∣sters, came to be here and there Settled in several parts of the County; and many others came to be better establish'd in some great points of Chri∣stianity, by being in his Neighbourhood and Ac∣quaintance. He was indeed, a <HI>General Blessing</HI> to the Church of God! But that which hin∣dred is Taking his Degree of <HI>Batch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lour in Divinity,</HI> must also it seems hinder his being a
<PB N="12" REF="000724_0239_0FAA472241D45A70"/>
<HI>Preacher of Divinity;</HI> namely his being a <HI>Non-Conformist</HI> unto some things, whereof true <HI>Divi∣nity</HI> could not approve. And indeed that which made the Silencing of Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> more unaccountable was, That no less than <HI>Seven and Forty</HI> Conformable Ministers of the Neighbour∣ing Town, understanding that the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> pretended Mr. <HI>Hookers</HI> Ministry, to be Injurious or Offensive to them, Subscribed a Petition to the <HI>Bishop,</HI> for his Continuance in the Ministry at <HI>Chelmsford;</HI> in which Petition, though he was of a Perswasion so Different from them, yet they Testify in so many words, <HI>That they esteem and know the said Mr.</HI> Thomas Hooker, <HI>to be for Doctrine, Orthodox; for Life and Conversation, Honest; for Disposition, Peaceable, and in no wise Turbulent or Factions.</HI> And yet all would not avail: <HI>Bonus vir</HI> Hook∣erus, <HI>sed id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o ma'us, quia Puritanus.</HI></P>

<P N="10">§ 10 As his <HI>Person</HI> was thus Adorned with a well▪ grounded Learning, so his <HI>Preaching</HI> was notably set off with a <HI>Liveliness</HI> Extraor∣dinary: insomuch that I cannot give a <HI>fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er,</HI> and yet <HI>briefer</HI> Description of him, than that which I find given of <HI>Bucholtzer;</HI> that Pattern of <HI>Preachers,</HI> before him; <HI>Vivida in to omnia fuerunt, vivida vox, vividi oculi, vividae manus, gestus omnes vividi:</HI> he <HI>was</HI> all that he was, and he <HI>did</HI> all that he did, <HI>Unto the Life:</HI> He not only had that which <HI>Quintilian</HI> calls, <HI>A Natural Moveableness of Soul,</HI> whereby the Distinct <HI>Images</HI> of Things would come so nimbly, and yet so <HI>fitly,</HI> into his mind, that

us;</HI> and thereupon with an Intention to make sport, unto <HI>Chemsford</HI> Lecture they came. The man had not been long in the Church, before the <HI>Quick and Powerful Word</HI> of God, in the mouth of His Faithful <HI>Hooker,</HI> pierced the Soul of him; he came out with an Awakened and a Distressed Soul, and by the further Blessing of God upon Mr. <HI>Hooker's</HI> Ministry, he arrived unto a true <HI>Conversion;</HI> for which cause he would not afterwards Leave that Blessed Mini∣stry, but went a <HI>Thousand Leagues</HI> to Attend it, and Enjoy it. Another Memorable Thing of this kind, was this; It was Mr <HI>Hooker's</HI> manner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a year to visit his Native County: and in one of those Visits, he had an Invitation to Preach in the Great Church of <HI>Leicester.</HI> One of the chief Burgesses in the Town, much Op∣posed his Preaching there; and when he could not prevail to hinder it, he set certain <HI>Fiders</HI> a work to Disturb him, in the <HI>Church-porch,</HI> or <HI>Churcheyard.</HI> But such was the Vivacity of Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> as to proceed in what he was about, without either the Damping of his <HI>Mind,</HI> or the Drowning of his <HI>Voice;</HI> whereupon the Man himself went unto the <HI>Church▪Door,</HI> to over-hear what he said.

<P N="11">§ 11. The <HI>Spiritual Court,</HI> Sitting at <HI>Chelmsford,</HI> about the year 1630. had not only Silenced Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> but also bound him over in a Bond of <HI>Fifty Pound,</HI> to appear before the H<HI>igh Commissi∣on,</HI> which he could not now attend, because of an <HI>Ague</HI> then upon him. One of his Hearers, namely Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> a very honest Yeoman, that Rented a great Farm of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> at <HI>Much▪ Waltham,</HI> was Bound in that Sum for his Appearance; but as P<HI>aul</HI> was advised by his Friends, that he would not venture into the Theatre at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> thus Mr. H<HI>ooker's</HI> Friends advised him to Forfeit his Bonds, rather than throw him e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r any further into the Hands of his Enemies. Wherefore, when the Day for his Appearance came, his honest Surety being Reimbursed by several good People in and near <HI>Chelmsford,</HI> sent in the forfeited Sum into the Court; and Mr. H<HI>ooker</HI> having, by the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> a courteous and private Recess pro∣vided for his Family, at a place called <HI>Old Park,</HI> for which I find, the Thanks of Dr. <HI>Hill</HI> afterwards publickly given in his Dedi∣cation of Mr. <HI>Fenners</HI> Treatise about <HI>Impenitency;</HI> He went over to H<HI>olland.</HI> In his Passage

The Misunderstandings Operated so far, as to occasion Mr. <HI>Hooker's</HI> Removal from <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> notwithstanding he had so fully expressed himself, when in his Answer to one of Mr. <HI>Paget's</HI> Questions, he declared, in these words, <HI>To Separate from the Faithfull Assemblies and Churches in</HI> England, <HI>as no Churches, is an Error in Judgment, and Sin in Practice, held and mentained by the</HI> Brownists; <HI>and therefore to Communicate with them in their Opinion or Practice, is sinful and utterful unlawful: and care should be taken to prevent Offence, either by Encouraging them in their way, or by Drawing others to a further Approbation of that way than is meet.

were then Settled. The Text whereon he first Preached at his coming thither, was Phil. 1. 29. <HI>To you it is given not only to Believe, but also to Suffer;</HI> and after that Sermon, Mr. <HI>Forbs</HI> ma∣nifested a strong Desire to Enjoy the Fellowship of Mr <HI>Hooker</HI> in the Week of the Gospel; which he did for about the space of two years: in all which time they Lived so like Brethren, that an Observer might say of them, as they said of <HI>Basil</HI> and <HI>Nazianzen, They were but One Soul in two Bodies;</HI> and it they had been for any little while asunder, they still met with such Friendly and Joyful Congratulations as Testified a most affectionate satisfaction in each others Company.</P>
<P N="13">§ 13. At the end of two years, he had a Call to <HI>Rotterdam;</HI> which he the more heartily and readily Accepted, because it Renewed his Acquaintance with his Invaluable Dr. <HI>Ames,</HI> who had newly Left his Place in the <HI>Frisian</HI> University. With him he spent the Residue of his Time in <HI>Holland,</HI> and Assisted him in Composing some of his Discourses, which are, <HI>His Fresh Suit against the Ceremonies:</HI> for such was the Regard which Dr. <HI>Ames</HI> had for him, that notwithstanding his vast Ability and Expe∣rience, yet when i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> came to the <HI>Narrow</HI> of any Question about the <HI>Instituted Worship of God,</HI> he would still propels himself Conquered by Mr.

<HI>Hookers</HI> Reason; Declaring, that <HI>though he had been Acquainted with many Scholars of divers Na∣tions, yet he never met with Mr.</HI> Hookers <HI>Equal, either for Preaching or for Disputing.</HI> But having tarried in <HI>Holland</HI> long enough to see the State of Religion in the Churches there, he became satisfied, that it was neither Eligible for <HI>him</HI> to tarry in that Country, nor Convenient for <HI>his Friends</HI> to be Invited thither after him. I have at this time in my Hands, his Letter from <HI>Ro∣terdam</HI> to Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> wherein are these words; <Q>The State of these Provinces to my weak eye, seems wonderfully ticklish and miserable. For the better part, <HI>Heart-Religion,</HI> They con∣tent themselves with very Form<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, tho' much Blemished; but the Power of Godliness, for ought I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> see or hear, they know not; and if it were thoroughly pressed, I fear least it will be fiercely opposed. My Ague yet holds me; the wayes of Gods Providence, wherein He has walked towards me, in this long time of my Sickness, and wherein I have drawn forth many wearyish Hours, under His Al∣mighty Hand (Blessed be His Name) toge∣ther with Pursuits and Banishment, which have waited upon me, as one Wave follows another, have driven me to an Amazement: His Paths being too secret and past finding out by such an Ignorant, Worthless Worm as my self.

<P N="14">§ 14. Returning into <HI>England</HI> in order to a further Voyage, he was quickly Scented by the Pursevants; who at length got so far up with him, as to knock at the Door of that very Chamber, where he was now Discoursing with Mr. <HI>Stone;</HI> who was now become his Designed Companion and Assistent for the <HI>New English</HI> Enterprize. Mr. <HI>Stone</HI> was at the Instant Smoking of <HI>Tobacco;</HI> for which Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> had been Reproving him, as being then used by few persons of Sobriety; being also of a sudden and pleasant Wit, he stept unto the Door, with his P<HI>ipe</HI> in his mouth, &amp; such an <HI>Air</HI> of Speech and Look, as gave him some Credit with the

The Officer Demanded, <HI>Whether</HI> Mr. Hooker <HI>were not there?</HI> Mr. <HI>Stone</HI> replyed with a braving sort of Confidence, <HI>What</HI> Hooker? <HI>Do you mean</HI> Hooker <HI>that Liv'd once at</HI> Chelmsford!

his Reception; with open aims he Embraced them, and uttered these words, <HI>Now I Live, if you stand stast in the Lord.</HI> But such multitudes stocked over to <HI>New England</HI> after them, that the Plantation of <HI>New-Town</HI> became too straight for them; and it was Mr. <HI>Hookers</HI> Advice that they should not Incur the Danger of a <HI>Sitna, on an Esek,</HI> where they might have a <HI>Rehoboth,</HI> Accordingly in the Month of <HI>June</HI> 1636. they Removed an Hundred miles to the Westward, with a purpose to Settle upon the Delightful Banks of <HI>Connecticut River:</HI> and there were a∣bout an Hundred Persons in the first Company that made this Removal, who not being able to Walk above ten miles a Day, took up near a Fortnight in the Journey; having no Pillows to take their Nightly Rest upon, but such as their Father <HI>Jacob</HI> sound in the way to <HI>Padan Atam.</HI> Here Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> was the chief Instru∣ment of <HI>Beginning</HI> another Colony, as Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> whom he Left behind him, was, of <HI>Preserving</HI> and <HI>Perfecting</HI> that Colony where he Left him; for, indeed each of them were the <HI>Oracle</HI> of their several Colonies.</P>

Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> being here to Preach that Lords Day in the Afternoon, his great Fame had gathered a vast multitude of Hearers from several other Congregations, and among the Rest, the Governour himself, to be made Partakers of his Ministry. But when he came to Preach, he found himself so unaccoun∣tably at a Loss, that after some shattered and broken Attempts, to proceed, he made a full stop; saying to the Assembly, <HI>That every thing, which he would have spoken, was taken both out of his Mouth, and out of his Mind also;</HI> wherefore he Desired them to Sing a <HI>Psalm,</HI> while he withdrew about half an Hour from them: Re∣turning then to the Congregation, he Preached a most admirable Sermon, wherein he Held them for two Hours together in an extraordina∣ry Strain, both of <HI>Pertinency</HI> and <HI>Vivacity.</HI></P>
<P>After Sermon, when some of his Friends were speaking of the Lords thus <HI>Withdrawing</HI> His Assistance; from him, he humbly replied, <HI>We daily confess, that we have nothing, and can do nothing, without Christ; and what if Christ will make this manifest in us, and on us, before our Con∣gregations? what remains, but that we he humbly Contented? and what manner of Discouragement is there in all of this?</HI> Thus Content was <HI>he</HI>

One was, <HI>That God would punish the wanton Spirit of the Professors, in this Countrey, with a sad went of Able Men in all Orders.</HI> A∣nother was, <HI>That in certain places of great Light here Sinned against, there would break forth such horrible Sins, as would be the Amazement of the World.</HI></P>
<P N="19">§. 19. He was a <HI>Man of Prayer,</HI> which was indeed, a ready way to become a <HI>Man of God.</HI> He would say, <HI>That Prayer was the principal part of a Ministers Work; 'twas by this, that he was to carry on the Rest.</HI> Accordingly, he still Devoted
<PB N="28" REF="000724_0255_0FAA4730C79B7E98"/>
<HI>One Day</HI> in a <HI>Month,</HI> to Private Prayer with <HI>Fasting</HI> before the Lord, besides the <HI>Publick Fasts</HI> which often occurred unto him. He would say, <HI>That such Extraordinary Favours, as the Life of Religion, and the Power of Godliness, must be preserved by the frequent Use of such Extraordinary Means, as</HI> Prayer <HI>with</HI> Fasting; <HI>and that if Pro∣fessors grow negligent of these Means, Iniquity will Abound, and the Love of many wax cold.</HI> Never∣theless in the Duty of <HI>Prayer,</HI> he affected <HI>Strength,</HI> rather than <HI>Length;</HI> and though he had not so much variety in his <HI>Publick Praying,</HI> as in his <HI>Publick Preaching,</HI> yet he alwayes had a seasonable Respect unto Present Occasions. And it was Observed, that his <HI>Prayer</HI> was usually like <HI>Jacobs</HI> Ladder, wherein the nearer he came to an <HI>End,</HI> the nearer he drew towards <HI>Heaven;</HI> and he grew into such Rapturous <HI>Pleadings</HI> with God, and <HI>Praysings</HI> of God, as made some to say, <HI>That Like the Master of the Feast, he Reserved the best Wine until the Last.</HI> Nor was the wonderful <HI>Success</HI> of his <HI>Prayer</HI> upon special Concerns, unobserved by the whole Co∣lony; who Reckoned him the <HI>Moses,</HI> which <HI>Turned away the Wrath of God from them,</HI> and obtained a <HI>Blast</HI> from Heaven upon their Indian <HI>Ama<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ekites,</HI> by his <HI>Uplifted Hands,</HI> in those Re∣markable Deliverances which they sometimes experienced. It was very particularly observed, when there was a Battel to be Fought between
<PB N="29" REF="000724_0256_0FAA473126BA4A98"/>
the <HI>Narraganset,</HI> and the <HI>Monbegin</HI> Indians, in the year 1643. The <HI>Narraganset</HI> Indians had Complotted the Ruine of the English, but the <HI>Monbegin</HI> were Confederate with us; and a War now being between those two Nations, much notice was taken of the prevailing Impor∣tunity, wherewith Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> urged for the Accomplishment of that Great Promise unto the People of God, <HI>I will Bless them that Bless thee, but I will Curse him that Curses thee.</HI> And the Effect of it was, that the <HI>Narragansets</HI> Re∣ceived a wonderful Overthrow from the <HI>Mon∣begins,</HI> though the former did three or four to one, for Number, exceed the latter. Such an <HI>Israel at Prayer</HI> was our <HI>Hooker!</HI> And this Pray∣ing <HI>Pastor</HI> was Blessed, as indeed such Ministers use to be, with a Praying <HI>People;</HI> there fell up on His pious <HI>people, a Double Portion</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> which they beheld in him.</P>
<P N="20">§. 20. That Reverend and Excellent Man, Mr. <HI>Whitfield,</HI> having spent many years in Stu∣dying of <HI>Books,</HI> did at length take two or three years to Study <HI>Men;</HI> And in pursuance of this Design, having Acquainted himself with the most Considerable Divines in <HI>England,</HI> at last he fell into the Acquaintance of Mr. <HI>Hooker;</HI> concerning whom, he afterwards gave this Te∣stimony; 'That he had not thought there had been such a man on Earth; a man in whom
<PB N="30" REF="000724_0257_0FAA473337F7CA10"/>
there Shone so many Excellencies, as were in this <HI>Incomparable</HI> Hooker; <HI>A man in whom Lear∣ning and Wisdom, were so Tempered with Zeal, Holiness and Watchfulness.</HI> And the same Ob∣server, having exactly Noted Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> made this Remark, and gave this Report, more par∣ticularly of him, <HI>That he had the best Command of his own Spirit, which he ever saw in any man whatever.</HI> For though he were a man of a Cholerick Disposition, and had a mighty Vi∣go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Fervour of Spirit, which as Occasion served, was wondrous useful unto him, yet, he had ordinarily as much Government of his Choler, as a man has of a <HI>Mastiff Dog</HI> in a Chain; He <HI>could Let out his Dog, and pull in his Dog, as he pleased.</HI> And another, that observed the Heroical Spirit and Courage, with which this Great man, Fulfilled his Ministry, gave this Account or him, <HI>He was a person, who while Doing his Masters Work, would put a King in his Pocket!</HI></P>
<P N="21">§. 21. He was indeed of a very <HI>Condescending Spirit,</HI> not only towards his <HI>Brethren</HI> in the Ministry, but also towards the <HI>Meanest</HI> of any Christians whatsoever. He was very willing to Sacrifice his own Apprehensions into the Con∣vincing <HI>Reason</HI> of another man; and very rea∣dy to acknowledge any <HI>Mistake</HI> or <HI>Fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing</HI> in himself. I'le give one Example; There hap∣pened
<PB N="31" REF="000724_0258_0FAA47341223A958"/>
a Damage to be done unto a Neighbour, immediately whereupon, Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> meeting with an Unlucky Boy, that often had his Name up, for the doing of such Mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hiefs, he fell to Chiding of that Joy, as the I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>This.</HI> The Boy denied it, and Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> still went on in an angry manner, charging of him; whereup∣on said the Boy, <HI>Sir, I see you are in a passion, I'le say no more to you!</HI> and so ran away. Mr. <HI>Hook∣er,</HI> upon further Enquiry, not finding that the Boy could be proved <HI>Guilty,</HI> sent for him; and having first by a calm Question, given the Boy opportunity to Renew his Denial of the Fact, he said unto him, <HI>Since I cannot prove the contra∣ry, I am bound to believe, and I do believe what you say;</HI> and then added, <HI>Indeed I was in a Passion, when I spoke to you before; it was my Sin, and it is my Shame, and I am truly sorry for it: and I hope in God, I shall be more Watchful hereafter.</HI> So giving the Joy some good Counsel, the poor Lad went away extreamly affected with such a Carriage in so Good a man; and it proved an Occasion of Good unto the Soul of the Lad all his Dayes.</P>
<P N="22">§. 22. He had a singular Ability, at Giving Answers to <HI>Cases of Conscience;</HI> whereof hap∣py was the Experience of some Thousands: And for this Work he usually set apart the <HI>Second Day of the Week;</HI> wherein he admitted
<PB N="32" REF="000724_0259_0FAA473423E0AD58"/>
all sorts of persons, in their Discourses with him, to Reap the Benefit of the Extraordinary Ex∣perience, which himself had found of <HI>Satan's Devices.</HI> Once particularly Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> was Addressed by a Student in Divinity, who En∣tring upon his Ministry was, as the most <HI>Useful Ministers,</HI> at their Entrance thereupon, use to be, horribly Busseted with <HI>Temptations,</HI> which were become almost <HI>Intollerable:</HI> Repairing to Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> in the Distresses and Anguishes of his Mind, and Bemoaning his own overwhelming <HI>Fears,</HI> while the <HI>Lion</HI> was thus Roaring at him, Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> answered, <HI>I can compare with any man Living for</HI> Fears! <HI>My Advice to you is, That you Search out and Analyse the humbling Causes of them, and Refer them to their proper places; then go and pour them out before the Lord; and they shall prove more profitable to you than any</HI> Books <HI>you can Read.</HI> But Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> in his Dealing with Troubled Consciences, observed, that there were a sort of <HI>Crusty</HI> and <HI>Guileful</HI> Souls, which he would find out with an Admirable Dexteri∣ty; and of these he would say, as <HI>Paul</HI> of the <HI>Cretians, They must be Reproved Sharply, that they may be Sound in the Faith; Sharp Rebukes make Sound Christians.</HI> Indeed, <HI>of some he had Com∣passion, making a Difference; and others he Saved with fear, pulling them out of the Fire.</HI></P>
<P N="23">§. 23. Although he had a Notable Hand
<PB N="33" REF="000724_0260_0FAA4734E283B180"/>
it the Discussing and Adjusting of <HI>Controversal</HI> Points, yet he would hardly ever handle any <HI>Polemical Divinity</HI> in the Pulpit; but the very <HI>Spirit</HI> of his Ministry lay in the points of the most <HI>Practical Religion,</HI> and the <HI>Grand Concerns</HI> of a Sinner's <HI>Preparation</HI> for, Implantation in, and <HI>Salvation</HI> by, the Glorious Lord Jesus Christ. And in these Discourses he would frequently Intermix, most affectionate Warnings of the <HI>Declensions,</HI> which would quickly Besal the Churches and Christians of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>Many Volumns of the Sermons Preached by him were since Printed; and this Account is to be given of them.</P>
<P>While he was Fellow of <HI>Immanuel-Colledge,</HI> he entertained a special Inclination to those Principles of Divinity, which concerned, <HI>The Application of Redemption;</HI> and that which emi∣nently fitted him for the Handling of those Principles, was, That he had been from his Youth Trained up, in the Experience of those <HI>Humiliations</HI> and <HI>Consolations,</HI> and Sacred <HI>Commu∣nions,</HI> which belong to the New-Creature; and he had most critically compared his own Expe∣rience, with the Accounts, which the <HI>Quick and Powerful Word of God,</HI> gives of those Glorious Things. Accordingly, he Preached, first more briefly on these Points, whilst he was a <HI>Catechist</HI> in <HI>Immanuel Colledge,</HI> in a more <HI>Scholastick</HI> way; which was most agreeable to his present Station;
<PB N="34" REF="000724_0261_0FAA4735B386BC20"/>
and the Notes of what he then Delivered were so Esteemed, that many Copies thereof were Transcribed and Preserved. Afterwards, he Preached more largely on those Points, in a more <HI>popular way</HI> at <HI>Chelmsford,</HI> the Product of which were those Books of <HI>Preparation for Christ, Contrition, Humiliation, Vocation, Union with Christ, and Communion,</HI> and the rest, which go under his Name; for many wrote after him in <HI>Short-Hand;</HI> and some were so bold, as to Publish many of them, without his Consent or Knowledge; whereby his Notions came to be Deformedly misrepresented in multitudes of Passages; among which I will suppose that Crude Passage, which Mr. <HI>Giles Firm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in</HI> in his <HI>Real Christian,</HI> so well confutes, <HI>That if the Soul be rightly Humbled, it is content to bear the State of Damnation.</HI> But when he came to <HI>New England,</HI> many of his Church, which had been his Old <HI>Essex</HI> Hearers, desired him once more to go over the Points of <HI>God's Regenerating Works upon the Souls of His Elect;</HI> until, at last their Desires prevailed with him to Resume that pleasant Subject. The Subject hereby came to have a <HI>Third Concoction,</HI> in the Head and Heart of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as able to Digest it, as most men Living in the World; and it was his Design to perfect with his own Hand his Composures for the Press, and thereby <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> both <HI>Author</HI> and <HI>Matter,</HI> from the
<PB N="35" REF="000724_0262_0FAA4736639878F8"/>
wrongs done to <HI>both,</HI> by Surreptitious <HI>Editions</HI> heretofore. He did not Live to finish what he intended; yet a Worthy Minister, name∣ly, Mr. <HI>John Higginson,</HI> One richly able himself to have been an <HI>Author</HI> of a not unlike <HI>Matter,</HI> Transcribed from his <HI>Manuscripts,</HI> near two Hundred of these Excellent Sermons, which were sent over into <HI>England,</HI> that they might be Published; but, by what means I know not, scarce half of them have seen the Light unto this Day. However, 'tis possible, the valuableness of those that are Published, may at some time or other awaken some Enqui∣ries after the <HI>Unknown Hands</HI> wherein the rest, are as yet concealed.</P>
<P N="24">§. 24. But this was not all the Service, which the Pen of Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> did for the Church of God! It was his Opinion, That there were <HI>Two great Reserves of Enquiry,</HI> for this Age of the World; the First, Wherein the <HI>Spiritual Rule</HI> of our <HI>Lord's Kingdom</HI> does Consist, and after what manner it is <HI>Internal∣ly</HI> Revealed, Managed, and Maintained in the Souls of his People? The Second, After what Order the <HI>Government</HI> of our Lord's Kingdom is to be <HI>Externally</HI> Managed and Maintained in his Churches? Accordingly, having done his part for Delivering the <HI>Former Subject</HI> from <HI>Pharisaical Formality,</HI> on
<PB N="36" REF="000724_0263_0FAA473794BD6AF0"/>
the one Hand, and from <HI>Familistical Enthu∣siasm</HI> on the other; he was by the sollici∣tous Importunity of his Friends prevailed withal to Compose a Treatise on the <HI>Other Subject</HI> also. Upon this Occasion, he Wrote his Excellent Book. which is Entituled, <HI>A Survey of Church Discipline;</HI> wherein, having in the Name of the other Ministers in the Country, as well as his own, professed his Concurrence with Holy, and Learned, Mr. <HI>Rutherford,</HI> as to the <HI>Number</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Church Officers;</HI> The Right of <HI>People</HI> to call their own <HI>Officers;</HI> The Unfitness of <HI>Scandalous Persons</HI> to be Members of a <HI>Visible Church;</HI> The Unwarrantableness of S<HI>eparation</HI> from Churches for certain Defective Circumstances; The Lawfulness, yea, Needfulness, of a <HI>Con∣sociation</HI> among Churches; and Calling in the Help of such <HI>Consociations,</HI> upon Emerging Difficulties; and the Power of such <HI>Consocia∣tions</HI> to proceed against a <HI>Particular Church,</HI> pertinaciously offending, with a Sentence of <HI>Non-Communion:</HI> He then proceeds to consi∣der, a <HI>Church-Congregational compleatly constitu∣ted with all its Officers, as having full power in its self to Exercise all Church Discipline, in all the Censures thereof;</HI> and the Interest, which the <HI>Consent of the People</HI> is to have in the Exercise of this <HI>Discipline.</HI> The first fair and full Copy of this Book, was Drowned in its

Passage to <HI>England,</HI> with many Serious and Eminent Christians, which were then Buried by Shipwrack in the <HI>Ocean:</HI> for which cause there was another Copy sent afterwards, which through the Premature Death of the <HI>Author,</HI> was not so perfect as the former; but it was a Reflection, which Dr. <HI>Goodwin</HI> made upon it, <HI>The Destiny which hath attended this Book, hath visited my Thoughts with an Apprehension of something like</HI> Omen <HI>to the Cause it self: That after the Overwhelming of it with a Flood of Obloquies, and Disadvantages and Misrepresen∣tations, and injurious Oppressions cast out after it, it might in the time, which God alone hath put in His own Power, be again Emergent.</HI> He adds, <HI>I have Looked for this; That this Truth, and all that should be said of it, was Ordained, as Christ of whom every Truth is a Ray, to be as a Seed-corn, which unless it fall to the Ground and Dy, and this perhaps together with some of the Persons that profess it, it brings not forth much Fruit.</HI> However, the Ingenious Mr. <HI>Stone,</HI> who was Collegue to Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> ac∣companied this <HI>Book,</HI> with a little Epigram, whereof these were the concluding Disticks,</P>

§ 25. In his Administration of <HI>Church-Dis∣cipline</HI> there were several Things, as <HI>Imitable,</HI> as <HI>Observable.</HI> As he was an hearty Friend unto the <HI>Consociation of Churches;</HI> and hence all the time, that he Lived, the <HI>Pastors</HI> of the Nighbouring Churches, held their frequent Meetings for mutual Consultation in things of common Concernment; so, in his own <HI>particular Church,</HI> he was very careful, to have every thing done with a Christian <HI>Mo∣deration,</HI> and <HI>Unanimity.</HI> Wherefore he would have nothing publickly propounded unto the <HI>Brethren</HI> of the Church, but what had been first privately prepared by the <HI>Elders;</HI> and if he feared the happening of any <HI>Debate,</HI> his way aforehand was, to visit some of the more Noted and Leading <HI>Brethren,</HI> and hav∣ing Engaged <HI>Them</HI> to second what he should move unto the Church, he rarely missed of a full Concurrence: to which purpose he would say, <HI>The Elders must have a Church in a Church, if they would preserve the Peace of the Church.</HI> But if any difficult or divided Agitation was Raised in the Church, about any matter offered, he would ever put a stop to that publick Agitation, by Delaying the <HI>Vote,</HI> until another Meeting; before which time, he would ordinarily by private Conse∣rences, gain over such as were unsatisfied. As
<PB N="39" REF="000724_0266_0FAA473C3AC643C0"/>
for the <HI>Admission</HI> of Communicants unto the <HI>Lord's Table,</HI> he kept the <HI>Examination</HI> of them unto the <HI>Elders</HI> of the Church, as properly belonging unto their <HI>Work</HI> and <HI>Charge;</HI> and with his Elders he would order them to make before the whole Church a Profession of a <HI>Repenting Faith,</HI> as they were able, or willing to do it. Some, that could unto E∣dification do it, he put upon thus Relating the manner of their <HI>Conversion</HI> to God; but usually they only answered unto certain pro∣batory <HI>Questions,</HI> which were rendered them; and so after their <HI>Names</HI> had been for a few weeks before signified unto the Congre∣gation, to Learn whether any <HI>Objection</HI> or <HI>Exception</HI> could be made against them, of a∣ny thing <HI>Scandalous</HI> in their <HI>Conversations,</HI> now Consenting unto, <HI>The Covenant,</HI> they were Admitted into the <HI>Church Communion.</HI> As for <HI>Ecclesiastical Censures,</HI> he was very watchful to prevent all Proceedures unto <HI>Them,</HI> as far as was consistent with the Rules of our Lord; for which cause (except in grosser Abomi∣nations) when <HI>Offences</HI> happened, he did his utmost, that the Notice thereof might be extended no further, than it was when they first were laid before him; and having Re∣conciled the Offenders with sensible and con∣venient <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> of their Miscarriages, he would let the Notice thereof be confined
<PB N="40" REF="000724_0267_0FAA473D13B5EDD0"/>
unto such as were aforehand therewith ac∣quainted; and hence there was but one per∣son <HI>Admonished</HI> in, and but one person <HI>Ex∣communicated</HI> from, the Church of <HI>Hartford,</HI> in all the fourteen years, that Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> Lived there. He was much troubled at the too frequent <HI>Censures</HI> in some other Church∣es; and he would say, <Q><HI>Church Censures</HI> are things, wherewith neither we, nor our Fa∣thers have been acquainted, in the practice of them; and therefore the utmost Circum∣spection is needful, that we do not spoil the Ordinances of God, by our management thereof.</Q> In this point he was like <HI>Beza,</HI> who defended the Ordinance of <HI>Excommunication</HI> against <HI>Erastus;</HI> and yet, he with his Collegues, were so cautelous in the use of it, that in eleven years, there was but one <HI>Excommuni∣cation</HI> passed in all <HI>Geneva.</HI></P>

One of the Elders publickly Rebuked them. When those Devout People afterwards per∣ceived, that this was the <HI>Last Sermon</HI> and <HI>Sacrament,</HI> wherein they were to have the Presence of their <HI>Pastor</HI> with them, 'tis In∣expressible, how much they bewailed their <HI>Unattentiveness</HI> unto his <HI>Farewel Dispensations;</HI> and some of them could Enjoy no peace in their own Souls, until they had obtained Leave of the Elders, to confess before the whole Congregation with many Tears, that <HI>Inadvertency.</HI> But as for Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> himself; an <HI>Epidemical Sickness,</HI> which had proved mortal to <HI>many,</HI> though at first small or no Danger appeared in it, Arrested <HI>him.</HI> In the time of his Sickness, he did not say much to the Standers by; but being asked, that he would utter his Apprehensions about some Important Things, especially about the State of <HI>New England,</HI> he answered, <HI>I have not that Work now to do; I have already De∣clared the Counsel of the Lord:</HI> and when one that stood weeping by the Bed side said unto him, Sir, <HI>You are going to Receive the Reward of all your Labours,</HI> he Replyed, <HI>Bro∣ther,
