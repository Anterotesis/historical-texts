<P>S<HI>Uch is, not only the</HI> Impiety, Irreli∣gion, <HI>and</HI> Contradiction <HI>to clear Scripture Light, which the Doctrine of the</HI> Quackers <HI>is stuffed withal; but the</HI> Unreasonableness, Nonsense, <HI>and S</HI>elf∣contradiction, <HI>which it carries with it; that it may well seem a wonder to men of Understanding, that it hath not long since been Exploded: and that the Abet∣ters of it have not been a shame and ri∣dicule to themselves, and one to another: and that it had not died alone, if no attempts had been made against it by so many worthy Champions of the Truth: and indeed there can be no other account given of it, but that God, in his awful and righteous Judgment, hath left men to</HI> Believe a Lie, because they received not the Truth in the Love of it: <HI>and
<PB REF="000693_0004_0FA9A133321DC1F8"/>
so,</HI> a Deceived Heart hath turned them aside, that they cannot say, is there not a Lie in our Right hand? <HI>and were it not that there are so many, La∣bouring of such ignorance, as to think that holding our peace, were a yielding up the cause, it were pity, at this time of day, to take so much notice of their Scriblings, as to waste Paper in replying upon them.

<HEAD>An Epistle to the Reader,</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I <HI>Cannot but admire the Instability of many who are so easily, and soon drawn to Em∣brace and Espouse that perswasion and way of those called Quakers, and that because of an outward and seeming</HI> Sanctity, <HI>that is to be found, and to be discerned among many of them consisting only in Negatives, making up a Pha∣risaical Righteousness, made of those things that are not peculiar to</HI> Quakers <HI>only, of not</HI> Swea∣ring, Drinking, <HI>and</HI> Ranting: <HI>but if they would but cautiously Look, before they Leap, they would find the principles of many of the Reformed</HI> Churches <HI>as much against all those, and many more evils, as theirs can be, and thousands of Professors exceed them in a shining Holiness, and Christian Universal Piety; and though others walk disorderly, and not answera∣ble to the Gospel of our Lord Jesus, is not to be imputed to our Profession, Principles or man∣ner of Worshipping God; otherwise all Religion would soon be rejected, and</HI> Quakerism <HI>it self would be soon deserted. The most of their Re∣ligion is composed of Negative, for many of
<PB REF="000693_0007_0FA9A136337D36A0"/>
them are as void of the positive part of Religi∣on, as worshipping God in the publick, private and secret Duties of Religion, as many moral Heathens, who if they had but Learned their usual tone, and grown sullen and unmannerly, might pass for</HI> Quakers <HI>all over the world. If we take a view of their principles in believing every one of them severally by themselves, and the Books of particular Writers, they are not on∣ly repugnant to truth, contrary to Gods Word, and the publick received Doctrine of the Chur∣ches of Christ for many Centurys past; but also dangerous and damnable. They cannot be look∣ed upon as a Church, having not unanimously∣and fairly, or faithfully published all their opi∣nions, and principles, which is the cause many Espouse they know not what; they have not in any of their Writings declared their Church Order, Constitution, Government nor Discipline. They have no orderly way of Admission for Teaching Officers, but as many men, &amp; women, as say, the Spirit of the Lord is upon them, must be received, though they can give no convincing proof, but to those already Deluded to their way from which they want the pure and powerful Preaching of the Gospel, and all Administration of Sacraments, which they slightly ridicule, ra∣ther than own; they hold or maintain a common Christ in all, even in the Reprobate, in whom the Spirit of God says, Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not; &amp; a sufficient
<PB REF="000693_0008_0FA9A136F19FA8B8"/>
saving Light, and grace in all, even the chil∣dren of Darkness, denying Original and Damna∣ble Guilt in any Infants, even in their natural State; Railing against Singing of Psalms, de∣nying the Resurrection of the same Body; many of them scoff at the Imputed Righteousness of Christ for our Justification, and Salvation, maintaining an absolute perfection for many years in this Life, by a Popish Possibility of keeping all Gods Commands, of which neither they, nor Papist could ever in any age produce are known Instance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reader, I offer here some Sheets to thy im∣partial perusal, which was occasioned by a Paper writ by</HI> George Keith, <HI>and delivered by his own hands into the hands of Mr.</HI> George Lay∣field <HI>at</HI> Rehoboth <HI>in</HI> Pocamok, <HI>from whence as many as read, may soon conclude, this debate was first set on foot by themselves, and by pro∣moting, it gave occasion for Laying open both their Principles, and their practises, more in these corners of the World, then they have yet been. In which Answer, I have given Reply to all the Calumnies and Charges in that Paper a∣gainst my Catechism, which I am obliged to Justifie and Defend. And the only Apology why <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not Enlarged in the proof of some points, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I particularly of our Doctrine concerning the Sabbath, though I have sufficiently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> scared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Charge, because they are fully handled by o∣thers.
<PB REF="000693_0009_0FA9A137AE5CE580"/>
And concerning this Subject, I Recom∣mend</HI> Keith <HI>and all of them to</HI> Candree <HI>and</HI> Palmer, <HI>Mr.</HI> John Brown, <HI>sometime of</HI> Hol∣land, <HI>and Mr.</HI> Matthew Crawford; <HI>and whoever answers them, shall answer me; If any should Censure me for my tediousness in answer∣ing; I had finished it a year ago, but by reason of my tedious Affliction, not Transcribed until now.</HI></P>
<P>I had a visit from <HI>Keith</HI> at my house in <HI>Virginia,</HI> which though promised and inti∣mated by his Harbinger to be on <HI>Fryday,</HI> was not performed until <HI>Saturday,</HI> in the Afternoon, &amp; by the uncertainty of their coming, was prevented of having any of my Friends present, though some few drop∣ped in occasionally, at which time we had several Charges and Questions, concerning several things, which were too tedious to Rehearse here: but I wish they had been Recorded then, to prevent many misrepre∣sentations, that were spread abroad by that Party. And though there was no real De∣bate; &amp; he oft told me, he came not to Dis∣pute with me, yet Son after they boasted of a Victory; which if they find after a diligent perusal, &amp; impartial consideration of these Sheets, let them improve and post it if they will. <HI>Yet after some Discourse, be impudently Charged me as a False Teacher, and
<PB REF="000693_0010_0FA9A13870ED3CF0"/>
challenged me to a</HI> Publick <HI>Dispute, before the Multitude, which I scorned with a sharp retor∣sion, and that for these reasons:</HI> 1. <HI>Their Prin∣ciples were unknown, because never</HI> unanimous∣ly <HI>agreed upon, nor</HI> fairly <HI>Published to the World, therefore not to be Disputed within words.</HI> 2. <HI>We</HI> should <HI>Dispute before an igno∣rant and illeterate</HI> Multitude <HI>who</HI> should <HI>be most incompetent Judges.</HI> 3. <HI>Because he would run into Learning, and</HI> I <HI>must follow, and so what</HI> should <HI>be</HI> Delivered, <HI>should not tend to their Edification, but fall to the ground, and be Lost. But afterwards I gave him a</HI> Chal∣lenge <HI>to oppose my Catechism, or</HI> Principles <HI>in Writing, and he</HI> should <HI>have an Answer to every</HI> Particular; <HI>though</HI> Keith <HI>gave not the</HI> least <HI>intimation of this Paper left behind him, though he dropt an Expression, which I under∣stood not then, that he</HI> would <HI>Write no more then he had done; this I took for</HI> Declining <HI>my Challenge: Now I Leave it to</HI> all <HI>to De∣termine whose</HI> Challenges <HI>or Overture was fairest, for</HI> 1. <HI>What either of us</HI> should Deli∣ver, should <HI>be on Record, and we could not fly from it.</HI> 2. If <HI>the Hearing a verbal Debate, in angry words,</HI> should <HI>Edifie, much more a written Debate,</HI> frequently <HI>read over.</HI> 3. <HI>Ma∣ny might be Judges of a written Debate, who had no opportunity of hearing it</HI> Disputed publickly. <HI>And as I have prefixed his Paper

verbatim,</HI> so I expect the same priviledge for mine, <HI>if</HI> any Answer is Published. <HI>I</HI> have greater and better work then Controversie to Follow; but in the Strength <HI>of</HI> the Lord, shall not only Defend my Principles still by Writing, but <HI>if</HI> called thereunto, shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Seal them with my Blood.

<HEAD><HI>Several mixed Quoeries, to be resolved by</HI> Quakers <HI>in this juncture, for the Justifica∣tion of themselves and satisfaction of all.</HI> July 26<HI>th.</HI> 1692.</HEAD>
<P>(<HI>Question</HI> I.) WHat is the Reason <HI>Quakers</HI> are so far Metamorphosed, or Changed, both in Judgment, and Practice at this Day, from what they once were, at their first rise in <HI>Europe?</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. What is the Reason <HI>Quakers</HI> that look upon themselves, as the only pure Church in the World, has never yet adventured to Publish a form of sound words according to the Apostles language, containing a con∣fession of their faith, and principles, unani∣mously agreed upon among themselves, as all other churches in the world have done.</P>
<P N="3">III Seeing they own themselves divinely inspired from an immediate call, and Apo∣stolick mission, why they have not adven∣tured to publish interpretations of Scripture seeing they condemn &amp; so far disapprove all other Commentaries, as far from the mind of God, and full of gross Errors, and mistakes.</P>
<P N="4">IV Wherefore did they write, and Bark so much against all witnessing to truth,
<PB N="2" REF="000693_0013_0FA9A13CF2A0AD98"/>
conviction of falshood, in Judicatures, by an oath, as sinful, and unlawful under the Gospel, and now in <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> and <HI>Mary-Land,</HI> seem only to quarrel, the man∣ner and way of Swearing on the Book ac∣cording to the <HI>English</HI> Form, and are willing to Swear now in Judicatures, with lifted up hands, which many look upon to be more solemn than the former?</P>
<P N="5">V. Whether it be the same individual nu∣merical Body for substance which falleth that shall rise again at the Resurrection, notwith∣standing of Changes, in Respect of Qua∣lity?</P>
<P N="6">VI. If there be a sufficient and saving light in all men to instruct, direct, and to teach them; what necessity is there for mul∣tiplying so many Teachers, both of Men and Women, among <HI>Quakers?</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. Why <HI>Quakers</HI> are so hot, and Zea∣lous for K. <HI>James,</HI> a Popish and Abdica∣ted Prince, and was never so for any other Protestant King, tho' King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> and Queen <HI>MARY</HI> has been kinder than any other, by giving a Liberty established by Law?</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Whether the same individual Je∣sus, that was cloathed with Flesh, suffered, and died at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> is the same that rose again, and is ascended to Glory, and the
<PB N="3" REF="000693_0014_0FA9A13D09C98DE0"/>
same they hold substantially in all men and women?</P>
<P N="9">IX How Christ, the Spirit of God, saving Grace, an d<HI>L</HI>ight can be in those, who have not the least knowledg of him as Mediator and Intercessour between God and sinners.</P>
<P N="10">X Whether the omission of duty, as prayer or any other duty for a certain time, a week, a month, or 2 year, is excusable in <HI>Quakers,</HI> before an all-seeing and Just God from this pretence, that they had no impulse or mo∣tion of the Spirit thereunto.</P>
<P N="11">XI Why they use not means for edifying &amp; reforming those of their families, by calling <HI>them</HI> together, reading Scripture daily to <HI>them</HI> &amp; praying with &amp; for them, as other <HI>Christ∣ians</HI> in all Churches, and Ages have done, and is approved in the Word of God.</P>
<P N="12">XII Wherefore <HI>Quakers</HI> have not adventu∣red <HI>to</HI> publish their doctrines publickly <HI>taught,</HI> which they say is immediate from the spirit of God, as most other Churches have done frequently.</P>
<P N="13">XIII Seeing they decry the civil salutations of the Kingdom, &amp; people, among <HI>whom they</HI> live, what warrant can they produce for their singular, ugly, &amp; bad natured way of salu∣tation, their Males &amp; Females taking one a∣nother by the hands or wrists, continuing a considerable space, wringing them hard, &amp;
<PB N="4" REF="000693_0015_0FA9A13DC4156900"/>
looking stedfastly in each others faces, without one word speaking.</P>
<P N="14">XIV Whether it is Christ compleatly as me∣diator, you believe in, and is in all men.</P>
<P N="15">XV Whether two men differing in a Funda∣mental truth, absolutely necessary to salvation can be guided by the same infallible Spirit.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. Whether Quakers do direct their Prayers to God in <HI>themselves,</HI> or to God in Heaven.</P>
<P N="17">XVII Where God is really, personally, &amp; substantially; is he not in all fulness of Grace and Goodness.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII What Worship, or Divine Service do the heathen nations perform unto the Living, and True God.</P>
<P N="19">XIX Whether the inflicting of corporal punishments on children, servants, &amp; other offenders, and hiring of men to take a Ves∣sel by force from Privateers, be not an using of the carnal Weapon.</P>
<P N="20">XX Whether the receiving of a Compe∣tent maintainance, or necessary Aliment by Quakers teachers, however so freely and Voluntarily given, without appointment of humane law, and all compulsion, be a Preaching the Gospel freely.</P>

<HEAD>A True Copy of George Keith's Paper, Delivered to Mr. George Layfield, At POCAMOK in MARY-LAND.</HEAD>
<P>K<HI>IND</HI> Friend <HI>George Lay-field,</HI> my Dear Love in the Lord Jesus Christ Sa∣luteth thee, with Earnest Suppli∣cation and Prayer to God for thee, that God, who hath begun his good work in thee, may perfect it, until the Day of Christ, and that the Precious Seed, that God hath Sown in thy Heart may grow not only to be the greatest of Herbs, but a great Tree, bringing forth Fruit, to Gods Everlasting Praise, and to thy Souls Everlasting Com∣fort and Happiness.</P>
<P>As concerning the Catechism, Published by <HI>F. M.</HI> I have diligently read, and con∣sidered it, and tho' it holdeth forth diverse true things, yet it hath a great mixture of Error, and many false, and unsound hurtful things it doth contain; which my present shortness of time in these Parts, doth not permit me to mention in most particulars; and as the same Catechism aboundeth
<PB N="6" REF="000693_0017_0FA9A13F39D436E8"/>
with many Errors; so it falleth ex∣ceeding short, in not mentioning in the least, many necessary Truths, and Doctrines, which are of great necessity, to be taught unto people, as belonging to the first Principles of Christian Religion, which he al∣together omitteth; nor doth he in the least declare that he receiveth any one of these things, delivered by him, in his said Cate∣chism, from any inward opening or disco∣very of Gods Spirit in his Heart: Nor doth he mention, any one thing of his own ex∣perience; of the work of God in his heart, but as his Title Page sheweth, his whole Work is but a Collection from others; he mentions nothing in all his Catechism, that people are to be turned or directed to God, or Christ, or the Spirit of God in them, he telleth not People, that it is God or Christ, or the Spirit of God convinceth them, and reproveth them for sins of all sorts, as Ly∣ing, Pride, Envy, Coveteousness, Unbelief, he doth not instruct People, how they are to find God and Christ in their Hearts, and how they are to wait in silence of mind, and thoughts, to hear God, and Christ speak inwardly unto them in their Hearts, in the silence of all Flesh; and how they are to have God and Christ, and the Ho∣ly Spirit to <HI>dwell</HI> and <HI>walk</HI> in them, and to <HI>teach</HI> them over and beyond all outward
<PB N="7" REF="000693_0018_0FA9A13FEDEADA30"/>
<HI>teaching;</HI> he mentions very little of the Spi∣rit at all, and what he mentions of it is, very <HI>Obscurely,</HI> so that without breach of <HI>Charity,</HI> I can freely say, he is a great Stranger to the <HI>inward Dealings and Workings of Gods Holy Spirit in the Hearts of his Peo∣ple:</HI> and whereas he mentions, his Com∣passion over the Tender Souls, in an <HI>A∣merican Desart,</HI> ready to perish for want of a <HI>Vision,</HI> in his <HI>Epistle to the Reader;</HI> his <HI>Catechism</HI> can nothing help them in that respect; for not one word in all his <HI>Cate∣chism,</HI> directeth People were to find the true <HI>Vision</HI> of God in any measure; but on the contrary, according to <HI>his,</HI> and <HI>his Bre∣therens</HI> False Faith, all true Divine <HI>Vision,</HI> and <HI>Revelation,</HI> and all Divine <HI>Inspiration,</HI> in ceased since the <HI>Apostles</HI> Days, both among <HI>Teachers</HI> and <HI>People,</HI> and God hath commit∣ted His Counsel wholly to Writing, the former ways of Gods revealing himself be∣ing ceased; and they say further, there is no inward voice, or word of God in people, but the <HI>Scripture</HI> is the only Word, and only Rule, all which is most false, and hurtful <HI>Doctrine,</HI> and doth more hurt where it is received, then all his <HI>Catechism</HI> can do good. And all the People in <HI>Virginia</HI> both <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> whom he seemeth to re∣flect upon for their Ignorance, have the Holy Scriptures without, and the Holy
<PB N="8" REF="000693_0019_0FA9A140ACBE0A60"/>
teachings; and illuminations of God and Christ within, to teach them what is needful to their Salvation, if they will hearken there∣unto, far better then this <HI>Catehism</HI> of <HI>F M.</HI> which is defective, and wanting of many Principal and necessary doctrines, belonging to the Christian Faith.</P>
<P><HI>In the first Page of his</HI> Catechism, <HI>He saith, God made the World out of Nothing;</HI> but this is no Scripture Language and indeed in very many of his Answers, he holdeth not to Scripture Language, but useth the in∣vented words of Mans Wisdom, not accor∣ding, but contrary unto the Holy Scriptures. May it not suffice to say, <HI>God Created all things by Jesus Christ;</HI> as the Scriptures de∣clareth, without adding to the Word of God.</P>
<P><HI>Page Third.</HI> He mentions no other <HI>Teach∣er</HI> but the <HI>Scriptures</HI> given to men, to serve and Glorify God; And thus according to him; all these great Nations who have not the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> are wholly left without all Teaching of God to Serve and Glorify him, in the least measure, but this is expresly contrary to <HI>Scripture,</HI> which say concerning the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who had not the Law outwardly delivered in Scripture, that they did show the work of the Law in their hearts, and what was to be known of God, was ma∣nifest in them; for God had shown it un∣to
<PB N="9" REF="000693_0020_0FA9A141701F32D8"/>
to them, and when they knew God, they Glorified him not as God and Christ the Light of the World, hath enlightned every man that cometh into the World; and teacheth every man in some measure to serve God, which is to obey him, otherwise they could not have sin; if there were nothing in the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> to require obedience or ser∣vice of them unto God.</P>
<P>It had been much better in this <HI>Authour</HI> to have instructed People, that they had some other helps, and means of knowledge with the Scriptures, and these some outward, and some inward, although it is to be gran∣ted that the Scriptures are the best of all <HI>Books</HI> outward, yet there is the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Gods Creation,</HI> and the <HI>Book</HI> of His <HI>Providence over all his Creatures;</HI> that are no small helps and means, in their place being duely used and together with God, Christ, and the Spirit, are inwardly present to teach all People, in some things to serve God, and as every one is faithful in the little, more is given to them.</P>
<P>Besides, that the Writer of this <HI>Catechism</HI> should have joined the spirit of God &amp; Christ with the Scriptures, as the <HI>Opener,</HI> &amp; <HI>Interpreter</HI> of them, informing people that the Scriptures are the <HI>Organ</HI> &amp; <HI>Instrument</HI> of Gods Spirit; &amp; that Gods Good, and Holy Spirit, is the prin∣cipal Author and cause of all true know∣ledge
<PB N="10" REF="000693_0021_0FA9A143170F1768"/>
of God, as the doth inwardly inspire, and enlighten every one; and that there is no true saving knowledge of God, and Christ, without the Spirits Inspiration, and Teaching; and that how much soever peo∣ple read or hear the Scriptures, if they neg∣lect or turn away their minds from Gods inward teachings, by his Word, Spirit, and Light within their hearts, they remain Blind, and Dark; and Ignorant of God.</P>
<P><HI>Page Third.</HI> That he saith there are <HI>Three Persons in the God-head;</HI> this is not Scripture Language, to say Three Persons, <HI>The Mystery of the Three,</HI> to wit, the <HI>Father</HI> the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Holy-Ghost,</HI> who are One GOD, is Great, and Glorious, and ought to be Reverently conceived &amp; expressed, in Scripture words, which the Holy-Ghost hath Taught; but not in words of Mans Wisdom.</P>

<P>And that he saith, <HI>Christ revealeth the Will of God to us, by His Word and Spirit; in Page</HI> 10.

<P><HI>Page</HI> 10 11. <HI>Although he mention the death and Sacrifice</HI> of <HI>Christ for sinners,</HI> yet he doth not well, that he doth not hold forth that <HI>Christ died for all, and tasted Death for eve∣ry man,</HI> as the Scripture expresly declareth: which is a most great, and weighty testi∣mony of Gods universal <HI>L</HI>ove for <HI>sinners.</HI></P>

<HI>his Brethrens Doctrine;</HI> who say, all inward Divine Revelation, and Inspiration is cea∣sed since the <HI>Apostles</HI> Days, &amp; if so then the Holy Spirit hath ceased to work or ope∣rate on mens hearts, for his operation is not in the dark, or in a blind and insen∣sible manner, but in <HI>L</HI>ight, and Demon∣stration, sensibly, and clearly, revealing his power in them, &amp; opening the eyes of their understanding; and thence it is that the Spirit of God, is called in Scripture, the Spirit of Wisdom, and Revelation, and that Spirit worketh in true Beleivers.</P>
<P><HI>Page Eleventh.</HI> That he calleth <HI>Regenera∣tion</HI> a <HI>New and Spiritual Birth, by the Spirit of God,</HI> is true, but this Contradicteth <HI>His,</HI> and <HI>His Brethrens</HI> Doctrine, who say, they have no infallible Spirit, and all Divine Revelation is ceased, and that there is no immediate communion with God or his Spirit which is <HI>False Doctrine,</HI> and contra∣ry to Scripture, and the <HI>Saints</HI> Experience, who know that as they are Born of Gods Spirit, so they are sensibly <HI>Fed,</HI> and <HI>Nou∣rished</HI> by the Spirit of God, and <HI>Suck the Breasts of their Heavenly Mather, Jerusalem from above;</HI> and feel themselves embraced by the same, as sensibly as the <HI>Child</HI> feeleth the <HI>Mothers Embraces,</HI> and see and behold <HI>Her Beauty,</HI> hear <HI>her voice,</HI> and <HI>Language,</HI>

<P>Again, that he saith, <HI>True Believers are United to Christ;</HI> is true and very comfor∣table, but is in contradiction to <HI>His</HI> and <HI>his Brethrens Doctrine;</HI> who say it is Blasphemy to affirm, that Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> really in the Saints, for if he be not really in them, by himself, they cannot be <HI>United</HI> to him, for true <HI>Uni∣on</HI> requireth the near presence of the things <HI>United</HI> one to another, as the <HI>Body</HI> cannot be <HI>United</HI> to the <HI>Soul,</HI> if the <HI>Soul</HI> be not really in the <HI>Body,</HI> and all true Believers are <HI>United to Christ in Heaven,</HI> by their being <HI>U∣nited</HI> to the measure of him in themselves, as the Members of the <HI>Body</HI> are <HI>United</HI> to the <HI>Head,</HI> by being <HI>United</HI> to a measure of the same <HI>L</HI>ife, and Spirit in them, that is in the <HI>Head.</HI></P>

and Pray, but seeing <HI>he</HI> and <HI>his Brethren,</HI> Cal∣led <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Ministers, deny this manner of immediate calling by the Spirit of God, they run to the <HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>Pope of Rome,</HI> by that Dirty <HI>Channel,</HI> and <HI>Conduit,</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Call conveyed to them; for they know that their <HI>Presbyterian Church,</HI> nor indeed any other called a Church, hath been a Visible Church, ever since the <HI>Apostles</HI> Days, but only the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> hath called her self the Visible Church; and they confess, and say with us, that the True Church of God hath been that <HI>Woman</HI> who hath fled to the <HI>Wilderness,</HI> and hath not been always visible, but hid, and that for about Twelve Hun∣dred Years, and so had no visible Officers or Ministers, to call their successors: And therefore they derive their Call, and Autho∣rity by the Church, and <HI>Pope of Rome;</HI> as <HI>James Durham</HI> in his Commentary on the <HI>Revelations,</HI> and many others, whose Call and Ordination, Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> so called, hath refuted, and these called <HI>Independent</HI> Ministers, where of <HI>John Owen</HI> was one, have another poor shift, and evasion, saying they are called by the Church; but if the Church was not visible for so many ages, the Church could not call them, the Ministers are be∣fore the Church, and therefore cannot be called by the Church originally; but all these poor shifts are in opposition to the

<HEAD>A Short Answer, to George Keith's Lybel, Against a CATECHISM Published, by F. M. And left in the Hands of, Mr. George Layfield.</HEAD>
<P>I AM not a little surprised to recieve from the hands of Mr <HI>George Layfield</HI> a paper containing so many mistakes, false, unjust, and invidous charges against a Catechism Published by <HI>F. M.</HI> and the rather because of his high pretences to an immideate mision, and vain boasting of an extraordinary A∣postolick call, insulting over all others from unusual high and enthusiastick attainments compleat perfection, and unheard of ex∣periences, which the most serious and God∣ly are strangers unto, and what they have any experience of most modest in discours∣ing of them and selfe denyed under their greatest enjoyments I shall wave two things First it's being delivered without a subscrip∣tion
<PB N="21" REF="000693_0032_0FA9A18DF5F68788"/>
whereby it is to be looked upon as a Libel not to be Answered, nor Regarded. Secondly, that com∣plementing and flattering preamble, they have e∣ver <HI>Condemned</HI> in others, and withal am glad to Hear they have any Charity for any of a different Opinion from themselves, which coming to hear their Teachers will procure at any time. First, He begins with a general Charge of many <HI>Errors, false</HI> and <HI>unsound things</HI> comprehended in the <HI>Catechism;</HI> And next, He asserts the <HI>Author</HI> to be guilty of many <HI>Omissions</HI> and this from one pretending to Learning, who has diligently read and considered it, as he says, is so insignificant and idle Imputation, which all modest, and ingenuous men, must never disown; and that there are <HI>Omissions,</HI> wilful and designed <HI>Omissions,</HI> I shall never deny, for after it was first Composed, I did <HI>Compendize</HI> and <HI>Abreviate</HI> it ofter than once, to suit it to the Capacities of, such for whom it was prepared, even young ones, to whom, <HI>Quakers</HI> have had little regard hitherto, as to their Instruction in Religious Fundamentals: Neither have I seen any Writings of <HI>Quakers,</HI> even those pretending to give accounts of their Princi∣ples, but justly may be charged with greater <HI>Omissi∣ons,</HI> then any yet discovered in the <HI>Catechism,</HI> Pub∣lished by <HI>F. M.</HI> as the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of the <HI>Trinity,</HI> of <HI>Persons</HI> in the <HI>God head,</HI> the <HI>Ten Commandments,</HI> and the <HI>Lords Prayer,</HI> the Pattern of all Prayer; and <HI>George Fox</HI> his Received <HI>Catechism,</HI> industriously spread by <HI>Quakers,</HI> not only favours of Humane Learning, and words of mans wisdom, but guilty of many weighty <HI>Omissions,</HI> and fills up a great part with stuff wherein there is no <HI>Religion'</HI> far less can they be called <HI>Fundamentals,</HI> as <HI>Salutations</HI> by <HI>words</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="000693_0033_0FA9A18EB8B15610"/>
and <HI>Gestures, Covering</HI> and <HI>Uncovering</HI> the Head, condemning Preaching in <HI>Steeple Houses</HI> &amp; <HI>Churches.</HI> Yea I appeal to the impartial, and unbiassed Rea∣der, if the <HI>Catechism</HI> Composed by <HI>F. M.</HI> contains not more of the Principles of Religion, then one containing <HI>Quakers</HI> Principles, Composed by several Hands, as <HI>Crook, Pennington, Burroughs, Parker, Smith,</HI> and several others; now I refer my self to every man, how invidious and unjust it is to Charge a <HI>Catechism</HI> composed by one with <HI>Omissions,</HI> while so many pretenders to immediate Revelations and Inspirations, are guilty of so great <HI>Omissions,</HI> and vain <HI>Repetitions;</HI> and there is not a Book which I have see writ by <HI>George Keith,</HI> but may as justly lie under this Charge, as my <HI>Catechism;</HI> &amp;it were vain Ostentation to disown it. And for my own part, I have ever observed in all the Writings of men, Ignorance, Infirmity, and Imperfection, to magnifie the Excellency of the Scriptures above all Books of mens Composure; but it is no strange thing to find <HI>Quakers</HI> quarrelling our succinct way, of composing our Principles for young ones, be∣cause they are opposite to so early Edification, which practice is very inconsistent with Scripture Precepts, and Presidents of Training a Child when young, bringing up Children <HI>in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord;</HI> and <HI>Timothy knew the Scrip∣tures from a Child;</HI> and the advantage of an early Instruction is witnessed by the experiences of many Godly in all Ages, where attended with the Bles∣sing of God, and pursued with Exhortation, until they arrive at a riper age: Now I leave all to con∣sider how insignificant and imputation this of <HI>Omission</HI> is.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="000693_0034_0FA9A18F778EABE8"/>
Another general Charge is, that I have not declared from whence I have Received these things, and that I have owned in the Title Page of my <HI>Catechism,</HI> to be but a Collection from others: These are heavy Charges with him, therefore shall answer them particularly. 1. Any that reads his Paper, may understand he is as guilty of that <HI>Omis∣sion</HI> as any of his Neighbours, for he has not told from whence he had what is delivered in this Pa∣per, and it was the best policy; for he durst not assert it was from the Spirit of God, because of the falshood and malice it contains, as! shall make appear. 2. If they are the Truths of God, and a∣greeable to Scripture, it is easily determined from whence these Truths are, which were questioned by few, until <HI>G. K.</HI> whose Trade has been to Fo∣ment Contention, and stir up strife in the Churches of Christ in the World; and whose Arguments are so slender and thred bare, that they scarce deserve an Answer. 3. If I inclined to stuff my Doctrines and Discourse upon all occasions, with enlarged Ac∣counts of Conversion or a work of Grace, with concomitant and consequent Experiences of the Operations of Gods Holy Spirit, as <HI>Keith</HI> pretends to do, I might amuse my Hearers; but Actions and Conversation are better demonstrations of a work of Grace, then all <HI>Keith's</HI> vain boasting Language, which with his self magnifying Language, can be esteemed nothing else then a Crying up and Prea∣ching himself, instead of Christ; for though <HI>Paul</HI> oft declared his Conversion, and gloried in his At∣tainments, it was, that the Free Grace of God might be exalted, and self abased; which <HI>Quakers</HI> are rarely acquainted with, either in Praying or
<PB N="24" REF="000693_0035_0FA9A190C89FEE78"/>
Teaching, as many who have heard them al∣ways declare.</P>
<P>And because <HI>Keith</HI> has shewn himself void of Charity, by shooting his invidious Thunderbolt at a distance, e're he knew or saw me, or I him, That I am infallibly a great stranger to the dealings of Gods Spirit on the hearts of his People; I am con∣strained to Justifie my Office, from those Unchari∣table Calumnies, and that Grace might be magni∣fied, by giving this Relation, in the sight of an All seeing and Omnipresent God, that e're I Re∣ceived the Imposition of Hands, in that Scriptural and Orderly Separation unto my Holy and Mini∣sterial Calling, that I gave requiring satisfaction to Godly, Learned, and Judicious Discerning Men, of a work of Grace and Conversion wrought on my heart, at fifteen years of Age, by, and from the pains of a Godly Schoolmaster, who used no small diligence in Gaining Tender Souls to Gods Ser∣vice and Fear; since which time, to the Glory of his Free Grace be it spoke, I have had the sure Ex∣periences of Gods various Dealings with me ac∣cording to his Infinite and Unerring Wisdom, to my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> comfort, whereby all may see how far Grace is expected and desired, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to qualifie for the Ministerial Office; for not only, was this required of me, but is expected of all Ordain∣ed by Presbyters; which experience shall enable me not to value what <HI>Keith,</HI> or any other <HI>Quakers</HI> shall ignorantly and groundlesly affirm, in Judging rashly of my State, for we are looked upon as of the World, and they only the People of God, as they commonly Cauterize us, but this is our comfort, we shall not be Judged in the Last Day
<PB N="25" REF="000693_0036_0FA9A19361EF2A10"/>
by <HI>Quakers,</HI> who must as well as their Neighbours, give an account of their rash and uncharitable judgings to a most Righteous Judge.</P>
<P>And that it is a Collection from the Scriptures of the Living God, I never will deny, but glory in it; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Keith</HI> mean from others, it is false, and there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, mention of those others in the Title Page; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what hath <HI>Keith</HI> Published in most of his Books, but Collections, and many of them from the worst of men, Hereticks long since confuted, with some, vild, sophistical, and unscriptural Nations of his own, both repugnant to Scripture, and opposite to his Quaking Brethren: And</P>
<P><HI>Turpe ext doctors cum culpa redarguit ipsum.</HI></P>
<P>He asserts, I declare not that it is God, or Christ, or the Spirit of God, that convinceth or reproveth people of their sins; but this is so false a Calumny▪ that none in charity can judge <HI>Keith</HI> to be so great a Perfectionist as he proclaims himself to be; and this every one may be satisfied in, if they will but turn over to page 12 where it is plainly delivered; That God in Turning or Calling Sinners unto himself, does <HI>convince them of Sin and Misery, En∣lighten their Minds with the Knowledge of Christ, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their wills,</HI> &amp;c. which is also the judgment of all my. Brethren, and particularly of those of the <HI>Westminister</HI> Assembly, both in their Shorten and larger Catechism. And whereas he charges me with this, that I mention but little of the Spirit of God at all; and that this may appear as false as the former, I refer my self to every Reader, and especi∣ally those who have read and considered, better then <HI>Keith</HI> hath done; and let them turn over to the several pages, where I have made frequent mention
<PB N="26" REF="000693_0037_0FA9A193FA37C348"/>
of the Spirit of God, in so small a Volumn, ascri∣bing to him that which was and is his peculiar work. 1. As being the Original Author, and In∣diter of the Scriptures, <HI>page</HI> 3. 2. As being one distinct from the Father and the Son, <HI>page</HI> 4. 3. Of Christ's revealing the <HI>Will of God to us, by His Word and Spirit</HI> page 10. 4. <HI>The Spirit of God applies to us the Redemption purchased by Christ,</HI> page 11. 5. In the same page, <HI>being the Author of Re-generation, or the New Birth,</HI> according to the Scriptures, <HI>Joh</HI> 3. 6. <HI>The Spirits sanctifying of us,</HI> page 15. 7. <HI>That he teaches us to pray aright, and acceptably to God,</HI> page 41. From hence every one may learn, what credit to give to <HI>Keith's</HI> words and Calumnies for the future; and though he con∣structs my Compassion over the tender Souls in an <HI>American</HI> Desart, to be a reflection against the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Virginia,</HI> I am satisfied, it has not been so Received by them for whom it was intend∣ed, neither judged so by the Spirit of God, who much after the same manner pitties and compassio∣nates <HI>the Ignorance of his own people,</HI> by the Prophet Hos. 4. 6. <HI>My People are destroyed for lack of know∣ledge.</HI> And I am perswaded, Quakers should not have so great success in drawing aside silly Souls from the Truths and Ways of God, if it were not for the abounding Ignorance of <HI>Virginia,</HI> and other dark Corners of the World, who have not yet received, and comprehended the Light shining about them; and even their ignorance of those Fundamental Truths contained in the Catechism. And none deserves more to be pitied for their Ig∣norance, than Quakers, and of the most Fundamen∣tal Truths, notwithstanding of their high pretences

to the Spirit and Light within, as <HI>John Drummond,</HI> a Reputed and Received Quaker, a Reader of <HI>Keith</HI>'s Books, with many others, who lately at my House at <HI>Poccamok,</HI> before <HI>Keith</HI> and several other Witnesses, published his gross Ignorance of that Fundamental Article, That none could be Saved without-Faith in Jesus Christ; from which I under∣stand since, that he had oft reproached me, drawing his own ignorant conclusions from thence. And if Quakers are ignorant hereof, what can they pretend to know.</P>
<P>Another general charge is, That I nothing help the Ignorant, neither do I direct them to the true Vision; but whoever will but consider how many Fundamental Truths are laid down in the Cate∣chism, for the Edification of the Ignorant, and plainly asserted, That Christ teaches his People with his Word and Spirit; and if this be not the true Vision of God, Quakers must lose themselves, and be puzzled in finding of it: but be rather would insinuate what harm it would do, if received, but this may discover how far men are for keeping sinners in ignorance, by possessing their minds with a dislike of this mean of Knowledge, which leads and directs sinners to the Scriptures as the great mean of Knowledge, and profitable for instruction, containing all things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to be known by Christians; and also to Christ and his Holy Spirit the Author and Efficient Cause of Knowledge, who can Enlighten without means, in a most immediate manner, but most ordinarily conveyes Knowledge by Means and Ordinances of his own Appointment concurring with his Holy Spirit, blessing and ma∣king them effectual to whom he pleases. And in

Catechism many savoury truths delivered, no sins, in∣dulged, most duties relating to our general and special callings enjoined: Now how the receiving such a form of sound words containing positive Di∣vinity, should be prejudicial, and <HI>Kieth</HI>'s works stuffed with <HI>Quibling,</HI> and <HI>Sophistical Controversy,</HI> &amp; his teachings filled with often repeated <HI>Calumnys</HI> against all the Reformed Churches, and <HI>Un-scrip∣tural</HI> or <HI>unheard</HI> of <HI>Long-winded Similitudes,</HI> which amuse the deluded, and ignorant, should become profitable, let every one determine; and I am perswaded, none has received or can receive injury therefrom, but by slighting and disregarding it. And this my experience can testifie, that since the Catechism was opposed by <HI>Quakers,</HI> they have had a more universal, and kindly welcome, and recepti∣on. And here is no new Doctrine, but what <HI>Keith</HI> had oft seen in the Catechisms of our Refor∣med Churches, which he had oft impugned with all his might and Sophistry; and his repeating his old Arguments, is only with vain Ostentation, to show himself among a poor, ignorant, and deluded people, and once possessing them with this, that what he delivers is immediately from the Spirit of God, he may driver what he will, as infallible, and never to be questioned.</P>
<P>Having answered his Generals, I proceed to examine his particulars; and he suffers not the first page to pass without a Censure, because I have affirmed, God made the World out of Nothing: and that this is not only true, and agreeable to Scripture, that to word and express it otherwise, were inconsistent with the Revelation of God, and it were to jump in with the Ad∣versaries
<PB N="29" REF="000693_0040_0FA9A196383C60A8"/>
of Gods Truth, for we cannot conceive of Creation; without saying it was made out of Nothing which all describe to be, <HI>Productio ex nihilo;</HI> therefore as many places of Scripture as but mention Creation, say as much as I have done, for which I am quarrel∣led. Did not Creation give the First Being to all things that were made, and consequently were all nothing before God commanded them to be, for was nor Light nothing till God said, <HI>Let there be Light <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Further, if God made the World, he either made it out of his own Essence, or some pre existent matter from Eternity, or produced it out of nothing. I pre∣sume you will not be so absurd as to assert any of the first two, not the first, for so the Essence of God should become divisible and corruptible; not the se∣cond, for then some matter should be Co-eternal with God, which were blasphemy to affirm: And it is no small argument of the Omnipotence of God, to declare and affirm, especially to young ones, the Word was made out of nothing, seeing they know not that it is implied in the word Creation; for be∣cause of the Omnipotent Power of God in Creation. Acclamations of Praise are ascribed to him, Psal. 33. 6. <HI>By the word of the Lord were the Heavens made, &amp; all the Host of them, by the breath of his mouth,</HI> Acts 4. 24, In that joynt Acclamation of the Apostles, <HI>Lord thou art good, which hast made Heaven, and Earth, and the Sea, and all that in them is:</HI> And it is no adding to the Word of God, while nothing is delivered but Gods Mind in his Word; though <HI>Keith</HI> next in his pretences to <HI>Nailor</HI> himself should discover so much palpable weakness as to censure it again: And I have also asserted in my Catechism, that there is no work so peculiar to any of the Persons of the Holy Trini∣ty, but all of them have a hand in each; so that his

as the Rule of Faith, and Judge of Controversies, saying, It is written, and Cites the Prophets oft for their Conviction, and charges them with ignorance of the Scripture, as the cause and ground of their Error, saying, <HI>Ye Err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</HI> And though dim Natures Light, the Rellicks of one fallen from perfection, and the works of Creation, render all inexcusable for their Ignorance of their Creator, yet are very lame, and insufficient fully to teach their Duty, or to discover all their sins, or teach them the knowledge of God and his Son Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, whom <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> say is in ail men; but can this <HI>Jesus</HI> of theirs be the true Christ, and savingly in all men; seeing there are Nations and Kingdoms, who have not the least remote or dim notions of Christ the Son of God, as Saviour, or Mediator between Sinners, and God, <HI>who was in Christ Reconciling the World to him∣self;</HI> and if so as <HI>Quakers</HI> affirm, then blinded Pagan Nations are in as brave a case, as the Churches of Christ, to whom the Oracles of God are committed, who are pronounced blessed beyond all others, at Gods Chosen Inheritance, and particularly from that great and transcending priviledge of enjoying the Revealed Will of God, to whom the Divine Ora∣cles were committed, and blinded Nations were our Predecessors, within some few Centuries past.</P>
<P>And what <HI>Keith</HI> understands by silent waiting on God, which he calls a silence of mind and thoughts; I fear neither he, nor any <HI>Quaker</HI> for him, can ever demonstrate from plain Scripture Testimony; and it is not the first time they have been puzled to tell us what it is, though some have preferred it to the Rea∣ding of the Scriptures, and a Mean appointed of God, for right understanding of the Scriptures; but
<PB N="33" REF="000693_0044_0FA9A19AB1DD3688"/>
this new notion of theirs is warranted no where is the Scripture; some of them have taken upon them to call it a silent posture of the heart, without think∣ing good or evil; but this is so strange a conceit, that it is inconsistent with the nature of the heart and Spi∣rit of man, which is in the judgment of most, and to solid experience of all, so stirring and active a thing, that it is never at quiet or rest, but always employed about either good or evil, and this so many as call a <HI>Spirit Res C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gitandi,</HI> say, is while man is asleep; but further it is inconsistent with Scripture waiting, for herein there must be an exercise of the Graces of Faith, Patience, Hope, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Psal 4. 1. <HI>I waited pati∣ently for the Lord, and he enclined unto me, and board my Cry;</HI> here is both the exercise of Patience, and the use of Prayer, in the Psalmists successful waiting, and how this can be without exercising the heart a∣bout good or evil; this is much like the Commentary and vulgar gloss of Quakers on that Text, Mat. 6. 6. <HI>When thou prayest, enter it no thy Closet, and whom thou hast shut the door,</HI> or according to these able Com∣mentators,) <HI>shut thy heart,</HI> which is an unfit frame for God, to whom we must open, and before whom we must pour out our hearts. Another Instance of Scripture waiting, very unlike Quakers waiting you May find in Lam. 3. 26. <HI>It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord;</HI> and let every one be umpire in this case, whether there can be the exercise of those Graces, where the heart thinks neither good nor evil; and they are often puzled to satisfie us, whether their silent waiting be publick or private Worship; for if it is not done in Faith, it must be sin, and consequently no acceptable Service so God, it private of secret, it ought to be gone about with as great secrecy, and to go too pub∣lick

with it, is visible Hypocrisie to be seen of men. If publick Worship, it must and to the Edification of others; but how the perfect silence, without all Admonition, Rebuke, Prayer, Introduction, or expres∣sions of Praise edifies is unconceivable, and as they meet, so they disperse oft, without the least motion to speak, which demonstrates how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> man, such Meetings are; and what they amuse the World with their imaginary experiences of refreshments from their silent Meeting, when nothing is said, they must needs be like those, which an English Congregation received from a Quaking <HI>Dutch,</HI> woman, Teaching in an unknown Language; and what reason we have of believing their boasted of Experiences from nega∣tive imaginary Worship, and they regard not the Experiences of thousands of the Godly, of ravishings of Soul, and ineffable Joy and Comfort from Prai∣sing of God in singing of Psalms, and from Communi∣cating in the Supper of the Lord, as performed by us, and in most of the Reformed Churches.</P>
<P>In the next place he condemns our asserting and believing there are Three Persons in the God head: It is no wonder to find so great and transcending a Mystery, rather to be Reverenced, Adored, and Be∣lieved, then Reasoned and Disputed, as it has been mistaken and quarrelled both by Ancient and Mo∣dern Hereticks in the World. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not to lip up the gross Errors of Ancient Hereticks concerning this Doctrine, as of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Nestorious, Sabe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and am not a little concerned, that Quakers pretending no so great and so good things, should joyn hand in hand with such, whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have been long since cunningly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and exploded; and that they by their frequent and scurrilous Barkings against so Fundamental a

Truth, as <HI>solomon Acl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> who in <HI>Barbadoe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> asserted this Doctrine to be a Presbyterian Fiction, and most others of that Gang I have conversed with, had most Ignorant, and gross Notions of a person, dreaming it to be some gross, material, visible and corporeal Substance, like unto man, and looked upon it, an absurdity to apply any such thing to God at all; and here I find one of their Learned and Litigious Cham∣pions, quarreling Three Persons in the God-head, or Divine Essence, and how such men can be Reconciled among themselves, I leave to those that are con∣cerned; I must confess, it I understood what <HI>Keith</HI> intends by this Charge so obscurely delivered, I could with greater fulness and particularity answer; and waving that uncharitableness he was notoriously guilty of concerning me, and others, I conceive he only contends about words, by calling Three Persons in the God head, not Scripture Language; but words of mans wisdom, as all our Doctrines and Writings are commonly Calumniated by such. And this I must Animadvert the Reader, that I am the more confirmed in that which I charged him with at my House, that most of his Writings are quibling Con∣troversies, and his Debates a disputing about words, little to the Edification of Souls, but tending to Fo∣ment Divisions in the Churches of Christ upon Earth of which he had been a great Instrument already, by making perverse Disputings his Trade in the World, and to confirm it, he brings a sublime and transcend∣ing Mystery, rather to be adored and believed, then disputed and brought under the Debate of men of corrupt minds; but 1. If words not expressed in Scriptures in the same Letters and Syllables, be words of mans wisdom, and an adding to the Scriptures, the Words of the Living God, then all Expositions of
<PB N="36" REF="000693_0047_0FA9A19CEFDFD818"/>
Scriptures, though agreeable to Scripture, if not nu∣merically the same words, must be condemned and thrust but of doors; and then what will become of most of <HI>Keith's</HI> Teachings, which are delivered in publick as immediately from the Spirit of God, yet stuffed to the amusing rather than Edification of him Hearers, with unscriptural, unusual, and unheard of Allusions of a Key, and losing and finding a Key, at also of a Table and covering of Tailing, with Trenchers and Napkins, and a Cupboard at Home, and no Meat in it, as also a Husbands Writing Let∣ters to his Wife, while absent, all which was deliver∣ed in Long winded Discourses at <HI>Thomas Fooks</HI> his House in <HI>Onankok,</HI> and <HI>Nus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>waddux,</HI> to numerous and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Auditories of men and women, rather of∣fended then edified and affrighted from, then engaged to Quakers Principles, or Practices 2. If I should make it appear, that Quakers are as guilty of using words not to be found in the Scriptures, as any of their Neighbours, will no all men believe them very per∣verse to Censure others for that which they practice themselves, and consequently from <HI>Keith</HI>'s words and to the words of the Scriptures; And 1. Let any be prevailed with, to observe the Writing of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Author, which is fil'ed in every page with Hu∣mane <HI>L</HI>earning, and Scholastick Notions, making as much use of School Art in all his sophistical Argu∣mentation, as any that has put Pen to Paper, as he himself owned the use of Humane Learning in all his Writings. 2. I shall instance to you from themselves not only words, but sentences and phrases, which none could ever yet find or hear of, in or from the Scriptures, some whereof are <HI>pens,</HI> others belong to <HI>Barclay,</HI> others are usual and common in the mouths of most Quakers, as those uncouch phrases of Mira∣cles

How much is it to be Lament∣ed, that the frequent Debates, and needless Janglings of <HI>Keith</HI> concerning this Subject, could not have suf∣ficed him; he must now upon his running Circuit, raise a new Debate, and Controversy, about words, which is Censured in the Words of the Holy Apostle, 1 Tim 6. 4. <HI>He is proud knowing nothing, but doting about Questions, and Strifes of words, whereby cometh Strifes, Railing, Evil Surmisings.</HI> 5. <HI>Perverse Dispu∣tings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the Truth, supposing that Gain is Godliness, from such turn away,</HI> or withdraw thy self: And all such are Censu∣red in the words of Holy <HI>Calvin,</HI> that Eminent man of God, <HI>Lib.</HI> 1.

<PB N="38" REF="000693_0049_0FA9A19E6F744508"/>
Truth is made so easie &amp; plain to be discerned; and the reason or ground given by this worthy Author, why the Churches of Christ are necessitated to use such novelty of words, if they may be so called; is when the Truth is to be Defended against Ranglers, who deride it with Quibbles; so the Old Fathers be∣ing troubled with False Doctrines, were necessitated to express themselves in exquisite plainness, least they should leave any crooked by ways to the wicked, to whom the doubtful Constructions of words, were hiding Holes of Error; therefore it was that the Fa∣thers, in confutation of <HI>Arius,</HI> were necessitated in asserting the Divinity of the Son, to call him HO∣MOUSION, or Consubstantial with the Father: And against <HI>Sabe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ius,</HI> who denied all Distinction between the Father, son, and Holy Ghost, but what was Nominal; the Defenders of Truth were necessita∣ted to say, there is subsist in the Unity of God, a Trinity of Persons, which is most suitable to, though not rigidly the same with the Language of <HI>John, There are Three, and these Three are One</HI> Trinity, <HI>Tres Unes,</HI> or <HI>Tres in Uno,</HI> Trinity.</P>
<P>Having offered these Generals, I come particularly to the Charge, for asserting there are Three Persons in the God-head: All that <HI>Keith</HI> would seem to Al∣ledge, is only that it is not Scripture Language; whereby he would seem to favour the great Funda∣mental Principle, most, of his Brethren have been blasphemously barking against these Thirty or Forty Years; and devoutly to say, There are Three in One: But it were to be wished, that he, and all of them, would demonstrate themselves according to their usual boasting, more skilful in the Scriptures, then any of their Neighbours, by declaring freely, &amp; ingenuously, what those Three are called, that are
<PB N="39" REF="000693_0050_0FA9A19F2DAF7AF8"/>
but One God, and what Substantive, they joyn with the Adjective three, which is distinguished in the Fa∣ther, Son, and Holy Ghost; and then they would have dealt plainly without all Popish Equivocation, or Reservation; which all that Read their Books, and frequently Converse with them, will find the ge∣nerality of Quakers as guilty of, as any subtile Jesuit at St. <HI>Omers.</HI> For if this great and Fundamental Truth, would be made plain to the Edification of the Church of God, to which it is so highly necessary that God can neither be known, believed in, or called upon aright without it, then some denomination must be ascribed, and given, differing from one another in Incommunicable Properties; for they must either be three somethings, or three nothings; the former being rejected, if three somethings, they must be ei∣ther three Gods, three Essences, three Parts, of the same Essence, or three Qualities, or three Names, or three Manners, or wayes of Subsisting; To assert to Three Gods, were insufferable Blasphemy: though <HI>Josiah Coal</HI> is as guilty of as great Blasphem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in a Letter to <HI>George Fox,</HI> which as it came from Qua∣ker, was also Approved of by P<HI>en</HI> himself, in his An∣swer to Mr. <HI>John Faldo,</HI> a Minister I lately saw in <HI>London;</HI> which for the Readers satisfaction, and ab∣horrence of all, I shall here Insert.</P>

<P>Let Pen, and as many as will dare to Justifie this,

<P>But to return, To assert Three Essences, were to conceal Three Essentially Distinct, which were to fall in with the former absurdity: To receive or be∣lieve three parts of the same Essence, or God head which were most inconsistent with that Oneness and absolute Simplicity in the Nature of God, which cannot be conceived divisible, and to call the three in one, three qualities or accidents, were to believe accidents in God, which were absurd; and to assert nothing else but three Names, were to fall in with the long since exploded Heresy of <HI>Apollinarius,</HI> and to hold Faith repugnant to the Rule of Gods Word whence he has twice Three Names, and yet asserted to be but Three only; so that it must be Three Di∣stinct Manners, Methods, or Wayes of Subsisting, and is Termed in the Schools, <HI>Ens,</HI> and <HI>Modus En∣tis.</HI> And according to the unanimous Opinion of our Reforming and Reformed Divines: A Person in the God-head, is whole God, not absolutely or simply considered, but by way of some personal Properties, or a manner of Being, or Distinct Subsistence, have∣ing the whole God-head in it. <HI>Usher,</HI> and <HI>Calvin,</HI> call a Divine Person, a Subsistence in the Divine Na∣ture, which having relation to the other, is distingui∣shed from them, with Incommunicable Properties: So that though the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, be really and essentially the same in Essence or Be∣ing, yet they have something differing from one ano∣ther; for if the <HI>Word, Joh.</HI> 1. 1. had been simply, and absolutely God without any thing peculiar to it self, it had been improper, and amiss to have said, it was not only God, but with God.

<HI>Tertullian</HI> agrees, saying, there is in God a cer∣tain Disposition, or Distribution, which changeth no∣thing of the Unity of the Essence.

He is called, and that Deservedly, <HI>The Great Prophet of His Church,</HI> according to that Promise of, and Prophecy concerning him; <HI>A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, like unto his Brethren, Him shall ye hear in all things.</HI> And this Promise was fulfilled in his Coming, and Execu∣ting this his Prophetical Office, by being the <HI>Great Gospel-Preacher to his Church, and People; Declaring the Way, and Means of Salvation, by a Mediatour, delivering the Will of His Father;</HI> This was Prophe∣sied also of him in <HI>Isaiah.</HI> 61. 1, 2, 3. and <HI>Hebr.</HI> 3. 1. <HI>He is called, the Apostle of our Profession. And He is the Sole Teacher of the Mysterys of Salvation from the Father.</HI> Matth. 11. 27 <HI>No Man knoweth the Father save the Son, and he to whom soever the Son will reveal him.</HI> And this Our Great Prophet do's not always immediately, else <HI>K</HI>'s. Teachings and all the Teachings among <HI>Quakers,</HI> were most need∣less, and vain, but,</P>
<P N="1">1 By the Holy Scriptures, Profitable for Doctrine, and able to make the Man of God, Wise unto Sal∣vation</P>
<P N="2">2. By His Messengers, and Ministers, whom he has commanded to <HI>Go, and Teach all Nations;</HI> and sent to give Warning to His Churches, and People, Therefore from their Office, and Teaching, called Teachers.</P>
<P>And <HI>L</HI>astly, by his Holy <HI>S</HI>pirit in the Hearts of his People, where Christ dwells not Substantially, as <HI>Quakers</HI> say, but Spiritually by Faith; and so is u∣nited by Faith tho' Locally Distant, without the
<PB N="43" REF="000693_0054_0FA9A1A2EDB71448"/>
Presence of the things United, as <HI>K.</HI> would insinu∣ate, and assert in his Paper. For if there can be a Moral Union, and Relation standing firm betwixt a Husband, and Wife, the one in <HI>Europe,</HI> the other in <HI>America,</HI> and a Natural Union, and nigh Rela∣tion, between Parent, and Child, much more be∣tween Christ in Heaven, and believers on Earth, by a Spiritual, and indissolvible Union, by Faith, which is not an absent Christ to Believers, with whom he is by Gracious, and Spiritual Influences in their Hearty. And <HI>K</HI>'s. Subtle, and Sophistical Argu∣ments from the General, and Universal Presence of Christ as God, to his special and Gracious Presence as Mediatour, will take Place with none, but Ig∣norant, and Deluded <HI>Quakers;</HI> for so the Devils in Hell▪ should enjoy as great a Priviledge as Believers on Earth.</P>
<P>And also it is granted that he is the Eternal High-Priest of His Church, who Offered and gave Himself a Sacrifice once upon the Cross for Sinners and by the Efficacious Merits of this Death, ren∣ders the Persons and <HI>S</HI>ervices of his People accep∣table unto God, not only Teaching them by His Holy Spirit, what to pray for as they ought; but also continues <HI>an High</HI>-P<HI>riest at the Right-hand of God, making continual</HI> I<HI>ntercession for Believers, Heb.</HI> 7 25. <HI>Wherefore he is able to Save them to the uttermost, that come to God by Him, seeing be ever</HI> L<HI>iveth to make Intercession for us;</HI> all which is fully and soundly deli∣vered in the Catechisms, and Confessions of Faith of our Divines of the <HI>Westminster</HI> Assembly.</P>
<P>And Lastly, He is the Sole King, Head and Law∣giver of his Church; by which Kingly Power, and Authority, he Appoints Laws and Statutes, for the Counsel and Direction of his people, even to the
<PB N="44" REF="000693_0055_0FA9A1A3B953B478"/>
binding of Conscience, with the whole inward man, in whom Christ does Rule, and Reign, even in and over such as subject their Souls to his Government, suffering Christ to Reign over them.</P>
<P N="2">2 He Subdues and Conquers sinners Naturally Re∣bels to himself, making them from an Un-willing, a Willing People, in the Day of his power.</P>
<P N="3">3 In defending of his Church from all their E∣nemies, assuring them, the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against them.</P>
<P N="4">4 He restrains the Fury, and rage of, and Final∣ly, executes his Wrath on all His, and their Ene∣mys.</P>
<P>And we never did disown that the special Fruits of all these Three Offices are wrought in the hearts of Believers; which is inconsistent with that <HI>Pro∣phet,</HI> P<HI>riest, &amp; King</HI> in all men according to <HI>Quakers</HI> Doctrine, while the Scripture affirms, they are Re∣probate, in whom Christ is not. And it is plain the <HI>Quakers</HI> common Christ, is not the true Media∣tour and Messiah, who only dwells in the hearts of Believers by Faith, and not of Infidels that do not so much as know by any kind of knowledge, and yet they are Enlightned by him, as they say, with a sufficient, and saving knowledge. How unnecessary must it be to multiply Offices in our Mediatour, seeing all are reducible to those Three? and must he not be a Man of a <HI>P</HI>erverse Spirit, and contentious mind, that would raise a Debate upon this head? and <HI>K</HI>'s Evasion and Quibble for this is extreemly silly, and weak; for (saith he) the Commands of Gods Moral Law are reducible to two; yet also branched out into Ten; for the first Division of the Divine Commands, was by God himself into two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or two Commands; yet the same God
<PB N="45" REF="000693_0056_0FA9A1A475403F78"/>
makes the Enumeration or Division unto ten; but no such Warrant can be produced for this Enumera∣tion or Multiplication of Offices in our Mediator; for it were as impertinent, and idle, as if every Duty required, and every <HI>S</HI>in prohibited in every Com∣mand, were a new Command; and there should be thrice ten instead of ten; and what must be thought of those that multiply Offices in Christ, calling every thing that Christ is called a new Office in the Medi∣ator, as a <HI>Father,</HI> a <HI>Shepherd,</HI> an <HI>Husband, Physician, &amp;c.</HI> Whence he is called the <HI>Way,</HI> a <HI>Rock,</HI> a <HI>Door,</HI> a <HI>Vine;</HI> all which denote no new Offices, but signifie his Richness, Fulness, Benefits, <HI>L</HI>ove and Fa∣vour to Believers, denoting that Spiritual Relation to Believers, and Christ's usefulness to them in all E∣states and Conditions.</P>
<P>His next Charge, Page 10, 11. I have affirmed Christ Died, or was Sacrificed for Sinners. Now let any determine whether this Answer does not set forth the Fruit, and Satisfaction of Christ's Death for Sinners; for if he Died for Sinners, and for our Sins, is it not enough to us; for if we had not been Sinners, we should not have stood in need of Re∣demption: and if sinners were Redeemed, no others did want it. And tho' he seems to reprehend it with Scripture Language, yet his Charge is more obscure, and defective, then that he finds fault with; either that quarrelled at must be true, or false, or deficient; if true, why Censured, if false, let Quakers speak their minds plainly; if deficient, there must be some for whom Christ Died, besides Sinners. If I have not multiplied words, to humour captious and critical Quakers, I hope I shall never have cause to repent it, where I Studiously avoided all prolixity, and endea∣voured all succinctness and brevity.</P>

But to return to the matter in hand concerning the Nature, Efficacy, and Extent of Christ's Redempti∣on, we have to do with many Adversaries, whose va∣rious Sentiments are not to be <HI>r</HI>econciled either a∣mong themselves, or with the Holy Scriptures: for some say, Christ Died absolutely for all, and every individual sinner, and in Laying down his Life, did equally intend the Salvation of all; others say, he Died for all conditionally, from a foreseen condition of Faith; so it was only a conditional Salvation, or Redemption, wherein not one was absolutely Redee∣med; this by some is called a possible Salvation; whereby they explain Universal Redemption to be nothing else, then Christ's Pacifying an Angry God for all, and leaving all in a possibility of Salvation if they will; others of a middle sort, say, he Died absolutely for the Elect of God, but conditionally for the Reprobate: But the most unanimous, and received Doctrine of the Reformed Churches, is, That whom Christ Died for, be absolutely and compleatly Redeemed; and that was some Select and Chosen Number, given him <HI>of God the Father,</HI> to Lay down his <HI>L</HI>ife for them, as our Lord himself hints plainly to us in John 17. at large, of which says he, <HI>None was Lost.</HI></P>
<P>That I may discover the absurdities of the former Opinion; consider first, Christ's absolute Redempti∣on for all, and every individual Sinner: For 1. So <HI>Christ</HI> should have intended to have saved those that were actually in Hell, and condemned to Eternal Flames, before his Death, under an Irrevocable Sentence of Wrath. 2. What a Dishonour were it to God to say, he intended, and at so dear a rate, as the Death of his own Son, to go about the Redeeming of those whom he knew from all Eternity should be infallibly
<PB N="47" REF="000693_0058_0FA9A1A6E4BFBED0"/>
Damned; can it be imagined, <HI>Christ</HI> intended to Save such? 3. If all men and women, were absolutely Redeemed, all should be infallibly Saved, for Salva∣tion supposes Redemption, and Redemption secures <HI>S</HI>alvation; but it is evident to all, the smallest num∣ber shall <HI>Enter in at the Strait Gate</HI> 4. If God should purpose and intend the Salvation of all absolutely, and yet the smallest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umber escape Eternal Wrath, what should the purposes and intentions of God be more then the purposes, and intentions of his Crea∣tures that can be frustrated, disappointed and come to nought?</P>
<P>Let us view the absurdities and inconsistencies that flow naturally from the universal, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ditional Re∣demption, whereby all are left under a possibility of <HI>S</HI>alvation, if they will; and 1. If so, then it would have been possible, for all to have been Dam∣ned, and not one Saved; for if man had but resisted as it was in his Power, because not absolutely Re∣deemed, then Christ might have Died really for no∣thing, and have seen no Fruit of <HI>the Travail of his Soul:</HI> And, Let serious <HI>S</HI>ouls consider what an in∣significant Death, and fruitless inefficacious Redem∣ption should he have Paid. 2. If a conditional Redemption, and a possibility of Salvation was all that Christ Died for, I would Enquire, Who it is that performs the Condition, God or man; if men can believe or repent of themselves, then the Conditional Salvation, might avail them something; but he cannot believe, it is Gods special Gift, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 2. And man cannot repent, for it is his grant, 2 <HI>Tim</HI></P>
<P N="1">1 What will a Possibility of Salvation for all men avail, and a conditional Redemption signifie, if all men are not left also in a Possibility of believing and Repenting also, if, and when they would.
<PB N="48" REF="000693_0059_0FA9A1A79268B520"/>
3. If a conditional Universal Redemption, be all the Redemption accomplished by Christ, then it is as im∣possible for man to be saved, as if he had not been Redeemed at all; seeing it is as impossible for man to perform the Conditions, as it is for him to redeem himself; and all may see it this be <HI>Quakers</HI> uni∣versal Redemption, what a poor, lame, ineffectual and half Redemption they believe in, and build upon for their Salvation; as <HI>Barclay</HI> has declared, in Publishing his <HI>Universal Redemption,</HI> sufficiently confuted, by Mr. <HI>Brown;</HI> not answered till he was Removed off the Stage, by Death.</P>
<P>And such as tread the middle path, holding an absolute, Redemption of Gods Elect, and only a Conditional Salvation of the Reprobate; They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old (1.) A Twofold manner of Redempti∣on, which we have no ground for in the Scriptures; all that are Redeemed, being Redeemed alike.</P>
<P N="2">2 If so, the greatest part of Mankind are left in as bad a state, as if they were not Redeemed at all.</P>
<P>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we consider the Merit of Christs Crucifixion and Death, materially in regard of its Sufficiency, Dignity, Worth, and Merit, by Reflecting on the Person who Suffered and Died, and of the man∣ner how he Accomplished it, with Faithfulness, and that most Willingly, and Chearfully, that it was no less Price then the Death of him, who was God, Equal with God the Father; The Ransome must be owned, and believed, of Infinite Value, and Worth, Merit, and Dignity, and so not only a compleat, and sufficient Satis∣faction for the sins of the whole World, but was in it self a compleat Ransome, for the Offences of a Thousand Worlds. And so if we consider
<PB N="49" REF="000693_0060_0FA9A1A830AE2498"/>
the Sufficiency of his <HI>P</HI>rice, and Ransome, he Di∣ed for all, he Offered a Sacrifice, and gave an A∣tonement that was enough for all, he gave himself a Ransome for all, and Tasted Death for every man; further we assert, and believe, that all Na∣tions, Kingdoms, Tongues, and <HI>P</HI>eople were Re∣deemed by Jesus Christ; so according to the School distinction, He Dyed, for, <HI>Generibus S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngulorum,</HI> for, <HI>All kinds of men,</HI> not for <HI>Singulis Generum,</HI> not for, <HI>Every</HI> I<HI>ndividual Man and Woman</HI> according to <HI>Johns</HI> Vision, <HI>Rev.</HI> 5. 9. <HI>For thou wast slain, and hast Redeemed us to God, by thy Blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation, so that all</HI> and every one that is or shall be Redeem∣ed, are Redeemed by Jesus Christ, who is the only Saviour, and <HI>no Name given under Heaven where∣by we can be Saved, but by the Name Jesus;</HI> so he is the Saviour of all. And this we dare most bold∣ly and Warrantably affirm, that Christs Death is Efficacious for the Salvation of all, whom he died for, and not one of these <HI>P</HI>redestinated to Eter∣nal Life, shall <HI>P</HI>erish, but be brought Infallibly to Glory; <HI>Rom</HI> 8. 30. <HI>Whom he did Predestinate them he also Called, and whom he Called, them he also Justified, and whom he Justified, them he also Glorifi∣ed.</HI> From which Scripture, none can be Ignorant, unless they wilfully stop, and Blind the Eyes of their understandings, what an inseperable connecti∣on is between the Means, and the End, and all flowing from the Everlasting <HI>P</HI>urpose, and immu∣table <HI>P</HI>redestination of God; and as many as Christ Died for, shall be infallibly Saved, and to whomsoever he has purchased Salvation, to as many he has <HI>P</HI>urchased all the Means and Conditions, of Salvation, as Faith, Repentance, and all the

Holy Graces of the Spirit of God; for saith the Spirit of God, as many as were ordained to <HI>Eter∣nal Life, Believed;</HI> neither dare we believe such an ineffectual Redemption, as <HI>Quakers</HI> hand in hand with <HI>Arminians,</HI> and <HI>Pelagians</HI> do hold, which only leaves man in a possibility of Salvation, if the sinner will; but may be, the most of Christs Redeemed ones, go to Hell notwithstanding; while Christ, <HI>John</HI> 17. Speaks of his Redeemed and Ransomed ones, <HI>as those Select Ones, whom the Father had given him out of the World, for whom, that is the World, He would not so much as Pray, far less dye;</HI> and <HI>Keith</HI> himself owns in his Malicious Uncharitable Book, <HI>Against New-England Ministers,</HI> that there are those for whom it may be said, Christ <HI>Dyed not.</HI> And so this must be the Gentlemans <HI>Posi∣tion, Christ dyed for all, and dyed not for all;</HI> which is a plain contradiction; and farewel <HI>Keith</HI>'s uni∣versal Redemption, which if it had not evanished in a contradiction, was uncomfortable, and ineffectual to the greatest number of Redeemed ones.</P>

<P>But every Christian Reader may discover, in this person, a most Arrogant Spirit, to pretend to know my Principles, and Opinions better than I know them my self, and with impudent falshood, to affirm and declare, I have Published an Account of Principles I do not believe; and that they are repugnant to my Brethrens Doctrine; seeing our publick Confessions of Faith, and Catechisms known to the whole Chri∣stian World, sayes the same things, and particularly in the Description of Effectual Calling, which is further confirmed in all our common places, and Bodies of Divinity, and in all the practical Pieces, treating of these Subjects, as Mr. <HI>Allen</HI> of Conversi∣on, Mr. <HI>Burgess,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cole</HI> of Regeneration, and many others; and I am satisfied, how oft I have de∣livered in publick my Opinion in these matters. I must needs declare, it is an evil Principle, and unfair Undertaking for any to take upon them to Publish Principles, and contradict Principles, of those he is an absolute stranger unto; and it is the true Character of a Deceiver, to possess others with prejudices against our Principles, only by misrepresenting of them, and Fastening Principles on us, which we abhor.

How great must the Ig∣norance of Quakers needs be, who cannot, or their perversness be that will not, distinguish between Enthusiastick, Immediate, Extraordinary and Obje∣ctive Revelations; from the <HI>S</HI>pirits Gracious and <HI>S</HI>pi∣ritual Illumination <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his mind, impressing those Truths made known, and Revealed in an ordinary way, by Means of Heavens Appointment; giving them Efficacious Grace to see, Embrace, Close with, and make <HI>S</HI>aving Application of them to their hearts, and Grace to observe the same in their Lives; which ordinary and extraordinary Operations they confound together, as they do the Universal, or General P<HI>resence of Christ,</HI> with his special, saving, and gracious Pre∣sence, holding him to be in all, after the same man∣ner.

called Sinners out of Sin, unto Grace, yet at the same time to feel, and assert, that all have sin remain∣ing in them; for it is no hard matter to distin∣guish betwixt Sinners being under the <HI>P</HI>ower, Do∣minion, and Slavery, or Drudgery of Sin, and a Sinners having some Relicks and Remainders of Sin, and Corruption in them, whereby even in Believers there is a constant and spiritual Warfare raised in the believing Soul, whereas formerly the Strong Man kept the House, the Apostle gives us this distinction; <HI>Sin shall not have Dominion over you, you are not under the Law, but under Grace;</HI> and the same Apostle, even after his Conversion, complains of his own sinful, wretched Corruption, and at the same time Triumphs in the Victory obtained, for in the next breath; <HI>Thanks be to God who has given us the victory;</HI> and if Sin in some measure be not contemporary with saving Grace, or Conversion, what must become of <HI>Quakers</HI> universal sufficient, and saving Grace, and all the multitudes of them, I have ever seen, must according to their own Opinion, be void of Conversion, Grace and Justification; for Sin have been easily discernable in all, neither did ever any of them produce one in∣stance for their absolute perfection; and yet none of us assert, that the Saints <HI>S</HI>incerity, Thought, Word and Deed▪ as <HI>Keith</HI> falsely words it; yet if strictly, and spiritually taken; all are attended with Infirmities.

This Justification and Adoption, are Acts of God, without us, and and work only a relative Change; and that Justification, Adoption and <HI>S</HI>an∣ctification once had cannot be Lost. As to the first, Justification is according to the Judgment of all Pro∣testant Divines, a gracious Act of Gods Love, in a
<PB N="54" REF="000693_0065_0FA9A1ABF52237F8"/>
Judicial Way, upon the account of Christ's Imputed Righteousness, acquitting, and absolving the sinner from Guilt, and consequently from Condemnation. <HI>I</HI> hope <HI>Quakers</HI> will not jump in with Papists, who assert, Justification to be the making of one Just, and so Confound it with Sanctification, which the Spirit of God makes to be distinct Acts, tho' always unse∣parable. As to Adoption in its nature, it is Gods Numbering us among his Children, a taking us from among the Children of Satan, and <HI>Giving us a Right to all the Priviledges of Gods Children;</HI> &amp; pray where is the falshood, and danger, in asserting, they are Acts of God without us, bringing Believers into a new Relation unto God, Christ, and the Holy Spi∣rit, to whom they are Enemies and <HI>S</HI>trangers by Nature; seeing at the same time we firmly believe, that there is no Relative Change wrought by God on any Sinner, in Justification or Adoption, without a real, saving, inward, gracious, and universal Change upon the whole man by Sanctification, which are as different by the Language of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> as Sanctification and Glorification is, Rom. 8. And none are Justified or Adopted, but <HI>Sanctified</HI> also; all which is asserted in my Catechism; if <HI>Keith's</HI> con∣tentious, Cavelling, and Carping <HI>S</HI>pirit had allowed him to take notice thereof; for none of us hold, that God makes any his people, or children, without a real, gracious <HI>Change,</HI> as <HI>Pen</HI> and <HI>Keith</HI> would invi∣duously and falsely Calumniate us, and our universal∣ly known Doctrine, fairly published to the World; any yet that renewing work is not properly Justifica∣tion, but Sanctification, which is a gradual work; whereby the Old man of sin and corruption, <HI>is Cru∣cyfyed, and the New man of Grace, Righteousness or Ho∣liness, is r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>newed and put on, more and more;</HI> and

though <HI>Keith</HI> would make Peace of Conscience to be the Essence, and Nature of Justification; yet all Re∣formed Divines, with the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> make it a concomitant, or rather a consequent Blessing to our Justification, Rom 5. 1. <HI>Being Justified Faith, we have Peace with God.</HI> And whoever denied Regene∣ration to work a real change, which my Catechism plainly asserts. And that Justification, Adoption and Sanctification may be Lost, is not only the Doctrine of <HI>Quakers,</HI> but of <HI>Pelagians, Papists</HI> and <HI>Arminians</HI> too; though <HI>Keith</HI> and <HI>Barclay</HI> own that some may Arrive to such a pitch and measure that they cannot <HI>Fall away;</HI> now this measure must either be higher than Justification, Sanctification, or Regeneration, or they contradict themselves, in opposing Free Grace, and denying the Perseverance of the Saints in Grace with most discouraging and comfortless arguments to Believers, which imply many gross absurdities; and concerning this Head, Mr. <HI>John Brown</HI> our Coun∣try man, in confutation of <HI>Barclay,</HI> layes down our unanimous Doctrine, and first animadverts all that we hold, the <HI>P</HI>erseverance of none, but such as are Regenerated; and how false and absurd were it to say, a Sinner Regenerated, or made a Child of God to Day, and yet be a Child of the Devil to morrow, made meet for Heaven, and yet go to Hell, Pardon∣ed, and yet Damned. 2. We do not hold a special and inevitable necessary of Perseverance, though un∣willing and lying in Sin, as Enemies would insinuate to the prejudice of Truth, as <HI>Quakers</HI> often have done. 3.

<P N="5">5 The Final and Total fall or Apostacy of Regenerate Saints is inconsistent with the Nature of Grace which is an Incorruptible Seed, that can∣not be totally extinguished where e're it is planted of God.

Finally, it Robs the Regenerated Children of God, of their Spiritual Joy, and Holy Consolation in the Holy-Ghost, by filling them with Perpetu∣al Fears Anxiety, and Doubts about their State. And we find <HI>Keith</HI> insinuating this, That the Do∣ctrine of Perseverance Flatters men in great sins; for tho' the Godly cannot Fall, Finally nor Totally, yet as we have said, they may Fall into many E∣vils provoking to God, and injurious to their own Peace, and comfort, which they are ever watchful against, lest they should lose the sense and comfort of Gods Special Love, and Favour; any measure or degree of Grace, or Holiness, which would be most Wounding, and Grievous to them, and so far <HI>from</HI> Flattery; but this his Calumny is like unto the rest.

if Universal Grace, saving and divine Light, the Spirit of God, and Christ, Substantially present in all men, even the most ignorant, wicked and <HI>P</HI>rofane, and absolute <HI>P</HI>erfection in some, be not more soul-deluding, and self-Flattering Doctrine, then the <HI>P</HI>erseverance of the Saints once Regene∣rated, whose sins and infirmityes, humbled, and makes them constantly watchful; and so it is evident, it destroys the promise of Gods Establishing &amp; con∣firming Spirit, and leaves the Catholick Church of God which the Gates of Hell cannot prevail against, upon a most Ticklish Foundation, and Lyable to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come to nothing; it would annul all Christian Communion and Fellowship, for according to <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> opinion, one may be a Saint to day, and in Christian Fellowship, and may <HI>Fall away,</HI> and be Damned to morrow; it renders out Pardon comfort∣less, seeing after Pardon we may perish Eterna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, and destroyes the Hope and Faith of Life Everlast∣ing, seeing no man can firmly believe it, until he have the Enjoyment of it.</P>
<P>The next grand Charge, that highly offended many of that Gang, is concerning a Question in my Catechism concerning the <HI>Sabbath;</HI> in the Answer I affirm, <HI>Quakers and</HI> Profane Persons are Enemies to a Sabbath, and now I am satisfied to have an oppor∣tunity of showing my reasons to the World, how just, and not invidious this my Charge was, though I mentioned no other Enemies in Judgment, besides <HI>Quakers;</HI> and notwithstanding of all reasons given to <HI>Keith</HI> and others at my House, they seem still to be dissatisfied, but it is for the most part, the peculiar Temper of such as Rangle, and oppose all Reason∣ing: And that I may refer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my self to the Censures of the more unprejudiced, and rational; and I am
<PB N="60" REF="000693_0071_0FA9A1B0762F1418"/>
so far from Recanting, Denying, or Giving any sub∣mission for the Charge, that I am the rather confirm∣ed, it was most just and deserving, and that without all shadow of the guilt of a Calumny, and that for these following reasons. 1. Because I never met with any others that in reallity opposed this Doctrine be∣sides that Party, and though I might hear common Fame accuse others, and meeting with none of their Writings, I had no Warrant, for including them un∣der the publick Charge, though my Answer does no way exclude them. 2. All the <HI>Quakers</HI> I ever con∣versed with in <HI>Europe</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> declared this as their undoubted Judgment, that all Dayes were alike under the Gospel, and none of perpetual Observation as a Day of Rest; and further, That they were as free to Work, or Labour in their several Callings, and Trades on the First Day of the Week, (called now the Christian Sabbath, or Day of Rest, under the Gospel,) as any other Day of the Week; of which I gave, and am able yet to give several Instan∣ces: And I am lately informed, of several Servants of <HI>Quakers,</HI> otherwise Educated, who have made com∣plaint to Magistrates, of their Masters, causing them to follow their daily Labour; and a Witness yet alive, can declare, being on a <HI>Sabbath</HI> at <HI>Thomas Everdens</HI> House, perceived no manner of Worship with his Family, but great diligence in dispatching one of his Servants with Necessaries for Building a Sloop; &amp; I have met one of them with a Gun in the Woods on the Sabbath, or First Day of the Week, while we were going to the Publick Worship of God; if such are not to be looked on, without any just Ac∣cusation, of an invidious Calumny, Enemies to a Sabbath, let the World judge. 3. They need not make so great a noise, and clamour at this Charge;
<PB N="61" REF="000693_0072_0FA9A1B21559C648"/>
forhowever others may remain ignorant, yet it is not unknown to <HI>Keith,</HI> how oft by several others <HI>Quakers</HI> have been ranked in with several others, Enemies of the Sabbath, long before I had any acquaintance with their principles: as by Mr <HI>John Brown,</HI> in his Latine Treatise, concerning the Sabbath, also Mr <HI>Matthew Crawford</HI> in his Learned defence of the Morality of the <HI>Fourth Commandment,</HI> called <HI>Exercitacio Apolo∣getica;</HI> therefore this charge is not mine only, but of as many as Treat <HI>of</HI> that Subject. 4. I<HI>f</HI> I <HI>can produce their own Word, charging them with as much as I say, will it not appear how unjustly they seem to to be offended at my charge;</HI> and <HI>if</HI> any would pe∣ruse that small, but angry Pamphlet <HI>of Quakers,</HI> so∣berly answered by Mr. <HI>Mitchel of Aberdeen;</HI> and they shall find it confidently asserted, that all Days, are alike, and are told <HI>from Rom.</HI> 14. 6. <HI>&amp; Gal.</HI> 4. 10, 11. <HI>To Reprehend all such as observe one day of Seven as a Day of Rest; and that all Weekly Observation of a Day is Abolished under the Gospel;</HI> And how <HI>Keith</HI> comes in now <HI>of</HI> Late to tell us <HI>of</HI> their keeping the first <HI>Day of the Week,</HI> without being first reconciled to his <HI>own Brethren,</HI> both <HI>in Practice, and Judgment;</HI> And it yet remains <HI>for</HI> him to declare, <HI>By what Authority, or from what Command they keep that Day, and not another; whe∣ther it is commanded of God, or only an Ecclesiastick, and Humane Constitution, which until proved to be the Unanimous Judgment of</HI> Quakers, <HI>must be looked upon to be the Private Judgment of</HI> Keith <HI>only.</HI> But he is Pleased to say, <HI>That</HI> Quakers <HI>keep the first Day of the Week, and spend it in the Religious Exer∣cise of Publick, and Private Worship;</HI> but this is

said, and not Proved; <HI>for</HI> the contrary is known to most who resort <HI>to,</HI> and <HI>frequent</HI> their Houses; where they discern no more Worship in many <HI>of</HI> their Families, than in the Families of <HI>Indians:</HI> And <HI>He Appeals to their Neighbours as Witnesses,</HI> but <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Witnesses have affirmed the contrary, and how they can attest to a Worship which can be neither seen nor heard, it passes my skill to Determine</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, As many as know <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> cannot be ignorant how nei∣ther from Obedience to God or Man, could be perswaded to observe the First Day <HI>of</HI> the Week, but would keep open their Shops, and follow their several Callings; <HI>for</HI> which they were often drawn to Prisons, and their Goods carryed away; this was not done in a Corner, but manifest <HI>&amp;</HI> known to all And tho' <HI>Keith</HI> blamed me, <HI>for</HI> not char∣ging Mr. <HI>John Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ume,</HI> as an Enemy, as well as they, but had not the least reason <HI>for</HI> so doing, <HI>for</HI> I had <HI>oft</HI> conversed with <HI>Calumis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> and Read the Writings <HI>of</HI> his <HI>F</HI>ollowers, who stoutly defended the Morality <HI>of</HI> a Sabbath, or the <HI>Fourth Command.</HI> And what∣ever over zealous mistake that Eminent Man <HI>of</HI> God was under, when he Wrote his I<HI>nstitutions,</HI> yet in his <HI>Exposition</HI> on <HI>Genesis,</HI> about Eighteen Years after he Wrote his I<HI>nstitutions,</HI> owns the Morality <HI>of</HI> the <HI>Fourth Command,</HI> and it could not be ceremonial, seeing the <HI>Institution of</HI> a perpetual <HI>Sabbath,</HI> was before all Ceremonies, and that this was <HI>Calums</HI> last Sentiments, is not only Evident from that <HI>Commentary,</HI> but also <HI>from</HI> the Principles and <HI>P</HI>ractices, <HI>of</HI> the <HI>Reformed Churches of France,</HI> and <HI>Geneva, of</HI> which <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ume</HI> was the First <HI>Refor∣mer</HI> Now all these things duely considered, &amp; put together, I leave it to any to determine, how <HI>far</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="000693_0074_0FA9A1B37920E890"/>
they are wronged in being reckoned with, or numbered among the Enemies to a Sabbath; which has set their peevish Spirit in a flame a∣gainst my Catechism, and stirred up their Venom against me, which I ever shall little regard</P>
<P>In page 28. I am Charged with Deficiency, concerning Ministers, and that in three things: and I am ready to own I have wilfully Omitted twice three things concerning Ministers Qualifica∣tions, and Call; and pray where is the crime∣seeing there are so full Treatises by others on that Subject already Published; and all I intended in my Catechism for Young Ones, was only to lay down the several Duties of Ministers and People; and if I had been guilty of an Omission in that E∣numeration, he might have found fault; but I must take notice of an invidious Parenthesis, that Peoples Maintaining their Ministers is a main thing with me. Let the Reader examine my Catechism, and he shall not find ground for this malicious Reflection; for it is expressed in as few words as any other Duty with∣out in fisting thereon, and this was the expression of an absolute Strange<HI>r</HI> to me, and my practice in Re∣lation to a Maintainance, to which I am bold to as∣sert, <HI>I</HI> have been ever undenied as <HI>Keith,</HI> or any of his Brethren. And whatever others have done, I dare affirm, I never bargained with any people about a Maintainance; and have oft refused mony when free∣ly offered, and never Enjoyed any Maintainance, but what was most freely offered to me; though I deny not to the Magistrate, a power of Determining Maintainances, when Necessity requires it; and none so unwilling to pay it as perverse <HI>Quakers,</HI> though <HI>I</HI> could wish it were voluntary Offerings; yet this par∣tial Author would insinuate, as if Presbyterians only
<PB N="64" REF="000693_0075_0FA9A1B434721238"/>
were Guilty; exacting Maintainance by force; whereas he cannot be ignorant, that the Maintain∣ance of Ministers in <HI>Scotland,</HI> are not to be compared to what Prelates have, whether Popish or Protestant, neither for quantity, not manner of Exacting. And it is observable, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> have been brawling and barking unreasonably against all who receive Maintainance, as Hirelings; but the greatest Cham∣pions among them, were never able to defend so bad a Cause, as they have been tenacious in for a long time; though now of late, they seem to change their Tunes, and own a Maintainance, providing it be voluntary, and not by Compulsion, as <HI>Barclay</HI> has owned, who has taken upon him to <HI>P</HI>ublish <HI>Quakers</HI> Principles, though he never produced any Commis∣sion for it; and I am perswaded, he will find it as hard a matter to procure their universal Consent, and Approbation to all he has Wrote; but a Mi∣nisters Maintainance among <HI>Quakers</HI> must be volun∣tary, and free, for they would never Exact it by force, for two Reasons 1. Because they never had the Government solely in their Hands, for in <HI>Pensilvania</HI> they are a mixed people; neither would the Infancy of that Plantation bear it; beside that, their former Railings would have Retorted upon themselves. 2. Because of the multitude of their Teachers, and the Weakness of many of them, that dare not claim a Right to any such Maintainance, as many silly wo∣men, and ignorant Mechanicks And it must be for measure or quantity, a necessary Competency, or A∣liment, as <HI>Barclay</HI> calls it; but must <HI>Quakers</HI> only be Judges of this Competency, or should the Giver, or rather the Civil Magistrate to determine it accor∣ding to the several Abilities of the People: And consider what narrow and niggardly Souls these peo∣ple
<PB N="65" REF="000693_0076_0FA9A1B4EF8EBA78"/>
have, who would allow no more to the Mini∣sters of the Gospel, then common Charity obliges them to give to the most common beggar that goes from Door to Door, even a necessary Competency, and Aliment; whereas <HI>M</HI> inisters should have such a Maintainance as they may not be necessitated to in∣tangle, and incumber themselves with secular Affairs, and be diverted from their holy Office, and Mini∣sterial Calling, whereunto they have been Called, and to which they are to be Separated according to the Command of God, concerning <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barna∣bas;</HI> and further, they ought to have such an Ho∣nourable Allowance, as they may not only Live an∣swerable to their Station, and be able to maintain Duties to Hospitality, which <HI>Quakers</HI> Competency, and necessary Aliment, will never render them capa∣ble to perform: And it were no hard matter to prove, that many <HI>Quakers,</HI> even <HI>Keith</HI> and <HI>Barclay</HI> them∣selves, whose Birth, Education, Travels and Estates are known to many yet alive, have had much more given then their necessary Aliment.</P>
<P>And I know not what Evasion can be found for <HI>K'</HI>s Hundred Pound <HI>Per Annum</HI> setled on him by the <HI>Government in Pensilvania,</HI> Exacted <HI>of</HI> a mixed <HI>P</HI>eople, who neither hear him, nor enjoy any benefit or advantage from his School-Keeping, which is their only shift and Back-Door, they would fly out at; which will never Blind the eyes <HI>of</HI> the Rational; <HI>for</HI> School Keeping has a peculiar advantage attending it self, without any Publick Tax by compulsion, as they call all our Mentai∣nances. And I Dare be bold to say, in behalf <HI>of Prosbyterians</HI> whom he would chiefly seem to re∣proach, that they are as little concerned about men∣tainances as any of the Reformed Churche<HI>s,</HI> and
<PB N="66" REF="000693_0077_0FA9A1B5B34653D8"/>
value them not, when they come in competition with theirs. And have not the Ministers of the Reformed Church of <HI>Scot and,</HI> these Thirty years past, have suffered Persecution, even unto Death it self, for preaching the Gospel under to much want, that they have been necessitated to Labour with their won hands, and be take themselves for a time to Merchandising, and yet never would dare to lay aside the Preaching of the Gospel And it is not unknown, how little Ministers have had <HI>of</HI> Mentainance in <HI>Maryland,</HI> either voluntary or com∣pelled; And <HI>Quakers</HI> themselves, own they have Stock <HI>P</HI>urses, out of which they <HI>S</HI>upply their Teach∣ers, and others; and what call you this but a Maintainance; and it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> easy when they come abroad, to conceal their <HI>P</HI>lenty at home, that the Stock Purses may be the more Liberal un∣to them, as I doubt not but those of <HI>Maryland, &amp; Virginia</HI> too, were in his <HI>L</HI>ate Travels, which was the least he could have, for he gained but few <HI>Proselytes.</HI> And let all Judge how inconsistent their present practices are, with their former un∣reasonable pratling against every thing that look∣ed like a Maintenance, urging as <HI>K.</HI> still does, that Text, <HI>Freely ye have Received, Freely Give,</HI> which was the Advice of Out Saviour to his A∣postles, when he enabled them to go forth and work Miracles, <HI>Heal the Sick, Cleanse this Lepers, Raise the Dead, Cast out Devils,</HI> of which they should make no Merchandiz; tho' they were <HI>Commanded to Preach tho Gospel as they go along, tending them that the Time of the Promised</HI> Messiah, <HI>was now come, who was setting up his Kingdom in the Word, and to whose Laws they were to be obedient.</HI> This Doctrine they were to confirm by Mira∣cles,
<PB N="67" REF="000693_0078_0FA9A1B6780E8660"/>
which he gives them a Charge, they should work freely, <HI>without receiving any Reward for them;</HI> that the Miracles being used to their private use, and profit, might not lose their End, which was the confirmation of their Doctrine; now it hereby was understood they should receive no necessary Maintenance, the Apostles might Rationally Judge, they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then to provide well for their jour∣ney; no, as, <HI>if</HI> Our Lord had said, <HI>Provide nei∣ther God, no Silver, I nor Brass in your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, nor Scrip for your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, neither two Coats, neither shoes, nor staves;</HI> and the reason added, for the workman is warthy of his Meat, an else where, is worthy of his Hire, and pray what is Mear, and Hire, but the best of Maintenance; and it is observable, the Command for going abroad to bare, in the to of <HI>Matthew</HI> was only a Tempo∣rary Command for that short Journey; for in Luke; they were commanded to take both P<HI>urse</HI> and S<HI>crip,</HI> ch 22 If they were commanded to take none of these things and yet to go abread, and Preach the Gospel, confirming the same with Mi∣racles, they must have received maintenance, or they must have perished if their Journey had been long; but Our Lord designed thereby (1) To give his Apostles an experience of depending on his Good Providence and (2) Also teach People, That the Labourer is worthy of his Hire; and let <HI>Keith</HI> consider that in respect of God all things is free, therefore his School-keeping should be free also. And it is not to be doubt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d that our Saviour took Men∣tainance himself, sometimes asking, sometimes taking without asking, what he stood in need of, as Water from the <HI>Samaritan</HI> Woman, and the Ears of Corn on the Sabbath. And it is to be admitted with what
<PB N="68" REF="000693_0079_0FA9A1B7334A6AB8"/>
Impudence Quakers plead against the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> in denying the lawfulness of Ministerial Receiving a Maintainance, seeing he gives so particular a Precept, Gal. 6 6. <HI>Let him that is Taught in the Word, Com∣municate unto him that Teacheth, in all good things;</HI> and if this be the Command of God, it must be Sin in the people to omit it. But the same Apostle pleads for, and reasons the case fully, 1 Cor. 9. wherein he has many convincing Arguments against all Qua∣kers in the world; proving first, That the Main∣taining of Ministers and Families is warrantable, from 4, 5, 6 verses. 2. In the following Verse he declares the Law says as much, both the Law of God and the Law of Nature, built upon Equity, pleads for it, 8, 9, 10 <HI>verse.</HI> 3. Common Equity and Justice pleads for it, <HI>verse</HI> 11. I<HI>f we have sown to you Spiritual Things, is it a great thing, if we shall Reap your Carnal Things;</HI> yet all <HI>Pauls</HI> forbearing at several times to partake of Peoples Carnal Things, did not at all demonstrate the unlawfulness thereof, but only his prudential declining of that he had really a Right unto as expressed, <HI>verse</HI> 12.</P>
<P>If others be Partakers of this power over you, are not we rather: Nevertheless we have not used this power, but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the Gospel of Christ, and this was the rea∣son why he wrought with his own Hands; and Lastly the Apostle concludes with the Necessity of Ministers living by the Gospel, they Preach from the Ordination of God 14 Even so hath the Lord Ordained, that they that Preach the Gospel, should Live of the Gospel. But if <HI>Quakers</HI> all this while, are only against Superfluous Maintenances they have lost their Labour, for we pleaded not for such, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for any other accidental Abuses, that through

Raised, and Immediately Called of God, in that great Exigence of the Church, in calling the People of God out of Popish Darkness, and Super∣stition, in bringing them out of Babylon; yet this will prove but a slender Argument for <HI>Quakers</HI> hold∣ing Extraordinary Calls, and immediate Missions, to be Gods ordinary and usual uninterrupted way to the end of the World; because it might be allowed of in that juncture of the Necessity of the Church; for though our Lord himself, the King of his Church, at the beginning of the Promulgation of the Gospel, Called some in an Extraordinary Manner; though at the same time, they had an External Call from Christ as man; yet as soon as the Christian Church began to Encrease, he Commands them to use se∣cond Means for that Calling, and Separation of o∣thers to the Holy Office of the Ministry in an Or∣dinary and Holy Separation to that Sacred Work, as <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> was commanded to be Separa∣ted, and there was Casting of <HI>L</HI>ots used in supplying the number of the Apostles; and the Apostle P<HI>aul</HI> commands <HI>Timothy,</HI> and Impowers him to Ordain Elders in every Church, and not to neglect the Gift that was given him by Prophecy, with the Laying on of the Hands of <HI>the</HI> P<HI>resbytery,</HI> who are Com∣manded to Lay Hands suddenly on no man without sufficient proof of his Parts, and Piety. And further, for their direction in this Scriptural and Orderly Se∣paration and Ordination, God has laid down all the Qualifications of Ministers of the Gospel; which <HI>Quakers</HI> can never find in all their Teachers, especially of the Feminine Sex.</P>
<P>As to our Reformers receiving their Ordination, Mission and Call from <HI>Rome,</HI> and conveying it to us, which would seem to be the first great puzling and
<PB N="74" REF="000693_0084_0FA9A1BC2BFA6470"/>
confounding Argument. I shall answer it in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> following particulars. 1. I would inquire of all <HI>Quakers,</HI> whether God in that great defection and universal Corruption of the Church, under <HI>Romish</HI> Idolatry, had then a Church in the World, though in the Wilderness; to deny all Churches, whether Visible or Invisible, really belonging to God, &amp; Jesus Christ, were to overthrow many Promises of God to his Church, of Building her upon an immoveable Rock and that the Gates of Hell should not prevail against her, and it is inconsistent to say, God had a Church among the <HI>Jews</HI> under their Defections, and Fallings away to Idolatry, and Superstition: Now where Christ has a Church, though invisible &amp; in the Wil∣derness, there are the Essentials of Religion, Ordi∣nation, and Church-constitution, tho' much infected with Error, and corrupted with Romish Superstition, and these Essentials are still Gods, and to esteem his and not theirs, who are the chief Instruments, Heads, and Authors of all the Corruptions, under that De∣fection to whom only and properly belong those Er∣rors, Corruptions, Idolatries and Superstitions they have invented and introduced to the Church; And yet the soundest of Divines believe, that upon all Reformations, which undoubtedly are originally and efficiently of God; a people, or particular persons leaving and Renouncing the Abominations of Anti∣christ, and their submitting to, and embracing the Truth of the Gospel, and the Purity of all Ordi∣nances, and Worship, abandoning the P<HI>ope</HI> as their Head, and <HI>S</HI>ubjecting themselves to Christs King∣dom, they are <HI>ipso fact;</HI> Constituted Churches of Je∣sus Christ, and the Gospel Truths, Ordination and Ordinances, Word and <HI>S</HI>acraments they adhere to, are not theirs, nor from those they Separated front,
<PB N="75" REF="000693_0085_0FA9A1BD0C524048"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Keith</HI> ignorantly and invidiously asserts; but they are still the Lords, and belong to Jesus Christ; for even in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and under Antichrist, there were Ordinances of Jesus Christ, Word and Sacraments, Praying Preaching, and Praising of Gods, tho' much vailed and corrupted; and consequently they had Ministers or Officers to Dispense these Or∣dinances, who undoubredly had some of the Essen∣tials of Ordination, which was the Lords, and no∣thing was properly Antichrists, but Antichristian Corruptions, of which he is Author; for <HI>differen∣tle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> specicon:</HI> so that we no more have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the Pope, upon Reformation, then we have Baptism, and the Lords Supper, Reading and Praising; and <HI>Quakers</HI> have Prayer, Teaching the Scriptures, and their new Observa∣tion of the First Day of the Week.</P>
<P>And we would gladly know from what part of Gods Word is it, or can it be made to appear, that upon every Defection and Corruption of the Church, God will Beget and Create New Church∣es in an immediate manner under the Gospel, more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on under the Law; For after the Detections <HI>of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and long continuance in Idolatry, upon their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Reformation from all their Corup∣tions, and Abuses, they were Re Established &amp; to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unto all the Ordinances, and Priviledges of the Church of God; and what does <HI>Keith</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of them, and their Reformation, dare he affirm they had all their Ordination and Worship from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Who made</HI> Israel <HI>to Sin,</HI> and other chief idolaters; so it will unquestionably follow, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Ordination, Dectrine, Worship, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> while warranted from the Autho∣or of Gods Word, are from <HI>Rome,</HI> the Pope,
<PB N="76" REF="000693_0086_0FA9A1BD3939CBA8"/>
or any Prelate in the World, as <HI>Quakers,</HI> after the manner of Satan, would Accuse the <HI>Brethren.</HI> Thus <HI>Keiths</HI> invincible <HI>Armado</HI> is beat to pieces; whereby he thought to have overthrown all Chur∣ches, who have obeyed Gods Call; and are come out of Babylon. And we are confident that a great part of our Teachings are Christian Experi∣ences, to which we oft publickly do Appeal for Confirmation of what is delivered, and many Preachers have a peculiar way of Preaching their own Experiences.</P>
<P>And finally, as he begins, so he closes &amp; shuts up his Paper with groundless, &amp; False Calumnies, and invidious Reflections; affirming, I aslert and alledge False things, concerning <HI>Baptism,</HI> and the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> and First concerning <HI>Baptism,</HI> (he saith) First, I do not distinguish between <HI>Johns Baptism,</HI> and Christ; In answer to this, I Freely assent to any, and all the distinction made in the Scriptures; which is not in Substance, or Essence, but in Fruit, and Efficacy, and the same distinction I still make between our External Administration, and Christs Efficacious Blessing thereof: for what <HI>John</HI> said, we and all Ministers of the Gospel to the end of the World, must still acknowledge; we <HI>Baptise</HI> with <HI>Water,</HI> but Christ, and he alone, <HI>Baptiseth</HI> with the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> and with <HI>Fire,</HI> And if the <HI>Baptism</HI> Administred by Christs Disciples, in His <HI>Name,</HI> Authority and Presence, was Christs and no doubt it was the same with <HI>Johns</HI> for Substance, as you or any other may Read <HI>John</HI> 2. 22, 23, 24, 26. <HI>verses.</HI> For,</P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>Baptism</HI> wherewith Christ and His Disciples Baptised in the <HI>L</HI>and of <HI>Judes</HI> was <HI>Water Baptism.</HI> 2. It was an outward, visible, and dis∣cernable

Baptism to Spectators; saith <HI>Johns</HI> Disci∣ples to him, <HI>Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond</HI> Jordan, <HI>the same Baptizeth, and</HI> all <HI>men come unto him:</HI> it is observable, that it was not the Baptism with the Holy Ghost and with Fire, as distinct from the outward Ordinance; <HI>for</HI> it is said, <HI>John</HI> 4 2. <HI>Jesus himself Baptised not, but His Disciples;</HI> yet it is called his, in the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of</HI> this <HI>chap.</HI> and in the 22. <HI>v. of</HI> the <HI>former chap</HI> (1) Because done by his Dis∣ciples. (2) By his Command, and Authority. And it was the same <HI>Baptism,</HI> his Disciples, and Apostles, performed in all and Every Church, where they Preached the Gospel, according to that last Com∣mission <HI>of</HI> Our Lords, immediately before His As∣cension, M<HI>atth</HI> 28. and last <HI>Go Teach, and Baptise all Nations, and Lord am with you, to the end of the World.</HI> Hence Four things are observable in this Text. 1 That, <HI>Teaching of Nations,</HI> yea, <HI>All Nations,</HI> by external means, and instruments, is a Standing and Perpetual Ordinance in the Church <HI>of</HI> Christ, to the end <HI>of</HI> the World. 2 That, as many as are Called Ministers of the Gospel, are also Commissionated <HI>To Baptise also, Go Teach all Nations Baptising them.</HI> 3 That <HI>Water Baptism,</HI> or the External Ordinance, is that Enjoined, or Com∣manded in the Words, and not the <HI>Baptism</HI> with the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> and with <HI>Fire; for</HI> it is enjoined to meer men who can do no more then <HI>John</HI> could do, who Professed he <HI>Baptised</HI> with <HI>Water,</HI> and yet we believe many who were <HI>Baptised</HI> by <HI>John,</HI> received also the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> otherwise a very empty, and insignificant Ordinance, and unprofitable to all, if nothing else was reaped thereby, but <HI>Sprinkling,</HI> or <HI>Washing with Water;</HI> and yet the Outward Mean, Ordinance, and Administration, was from <HI>John,</HI>
<PB N="78" REF="000693_0088_0FA9A1BEBA4A64D0"/>
and the fruit, efficacy and blessing, was from <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and it is bold Impudence, and Arrogant Pre∣sumption, for any to pretend to Baptise with the Ho∣ly Ghost and with Fire, which is Christs peculiar Work, and <HI>P</HI>rerogative. And <HI>Keiths</HI> answer here<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unto in his Book, is void of all satisfaction to any Intelligent Person; for he affirms, tho' no man Bap∣tize with the Holy Ghost efficiently, yet they may instrumentally; we who use the outward mean, Instrument and Ordinance, may through the Blessing, of God, and Efficacious Presence of Christ's Spirit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> undoubtedly are made Instruments of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Grace, Life, and Advantage of that Ordinance: but how <HI>Quakers</HI> can be Instruments of Baptizing, <HI>S</HI>piritually, who are opposite to, and ridicule the outward Ordinance, which is the only proper means, and instrument of Gods own Appointment, I cannot resolve; unless they will take Gods place, by work∣ing without Means, and contrary to Means; or they imagine to work Effects by unsuitable causes, and attain an end by improper means; as if a man inten∣ded to Merchandize, by <HI>L</HI>abouring in the Ground, intend for <HI>Europe</HI> from <HI>America,</HI> and yet Steer to the <HI>South;</HI> or by Planting Tobacco, to imagine to Reap Corn; for I am perswaded, that such as in Faith, Administers the outward Ordinance of Baptism, and that purely according to the Divine Institution, Pray∣ing, and Depending on God for his Blessing, and Christ for his Vertue, and Presence, are in the most probable way of being Instruments of the Grace of Baptism; so that this Baptism is a standing and pen∣petual Ordinance, to the End of the World; which is clearly inferred from the Promise annexed, which is perpetual; and, <HI>Lo I am with you to the End of the World,</HI> as durable as Teaching it self, which the after
<PB N="79" REF="000693_0089_0FA9A1BF727D2008"/>
practice <HI>of the Apostles,</HI> and Servants of Christ to this day Confirm,&amp; should be continued until Christ's Second Coming, notwithstanding of all Gainsayers. He further would insinuate, That we Learned and Received Sprinkling of Children <HI>from the Church of</HI> Rome; but it is easy to make appear, they go hand in hand with <HI>Rome</HI> in more things than we do, who are known to all the Followers of Antichrist to walk more opposite to; and in abhorrence of their Princi∣ples and Practices, then any others: for their Univer∣sal Redemption, their Free will, their denying Per∣severance, their <HI>possible Perfection in this Life, their Vi∣lipending the Scriptures,</HI> and denying it to be the Rule, and their holding <HI>the</HI> P<HI>ope of Rome</HI> not to be <HI>Anti∣christ,</HI> and <HI>their Denying the Morality of the Fourth Command,</HI> they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aked and picked these with many more out of that filthy Sink, and stinking pud∣dle of Romish Corruption; and as for our <HI>S</HI>prinkling in Baptism, it is not so repugnant to Scripture, as perverse <HI>Quakers</HI> do imagine: For Water in Baptism, Represents the Blood of Jesus Christ, and why not <HI>Sprinkling, the Sprinkling of the Blood of Christ,</HI> which is so clearly expressed by the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Hebrews;</HI> but neither <HI>Infant Baptism, nor Sprinkling</HI> is a Controversy between <HI>Quakers</HI> and us; for 1 They are against the <HI>Baptism of Old as well as Young.</HI> (2.) They are against <HI>Washing or Dipping as well as Sprinkling;</HI> therefore I wave both. And next, I shall make appear, That <HI>George Keith is guilty of a double falshood</HI> concerning <HI>Baptism,</HI> in his Book. 1. In opposition to Scripture, to say with his <HI>B</HI>rethren, that Water Baptism was only for <HI>John</HI>s Dispensation, and conse∣quently Abolished, or abrogated in Christ; where it was continued all the time of Christ's Life, and after he was Dead and Gone, and still does without
<PB N="80" REF="000693_0090_0FA9A1C03A396158"/>
all interruption, as any may read in the <HI>Acts</HI> of the Apostle. 2 He contradicteth himself, and his Bre∣thren too, in saying, <HI>that only it stood in force in</HI> Johns <HI>time, and abolished immediately;</HI> yet some may be Sent of the Lord, and Instructed to Baptise with Water, and if they can prove they are Sent of the Lord, should be gladly Received; but <HI>His Labor, hee Opus est;</HI> for how they go about to prove this, they have never yet told us. Now let his Friends and Followers consider and examine, what this man would be at; so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, it is abolished, and yet they may be called by the Spirit of God to <HI>A</HI>dminister it; can it be supposed, that the Spirit of God will call any to Administer that Worship, that is Removed and Abolished by God and His Holy Spirit; were not this to make God and His Holy Spirit, who are Es∣sentially one, to Clash with themselves, which were Biasphemy to affirm? He impugnes <HI>Water Baptism,</HI> with all his might, as not now warranted by Scrip∣ture; and yet will Justifie a Call, and Mission to Administer Abrogated Worship; and from the same Argument, why not Called and Sent to perform all the Abrogated Services, Rites and Sacrifices under the Law, as <HI>Circumcision, the Passover, and all</HI> L<HI>egal Sacrifices;</HI> and so from a pretended Call, to set up again the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>saical Worship?</HI> This would be a brave Spiritual Work indeed; and to make this appear to be the Judgment of others of that Party, as well as his own; he acknowledged at my House, <HI>A Quaker once Baptised with Water, and was approved of for it.</HI> Is Water Baptism not warranted by Scripture, but Abolished since <HI>Johns</HI> Dayes, and yet performed and approved of by those who are Enemies thereunto, from an imaginary, and unknown Cast, and Mission, which would be to introduce the grossest Enthusiasm

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the World, and an open door to all wild fancies, and imaginations? Let <HI>Keiths</HI> Friends and Follow∣ers, beware of this mans principles, and Books.</P>
<P>And concerning the Lords <HI>S</HI>upper, he asperses us all; but I doubt not to make it convincingly appear, that he both contradicteth Scripture, and his Brethren too: 1 He contradicteth Scripture, in undervaluing this great Ordinance, as no Special, Divine, Spiritual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Gospel Ordinance; but Jumbles it in with the com∣mon and dayly Eating, and ordinary means of Believers: an high indignity to this Ordinance, and the Author of it, repugnant to Scripture, and inconsistent with the sure, and certain experience of thousands <HI>of</HI> the Godly, who have <HI>Eat</HI> at the Table of the Lord, to their un∣speakable comfort, and transporting Consolation, more then they reaped by their ordinary Meals, so that Christian Experience witnesseth against them, and confures all their Quibling Arguments, and Sophisti∣cal Quirks; and my own experience of the Grace, Blessings, and Benefits, of this Great Special, and Solemn Ordinance, shall be an unanswerable Ar∣gument to me, against all <HI>Hereticks</HI> in the World. And it is also strange, with what impudent Spirit, they can call the <HI>Supper of the Lord</HI> no <HI>Special Ordinance</HI> distinct from Ordinary Meals. For, (1) Our Lord oft Eat with Mixed Multitudes; but in this Ordinance with a Select Number of his own, even his Apostles: (2) He never did Celebrate that Ordinance, but one, and that was in the very Night, <HI>wherein he was Betrayed;</HI> a great Argu∣ment of his Love, and Faithfulness to his Church. (2) He Instituted it immediately after the P<HI>assover,</HI> and that <HI>Hymn</HI> that was usually <HI>Sung,</HI> after the <HI>Passover,</HI> was deferred till after the Administration of the <HI>L</HI>ords Supper, to signify the Abrogation of the
<PB N="82" REF="000693_0092_0FA9A1C1B5950E68"/>
one, and Institution of the other in its Room, and Place (4) At what other Meals, did ever Our Lord say, <HI>This is my Body and as oft as you do it, do it in Remembrance of me?</HI> (5) Those that make their Ordinary Meals to be the Lords Supper, which is a new notion of <HI>K</HI>'s, they alter the E∣llements at your Pleasure, which are Signs institu∣ted of God, the <HI>Bread</HI> to signify his <HI>Flesh,</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> to signify his <HI>Blood;</HI> and they Arrogantly <HI>&amp;</HI> Presumptuously appoint others, <HI>Fish, Flesh,</HI> and what ever comes in the way, far from the practice <HI>of</HI> the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> in the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> who delivered nothing to that Church in this great Or∣dinance, but what he received of the Lord Jesus, the Author of it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> retaining all, the Essentials both <HI>for</HI> matter, and manner, waving only some occasio∣nal, and accidental Circumstances, therefore Ad∣ministers it in Bread and Wine. 2 He Reflects on us, by charging us with <HI>Popish Consecrations,</HI> but in this, and many things else, he cannot be so Ignorant, as Malicious; for he knows, we abhor all <HI>Popish Consecration;</HI> And all we do, is only to Pray to God for a Blessing on the Elements, that God would be preased to vouchsafe his Gracious Presence, and Sanctify the Elements of Bread and Wine, making his own Ordinance Effectual, for the Spiritual Nourishment of Believers: and as we Eat Bread, and Drink Wine, so we may Feed by Faith, and Spiritually upon Jesus Christ, and what <HI>Popery</HI> is here, let the World judge. All this <HI>K</HI> has seen in our Directory for Publick Worship.</P>
<P>Lastly, In his Book, he Quarrels our Eating in this Ordinance so Sparingly, and would seem to approve of a Plentiful Meal, and a full Stomach, and commend the Quantity; but I am sure this is
<PB N="83" REF="000693_0093_0FA9A1C27AC50B40"/>
not Spiritual, but Carnal: Arguing to the Pampen∣ing of our Flesh; and Flarly contrary to the Appre∣hension <HI>Paul</HI> gives to the carnal <HI>Corinthians,</HI> even Eating at the Lords Table, to the Nourishment of their Bodies; which was a great and Sinful abuse of that Holy Ordinance, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 22. <HI>What have ye not Houses to Eat and Drink in, or despise ye the Church of God;</HI> showing that Eating the Lords Supper, is another thing then Eating at home, only to the Nourishment of our Bodys, for which the Holy Or∣dinance of the Lords Supper was never instituted.</P>

<P N="2">2. That these Twenty Eight pretended Preachers at this time look on <HI>George Keith</HI> and consequently all his Party, none of their present but late Friend, and consequently now their Enemy; and so the name Friend must no longer be a general Epithite or universal title peculiar to that Party, o<HI>r George Keith</HI> must be only a Late <HI>Quaker.</HI></P>
<P>The Occasion of all this Clamour, <HI>&amp;</HI> Heat, is gi∣ven by <HI>K.</HI> pag. 2 To be an Accusation of <HI>K</HI> by <HI>W.

horrour, when they consider the deplorable case of such, as are Lead, and Taught by these men; who openly, publickly, and avowedly, profess their Ig∣norance <HI>of</HI> the true Christ, which is but One, and can be no other; even, <HI>He that was Born of the Virgin Mary, Suffered in the World, was Crucified with∣out the Gates of</HI> Jerusalem; <HI>was Buried, &amp; Rose again, with the same Body, having his wounds upon him, as he shewed to</HI> Thomas <HI>the</HI> Apostle; <HI>&amp; after some time of Converse in the World, proving thereby the Reality of his Resurrection, was received Bodily into a Cloud, in the open view of his</HI> Apostles, <HI>and Ascended into Heaven, &amp; now</HI> Sits <HI>at the Right Hand of God the Father, making con∣tinual intercession for sinners; &amp; the same Man-Christ, that Liveth for Ever, &amp; Ever, shall come in his Glory, with all his Holy Angels, to Judge the World in Righte∣ousness at the Last Day:</HI> All which is abundantly testified in the Holy Scriptures.

<P>And this Breach is Risen to such a height, that the Railings, Revilings, bitter &amp;uncharitable Accusations,
<PB N="88" REF="000693_0098_0FA9A14B1F188688"/>
they were wont to vomit maliciously, against all the Reformed Churches, are now justly turned against one another; for <HI>Lloyd</HI> and his Party fly out against <HI>Keith,</HI> calling him a Reviler of the Brethren, Brat of <HI>Babylon,</HI> Accuser <HI>of the Brethren;</HI> one that alwayes endeavoureth to keep down the power of Truth; drawing from the Gift of God; calling him also Pope, Primate of P<HI>ensilvania,</HI> Father Confessor, ac∣cusing him of Envy, extream Passion, a turbulent &amp; unsubdued Spirit: Let the Authors of these make good their Charge, or let them take what follows. Shall ever such a man be followed by such as have given him such a monstrous Character, as none but the greatest of Impostors deserve; and it is observable, that in all which <HI>K</HI> has Published, for he has carried the day in his Prints; that he has not fairly, nor fully Explained himself, for it wants to be determined, when Christ is said to be in all men, by the name Light; whether he and his Party, who say with all <HI>Quakers,</HI> He is substantially in them, believe him to be in them as Mediator and <HI>S</HI>aviour, as <HI>K</HI> seems to assert in his <HI>Grounds of Separation.</HI> pag. 32 &amp; <HI>William</HI> P<HI>en,</HI> in Reason against Railing, asserts the true Light with which every man is Enlightned, to be sufficient for Salvation; and how P<HI>en, G.

and immediately with the same Breath, they throw him down, any look upon him as <HI>Falien from the high Places of</HI> Israel, as a man Slain in his High Places: &amp; as they fix hard names upon him as formerly; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he payes them home again in the same Coin; &amp; calls <HI>Lloyd</HI> and his Party, which are some thousands, <HI>Fools, Ignorant Heathens, Infidels, Silly Souls, Lyars, Hereticks, Rotten Ranters, Muggletonians,</HI> &amp;c <HI>S</HI>o that if we were inclinable to give them Names, we have no Room, for they have done it to our hands themselves: And I must confess, they are better able than we; for they are better acquainted with one another, and privy to their Errors, Heresies, and other <HI>Hidden Works of Darkness,</HI> which they have hitherto been ashamed to Publish to the World: and yet it is admirable to think, where these men find such a stock of Confi∣dence, as to wipe their mouths, and say they have not Railed all this while, but all they have said on both sides, is in the uprightness of their hearts, &amp; all these Names given are Truth, <HI>I</HI> shall leave them so, disproving neither; one of <HI>Lloyds</HI> Party, <HI>William Gabitas</HI> desired <HI>K</HI> to forbear Preaching Christ without, seeing it gave Offence to his Bre∣thren, as <HI>Paul</HI> did concerning Eating of Flesh: an able Doctor indeed, and very probable to have Christ in him, who valued the Preaching <HI>of</HI> Christ Crucified no more than the Eating of Feline and must not such Brethren as take Offence as such Doctrine be acted by a Diabolical Spirit? <HI>Thomas Lloyd,</HI> in a Publick Meeting affirmed, no man could differ with <HI>G.

&amp; flow from no good Spirit: another proud and self-conceited expression of a plain <HI>Quaker, Must, I truckle under thee;</HI> indeed it was not fit a Govern∣our should; and further, <HI>G. K.</HI> affirmed, That no such Damnable Heresies, and Doctrines of Devils were Tolerated in any Protestant Society, as among <HI>Quakers,</HI> at <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> if this Charge is true, I am perswaded it will extend to most <HI>Quakers</HI> in the World, or they must yet be in Confusion and Unde∣termined about their Principles Many other most dangerous Positions were urged and disputed among them, savouring of nothing but Blindness and Error, as one that owned no man Christ Jesus as Mediator in Heaven without him, but the Grace of God with∣in; and also the Christ was only a Spirit in Heaven, and had nothing of the Body; and many of them denying the Day of Judgment, and any Resurrection, but what they have already attained; &amp; <HI>John Wills∣ford</HI> said, Christ was a Mediator for no Drunkards &amp; wicked persons, but for his own Disciples; many <HI>of</HI> them denied Gods Presence in all his Creatures, Ar∣guing most ignorantly, and blasphemously: if God be in Herbs and Grass, then who tramples on them, tramples on God; and this occasioned a new Dispute, whether God be present in Lice? Some denying they were any part of the Creation; another Preach∣es, that Christ Cureth mens Souls perfectly at once, and makes them free of all sin; and when we are perfect, we are Kings, and are not to Beg or Pray to God for our selves: another says Whether that Body that was Crucified, be in Heaven, Let the Church determine? one <HI>Samuel Ginnings</HI> declared in a Meeting, <HI>That to do Gods Business we needed Gods Wisdom,</HI> but to do our own Business as men, we needed it not! another affirmed, <HI>That a man might

speak unsound Words in the</HI> L<HI>ife;</HI> and at another Mee∣ting the same man bids us wait, <HI>That the Scepter might depart from</HI> Judah, <HI>that</HI> Shiloh <HI>might come.</HI> Is it not evident from these gross, impertinent, and a∣bominable Ignorances, and Blasphemous Heresies, <HI>That God has justly given them over to a Spirit of</HI> Delusion, to believe the grossest Lyes that ever was hatcht; and that for their ambitious and deceiving pretences to unwarrantable Inspirations. Another Quarrel was, <HI>G. K'</HI>s Objecting against their Discipline, as too Loose; but for my part, I never knew, nor heard any they had that was purely Ecclesiastick; &amp; what they pretended to was most absolute and arbitrary: tho' I understand of late <HI>G. K.</HI> had Composed a new Draught in many particulars, which tho' not allowed a Reading at their Yearly Meeting, yet was sent to the Yearly Meeting at <HI>London,</HI> for their Approbation &amp; Sanction: of which I shall give my Reader a small tast in these following particulars: 1. That all faith∣ful Friends shall give in a few words less or more a pure Confession unto the Truth generally Received by Friends. 2. If Friends be satisfied with this Con∣fession, they are to express their Christian Love, and signifie their owning them, by taking them by the hand, or giving the hand unto them. 3. That all Friends who have Children come to years of Discre∣tion, whom they have Instructed in the Principles <HI>of</HI> Truth, that they further Labour with their Children to be willing to be Received into the Number of Friends, in the manner above mentioned. 4. Whe∣ther there should not be Elders and Deacons Chosen, and Appointed, and Named by the Consen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the whole Church, for the Help and Assistance of the Friends of the Ministry. 5. That no raw and unsea∣soned persons do presume to speak or pray in the
<PB N="92" REF="000693_0102_0FA9A1476EE2CAD8"/>
Meetings, until they give proof of their sound Know∣ledge, Experience, and Spiritual Abilities to their Elder Brethren, the Elders and the Church. 6. That no Friends joyn in Marriage with any, but such as are Received into the Society of Fiends, by a solemn Confession of their Faith, and Profession of Truth in the manner aforesaid.</P>
<P>These are but a few of many Articles of the like nature, which had a very cold Reception, that tho' they did not allow it a publick Reading, yet cry'd it down as downright Popery; but sure if this take place, <HI>Quakers</HI> will look with another Face then ever they have yet done; and many of their silly, igno∣rant and impertinent, and blaspemous Teachers, Shall be laid aside as useless. And the Breach was so great, that the two Emissaryes from <HI>London,</HI> T.<HI>W.</HI> and <HI>J D.</HI> was so far from accomplishing a Reconci∣leation, that they Condemned him for the Separati∣on, and pronounced Woes against him; and <HI>J. D.</HI> compared the Difference there, to Childrens falling out about trifles; sure these men so much admired at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and elsewhere, discover both their igno∣rance and weakness in joyning with the strongest Party, the Magistrates;and looking upon the <HI>Doctrine of Christ Crucifyed,</HI> and the <HI>Sufficiency of the</HI> L<HI>ight within</HI> to be but Trifles.</P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>G. K</HI> is blamed for calling <HI>W. Stockdal,</HI> and a whole Meeting, ignorant Heathens; but says <HI>Keith,</HI> if there is Light sufficient to Salvation in all men without the man Christ, then an honest Heathen is a true Christian; hence every man may Learn, That honest Heathens are good <HI>Quakers,</HI> or <HI>Quakers</HI> are good Heathens.</P>
<P><HI>George Keith</HI> having his Sentence, Lay under Charges and no possibility of obtaining (as he says)
<PB N="93" REF="000693_0103_0FA9A1483017BCB0"/>
any redress or Gospel Order; but it is strange that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> man of <HI>S</HI>ense, should expect order from Ignorance, Distraction, and Confusion, as the whole Scheme of this Controversy appears to be to every Rational and considering <HI>M</HI>an; he at Length breaks off, &amp; separates from their Society, and sets up for himself. First at his own House, and generally since, at the <HI>Barbado'</HI>s House in <HI>Philade<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phia;</HI> and as he endeavours to Justify himself from all former Imputations, so he essays a Vindication of the Late Separation which he does by a <HI>Pamphlet,</HI> called the, <HI>Reasons and Causes thereof;</HI> wich I shall give my Reader as Follow∣eth.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because <HI>Thomas Lloyd,</HI> so far failed in Proving his Charge against <HI>G. K For denying the sufficiency of the Light within;</HI> and after Judgment was passed, by a <HI>M</HI>onthly Meeting at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> the 22<HI>d</HI> of the 12<HI>th</HI> Month 1691. Would not give forth a Paper <HI>of</HI> Condemnation <HI>of</HI> his False Charge: but any may perceive <HI>K'</HI>s cunning, who not only escaped the Just Judgment of this Meeting, according to <HI>Quakers</HI> Principles, but by denying the charge with a Reser∣vation, made his accuser guilty; for as he declared before, and since saying <HI>the Light within is not suf∣ficient without the Man Christ Without us</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Reason for his Seperation, because <HI>K'</HI>s Antago∣nists kept a Publick Meeting, in the Afternoon at the Bank, without the consent of the whole Body <HI>of</HI> Friends there; which <HI>K</HI> says should be universal, &amp; Unanimous, and not by any Plurality of Votes: and so <HI>G K</HI> and his party kept a Meeting for that Day in the Afternoon at his own House, which he called Private, and finding as they say, they resolved to continue the Seperation, which is still done. I would Animadvert the Reader, that the Second Reason in
<PB N="94" REF="000693_0104_0FA9A149470BE8C8"/>
Frivolous, arising from a Nicety and circumstance of Place, which as carryed by a Plurality of Votes, tho' <HI>K</HI> would not submit to it, without the Una∣nimous Consent of all; which he says is the al∣lowed method of Friends; but it is not to be doubt∣ed if the Plurality had determined for him, he would never have gone about to invalidate the determinati∣on; and if the Unanimous consent of all be re∣quisite in such trifles, we expect <HI>K</HI> will do nothing in greater Matters without it 3 <HI>Reason:</HI> because most Gross, and Unchristian Errors, against the Fun∣damental Doctrines of the Christian Faith, are held by divers of them that are Publick Teachers, &amp; many are Unqualified for the Ministry; this is a weighty Ground indeed, and a just Cause; and it is not to be doubted, but applicable to both Partys; so that a seperation from them both is Warrantable, which all good Christians are to pray that God may accom∣plish to the Glory of his own Name, and the Honour of Truth as the Issue of the begun Controversy and Confusions; and alass! it must be strange, that all these things have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so long since the Rise of <HI>Quakers in Europe,</HI> and none found Faithful or Zealous for Truth among them, to bring them to Light until this very Prejudice, Passion, and Malice, or envy among them; for it is not to be doubted but <HI>K</HI> in his Travels over the World could not meet with as many Insufficient Teachers as are now among them, in the Government of P<HI>ensilvania, East</HI> and <HI>West Jerl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s;</HI> and also Innumerable impetinen∣cys, Inconsistencys, Errors, and Falshoods, as he has been sensible of, of late, abounds among them; so that it is to be feared, he has been moved from Pre∣judice, Passion, and other Quarrels, whereby he has taken this time and place, for assuming the Honour <HI>of</HI>

New Reformer; for what he charges them with, is no New thing, but known by all who have converst with that Party, to have been their Constant Senti∣ments, as much known to <HI>K,</HI> as any now in being, for the Time he has followed that Novelty. And according to the Present State of Affairs, and Notable Alterations in a Place, so the Discourses of all Regu∣lated, and Directed, for most places of this Province; this Division has given all Partys a Theme of Discourse, and Subject <HI>of</HI> Debate, and <HI>K</HI> in his Postscript to his <HI>Reasons,</HI> gives a Brief account of the matters Contro∣versed, both at Meeting and other Places, we sup∣pose for the Information <HI>of</HI> Inspired Men. As.</P>
<P N="1">1. Whether we are only to believe in Christ Within or in him without also, and in Heaven Our <HI>Advocate with the Father</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Whether to Preach Faith in Christ within, and Faith in Christ without, be to Preach two Christ?</P>
<P N="3">3. Whether it be a Doctrine necessary to be Preacht, to Believe in Christ without? 4. Whether Christ's Body that was Nailed to the Cross, and was Buried, and Arose again, be with him in Heaven? Some of them saying, as <HI>Keith</HI> told me at his House, it never Rose, but Evanished, or Remained in the Grave: others saying, it arose, but after it Ascended in the Cloud, was separated from it: others say, it is a Nicety, and to be ignorant of it, does not hinder a man from being a true Christian, and a Minister of Christ: Others saying, it is a dividing of Christ. O∣thers accusing of some, for Denying the <HI>Sufficiency of the Light within;</HI> from all which it is evident, not∣withstanding of all their high pretences to Immediate Inspirations, and Extraordinary Illuminations from the Spirit of God, what great Error, Ignorance, and Blindness, they discover to the World. 1. Their
<PB N="96" REF="000693_0106_0FA9A14BF0EA04B8"/>
Ignorance of Christ Jesus our Saviour, <HI>whom to Know is External Life;</HI> and whom <HI>Quakers</HI> say, is, &amp; dwells substantially in all of them; and if so, could it be possible to Remain so Ignorant of him, as they pro∣claim themselves to be; and who in their right wits, but must look upon them as deluded Souls, rather than Inspired from Heaven. 2. They know not how necessary the Faith and Knowledge of the true Christ as Mediator, is, to make a true Christian, &amp; real Minister; hence they plainly tell us. what Chri∣stians and Ministers will pass among <HI>Quakers,</HI> even such as neither know Christ aright, nor believe the true Knowledge of him necessary; seeing they call Christ man, Ascended and Glorified in Heaven, a Nicety; conclude all such, Christless Christians, and Christless Ministers.</P>
<P>As an Appendix to the reasons, we have an Ac∣count of the Faith <HI>of Quakers,</HI> published by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ith,</HI> and called in its Frontispiece, the Faith of some <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> in <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> which is an Argument of their difference in Principles, and Fundamentals; but this will not do, being so far from being <HI>Quakers</HI> Princi∣ples every where, that they are not even the Princi∣ples of all in <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> and for any thing I know, but of a very few; <HI>for</HI> tho' it is the Ambition <HI>of</HI> both Parties, to Increase their Numbers, &amp; Engross Followers, yet to this Account of Faith, he has pro∣cured but five Subscribers, beside himself; and as I am Informed, men of mean Parts, and Account; but that I may briefly animadvert all Lovers of Truth, concerning this Account of Faith, which should be Fundamentals chiefly; I shall deliver something in general, and something particularly: And in general 1.

He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by say∣ing, it is sufficient to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every man 4 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> wholly any thing concerning the <HI>Covenant of Work, and Grace,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> points of Faith; seeing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Covenant of Grace, every Sinner must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Saved and Christ is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Covenant</HI> 5.

<PB N="98" REF="000693_0108_0FA9A14D7AF4DD70"/>
mind yet in that point, as he says of other things. 6. He Transiently runs over the Ten Command∣ments. 7. He continues to cry down Swearing, in Witnessing to Truth; while they decry the name, they really maintain and practice the thing in all Courts in <HI>Pensilvania.</HI> 8. He fills up a whole Sec∣tion of their Faith, with Baptism, and the Lords Supper; but seeing it is known to all, they deny the use of both, they should be ashamed ever to Treat of them at all; especially among their Fun∣damentals; for he might as well have filled up a Section with <HI>Circumcision,</HI> and the P<HI>assover:</HI> if it be only to deceive, this is no ingenuous dealing. 9 If plain Language and plain Habits be Fundamentals with <HI>Quakers,</HI> what need is there of any other mark to know a <HI>Quaker</HI> by: and why the Language of others, are not as plain as <HI>Quakers,</HI> I know not; es∣pecially, <HI>as Jacob Tilman,</HI> when Preaching &amp; Pray∣ing in <HI>Dutch,</HI> to an <HI>English</HI> Congregation. Lastly, I fear, according to his Description of Church of Christ, who ought, as he sayes, to manifest their Faith, to one another, by the Confession of the mouth;there will no such be found among Quakers, who never had any publick, and unanimous Confession of their Faith, yet extant; otherwise there would be no room for the present Division, about the greatest of Funda∣mentals. In the next place, I proceed to take notice of <HI>G. K'</HI>s Appeal from the twenty eight Judges, and it has a cunning and ambiguous Title, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR><HI>To the Spirit of Truth &amp; true Judgment, in all Faithful Friends called</HI> Quakers; <HI>that meet at the Yearly Meeting at</HI> Bur∣lington; whereby any man may perceive, if they judge and determine against him, he has a back Door to fly out at, and will not stand to their judgment; therefore his Appeal is most idle, and
<PB N="99" REF="000693_0109_0FA9A14E392BF4B0"/>
an empty Bravado; for either he looks on them, as Competent Judges, or not; if competent Judg∣es, why does he not submit himself to their Judg∣men, without such a Reservation; or thus, if he believes them to have the Spirit of Truth, why does he scruple a submission to the judgment of Friends, as <HI>Quakers</HI> are commonly called, if they have not the <HI>Spirit of Truth,</HI> whether it were not safer to wave the Appeal which has the ambigui∣ty of a dubious Oracle, for still it must terminate here; if the whole Meeting should not be of <HI>K'</HI>s judgment, he shall declare them destitute of the <HI>S</HI>pirit <HI>of Truth, and void of true judgment;</HI> for he has disapproved the plurality <HI>of</HI> Votes in another case. And in the Appeal, there is first by way of Preamble, the Grounds thereof laid down; and next, twelve particulars by way of Query proposed to be Debated at the said Yearly Meeting, which highly offended the Governour, with the rest of the Magistracy that were <HI>Quakers;</HI> and particularly char∣ges them, tho' it is all along by way of Question, with giving a Commission to, and hiring men to Fight, by recovering a Sloop from Privateers, con∣trary to the Principles of <HI>Quakers</HI> who are against <HI>the use of the Carnal Weapon, which they transgress also by providing the Indians with Powder, and Lead, to fight against other Indians; and a so that one of those pretend∣ed Ministers Taught, not to take an Eye for an Eye; &amp; in a short time, by passing Sentence on Malefactors, takes Life for</HI> L<HI>ife; and finally enquires, whether there is any Example for it in Scripture, or in all</HI> Christendom, <HI>That Ministers should Ingross the Worldly Government, as they do in</HI> Philadelphia, <HI>which hath proved of very evil tendency.</HI> Now the last particular proves so of∣fensive, Governour L<HI>loyd</HI> after some Consultation,
<PB N="100" REF="000693_0110_0FA9A14FDB040400"/>
sends <HI>for</HI> a Taylor, who had Nail'd up the Appeal on a Board at his Shop Window, to publick view; and after some Examination, he told them, he was not ashamed, to look Persecutors in the Face, but being Required to give Securities, to answer the Quarter Sessions; they gave him till to morrow morning, to provide them; but from what sharp Retorting An∣swers, he gave them, he was dismissed without any further noise: but immediately sent for the Printer, and Requiring Securities of him, which he denied; his <HI>Shop</HI> was Searched, and all the said Papers, and his Printing Letters, to the value of Ten Pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI> as <HI>K.</HI> says, were taken away; and the said Printer, <HI>William Bradford</HI> was Committed to the Sheriffs House as a Prison. And another <HI>John Mac∣komb,</HI> sent for, and Committed, for Selling some of the said Papers at his House, all which was done in a Legal Mittimus, charging the Printer, and Seller as Publishers; which was a mistake, for properly the Author is the Publisher; &amp; this makes a great noise, both in City and Countrey, that <HI>Quakers</HI> begin to Imprison and <HI>P</HI>ersecute one another, proving what they would do to others if they had power, opportu∣nity, and provocation; but to wipe off all suspicion of Persecution, they make use of the same plea as all other <HI>P</HI>ersecutors do, even the Disturbance of the Peace, and Subversion of the Government: but this <HI>S</HI>alve will not Cure the Sore: The next measures taken, is, to Consult how to punish <HI>G K.</HI> the known Author; and as many of the Subscribers as were un∣der their Government: and next day being the 26<HI>th of August</HI> a Conclave was appointed; but two of the Commissioners being no <HI>Quakers,</HI> Dissenting, they could not bring it to bear, to Sign a Mittimus, for Committing <HI>K;</HI> therefore next day, resolves to publish
<PB N="201" REF="000693_0111_0FA9A15070CBC2A0"/>
a Proclamation against <HI>G K</HI> discharging him, or his A betters from publishing any such Seditious Papers for the future; but it is Observable, that in the Pro∣clamation there is not any mention made of Their Majesties Names; which every Loyal Subject must Resent; but of the Late K. twice, notwithstanding they had Caution given, to mention what King they meant, <HI>Verbum set Sapienti</HI> But the former Prisoners continue still in Confinement; which is palpable and most evident Partiality, to punish the Printer &amp; Seller, and suffer the known Author, and Subscribers to escape. But on the <HI>Monday</HI> following, the Appeal, with the Mittimus, and a Postscript is Re printed; and in the Postscript, as is very Remarkable, that it is Asserted by <HI>K</HI> that it is contrary to <HI>Quakers</HI> princi∣ples, to make use of the <HI>Carnal Weapon;</HI> but they found in their Experience, it was impossible to main∣tain Magistracy without it, that is, the <HI>Carnal Sword,</HI> who can but smile to see these men overthrowing their own Principles, by asserting the Inconsistency of them with Magistracy, which is an Ordinance of God; and consequently no Government should be put into <HI>Quakers</HI> Hands: but great things were ex∣pected from the Yearly Meeting at <HI>Burlington,</HI> which was to begin within few days; tho' little expectation of a Friendly Accommodation; for <HI>G K.</HI> kept out of Town, lest he should by a Prison, be prevented to attend that Meeting; but <HI>K</HI> came off there with Flying Colours; for the other Party being Summo∣ned again and again to Appeal, but declined it: Whether they disowned the Authority of that <HI>M</HI>eet∣ing, or suspected the badness of their Cause, which they had reason to do, or feared <HI>G. K.</HI> his Party to be too strong, they can best answer for themselves; but that Meeting justifyed <HI>G K</HI> and condemned <HI>Lloyd</HI>
<PB N="102" REF="000693_0112_0FA9A1512F595A68"/>
and his Party, discharging them to Teach or Pray in publick <HI>M</HI>eetings, till they had condemn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> their former Judgment, by a publick Writing; and how this Order was slighted, is too palpable to be denied, both Parties are discharged from Raising, which sup∣poses both were guilty; but while the Meeting at <HI>Burlington</HI> clears <HI>K.</HI> the Yearly Meeting at <HI>Maryland,</HI> condemns him, and justifies the other Party, whereby that infallible Discerning Spirit <HI>Quakers</HI> boast of, &amp; say is in every true <HI>Quaker,</HI> is overthrown; for great Meetings of their greatest Dons, can be mistaken, &amp; make contrary and contradictory Orders. I am In∣formed, the Division has Reached <HI>England;</HI> for in <HI>London,</HI> one Party who were against <HI>Keith,</HI> bought up all his Pamphlets, to prevent the Spreading of the Difference: Another Party Orders a new Im∣pression of all his Books, relating to that Controver∣sy; this I had lately of one of themselves. I shall conclude with some passages from undoubted Infor∣mation. 1. One affirmed the Difference at present concerning Christ, was an empty Barrel, from whence it is evident, what mean thoughts this Zealote had of Christ, as Man. 2. Another said, he did not believe to be Saved by that which Dyed <HI>at Jerusa∣lem;</HI> What a poor case must such a Soul be in? 2, <HI>John Delava!</HI> hath exprest his fear that <HI>Cotton Mather'</HI>s Prophesie of <HI>G. K</HI> is now accomplishing. Lastly, there is among <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> one <HI>Jacob,</HI> a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> who takes upon him to Preach and Pray in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Language, to an <HI>English</HI> Con∣gregation, pretending an Immediate Call thereunto which <HI>John Delaval,</HI> and the Teachers Son-in-law used to Interpret, for the understanding of the peo∣ple; but some time after, the Hearers desired the In∣terpreters to forbear, for they were more Edified
<PB N="103" REF="000693_0113_0FA9A151EE804C00"/>
without Interpretation, then with it; though they understood not a word he said; would any have supposed there was such blind implicite Faith out of <HI>Rome,</HI> and that these Spiritual Professors should lay open their Delusions to the World, at so plain a rate.</P>
<P>But what impression the Loss of their Government may have, and what Alterations <HI>it</HI> may make among them, I leave to Further Information. And whoever would have more of this Nature, <HI>even the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> War <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Quakers, <HI>chiefly promoted by the Carnal Weapons of the Tongue,</HI> I recommend them to <HI>Phila∣delphia,</HI> for an enlargement of this Narrative Which is all their own, excepting some Observations, and Animadversions on both Sides.</P>
