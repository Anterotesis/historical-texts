<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<P>BBing often Importuned by several of my nearer Ac∣quaintance, to Publish the following <HI>Relation,</HI> as an ac∣count that might be very useful to the Publick, particularly against <HI>Profane∣ness and Atheism;</HI> and finding my Business at present very urgent upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, I have at last yielded to give the <HI>Papers</HI> and <HI>Notes</HI> which I took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uring the <HI>whole Visitation,</HI> to a Friend of mine, to put 'em in some kind of Method and Order for the Press: And having examined the Piece, how 'tis perfected, with the <HI>Origi∣nal Notes</HI> and <HI>Papers</HI> which I drew my self, I find the Substance and mate∣rial Part very faithfully done.</P>
<P>It cannot be expected by the Rea∣der that the Stile and Words are <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erbatine</HI> the same as delivered, espe∣cially
<PB REF="000681_0003_0FA99EFE6D0423B0"/>
the <HI>two Letters,</HI> which are in the following Tract, but as far as I re∣member, and as my Notes will assist me, (in taking of which I us'd all the Sincerity and Care I could) I dare affirm that there's nothing <HI>mate∣rial left out,</HI> nor is there any inter∣polations which are not genuine, I mean such as do not add to the Sense, but only expatiate, in order to give a plainer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion and Idea of the Matter: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to what that <HI>Misera∣ble Gentleman delivered himself</HI> (who is the Subject of this Relation) both I and the METHODIZER of my Notes have been <HI>superstitiously Critical</HI> to give them as near the Truth, and very Expressions, as we could, be∣lieving the Reader would not be displeas'd to have as Nice and Exact Account of that Part of the Treatise as possibly could be met with. And though this unhappy Gentleman's Name is omitted for <HI>weighty Rea∣sons,</HI> mentioned in the following Pages: Yet if any one doubts the
<PB REF="000681_0004_0FA99EFF2BA93B18"/>
Truth of any Particulars in the <HI>fol∣lowing Relation,</HI> if they repair to Mr. <HI>Dunton</HI> at the <HI>Raven</HI> in the <HI>Poultry,</HI> they will receive full Satisfaction.</P>
<P>There's another thing which the Reader will not be sorry to find, which is; That whereas in <HI>dreadful surprizing Relations,</HI> the <HI>Bookseller, Au∣bour,</HI> or both together, do usually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>og the Matter of Fact with long and tedious Observations, imperti∣nent Reflections and such like <HI>Stuff,</HI> only to make the Volume swell; here he will find no needless or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing Digressions, but <HI>un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Rela∣tion,</HI> barely and <HI>purely</HI> delivered, so that the Reader all the while he reads, will be upon his Subject, and not perplex'd with an Expectation of it.</P>
<P>I've no more to add but this, That I'm willing to hope and believe this <HI>Treatise</HI> may be a means to sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tle some that are <HI>Atheistically Inclin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d;</HI> and perhaps reclaim others, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seeing this, may conclude it their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erest, <HI>Rather to be a thoughts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB REF="000681_0005_0FA99F00385A2D90"/>
of such an History, than to be such an History themselves.</HI> And as for other <HI>Young People,</HI> whose Converse in the World has not yet given them the unhappy Acquaintance of our <HI>Modern Atheists or their Principles;</HI> this may be a Spur to their Diligence, and a Warning to keep them from the dreadful Sin of APOSTATISE∣ING.</P>

<P>I <HI>Am sensible enough that this Age has a deal of</HI> Curiousity <HI>and little</HI> Charity <HI>in it, not but that every one, who by Imprudence, Accident, or other∣wise, gives any just Occasion for others to be Uncharitable, is oblig'd in Justice to remove it, or be content to bear it.</HI></P>

not only into the <HI>same Judg∣ment, but liberty of all Prof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neness, De∣bauchery</HI> and <HI>Injustice,</HI> as far as he could act without the Cognizance of the Law. It won't be amiss to add, That this Gentleman was one of that CLUB which within these last se∣ven Years met together constantly <HI>To lay down such Rules and Methods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that they might be critically wicked in e∣very thing that they could, without the Laws taking hold of them; and therefore the Laws it self was more particularly exa∣mined, What Fallacies might be put upon it; Where and in what Cases it did not provide against unheard of Villanies; What Subterfuges and Evasions there might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in its Exposition; with many more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> horrid Instances, which were all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as very useful Discoveries for the new Candidates of improved Impiety.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed, This Gentleman Sense and Education had furnish'd him with too much Prudence to lay open himself to every Body; he commonly kept a very fair Correspondence with
<PB N="7" REF="000681_0022_0FA99F0FF035B878"/>
his Friends, and in all strange Places <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very sober and reserv'd, Prudence obliging him not to discover all he be∣lieved, to every Body. Thus he liv'd several Years, being as <HI>secretly Wicked</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all Temptations, and the Advanta∣ges of a good Estate, would suffer him: But as <HI>the wicked do not live out half their dayes</HI> by reason of their Intem∣perance and Debaucheries, so this Gen∣tleman hastned his dismal Period by the like Courses, falling desperately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the thirtieth of <HI>November</HI> last, continuing so till the eighth of this instant <HI>December,</HI> as we said above.</P>
<P>As soon as he found himself preci∣pitated by his <HI>ill Courses</HI> into such a dangerous Sickness, he began to be extreamly startled and amazed at the <HI>Apprehensions of Death</HI> (for he believed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> dye) and in spite of all he could do, he could not forbear reflect∣ing upon another Life; and notwith∣standing all his Fortifications to the contrary, he could not confute nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> himself of the Expectation of a
<PB N="8" REF="000681_0023_0FA99F106BD004C8"/>
Future Retribution. Being thus dis∣tracted with his Distemper and Fears, he threw himself upon the Bed, and discoursed with himself after this man∣ner. <HI>Oh! what's the meaning of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tumultuous War in my Breast? what Argument is there n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w to assist me against Matter of Fact? Do I assert, that there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hell at all, &amp; yet I feel one in my Bo∣som? Am I certain, that there's no Heaven when I am so sure that there's a Hell? That there is no After retributions when I feel a present Judgment? Do I affirm m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Soul to be as Mortal as my Body, when this Languishes, and that is as Vigorous as ever? O that one could restore to me my Ancient Guard of Piety and Innocency But it's too late.

at such an Effect, and desired the sick Party to know the Reason of his Discontent, offering my Assistance to remove it, if possible, by Counsel, Prayers, Advice, or any way that lay in my Power.</P>
<P><Q>Alas, Sir, replyed he, you've un∣deceiv'd me, now its too late; I was afraid of nothing so much as the Immortality of my Soul; now you have assured me of that you have ascertained me of a Hell, of a fear∣ful Expectation of Judgment, of a Portion among those that have apostatiz'd from their Religion, of the Lot of Atheists, and Denyers of Christ: You have now sealed my Damnation, by giving me an Ear∣nest of it, I mean an awakened Conscience, that brings my Sins in to my Remembrance, reckoning up the <HI>numerous Catalogue</HI> for which I must go and give an an Account Oh Apostate Wretch, from how great Hopes am I fallen!

had been, then had I never deny'd my Saviour, nor been so black an Heir of Perdition.</Q> I was so sur∣prized at such kind of Expressions that I stood speechless for a considerable Time, for having received the Cha∣racter of a Person that had imbibed some Atheistical Principles; I little expected such a <HI>desperate Change,</HI> but rather that I should have an hard Task of it to make him consider seriously of a future Life: But so soon as I could recollect my self, I said, Sir, I would desire you to take heed how you violate the <HI>Mercy of God,</HI> and think so slightly of the Sufferings of Christ, as if they were not <HI>sufficient for the Redemption of the greatest Sin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rer.</HI> This may be a Delusion of the Devil, who would now hinder you from Repentance and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Christ.

been miserably undecived in another World, whereas knowing it now, you have an Opportunity and some time left to prepare for your welfare. To which he reply'd,</P>
<P><Q>As to the Mercy of God, in Christ, I once knew and tasted what they are, which is now part of my Curse, in that I am more sensible of the loss of them. They are, I will grant you, sufficient to those that have any share in them; but what's that to me, who have denied Christ? Who have daily Crucified him afresh, and put him to open shame? The Devil has no∣thing to do with the Torture I un∣dergo; 'tis no Delusion of his, but the just Judgment of God upon me; and your Convictions are also part of my heavy Judgment, in that you have given me a sensible Horror of my Sin, by proving my Soul im∣mortal, whereas had I gone streight to Hell in my old Damnable Opi∣nions, I had endured but one Hell,
<PB N="15" REF="000681_0030_0FA99F15AB877690"/>
whereas I now feel two: I mean not only an inexpressible Torture which I carry in my Breast, but an Expectation of I know not what a Change. Oh that I were in Hell, that I might feel the worst! And yet I dread to Die, because that worst will never have an end.</Q></P>
<P>All that he spoke, was with <HI>an Air if such horror</HI> and eagerness as can scarce be imagined; indeed it had such Effects upon me, that I knew not what to answer: I tremble at the Judgment of, and I remember I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isht within my self that one or two of the <HI>loosest Atheist in the Age</HI> had been there, verily believing is would have put a stop to their Impiety.</P>
<P>The Gentleman was got to Bed, refusing all Sustenance, and sweating through Violence of his Torments, in the most prodigious manner that ever I saw or heard of. As soon as he was got to Bed, I desired to pray <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y him before I took my Leave, which with much Reluctance he consented

To which he answer∣ed, <HI>As the Damned in Hell, which lift up their Eyes in Torments, and be∣hold afar off the Saints in</HI> Abraham's <HI>Bosome, have their Torments thereby doubly enhansed, first by reflecting in their own Misery, and then taking a pros∣pect of the Beatifick Vision they have left even so, I, who know my self to be hardned, and sealed unto Damnation hearing the Prayers of the Righteous, to which God Almighty's Ears are always open; granting their Requests, this en∣creases my Torments, to think how I am excluded from such a priviledg, and have no other Portion left me, best Blaspheming, Weeping, and Wailing, and Grashing of Teeth, for ever.</HI> Pray <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, said I, Consider, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> deal of difference betwixt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

Millions of Millions of Years will bring me no nearer the ends of my Tortures than one Poor Hour: O Eternity, E∣ternity, who can discover the Abyss of E∣ternity; who can properly Paraphrase upon the Words</HI> FOR EVER AND EVER!</P>
<P>I could not forbear reflecting on that passage <HI>of broiling upon the Fire Hundred Thousand Years to purchase the Favour of God, and be again Reconciled to him:</HI> how unproportionable was this Poor Man's Concern to that o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Common Practice of the World a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art of which will allow no time in Dayes, Weeks, Years, to see the Face and Favour of God?

how fearful, left having a Promise made them of entring into Rest, any of them should fall short through unbelief, and so be frustrated of their share and hopes of that Glory which is to be revealed?</P>
<P>It began to grow late, so I took my leave of him for that Night, promising to renew my Visit, (if it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leased God) the next Day, when I found him still in the same Condi∣tion, as to his Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; but his Body was much weakned by his continual Sweats, caused by the Agonies he lay under. I found Three or Four Di∣vines with him who had been at Prayer, which they told me, had the same uneasie effect upon him, as when I Prayed with him the Night before. One of the Divines desired him to consider the Example of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> who had denied his Master with Oaths and Curses, and yet was received a∣gain into his Favour. To which he reply'd; (officiously against himself, is he had done all the Day before) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="22" REF="000681_0037_0FA99F1AEE068438"/>
<Q>'Tis true, St. <HI>Peter</HI> did deny his Master, as I have done, but what then? his Master had Prayed for him, that his Faith should not fail, and being willing that he should Re∣pent, he look'd him into a Repen∣tance, and assisted him by his Holy Spirit to perfect it; now if Christ would assist me to Repent, I should do so too, but he hath justly with∣drawn his Intercessions from me: <HI>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> often Crucified him a fresh, and put him to open shame so often grieved that Holy Spirit,</HI> that God has taken it away from me, and in the room thereof has left me the Spirit of Im∣penitence and Reprobation and gi∣ven me a certain Earnest of a <HI>fearful Inheritance</HI> in another Life.</Q></P>
<P>He spake little more that Day, for a deal of Company pressing in, it be∣come troublesome to him, and towards Night Orders were taken for the a∣voiding such an Inconvenience. There were four more Divines in the Room besides, at six a Christ; we all look'd
<PB N="23" REF="000681_0038_0FA99F1BAF0BEE18"/>
upon one another, not knowing what course to take, no Text being offered in his favour, but what he readily turned another way; whilst we were thus Musing, he Cryed out in a vehe∣ment affecting Passion, <Q>How long, Oh Lord! shall thy Wrath burn for ever against me, shall thy Eternal Justice for ever exact upon a Poor despicable Worm?

<P>U<HI>Nderstanding you are fallen dan∣gorously ill, and that it had a Melancholy Effect upon you, I could not, ('considering our stricter Friendship) but endeavour at least the removal of those Evils your Mind may lie under, which perhaps is an Office no less grateful, than making your Body Sound and Vigorous. Sickness and Death are the Common Lot of Mankind, and to Repine and Grieve at the bearing of this Lot, is to Combat the Laws of Nature, and Fight against Impossibilities; what Wise Man Repines at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Summer, or Cold in Win∣ter,

But per∣haps your Melancholy suggests unto you, that 'tis a dismal thing to Launch out in∣to an unknown Abyss, to be you know not where, nor what. I Answer, I dream sometimes of frightful things, and the Idea's that I have of them, impress as afflicting Resentments upon my Spirits, as if they were real, but when I awake all vanishes. Thus, if we will examine Death, and its supposed Consequences, by the Prejudices of a Melancholy and Distractful Brain, we may be Miserable, proportionable to the heighth of our Folly; but if by our Reason we take a View of these Formidable Mon∣sters, they grow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame and familiar to us.

I came cut of a State of Nothingness, and shall return into the same again; as that Flame of an extinguished Candle dissolved and loseth it self in the Circumambient At even so the Toper of Life vanishes into pure AEther, and is no more, when the Laws of the Union of Soul and Body are violated and broken, Death it self is no∣thing; and after Death there's nothing and why should I be afraid of nothing Take Courage, Man, and either Die li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your self, Master of your Fate and Happi∣ness, so long as it is to be kept; or Re∣cover, and Live Worthy the Character of a Person that knows how either to Live <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Die So wishes,</HI></P>

I had no sooner read this Letter through, but he surpriz'd us all with repeating dismal Groans, as if his Soul had been strugling under the last Throws of Separation: we thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not convenient to press for the Reason of it, considering that Human Nature feels, or at least supposes in Ease by complaining of the Evil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t suffers, and it happened according to our Expectations, for at length he broke out into these afflicting imprecations: <Q>Cursed be the Day wherein I commenced such a fa∣tal Friendship: Oh unhappy Time, when first I imbib'd these Athe∣istical Principles! When first I ex∣changed the Christian Faith for the Creed of <HI>Spinoza</HI> and the <HI>Leviathan!</HI> When first I relinquish'd all <HI>reveal'd Religion</HI> for the <HI>natural one,</HI> and the <HI>last</HI> for <HI>none at all.</HI></Q> When casting is Eyes upon me, he said, <Q>I am not able to write an Answer to that Letter, though I earnestly desire there should be one, nor is it worth

my while to get an <HI>Emanuensis</HI> for that purpose, for I suppose I shall have no occasion to write any more I'm also sensible that you might be better able to answer such a Letter than I, and yet my present Cir∣cumstances are such (I being not only a Party, but the dismal subjects a Matter my self) that what come from me may make a deeper im∣pression upon the Spirit of my Friend, than what comes from strange Hand; therefore you will oblige me, if you will only lend me your Hand and let me dictate,</Q> which I freely offering, he ordered a Chair to be set on the other Side of the Bed, thinking it convenient to be as secret and free from Noise and Diversion as possibly he could: And then he proceeded.</P>

You say well, Its a grate∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uller Office to endeavour to remove the Evils of the Mind than of the Body What thou urge of the common Lot of Mankind, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Death and Sickness: I could wish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were my Case, but mine alas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a discovery that I pay dearly for, <ABBR>Viz.</ABBR> That Despare and Hell is the common let of Atheists. Now your Arguments can∣not reach my Case, unless you first prove that Atheism is as inevitable as Death and Sickness, and that therefore the effects of it are to be born patiently, un∣less a Man will combat Necessity and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against the Laws of Fate. Your way of arguing in such as I have us'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> myself formerly; and I cannot but win∣der now how I could think it conclu∣sive: Perhaps I never indeed thought of that, but was pleased with it, because wish'd it to be true, and because I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it my Interest that it should be so. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you please I'll just make a Reflection two upon what you have writ, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en give you my Sentiments of the

whole matter. You say, That if we examine Death and its supposed Conse∣quences by our Reason, those formidable Monsters grow tame and familiar: If by our Reason you mean either the peculiar Creed of Atheists, or the common Rea∣son of Human Nature; I am sure they Monsters will be less tame and familiar the more you think of them, for since no Reason discovers what an unexperienc'd death is, or the unknown change cones∣quent thereupon, how can we judge of things that we know not? Reason <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> long as you please upon things that you are ignorant of, and at last you wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be as far from Truth and Satisfacti∣on, if not farther, than when you first began; like him that demanded a con∣siderable Time to tell what God was and when that was expired he demanded yet a greater; and being ask'd why he did so, he replyed,</HI> the more he thought the less he knew of him. <HI>It might have been retorted on him, though the same History gives no account of it Why then did he petition for means

Your Argument is extream weak about a pre-existent and future State;</HI> <ABBR>Viz.</ABBR> <HI>I retain no impression of Happiness or Mi∣sery that I had in a pre-existent State, therefore shall retain none in a future State. How that's a consequence in any Rules of Logick I see not. Next, you would have me believe upon your bare Word, That Death is nothing, and that after Death there's nothing. Pray how do you know either, having not yet tryed? there are a great many that say the contrary. I have only concerned my self as to the rationality of your Letter, that I might induce you to be∣lieve I am not Melancholy, distracted, or prejudic'd in my Reason, and I would desire you to believe it, That what I am going to say may not have the less credit, because it comes from one under my Circumstances; Its Truth, and whether you will believe me or no, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou will at last find it to be so.</HI></P>

the Body; for a Time we have offici∣ously deluded and cheated one another of our Religion and Happiness, and God, who will not always be despised by his Crea∣tures without taking notice of it, has chosen me out as an Example to you all, and as a Warning to the lazy indifferent Christian: But who, alas, can write their own Tragedy without Tears, or copy out the Seal of their Damnation, without the ex∣tremity of Horror? That there's a God I know, because I continually feel the ef∣fects of his Wrath: That there's a Hell, I am as certain, have received the earn∣est of my Inheritance there, in my Breast, where my Tortures are infinitely short of any Expression: That there's a natural Conscience, which is not the effect of a prejudiced Education, I now feel with Horror and Amazement, being continually upbraided by it with the Registry of my Impieties, and a bringing of all my Sins fresh into my remembrance; why God has markt me out for an example of his Wrath and Vengeance rather than you, or any of our Acquaintance, I presume is, because I

am the greatest Apostate, having been more religiously educated than any of you, and therefore done greater despite unto the Spi∣rit of Grace, and been the greatest Scandal to Religion. Oh what a presumptuous, e∣gregious piece of Folly is it for Dust &amp; Ashes to contend with their Creator, to question his Justice, his Power, nay his very Being, when at the same Time with∣out this infinite wise God, every such vile Wretch would immediately fall into its Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s again, being not able to exist one moment without him? What a vile ingratitude is it scurrilously to reflect upon the Christian Religion, when the Author of it dyed to reconcile such Reflectors to himself? And if after all that he has done and suffered to make such Fools hap∣py, they will still deny him and despise the Benefits of his Redemption, what can be expected but that this Intercessor become an angry Judge and consign his Enemies over to the Reward of their Demerits? Don't mistake your self, its not a light Matter to question and contend with the God of Nature, to abuse Religion and

deny the Author of it, and what is yet the worst of all, to Apostatize and leave the way of Righteousness, as I have done; behold, God hath met with me for it, af∣ter a long Forbearance of several Years in inveterate Impiety and Profaneness: Let me intreat you, by my Example, to leave off your Sins by Repentance; who knoweth but God may yet receive you, and by me preach such a Lecture as may stop you in your Course of Wickedness?
