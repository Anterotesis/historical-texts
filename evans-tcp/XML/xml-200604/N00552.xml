<L>No Man's more like Proud <HI>Haman</HI> than he is:</L>

<L>Give heed to what here follows, and then you</L>

<L><HI>Haman,</HI> no doubt, was a brisk Jolly Blade,</L>

<L>This Jovial Fellow doth not hate that Trade,</L>
<L>But lives in splendor to the very hight.</L>

<LG N="17">

<L><HI>Haman</HI> in Worldly Power took great pleasure.</L>

<L><HI>Haman</HI> when at his Hight, began to Fall,</L>
<L>His Loftiness and Pride soon came to nought:</L>
<L>This Man knows not how soon decline he shall,</L>
<L>And be down equal to his Neighbours brought.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="19">

<L><HI>Haman</HI> was after that by Justice sought,</L>

<L><HI>Haman's</HI> Pride ended in his Overthrow,</L>

<L>Let this then leave it, and learn to be low,</L>
<L>Lest when too late, he Rue it to his Cost.</L>
</LG>

<L>So now my Promise being at an end,</L>
<L>I have almost fullfill'd what I intend;</L>
<L>For by what's done, most evident it is,</L>
<L><HI>Haman</HI> and he hath great Resemblances,</L>
<L>And that he's no whit like poor <HI>Mordecai,</HI></L>
<L>I judge most men, who read these Lines, will say,</L>
<L>I mean such who know this Character's True,</L>
<L>They'l also say he has not half his due;</L>
<L>Which is most certain, for I've things in store</L>
<L>Will equal him with many Tyrants more;</L>
<L>But there are Proofs enough, and so apparent,</L>
<L>That Twenty more will give no better Warrant;</L>
<L>For he that's guilty of what here is writ,</L>
<L>What horrid Crimes is't he will not commit?</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="000680_0007_0FA99EFB6FBD4870"/>
But yet I hope by this he'll warning take,</L>
<L>How he such like Comparisons doth make</L>
<L>For time to come, seeing hereby he'll find</L>
<L>That his false words will not the People blind,</L>
<L>Nor make them think, whatever he may say,</L>
<L>That <HI>Haman's</HI> Spirit dwells in <HI>Mordecai.</HI></L>
