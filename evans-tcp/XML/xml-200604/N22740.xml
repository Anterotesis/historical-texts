<P>I am informed that WINTERBOTHAM's
"Historical, Geographical, Commercial and Philosophical View of the United States of America," first published in England has been reprinted in this country.</P>
<P>It is apparent to every intelligent reader, and in the English Edition it is acknowledg∣ed, that the author "has availed himself of the labours and abilities" of others; and that "he has often no other merit than what arises from selection and a few connecting sentences."</P>
<P>Part of my <HI>literary property</HI> has been in this manner invaded; and I am ad∣vised that the Laws of the United States will give me a sufficient Remedy, against any Person who shall reprint, import, publish, sell or expose to sale any part of the above work, which may comprehend any considerable portion of my publications; the copy rights of which are secured to me by a compliance with the law.</P>
<P>As it is probable that some copies of the above work may be transmitted to you for sale, I have thought it friendly and proper to apprize you of my intention, to apply the provisions of the law upon this subject to my relief, if it should become necessary.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, <SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>your humble servant, JEREMY BELKNAP.</SIGNED>
