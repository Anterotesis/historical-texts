<HEAD>AN <HI>ELEGY,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>COME to my soul, O shade of Hosmer, come,</L>
<L>Tho' doubting senates ask thy aid in vain;</L>
<L>Attend the drooping virtues round thy tomb,</L>
<L>And hear a while the orphan'd Muse complain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Muse which thy indulgence bade aspire,</L>
<L>And dare pursue thy distant steps to fame;</L>
<L>At thy command she first assum'd the lyre,</L>
<L>And hop'd a future laurel from thy name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How did thy smiles awake her infant song!</L>
<L>How did thy virtues animate the lay!</L>
<L>Still shall thy fate the dying strain prolong,</L>
<L>And bear her voice with thy lost form away.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="6" REF="016706_0004_0F9D78C9E1AB1460"/>
<L>Come to my soul thou venerable Sage,</L>
<L>In all the sheeted majesty of night,</L>
<L>Snatch the bold quill, control the noble rage,</L>
<L>And seize the raptur'd fancy in her slight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come in the form that shadowy spirits dress,</L>
<L>When death's dim vail hath shrouded all their pride,</L>
<L>While you tall cloud but emulates thy face,</L>
<L>Where the lone moonbeam trembles thro' its side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come on the gale that listening midnight heaves,</L>
<L>When glare ey'd phantoms, bending with a bier,</L>
<L>Stalk thro' the mist, ascend the sounding graves,</L>
<L>And wake wild wonders in the startled ear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In this dread seene no more the wonted fires</L>
<L>Kindle my breast or ope a wish within,</L>
<L>The soul, distracted from herself retires,</L>
<L>And sighs to mingle and to soar with thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And where, thou blest immortal art thou flown▪</L>
<L>Can these deep shades detain thy willing ear?</L>
<L>Canst thou from loaded breezes hear a groan?</L>
<L>Or stain thy spotless mantle with a tear?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Can ought on earth thy flight hath left behind,</L>
<L>Borne in the music of a once lov'd strain,</L>
<L>Approach th' unbodied mansion of the mind▪</L>
<L>Or bend one pitying look to earth again?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="016706_0005_0F9D78CB63C0EC70"/>
<L>Can thence no thought to that fair seat descend?</L>
<L>The seat once joyous in thy joys below,</L>
<L>Where robes of sable sadness now depend,</L>
<L>And all the still solemnities of woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Can the dear partner of thy tender years,</L>
<L>Sad as the misty fading face of even,</L>
<L>With all the wasted treasure of her tears,</L>
<L>Avert no smile nor bribe a care from heaven?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While that young throng, that dear deserted train,</L>
<L>Where thy lov'd image soften'd sweetness wears,</L>
<L>Swell with new tenderness each following pain,</L>
<L>And add unnumber'd, undivided cares.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Around the fair one see their beauties bloom,</L>
<L>(Or wilt thou not the moving fair one heed?)</L>
<L>How their keen anguish points the distant tomb,</L>
<L>Where all their joys and every hope is fled!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So lonely Cynthia, on her evening throne,</L>
<L>And all her young-ey'd planetary train,</L>
<L>In languid lustre seek their sire the sun,</L>
<L>Down the still chambers of the western main.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet that broad splendor from his nightly race,</L>
<L>With rising radiance shall the day restore;</L>
<L>Another spring renews fair nature's face,</L>
<L>And years and ages die to waken more.</L>

<L>But thou alas! no more on earth wilt tread,</L>
<L>Nor one short hour thy blest employments leave,</L>
<L>Tho' the sad knell, that hail'd thee to the dead,</L>
<L>Had doom'd thy helpless country to her grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy country, whose still supplicating moan,</L>

</LG>
<LG>

<L>There while the dread sublimity of soul</L>

<L>Wilt thou remark the bluely-bending shore?</L>

<L>Where opening streams their lengthiest currents pour,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wilt thou recognize that confus'd uproar?</L>
<L>Towns curl'd in smoaky columns mounting high,</L>
<L>Mix'd with the clarion's desolating roar;</L>
<L>Rending and purpling all the nether sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Amid the tumult, wilt thou see afar</L>
<L>Our laurel'd heroes striving for the day?</L>
<L>While clouds, unfolding, ope the wings of war,</L>
<L>Where the grim legions sweep the foes away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And while their deeds thy blest approvance claim,</L>
<L>While crouds of rival chiefs thy guidance share,</L>
<L>Behold that first, that finish'd heir of fame,</L>
<L>And be the best of heroes still thy care.</L>

<LG>
<L>That hero whose illuminating sword</L>
<L>Lights death and victory through the darken'd field,</L>
<L>Bids realms and ages waken at his word,</L>
<L>Their sire, their soul, their savior and their shield.</L>
