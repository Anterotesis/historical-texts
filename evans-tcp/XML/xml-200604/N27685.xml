</FIGURE> ORATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SCARCELY had six revolving months assuaged our sorrows for the loss of our re∣spected SUMNER, when, obedient to the unani∣mous desire of those, whom your suffrages have invited to offices of trust and responsibility, with public unaffected decorum, we closed the mem∣orable year which terminated the labors, anxie∣ties and cares, of our beloved WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>WITH recent deep-felt sensibility, and the most respectful tokens of filial reverence, we relin∣quished our secular concerns, to lament his sudden, eventful death; summoned by the ac∣customed knell, the funereal dirge, and agon∣izing peals from yonder celebrated eminence,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">WHERE the battle of <HI>June</HI> 17, 1775, was fought, and on which is a <HI>Monument,</HI> in memory of Gen. WARREN and his ASSOCIATES.</NOTE>
<PB N="6" REF="036902_0005_100B305CDF709198"/>
with deliberate, silent footsteps we trod these sacred courts. The shrouded walls, the expres∣sive harmony, the dejected aspect of a crouded auditory, and the copious tears of female inno∣cence were well adapted to the solemn scene.</P>
<P>HERE with mingled emotions of despondency, hope and resignation, we bowed in humble ador∣ation to that ALL WISE, UNSEARCHABLE BEING</P>
<L>"Who views with equal eye as GOD of all,</L>
<L>"The Hero perish, or the Sparrow fall;"</L>
<P>here from a plaintive recital of the distinguished talents and splendid achievements of an ancient <HI>Patriarch,</HI> we were led to contemplate the meekness, prudence, bravery, and zeal, of the VICTORIOUS LEADER in our American Israel, whose life and death were instructive lessons of pious patriotism; whose PARENTAL LEGACY,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SEE ADDRESS to the People of the United States, <HI>Sept.</HI> 17, 1796, by GEORGE WASHINGTON.</NOTE> bequeathed with prophetic reference to future generations, is an invaluable inheritance to his bereaved country. May a frequent serious recol∣lection of these affecting transactions, convince us, that <HI>a man diligent in business shall stand before kings, and will be commended, according to his wisdom.</HI></P>
<P>BUT why are we now assembled? did the roar of cannon disturb our slumbers to welcome the rising sun? are freedom's ensigns waving in
<PB N="7" REF="036902_0006_100B305F2F60DC48"/>
the air to excite our joy? are our youthful friends arrayed in the soldier's garb, or ani∣mated by the martial trumpet, to mirth and in∣nocent festivity? or are our aged citizens ex∣changing their mutual congratulations on the birth day of their common friend and bene∣factor? These once pleasing realities now pass before us "like the baseless fabric of a vision," while conformably to the official call, of that EMINENT PATRIOT and STATESMAN, our VENE∣RABLE ADAMS, on whom we trust the <HI>mantle</HI> has descended, we have entered this hallowed temple, "with one heart and one voice" to join united America, in our last public tribute of respect to his pre-eminent merit; and there is no situation in which I have ever appeared, so deeply impressed with the necessity of your well known candor, as on this interesting occasion.</P>
<P>THE various, wonderful pursuits of GEN∣ERAL <HI>WASHINGTON,</HI> have been so often, strik∣ingly delineated, with all the flowers of rhetoric, and charms of eloquence, and you are so am∣ply furnished with an accurate, judicious his∣tory of his life,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SEE Sermon, by Rev. JED. MORSE, D. D. Dec. 31, 1799.</NOTE> that no encomium in my power to bestow, can add one ray to the lustre of his mighty deeds; but if for a moment, my honor∣ed fathers and beloved brethren, with our first emotions of grief, subdued by deliberate reflec∣tion,
<PB N="8" REF="036902_0007_100B3061946392F0"/>
we extend our fancy to the "elevated lawn" on Potowmac's bank, and collect around the dreary sepulchre, to remind us that he was but mortal, we may profit by his experience, and endeavour, at a humble distance, to imitate his virtues.</P>
<P>SELDOM is the morning of life devoted to the engagements of our riper years; with pleasing expectation we enter the alluring threshold, re∣gardless of the numerous intricate windings, which conduct us through the extensive edifice, unmindful of an inevitable, uncertain exit; but different was the case before us; with a firm athletic constitution, a capacious, vigorous mind, aided by the advantages of a special in∣structor, he was taught the useful arts and sci∣ences, for which, he was ever after, a distin∣guished advocate; and acquiring unusual habits of industry, method and perseverance, had scarcely arrived at manhood, when designated by the government of his native province, for the execution of hazardous, important enter∣prizes, where he discovered that vigilance, mod∣eration and punctuality, which have since ren∣dered him the most conspicuous character of the age, and excited the admiration of the world.</P>
<P>MANKIND in general, possessing a laudable emulation to display their natural and acquired endowments, are frequently employed, accord∣ing
<PB N="9" REF="036902_0008_100B3064D3F57F40"/>
to their respective talents, as well on the <HI>high places of the field,</HI> as in deliberative assemblies, or by the midnight taper, to mitigate the con∣dition of life, and enlarge the boundaries of pub∣lic happiness; but when we review the momen∣tous changes of states and empires, which at dif∣ferent times have convulsed society, or recite the boasted achievements of heroes and conquerors, can we find an instance of superior magnanim∣ity? Accustomed from early life to the toils of war; deeply interested for the welfare of his bleeding country, with modest diffidence he accepted the command of her infant armies; amid the most incredible difficulties and dangers, he led them triumphant, through the varied for∣tunes of an eventful revolutionary period, to Peace and Independence; when with republican dignity, unequalled even by the celebrated Ro∣man farmer, he relinquished the sword for the pruning hook, and with genuine effusions of a patriotic spirit to his military brethren,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SEE his Farewell Address to the Armies of the United States, Nov. 2, 1783.</NOTE> surren∣dered, to the VIRTUOUS ASSEMBLY, by which they were so worthily bestowed, his extensive powers to participate <HI>under his own vine and fig tree,</HI> the blessings of that freedom he had so largely contributed to establish.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="036902_0009_100B306720F8CBC0"/>A COMBINATION of those opposite qualities which distinguish the statesman from the warrior, are seldom discoverable in the same person. The deliberate mind of the sage civilian is rarely ani∣mated with martial ardor, while the successful soldier, too often looses the finer feelings of the citizen; but here the magistrate, legislator, and counsellor, are no less conspicuous than the vet∣eran leader. In municipal offices, he was active, impartial, decisive; as a delegate to the first con∣tinental Congress, his services were deservedly estimated; in the Chair of that AUGUST ASSEM∣BLY, which formed the Federal Constitution, his weight of character, accommodating talents, and unexampled influence, supported the tottering fabric; as PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES, a novel, untried situation, with every thing at hazard, his integrity, vigilance, inflexibility and perseverance, were so well adapted to our na∣tional exigencies, that nothing but his ready ac∣ceptance of a subordinate trust<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SEE his letter to President ADAMS, July 13, 1798.</NOTE> from the hand of his successor could increase his own celebrity, or the affections of his grateful countrymen.</P>
<P>PUBLIC employments, with elevated rank, are often rendered subservient to personal considera∣tions; and political tranquillity is frequently in∣terrupted by ambition or avarice; but by him,
<PB N="11" REF="036902_0010_100B3068A51A2370"/>
the humble avocations of the husbandman, sweet∣ened by the allurements of domestic retirement, were courted with eager solicitude; and his con∣stant refusal of pecuniary reward, is the best evi∣dence of sincere, disinterested services.</P>
<P>WE need not recur to the records of antiquity to establish a belief, that patriotism or popular acquirements are not invariably connected with religion and morality; for it is a humiliating fact, that vice, with gigantic strides, often boldly traverses the splendid palace, while those milder virtues, which adorn humanity, are found in the peasant's cottage. Happy is that nation, where "examples move as precepts teach," great in∣deed is the character, always influenced by that unerring guide, which looks beyond this chequer∣ed life for approbation and reward; such is COLUMBIA'S BOAST, such was our DEPARTED FRIEND. From education, and habit, he was at∣tached to the doctrines and ceremonies of the epis∣copal church, which did not, however, prevent a liberal regard to every other denomination.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SEE his Answers to the Addresses of the Clergy, on va∣rious occasions.</NOTE> He considered public worship as an indispensa∣ble duty, and was a strict observer of the christian sabbath, whilst his religion, equally free from bigotry or ostentation, was the immoveable basis of his morality and beneficence.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="036902_0011_100B306A5AC0E850"/>HOW he was esteemed in the endearing char∣acter of a husband, the records of our National Legislature can amply testify. On the delicate subject of removing his body to the city of Washington, founded by his exertions for the permanent seat of government; which future historians, will compare with the majestic ele∣gance of Roman or Grecian splendor, and generations, yet unnumbered, will venerate, as well for the <HI>PRECIOUS DEPOSITE</HI> as its own mag∣nificence; the late communication from the highly honored, <HI>WIDOWED PARTNER,</HI> of his youth, to the Chief Magistrate of the Union,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SEE President ADAMS's Message to Congress, Jan. 8, 1800.</NOTE> discovering the keenest, most refined, and affec∣tionate sensibility, evincive of prompt submis∣sion to the public will, is a striking specimen of the influence of a "great example."</P>
<P>IT was decreed by Unerring Wisdom, that his paternal regards should not be limited to a single household, but with the tender solicitude of a cautious attentive parent, his cares and benedic∣tions were imparted to the great family of man; while the solemnities of this day recognise him, as the <HI>FATHER</HI> and <HI>PROTECTOR</HI> of a rising empire, whose susceptible bosom is the burying spot of his virtues; whose defensive hills, and fruit∣ful vallies, are lasting monuments of his exten∣sive fame.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="036902_0012_100B306CDF568988"/>EQUALLY distinguished in the discharge of subordinate duties, as a relative and friend, he was faithful, candid, sincere; as a master just, considerate, provident; as a companion cour∣teous, affable, instructive; as a neighbour hos∣pitable, benevolent, charitable; and as a mem∣ber of the Masonic Fraternity, his active and uniform support<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SEE Hon. TIMOTHY BIGELOW's Eulogy, Feb. 11, 1800.</NOTE> have united philanthropy with patriotism, literature, arts, agriculture, com∣merce, and manufactures, in public demonstra∣tion of unfeigned veneration for his revered memory.</P>
<P>THUS my respected friends, with pure inten∣tions, but conscious inability, I have attempted a concise, imperfect sketch of the career of this <HI>ILLUSTRIOUS MAN,</HI> who was born in the Parish which bears his name, in the county of West∣moreland in Virginia, on the eleventh of Febru∣ary, by the calendar of seventeen hundred thirty-two, and specially directed, for more than <HI>forty years,</HI> by the singer of <HI>SUPREME INTELLI∣GENCE,</HI> as were the Israelites of old, by the <HI>pillar</HI> and the <HI>cloud,</HI> died at his beloved <HI>MOUNT VERNON,</HI> famous as ancient <HI>Pisgah,</HI> on the fourteenth of December, seventeen hundred ninety-nine.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="036902_0013_100B3071333150F0"/>NOT like the eminent law giver with whom he has been justly compared, were his inanimate remains, secreted from his surviving kindred, and afflicted countrymen, to prevent excessive sorrow, or idolatrous reverence; but under the cheering influence of that <HI>adorable</HI> dispensation, obscured in former ages by the veil of types and metaphors, he was intered in the family vault on his own estate, with every testimonial of esteem which local circumstances would allow; and the numerous exhibitions of a funeral cere∣mony, in token of humble acquiescence in the immutable decrees of a <HI>Righteous</HI> Ruler, are with∣out a precedent in the annals of America.</P>
<P>BUT did his wonted greatness forsake him at that awful moment, when all his former deeds were brought to the test of unerring scrutiny? Not with the feeble principles of modern philos∣ophy, did he shrink from the unbounded prospect opening to his view, and solicit a reprieve, but having maturely adjusted his extensive temporal concerns, in a manner no less honorable to his humanity,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SEE the provision in his WILL for the emancipation of his slaves.</NOTE> than his judgment, with patient submission, he bore the anguish of a rapid, torturing disease, and with the same composure which had dignified his ordinary pursuits, he
<PB N="15" REF="036902_0014_100B3073C0C14878" MS="y"/>
welcomed the faithful herald, to conduct him to <HI>everlasting</HI> bliss.</P>
<L>"LET this reflection dry a nation's tears,</L>
<L>"He died as ripe in glory as in years.</L>
<L>"And would you prove the HERO's memory dear,</L>
<L>"Learn HIS instructive precepts to revere;</L>
<L>"Let not contention e'er your judgment blind,</L>
<L>"Preserve with care an independent mind,</L>
<L>"Support, OBEY the LAWS, believe me friends,</L>
<L>"Your peace on unanimity depends,</L>
<L>"By faction ALL to chaos would be hurld,</L>
<L>"Be but UNITED, and DEFY the WORLD."</L>
