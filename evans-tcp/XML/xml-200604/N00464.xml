<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>YOu may see by the enclosed that the</HI> Jacobite Cate∣chism <HI>hath lost nothing by the</HI> Obstruction <HI>it met with; the Author had no design to Burlesque the</HI> Church Catechism, <HI>nor to reflect upon the</HI> Creed, Lords Prayer, or Sacraments, for those are all Sacred Things, <HI>but he was willing it should look something like</HI> a Catechism: <HI>He hath now omitted their</HI> Creed and their Prayer, <HI>till he better understands what they believe and when they Pray. Their Sacraments also are left out, because some of them have paid dear for</HI> drinking Healths <HI>to K.</HI> James <HI>this last Assizes.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE JACOBITES CATECHISM.</HEAD>
<P>Quest. <HI>WHat is your Name?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> JACOBITE.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Who gave you that Name?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. The WILLIAMITES of this Nation in the Day when I declared my self a favourer of Popery, and promoter of Arbitrary Government.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Did they promise any thing farther for you to make you keep up your Name?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Pray tell me what it was?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> They did promise three Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. That as my Forefathers had done, so I should Follow their Steps: in sideing with <HI>French</HI> Dragoons, and <HI>Iresh</HI> Cut-throats, against my native Country.</P>
<P N="2">2. That I should renounce the <HI>English</HI> Laws and Liberties of the Subject?</P>
<P N="3">3. That I should come very short of that love I ought to bear to the <HI>Reformed Religion,</HI> and my <HI>Protestant Bre∣thren.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Dost thou think thou art any wayes obliged to act, what they promised in thy Name?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Yes verily, and by <HI>Romes</HI> help so I will, and I heartily thank <HI>our Earthly Father Lewis le Grand,</HI> that
<PB N="2" REF="000587_0004_0FA95B5E752C59B8"/>
he has taken us into his protection, and I question not but he will be as kind to us as he has been to the <HI>Hu∣gonots</HI> of his own Country.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>But your Principles of Government both in Church &amp; State, are not the same which he has taught them there?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Indeed we are not yet so absolutely <HI>refined</HI> in neither as 'tis there, but we have endeavoured to instil them into the People of our <HI>Nation</HI> for above these 30 <HI>Years?</HI></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What Principles have you taught them concerning the State?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> We have taught them, that as there is but one <HI>God in Heaven,</HI> so there ought to be but one Government on Earth, and thats <HI>Monarchical both in Church and State,</HI> for as 'tis said, <HI>by me Kings Reign,</HI> so in the Church Bishops ought to govern, and those two are so twisted one in the other, that as 'tis our Maxime, <HI>No Bishop, no King,</HI> so they who are Enemies to <HI>Monarchy</HI> and <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> are Enemies to all Government both in Church and State; for as there can be no State with∣out <HI>Kings,</HI> so there can be <HI>no Church without Bishops,</HI> and therefore I blame the <HI>New Williamite Church of England,</HI> for composing a Form of Prayer for all the Reformed Churches, seeing we ne're own'd them for true Churches, tho we own the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> for a true Church.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What do these Principles lead you to follow?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> They lead us to follow and acknowledge Three Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. That our gracious Monarch K. <HI>James</HI> is our only King <HI>de Jure.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That his suppos'd Son the <HI>Welsh Prince</HI> will in due time redeem us and all of our Loyal Principles from
<PB N="3" REF="000587_0005_0FA95B5F4F77EA48"/>
our present Bondage to a Prince of the Reformed Re∣ligion.</P>
<P N="3">3. That none are truly Loyal who are not of our <HI>Clubbs</HI> and <HI>Societies.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Is there no Laws or Rule that you are to obey for your better direction, in practizing what you shall learn?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Yes, there are two particular Orders which we should obey.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Which be they?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. Render to <HI>Caesar</HI> the things which are <HI>Caesars.</HI> And 2. unto God the things that are Gods.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What do they chiefly teach you?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Two Things.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Which be they?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. We are taught what we are to render to our King. And 2. What we owe towards God.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What is it you render to your King?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We are to own him for a <HI>Caesar,</HI> and that he may govern <HI>despotically,</HI> and is not tyed up to the Laws of the Land to which he has <HI>sworn,</HI> but that he may <HI>impose Taxes,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>without consent of Parliaments,</HI> and the People are bound in Conscience on pain of <HI>Eternal Damnation</HI> to obey; for we are not to enquire our <HI>Duty to our King</HI> out of the known Laws of the Land, but from the Holy Scriptures, as they are expounded by those Ancient Fathers of the Church, <HI>Sibthorp</HI> and <HI>Marwaring,</HI> &amp;c. that gape after Court Perferment, who would fain Enslave the Subject to advance them∣selves.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What have you baen taught that you owe to God?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> To render to God the things that are Gods, as are the <HI>Ceremonies of our Church,</HI> which are in a man∣ner
<PB N="4" REF="000587_0006_0FA95B60C2918820"/>
as holy as the <HI>Censors</HI> of Old, and we are not to part with the least of them to gratifie our weak Brethren, who are so Sacrilegious as to endeavour to robb the Church of the <HI>White Robe, the Wife of the Wedding Ring, the Infant of the Invisible Badge of Christanity,</HI> which he wears in his Fore-head, and the devout Christian of his genuflexion at the high Altar.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>My</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>od Child, <HI>know that thou art not able to do all this of thy self without calling in</HI> Forreign Aid and Assistance; <HI>Therefore let me here what Endeavours thou will use to thy Power for effecting it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I will endeavour it three ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. I will (as we have from the beginning of the Re∣formation) labour to foment the Differences amongst all Protestants whatsoever, that I may once more <HI>blow those Coals to a flame,</HI> as may consume them and their Church to Ashes, so as we may once again come to practice those things which I have now learned.</P>
<P N="2">2. I will endeavour to keep the wounds of the Church open and bleeding, and excite the most <HI>Furious of both Parties,</HI> and villifie moderate Men, and Men of <HI>healing Spirits,</HI> to make them be look'd on as <HI>Lukewarm Laodi∣ceans,</HI> and only fit to be spewed out of the mouths of both Parties, whilst we cry aha! so we would have it.</P>
<P N="3">3. I will as often as I can possible, keep up a correspondence with <HI>Papists</HI> and the <HI>French Court,</HI> as we have hither to done, by inviting the <HI>French last year,</HI> and by our continual advertising them of the <HI>State of the Kingdom,</HI> and what <HI>Ships</HI> are going out and coming in, that the Immortal <HI>Lewis</HI> may be in the better capacity to help us for at present; our <HI>Cause</HI> is so sunk, and low that within these six months, I have seen the melting
<PB N="5" REF="000587_0007_0FA95B614F68C748"/>
down of five of our <HI>Golden Candlestecks,</HI> for the sup∣port of the <HI>Cause.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Is there no other Rule that you are to practice?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Yes, but it has been exploded these thirty years.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What is it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self, or do as thou wouldst be done unto.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Have you any distinguishing Mark whereby you may know who are of the same Profession with you?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Yes Two, as absolutely necessary to distinguish the Members of our Society.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What are they?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I. Health to our old Master King <HI>James:</HI> And 2dly. Another to our young Master the <HI>Welch</HI> Prince, who has all our good <HI>wishes.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Why do you so often drink Healths to K.</HI> James?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Because as <HI>Mabomet</HI> said, there is a Devil in every Berry of the Grape, and when the Devil is got in, we are beholding to them that be a good Fine, will conjure him out again.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What mean you by the word</HI> Health?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I mean an outward Appearance of our in∣ward and hearty Affection to King <HI>James,</HI> the <HI>Welch Prince,</HI> and the Popish Interest.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What is required of them who enter into these Societies?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> To examine themselves what Devil prompted them to invite in the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> contrary to their Doctrine of <HI>Non-Resistance</HI> and <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> and whether they do heartily and unseignedly repent of that thing, and stedfastly purpose to continue their
<PB N="6" REF="000587_0008_0FA95B62119D56A0"/>
Loyalty to King <HI>James</HI> for the time to come, and if God should restore their old Master again, whether they would not soon grow weary of him, and <HI>Father Peters,</HI> and whether they are in Chariry with all men, especially with the <HI>Prince of Orange,</HI> who came in at their Invitation, but would not be prevailed on to go out again at their intreaty, being loth to leave them in a worse condition than he found them.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>But are you not guilty of great Ingratitude to the Prince of</HI> Orange, <HI>that ventured all he had to save you from Ruine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> He did'nt save us only, but Protestant Dis∣senters as well as we, and is kinder to them than we do desire.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>But must your Eye be Evil, because his is good?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The truth is, we would have all the water run into our MILL.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What reason can you</HI> Jacobites <HI>give that you had rather be Papists than Presbyterians?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Because we can have more Elbow room a∣mong the Papists than amongst those straight lac'd dis∣ciplinarians.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What think you of some of the Fathers of the Church of the</HI> Highest Rank, <HI>that are for</HI> Peace and A∣greement <HI>with others, since 'tis only in small matters that we differ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We snarle and Burlesque and affront them, because we think them Luke-warm in our Religion. For should we give the Dissenters an Inch they would take an Ell, nothing will satisfie them but the <HI>ruine of the Church</HI> as it is Established by Law.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="000587_0009_0FA95B62C6629520"/>
Quest. <HI>Suppose they were tryed and somewhat else would please them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I am never for yielding to that, for our Church is <HI>Sufficiently Reform'd</HI> already to our minds tho' not to theirs.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>How long may we teach</HI> Passive Obedience <HI>be fore the Great Men of the Kingdom will believe what we say?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ. Till Doomsday.</HI> For they will give the Parson the hearing, who to get Preferment will Preach up that Doctrine, but are very unwilling to be brought to practise it.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What made you no more concern'd for the loss of those brave Patriots of your Country,</HI> Essex, Russel, <HI>&amp;c. who lost their Lives in defence of their Country and its Liberties.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> By reason we thought them not enough bi∣gotted to our ways, tho' they were for the Church of <HI>England,</HI> yet they were too moderate for to keep our Friendship long.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What must the poor</HI> Protestants in Ireland <HI>think of you, who were so near Ruine by the means of your slow Proceedings here.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> They know e're this what one of our Party said of them. Hang them they are a <HI>Pack of Phana∣ticks,</HI> and especially Northward <HI>Scotch Presbyterians.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What Opinion will the</HI> States of Holland <HI>and the</HI> Protestant Princes of Germany <HI>have of you for your Carriage to a Prince that they assisted with Men and Mony to come to your relief.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> They may think if they had not been in danger themselves, by the growing greatness of the <HI>French King,</HI> it had been no matter if we had perished.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="000587_0010_0FA95B650174F0A8"/>
Quest. <HI>What shall the Emperor of</HI> Germany <HI>think of you, hat you who pretend to be Protestants, should have any kind∣ness for</HI> King Lewis <HI>that would root out the</HI> Northern Heresie <HI>both at home and abroad.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> He may easily see that we are only Protest∣ants by the Custom of our Country where we live, &amp; that our Religion (for all our pretences) is to chuse, and say as one of his Predecessors once did, <HI>that the King of England is King of Devils.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Why since you have so great a kindness for King</HI> Lewis, <HI>will be not attow the</HI> English Fugitives <HI>a Chappel in your old Masters Pallace for the Exercise of that</HI> little Re∣ligion <HI>they carried over with them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> He is loath that any Heresie should be preach∣ed on Catholick ground, and as for the <HI>Doctrine of Non Resistance and Passive Obedience,</HI> his People have been taught that sufficiently by the <HI>Common Hangman,</HI> so that there is no need of our preaching it up there.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>But are you not ashamed that you should be Po∣pish Tools so long as you were in the former Reigns.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We did not think <HI>K. J.</HI> would have laid us aside so soon as he did, but he repented of it after∣wards, and if he had continued, we should have been his white Boys once more.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>But will not the English and French Papists laugh at you, to see you so willing to be fool'd by them a second time, that have been cheated by them once already.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We have dine to think of that we are <HI>so mad,</HI> that we are got under the Yoke of Princes, that are E∣nemies to Looseness and Debauchery (and as we <HI>Ja∣cobites</HI> think) smell too much of <HI>Puritanism.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Seeing you are so much for the Papist and the</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="000587_0011_0FA95B67E14136D0"/>
French Interest, <HI>what would you do if the French King should at last reject and slight you as he did</HI> K. C. <HI>and your old Master.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Then we will march for the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> for our Master is to succeed <HI>Godfrey</HI> King of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> as soon as the French Monarch has conquered <HI>Asia,</HI> and to be Crowned with Thorns in that Holy City as God∣frey was formerly.</P>

<HEAD>THE WILLIAMITES CATECHISM,</HEAD>
<P>Quest. <HI>WHat is your Name?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> WILLIAMITE.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Who gave you this Name?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> A person of <HI>Quality,</HI> who wrote our Character last year.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Why did he give you this Name?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> For our sincere Affection to our <HI>Royal Majesty King William.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Why do you bear such Affection to King William?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> For several Reason, as 1. For his great Ver∣tues
<PB N="10" REF="000587_0012_0FA95B68ED63C040"/>
of <HI>Temperance, Chastity, Magnanimity, Veracity,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. For his great Affection to the <HI>English Nation,</HI> ex∣pressed in putting in for our <HI>Timely Relief in</HI> 88. Pluck∣ing us out of the Jaws, of that Hellish Monster of <HI>Rome,</HI> who had got us between his teeth, to devour us.</P>
<P N="3">3. For exposing his <HI>Royal Person,</HI> to great danger, in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to recover the poor Protestans in that Kingdom, out of that <HI>Lost Condition,</HI> they were in, being outed of all their strong Towns, and Fortresses, but one, by <HI>Po∣pish Treachery,</HI> and at the mercy of those Bloody Assassi∣nates, who had murdered 200000 Men Women and Children, of that Profession, in <HI>Cold Blood,</HI> in 1641.</P>
<P N="4">4. For appearing in <HI>Flanders,</HI> to head the <HI>Confederates Forces</HI> raised to Chastise the insolency of the <HI>French King,</HI> who hath for a long time made his <HI>Sword, drunk with the Blood</HI> of Papists and Protestants, whose innocent blood Cries to Heaven for Vengeance.</P>
<P N="5">5. For that his <HI>Majesty, and his Ancestors,</HI> have ever since the reformation appeared more in the behalf of <HI>Oppressed Protestants,</HI> than any prince in Europe be∣sides.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>How can you own King</HI> Willam <HI>for your King, Seeing King</HI> James <HI>is yet living?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The Lords <HI>Spiritual, and Temporal,</HI> together with the <HI>House of Commons</HI> voted, that <HI>King James</HI> had Abdicated the <HI>Government,</HI> and left the Throne vacant, which they thought fit, and necessary to fill up, with the next in <HI>Blood K. William,</HI> and <HI>Q. Mary;</HI> and accor∣dingly did set the Crown upon their Heads,</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>How doth this make</HI> King William <HI>King</HI> de jure, <HI>tho he be King</HI> de facto.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We look upon him, that is King <HI>de facto</HI> to be
<PB N="11" REF="000587_0013_0FA95B699B667B08"/>
King <HI>de jure;</HI> for we are told by a good Historian (in his answer to <HI>Varillas</HI>) of a Law made by <HI>Henry</HI> the 7th That whoever is in possession of the crown, is to be ac∣knowledged as the <HI>Legal King,</HI> and the Author of that late Farce called the <HI>Royal Flight,</HI> or the <HI>Conquest of Ire∣land,</HI> tell us, that to distinguish between a King <HI>de jure</HI> and <HI>de facto;</HI> is a Jesuitical Nicety, and works like <HI>But∣ter in a Cows Tail.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>But if King</HI> James <HI>both abdicated the Govern∣ment, how can this Prejudice his Son the</HI> Prince of Wales? <HI>doth not his Right continue good still?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We have no <HI>Good Assurance</HI> that there was ever any such <HI>Prince,</HI> born of the late <HI>Queens</HI> Body, the whole <HI>Management</HI> of that affair, looks like a <HI>Popish Juggle and Cheat,</HI> put upon the Nation. <HI>Father Peters,</HI> giving out that 'twould be a Son long before the <HI>Pre∣tended Birth,</HI> a plain Evidence that it was a <HI>Jesuitical Contrivance</HI> to carry on Popish Designs, because <HI>Rome they saw would not be built in a</HI> D<HI>ay,</HI> they thought to take two days about it.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>But why did you pray for him as</HI> Prince of Wales, <HI>in your Parish Churches, for some Considerable time?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We knew not but that he was born of the late <HI>Queens Body,</HI> till we were informed by the <HI>Protest∣ants Remonstrance,</HI> that no <HI>Protestant Lady was at his Birth,</HI> and the whole business was managed by some <HI>French Madams,</HI> whom we can no more believe then we can their Master <HI>Lewis Le Grand.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>But may not this entail a War upon the Nati∣on?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We have had war with <HI>France</HI> before now,
<PB N="12" REF="000587_0014_0FA95B6A5B9752F0"/>
and may have again more than once, tho' this had ne∣ver been; and if we must all turn <HI>Quakers</HI> for fear of a War with <HI>France,</HI> 'tis as much as Mou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er looks for.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>But may he not have too much Advantage a∣gainst us, by reason of a Party that may be made amongst us, for this</HI> pretended Young Prince;</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The Papists and <HI>Popishly affected</HI> may be trou∣blesome, but a little wholsome severity will make them pluck in their Horns and be glad to be quiet.</P>
<P>Quest. But what if any trho' <HI>Tenderness of Conscience conceive themselves obliged to this</HI> Young Prince, <HI>and that he ought to have all their good</HI> Wishes?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Wishes and Woulders are no <HI>good Householders;</HI> let them hold there and not disturb the Peace of the Nation, and no body will molest them for the <HI>Tender∣ness of their Consciences.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>But will not this reflect upon the</HI> Protestant Re∣ligion, <HI>that Princes of a different perswasion should be barred from their Right meerly because of their difference from us in Religion?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I. A <HI>Popish Prince</HI> is not qualifyed by the <HI>Laws of this Land</HI> to Govern, nor so much as to live a∣mongst us, if the <HI>Law</HI> be followed against him. Now the <HI>Protestant Religion</HI> doth not oblige us to <HI>abandon our Laws and Priviledges,</HI> (which we enjoy as <HI>English Men</HI>) and hold up our <HI>Throats to a Popish Executioner,</HI> as long as we are sufficiently secured by the Laws of this Land from <HI>Popery and Tyranny.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. A <HI>Popish Prince,</HI> can give us no <HI>Security</HI> to Govern us according to the known Laws of the Land; for the <HI>Popish Clergy</HI> will absolve him from his Oath, and make

him their tool wherewith to ruine both us and our Religion.</P>
<P N="3">3 This cannot in the least reflect upon our <HI>Religion</HI> For here a great <HI>Prince</HI> apprehending a <HI>surreptitious prince,</HI> set up by Papists to debarr <HI>Him</HI> and his <HI>Princess</HI> of their Rights, comes in with his <HI>Sword in his Hand</HI> in his own Vindication, and the <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> came in before him, which struck such a terror into his enemies, that they <HI>fled, and carryed Young Perkin into another Land, a sufficient argument of their guilt;</HI> for it could be no Crime in the <HI>Midwife</HI> to deliver the Queen of a Son; neither had the pretended <HI>Young Prince,</HI> been in any danger among Protestants, who hate the <HI>Popish</HI> ways of sending <HI>Young Princes</HI> out of the world by <HI>Italian arts.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. We have no reason to Repent, that we suffered this <HI>brave Prince</HI> to enter quietly, according to our Doctrine of <HI>Non Resistance;</HI> for we have <HI>chan'gd Masters</HI> to our better Advantage, having now a King that <HI>go∣verns by Law, that invades no Mans Property, that no Jesuites in his Council to beard the Reverend Bishops of the Kingdom,</HI> that have right to sit there that doth not waste the <HI>Treasure of the Kingdom</HI> upon his <HI>L</HI>usts, but adds all his own to it to promote the publick welfare that seeks the <HI>good of the whole Nation,</HI> and to this end, hath endea∣voured to <HI>unite Protestants,</HI> which would be a great dis∣appointment to <HI>Popish Designs,</HI> who catch <HI>most Fish by troubling our Waters;</HI> a Prince that doth not side with <HI>one Party</HI> against another <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> some have formerly done, to the ruine of both <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> let <HI>JACOBITES</HI> and <HI>WILLIAMITES,</HI> Protestants and Protestant Dissenters, join together to <HI>bless God for such a King,</HI> and let them all meet together <HI>half way</HI> in order to a good Agree∣ment,

that they <HI>may love as Brethren,</HI> and keeep the <HI>Unity of the spirit in the bond of peace,</HI> which will no doubt be a rejoycing to the heart of our good King and Queen and all the Protestants beyond the Seas, and add much to the Infelicities of <HI>King Lewis</HI> who must needs be much cast down already to hear of the ill success of his <HI>Brothers Forces in Flavonia,</HI> and of his own in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and a little more such News out of <HI>Flanders, Piedment,</HI> and <HI>Catalonia,</HI> may make him as weary of the World, as the <HI>World</HI> hath been a long time of him.</P>
