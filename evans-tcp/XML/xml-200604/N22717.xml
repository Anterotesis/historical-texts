<LG>
<L>YE Alps audacious, thro' the Heavens that rise,</L>
<L>To cramp the day and hide me from the skies;</L>
<L>Ye Gallic flags, that o'er their heights unfurl'd,</L>
<L>Bear death to kings, and freedom to the world,</L>
<L>I sing not you. A softer theme I choose,</L>
<L>A virgin theme, unconscious of the Muse,</L>
<L>But fruitful, rich, well suited to inspire</L>
<L>The purest phrenzy of poetic fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Despise it not, ye Bards to terror steel'd,</L>
<L>Who hurl'd your thunders round the epic field;</L>
<L>Nor ye who strain your midnight throats to sing</L>
<L>Joys that the vineyard and the still-house bring:</L>
<L>Or on some distant fair your notes employ,</L>
<L>And speak of raptures that you ne'er enjoy.</L>
<L>I sing the sweets I know, the charms I feel,</L>
<L>My morning incense, and my evening meal,</L>
<L>The sweets of Hasty-Pudding Come, dear bowl,</L>
<L>Glide o'er my palate, and inspire my soul.</L>
<L>The milk beside thee, smoking from the kine.</L>
<L>Its substance mingled, married in with thine,</L>
<L>Shall cool and temper thy superior heat,</L>
<L>And save the pains of blowing while I eat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! could the smooth, the emblematic song</L>
<L>Flow like thy genial juices o'er my tongue,</L>
<L>Could those mild morsels in my numbers chime,</L>
<L>And as they roll in substance, roll in rhyme,</L>
<L>No more thy awkward, unpoetic name,</L>
<L>Should shun the Muse, or prejudice thy fame;</L>
<L>But rising grateful to th' accustom'd ear,</L>
<L>All Bards should catch it, and all realms revere!</L>

<L>Assist me first with pious toil to trace,</L>
<L>Thro' wrecks of time thy lineage and thy race;</L>
<L>Declare what lovely squaw, in days of yore,</L>
<L>(Ere great Columbus sought thy native shore)</L>
<L>First gave thee to the world; her works of fame</L>
<L>Have liv'd indeed, but liv'd without a name.</L>
<L>Some tawny Ceres, goddess of her days,</L>
<L>First learn'd with stones to crack the well-dry'd maize,</L>
<L>Thro' the rough sieve to shake the golden show'r,</L>
<L>In boiling water stir the yellow flour;</L>
<L>The yellow flour, bestrew'd and stirr'd with haste,</L>
<L>Swell in the flood and thickens to a paste,</L>
<L>Then puffs and wallops, rises to the brim,</L>
<L>Drinks the dry knobs that on the surface swim;</L>
<L>The knobs at last the busy ladle breaks,</L>
<L>And the whole mass its true consistence takes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Could but her sacred name, unknown so long,</L>
<L>Rise like her labors, to the son of song,</L>
<L>To her, to them, I'd consecrate my lays,</L>
<L>And blow her pudding with the breath of praise.</L>
<L>If 'twas Oella, whom I sang before,</L>
<L>I here ascribe her one great virtue more.</L>
<L>Not thro' the rich Peruvian realms alone</L>
<L>The fame of Sol's sweet daughter should be known</L>
<L>But o'er the world's wide climes should live secure,</L>
<L>Far as his rays extend, as long as they endure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dear Hasty-Pudding, what unpromis'd joy</L>
<L>Expands my heart, to meet thee in Savoy!</L>
<L>Doom'd o'er the world thro' devious paths to roam,</L>
<L>Each clime my country, and each house my home,</L>
<L>My soul is sooth'd, my cares have found an end,</L>
<L>I greet my long-lost, unforgotten friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For thee thro' Paris, that corrupted town,</L>
<L>How long in vain I wander'd up and down,</L>
<L>Where shameless Bacchus, with his drenching hoard,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="030024_0004_0FE3F1B9F3580330"/>Cold from his cave, usurps the morning board.</L>
<L>London is lost in smoke and steep'd in tea,</L>
<L>No Yankee there can lisp the name of thee;</L>
<L>The uncouth word, a libel on the town,</L>
<L>Would call a proclamation from the crown.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A certain king, at the time when this was written, was publishing proclamations to prevent American principles from being propagated in his country.</NOTE></L>
<L>For climes oblique, that fear the sun's full rays,</L>
<L>Chill'd in their fogs, exclude the generous maizeâ–ª</L>
<L>A grain whose rich luxurient growth requires</L>
<L>Short gentle showers, and bright etherial fires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But here tho' distant from our native shore,</L>
<L>With mutual glee we meet and laugh once more,</L>
<L>The same! I know thee by that yellow face,</L>
<L>That strong complexion of true Indian race,</L>
<L>Which time can never change, nor soil impair,</L>
<L>Nor Alpine snows, nor Turkey's morbid air;</L>
<L>For endless years, thro every mild domain,</L>
<L>Where grows the maize, there thou art sure to reign</L>

<L>But man, more fickle, the bold license claims,</L>
<L>In different realms to give thee different names.</L>
<L>Thee the soft nations round the warm Levant,</L>
<L><HI>Polanta</HI> call, the French of course <HI>Polante;</HI></L>
<L>Ev'n in thy native region, how I blush</L>
<L>To hear the Pennsylvanians call thee <HI>Mush!</HI></L>

<L>Insult and eat thee by the name <HI>suppawn.</HI></L>
<L>All spurious appellations void of truth:</L>
<L>I've better known thee from my earliest youth,</L>
<L>Thy name is <HI>Hasty-Pudding!</HI> thus our sires</L>
<L>Were wont to greet thee fuming from their fires;</L>
<L>And while they argu'd in thy just defence</L>
<L>With logic clear, they thus explain'd the sense:</L>
<L>"In <HI>haste</HI> the boiling caldron o'er the blaze,</L>
<L>"Receives and cooks the ready-powder'd maize.</L>
<L>"In <HI>haste</HI> 'tis serv'd, and then in equal <HI>haste.</HI></L>

<L>From thee what health, what vigor he possest,</L>
<L>Ten sturdy freemen from his loins attest;</L>
<L>Thy constellation rul'd my natal morn,</L>
<L>And all my bones were made of Indian corn.</L>

<L>The pudding of the bag, whose quivering breast,</L>

<L>To mix the food by vicious rules of art,</L>
<L>To kill the stomach and to sink the heart,</L>
<L>To make mankind to social virtue soor,</L>
<L>Cram o'er each dish, and be what they devour:</L>
<L>For this the kitchen Muse first fram'd her book,</L>
<L>Commanding sweets to stream from every cook;</L>
<L>Children no more their antic gambols tried,</L>
<L>And friends to physic wonder'd why they died.</L>
<L>Not so the Yankeeâ€”his abundant feast.</L>
<L>With simples furnished, and with plainness drest,</L>
<L>A numerous offspring gathers round the board,</L>
<L>And cheers alike the servant and the lord;</L>
<L>Whose well-bought hunger prompts the joyous taste,</L>
<L>And health attends them from the short repast.</L>

<L>While the full pail rewards the milk-maid's toil,</L>
<L>The mother sees the morning caldron boil;</L>
<L>To stir the pudding next demands their care,</L>
<L>To speed the table and the bowls prepare;</L>
<L>To feed the children, as their portions cool,</L>
<L>And comb their heads, and send them off to school</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet may the simplest dish some rules impart,</L>
<L>For nature scorns not all the aids of art.</L>
<L>E'en Hasty-Pudding, purest of all food,</L>
<L>May still be bad, indifferent, or good,</L>
<L>As sage experience the short process guides,</L>
<L>Or want of skill, or want of care presides,</L>
<L>Whoe'er would form it on the surest plan,</L>
<L>To rear the child and long sustain the man;</L>
<L>To shield the morals while it mends the size,</L>
<L>And all the powers of every food supplies,</L>
<L>Attend the lessons that the Muse shall bring,</L>
<L>Suspend your spoons, and listen while I sing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But since, O man! thy life and health demand</L>
<L>Not food alone, but labor from thy hand,</L>
<L>First in the field, beneath the sun's strong rays,</L>
<L>Ask of thy mother earth the needful maize;</L>
<L>She loves the race that courts her yielding soil,</L>
<L>And gives her bounties to the sons of toil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When now the ox, obedient to thy call,</L>
<L>Repays the loan that fill'd the winter stall,</L>
<L>Pursue his traces o'er the furrow'd plain,</L>
<L>And plant in measur'd hills the golden grain.</L>
<L>But when the tender germ begins to shoot,</L>
<L>And the green spire declares the sprouting root,</L>
<L>Then guard your nursling from each greedy foe,</L>
<L>Th' insidious worm, the all-devouring crow.</L>
<L>A little ashes sprinkled round the spire,</L>
<L>Soon steep'd in rain, will bid the worm retire;</L>
<L>The feather'd robber with his hungry maw</L>
<L>Swift flies the field before your man of straw,</L>
<L>A frightful image, such as tom-boys bring,</L>
<L>When met to burn the Pope, or hang the King.</L>

<L>Slow springs the blade, while cheek'd by chilâˆ£ling rains,</L>
<L>Ere yet the sun the seat of Cancer gains;</L>
<L>But when his fiercest fires emblaze the land,</L>
<L>Then start the juices, then the roots expand.</L>
<L>Then, like a column of Corinthian mould,</L>
<L>The stalk struts upward, and the leaves unfold.</L>
<L>The bushy branches all the ridges till,</L>
<L>Entwine their arms, and kiss from hill to hill.</L>
<L>Here cease to vex them, all your cares are done,</L>
<L>Leave the last labors to the parent sun;</L>
<L>Beneath his genial smiles the well-drest field.</L>
<L>When autumn calls, a plenteous crop shall yield.</L>

<L>Now the strong foliage bears the standards high</L>
<L>And shoots the tall top-gallants to the sky;</L>

<L>And pregnant grown, their swelling coats distend;</L>

<L>Small compensation for the two-fold bliss,</L>
<L>The promis'd wedding and the present kiss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Slight depredations these, but now the moon</L>

<L>THE days grow short; but tho' the falling sun</L>
<L>To the glad swain proclaims his day's work done,</L>
<L>Night's pleasing shades his various task prolong,</L>
<L>And yield new subjects to my various song.</L>
<L>For now the corn-house fill'd, the harvest home,</L>
<L>Th' invited neighbours to the <HI>Husking</HI> come;</L>
<L>A frolic scene, where work, and mirth, and play,</L>
<L>Unite their charms, to chase the hours away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where the huge heap lies center'd in the hall,</L>
<L>The lamp suspended from the cheerful wall,</L>
<L>Brown corn-fed nymphs and strong hard-handed beaux,</L>
<L>Alternate rang'd, extend in circling rows,</L>
<L>Assume their seats, the solid mass attack;</L>
<L>The dry husks rustle and the corn cobs crack:</L>
<L>The song, the laugh, alternate notes resound,</L>
<L>And the sweet cider trips in silence round.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The laws of Husking ev'ry wight can tell;</L>
<L>And sure no laws he ever keeps so well.</L>
<L>For each red ear a general kiss he gains,</L>

<L>Red as her lips, and taper as her waist,</L>

<L>Who leaps, the luscious tribute to bestow.</L>
<L>Various the sport, as are the wits and brains</L>
<L>Of well pleased lasses and contented swains;</L>
<L>Till the vast mound of corn is sweep away,</L>
<L>And he that gets the last ear, wins the day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Meanwhile the house-wife urges all her care,</L>
<L>The well-earn'd feast to hasten and prepare.</L>
<L>The sifted meal already waits her hand,</L>
<L>The milk is strain'd, the bowls in order stand,</L>
<L>The fire flames high; and, as a pool (that takes breaks)</L>
<L>The headlong stream that o'er the mill-dam</L>
<L>Foams, roars and rages with incessant toils,</L>
<L>So the vext caldron rages, roars and boils.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>First with clean salt she seasons well the food,</L>
<L>Then strews all flour and thickens all the flood.</L>
<L>Long o'er the simmering fire she lets it stand;</L>
<L>To stir it well demands a stronger hand;</L>
<L>The husband takes his turn; and round and round</L>
<L>The ladle flies; at last the toil is crown'd;</L>

<L>More copious matters to my faithful song.</L>
<L>For rules there are, tho' ne'er unfolded yet,</L>

<L>Some with molasses line the luscious treat,</L>
<L>And mix, like Bards, the useful with the sweet.</L>
<L>A wholesome dish and well deserving praise,</L>
<L>A great resource in those bleak wintry days,</L>
<L>When the chill'd earth lies buried deep in snow,</L>
<L>And raging Boreas drives the shivering cow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>

<L>Great source of health, the only source of joy;</L>
<L>Mother of Egypt's god, but sure for me</L>

<L>How oft thy teats these pious hands have prest!</L>
<L>How oft thy bounties prove my only feast!</L>
<L>How oft I've fed thee with my fav'rite grain!</L>
<L>And roar'd, like thee, to find thy children slain!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye swains who know her various worth to prize,</L>
<L>Ah! house her well from Winter's angry skies.</L>

<L>Milk then with pudding I should always chuseâ–ª</L>
<L>To this in future I confine my Muse,</L>
<L>Till she in haste some further hints unfold,</L>
<L>Well for the young, nor useless to the old.</L>
<L>First in your bowl the milk abundant take,</L>
<L>Then drop with care along the silver lake</L>
<L>Your slakes of pudding; these at first will hide</L>
<L>Their little bulk beneath the swelling tide;</L>
<L>But when their growing mass no more can sink,</L>
<L>When the soft island looms above the brink,</L>
<L>Then check your hand; you've got the portion's due,</L>
<L>So taught our sires, and what they taught is true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There is a choice in spoons. Tho' small appear</L>
<L>The nice distinction, yet to me 'tis clearâ–ª</L>
<L>The deep bowl'd Gallic spoon, contriv'd to scoop</L>
<L>In ample draughts the thin diluted soup,</L>
<L>Performs not well in those substantial things,</L>
<L>Whose mass adhesive to the metal clings;</L>
<L>Where the strong labial muscles must embrace,</L>
<L>The gentle curve, and sweep the hollow space.</L>
<L>With ease to enter and discharge the freight,</L>
<L>A bowl less concave but still more dilate,</L>
<L>Becomes the pudding best. The shape, the size,</L>
<L>A secret rests unknown to vulgar eyes,</L>
<L>Experienc'd feeders can alone impart</L>
<L>A rule so much above the lore of art.</L>
<L>These tuneful lips, that thousand spoons have tried,</L>
<L>With just decision could the point decide,</L>
<L>Tho' not in song; the muse but poorly shines</L>
<L>In cones, and cubes, and geometric lines.</L>
<L>Yet the true form, as near as she can tell,</L>
<L>Is that small section of a goose-egg-shell,</L>
<L>Which in two equal portions shall divide</L>
<L>The distance from the centre to the side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fear not to slaver; 'tis no deadly sin,</L>
<L>Like the free Frenchman, from your joyous chin</L>
<L>Suspend the ready napkin; or, like me,</L>
<L>Poise with one hand your bowl upon your knee;</L>
<L>Just in the zenith your wise head project,</L>
