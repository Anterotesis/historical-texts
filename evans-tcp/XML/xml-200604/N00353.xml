<P>I<HI>T pleased the Lord in his holy Wisdom to afflict me with a Fever in the moneths of</HI> July <HI>and</HI> August, 1684. <HI>and in his own due time to command its departure. As an offer∣ing of praise and thankfulness to the Majesty and Mercy of God. I thought of composing this Tract, though under the remaining weakness derived from an autumnal distemper: yet thereby I humbly hope some benefit may arrive to broken and tempted Spirits. For though my mouth be shut and silent as to Publick Ser∣vice, yet I should greatly rejoice, if my heart could be opened in Print, to help any towards heaven. The Dedication is proper to your

most noble person, if you please to accept, what would be an infringement of duty not to pre∣sent to you who have so often refreshed me and mine in my privacies and retirements, kindnesses not to be buried in the grave of in∣gratitude: but to be acknowledged before the Sun. Your Library was also most kindly open∣ed to my use: wherein stands many an ancient Author, calling aloud for converse, and reach∣ing out his auxiliary hand, and pointing at the state of Christianity in former and purer ages. There did I first consider of the con∣signation of the Canon of Scripture which is toucht upon in these Papers, but might be much more amplified and adorned: had I more con∣stancy of abode and supplies of the yet re∣maining Records of the first five hundred years that have happily survived the flaming fury and rage of the barbarous Goths and Van∣dals and other wasters of both the East and Western Empire, which might have conduced to the compleating of such a work. But we must wait the times of Divine Wisdom in appointment of any such happy seasons to view those desirable monuments.</HI></P>

I answer to the first and third because being interrupted in my greatest work, I would gladly be some way useful in my generation: It may be, some that mourn in secret, and others that are as yet not called, but under the Election of Grace may attend and meditate on these things. Tho Preaching or Printing prevail but little with this de∣generate age,</HI> (Jer. 6.29.) <HI>though the Bellowes be burnt in the fire, and the lead consumed which was appointed to purify the drossy Oare: yet with</HI> Jeremy <HI>and</HI> Esay, <HI>and</HI> Paul <HI>we must in our several ages keep on where God opens the door of opportunity for us, tho</HI> Israel <HI>be not ga∣thered, let the Labour of faithful Workmen wait for its reward from the Lord of the Har∣vest.

<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<P>HAving Observed, that many Chri∣stians spend their Dayes in the Valley of Sorrow, and walking up and down very pensive, being full of Fears and Doubts about their eternal Estate, can perform no chearful Service to God, bring little honour to their Profession, or comfort to their Relations, or any sweet quiet to their own spirits: I often pondered what should be the bitter root of all this Wormwood and Gall, and being very de∣sirous to deal in compassion, as having been under some tentations, I spake with several, and found upon conference these following to be the principal causes of this Bondage of Spirit.</P>
<P>The I. Was great ignorance of the true nature of Faith, and of the main funda∣mental Truths of the Gospel, which did a∣maze me to find upon search in so many glittering, talking, but indeed shallow Pro∣fessors.</P>
<P N="2"><PB REF="000429_0009_0FA5B0900FC61218"/>
2. Another wa<HI>s</HI> the great Levity, Van<HI>i</HI>∣ty, and Laxness of their lives, trifling out their precious time in fidling querks, tales and jests, to please some whose Trenchers they hang upon like the Parasites in <HI>Theo∣phrastus,</HI> not lihe the blessed People of the former age, who far outshined us in the pu∣rity of Conversation, and therefore in the brightness of their assurance.</P>
<P N="3">3. Others I observed to be of a froward, perverse, ill-natur'd, ill-conditioned, sower humor, full of prate and unprofitable mul∣tiplicity of words, censures, backbitings, hollowness of true friendship: often mur∣muring at God, and quarrelling with their Superiors.</P>
<P N="4">4. Others I perceived to be naturally of a fearful, timorous, wavering, inconstant, suspitious spirit, ever learning, and never coming to the knowledg of the Truth.</P>
<P N="5">5. And to end, most people extream worldly, couvetous, full of fordid, over∣reaching tricks and cunning cheats in dea∣ling, and unless for a show, basely backward to any excellent works of charity, and strict in examining the poor, to find an evasion which <HI>Jerom</HI> so complains of in some of his
<PB REF="000429_0010_0FA5B090DA9A4D80"/>
age. Such as these eat out the very po∣wer of godliness, and rob themselves of the season of meditation, <HI>Periclitatur religio in negotiis</HI> Piety is lost in a crowd of worldly bu∣siness with these and the rest I must declare that the holy Spirit of God delights not to hold communion, as being fiery or miry Spirits.</P>
<P>Hereupon in my retirements (I hope by the Grace of God) I pitcht my thoughts (when I could not be so publickly useful as formerly) upon the composing a small Treatise of the genuine nature of Faith, and in a peculiar Chapter to shew the indi∣vidual connexion of Sanctification of heart and life in every gracious Believer.</P>
<P>In the management whereof, I thought it might not be inexpedient to lay its foun∣dation upon the Doctrine of the verity of the Scriptures in one Chapter, and of the Deity of our blessed Lord in a second af∣ter the Preface; the former being the Doctri∣nal object of Faith, &amp; the latter the personal.</P>
<P>Now forasmuch that in all Sciences there be certain Principles, on which their Theoremes and Maximes are built: we may consider of the like in Divinity, that
<PB REF="000429_0011_0FA5B0919192F278"/>
the Holy Scriptures, (2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.15.16.) (be∣ing able to make us wise to Salvation) are the only true Basis and Foundation, on which all the great Doctrines of Holiness and Happiness do most firmly insist. In particular that great point of Faith, which bears it self on the new Covenant of Grace, revealed in those sacred Pages. I thought meet therefore briefly to endeavour the proof of this high point, that the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are the undoubted Word of the living God; and thereby to be received with all veneration imaginable as the solid fundamental of true Christianity, &amp; in special of the weighty Doctrine of Faith: And this I have the more willingly performed at the entrance of this Tract, that good Christians may not (I hope) need to go other where to draw: But have sufficient to settle their Faith on this Foundation, tho it be more amply en∣larged upon abroad.</P>
<P>Now whereas it may be said that Princi∣ples are indemonstrable, as in <HI>Mathematicks</HI> and other Sciences, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Suarez. 5to. Met∣taph.</HI> L. C.</NOTE> we must understand that Maxim of the Principles of Essence
<PB REF="000429_0012_0FA5B09566BFD878"/>
and not of cognition or knowledg. It is so, as to the verity of Holy Scriptures, we cannot demonstrate them any further (and tis enough) than that they are founded on the glorious Authority of the infinitely wise, true, and most holy God, as consenta∣nious to the verity and excellency of his na∣ture, and published by his injunction, as the rule of life and means of communion with himself in eternal happinesss. The Lord hath spoken, and who shall not tremble? (<HI>Amos</HI> 3.8.) Oh that Majestick stile, (<HI>Ezek</HI> 14.4. <HI>&amp;c</HI>) [<HI>Thus faith the LORD</HI>] makes Men and Devils to quake, and rottenness to enter into their Spirits, when God sets it home upon their consciences.</P>
<P>My Design then is to shew, that at the Revelation and Exhibition of the holy vo∣lumes, that I may both satisfie and confirm weak Believers, and convince (if possible) scoffing Atheists, that there were such migh∣ty Testimonies of their divine, original at∣tending the dispensing of them to the Church and the World that may convince all of their Heavenly Off-spring! If persons but not on the veil of wilful ignorance, (2 <HI>cor.</HI> 3. 15.) detaining the truth in un∣righteousness.
<PB REF="000429_0013_0FA5B0980C355DC0"/>
And in the close it will ap∣pear that Hystorical Faith well grounded is useful to true and saving Faith.</P>
<P>There are then two principal points which did await their sliding down from Heaven into the hearts of the illuminated Pen-men inspired by the Holy Ghost, and the utter∣ing of them to the People in their distinct Ages, which may be comprehended in the first Chapter.</P>
<P N="1">1. The wonderful Oracles and Prophe∣cies mentioned in those sacred leaves, which have been punctually fulfilled in the seve∣ral Generations of the Church.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Divine Miracles above and be∣yond the power of nature; exhibited at those two great junctures, the delivery of the Law by <HI>Moses,</HI> and the promulgation of the Gospel at Mount Zion. In the conclu∣sion of this first Chapter, I intend (God willing) to treat somewhat of the consig∣nation of the Canon of Holy Scripture, a Point much desired by some, and may be of use to others.</P>
<P>In the second Chapter, let us speak to the Deity of our blessed Lord: which in∣deed is the grand point of Christian Reli∣gion
<PB REF="000429_0014_0FA5B09A2F1EE1A8"/>
&amp; the very Foundation of the Church of God, as <HI>Nicephorus Callis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> reports a Story of a deep Cave discovered at <HI>Jerusa∣lem</HI> under the ruines of the old Temple (when the <HI>Jews</HI> by the permission and in∣stigation of <HI>Julian</HI> to contradict the Pro∣phecy of our Lord, would needs attempt to build it again, but were beaten off by Thunder and Lightning) where they found within it upon a Stone Pillar the Go∣spel of the Apostle <HI>John,</HI> fairly laid and pre∣served. Let the Patriarch protect the truth of the story: I mention it allusively to this great Truth that lies at the Foundation of the true Church, that the Deity of Christ the principal design of <HI>John's</HI> Gospel, is the only Rock laid by the Father in Zion, (<HI>Isai.</HI> 28.16.) without which our Faith sinks, and all our hopes vanish. If that be a nullity, all is gone, Christianity is a vain Profession and our Bibles as to Christ and the new Co∣venant of Grace of no value.</P>
<P>Wherefore O <HI>Professors</HI> of this true Reli∣gion hold these two points inviolable as your lives [<HI>Tho verity of the Scriptures, and the Deity of Christ</HI>] Then may we safely and comfortably proceed to the main
<PB REF="000429_0015_0FA5B09A691D92E0"/>
subject of this Discourse, the nature of true saving Faith: which I have divided into ten Chapters, but shall inlarge principally on three or four, being the drift and scope of my writing to help the Joy of FAITH in those poor hearts; who tho truly gracious, yet like young <HI>Samuel,</HI> cannot well discern the voice and presence of Christ. And this my undertaking I beg the divine help and Grace to assist and prosper, extending my time and health after my late sickness, ac∣cording to his blessed will, affording the fa∣vourable influence of his loving counte∣nance.</P>
<P>This Tract divides into two parts. The first containing the Foundation; the second the more visible superstructure about the nature of faith. The first concluding with two Chapters, and the second with ten.</P>
<P>But whereas some may question, what need any further on this Subject, wherein several <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> already travelled. I may re∣joyne that Holy <HI>Luke</HI> thought meet (in his pure Greek) as to his handling that heaven∣ly Subject of our Lords Life, (<HI>Luk.</HI> 1. 1.) that though many had taken it in hand be∣fore, yet he would set forth some things not
<PB REF="000429_0016_0FA5B09A9F0A59A0"/>
mentioned by other Evangelists. Yea, how many in almost all ages have prosecuted the same points in Divinity with benefit and use to the Church, both in Commentaries and Controversies? This consideration incouraged these Lines to appear: having observed some further need of these Chap∣ters, on which I mainly insist, and were the great motive of my writing, and are but little toucht heretofore, and yet are very useful to chosen Vessels; Yet, the far great∣er number of the truly gracious Servants of God. To whom it you draw near, and can have the happiness to come with∣in them for their good (for they are shy &amp; aware of every approach) you may find their lives to hang in an anxious suspence between fear and hope, and feed only upon some few gracious glimpses, like the Beams from between <HI>April</HI> Clouds let down out of Heaven into their hearts to sustain their Spirits from sinking, and to preserve from dying under grievous Fits of the palpitation of their hearts.</P>
<P>To these I chiefly bend my Souls desire
<PB REF="000429_0017_0FA5B09B6BE97098"/>
and humbly beg the dewes of <HI>Zion</HI> upon these Meditations and Labours, that nei∣ther they nor I may faint under lost ex∣pectations of Mercy.</P>
<P>And so I finish the Preface, and come to the Treatise it self.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Authority of the Sacred Scriptures.</HEAD>
<P>THat the Holy Scriptures, wherein we daily read and meditate for our instruction in order to Eternal Life are the very words of God, there are many weighty arguments to evince it upon the hearts of all sober and well-inclined persons; nay, which by the good conduct
<PB N="2" REF="000429_0019_0FA5B09CF3408390"/>
of Gods spirit may influence the minds of Heathen and Atheists, would they but im∣prove the common light of reason, that Candle of the Lord. Nay, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prov.</HI> 20. 27. <HI>James</HI> 2. 19. <HI>Mat.</HI> 8. 29. <HI>Mat.</HI> 4. 2, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <HI>Mark.</HI> 5. 7.</NOTE> Devils them∣selves who believe and tremble at the Judg∣ment to come, and desire of our Lord not to torment them before that time: do quote them in argument against our blessed Savi∣our in his tentations, and acknowledge his Deity as being the Son of God.</P>
<P>But I shall not dwell upon the several Heads to clear this truth, so often insisted upon by the Pious and Learned, in their Systems and Bodies of Divinity, but I shall only touch some of them, and inlarge upon one or two, which are the chief design of this Chapter.</P>
<P N="1">1. One Argument that some mention is their venerable Antiquity, which though it be no cogent proof, vet allowing that of an ancient, (<HI>quo quid antiquius, co verius</HI>) that Truth is elder than Error, I would not lay aside the pains of <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> and others, who prove that the writings of <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> are ancienter than any the Heathen world can pretend to. To which I would annex their stupendious preservation through the fury of all ages, especially the raging flames of <HI>Antiochus</HI> and <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> those cruel Persecutors of the Church of God; neither would I be silent as to the invincible pains, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Buxior<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Tiberias</HI></NOTE> and toile which the <HI>Jew∣ish</HI> Masorites underwent to preserve the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Original. With such exactness did they manage that Affair, that they had <HI>in numerato,</HI> punctually set down every word and every letter in the whole Bible,
<PB N="3" REF="000429_0020_0FA5B09D9A545B40"/>
and did also set down which was the middle word and middle letter of the whole, and I think of every individual Book: which was indeed a high providence of God towards the conservation of those happy leaves; and I could heartily wish the New Testa∣ment had been so guarded by industrious and holy persons in the primitive times. Nay it were well, if yet at this day some pious Rectors of <HI>Universities</HI> and <HI>Schools of Learn∣ing</HI> would take up the ancientest and purest Copies, and perform it at this time. The Masorites did the work long after the first penning of them on purpose to preserve it in their dispersions.</P>
<P>But I proceed to other Arguments, As</P>
<P N="2">2. The Majesty of their Stile, that might justly make the <HI>Universe</HI> tremble, and all the powers of darkness to hide their heads in the dark Chaos of confusion.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Heavenly Harmony of their di∣stinct parts, tho written in various Ages, and distinct places.</P>
<P N="4">4. The self-denial of the Pen-men, dis∣covering their own sins and heart corrup∣tions with the follies and weakness of their nearest and dearest relations, which is not done by other Writers, as <HI>Thucydides, Xe. nophon,</HI> or <HI>Plutarch,</HI> or <HI>Livy,</HI> but especially by Law-givers, which might disparage their Government; as the compilers of the twelve Tables, or <HI>Theodosius</HI> in his Codex, or <HI>Justinian</HI> in his Pandects, or other his Sanctions of the Civil Law.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="4" REF="000429_0021_0FA5B09E590C9130"/>
5. The Sublimity and spirituality of the Mysteries therein discovered far beyond the invention or comprehension of men or An∣gels. They may <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (if they please) and pry towards them▪ <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 12.</NOTE> but none except the Lion of <HI>Judab</HI> can <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> both open the Seals, and expound the mystical depths of this admirable vo∣lumne. So far is it beyond the brains of the most fine spun Philosopher, that <HI>Amelius</HI> the Platonick in <HI>Clem</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI> con∣fessed of the first verses of the Apostle <HI>Johns</HI> Gospel [<HI>This Barbarian</HI> faith he] hath com∣prized more stupendious matters in three lines, then we in all our Volumns.</P>
<P>I might adjoyn to this the purity and ho∣liness of its subject matter, and the glorious scope and design for our everlasting com∣munion with God in heaven.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the sixth place, a principal argu∣ment may be deduced from the Imperial Power and Efficacy on the Souls and Con∣sciences of men; both as to conviction of sin, sustentation of wounded Spirits, and their consolation under the darkest clouds and deepest confusions, while we are in this valley of Dragons, which is the reason why truly gracious persons wade and dive through Sicknesses, Troubles and strong anxieties; when wicked and ungodly men languish and perish a thousand times over and over, because the former enjoy the sweet influences of the Spirit of God in the promises of the Gospel, to cool their con∣sciences and calm their spirits into a hal∣cyon serenity, and sometimes tread upon the Asp and Dragon without any fear.
<PB N="5" REF="000429_0022_0FA5B09F6E14A950"/>
By these and the like meanes the Scriptures confirm and ascertain themselves like self-e∣vident principles: when the Spirit of God strikes aside the Curtains and Vailes of ig∣norance, and purges the Corruptions out of the minds of men.</P>

Nations from the East to the Western-In∣dies, whitened the <HI>Black-Moores,</HI> civilized the hearts of <HI>Scythians</HI> more ferine, ragged and bruitish, than the Rocks and <HI>Hiccanian</HI> Tygers, that give them suck, and beautifi∣ed the barbariously painted <HI>Britains</HI> far be∣yond the Oratory of the <HI>Gaules.</HI> It could be no other power than the awful dread of the Divine Majesty, and the melting sweet∣ness of his mercy concomitant with his hea∣venly Word.

<P>I shall intreat my ingenuous and pious Readers kind leave to descend into the bow∣els of two arguments to give evidence to the truth of the Holy <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and so conclude this present chapter.

such as had the happiness to be spectators of either, are in some part attested and confirmed by Heathens themselves, and cleared off by several Writers of unquesti∣onable authority, confessing the matters of fact, which were accomplisht in the succe∣ssions of several ages, with great exactness and punctuality.</P>

<P>FOr this purpose, it must be laid down for a standing rule, that the certain and determinate foreknowledge and predi∣ction of future events long before they come to pass, is an undeniable evidence of infinite Wisdom and Power, and compati∣ble to no created being Hence, the Lord challenges this glory to his own name: that former things foretold by him did is∣sue in the time predicted.

him there was no God formed, nor shall be after him. Which argument is amplified and prosecuted in the forty sixth and forty eìghth chapters, asserting the Di∣vinity of his Essence, and the verity of his declarations and prophecies.

<P>I shall now enter upon some of the fa∣mous Oracles of <HI>S</HI>cripture, which have bin so plainly verified before the eyes of many Nations, that several <HI>P</HI>hilosophers and Hi∣storians of the Gentiles have confessed this t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uth, and born witness, to their eventual fulfillings and doubtless honoured and em∣braced those Divine Parchmonts with great veneration; when many of them travelled into <HI>Syria,</HI> and had the great happiness by the leave of some Rulers of Synagegues, (<HI>prece &amp; pretio</HI>) using gifts and intreaties to behold and read those heavenly prophe∣cies; and 'tis more than likely, that many notions among the ancient <HI>P</HI>latonists are

corruptions of and Compositions with the matter of those profound Writings.</P>
<P>But before further procedure, I must premise, that for want of my Library at hand, since my sad recess from my most de∣sired services, <HI>I</HI> am forced to make the best use <HI>I</HI> can of my memory, and therefore cannot make my Citations so perfect and exact, as <HI>I</HI> else would: and partly from the defect of Historians in barbarous ages; we are not able to ioy nt every Oracle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o its precise complement: <HI>I</HI> shall yet endea∣vour to recal as many as <HI>I</HI> can, leaving the rest to further oppertunities by Divine leave. <HI>B</HI>esides <HI>I</HI> do not think it very pro∣per to over-burden this tract or insist ve∣ry long on such things, which else are use∣ful to settle our faith upon a solid founda∣tion, since our chief aim is the Doctrine of Faith it self.</P>

<P N="5">5. In what place.</P>
<P N="6">6. At what time he should appear, and all those fulfilled to a tittle: which demon∣strate the Divine Original of the Holy Scriptures.</P>
<P>Besides these Oracles concerning our blessed Lord so exactly fulfilled and arrested partly by Heathens, partly by Jews and pri∣mitive Historians, but especially by the New Testament, which that it must be admitted for a competent witness will be <HI>I</HI> hope evi∣dent by the Divine Authority in the consig∣nation of the <HI>C</HI>anon spoken to in the close of this Chapter: There remain yet some Prophecies to be briefly rehearsed, which yield a further and great light in this point of the verity of Scripture-predictions, and therefore of their Divinity.</P>
<P>For instance, the universal deluge prophe∣cied by <HI>Noah</HI> 120 years, before it came: which antedate of years if not mentioned before by others, yet the deluge it self is confirmed by many Heathens, even Youths at school, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> de Solert <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

the whole Heaven were covered, I am sorry that any should open the door to A∣theists to play upon Scripture. Which ha∣ving declared that All the high hills were covered, adds further, that the waters did prevail fifteen cubits above those Moun∣tains and what vast high Mountains they are wherein the Ark rested, which were anciently called A<HI>rarat,</HI> as if.

<P>But there is one thing more that may demonstrate the contrary to their weak opi∣nion about particularity of the deluge; be∣cause, if the waters were higher than those exalted craggy tops in <HI>Armenia,</HI> and other places there must have followed a power∣ful defl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x of that liquid element, whereby all Champion Conntries must be overflow∣ed to give an aequilibration or poise from all sides of the world upon the Center.

<P>When the great deliverer of the Jews
<PB N="18" REF="000429_0035_0FA5B0B3841F38B8"/>
came abroad in the world, some assert, (as I remember) that they shewed him <HI>Isaia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Prophecy concerning himself written so long before: not unlike to what <HI>Jaddua</HI> the High-priest did in reading to <HI>Alexander</HI> out of <HI>Daniel,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Josephus</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 11. <HI>c.</HI> 8.</NOTE> the predictions of his great conquests over the <HI>Persian</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>But to draw towards an end, in mentio∣ning a few more, tho there be many; the irreparable ruine of <HI>Edom</HI> spoken of, long before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when there remained nei∣ther name nor nation, but as wrapt up in <HI>Idumea</HI> a little parcel of the Province of <HI>Judea</HI> under th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Romans</HI> which contained the <HI>Phi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istim</HI> Country, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> south∣ward. Nay, there be many other King∣doms fell under the same prophetical doom, that are now lurking in their ruines and ra∣venous beasts, preying upon the bones of the ancient Cities. Of all other, that of <HI>Egypt</HI> is remarkable, that it should be a base Kingdom; nay, the basest of Kingdoms, and should exalt it self no more, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ezek.</HI> 29. 15</NOTE> and so it has been ever since the <HI>Persians</HI> conquered it, under whom it groaned, and then turned to the <HI>Grecians</HI> under one of <HI>Alexanders</HI> Captains till <HI>Cleopatra:</HI> then a provincial to the <HI>Ro</HI>∣mans, and after them to the <HI>Saracens</HI> the <HI>Mamalukes</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> by whom it is dread∣fully pillaged and plunged by every new <HI>Bas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> to this day.</P>
<P>But above all we should mind and dili∣gently <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dan.</HI> 2. <HI>&amp;</HI> 7</NOTE> observe that most famous prophecy of the fonr great Monarchies in <HI>Daniel;</HI> whose truth almost every History of the ci∣vil

Nations demonstrates age by age, from <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> to the end of the world. Which as it is twice exemplified under two visions. so the fourth or <HI>Roman</HI> is much more amplified by holy <HI>John</HI> in his <HI>Patmus</HI> Revela∣tions. By both which as by two great tor∣ches every man in his proper age beholds the verity of scripture prophecies, to shine forth most illustriously: and we may be as certain of what remains yet unfulfilled, to receive its accomplishment as of that we have read, and heard, and seen, performed before our eyes.</P>
<P>There is one Prophecy I would not let slip, and that is in the Prophet <HI>Zephaniah,</HI> which declares that <HI>G</HI>od will famish all the Gods of the earth: and men shall worship him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eth</HI> 3: 11</NOTE> every one from his place, even all the Isles of the Heathen.

It is related also, that the <HI>T</HI>emple of <HI>Apollo</HI> at <HI>Delphos</HI> in <HI>Phocis</HI> of the <HI>Grecians</HI> (where after∣wards true Religion was set up) was o∣verthrown by Earthquakes and Thunder and at the same time when <HI>Jerusalems Tem∣ple</HI> was destroyed, and neither of them re∣built to this day: to intimate that <HI>Pagan</HI> worship of the Heathens, and the cere∣monious

worship of the Jews should be removed, and give place to the Christian Worship in spirit and <HI>T</HI>ruth.</P>
<P><HI>The last thing that I shall mention is the noble prophecy of the conversion of the Gen∣tiles, so often set forth in many Chapters: the fulfilling whereof is attested by multitudes of Authors of all Countries, how T</HI>homas <HI>in the East converted the Indians, and that the poste∣rity of them that resisted him, are markt at this day with one leg much bigger than the other, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Capt. <HI>Prout</HI></NOTE> as I received by eye-witnesses for a truth; but the account is only a child of tradition: In the Northwest the Scythians were converted by</HI> An∣drew, <HI>and thence their Posterity the Scots own him for their Tutelars</HI> S<HI>aint. The</HI> Britains <HI>as many assert were converted by</HI> Joseph <HI>of</HI> Arima∣thea, <HI>the</HI> Egyptians <HI>and</HI> Abyssines <HI>by Mark and his Disciples.</HI></P>
<P>But I proceed no further, it may be ob∣served by every ones experience to this ve∣ry day. These things require just <HI>T</HI>reati∣ses to inlarge upon, and to display in their full and lovely colours.</P>
<P>But yet that I may set before all a method to convince every candid person of the truth of Scripture upon this score, and hence their divine original; I would de∣sire them to do but two things:</P>
<P N="1">1. To observe and study what Prophe∣cies the <HI>cardo saeculi</HI> the present state and scene of things determine us to be under
<PB N="21" REF="000429_0038_0FA5B0B59AFB8820"/>
the fulfilling at this present day.</P>
<P N="2">2. I recommend to their continued stu∣dious observation, what things remain yet to be fulfilled, that they may thereby be daily satisfied and fully convinced: For if the great God have thought fit in love and mercy to reveal such great things to his Church: we ought to lay aside our trifles and vanities of contradiction, and observe the workings of his Providence which con∣tinually rowle upon the wheels of Pro∣phecy. And therefore I shall name some Prophecies yet to be fulfilled:</P>
<P>The second coming of Christ was pro∣phecied of by <HI>Enoch</HI> before the Flood, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jude</HI> 14 <HI>Numb:</HI> 24: 17. 19. 24: Rev: 8: 2:</NOTE> and by some part of <HI>Baalams</HI> Prophecy; But the New Testament blows many Trumpets over Prophecies, as if challenging the whole World to observe this issue, and among o∣thers, let us touch these following,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The final period of the Metalline Image set forth by Visions in the Book of</HI> Daniel.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The downfall of Antichrist after the ex∣piration of his 1260 years, now at the doors.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Miracles in Scripture.</HEAD>
<P>HAving Treated some what of the infal∣lible Prophecies, I shall now by the Grace of God rehearse some of the notable Miracles mentioned in Holy Scripture. For as much as they are works above the power of nature, therefore all Nations stand ga∣zing at such mighty exhibitions of Gods Majesty; such as curing blind-born Persons, the restoring the dumb and lame, who were so afflicted from the Mothers Womb, yea, reviving of many from death to life: are they not undeniable Testimonies, that such a one that performs these, is a God, or transacted by the immediate assistance and presence of God? whence we may very well infer, that what such a one speaks is to be embraced as by divine Authority. For that glorious Person, that manifests in his works such heavenly and coelestial power, must be believed to be God, and a God of supream Truth and highest verity, as well as of surpassing power. For infinite power and truth are and can be centerd no where but in a God.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="000429_0041_0FA5B0BB8E932BB0"/>
Let us then recite some of the noble works of God mentioned in the divine Pa∣ges; that shewed themselves both before, and attended the promulgation of the Law and Gospel, which transcended all the po∣wers of nature and of Angelical Spirits to produce: altho evil Spirits have ever la∣boured to imitate God, and set up a chappel of Miracles to oppose the glory of his Ma∣jesty, and of the holy Prophets, and of the Son of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. The first that offers, is the destructi∣on of <HI>Sodom</HI> by fire from Heaven, menti∣oned by <HI>Strabo, Pliny, Solinu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Mela</HI> and <HI>Diodorus-Siculus;</HI> naming also the two chief Cities, <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gommorrah,</HI> that perished in their flames, and that the place where they stood being turned into a most dismal lake, called <HI>Asphaltites</HI> from Brim∣stone or Bitumen, wherewith it abounds. They speak also of the Aples that grow near it, which seem ripe and pleasant, but being toucht, crumble into dust.</P>
<P>Two things I would here call to mind:</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Holy Scriptures set forth <HI>Hell</HI> by this Lake of fire and brimstone in several places. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sa:</HI> 30: 33: <HI>Mark</HI> 9: 45: <HI>Rev:</HI> 14: 10: <HI>&amp;</HI> 19, 20, <HI>&amp;c</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. That a Gentleman, one Mr. S<HI>teel,</HI> who with some young Merchants visited those places, and bestowed upon me a Glass of the water of that Sea, and a Cup made of to Cedar of <HI>Lebanon:</HI> relate in a small Treatise of several things which
<PB N="25" REF="000429_0042_0FA5B0BD12014890"/>
they saw in the Holy Land, and particular∣ly, that the <HI>rudera</HI> or <HI>Piles</HI> of some Build∣ings began to shew their heads visible a∣bove water, which are judged to be rem∣nants of <HI>Sodom</HI> &amp;c; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ezek</HI> 16: 53, 55</NOTE> and that put me in mind of a remarkable Scripture about the re∣turn of <HI>Sodom</HI> and her Daughters or Vil∣lages in the latter day, at the reduction of <HI>Israel</HI> to their own Land; and that the waters of the Sanctuary shall cure the dead Sea, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ezek</HI> 47: 10</NOTE> from <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngedi</HI> to <HI>Eneglaim</HI> or <HI>Gal∣li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in <HI>Moab:</HI> But I leave it to the Conside∣ration of the Learned.</P>
<P N="2">2. The second Instance may be of <HI>Israels</HI> coming out of <HI>Egypt</HI> by the power of Gods out-stretched arm, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Joseph in E∣gypt, see Justi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 1: 36: <HI>c:</HI> 2:</NOTE> with many Miracles pre∣paring and attending their exit Some things to this purpose are mentioned by the Compilator of <HI>Trogus Pompeius,</HI> L. 36. and by <HI>Manetho</HI> in <HI>Josephus;</HI> which tho some would draw to another time, yet the set∣tling of those that are there said to come out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> seems to shew it Nay, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plin: l:</HI> 30: <HI>c:</HI> 1: <HI>de prepar: l:</HI> 9: <HI>c:</HI> 8: <HI>Apulejus: Apol: p</HI> 54:</NOTE> the very <HI>Magicians</HI> that conten∣ded with <HI>Moses</HI> are remembred by <HI>pliny,</HI> under the names of <HI>Jannes</HI> and <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apata,</HI> and by <HI>Eumenius</HI> in <HI>Eusebius,</HI> and by <HI>Diodorus, Siculus</HI> in <HI>Photius,</HI> L. 40. taken notice of by the Learned Bp. <HI>Usher</HI> in his <HI>Annals.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The third may be the Conquest of <HI>Canaan</HI> by <HI>Joshua,</HI> whom some recount for the <HI>Hercules</HI> of the ancients, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hercules Ty∣rius in Lucian de Deam syria p:</HI> 1036:</NOTE> and a remem∣brance of his victory, graven on a Pillar by the <HI>Phaenicians</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> shewing that they fled from the face of <HI>Joshua</HI> into that Coun∣trey
<PB N="26" REF="000429_0043_0FA5B0BDCDFAA4D0"/>
where their Brethren of the Race of <HI>Cham</HI> of near alliance to the <HI>Canaanites</HI> then lived; which is toucht as I remember by <HI>Procopius</HI> in his <HI>Vandalick</HI> Wars &amp; o∣thers. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Procop</HI></NOTE> The standing still of the Sun seems hinted at by <HI>Plautus</HI> in the double day, I think in his <HI>Amphilryo.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The fourth wonder may refer to the retrocession or going back of the Sun in the dayes of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> which engaged the King of <HI>Babylon</HI> to send an Embassy on pur∣pose to search out the truth of that Prodigy. In reference to which, this is remarkable, that some Eclipses mentioned to have hap∣pened before <HI>Hezekiahs</HI> dayes, are all found by our modern Astronomical Tables, as exact; as if those Prodigies had not been extant: which may give to some a little more facile apprehension of the motion of the earth, then the Perepatetick School will a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yet admit. For the Phoenomenon or ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earance may be solved by a miracu∣lous stopping of the Earths diurnal motion, though its annual in the Zodiack might continue.</P>
<P N="5">5. The fifth concerns that extraordinary Star, which a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>peared at the Birth of our Lord to the <HI>Magi</HI> in <HI>Kedemah</HI> or the East by the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat:</HI> 2: 2:</NOTE> who came <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> from <HI>Jobs</HI> East Countrey, where∣of before, and which presaged as they thought in those dayes the rising of some Grand Emperor out of some Eastern Na∣tion: whereof <HI>Suetonius</HI> speads <HI>[Percrebuit in toto oriente,</HI> &amp;c.] that there was a pre∣sage
<PB N="27" REF="000429_0044_0FA5B0BF666A07B8"/>
of one that should Rule the whole World; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>sueton in Ves∣pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c:</HI> 4: <HI>&amp; Tacittbist:</HI> 1: 3: <HI>[pluribus per∣suasio intrat &amp;c.</HI></NOTE> which they applied to <HI>Vespasian</HI> but more truly concerned our blessed Lord, whose kingdom was to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>niversal and eternal.</P>
<P>There is a passage also about <HI>Hero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> at this time, which tho no miracle, yet it was prodigy of cruelty, which that infamous Prince perpetrated in the Land of <HI>Judah;</HI> and herein may somewhat concern this Treatise, that it sets the time of the Epi∣phany or coming of the Magi or wise men to our Lord, a little before that Lunar E∣clipse in <HI>March,</HI> which preceded that Ty∣rants death; who flew so many innocent children, and his own son among the rest, that gave occasion to the Emperor <HI>Augustus</HI> to taunt him with that Scoff, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Macrob: sat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> 1: 2: <HI>c</HI> 4:</NOTE> that he had rather be <HI>Herods</HI> Hog than hi<HI>s</HI> son, count∣ing him for a Jew (and I think he was a proselyte) tho indeed he were an <HI>Idu∣mean</HI> of <HI>Ascalon</HI> by birth, that is of that <HI>Idumaea</HI> or <HI>Edom</HI> so called in the days of our Lord, as may be observed in <HI>Ptolomies greek</HI> Geography, lying in the south-part of <HI>Ju∣dah.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. But the most remarkable miracle was that of the <HI>S</HI>uns Eclipse at our blessed Lords passion, because it disappeared, and was mantled with pitchy darkness near the Full-Moon of the Passover, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>paul Diacon: max: in scholl: ad Diony<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Orig∣tract:</HI> 29, <HI>&amp;</HI> 30: <HI>in mat: Euseb e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lit: scaltaustin: Eph:</HI> 156:</NOTE> which is impos∣sible in the course of nature.

like points, as <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen, Justin Martyr, Lactantius Arnobius, Eusebius,</HI> &amp;c. who have distinctly written against the Gentiles with the Pen of a Diamond, and abundantly refell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d their Errors and So∣phistries setting forth the great and mighty acts of holy men of old, attesting the Tacred Doctrines: Yea so great was the conviction of the stupendious works of our blessed <HI>Messiah,</HI> the Wonderful, the <HI>Counsellor</HI> upon the Spirit of the Emperour <HI>Tiberius:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isai</HI> 9 6. <HI>Fuseb ex Ter∣tul. l</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 2.</NOTE> that he strongly urged the Se∣nate of <HI>Rome</HI> to recognize him for God.

<P>But yet, these mighty works forespoken of, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isai.</HI> 6. 10.</NOTE> tho they doe not, nor can of themselves directly cause true Faith in the heart, with∣out the Almighty power of God (else why did not the gross-hearted Jews believe) yet are they a strong Foundation for Faith to insist upon, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dan.</HI> 10. 21.</NOTE> and to induce the belief of the Divinity of that person who is the ori∣ginal Revealer and Deliverer of these Scri∣ptures. of truth to the World.

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Consignation of the Canon.</HEAD>
<P>HAving by many Arguments (I hope) demonstrated the Sacred Authority of those inestimable volumes of Scripture: There yet remains an enquiry about the finishing of the Canon, or the compass of all the Books that are of Divine stamp and original. Those two great Luminaries of the <HI>English Nation,</HI> Dr. <HI>John Rainolds</HI> of <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI> and Dr. <HI>William Whitaker</HI> of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> have largely and solidly handled thi<HI>s</HI> Point against the <HI>Romanists</HI> which the Learned know better than I: But since that some∣what on this Subject may not be ungrate∣ful or unuseful to many: give leave to treat a little upon it in this Section, and so con∣clude this first Chapter,</P>
<P>It is then the Sentiment of several of the Antients in the primitive times, that the
<PB N="32" REF="000429_0049_0FA5B0C5A538A408"/>
holy Apostles of the Lord did consign or state the Canon of Scripture, and it hath obtained among many of the Learned for an indub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>table truth, of which Testimonies I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> recite some to that purpose.</P>
<P>The first whereof is <HI>Melito</HI> Bishop of <HI>Sardis</HI> about the Year 170. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A.</HI> 170 <HI>Euseb. l.</HI> 4 <HI>c.</HI> 25</NOTE> so saves <HI>Euse∣bius,</HI> attesting that he set out the Canon of the Old Testament, just as we do, omitting the <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> for which purpose he Tra∣velled into the East to gain full intelligence. <HI>Athanasius</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI> sets down the same Catalogue, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A.</HI> 340</NOTE> as <HI>Rainold de Apocryphis, Vol.</HI> 1.

<PB N="33" REF="000429_0050_0FA5B0C6D93FA368"/>
<HI>John</HI> did see the Visions, and compose the Book of the <HI>Revelations</HI> of what he saw in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mos</HI> (now <HI>Patina</HI> in the <HI>Fgaean Sea.</HI>) And to the same purpose it is attested by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> lib. 5. towards the end, and by <HI>Eu∣sebius, l.</HI> 4. <HI>c.</HI> 18.</P>
<P>Furthermore, <HI>Austin</HI> who a little survi∣ved <HI>Jerom,</HI> in his Book against <HI>Faustus</HI> [<HI>Ex∣cellentia canonicae autoritatis veteris &amp; novi Testamenti, &amp;c. Apostolorum confirmata tem∣porious &amp;c.</HI>] and again, <HI>[Nemodare pote<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> authoritatem cuiquam libro, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>August. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Faustuns. l.</HI> 11 c. 5.

<P>Again, when treating of the <HI>C</HI>anon, he sayes, we should follow the authority of those <HI>C</HI>hurches <HI>[Quae Apostolicas sedes ba∣here &amp; Epistolas accipere merueru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t]</HI> which were dignified by the presence of the Apo∣stles, and received Epistles from them. And such was the <HI>C</HI>hurch of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> whose <HI>C</HI>anon is above-cited.</P>
<P>There is moreover a famous quotation out of <HI>Eusebius,</HI> mentioned by Dr. <HI>Couzins</HI> in his History of the <HI>C</HI>anon, where he brings the ancients asserting, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 32 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd</HI> 4 to. 1657</NOTE> that the Apo∣stle <HI>John (rogatu)</HI> at the request of the <HI>Asian</HI> Churches did fix the genuine canon
<PB N="34" REF="000429_0051_0FA5B0C79570D4A0"/>
of Scripture: and adds <HI>Eusebius</HI> to it. This is in the margin, but in text of his discourse, <HI>c.</HI> 4. 647. thus. [Before Saint <HI>John</HI> dyed, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o dyed last of all the Apo∣stles, the Canon of Scripture was made perfect, and delivered over to the Christi∣an Church.] What a happy p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n had he used and blest the <HI>C</HI>hurch with an excellent discovery, had he quoted the chapter and book out of <HI>Eusebius,</HI> if the words cited were really there. But upon most diligent search, I could never yet find it in that Au∣thor, tho I have read him over (but pardon my saying so) in some places, but especi∣ally the recited, over and over. <HI>I</HI>f there be any mistake in my search, how glad to see it rectified and how thankful: But I fear otherwise, and rather suppose either he had some other Copy or Manuscript, or else the mistaken citation must refer to the writing of his Gospel, and not the consigning the Canon. For indeed the A∣postle did compile his Gospel <HI>[Rogatus ab Asiae Episcopis]</HI> at the desire of the Bi∣shops of A<HI>sia,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb. l.</HI> 4. 5. 18 <HI>&amp;</HI> l. 5. <HI>c.</HI> 6. <HI>Ironaeus. l.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>c</HI> 1. <HI>&amp; l.</HI> 5. <HI>justin. mart heronim. in catalogo ut magdeb. cent.</HI> 1. <HI>l</HI> 2. <HI>c</HI> 10. <HI>p</HI> 569. <HI>&amp; l</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 4. <HI>p.</HI> 67.</NOTE> as <HI>Eusebius</HI> and J<HI>erom</HI> and others relate, that's very true. Now tho some hence would deem that his Gospel was the last book of Scripture written by any Apostle, yet I rather understand it, as I said before, that he was the last that wrote any Gospel of the life and acts of our blessed Lord. For so the words of <HI>Jerom</HI> imports [<HI>novissimus omnium, &amp;c.</HI> he was the last of all that wrote any <HI>G</HI>ospel History, not that he [<HI>novissimum librum no∣vi Testamenti conscripsit</HI>] wrote the last book of the Testament, that cannot be
<PB N="35" REF="000429_0052_0FA5B0C853D6B088"/>
fetcht ont of these words of <HI>Jerom,</HI> but is a force put upon them. From whence they would seem to draw, that if his Gos∣pel were the last book written; then he thereby consigned the Canon of the whole Scripture: But the former not being clear from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se words, (that because he was the last that writ a Gospel, that therefore the Gospel was the last book of Scripture that was written by any Apostle) that's not consequent. But if we can clear that the Gospel of <HI>John</HI> was the last book of holy Scripture, that ever was written by the appointment of God, it were to pur∣pose indeed, that the Canon were sealed up by it. But if the Revelations should prove to be the last book written by com∣mand of the Spirit, and pen'd at the de∣sire of the <HI>Asian</HI> Churches, according to his visions in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atmus,</HI> then it must be <HI>Si∣gillum Canonis,</HI> the finisher of the holy ca∣non. Put this as yet I cannot certainly find, and therefore at present must acqui∣esce. Yet as to this Revelation book, there being of old much debate, it was at last determined among the Heresies to question its Authority: now its being so late received, it seems to imply, that it was the latest penned.</P>
<P>Whatsoever hath been hitherto said, I rather incline to think, that this great work was not concredited to Angels, or any ho∣ly men, or Primitive Churches at first, but performed by the Majestical Authority, the <HI>L</HI>ord and King of his Church, and that he himself in his own person commanded the
<PB N="36" REF="000429_0053_0FA5B0C9096A89A8"/>
sealing of the Canon to his Servant <HI>John</HI> from heaven, in the close of the Revelati∣on-book; however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> comes to pass, that we have not as yet this testimony of <HI>John,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mally set down by any Ecclesiastick Wri∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Primitive Times, that I have had the happiness to peruse: happy they that shall produce it, authentick, just and true. But it seems to me that our Lord himself performed this work, when he added those direful and fearful curse<HI>s</HI> to fall upon any that dare to add or diminish from it: which look<HI>s</HI> like a sanction of heavenly Majesty, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pro.</HI> 22: 18, 19</NOTE> not only pronouncing that particular Pro∣phecy, but as extensive to the whole Bi∣ble: since it was foretold by <HI>Daniel,</HI> that the Messiah should not only suffer for transgression, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dan:</HI> 9: 24: <HI>Grasserus</HI></NOTE> but also seal up vision and Prophecy. Which I well know may be construed in reference to all the ancient visions concentring in him: but the phrase may comprehend also his sealing and de∣termining and putting an end to all visi∣ons and prophecies, after which there should come no more; he being the great <HI>P</HI>rophet of his <HI>C</HI>hurch, and his holy Spi∣rit the great dictator of Scripture.</P>
<P>This I humbly take to be the full final and utmost period of all Scriptures, accor∣ding to the foretelling of D<HI>aniel,</HI> and the practical consignation by our Lord himself, and therefore needs no further authority. Whether then this or the <HI>G</HI>ospel were writ∣ten last, it matters not so much as to the signing of the Canon, but since the Apostles in their times did attest it, and the primi∣tive
<PB N="37" REF="000429_0054_0FA5B0CA0743D148"/>
churches worshipped and walked by its light, and that ever since by some no∣table providence it hath stood in the rear of the Canon in all ages: we have received it in connexion with the other holy Scrip∣tures, as the complex or body of Divine Truths let down from heaven, and there∣in as <HI>Tertullian</HI> expresses it, we adore the fullness of the Scriptures. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom</HI> 3 2 1 <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> 3 10 2 <HI>Pet</HI> 1. 21.</NOTE></P>
<P>To draw toward an upshot, since we find the Scriptures of the Old Testament, cited in the New, a<HI>s</HI> the Oracles of God and thereby made authentical by the <HI>S</HI>pirit of God, assuring us that the Prophets of old time spake as moved by the Holy Ghost, and what they wrote was received by the Jewish <HI>C</HI>hurch, which is dignified with that honour to be the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or the keepers of the divine law: since also that the <HI>New</HI> Testament is confirmed by divine miracles and oracles, and the attestation of our Lord himself in the close of the Reve∣lations; what remains but to conclude, that they are of heavenly original, and have supremacy in and over the Church, and o∣ver the whole world, as the rule of life, and are as a star shining in a dark place, direc∣ting us in the path to eternal life. What∣ever the <HI>Romanists</HI> talk of their Church, or any other of the Patriarchal Seats, especi∣ally <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and <HI>Antioch,</HI> where we are sure that <HI>Peter</HI> sat: yet the Church can give no Authority to Scripture<HI>s,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 20.</NOTE> but com∣mendatory and all else i<HI>s</HI> but Sophism. For the Church is built upon the doctrine of the holy Apostles and Prophets. So
<PB N="38" REF="000429_0055_0FA5B0CB969BC010"/>
that altho at first we receive the scriptures in and from the ministry of Christ in his church. Yet as <HI>Austins</HI> saying to this point may be glossed, [The whole Authority, both for Ministers to preach, and churches to act, is deduced only from the holy scri∣ptures, so that the <HI>C</HI>hurches of <HI>C</HI>hrist ought to do nothing in doctrine worship or man∣ners, but a<HI>s</HI> the holy scriptures are their best, their unerring and most authentick guide.</P>
<P>There rests yet a small objection before I conclude this chapter, which is, that is citations in the new (as I said above) do ratifie the Old: then the <HI>S</HI>eptuagint tran∣slation should receive a higher character than the Hebrew, because in some places its cited when differing from the Hebrew, Then <HI>Aratus</HI> being cited in the <HI>Acts</HI> and <HI>Me∣nander</HI> in the <HI>Corinths,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 17. 28 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 15 22. <HI>Tit</HI>1 12</NOTE> and <HI>Epimenides,</HI> in <HI>Ti∣tus,</HI> are all authorized by the <HI>A</HI>postles.</P>
<P>I answer, That the Septuagint Greek is cited only as a Translation: which by won∣derful providence was composed at the com∣mand of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> to prepate the Grecian <HI>G</HI>entiles for receiving the Gospel. But I must not enlarge.</P>
<P>As to the heathen authors, <HI>Aratus</HI> and <HI>Epimenices</HI> are urged <HI>ad bominem,</HI> as argu∣ments from their own Prophets to convince them of some heathenish follies and impie∣ties. <HI>A</HI>s for <HI>Menander,</HI> he is cited as the learned judg in answer to <HI>Anacreon</HI> in the 32 verse of his atheistical rhyme: much
<PB N="39" REF="000429_0056_0FA5B0CC11D3EF30"/>
like <HI>Horace</HI> and other Epicurean Ballad ma∣kers: who often push at one another with scoffs and jeers. Nay far better men then they some of the good fathers of the pri∣mitive times in the Apologies made in <HI>defence</HI> of the christian-church bring in multi∣tudes of Testimonies out of <HI>H</HI>eathen wri∣ters against their Pagan Idolatries, Su∣perstitions, Atheisms, Persecutions, and the va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> boasts of the antiquity of their shamefull dunghil Deities, which matter i<HI>s</HI> obvious in the writings of <HI>Origen</HI> against <HI>Celsus, Clemens Alexandrinus,</HI> in his <HI>stro∣mata; Minutius Falix, Arnobins</HI> against the Gentiles, <HI>Austin</HI> in his book of the city of <HI>G</HI>od and Learned <HI>Jer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> in many of his E∣pistles and commentaries.</P>
<P><HI>Let us then determine this point from what proceeds in the arguments assumed from Oracles and Miracles,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gelas Cizen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hist Nice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> council,</HI></NOTE> <HI>nnd many other grounds briefly touched above, that they are the very Word of God, but particularly by their converting pow∣er upon the Soul, commanding reverence, and trembling and horror into the conscience both of men and</HI> D<HI>evils: as they did upon the</HI> S<HI>pirit of that Petulant Philosopher in the council of Nice. Nay, so terrible is the weight of these Truths upon the Souls of some fleering atheists that they are forced sometimes to</HI> Hobbianize, <HI>that is, tremble to be in the dark, as he did at the Lord of</HI> Devonshires <HI>being afraid to walk abroad without Mastiffs or Pistols, and how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch more was be appaled at the approach of death.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas on the other side, how often
<PB N="38" REF="000429_0057_0FA5B0CCEBDB2470"/>
have we seen with joy and delight, this blessed Word of God to have comforted many a soul in the greatest conflicts and agonies of death, whence it follows, that these effect<HI>s</HI> must be the issue of divine power, &amp; that these writings are indeed the very Word of the holy God: since no other books or preachings do or can so rouze and startle the proud conscience of man. In∣somuch, that e<HI>l</HI>se we might justly wonder what the man ails that is so tormented, his heart raging like the troubled Sea, till the Allablaster box of fragrant oyntment be o∣pened out of the promises, and the balsome when poured into a scalded and wounded spirit, immediately asswages its pain, and sink<HI>s</HI> the blisters: which all the Divines and holy Orators in the world could never do, till the presence of <HI>G</HI>od stampt idea's of mercy and comfort, speaking peace to the Soul. Whence we may sweetly in∣fer, that no other books can be received with any powerful convictive authority: but wherein they agree with the tenor and canon of holy Scriptures: so that who∣ever walks according to this rule, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al.</HI> 6. 16.</NOTE> peace shall be on him, &amp; mercy as on the <HI>Israel</HI> of God.</P>
<P>I shall then finish this first <HI>C</HI>hapter with that inference, for which those mediums were brought. That since Faith in <HI>C</HI>hrist Jesus is the very scope and design, the very sum and substance of the whole Scripture: it follows, that the acting of Faith upon them (as the <HI>Doctrinal Object</HI> of such divine original) is grounded on the holiness and
<PB N="39" REF="000429_0058_0FA5B0D0ECF02E50"/>
truth of the omnipotent and eternal God. Wherein it is impossible for him to deceive us in not fulfilling his gracious promises, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb.</HI> 6. 18</NOTE> to humble contrite and broken spirits, that trust in hi<HI>s</HI> mercy.</P>
<P>In like manner, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 20</NOTE> the acting of our Faith on the Lord Jesus as its <HI>personal object</HI> for our Justification, is built on the foundation of the holy Apostles and Prophets, <HI>C</HI>hrist himself being the chief corner-stone, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 87. 1</NOTE> laid by the Father in the holy mountains.</P>
<P>Whoever then believes not God on his Word and Promise makes him a Lyar as far as in his power: <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5. 10.</NOTE> which every one should <HI>Tremble</HI> to think on, because they believe not the record, that God hath gi∣ven of his Son. Which pertinently leads me into the second chapter, about the Deity of our blessed Lord, the natural and eternal <HI>S</HI>on of God. Which, Doctrine being e∣victed and manifested, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a most sure ground for Faith to erect the Temple of Glory, and will secure our tenure of <HI>S</HI>alva∣tion inviolable, like a House built upon the Rock of Ages, that will endure to all Eter∣nity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Deity of Christ.</HEAD>
<P>To Prove the Doctrines of <HI>C</HI>hrist to be true and perfect, we must de∣monstrate his person to be infallible, and to prove his sufferings to be satisfactory to Divine Justice, there must be an infinite value in that glorious person, who was graciously pleased to suffer for the sins of the Elect. If this be clear, then Faith builds upon a Foundation as firm as the Being, Fidelity and <HI>C</HI>onstancy, of a holy and gracious God: This can't be better fixed, but by manifesting the Deity of <HI>C</HI>hrist in the glorious Messiah, who appeared upon Earth in the daye<HI>s</HI> of <HI>Augustus Caesar.</HI> Now if <HI>C</HI>hrist be God, even the natural <HI>S</HI>on of God, then the most precious Blood of his sufferings by communication of idioms or
<PB N="43" REF="000429_0060_0FA5B0D2D6389940"/>
properties between the two natures may be called the blood of God, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 20. 28. Heb 1. 3 &amp; 9. 12. Rev. 1. 5, 8 <HI>Hornbeck, Ma∣reius, Calovi∣us, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE> as it is in the Holy <HI>S</HI>criptures.</P>
<P>For the Proof of the Deity of <HI>C</HI>hrist, I intend no great Enlargement, but refer to those who write directly against the <HI>Socini∣an Heresie:</HI> it concerns us only to argue a little upon this point, and deduce some intermixed consequencies.</P>
<P>As to this great <HI>S</HI>ubject, having already accounted for the Divinity of the <HI>S</HI>criptures we may now take leave to use them as Te∣stimonies sent from heaven, and left upon Record in the <HI>C</HI>hurch to prove this Truth. On which very score, its commonly recei∣ved from the Antients, that the Apostle <HI>John</HI> wrote his Gospel against <HI>Cerinthus,</HI> and other primitive Hereticks, by the insti∣gation of the <HI>Asian C</HI>hurches. But most certainly by the inspiration of the spirit of God. After him <HI>Athanasius</HI> of <HI>Egypt, Hillary</HI> of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Fulgentius</HI> of <HI>Africa,</HI> and several others have largly and nervous∣ly handled the sword of the spirit against the <HI>Arians.</HI> Let us however touch a few arguments in the case.</P>
<P N="1">1. The first argument may be taken from the Eternity of Christ, no <HI>B</HI>eing can be eternal, but must be God. Our Lord was in <HI>B</HI>eing from all Eternity, and there∣fore must needs be God: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Joh:</HI> 17. 5.</NOTE> he had a glory with the Father before the world was, but let us joyn it with eternal sonship, and in∣fer, that if he were the eternal son of God
<PB N="44" REF="000429_0061_0FA5B0D3A04C7E60"/>
then he must be true <HI>G</HI>od in Essence, for he must be every way the character of his Hypostasis, or as we translate it, the express image of his Person. This Argu∣ment of Christs being God, because he was the eternal son of God. The <HI>Jews</HI> very well understood its force, and therefore presently argued against him of Blasphemy in assuming the honour of being God. For to be the eternal Son of God, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>John</HI> 5. 18.</NOTE> he must be coessential with God: which confession that Christ was the <HI>S</HI>on of God; he required of all his Disciples, and it must be understood of his eternal Being, and not as <HI>Adam</HI> is called a <HI>S</HI>on of God: be∣cause he urges the <HI>Jews</HI> with his works, and such as none can produce but a God, such as the Father performed; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mark</HI> 1. 24. 5, 7. <HI>Luk.</HI> 4. 84. 8, 28. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aert in Thalete</HI></NOTE> whereof more by and by. The Devils themselves do own this point, and yet how many blind nominal Christians are there who have not attained the knowledg of <HI>Thales,</HI> who calls him the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> if cited right. And yet our dayes find some who bear the Name of Christ, but blas∣pheme his nature, and speak boldly against this grand Fundamental of Christianity: such as the <HI>Socinians</HI> and many Quakers, poor wretches perverted by cunning sophis∣ters, that pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad against the only true means of their own salvation, and return again to the Old Covenant of works. Whereas the scripture is both evident and copious<HI>s</HI> in the case. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prov.</HI> 2. 23.</NOTE> A<HI>s</HI> that of Wisdom: (<HI>I was set up from Everlasting, &amp;c.</HI>) which must be expounded of a person from that of

He it is that lay in the bosom of God, and came down from Heaven, being the same that ascended up again. He it is, that was before <HI>Abraham, That was, and is, and is to come,</HI> the Almigh∣ty: That was in the beginnning, and had his glorious Being before ever the World was, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isai.</HI> 57. 15 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 16</NOTE> as the Ancients truly expound that phrase. Now what can be before the World began, but Eternity, wherein God inhabits. This person was God manifest in the flesh, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ob.</HI> 1. 14.</NOTE> and therefore God before his manifestation on Earth: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb.</HI> 1. 8.</NOTE> when he vailed his glory within the Tabernacle of his sa∣cred flesh. Moreover if God the Father call Christ God as he does [<HI>Thy Throne O God is for ever and ever</HI>] His Glory then must be coequal with the Fathers, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Phil.</HI> 2. 6.</NOTE> before the World began, he esteeming it no robbery to be equal with God. Yea as God in uni∣ty of Essence, he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>the blessed and only Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</HI> Which Name and Stile is applied to him by the Apostle <HI>John,</HI> and seen by him as written in his vesture upon his thigh, adding, that he was the <HI>Alobs</HI> and <HI>Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and last.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 19. 16. 22 23</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. Hence flows the Doctrine of the unity of Christ the Son of God, with the Father in the same Divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ence, &amp; therefore the
<PB N="46" REF="000429_0063_0FA5B0D508F964D0"/>
the Father calls him his <HI>Fellow</HI> in <HI>Zechary,</HI> and some observe concerning that passage in <HI>Isaiah [Smitten of God and afflicted</HI>] that [<HI>OF</HI>] the note of the <HI>Genitive,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Zech</HI> 13. 7. <HI>Isai</HI> 53 4.</NOTE> is not in the <HI>Hebrew:</HI> and therefore construed from the <HI>Hebrew [A smitten God</HI>] equivalent to that in the New Testament, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Act.</HI> 20. 28.</NOTE> where the pre∣cious blood of Christ is called the blood of God, as abovesaid: yet others affecting not this reading in <HI>Isaiah,</HI> I shall not contest it at presen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>: but as to his unity, there be many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> places, wherein our Lord determines it, that he and the Father are one, and had the same essential glory to∣gether from eternity. For speaking of the manutenency and protection of his sheep from perishing, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Job.</HI> 10. 30. <HI>&amp;</HI> 17. 11, 21, 22, 23.</NOTE> he declare<HI>s</HI> himself one with the Father that gave them to him: where∣upon the Jews being clear in the Argument took up stones again to destroy him as a Blasphemer, in that he made himself one with God.</P>
<P N="4">4. Again, He that is Omniscient and knows our thoughts by his own discerning eve and power, must needs be God. As <HI>Solomon</HI> spake to the Lord in Prayer: <HI>Thou only knowest the heart of the Children of men.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Chron.</HI> 6. 30. <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 23. <HI>Mat.</HI> 9. 4. 12, 25. <HI>Luk.</HI> 5. 22. <HI>&amp;</HI> 6 8. <HI>&amp;</HI> 9. 47. <HI>&amp;</HI> 11. 17.</NOTE> Now our Saviour expresly assumes it to himself; that he searcheth the Reins and the heart, and tis often expressed, that our Lord knew the thoughts both of his Disci∣ples and his enemies as may be observed in the Scripture. Nay, he perceived when thoughts did but arise in their hearts: much like that of <HI>David, Thou understandest my</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="000429_0064_0FA5B0D81F5B0210"/>
thoughts afar off, which demonstrates an Omniscient Deity, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luk.</HI> 24. 38. <HI>Psal.</HI> 139. 2. <HI>Heb.</HI> 4. 12, 13.</NOTE> &amp; this our Lord did not discern as to one of his Disciples only but of several at once. So that this essential word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, and all things are na∣ked and open before him, and no creature but is manifest in his sight, which must needs follow, because he is the <HI>C</HI>reator of all: which brings in the fifth;</P>
<P N="5">5. Another conviction of this glorious Truth of <HI>C</HI>hrists Deity is drawn from his Omnipotency. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Job</HI> 1. 3.</NOTE> For all things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was made: which action of creating must needs be invested in the infinite power of his Essence, whom we have before proved to be the Eternal <HI>G</HI>od; &amp; had the same glory with God the Father before the World, was, praying further that his humanity now assu∣med into unity with the second person might be dignified with the same glory. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>John</HI> 17. 5 <HI>Col.</HI> 1. 16.</NOTE> This great truth is confirmed by the great Apo∣stle <HI>[By him were all things created in Hea∣ven and Earth, even the Angels, those glorious Spirits were formed by him, and for him, that is for his glory and service,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 4. 11. <HI>Heb.</HI> 1. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>and to sing his praises.</HI> But to end, its spoken by God the Father to Christ [<HI>Thou Lord in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the Earth, and the Heavens are the work of thy hands.</HI></P>
<P>Yet further,</P>
<P N="6">6. As Christ made the World, it must needs follow, that he also governs it: some∣times immediately by himself, sometimes by
<PB N="48" REF="000429_0065_0FA5B0D9B1E481B8"/>
the ministration of Angels, and as to the <HI>C</HI>hurch by his own Spirits. Thence is he sti∣led King of Kings, King of Nations, and King of Saints. The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> asserts him to be before all things in his eternal Es∣sence, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Col</HI> 1 17</NOTE> and that by him all things to consist, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb.</HI> 1. 3.</NOTE> have the continuation of their Beings, Lives and Motion<HI>s.</HI> Yea, it is he, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> beareth, supporteth and upholdeth all things by the word of his power. He spake the word and they were made, and he speaks and ordains the time, method and means of their continuance.</P>
<P N="7">7. Besides, as he maintains and preserves the world in its being, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luk.</HI> 24. 19. <HI>Job</HI> 2. 11. <HI>&amp;</HI> 11. 4. <HI>&amp;</HI> 6. 54. <HI>&amp;</HI> 5. 21. <HI>&amp;</HI> 1: 14:</NOTE> so likewise, beyond the ordinary course of nature, in the time of his Incarnation, he wrought all those mighty Miracles by his own divine power. Whereby he manifested his own Glory, that is, of his Deity. As in turning Water into Wine at <HI>Cans,</HI> and in raising of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> he was glorified to be the Son of God: Therefore the Apostle <HI>John</HI> from that and many other cases, of raising the dead, &amp;c. might well affirm, that he had seen his glory, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Job</HI> 5 17 &amp; 15: 24: <HI>&amp;</HI> 10 18.</NOTE> even in the transfiguration, <HI>as of the only begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth.</HI> Till the incarnation or rather the beginning of his Ministry the Father wrought; But now (sayes he) <HI>I Work.</HI> He laid down the life of his Hu∣manity, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb:</HI> 1: <HI>Rom:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: 4: <HI>&amp;C.</HI></NOTE> rose from the dead, ascended into Heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God by his own Divine Power. Tho <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>is true, that some of these things, being some∣times ascribed to God essential, and other∣where
<PB N="49" REF="000429_0066_0FA5B0DB72B746C0"/>
where predicated or affirmed of Christ per∣sonal, do therein unite in the confirmation of his Deity: who performed all these great signs, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5. 13.</NOTE> that we should believe him to be the Son of God.</P>
<P N="8">8. Another Testimony of his glorious Deity is, the pardon of sin. The Phari∣sees saw the force of this Argument, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 9. 3 <HI>Luk</HI> 5. 21</NOTE> and blasphemously ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cht at it, as a great crime, for arrogating to himself the honour which is alone due to the Majesty of God. But our Lord sufficiently knew the dignity of his own person, tho somewhat vailed: yet to the comfort of many a poor sinner, and to their inestimable joy, often (as a God) pro∣nounced the forgiveness of their sins. Nay to shew the union of his humanity with the Deity, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 9. 2, 3. <HI>Act</HI> 5: 31 <HI>Heb:</HI> 1. 3</NOTE> declares that the Son of Man hath po∣wer upon Earth, as well as in Heaven to forgive sins. So the Apostle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> confirming his Godhead over and over in the same Chapter, asserts, that having pur∣ged away our sins by himself, <HI>i. e.</HI> by his blood, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.</P>
<P N="9">9. Again, since contrite sinners do hum∣bly supplicate to God for the pardon of sin: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Job</HI> 14. 13</NOTE> we find him recorded sometimes as the di∣rect and immediate object of Worship both from men and angels. How often do we find him prayed to, and worshipt by his Disciples, and himself accepting all as his due. Now he that receives prayer and answers it to the people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God, and takes into his custody the spirits of dying Saints,
<PB N="50" REF="000429_0067_0FA5B0DC4FE415B0"/>
as he did <HI>Stephen's,</HI> this person must needs be God. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Act:</HI> 7: 59 <HI>Heb:</HI> 1: 6 <HI>Mat:</HI> 8: 27 <HI>Job</HI> 38: 9</NOTE> Nay all the Angels of God are com∣manded to Worship him, at whose word the raging seas hush into their swadling bands, and are quiet like a child sleeping in its cra∣dle: the boisterous winds delight to be still, that they may without noise hear his delicious and heavenly voice with all silence and subjection, and make a halcyon calm from Pole to Pole.</P>
<P N="10">10. But to end: He that is declared to be judg of the World, and to raise all per∣sons out of their Graves by h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s own Imperial command to appear at his righteous Bar, must not that person be God? If he knew not the hearts and thoughts of all and every secret thing from his own Omniscience, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eccl.</HI> 12: 14</NOTE> which thing is an incommunicable attribute of God, he could not be Judg of quick and dead at his appearance and Kingdom. To Judge the World was by the <HI>Pharisees</HI> ac∣knowledged to be the character of a God. <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4: 8:</NOTE> The high Priest therefore hearing this, rents his clothes, and calls it Blasphemy. But why the second person having admitted the humanity into union, and being head of the Church should perform this glorious work, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat:</HI> 26: 65 <HI>Mark</HI> 17: 64</NOTE> depends only upon the Oeconomy of the sacred Trinity: a secret not to be irre∣verently peered into but adored. Lets be wise to Sobriety according to what is writ∣ten and not transcend the limits at the foot of the Mount. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom:</HI> 12: 3</NOTE> But to draw to an is∣sue: He is also constituted Judg of Angels at that great day, they must bow their coe∣lestial knees at his Name, and the evil Spi∣rits

acknowledg this while our Lord was here below, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa:</HI> 45: 23 <HI>Rom:</HI> 14: 10, 11 <HI>Mat:</HI> 8. 29:</NOTE> beseeching him not to torment them before the time. Now it is a work competent alone to a God to torment Spi∣rits All the powers in heaven and earth besides cannot do it of their own vigor and force, unless permitted, influenced, direct∣ed and managed by God in it: and blessed be <HI>G</HI>od for it, that hath reserved the domi∣nion of our spirits to himself alone, as well as of Angels. <HI>B</HI>ut this supremacy was acted by Christ at his pleasure from the in∣nate power of his Deity, when he cast them out as evil and unclean spirits fore a∣gainst their wills, and at their supplication gave them leave to go hither or thither. For they are in adamantine chains, and those chains in his own hand, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Pet:</HI> 2: 4</NOTE> and casts them into hell and looses them when he pleases. There fore he, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev:</HI> 20: 1, 2, 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> who by his own power and autho∣rity in communion with the essential <HI>G</HI>od head doth these great things, must be <HI>G</HI>od blessed for ever, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>I know the <HI>Socinians</HI> talk of their created God, and so would fain evade the dint of Scriptur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s: but that's most perfect non∣sence to assert two <HI>G</HI>ods, and one a created <HI>G</HI>od. For Infinite can be but one: or else hold one to be titular, as <HI>Angels</HI> and <HI>Magi∣strates,</HI> tho in a higher Orb and Order; which yet is inconsistent with the prece∣dent Scriptural Arguments, that prove our blessed Lord to be <HI>G</HI>od in essence, coequal with the Father and Holy Spirit, to whom be glory and dominion for ever and ever.</P>
<P><HI>Now then, since this most excellent person
<PB N="52" REF="000429_0069_0FA5B0DD65F550D0"/>
by vertue of his sufferings in communion with his infinite Deity (tho in it self impassible) hath given full satisfaction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Father for all the sins of Believers, and by whom we receive the attonement,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom:</HI> 3: 21: <HI>&amp;</HI> 5: 21 <HI>Act:</HI> 20: 2</NOTE> even through the merit of his precious blood, and that hereby he is become a personal, particular and immediate Object of our Faith, and that by him we do believe in God the justifier of the ungodly through his righte∣ousness and his alone: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev:</HI> 22 17: <HI>Heb:</HI> 9: 12: <HI>Eph:</HI> 5: 26: <HI>Tit:</HI> 2: 14: 1 <HI>Joh:</HI> 1: 7: 1 <HI>Pet:</HI> 1: 2 <HI>Rev:</HI> 3: 5: <HI>Heb:</HI> 9: 16:</NOTE> and that this glorious person so graciously invites all thirsty sinners to take the water of life freely, and to believe in his Name for the remission of Sins: let us come boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find Grace to help in time of need.</HI></P>
<P>Now let this suffice to have written a∣bout the two great Foundations of Faith.</P>
<P>In the first Chapter concerning the Di∣vinity of the Scripture<HI>s:</HI> And in the second in reference to the Deity of our blessed Lord, which I hope will so satisfie, comfort and erect the Spirits of feeble and stagger∣ing <HI>B</HI>eliever<HI>s,</HI> that they may the more sweetly and firmly lay the stress of their fears in life and death upon thi<HI>s</HI> Rock in Zion: and if they will be but careful and vigilant a<HI>s</HI> to holy walking, and be earnest in Prayer to enjoy the beautiful and Soul∣refreshing influence<HI>s</HI> of the Holy Spirit: They may then walk safely and joyfully through the valley of the shadow of death till they arrive at the mountain of <HI>G</HI>lory.</P>

<P>THe Rise or Origen of this word is from the <HI>Italian Fede,</HI> and that from the <HI>Latine, Fides,</HI> and that as some conceit, from the Greek <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to perswade and that from the Hebrew, <HI>Pethah.

Our English Saxon word [<HI>Believe</HI>] comes from the Dutch, <HI>lieven,</HI> and that as 'tis thought from the old provincial <HI>Latine</HI> among the <HI>Reman Colonies</HI> in those quarters [<HI>Libeo Libet</HI>] to list or consent to a thing with love or liking, and that the word <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> comes from a Teutonick word of the same extract [<HI>Verloff</HI>] which signifies to assent. Now as one of the Ancients says, (<HI>consensio est <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olentis</HI>) consent is the act of a person that is willing: so to believe, is to consent freely and with love to the truth
<PB N="58" REF="000429_0075_0FA5B0E74D10C9A0"/>
of what is spoken, which breeds convicti∣on and satisfaction on the mind of man. Now the inclination of the will to believe, is wrought by God, and if any question, why one is perswaded by God and not a∣nother.: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 119. 36.</NOTE> Let him take his answer from holy <HI>Paul,</HI> that 'tis God that maketh to differ, and O man, who art thou that re∣pliest against <HI>G</HI>od, and if that please not, let the bold fellow go look another: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> 4. 7. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om,</HI> 9, 20.</NOTE> But as <HI>Austin</HI> treats him, <HI>caveat presumprores, &amp;c.</HI> Let him take heed of presuming in curious searches, and determining the my∣steries of grace, and the counsels of God.

But were this Law of God made the Law of <HI>N</HI>ations, his blessing would follow it with more peace and tranquility, then yet the world hath seen.</P>
<P>Well then, as Truth is a most radiant at∣tribute of God, and dwells in his nature, as he is <HI>Ens primum &amp; simplicefrmum,</HI> the eternal and uncompounded Being: And if Angels,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Job.</HI> 4. 18.</NOTE> whom he charges with folly in comparison with himself, do not (<HI>racio∣cinari</HI>) reason by mediums, but act by in∣tuition: how much more does that most abstruse and immense being, the Father of lights, both in his cognition of all things at once, and according to the purpose of his own will, act in expressing and mani∣festing what he pleases to his creatures and shining upon that manifestation with such a glorious ray of truth, that were it not from the darkness of our lapsed estate, we should without any dispute or hesitation im∣mediately imbrace it for the highest and unquestionable verity. Hence it is that in whatever he speaks from his most holy mouth by Oracles or Prophets ratified in their authority from him, must be judged a great presumption and impiety to call for a reason of any of his words or actions by bold and daring, and impudent creatures. For from the raies of truth streaming from the immense and soul-dazling sun of his verity flows all the certainty and stabiliment in the spirits of angels or men, to fix and settle us in our belief and obedience.</P>
<P>Whoever then does believe, sets his seal to the Word that God is true; and he that
<PB N="62" REF="000429_0079_0FA5B0EBCE24BE28"/>
doth not believe, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>John</HI> 3. 33.</NOTE> as far as in him lies, would seem to induce, that the holy and true God, should be a lyar and deceiver, and not to be trusted. Such is the most horrible conse∣quent of unbelief. Though I am well sa∣tisfied, that there are some trembling souls, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lady Thomson late of Osterley: park cut now in heaven.</HI></NOTE> that either from natural timerous tempers or some other dark incidencies upon their spirits do not come up to clear and comfor∣table actings of Faith, &amp; that abhorr the very thoughts of not trusting God upon his word of promise, and are truly gracious at bot∣tom, though cannot discern and know it. As I knew not long since a gracious Person, when discoursing of the work of God upon her heart, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>John</HI> 5. 10. <HI>&amp;</HI> 6. 29.</NOTE> said that she trembled at that Scripture in <HI>John,</HI> of making God a lyar, and that the deep pondring upon it, was the beginning of her conversion One is apt to think, it were a very easy thing to believe the holy God upon his Word: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph.</HI> 1 19: 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 1. 11 <HI>Eph.</HI> 3. 16, 17. 3 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 15.</NOTE> but indeed, renewed and sanctified persons have sound it one of the most difficult works in the whole world, because its contrary to nature, to found our salvation upon anothers righteousness, &amp; therefore needs a miraculous work from God to effect it in us. It's true, that the doctrine of the Gospel is a most faithful say∣ing that is, a most certain and undoubted assertion full of grace and truth, and wor∣thy of all acceptation or embracing (<HI>u∣trique ulnis &amp; in utraque cordis camera</HI>) in our most intimate bosomes: that Christ came into the world to save sinners: But it requires almighty power of the spirit of Christ to bring us to the obedience of faith,
<PB N="63" REF="000429_0080_0FA5B0EC84B39918"/>
But of this more (God granting) in the sequel. Now I'le proceed about some things in the nature of Faith, to which end I may recount that good old saying of <HI>Au∣stin</HI> cited by some <HI>Accipe &amp; signas</HI>) re∣ceive it, that is, believe it, and thou feal∣est to the truth of God. Thus <HI>Sarah</HI> act∣ing by Faith, judged him faithful who had promised, and attained the end of her par∣ticular trust in the case whereunto God had spoken.</P>
<P>But not to dilate in generals, I might proceed to the hononymy of the term, and the various Synonymous expressions of it found in Scripture. I might from fathers and schoolmen, from confessions of the Re∣formed Churches, and their commentaries, common places and Systemes from contro∣versial writings between us and the <HI>Roma∣nists,</HI> and from the many holy practical writers of our own on this very subject, raise a great pile or mass of discourse, and therein but <HI>actum agere,</HI> over and over with the same in some little varieties. But I forbear, since my chief end and scope is principally to erect and comfort broken, languishing spirits, that hang in suspence as it were between the hopes of heaven, and the fears of hell: I would gladly put a Scripture staff (even one of the slaves of the Ark within the Sanctuary) into the hands of every weary and heavy laden soul.</P>
<P>I shall not then be nice or over-curious in handling this point under the distinct heads of definition or description, or in di∣stinguishing it into several sorts, and so

proceed to examine all the causes, effects properties, adjuncts, contraries, and the se∣veral corollaries deducible from all: or the cases of conscience, doubts and objections afflicting troubled spirits; for they are in∣numerable: but only treat upon some par∣ticulars most practical and useful, either past by, or but lightly touched by others. As Doctor <HI>Boodt</HI> that learned Physician, and of great request with the Reverend Bishop <HI>Us<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er,</HI> was more pleased to write [<HI>de af∣fectibus ommisses</HI>] of cases not handled, then to trouble the world with large bodies of Phisick over and over. So should all endeavour not to burden the church of God with swelling discourses, wrought up into a cumbersome Tympany out of others pre∣ceding, who have done worthily in their generations: but should either add <HI>quid no∣vi: or quid noviter,</HI> either something new, that may increase christians knowledg and grace, or after a concise and clear method, that may raise the fancy, tortifie memory, and take with such as are out of the church to help on their conversion. Though I am sensible of my own deficiency, and intreat a candid Reader to pardon what is here done out of a great thirst and desire to cast in some mites for initiated believers, as may help I hope, and add to their faith, or the joy of faith, and supply something of what is yet lacking in the faith of some weaker christians, with whom we converse in Ordinances. Divinity is an Ocean that hath neither shoares nor bottom, there is room enough without envy for every one to spread new Sails, and in continual tra∣vel,

<P>But yet not to prescind and cut off all proper method and genuine handling of this subject.</P>
<P>I shall first set down the true nature and essence of this grace of saving faith, and then proceed to the rest of the chapters in their prescribed order.</P>

worthy Rector of <HI>Lesna,</HI> and university in that Kingdom, sometimes since did ac∣quaint me, that they own it. And after him still sprang up more and more illustri∣ous persons till the restauration from Po∣pery. Since which the doctrines of holy faith derived from Scripture have been set forth by the Reformed in several Na∣tions, and called a Body of confessions prin∣ted in quarto. But to let them pass: I shall for the maine follow that Type of truth which our own teachers have gather∣out of those sacred pages.</P>
<P>In the first place then, the church of <HI>England</HI> having exhibited the main doct∣rines consonant to the holy Scriptures in their Articles, Catechism and Homilies, <HI>I</HI> shall name some particulars to our pur∣pose about Faith.</P>
<P>In the eleventh Article we have this clause: [<HI>That we are justified by faith only, is a most wholsome doctrine, <NOTE PLACE="marg">See Nowels Catechism Homilies edit Lond. 1635. Fol. p. 22. Homily of fal∣vation or justi∣fication) part 1. p. 14.</NOTE> and very full of comfort, as is more largly expressed in the ho∣mily of Justification</HI>] of which more fully in the confession of Faith, and the defence of it by Bishop <HI>Jewel,</HI> some hints see in the Catechism, but especially the Homilies.</P>
<P>In the fourteenth Homily thus; [<HI>Live∣ly Faith is a true trust and confidence of the mercy of God through our Lord Jesus Christ</HI>] and farther, that this [<HI>true and lively faith is not ours, but by Gods working in us.</HI>] and again, P. 17. <HI>'Tis not the act of faith that justifies, that were by some act or vertue, that
<PB N="67" REF="000429_0084_0FA5B0EF96FA33C0"/>
is within our selves, &amp;c:</HI>] and again, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 18. [<HI>By Faith given us of God, we embrace the promise of Gods mercy, and of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emis∣sion of our sins</HI>] and yet still more fully in the third part, p. 20. [<HI>True christian faith is, &amp;c to have a sure trust and confidence in Gods merciful promises to be saved from ever∣lasting damnation by Christ, whereof doth fol∣low a loving heart to obey his Commandments</HI>]</P>
<P>In the little Catechism there are hints to the same purpose, as that in the answer a∣bout Baptism, there is required Faith [<HI>Whereby they stedfastly believe the promises of God</HI>]</P>
<P>But lets proceed to others;</P>
<P>The Assembly of Divines in their Con∣fession of Faith, after some previous Dis∣course about it, expresly thus. [The prin∣cipal act of saving Faith are, accepting, re∣ceiving and resting upon Christ alone for justification, Sanctification, and eternal life, by vertue of the covenant of Grace.] There's also much to the same effect, am∣plified in the larger, and contracted in the shorter Catethism.</P>
<P>The Declaration of the Faith and Order of the Congregational Churches in <HI>En∣gland</HI> met at the <HI>Savoy</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> by the Elders and Messengers, <HI>Octob.</HI> 12. 165<SUP>o</SUP>. ex∣press it in the very same words, <HI>Chap.</HI> 14. <HI>Sect.</HI> 2. <HI>Page</HI> 24. which are before rehearsed out of the confession of the Assembly of Di∣vines at <HI>Westminister.</HI></P>
<P>All these Societies then for substance do most harmoniously agree in the same Do∣ctrine
<PB N="68" REF="000429_0085_0FA5B0F00B264368"/>
of Faith, exclusive of works in the point of Justification. And oh that they would also, once agree to live quietly and peaceably by each other, as becomes Pro∣fessors of the same holy Faith, washt in the same holy Baptism, and called in one hope of the same calling, and as becomes the wor∣shippers of one Lord, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 5.</NOTE> and one God and Fa∣ther of all, who is above all, and through all, and in all, that truly believe.</P>
<P>We agree in Judgment, as to the great points of Salvation, and why not affection and brotherly love, and peace; forbearing one another in little matters, not introdu∣ced into the primitive Churches before the declension and apostacy began, I am sure, the Church of <HI>England</HI> teaches other Doctrine in the second and third part of the Sermon of <HI>Faith.</HI> Well then, we are at amity in this great particular, ☞That [<HI>Faith</HI> is the gracious acting of the whole soul or heart of a sincere Christian; whereby he rests and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Saviour for remission of sins and eternal life grounded on the precious promises of God: which is infused and wrought there by the holy Spi∣rit at our new birth and convertion from sin to holiness.]</P>
<P>In this Declaration of the nature of Faith we may for distinction sake, take more e∣special notice of the succeeding particulars in peculiar Sections.</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<PB N="69" REF="000429_0086_0FA5B0F10C3C85C8"/>
<HEAD>SECT. 1.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. First, We may enquire, where this Grace of Faith is subjected, and thats exprest to be in the whole man.</P>
<P>The Subject of its inherence is not this or that particular faculty, but the whole Soul or heart of Man: as the Scripture of∣ten expresses it: and we may observe that some times the <HI>Heart</HI> is put for the (<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>King.</HI> 3. 9.</NOTE>) un∣derstanding: sometimes for the (<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Act.</HI> 7. 39.</NOTE>) will, other times for (<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 37.</NOTE>) purpose: for the af∣fection of (<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 6. 21.</NOTE>) love: for inordinate (<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 24.</NOTE>) lusts in their seat: for (<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Eccl.</HI> 6. 7.</NOTE>) desire, and for the (<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Luk.</HI> 1. 16 &amp; 21. 14 <HI>Acts</HI> 8: 37: <HI>Luk.</HI> 24 <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 9. <HI>Prov:</HI> 3: 5:</NOTE>) memory.</P>
<P>Now that Faith is scituate, first in ge∣ral, in the heart, and then in the particular faculties; let us further manifest it: and begin with that of <HI>Philip</HI> to the <HI>Eunuch</HI> of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> [<HI>If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest be baptized</HI>] so our Lord to the two Disciples, <HI>O foolish and slow of heart to believe.</HI> Again, in the Episile to the <HI>Romans, if thou shalt believe in thy heart, thou shall be saved.</HI> For <HI>with the heart man believeth unto righteousness:</HI> and we are commanded <HI>to trust in the Lord with all our heart.</HI> And again, Christ is said <HI>to dwell in
<PB N="70" REF="000429_0087_0FA5B0F196A99320"/>
our hearts by Faith:</HI> and on the other side, unbelief is fixed also, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph:</HI> 3: 17. <HI>Heb:</HI> 3: 12</NOTE> or seated in the heart. Take heed left there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief. I might multiply, but its obvious in Scripture.</P>
<P>The Jewish <HI>Rabbins</HI> or <HI>Philosophers</HI> (such as they are) use to place the Soul and, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Job</HI> 38: 36</NOTE> its understanding faulty in the heart, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Barthol. Anat. Hag.</HI> 1655. 8. <HI>d.

The Peripateticks give the Soul a Forest-range through the whole body &amp; others (as I remember) conceit that it swims in the blood, and flies up and down in the spirits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and make a great stir about the <HI>fibula animae:</HI> the button or bond that ties or links the rational and ani∣mal soul together, and when they come to the powers and faculties of the Soul, they make great distinction, and from thence their notions are derived and mixed with many subtleties among the school Divines, in the dark times, before the Reformation appeared. Whose works though in some things may be of good use to fix terms and distinctions: yet ordinarily their niceties have eaten out the heart of solid Divinity, till the happy dayes of the restauration of the Gospel.</P>
<P>As to what we are upon, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Durandus Q Scaliger,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> I think with some of the School men, and several other Learned men of late, that there is no sound
<PB N="71" REF="000429_0088_0FA5B0F26DEBC490"/>
foundation in reason for this variety of fa∣culties, specifically distinct as some would have it: yet having asserted that Faith, is subjected in the whole Soul, that I may conform to the received and used Opinion: I would shew how Faith resides and acts in every reputed faculty, and thence by indu∣ction of particulars in the whole Soul.</P>
<P>That Faith is seated in the <HI>understanding,</HI> is undoubted; because it is a rational act of the soul, being resolved into the divine authority of God, who is infallible. Since also our reason is finite, corrupt and obno∣xious to many impostures from satan: I take him for the wisest and most rational person, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Coe:</HI> 4: 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> who in the deep and profound mysteries of Christian Religion, acts his reason by Faith in this life, and waits for fuller Revelation when he comes to glory. Here we see, that is, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 13: 12:</NOTE> understand but in part, but there we shall know even as we are known.</P>
<P>In the work of Grace, the understanding is first enlightned to know the truth, called the opening of the heart in <HI>Lydia,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 16: 14: <HI>Joh:</HI> 4: 10</NOTE> &amp; our bles∣sed Lord tells the woman of <HI>Sichem:</HI> if thou knewest the gift of God, thou would∣est have asked him for living water. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> Theres a thick masty wall broken through by the hammer of Gods word, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 10: 4.</NOTE> within the stony heart, and a clear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> window placed in the breach: that the light of the glorious Gospel may shine into the mind: <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>cor</HI> 4 4</NOTE> which be∣fore was blinded by the God of this world, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph:</HI> 5: 6:</NOTE> that they should not believe the truth. Ye were darkness it self (sayes <HI>Paul</HI>) more
<PB N="72" REF="000429_0089_0FA5B0F323D9E6F8"/>
than <HI>Egyptian</HI> or <HI>Cymbrian,</HI> this being the darkness of the bottomless pit, but now are light in the Lord.</P>
<P>This illumination from Heaven fetches off the scales as from the eyes of <HI>Paul,</HI> and teaches us all to have a prospect of an Ocean of wonders in Gods Law, and of deep mysteries in the promises, yea to appre∣hend and apply them aright. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa:</HI> 53: 11:</NOTE></P>
<P>Therefore Faith is sometimes set out by knowledg, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jeh:</HI> 10: 38:</NOTE> by his <HI>Knowledg</HI> (objectively) shall my righteous servant justifie many. Our Lord also proving his Deity by his Mi∣racles, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 17: 3:</NOTE> bids them, if they will not credit his words, yet believe his works, that ye may <HI>know</HI> sayes our Lord; and <HI>believe</HI> that the Father <HI>is in me and I in him.</HI> Where know∣ledg and Faith are explicitly connexed to∣gether. Again, This is life eternal to <HI>know</HI> thee and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. It was to that purpose our Lord made himself known and <HI>manifest</HI> to all his Disciples in the glory of his Deity. Yea our Faith on him as God-man is wrought in us by <HI>revelation</HI> from the Spirit, the eyes of our understanding being enligtned by him. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph:</HI> 1: 17</NOTE> So that we have both the object and Organ illustrated at once: Christ set forth in the Gospel, and our understanding shone upon by the Spirit: and at length from the first degree of light, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom:</HI> 1: 17 Col. 2. 2: &amp; 1: 12: 2 <HI>Tim:</HI> 4: 8:</NOTE> the Saints proceed from Faith to Faith, and then by holy Me∣ditation with diligence, arrive to that ac∣knowledgment of the mystery of God and of the Father, and of Christ. Nay to such sweet and full assurance at last, that with holy <HI>Paul,</HI> they come to know, whom they
<PB N="73" REF="000429_0090_0FA5B0F41BBD70C0"/>
have believed, and wait for the Crown of Righteousness at his appearance and King∣dom. From all this we may conclude that a true Believer takes Christ for his Saviour and Ruler, with a clear and irrefragable Judgment.</P>
<P N="2">2. The second particular work in the order of nature, (tho conjoynt in time) as to conversion, is the inclination of the will to receive Christ. Now because the Scripture delights exceedingly to set forth our Relation to Christ by Marriage union: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph:</HI> 5: 32 <HI>Song of Solom:</HI></NOTE> I shall a little insist upon it. We say then in such covenants. that 'tis the <HI>Will</HI> that makes the Match. Tis not the saving a few words in the Chancel out of a Book by inforcement of Parents or Friends instiga∣tion against their own wills and minds, such Marriages are but bruitish conjunctions, when persons marry meerly for Money or outward Preferments, &amp; not unfained love, which God never ordained or appointed to be the ends of that blessed union, but with the heart and sincere affection. Promises are but dipt in falshoods and lies, and of∣ten managed by some subtle false <HI>Judas</HI> for base ends: where the sweet unforced in∣clinations of the will is not present: which will after a while vent it self in captious, per∣verse suspitions and unnatural reflections, and seldom ends but in gall and bitterness without great mercy to the innocent party. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sanctior copuld cordis qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> corporis:</HI></NOTE> For the truth is, it can be no less than an original cheat, and a wicked action: when a Woman accepts a Husband meerly for gain or honour, when her heart was never honestly and truly towards him. It was
<PB N="74" REF="000429_0091_0FA5B0F780C68450"/>
the false act of a strange or whorish heart in the sight of God, when others whose spirits were right, might have stood sincere and faithful, being filld with candor and sweetness, in conjugal Relations. Even so it is as to outward hypocritical and seign∣ed Professors, who take Christ in the Sun∣shine of the Gospel, and in hope of a great inheritance, when the will in its personal adherence to <HI>C</HI>hrist for his righteousness, and holiness, never came to a true and real union. Whereas the Will is the main point in Marriage, according to the determinate rule of the civil Law [<HI>Consensus non con∣cubitus efficit matrimonium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cod. <HI>Justin</HI></NOTE> Tis consent and not the bed that makes it.] <HI>S</HI>o in all mo∣ral actions, contracts and agreements: neither is it otherwise in this grand, spiri∣tual concernment of the soul: when the Judgment has declared the undone and rui∣ned estate of any out of Christ, and pro∣claimed the rare excellencies that are in him; and how appropriate a <HI>S</HI>aviour to scatter all our fears, root out all despon∣dencies; and to supply all its wants and in∣digencies: Then comes in the <HI>Will,</HI> and chooses his person as the most lovely in Heaven and Earth, consents to all his gra∣cious offers, and sincerely embraces his love and mercy with unspeakable joy and thankfulness, and delightful resolutions of new and constant Obedience.</P>
<P>The soul then being invited by Christ in such sweet alluring terms, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ev:</HI> 24: 17: <HI>sa:</HI> 551: <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong:</HI> 1: 3:</NOTE> as these [<HI>Who∣soever</HI> will, let him come and take of the water of life freely, and ho <HI>every one that thirsteth, &amp;c.</HI>] it finds a sweet inclination

<P>In Scripture therefore, the Will is often phrased and signified by the <HI>heart.</HI> Thus <HI>Solomon</HI> prayes at the Dedication, that the Lord would incline their hearts, that is, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>King:</HI> 8: 58: <HI>Psal.</HI> 119, 36, 112.</NOTE> sweetly bend their wills to keep his laws; and <HI>David</HI> thus, <HI>incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and to perform thy Statutes.</HI> To incline the will, is, when divine light has set before the understanding, the know∣ledge of the true good, this divine power inwardly moves the will to it; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lactant, de Orig c:</HI> 3: <HI>de fals. sa</HI> 7. <HI>l.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 10 <HI>de ira Dei c:</HI> 7. <HI>&amp; B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wilkins in a set disc urse</HI> 8. <HI>Lond</HI> 1678.</NOTE> not by any force or coaction, but by a sweet melting and moulding it into the Will of God. Man is a rational creature, and a religi∣ous, as <HI>Lactamius</HI> seems to make the last his specifick difference from bruits. So that when the stony heart is by infinite power changed into golden oar, then 'tis melted by the fire of divine love in the furnace of godly repentance, and by de∣grees cast into the mould of the divine will, and effigiated or shaped into the ex∣act image of his Son. After this great work, the renewed soul finds its will de∣terminately carried to blessed objects, and turned quite about to delight in heavenly persons and things. There's no compul∣sion in the point, but <HI>nature renovate fertur,</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="000429_0093_0FA5B0F854B0D830"/>
the soul being changed, is now by its own spontaneous freedom carried with a spiri∣tual naturality to that which is coadequate to its essence, and hath received from God a blessed recovery to an enjoyment of, and a complacency in this supreame and everlasting good. Now though the soul can do no otherwise (as far as 'tis renewed) yet it is no way compelled, but acts according to its own delight and plea∣sure. For the whole soul, whole heart, whole will, so far as renewed, is carried out with all the Sails of its desires, and satiated with the sense and comfort of this most happy change, and when come to heaven will be fully concentred in those enjoyments, and bathed in that Ocean of bliss, no otherwise in their (though mi∣nute) proportion, than God himself, the humane nature of our Lord, then holy Angels, and the Saints in glory.</P>
<P>After which manner some of the Anci∣ents, and several of the Moderns express themselves. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Strangig de Voluntate Dei, amstel.</HI> 1657. <HI>p.</HI> 683. <HI>l</HI> 36. 14 <HI>&amp; p.</HI> 686.</NOTE> <HI>I</HI> shall a little touch upon what <HI>Strangius</HI> declares to this point [<HI>Libertas naturae est abomni necessitate, quae re∣pugnat naturae voluntaris</HI>] Liberty of nature is when free from all necessity, which is a thing repugnant to the nature of the Will.</P>

<P>This powerful and sweet motion and inclination of the will of a believer by the spirit of God, may be happily shadowed forth by the inclination of the mind in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> carried towards union in the Mar∣riage-covenant. It is of God, and gene∣rally little or no reason to be given of ma∣ny of their choices, but an influence or impulse from heaven, in those that out of pure and honest affection, give mutual consent to that relation, and not for any base and simster ends, but for personal delight in each other: wherein that un∣spotted, intaminated love in rational be∣ings, so vastly differs from bruitish lusts, and draws nigh to an Angelical Excellen∣cy, like that of an honourable Lady to a Philosopher in <HI>Scotland,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Burton</HI> in his book of Melancholly. How much more and transcendently excellent is that joyful and heavenly love moving in the heart by the finger of God, in a soul that thirsts after spiritual espousals to the Lord of Life.</P>
<P>There is no adumbration of our union to the Lord Jesus, more proper or per∣tinent than this, wherein the Scripture doth so greatly delight. To the accom∣plishment whereof the drawing of the Father is requisite, and 'tis performed by inward teaching, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph.</HI> 5. 32 <HI>Rev.</HI> 19. 7. <HI>Joha</HI> 6. 44, 45,</NOTE> and thereby producing a heavenly inclination to this union and communion with his Son: as the most

excellent person, and most beloved of the Soul. This secret work being formed up∣on the heart, makes up that inseparable conjunction with Christ, which shall tri∣umph in the same chariot to eternity. Moreover, when 'tis freely consented to by the Soul (For the gracious heart acts voluntarily, tho by the spirits instigation and inflexion) then does <HI>G</HI>od impute the righteousness of his beloved Son to that soul, being now become a true believer, and by inward intire love in the heart, es∣poused to him.</P>
<P>Hence it follows, that whatever the son hath, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>cor.</HI> 1. 30</NOTE> the Father makes over to a Saint; who by vertue of those espousals enters into a right and title to Christs Wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redempti∣on, and becomes a co-heir with Christ of the same inheritance in the kingdom of glory, and as it is here in the kingdom of grace, so much more in heaven above, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulget radiis mariti,</HI> the Church shineth not by reflected, but by infused or implanted rayes of her husbands glory, being one with Christ in mystical union, the same spirit and the same glory being in there, as our Lord sets it out, [<HI>I in them, and thou in me,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>John</HI> 17. 22, 23. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> 16. 14. <HI>John</HI> 1. 12.</NOTE> <HI>and the glory which thou gavest me, have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> given them, that they may be one, even as we are one</HI>] In his comliness we are made perfect.

Having discoursed a little largely, (with thanks to the stronger christians for their leave and candid forbearance of time as to the weaker <HI>S</HI>aints, about the nature of the will, as being the principal seat of Faith, and the seminary of its fruitful ef∣fects.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed,</P>
<P>In the third place to the affections of the soul, which are indeed but several emanations or streams from the Will, and may be compared to semidiametral lines that flow from this center, and run out in∣to the spacious circumference of actions. For when the heart of will inclines this or that way, or to their opposites: it then shines forth in those extensive eradi∣ations by the passions and several affections of the Soul. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa.</HI> 26. 9.</NOTE> As for instance, the church of God in the Prophet cries out with my soul <HI>have I desired thee in the night season.</HI> So in respect to fear, holy persons are said to fear God in the singleness of <HI>heart:</HI> and o∣thers are recounted to love, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.</HI> 3. 22. <HI>Deut</HI> 13. 3. <HI>Judg.</HI> 16, 15. <HI>Song</HI> 1 4, 7.</NOTE> and <HI>trust</HI> in the Lord with all their hearts, and love is stated to be from the <HI>heart.</HI></P>
<P>In this love of our hearts to Christ, lies the quintescence of our union, and thence a spouse like reverence, and a sweet holy fear to <HI>offend,</HI> or displease him in the least. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph.</HI> 5 33.</NOTE> The like whereof is commanded in Scrip∣ture, to be the holy deportment of all Wives to their Husbands, <HI>Let the Wife see or look to it</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>that she fear or reverence her Husband.</HI> inso∣much

that <HI>Solomon</HI> brings in the Spouse with such a reverent care; when her bride∣groom was asleep, that she charges all persons in and about the place, to make no noise that may disturb or awake her beloved till he please. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Song</HI> 2. 3</NOTE> <HI>S</HI>he is filled with an heart-ravishing joy in communion with him, though here but through the lat∣tesse of Ordinances, takes sweet compla∣cency in an holy rest in his fellowship, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Song</HI> 2. 5.</NOTE> and feels a delicious faintness in the sick ago∣nies of love: is always satiated in his so∣ciety, but never <HI>satisfied,</HI> always filled to the brim with pleasure, and running over in his praise to the daughters of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> while the fountain of love pours out of the heart of Christ into the bosome of a Saint, by a true perpetual motion, this glorious person, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>la.</HI> 62. 5. 7</NOTE> delighting in his goodness and re∣joycing over us with singing.</P>
<P>These and many more are the pure, un∣stained, sanctified motions of the will, so far as renewed, rectified by grace, and acting towards its native and genuine ob∣jects at first concreated with it; as fit, proper and qualified for it. 'Tis the will then, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sal:</HI> 42. 1, 73. 25.</NOTE> which desires, loves, thirsts, longs and pants after the living God, and is ne∣ver quiet or settles its full <HI>complacency</HI> oh any person or thing besides God alone, but there 'tis satiated with all manner of de∣light and joy for evermore.</P>
<P N="4">4. In the next place, conscience comes in to act its part, and having lookt round about upon all the pre-actings of the soul,

subscribes to the new creation with this eulogy: <HI>Behold all the work of God is very good.</HI> It is a mixt act of the soul flowing from the understanding and will together, and proceeds from an inward work, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Simplicius.</HI></NOTE> as a philosopher expresses it, if <HI>I</HI> remember right.</P>
<P>When the soul makes dialogues within it self: It is the reflexion of the soul upon all its precedent acts, whether radical or deduced, wherein conviction is mainely concerned: As the Evangelist speaks of some Pharisees, that they were convinced of their own consciences, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>John</HI> 8, 9.</NOTE> which do accuse or excuse according to the nature of the light and integrity within, and so helps the soul to assurance, by a d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ligent intuiti∣on into the actings of Faith.

This inward redness more especially rises from the immediate rebukes of this vic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gerent, and happy are such, who have their hearts sprinkled from an evil consci∣ence [<HI>nil conseire sibi, nullaque <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>] To be conscious of no guilt, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 22.</NOTE> and to have no faults staining vermilion upon the checks of conscience.</P>
<P>I might enlarge in the next place upon the power of fancy and imagination, that anvill and hammer of thoughts in the work-house of the brain.</P>
<P>But I rather proceed to the last that I shall touch upon: and that's the <HI>Memo∣ry,</HI>
<PB N="82" REF="000429_0099_0FA5B19833F7B600"/>
that wonderful faculty: which <HI>Austin</HI> in his confessions does so extreamly and deservedly admire, and the <HI>Platonists</HI> are so deeply affected with it, that they thought the souls science to be little else then <HI>reminiscence,</HI> or a recognition of what it had before its delapse from heaven into the body. <HI>Memory</HI> is the souls christal cabinet replenisht with diamond cells or <HI>Loculi,</HI> so termod by <HI>Lully:</HI> wherein things heard and learned, are safely retained; and who is able to expound the reason of its rehearsals.

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Primary Efficient Cause of FAITH.</HEAD>
<P>AS to the efficient Cause, Author or Worker of Faith in the heart: we know that every good gift comes down from Heaven. And hence Faith is sometime ascribed to the donation of God essential; being called the gift of God, the Faith of the operation of God. Again,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jam.</HI> 1. 17 <HI>Eph</HI> 2. 2. <HI>Col.</HI> 2. 2. <HI>Phil.</HI> 1. 29. 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 1. 11. <HI>Phil.</HI> 2. 13:</NOTE> tis said to be given to the Saints to believe, and the work of Faith is said to be the effect of his mighty power: In which, and in all other heavenly gifts and graces, to will and to do are both wrought of God. As tis in true repentance, a grace thats al∣wayes conjoyned with Faith, and leads out of our selves by the hand of Faith into Christ; the former being given of God, so is Faith.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. 5.</NOTE> All our sufficiency to think but a good thought slides down from Heaven.</P>
<P>Q. If you ask then, <HI>How thoughts come into the heart?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="000429_0102_0FA5B1A135BB9998"/>
<HI>A.</HI> I Answer: They flow into the head or heart by the power of imagination, thru the windows of the senses or from concre∣ated ideas, or by some instillations and spe∣cial infusions from God, as it is in all curi∣ous Arts and Sciences:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prev.</HI> 8. 12</NOTE> He is the finder out of all witty Inventions, as we read in the case of <HI>Bezaleel</HI> for the Tabernacle, and in <HI>Hiram</HI> for Temple works. If you ask, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> holy thoughts come? I answer, from the infusion of the Spirit,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i</HI> 1. 2:</NOTE> and his warming the waters of the Soul; as it is exprest by <HI>Moses</HI> in the first Creation, so it is in the new Creation from the breathings of the Spirit on the garden of spice<HI>s,</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e himself hath planted in our hearts. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa.</HI> 26. 12: <HI>Psal:</HI> 33: 22: 1 <HI>Chro.</HI> 29: 18: 1 <HI>Joh:</HI> 2: 27</NOTE> So it is in the work of Faith, as the Church ex∣presses it: <HI>Thou hast wrought all our works in us and for us:</HI> he causeth us to trust or hope in his Word. He begins and inspires good thoughts into us, and keeps them in the imagination of our hearts. He teaches and anoints us with the oil of the Spirit. He makes all new within us, and puts hearts of flesh into us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jer.</HI> 31: 18▪ <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36: 26</NOTE> and turns us unto himself, because he is the Lord our God, having accepted us into covenant relation with himself.</P>
<P>Sometimes the work of Faith is ascribed to the Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph</HI> 1 19, 20.</NOTE> as in that to the <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hesians:</HI> we are made to believe by the exceeding great∣ness of the mighty power of the Father, even the same power which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead. And other where it is said,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Joh.</HI> 6. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> <HI>that no man can come to the Son</HI> (that is, by Faith) <HI>except the Father draw him by the golden chain of his e∣lecting

love, and teaches him from his chai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Heaven.</HI> Besides the work is oftentimes ascribed to Christ, who is said to be the Author and Finisher of our Faith, and that he is exalted to give repentance and for∣giveness of sins,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb</HI> 12. 2. <HI>Act.</HI> 5. 31</NOTE> both which are intimately co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nexed with Faith, as in the case of the Father of the tormented Child,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mark</HI> 9. 24</NOTE> praying to Christ to help his unbelief.</P>
<P>But more especially and immediately its attributed to the holy Spirit, who works in our understandings to think of heavenly things, and puts holy motions into our hearts, which are the original of those sud∣den thoughts by darting of Scriptures, and precious Promises into our memories,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 5, 9. <HI>John</HI> 14. 26.</NOTE> and kindling sparks of light and comfort in our hearts: yea the witnessing of our spi∣rits to him are wrought by him. He in∣clines our wills to embrace himself, and <HI>C</HI>hrist our Lord. For if we have not the spirit of <HI>C</HI>hrist,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom</HI> 8. 9.</NOTE> we are none of his. Yea, Faith it self, even as all other graces are given by one and the same spirit. Again, one of the fruits of the Spirit is recorded to be Faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</HI> 12, 9</NOTE> and to speak with reverence, it is from his implantation and inoculation in the new paradise of the Soul.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gal</HI> 5. 22.</NOTE> Yea, and after that we have believed, we are al∣so sealed up in the Faith by this holy spirit of promises. He seals all his own gracious workings upon our hearts. Sometimes Believers are said to receive the Holy Ghost presently upon the first work which evi∣dently shews the connexion of Faith and holiness by the samespirit. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph</HI> 1, 13. 13, 19. 3, 16, 17</NOTE> Hence tis ob∣servable,
<PB N="87" REF="000429_0104_0FA5B1A40DD8FBA0"/>
that tho Prophecies be never so perspicuously and radiantly fulfilled, and tho admirable miracles were performed to illustrate the presence of the Deity: yet they wrought not the least grain of Faith, without the energy of the spirit; he must add thereto an inward miracle upon the heart. Thus it b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fel the <HI>Israelites</HI> in the <HI>A∣rabian Desart:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Deut.</HI> 29. 3, 4.</NOTE> For God (sayes <HI>Moses</HI>) gave them not a <HI>heart</HI> to perceive unto that day. Just so the <HI>Capernaites,</HI> they saw <HI>C</HI>hrist<HI>s</HI> blessed person, and his eminent Miracles; but believed not, as not being given to them by the Father: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Joh</HI> 6. 36, 37. <HI>John</HI> 12. 37.</NOTE> and so it was with the Pharisees and other Jews, tho he had done such great works before their eyes, yet they believed not on him. There must be therefore a working power of the spirit concomitant with the Ministry of the out∣ward call of the Word: else none shall be∣lieve the report of <HI>C</HI>hrist by <HI>Isaiah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa.</HI> 53. 1.</NOTE> unless the arm of the Lord be revealed within. Hence it is that some have professed to have heard a kind of voice at their conversion: as holy <HI>Austin</HI> declares expresly concerning himself under a fig tree in the <HI>G</HI>arden at <HI>Millain:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Confes.</HI> 18. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>▪</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa</HI> 30. 21.</NOTE> not di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ormous from that of the Prophet▪ <HI>They shall hear a voice behind them saying, this is the way, walk ye in it.</HI></P>
<P>Q. <HI>But some may say, If Faith be wrought by the Holy Ghost,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 2.</NOTE> <HI>how is it said that we re∣ceive the Holy Ghost by Faith?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I Answer, Tho the Holy Ghost work Faith in us at first, that Faith which was wrought in us by him, is further augmen∣ted
<PB N="88" REF="000429_0105_0FA5B1A4ECD4F590"/>
and increased in us by the same holy spirit and acts together with him in prayer for a further addition of his gifts and gra∣ces.

<P>The first and more immediate▪ is the <HI>forgiveness</HI> of sin, and justification of our persons, by the imputation of the merito∣rious Blood of Christ.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 13. 38, 39</NOTE> As <HI>Paul</HI> in his Sermon at <HI>Antioch</HI> in <HI>Pisidia,</HI> preacht the forgivenes<HI>s</HI> of sins, and that all which be∣lieved in him were justified from all things, as to which they could not be by the law of <HI>Moses,</HI> according as the Evangelist ex∣prest it:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 1. 21.</NOTE> <HI>He came to save his people from their sins.</HI></P>

<P>In the sixth place, it's of great use to amplifie upon the foundation or ground∣work of our encouragement, in the ma∣nagement of this great affair aright by the strength and co-operation of the spirit: and that's no other, than by the divine <HI>promises,</HI> laid up in the covenant of grace 'Tis the promise allures us, the voice of the word calls us, the faithfulness of God secures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, the motion of the spirit prompts, incites and hastens us to come to Christ; who most graciously accepts us, kisses us, and lays us down to rest in his most fragrant bosom.

<P>I might trace a little the time of Faiths first infusion, and first operation in the heart, which is undoubtedly at the new birth, when ever it is. But how to prescribe, and when precisely to determine that, in the soul of a Believer is more difficult, than to state the quickening or animation of an em∣brio in the womb of her that is with child, or for any Naturallist so set the moment of the first separation of night from day at the initiating crepusculum or ascent of the first attom of the morning raies of the Suns body, or the primogenial fermentation of the vegetative soul in the seed Corn in the Earth, when it begins to chit; or the first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apors in Mineral beds, that procreare <HI>Mer∣cury</HI> into a running liquid body, which af∣terward is congealed by Sulphur into Gold.

<P>THe beginning and carrying on of the work of Faith in the heart is set forth in holy Scripture by many pertinent and sweet expressions, which tend to enlighten and comfort the souls of dark, drooping and weak believers: and helping them to dis∣cern the inherence of this grace in their hearts.

<P N="1">1.

<P>The soul having in these few panting <HI>soliloquies,</HI> poured forth its breakings of heart before <HI>G</HI>od, desires yet further to be resolved in one question, to help its joy and there with <HI>I</HI> shall conclude this chap∣ter.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>How may I discern the truth and indegnity of these breathings of the soul to be the true a tings of Faith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ. I</HI> answer, labour to feel the pulse of thy soul, as once a Greek Physician tou∣ching the arterial pulse of a young Prince of <HI>Macedon,</HI> know whether is heart want. So may we assuredly know, where our treasure is seated and where our love is planted: if we find our hearts to be where <HI>C</HI>hrist is set down, even at the right-hand of God.</P>
<P>But lets reply a little more distinctly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cor. 3:1, 2.</NOTE></P>
<P N="1">1. Consider, where thy soul doth most acquisce, where dost thou feel thy soul at
<PB N="114" REF="000429_0131_0FA5B1BFC996B258"/>
most rest and quiet. He that bids his soul take ease in a sat barn, was but a gross fool,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luke</HI> 12. 18.</NOTE> and he that puts his hope or trust in a clod of yellow clay, bows down to a dumb Idol, that cannot profit. But if as <HI>David</HI> (when dying) we have all our hope and salvation in the covenant of a living <HI>God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Sam,</HI> 23.</NOTE> establisht to us in all things and sure. If thou repose thy weary spi∣rits in the bosome of Christ, and findest thy lingring weariness to wear away in the warm bath of his Love, and resignest thy self into his tuition, and under the ca∣nopy of heaven, and exercising thy self in applying precious promises suitable to thy captive state by the rivers of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and patiently waitest for his bright and bles∣sed appearance and Kingdom.</P>
<P>This is true Faith.</P>
<P N="2">2. Where is the solace and delight of thy soul? Is it in things and persons of Christ<HI>s</HI> delight: The things of the spirit, and the excellent persons upon earth: is thy soul at rest,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom</HI> 8. 5. <HI>Psal.</HI> 16. 3. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5, 1.</NOTE> and under holy quiet; because in some measure satisfied, that thou art at peace with God. This will breed true joy, for peace is the <HI>alma parens,</HI> they happy Mother of joy. Whereas contenti∣on and grief quarrel in the yoke together. Now when the storms of <HI>G</HI>ods wrath are calmed by the sprinkling of Christs preci∣ous blood upon the Mercy-Seat, there will gradually follow joy unspeakable and full of glory. And where this peace is, there's true Faith be sure.</P>
<P N="3">3. By the souls continuance in the daily actings of faithful recumbency, whereby

<P>HAving Discoursed of some various Ex∣pressions of Scripture, painting out the true Nature of Faith to the life: Let us now proceed further in our design to comfort shaken, and contrite Spirits. To which end, since we find Scripture menti∣oning some persons as strong in Faith, gi∣ving glory to God, and others but infirm and weak, accosted with this compellation:
<PB N="116" REF="000429_0133_0FA5B1C16B6BF780"/>
<HI>O ye of little Faith,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 6. 30. <HI>&amp;</HI> 8. 26.</NOTE> why do ye doubt and fear? the Faith of the former being very visible and apparent to themselves and others: the latter tho true Believers, yet exceedingly fill'd with fears, sorrows and jealousies o∣ver their own hearts: It would be expe∣dient for their erection and comfort to consider what may be the <HI>Criterions</HI> or tok∣ens of a true Faith tho in the lowest degree and upon that account to dilate a little on these two Branches</P>
<P N="1">1. What may be accounted the lowest, meanest, weakest estate of new Converts or young beginners in the School of Christ.</P>
<P>And 2 To how low an Ebb secure souls may be reduced in time of desertion.</P>
<P>An answer to either of these may yield mutual satisfaction to both: Lets begin with the first,</P>
<P>Q 1. <HI>What may we enstate and determine to be a critical token of a true Believer in his meanest acts of Faith?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In Answer to this lets <HI>c</HI>onsider, First in general, that the commencement or be∣ginning of this grace is sometimes repre∣sented by conception or quickning of a Child in the Womb:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 2. <HI>John</HI> 3. 3.</NOTE> sometimes by the new birth or visible appearance in the light of this World. Sometimes the work of regeneration (and therein Faith, its prin∣cipal ingredient) is resembled to the wind in its invisible original from mineral Exha∣lations out of the bowels of the Earth and Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mark</HI> 4. 27. <HI>Luk.</HI> 13. 2.</NOTE> to its motion and progress in the air. Otherwise 'tis likened to a grain of Mus∣tard-seed, the least of all oleracious Seeds
<PB N="117" REF="000429_0134_0FA5B1C6A078B2C8"/>
that grow to so great an extension at last. It's likened also to a little leaven that fer∣ments and works it self into the whole mass. To Seed-Corn under the globe or mould that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the impregnation of nitrous Rain, and sulphurions Earth, con∣curring to their germination first chits and breaks the membranes, and then sprouts a∣bove the ground, Or it may be compared to the budding and flowring of Trees in the Spring: or to the grafting of a Cyon into the cleft: or a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into the bark of a Tree, which b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> degrees <HI>c</HI>onceives both by the warmth and moisture of the Stick. But still the precise time or <HI>modus</HI> of the curious transactions in the vegetable Kingdom; these certain fusion or perco∣lation of Liquors and Spirits is not easily discerned, or accounted for, by the most ac∣curate Naturalists. Yea when all is done and written by <HI>Roger Bacon of Oxford,</HI> or Sir <HI>Francis</HI> or <HI>Veralam,</HI> or the Learned <HI>Har∣vy,</HI> or an of the new Philosophers of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> France</HI> or <HI>Germany,</HI> or <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> that Learned <HI>Dane:</HI> there's hope in the whole quire can yet determine the admirable my∣steries of Generation.

<P>Put much more abstruse,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 139. 15. <HI>Opere Phigia∣nico.</HI></NOTE> intricate and unfathomable is it in spiritual cases. For how and at what time grace is inspired or sown in the heart: and how it works, fer∣ments and by warm influences, becomes like a <HI>Spiritus intus agens,</HI> an inward work∣ing
<PB N="118" REF="000429_0135_0FA5B1C9F881C260"/>
Spirit: its neither discerned by persons themselves, much less by others, sometimes during the space of several years, For it grows we know not how,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 2. 6. <HI>Col.</HI> 2. 19.</NOTE> nor can delineate the motion of its growth: but being wa∣tered from heaven by a living mist sent by God upon this happy Plant in the <HI>Eden</HI> of a gracious soul, it encreases with the encrease of God. Hence it follows, that 'tis im∣possible for thousands of fix the time of these firm heaven, working or irritations, these irradiations or impregnations of the Spirit of God. Neither need <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sufficient it is to discern it, when sprouted a little from its seminal Principles wherefore to urge the preciseness of time as to regeneration (in persons that draw near to Ordinances) is timerarious and rash; and he is too busie a person, that strictly requires it of tender Consciences, and makes it an inflexible rule of Communion.</P>
<P>I may then say of this, more than of all other works of divine Wisdom and Power in this lower Orb, that the eye of the Vul∣ture hath not searcht it out: it is too high and too wonderful for us. As holy <HI>David</HI> having treated of his being secretly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Joh.</HI> 28. 7. <HI>Psal.</HI> 139. 6</NOTE> fearful∣ly and wonderfully made as to the curious fabrick of his body in all its vessels, liga∣ments, veins, arterie<HI>s,</HI> nerves, and juices in all the repositaries, sings in harmony and consort to heaven (how vastly melodious beyond the hymn of <HI>Galen</HI>) and stands at length upon the brink of an Ocean of Ex∣tasies as to the precious thought,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> 17.</NOTE> that God had to and in his soul I shall therefore not venture into these <HI>Arcara Imperii,</HI> and <HI>Mag∣niala

Dei,</HI> these stupendious secrets of divine wisdom and mercy: nor sail toofar in deep waters near this <HI>terra incognita,</HI> nor treat too close of the first initial formation of grace and faith in the heart, by the operati∣on of the spirit of God. A labour where∣in we may sweat and toil till saint, and dive so long, till the damps in these golden mines extinguish our Spirits. I shall then only for some comfort to sincere beginners insist a little (according to what I may, by the help of grace) and ponder on the first dis∣coveries and discernings of this work in the heart, under the beginning work of Rege∣neration, that is under the present agitati∣ons and breathings of the holy Spirit. To which purpose I may genuinely compare the sense, which the mother of an Embrio begin<HI>s</HI> to feel, when discerns an inward conception by some secret pulsations as of a little wind in her bowels and some nauseous ebullitions from her stomack,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ferneli de</HI> &amp;c <HI>Weckerns de Secretis</HI> 1. 4. p. 85. <HI>Bas.</HI> 1629.</NOTE> &amp; thereby perceives there is a new work of impregnation formed with in, beyond all observations of the state of body since here birth: and begins to give a right judgment, that in Gods due time she may become a happy Mother, indeed, of some beautiful creature. Or give leave to behold it in the glass of another Emblem. It fares here, as when persons by some un∣observed and unforeseen emanations of spi∣rits from the heart,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plin.

into deep admiration of somewhat in each other, which neither themselves nor the wi∣sest Philosopher in being can give reason sa∣gacious enough to unfold the surprizing in∣fluence when they are constellated to con∣jugal union.</P>
<P>So true is that (I think) of <HI>Lucretius:</HI>
<Q><L><HI>Malts legit sacro involucro natura, neque <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI></L>

<Q><L>Nature with sacred mantle things does hide,</L>
<L>Nor can Man's wit such mysteries decide.</L></Q></P>
<P>Much more deep shall we find it to be in spiritual and divine concernments, when the Soul having heard or read of the admi∣rable and unparallel'd incomparable excel∣lencies of Christ, begins by the power of heaven influence to hearken to Gospel motions; whence the first beginnings of grace are coucht in faint and weak, though sweet and pleasing inclinations to hear more of that precious and excellent person. Then the Soul proceeds with the Daughters of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to enquire further of his dignities and the blessed disposition of this kingly sa∣viour. Next after intelligence received, it never rests seeking for him with the lovely Spouse,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In Niceph call.</HI></NOTE> and when once come to a sight of that glorious countenance in which Majesty and Love sit upon their Throne, as 'tis re∣ported of his external hiew) then does the soul by this interview, break forth into holy Ardorsafter the enjoyment of his everlast∣ing

kindness, and the bottomless bowels of his infinite mercy and affection, This is the point which I would end favour yet fur∣ther, to exemplifie in the sequel of this Cha∣pter, and labour to state the first beginnings of grace to lie in secret motions, holy wish∣es and inclinations of the will to Christ this Princely <HI>S</HI>aviour of the Elect.</P>
<P>The desire of a man (saves <HI>Solomon</HI>) is his kindness the he cant accomplish his will yet tis acceptable with God for the died,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prev.</HI> 19. 22. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8. 12.</NOTE> When some spiritual good is presented to the newly sanctioned will be the light of a heaven-born judgment: it draws the soul to think, ponder and study how to attain that happiness, and this volition or exten∣sion of the spirit is found in different persons at various times.

there a little, and the work of God may prosper sweetly.</P>
<P>In Persons at the first workings of the Spirit of <HI>G</HI>od, you may observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>First,</HI> There appears some savouring of the things of God: which shews there is a new palate formed by the spirit of God in the soul,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2. 14. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 5.</NOTE> suited to the Manna of heaven; they begin to mind he things of the <HI>S</HI>pi∣rit, with a disrelish of vain and frothy com∣pany, a happy inclination to virtue, and wholsom infusions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> reverent awe to their Teachers and institutor<HI>s:</HI> which when once taken off from the heart, all the Argument or Rhetorick in the world shall never fallen any good maxim upon such a person; but now you shall see very young ones love to have their heads in a Bible, and the tears ready to spring at some sweet pas∣sages in that blessed Book: intimating to us that the same spirit, who penned it, hath begun to write the faithful counterpart on the fleshy tables of their hearts.</P>
<P N="2">2. They find and feel the inward bent of their soul to be towards <HI>G</HI>od, the byas of the will alwayes inclined Heaven-ward, tho some rubs and hillocks may divert a while. They are like the <HI>S</HI>un-flower ever turning to that glorious Lamp; or as the needle pointing to the Northern Pole. <HI>It</HI> may suffer some variations and supervaria∣tions, and misteries of Declination not hitherto fully determined to help the lon∣gitude; but in the main, its course bent and delight is toward that point of the compass. The soul no otherwise, having received an affrication or touch from di∣vine
<PB N="123" REF="000429_0140_0FA5B1CE1D0D7C18"/>
love, evermore bends the motion to∣wards God, and is enamoured upon the goodness and Excellency of our blessed Saviour. Vain things like vinegar upon nitre,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prov.</HI> 25. 29. <HI>Eccl.</HI> 2 2.</NOTE> gives an odious hiss, and fumes a∣way in a Stench: so does this gracious soul pity carnal mens laughter as a touch of madness, and sayes of foolish mirth what does is?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Again, There is in this new heart of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, this covenant heart, an inward, sweet sensibleness of that great stone of impenitence, that as yet remains unbroken in pieces, which with its ragged points and angles wounds, the tender fleshy part, and makes it bleed with joy∣ful sorrow. The holy new convert is greatly sensible of its proud flesh, and that heavy lump that hangs like a talent of lead at the feet: and the worlds bird-lime that sticks to the wings of the soul, when it would mount up to heaven in holy duties. Or as persons after a great autumnal fever, labour under a squeazy stomack with a mass of baked humours at the bottom. So does the soul, and weeps in secret, and often bewailes it before the throne of God.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. There is also found within it a secret joy in the discovery of light. <HI>It</HI> takes in∣ward pleasure in the launcing of the tu∣mors of pride, to let out the corruption of nature. The lamp of Gods word is more precious and joyful to it, than the dawn∣ings of a Spring-morning out of the East. It's sign of an unsanctified heart and a very proud spirit, to snuff and smart at godly reproof. But this is a certain note of grace begun, when no corruption is too dear, no secret sin so delectable: but
<PB N="124" REF="000429_0141_0FA5B1CED0669008"/>
it will part with it at the conviction of the Spirit. Yea, and the more searching, any Ministry is, the more it delights to fit under it; &amp; dares not call that a legal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which drives men out of the School of the Law, into the Temple of Christ.</P>
<P N="5">5. Besides, the tender soul g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieves un∣der it<HI>s</HI> fears of the want of true Faith, and is never quiet, till it gain some li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly hope of its implantation into Christ, which it c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erishes and no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the applica∣tion of promises. But till then it wrings its hands, runs up and down moornfully through all the streets of New <HI>Jerusa∣lem;</HI> being desolate in spirit, as not ha∣ving a comforting sense of any faith at all. It cries lamentably from watch-man to watch-man, bears many affronts and inju∣ries in the tearing of her vail,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Song.</HI> 5. 7.</NOTE> and smit∣ing upon her head; till at last she finds her beloved, &amp; embraces him in the arms of Faith. Then the soul continues in the use of all prescribed means to attain the vision of his divine love in the glass of affiance.</P>
<P N="6">6. Again, This troubled soul flies far from the land of excuses, hates palliations, and self-conceited applauses, and layes all the fault upon it self: heaps accusations, and layes snares and tentations for its own feet: and so great, that the holyest minister, and one skilful in cases of con∣science, can hardly sometimes answer and resolve. Whereas the hypocritical Phari∣see is commonly full of talk, hath little or no solidity, is confident and boasts of ex∣periences with a false tongue and deceit∣ful
<PB N="125" REF="000429_0142_0FA5B1D070BA8C60"/>
heart. But our gracious young convert is as sensible of the least sin, as the tender∣est hand hath a quick and immediate sense of the fitting of a flye, or the gentle brea∣things of a Western Air. It laments over In-dwelling sin, bewails its residence, and sounds continual alarums against it. For it cannot bear the domination of that proud Vice-roy of Satan, to fullfil it in any lusts thereof. If it prevail though but a little, the soul triumphs as if its conquering flag were entring the gates of heaven. For although its motions and impulses against unholiness be yet but weak, tender and low; yet are they the fruits of integrity, and grow forward in <HI>S</HI>trength. This i<HI>s</HI> a true sign of grace, and that the new life is in good earnest begun in that heart; for is finds repentance towards <HI>G</HI>od, and true sorrow for sin, conjoyned with real incli∣nations, resolutions and workings in its gradual turning from it, and an holy ha∣tred of all thoughts of reversion to it.</P>
<P N="7">7. The soul feels within it self an ho∣ly inclination to sincerity, in all its actions; which like a fragrant perfume in every chamber of all its powers and faculties, gives a grateful scent in every duty: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 139. 23.</NOTE> and delight<HI>s</HI> to be unfeigned in every good word and work. It hates painted gar∣ments of hypocrisie, and therefore with great humility, requests of God to search its heart, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 143. 2. 130. 3.</NOTE> and begs to be what <HI>G</HI>od would have it, and prays withal, that he would not enter into a severe judgment, <HI>and mark whats done amiss with an urgent scrutiny: for then no flesh can stand in his sight, but
<PB N="126" REF="000429_0143_0FA5B1D108EBBCB8"/>
intreats forgiveness of God that so he may be feared and worshipped.</HI> From hence springs that solid, sweet and comfortable doctrine of the Reformed Churches [<HI>That the true desire of grace is true grace:</HI>] On which <HI>Basis</HI> sound consolation will stand inviola∣bly, when all the proud towers of <HI>Pelagi∣us</HI> and <HI>Arminius</HI> shall moulder into dust at the fall of <HI>Babylon.</HI> For now the soul in this humble and holy frame lies at the foot of God, mourns for sin as committed against God, thirsts after the righteous∣ness of Christ alone, and prayes for the spirit of God to allure and draw it into fuller communion, having taken God in the new covenant for its God alone.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Lastly, it studies the increase of holiness by all holy means and methods in meditation, self-examining, and conversing with old dis∣ciples, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Cor.</HI> 7 1.</NOTE> and experienced believers. For in such-like God communicates his gracious pre∣sence: and in these mountains of Zion Com∣mands the blessing and life for evermore.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In these and such particulars, if serious Christians would please to go down the stairs of humility,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 133. 3.</NOTE> into the closet of their own heart, and ponder more upon what they read with holy meditation, they might better observe the</HI> [mo∣tus primo primi] <HI>the first infant motions of their hearts towards God and heavenly objects: but cursory reading spoils all.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Some indeed advise an hours meditation to an hours reading, I think a set quanti∣ty of time is not necessary, but so much as may cleare and warm the motion upon the heart. By experience it will be found that the spirit of God works by various
<PB N="127" REF="000429_0144_0FA5B1D1CE3ED5D8"/>
methods</HI> and very different, yet so, that by one or other token any poor broken trem∣bling soul may in some measure be com∣forted, as to a true work begun in the heart, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 51. 6.</NOTE> and may learn to know divine wis∣dom in its secret formations of grace with∣in it<HI>s</HI> utmost recesses and retirements. To conclude, I take this to be one of the lowest sentiments of a true work, when there are found continually secret inclina∣tions, motions, thirstings and desires after God and holiness, which by strict and care∣ful observation may be perceived to grow and increale year by year; and this note is common to all believers, though in their weakest estate: who would not change their slender hopes for all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them. This work flows from the first breathings of the spirit of God, and may be discerned as to truth and sincerity by these two notes.</P>

2. <HI>Of the lowest acts of grace in a desert∣ed Soul.</HI></P>
<P>Here, such as are inwardly for the main work truly gracious; yet through vain walking, and too much frequenting and associating with vain company of for∣thy relations, who because of nearness of blood or affinity, some sweet tempers are loth to reprove, for want of the grace of holy courage and wisdom: finding too much carnal delight in them, especially if witty and pleasant: though it cost them many a salt tear in closets. <HI>I</HI>n this there lie<HI>s</HI> a deep snare to easy and unthinking spirits, not considering the after-pangs to bring forth a new birth of holiness, tho' they be otherwise in the main truly pi∣ous.</P>
<P>Others are taken with apish garbs and habits, fashions and gestures, going bent, as if troubled with some forraign disease, conforming themselves to the image of this present world,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom</HI> 12 2. <HI>Luke</HI> 16. 15.</NOTE> which is -abomination in the sight of God, loving of trifling and unprofitable converses in their visits, and wanting of secret and serious thoughts of eternity, the world to come, and of stan∣ding before the Son of Man in his day, and this often joyned with too much neglect of secret and working communion, at which the world scoffs, when spending their strength and marrow in the worship of <HI>Mammon</HI> or <HI>Flora,</HI> fall off at length too far from their zeal for the pure worship of God in Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="000429_0146_0FA5B1D34893ADC0"/>
Others by various deordinations of life, (not here to lengthen about) for want of caution and watchfulness over their hearts and lives, grieve and vex the spirit of God and having wounded their own conscien∣ces, have lost their crown of joy, that's withered away: and they are now defer vingly bemoaning themselves in the dark caverns of desertion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa.</HI> 50. 11.</NOTE> and can see no light, and are in danger to follow others, who blazed a while, and then went out in a snuff, whereas it becomes true believers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb.</HI> 4 1.</NOTE> to be very tender and careful that they do not so much as seem to fall short of so great salvation.</P>
<P>I answer, before any comfort can break in, to such; they must repent and do their first works, and take heed they do not fur∣ther lost what they have wrought. Yet to such <HI>I</HI> reccommend our Lords advise to <HI>Laodicea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>John.</HI> 8. <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 18.</NOTE> to buy eye-salve of him to a∣noint their eyes, that they may see and acknowledge their sins, and turn at his re∣buke and chastening.</P>
<P>Then may they begin with some hope to search what vital acts are not as yet extinguisht. Though in a swoone or a <HI>deliquium animae</HI> an ecclipse of spirits, yet their pulse has not lost all its vibrations, their eyes not quite set: yet look up to∣wards heaven, though somewhat dismally. There's yet left a little warmth, a little moisture, a little breathing against the looking-glass of a promise, held by a faithful searcher and observer of souls. You may take notice that this partial back

slider turns not wholly to prophaneness and an utter forsaking of the wayes of God: but retains an impulse and a secret, respect to those that are gracious, but does not muc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> care to shew it publickly, and when they begin to revive out of their long fit of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olly, give a doleful motion of their eye to their near relations, at whose checks they formerly scoft too much. They are like the smoking flax, or weik in the golden candlestick newly gone out, which yet by admotion or putting to it a little lamp fire of the sanctuary; conceive afresh flame moving swiftly to it upon the oily smoke ascending from it. Or they may be compared to the bruised reed, which being battered by a storm of tentations lays down its hanging head upon the sur∣ging Waves of a violent torrent, and is high to be swallowed up. I say to such though now in a sorrowful case, yet if they were once implanted truly into Christ the true vine of <HI>Lebanon:</HI> they shall never finally wither and perish: for the calling and grace of God is without repentance, who always loves to the end. For the foun∣dation of his prescience and pre-electing love remaineth sure, he knoweth who are his: but let them take he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d that they de∣part from all iniquity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Tim,</HI> 2, 19.</NOTE> and never return to folly more. They may make a shift to get to heaven, and sit within the door; but with many a piercing sorrow and doleful agony, and black Sack cloth on the loins of their hearts, before they get thither. But in the mean time, if they are right (as <HI>I</HI> hope and here suppose) <HI>I</HI> would help a little,

Vital acts may begin to appear in recording the former times of the shi∣nings of Gods face upon their tabernacles. Yet, as some Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mes conceive, that though <HI>Davids</HI> bones were well set after his sore fall: yet there remained a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a stiff∣ness and benummedness that was like an Almanack to him all his days after,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 51. 8.</NOTE> to his last.

and of being received to mercy upon com∣mon terms of the amplitude of divine be∣nignity, and yet continue notoriously and grosly neglective of holy duties, unless by fits, using them as bellows to blow up the bla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of false and flattering hopes: for if they do at times, hear, read, and pray, yet spend not (together with them) such serious and searching meditation on the deep points of eternity as their cause re∣quires. But if they do now and then up∣on a fit of melancholly: yet quickly aban∣don all their secret resolution<HI>s</HI> of amend∣ment, and slip out of all, like an E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le af∣ter thunder, and seldom come near it more but if they chance to return a little, it is upon some terror of <HI>G</HI>od, some disaster, some sickness, some loss, some fear, some fright of conscience, and then theyl con∣fess and seem to repent of sin, and look full of flushes, wipe their mouth with her in the proverbs, and after vowes, make enquiry: expiate their wickedness with a sacrifice: and then to it again.</P>
<P>Dare men thus impose upon God, and e∣ven wrest and force mercy against the Pro∣mises which are alway connext with obe∣dience to precepts, or do they think to lay the load upon Gods Soveraignty; and with a bold face lay the cause of their wicked∣ness at his door, who is bound to none, 'tis mercy and free grace to any.

<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 1. <HI>How to discern the first begin∣nings of Grace?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> As it was with <HI>Thomas,</HI> he had at
<PB N="134" REF="000429_0151_0FA5B1DBA61A41D8"/>
first but a confused knowledge whether <HI>C</HI>hrist was going, when told of his depar∣ture: and as the blind man being under <HI>C</HI>hrists cure, saw imperfectly at first, men walking like Trees: but at length came to more perfect sight: so tis here, good souls at first see but darkly, and feel but grosly, yet thus much they may surely know, and therefore infer a work of <HI>G</HI>race surely be∣gun within them, by serious enquiry into their own hearts; what their inmost thoughts when in a good frame do princi∣pally run upon? what their earnest desires do most constantly thirst after and pitch up∣on? what the secret wishes of their Souls are bent upon? and herein Conscience will be a faithful witness whether it be for Sal∣vation in the true way of Faith and Holi∣ness, which is accepting of Christ on the terms of grace and Gospel tenders, as I have often mentioned to be the matter of our most close and secret enquiry,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> 23. 7.</NOTE> and impartial resolution from an honest and un∣bribed Conscience. On which account I may remember what ouce Mr. <HI>Rogers</HI> of <HI>Hassam,</HI> being desired by Mr. <HI>Knightly</HI> a worthy Gentleman in <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> when one time he could not sleep in the night, to help him to a Scripture to medi∣tate on, told that of <HI>Solomon; As the man thinketh, so is he,</HI> which is so in truth; For at what stairs the heart, and its continued thoughts are plying: there lies the true index of the souls state and its future hap∣piness.</P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>Whether desires of Grace are Grace?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="000429_0152_0FA5B1DC66E38160"/>
<HI>Ans.</HI> The former hint at this, lets a little enlarge and determine for a Scripture truth: if those desires be true and sincere of which take two or three tokens.</P>
<P N="1">1. If such desires are followed with faithful and speedy endeavours to promote and accomplish in the use of proper means. <HI>One thing have I desired,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eccl.</HI> 9. 10. <HI>Psal.</HI> 27. 8. <HI>Prov.</HI> 1. 3, 4. 18. 1. 21. 21. 22. 1.</NOTE><HI>sayes</HI> David, <HI>and that will I seek after</HI> the soul of a sluggard de∣sires and has nothing, but the soul of the di∣ligent shall be made fat. Again, the desire of the faithful killeth him, for his hands re∣fuse to labour, he's alwayes roaring within, <HI>that there's a Lion roaring without.</HI> Ruine is the end of lazy wishes, but he that is dili∣gent in this business shall stand before the Prince of Princes.</P>
<P N="2">2. If thy desires grow and encrease, ha∣ving been attended with success He that gathereth by Labour, shall increase. Holy desires will grow by knowledg and the tea∣chable grace of humility. <HI>Grow in grace,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prov.</HI> 18. 11 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 18.</NOTE> sayes <HI>Peter,</HI> but how? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Answers, by the knowledg of our Lord and Saviour. Yet there is a slated measure to which we are appointed, and can proceed no further, tho we know it not and to whatever point our study is bent, we can know but in part in this life, and therefore Faith of the choicest Believers is but in part on this side glory.</P>
<P N="3">3. If thy desires prove uncessant and impatient till accomplishment and enjoy∣ment,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prov.</HI> 13. 12 <HI>Prov.</HI> 18. 1.</NOTE> then will they prove a tree of life. Thru desire (sayes <HI>Solomon</HI>) a man having separated himself, seeketh and intermedleth with all wisdom. He must alienate from

all impertinen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s, and dedicate himself to the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the work in hand, the matter and end proposed: which is a fair token that a man's in earnest, and will ne∣ver cease till he arrives at his Haven by the fair wind of Providence Desire is a rest∣less affection, and pursues its end against all opposition round the whole Globe. Like a Spring that breaks out at the foot of the high Mountain of Resolution, and quickly spreads to a well, a brook, a river, till at last it unbosome in the vast Ocean. Or like the Morning Star that ushers in the dawning twilight, which gradually ascend∣ing, swells over the Eastern Mountains, and prophecies the bright Suns appearance, who never leaves climbing the horizontal hills till he shines in his lustre, and at last sits down in his Throne in the mid-heaven,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prov.</HI> 4. 18.</NOTE> guarded with Lions. Such is the path of the just, which shineth more and more to the perfect noon day of eternal glory.</P>
<P>But to end, after all considerations of the nature of desires and the meanest state in grace: be but sure and clear that thy Faith is of the right stamp, and your enqui∣ry about the lowest degree of Grace will be rather superfluous, and too full of <HI>c</HI>riti∣cal ambiguities and niceties,</P>

<HEAD>The necessary and inseparable con∣nexion between Sanctification and true FAITH.</HEAD>
<P>WHat I may at present exhibit on this Subject may be comprized under these Heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let's treat a little of the nature of Sanctification,</P>
<P N="2">2. Shew the undivided connexion be∣tween that and Faith.</P>
<P N="3">3. Intermix some complaints about for∣mal Professors.</P>
<P N="4">4. Answer a Case or two and end.</P>
<P>As to the first we may peremptoryly determine the point, that wherever true Faith dwells there must and will be true holiness both in heart and life: and where it <HI>I</HI>s not; that person who pretends to Faith without it, is a self-deceiver, and in his at∣tendance upon Ordinances without life-o∣bedience is but the servant of base hypo∣crisie.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 1.12,&amp;c:</NOTE> Will any dare to tread Gods Courts on sacred dayes, and lift up crimson hand

<P>True Sanctification does not lie in out∣ward solemnities, and the gaudery of Tem∣ple-worship,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jer.</HI> 7. 22.</NOTE> as the Prophet treats the <HI>Jews</HI> in the Name of God: that he <HI>commanded</HI> then <HI>not</HI> concerning Burnt offerings and Sacrifices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6. 20.</NOTE> or the Incense of <HI>Sheba,</HI> or the sweet Cane of <HI>Arabia,</HI> that is, <HI>comparative∣ly,</HI> no nor principally, as he did moral du∣ties of piety and honesty. <HI>To obey is bet∣ter than sacrifice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 15. 22.</NOTE> and to hearken than the fat of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ams.</HI> Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of fed Beasts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mich.</HI> 6. 7.</NOTE> or ten thousand Ri∣vers of Oyl, or the children of our bowels to smoke upon his Altar? no, no!

Will God eat the flesh of Bulls,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 69. 31.</NOTE> or drink the blood of Goats? no! he requires the offerings of praise and thanksgiving, this will please him better than an Oxe, that hath young horns and hoofs:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hos.</HI> 6. 6. <HI>Jos.</HI> 5. 7, 10 <HI>Amos</HI> 5. 25. <HI>Act.</HI> 7. 42. <HI>Mat.</HI> 12. 7. 9 13. <HI>Mark.</HI> 12. 33. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1. 21. <HI>Col.</HI> 3. 10</NOTE> and therefore in cases of mercy, <HI>G</HI>od dispenses with Or∣dinances; as he did with <HI>Israel</HI> in the Wil∣derness, both as to Circumcision and the Passeover for about forty years together: but with Moral duties never. Our Lord bids us therefore to go and learn this point more diligently: For a <HI>Pharisee</HI> may be huge ceremonious<HI>s</HI> with his white linnen about a platter, but yet neglect the weigh∣ty matters of the Law, Justice and Judg∣ment, and Mercy, Whereas true <HI>S</HI>ancti∣fication
<PB N="140" REF="000429_0157_0FA5B1E010C61CF8"/>
is a work of <HI>G</HI>ods <HI>S</HI>pirit, renewing the whole man after the image of God in righteousness and true holiness: whereby he is instructed and inabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in all wayes of <HI>S</HI>cripture obedience, to mind the weighty and principal things of love to God and our Neighbour: and not leave undone those lesser points, which belong to any instituti∣on of <HI>G</HI>od, and not of man.</P>
<P>By this inward work upon the heart, the sanctified person immediately begins the practice of Mortification, in lying to sin, and of rising to newness of life: but yet thi<HI>s</HI> work i<HI>s</HI> not perfectly and compleatly wrought in any person during this life: therefore we must interpret the Apostle in his prayer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 5. 23.</NOTE> that the <HI>Thessalonians</HI> might be sanctified throughout: not in the highest pitch of degrees, but of soundness and sincerity in every part,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 17</NOTE> and member of the new <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>There is a habit of holiness infused, and wrought in the heart by the holy spirit of promise: by which means we are joyned to the Lord, and become one spirit with him.</P>
<P>We do not of our selves first believe, and so receive the spirit of God: this <HI>were</HI> to ascribe the actings of faith to the pow∣er of man, before the infusion of grace: but first the inspiring and inclining moti∣ons of the spirit descend into us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Joh</HI> 3. 8. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 22.</NOTE> whereby we are enabled to believe on the Son, and to become by one Spirit united to him a<HI>s</HI> our head.</P>
<P>All habitual graces are wrought in us seminally at first and at one time: yea Faith

it self as to the order of time is infused to∣gether with the rest in the same moment of our regeneration and sincere conversi∣on to God. Habitual holiness therefore in the production of its blessed fruits and faith among the rest does antedate all the parti∣cular acts of Faith or other <HI>G</HI>races. As in natural Generation all the powers of life are <HI>(insemine concepts &amp; dai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ato)</HI> formed at once:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aristot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. gen animal. l. Pecquet de ve∣nis lacteis</HI></NOTE> but the heart having implanted within it, the true sanguifying virtue be∣comes the <HI>primum vivens &amp; movens,</HI> the first living and moving principle, which is dis∣cerned by its pulsation (like the desires of the Soul in the beginnings of Faith) yet all sensation, attraction, digestion, excretion, fanguification, formation of nervous juices and spirits with locomotion and the rest, are all settled at once; but display their operations afterward at the command of the rational soul. Much like hereunto is the work of the new conception, formation and exertion of spiritual and vital acts.</P>
<P>In the first actings of the Spirit we are passive,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa.</HI> 65. 1.</NOTE> being found of him after whom we sought not at first: but after, that by a con∣nexed power and concourse of the holy spi∣rit, we act and rely on <HI>C</HI>hrist in the pro∣mise of life,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph.</HI> 4, 16: <HI>Col.</HI> 2. 9, 10</NOTE> and receive all the supplies of nourishment from the glorious head of in∣fluence thru' the spirit. Even as the head of the natural body conveys the animal spirits thru' the several conjugations of the nerves into all parts of the body to ma∣nage both sensation and motion. As the Scripture expresses it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isai.</HI> 44. 3. <HI>Mat.</HI> 3. 11. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 11</NOTE> we are sanctified in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and power or of the Lord Jesus

by the Spirit of our GOD.</P>
<P>A<HI>s</HI> to the Author of Sanctification, it is no other than in all gracious work<HI>s,</HI> even God essential, and the spirit of God in his more particular Operation<HI>s</HI> and Applica∣tion<HI>s.</HI></P>

<P>There are, 'tis true, various degrees in moral habits and their actings by the com∣mon work of the Spirit in h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ordinary effi∣cacy: but in many moral person<HI>s</HI> in the state of nature, these moralitie<HI>s</HI> produce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of old, in the Scribe<HI>s</HI> and Pharisee<HI>s,</HI> strong and very vigorous resistance against the more spiritual operation<HI>s</HI> of the holy Spirit of <HI>G</HI>od.</P>
<P N="2">2.

By nature since the fall 'tis true, we incline to distrust God and be∣lieve Satan before him, and in not obeying him intrusting to his Son upon his Word, we give God the un truth: as to the method of salvation by anothers righteousness.

So that Faith in sanctifying us af∣ter the first infusion of grace is a power or vertue co-operating with the spirit of God and enjoys a constant concourse of the same holy Spirit in all our spiritual actions.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another ground may be taken from the conjunct work of the spirit:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>John</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>]</NOTE> who in his very first impulse and motion to true and saving conversion at his coming down into our hearts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>for that purpose, works both Faith and Holiness at the same mo∣ment.</P>
<P N="3">3. Because our blessed Lord came into the World ('tis the end of his advent to us) not only to be the object of our Faith, but to save us from our sins,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 1. 21. <HI>Tit</HI> 2. 14. 1 <HI>John</HI> 3. 8.</NOTE> and Faith must act upon him for that end to purifie and de∣liver us from our iniquities: not only for salvation from hell or wrath to come: but also from the guilt and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'th of sin.

Christ unto good works. Christ gave him∣self to redeem us from all iniquity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph.</HI> 1. 4. <HI>&amp;</HI> 2. 10. <HI>Tit,</HI> 2. 14</NOTE> to pu∣rifie u<HI>s</HI> for a peculiar people, zealous of good works where we may observe justi∣fication and sanctification riding together in the same Chariot. If then all gracious habits be wrought at once, the too much nicety of arguing about the precedency of this or that grace is to be rejected, as not agreeing to the uniform work of the new nature, nor the inward experience of saints whose graces work according to influence, opportunity of providence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12: 11:</NOTE> &amp; the good plea∣sure of the spirit in his assistances, who divi∣deth to every one severally as he will. We may admit somewhat as to congruity of the seeming order of nature or time, but not press such conceptions over strictly for various experiences will contradict the curiosity of such notions. But we may firmly deter∣mine, that the understanding cannot spiri∣tually discern the excellencies of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 2: 14:</NOTE> nor the will of man stedfastly believe in him nor the affections savingly embrace him, till we are first regenerated by Gods most holy Spirit, who is powred out into every fa∣culty and power of the soul at the very first initials of Conversion.</P>
<P N="4">4. Because the Commandments of holi∣ness are part of the object of our Faith in its doctrinal foundation.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 7. 12.</NOTE> Therefore <HI>Paul</HI> in his conflict sets down this as a maxim, that the Law is holy, and the Command∣ment holy, <HI>j</HI>ust and good.</P>
<P N="5">5. Besides, the truth of our Faith is de∣monstrable by holiness as its genuine effect. Its vain for persons to pretend to Faith
<PB N="145" REF="000429_0162_0FA5B1E4988C1E60"/>
where this is wanting, tho' it may not ap∣pear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> at the first. The Apostle <HI>James</HI> spends a large discourse upon this Argument,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ja<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 2. 17.</NOTE> to prove <HI>that Faith without the works of holiness is but a dead Faith.</HI> Indeed our holiness being imperfect does not justi∣fie the person before God, but it justifies the faith of the person to be true: and the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> conjoynes Faith and Holiness together, and thence proves our eternal life.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 2. 13.</NOTE> Blessing God for having chosen the <HI>Thessalonians</HI> to glory, and proves it because they were sanctified by the Spirit, and did believe the truth of the Gospel.</P>
<P N="6">6. Lastly, Because the application of Faith, or the working or actuating of our Faith upon Christ in the promise, doth not only sweetly and clearly manifest our be∣ing justified, but assists us also in the ob∣taining and increasing of holiness.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 1.</NOTE> They walk and work together. For how do the precious promises of the covenant purge us from sin and all filthiness of flesh and spirit, but by the acting faith in Christ, and so do embrace Christ for our sanctification,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 30.</NOTE> and in his name and power derive holiness from those precious promises, which are the golden Pipes or nerves, that convey it from our glorious head. Whence it comes that our belief of the inheritance promised, and of Heavens aimiableness revealed by the Word, and ratified on and by the verity of God: helps us daily to walk more holily and to be made more meet for that King∣dom with the Saints in light. And thus it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Act.</HI> 15. 7 <HI>Lev.</HI> 4 20, 33.</NOTE> that Faith purifies both the heart and life for glory. Even as under the Levitical

So may Faith be an in∣strument in deriving the sense of our justi∣fication, and the sweet influences of our sanctification from our blessed Lord in be∣lieving the sanctifying promises made in his Name, and actuated by virtue of his holy <HI>S</HI>pirit.</P>
<P>Now then, according to that common and useful sentiment: there be two works that attend Sanctity: the first is to mortifie sin: and the second to vivifie and quicken Grace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 11.</NOTE> that we may be holy in all manner of conversation, and this not of our own power either to begin, carry on or finish: but wholly by the work of the Spirit at first, and then by his gracious concourse with every holy action of the new creature to the last, being carried on by the power of God thru' Faith to Salvation. This is so great a Scripture truth, that tis to be admi∣red that the impugners of it, who stand up∣on their own power so much, both as to conversion, and as to perseverance, should be so noted for looseness of life which shews the secret tremendous judgment of God, that such as too much neglect the righte∣ousness of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M<HI>r. Hickman Hist of Armi∣nianism p.</HI> 396.</NOTE> should many times have so little of their own: as tis observed by; a Learned Writer in a short History of such points.</P>
<P>Having thus treated a little about the ne∣cessary conjunction of holiness with Faith, lets exhibit its beautiful face in the follow∣ing

chrystal Glass of Holy Scripture.</P>
<P N="1">1. It principally consists in the inward frame of the heart according to the Will of God, when the image of God does most il∣lustriously shine into it. True Religion and Holiness are fundamentally seated in the heart: all other is but painted false and hipocritical. Bell-Religion is but mocking of God, when lewd men and women run to the Assembly to shew their clothes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prov:</HI> 7: 14:</NOTE> stare upon their goatish paramours, and like the strange woman in the <HI>Proverbs,</HI> pay their peny at the Temple, and then with an im∣pudent face deck their Bed with Tapistry, and perfume it with Spices.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>ver: 16, 17:</HI></NOTE> But true in∣ward holiness excites and instigates persons constantly upon the taming and subduing rather than bridling only their fierce and sensual lusts, and to crown right reason with full power and dominion over their infe∣rior beastly appetites: which is and may be performed genuinely and successfully alone by true grace.</P>
<P N="2">2. Holiness consists in studying and ob∣serving the purity of Gods Worship, pre∣scribed in his Word according to his Will. For what communion can we have with so holy a God;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb.</HI> 12 9. <HI>Exod</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 24. 29. 22. 29 42. <HI>Numb.</HI> 6. 24.</NOTE> in methods formed besides and contrary to his appointment. If earth∣ly Prince<HI>s</HI> will not receive Addresses but according to their own prescriptions, and appoint Masters to order those solemnities: why not much rather be subject to the King of Kings, that Father of Spirits and live, when God had set down all the Ordinances of his Worship to <HI>Moses,</HI> then adds: <HI>there will I come unto you and bless you.</HI></P>

<P>Whoever then, upon the high testimony given to Faith in Scripture shall wax wan∣ton with <HI>G</HI>race,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 6. 1</NOTE> and fancy they are set at liberty to live as they list: such do but trifle with <HI>G</HI>od, and impose upon the purity of his Precepts, &amp; in the end will deceive them∣selves &amp; if repent not fall into the precipice of eternal Damnation.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Assurance of FAITH.</HEAD>
<P>THe nature of Assurance and Method to attain it, is the Subject of this Chapter. In former times, Faith was re∣presented under the notion of assurance,
<PB N="160" REF="000429_0177_0FA5B1F754C761B8"/>
or a Saints particular certainty, that Christ died for his own soul among the rest of Be∣lievers.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0.</NOTE> Like to that special priviledg to which <HI>Paul</HI> prescribes, that Christ loved him and died for him. But now, more diligent observation of Holy Scripture and experience hath cleared up this point; that assurance is the belief,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 1.</NOTE> that we are justified by Faith in Christ and so have peace with <HI>G</HI>od. It i<HI>s</HI> the application of Faith, or a perswasion of our hearts concerning the love of <HI>G</HI>od.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Joh.</HI> 3. 19.</NOTE> When the Spirit of God sets his seal upon our hearts with the im∣pression of the image of Christ as in wax or as the Antients graved the effigies of their Prince<HI>s</HI> on a Cornelian or Opal, or such precious Stones.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph.</HI> 3. 12.</NOTE> It produces a con∣fidence of access by Faith in Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Joh.</HI> 14. 23.</NOTE> and i<HI>s</HI> daily more and more evidenced by the a∣bode of both Father and Son with us: when the ripe <HI>G</HI>rape<HI>s</HI> of <HI>Eshcol</HI> are cast into our bosoms, and Christ himself come<HI>s</HI> in to sup with us.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 20.</NOTE> Assurance shines by a reflex beam of the souls eye upon it self.

Assurance i<HI>s</HI> the cream of Faith when tis settled: its the <HI>joy of Faith</HI> springing in the Soul from the warm healing beams of the Sun of righteousness rising upon its humble val∣leys. <HI>S</HI>ome take Faith to be a trust on the promise for remission of our own sins in particular, or conjoyned with reliance, dependance, adherence and affiance.

of heaven and happiness<HI>s</HI> into the arms of Christ alone; and thence infer the promise to have been made to us in particular, by an immediate consequence drawn from our special and personal application of the in∣definite or more general promise, and ta∣king it as a divine Oracle to us in particu∣lar, and therefore call it special Faith: the promise being thereby assigned to me im∣mediately as certainly as to any in the world, because I have set to my seal, that <HI>G</HI>od is truth, and accepted him upon his Word. When this is done, to wait with joyful expectation, that <HI>G</HI>od will perform it at the day of Christ.

But to leave the first part of this Chapter, and proceed to the second about mean<HI>s</HI> and methods to attain Assurance, which may be performed,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. By Argumentation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. By observation of the Spirits in∣fluences.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>As to Argumentation:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>First,</HI> By Arguments drawn from our having and acting of Faith and the effects of it, we may obtain some measure of this blessed priviledg. Thus [Whosoever be∣lieves in Christ, such a persons sins are par∣doned, and therefore shall be saved. But <HI>I</HI> believe, and therefore <HI>I</HI> shall be saved. The major Proposition is expresly the Word of God, and built upon the rock of eternity. The minor, which is [That <HI>I</HI> believe] must be wrought out and proved by the first Chapter of this Treatise, or any other holy Directions; and then upon examina∣tion is to be found in the sense and experi∣ence of thine own soul: and thence the con∣clusion will irrefragably and undeniably follow with unspeakable comfort and full of glory. Now here a <HI>C</HI>hristian may see, how necessary it is to ponder diligently upon the true nature of Faith, and to understand its inward essence and actings in casting the soul upon <HI>C</HI>hrist, and likewise the di∣stinction of Faith from Assurance, and how assurance may be clearly and firmly built upon a sound and a well-argued sense of its being and acting in the soul. In the Looking-glass of Assurance the soul beholds it self clinging and cleaving to <HI>C</HI>hrist while he is supporting and carrying it over the
<PB N="165" REF="000429_0182_0FA5B1FBDF12B640"/>
stormy Ocean to the haven of glory. It is Faith that seeds the Lamp of Assurance, and Assurance i<HI>s</HI> the Oil which feeds the Lamp of Joy.</P>
<P N="2">2. We may argue the truth of our Faith by the fruits of holiness, and thence in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>err and draw forth Assurance. Because of the unseparable connexion there is be∣tween Faith and holiness;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>John</HI> 1. 7.</NOTE> whoso walks in the light, the blood of Christ cleanseth him from all sin: that i<HI>s,</HI> whoever is san∣ctified, may thence inferr, that he is justi∣fied, and shall be glorified. So <HI>Paul</HI> ar∣gues:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom,</HI> 8. 30. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 10, 11.</NOTE> He that's washed and sanctified, is also justified in the name of the Lord Je∣sus, and shall inherit the Kingdom of <HI>G</HI>od. If we study to walk to all pleasing: we may then give thanks for that we are thereby made meet for the inheritance with the Saints in light.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.</HI>1. 10: 12.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. Again, Grace in exercise is a most evident token of its real existence, and may consequently raise Assurance. If a tree flower fragrntly, 'tis certain it has a root. If a <HI>S</HI>hip be under Sail, and its Top-gallants out, shews its found estate, and make<HI>s</HI> way towards its Ophir. To be strong and swift in motion demonstrates a strong and healthy soul, and is the way to keep it in a happy frame: for exercise conduces to health and Strength. Wa∣ters of great rivers, by their voluble moti∣ons and tides, resist putrifaction and the heavenly bodies by their continual circu∣lations and fiery beams convey their influ∣ences to serve all the sublunary generati∣ons and accretions. Little sparks by a∣gitation,
<PB N="166" REF="000429_0183_0FA5B1FCA6B73588"/>
conceive larger degrees of fire in the application of more combustible mat∣ter and purifie the Air. Artificial imple∣ments, as Locks, <HI>S</HI>aws and Handles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are made brighter by mutual affrication, attrition and use. So do the chariot∣wheels of the soul kindle fire by swift rotation and motion in the ways of holi∣ness, and run flaming towards heaven.</P>
<P N="4">4. We may argue it from the good∣will of <HI>G</HI>od towards us, according to that in the Angelical Song [<HI>peace in earth, and good-will towards men</HI>] peace of conscience on scripture-ground is a certain token of Gods good-will towards us.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euke.</HI> 2. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>But if you ask: But will <HI>G</HI>od pardon me in particular</P>
<P>I Answer, why doubt it?<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5, 20. <HI>John</HI> 3. 33.</NOTE></P>
<P>When as <HI>G</HI>od exhorts, commands and sends his Embassadors to beseech us to be∣lieve him, and rest upon his promise, and not to make him seem to be a deceiver by our unbelief.</P>
<P>Nav, thou and I, and every one, to <HI>whom</HI> the Word of Life doth come, are comman∣ded in particular to believe.</P>
<P>Obj. <HI>I but says the timorous soul, how can I know that he means the promise of life to me?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I Answer, if thou trust him: it will certainly prove so,</P>
<P>For thy accepting, and then relying, and resting on him to perform his promise, makes up the agreement between God and thee.</P>
<P>More of this anon God willing.</P>
<P N="5">5. An interest in the prayer of Christ,
<PB N="167" REF="000429_0184_0FA5B1FD50209DC8"/>
is an assured help to evidence that we are in Covenant, and under electing love.</P>
<P><HI>T</HI>o clear up this we must take our Lords own reasoning before the Father, <HI>I have given them the words thou gaves<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>John</HI> 17. 8. 6. <HI>verse</HI> 14.</NOTE> <HI>and they have received them, and have kept thy word,</HI> and they are hated of the world, because they are not of it. So that if we keep the words or commandments of <HI>C</HI>hrist, and are therefore hated by the world, we may conclude we are hi<HI>s,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>verse.</HI> 9.</NOTE> and under the efficacy of his divine prayer. He praye<HI>s</HI> for them whom the Father gave him out of the world, and not for the world. And left we might say, this concerned the Apostles only, our Lord subjoyn<HI>s: I pray for them also that shall be∣lieve on me through their word.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>verse</HI> 24</NOTE> Wence we may inferr, that all true believers in <HI>Christ</HI> upon the hearing the word of Apostolical Doctrine, are the Subjects of <HI>C</HI>hrists pray∣er. The great end of all is, that at last we may be with him, and see his glory.</P>
<P N="6">6. Learn the blessed art of applying promises<HI>:</HI> this is a sure and certain way to argue out the point of Faith, and to infer assurance. He that can spiritually, apply a promise, ha<HI>s</HI> the Spirit of God, and acts in and by his vertue and instu∣ence. A promise in the reading sparkles and shines; but a promise applyed, com∣forts and warmes. Some noble cordial as <HI>Alchermes,</HI> or that of <HI>Tycho</HI> or some great <HI>Elixir,</HI> if charily set up in a closet or a cabinet of chrystal is an help to the thoughts: but drunk or taken down in a proper vehicle, makes it by divine blessing
<PB N="168" REF="000429_0185_0FA5B1FE0DC5E100"/>
to become actually restorative. Could we repeat all the promises in the Bible, forward and backward, and reduce them upon occasion to proper head<HI>s</HI> and use, and service: yet 'tis special application gives the signative vertue: and therefore I shall endeavour by the help of grace to give in a little aid to this purpose.</P>
<P>First, <HI>Universals contain</HI> particulars of the same kind. Indefinite and unlimited promises are equivalent to universal in a necessary matter. Gods invitation i<HI>s</HI> uni∣versal, hi<HI>s</HI> proclamation extensive to all quarters of the world, to all Regions and Age<HI>s,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 9. <HI>Mark</HI> 10. 49. 16. 15; <HI>col.</HI> 1. 23. <HI>Isa.</HI> 55. 1. <HI>Rev.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. <HI>John.</HI> 3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 1. 37. 1 <HI>cor.</HI> 5 2 <HI>cor</HI> 6, 17. <HI>John</HI> 6. 37.</NOTE> God would have none to perish. <HI>He, every one that thirsteth, and whosoever will, let him take of the water of life free∣ly, and whosoever believeth shall not perish.</HI></P>

If youl come to me, I will in no wise cast you out:</HI> No time, quality, number, or other circumstance of sins set barrs to free∣grace. The promulgation declares the mind and good-will of God, and that if thou in particular accept the proffer of mercy, thou mayst conclude it to be <HI>thine,</HI> Because the inclination of thy will within,
<PB N="169" REF="000429_0186_0FA5B1FEC9E606F0"/>
comes down from God out of heaven, and plainly determines that he is willing to save thee, because thou art willing to close with his grace upon Gospel-terms of holiness<HI>s</HI> and new-obedience:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nke.</HI> 1. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> Thy will is the effect, and therefore the token and e∣vidence of his will to thee, good-will to∣wards men.

<P>Obj. <HI>If any inwardly object their own unworthiness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ. I</HI> answer, it is a most frivolous and impertinent cavil against thy self. For Christ came to save, not the worthy Pha∣risee, but the miserable,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 17. <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. 8. 11.</NOTE> smful and un∣worthy Publican. The Sick need the Physitian and not the whole: and there∣fore come the rather, because poor, mise∣rable, blind and naked. Sin took occasi∣on by the commandment to stay thee: do thou take occasion by sin to run to the promise. Therefore come to Christ, be∣cause lame, tattered torn and wounded, and sick and creeping by the hedg-side▪ The more miserable, the more accepta∣ble; when under the sense of misery, thou comest to so merciful an High-priest and Saviour. The promises of the Gospel are made to no other; if thy case were not miserable, thy coming were to no purpose. The very reason which thou objectest, is the only reason why thou shouldst be encouraged to come, to run and flie to this bosome of mercy. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

It is for his own sake alone, that he blots out our iniquities, not for yours, Indeed he sends his Son, Word, Ministers and his Spirit along with them. He is graciously pleased to call, invite, beseech and command us to believe: he promises rewards, threatens punishments, proffers the use and help of all imaginable means proper to this end. He also by his holy Spirit, moves upon our wills, softens, turns and bends them as he pleases: and by his quickning work stirs up and guides our consciences in all its offices. So that I may say,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 13. 26.</NOTE> as the Apostle to some of old: To you is the Word of this Salvation sent O languishing trembling soul, wouldst thou gladly embrace the promises, and implore his help to do it<HI>?</HI> What canst thou desire more<HI>:</HI> since 'tis hi<HI>s</HI> promise to do this work, and grant this mercy to such petitioners at the throne of grace.

<P N="3">3. If thou wouldest successfully apply the promises, labour to strengthen the habit of Faith by frequent actings of it upon Christ in the Promise.

This is a sweet method to bread love to Christ, and love will raise thee up to some assurance and confidence in hi<HI>s</HI> love. God is love, and his <HI>mercy</HI> to sinners in misery is the fruit of his love, and love springs out of the original goodness in the nature of God:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 33. 18<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 147. 11.</NOTE> who delights in them, that hope in hi<HI>s</HI> mercy and trust in bit love: and when the love of God to us begin<HI>s</HI> to warm our hearts with the inward feeling and tast of it; as the foretast of the Wine of the Kingdom: it encreases Faith, and experience of it advances us into high∣er degrees of love.

<P N="4">4. That so we may particularly apply the promises, call to mind and ruminate
<PB N="174" REF="000429_0191_0FA5B206CD347A58"/>
upon the qualifications mentioned in the promises: and if you can find such graci∣ous inclinations wrought in you by the Spi∣rit of God, then may you humbly deter∣mine your selves to be heir<HI>s</HI> of the promi∣ses. I would not strain hard in the exa∣mination of many great things required in the promises: but if thou canst by a sin∣cere search find in thee a humble broken∣hearted frame: it is a covenant frame: if thou find in thee a penitent fear to sin, a holy trembling at Gods Word, a thirsting after <HI>C</HI>hrist with some sparks of true love to him: tho thou mayest seem to faint under the sense of wrath sometimes; yet if thou resolve in his strength still to thirst after him, and his pardoning love, and to hope for it in his promise; yea and if thou perish, and thy heart-strings break, yet to gasp out thy last at his foot: Thou art the desirable person, the <HI>Daniel,</HI> the man of de∣sires, the <HI>Samuel</HI> the asked of <HI>G</HI>od, the <HI>Nathanael,</HI> the gift of God, without guile, the beloved, the acceptable person, that shall be taken into his bosom for ever. Only and alwayes remember and perfectly con this lesson (I intreat thee in the Lord) that these actings must alwayes be connexed with holiness, as 'tis expresly de∣termined, <HI>Chapt.</HI> 6. and which I do so often recal to mind, and the Lord by his powerful grace enable u<HI>s</HI> to do it: then mayest thou draw forth a perfect lot for the self out of our <HI>Joshuah's</HI> Book of the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> which is above all heavens.</P>

And this moreover I'll say to thee for thy comfort; that tho the hand of thy Faith should shake with some tremblings at pre∣sent, be not dismayed:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat</HI> 9. 2 <HI>Mark</HI> 2. 5 </NOTE> our blessed Lord who spake to the palsie man, both can and will in due time (for thy inward hope is an evidence of it) speak that great strengthening word to the relaxed nerves and sinews of thy Faith:<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 13.</NOTE> <HI>Son be of good theer thy sins be forgiven thee;</HI> for if thou hold but the head, nay if touch but the hem of his garment, virtue will proceed, and thoul't perceive it by some sweet settling quietings of Spirit: as when the dew of heaven fall<HI>s</HI> in a still evening.

<P>Hither to I have spoken some what to the application of the promises, whereby we may argue true Faith, and thence lay a strong foundation for assurance: but before
<PB N="176" REF="000429_0193_0FA5B208AC00D4E0"/>
<HI>I</HI> relinquish this Subject, <HI>I</HI> would touch up∣on the several Arguments used by the A∣postle <HI>John,</HI> which he insists upon in his Epistles, written on purpose for the com∣fort of Believer<HI>s,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1. 4. &amp; 5. 13. 1 <HI>John</HI> 3. 23.</NOTE> that their joy may be full, and that we may know that we have eternal life. To which end, it is <HI>G</HI>ods Commandment to believe in the Son, and to love one another.</P>
<P>Let us then mention the chief in Or∣der:</P>
<P N="1">1. The first evidence of eternal life is drawn from our walking in the <HI>Light,</HI> that is, of holiness, 1 <HI>John</HI> 6 <HI>&amp;</HI> 2 29. <HI>&amp;</HI> 3. 6. 9. walking in the truth, <HI>Epist.</HI> 3 3 in obe∣dience to his Commandments, 1 <HI>John</HI> 2. 3. 5 <HI>&amp;</HI> 3. 24. &amp; 5. 2. 3. &amp; <HI>Epistle</HI> 2. 6. In imi∣tation of Christs holy walking, 1 <HI>John</HI> 2. 6. &amp; 4. 17. and in purifying of our selves ac∣cording to his pattern, 1 <HI>John</HI> 3. 3. and yet all this must be qualified in respect to our infirmities and weaknesses, 1 <HI>John</HI> 1. 8, 9, 10 &amp; 2. 1, 2.</P>
<P N="2">2. The second Argument to prove the truth of grace, and assure our selves be∣fore God, is <HI>love to the Brethren,</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> 2. 9. 10 and chap. 3. 11, 14. &amp; 4. 7, 12. 20. and in his Gospel, <HI>Joh.</HI> 13 35.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third Argument is from our not loving the World, nor the things thereof. 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 2. 15. a<HI>s the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes or the pride of life,</HI> ver. 16.</P>
<P>That is, 1. <HI>Pleasures</HI> of all sorts, as luxu∣ry in Diet, Habit, House<HI>s, G</HI>ardens, ram∣bling about the World without special ends; and all inordinacy and intemperatenes<HI>s</HI> in the body, as <HI>Jerom</HI> uses to express it, <HI>in

ventre &amp; sub ventre.</HI> For they that love Pleasures and Riotings <HI>shall not be rich in purse</HI> saye<HI>s Solomon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prov.</HI> 21. 17.</NOTE> nor in grace, sayes the whole current of Scripture.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The lust of the eye,</HI> which is as to all sorts of covetousness, to get and retain by right or by wrong, in an excessive appeti∣tion of the things of this World, which must be left behind us, and do not, can not fill the heart of man, no nor the eye with satisfaction.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eccles.</HI> 5. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>Nor 3. the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that is, the <HI>Pride of Ambition,</HI> Fastuousness, Honour and advancement into great places, and to be alone in the Earth. These things eager∣ly pursued, eat out the heart and power of godliness.</P>
<P N="4">4. The fourth Argument is assumed from the anointings of their Spirit, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2: 20, 27. &amp; 3. 24 &amp; 4. 13. whereof more by and by God willing.</P>
<P N="5">5. The fifth Argument is taken from a holy and reverent hearing of Gods Mini∣sters, 1 <HI>John</HI> 4. 6. we may know what spi∣rit we are of by this, if we receive Christ: as <HI>Hilary</HI> expresses it, [<HI>Qualis ab Apostolis praedicatus est</HI>] as he was preached by the Apostles and submit to him in all his Offices and Ordinances. Such a one belongs to the spirit, that is of God, that keeps the Doctrine of Christ as the Apostle expounds himself, <HI>Epistle</HI> 2. ver. 9.</P>
<P N="6">6. The last Argument arises from our love to Christ, 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 5. 1. and in him to the Father.</P>
<P>Now if these things be found in us, we shall then overcome the World, 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 5. 4.
<PB N="178" REF="000429_0195_0FA5B20A1462F2C8"/>
and shall not be touched virulently or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tally by Satan, 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 5. 18. shall have ac∣cess to God in prayer. 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 5. 14. and shall have boldness in the day of Judgment; 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 4. 17. and this will so settle our sense of the love of God to us, that it will by de∣grees cast out the torment of fear. For it will allure us to a holy familiarity with di∣vine love,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 4. 18.</NOTE> and so sweeten our thoughts and affections of and to him, that we may begin to enjoy a kind of heaven upon earth, which the Father of his great mercy in Christ grant unto us by the Spirit.</P>
<P>Having hither to treated about Argu∣mentation, I proceed now to the second Head about attaining Assurance, which is by the irradiation of the Spirit of God upon the hearts of Believers. For all is in vain as to gaining of solid and permanent com∣fort, unless the Spirit of <HI>G</HI>od come in and confirm us against the innumerable doubt<HI>s</HI> and cavils that will arise upon us under all our Arguings, because of the subtlety of satan, the natural diffidence of our own hearts, and the clouds that arise from the unholiness of our lives, and the dread of eternity. I design therefore to treat a lit∣tle while about the witness of the spirit, his immediate breathings, his bright shi∣nings, and as it were speakings within our hearts, when a holy soul hath this witness in himself.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 5. 10. 2. Cor. 1. 3. <HI>Act.</HI> 10. 44.</NOTE> For in aud upon believing, the Father of Lights and of all consolations sends in his own due time, this his holy spi∣rit like a dove of peace into our hearts, who helps us to discern the truth of the work of grace. [After ye believed sayes the
<PB N="179" REF="000429_0196_0FA5B20C59538928"/>
Apostle, ye were sealed with the holy spi∣rit of promise.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph</HI> 1: 13.</NOTE> He is sometimes set forth by a <HI>Seal</HI> and a <HI>Witness</HI> to the bond of the <HI>C</HI>ovenant by a <HI>Seal</HI> and an <HI>Earnest</HI> to the contract about the inheritance:<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 22.</NOTE> by a <HI>Seal</HI> and a <HI>Love-Token</HI> or an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, a word used of old to note Tokens sent before Mar∣riage, and to be sure, God will not lose his earnest, not be sure, God will not lose his earnest, nor be defeated of the fore to∣ken<HI>s</HI> of his contract of love to souls: some∣times the Spirit is compared to fire, and yields both <HI>the light of joy, the heat of love</HI> and <HI>influences or quicknings for service.</HI> And 'tis this lively Faith, which works by love effectually thru' the Spirit</P>
<P>But <HI>I</HI> would speak a little more distinct∣ly; for the observation and the experience of holy men hath set to their seals, that they do find and feel sometimes a most il∣lustrious irradiation upon their hearts from the Spirit of God: which <HI>I</HI> take to be of two sorts:</P>
<P>The 1. We may call an irradiation of concurse with our spirits.</P>
<P>The 2. An irradiation of incidence up∣on our spirits. <HI>G</HI>ive leave to use the terms and explain them to the meanest.</P>
<P>The First or the irradiation of <HI>concurse</HI> is then dispensed when he shines upon our Argumentation: when we have laboured with our spirits, used Scripture mediums, and upon examination suited them to our hearts in their most inward sincere and humble searches; then comes the spirit of <HI>G</HI>od, and witnesses with our spirits that we are the children of <HI>G</HI>od. When we have toiled and sweat many a time in our closets
<PB N="180" REF="000429_0197_0FA5B20C972E7A90"/>
and brought things as we hope sometime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to a pritty good issue; then thru' one ten∣tation or another our unbelieving hearts fly off from the Conclusion and all our com∣fort vanishes. But now, when our argu∣ing<HI>s</HI> by evident <HI>S</HI>cripture tokens are finisht over and over; and yet still we demurre to lay hold on the Tree of life, and while we stick in the mire of fear, doubting and hesitancies, and wander under dark clouds in the depth of midnight, then comes in the spirit of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 16.</NOTE> as the Morning <HI>S</HI>tar, glit∣tering over the Horizon and clears all. This is the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or the co∣witness of the Spirit of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. The other is that which I beg leave from a term in <HI>Opticks,</HI> to call the irradia∣tion of incidence, and is then illustriously performed, when the Spirit of <HI>G</HI>od in his most free and glorious agency is pleased to shine personally upon our spirits, without and apart from all argumentation whatso∣ever. This comunion with the spirit <HI>draws nigh</HI> to that of Angelical intuition; where by acts of volition and luminous emanati∣on they converse mutually together in a higher degree than we do here by ratio∣cination with mediums and consequences.</P>
<P>This is the point we are now upon, to shew that the Spirit of <HI>G</HI>od (when he pleases) without any previous foregoing arguments doth testifie by a secret, still, heart-ravishing voice,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 2. 2. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> and doth sweetly and suddenly (as 'tis said in the <HI>Acts</HI>) dart in a ray, perswading and sati<HI>s</HI>fying the soul in an instant; that thou art a Child of God, that sin is pardoned, and
<PB N="147" REF="000429_0198_0FA5B20D1EEAAC40"/>
that thou shult be saved. Which I re∣member the <HI>British Divines</HI> at <HI>Dort</HI> call the Spirits speaking to the heart, and even in darker times, there were some of the Il∣luminate both of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> and <HI>France</HI> that had to do, I am perswaded with many distrssed souls in their secret con∣fessions, &amp; were acquainted with great wor∣knigs in the hearts of penitents, but few of them had skill to manage those inward methods.</P>
<P>Of which things we may find some notable footsteps in <HI>Bonaventure, Gerson, Thanlerus,</HI> and sundry others.</P>
<P>So that of this inward, clear and bright perswasion of Gods love to the heart, we have no solid reason to doubt; but that some holy persons have enjoyed it. <HI>Au∣stin</HI> at his conversion in the garden at <HI>Mil∣lain</HI> had a voice, though he had no visi∣on, as <HI>Paul</HI> had in the fields by <HI>Damascus.</HI></P>
<P>I shall be sparing, and touch but an instance or two.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Manton</HI> spake it in my hearing, at <HI>Oxon,</HI> of one that being in conflict in prayer, had a beam shining into the cham∣ber, and being desired by him to have a care of delusion; answered, O Mr. <HI>Man∣ton,</HI> little do you know what God may do for his poor distressed children, or very like words.</P>
<P>But the caution was wife and grave.</P>
<P>I know one also, who being for almost a week deeply distressed about Eternity, had an impression as like a voice within, as if he heard it, comforting in these
<PB N="182" REF="000429_0199_0FA5B2BC9847E588"/>
words [<HI>I will give thee rest</HI>] and so it followed speedily and joyfully: and at a∣nother time: [<HI>I will not leave thee nor forsake thee.</HI>]</P>
<P>I might also hint at the beam upon the wall in prayer to Dr. <HI>Winter</HI> in his life, and the voices of Angels to <HI>Mr. Patrick Simpson.</HI></P>
<P>I must confess, they are great priviled∣ges and sweetnesses, which <HI>G</HI>od may in his divine good pleasure, and I am per∣swaded doth sometimes instil and drop in∣to gracious, when timorous hearts, and whose constitutions the great former of hearts and spirits knows full well to be naturally over subject to fears and inward commotions: he like a most gracious and Tender Father, full of pity and bowels, discerns our frames.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See Mr. Ma∣thers prevalen∣cy of prayer Psal.</HI> 103. <HI>p</HI> 17 14 <HI>at the end of his Tract of N. S. troubles.

And are like lamps despi∣sed in the thought of him that is at ease. But says <HI>David</HI> though I am poor and needy, yet the Lord thinketh upon me, and with how many precious thoughts his goodness is pleased to embroider and en∣amel upon the hearts of his holy, hum∣ble, meek and trembling children [For your high exalted, boasting person<HI>s,</HI> tho' it may be have some few grains of grace at bottom, are seldom visited with these inward joyes] <HI>But the meek will he teach his mays.</HI> Such blessed thoughts of grace <HI>David</HI> could not number,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ps.</HI> 139. 17, 18</NOTE> they were more
<PB N="183" REF="000429_0200_0FA5B2BD4FC8E0D8"/>
than the Sands of the Sea, or the stars of heaven for multitude.</P>
<P>But now if these of such like lines <HI>should</HI> fall under the view or knowledg of any prophane or scoffing <HI>Ishmael</HI> that may vilifie the works of <HI>G</HI>od, and like bruits speak ignorantly of what they know not: I would advise them to forbear presump∣tuous speeches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 12. <HI>Jude</HI> 10.</NOTE> lest their bonds be made strong, lest the Terrors &amp; horrors of the Almighty should one day drink up their spi∣rit<HI>s.</HI> So that when Gods Servants shall rejoyce and sing for joy of heart, they shall cry for sorrow of heart and howl for vexation of spirit.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isai.</HI> 65. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>But yet, because there may be such things as Enthusiasme<HI>s</HI> and transformation of Angels of darkness among some that call themselves <HI>S</HI>weet-fingers: and among others that have more need to mourn o∣ver their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and delusions in the dust of shame. I would speak some what to that question of an humble Soul.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>How may I comfort my heart, that this irradiation you speak of is a true and im∣mediate work of the Spirit of God, and no delusion?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> In answer to thi<HI>s,</HI> I must first in all manner of humble modesty declare, that <HI>I</HI> would not dare to meddle too far with such deep and mysteriou<HI>s</HI> workings and influences, only professing with all thankfulness to the Majesty of divine mer∣cy; that having had some glimpse<HI>s</HI> of hope a little sometimes, and thirsting after some further and clearer helps from heaven, we faint not utterly: but striving after, to at∣tain

towards the resurrection of the dead, crave leave to set down somewhat, that <HI>I</HI> hope may be a clue to conduct us out of the Labrinth, and maze of delusion</P>
<P>The first and best token, that these are no deceits, can only arise from the spirit himself. According to that saying of holy <HI>Iohn.</HI> It is the Spirit that beareth witness, that the Spirit is truth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>John</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 6: <HI>Whitak. de.

In <HI>thy light we shall see light:</HI> and they look∣ed to him and their faces were enlighten∣ed. This is the apprehension of learned graciou<HI>s</HI> persons, that the spirit of God never speaks by this his inward heavenly voice; but that he graciously helps them to know that it is no delusion: but that it is he, even the spirit himself that spea∣keth to them. This phrase of speaking to the heart, and in and upon the heart, is more visible in the Original Hebrew of the Old Testament, and was well known to the Prophets of old, and is much treat∣ed upon among Jewish Antiquiarie<HI>s.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 19</NOTE> Out of whom I must not here stand to enlarge but call to mind what the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> mentions of the Day-star arising in our hearts, so that it is as clear (when the spi∣rit of God does thus shine and testifie) yea and more radiant, than the Sun at Noon-day without clouds.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> shall say no more to this, but what our Lord to the Angel at <HI>Pergamus,</HI> of them

<P N="2">2. I need say little more, but that <HI>wher∣ever</HI> the <HI>S</HI>pirit doth so illustriously speak and shine: it is concomitant with growing in holiness. For this most holy Spirit of <HI>G</HI>od is still a building and increasing in such the works of holiness, they are of a heavenly frame, rivers of holy discourse flow from their lips in prudent seasons; they are not vain and trifling spirits: but <HI>grave</HI> and serious, and yet chearful. For the joy of the Lord is their strength, and they have inward delights, and value not the cracklings of fool<HI>s.</HI> Divine joy is a weigh∣ty thing, and yet greatly upholds the spi∣rits, and sustains their griefs and infirmities. If you come into their company by a blessed accident, as they say of the <HI>A∣depti</HI> in Philosophy, there's a glittering star shines from their converse &amp; society.</P>
<P N="3">3. They are the most humble persons living. For the humble he will teach his way,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 25. 9.</NOTE> and shew his Covenant, I <HI>know they</HI> may fail sometime<HI>s,</HI> and othertimes have need of a little holy courage against despi∣sers; But the main of their conversation is like them, of whom the spirit of <HI>G</HI>od says, they took notice of them that they had conversed with Jesus,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 4 13.</NOTE> who was meek and lowly: if we imitate him, we shall find this rest; and remember that <HI>Moses</HI> the meekest man had the greatest inter∣views with God in the Mountain. Such as are given to much prate and length of idle impertinent discourses are seldom
<PB N="286" REF="000429_0203_0FA5B2C594C663D0"/>
and little or never acquainted with the Spirit of <HI>G</HI>od.</P>
<P N="4">4. They are also the sweetest persons, and fullest of love, though sometime<HI>s</HI> pro∣vokt by fierce &amp; evil spirits about them, but if their natural tempers had been be∣fore somewhat eager and sharp: yet now they are washed, purged, whitened and sweetned by the Spirit of God. Tender to the Tempted, kind to the afflicted, pi∣tiful to all: bear every ones burden with a gracious frame: onely they are taught by the holy Spirit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>cor</HI> 23 4. 5.</NOTE> as to such as prate with maliciou<HI>s</HI> words against them to imitate holy <HI>John,</HI> not to succum be under a proud <HI>Diotrephes:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">3 <HI>John</HI> 9.</NOTE> but loves a child of God as such with the full stream of his Spirit. And this love to the brethren is much more to Christ himself, being fil∣led with the love of the Spirit which by degrees cast out the torments of fear,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>John.</HI> 4. 18,</NOTE> and gives a blessed confidence as to the Appearing of the Day of Judgment.</P>
<P>To end this, we must remember, that the holy Spirit of God doth never witness or illustrate apart from the Word.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa</HI> 8, 20.</NOTE> <HI>I</HI>f any light in you, try it by the Word and Testimony, and hence that as Tentation<HI>s</HI> and afflictions sanctified, so the manifesta∣tion<HI>s</HI> and communions of the Spirit help us to understand holy Scriptures and pro∣mises by experience,</P>
<P>Let us then be sure as far as possible, that the person that pretends to be thus illustrated, prove himself to be an holy person in heart and deed, or else all's like a puft and swoin delusion, and such an one
<PB N="187" REF="000429_0204_0FA5B2C64B2D1580"/>
must lie down in sorrow. For the Spirit of <HI>G</HI>od is a most holy spirit, and never seals but as he is, the holy Spirit of Promise, upon the holy heart of an holy child of God.</P>
<P>Well then to end this second part of the Spirits illustration.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph</HI> 1, 3. <HI>Rom</HI> 8. 16. 1 <HI>John</HI> 4. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>I</HI> say it is not meant of the <HI>S</HI>pirit of God concurring or witnessing with our spirits in the point of assurance, clearing up our doubts, dispelling the mists and clouds uponour spirits: But it is an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or like an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a bright shining Ray, a most illustrious beam streaming down from heaven into the inmost cham∣bers of our hearts, and is an act distinct and apart from his former blessed con∣curse with our spirits in time of argu∣mentation or the gracious application of the promises for our peace and comfort: it is an irresistable evidence of divine love,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See Dr Owen of the spirit</HI> 167<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> scattering all the clouds of diffidence and distrust in that very moment; and when this immediate irradiation flows in, though it may be a distinct act from that upon argumentation; yet it cannot be to∣tally severed from it, because in thi<HI>s</HI> glo∣rious light, though we may see further; yet cannot but see any argument, <HI>we think</HI> meet to touch upon, to be also illustrated by it: as the Moon in her increases may be seen in the heavens like a cloud in the day time, which also has its light from the Sun, while he is yet shining bright within our hemisphere at the same time: and when these come together, they make heavenly work indeed.</P>

That these blessed visits have been som∣times, tho rarely, afforded yet to some few, besides <HI>Patriarks</HI> and Apostles, <HI>I</HI> have no cause to doubt, whatever some Ponti∣ficians have said to the contrary, to darken it. The Holy Scriptures clear it, expe∣rience doth witness it, and seal it in the hearts of some meek, humble, self-deny∣ing, mortified and holy walking persons, who having lived a while in the light of Gods countenance, have afterward gone to heaven in a <HI>C</HI>hariot of Triumph.</P>
<P>Having now spoken what concerns this excellent point, and observing that these Orient Jewels are such grand raritie<HI>s,</HI> and having placed them in the middle like a Diamond set in ouches of Gold; give leave to descend again from the <HI>S</HI>pouse<HI>s</HI> Tower of <HI>Lebanon</HI> into the Plains of <HI>Damascus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Song.</HI> 7. 4,</NOTE> and walk again in the pleasant Gardens at the foot of the hill where streams flow with the comfortable Doctrines of Assurance.

2. By His sweet pleading our evidences within us, when we find a kind of divine holy force put as it were upon our spirits to determine comfortably, and witness to the Spirit's work, not being able to deny some grace to be in us, when strongly urged and put to it by some intimate and gracious, faithful Friend.</P>
<P N="3">3. By His discovering our graces to us in times of tentation and conflict,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> yea, and in <HI>C</HI>ommunion at the Lords Table, and in Meditation.</P>

<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> Now by the order prescribed in the beginning of this <HI>C</HI>hapter. I should pro∣ceed to the third Branch, and that is to treat or some Rules to clear up our Assu∣rance.</P>
<P>I Answer to thi<HI>s,</HI> that herein I have even prevented my self, and therefore shall at present only add, that these Particulars fol∣lowing may be of use.</P>
<P N="1">1. A watchful care of a holy heart.</P>
<P N="2">2. To observe the inward workings and issues of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. To be careful in cleansing and wash∣ing of the first risings of sin in the Laver of Sanctification.</P>
<P N="4">4. To labour a holy attendance upon,
<PB N="190" REF="000429_0207_0FA5B2C989B53AC0"/>
and a spiritual delight in the addresses, in∣comes, comforts, and sealings of the Spirit that we may discern and rejoyce in them,</P>
<P N="5">5. An earnest invoking the Father to send the comforter in his assuring work upon a sanctifying progress;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>John</HI> 14. 24.</NOTE> for then he proves a comforting Spirit, after he hath been a sanctifying Spirit. He first comes to us as the Holy <HI>G</HI>host, and then as the Com∣forter: tho the foundation of both be laid at once, yet the appearances are successive.</P>
<P>But I hope to add more in answer to the Questions by and by, only I would first set down a passage about assurance out of that grave Writer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hooker in his Polity, in his Life before it.</HI> P. 17.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> which I hope may be of use to some of his perswasion as well as other<HI>s;</HI> and 'tis to this purpose:</P>
<P>[There's a certainty of <HI>Evidence</HI> and of <HI>Assurance,</HI> grant that the weak in Faith en∣joy not certainty of Assurance, because they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not: but are they not grieved for it, wish and strive it may be otherwise. Whence comes this, but from a secret love and liking that they have to those things which they believe to have. Because no man loves those things, which in his own opinion are not, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Therefore love and desire to believe, is Faith. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thinketh that things believed, are, (that is <HI>have a being</HI>) without Faith. Which Ar∣guments (sayes he) all the subtleties of infernal powers will never be able to dis∣solve.] Thus far he: to which let me, joyn, that since Faith of evidence (as be∣ing the foundation work) is therein more excellent than the Faith of Assurance, as be∣ing the superstructure (tho I had rather
<PB N="191" REF="000429_0208_0FA5B2CA15CA6E20"/>
call it in Scripture terms the <HI>Assurance of Faith,</HI> since Assurance properly as I have often said is a distinct thing from Faith: tho common speech hath prevailed to make such a distinction; as if they were proper Members or Branches of true Faith. But let that pass, I say, if Christians would a∣rise to high Assurance, they must lay their foundation strong and deep in the rock of evidence upon Christ himself. Evidence flows from a <HI>direct</HI> act; Assurance from a <HI>reflect:</HI> the one is like the view of the Suns body in the heaven, the other like his refle∣ction in the water, or on a Looking glass. Now all reflect rayes are weaker than the direct, and the reverse than the incident. But I speak not here of the Spirits work, and its most illustrious evidence: but of our workings upon the actings of our Faith. As to which the stronger our applications are to Christ, the stronger and more com∣fortable will be the reflections upon them. For both rayes, the nearer the reverse and incident are in union, as in the depth of Summer, the heat and influence is the more strong and fervent, and so 'tis here:</P>
<P>But now it is high time to hearken to some Questions which troubled Soul<HI>s</HI> may bring in.</P>
<P>Quest. 1. The first Question may be: <HI>How may I be assured of the pardon of my sins, and consequently of Salvation?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> In answer to this, I shall lay down some Rules to clear it, which was the third thing premised in the beginning of this Chapter.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="192" REF="000429_0209_0FA5B2CADF07C190"/>
1. Forsaking of sin, with a holy endea∣vour to mortifie and subdue it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prov.</HI> 28. 13. <HI>Mic.</HI> 7 19. <HI>Rom</HI> 8. 13.</NOTE> is a special sign of mercy.</P>
<P N="2">2. When after darknes<HI>s</HI> and conflicts, a begun renovation of life with a sincere care to continue it, is attended with some spring∣ings of peace in conscience with God, this will prove an excellent token. For the blood of sprinkling upon the conscience speaks better than <HI>Abel</HI>'s blood:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb.</HI> 12. 24.</NOTE> That cried out for condemnation; this for reconcilia∣tion with God.</P>
<P N="3">3. When we find some sweetness in our admissions to the Throne of <HI>G</HI>race. When our eye up to the Throne affects our heart at the threshold of <HI>G</HI>ods Sanctuary. When a bended knee and a melting heart work together. Then we may ask of God what ever we will, if according to his will: the precepts and the promises being the rule of asking. We have a most free access to plead the promises both of this and the life to come,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph.</HI> 3. 12. <HI>Heb.</HI> 4. 16. 1 <HI>Tim</HI> 4 8.</NOTE> so that by holy degrees and steps we may arrive to further humble confi∣dence of divine mercy.</P>
<P N="4">4. When we feel some gracious risings of love to God, as pardoning our iniqui∣ties for <HI>C</HI>hrists sake, and tho we do not so fully and sweetly feel it as we would: yet our hearts do pant and long after it. This is a true sign of Love.</P>
<P>But yet to clear it a little, the humble soul will ask,</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>How shall I know that I love God?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans:</HI> I answer, Of all the affections that spring and bubble out of the will, this is
<PB N="193" REF="000429_0210_0FA5B2CB9ED75ED8"/>
most easily to bediscerned and known. Do you know the Sun, when you see him walk in brightness, do you know that you live by the actings of the senses and the pulsation of your arteries: or do you know that you walk when you move your feet, and feel your motions from place to place? you may as certainly know your affections and the workings of your Soul. This distin∣guishes men from Bruits in the acting of their reason upon all they do, and in mana∣ging end<HI>s</HI> and means. The affections spi∣ritually beating, are the pulsations of the regenerate heart. Observe then your Ob∣jects: if you love the things above, better than all below;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.</HI> 3. 2. <HI>Isal.</HI> 73. 25.</NOTE> in your choice and pre∣ference, tho sometimes under some ebb<HI>s</HI> and eclipse<HI>s:</HI> yet still you find an inward regard to God and his glory: and that you perform every action <HI>in ordine ad Deum,</HI> and love all as to the inward sincerity of your heart:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 31.</NOTE> and enjoy every relation with some desire to work up your mercies to∣wards God in thankfulness and usefulness. These are good tokens that you are risen with Christ by Faith, and that your life is hid with <HI>G</HI>od in him, and that by continued degrees of Sanctification, you shall at last arrive to this, even to appear with him in Glory.</P>
<P N="4">4. But that I may at length wind out of this delightful Labyrinth in discoursing a∣bout Assurance; Let us hearken to the se∣cond Question, wherein the Soul being somewhat revived does now start the fourth Particular at the beginning; and that is,</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="000429_0211_0FA5B2CC5C95D348"/>
Quest, 2. <HI>How may I preserve and retain Assurance when it is gained?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The reason of this Question arises not only from hence, because the sweet sense of divine love is a most desirable frame of Spirit, and fills the soul to the brim with joy and peace in the Holy Ghost; and besides renders persons very service∣able and greatly honours Religion: But also because,</P>
<P N="1">1. Many gracious persons that have true Faith, yet labour under deep fears of Hypo∣crisie, arising from their pious Education, not answered by proportionable holiness. It puts great jealousies in their hearts, that all they have done, is but a forced work, and a habit of formality; attracted from the precepts of godly Ministers and Pa∣rents, instilling into an inlightned consci∣ence the frightful form of an outward conversation consonant: and therefore fear at a strange rate that their diamonds are but as it were from the soft Rock of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> their Gold, but Alchymy, their Faith but fained and temporary.</P>
<P>But be not discouraged: For that Faith is true and unfeigned, which proceeds from a pure heart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 5, 19.</NOTE> and a good conscience, that is, without fraud and guilt, in setting it na∣ked and open before God,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Act</HI> 24. 16.</NOTE> in labouring and exercising to keep a good conscience in sight of God and Men. You may then re∣joyce in the testimony of such a conscience, having been upright before him in the main bent of the soul,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 18. 23.</NOTE> and in keeping from your own iniquity.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="000429_0212_0FA5B2CD1BD9B320"/>
What tho thou didst not come in with such remarkable pangs; no more did <HI>Za∣cheus</HI> nor <HI>Lydia.</HI> Tis not the manner but the truth of our coming in to Christ, is the great point, if thou constantly adhere to the Lord with full purpose of heart.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Act.</HI> 11. 23.</NOTE> Nay, what if there were some errors at first, this puts no bar, if the root of the matter be in thee. The Apostles followed our Lord at first in some hopes of preferment in the temporal Kingdom of the Mossiah: but at length understood the Doctrine of the <HI>C</HI>rosse better, which God in great ten∣derness is pleased to vail from young con∣vert<HI>s</HI> at first, or at least preserve them from suffering till they are strengthened, and then like the Apostles they still cleave to, and continue with the Lord under all trials by the exceeding power of his might. And thus a<HI>s</HI> I remember,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Crakenthorp of the sixth Coun∣cil, P.</HI></NOTE> Dr. <HI>Crakenthorp</HI> in defending of <HI>Cyprian</HI> and <HI>Jerom</HI> against some pontificians imputing some errors to them, the better to vindicate their <HI>Liberius</HI> answers; that if they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, they did it not willingly, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ready to reform up∣on the first approach of Scripture light, and conviction. Tis so in our case, they are ready with that holy man <HI>to</HI> pray, <HI>what I see not, teach the name.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Job</HI> 34 32.</NOTE> The mind and will of God is the perfect square, rule, canon and compass of all their actions: and tho they may fail three' weaknes<HI>s,</HI> yet never thru' wilfulness.</P>
<P>Wherefore be not out of heart, O ten∣der and trembling soul, let not go your hope and confidence, because you have not had so long and such bitter pangs in the
<PB N="196" REF="000429_0213_0FA5B2CDD2751900"/>
new birth; that makes the work the har∣der, but not the truer. A child may be born sometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> greater case and speed. Great horror<HI>s</HI> may attend great sinners, and yet after all their heavy con∣victions may stick in the birth and never be truly converted, till they are truly and perseveringly reformed: which indeed cuts the work short and makes the evidence clear. If thou hast been under a gentler hand from God, bless him with louder Songs of praise. For the shorter and sweeter the method, the greater is, the mer∣cy: and as one said, <HI>A young Saint may make an old Angel.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This question begs a full answer: because, though want of Assurance does not denote an unbeliever, yet it keeps a true believer under the dark shade<HI>s</HI> of fear and sorrow. Assurance besides, in the best of Saints is but an imperfect work, because our Faith it self is but im∣perfect: we see but in part, because we do but trust in part. If our Faith do at any time waver and stagger,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.</HI> 2. 2.</NOTE> assurance <HI>must</HI> needs qviven and shake. It's true, there's mention made of the riches of full Assu∣rance: but that's comparative in respect to some Saints, and mentioned as attain∣nable with full sweetness, and may possi∣bly for the main, continue pretty constant, especially in very acti<HI>v</HI>e and suffering Saints, yet 'tis not without ebb<HI>s</HI> and bus∣setings in the best.</P>
<P>There are but few that walk in the mountain of Sun-shine all their lives; as 'tis said of <HI>Zabarel</HI> the Philosopher, when
<PB N="197" REF="000429_0214_0FA5B2CE9AF55248"/>
one day in his study upon an high hill near <HI>Padue;</HI> he enjoyed the bright and warm beams, while it rained all day, in the vally, and he himself saw the dark and heavy clouds under the hill. Few be like to <HI>Moses,</HI> to whom it<HI>s</HI> granted to walk on the top of <HI>Pisgah,</HI> till they dye. Wherefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Pet</HI> 1. 3.</NOTE> such as have once obtained Assurance and a lively hope of glory: blame them not, if they are very desirous to preserve, increase, and imbellish it more and more. For since Assurance may be lost for a season, a<HI>s</HI> it was in <HI>David, Heman</HI> and <HI>Peter,</HI> and as in the case of that wounded deserted soul that askt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> once, Was ever any soul in so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a case as I? Yes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Clears Lives</HI></NOTE> says that great and skilful comfortor of a wounded con∣science, Christ on the Cross was in as sad a case, when he cried out of the Fathers forsaking him: <HI>I</HI> think it therefore most meet to subjoyn some rules with divine help, to maintain and preserve it.</P>
<P N="1">1. Take heed of what impairs and dar∣kens assurance, as the defect of quickning influences: against that, pray for the sup∣plies of the <HI>S</HI>pirit. If it rise from a weakness of judgment, read more, medi∣tate more, and cry after knowledg as for hid treasure. If the seriousness of your spirits be hurt by minding vanities and the rattles of pride and finery, and over∣valuing the trifles of this world; Pray for a more noble and judicious and gene∣rous frame, and judg of all worldly mens Jewel<HI>s,</HI> as indeed the word (<HI>jocalia</HI>) im∣ports; as so many whistles and hobbies
<PB N="198" REF="000429_0215_0FA5B2CFB8DD05A8"/>
for children to play with. If thou hast lost thy comforts by neglect of holy walk∣ing, take heed hereafter of damping thy joyes by froth and foolishness. Take heed of a vain heart,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prov.</HI> 10. 19,</NOTE> of vain and manifold words, and especially fiery tongues, wher∣in <HI>Solomon</HI> says, there wants not sin, and of vain converse with their apish and childish tales and jests which are not convenient, and tend to corrupt the mind by deceitful lusts <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph.</HI> 5.4</NOTE>. These things will blot thy eviden∣ces, and quench the <HI>S</HI>pirit of God. Pray that God would not lead thee by his pro∣vidence into tentations. <HI>I</HI>f thou wouldst have the Lord to know or acknowledge thee for hi<HI>s,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 19.</NOTE> depart from all iniquity, and that will prove the foundation to be sure. Keep the divine commands, though you find mixtures of weakness, yet in an holy fear and love to the purity of the precept,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 101. 2. 112. 1. 2 <HI>Tim</HI> 1. 17 2 <HI>John</HI> 2 3. <HI>&amp;</HI> 4. 13.</NOTE> labour to walk in your house with a perfect heart. For we may be sure, that we know him, and be humbly con∣fident that he is our <HI>G</HI>od in Covenant, if we keep his Commandments.</P>
<P N="2">2. When under great darkness (for eve∣ry stitch we must not run to a Doctor) repair to your faithful Interpreter, that may reveal and open to a man his righ∣teousness:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> some blessed soul that<HI>s</HI> higher in acquaintance with heaven, then your self, as you may humbly judg, some ex∣perienced christian, some faithful, grave and prudent friend, no babler, nor revea∣ler of secrets, nor scoffer at the wor∣kings of the Spirit, as if enthusiasmes; he is an unjudiciou<HI>s</HI> person: and if you
<PB N="199" REF="000429_0216_0FA5B2D253BC0468"/>
cannot well wrestle out the point your self; but still your soul droop<HI>s</HI> and drives in the mire, and no light of joy comes in: then open your soul to some prudent friend and give him leave, nay intreat him to search out the coare, and conscientiously follow his advice, and it may prove a most happy day to your soul by comparing mu∣tual experiences: yet remember in mat∣ters of weight, that might prove a scan∣dal, if he should not be wise and faithful, be very cautious of discovering; what thou shouldst only pour out before the Lord.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isal.</HI> 142. 2.</NOTE> For if he be of a weak envious spirit, and once used to speak evil of friends behind their backs, use him not, hell prove a foo∣lish serpent, and double your misery.</P>
<P N="3">3. Judge not thy grace always by its flowers, but search out its sap and root. One may be a well spread and weighty christian, and yet not flower in much dis∣course. The flowers of some trees fall off quickly, and never set in to much visible fruit, and some have no flowers at all as the fig, and yet yield<HI>s</HI> a wholsome and pleasant fruit. 'Tis so with some choice and serious christians, you shall not hear them talk much, unless you pump and draw out the spirits by questions I like them the better. For the little they produce is usually much to purpose and of good weight. Yea further you may, if critical, observe, that the graces of good men may vary in fruit, and have their different seasons, but never alter their grain or root. <HI>G</HI>race may lie hid as the corn under ground after first Sowing:

yea after 'tis come up, may bow and hide its green head under a flight of show. And when there's least of sense or present experience, yet the root of Faith like strong winter-corn, may grow more in∣ward and downward, being covered and kept under by pinching North-east blasts, and sharp black frosts; till it recover head by an early Spring. <HI>S</HI>o indeed, the pow∣er and strength of grace is best seen and discerned, when it persists and stands its ground under a shock of tentations, and adversitie<HI>s.</HI> At length the Sun will return Northward, and the sharper the past win∣ters were, theyl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> make the new spring the pleasanter.

<HEAD>THE Epilogue Or Conclusion, in some <HI>Corol∣laries or Deductions from the precedent Discourse: tho cut short in a great measure, con∣trary to my desire and inten∣tion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe main body of this Treatise being finished, thought meet to draw some useful dedications for profit and de∣light.</P>
<P N="1">1. The first that may arise is, That if true Faith be the only means to Salvation thru Christ, then natural reason is Insufficient to guide us in the way to Heaven. Not that the true use of reason should be laid aside in drawing Logical or Rational con∣sequences from Scripture Assertions: but we must not use it to lay down Principles and Axioms founded and grounded only upon the light of nature: which is not
<PB N="210" REF="000429_0227_0FA5B2DF0A4FFFD8"/>
furnisht with ability to dive into the won∣ders of <HI>G</HI>ods love, or the deep mysteries of his Gospel in order to Salvation. If it were (since the Ship-wrack of humane nature) capable to work such effects; what then needed the Revelation of a <HI>Sav</HI>iour; and why hath the Church of <HI>G</HI>od thought meet to comprehend the Doctrine of life in Creeds or short System<HI>s</HI> of points purely and meerly to be believed. Fare∣well all Articles and Confessions of Faith, and in truth all our Bibles: if reason were the only Cynosure or Polestar to direct us to the haven of happiness. But blessed be <HI>G</HI>od, he hath infused better thoughts into us, and bestowed better things upon u<HI>s,</HI> and which do accompany true salvation. <HI>U</HI>pon many accounts therefore do we re∣ject humane reason in the sense fore men∣tioned, as a true means to discover <HI>G</HI>od in the new Covenant, or to open a way for reconciliation to him, and peace with him, or to hold any saying communion with him in grace and glory.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because natural reason (as such) in its noblest and most sublime estate, is but a finite Agent, and therefore cannot drink in thing<HI>s</HI> of infinite depth. There's no pro∣portion between finite and infinite, the or∣gan and the object.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>John</HI> 3. 11.</NOTE> The cockleshell of mans brain cannot contain the immense and superlative knowledge of heavenly things: who can expound the Trinity, the union of the two natures, the incarna∣tion of our Lord from a Virgin the uni∣on of the Members of the mystical body by the Spirit; the resurrection of the dead.

and the true nature of Eternity, and seve∣ral other. Its therefore necessary to act Faith upon the Doctrines revealed by <HI>G</HI>od in holy Scripture. Nay how can Natu∣rallist<HI>s</HI> with any face hope to measure these deep counsels and wayes of God when there are so many things born in Ma∣thematicks, and natural Philosophy, and Physick that pose the most acute Philoso∣phers in the world, and set them together by the ears, and so are like, to the end of the world. As about the progression of two parallel lines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Boyle in a late <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> the quadrature of the circle, the extimous convexity of the hea∣vens: the wonderful motion of the fixed Stars, that a sixt star should move in the aquator 52555 miles in a minute; that one of the first magnitude is a hundred times bigger than the Earth, and that so many thousands of them keep their constant mu∣tual distance since the <HI>C</HI>reation, and yet move in a liquid aether.

<P>What the admirable sagacity of future ages may compass as 10 thousands of pro∣blems within the circle of Sciences, or in that most noble Art of Chvmistry, or the Analysis of the three kingdoms of na∣ture; the tubes and glasses of our present inventions give us no sufficient prospect. We and our Fathers pitty <HI>Austin</HI> and <HI>Lactantius,</HI> and others for denying the Antipodes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Philaster Brixiensis</HI></NOTE> and (which makes the Jest) for deriding those that held that opinion) and some so zealous as Pope <HI>Zachary,</HI> to Excommunicate Bp <HI>Virgilius</HI> for holding it. And some of the Antients put down very odd here sies of the like kind. The learn∣ed of this age wonder at the denial of the motion of the Earth, tho now the truth of it appears clear to all the generality of the ingenious of <HI>Europe,</HI> and might be easily demonstrated by the transition of the Moon constantly eastward by the fixed Stars in the Zodiack, by the six-sold bigness of Mars at his opposition to the Sun, and by other invincible reasons mentioned by <HI>Gallxe</HI> and others.</P>

and instructed the world with better pre∣cepts, and acted upon more generous principles wrought out by the dim light of nature, whoso reads many of the <HI>Pla∣tonicks,</HI> and several of the <HI>Stoick</HI> and <HI>Epi∣curean</HI> Philosophers before and after the coming of our blessed Lord, will find their arguings to have suggested by the conduct of providence some preparations or the world not to think so strange of matters of Faith. When the Septuagint in their translation of the Hebrew Bible (or the pentateuch at least) into <HI>G</HI>reek at the command of King <HI>Philadelphus</HI> did spread the saving knowledg of the God of <HI>Israel</HI> wherever <HI>Alexanders</HI> conquering sword, and his greek tongue together had obtai∣ned.</P>
<P>As to the present point, I shall recite a few testimonies, and then turn off to fur∣ther inferences.</P>
<P>The first shall be of <HI>Plato</HI> in his Epistle to <HI>Dionysius.</HI> who advices to [shun such as a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> a gulf or dark pit: who expect and require punctual demonstrati∣ons in the things of God: as if they could be apprehended aud held in by our hands] and again in his <HI>Gorgins</HI> he says, that <HI>Socra∣tes</HI> did rather give credence to the things which he received from the Propheress <HI>Diotima:</HI> then insist upon a conviction by reason <HI>Theophrastus</HI> also the Scholar of <HI>Arist∣otle</HI> affirms concerning natural things that whoever seeks to find a reason of all things by their (affected) reason take away know∣ledg it self:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Calen, deusu part. </HI> 1. 15.</NOTE> and <HI>Galen</HI> one of the Princes of Physitians expresses of some things.

thou endeavour to find out, by what means such a thing was made: its plain, thou dost neither understand thy own weakness, nor the power of the (great) Maker: and therefore <HI>Pliny</HI> in his natural history cuts it short:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plin. </HI> 1. 2. c, 1.</NOTE> that a man cannot take right measures of other things, since he knows not himself: and to end, I may recal an observation of <HI>Capivaccius:</HI> that experi∣ence in Physick manifests many errors, which reason did not reveal.</P>
<P>The truth is, that in most Arts and Sci∣ences, many argute reasonings and fine∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oun distinctions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and others, vanish into smoke: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they come to the touchstone of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ex∣periments: wherefore now the Learneder part of the world have left off their old musty maxims, and sophistical cavils of the Schools whereby pure Philosophy has been intangled and obscured; and are re∣solved to spend some ages, and set all <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> a work to write volumns of faithful experiments before they will prefume up∣on more <HI>s</HI>ystems of natural Philosophy to gull the world: and then call a Council out of the learned nations in some cen∣ter place, and so make short and pithy and uncontroulable axioms for the Schools: <HI>I</HI> might mention many things that have made a great noise, but upon tryal have sunk down into emptiness and shame: <HI>I</HI> shall only touch the notion of managing a flying chariot, when once by the force of springs raised above the gravitation of the Atmosphere: But alas the wheels, when they come to action, few in pieces

or stopt quickly in the current, looking for better Workmen. Yet such was the ingenuity of some, and their imagination towred so strongly, that they procured a Merchant to make some tryal of the <HI>Tor∣ricellian</HI> experiment of quicksilver at the peak of <HI>Teneriff</HI> in order to determine how high the air might gravitate: But a∣las to little purpose: as all automata, es∣pecially a<HI>s</HI> to durability and perpetuation of motion do as yet pose and abash the greatest pretender<HI>s:</HI> but their ingenuous endeavours are most highly commendable, and seem to be reserved as blessings for better ages. When <HI>Bellona</HI> and <HI>Erinnis</HI> shall be banisht out of the earth, and <HI>Pal∣las</HI> shall teach <HI>Athens</HI> with an head piece of iron no more. When holiness and integrity shall beautifie the world, and divine grace shall raise new <HI>Bezaleels</HI> and <HI>Aboli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bs</HI> to make those sweet and candid persons happy in their generations, by ex∣quisite and curious inventions: which these bloody and treacherous days shall never see thru' the righteous Judgment of <HI>G</HI>od.</P>
<P>But to draw to an end: since the Ma∣jesty of God is not nor can be known,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bradward p. </HI> 29.</NOTE> so neither can his works and ways: not the least of his admirable operations can be found out to any perfection:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Job. </HI> 11, 7. <HI>Meditat. De∣votis.</HI></NOTE> let me con∣clude with a story in a treatise a scribed to <HI>Bernard,</HI> of one that was laving the Ocean with a little shell, and being askt what he meant: answered, Thus do they who think to exhaust the knowledge of the Essence or Works of <HI>G</HI>od (or to that purpose) and then breaks out into a fo∣ber

<P>Now lets descend to another inference.</P>
<P N="2">2. A second induction from the fore∣discovery may be, that the study of the Holy Scriptures is most excellent, neces∣sary and profitable; being given by inspi∣ration from <HI>G</HI>od to make us wife to sal∣vation. Thence we may extract, what is the perfect will of <HI>G</HI>od as to doctrine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3 16. <HI>ver. </HI> 15.</NOTE> worship and government for the World in the conduct of providence, and in the <HI>C</HI>hurch by the scepter of Christ.

The Day of Judgment will turn all them to ashes: when those shall adorn and stand thee in stead at the Dreadful Bar, where all the great Dons of the World shall tremble to appear, and none but Saints shall life up their heads in that great morning of their Redemp∣tion.</P>
<P N="3">3. Since this treatise concerns a happy preparation for our state in the world to come: it strongly incites to an impartial examination, Whether we be in the Faith or no? to enquire what graces or what
<PB N="221" REF="000429_0238_0FA5B2EB38BB3950"/>
degrees are yet deficient? and especially to work at the main or fundamental grace of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 5. 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 3. 10.</NOTE> to search what's lacking there<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 10.</NOTE> For when the defects are supplied it will give you an abundant entrance in∣to the heavenly Kingdom, and certifie you that you have a blessed right and title to that incorruptible inheritance.

<P N="4">4. This Treatise may serve as a pow∣erful motive to servent and uncessant love to the Lord Jesus: who has done all for us, yea more than we can think. It cannot enter into our hearts to conceive what he hath purchased and prepared for those that love him.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isai.</HI> 64. 4</NOTE> Oh what delight should we take in him? Oh what thankfulness can we express or render to him.

Let us give forth all our love to him, till we come to the full enjoyment of his. Here I would beg a little leave to pour out a complaint, and weep over our want of love to Christ:
<PB N="222" REF="000429_0239_0FA5B2EBE9202708"/>
for we see and find that we are all too apt by the sad inclination of the old <HI>Adam</HI> with∣in us, to love and embrace any temporary comfort above and beyond him, and then to few the old fig-leaf excuses to hide our na∣kedness from his all-searching eye: some∣times we make Idols of Relations, if sweet tempered and pleasant like <HI>Jonathan</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> and so incite God to take them a∣way in displeasure, and to plant sower, dirty and crabbed tempers in their room; and yet 'ti<HI>s</HI> in a mixture of mercy to wean us more to himself: for very few have the wit and grace to set God on the Throne in the midst of their hearts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 3. 20.</NOTE> and let all others wait and tend while he sups with us. Let's pray our heavenly Father, and beg it ear∣nestly, that if he will please to purge away our former miscarriages, and indulge such mercies to us in our pilgrimage; that he would please also to teach, help and incite our hearts to love him best, and above all, and love none but as foot-stools to advance our hearts the more to him, and to improve all in order to him. Then are we more likely to keep and enjoy our mercies, and tast more of God in them all, till the bles∣sed time of our ascention to his bosom.</P>
<P>There be multitudes of a far more in∣feriour orb, stamp and form; that instead of persons which sometime<HI>s</HI> have an excel∣lency, when holy, meek and chearful; fit to converse with man,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prov.</HI> 5. 19. <HI>&amp;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1. 10.</NOTE> and ordained of God to be his solac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: but their price is far above Rubies. I lament over those that value not persons gracious and rare-tempered: which are the very ornaments of the Crea∣tion;

but being of a low and sordid frame fall down and worship fine houses, green Gardens, fleet Ships, bags of Guyn∣nies, and such like trash, with many other dumb Idols, that will not profit in the day of wrath;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dan.</HI> 3. 1.</NOTE> and yet continue dancing in the plains of <HI>Dura,</HI> at the sound of the Organ. Flute and Sackbut; and in a moment slip down into the Grave. I have read of a good Woman that after her conversion, having flung away her foolish trifles: once upon the opening her Chest, and seeing them ly there: cries out: Oh sayes she, these were (once) my Idols: but now she had left her idolatry: and minded nobler Objects.</P>
<P>There be some yet worse: that if you attempt them tho by gentle reproofs are not content with ordinary leaves to cover it, as being decent, comely, fashionable: but are in mad rave, and cry like <HI>Micah:</HI> will ye take away my gods,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Judg.</HI> 18. 24.</NOTE> and ask what ailes me?

When will the world, be wise, nay, when will Christians be modest and sober, remem∣bring they are but dusts that Paradise had no garments, and Heaven will have none, and serious christianity and a mortified heart to the vanities of this life (if risen with Christ) seeks things that are above,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Col</HI> 3. 1.</NOTE>

<P N="5">5. Fifthly, The Doctrine of Faith infers it to be great wisdom and duty to keep your consciences undefiled. For the my∣stery of Faith is held and preserved in a pure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 9.</NOTE> clean and serene conscience, like a chrystal Venice-glass tipt with gold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that runs like a clear sweet stream not conscious of any sin wilfull commit∣ted.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 19.</NOTE> Its sometime termed a good con∣science: whereof wilful sins make sorrow∣ful ship-wracks: A good conscience is a continual feast, gave <HI>Paul</HI> a Banquet eve∣ry night, and composed him to a better rest, than in a bed of Roses.

<P N="6">6. Sixthly, We may observe from the former tract, that Faith is an excellent en∣gine to discern and observe the wise Go∣vernment of God in the World and in the Church. Its a Telescope to discern afar off in the heavens, and a Microscope to pry into minuter accidents in the earth. Had we no other Argument,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 3.</NOTE> yet by Faith we may know it, and that more fully and punctually, how the worlds were framed, and by Faith we understand the divine do∣minion and management of the world by Spirits.

There is also a place in <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> which the Septuagint read thus [When the most High divided the inheritance to the Nations, when he separated the Sons of <HI>Adam</HI> he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the Angels of <HI>G</HI>od.] Tho I do not justifie the <HI>T</HI>ranslation: yet it shews that this notion was current among the an∣tient Jews: And altho the P<HI>seudodionysius</HI> in his <HI>Hierarchy</HI> of Angels, Set<HI>s</HI> down ma∣ny frivolous fancies and curiosities about their orders; yet that God is pleased to execute his pleasure by the administration of good, and sometimes evil Angels, is con∣sonant to holy Scripture.

same: living for the while on the blessed providence of God, sending them tho greater plenty in the foregoing years.</P>
<P N="4">4. Fourthly and Lastly, lets touch a lit∣tle upon the mysterious government of the Church by his most Holy Spirit, sway∣ing his golden scepter in the hearts of Converts, and ruling them by hi<HI>s</HI> rod out of <HI>Zion.</HI> But this refers to that great point of communion with the Spirit of God:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 110, 2.</NOTE> which this treatise only considers in the doctrine of assurance, Chapter 8th, and in one further consequence following, which is the seventh.</P>
<P N="7">7. We may learn from the preceding tract, that the knowledg of our Faith and the attainment of assurance flow princi∣pally from the influences of the Spirit of God. He is the profound teacher of all mysteries, and the worker of Faith, and therefore gives the clearest evidence: without the necessity of arguing, when he is pleased to speak to the heart.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Joh</HI> 16. 13.</NOTE> He shall teach you all things (our Lord promises) and guide into all truth. He glorifies the Son, receives of his, shews it to us, and manifests things to come. Where he rea∣ches any doctrine, he work<HI>s</HI> the knowledg and sense of it into the heart, and causes us to believe: He is the former of faith, he commands and incline<HI>s</HI> us to trust, and imprints the image of Christ upon us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Epist. Gassendi de mo∣iu impresso, &amp;c</HI></NOTE> as the <HI>vis impressa</HI> sends out a power from the hand or instrument upon the ball ar∣row or bull <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which together with the air that's gathered by the force into an impulsive <HI>vortex</HI> behind the body (as in
<PB N="232" REF="000429_0249_0FA5B2F4186D4BC0"/>
the <HI>ignis lambens</HI>) carries on the motion to the end of its vigor.</P>
<P>'Tis more abundantly here: when the spirit becomes the arm of God to break the lions in the heart; he moves &amp; works in the most intimate recesses of the soul; he shapes and forms the new <HI>Adam</HI> with∣in us, and inspires it with fire from the throne between the wheels of the cheru∣bim<HI>s:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ezek</HI> 10. 7.</NOTE> He is the skilful architect of the Temple of the Church, cementing the li∣ving stones together, which were cut out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he mountain of the divine Degrees to make a glorious Habitation for God by the Spirit.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 22.</NOTE></P>
<P>Let's then never forget to be earnest in prayer for the gift of the spirit: since the influx of all grace, and the beautiful enamel of our hearts with heavenly gifts, flows from this holy spirit of <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim:</HI> All the truths in Scripture can only be settled and confirmed upon our hearts by him. He is like the master of Assemblies, that fastens the nail in a sure place:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eceles.</HI> 12. 11.</NOTE> like the great shepherd that <HI>Knocks</HI> in (the <HI>paxilli in caula</HI>) the stakes about the hurdles of the sheep-cotes to keep the harmless creatures from the Wolves, close and warm together in a dark and stormy night.</P>
<P N="8">8. Another deduction from the former treatise may be: that the number of true believers i<HI>s</HI> very small: for the generality of the world knows not God in Christ. The <HI>Turks</HI> indeed own him for a great Prophet, but disdain his banner. The <HI>Jews</HI> confess there wa<HI>s</HI> such a person at

<P>When we ruminate and consider of the pride, vanity, luxury, wantonness, excess, and rioting, pleasure, and vain-glory, en∣vy, backbiting, and variance both among Ministers and people: neglect of holy du∣ties, love of the world, and the perishing trash and trifles therein: The contempt of the Gospel and faithful Ministers: we

<P N="9">9. That the knowledge of our sinceri∣ty and integrity, is of great use to gain both peace and joy in believing: wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is a principal aim in the foregoing treatise. For though the want of Assurance doth not prove us to be under the power of unbe∣lief, yet this defect shews the weakness of our Faith, and keeps the yoke of bondage (in manifold fears, and torments) too strait and pinching upon the necks of some that are truly gracious.</P>
<P>It is thy greatest interest then to clear the case, and to state thine evidences by answering to the questions at the end of each chapter, or to the whole in general, or by any sound way and method to ma∣nifest a work of true grace and faith in thy heart.

There are manifold sign<HI>s</HI> of true grace set down by some: most whereof might be spared, being but like pitch or bird∣lime to entangle discouraging Spirits: use but few, and those very pertinent: if thou find a true one, truly wrought in thee, tis enough: for then all are there <HI>in semine</HI> in the seed plot, tho under ground.
