<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>TWas on the <HI>Twenty Fourth</HI> of <HI>December</HI> 1691 that the following Sermon was delivered, at the <HI>Boston Lecture,</HI> unto a very <HI>great</HI> Audience, with whom, the Merciful God gave it <HI>some</HI> Ac∣ceptance. The Four Ministers which carried on that Ancient and Famous Lecture, had for ma∣ny <HI>Monthes</HI> of late, been setting themselves, to <HI>Fight in their Courses,</HI> against the more Common <HI>M</HI> Miscarriages, now found among this Professing People of God; And it fell unto me, who am the <HI>Last</HI> and <HI>Least</HI> of them that here do the Service of our Saviour, to conclude those Testi∣monies, by some just Animadversions upon that <HI>Malignant</HI> Sin of DISCONTENT. That I might give <HI>Content</HI> unto many of the Heaters, that have asked a Copy of the Discourse, I have been <HI>Content</HI> that it should now see the Light; being sensible, that it is not <HI>easy</HI> for me to Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch upon any Subject of more General Concernment for my Neighbourhood. And I have taken this Occasion, to <HI>Recapitulate</HI> our other Offences against the Divine Commandments whereof we then is our Publick Prayers, made <HI>Confession</HI> before the Lord our God; and now Address <HI>Earth,</HI> as we then did <HI>Heaven,</HI> for the Reformation of our <HI>Provoking Evils.</HI> Tis by such Ess yes to <HI>Witness</HI> for God, that some of His Poor Servants now, <HI>Whenever</HI> or <HI>However,</HI> they may be taken from their Work, will through the Blessed JESUS, be able to lay down their Heads with Joy.</P>

<HEAD>AN Humble and Faithful TESTIMONY For God, unto the Children of my People.</HEAD>
<P>INasmuch as the Miscarriage of our <HI>First Parents,</HI> while they represented whole Mankind in the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God, is by a Divine Ordination and Im∣putation most equally laid upon us all, it is but <HI>Righteous</HI> with God that the Chil∣dren of <HI>such Parents,</HI> in their becoming so, be left without the <HI>Righteousness,</HI> with which <HI>His Image,</HI> now defaced by <HI>Theirs,</HI> would else have made them glorious; and the <HI>Absence</HI> of that <HI>Image,</HI> does as Reaso∣nably, as Necessarily, infer the <HI>Presence</HI> of a <HI>Nature</HI> in us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with a Depraved Pre∣judice against what is, <HI>Holy and Just, and Good.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="000560_0004_0FA70E4232D1E340"/>
Such a <HI>Corrupt Fountain</HI> will have Bit∣ter, Woful, Deadly <HI>Streams;</HI> and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may see <HI>[Lord, open our eyes!]</HI> a doleful pros∣pect of them in our <HI>Hearts</HI> and our <HI>Wayes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hences</HI> 'tis, That we do not <HI>Acknowledg</HI> the True God, nor labour for an <HI>Acquain∣tance</HI> with Him; nor <HI>Glorify</HI> Him, in <HI>Thinking</HI> of Him, <HI>Speaking</HI> for Him, <HI>Pray∣ing</HI> to Him, <HI>Hearing</HI> from Him, <HI>Choosing</HI> Him, <HI>Loving</HI> Him, <HI>Trusting</HI> Him, &amp; <HI>Serving</HI> Him; &amp; <HI>Rejoycing</HI> in Him, when we have had nothing else to comfort us. Instead thereof, we <HI>Deny</HI> Him, we <HI>Forsake</HI> Him, we have <HI>mean Opinions</HI> of Him; we give to the <HI>World</HI> &amp; the <HI>Flesh,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Devil,</HI> the Homage which is due to Him alone; we let Crea∣tures have the <HI>Affection,</HI> the <HI>Dependance,</HI> the <HI>Obedience,</HI> which he alone may lay claim unto; nor do we live as having him alwayes in our <HI>Eyes.</HI> We have also laid open our selves to <HI>Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>csits</HI> about the Christian Faith; by a rush admission of Thoughts that overthrow the glorious <HI>Frame</HI> of <HI>Religion.</HI> Yea, there have been, at least Implicit <HI>Witchcrafts</HI> in some of our Usages.</P>
<P>Hence 'tis that we do not zealously wait upon God, in the serious and constant Ob∣servation
<PB N="3" REF="000560_0005_0FA70E43141C9328"/>
of all those <HI>Institutions,</HI> where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> our Lord Jesus Christ has taught us to maintain our Communion with him. <HI>Church Fellowship</HI> is neglected; a Gospel <HI>Ministry</HI> is not supported; a Gospel <HI>Dis∣cipline</HI> is not affected; the <HI>Baptism</HI> of the Lord is not Improved; and the <HI>Supper</HI> of the Lord is not Approached. Instead thereof, we are prone to the <HI>vanity</HI> of Hu∣mane Inventions, and humanely Devised <HI>Sacraments</HI> and <HI>Holy-days,</HI> in the Worship of God; we have imitated the <HI>Pagans</HI> in many Religious Rites; that of <HI>Health∣Drinking,</HI> in particular; and perhaps we have had un awful <HI>Pictures</HI> in the Honour of our Lord.</P>
<P>Hence 'tis that we do not make a <HI>Reve∣rent Use</HI> of the Names, Words, Works, Attributes, and Ordinances, by which the Lord makes Himself known unto us. We have not had awful Apprehensions, of His <HI>Majesty,</HI> when we have been diav∣ing near unto him. Our <HI>Oaths</HI> have not been only in Truth, Justice, and Judge∣ment; our <HI>Vinces</HI> have not been wisely made, or truly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> We have abused <HI>Lots</HI> in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> And the <HI>Creatures</HI> of God have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Nou∣rishment
<PB N="4" REF="000560_0006_0FA70E43C998A270"/>
of our Pride, Gluttony, Drunkenness and Wantonness. In <HI>Pros∣perity</HI> we have been unthankful, and im∣patient in <HI>Adversity:</HI> the <HI>Dispensations</HI> of God have not awakened us.</P>
<P>Hence 'tis, that we have not Entertain∣ed the Ordinary <HI>Sabbaths</HI> of God, with a due <HI>Preparation</HI> for them, <HI>Celebration</HI> of them, <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in them. We have been <HI>Idle, Worldly, Wicked</HI> on that Holy Day. And we have had an Indisposition to those <HI>Extraordinary Sabbaths,</HI> which Ex∣traordinary Troubles of Extraordinary Mercies, have called, for. We have not <HI>Prayed</HI> and <HI>Fasted,</HI> we have not <HI>Praised</HI> and <HI>Feasted,</HI> with a suitable Solemnity, in the Seasons for our doing so.</P>
<P>Hence 'tis, that our own and our Neigh∣bours <HI>Place,</HI> has not been preserved with us. Especially <HI>Family Government</HI> sinks most ominously! As for <HI>Superiours,</HI> they have not been sufficiently respected, and requited. <HI>Parents</HI> have been <HI>Griev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d</HI> by our Insolence, Wastfulness, Unrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able∣ness, and Incorrigibleness. <HI>Masters</HI> have been Grieved by our Eye-service, Unsub∣jection, Slothfulness, and Surliness. <HI>Hus∣bands</HI> have been treated with Disesteem,

As for <HI>Inferiours,</HI> they have not been so regarded, as they should have been. <HI>Wives</HI> have been Affronted with contempt, hatred, bitterness and unfaithfulness, <HI>Children</HI> have been Ruin∣ed with Indulgence, or provoked, with Cruelty, and had little care taken about their Immortal Souls; nor have they had an Ingenuous Education. <HI>Servants</HI> have been Compelled or Invited unto un∣lawful Things; and hindered in the Thing that is Good; and perhaps pinch∣ed of their Food convenient. <HI>Subjects</HI> have either been Discountenanced in what in vertuous; or Encouraged unto what is vicious; and possibly their just Liberties and Properties, and universal Welfare, has not been so guarded as might have been. <HI>People</HI> have not been watch'd o∣ver, with a Paternal Tenderness and Fer∣vency; possibly <HI>Theirs</HI> may have been

In all persons, a <HI>private Spirit</HI> has prevailed, and the <HI>Times</HI> have been made <HI>perillous,</HI> by mens concernment for none but their own Cabin, while the whole Vessel has been in a Storm.</P>
<P>Hence 'tis, that our own, and our Neighbours <HI>Life,</HI> has not been Preserved with us. We have Impair'd our <HI>Health</HI> by our Intemperanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es; We have been Passionate, Revengeful, and Contentious, towards others; We may have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, with needless and vexing <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and it may be, we have Rashly <HI>St. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> them.</P>
<P>Hence 'tis, that our own and our Neigh∣bours <HI>Bed,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not been Preserved with us.

Or, However we have not Shut up all our Sen∣ses against all the motions of all <HI>Unclean∣ness,</HI> but it may be given as well as taken, Temptations of <HI>Lasciviousness,</HI> especially in making our selves the <HI>Companions</HI> of those <HI>Fools</HI> that are to be destroy'd.</P>
<P>Hence 'tis, that our own and our Neigh∣bours <HI>Estate</HI> ha's not been Honestly dealt withal. We have been <HI>Sluggards</HI> is our Callings; the <HI>Poor</HI> have not had our Libe∣ral <HI>Alms;</HI> We have not <HI>Pay'd</HI> our Debts. We have wrongfully taken or with held, what is not our own.

<P>Hence 'tis, that our own and our Neigh∣bours <HI>Credit</HI> has not been kept inviolate. We have Suppress'd or fore-born the <HI>Truth;</HI> and spoken Contrary thereunto.

Easily Received <HI>False Reports. Tale-bear∣ing</HI> ha's been Cherished; &amp; <HI>Innocence</HI> ha's not been Vigorously Vindicated: No, we have been, <HI>Full of Lies!</HI></P>
<P>Hence 'tis, that we have been <HI>Discon∣tent</HI> with our Condition; &amp; harboured in our Hearts, a Roving and a Ranging Lust, after an undue Alteration of it. Nor have we presently Extinguished, those <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> in our minds, which have been the <HI>First Motions</HI> towards the breaches of all the Commandments.</P>
<P>And unto all these Provocations, We have added this, which Exceeds them all, That we have despised the <HI>Offers</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ; and although the <HI>Old Covenant</HI> now speaks to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing but a mise∣rable <HI>Death</HI> unto us, Yet we have refused the Gracious Offers of that <HI>New Covenant,</HI> wherein a Wonderful Provision is made for all the miseries of our Souls, by a <HI>Me∣diator,</HI> in whom there do's <HI>All Fulness dwell.</HI> We have permitted our Earthly Assa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s to keep us at a Distance from the Lord Redeemer, who ha's been waiting to give us, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Remission of Sins.</HI></P>
<P>Alas! What a Sinful Thing is Fallen, Alas! In this Impartial <HI>Glass,</HI> if you look
<PB N="9" REF="000560_0011_0FA70E4C48057780"/>
attentively, you may behold the <HI>Spots,</HI> for which every Penitent Soul, will <HI>Judge</HI> and <HI>Loath</HI> it self before the Lord; and O that many Repenting Sinners would in their <HI>separated Hours,</HI> of the deepest Humiliation and Supplication before God, Examines themselves by this <HI>Glass;</HI> and Confess, and Renounce all of these <HI>Abominable Things,</HI> with a Believing Reliance upon the Lord, Jesus Christ, for the bestowal both of <HI>Pardon</HI> and of <HI>Power</HI> against them all.</P>
<P>But will my dear COUNTREY now consider, that <HI>for the sake of these things the Wrath of God is came upon this Disobe∣dient Land!</HI> Among THESE we shall find those <HI>Indictments</HI> upon which the <HI>Judge of all the Earth</HI> has proceeded, in visiting us with <HI>sure plagues and of long continuance.</HI> The Effects of it are too sensible and sor∣rowful to leave it uncertain, That we have been many years weltring and wast∣ing under the orea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Judgments</HI> of God. And the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kers of our Gods Displeasure have not only been in some respects, up∣on every one of our <HI>precious and pleasant Things,</HI> but they have grown upon us at such a terrible rate, as to punish us yet

in one Assault after another, with a, <HI>Seven times more for our Iniquities.</HI> The Year before this last, was most Remarkably a <HI>Year of Rebukes</HI> upon us; 'twas a year, when besides the General Clog upon all our Affairs, we miscarried in a most Im∣portant Expedition, like those Active <HI>E∣phraimies,</HI> who before the Time Sallied from <HI>Goshe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> against the <HI>Canaanites</HI> in the <HI>North,</HI> in hopes to be Enriched by the Plunder of those Injurious Adversaries; but came off Loosers, because, as the Psalmist says, <HI>They kept not the Covenant of God.</HI> It was a year, wherein we were not only Distressed and Consumed by the Calamities of <HI>War,</HI> but the <HI>Destr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y∣ing Angel</HI> did with <HI>Sickness</HI> also make a∣mong us a most lamentable <HI>Slaughter,</HI> Truly, <HI>The Slain of the Lord have been many.</HI> I suppose no less than as Thousand were in that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> year,</HI> carried unto their Long Home, from <HI>one Town</HI> in this Colo∣ny. And at the same time, very many scores of our poor Neighbours, especially of our young people, whose Concerns lay at <HI>Sea,</HI> have been carried as well to the <HI>Prisons</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> as to the <HI>Fevers</HI> in the <HI>Indies,</HI> where, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ske Sheep they have been

<P>However, at the Intercession of our <HI>Dressers,</HI> we are spared yet <HI>one year more</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="000560_0015_0FA70E4F1C711120"/>
to see whether any good <HI>Fruit</HI> can at last be obtained from us. And therefore I do with an <HI>Importunity,</HI> which I wish may be <HI>Ungainsayable,</HI> beseech of all my Neighbours, That we may all as one man, consider the manifold Guiltiness which the <HI>Catalogue</HI> of our sins has now <HI>set in order before us,</HI> and most humbly apply our selves to God in Christ, for his <HI>Forgive∣ness</HI> of our former Misbehaviours, and for his <HI>Assistance</HI> to a better Conversati∣on. There is this one thing, l'le venture to do; I do boldly charge all <HI>Impenitent</HI> [and such are all <HI>Inconsiderate!</HI>] Sin∣ners, as the most Real <HI>Troublers</HI> of our Land: If any <HI>Counsel</HI> though never so wise, though never so goods, have not prospered with us, we have been ready with a <HI>Turk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh</HI> Fury, to fly upon the men that gave it, as the Authors of all the Disastrous Events that followed. But, as when the Roman Empero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r upbraided his General <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erentius,</HI> for Loosing of a Battel, he Reply'd, <HI>Sir, I am to tell you, 'tis, you that lost the Day for us, by your open fighting against the God of Heaven, as you do!</HI> so would I say, to those among us, that Live not according to the Rules of

Great Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> was once a <HI>Pharisee;</HI> and he seems to have been Tainted, as not only the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> but even all <HI>Unregenerates</HI> at this Day, too much are, with that Opinion, until the TENTH Com∣mandment of the Law Convinced him; says he; in Rom. 7. 7,8. <HI>I had not known Lust, except the Law had said, Thou shalt not Co∣vet.</HI> From This Commandment, an <HI>Infer∣ence</HI> may be made Concerning all the rest; and so it is with an Artifice of Wonderful and Infinite Wisdom here placed in the Close of all: As if the Lord had said, <Q><HI>Let none of you imagine,</HI> Your <HI>Hearts</HI> to be free from the Cogn zance of the <HI>Lam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> which I have newly given you; &amp; there∣fore to convince you that my other <HI>lam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> do reach as far as the <HI>Hearts</HI> of you all, behold, I now Limit you with one Com∣mandment, which you may Evidently see, cannot be kept or broke without the <HI>Heart.</HI></Q></P>

<P>It has been a matter of much Enquiry,</P>
<P><HI>What is that</HI> CONCUPISCENCE, <HI>which the Tenth Commandment, gives us the Prohi∣bition of?</HI></P>
<P>We may truly Conceive, That it is not meerly <HI>Original Sin;</HI> which by this Com∣mandment becomes <HI>Exceeding Sinful:</HI> No, the <HI>Lust</HI> here forbidden, is the <HI> I ff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct,</HI> and indeed the <HI>First-born</HI> of that Sin; 'tis said in Rom. 7. 8. <HI>Sin wrought in me, all man∣nar of Concupiscence.</HI> And in truth, <HI>Origi∣nal Sin</HI> is a Transgression against every Commandment of God.</P>
<P>We may also justly Conceive, That it is not barely the <HI>Heart-Sin</HI> accompanying all our other Sins in the sight of God, which this Commandment affro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts with a <HI>Fla∣mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Sword.</HI> There is an <HI>Heart-Bride,</HI> an <HI>Heart-Murder,</HI> an <HI>Heart-Unclea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> a

<HI>Dishonesty</HI> of the <HI>Heart,</HI> and a <HI>Falshood</HI> in the <HI>Heart,</HI> which is forbidden, when <HI>that</HI> of the <HI>Life</HI> is Countermanded.

<P>But what then?

<HEAD>Now for, <HI>I.</HI> The <HI>Nature</HI> of DIS∣CONTENT.</HEAD>
<P>To <HI>Discribe</HI> the Sin of <HI>Discontent,</HI> I need only say;</P>
<P>First, In <HI>Discontent,</HI> there is, <HI>A Dislike
<PB N="39" REF="000560_0041_0FA70E72825CD008"/>
of that Condition which God would have us to be Well-pleased with.</HI> Every part of our Condition is Ordered by that God, who ha's <HI>formed all things,</HI> and whose <HI>Kingdom Ruleth over all.</HI> We are told, in Psal. 75 6, 7. <HI>Promotion comes neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from the De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art.</HI> [which lay both <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Canaan</HI>] <HI>But God is the Judge; He puts down one, and sets up another.</HI> Be our Condition High or Low, 'tis God that makes it so. And such is the Boun∣ty, such the Mercy of our God unto us, that, He would have our minds <HI>Approve</HI> of that Condition which He ha's carved for u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

So was that Excellent man, who could say in Phil 4. 11. <HI>I have Learned, in whatever state I am, therewith to be con∣tent.</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="000560_0042_0FA70E7649E4AF30"/>
But now, <HI>Discontent,</HI> is a Vice which disturbs the Mind, at the View of something or other in our Condition, which God ha's not put us in a way for the Retrieving of. Would you see a Picture of <HI>Discontent?</HI> Let Angry <HI>Jonas</HI> give it you. In Discontent a man is <HI>Angry,</HI> that God ha's not furnish'd him with such or such a <HI>Guord,</HI> as he thinks would give a Comfortable Shadow to him. Something there is in the Circum∣stances of his <HI>Place,</HI> his <HI>Life,</HI> his <HI>Bed,</HI> his <HI>Estate,</HI> and his <HI>Esteem,</HI> which he do's not <HI>Like,</HI> and which yet he cannot, or may not <HI>Help. Discontent</HI> is a Dissatisfaction, at the want of such <HI>Pleasures</HI> and <HI>Profits,</HI> &amp; <HI>Honours,</HI> as God ha's deny'd unto us; and He ha's <HI>Deny'd</HI> whatever we cannot Regu∣larly seek to <HI>Obtain;</HI> Whatever will not advance His <HI>Glories</HI> and <HI>Praises</HI> in the World. Would you hear what is the <HI>Discontent,</HI> which the Tenth Command∣ment is the Disallowance of? We are told, in Joh 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6. <HI>The Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye, and the Pride of Life.</HI> When a mans <HI>Carnal App<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es</HI> unto the Delights and Granden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the World, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast him into such a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>etment of Soul,

as hinders his Walk with God; <HI>There,</HI> is a Discontented man. <HI>Solomon</HI> speaks about <HI>Four</HI> Things that never say, <HI>It, is Enough!</HI> We may now add a <HI>Fifth</HI> with∣out any Culpable Additions to the word of God; it is, <HI>Discontent.</HI> A Discontented man, says, <HI>I have not Enough;</HI> he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <HI>Wolf</HI> in his Breast, that must alwayes be <HI>fed,</HI> but never will be <HI>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d;</HI> the Soul of him is a <HI>Spunge,</HI> ever such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, but never filled, of what is in, the <HI>Broken Cisterns</HI> of this lower and evil World.</P>
<P>Secondly, That which Enflames the <HI>Dis∣content</HI> of men, is usually the <HI>Condition</HI> which they see their <HI>Neighbours</HI> in. In∣deed ENVY most properly seems to fall under the Crimes that are Branded by the <HI>Fifth</HI> Commandment of our God; it is a Disposition to Diminish the just <HI>Great∣ness</HI> of our Neighbours. But there is a Roving and a Ranging of the Soul, after what our Neighbour has, and a Grudging at his Prosperity, which the <HI>Tenth</HI> more peculiarly stigmatizes. Although we do not go so far, as to consent with our wills unto the doing of any unjust thing, for Dispossessing our Neighbour of what God has given him, yet of our Souls have any

stirrings, and bublings, and loose <HI>Hanker∣ings</HI> after it, here is that which brings us within the verges of <HI>Discontent.</HI> A <HI>Dis∣contented</HI> man, may be willing that his Neighbour should still enjoy his <HI>Place,</HI> his <HI>Life,</HI> his <HI>Bed,</HI> his <HI>Estate,</HI> and his <HI>Esteem;</HI> nevertheless the view of what his Neigh∣bour has, causes him to <HI>Grudge</HI> that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> han't the like. It was said of the <HI>Dis∣contented,</HI> in Deut. 28. 34. <HI>Thou shalt b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mad for the sight of thine Eyes, which thou shalt see.</HI> A Discontented Man <HI>sees</HI> that which makes him stark <HI>mad;</HI> and what <HI>sight</HI> is that?

When <HI>Ahab</HI> comes to see a Neighbours <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tyard,</HI> he is <HI>heavy,</HI> he is <HI>displeas'd,</HI> if he han't the <HI>Like.</HI> We read in Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d 16. 2. <HI>The whole Congregation murmured, and said, In the Land of</HI> Egypt, <HI>we did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the Flesh Pots, and eat Bread unto the Full.</HI> A Disconten∣ted man sees, the full Table, the fine Liv∣ing, the daily Pomp, that some E<HI>gyptian</HI> has; and he now makes a cruel grumb∣ling,
<PB N="43" REF="000560_0045_0FA70E7A7A55A3B8"/>
because he han't the same. In <HI>Dis∣content,</HI> we make anothers condition, the measure for our own. Our <HI>Brown Bread</HI> has not such a favoury Tast in it, because others have <HI>White.</HI> The <HI>Camel</HI> will cry for Horns, the <HI>Ox</HI> must wear a <HI>Saddle,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Horse</HI> draw a <HI>Plough-share,</HI> whether it be suitable or no; meerly because they see <HI>some</HI> in that Condition.</P>
<P>Thirdly, There are many, perverse, Froward, <HI>Expressions,</HI> wherein <HI>Discontent</HI> uses to vent it self. Indeed, it Leads to the Breach of all the Commandments; particularly, <HI>The first Motions to all Second Table Sins,</HI> are in this <HI>Discontent.</HI> But there are some other <HI>Expressions</HI> of Discon∣tent, which the other Commandments do not so directly refer unto. It is said, in Eccl. 6. 9. <HI>The wandring of the Desire;—this also is vanity and vexation of Spirit.</HI> Where <HI>Discontent</HI> comes, the <HI>Desire</HI> falls to <HI>wandring</HI> after this and that <HI>vanity,</HI> and from thence comes a <HI>vexation</HI> in the Ab∣sence of it. A <HI>discontented</HI> man does first <HI>wish</HI> that he had this and that, which God has placed out of his reach, and he does then <HI>Vex,</HI> and <HI>fret,</HI> and <HI>fume,</HI> that he cannot reach it. He is a man that <HI>fancies</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="000560_0046_0FA70E7B390346A0"/>
many <HI>straits</HI> upon him, and they are but <HI>Fancied straits;</HI> as it is said in Job 20. 22. <HI>In the Fulness of his Sufficiency; he shall be in straits.</HI> He has more <HI>wants</HI> then ever God Almighty permitted him to reckon so; and though he be never so much preferred, unless he may have the Knee of <HI>Mordecai</HI> too, he says, <HI>All this availeth me nothing!</HI> And To, a vast flux of <HI>Cares</HI> now runs and eats into the Soul of such a man. We should ordinarily treat our <HI>Cares,</HI> as a Person of Quality does his Inferiours, that ask to wait upon him; we should say, <HI>Let 'em stay, till I call <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them in!</HI> But by Discontent, the Doors of our Souls, are set open so, that all kinds of <HI>Cares</HI> rush in upon us, with a most untruly violence; and O what a Cla∣mour do they make upon us! Our <HI>Affect∣ions</HI> hereupon come to be all in a Tumult; like that Riotous Multitude at <HI>Ephesus, One cries one thing, another cries another, and all is in Confusion!</HI> And our Soul-nou∣rishing, our Soul-refreshing Thoughts of God, are superseded by Troublesome Thoughts, upon that point, <HI>How shall I Compass my Desires?</HI> At last, it grows on to the Discouragement, and Melancholly;
<PB N="45" REF="000560_0047_0FA70E7C2A912FB0"/>
which is quite contrary to <HI>Serving of God with Gladness of Heart.</HI> The <HI>Hornets</HI> that stung the Hearts as well as the Skins of the Ancient <HI>Canaanites,</HI> are got into the Soul of a Discontented man; they dis∣order the man, as the <HI>Hornets</HI> that got into the Trunks of the Elephants, did the Army of <HI>Sapores,</HI> when he Besieged a C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ty where many Christians were Endan∣gered. Yea, 'tis well if this Inward Fe∣ver do not cause a <HI>Scab</HI> upon the <HI>Lip:</HI> there are filthy <HI>Mutterings,</HI> Growlings, and Snarlings, which we fall, into when <HI>Discontent</HI> has <HI>Bitten</HI> us, Even the meek <HI>Moses</HI> himself, when <HI>Discontent</HI> had once Discomposed him, <HI>spoke unadvisedly with his Lips.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, Discontent, is a <HI>Temper,</HI> or more truly, a <HI>Distemper,</HI> opposite unto that <HI>Calm</HI> of the Soul, in which we should still be Sailing to our <HI>Eternal Rest;</HI> for here, quite otherwise than in our other Navigation, the more <HI>Calm</HI> we have, the more <HI>Way</HI> we make. We should still Sail upon the <HI>Pac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ick Sea,</HI> but by <HI>Discon∣tent</HI> we are cast into an <HI>Horrible Tempest.</HI> A Discontented man, is in a <HI>Cage</HI> which God Himself ha's framed for him; and
<PB N="46" REF="000560_0048_0FA70E7CB2036BC8"/>
<HI>he,</HI> instead of Cheerfully Singing &amp; Feed∣ing there do's nothing but furiously, &amp; foolishly, heat himself against the <HI>Cage.</HI></P>

<HEAD>II. The <HI>Evil</HI> of DISCONTENT.</HEAD>
<P>Now to <HI>Blacken</HI> the Sin of <HI>Discontent,</HI> Let it be Considered.</P>
<P>First, Our <HI>Discontent</HI> is a Monstrous Piece of <HI>Ungodliness,</HI> Yea, of <HI>Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>llion</HI> a∣gainst the Almighty Lord. There is a woful <HI>Corruption</HI> in the Soul, where DISCONTENT Predominates; it is like a <HI>Fretting Humour</HI> in an <HI>Ulcer,</HI> yea a <HI>Cancer</HI> of the mind. It is <HI>Ungodliness:</HI> in Jude 15. 16. we find <HI>Ungodliness,</HI> no less than four times o∣ver, in one verse charged upon some in the world; and who are they? It follows, <HI>These are Murmurers, Complaine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> Yea, 'tis <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>belion.</HI> In Numb. 16. 41. with 17. 10. It was said, <HI>All the Congregation Murmu∣red;</HI> and then it follows, <HI>There was a Token against the Rebels.</HI> Indeed, our Discontent, is but a <HI>Quarrelling</HI> with Al∣mighty God; but, <HI>Wo to him that striver with his Maker?</HI> A discontented man, ei∣ther Quarrels the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of God, as if
<PB N="47" REF="000560_0049_0FA70E80B48A2A30"/>
God might have done things more conve∣niently; or, he Quarrels the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, as if Good pleas'd himself in our Sorrows; or he Quarrels the <HI>Truth</HI> of God, as if God would not fulfil his Mer∣ciful Engagements. However, be sure, he Quarrels the <HI>Justice</HI> of God. <HI>Qui de p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts Murmur at, Ferientis Justitiam accu∣sat.</HI> Among all his <HI>Lamentations,</HI> you shall not hear him-using the words in our Inspired <HI>Lamentations, Why should a Living Man complain! a man for the punishment of his Sin?</HI> He does not own his <HI>Sinfulness</HI> to be such, nor Gods <HI>Righteousness,</HI> that he is dealt kindly withal, while any thing short of <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Hill,</HI> is inflicted on him. It is indeed a most Impious and Accursed <HI>Pride,</HI> which is the Rise of our Discontent. A Sinner counts himself to <HI>Be better</HI> than his Neighbours, and there∣fore if he don't <HI>Fare better</HI> than they, he will be Discontented at it. Yea, the Al∣mighty <HI>God</HI> himself must gratify all of his <HI>Capricio's,</HI> or he'l be dissatisfy'd. Altho' there is perhaps not one known <HI>Papist</HI> an Inhabitant of this Country; yet there is many an <HI>Antichrist</HI> in the midst of us; Every Discontented man has, <HI>A Man of
<PB N="48" REF="000560_0050_0FA70E830BDCF8D8"/>
Sin,</HI> within him, or that which <HI>Exalts it self above all that is called God;</HI> he must have his own will to be the Director of what God shall do unto him. And is this fitting? <HI>Judge I pray you.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Our <HI>Discontent</HI> is not onely Disagreeable to the Spirit of a <HI>Christian,</HI> but it is the very Spirit of the <HI>Devil.</HI> The Blessed Spirit of God, is like a <HI>Dove,</HI> whose meek, sweet, quiet Qualities, are inconsistent with Discontent; there is a <HI>Vultur,</HI> or an <HI>Harpye,</HI> that preys upon the Soul, where Discontent is Harboured Now, the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God is in every <HI>Chri∣stian;</HI> and, if he be got but as far as A. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. C. in Christianity, that Spirit has made him Con a little of this Lesson, <HI>To be Con∣tent.</HI> The Christian has chosen <HI>God,</HI> both for his LORD, and for his GOOD; and hence, let things go never so Ill with him, there are two things that he attains unto. One is that in Psal. 39. 9. <HI>I was Dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.</HI> He is willing that God should Rule, the whole World, and all his own little Affairs in the World. Another is that in I Sam. 30. 6. <HI>He Encouraged him∣self in the Lord his God.</HI> He reckons,
<PB N="49" REF="000560_0051_0FA70E831EF794F0"/>
that while be has the Enjoyment of God the Knowledge, the Image, the Favour of God left unto him, the loss of all other things, is but like the spilling of a Cup of Water, unto him that has a perennous Fountain running at his Door. This is the Spirit of a <HI>Christian!</HI> But what then is <HI>Discontent?</HI> It is truly, the Spirit of the <HI>Devil. Satan</HI> is the greatest <HI>Malecon∣tent</HI> in the World; and he is, <HI>The Father of such.</HI> He (with all his <HI>Legions</HI>) is a <HI>Roving,</HI> as well as a <HI>Roaring</HI> sort of a Creature; 'tis said of him, <HI>He seeks Rest, and finds none.</HI> We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> concerning, the <HI>Discontented</HI> man, <HI>He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Troubled Sea.</HI> Now 'tis said in Jam. 2. 19. <HI>The Devils Tremble;</HI> the Greek word is an Al∣lusion to the Noise made in the Rote of the <HI>Sea,</HI> or by the dashing and breaking of the Wayes against the Rocks. The Devils, and the Discontented, are like one another; both of them, as the <HI>Trou∣bled Sea.</HI> Discontent is of all things, most properly, <HI>Vitium Diabolicum;</HI> there is a sort of <HI>Diabolism</HI> in <HI>Discontent;</HI> our <HI>Murmur</HI> is therefore the Devils <HI>Musick.</HI> And hence, <HI>Discontent</HI> is the Stock upon which the Devil uses to Graff the most
<PB N="50" REF="000560_0052_0FA70E84DD5F68C0"/>
violent and outrageous, of his Temptati∣ons. How many doleful Wretches, have been decoy'd into <HI>Witchcraft</HI> it self, by the opportunities which their <HI>Discontent</HI> has given the <HI>Devil,</HI> to visit 'em and se∣duce 'em? We have seen tremendous in∣stances of those Hellish <HI>Witchcraft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> and <HI>Compacts</HI> unto which the <HI>discontent</HI> of some have driven them. I once knew a Minister whom God made an Instrument of saving a <HI>discontented</HI> young man, from <HI>signing</HI> a Covenant with the Wicked One, which he by strange Accident found out, that the youngman had already <HI>Written</HI> with his Blood. Yea, <HI>Murder,</HI> and the worst, <HI>Murder</HI> too: even <HI>Self-Murder,</HI> is that which the <HI>Devil!</HI> does by <HI>discontent</HI> often precipitate many wretched mad∣men into. <HI>Achitophel</HI> falling into a pang of <HI>Discontent,</HI> goes and <HI>hangs himself.</HI> O it is a most hideous and hazardous <HI>Possessi∣on</HI> which the Devil takes of a <HI>discountent∣ed</HI> man. When <HI>Saul</HI> was in a <HI>discontent,</HI> it is noted, <HI>An Evil Spirit came upon him.</HI> Why, Discontent invites all the <HI>Devils</HI> within Call, to make a Kende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣vouze in the Heart of the disturbed man. Yea, if I were as much a <HI>Sadducce,</HI> as I
<PB N="51" REF="000560_0053_0FA70E84F62A7868"/>
am, even by matter of Fact, able to con∣fute a <HI>Sadducee,</HI> I would say, <HI>Discontent</HI> is it self a <HI>Devil,</HI> and the very <HI>Prince of Devils.</HI> But it is enough to say, The Devil has not a greater Engine to work withal.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Our <HI>Discontent,</HI> layes us o∣pen to the Terrible <HI>Wrath</HI> of the Eternal God. Indeed a Discontented man rarely feels the <HI>Love</HI> of God, witnessed unto his own Soul. Those Joyful and Gladsome <HI>Seals,</HI> wherein a Saint ha's powerful Assu∣rances, <HI>That God ha's Loved him with an Everlasting Love,</HI> are usually <HI>withdrawn,</HI> yea, they are <HI>Banisht,</HI> from a Discontented Heart. But instead thereof, the <HI>Wrath</HI> of God lyes hard upon the Soul, whom Dis∣content hath overwhelmed. It is repor∣ted in Numb. 16. 41. <HI>The Congregation Murmured;</HI> and the next News was, <HI>There is Wrath gone out from the Lord.</HI> It is a Token of a Direful &amp; Ireful <HI>Wrath</HI> from God upon the Soul, when the <HI>Evil Disease</HI> of Discontent, shall take away the Relish, which otherwise a man might have in his Enjoyments. And it further Pro∣vokes the God of Heaven, to inflict His <HI>Wrath</HI> upon all the Interests of such
<PB N="52" REF="000560_0054_0FA70E85DF7888A8"/>
an <HI>Unthankful,</HI> and <HI>Unholy</HI> man. We read in Psal. 105. 25, 26. <HI>They Murmured in their Tents, therefore He Lifted up His Hand against them.</HI> In Discontent, we <HI>Lift up</HI> our <HI>Heart</HI> against God, and then He will soon <HI>Lift up</HI> His <HI>Hand</HI> against us, that we shall continue in a desolate Wil∣derness all our Dayes. If our Children are Stomachful when the <HI>Rod</HI> ha's been upon them, they are Lash'd and Scourg'd with it again; and <HI>Impatiens Egrotus, Crudelem facit Medicum.</HI> God will not <HI>bear-long</HI> with Discontented Ones. He said in Numb. 14. 27. <HI>How long shall I bear with this Evil Generation, which Mur∣mure against me?</HI> It is nothing but the <HI>Infinite for bearance</HI> of God, that keeps off the bitterest and the dreadful lest miseries, from a <HI>Murmuring Generation.</HI> But we may be sure, that the Just God, will mul∣tiply the Marks of His Vengeance upon Discontented Ones, until either they come to <HI>Abhor themselves,</HI> and say, <HI>I am vile, I have spoken, but I will Proceed no further;</HI> Or, until, they come to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eel, <HI>Wrath unto the Uttermost.</HI></P>
<P>There were Especially Two Punish∣ments, which the Wrath of God inflected
<PB N="53" REF="000560_0055_0FA70E87AA584178"/>
upon His <HI>Discontented</HI> People in the Wil∣derness of Old; and I wish my own <HI>Dis∣contented</HI> Country would <HI>Think</HI> upon it. The Discontented People, were Punished with, A DELAY of mercy; they hoped that within One half year, they should have had a <HI>Comfortable Settlement</HI> of their Affayrs; and that they should quickly have had a <HI>Rest</HI> in their own <HI>Land</HI> under an holy and an happy Magistracy; but for their Discontent they were kept for many years together under very great <HI>Unsettlements.</HI> The Discontented People, were also Punished, with, FIERY SER∣PENTS, Let loose upon them; there were horrid <HI>Scorpions</HI> that were sent a∣mong them; those Malignant <HI>Presters</HI> whose <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ayls</HI> had a most Incur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eable but a most curciating Poison in them, very cru∣elly Stung them for their Discontent. I pray, <HI>Let him that ha's Ears to hear, Hear!</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly. <HI>Discontent</HI> is the most Un∣reasonable piece of <HI>Madness,</HI> the maddest piece of <HI>Unreasonableness</HI> in the World. It is said of Discontented persons, in Psal. 39. 6. <HI>Surely, they are Disquieted in Vain.</HI> Truly, t'were easy to give a thousand E∣vidences,
<PB N="54" REF="000560_0056_0FA70E8823AA2468"/>
that People are usually <HI>Discon∣tented in Vain,</HI> when they are so at all.</P>
<P><HI>Discontent,</HI> it will procure none of the those <HI>Good</HI> Things we are concerned for: They will not come a bit the sooner for all our Intemperate <HI>Snatches</HI> after them. In∣deed, a <HI>Likely,</HI> yea, a <HI>Certain</HI> way for us, to have more Good, is to be so <HI>Content</HI> with what we have already, as to be <HI>Thankful</HI> for it. I have heard, that Old Mr. <HI>Dod,</HI> having a Kinswoman, among the first Planters of <HI>New-England,</HI> who Underwent more than Ordinary Incon∣veniencies, in the Beginning of the Plan∣tation, he sent the Gentlewoman for a present, at the same time, first, a Brass <HI>Counter,</HI> then a Silver <HI>Crown</HI> and then a Gold <HI>Jacobus,</HI> all of them severally wrap∣ped up; with this Instruction to the Gentleman who carried it; That he should first present her only the <HI>Counter,</HI> and if she received it with any show of <HI>Discontent,</HI> he should then take no further Notice of her; but if she Gratefully Re∣sented that <HI>small Thing,</HI> for the sake of the hand it came from, he should then go on to present the <HI>Silver,</HI> &amp; so the <HI>Gold;</HI> and withal assure her, <HI>That such would
<PB N="55" REF="000560_0057_0FA70E88C7CB3D40"/>
he the Dispensations of God unto her, and the other good People of</HI> New-England; <HI>if they would be</HI> content with <HI>such little things as God at first bestow'd upon them, they should in Time have</HI> Silver <HI>and</HI> Gold <HI>enough.</HI> The Gentlewoman gave the man occasion to go thro' with all his Presents; and many more besides her have also found the Re∣ality of the Observation. But now, <HI>Dis∣content</HI> puts men out of the way and reach of Gods Blessing upon them. If a man do happen to <HI>Get</HI> any thing with discon∣tent, it is a thousand to one, he'l <HI>keep</HI> it so, if he <HI>keep</HI> it at all. What comes with a <HI>Eret,</HI> has a <HI>Eret</HI> in it when it comes. If a <HI>Rachel</HI> be discontented for her Bar∣renness, and cries, <HI>Give me Children!</HI> what sort of <HI>Children</HI> do they prove unto her? Truly, very <HI>deadly</HI> Ones. No,</P>
<P><HI>Discontent</HI> will heap all sorts of <HI>Bad</HI> Things upon us. For, it utterly <HI>deprives</HI> us, of our Comfort in those things which we are already the Subjects of. 'Tis <HI>Con∣tent</HI> alone, that will make a man really <HI>Rich</HI> and <HI>Great.</HI> A man truly is the <HI>Pos∣sessor</HI> of nothing, which he is not <HI>Content∣ed</HI> with. It is said. <HI>A little that a Righ∣teous man, has, is better than the Riches of
<PB N="56" REF="000560_0058_0FA70E898CA2ECA0"/>
many Wicked.</HI> Why so? because a <HI>Righ∣teous</HI> man is a <HI>Contented man.</HI> Most of our Indigencies and Necessities, are but in our <HI>Conceit;</HI> Now <HI>Content</HI> gives a man, a <HI>conceit</HI> of <HI>Enough,</HI> in his <HI>Little.</HI> Where∣as, if a man has never so much about him, he will be a <HI>poor</HI> man, as long as <HI>Discontent</HI> shall worry him. Our Naked Eye, will show us five or six <HI>Hundred Stars</HI> at once in our Hemisphere, glitter∣ing over us; but if we hold no bigger a thing than a <HI>Groat</HI> close to our Eye, it will hinder us from seeing those Lamps of Heaven at all; <HI>all is dark.</HI> Why, we have glorious <HI>Constellations</HI> of Comforts on every side of us; but our <HI>Discontent</HI> layes one perite Inconvenience or other close to our Eye, that all is <HI>darkness</HI> a∣bout us, &amp; we are e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en ready to say, <HI>We c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n see nothing that God has done for us!</HI> What signify'd all the Widow of <HI>Sar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p∣ta's</HI> Preservations, Provisions, and Prote∣ctions, in a very Calamitous Time, unto her, while <HI>Discontent</HI> was Complaining, <HI>My Son is dead!</HI> What signify'd all the Miraculous things done for <HI>Jonas,</HI> (whom the Jews count the Son of that Widow,) while <HI>Discontent</HI> was complaining, <HI>My
<PB N="57" REF="000560_0059_0FA70E8A449222B0"/>
Guord is gone?</HI> O 'tis a most ungrateful thing, this <HI>Discontent!</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, it also <HI>Forfeits</HI> all those things, wherein we have been ready to take our Comfort. As the Lord said, <HI>Because yee did not serve the Lord with gladness of Heart, yee shall serve your Enemies with weariness:</HI> This is the Common Fate of Discontent∣ed Persons; Because they are not <HI>Content</HI> with that they have, God says, <HI>I'l take it all away!</HI> And when those Comforts are gone, our <HI>Discontent</HI> makes us, yet more unable to bear the going of them. As a man is a <HI>Fever,</HI> or a Bird in a <HI>Lime∣t wig,</HI> the more he Tumbles and Flutters, the worse his matters are; so is it in <HI>Dis∣content.</HI> None of the <HI>Fetters</HI> which God layes upon us, would be half so Galling, so heavy, so irksome, if <HI>Discontent</HI> were not a <HI>sore</HI> first made upon us; 'tis by this that, <HI>The Iron Eats into our Soul.</HI> But now, being brought into our sorrowful Hours, our <HI>Discontent</HI> serves us, as the Jewes did our Lord upon the Cross; <HI>Gall and Vinegar,</HI> is all the Cordial that it brings for the supporting of us; 'tis, <HI>As Vinegar to Nitre,</HI> one Sharp thing upon another unto us, when we are of an <HI>Heavy Heart.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="000560_0060_0FA70E8AF1357920"/>
In fine, Our Discontent, is upon all Ac∣counts, as much without <HI>Reason,</HI> as the most <HI>Bruitish</HI> thing in the World: For, Either we <HI>can</HI> Remedy our Affliction, or we <HI>Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> If we can't, <HI>Levius <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>;</HI> a con∣tented <HI>Patience</HI> must be the Remedy. If we can, Go do it then, and the <HI>Content.</HI></P>
<P>Allow me to touch a Little upon one frequent and fretting string of <HI>Discontent;</HI> It is that of Murmuring at the <HI>Government.</HI> The World, and this part of it more par∣ticularly, is much disquieted with a sort of people, known by the Name of, <HI>Mur∣murers;</HI> and what is it <HI>breeds</HI> 'em? Tis commonly the <HI>Taxes</HI> which are demanded of them. And yet if they would hearken to <HI>Reason,</HI> many times all this foaming <HI>Discontent</HI> would be taken away. Per∣haps the <HI>Taxes</HI> were granted by the <HI>Con∣sent</HI> of the People in an Assembly, and can∣not such <HI>Taxes</HI> he paid with the <HI>Content</HI> of the people that have given them? Per∣haps all the <HI>Taxes</HI> are necessarily employ∣ed for their Defence against such Calami∣ties as would cost them far more than all their <HI>Taxes</HI> ten times over. Perhaps they needlesly throw away the value of more than thrice their <HI>Taxes</HI> at the <HI>Ta∣verns,</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="000560_0061_0FA70E8BCA225088"/>
or at least, on <HI>Superfluities</HI> in a year. Are there <HI>Inequalities?</HI> These are Unavoidable.

Will you be so In∣grate, and wicked as to say, <HI>I cannot bear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>?</HI> However, you may say with <HI>Job,</HI> in Job 1. 21. <HI>Naked came I out of my Mo∣thers Womb;</HI> and therefore tho' you should now become, <HI>As poor as Job;</HI> yet you should again say with <HI>Job, The Lord gave, and the Lord has Taken away; Blessed be the Name of the Lord!</HI></P>
<P>Surely, here are <HI>Thoughts</HI> enough, to lay our <HI>Discontents</HI> under such <HI>Reprimands,</HI> that they must for shame now be Husht for ever.</P>
<P N="2">2. But now, there are Needful CRACE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to be the further Ingredients of that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> which is to be used with us. It we had much of <HI>Heaven</HI> in our
<PB N="76" REF="000560_0078_0FA70EA462FE2140"/>
Hearts, we should be contented, although we have Little of <HI>Earth</HI> in our Hands. <HI>Discontent</HI> is a Kind of a Snake; let us take High Flights of <HI>Grace,</HI> and that Snake will not be able to fasten upon as. One of the Ancients, has well said, <HI>Nil sentit Crus in Nervo, cum Animus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st in Celo.</HI> Were we very <HI>Spiritually Minded,</HI> and were we continually acting of <HI>Grace</HI> upon God, in a life of most Intimate Fellowship with Him; We should be after a sort <HI>Insensible,</HI> of the Things which do now so Exceedingly <HI>Discontent</HI> us. Particularly; There are especially Three <HI>Graces</HI> to be now Recommended unto us all.</P>
<P>First, Let me Recommend <HI>Faith,</HI> as that <HI>Grace,</HI> which brings, <HI>Perfect Peace,</HI> unto him that ha's it. <HI>Faith</HI> will keep us, as from <HI>Fainting,</HI> so from <HI>Fretting,</HI> under our Afflictions. By <HI>Faith,</HI> let us Live upon <HI>Gods Promise</HI> in the New Co∣venant. There are <HI>Great and Precious Promises,</HI> which God ha's given us, for the <HI>Contenting</HI> of our Souls; and now, although we have nothing else, yet let
<PB N="77" REF="000560_0079_0FA70EA475C3C370"/>
these be, <HI>Our Heritage, and the Rejoyc∣ing of our Heart.</HI> What a <HI>Promise</HI> is that in Heb 1 3. 5. <HI>Be Content with such things as yee have; for He hath said, I will rever leave thee, nor forsake thee.</HI> Mark the Preceding Verse, and you may see, That <HI>Married People</HI> are Eminently con∣cerned in this <HI>Promise</HI> of God. <HI>Mar∣riage is Honourable,</HI> says the Apostle; Yea, but say many, <HI>Tis Change <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> too;</HI> &amp; as the <HI>Family</HI> Growes, <HI>Discontent</HI> will do so too. Well, says the Lord, <HI>But I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> never leave thee nor forsake thee;</HI> Be but Content, and I'l provide for all the <HI>Family!</HI> See also, Psal. 84 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. and Psal. 34, 10. with many more such, <HI>Faithful sayings.</HI> By <HI>Faith</HI> likewise, let us Realize <HI>Our Portion</HI> in a more Glorious World. Perswade your selves, of the <HI>Portion</HI> which you have in those Things that, <HI>Eye hath not seen, Ear hath not heard, and Heart hath not Conceived.</HI> It was said, in Heb. 10. 34. <HI>Yee took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>fully, the Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing of your Goods, knowing in your selves, that yee have in Heaven, a better and an En∣during Substance.</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, we should be deserted by all the Friends we had in the
<PB N="78" REF="000560_0080_0FA70EA570D2A840"/>
World, yet let us <HI>Know,</HI> That we have <HI>Him</HI> for our Friend, who says, <HI>Am not I better unto thee, that Ten Sons? or than Ten Worlds?</HI> Let us <HI>Know</HI> that though we have little Money, yet we have, <HI>The Pearl of Great Price.</HI> Let us <HI>Know,</HI> that though we have hardly Rage of Cover us, yet we have, <HI>The White and clean Linnen which is the Righteousness of the Saints.</HI> Though our Names here are Spit upon; yet let us <HI>Know,</HI> we have, <HI>Names Written in Heaven.</HI> And though our House be a <HI>Cottage,</HI> and perhaps an <HI>Hired</HI> one, yet let us <HI>Know, In our Fathers House, there are many Man∣sions.</HI> O be Content with such a <HI>Portion!</HI> You'l say, <HI>How shall I know this?</HI> I Re∣ply, <HI>Thus;</HI> Try whether these Considera∣tions will Kill your <HI>Discontent,</HI> and Extir∣pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that <HI>Root of Bitterness</HI> out of your Souls. If you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, They'l <HI>Do;</HI> That is a Sign that such Considerations do belong unto you; you are the <HI>Heirs of such Consolations.</HI></P>
<P>But let me, Secondly, Recommend <HI>Re∣pentance,</HI> as a <HI>Grace</HI> which will give a <HI>Di∣version</HI> to all our <HI>Discontent:</HI> This will
<PB N="79" REF="000560_0081_0FA70EA5F57424A0"/>
make us use all our <HI>Discontent</HI> upon our <HI>Sins;</HI> and this is. <HI>A Discontent not to be Discontented at!</HI> While we <HI>Mourn</HI> for our Dealings towards God, we shall not <HI>Murmur,</HI> at any of His Dealings with us. Did Sin set <HI>Heavy</HI> upon us, every thing else would be <HI>Light. Repenting</HI> would give a Check unto <HI>Repining.</HI> The Voice of the Penitent is, <HI>If God say, I have no De∣light in thee, Behold, Here I am; Let Him Do unto me, as may seem Good unto Him!</HI></P>
<P>And, Lastly, Let me Recommend <HI>Hu∣mility,</HI> as a <HI>Grace</HI> which Cuts off the very <HI>Spring</HI> of all our <HI>Discontent.</HI> All things do alwayes go well with an <HI>Hum∣ble</HI> man. He is, <HI>As a Weaned Child,</HI> and so not a <HI>Froward</HI> one. Let the worst come that can come, he'l say as One once did, in terrible pain, <HI>I Groan, but I do not Grumble.</HI> O could we say with <HI>Paul!</HI> And if <HI>Paul</HI> could say so, sure you and I, may say it. One thing said by <HI>Paul</HI> was, <HI>I am nothing.</HI> Say after him; and then, though we <HI>Have no∣thing,</HI> we shall not be <HI>Discontent.</HI> Ano∣ther
<PB N="80" REF="000560_0082_0FA70EA6BA8F7480"/>
thing said by <HI>Paul</HI> was, <HI>I am the Chief of Sinners.</HI> Say after him; and then we shall not be <HI>Discontent,</HI> though we are <HI>the Chief of Sufferers.</HI></P>
<P>But,</P>
<P N="3">3. Fervent PRAYERS may be pro∣pounded as the Last Ingredients of that <HI>Antidote,</HI> which we are to be advis'd unto. <HI>Prayer,</HI> Tis the <HI>Heart-ease</HI> of Discontented ones <HI>Hannah</HI> found it so; when a Fit of Discontent was-upon her; we are told, <HI>She <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cured out her Soul to the Lord, and so was no more fad.</HI> I now say, <HI>Go and do likewise.</HI> In there any Grievance which you are <HI>Discontented</HI> at? Then, <HI>Go to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>the Lord;</HI> This will wonderfully <HI>Un∣load</HI> your Souls. As <HI>Luther</HI> call'd <HI>Prayer The Leeche of his Care;</HI> thus you may find it will <HI>suck</HI> all your <HI>Discontents</HI> away.</P>
<P>Be much in <HI>Prayer.</HI> The Hurricanes of Discontents are not in that <HI>Mount,</HI> whi∣ther <HI>Prayer</HI> will carry you: But pray par∣ticularly for, <HI>A contented mind.</HI> It is a Ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>co of matchless <HI>Wisdom;</HI> now, <HI>If any
<PB N="81" REF="000560_0083_0FA70EA772B2CE38"/>
man lack this Wisdom, let him ask it of God.</HI> When <HI>Paul</HI> had said, <HI>I have Learned the Mystery of Contentment;</HI> left any should mistake him, as if he had spoken like a <HI>Self taught</HI> man, he subjoyns, in Phil. 4. 13. <HI>I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me.</HI> O then, ask the <HI>strength of Christ;</HI> and as of old, <HI>When he Rebu∣ked the Winds, there was a great Calm;</HI> Let us beg of him that he would mercifully <HI>Rebuke</HI> all the <HI>Discontents</HI> in our Souls. That one word of his <HI>Peace! Be still!</HI> will set all to Rights within us.</P>
<P>THUS, have we been Testifying a∣gainst the Sin of DISCONTENT.</P>
<P>But after all, it is Time for <HI>me</HI> now to say, there is One sort of <HI>Contentment,</HI> against which I am to warn you all; That is, a <HI>Contentment</HI> in <HI>Sin;</HI> a <HI>Con∣tentment</HI> with a <HI>State</HI> and a <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> of Sin, before the Lord. You have been So∣lemnly Warned in this place, is Look upon every Sin. <HI>As the Abominable thing which is Hated by the Soul of God;</HI> O be not <HI>Contented</HI> that the <HI>Guilt</HI> and the
<PB N="82" REF="000560_0084_0FA70EA856E59668"/>
<HI>Love,</HI> of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Thing should cleave unto your Souls; any more than <HI>Lot</HI> was to be in <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dam,</HI> when hot Thunder-boles were going to be discharged upon it. If you <HI>be,</HI> I have only this to say Now Concerning it; We have Sound∣ed the Trumpets of God among you; and We have told you, That an <HI>Hor∣rible Tempest</HI> is yet impending over the Heads of the Impenitent. As <HI>Joshua</HI> said, <HI>Behold, This Stone shall be a Witness, for it ha's heard the Words of the Lord.</HI> So I say, this Pulpit, these Pillars, these Galleries may be <HI>Witnesses,</HI> and thou∣sands of <HI>Angels</HI> will bring in their <HI>Wit∣ness,</HI> that you have had the Dangers of your Sins faithfully set before you. O take the Warnings, that so both you and we may Rejoyce together in the Day of the Lord Jesus.</P>

<P>THere are two things which the Reader has with many Pressing Terms been thus Discours<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d upon; the One is more General; namely, A RE∣FORMATION to be pursued in all one Churches; the Other is more Special: namely, A CONTENTATION to be mentained in all our Spirits; And be∣hold, what an <HI>Accent</HI> I now have to put upon these WORDS of God, from those WORKS of His, which have happened in our Neighbourhood, since the Writing

of these Meditations! I may now give you that Invitation of the Psalmist, <HI>Come, Behold the Works of the Lord, what Desola∣tions He hath made in the Earth!</HI> Alas, When shall the next sentence come to be fulfilled? Good God! When shall we see, <HI>He maketh Wars to cease unto the Ends of the Earth?</HI></P>
<P>If our CHURCHES do not now more then ever Study to <HI>Reform</HI> every thing that may be offensive to the Sacred &amp; Flaming eyes of the Blessed Jesus in them, &amp; Revive their Zeal, their Watch, their Care against every <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of Bitterness,</HI> which Professors may have insensibly Rising in their Hearts and Lives; We are certainly Blind before Lightning, We are Deaf to Thunder! The Lord Jesus throughout all our late War with the Indians in our East, had hitherto mar∣vellously preserved and protected our <HI>Churches,</HI> and only Broke up such Plan∣tations as had been too much without the due Respects or Effects of His Glo∣rious Gospel. But what a doleful Thing is there now come to pass?

Attacque, from the most Bloody Salvages in the World. Our Hearts are harder than the <HI>Northern Iron,</HI> If they do not bleed at the Tidings of the <HI>Blood shed;</HI> made by the <HI>Northern Indians,</HI> which Bar∣barous Worshippers of the Divel, have newly, after a sort broken up an Holy So∣ciety, of Believers, that were Combined for the Evangelical Worship of our Lord Jesus Christ. Sad! That we must now Complain, <HI>Lord, The Enemy had done Wick∣edly in the Sanctuary; thine Enemies Roar in the midst of thy Congregations!</HI> It seems that even unto <HI>Churches</HI> too it may now be said, <HI>There are even with you also, Sins against the Lord!</HI> Doub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>less, the Fall of <HI>One</HI> Golden Candlestick in our Borders, makes Noise Enough to awaken all our Churches, unto the doing of some Remarkable Thing in Returning unto God; unless our <HI>Lethargy</HI> be be∣come (God forbid! ) Incureable. When a few poor <HI>Gal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leans</HI> had been in the midst of their Sacrifices, butchered by a Cursed Pagan, our Lord made that Reflection thereupon, <HI>Suppose yee that these were Sinners above all!

Likewise Perish.</HI> But what shall <HI>we</HI> say, when many Times Eighteen <HI>Christians,</HI> are in one Day made a Sacrifice unto those Tawny Pagans, than which there are not worse Divels Incarnate upon Earth! O that all the <HI>Churches</HI> in the Country might now more than ever Stir up themselves unto such Demonstrations of Repentance, as might prevent the further progress of our Calamities; and answer this Warning of the Lord our Saviour, <HI>Be thou Instructed,</HI> O New-England; <HI>Lest my Soul Depart from thee, L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st I make thee Desolate!</HI></P>
<P>And now also if our SPIRITS, are not more <HI>Content</HI> than ever with such Estates as God has Ordered for us, What a Conviction have we in the Dis∣asters which our Friends to the <HI>North∣ward</HI> have newly met withal! We are now perhaps upon all accounts as we would be; but let us then think, not only upon those that are hurried and huddled into <HI>Garrisons,</HI> where besides the Difficulties necessarily attending such Confinements, they are every Hour Ex∣pecting the Doubtful Assaults of an Adversary, from whom, every Act of
<PB N="87" REF="000560_0089_0FA70EAFC5B15238"/>
Mercy is a <HI>Prodigy:</HI> but also let us think upon the miserable Captives now in the Hands of that bruitish Adversary; <HI>Cap∣tives</HI> that are every minute Looking when they shall be Roasted Alive, to make a Sport and a Feast, for the most Execrable Canibals; <HI>Captives,</HI> that must Endure the most bitter Frost and Cold, without Rags Enough to Cover their Nakedness; <HI>Captives,</HI> that have scarce a bit of meat allow'd them to put into their Mouthes, but what a Dog would hardly meddle with; <HI>Captives,</HI> that must see their nearest Relations butchered before their Eyes, and yet be afraid of Letting those Eyes drop a Tear upon the most Heart breaking Occasions, that can be imagined; <HI>Captives,</HI> that may not bear a part in any Comfortable Devotions nor be known to have so much as a Bible with them, lest a French Priest should si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ze upon it; <HI>Captives,</HI> that wear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one weary Week after another, in the midst of such Wolves as are every moment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ces.

is our Gracious God ha's favour'd us withal.</P>
<P>It is then to be distinctly Related, That the Indians yet living in Hostility against us, after they had by a long silence and repose, in their Inaccessible Kennels of Late, made our Frontier Towns in the <HI>North-East,</HI> a little too Remiss, they did on the 25th of this Instant <HI>January,</HI> 1691. come upon part of <HI>York,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Main,</HI> where the Inhabitants were in their Unguarded Houses here and there Scattered, <HI>Quiet and Secure</HI> Upon the Firing of a Gun by the Indians, which was their Signal, the Inhabitants Look'd out; but unto their Amazement found their Houses to be Invested with horrid Indians, who immediately Kill'd many of these unprovided Inhabitants; and more they took Prisoners. Having dispatch'd their Slaughter, they went on to Plunder, both rising, those Houses, which thus became ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>xious, and Burning about Seventeen of them. Hereupon, this Great Body of indians went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to some of the Garrisons; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them to Surrender; their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they fine in Writing, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Captives who had the Ge∣nerosity

to Return into the Hands of the Monsters that were become their Masters, lest by their breaking of their Word, the other Prisoners might be Exposed: and therein they promised, If they would Sur∣render their <HI>G</HI>arrison, they would let 'em go free; For, as these Flouting Rogues would have it inserted, <HI>They were a people that Fear God, and won't Lye; if they pro∣mise, they will be as good as their word; else they know they shall burn under ground; and if they Lye, God will not have them;</HI> they added, <HI>They were Three Hundred Strong.</HI> Some little Garrisons, which had no more than two or three men in them, received these wild Summons, but they had the Courage to Reply, <HI>That they would s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end their Blood unto the last Drop, are they would</HI> S<HI>urrender;</HI> and upon this, those Cowardly Miscreants had not mettle enough to med∣dle with them. They Retired into the Howling Thickets of the Wilderness; carrying their Booty with them; onely sending Home two aged Women and a∣bout fifteen or sixteen little Children, whom they were loth to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>led with, and yet, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and strange! were loth to Murder them.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="000560_0092_0FA70EB39E5E8D28"/>
They that went immediately to Bury the Slain, have given us an account, that there were about fifty persons Kill'd, and near an Hundred Captiv'd; among which last is the Family of their Godly and worthy Minister. Several also were wounded; whereof some since are Dead.</P>
<P>But besides the mortal Wounds at this Time given to a precious Church of the Lord Jesus, there was one terrible Circum∣stance attending this Desolation, which we had not yet seen in our Wars.</P>
<P>These cursed Blood-Hounds, having bin inspired by the Counsils of some <HI> Romish Missionaries,</HI> had been long wishing that they might E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>brue their Hands in the Blood of some <HI>New-England</HI> MINISTER; and they had now an opportunity for such a Diabolical satisfaction.
