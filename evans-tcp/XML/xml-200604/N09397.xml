<HEAD>A Plain and earnest ADDRESS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE observed with much sorrow and concern your neglect of the public worship of God and preaching of the Gospel: As you thereby deprive me of the opportunity of addressing you from the pulpit, I am obliged to follow you into your private retirements: And I have chosen <HI>this</HI> method of application to your con∣science, because I would give you the advantage of re∣newing and reflecting upon my solemn admonition, which you might be more likely to forget if I should only discourse with you in person, and because I can in this method be quite free from the infirmities and interrupt∣ions which often attend personal conferences.</P>
<P>Let me then beg of you, the first leisure hour you have, after receiving this small address, to set yourself seriously and impartially to weigh in your mind the following con∣siderations, without taking any offence at the plain and close manner of address here used, and without blaming me for representing the truth to you in a disagreeable light, since it is not <HI>my</HI> fault that I am obliged to deal with you in this manner.</P>
<P>In love and tenderness to your soul, and under a sense of the account which I must hereafter render to my Lord and Master, I will endeavour, in the first place, to show you the <HI>nature</HI> of your sin— then set forth its <HI>aggravations</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the <HI>danger</HI> to which it exposes you—then answer with <HI>excuses</HI> as you may make in favour of it—and lastly, give you a word of <HI>exhortation</HI> and <HI>warning.</HI> May the divine spirit set home these things on your heart, that my labour may not be in vain.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="4" REF="011980_0003_0F87ED8C5B2BEAD8"/>I. As to the <HI>nature of your sin.</HI> It is an undoubted truth of natural religion, that there is a God, and that he ought to be worshipped and served: This is what you will readily acknowledge, and all the heathen in the world will join with you in it, <HI>for the invisible things of God from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead.</HI> The same light of nature has also taught all the heathen nations to unite in a social manner in their homage and reverence to the Supreme Being; even those who pay di∣vine honours to the creatures of God have always ten <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> or other consecrated places, where they frequently <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> join in the exercises of religion. The ancient <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> had their tabernacle, their temple, and their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>gogues, where they met to pay their homage to God, according to his own institutions; and Christians are formed into churches, and have always had places of meet∣ing for social worship, and the ordinances of the gospel: This is the will of our great Lord, who has promised his gracious, spiritual presence <HI>where two or three are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> together in his name,</HI> who by his spirit in his apostle Paul has commanded all that profess his name, <HI>not to forsake the assembling of themselves together.</HI></P>
<P>But your conduct too plainly proves, that you have no regard to the light of nature, the dictates of your consci∣ence, the authority of Christ, or the example of pious men in all ages and places of the world; you <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> contradiction to the general sense of mankind <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> must excuse me for telling you, that you do <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> so much religion as some of the most ignorant <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Barbarians: <HI>God has written to you the great things of his law, and you have accounted them as a strange thing</HI>:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hosea viii.12.</NOTE> —Christ has sent you the most glorious and im∣portant news, and you will not hear it: The ministers of the Prince of peace are come upon the most benevol<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> er<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and to your soul, to warn you of your sin and dan<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to shew you the path of life, to beseech you in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of their great Lord to be reconciled to God thro' h<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ But you have turned a deaf ear to God's counsels, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will hear none of his reproof<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; you are casting contempt
<PB N="5" REF="011980_0003_0F87ED8C5B2BEAD8"/>
on that precious Saviour who gave himself a ransom for many, and has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having been made a curse for us; you are rejecting the counsel of God against yourself, and despising those ser∣vants of Christ, to whom he has said, <HI>he that despiseth you, despiseth me; and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke▪ x.16.</NOTE> And <HI>whosoever will not receive you, nor hear your words, shake off the dust of your feet for a testimony against them.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matth. x.14.</NOTE></P>
<P>Moreover, you are acting directly contrary to your own best interest: It is your duty and interest to seek the sal∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f your own precious soul; whose worth is so in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reat, that millions of worlds cannot outweigh it, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could redeem it from destruction but the blood <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of God; if it is lost after this, it is lost for∣ever, and there is a dreadful train of black ideas contain∣ed in this one phrase, <HI>the loss of the soul.</HI>—This precious soul you are now neglecting, as if it was not worth your care; you are starving it in the midst of plenty; the heavenly manna is rained all round your tent, and you will not take the small pains to gather it; you <HI>l<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath this light bread,</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Numb. xxi.5.</NOTE> like the murmuring Israelites of old, and have no relish for the food which is sent you from heaven.— You are robbing yourself of the most delightful entertain∣ment which you can enjoy on this side heaven, an enter∣tainment at which the saints feast with the highest plea∣sure. <HI>How sweet</HI> (said the Psalmist) <HI>are thy words to my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter than honey to my mouth!</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxix.103.</NOTE> <HI>O how love I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> my meditation all the day!</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxix.97.</NOTE> <HI>As the hart pant∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> shall I come and appear before God?</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Psal. xlii.1, 2.</NOTE> <HI>How amiable are thy tabernacles, Lord God of hosts; my soul long∣eth, yea even fainteth for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxxiv.1, 2.</NOTE> So fond was David of the house of God, that he even envied the swallows and sparrows their happiness in building their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> around it; yea, he declares, that he <HI>had rather be a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeper in the house of his God, than to dwell in the</HI> most <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id <HI>tents of wickedness.</HI><NOTE N="‖‖" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxxiv.10.</NOTE> But how directly contrary
<PB N="6" REF="011980_0004_0F87ED8D1B273BA0"/>
to these holy desires is the temper of your soul? You had rather indulge yourself in sin, than take the least step to∣ward holiness; you are content to let the precious waters of the sanctuary run to waste, rather than stoop to drink of them as they glide along: And thus your poor soul is making no improvement in divine knowledge; you are loving darkness rather than light, because your deeds are evil; and if it should ever please God to regenerate you by his holy spirit, what a small stock of knowledge will you have to be a foundation for the exercise of grace, and the performance of duty in your Christian course! I speak of your regeneration only as a <HI>possible</HI> thing; but at the same time I solemnly warn you, from the word of God, that so long as you remain negligent of the means of grace, there is not the least <HI>probability</HI> that God will ever change your heart, nor the least encouragement for you to hope for his mercy. Such is the nature of your sin.</P>
<P N="2">II. Let me now, in the second place, represent to you <HI>the aggravations</HI> of it. And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is aggravated by <HI>the greatness, excellency, and importance of the gospel.</HI> If the gospel, and the service which it requires, were things indifferent, or of little im∣portance, the charge against you for neglecting them would not run so high; but they are things of the most excellent nature, and of the highest importance to every degenerate son and daughter of Adam. The gospel is nothing less than a revelation of mercy to apostate, re∣bellious, self-destroyed sinners; yea, a revelation of the only possible way in which mercy can be shewed to them, consistent with the eternal justice, truth and holiness of the unchangeable GOD; it teaches us the only accept∣able way of worshipping and serving him, by revealing to us a glorious Mediator, through whom our worship is to be directed to God, and by whose precious righteous∣ness we and our services are rendered acceptable in his fight. And is not this a most glorious and valuable dis∣covery to fallen man? Consider the infinite expence whereby Reconciliation was purchased, and the mediator∣ial way of access to the mercy seat obtained: The bl<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od of bull<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and goats could never have availed; thous<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="7" REF="011980_0004_0F87ED8D1B273BA0"/>
rams, and ten thousand rivers of oil, would not have been an adequate offering; Lebanon would not have been sufficient to burn, nor all the beasts thereof for a burnt-offering; nothing less than the blood of the Son of God could redeem us from the curse of the law, and open the way for our restoration to the favour of an offended De∣ity: And this, great as it was, Christ freely offered, for the love he bore to our guilty race; and God mercifully accepted his sacrifice instead of our sufferings, and is upon account thereof reconciling the world to himself, not im∣puting to men their trespasses. This glorious work of redemption is a mystery which the angels desire to look into, 'tis the object of their admiration; 'tis a work which will engage the attention and excite the thankful praises of the redeemed throughout eternity; yea, 'tis a work which seems to be the <HI>center</HI> of all God's great de∣signs from everlasting to everlasting. Christ, the great undertaker and finisher of this illustrious work, com∣manded it to be made known to all nations; and accord∣ingly his apostles went into all the world, publishing the truth, confirming their testimony with many miraculous works, and sealing it with their blood. Innumerable is the company of martyrs, who, animated with the true spirit of Christianity, persevered in confessing their glori∣ous Lord, and vindicating the divine authority of his gos∣pel, in the midst of the sharpest tortures which the unre∣lenting cruelty of the most inhuman tyrants could invent; having come out of great tribulation, they have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, and they are before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple. Of such importance did they esteem the gospel of Christ, that they did not even count their lives dear to themselves, so that they might shew their love to it, and glorify their blessed Lord. And is it not of the same importance now? How can you bear then to make the comparison between them and yourself, while you will not pay so much respect to that very gospel as to hear it preached?</P>
<P N="2">2. Your sin is greatly aggravated by <HI>the privileges which you enjoy above thousands of your fellow men.</HI> Vast nations
<PB N="8" REF="011980_0005_0F87ED8DDB2802D8"/>
of the earth live in the darkness of heathenism; even many of those places, where the first preachers of the gospel went and gathered churches of saints, are now over∣spread with idolatry or imposture, and have lost almost the very name of Christianity. Other great nations, who are called Christian, have the truths of the gospel wretchedly corrupted, and mixed with error; and but few, comparatively, of the inhabitants of the earth have the privilege of a pure, uncorrupt gospel: But of this few, you are one; you live where it is your own fault if you do not understand the truths of th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gion; you have the scriptures in you<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which you may read at your pleasure; t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I trust, is preached with plainness and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> you may examine what is preached by the unerring standard, without fear of incurring any human censure or temporal inconvenience, by rejecting what you can∣not approve, and by openly declaring against what you think erroneous. In short, you have all the religious liberty which a reasonable creature can desire; and there∣fore your neglect of the glorious gospel is base ingrati∣tude to that God who has placed you in a land of liberty; it looks as if you despised and undervalued that great blessing, which many people in the world are destitute of, and would gladly purchase at the dearest rate. Light is come into the world, and shines clear<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> but you have loved darkness rather th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> your eyes against it. How justly then <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> you to stumble on the dark mountain <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> hereafter look for light, turn it into <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> shadow of death?</P>
<P N="3">3. Your sin is also much aggravated by <HI>the evil and per∣nicious example which you set before others.</HI> Mankind are more easily led by example than by precept; and bad ex∣amples have always the most influence, because they lead us agreeable to the natural evil inclinations of our own hearts. Now consider, my friend, the danger of your example being copied by those among whom you live, and those whom divine providence hath committed to your care. You are set, perhaps, at the head of a family;
<PB N="9" REF="011980_0005_0F87ED8DDB2802D8"/>
and you know how apt your children are to imitate what they see you do; you know they learn to speak, to read, to perform all the common actions of life by imitation; and do they not learn sin the same way? Is there not a natural, wicked disposition in them, which easily leads them to follow whatever wicked examples are set before them? And when they see you living in the neglect of divine worship and ordinances, will they not be led to think them things of little or no importance? Should you take pains to teach them the nature and advantage of public worship, and send them to the house of God; yet will they not think you intend to deceive them, since it is plain, by your conduct, that you do not esteem it a matter of any great importance to yourself. But if you should in any measure withold those instructions, and be slack about their attendance, is it at all likely that they will have any inclination of their own to go? And would you <HI>chuse</HI> that they should be brought up in the neglect of this duty? The like may be said of servants, and all others over whom God in his providence hath placed you. And how many of your neighbours, who are inclined to be careless in religion, will be hardened by your example, and think the<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may as well neglect their duty as you? Think, O my friend, on the sad consequence of this!— Think how many souls, beside your own, you may be instrumental of ruining forever! And what an awful ag∣gravation of your future misery it will be, that you have seduced others to sin, to the loss of their souls! that those, whom you ought to have led in the way of righteous∣ness, are brought down with you into everlasting burn∣ings; there to curse and blame you forever, for being the instrument of their destruction!</P>
<P N="4">4. If <HI>you have by profession entered into covenant with God, and enjoyed any outward covenant-privileges,</HI> your sin of neglecting the worship and ordinances of the gospel is thereby most grievously aggravated. For have you not given up yourself to God in Christ, to love, obey, and serve him forever? Have you not taken upon yourself an obligation to the <HI>whole</HI> duty of a Christian? How much more guilty then are you, in the sight of God,
<PB N="10" REF="011980_0006_0F87ED8E9B29A4D0"/>
than if you had never made such a profession? You have increased your lead of guilt by adding falshood and breach of covenant to your sin of negligence; you have openly contradicted and virtually renounced your covenant with your Maker, and cast great contempt on Jesus the me∣diator of the new and everlasting covenant. It may be you have been in time past enlightened, in some measure, by the spirit of God, and have <HI>tasted of the heavenly gift, and the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come</HI>; and so have been induced to join yourself to the Lord in an outward manner, and make profession of the name and faith of Jesus Christ. If this has been the case with you, then your former enlightening greatly ag∣gravates your present sinful negligence; for you live in disobedience to the light and convictions of your own mind, as well as to the commands of God; you sin wil∣fully against the truth, and you have great reason to fear that awful curse, <HI>For if we sin wilfully, after we have re∣ceived the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sa∣crifice for sin; but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, &amp; fiery indignation to devour the adversary.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. x.26, 27.</NOTE> What a wound and dishonour have you given to the religion of the blessed Jesus, which you have professed! What an enemy are you to that glorious Redeemer, into whose kingdom you have professed to enter! How basely have you betrayed his cause, and given occasion to the enemies of the Lord, to blaspheme that holy name by which you are called! When they see Christ's professed disciples paying no re∣gard to his institutions, but living in direct contradiction to his commands, how greatly does it strengthen them in their infidelity, and make them think religion is but an outside show, a piece of formality and hypocrisy! O how is Christ wounded in the house of his pretended friends! How many are the followers of Judas, who be∣tray the Son of Man with a kiss!—Thus you see how greatly your sin is aggravated. I would now</P>
<P N="3">III, Point out <HI>the Danger to which you have exposed yourself thereby.</HI></P>
<P>The gospel of Jesus Christ is a revelation of <HI>wrath</HI> as well as <HI>mercy</HI>; it pronounces a dreadful curse against all
<PB N="11" REF="011980_0006_0F87ED8E9B29A4D0"/>
that despise and reject it, as well as secures eternal hap∣piness to those that embrace it. It is a matter of so sacred a nature, that it must not be trifled with, nor treated as indifferent; for it is either <HI>a savour of life unto life, or of death unto death,</HI> to all that know it. The worship of God, through the Mediator, is so high and honourable a priviledge allowed to guilty men, and the publick per∣formance thereof is a duty so reasonable in itself, so con∣ducive to our own happiness, and so expresly required by God, that the neglect thereof is highly offensive in his sight, and merits a severe punishment at his hands. But God has so ordered the constitution of the moral world, that sin <HI>necessarily</HI> brings on its own punishment: Thus, the glutton, the drunkard, and the unclean, by the abuse of their bodies, in the intemperate gratification of their appetites, bring on themselves those pains and miseries which are a part of their punishment. And thus, the careless gospel-sinner, by neglecting and misimproving his day of grace, and the means of salvation which God richly bestows upon him, puts himself out of the way of divine instruction and restraint, and <HI>naturally</HI> brings on himself blindness of mind and hardness of heart, than which there cannot be a more dreadful judgment. Hear what God says of his ancient people Israel: <HI>My people would not hearken to my voice, and Israel would none of me; so I gave them up to their own hearts' lusts, and they walked in their own counsel.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxxi.12.</NOTE> Remember also that scripture so o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en quoted in the new testament, and applied to the Jews, who would not hearken to the voice of Christ and his apostles. <HI>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert and be healed.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isaiah vi.10.</NOTE> This is here spoken by way of <HI>command</HI> from God to the prophet; but as it is quoted in the new testament, it is represented as <HI>their own fault</HI> that they were brought into such an awful con∣dition. <HI>The heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed,</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Acts. xxviii.2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> &amp;c. which teaches us, that though blindness and hardness be judicially inflicted by God, yet they are the natural ef∣fects
<PB N="12" REF="011980_0007_0F87ED8F5B261A90"/>
of the obstinacy and perverseness of those unhappy persons who are the subjects of them. From hence, I beseech you, be warned of the danger you are in, of being given up by God to the just and necessary punishment of your wilful negligence.</P>
<P>But we find another kind of judgment threatned and inflicted by God upon persons of your character. Our Saviour told the Jews, who rejected his person and mi∣nistry, that <HI>the kingdom of God should be taken from them, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxi.43.</NOTE> And in those remarkable epistles, which he directed his apostle John to write to the churches of Asia, among whom re∣ligion had greatly and visibly declined, he threatens them, that he would <HI>remove their candlestick out of its place</HI>; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. ii.5.</NOTE> that is, would deprive them of their church privileges; yea, that he would <HI>spue them out of his mouth,</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii.16.</NOTE> for their lukewarmness. This is also the natural consequence of such carelessness and lukewarmness, as well as the pu∣nishment; for bad examples, as I reminded you before, have a most pernicious influence, and draw away many after them; and if such a disposition becomes general, there will be no care taken to keep up the purity of gos∣pel administrations: Such people will chuse teachers af∣ter their own heart, or else be content without any; and so every thing that relates to church order and privileges will be either grosly corrupted, or entirely banished. And is not this the natural tendency of your present conduct, supposing it to have that influence which might justly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> expected? But if God should restrain others from fol∣lowing your evil example, so that it should not actually produce so great mischief to the community; yet he can find a way to put <HI>you</HI> out of all capacity, and deprive you of all opportunity of attending the means of grace; he can confine you by sickness, or cause your dwelling to be removed; or otherwise dispose the circumstances of your life, so as to deprive you of the <HI>possibility</HI> of using those rich and valuable privileges which you now despise.</P>
<P>But however God may deal with you in this life, yet if you continue obstinate and impenitent until death (and you know not how soon that may overtake you)
<PB N="13" REF="011980_0007_0F87ED8F5B261A90"/>
there is a more awful judgment prepared for you in the future world; you may depend upon it you will be num∣bered among those that finally reject and despise Christ and his great salvation: How then can you escape the execution of that dreadful curse that is written in the 10th of Hebrews, from 28th to 30th ver. (O tremble when you read it!) <HI>He that despised Moses' law, died without mercy, under two or three witnesses: Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified</HI> [in appearance as a professor of Christianity] <HI>an unholy thing, and hath done despite to the spirit of grace? For we know him that hath said, vengeance belongeth to me. I will recompence, saith the Lord. And again, the Lord shall judge his people. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</HI> This sorer punishment, which far exceeds the punishment of despisers of the law, is the <HI>second death,</HI> or everlasting tor∣ment and misery of body and soul together, in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, with the Devil and his angels. There you will meet with all your compa∣nions in sin, and all who have been seduced by your per∣nicious example into the paths of destruction; there you will be eternally blamed and reproached as the instru∣ment of their ruin; and there you will <HI>mourn at the last, and say, how have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof, and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor in∣clined mine ear to them that instructed me.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. v.11—13.</NOTE> The precious talent of the gospel being misimproved, you must expect the doom of the <HI>unprofitable servant,</HI> to be <HI>cast into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxv.30</NOTE>— Who can dwell with devouring fire? Who can inhabit everlasting burnings!</P>
<P>I hope, by this time, you are in some measure con∣vinced, that your neglect of the worship and ordinances of the gospel i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sinful and dangerous: If so, I might justly insist upon your immediate resolving to return to your duty, and continue constantly and conscientiously in the performance of it: But I know that the strange perverseness of corrupt nature will incline you, in spite
<PB N="14" REF="011980_0008_0F87ED901B2850F8"/>
of rational conviction, to persist in your error, if you can find any thing like an <HI>excuse</HI> for it. I suppose, when you first gave way to the temptation, and suffered your present habit to prevail, there was something in your mind that served for a reason of your conduct; and perhaps that, or something else, still hinders you from returning to your duty. As I would leave you quite inexcuseable, I will now go on</P>
<P N="4">IV. To <HI>answer your reasons and objections,</HI> and shew you the vanity and falsity of them; for let them be what they will, I am sure they cannot be of any avail when set in opposition to such plain and reasonable duty as that to which I am persuading you. But as I cannot look into your heart, I must content myself with answering such objections as I have either heard, or conceived to come from persons of your character: some of which, perhaps, will suit your case, whatever it be.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some object, that
<Q>they were brought up in ano∣ther way, and are of a different perswasion from the people among whom they live, and therefore cannot join with them in worship.</Q>
If this be your case, I beg you to take notice, that it is not the design of this address to increase a party, nor draw you over to any pro∣fession or practice which you cannot with a safe <HI>conscience</HI> comply with. Religious liberty is a precious jewel, we cannot be too jealous of attempts to deprive us of it, nor too strenuous to withstand and frustrate them, but let me ask, is it not your duty to worship God with your fol∣low Christians, and hear his word preached? and are not these duties performed in the society of Christians among whom you live? and tho' all the circumstances and forms of these religious services are not exactly agree∣able to your mind, yet are not the main and essential parts of them sufficiently right? Do we not worship the one God, through the one Mediator, Jesus Christ? Do you not think that God accepts us so far as we are sincere, notwithstanding our disagreement in opinion with you? If so, then is it not more bl<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble to neglect this im∣portant duty than it would be to join with us in perform∣ing it? Did not our Lord blame the Pharisees, who were
<PB N="15" REF="011980_0008_0F87ED901B2850F8"/>
very zealous in <HI>tything mint, annise and cummin, for neg∣lecting the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faithfulness!</HI>—So long as God in his providence deprives you of the privilege of worshipping him in the particu∣lar manner which you judge is best, and yet gives you opportunity of assembling with a Christian society, where you may enjoy this benefit, tho' with some supposed dis∣advantages; so long as you are not deprived of your Christian liberty, but may, without offence, j<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in your∣self to any other body of Christians when you shall find it most convenient, why should you wholly deprive your∣self of the benefit of divine institutions, and deny your soul the nourishment which it needs? Would you, when abroad, and thirsty, refuse a draught of water merely be∣cause it was not presented to you in such a cup as you drank in at home?</P>
<P N="2">2. Some will plead in their excuse, that
<Q>they are of∣fended either with the minister, or some other persons who attend the public worship, and cannot appear with them in the house of God to hold communion with them in the exercises of religion.</Q>
To which I answer, that it must be a very extraordinary kind of offence to justify such resentment as this. If this be your excuse, it greatly concerns you, in the first place, to be deter∣mined, on good grounds, whether you have any <HI>just rea∣son</HI> to be offended: You should examine critically and impartially, putting yourself in the place of the person with whom you are offended, and exercising all that can∣dour and charity which is necessary in judging of another man's conduct: You should examine the supposed of∣fence by the rules of Christian equity, and the dictates of an enlightened conscience; and perhaps you will find that what you are offended at was not really blameable conduct, nothing more than what the person's duty and conscience required; or perhaps only a mistake in judg∣ment, an error in point of prudence, a weakness and failing of human nature; which ought to be overlooked and forgiven. You should examine yourself, whether you have not given just occasion for the treatment which you have received, and whether you have not been too severe
<PB N="16" REF="011980_0009_0F87ED90DB2835A0"/>
and jealous, or too implacable and unforgiving. But supposing the offence is just, and you have reason suffi∣cient for it, ought you not (at least so far as it concern<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yourself) to forgive it, and endeavour that there may <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a reconciliation? Ought you not to try your utmost to convince th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> offending person of his fault, and bring him to repentance? Is there not a plain, easy rule laid down by our blessed Saviour, in the 18th of Matthew, exactly suited to such cases? And how can you excuse yourself in taking any other method to shew your displeasure, while you have neglected <HI>this?</HI> Has not your present conduct a tendency rather to widen than close the breach? And are you not thereby increasing your guilt, by adding to your uncharitableness the sin of neglecting divine in∣stitutions, and making one sin an excuse for another?</P>
<P>But suffer me to tell you, that there is reason to sus∣pect you of <HI>hypocrisy</HI> and <HI>deceit</HI> also; for allowing to your plea all the force which you yourself can give it, it can by no means excuse you in omitting the public worship and preaching of the gospel in some <HI>other</HI> congregation, where you might attend without seeing the person with whom you are offended. If it is your <HI>conscience</HI> that can∣not suffer you to have communion in worship with your offending brother, is it not very strange that the same <HI>conscience</HI> can rest satisfied with your neglect of the mean<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of grace where you might enjoy them without any thing to disturb your mind? or can you imagine that the of∣fence which you have received from a fellow mortal<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is sufficient to release your obligation to the duties which you owe your Maker? You greatly wrong your con∣science to make <HI>that</HI> the cause of your negligence, while at the same time you disobey its plainest dictates. The true cause lies in the obstinacy of your will, and your disinclination to duty. It is very easy for a corrupt heart and a subtle tempter to fr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e an excuse for sin, when the will is so powerfully bent towards it.</P>
<P>Perhaps you have made a rash <HI>promise,</HI> in consequence of some offence received, which you imagine binds you to neglect the public worship; but in this you are most wretchedly mistaken, unless you can prove that sin i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a
<PB N="17" REF="011980_0009_0F87ED90DB2835A0"/>
duty. It was certainly a sin to make such a promise, but it is a greater sin to keep it; for can you seriously conclude that a promise to commit sin is binding in the sight of God? Suppose you had been one of those men who <HI>bound themselves with an oath that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiii <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> would you have starved yourself to death because you could not have had the opportunity to execute your vile purpose? Or if you should demand a just debt from any person, and he should answer, that he had made a promise that he would <HI>not</HI> pay you; could you be satisfied with this, and think him discharged from the debt? Of the same nature is the <HI>pro∣mise</HI> which is now the pretended bar in the way of your attendance on duty, and it ought to be immediately re∣pented of and broken: Your conscience cannot be so darkened as to excuse you from duty on this pretence, nothing but pride can influence you to persist in it; and is it worthy your reasonable nature to be thus governed by such a corrupt principle?</P>
<P N="3">3. Some will plead in their excuse, that <Q>they can spend their time as well at home, in reading the bible, or some other good book.</Q> Is this the language of <HI>your</HI> heart? And do you think to cheat the all-seeing God with such a miserable shift as this? Reading is indeed a profitable way of spending holy time, and you have the best examples of it in scripture: but what do you find to countenance you in omitting the duty of hearing, for the sake of reading? You might easily find time for read∣ing on the sabbath, before and after the public service; and you might have some reason to expect God's blessing upon your reading, if you attended the duty of hearing also. But now you make your compliance with one duty an excuse for your neglect of another; as if God required more of you than he gives you time to perform. Is not this a bold reflection upon him? Is it not as much as to call him an hard master? Perhaps you will not own this, but yet will insist upon it, that there is as much good to be got by reading as by hea<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, since you read
<PB N="18" REF="011980_0010_0F87ED919B227CC8"/>
the same truths that you should hear if you attended the public service.—Is not this a reflection on the wisdom of Christ, who has appointed a standing ministry in his church, and promised his presence with them to the end of the world? Would not such reasoning tend to set aside the gospel ministry as needless? For <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat do you think this order of men was appointed and commanded to preach the word, to reprove, rebuke and exhort, if people might lawfully neglect hearing them, and confine themselves to <HI>reading</HI> the instructions, reproofs and ex∣hortations already delivered in the scripture? Are we not told that <HI>faith cometh by</HI> hearing, <HI>and hearing by the word of God? how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard, and how shall they hear without a preacher?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. x.14, 17.</NOTE> Does not this convince you that the gospel-ministry is an use∣ful and necessary establishment, calculated for your good? Is not the neglect of it then highly criminal in the sight of Christ? And can you expect to be excused, under pretence of getting as much good some other way? Is not Christ the best judge of what is most adapted to do good to your soul, and ought you not to attend to the method which <HI>he</HI> hath prescribed, rather than to follow your own inventions? If <HI>you</HI> were excuseable in this neglect, others might be so too; and so there would be no obligation on any to attend the preaching of the word, which would make the gospel-ministry a vain and need∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss institution. But be not deceived, God is not mock∣ed; he that sends forth his labourers into the vineyard will call you to a solemn account for neglecting their labours: That testimony is written against you;—<HI>He that despiseth you,</HI> [my ministers] <HI>despiseth me; and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Some excuse themselves by alledging, that
<Q>they see others, who do attend, live no better than their neighbours; and it is as well to stay at home as to go, and get no good by it.</Q>
Should such a thought as this enter into your heart, I beseech you, examine it well before you suffer yourself to be influenced by it. Consider
<PB N="19" REF="011980_0010_0F87ED919B227CC8"/>
whose fault it is, that any, who attend the means of di∣vine instruction, reap no benefit; is the blame to be charged on the duty itself, on the word preached, on him that preaches it, on him that has commanded it to be preached, or on the <HI>hearers?</HI> I suppose your modesty will fix it on the hearers; then is it not ridiculous to argue thus,—<Q>because some, who attend their duty in a cus∣tomary manner, are to blame for not getting that good which they might, therefore I will not attend mine at all?</Q> With the same propriety might you argue,
<Q>Be∣cause I see my neighbour slack and lazy in his worldly business, so as not to get a comfortable living; there∣fore I will entirely leave off my business, and be idle.</Q>
Would not you justly be called a <HI>fool,</HI> if you should come to such a conclusion? And why will you not take as much care of your soul as of your body? 'Tis true, if you attend the public exercises of religion with such a careless, unprepared heart as those whom you blame, you will doubtless be as unprofitable an hearer as they; but this is not what I am urging you to; I would have you come with a serious mind, with a sincere desire of reaping benefit, with a meek and teachable disposition; and when you are come, attend with care and diligence, applying the truths of God's word to your own consci∣ence, and begging the influences of the divine spirit to render these means effectual. This is the way to get good; and some <HI>such</HI> hearers there are, I trust, in o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r con∣gregation (would God the number was greater.) And if any are really profited by their attendance on this di∣vine institution, it is a far greater argument to urge your compliance with your duty, than the contrary is in favour of your neglect. It is much to be wished, tho' hardly to be expected, that all who attend the public service of God should gain equal benefit thereby: The word preach∣ed will be a savour of life unto life to some, and of death unto death to others; but you are greatly mistaken if you imagine yourself not so guilty in the sight of God, as they that outwardly attend their duty, and yet are not benefited by it; you have the same advantages, the same
<PB N="20" REF="011980_0011_0F87ED925B277A20"/>
talent is committed to you both; and if you are both found to have misimproved it, you will be reckoned with alike; nor can you expect to escape the judgment of those that wilfully reject the salvation offered in the gos∣pel, for you cannot say that you do not know your Master's will, in some measure; and if you keep your∣self ignorant of any part of it, by your neglect of the means of instruction, the fault is wholly your own: Wilful ignorance of duty is wilful neglect of duty, and deserves the same punishment.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is pleaded by some, that <Q>they have met with misfortunes, and are so melancholy and dejected in their minds that they cannot compose themselves to attend upon divine service, and therefore it is as well to omit it.</Q> This is a most artful delusion of Satan's; and whoever is subject to it, is led captive by him at his will. Let me tell you, O unhappy creature, that you are the cause of your own misery: When God sent af∣flictions to you, he meant them for your good, to make you thoughtful, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut not distracted; serious, but not me∣lancholy: Your corrupt heart has led you to counteract God's gracious designs; instead of improving your trou∣bles for the good of your soul, you are making them the cause of your ruin. You should have humbled yourself under the mighty hand of God, kissed his correcting rod, submitted to his holy will, examined your heart and life, to see what was the cause of his contending with you; put away your provoking sins, continued close to your duty, and patiently waited for light to arise in darkness, and good to be brought out of evil: But, first to perplex your mind with God's providential dealings, and then to make that perplexity an excuse for the neglect of plain duty, is in a very high degree sinful; it shows a prodigi∣ous enmity against God in your heart; the very thought of which ought to strike horror into your soul, since you have joined ingratitude to disobedience, and are opposing your best friend in his kindest designs toward you. Can there be any thing more void of reason, more contrary to the clearest light of nature, than your absurd plea?
<PB N="21" REF="011980_0011_0F87ED925B277A20"/>
<Q>Because you are perplexed and dejected in your mind, therefore you will not go where light and comfort are to be had. Because you are unhappy, therefore you will not take the most direct way to make yourself otherwise.</Q> Can you be so destitute of the very first principle of human nature, <HI>self-love?</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are you so blinded and deluded as not to believe that the way of duty is the way to obtain peace and comfort? Where else will you go, what else will you do, to alleviate your, misery? The pious Psalmist, when he was perplexed with God's provi∣dential dealings, and ready to sink into despondency, <HI>went into the house of God,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxiii</NOTE> and there obtained light and satis∣faction to his wearied mind. He made God's word a light to his feet and a lamp to his path; and if this was your disposition, you would doubtless find your steps guided aright thereby. For the Lord's sake, then, do not give way any longer to such a wretched delusion; but beg of God to recover you out of this fatal snare of the evil one, or you will be in the greatest danger of being hurried on to utter destruction.</P>
<P N="6">6. "The want of decent clothes to appear in," is sometimes made an excuse for neglecting the public ser∣vice of God. Is this your plea, my friend? then be not offended if I should ask you, why you are not provided with such clothes as you need? You are poor; but do you labour in any honest employment to obtain the ne∣cessaries and conveniences of life? And do you spend what you get, in a reputable way, without wasting it in gratifying your appetites beyond due bounds? If so, it is strange that you cannot furnish yourself with such apparel as is suitable to your condition; and nobody would ex∣pect to see you wear better. But perhaps your <HI>pride</HI> keeps you at home more than your <HI>poverty</HI>; you are re∣duced, it may be, from what you once was, and cannot appear in the same manner as formerly; or, you think yourself as good as your neighbours, and would make as good a show as they; and because you cannot, therefore you will not venture into the public assembly for God's worship. But do you think that he regards the <HI>dress</HI> you
<PB N="22" REF="011980_0012_0F87ED931B679060"/>
appear in before him? Does he look at the outward ap∣pearance, or at the heart? Is it the opinion of your fel∣low men that you are afraid of? What if any of them should make sport of, or find fault with, your dress? So long as your conscience can witness that you are honest and industrious, and are not to blame for your mean ap∣pearance, you have a satisfaction within, sufficient to for∣tify you against the reproaches of fools. But perhaps your suspicion is vain and groundless; your <HI>friends</HI> had rather see you attend your duty in mean apparel, than see you neglect it: And if you are really an object of charity, your frequent appearance in the public assembly would put them in mind of you, and excite them to do what they can to help you.</P>
<P>If it is through idleness, or carelessness, or extravagance of any kind, or pride, that you cannot appear decently in public, either of these is your <HI>sin</HI>; and one sin cannot be an excuse for another: Therefore it is vain to make such a Plea, for it cannot be admitted at the bar of conscience or of God. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>I wish it could not justly be urged by the</HI> inferiors <HI>in some families, that they are not able to attend, because their pa∣rents or masters neglect to furnish them with suitable appa∣rel, although they make a decent appearance themselves.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="7">7. I<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o not recollect any other excuse that can be of∣fered for the neglect of divine service, except it may be urged by some, that
<Q>they have staid away so long that they are now <HI>ashamed</HI> to come:</Q>
But this is so sorry an evasion, that it scarce deserves an answer: I shall there∣fore dismiss it at once, by only putting you in mind of our Lord's remarkable words, (Mark viii.38.) <HI>Whoso∣ever shall be</HI> ashamed <HI>of me and of my words, in this adul∣terous and sinful generation; of him shall the Son of Man be</HI> ashamed <HI>when he cometh in the glory of his Father, with his holy angels.</HI></P>
<P>I have now endeavoured to answer such objections and pleas as I have either heard or conceived to be made in excuse of the neglect of public worship; and if any
<PB N="23" REF="011980_0012_0F87ED931B679060"/>
of them are such as you have been influenced by, I hope you are, by this time, convinced of their insufficiency: But whether I have exactly expressed your mind or not, or whatever be your excuse, however weighty and im∣portant in your mind now, yet there is a time coming when your views of things will be greatly altered; the hour of death is an honest, undeceiving hour; things appear then in a true light, free from that false glare with which our corrupt passions and inclinations deceive our understandings: You will then (if conscience be awake) judge impartially, and find, alas, to your sorrow, that you have been led astray by your deceitful heart, and in∣fluenced by motives unworthy your reasonable nature; you will then see the vanity and folly of the excuses which now avail with you, and uphold you in this and other sins. But, O that you would consider before you come to that solemn time! Imagine yourself now laid on a bed of sickness, and your life despaired of, your soul just going into the eternal world, to appear before the bar of God, and give up an account of the deeds done in the body: And now ask your own conscience, whether you can venture to stand the trial upon the same plea that has hitherto satisfied you? Would you dare to tell the Searcher of Hearts, that you have neglected his so∣lemn worship, and the means of salvation, which he has graciously afforded you,
<Q>because you was of a different persuasion from your neighbours; or because you was offended by some of them; or because you had made a promise to the contrary; or because you thought you could spend your time as well at home; or be∣cause you knew some that attended without receiving any benefit; or because your mind was melancholy and dejected; or because your cloaths were not good enough; or because you was ashamed to go when you had been absent so long?</Q>
How incomparably mean and little do all these evasions appear, when viewed in this Light; and I appeal to your conscience, whether this is not the true light that they ought to be vie<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>. Are you not ashamed, are you not afraid ever to urge
<PB N="24" REF="011980_0013_0F87ED93DB246510"/>
them again, when you consider that you must shortly give up your account to the great Judge? You are every moment in danger of being summoned before his tribu∣nal, and you know not that you shall have any immedi∣ate warning; a thousand accidents may befal you, and surprize you at once into the world of spirits; and how awful will your case be if you perish forever, notwith∣standing your great and precious advantages! Infinitely more tolerable will it be for Sodom and Gomorrah, for Tyre and Sidon, in the day of judgment, than for you.</P>
<P N="5">V. To sum up all, I earnestly beseech and exhort you, in the bowels of our Lord Jesus Christ, by the worth of your immortal soul, by the shortness and uncertainty of your life, by the infinite love and compassion of God, by the bitter sufferings and death of his Son, by the great∣ness and excellency of the gospel, by the everlasting joys of heaven, and the unspeakable torments of hell, by the aggravated condemnation of gospel-sinners, by all the arguments that can possibly work on a reasonable and immortal creature, to consider your sin in its true nature and dreadful aggravations; to resolve immediately, with∣out any hesitation, that you will break it off by unfeigned repentance, and begin steadily to pursue the path of duty, which you will certainly find a way of pleasantness, and a pat<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of peace. Consider how many precious Sabbaths you have trifled away, which are now past recalling, but are written down against you in the records of heaven The pardon of your past neglects can be obtained only through the Mediator's blood and righteousness; fly there∣fore to him, as your only refuge from the wrath of God, which is revealed from heaven against you. Acquaint now yourself with him, and be at peace; receive the good news of pardon and salvation with an hearty wel∣come; learn to love his word, which reveals the path of life; make it your daily study, and your nightly medita∣tion; especially let the weekly returns of holy time <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e observed in a religious manner, by wholly abstaining from all labour and diversion, and devoting the whole day to
<PB N="25" REF="011980_0013_0F87ED93DB246510"/>
the service of God and the edification of your soul: And if divine providence hath committed others to your care, see that they observe the Sabbath also, and let them have no reasonable excuse to absent themselves from the pub∣lic worship; let the duties of the sanctuary be your de∣light; be glad when they say to you, let us go up to the house of the Lord: Receive with meekness the in∣grafted word, which is able to save your soul; let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom, and pray for the Holy Spirit to accompany divine truth to your heart, that it may be there as seed sown in good ground, which shall bear fruit an hundred fold, to the glory of God.</P>
<P>But if, after all, you will persist in your sinful negli∣gence, and will not be persuaded to appear in the wor∣shipping assemblies of God's people here; yet know for certain, that there is a vast assembly shortly to be sum∣moned together, in which you <HI>must</HI> and <HI>shall</HI> appear; an assembly consisting of all the generations of mankind that ever have lived, or shall hereafter be born; you shall come forth before the glorious Judge; and there your affectionate pastor, who is now solemnly and tenderly admonishing you in the name of his divine Lord, will (it grieves his soul to think of it) be produced as a wit∣ness against you, that you have <HI>knowingly</HI> and <HI>wilfully</HI> re∣jected the gospel of the Son of God.—Think, O think, of the horrors of that awful day, when he shall <HI>come in the clouds of heaven, and every eye shall see him</HI>; when he <HI>shall be revealed from heaven, with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, to take vengeance on them that know him not, and that</HI> OBEY NOT HIS GOSPEL; <HI>who shall be punished with everlasting destruction, from the presence of the Lord, and the glory of his power!</HI> How can you possibly escape the full execution of that sentence of eternal damnation which he will then pass on all the impenitent rejectors of him, <HI>depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels!</HI> Beware, therefore, left you come into this condemnation!
