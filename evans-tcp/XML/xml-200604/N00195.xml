<P>A SERIOUS EXHORTATION TO THE PRESENT and SUCCEEDING Generation <HI>IN NEW-ENGLAND,</HI> Earnestly calling upon all to endeavour that the Lords <HI>Gracious Presence</HI> may be continued with <HI>Posterity.</HI></P>
<P>Being the substance of the LAST SERMONS preached</P>
<P>By Mr. <HI>ELEAZER MATHER,</HI> late Pastor of the Church in <HI>Northampton</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The second Edition</HI></P>
<BIBL>Judg. 2. 10, 17.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And also all that Generation were gathered to their fa∣thers, and there arose another Generation after them, which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works that he had done for Israel.—They turned quickly out of the way that their fathers walked in, obeying the Com∣mandments of the Lord, but they did not so.</HI></Q>
<BIBL>Psal. 78. 3, 4, 5.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>—Our fathers have told us—We will not hide them from their Children, shewing the Generation to come the praises of the Lord. He appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their Children, that the Generation to come might know them, even the Children which should be born, who should arise and declare them to their Children.</HI></Q>

<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>C<HI>Oncerning the Reasons inducing to the Publication of these Sermons, I have in the Epistle prefixed to the first Edition of them, expressed what they were; &amp; shall add nothing further at this Time, saving that the Consideration of the Equity of that Antient Law the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quired a surviving Brother to endeavour the perpetuating of the Name and memory of a Brother deceased, hath had its weight with me. When</HI> Coepio <HI>was dead his Brother</HI> Cato <HI>expended eight Talents in erecting for him a Tomb of</HI> Thracian <HI>marble, that his brothers Name might never dye. Shall an</HI> Heathen <HI>do thus? and shall not a</HI> Christian <HI>take care that his Brothers Name be not put out of</HI> Israel? <HI>I have thought that it was worthily done of that learn∣ed</HI> Lud. Cappellus <HI>to publish sundry profitable works of his decea∣sed Brother. So in our own Nation Mr.</HI> Dyke, <HI>Mr.</HI> Culverwell, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of late (not to mention others.) Mr.</HI> Janeway; <HI>whose commen∣dable Examples it is my duty to follow. And I am the rather wil∣ling to do so, for that these Sermons (though much short of what they would have been had the Author Himself emitted them) when first in this way made publick found great acceptance with the Lords People. As for this</HI> second Impression, <HI>it hath been promoved by the charity of a pious Gentlewoman (a Mother in this</HI> Israel) <HI>who out of respect to her own Children and Posterity, as also the good of the</HI> Rising Generation in <HI>New-England, was desirous (God ha∣ving put it into her heart) to encourage the Republication and dis∣persion of what is here presented.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Concerning the Author, my near Relation to him prohibits my saying much, nor is it needful; since it is well known that he was a</HI> Common Father <HI>unto all those Plantations in this Wilderness, where God had cast his Habitation. He was for several years, ve∣ry much exercised with inward, spiritual Temptations. Temp∣tation (said</HI> Luther) <HI>maketh a Divine: It doth so indeed, though it may be the Temptations are sometimes</HI> Horribillia de Deo, Terribillia de Fide. <HI>The Lord did sanctifie the Temptati∣ons
<PB REF="000254_0003_0FA4100F752B9668"/>
of this my Brother, so as to keep him humble and low thoughted of himself; And doubtless they were one Reason of his being such an inward searching Preacher, as I know not whether he hath left any amongst us, in that respect going beyond him. Howbeit, just before his last sickness, God did graciously lift up the Light of his Counte∣nance and shine in upon his Soul. For the last words which I find written in his</HI> Diary, <HI>are these,</HI> July 10. 1669. This Evening if my heart deceive me not, some sweet workings of Soul after God in Christ, according to the Terms of the Covenant of grace; The general and Indefinite expression of the Promise was an en∣couragement to look to Christ, that he would do that for me, which he hath promised to do for some, and I need as much as any; The Lord hath not excluded me, nor dare I exclude my self. But if the Lord will help I desire to lye at his Feet, and ac∣cept of grace in his own way, and to wait his own Time through his Power enabling of me; Though I am dead, without strength, help or hope in my self, yet the Lord requireth nothing at my hand in my own strength▪ but that by his Power I should look to him, to work all my works in me and for me. When I find a dead heart the thoughts of this are exceeding sweet and reviving, be∣ing full of grace, and discovering the very heart and love of Jesus. <HI>These were (so far as doth appear) the last words that ever he wrote in his Life. The next day, finding himself not well, he set his House in order, his sickness proving a violent Feaver. Af∣ter twelve dayes Conflict with that disease he went to the Bosome of that Jesus, of whose heart▪ and love towards him, He had such a late and blessed discovery. This did the Lord find him. And bles∣sed is that Servant whom the Lord at his coming shall find so doing.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A WORD TO THE Present and succeeding Generation IN NEW-ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1 Kings 8. 57.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake as.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the beginning of this Chapter we have the Historical Relation of a General Assembly of the Representative Body of <HI>Israel,</HI> the end whereof was the bringing in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of God into its proper place▪ from <HI>ver.</HI> 1. to 6. This occasion <HI>Solomon</HI> improves unto the manifestation of his Piety towards God▪ and respect towards <HI>Israel;</HI> as will be evi∣dent by taking a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the several parts of this Chapter, which are four:</P>
<P N="1">1. His Benedictory Oration, from <HI>ver.</HI> 14, to 22.</P>
<P N="2">2. His famous Prayer, from <HI>ver.</HI> 22, to 54.</P>
<P N="3">3. The blessing of his People <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>ver.</HI> 62.</P>
<P N="4">4. His Festivals, or offering Sacrifice, from <HI>ver.</HI> 62, to the end. The Text falls within the third of these, <HI>soil.</HI> His bles∣sing: Where we have</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> A thankful Acknowledgement of Gods mercy▪ <HI>ver.</HI> 56.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> A renewed <HI>Prayer for Gods presence,</HI> in this verse. So that this Verse is an earnest Petition, expressed</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Affirmatively,</HI> by way of Supplication.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Negatively,</HI> by way of Deprecation. In the former we have 1. The Petition it self, <HI>The Lord our God be with us.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="2" REF="000254_0005_0FA41010EAB00250"/>
2. The Illustration, <HI>As he was with our Fathers.</HI> In the latter there is a gemination of the same Request, by divers expres∣sions importing the same thing, <HI>Let him not leave us, nor for∣sake us.</HI> And all this is to note the weightiness of the thing prayed for and earnestness of desire that it might be granted. Whence the Doctrine to be observed from the words, is,</P>
<Q>Doct. That the Continuance of the Lords gracious Presence with a People, from Fathers to Children after them, is a special favour of God, and much to be desired by all that are cordial to the weal of the Israel of God. Or thus: That the Lord would be graciously present with the Succeeding Generation, as he was with their Fathers, not leaving nor forsaking of them, is the great desire of those that wish well to the Lords people.</Q>
<P>See some Scriptures for this.</P>
<P>That the Lords gracious Presence is a special favour, and much to be desired, see <HI>Gen</HI> 26. 3. This we see was <HI>Moses</HI> his great request, <HI>Exod.</HI> 33. 15. <HI>q. d.</HI> what is an Angel without thee? what is <HI>Canaan</HI> without thee? See also <HI>Josh.</HI> 1. 5. and <HI>Judg.</HI> 6. 16. And that the Succession of the Lords Presence from one Generation to another, is especially to be desired, see 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 22. 10. and 28. 20. <HI>Psal.</HI> 90. 16.</P>
<P>A few words briefly for the Explication of this Doctrine: Application being the main thing intended.</P>
<P>Quest. 1 <HI>What is meant by the Lords being with them?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> First, there is an <HI>Essential Presence</HI> of God, whereby he is every where, not excluded out of Hell, <HI>Psal.</HI> 139. 7. this is not the thing that <HI>Solomon</HI> prayes for here.</P>
<P>Secondly, there is a <HI>Gracious Presence</HI> of God; and this is the thing here desired: and this contains as much good as pos∣sibly can be desired; universality, fulness, perpetuity of good is in the Lords gracious Presence. This in the inchoation of it is the beginning of Heaven, in the perfection of it, it is the compleatment of Heaven. Now God is graciously present divers wayes.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>By his Providence,</HI> there is a special Providence of God towards his People, the Lord doth in a special manner see and
<PB N="3" REF="000254_0006_0FA41011A33DF130"/>
take notice of his people, as here, <HI>ver.</HI> 29. <HI>His eyes are open upon his Temple,</HI> and upon his Church Continually, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 16. 9. preserving and providing for them, <HI>Gen.</HI> 28. 20. <HI>&amp;</HI> 48. 15; 16. <HI>Heb.</HI> 13. 5. 10 and protecting of them, <HI>Isai.</HI> 43. 2. and comforting of them, <HI>Chap.</HI> 41. 17.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>By his Ordinances,</HI> whether in Church or Common∣wealth. In this respect was <HI>Solomons</HI> Petition: The Temple was a visible Testimony of Gods Presence, as here <HI>ver.</HI> 13. <HI>An house for the Lord to dwell in,</HI> a setled place for him to abide in▪ and therefore the name of that place where Ordinances are set up, and managed with power and glory, is said to be <HI>Je∣hovah Shammah,</HI> Ezek. 48. 35. The works of God are seen in the Sanctuary, <HI>Psal.</HI> 68. 24.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>By his Spirit,</HI> working grace in the heart: there is the in-dwelling Presence of God in the Heart, as in a Temple; <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 20. <HI>Sup with them,</HI> i. e. keep a continual feast in their hearts.</P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>What is here meant by Fathers?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> In general; <HI>All Superiours, and Ancestors. There are Fathers by natural generation; immediate,</HI> as <HI>Abraham</HI> to <HI>Isaac,</HI> or <HI>mediate.</HI> In a word, all Progenitors, <HI>Deut.</HI> 10. 28. Fathers by age, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3. Fathers by office, in a Civil sense, 2 <HI>Kin.</HI> 5. 13. and in a Spiritual sense, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 13. 14. Those that are instrumental in regeneration of sinners, are Spiritual fathers to them, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 13.</P>
<P>Quest▪ 3. <HI>What is meant by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aving or for saking a people, which is the contrary to be with us?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> These two words note the same thing; one and the same thing is implied under these diverse expressions: but the word is doubled, to signifie earnestness of desire not to be left, <HI>q. d. Do not let any thing befall us, that may look like leaving or forsaking.</HI> To the more full understanding of what is intended hereby it will be convenient to shew the various acceptations of these two expressions. 1. Leaving, it sometimes taken for <HI>committing to an others trust,</HI> Gen, 39. 6. <HI>q. d. Let us not be com∣mitted unto others.</HI> 2. <HI>To desist,</HI> or break off from a thing, <HI>Job.</HI> 9 27. so here; <HI>q. d.</HI> Do not break off former kindness:</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="000254_0007_0FA41013A7C336E8"/>
That faithfulness and mercy that fathers had experience of, do not put a stop to it at their Children, but let there be a succession of grace to their Successors. 3. To cast off by way of contempt, <HI>Prov.</HI> 3. 3. <HI>Hos.</HI> 4. 11. And for that word <HI>Forsake,</HI> it signifies liberty, or freedome in leaving, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 9. 5. So here when the Lord <HI>gives over to care</HI> for a people, and suffers them to do as they will, and shift as they can, then he forsaketh. 2. To loosen on break in pieces: <HI>Isai.</HI> 33. 3. when tacklings are loosened, and the Lord sets a people adrift as it were, and lets them go off to Sea, then doth he forsake. 3. To pluck up and break down, <HI>Isai.</HI> 16. 8. the word there is the same that is in the text. 4. To scatter, <HI>Judg.</HI> 15. 8. So here <HI>Solomon</HI> prayes that the Lord would not suffer them to be scattered.</P>
<P>Quest. 4 <HI>Why should we thus pray? and why in special for the Lords presence to succeeding Generations?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 1. <HI>Because of the good that is in the enjoyment of Gods Presence,</HI> even all good, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 1. <HI>Psal.</HI> 30. 5. <HI>&amp;</HI> 63. 3. Have him, and have all: A man cannot want light if he have the Sun, nor water if he have the Fountain, nor any good if he have God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 3. 4.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 2. Because of the evil that ensueth if God leave: <HI>Woe to such,</HI> Hos. 9. 12. <HI>Wo to them when I depart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from them;</HI> the Lord is angry indeed when it is thus. A Parent is angry when he casts his childe out of doors, <HI>Deut</HI> 31. 17. <HI>Mine anger shall be kindled, and I will forsake them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>many evils shall befal them, so that they will say in that day. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not these evils come upon us, be∣cause our God is not among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> There is no help in Heaven for us, if God leave us: This is the bitterness and venome of all Gods Judgements. As very affliction is sweetned with Gods presence so the Lords dereliction imbitters every affliction: this reacheth the heart, <HI>Psal.</HI> 42. 10. yea if God leave a people, then they are sure to be given up to utter ruine. If the Soul leave the Body, it becometh loathsome, and must be buried: so it is here. To see a Soul forsaken of God is a doleful sight a flood of vengeance then breaks in, and there is no bank to keep it out: for if God leave, all Creatures leave too, so that men shall finde no succour, or favour elsewhere; then delivered into
<PB N="5" REF="000254_0008_0FA4101427A1BC98"/>
hands of Enemies, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 21. 14. <HI>Psal.</HI> 28. 11. yea, then men will be a terrour to themselves, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 21. 15. In a word, to be cast out of Gods presence is the beginning of Hell, <HI>Math.</HI> 25. 41.</P>
<P>Moreover there are special Reasons why the <HI>Lords presence</HI> should be desired to succeeding Generations, which shall be but mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> from the less to the greater: we desire other bles∣sings for Children, much more should we desire this; you de∣sire to leave an Inheritance to your Children, <HI>Prov.</HI> 13. 22. <HI>&amp;</HI> 15. 14. there is much more reason to desire that they might inherit the Lords blessing.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> Because they have as much need of the Lords Pre∣sence as their Fathers; their Fathers could not live and glori∣sie God in their generation, had not the Lord been with them, no more can those that succeed them, there is like ground to desire for the one as for the other, in respect of need, that one hath as well as other: 1. In respect of the weightiness of the work; the work of one Generation is no less then of an other, which is to serve God, and advance the Interest of Re∣ligion. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> respect of Instruments that carry on the work; Alas! poor feeble creatures little Children, and what can chil∣dren do in Family affairs? 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 3. 7. 3. In respect of Ad∣versaries, difficulties<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ No age, but alwayes there is much to hinder the work of God <HI>within</HI> are the same corruptions, Pride▪ Unbelief, and <HI>with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> are the same or worse enemies; nay, latter ages are and will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> then former, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 1.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Because this is the Generation work of every one, to pray and labour that the Lords Presence may be with suc∣ceeding Generations.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Such as do not thus, will incurre the brand of Apostates, and be cast off from God for ever for casting off God, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15. 2.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> It makes much for the glory of God, that the gra∣cious presence of the Lord should be continued from Fathers unto children, therefore this is much to be desired and prayed for. But to apply this.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="000254_0009_0FA4101599005848"/>
<HI>Use</HI> I. Hence take notice what bottom and foundation it is that we stand on: all good is wrapped up in this, <HI>The Lords <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing with us.</HI> Can we say that we are safe because of former mercyes? The Lord hath been with us in dayes of old, hath blessed our fathers, and are we therefore secure? No verily he that hath been with them, may leave us; he that hath been</P>
<P>Saviour in former Generations, may become a wayfaring man, as a man astonied that cannot save, <HI>Jer.</HI> 14. 8, 9 If we forsake him, he will forsake us, notwithstanding all former en∣gagements. It is not what God hath done heretofore, that will make us a happy people at present: it's the wisdome of a peo∣ple to discern the Lords dispensation, <HI>Psa.</HI> 107. 43. &amp; an heavy sad Judgment it is, not to discern the Lords departing▪ <HI>Hos.</HI> Are you like to have good dayes? are things like to go well in your time? Is Truth and Peace like to be in your days? If the <HI>Lord be with you, as he was with your Fathers,</HI> then it will be, otherwise not. Oh therefore learn to know the footsteps of God in your own souls, for the Lord draws near by his Spirit, and departs first by the spirits departing; therefore consider of this, have you as much of God as your fathers had?</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> II▪ What are we to think of them that never prayed such a prayer as this is? Verily they bear little love to the place or people where they live, that never made this request. Many pray for a good harvest, outward temporal mercies but not for the Lords presence: yea some there are that are not sensible of the Lords departing from them, but if they have outward Comforts, all is well others care not for Gods Pre∣sence, <HI>Job.</HI> 21. 14. A miserable frame this is: for, <HI>They that are far from the Lord shall perish.</HI> Psal. 73. 26.</P>
<P><HI>Use.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Take notice of the Presence of God, how he doth some or go, approach near, or draw off from us. If this be the great thing to be desired, then it is the duty of all to ob∣serve what grounds of Hopes, what of Fears, respecting the Lords being with us as in dayes of old. Much of the Lords Presence hath been shewed unto this people in these <HI>ends of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> Deut. 32. 2, 10, 11. We may truly say with the Church <HI>Psal.</HI> 44. 1, 2. <HI>We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers
<PB N="7" REF="000254_0010_0FA41016241C9D18"/>
have told us, what works thou didst in their dayes, in times of old how thou didst,</HI> &amp;c. It stands all to consider (both such of for∣mer Generations, that are yet surviving, &amp; those of this other Generation, that are succeeding in the room of their Fathers) What, is God with us as in times past? God was with them, &amp; is he with us, as he was with them? Let us view the footsteps of God, and mark whether the Lord be with us, as in days of old. And for that end I shall spread before you some <HI>Signs of the Lords leaving a people.</HI> And the first is this.</P>
<P>First Sign. <HI>When the Lord gives up a people to a slight Spirit,</HI> not minding the Lords Presence, whether with them, or farre off from them: Surely the Lord cannot be very near unto that people, that are not sensible of it. The presence of Gods grace is a very evident sensible thing, and therefore if men feel not this, nor mourn not for the want of it; it is a symptome the Lord is withdrawn. Hence the Lord warns his people, <HI>Jer.</HI> 6. 8. <HI>Be instructed, O Ierusalem, lest my soul depart from thee;</HI> if unsensible, and unmindful, I will be gone further and further from you, <HI>Ier.</HI> 26. when people are left to a regardless heart, respecting the tokens of the Lords displeasure against them, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> 7 9. <HI>Gray hairs are here and thereupon them, and they know it not▪</HI> feel other things leave them, but not the Lord. It is not with them as it was wont to be in respect of Trade, the fruits of the Earth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this they take notice of, but take no notice how it is with them in respect of the Lords Presence Jer. 44. 17. 18 <HI>Then we had plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil; but since wanted all things, have been consumed by the Sword, and by the Famine,</HI> They take notice of outward plenty, and outward scarcity, of abundance and plenty respect∣ing things of this life, but as to the Lords Presence with them, not a word spoken of that. As mens hearts upon serious con∣sideration of the Lords nearness to, or removal from them are affected or not affected therewith, so is the Lord answera¦bly abiding with, or leaving of a People. The Lord is farre gon when there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enquiry whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e be gone or no. Oh wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cause of awaking upon this account? What is the stirring Enquiry of men in these dayes? What is the solemn Enquiry
<PB N="8" REF="000254_0011_0FA4101802431230"/>
that passeth from man to man, from Plantation to Plantation, from Generation to Generation? Is this the Enquiry of the old and gray-headed, Oh, is the Lord with us as he was wont to be? Is this the demand of the Rising Generation, Have we as much of the Presence of God, as our Fathers before us had? Do we live as near, are we as much acquainted with God?

<P N="2">2. <HI>When the Lord takes away the chief Instruments and Means of his Presence, and gracious blessing to a People.</HI> When men have a minde to depart, and remove their dwelling they will send away their Plate, and such things as are of greatest worth and price with them; so here: Is not the Lord packing up the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Goods he hath, and removing them away, when he takes away Props and Pillars? this declares that he hath left the house and cares not much though it tumbles down, <HI>Isa.</HI> 3. 1, 3, 8 When Ordinances are gone, and they that should dispense them gone, this is a sign that God himself is gone, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15. 2.

<P N="3">3. <HI>When outward prosperity is unsanctified, when the abounding of temporal blessings is accompanied with the abounding of sin.</HI> Though prosperity in it self be of that nature, that it is hard to judge of love or hatred, presence or absence of God, with or from a people thereby; yet as it is attended or accompanied, so it is evidential, though not in it self, yet in the effects and concomitants and consequents of it: when prosperity falls on a people that have learned to want as well as to abound; when creatures are means to convey divine favour from God, and hearty obedience unto God, then they are signs of the Lords presence with a people, <HI>Joel</HI> 2. 16. But when men have prospe∣rity, outward riches, and know not what to do with them, be∣sides making gods of them, this is a sign that the Lords graci∣ous presence is not among a people, when men lose Religion in the world, and what they get in temporals they lose in Spi∣rituals, <HI>Psal.</HI> 106. 15.

<P N="4">4. <HI>When a Spirit of Division and Contention in matters of Gods Worship, is the Spirit of the Times, and thence Religion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into Faction,</HI> that is an evidence that the Lord is a leaving of a people.

And thus it was in Christs time, there was a division touching matters of Reli∣gion, some for one way, and some for another, and thus <HI>con∣tending about Circumstances, they lost the substance.</HI> In a word when men become <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> irreligious in their Religion (I cannot speak it, nor you hear it with grief of heart enough) Religion is the occasion of our Contentions and breach of Peace.</P>

Secure hearts that have had many means, many warnings, many years, and not awakened, if one should rise from the dead to such an one, he would do little good, <HI>Luke</HI> 16. 31. Yet I will try <HI>once more</HI> what the Lord will do, though me-thinks my work is something like <HI>Ezekiels, Chap.</HI> 37. who was there commanded to prophesie over dead bones: I know I have dead hearts to deal withall, but yet the Lord may breathe the breath of life into them; <HI>Therefore O Generation, see ye the word of the Lord,</HI> Jer. 2. 31. <HI>You that are the succeeding and survi¦ving Generation, whatever you part with, part not with God,</HI> keep God with you whatever you keep or not keep. And to stir up hereunto,
<PB N="28" REF="000254_0031_0FA4102BE4A5B6C0"/>
Consider, 1. <HI>That the Lord will most undoubtedly leave and forsake you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nless you do to the utmost of what you can do to keep him amongst you.</HI> The Lord is resolved on it, he will not abide with you, except you do be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ech him with your prayers tears, cries and groans not to be gone. <HI>Solomon</HI> did no more then need required, when he cried to him, <HI>Be with us.</HI> Verily the Lord will not thrust himself upon such a Genera∣tion as do but little care for his P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sence. If you are of an indifferent spirit, at a kind of disway in your own thoughts as it were the Lord will soon resolve the case, <HI>Psa.</HI> 132. 11, 12. And therefore take the Counsel the Lord gives, <HI>Jer.</HI> 6. 8. <HI>Be instructed, lest my Soul depart from you.</HI> Make no other account but the Lord will take away his Presence &amp; leave you desolate, except you rowse up out of your security, and be more in earnest with him, then you have been hitherto. Those en∣deavours that you have put forth, will not keep God amongst you: if you seek him with all your heart and soul, you may find him. <HI>Deut.</HI> 4 and after the same manner that he is found, he is kept amongst a peo∣ple, and therefore I may make use of those words, <HI>Who is on the Lords side,</HI> who? <HI>Who</HI> is bent to keep the Presence of the Lord with them, as he was with their fathers, <HI>Who?</HI> Ah! how will you ever be able to stand before God, men, or your own consciences another day when it shall be charged upon you, that it was because of your sloth &amp; negli∣gence &amp; supine security, that God is gone from the midst of you.</P>
<P>Mot. 2. <HI>There is no little expectation concerning you;</HI> You are a Gene∣ration of great hopes and great fears; the Lord expects much from you that you will do much for the glory of his Name, <HI>Isa.</HI> 63. 8. <HI>He said, Surely they are children that will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie;</HI> he hath been expecting a long time, <HI>Luke</HI> 13. 7. and your predecessors those that have been be∣fore you all their expectations under God himself, are in you: they hope you will stand up in their stead, and bear up the cause of Religi∣on when they are gone: And so also you are a Generation of great fears; some they have a holy fear concerning you, such a fear as was sometimes in the heart of <HI>Job</HI> towards his Children, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. lest you should sin against God, lest you should forget God, and the things of God: yea the Lord is pleased to express himself so as if he had some fears concerning the rising and succeeding Generation of a professing people, <HI>Psal.</HI> 78. 5. And some they have a sinful fear; Satan and all wicked men they are affraid what you will do, they are affraid lest

you should <HI>strengthen what your Fathers have done before you:</HI> &amp; I pray take notice what you have in your hands, it is to promove or interrupt the glory of Religion; you will be instrumental (above what your Fa∣thers have been) either to the advantage or disadvantage of Religi∣on; the Name of Christ will either gain or lose much by you. If two Generations be for God and the wayes of God, this will be for the honour of Gods Name: and therefore it is that the Lord is so delight∣ed in his Name, <HI>I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,</HI> the God of three Generations it's greatly for the glory of God, when Truth hath the advantage of a double Generation; so on the contrary Reli∣gion will suffer exceedingly if you desert it. If it be said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Chro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 28. 1.</NOTE> that the very children pulled down what their Fathers builded, this will cast dis∣honour upon the way they walked in. <HI>Judg.</HI> 2. 17. and the Lord com∣plains of wrong and reproach cast upon him, when men turn away from him to the wayes of sin, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2. 5. I may allude to the words of <HI>Paul</HI> spoken in another case, 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 9. 15. <HI>It were better for me to die, then that any should make my glory void;</HI> it were better for you to die, then that Gods Name should suffer by you, as it will suffer if you keep not the Lords Presence with you. Oh take heed what you do, take he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d how you sad the heart of God, and godly men, and how you glad the heart of Satan and the wicked.</P>
<P>Mot. 3. <HI>Consider that it is the turn of your Generation to stand up for God, and what can you do for him if he be not with you?</HI> Elders are ga∣thered away both in Church and Common wealth, their work is done as to many of them already, and the Gospel and Ordinances are to be transmitted into your hands, the Affairs of Christs Kindome will be upon your shoulders; Your Fathers before you served God in their Generation. <HI>Judg▪</HI> 2. 7. <HI>Acts</HI> 13. 36. they lived and died in the Faith of the Gospel, and the profession thereof, and now you come to act your part, the Lords voice to you is, <HI>Look you now to it,</HI> I trusted your Fathers, and gave them my Laws and Statutes, and they were faith∣ful to their death, and now they rest from their labours, and their works follow them, and now I put the like upon you that I did upon them: Oh how will you manage this betrustment without the Lords Presence? Consider 1. <HI>The greatness of your Generation work;</HI> 'tis too heavy for the shoulders of any Angel in heaven to bear. Look at per∣sonal concerns, look at publick concerns, it's not work for men, for

our selves, but for God. 2. The dayes wherein you live are backsli∣ding times, <HI>evil dayes,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1. times of great degeneracy and Apo∣stacy: Alas! little humble walking now, little self denial, little holi∣ness; Oh how weighty and difficult is their work, that are now called out to stand up for Christ! It is difficult at any time, <HI>Onus bu∣meris Angeli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> formidandum,</HI> as <HI>Chrysostom</HI> saith concerning the work of the Ministry, <HI>A burthen that the shoulders of Angels might shake to come under,</HI> but especially in such times wherein we are fallen: How hard is it to keep up an House when it's fallen down, to keep the Ship from sinking, when the leak that is sprung hath almost filled it with water. 3. The hands that help they are but few, and those that hin∣der are many: what can be done at such a time as this, if the <HI>Lords presence</HI> be not with us.</P>
<P>Mot. 4. <HI>You have many special Engagement to hold God with you, he is your Fathers God, and not willing to leave you:</HI> The holy Ghost gives counsel not to forsake our Fathers friend, <HI>Prov.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7. 9 much less <HI>your Fathers God,</HI> It's an heart endearing consideration that God was the God of Relations, this helps to sweeten the presence of God to us, as men in other things they will not part with what was their Pro∣genitors, Oh this was my Fathers and I will not part with it: so here, <HI>Exod.</HI> 15. 2. he is a God left, commended and bequeathed to you by your Fathers: Those that knew how good he was, left this with you as their most weighty Counsel, that whatever you did, you would make choice of the Lord to be your God 1 <HI>Chro.</HI> 28. 9. 1 <HI>Kin.</HI> 2, 3, 4 3. You have the pattern and example of those that were before you to encourage hereunto: what is it not well with them? did they not live in peace, and die in comfort? <HI>Peace and Truth was in their dayes;</HI> they never repented of their choice they made. Verily their holiness will be a dreadfull witness against you, when the Lord shall say as <HI>Jer.</HI> 22. 15, 16. but Gods presence was life to them: we may well say as <HI>Ruth,</HI> 1. 16. <HI>Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from follow∣ing after thee; whither thou goest I will go, thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.</HI> 4. The cost and care that Predecessors have been at that so they might leave God with Children, is to be seriou∣sly thought of; they may say of the Gospel and Ordinances thereof, as 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23. 17. They purchased them with the hazard of their lives, as sometimes <HI>Jacob</HI> gave <HI>Ioseph</HI> a blessing, that he took out of the

hand of the Amorites with his sword and bowe, <HI>Gen.</HI> 48. 22.</P>
<P>Mot. 5. <HI>What will become of you if God be not with you?</HI> what a condition will you then be in, if God leave you, and cast you out of his sight? <HI>Ier.</HI> 16. 12. 13 1. Your sins will be worse then the sins of o∣thers, 2 <HI>Kin.</HI> 21. 11. 2. You will not be one whit better in respect of any spiritual advantage, that you have sprung from those that had the Lord to be their God, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16. 2, 3 4. 5. <HI>Isa.</HI> 57. 3. 4. 3.
