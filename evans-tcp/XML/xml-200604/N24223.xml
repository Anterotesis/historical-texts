<STAGE>Orvill, Abraham Bellamy.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORVILL.</SPEAKER>
<L>AND have you then determined to reject him?</L>
<L>Are you resolved to cast him off forever?</L>
<L>Shall he be doomed to bear, through all the woes</L>
<L>Of life, paternal curses on his head?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ABRAHAM.</SPEAKER>
<L>I do not curse him.—Let him do the best</L>
<L>He can: But perjured be my soul, if ever I</L>
<L>Assist him more.—He long has disobeyed</L>
<L>My just commands, despis'd my tenderest counsels,</L>
<L>Scorn'd my rebukes, &amp; with vile hand has squander'd</L>
<L>My hard-earned property upon his lusts.</L>
<L>Now let him feel the folly of his conduct.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORVILL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Reflect a moment, O my friend, on this</L>
<L>Most dangerous, inconsiderate resolution.</L>
<L>Your son is flighty, gay and thoughtless; warm</L>
<L>In his affections, desperate in his courage;</L>
<L>His heart is open, generous and sincere;</L>
<L>But young, and unexperienced in the world,</L>
<L>The falsly glittering charms of vice have caught</L>
<L>His heedless soul, and like a wandering fire,</L>
<L>Have drawn him from the straighter path of duty.</L>
<L>For this, he claims your pity more than your</L>
<L>Displeasure.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ABRAHAM.</SPEAKER>
<L>Pity! Can I pity him,</L>
<L>Who, without pitying me, has ruined half</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="032019_0005_0FF0AC08B1453478"/>Of my estate? Who not content with all</L>
<L>A father's fond partiality could grant,</L>
<L>With an expensive education, with the means</L>
<L>Of gaining wealth, and meriting esteem,</L>
<L>Must still persist in hurrying down disgrace</L>
<L>Upon himself, his parents, and his friends.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORVILL.</SPEAKER>
<L>And are you well convinced</L>
<L>He cannot be reclaimed? Are there no means</L>
<L>To touch his bosom with a sense of duty?</L>
<L>Are there no secret avenues to his conscience?</L>
<L>I <HI>know</HI> there are.—The strong, the just impressions</L>
<L>That nature stampt upon his soul, cannot</L>
<L>Be yet obliterated.—'Tis thy own</L>
<L>Imprudent conduct helps his ruin on.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ABRAHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>My own imprudent conduct!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORVILL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, thy own</L>
<L>Imprudent conduct.—Why dost thou repeat</L>
<L>My words? While yet in tender youth, thou tak'st</L>
<L>From him, the sole support he ever knew.</L>
<L>From the gay lap of luxury and ease,</L>
<L>Thou send'st him, unprepared, to drink the dregs</L>
<L>Of poverty and shame.—No wonder, then,</L>
<L>That he, disgusted, should, in search of food</L>
<L>More pleasant, light on some few poisonous roots.</L>
<L>But once restore him to thy favour,—let</L>
<L>Him know, thou can'st be kind though he rebels,—</L>
<L>His soul will melt with gratitude, and call</L>
<L>Him, for his father's sake, to practise virtue.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ABRAHAM.</SPEAKER>
<L>O! were there but a single ray of hope</L>
<L>That he would e'er reform, and love his father</L>
<L>As he loves him, my cruel, hasty vows</L>
<L>Should perish in the wind, and my glad arms</L>
<L>Fly open to embrace him.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="032019_0006_0FF0AC0A3804C260"/>
<SPEAKER>ORVILL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then revoke</L>
<L>Thy former declarations;—I will haste,</L>
<L>Ere wild dispair shall hurry him to ruin,</L>
<L>And whisper in his ear the gentle voice</L>
<L>Of soft persuasion;—will unfold to him</L>
<L>Thy generous love, the cause of his rejection,</L>
<L>And by what means he may regain thy favour.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ABRAHAM.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou best of friends, good <HI>Orvill,</HI> go. If Heaven</L>
<L>Will pardon my extorted vows, and grant</L>
<L>My son a disposition to reform,</L>
<L>My anxious soul shall welcome his return,</L>
<L>And meet him as the dead restored to life.</L>

<STAGE>(<HI>Exit Servant</HI>)</STAGE></L>
<L>O! that the Heaven-daring act were done!</L>
<L>What fears, what terrors rush into my view!</L>
<L>My blood chills at the thought! To tear the soul</L>
<L>From its loved home,—to cease to be,—or far,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="032019_0007_0FF0AC0C3A952D58"/>Far worse, plunge into unknown, endless being!—</L>
<L>O! horror! horror!—Yet I've once resolved—</L>
<L>Hah! Shall a few wild starts of conscience fright</L>
<L>Me from my steadfast purpose!—Conscience, hush!</L>
<L>Cease, cease thy struggling. Cry out 'guilty,' now</L>
<L>No more.—This world I hate, and all its uses;—</L>
<L>Its best enjoyments are but pains to me;—</L>
<L>Loathsome, insipid, and unprofitable.</L>
<L>My reputation I have sold.—All that</L>
<L>Can sugar o'er the woes of human life</L>
<L>Most wantonly I've lost.—The only part</L>
<L>Immortal of myself is gone, and what</L>
<L>Remains is bestial,—fit, and only fit</L>
<L>To perish from the sight of human eyes.</L>
<L>Farewell—my fond—fond hopes of bliss on earth—</L>
<L>My longings after sweet applause,—and all</L>
<L>Ye promised scenes of mirth and dissipation!—</L>
<L>Farewell, companions of my vice!—Ye, whom</L>
<L>The ties of nature bind to me,—adieu!</L>
<L>Farewell, thou vital air! thou holy light!</L>
<L>Farewell, sweet Life! and, O ye marble Heavens!</L>
<L>Whom I've implored, in vain, to snatch my soul</L>

<L>Myself from life! Impassioned angels come,</L>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> ORVILL.</STAGE>
<L>Forbear!</L>
<L>Rash youth, forbear! Thy barbarous hand restrain!</L>
<L>What frantic fit of desperation,—what</L>
<L>Bewitching frenzy,—what malignant fiend,</L>
<L>Hath wrought, with magic power, upon thy soul,</L>
<L>And urged thee, scorpion-like, to sting thyself?</L>
<L>Why war with nature?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALPHONSO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Generous friend, retire.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="032019_0008_0FF0AC0E428245E0"/>Thy presence once I loved; but now I hate thee.</L>
<L>Forgive me: 'Tis no fault of mine.—I hate</L>
<L>The light,—I hate the world,—I hate myself.</L>
<L>Leave me one moment to myself; then come</L>
<L>And shew me the last office of a friend.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORVILL.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, wretched, guilty youth, I will not let leave thee.</L>
<L>I'll stay and prove, by powerful arguments,</L>
<L>Drawn fresh from nature, and from nature's God,</L>
<L>Thou need'st far other offices than those</L>
<L>Thy voice declares. Fond friendship's highest act</L>
<L>Shall save thy soul. But first declare, what motive</L>
<L>Compelled thee to attempt this desperate deed?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALPHONSO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Compel me not, kind <HI>Orvill,</HI> to prolong</L>
<L>A life, that is but to be wretched.—Go—</L>
<L>I call thee kind, because thou'rt used to appear so;</L>
<L>More cruel than the tyger now thou seem'st.</L>
<L>—Yet if thou wilt not leave me, my sad tale</L>
<L>Of woe I will unfold.—My heart was once</L>
<L>Both innocent and gay. Unknown to vice,</L>
<L>It beat not for its fascinating charms.</L>
<L>All I could wish was mine. My friends were true,</L>
<L>My parents kind. Secluded from the world</L>
<L>I liv'd, as well thou know'st, till growing years</L>
<L>Called me to enter a Collegiate life.</L>
<L>Here a new aera, in my morals, opened.</L>
<L>Lured on to vicious pleasures, by example,</L>
<L>And their own novel relish, soon my conscience</L>
<L>Asunder broke all moral ties.—A sense</L>
<L>Of honor then alone restrained my hand</L>
<L>And heart, from all that folly could devise,</L>
<L>Or madness execute.—By nature formed</L>
<L>With passions strong and ardent, was it strange</L>
<L>The snaky charm of gaming should engross</L>
<L>My unexperienced soul?—The anxious doubt,</L>
<L>The long, the deep suspence, and quick relief;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="032019_0009_0FF0AC1047C92618"/>The sudden change from joy to grief, from grief</L>
<L>To joy,—the desperate menaces of fear,—</L>
<L>The flattering promises of hope,—all pleased</L>
<L>While present, and when gone, the craving void,</L>
<L>Left in my heart, invited their return.</L>
<L>Thus rolled away, in dissipation wasted,</L>
<L>Four rapid years; when on the parting eve',</L>
<L>At one mad stake, I lost, I threw away,</L>
<L>All that my father gave me to discharge</L>
<L>The long arrears of many a wasteful hour.</L>
<L>Incensed at this, my father cast me helpless</L>
<L>On the wide world, and bade me never see</L>
<L>His face again.—Banished from home, from all</L>
<L>The soft endearments of domestic life,</L>
<L>And doomed to hopeless poverty and shame,</L>
<L>With curses heaped upon my guilty head,</L>
<L>Think'st thou I can endure the scornful jests</L>
<L>Of my compeers? The sheer, the cold neglect</L>
<L>Of pride and wealth? The insults of the rabble?</L>
<L>No, with the spirit of a man I tell thee,</L>
<L>The lamp of life shall sooner be extinguished,</L>
<L>Than light me to disgrace.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORVILL.</SPEAKER>
<L>And dost thou think,</L>
<L><HI>Alphonso,</HI> Heaven will hear such vile pretences?</L>
<L>Durst thou thy everlasting welfare hang</L>
<L>On straws like these?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALPHONSO.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Orvill,</HI> I know</L>
<L>My reasons are well founded.—Have not I</L>
<L>A right to quit this world, whene'er I please?</L>
<L>Has a just God compelled me into life,</L>
<L>And shall he here compel me to remain,</L>
<L>When life becomes a curse?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORVILL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, a just GOD</L>
<L>Has brought thee from the rayless shades of night,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="032019_0010_0FF0AC12A39B6310"/>To endless being.—For this, as thy Creator,</L>
<L>Exact submission to his holy pleasure,</L>
<L>Most justly he demands.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALPHONSO.</SPEAKER>
<L>But was not life</L>
<L>Communicated to me as a blessing?</L>
<L>And shall it not be lawful to return it,</L>
<L>When soured into a curse?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORVILL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Life was not given to man to bless himself</L>
<L>Alone,—to pamper sense, to satiate lust,</L>
<L>And roll in guilty pleasures for a moment,</L>
<L>And then exist no more.—Far nobler ends</L>
<L>His great Creator had in view, when first</L>
<L>He called him into being.—To promote</L>
<L>The aggregate of universal good,</L>
<L>Thro time, and thro eternity, is man's</L>
<L>Unceasing duty.—Hence, while he can praise</L>
<L>His God, or bless mankind, his duty bids</L>
<L>Him live, and husband all the means of life.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALPHONSO.</SPEAKER>
<L>What is a single life to this great world,</L>
<L>Or vast extent of universal nature?</L>
<L>Think on what terms the life of man depends!</L>
<L>A single drop of poison may destroy him;</L>
<L>A falling tree may crush him into nothing;</L>
<L>A mis-step on the precipice may dash</L>
<L>His frame to atoms; beasts of prey may tear</L>
<L>His limbs asunder: Nay, the meanest reptile</L>
<L>That crawls upon the earth,—a worm, a fly</L>
<L>May force his footsteps to the untimely tomb.</L>
<L>And has the God of nature then refused</L>
<L>To man his life's disposal, and bestow'd it</L>
<L>On the mad dog? the snake? the worm? the fly?</L>
<L>To me 'tis certain, since the exalted powers</L>
<L>Of man, in prudent foresight, far outstretch</L>
<L>The powers of brutal nature, He, the wise,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="032019_0011_0FF0AC1427223428"/>The great, the just, would trust to reasoning minds</L>
<L>What he commits to serpents, flies and worms.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORVILL.</SPEAKER>
<L>But ought we less to prize the privilege</L>
<L>Of life, while it remains, because oft-times,</L>
<L>The Almighty Power himself, by trifling means,</L>
<L>Brings on our exit?—Shall not He who gave</L>
<L>Our lives, recall them in what manner best</L>
<L>Shall please Him? And shall we, with daring hand,</L>
<L>Presume to give them up ourselves unbidden?</L>
<L>If life is frail, as thou hast well remarked,</L>
<L>We ought the better to improve it, while</L>
<L>It lasts, and with more cautious, prudent care,</L>
<L>Preserve it.—The wise providence of God</L>
<L>Will soon enough, without our interference,</L>
<L>Extinguish life.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALPHONSO.</SPEAKER>
<L>But I no more encroach</L>
<L>Upon the order of God's providence,</L>
<L>When I resign my life, than when my neighbour,</L>
<L>Through malice, takes it from me.—All events</L>
<L>Are brought to pass by the Almighty Power,</L>
<L>And in exact accordance with his will.</L>
<L>We know the will and providence of God</L>
<L>But by the events produced. As, then, we know not</L>
<L>What is his future providence and pleasure,—</L>
<L>To act for the continuance of our lives,</L>
<L>May be a crime as heinous, as to act</L>
<L>For their destruction.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORVILL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Happy news for thieves,</L>
<L>Adulterers, drunkards, traitors, profligates,</L>
<L>And murderers! Let them wallow in the sink</L>
<L>Of vice and folly; let them rot with sloth,</L>
<L>Or stew in sensual pleasure;—all is right:</L>
<L>'Tis brought to pass by the Almighty Power,</L>
<L>And in exact accordance with his will.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="032019_0012_0FF0983D8F9522C0"/>As we know not the future providence</L>
<L>Of God, to follow his commands may be</L>
<L>A crime as heinous, as to disregard them.</L>
<L>An argument than this, more weak and vain,</L>
<L>No straw-crowned king of Bedlam ever sung</L>
<L>To listening madmen.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALPHONSO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Tho thou confoundst, thou still dost not convince me.</L>
<L>Sustained by reasons strong, I still believe</L>
<L>That Suicide is just. Life not our own,</L>
<L>We have no right to expose it; none to fight</L>
<L>In freedom's cause; none to repel the assaults</L>
<L>Of unjust foes; none to withstand the wrongs</L>
<L>Of fell oppressors. Even martyrs, who</L>
<L>Have sacrificed their lives in the defence</L>
<L>Of virtue's cause, must stand by thee condemned,</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORVILL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thyself confounded, thou confoundest all</L>
<L>Things else. When virtue calls we must obey.</L>
<L>What God commands is just, is right, is duty.</L>
<L>We trust for the protection of our lives,</L>
<L>To his unerring wisdom. When those lives</L>
<L>May be prolonged, by dangerous means, then too,</L>
<L>The precept, that prohibits Suicide,</L>
<L>Oft times, demands their application. But</L>
<L>How widely diverse is that wretch's case,</L>
<L>Who thro impatience, pride and cowardice,</L>
<L>Resolves to cheat his Maker, and slip out</L>
<L>Of life, without his leave.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALPHONSO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Life not our own,</L>
<L>The members of a nation have no right</L>
<L>To grant their legislators power to take</L>
<L>Their lives away, for capital offences.</L>
<L>Hence every death, on criminals inflicted,</L>
<L>Is so much barbarous tyranny and murder.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="032019_0013_0FF0AC1852FC4E48"/>
<SPEAKER>ORVILL.</SPEAKER>
<L>No member of a nation ever gave,</L>
<L>Or ever had it in his power to give</L>
<L>His life to the disposal of his sovereign.</L>
<L>From God alone the sacred trust descends,</L>
<L>Borne on the wings of universal good.</L>
<L>When universal good shall bring to man</L>
<L>A right to kill himself, then let him use it.</L>
<L>I pity thee, <HI>Alphonso!</HI> thou art much</L>
<L>Deluded. Plain it is as gospel truth</L>
<L>Can make it; plain as nature's voice can speak,</L>
<L>In every instance, Suicide is guilt.</L>
<L>The holy book of God exhibits life</L>
<L>As a set term, assigned man by his Maker,</L>
<L>A race to run with patience, and a course,</L>
<L>With joy to finish. No one virtue more</L>
<L>Does the Redeemer of the world enjoin</L>
<L>On all his followers, than a full submission</L>
<L>To the wise providence of God. Himself</L>
<L>First set the bright example, while on earth.</L>
<L>Thro dangers, griefs and sorrows led the way,</L>
<L>And bade us, with an eye of faith, look on,</L>
<L>And follow. When all means of doing good</L>
<L>Below, shall fail, this virtue then, and then</L>
<L>Alone, may flourish in its full extent.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALPHONSO.</SPEAKER>
<L>I could perhaps believe it right in others,</L>
<L>To struggle through the woes of life, and wait</L>
<L>With patience nature's call; but for myself</L>
<L>I cannot bear it. 'Tis too much for me</L>
<L>To endure.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORVILL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Art thou, <HI>Alphonso,</HI> fit to die?</L>
<L>Admit that Suicide itself is just,</L>
<L>Canst thou assure thyself of endless bliss</L>
<L>Hereafter? Wretched as thou art on earth,</L>
<L>Canst thou be certain, in the eternal world,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="032019_0014_0FF0AC1AEB6ABB18"/>Thy wretchedness will cease? Think what surprize</L>
<L>Must seize thy anguished soul, if unprepared,</L>
<L>Thou rush into the mansions of the dead!</L>
<L>How would thy bosom freeze with horror, when</L>
<L>Those gay illusions, that had lured thee on</L>
<L>To perpetrate the unnatural deed, should burst,</L>
<L>And open on thy sight, a boundless scene</L>
<L>Of real woe, of never ending torment!</L>

<L>Will God bestow on him who buries half</L>
<L>His talents in the earth, equal rewards</L>
<L>With him who uses all, and to the best</L>
<L>Advantage? Common justice frowns, no less</L>

<L>What a long train of duties, by thy death,</L>

<L>Cease, <HI>Orvill,</HI> cease. Thou mak'st me feel myself</L>

<L>O! teach me what to do! I must not die,—</L>
<L>I cannot live! If there's a state beyond</L>
<L>This life, where each receives his due reward,</L>
<L>The fruit of all his works,—too well I know,</L>
<L>Without repentance, I must there be wretched.</L>
<L>As well I know, that in this world alone,</L>
<L>'Midst numerous crowds, a solitary being;</L>
<L>Forsaken and unfriended; stigmatized</L>
<L>With endless shame; oppressed with poverty;</L>
<L>And worse than all, permitted never more</L>
<L>To see my father's face; I cannot live.</L>

<L>Thy father gladly would extend his arms,</L>

<L>Thou wouldst reform.</L>

<SPEAKER>ALPHONSO.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Orvill,</HI> deceive me not.</L>
<L>Those wrathful eyes, that stung my soul, when he</L>

<L>Can look complacent, on a wretch like me.</L>

<L>The hasty sparks of anger soon are cold.</L>

<L>Transporting thought! But can this tale be true?</L>
<L>Just reasons for offence, I surely gave him;</L>
<L>And can he now restore me to his favor,</L>
<L>Upon the bare condition of repentance?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORVILL.</SPEAKER>
<L>He can. But promise first, thou ne'er wilt more</L>
<L>Lay violent hands upon thyself.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALPHONSO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then hear,</L>
<L>And witness this my solemn declaration.</L>
<L>Till the true needle shall forsake the pole,</L>
<L>And the streams wind their journey up the mountains</L>
<L>I'll never more attempt the guilty deed.</L>

<P>WHERE have you been, <HI>John,</HI> all this while?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERVANT.</SPEAKER>
<L>My master</L>
<L>Detained me in his service. I was ordered</L>
<L>To gather all his clothes and books, and pack</L>
<L>Them up, to adjust and pay his debts, and what</L>
<L>I thought was rather strange, to clean and load</L>
<L>His pistols.—All this time he was employed</L>
<L>In writing.—Then he handed me this letter,</L>
<L>And bade me carry it, with speed, to you.</L>

<L>'Tis like his sitting out upon a journey,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERVANT.</SPEAKER>
<L>He wore a very solemn aspect, when</L>

<L>Myself a murderer, whither shall I fly?</L>
<L>Bereaved of him I loved, what now remains?</L>
<L>The love of paltry pelf has led me on</L>
<L>Thus to contribute to the horrid deed!</L>
<L>Whole worlds of gold, how freely would I give,</L>
<L>Could I restore him to these anguished eyes:</L>
<L>But, oh! he's gone—gone never to return!—</L>
<L>'The poor remains of my decripit life</L>

<L>I am thy son.—Snatched from the jaws of death,</L>

<L>To own his crimson guilt, with penitence,</L>
<L>And on his knees, to supplicate thy pardon.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORVILL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Frankly to me he has confessed his vices,</L>
<L>Explained their rise and progress, told me how,</L>
<L>By bad examples, and by novel scenes,</L>
<L>He was seduced; his sense of guilt and shame</L>
<L>Expressed, and solemn protestations made</L>
<L>Of reformation.—Still he loves his father,</L>
<L>And plights his faith to wound his heart no more.</L>

<SPEAKER>ABRAHAM.</SPEAKER>
<L>Come to my arms, thou dead restored to life!</L>
<L>My faults shall cover thine; we'll both implore</L>
