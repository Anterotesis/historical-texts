<P>Why, no, Sir, I don't complain: that is, on my own account—but then our public affairs, you know, Sir, we must think a little about them.</P>

<P>I believe, if we mind every one his own business, and leave the affairs of the state to the conduct of wiser heads, we shall soon be convinced that we are a happy people.</P>

<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me there, Rev. Sir, saving your presence; why, Sir, if I was denied the privilege of my shop to canvass politics, as a body may say, that is Lord North, East-India company, constitution, charter-rights and privileges, duties, taxes, and the like of that▪ body o'me, Sir, strip me of this darling priviledge, and you may e'en take my razor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, soap, combs and all, and set fire to my shop. Why, Sir, I remem∣ber the time when every man minded his own business, as <HI>you</HI> say, and then my customers were in such a confounded hurry, that if they could not be shaved in a twinkling, without loss of time, they'd go to meeting with their beards hanging down to the waistbands of their breeches, and I must lose their cus∣tom; but now, Sir, if forty come in together, and all in the most feezing hurry, I have nothing to do but to souse plump into a descant upon the times, and in the snap of a finger eve∣ry man is as patient and still as any blockhead in my shop.
<PB N="5" REF="014455_0004_0F92915020BB7C70"/>
<HI>arrectis auribus,</HI> they sit gaping, with solemn unmeaning phiz's, every one listens with silent attention to me, and forgets his beard, until I am pleased to dissolve the charm by closing my discourse; I tell them how I would trim Lord North, and have the Lords and Commons, (excepting the dissentients) the East-India company, Gov. Bernard, Gov. Hutchinson, &amp;c. over head and ears in the suds, if I could get at them; and then I rattle away upon grievances, opposition, rebellion and so on, only for the innocent purpose of supporting the cre∣dit of my shop. Pray, Sir, if you have any compassion for poor <HI>Trim,</HI> for heaven's sake don't preach up that old fa∣shioned doctrine of every one's minding his own business; for if you do, I must decamp, and seek a living in some town where I can find a more orthodox minister. Would you please to be shaved, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really neighbour <HI>Trim</HI> you prove the truth of your doctrine, by making me an example of the force of your eloquence; amazed at your harrangue. I had entirely forgot your business as to shave me: come, sit down.</P>

<P>Non tanto me dignor honore, domine; I know my place too well to sit down before yourself, and his worship here.</P>

<P>Come, come, sit down, Mr. <HI>Trim</HI>; and pray, no more of your lingo, till Mr. <HI>Sharp</HI> recollects the cyder, be∣cause it will grow flat by standing, he! he! he! Excuse me, Rev. Sir.</P>

<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, by all means, Sir, I'm in no hurry; but as for po∣litics I can do well enough without them here, provided al∣ways that you don't banish them from my shop; for they are a part of my trade; at least, they are the <HI>ca sa sine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ua non</HI> of my custom; and a trade in theory without the practi∣cal part, will go but little way towards keeping the pot boiling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Verily, friend <HI>Trim,</HI> thou art arch to-day. Why I have often heard thee holding forth to thy customers, with such energy and apparent zeal, against British tyranny and oppres∣sion, that I was verily persuaded thou wast infected with the epidemical frenzy of the times; but now I find thou wast only cunningly working at thy trade forsooth—truly thou art a very wag.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, friend <HI>Brim,</HI> all trades have their mysteries, and one half the world live by the follies of the other half.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray Mr. <HI>Trim,</HI> are you such a tory as to turn all our grievances into scorn and derision, and only pretend to be a friend to your country, for the sake of a living?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, between you and I and the post, Mr. <HI>Puff,</HI> I believe, you, when you would be a representative, and <HI>Trim</HI> the barber, when he would get and keep good custom, act upon much the same principles with ninety nine in a hundred of the most flaming patriotic sons of liberty. Interest is the word! But I claim the exclusive right of preaching myself, only in my own shop; every where else, I had much rather be a hearer of my good minister, Mr. <HI>Sharp</HI>; therefore you must excuse me from entering the lists here, unless it be now and then a word or so, by way of marginal note; and upon the word of an honest shaver, or trimmer, or, call me what you please, I'd shave and trim you all round for nothing, if I could but hear you settle intelligibly, what is a whig, and what a tory; what is constitution, and what are charter rights and privileges—what is the obedience due from an American Englishman, to the King and parliament of Great-Britain, and what are our grievances; for by the mother that bore me, and by the father (if I ever had one) who begot me, I do so∣lemnly affirm, friend <HI>Brim,</HI> that notwithstanding all I have heard, and the still greater, all I have preached upon this subject, I am ignorant of the essential difference (if there is any) between a true whig and an honest tory. I know nothing in our constitution by which we can claim any privileges which are deny'd us. I have never heard of any obedience, demand∣ed
<PB N="7" REF="014455_0006_0F929151B468B7B0"/>
by the king and parliament, which I can in conscience withhold; and I have no more idea of the grievances which for the sake of my custom, I am obliged to join in complain∣ing of, than I have of the political disputes in the moon; though I believe they are pretty much alike, because our's, I can safely swear, savor strong of lunacy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend <HI>Trim,</HI> in good truth, thou speakest like an oracle— I would thou and I could hear these matters discussed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fill.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say, Amen—for I hear them talked about and about every day, and many a good mug of flip do I fell upon the same account, and that's all I get by it; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, burn my bar∣room if I understand a word of the pudding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bump.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know where Mr. <HI>Trim</HI> got his learning, but, in his Majesty's name, I do solemnly declare, that in my judgment, no mere man, since the days of Coke upon Littelton, could in so few words have expressed more upon the subject than he has done; and I heartily second his motion—provi∣ded always, that we first light our p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pes, after having previ∣ously put about the tankard—Once before you fill, and twice before you light, says the proverb—You know revd. sir—he! he! he! hem! excuse me—sir my service to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hem! he! hem! I cannot for the life of me com∣prehend how it is possible for a man of Mr. <HI>Trim</HI>'s good na∣tural sense, to be so egregiously mistaken in his notions of our constitutional rights and privileges, as he seems to be; why, Mr. Speaker!—I beg pardon—gentlemen, I mean—but, no matter—let that slip—I ask pardon gentlemen—but as I was saying— for him to say as this here—to wit—that there is no difference between a whig and a tory—why what a dickens are we contending about, if so be as how this here was the case—a fine case truly—why has not Lord North and Lord Hilsboro' and that George Grenville stript us of all our con∣stitutional charter rights and privileges—the birth-right of Englishmen, which our pious fore fathers purchased with their blood and treasure, when they came over into this waste how∣ling wilderness—and has not Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hatham and Mr. Pitt, and Lord Cambden, and—and—and—Lord what d'ye call 'm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is immater al about their names—I say please your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> —gentlemen, I mean t'ask pardon; have not these great and good men stood up for our rights and privileges, against the tyrannical designs of the corrupt ministry and house of com∣mons—and now, for to tell me that there is no difference be∣tween a whig and a tory—and for a man to say as how our
<PB N="8" REF="014455_0007_0F9291552447B840"/>
constitution isn't taken a way—and that we've no grievances, and the like of that—I say, in my humble opinion, he is an enemy to his country—just as if every man did not know what constitution is— and whether we had any grievances, and so forth; why, Mr. <HI>Trim</HI> may talk his latin stuff if he pleases, with his <HI>Causis sino quono,</HI> and such like—I know some latin as well as he; and I say he's an <HI>ignoramus,</HI> if so be he talks at this rate—I hope in mercy we shall have no bloodshed; but I swagger, (I ask pardon for swearing) but I snore, before I'd give up our just rights and privileges, I'd take my gun, and load and fire and pull trigger like the nation, and fight up to the knees in blood—but I won't put myself in a passion—I ask pardon gentlemen—By your leave Sir, I'll make bold to take a drink of your cyder. Gentlemen all your healths.</P>

<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe Mr. <HI>Puff</HI> it is with you pretty much as it is with your humble servant, you can prea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h best in your own shop; but as your shop as well as mine happens to be shut up, at this present writing, I fancy we both should save credit, by leaving it to others to discuss these knotty points; for I have frankly confessed my ignorance; and if you follow my exam∣ple, it will positively be your shortest way out of the labyrinth in which you seem to be bewildered—<HI>sat verbum sapienti.</HI></P>

<P>None of your unmanly reflections Mr. <HI>Trim.</HI> I sup∣pose you think I don't understand greek.</P>

<P>Friend <HI>Trim,</HI> I like thee and thy discourse, well— thy motion is good, and thy humour pleaseth my mind; and I do verily believe a calm debate upon these matters, inter∣larded with thy pithy marginal notes would tend greatly to our edification.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe so too; and, by my aunt <HI>Tabitha</HI>'s muff▪ I protest good Mr. <HI>Puff,</HI> that I had no design to offend you in any thing I have said; and if I have offended, I ask par∣don, and that's the satisfaction of a gentleman; and now I hope we shall verify the old proverb, <HI>Amantium ira amoris redintegratio est.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, no more of your French jabbering—I'm not a man to hold anger, tho' I say it—but howsomever, I say again, rather than tamely give up my rights and privileges, I would fight to the last drop of—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you carry matters rather too far deacon? You certainly view our public affairs through a gloomy de∣ceitful medium; you say all our charter rights and privileges are torn from us—and that we are slaves. Pray consider, don't you sit quietly under your own vine, and under your own fig-tree? Don't you enjoy full liberty of conscience in reli∣gious matters? Don't you reap without interruption, the fruit of your own labours? Does any one meddle with your person or property? Are you overburthened with taxes? Compare your situation with that of any other people under heaven: Turn your eyes to your brother Englishmen in Great-Britain—see with what taxes and duties they are bur∣then'd—and you will find you enjoy liberty, freedom and ease in a degree so far superior to them, that if you have the least spark of gratitude in your bosom, you will be so far from murmuring and complaining, like the grumbling, rebellious Jews of old, that you will exclaim, with the most grateful effusion of soul, "The lines are fallen to us in pleasant places, yea, we have a goodly heritage."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or with the poet,
<Q><L>O fortunatos, nimium, sua si bona norint,</L>
<L>Amercanos!</L></Q>
That is to say, Mr. <HI>Puff,</HI> How happy are Americans, if they did but know it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>The truth is, and it is a melancholy truth, we have been lifted up to heaven in privileges, and now like the chosen people of old, we spurn at the hand that raised and has hitherto sustained us: Our king has planted us in a land flow∣ing with milk and honey, and has driven out the Canaanites from before us, and left us no thorn in our side—and now we vauntingly and ungratefully say, who shall be Lord over us? The description given of the Jews by Mr. Dryden, fits us, so very nearly, that I cannot help repeating it.</P>
<L>"The Jews, a head-strong, moody, murm'ring race,</L>
<L>As ever try'd th' extent and stretch of grace;</L>
<L>God's pamper'd people, whom, debauch'd with ease,</L>
<L>No king could govern, and, no God could please;</L>
<L>(Gods they had try'd of every shape and size,</L>
<L>That god-smiths could produce, or priests devise:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="014455_0009_0F9291565563B158"/>These Adam-wits, too fortunately free,</L>
<L>Began to dream they wanted liberty;</L>
<L>And when no rule, no precedent was found,</L>
<L>Of men, by laws, less circumscrib'd and bound;</L>
<L>They led their wild desires to woods and caves.</L>
<L>And thought that all but, Savages, were slaves.</L>
<L>Those very Jews, who at their very best,</L>
<L>Their humour, more than loyalty, exprest;</L>
<L>Now, wonder'd why, so long, they had obey'd,</L>
<L>An idol monarch which their hands had made;</L>
<L>Thought they might ruin him they could create,</L>
<L>Or melt him to that golden calf, a state.</L>
<L>But these were random bolts"—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray rev. sir, have the parliament any right to make laws for us? And isn't this a grievance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fill.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, there was a Boston minister, and another gen∣tleman, lodged at our house last night, and they talk'd a great deal about this very thing, and made it out as clear as the sun at noon-day, that the parliament have no such right; tho' I did not understand them—but I know they argued ve∣ry powerfully, and proved that we ought to resist. However, I don't like taking up arms neither, that I must own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, let you alone for that; if we come to gun-powder and cold iron, I'll be shot if you a'n't found in∣trench'd in your bar, behind a tier of case-bottles, loaded with good cherry slings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee friend <HI>Trim</HI> restrain thy wit a little—I would gladly hear friend <HI>Sharp</HI> discourse upon this authority of parliament; I plainly perceive that the minds of friend <HI>Graveairs,</HI> and friend <HI>Puff,</HI> and friend <HI>Fillpot</HI> stand in need of enlightning—and friend <HI>Sharp</HI> seems to be moved to be∣come a light to their feet and a lamp to their paths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Tace,</HI> is the Latin for a candle—I am dumb. <HI>Perge Domine reverende.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have ne objection against delivering my opinion freely upon this question, I can appeal to you all as my vouch∣ers, that I have never cloak'd my sentiments, or conform'd out∣wardly to popular prejudices, as too many of my reverend brethren have done; and I wish I could not add with truth, that too many of them, instead of inculcating the peaceable principles of the gospel, have by their prayers, sermons and example encouraged sedition, privy conspiracy and rebellion; and stimulated their hearers to every evil work—witness the
<PB N="11" REF="014455_0010_0F929156E16FC0E0"/>
late impious fast—an unparallel'd piece of solemn mockery, shocking to every serious mind—for what can be conceiv'd more horrible, than to beseech the fountain of truth and jus∣tice to espouse and abet the cause of robbery and injustice, by imploring of him a miraculous interposition for the removal of grievances, brought upon the metropolis by a most high-handed robbery, plunder and destruction of their neighbour's property, and continued only by an obstinate refusal to make that restitution which the laws of justice, equity and good conscience loudly demand? Sorry I am that such a heaven daring farce should originate with ministers—I am grieved that so many of our sacred order should, by this and other parts of their conduct, have discovered such a disposition to increase instead of curing our popular distractions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing new sir, I remember to have read of priests in days of yore, that they were,</P>
<L>—"Well vers'd of old,</L>
<L>In godly faction, and in treason bold,</L>
<L>For who so fit for reign as Aaron's race,</L>
<L>If once dominion they could found in grace?</L>
<L>These lead the path, tho' not of surest scent,</L>
<L>Yet deepest mouth'd against the government."</L>
<P>And Lilly's grammar ranks them with beasts and robbers,— "<HI>Bos, fur, sus, atque sacerdos</HI>"—No offence to you sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, hold, neighbour <HI>Trim,</HI> you are not to take liberties with my cloth, because I do myself. But to proceed— In considering this question of the right of parliament to make laws to bind us, I shall observe the distinction made by Mr. Pitt, Mr. Dickinson, Mr. Wilkes, Mr. Otis, and all other advocates for the rights of the Colonies, between legislation and taxation—they say there must necessarily be a supreme power, lodg'd somewhere, of governing and regulating the trade of the Colonies; and this is in the King, Lords and Commons of Great-Britain, but that this does not extend to internal taxes, tho' it includes the right of laying duties on such articles of trade, as they allow us to import, if we choose to import them—-and upon this distinction was founded our opposition to the unhappy stamp-act—we then acknowledged the authority of parliament, in it's full extent, excepting on∣ly in the matter of internal taxation; tho' it is very true, we have since been daily growing wiser and wiser, 'till at length, we openly avow principles of absolute independency▪ and deny that the parliament of Great-Britain have any more

rightful authority over us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han the parliament of Paris, or the divan of Constantinople. And the grand argument in suppor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of this new doctrine is, that our charter is a compact between the king and our ancestors, by which the sole power of legislation is given for ever to our general assembly. And in answer to this it is said, that it never was in the power of the king to put any British subjects out of the jurisdiction of parliament, and therefore, if he had given such a charter, it would be void; but it is said further, that it is not true in fact; for that no such grant of a supreme, independant, un∣controlable power of legislation is, or over was contained in the charter. Now, if such a power be convey'd by the char∣ter, it is either expressed or implied—that it is not expressed is too clear to be deny'd—and therefore it must be implied, or it is not convey'd by the charter, but is merely imaginary. This is a question of the highest importance to every man who has got a head, or any property to save or to lose; for the principle, if wrong, leads directly to treason and rebellion; to which we are hastening with a rapidity which I greatly fear, will soon plunge us headlong in irretrievable ruin, unless we are stopt in our career. In order to a right understanding of this important matter, it is necessary to go back and con∣sider how the case stood before, at, and ever since the time of our receiving the charter:—And from this view we shall als<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> perceive whether the present claim of parliament is new, as many ignorantly suppose, or whether it was made, openly and expressly, before the grant of the charter, and has ever since been uniformly exercised by them, and acknowledged by us. To satisfy myself in this marter, I have made a journey to Boston, on purpose to see the statutes at large; and I find the case to be thus. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>650, an act of parliament was made for blocking up the ports of Barbados, Virginia, Bermudas and An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igua, in which the supreme authority of parliament over all the Colonies is most clearly and expressly cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>med, and it is declared "that they are, and ought to be, subordinate to, and dependant upon England; and have, ever since the planting thereof, been, and ought to be subject to such laws, orders and regulations, as are, or shall be made by the par∣liament of England.—Any letters patent, or other autho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty formerly granted or given, to the contrary notwith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nding."

<P>In 1603, under the reign of King Charles the se∣cond, was passed An act for the encouragement of trade—in which is this very remarkable clause—"And in regard his Majesty's plantations beyond the seas are inhabited and peo∣pled by his subjects of this kingdom of England; for the maintaining a greater correspondence and kindness between them, and keeping them in a firmer dependance upon it, and rendering them yet more beneficial and advantageous unto it, in the further employment and increase of English shipping and seamen, vent of English woollen and other manufactures and commodities, rendering the navigation to and from the same, more safe and cheap, and making this kingdom a staple, not only of the commodities of those plantations, but also of the commodities of other countries and places, for the supply∣ing of them; and it being the usage of other nations to keep their plantation-trade to themselves:" &amp;c. Our charter was granted by King William and Queen Mary, in 1692, which impowers the general-court to make laws, "so as the same be not repugnant or contrary to the laws of the realm of England." And in 1696, during the same glorious reign, an act of parliament was made extending all the acts of trade to the Colonies, and requiring all governors and commanders in chief, "to take a solemn oath to do their utmost, that all the clauses, matters and things contained in that and former acts of parliament, relating to the colonies and plantations be punctually and <HI>bona fide</HI> observed." And it is therein express∣ly e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acted, "That all laws, bye-laws, usages and customs, at this time, or which hereafter shall be in practice, or endea∣voured or pretended to be in force or practice, in any of the said planta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions, which are in any wise repugnant to the be∣forem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntioned laws or any of them, so far as they do relate to the said plantations, or any of them, or which are any ways repugnan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> present act, or any other law hereafter to be made in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kingdom, so far as such law shall relate to and mention the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d plantation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>egal, null and void to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>" Thus it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that two and forty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of our charter, the juris∣diction
<PB N="14" REF="014455_0013_0F92915A669A2808"/>
of parliament over us, was openly and explicitly claimed; and again, twenty-nine years before; and then in the charter itself, this supreme jurisdiction is expressly reser∣ved; and four years after it is again confirmed in the most positive terms, and all governors bound by an oath to see it submitted to. Now, when we consider this claim, openly and repeatedly made, before, at, and immediately after, the grant∣ing and accepting of the charter, if the charter can be view'd in the light of a compact, is not this evidently one essential article of the agreement, on our part, namely, that we will ac∣knowledge and submit to the jurisdiction of parliament? It is plain we accepted the charter under this condition. How then can this, with the least colour of truth, be called a new claim? Especially, when this right of parliament, has not only been thus amply claimed, but has been all along exercised, in va∣rious instances, and without any opposition, denial or question on our part—and this I find to be the case in fact—for, from the time of our charter, in every reign, acts of parliament have been continually making, imposing duties, and for re∣gulating the trade, manufactures and internal government and police of this and the other colonies;—thus, duties have been imposed and paid upon sugar, rum, molasses, coffee, wines, &amp;c. and on the other hand, bounties and premiums have been granted on various articles; the trade of hatters, and the manufacture of iron, by slitting mills, has been regu∣lated and restrained—wool prohibited from being water-born —the post-office erected—the rates of coin established—the cutting of pine trees prohibited—lands made liable to the pay∣ment of debts—the statute of wills extended to the colonies— the paper current restrained—indented servants impowered to inlist—troops raised here made subject to the articles of war —acts of assembly made void—and in divers other instances has this supreme right of parliament been exercised and ac∣quiesced in, continually, without interruption, from the usur∣pation of Oliver Cromwell to the reign of George the third.</P>

of a compact as you seem to suppose, why I'm free to own, that I don't see so much reason to complain; but then how can that be? For I'm sure Mr. Samuel Adams told the house, last sessions, as how the tea act was an entering wedge, contri∣ved by Lord North, to enslave all the colonies, and Col. Han∣cock said as much. What is your opinion of the tea act, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>My opinion is this. Before the late tea act was made, no tea could be shipped to America▪ unless the merchant first paid a duty of one shilling sterling a pound; and this du∣ty was paid in England, and the merchant took the risque of it's ever reaching America. This made tea so dear, that the Dutch could greatly undersell the English East-India compa∣ny; and the American merchants, at lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> some of them, found their account in purchasing tea of the Dutch, and run∣ning i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> here; wherefore to enable the English to sell as cheap as the Dutch, the parliament took off nine pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce of the du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and left only three pence; and this is not paid before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea arrives safe here, but must be paid by the merchant before it is landed. And with the same view, they by another act, ena∣bled the East-India company to sell the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r tea by wholesale, at public auction, in Boston; by this means, if we did not fool∣ishly oppose it, instead of paying from a dollar to eight shillings a pound for tea, we might have it at two pistareens, or half a dollar, at most.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a mighty grievance truly; who would not fight rather than be deprived of the liberty of paying treble price for what they buy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the grievance complained of lies here. This act laying the three penny duty on tea, expressly mentions, among other purposes, the raising a revenue: This, say we, is taking money out of our pockets without our consent; and it is argued, that if they may do it in this trifling instance, they may do it in all others; and will go on till they leave us nothing. Upon which I would observe, in the first place, that it is not true, that this is taking money out of our pockets without our consent; because we are not compell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to buy; and if we will buy, the small pittance which we pay for the duty, we pay with our own consent, as much as we do any money which we pay for any commodity we buy. The same might as well be said, when we buy a quart of rum, or a dram, for when we pay for it, we pay our proportion of the duty laid by act of parliament on molasses: This we have done a long time, and never found out that it was a grievance, or
<PB N="17" REF="014455_0016_0F92915E9F9E67F8"/>
that we were thereby made <HI>slaves</HI>—but the consequence is false and absurd; for it can never follow, that because we submit to a <HI>reasonable</HI> law, therefore we must be called to submit to the most tyrannical, unjust and unreasonable laws. And what is the danger from this law, any more than from other reve∣nue laws to which we have so long submitted? Those laws have all along, in fact, raised a revenue; and because this is mentioned in the act, can this possibly alter the case? Yes, say our patriots, this is claiming a right to tax us; but I deny it; for as I have clearly shewn, this is no other claim than has been made, exercised and submitted to, for more than a century: It is essentially different from taxing us; for a tax is raised by compulsion, whether we will or no; but this is a regulation of trade, by which, though it may raise a revenue, and is designed for this purpose, yet no man can be compelled to pay any part of it; and if he does, it is his own voluntary act, as much as when he chooses to drink wine or rum, rather than cyder, or to wear English cloth, rather than homespun; and they are doing no service to their country, who thus ab∣surdly place tax acts and revenue laws upon the same footing and infer a right of taxation, from a right of legislation in other respects. But further, the tea act, as it is called, was made in the seventh year of the present reign; and the pre∣amble, which I took a copy of, runs thus: "Whereas it is expedient, that a revenue should be raised in your Majesty's dominions in America, for making a more certain and ade∣quate provision for defraying the charge of the administration of justice, and the support of civil government in such provinces where it shall be found necessary, and towards further defray∣ing the expences of defending, protecting and securing the said dominions."—Now it is generally supposed, that this express purpose of raising a revenue, in the colonies, is en∣tirely new and unprecedented; but to shew that this is a mistake, I will read you a copy of the preamble to an act, passed in the fourth year of this reign, which is thus, "Where∣as it is expedient, that new provisions and regulations should be established for improving the revenue of this kingdom, and for extending and securing the navigation and commerce between Great-Britain and your Majesty's dominions in America, which by the peace have been so happily enlarged: And whereas it is just and necessary that a revenue be raised in your Majesty's said dominions in America, for defraying the expences of de∣fending, protesting and securing the same," &amp;c. and then the
<PB N="18" REF="014455_0017_0F929175AB771EF8"/>
act goes on to lay duties on sugars, wines, East-India goods, &amp;c. imported from Great-Britain, &amp;c. This act has been, and still is, submitted to, without the least complaint. Now I should be glad to know, what difference there is between these two preambles, so far as respects the matter of raising a revenue.</P>

<P>Nay, so long ago as the year 1670, in an act made for regulating the plantation trade, one reason expresly as∣signed, is that otherwise "the trade of them would, in a great measure be diverted from England, and carried else∣where, and his Majesty's customs and revenues much lessened." In short, every revenue act is, in the nature of it, an act for raising a revenue, whether it be so expressed or not; and it is trifling, at this time of day, to start an objection, which does not carry the force even of a quibble. If it be said, that the money raised by this act is misapplied, because our civil offi∣cers are paid out of it; I answer, this is a distinct matter: The monies raised by this, and all other revenue acts, are, and, for more than a century, have been, paid into his Ma∣jesty's Exchequer; and if, when there, instead of being ap∣plied towards easing British subjects in their taxes, as former∣ly, they are now applied for our ease, by paying the salaries of our Governor, Judges, &amp;c. which, otherwise, we must pay by an internal tax on our polls and estates, it seems as if we could have no reason to complain of this as a grievance: However, even though the money when raised was never so grosly misapplied, it would by no means affect the legality and constitutional right of raising it; these are matters quite distinct and independent of each other.</P>

<P>That the new method of appointing the council, is an alteration of that part of our charter is true, and that the new regulation respecting jurors is different from that pre∣scribed by our province law is also true, but that these are grievances, may well be questioned.—The English constitu∣tion has ever been thought by the wisest men of all nations the best form of government in the whole world—and if so, these two alterations in our constitution are so far from being grievous, that they are benefits, because they bring us nearer to perfection—for our jurors are now to be chosen in the same manner they are in England; and our council being now made independent of the governor and people, and removeable only

by the King, as the governor is, brings them to a much nearer resemblance to the house of Lords; and besides, both council and juries are now upon exactly the same footing as they are in New-Hampshire, New York and all the southern govern∣ments, and in all the West India Islands, so that if this makes us slaves, all those other governments, as well as England, are, and ever have been, slaves—and the same may be ob∣served of the King's paying his governor and judges, for the case is just the same in all King's governments; and in England likewise, so far as respects the judges—and if we look back to former times, and consider how our council was situated.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Boston minister, as well as some others, I'm sorry to say it, has much to answer for—he knows better— the Quebec-bill can no more effect our civil or religious liber∣ties, than the laws of Holland can—what parliament has done is no more than they were bound to do, by every rule of equity and common justice; The Canadians surrendered their country to his Britannic Majesty upon express condition, among others that they should enjoy the free exercise of their religion; and to this end, that they should have a Roman-catholic bishop, to be approved of by the King of England — this was one article of the capitulation, expresly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to by the general to whom they surrendered—this engagement
<PB N="23" REF="014455_0022_0F92917BA0B07C08"/>
is now confirmed by Parliament, and this is all—now it is plain, they are entitled to the enjoyment of their religion, according to the full extent and meaning of this agreement, or their country ought to be restored to them—and if the English go∣vernment intended to comply with their terms of capitulation, ought they not to give them the fullest assurance of it, by confirming them by an act? Surely, if Parliament is to be blamed for any thing, it should seem to be rather, that they have not quieted the minds of the Canadians, by giving them this assurance before—for we must remember, that their reli∣gion is as dear to them, as ours is to us, and they have the same right to worship God, in the way they think right, that we claim for ourselves—they have prejudices of education to biass them, as we have; and they have their own natural under∣standings, and their priests to guide them as we have; and they have an equal right with us to the benefit of the gospel rule, "Do to others as ye would they should do unto you." And we should do well to remember that, "with what mea∣sure we mete, it shall be measured unto us again."—In short, the only principles upon which Parliament can be arraigned in this instance, are entirely destructive of all liberty of conscience; and in point of common justice, and the faith of nations, they can be found fault with, only upon the malevolent, unjust, diabolical position, which, God forbid Protestants should ever adopt, that no faith is ever to be kept with hereticks.—As to the danger arising to our religion, from this act, it is a mere bugbear, raised to disturb weak minds: for nothing can be more egregiously absurd than to infer, that because the King and Parliament from the plain dictates of justice and humanity have complied with their most solemn treaty made by their General, and upon the faith of which, an extensive country has been surrendered to them, that therefore the King intends to violate his coronation oath, and break thro' the condition upon which he holds his crown; and that the Lords and Com∣mons, collected from all parts of England, are joining in this impolitic, iniquitous, foolish design.—Let us turn the tables, and make the present case of the Canadians, our own. Suppose the King of France had conquered New-England, at the time the King of England conquer'd Canada, and we had capitulated upon condition, that we should enjoy our own religion, and choose our own ministers, as we had done from the first set∣tlement of the country to this time; and the French General had agreed to this, as General Amh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st did to their terms;
<PB N="24" REF="014455_0023_0F92917C66011870"/>
and we had remained ever since under the French government; and when the King of France and his Parliament had confirmed this treaty by a law, and the province of Canada should make a clamour, and say the King of France, being governed by his mistresses, intended to in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roduce the Protestant religion among them: I ask every unprejudiced man, whether he would not think, and say, the Canadians were the most jealous, unrea∣sonable and unjust people under Heaven?—I will venture to answer, yes, for every Englishman upon the continent,—and are our clamou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> less unreasonable than theirs would be under similar circumstance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Certainly with what jugdment we should judge them, we ought to be judged—but further, whence arises the mighty danger? The act of Parliament grants no new liberty; it only confirms what they have enjoyed for eleven or twelve years, since the conquest, and for a century before; and has Popery spread or prevailed in any degree in the other colonies, during that time— or has our religion suffered from the prevalency of that of the Roman Catholics in Mary∣land for many years past,—surely people must feel but little of the power and influence of their religion, who fear any danger arising to it, from the bare toleration of any other religion in any other part of the globe. In short, it is plain, beyond a possibility of doubt, that this innocent and just act of Parliament is greedily catch'd at, by your deceivers, as a lucky prop to a cause which has no foundation, but in delu∣sion; and consequently, is in danger of falling every mo∣ment,—they have persuaded you, that the two grand objects for which men in society, will fight, if they ever fight, are now at stake, viz. religion and property.</P>

<P>Indeed, they don't well consider what they talk of, when they talk of fighting the King's troops; they don't sit down first and count the costs; they don't consider that they are entering the lists with a power, which is more than a match for all the other powers of Europe; they don't consider the horrors of a civil war; the terrible attendants even on a suc∣cessful rebellion; much less, the fatal consequences of an un∣successful, forceable opposition to their lawful Sovereign and his lawful authority. England is a powerful state by sea, su∣perior to all the rest of the world combined; she can block up all our harbours, and prevent all foreign imports, and cut off all communications between the colonies by sea; by this means we may at once be cut off from all supplies of cloath∣ing, grain, rum, sugar, molasses, salt, ammunition, fish, and every article of foreign trade, either for our own necessary consumption, or for re-exportation; the shipping of the pro∣vince may all be made lawful prize, and every sea port town be laid in ruins.—By land, with a very few regiments, she may cut off all intercourse between town and town, and go on to lay waste and utterly destroy our houses, barns, fields, cattle, grain and stock of all kinds, until a body can assemble who shall dare to face them in the field. And here arises to our view innumerable difficulties not yet attended to: Our wives and children must be secured; our estates deserted; provisions, arms, ammunition, camp-equipage, and other necessaries of war must be provided; leaders skill'd in the art of war must be found; and if we think we have any such among us, what a vast proportion of them will, before the crisis comes on, de∣clare for the loyal side; and what numbers, must we be sure,

will follow them when we reflect, that this is a country of property, and consider what will be the certain consequences of a defeat: For the punishment of open traitors and rebels is not, and cannot be, governed by any certain rules of law, but is inflicted summarily, according to the exigence of the times; and what these consequences must be, it is shocking to humanity to consider: Suppose a battle, and numbers slain, and the rest put to flight; what multitudes must be sacrificed in the subsequent pursuit; what numbers taken prisoners, impaled and gibbete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from unavoidable necessity; and what then becomes of their wives and helpless innocent children; and of the aged and infirm; for then it will be impossible to make those distinctions which humanity would wish for, but one general calamity must involve the innocent, if such there are, with the guilty—but suppose by a lucky accident, a body of the King's forces, should be worsted, how long would it be before they would appear again with an irresistable force, and with a resentment that would mark the whole country with desolation and misery; imagine to yourselves an indivi∣dual head of a family, mortally wounded in battle, but lin∣gering in the pangs of death—what would be his bitter re∣flections, and how would he condemn his own rashness and folly in that awful interval; in some such plaintive moans as these, may we well suppose, he would breathe out his life.— "What have I done, foolish man that I was—why did I blindly rush upon certain ruin—now that my passions are cooled, and reason, alas! too late, has resumed her seat, all those imaginary grievances disappear.—I now die a traitor, and rebel by the laws of my country—my estate is forfeited— my affectionate wife, and our innocent babes, the sweet pledge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of our loves—how have I, who ought to have been their guide and protector—how have I left them friendless, forlorn, destitute of the means of procuring daily bread—to what hardships, dangers and distresses have I abandoned them —O my God, how shall I look up in this hour of torture— take them, O take them under thy protection—for they are innocent of the heavy crime that now weighs down the soul of their unhappy husband and father."</P>

to George the Third, must be distinguished: And however speciously the leaders may flatter their blind followers with hopes of success in their opposition, by publishing extracts of letters from England, they may assure themselves there is not the least reason to suppose that parliament will not support their authority, even to the ruin of the present generation, in this and all the other colonies, if it can't be established at a less expence: And it is as certain that submission is required only to save the honour of government; they never intend to tax us; they don't wish to enslave us; they abhor the thought; they want us to be happy and free; but no, we forsooth, must quarrel for a shadow, under a moral certainty of losing the substance in the contest. The people are told by their oracles, that, if they give way now, their chains are rivited, and such kind of trumpery; but, if they would but open their eyes, they might see that this is mere delusion; let them try the experiment of submitting; and if all their grievances are not redress'd, they may as well take up the cudgels, one or two, or ten years hence, as now. They will have hands and guns then as well as now; and the deuce is in it, if they don't think their wives, their children, their estates and their necks, worth trying to save. Some tell them they have been guilty of trea∣son already, they have put their hands to the plough, and it's too late to look back. This is the language of vile seducers; but it is never too late in this world, to repent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the soon∣er the better; they have a gracious King to deal with, and a parliament of Britons, who know the value of civil and reli∣gious liberty, and can make all due allowances for the sudden extravagancies of Englishmen, when first impressed with the fear of losing it; but it must be remembered, that the obstinate perseverance of incorrigible offenders, will put a period to the long sufferings even of the Deity. I think I can perceive, that the eyes of many begin to open; I heartily wish they may attain a full view of their danger, before the door of mercy is shut. But I ask pardon, Rev'd Sir, for breaking in upon your discourse, and interrupting it so long; the distresses coming upon my country, through the wicked machinations of mock patriots lie uppermost in my mind; and when I enter upon the subject, I know not where to stop. But I have done.—</P>

<P>Indeed 'squire, there needs no apology; you have deliver'd my sentiments, in much better terms than I can pre∣tend to. The subject, as you observe, is of the greatest mo∣ment; and happy will it be, if you, by your conversation, and

<P>Well, I'm determin'd to drop my shop preachments, or else, for the fut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, to take the right side of the question, and discharge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conscience, whatever becomes of my cus∣tom.</P>

<P>I profess, I'm of the same mind; I begin to see things in a different light from what I did: Indeed I never liked the high proceedings of the provincial congress; this affair of seizing the King's monies, and taking the militia out of the hands of the Governor, I could never see through; it is against the King's prerogative, and founds too much like treason; and I'm resolved not to go to the next, if I am chosen.</P>

<P>Bravo, neighbour <HI>Fillpot</HI>—stick to that, and you'll do well enough—I'll be sworn your business will never fail, 'till all the ports upon the continent are blocked up.

<P>Ah! Friend <HI>Trim,</HI> if all that have preached treason and rebellion, were to be tuck'd up, as thou phrasest it, the harvest truly would be plenteous, and the labourers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew.</P>

<P>Treason is an odious crime in the sight of God and men; may we none of us listen to the suggestions of Satan, but may the candle of the Lord within, lighten our paths; and may the spirit lead us in the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of truth, and preserve us from all sedition, privy conspiracy and rebellion. But it grows late, and the spirit moveth me to be getting home. Friend <HI>Sharp,</HI> fare thee well. Come friends.</P>
