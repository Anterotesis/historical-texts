<P>It was the manner of those <HI>Holy Prophets,</HI> to pass from the mention of the dismal <HI>Tidings,</HI> or <HI>Tro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>les</HI> which they saw Sinful mankind Threat∣ned withal, to the mention of the more Com∣fortable State.

<P>Thus our <HI>Es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>as</HI> here, having affixed unto the Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of the Temple, a <HI>Roll</HI> where all might Read a Delineation of the <HI>Sins</HI> and <HI>Plagues,</HI> which were then to be found upon his people, he quickly puts up another Prediction, Concern∣ing the Blessings, which God will bestow upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Church, in the Dayes, when the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssiah</HI>

<P>To P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us Ownes!</P>
<P>And this <HI>Peace</HI> is Elegantly Expressed unto us, by the Notion of mens Altering and Em∣ploying their Weapons of <HI>War,</HI> to such Uses, as <HI>Peace</HI> affords at once <HI>Opportunities</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oitat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ous to; tis</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

our Value for them is only from a <HI>Corrupt Nature</HI> on us, which herein do's often Cast Con∣tempt upon the <HI>More sure Word of Prophecy.</HI> But it is the <HI>Honour,</HI> as well as the <HI>Study,</HI> of <HI>Christ∣ians,</HI> to Penetrate into those <HI>Prophecies,</HI> whereof the Inspired, and Un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ring Word of God, is a most faithful Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r; of those <HI>Prophecies,</HI> we are advised, <HI>Blessed is be that Reads them;</HI> and that man of God who Conver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> much with the <HI>Books</HI> which had them, was called, <HI>A man greatly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> loved.</HI></P>
<P>Tis a <HI>Prophecy</HI> from the Oracles of God, which I have now produced you; and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t you should Question it, the Holy Spirit has taken the paines to Record it in the very <HI>Syllables</HI> of it, no less than <HI>Twice</HI> over for you, about the same Time that the Evangelical <HI>Isaiah</HI> prophe∣sied; there was the Humble <HI>Micah</HI> lent upon the like Errands, of Heaven to the World; and if you look into the <HI>Fourth Chapter</HI> of his <HI>Pro∣phecies,</HI> you'l see my Text Word for Word a∣gain Repeated there. Now, I pray, what is this? if I may not say like <HI>Joseph</HI> in another Case. <HI>It is because the thing is Established by God, and God will Shortly bring it to pass.</HI></P>
<P>For any to think that it is already <HI>come to pass,</HI> is altogether as Ridiculous as to say, <HI>That the Thousand Years of Satans binding, began at the Dayes of</HI> Constamine. The bare proposal of such Cruel and Absurd Interpretation, is e∣nough to beget in us, a Distast of all the <HI>Schemes</HI> that they give unto us. No, tis a <HI>future State,</HI> that is here set before us. I is then a Doctrine, which, I hope, <HI>Will,</HI> I am sure, <HI>Should,</HI> find a welcome Entertainment with you.</P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<P>There is a Wonderful <HI>STATE</HI> of External <HI>PEACE,</HI> which the God of Heaven will make His People upon Earth, to be the Joyful partakers of.</P>
<P>You will give me leave to say, <HI>The people of God upon EARTH shall have this Peace;</HI> for, I pray, where else would you look to site the use of <HI>Plough shares</HI> and <HI>Pruning books?</HI></P>
<P>There are three things, that here offer them∣selves to be Enquired into; First, <HI>what,</HI> Se∣condly, <HI>where,</HI> and Thirdly, <HI>when</HI> will be that <HI>State of Peace,</HI> which is intended for the <HI>Peo∣ple</HI> of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us in the first place Enquire, <HI>WHAT</HI> will be that <HI>State of Peace,</HI> wherein we are told, <HI>Men shall not learn war any more?</HI></P>
<P>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w this we are to know, That it lyes not meerly in the Blessed Settlement and Compo∣sure of <HI>Spirit,</HI> which Believers in all <HI>Ages,</HI> are the <HI>Subjects</HI> of. When our Lord Jesus went away to Heaven. He left us that Legacy, in John 14. 27. <HI>Peace I leave with you my Peace I give unto yea.</HI> Hence tis, that our <HI>Spirits</HI> are not Royled and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in themselves by any of those dreadful Storms that come upon the World; for, <HI>Being Justify'd by Faith, we have Peace with God.</HI> Hence tis, that our <HI>Spirits</HI> have a Disposition to Love and Serve, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that are our Brethren in the World; for,
<PB N="8" REF="000567_0008_0FA71416CAD3E960"/>
<HI>Having Salt in our selves, we have Peace one with another.</HI> Such a <HI>Spiritual Peace,</HI> is not all that we are to be Looking for; No, the <HI>Peace</HI> promised unto us, is One by which the <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Dayes</HI> are to be distinguished; whereas <HI>All Dayes</HI> have ad∣mitted the <HI>Peace, No Dayes</HI> can Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>il, or Quench that <HI>Peace,</HI> which Believers have <HI>in the Lord Je∣sus Christ,</HI> while <HI>in the World they must have Tri∣bulation.</HI></P>
<P>Well then, The <HI>Peace</HI> promised unto us, is that <HI>External,</HI> as well as <HI>later<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al,</HI> H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmony, Amity, Be Unity, which the Children of men shall have in and from the future <HI>Kingdom</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ. We are to Receive these two, as most <HI>Faithful Sayings, and Worthy of all Acceptation.</HI></P>
<P>First, The Lord Jesus Christ shall One Day, enjoy a <HI>Kingdom</HI> over and among the Children of men in the World; and this, after a more Visible and Glorious manner than ha's hitherto <HI>Appeared.</HI> Our Lord Jesus is a Blessed <HI>King; that is</HI> One of the High <HI>Offices</HI> to which our <HI>Messi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> is <HI>Ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nted</HI> by his Eternal Father; and there is a three∣fold <HI>Kingdom,</HI> which He ha's already the posses∣sion of.

<HEAD>The Last Consideration.</HEAD>
<P>The most grateful and Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dial of our Ac∣knowledgements are due to <HI>You,</HI> that are this Day <HI>Learning of War.</HI> Could I speak with a Voice, that should reach to all the <HI>Souldiers</HI> of <HI>New England,</HI> or to all that are Studious to Countenance <HI>Military Discipline</HI> among us, I would presume in the Name of all the Sensible persons in the Country, to Express all possible Regards unto them, I would Venture to say,</P>
<P><Q>'Tis to <HI>Yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> under God, that we owe the many Comforts of our <HI>Lives;</HI> we should soon be <HI>Rob'd</HI> of all that is dear unto us, in the World, if it were not known that there were such as <HI>You</HI> to set the <HI>Price</HI> of all. Our <HI>Plough Shares</HI> and <HI>Praning books</HI> would not be able to seed us, if your <HI>Swords</HI> and <HI>Spears,</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="000567_0081_0FA7146888209100"/>
were not a Guard unto them. Our <HI>Shops</HI> would be soon Emptied by those that would Measure our Wares by the <HI>Loag Ell,</HI> that is, the <HI>Pike,</HI> if <HI>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> kept them nor. It is by <HI>Your</HI> means, <HI>Gods Houses</HI> among us, have His Ordinance Undisturbed in them; and that our <HI>Own Houses,</HI> are full of things that are as well Necessary, as Convenient for us; And of this we are the more feelingly Convinced, because we saw a vi∣sible Antipathy to the <HI>Military Spirit</HI> of <HI>New∣England,</HI> in those that lately propounded unto themselves the Nipping and Creepling of those Plantations. We do therefore Confess, that for us to <HI>Discourage</HI> you, is to bespeak <HI>Losses</HI> and <HI>Ruines</HI> for our selves; and we Confess that when you have been in any particular Services Ex∣posed for us, it is not only an Abominable thing for us to Cheat you of your <HI>Wages,</HI> but also a Dishonourable things if we do not bestow some Signal marks of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Care</HI> upon your Fami∣lies; We hope, we wish, that Professing <HI>New∣Englanders</HI> will at last Exceed Pagan <HI>Ath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nians</HI> in such a Gratitude unto the Well-deserving <HI>Soul∣diers</HI> of the Country.</Q></P>
<P>But the Thanks that should be given to all that have the <HI>Spirit of Souldiery</HI> among us, are particularly belonging to that <HI>Worshipful company,</HI> which by asking a Sermon this Day, have declared the <HI>God</HI> of Heaven to be their <HI>Commander in Chief.</HI> We Thank you, our most worthy Friends for this your <HI>Zeal</HI> of being made Capable of <HI>Fight,</HI> yea, and to <HI>Dy</HI> for your Distressed Neighbours.
