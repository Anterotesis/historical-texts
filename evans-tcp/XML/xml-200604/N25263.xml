<L>He hugs his chains and is in love with bondage:</L>

To Chastel beloved by her above all things, next to her country and her God, Joan of Arc bids a last farewell. The English have condemn'd me to be burnt, horrible death, cruel and sanguinary enemies—Weep not for me my friend, my death will be a lasting reproach to my ene∣mies, and will cover me with glory. I have serv'd France and the Dauphin with the truest and holiest zeal.—The in∣differ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> of the latter to my situation, proves only, what the expe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ce of all ages had before confirmed, that there is neither faith, justice, or gratitude in kings—You are howe∣ver conjured by your esteem and love of me, to sacrifice your resentment to the general good—my fate will touch his heart—He will weep for me—I forgive him—unite to chase the English from France—Monarchy for some time longer will be the government of it, but the time will be when every vestige of it will disappear, your country will one day become a mighty Republic, in the glory and immensity of which all former governments will be lost.—A virtuous band of English colonists, whose love of freedom forc'd them to imigrate to a vast unknown land beyond the great waters, shall first throw down the gauntlet to Kings, and overturn the throne of their tyrant—France will follow her example: shall overturn all thrones, and exterminate all tyrants. The nations of the earth will forget their former an∣tipathies: Even England shall stretch out the arm of friend∣ship to France—This letter is the substance of a vision, and I almost pronounce it prophecy. My sufferings will give you courage and resentment—Farewell.</P>
