<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>News with a vengeance, faith— <HI>Sidney</HI> and <HI>Harcourt</HI> have had a tilting bout this morning: and poor Mrs. <HI>Sidney</HI> is in the hor∣rors, through fear, that it may become a serious matter: Not that I think there is the least dan∣ger of that; for tho' <HI>Harcourt</HI> is a brave fellow, <HI>Sidney</HI> will find avenues enough to escape thro'.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Harr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That is very true; but I am anxious to hear how it terminates. Suppose we call on Mrs. <HI>Sidney.</HI> Pray, did you hear who he took with him.</P>

<P><HI>Dupe</HI> and <HI>Debauchee</HI> were his es∣corts. I heard of it by accident; and flew im∣mediately to <HI>condole</HI> with Mrs. <HI>Sidney.</HI> I found her more calm than I expected. She mentioned the ground on which she founded her hopes— From thence I drew the conclusion I mentioned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Harr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And a very rational one: the gentlemen of the law have advantages superior to their neighbours. There is <HI>Argue,</HI> for in∣stance; why there is no speaking a word for him in the house. But I am determined to op∣pose him with all my power.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Impartialist,</HI> good morning; I am fortunate in finding you at home; I wish to consult you upon a damn'd scurrilous Perform∣ance, that I hear is now in the booksellers hands; I would fain suppress it, if possible; I have been to the Printers, and have given them a damn'd warm dose; but for fear it should not take ef∣fect, I wish to solicit your assistance, in tracing the author of this infernal book, and try what can be done with him; for by my maker I swear, some of us must die; I cannot support it Sir; only think of my situation; a family and con∣nections that are dear to me; carry your ideas a little farther, and behold my son reading a book, where his father is branded with the op∣probrious epithet of villain—Horrour is in the thought—'tis more than man can bear—the cord is already stretched to its utmost limits—'twill soon break—and some victim must bleed, to ex∣piate the crime.</P>

<P>I shall ever esteem myself happy in having it in my power to prevent the effusion of human blood; and I think <HI>Sidney</HI>'s family and connections must be so completely miserable, that it would be the utmost stretch of inhumanity to augment it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think so too; and I exhausted all my rhetoric to divert <HI>Harcourt</HI> from the attempt; but it was in vain—for tho he is as worthy a fellow as wears the King of England's livery, his passions are too quick to be controuled by reason at all times; and in this case you may suppose he felt himself keenly injured.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly; but admitting the whole catalogue of crimes alledged to <HI>Sidney</HI> to be true, <HI>Harcourt,</HI> nor the family, in my opinion, can∣not inflict a worse punishment on the wretched <HI>Sidney</HI> than his own reflections.</P>
</SP>

<P>Well Sir, I have an appointment, and must take my leave. I know an apology is necessary for the motive of this visit—but your candor will speak one for me, or fame is not just in the encomiums she pays you.</P>

<P>Have you waited for me, my dear.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Turn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Waited, yes; I have waited till I am faint for my breakfast; but it is nothing new, you always serve me so, when I am impa∣tient to get things cleared away, that I may see after my family; for somebody must see to it, or we shall have nothing to eat; but that is the least of your concern; if you are fed no matter who finds it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Turn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why what a touse you make about nothing; I only stept in to neighbour <HI>Whitmore</HI>'s to hear if he brought any news from town last night; and I am glad I went, notwithstanding the clamor you make about it; and I am a good mind not tell you, since you have made such a fuss, tho I know you would give your ears to hear it, because it relates to your friend <HI>Sidney.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Turn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He my friend; yes, my friend∣ship for him is so great, that I don't care how soon he is hang'd, to keep him out of mischief. I am sure my family have lost thousands by his chicanery. But what do they say of him; they can't say any good of him, for if he ever did any thing that was praise-worthy, it was so long since, that he has forgot it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Turn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, they say <HI>Harcourt</HI> has called him to an account for some of the most notorious parts of his conduct.</P>

<SPEAKER>Turn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so quick, my dear, <HI>Sidney</HI> was too artful for him; he planned matters so well, that <HI>Worthy</HI> interposed his authority and parted them. I am glad I was not in the way. I should like to know which party gains the most applause; and to tell you the truth, I am sorry I assisted him in <HI>any</HI> of his manoeuvres.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Turn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If you had taken my advice, you would have saved yourself a great deal of trou∣ble that you have had on his account; there was the jaunt you took of five and twenty miles, in a snow storm, set out at midnight too, to bring a poor infant, new-born from its mother—Hea∣vens defend us from such fathers—monsters in human shape; but it seems gratitude was your motive; he had screened you from the punishment which some of your libidinous conduct richly merited, and you undertook to return the obli∣gation in the same style.</P>
</SP>

<P>Heavens! what a blast! I'll hear no more of it this time, however.

<P>Yes, he has been in, and I

find the affair has ended better than I expected; but now he is in a violent passion about a Novel, that <HI>Steady</HI> and <HI>Firm</HI> have printed, and he is said to be the principal character in the Drama—he says he will suppress the publication if possible; for my own part, I am less solicitous about that, than I was about the duel: To have had my bro∣ther, or my husband fallen by the sword of the other would have been insupportable.</P>
