<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the following pages, the Public, according to the promise of the Publishers, is presented with a Volume of American Poems; partly Selected, and partly Original. In undertaking this Work, they have been actuated by a variety of motives, and drawn onward by a number of ob∣jects. When looking round them, they saw many Poems, written by the most eminent American Authors, from the loose manner of their publishment, known only to a few of their particular acquaintance, and unheard of by the gene∣rality of their Countrymen. The value of the perform∣ances, and the regard which authors generally feel for their literary offspring, left them no room to doubt, but that, at some future period, each person would think it not un∣worth the while to collect what he had scattered. But this period was uncertain; and the publishers tho't that it would not be rendering an unacceptable service to the Pub∣lic, if they undertook the business of collecting, and arran∣ging each Author's productions in a volume, which from its size should claim a more universal attention.—Beside the smaller Poems of Gentlemen, distinguish'd for their poet∣ical talents, many others, of very great merit, have ap∣peared in the different Periodical publications of the United States. Performances of this kind, falling from the pens of persons not intent on literary fame; or intent on repu∣tation different from poetical reputation; or whose names have not yet been dignified by national applause; especial∣ly
<PB N="iv" REF="025104_0003_0FCE54276A1F91C0"/>
as many of them are adapted to particular and local oc∣casions; notwithstanding their desert, are constantly lia∣ble to be forgotten and lost. And the publishers have ob∣served it to be a matter of much regret, among persons of reading and taste, that the frail security of an obscure news∣paper, was the only one they had for some of the hansom∣est specimens of American Poetry. To afford a stronger, and more durable security, is one of the objects of this Publication.—Among other things, it did not appear to be a matter altogether destitute of usefulness, to bring togeth∣er, in one view, the several poetical productions of the dif∣ferent States. By this means a more certain estimation can be made of the comparative merit of their various wri∣ters; a more thorough acquaintance may be obtained of the state of the belles-lettres in the individual parts of the Uni∣on; and hereby will be promoted a more intimate combi∣nation of literary interests.—It especially seemed a matter of importance, to draw forth, for the amusement of the lovers of poetry, those Poems which, for want of a Repos∣itory of this kind, alone, were withheld from the Public. It was easy to foresee, that many persons, acting with a proper regard to the worth of their own writings, would readily give up that advantage, which news-papers bestow, of having them known to every body; if they could by means of a Work like the present one, secure them a certain conveyance to the attention of the scientific and refined. It was l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kewise the wish of the Publishers, to excite the attention of thos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> possessed of talents and leisure, to simi∣lar pursuits; by holding out to them a Work where, uni∣ted with the like performances of the most celebrated among their Countrymen, their Poems may be equally se∣cure
<PB N="v" REF="025104_0004_0FCE54294EC9B4A0"/>
of preservation and notice.—These have been the in∣tentions of the Publishers. How far their design is accom∣plished, is not for them to determine. That it should be completely so, was not to be expected. This is but the be∣ginning of an Undertaking; and they hope, not an un∣promising one. The Public alone, have the power to coun∣tenance and support them in its accomplishment.—Should the Volume, now published, meet with that success which the value of the Poems it contains seems to warrant, it is the intention of the Publishers to add another; and to con∣tinue the Collection as long as the <HI>present supply</HI> of Mate∣rials, and <HI>that</HI> for which, in future, they may be indebt∣ed to the generosity of the literarty, will enable them.</P>
<P>They have, now, only to return, to their subscribers, their most unfeignedly grateful acknowledgments for the generous support which they have afforded them; and to express a hope, that tho' the publication owing to some unfortunate circumstances, has been delayed longer than their first purpose, no other expectation, which they have held forth, may be disappointed on a careful examination of the Work.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the intention of the Editors, as mentioned in the Preface, to pursue their design; and, should sufficient encouragement appear, to publish a Se∣cond Volume, in the course of the next two years. —Many disappointments, the ill health of one of the Editors, and other circumstances, too complicated and painful to mention, have contributed to render their part of this Work less perfect than their ex∣pectations, and promises. They intend to finish the succeeding Volume, or Volumes, in a more el∣egant manner; and, if a second edition of the pre∣sent volume should be called for, it is their further intention to make it equal, in beauty, to the oth∣ers; to all of which suitable, and well-executed de∣corations shall be added.</P>

<L>OH BOSTON! late with ev'ry pleasure crown'd,</L>
<L>Where Commerce triumph'd on the favoring gales,</L>
<L>And each pleas'd eye, that rov'd in prospect round,</L>
<L>Hail'd thy bright spires and bless'd thy op'ning sails!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy plenteous marts with rich profusion smil'd;</L>
<L>The gay throng crouded in thy spacious streets;</L>
<L>From either IND thy chearful stores were fill'd;</L>
<L>Thy ports were gladden'd with unnumber'd fleets.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For there more fair than in their native vales,</L>
<L>Tall groves of masts arose in beauteous pride;</L>
<L>The waves were whiten'd by the swelling sails,</L>
<L>And plenty wafted on the neighb'ring tide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas, how chang'd! the swelling sails no more</L>
<L>Catch the fair winds and wanton in the sky;</L>
<L>But hostile beaks affright the guarded shore,</L>
<L>And pointed thunders all access deny.</L>

<L>Where the bold Cape its warning forehead rears,</L>
<L>Where tyrant Vengeance waved her magic wand,</L>
<L>Far from the sight each friendly vessel veers,</L>
<L>Calls the kind gales and flies the fatal strand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The ruin'd Merchant turns his mournful eyes</L>
<L>From the drear shore and desolated way;</L>
<L>Thy silent marts unusual glooms surprize,</L>
<L>And through thy streets the sons of rapine stray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such the dread stillness of the desert night,</L>
<L>When brooding ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ror settles on the groves;</L>
<L>While powers of darkness claim their ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eful right,</L>
<L>And fierce for prey the savage tyger roves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Along thy fields, which late in beauty shone</L>
<L>With lowing herds and grassy vesture fair,</L>
<L>The insulting tents of barbarous troops are strown,</L>
<L>And bloody standards stain the peaceful air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Are these thy deeds, oh Britain? this the praise,</L>
<L>That points the growing lustre of thy name?</L>
<L>These glorious works that in thy latter days,</L>
<L>Gild the bright period of thine early fame?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shall thy strong fleets, with awful sails<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unfurl'd,</L>
<L>On Freedom's shrines the unhallow'd vengeance bend?</L>
<L>And leave forlorn the desolated world,</L>
<L>Crush'd—every foe, and ruin'd—every friend!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And damp'd alas! thy soul-inspiring ray,</L>
<L>Where Virtue prompted and where Genius soar'd,</L>
<L>Or quench'd in darkness, and the gloomy sway</L>
<L>Of Senates venal and the liveried Lord!</L>
</LG>

<PB N="3" REF="025104_0010_0FCE543918952AC8"/>
<L>There shame sits blazon'd on the unmeaning brow,</L>
<L>And o'er the scene thy factious Nobles wait,</L>
<L>Prompt the mixt tumult of the noisy show,</L>
<L>Guide the blind vote and rule the mock debate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To these how vain, in weary woes forlorn,</L>
<L>With fearful hands the fond complaint to raise,</L>
<L>Lift fruitless offerings to the ear of Scorn—</L>
<L>Of servile vows and well-dissembled praise!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Will the grim savage of the nightly fold</L>
<L>Learn from their cries the blameless flock to spare?</L>
<L>Will the deaf gods, that frown in molten gold,</L>
<L>Bless the dup'd hand, that spreads the prostrate prayer?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With what pleas'd hope before the face of Pride,</L>
<L>We rear'd our suppliant eyes with filial awe;</L>
<L>While loud Disdain with ruffian voice reply'd,</L>
<L>And Injury triumph'd in the garb of Law!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While Peers enraptur'd hail the unmanly wrong,</L>
<L>See Ribaldry, vile prostitute of shame,</L>
<L>Stretch the brib'd hand and prompt the venal tongue,</L>
<L>To blast the laurels of a FRANKLIN's fame!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But will the Sage, whose philosophic soul,</L>
<L>Controul'd the lightning in its fierce career,</L>
<L>Hear'd unappal'd the aerial thunders roll,</L>
<L>And taught the bolts of vengeance where to steer;—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Will he, while echoing to his just renown</L>
<L>The voice of kingdoms swells the loud applause;</L>
<L>Heed the weak malice of a Courtier's frown,</L>

<L>THE world now yeilds to night's returning sway;</L>
<L>The deeper glooms lead on the solemn hour,</L>

<L>To roam in SADNESS on the sea-beat shore.</L>

<L>As thro these mournful glooms I stretch'd my sight,</L>

<HEAD>THE TRIAL OF FAITH.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THIS Poem is reprinted from the New-Haven Ga∣zette, and the Connecticut Magazine, published by Meigs and Dana, for the year 1736;—where it forms three Num∣bers of a Periodical Paper, undertaken by Dr. Dwight— and is introduced by the following Preface, viz.—
<Q>The inclosed Poem is handed you for publication. I have long thought that the Bible furnished many subjects for poetry, far more deserving the ambition and efforts of genius, than those to which it is commonly dedicated. I do not mean merely that they are subjects more friendly to virtue, but to poetry. They are more sublime, novel, beautiful, agreeable, and in every way interesting.— Perhaps this experiment may not have been so happily made, as to elucidate the truth of this opinion. But as it is, it is submitted to the judgment of your readers. Should it have the happy influence to induce even one person of poetical talents, to apply those talents to this method of ornamenting his own character, and that of his country, I shall think my labours not unhappily di∣rected.</Q></NOTE></HEAD>

<L>There mov'd the prince, the queen, the lord, the sage,</L>
<L>And hapless captive throngs of every age.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>High-thron'd, the monarch from his golden car,</L>
<L>Survey'd the trophies of successful war.</L>
<L>Majestic, tall, the mighty hero rose,</L>
<L>Born to command, and dreadful to his foes:</L>
<L>His lofty limbs, enrob'd in rich attire</L>
<L>Of steel, and gold, were circled round with fire:</L>
<L>His pride, his soul, expanded at the sight,</L>
<L>And his glad eye-balls warm'd with living light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As o'er the captive train he cast his eyes,</L>
<L>And heard, unmov'd, their mingled groans and cries,</L>
<L>Four youths, companions, silent pass'd along,</L>
<L>By form distinguish'd from the vulgar throng.</L>
<L>Fair o'er them trembled beauty's purple flame;</L>
<L>Their eyes, as angels', cast a sunny beam;</L>
<L>Sublime their port; serene their solemn lock;</L>
<L>By sear unaw'd, by heaviest woes unbroke;</L>
<L>To ills superior; earth and time above;</L>
<L>But touch'd with kindred woe, and yearning love.</L>
<L>The monarch gaz'd.—His fierce and hardy mind</L>
<L>Then first with sweet and tender thoughts refin'd;</L>
<L><PB N="35" REF="025104_0042_0FCE547D56A20D58"/>He felt each nerve with strange emotion thrill,</L>
<L>And down each cheek new tears in silence steal.</L>
<L>No more the host, no more the spoils appear'd;</L>
<L>No more the trump's inspiring voice was heard;</L>
<L>Fix'd as he gaz'd, to soft compassion won,</L>
<L>The pomp was buried, and the triumph gone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To ARIOCH then, his favor'd, faithful slave,</L>
<L>The turning prince his sovereign pleasure gave:</L>
<L>"Seest thou, my ARIOCH, those bright, youthful forms;</L>
<L>"What grace surrounds them, and what beauty warms!</L>
<L>"With what fair pride, magnificently great,</L>
<L>"They move superior to their humble fate!</L>
<L>"For arms, for empire, not for bondage made,</L>
<L>"They win my soul, and claim imperial aid.</L>
<L>"Go then, my ARIOCH, go, their steps pursue;</L>
<L>"With gentle sympathy their souls subdue;</L>
<L>"Their monarch's favour to their hearts ensure;</L>
<L>"Win them from grief; disrobe their rags impure;</L>
<L>"Their course immediate to the palace bend;</L>
<L>"Let faithful ASHPENAZ their steps attend;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The monarch spake. The faithful chief obey'd,</L>
<L>And to the palace strait the youths convey'd.</L>
<L>There ASHPENAZ, the eunuch's prince, receiv'd,</L>
<L>To hope restor'd them, and from want reliev'd.</L>
<L>Cheer'd with kind words, their every wish obey'd,</L>
<L>And thus, with soft and tender accent, said:—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"All-lovely youths! attir'd with every grace,</L>
<L>'The best, and brightest, of your hapless race,</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="025104_0043_0FCE5482248B0E88"/>'Think not, from war's dire scenes, the Assyrian mind,</L>

<L>'Even the great prince, our mighty realm who sways,</L>
<L>'Train'd in fierce wars, and nurs'd in bloody ways,</L>
<L>'Though proudly borne on Conquest's lofty wings,</L>
<L>'Lord of a world, and king of countless kings,</L>
<L>'Yet bade me kindly every want supply,</L>
<L>'No hope extinguish, and no joy deny.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'By his command, on kingly dainties fed,</L>
<L>'Serv'd by his slaves, and in his palace bred,</L>
<L>'In every art, in every mystery train'd,</L>
<L>'By lords approv'd, by royal love sustain'd.</L>
<L>'Your lives, in peace serene, shall glide away,</L>
<L>'New joys returning with returning day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'For me, my bosom, not of stubborn steel,</L>
<L>'Well knows to love, and long has learn'd to feel.</L>
<L>'Your woes, O Youths, your nation's fate severe,</L>
<L>'Pierce my sad soul, and prompt the tender tear.</L>
<L>'Each gentle act, that marks a parent's hand,</L>
<L>'From faithful ASHPENAZ assur'd command;</L>
<L>'From earliest years, to youths a constant guide,</L>
<L>''Tis joy to bless them, and to serve is pride."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus spoke the prince. With meek, but solemn grace,</L>
<L>The elder youth return'd this sad address:</L>
<L>'O Prince of Eunuchs, soothing friend of woe!</L>
<L>'Thy gentle solace bids our sorrows flow:</L>
<L>'With love, with gratitude, our bosoms burn,</L>
<L>'But, pierc'd with grief, our hapless nation mourn.</L>
<L>'For ah! her sons, of every good forlorn,</L>
<L>'Waste with dire want, or shrink from piercing scorn;</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="025104_0044_0FCE54841ABD90D8"/>'Or rage, in slaughter bids them weltering roll;</L>
<L>'Or gloomy slavery blasts the wither'd soul;</L>
<L>'Her childless mothers spread the reeking ground;</L>
<L>'Her babes, unpitied, glut the hungry hound;</L>
<L>'Levell'd in dust, her heaven-built Temple lies,</L>
<L>'And SALEM's smoking ruins fill the skies.</L>
<L>'More dread these splendors shew the fearful doom,</L>
<L>'As day more deeply shades the darksome tomb:</L>
<L>'Then, mid all joys, permit our hearts to mourn,</L>
<L>'Nor think thy goodness meets a base return."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He spoke. The prince, to chambers proud and fair,</L>
<L>Led the sad youths, and sooth'd their rising care,</L>
<L>Their graceful forms in splendid garments dress'd,</L>
<L>And kindly cheer'd their troubled minds to rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As now all-fragrant spread the rich repast,</L>
<L>Cates of all climes, and wines of every taste;</L>
<L>Deep cares revolving in his troubled breast,</L>
<L>His chosen friends the elder youth address'd:—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"O youths, refin'd in fierce affliction's flame,</L>
<L>'Like gold, refulgent with undrossy beam!</L>
<L>'Now new alarms your virtuous minds assail,</L>
<L>'New-dangers tempt, and untried foes prevail.</L>
<L>'As icy rocks, by winter beat in vain▪</L>
<L>'Yeild to mild suns, and melt in vernal rain,</L>
<L>'So the firm heart, no cruelty could move,</L>
<L>'May lose each virtue in the beams of love.</L>
<L>'Those cates, compos'd of all things rich and rare,</L>
<L>'Cull'd with nice art, and dress'd with skilful care,</L>
<L>'From truth's fair path our footsteps softly charm,</L>
<L>'Our prayers enfeeble, and our faith disarm.</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="025104_0045_0FCE548661AD27A0"/>'To purest food the sacred law confin'd,</L>

<L>'From humble pulse serenest peace shall spring,</L>
<L>'Health nerve the limbs, and lift the mental wing;</L>
<L>'The soul, the form, with health and beauty bloom,</L>
<L>'And heaven complacent grant a milder doom."</L>
</LG>

<L>Thus spoke the youth. With smiles of pure delight,</L>
<L>In duty's path the assenting friends unite,</L>
<L>To heaven the feast, the roving wish resign'd,</L>
<L>And gain'd the banquet of the obedient mind.</L>

<HEAD>THE TRIAL OF FAITH. BY THE SAME.</HEAD>
<HEAD>PART II. DANIEL, CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THUS rose the youths, by lords and kings approv'd,</L>
<L>By earth exalted, and by Heaven belov'd,</L>
<L>When, lost in slumbers as the sovereign lay,</L>
<L>What time fair Phosphor sings the approach of day,</L>
<L>Full to his eyes a vision rose sublime,</L>
<L>Big with dread mysteries of ascending time.</L>
<L>Alarm'd, awak'd, he left the thorny bed;</L>
<L>His sleep all vanish'd, and the vision fled:</L>
<L>In vain he tried the wonders to restore,</L>
<L>The fleeted phantom met his eyes no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then deep convulsions shook his stormy mind,</L>
<L>That knew no crosses, and no wish resign'd.</L>
<L>At once he summon'd all the learn'd and wise,</L>
<L>Skill'd to explain, and artful to disguise,</L>
<L>Practis'd to bode, in words of soothing guile,</L>
<L>New feats, new triumphs, and new realms of spoil.</L>
<L>And thus the king—"Let every sage and seer,</L>
<L>Dreamer of dreams, and star-taught prophet hear!</L>
<L>This night, as sunk in sleep, your monarch lay,</L>
<L>When truth's clear dreams attend approaching day,</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="025104_0047_0FCE548B9B6D5CC0"/>Before my eyes a solemn vision rose,</L>

<L>Fill'd with dread scenes, with acts of mighty name,</L>
<L>With change of empires, and with years of fame.</L>
<L>I wak'd—I rose—but all the events of night</L>
<L>Fled from m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> view, and took their final flight.</L>
<L>Then hear ye sages; borne by skill sublime,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Hero spoke. Around the spacious room</L>
<L>The strange command diffus'd a solemn gloom;</L>
<L>When thus a hoary sage—"O king divine,</L>
<L>Be endless life, and power, and honour thine!</L>
<L>Thy high behests our hearts delight to obey;</L>
<L>We own thy glory, and we bless thy sway.</L>

<L>Or on fleet pinions roves the wandering soul,</L>
<L>Can bid the eventful scenes of night return,</L>
<L>Or ope the vanish'd visions of the morn.</L>
<L>A new command, a labour yet undone,</L>
<L>Thy will enjoins us, and thy voice makes known,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The monarch heard. With sudden anger bright,</L>
<L>From his fierce eye-balls flash'd a withering light:</L>
<L>Sternly he cried,—"Base, impious wretches, hear</L>
<L>What wrath betides you, and what fate is near.</L>
<L>If, taught by heaven, your hearts the dream divine,</L>
<L>Wealth waits your steps, and crowns before you shine:</L>
<L>Prophets of truth, your race shall then be seen,</L>
<L>Lov'd by the Gods, and precious gifts to men.</L>
<L>But if this feat your purblind skill denies,</L>
<L>Each wretch, who soils the robe of wisdom, dies.</L>
<L>Mock'd by your boasts, my soul, no longer tame,</L>
<L>Shall rouse to sense, and bid just vengeance flame;</L>
<L>Each pamper'd carcase this right hand shall tear,</L>

<L>And sweep the nuisance from the world away."</L>
</LG>

<L>He spoke: the seers withdrew.—The realm around,</L>
<L>From voice to voice diffus'd the dismal sound.</L>
<L>From ARIOCH, ASHPENAZ the tidings knew!</L>
<L>With thoughts all anxious to the youths he flew,</L>
<L>Rehears'd the tale—and "You, by worth betray'd,</L>
<L>Must soon," he cried, "be number'd with the dead."</L>
<L>"Fear not, O Prince,"—the elder youth reply'd:</L>
<L>"While heaven commands no ills the just betide.</L>
<L>Virtue refines, beneath affliction's power,</L>
<L>As gold runs beauteous from dissolving ore.</L>
<L>To light the dream shall rise, or, if the sky</L>

<LG>
<L>The Prince to ARIOCH flew, and, bath'd in tears,</L>
<L>Rehears'd the tale of mingled hopes, and fears.</L>
<L>He came: And pleas'd to stay the monarch's rage,</L>
<L>Led to the throne the young, unbearded sage.</L>
<L>With mild regard, the softening sovereign view'd,</L>
<L>While worth, and beauty, half his wrath subdued,</L>
<L>Heard him, with modest mien, his hope propose,</L>
<L>That Heaven, ere morn, the vision would disclose,</L>
<L>And bade glad ARIOCH vengeance dire delay,</L>
<L>'Till the wish'd hour should ope the promis'd day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Those hours, the youths consum'd in fasts severe,</L>
<L>And the pure fervence of effectual prayer.</L>
<L>The God of worlds, to whom, with beam divine,</L>
<L>Fairer than morn the sons of Zion shine,</L>
<L>With love all bounteous bade the vision rise,</L>
<L>Dread, full, and clear, to DANIEL's slumbering eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At earliest dawn, the youths, in bright array,</L>
<L>Toward the new palace bent their early way;</L>
<L>Through rows of lords, and rows of kings they pass'd,</L>
<L>While eyes of wonder thousands on them cast;</L>
<L>For round the court had spread the fearful doom,</L>

<L>Its iron feet, commix'd with miry clay,</L>
<L>Display'd unsolid power, to time a prey.</L>
<L>When lo! spontaneous, from the mountains rent,</L>
<L>A stone came thundering down, with swift descent;</L>
<L>Full on the form, with mighty force it burst,</L>

<L><PB N="44" REF="025104_0051_0FCE54940CD18A38"/>Borne by the winds, thou saw'st its ruins fly,</L>

<L>FROM western skies, a cloud of glory came,</L>
<L>A small, dim spot, a torch of lambent flame;</L>

<L>Rainbow'd with fire, and warm'd with glowing gold.</L>
<L>There, borne by summon'd winds, in pomp sublime,</L>

<L>Such dreams you sages may decry;</L>
<L>But Muses know they never lie.</L>
<L>Then hear, from me, in grave narration,</L>
<L>Of these strange facts, the strange occasion.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In Greece Cynethe's village-lay,</L>
<L>Well known to all, who went that way,</L>
<L>For dogs of every kindred famed,</L>
<L>And from true doggish manners named.</L>
<L>One morn, a greyhound pass'd the street;</L>
<L>At once the foul-mouth'd conclave met,</L>
<L>Huddling around the stranger ran,</L>
<L>And thus their smart <HI>review</HI> began.</L>
<L>"What tramper" with a grinning sneer,</L>
<L>Bark'd out the clumsy cur, "is here?</L>
<L>No native of the town, I see;</L>
<L>Some foreign whelp of base degree.</L>
<L>I'd shew, but that the record's torn,</L>
<L>We true Welsh curs are better born.</L>

<L>While ours is much improved by <HI>cropping.</HI>"</L>
</LG>

<L>"Right," cried the blood-hound, "that strait ear</L>
<L>Seems made for nothing, but to hear;</L>
<L>'Tis long agreed, thro' all the town,</L>
<L>That handsome ears, like mine, hang down;</L>
<L>And tho' his body's gaunt, and round,</L>
<L>'Tis no true rawboned gaunt of hound.</L>

<L>"Baugh-waugh!" the shaggy spaniel cried,</L>
<L>"What wretched covering on his hide!</L>
<L>I wonder where he lives in winter;</L>
<L>His strait, sleek legs too, out of joint are;</L>

<L>He never plung'd in pond or river,</L>
<L>To search for wounded duck and diver;</L>

<L>While various fortune fir'd th' embattled field,</L>

<HEAD>A POEM, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Poem is reprinted from the Hartford Edition; to which the following Advertisement was prefixed.—
<Q>It may not be amiss to inform the subscribers for the following performance that a copy was not given at the time it was requested, on account of its containing several passages taken from a larger work which the au∣thor has by him, unfinished. Upon farther considera∣tion however, it is thought not improper to present to the Public a specimen of that work, in this incorrect manner, that a conjecture may be formed what success it may meet, when the whole shall make its appearance. The passages are those that respect the affairs of America at large, and the future progress of Society. As to the other parts of the Poem which are confined to the state of education in Connecticut, although the subject may be thought too particular to be relished beyond the lim∣its of a Commencement Auditory, yet if they should serve to turn the attention of any part of the Public to the real situation of Yale College, it may justify the publication.</Q></NOTE>

<L>ONCE more, thou sacred Seat, the changing year</L>

<L>Thro' seven long years hath war's terrific power</L>

<L>Pursu'd fair Science from each happy seat,</L>

<L>And oft, Yalensia, doom'd thy final fall,</L>

<L>Long have we liv'd beneath thy nurturing care,</L>

<L>To all thy train we bid a long farewel;</L>
<L>One gentle grasp, one silent, sorrowing tear,</L>
<L>And joys and friends forever disappear;</L>
<L>Fate calls us hence the world's broad stage to tread,</L>
<L>Act a short part, and mingle with the dead.</L>
<L>We go—but may thy glory still ascend,</L>
<L>Thy fame, thy virtues thro' the world extend;</L>
<L>Thy future sons, a calm, delightful throng,</L>
<L>As following years shall lead their steps along,</L>
<L>To peace, to happiness, to glory rise,</L>
<L>Shine thro' the earth and brighten in the skies.</L>
<L>No ruffian force that treads the distant shore,</L>
<L>Shall dare invade thy peaceful labors more;</L>
<L>While the proud foes beneath our standards yield,</L>
<L>And our brave brethren claim the crimson field,</L>

<L>Ye patriot worthies, whom these strains assail,</L>
<L>Ye Reverend Sires, and all ye Sons of Yale,</L>

<L>As late, when war's grim terrors sought repose,</L>
<L>And evening mists and distant sires arose,</L>
<L>Far in a gloomy grove I pensive stray'd,</L>
<L>Where death's pale phantoms walk'd the midnight shade,</L>
<L>Thin clouds of sickening damps, o'er ether driven,</L>
<L>Obscur'd the stars and shut the eye from heaven;</L>
<L>Unwonted sighs within my bosom rose,</L>
<L>Cities o'erturn'd and all my country's woes</L>

<L>COME to my soul, O shade of HOSMER, come,</L>
<L>Tho' doubting senates ask thy aid in vain;</L>
<L>Attend the drooping virtues round thy tomb,</L>
<L>And hear a while the orphan'd Muse complain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Muse which thy indulgence bade aspire,</L>
<L>And dare pursue thy distant steps to fame▪</L>
<L>At thy command she first assum'd the lyre,</L>
<L>And hop'd a future laurel from thy name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How did thy smiles awake her infant song!</L>
<L>How did thy virtues animate the lay!</L>
<L>Still shall thy sate the dying strain prolong,</L>
<L>And bear her voice with thy lost form away.</L>

<L>Come to my soul thou venerable Sage,</L>
<L>In all the sheeted majesty of night,</L>
<L>Snatch the bold quill, control the noble rage,</L>
<L>And seize the raptur'd fancy in her flight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come in the form that shadowy spirits dress,</L>
<L>When death's dim veil hath shrouded all their pride,</L>
<L>While yon tall cloud but emulates thy face,</L>
<L>Where the lone moon-beam trembles thro' its side.</L>

<L>Come on the gale that listening midnight heaves,</L>
<L>When glare-ey'd phantoms, bending with a bier,</L>
<L>Stalk thro' the mist, ascend the sounding graves,</L>

<HEAD>EPITAPH On a Patient killed by a Cancer Quack.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DR. LEMUEL HOPKINS.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>HERE lies a fool flat on his back,</L>
<L>The victim of a Cancer Quack;</L>
<L>Who lost his money and his life,</L>
<L>By plaister, caustic, and by knife.</L>
<L>The case was this—a pimple rose,</L>
<L>South-east a little of his nose;</L>
<L>Which daily reden'd and grew bigger,</L>
<L>As too much drinking gave it vigour:</L>
<L>A score of gossips soon ensure</L>
<L>Full three score diff'rent modes of cure:</L>
<L>But yet the full-fed pimple still</L>
<L>Defied all petticoated skill;</L>
<L>When fortune led him to peruse</L>
<L>A hand-bill in the weekly news;</L>
<L>Sign'd by six fools of diff'rent sorts,</L>
<L>All cur'd of cancers made of warts;</L>
<L>Who recommend, with d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e submission,</L>
<L>This cancer-monger as magician;</L>
<L>Fear wing'd his flight to find the quack,</L>
<L>And prove his cancer-curing knack;</L>
<L>But on his way he found another,—</L>
<L>A second advertising brother:</L>
<L><PB N="138" REF="025104_0145_0FCE55678FE88A50"/>But as much like him as an owl</L>
<L>Is unlike every handsome fowl;</L>
<L>Whose fame had rais'd as broad a fog,</L>
<L>And of the two the greater hog:</L>
<L>Who us'd a still more magic plaister,</L>
<L>That sweat forsooth, and cur'd the faster.</L>
<L>This doctor view'd, with moony eyes</L>
<L>And scowl'd up face, the pimple's size;</L>
<L>Then christen'd it in solemn answer,</L>
<L>And cried, "This pimple's name is CANCER."</L>
<L>"But courage, friend, I see you're pale,</L>
<L>"My sweating plaisters never fail;</L>
<L>"I've sweated hundreds out with ease,</L>
<L>"With roots as long as maple trees;</L>
<L>"And never fail'd in all my trials—</L>
<L>"Behold these samples here in vials!</L>
<L>"Preserv'd to shew my wond'rous merits,</L>
<L>"Just as my liver is—in spirits.</L>
<L>"For twenty joes the cure is done—"</L>
<L>The bargain struck, the plaister on,</L>
<L>Which gnaw'd the cancer at its leisure,</L>
<L>And pain'd his face above all measure.</L>
<L>But still the pimple spread the faster,</L>
<L>And swell'd, like toad that meets disaster.</L>
<L>Thus soil'd, the doctor gravely swore,</L>
<L>It was a right rose-cancer sore;</L>
<L>Then stuck his probe beneath the beard,</L>
<L>And shew'd them where the leaves appear'd;</L>
<L>And rais'd the patient's drooping spirits,</L>
<L>By praising up the plaister's merits.—</L>
<L><PB N="139" REF="025104_0146_0FCE556A0C688768"/>Quoth he,' "The roots now scarcely stick—</L>
<L>"I'll fetch her out like crab or tick;</L>
<L>"And make it rendezvous, next trial,</L>
<L>"With six more plagues, in my old vial."</L>
<L>Then purg'd him pale with jalap drastic,</L>
<L>And next applies th' infernal caustic.</L>
<L>But yet, this semblance bright of hell</L>
<L>Serv'd but to make the patient yell;</L>
<L>And, gnawing on with fiery pace,</L>
<L>Devour'd one broadside of his face—</L>
<L>'Courage, 'tis done,' the doctor cried▪</L>
<L>And quick th' incision knife applied:</L>
<L>That with three cuts made such a hole,</L>
<L>Out flew the patient's tortur'd soul!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Go, readers, gentle, eke and simple,</L>
<L>If you have wart, or corn, or pimple;</L>
<L>To quack infallible apply;</L>
<L>Here's room enough for you to lie.</L>
<L>His skill triumphant still prevails,</L>
<L>For DEATH's a cure that never fails.</L>

<HEAD>AN ORATION, Which might have been delivered to the Students in Ana∣tomy, on the late Rupture between the two Schools in this city.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Poem is ascribed to the late Hon. Francis Hopkin∣son, Esq. L. L. D. Federal Judge for the District of Penn∣sylvania, &amp;c. &amp;c.—The occasion of its being written, was this: A Dispute arose between the Medical Students who had attached themselves to two Anatomical Professors, in the city of Philadelphia. This Dispute was carried on for a considerable time, and with great violence. Resolutions of Committees,—Journals of Meetings,—&amp;c. &amp;c. were printed; and the town was threatened with a deluge of un∣interesting publications. In this situation of affairs, Dr. Hopkinson took up the pen; and by the well-tim'd raillery of the following Poem, silenced the contending parties, re∣stored peace to the Schools, and agreeably entertained the Lovers of Poetry and Humour.—This Poem is reprinted from the 4to edition, published by T. Dobson and T. Lang, February 1789.</NOTE></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>ADDRESS—the folly and danger of dissention—the Orator enumerates the enemies of the fraternity—reminds them of a late unseasonable interruption—a night scene in the Potter's Field—he laments the want of true zeal in the brotherhood —and boasts of his own—the force of a ruling passion—the earth considered as a great animal—the pas∣sion of love not the same in a true son of Esculapius as in other men—his own amour—a picture of his mistress in high taste—shews his learning in the description of her mouth, arm and hand—his mistress dies—his grief—and extraordinary consolation—his unparallel'd fidelity—he apologizes for giving this history of his amour—the great difficulties Anatomists have to encounter in the present times, arising from false delicacy, prejudice and ignorance—a strong instance in proof that it was not so formerly—curi∣ous argument to prove the inconsistency of the present opin∣ions respecting the practice—he mentions many obstacles in the road to science—and reproaches them for their intes∣tine broils, at a time when not only popular clamour is loud, but even the powers of government are exerted against them—he then encourages his brethren with hopes of better times, founded on the establishment of the College of Physi∣cians—is inspired with the idea of the future glory of that institution—and prophesies great things.</P>

<L>And by unnumber'd <HI>venus</HI> streams supply'd</L>
<L>Up her broad rivers force the <HI>arterial</HI> tide.</L>
<L>The world's great lungs, monsoons and trade-winds shew</L>
<L>From east to west, from west to east they blow</L>
<L>Alternate respiration—</L>
<L>The hills are pimples which earth's face defile,</L>
<L>And burning <HI>Aetna,</HI> an eruptive boil:</L>
<L>On her high mountains <HI>hairy</HI> forests grow,</L>
<L>And <HI>downy</HI> grass o'erspreads the vales below;</L>
<L>From her vast body perspirations rise,</L>

<L>Was all my thought by night, and daily care;</L>

<PB N="148" REF="025104_0155_0FCE557E918682E0"/>
<L>Long, lank and lean, my CADAVERA stood,</L>
<L>Like the tall pine, the glory of the wood;</L>
<L>Ofttimes I gaz'd, with learned skill to trace</L>
<L>The sharp edg'd beauties of her bony face:</L>
<L>There rose <HI>Os frontis</HI> prominent and bold,</L>
<L>In deep sunk <HI>orbits</HI> two large eye-balls roll'd,</L>
<L>Beneath those eye-balls, two arch'd bones were seen</L>
<L>Whereon two flabby cheeks hung loose and lean;</L>
<L>Between those cheeks, protuberant arose,</L>
<L>In form triangular, her lovely nose,</L>
<L>Like EGYPT's pyramid it seem'd to rise,</L>
<L>Scorn earth, and bid defiance to the skies;</L>
<L>Thin were her lips, and of a sallow hue,</L>
<L>Her open mouth expos'd her teeth to view;</L>
<L>Projecting strong, protuberant and wide</L>
<L>Stood <HI>incisores</HI>—and on either side</L>
<L>The <HI>canine</HI> rang'd, with many a beauteous flaw,</L>
<L>And last the <HI>grinders,</HI> to fill up the jaw;</L>
<L>All in their <HI>alveoli</HI> fix'd secure,</L>
<L>Articulated by <HI>gomphosis</HI> sure.</L>
<L>Around her mouth perpetual smiles had made</L>
<L>Wrinkles wherein the loves and graces play'd;</L>
<L>There, stretch'd and rigid by continual strain,</L>
<L>Appear'd the <HI>zygomatic</HI> muscles plain,</L>
<L>And broad <HI>montanus</HI> o'er her peeked chin</L>
<L>Extended, to support the heavenly grin.</L>
<L>In amorous dalliance oft I stroak'd her arm,</L>
<L>Each rising muscle was a rising charm.</L>
<L>O'er the <HI>flexores</HI> my fond fingers play'd,</L>
<L>I found instruction with delight convey'd;</L>
<L><PB N="149" REF="025104_0156_0FCE558206EA2058"/>There <HI>carpus, cubitus</HI> and <HI>radius</HI> too</L>
<L>Were plainly felt and manifest to view.</L>
<L>No muscles on her lovely hand were seen,</L>
<L>But only bones envelop'd by a skin.</L>
<L>Long were her fingers and her knuckles bare,</L>
<L>Much like the claw-foot of a walnut chair.</L>
<L>So plain was complex <HI>matacarpus</HI> shewn,</L>

<L>At length my CADAVERA fell beneath</L>
<L>The fatal stroke of all subduing death:</L>
<L>Three days in grief—three nights in tears I spent,</L>
<L>And sighs incessant gave my sorrows vent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Few are the examples of a love so true—</L>

<L>Resolv'd her precious corse from worms to save;</L>
<L>With active haste remov'd the incumbent clay,</L>
<L>Seiz'd the rich prize and bore my love away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her naked charms now lay before my sight,</L>
<L>I gaz'd with rapture and supreme delight,</L>
<L>Nor could forbear, in extasy, to cry—</L>
<L>Beneath that shrivell'd skin what treasures lie!</L>
<L>Then feasted to the full my amorous soul,</L>
<L>And skinn'd, and cut, and slash'd without controul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas then I saw, what long I'd wish'd to see,</L>

<L>That flesh is grass, and subject to decay:</L>
<L>Not so the bones; of substance firm and hard,</L>
<L>Long they remain the Anatomist's reward.</L>
<L>Wise nature, in her providential care,</L>

<L>My true love's bones I boil'd—from fat and lean</L>

<HEAD>PHILOSOPHIC SOLITUDE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY WILLIAM LIVINGSTON, ESQ. Late Governor of the State of New-Jersey, &amp;c. &amp;c.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>LET ardent heroes seek renown in arms,</L>
<L>Pant after fame, and rush to war's alarms;</L>
<L>To shining palaces let fools resort,</L>
<L>And dunces cringe, to be esteem'd at court:</L>
<L>Mine be the pleasure of a rural life,</L>
<L>From noise remote, and ignorant of strife;</L>
<L>Far from the painted belle, and white-glov'd beau,</L>
<L>The lawless masquerade, and midnight show:</L>
<L>From ladies, lap-dogs, courtiers, garters, stars,</L>
<L>Fops, fidlers, tyrants, emperors, and czars.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Full in the centre of some shady grove,</L>
<L>By nature form'd for solitude and love;</L>
<L>On banks array'd with ever-blooming flowers,</L>
<L>Near beauteous landscapes, or by roseate bowers,</L>
<L>My neat, but simple mansion I would raise,</L>
<L>Unlike the sumptuous domes of modern days;</L>
<L>Devoid of pomp, with rural plainness form'd,</L>
<L>With savage game, and glossy shells adorn'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No costly furniture should grace my hall;</L>
<L>But curling vines ascend against the wall,</L>
<L>Whose pliant branches should luxuriant twine,</L>
<L>While purple clusters swell'd with future wine:</L>
<L>To sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke my thirst a liquid lapse distil</L>
<L>From craggy rocks, and spread a limpid rill.</L>
<L><PB N="155" REF="025104_0162_0FCE558F5A618658"/>Along my mansion, spiry firs should grow,</L>
<L>And gloomy yews extend the shady row:</L>
<L>The cedars flourish, and the poplars rise,</L>
<L>Sublimely tall, and shoot into the skies:</L>
<L>Among the leaves, refreshing zephyrs play,</L>
<L>And crouding trees exclude the noon-tide ray;</L>
<L>Whereon the birds their downy nests should form,</L>
<L>Securely shelter'd from the battering storm;</L>
<L>And to melodious notes their choir apply,</L>
<L>Soon as Aurora blush'd along the sky:</L>
<L>While all around th' enchanting music rings,</L>
<L>And ev'ry vocal grove responsive sings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Me to sequester'd scenes ye muses guide,</L>
<L>Where nature wantons in her virgin pride;</L>
<L>To mossy banks, edg'd round with op'ning flowers,</L>
<L>Elysian fields and amaranthine bowers,</L>
<L>To ambrosial founts, and sleep-inspiring rills,</L>
<L>To herbag'd vales, gay lawns, and sunny hills.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Welcome, ye shades! all hail, ye vernal blooms!</L>
<L>Ye bow'ry thickets, and prophetic glooms!</L>
<L>Ye forests, hail! ye solitary woods!</L>
<L>Love-whispering groves, and silver-streaming floods:</L>
<L>Ye meads, that aromatic sweets exhale!</L>
<L>Ye birds, and all ye sylvan beauties, hail!</L>
<L>Oh how I long with you to spend my days,</L>
<L>Invoke the muse, and try the rural lays!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No trumpets there with martial clangor sound,</L>
<L>No prostrate heroes strew the crimson ground;</L>
<L>No groves of lances glitter in the air,</L>
<L>Nor thund'ring drums provoke the sanguine war:</L>
<L><PB N="156" REF="025104_0163_0FCE55911F6D9010"/>But white-rob'd Peace, and universal Love</L>
<L>Smile in the field, and brighten ev'ry grove:</L>
<L>There all the beauties of the circling year,</L>
<L>In native ornamental pride appear.</L>
<L>Gay, rosy-bosom'd Spring, and April show'rs,</L>
<L>Wake, from the womb of earth, the rising flow'rs:</L>
<L>In deeper verdure, Summer clothes the plain,</L>
<L>And Autumn bends beneath the golden grain;</L>
<L>The trees weep amber; and the whispering gales</L>
<L>Breeze o'er the lawn, or murmur through the vales:</L>
<L>The flow'ry tribes in gay confusion bloom,</L>
<L>Profuse with sweets, and fragrant with perfume;</L>
<L>On blossoms blossoms, fruits on fruits arise,</L>
<L>And varied prospects glad the wand'ring eyes.</L>
<L>In these fair seats, I'd pass the joyous day,</L>
<L>Where meadows flourish, and where fields look gay;</L>
<L>From bliss to bliss with endless pleasure rove,</L>
<L>Seek crystal streams, or haunt the vernal grove,</L>
<L>Woods, fountains, lakes, the fertile fields, or shades,</L>
<L>Aerial mountains, or subjacent glades.</L>
<L>There from the polish'd fetters of the great,</L>
<L>Triumphal piles, and gilded rooms of state—</L>
<L>Prime ministers, and sycophantic knaves,</L>
<L>Ill se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious villains, and illustrious slaves,</L>
<L>From all the vain formality of fools,</L>
<L>And odious task of arbitrary rules;</L>
<L>The ruffling cares, which the vex'd soul annoy,</L>
<L>The wealth the rich possess, but not enjoy,</L>
<L>The visionary bliss the world can lend,</L>
<L>Th' insidious foe, and false, designing friend,</L>
<L>The seven-fold fury of Xantippe's soul,</L>
<L>And S—'s rage, that burns without controul:</L>
<L><PB N="157" REF="025104_0164_0FCE55921885F828"/>I'd live retir'd, contented, and serene,</L>
<L>Forgot, unknown, unenvied, and unseen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet not a real hermitage I'd choose,</L>
<L>Nor wish to live from all the world recluse;</L>
<L>But with a friend sometimes unbend the soul,</L>
<L>In social converse, o'er the sprightly bowl.</L>
<L>With cheerful W—, serene and wisely gay,</L>
<L>I'd often pass the dancing hours away:</L>
<L>He, skill'd alike to profit and to please,</L>
<L>Politely talks with unaffected ease;</L>
<L>Sage in debate, and faithful to his trust,</L>
<L>Mature in science, and severely just;</L>
<L>Of soul diffusive, vast and unconfin'd,</L>
<L>Breathing benevolence to all mankind;</L>
<L>Cautious to censure, ready to commend,</L>
<L>A firm, unshaken, uncorrupted friend▪</L>
<L>In early youth, fair wisdom's paths he trod,</L>
<L>In early youth, a minister of God,</L>
<L>Each pupil lov'd him, when at Yale he shone,</L>
<L>And ev'ry bleeding bosom weeps him gone.</L>
<L>Dear A— too, should grace my rural seat,</L>
<L>Forever welcome to the green retreat:</L>
<L>Heav'n for the cause of righteousness design'd</L>
<L>His florid genius, and capacious mind:</L>
<L>Oft have I heard, amidst th' adorning throng,</L>
<L>Celestial truths devolving from his tongue:</L>
<L>High o'er the list'ning audience seen him stand,</L>
<L>Divinely speak, and graceful stretch his hand;</L>
<L>With such becoming grace and pompous sound,</L>
<L>With long-rob'd senators encircled round,</L>
<L><PB N="158" REF="025104_0165_0FCE55939A30A6A0"/>Before the Roman bar, while Rome was free,</L>

<L>Next round my board should candid S— appear,</L>
<L>Of manners gentle, and a friend sincere,</L>
<L>Averse to discord, party-rage and strife,</L>
<L>He sails serenely down the stream of life.</L>
<L>With these three friends, beneath a spreading shade,</L>
<L>Where silver fountains murmur thro' the glade;</L>
<L>Or in cool grots, perfum'd with native flow'rs,</L>

<L>Amid sequester'd bow'rs, near gliding streams,</L>

<L>And his bold harp immortal Maro strung:</L>
<L>Where tuneful Orpheus' unresisted lay</L>
<L>Made rapid tigers bear their rage away:</L>

<L>Th' imperial consort of fictitious Jove</L>
<L>For fount-full Ide forsook the realms above.</L>
<L>Oft to Idalia, on a golden cloud,</L>
<L>Veil'd in a mist of fragrance, Venus rode:</L>
<L><PB N="159" REF="025104_0166_0FCE55960028CD50"/>There num'rous altars to the queen were rear'd,</L>

<L>The silver-shafted huntress of the woods,</L>

<L>In palmy Delos by Scamander's side,</L>
<L>Or where Cajister roll'd his silver tide,</L>
<L>Melodious Phoebus sang; the muses round</L>
<L>Alternate warbling to the heavenly sound.</L>
<L>E'en the feign'd monarch of heav'n's bright abode,</L>
<L>High thron'd in gold, of gods the sov'reign god,</L>

<L>To all th' ambrosial feasts, and nectar'd cups above.</L>

<HEAD>POEM, Written in Boston, at the commencement of the late Revolution.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY JAMES ALLEN, OF BOSTON.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>FROM realms of bondage and a tyrant's reign,</L>
<L>Our godlike fathers bore no slavish chain;</L>
<L>To Pharaoh's face the inspired patriarchs stood,</L>
<L>To seal their virtue, with a martyr's blood:</L>
<L>But lives so precious, such a sacred seed,</L>
<L>The source of empires, heaven's high will decreed:</L>
<L>He snatch'd the saints from Pharaoh's impious hand;</L>
<L>And bade his chosen seek this distant land:</L>
<L>Then to these climes the illustrious exiles sped,</L>
<L>'Twas freedom prompted, and the Godhead led.</L>
<L>Eternal woods the virgin soil defac'd,</L>
<L>A dreary desert, and an howling waste;</L>
<L>A haunt of tribes no pity taught to spare,</L>
<L>And they oppos'd them with remorseless war,</L>
<L>But heaven's right arm led forth the faithful trait.</L>
<L>The guardian Godhead swept the insidious plain,</L>
<L>Till the scour'd thicket amicable stood,</L>
<L>Nor dastard ambush trench'd the dusky wood:</L>
<L>Our sires then earn'd, no more, precarious bread,</L>
<L>Nor midst alarms their frugal meals were spread;</L>
<L>Fair boding hopes inur'd their hands to toil,</L>
<L>And patriot virtue nurs'd the thriving soil;</L>
<L><PB N="194" REF="025104_0201_0FCE3713E6223500"/>Nor scarce two ages have their periods run,</L>
<L>Since o'er their culture smil'd the genial sun;</L>
<L>And now what states extend their fair domains</L>
<L>O'er fleecy mountains and luxuriant plains!</L>
<L>Where happy millions their own fields possess,</L>
<L>No tyrant awes them, and no lords oppress;</L>
<L>The hand of rule, divine discretion guides,</L>
<L>And white-robed virtue o'er her paths presides,</L>
<L>Each polic'd order venerates the laws,</L>
<L>And each, ingenuous, speaks in freedom's cause;</L>
<L>The Spartan spirit, nor the Roman name,</L>
<L>The patriot's pride, shall rival these in fame;</L>
<L>Here all the sweets that social life can know,</L>
<L>From the full font of civil sapience flow;</L>
<L>Here golden Ceres clothes the autumnal plain,</L>
<L>And art's fair empress holds her new domain;</L>
<L>Here angel science spreads her lucid wing,</L>
<L>And hark, how sweet the new-born Muses sing!</L>
<L>Here generous commerce spreads her liberal hand,</L>
<L>And scatters foreign blessings round the land.</L>
<L>Shall meagre Mammon, or proud lust of sway,</L>
<L>Reverse these scenes? Will heaven permit the day?</L>
<L>Shall in this era all our hopes expire,</L>
<L>And weeping freedom from her fanes retire?</L>
<L>Here, shall the tyrant still our peace pursue,</L>
<L>From the pain'd eye-brow drink the vital dew?</L>
<L>Nor nature's barrier wards, our fathers' foe,</L>
<L>Seas roll in vain, and boundless oceans flow?</L>

<L>But generous valor scorns a boasting word,</L>

<L>Tho' guilty blushes kindle o'er thy cheek:</L>
<L>If wasting wars and painful toils at length,</L>
<L>Had drain'd our veins, and wither'd all our strength,</L>

<L>'Hear her scream upon the shore.'—</L>
<L>Down the savage Captain struck her,</L>
<L>Lifeless on the vessel's floor.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Up his sails he quickly hoisted,</L>
<L>To the ocean bent his way;</L>
<L>Headlong plunged the raving mother,</L>
<L>From a high rock, in the sea.</L>

<L>Let statesmen court the bubble of applause,</L>

<L>All human reason is no more than this,</L>

<L>Search then your genius, every bent survey,</L>

<L>See thro' this crowd where brilliant prospects rise</L>
<L>The chace how luring, and how rare the prize!</L>
<L>The paths of pleasure to no bounds confin'd,</L>
<L>As in their shape, are various in their kind.</L>

<HEAD>ELLA. A NORWEGIAN TALE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY WILLIAM DUNLAP.</BYLINE>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>History says that SIVARD, King of Sweden, entered Norway with a numerous army, and committed the greatest en∣ormities, but was at last overthrown, his Army routed, and himself slain by one of those women whom he had brutally abused.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>BETWEEN Norwegian hills, wide spreads a plain,</L>
<L>By Nature form'd for sport;</L>
<L>The vet'ran warrior here, and hardy swain,</L>
<L>To annual games resort.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="227" REF="025104_0234_0FCE561A9700B3D0"/>
<L>High o'er their heads was hung the hoary brow,</L>
<L>Which cast an ample shade;</L>
<L>From thence these words majestic seem'd to flow—</L>
<L>"Fierce foes your sports invade!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They upward gaze—a warrior struck their sight;</L>
<L>He bore aloft his lance,</L>
<L>All sheath'd in arms, insufferably bright,</L>
<L>Where beamy splendours dance.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The western sun beam round his helmet flies,</L>
<L>He more than man appears;</L>
<L>And more than mortal seem'd to sound the voice</L>
<L>That rang upon their ears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Ye sons of Norway! hearken to my tale,</L>
<L>"Your rural games oh cease;</L>
<L>"Sivard is marching through Dulvellon's vale,</L>
<L>"Break off the sports of peace!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"The bloody Sivard leads his conqu'ring Swedes,</L>
<L>"He riots in our shame;</L>
<L>"The man, the matron, and the infant bleeds—</L>
<L>"Norway is but a name!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"The husband sees—curse on the tyrant's lust—</L>
<L>"He sees his beauteous bride—</L>
<L>"Her virtue, worth and honour in the dust—</L>
<L>"Oh where is Norway's pride!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Rouse! rouse Norwegians! seize your arms amain,</L>
<L>"Let helms o'ershade the brow;</L>
<L>"Let's meet these Swedish demons on the plain,</L>
<L>"And lay their triumphs low.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="228" REF="025104_0235_0FCE561CC4E69F98"/>
<L>"Oh had you seen what these poor eyes have seen!</L>
<L>'Twas Sivard did the deed—</L>
<L>"Our hoary monarch, and our helpless queen,</L>
<L>"I—yes, I saw them bleed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Their daughter Ella—no, I will not tell!</L>
<L>"Norwegians ne'er enquire—</L>
<L>"Ne'er hear it—what the royal maid besel;</L>
<L>"I see your souls on fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Oh seize your swords, your spears, your helms and shields!</L>
<L>"Oh vindicate your fame!</L>
<L>"Sivard and Sweden glare on Norway's fields;</L>
<L>"Remember Norway's name."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He said, tears flow apace—fierce glow the swains,</L>
<L>Rage fills each honest breast;</L>
<L>In Swedish blood, to wipe away their stains</L>
<L>Was ev'ry thought address'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then red hair'd Rollo, fierce advancing cried</L>
<L>"Whoe'er thou art, come down!</L>
<L>"We live on hills, to ev'ry toil we're tried,</L>
<L>"And war is all our own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Let Sivard come, we'll meet the tyrant here.</L>
<L>"But Stranger come thou down."</L>
<L>He came; old Athold gaz'd with look severe;—</L>
<L>He gaz'd—but ceas'd to frown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Or Athold has forgot his monarch's face,</L>
<L>"Or sure thou art his son!</L>
<L>"Eric, of mighty Norway's royal race!"—</L>
<L>Full quick the tidings run.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="229" REF="025104_0236_0FCE561D92192DC0"/>
<L>With shouts they press to see the beauteous chief;</L>
<L>The aged kiss his hand!</L>
<L>On either side fast roll'd the marks of grief,</L>
<L>Then Athold spoke the band—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Ye sons of Norway, to your homes repair,</L>
<L>"There seize the sword and shield,</L>
<L>"And ere the morning's purple streaks the air,</L>
<L>"Meet Eric in the field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Oh Prince! do you with aged Athold go,</L>
<L>"And take refreshing sleep;</L>
<L>"Athold will sing, and sooth the rising woe,</L>
<L>"Or,—break his harp and weep."—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas night—in Athold's hall each took his place;</L>
<L>Of other times he sung;</L>
<L>Fast stream'd the tears adown the hero's face</L>
<L>And groans responsive rung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bright came the morn! and bright in batter'd arms</L>
<L>The rustic vet'rans came;</L>
<L>And many a youth, untried in rough alarms,</L>
<L>Now hop'd a patriot's name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They hear'd from far the hum of Sivard's host;</L>
<L>Young Eric struck his shield;</L>
<L>Then high in air his heavy spear he tost,</L>
<L>And blaz'd along the field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next aged Athold follow'd; Rollo strong;</L>
<L>Black Calmar lifts his mace;</L>
<L>Culullin, Marco, Streno, rush along,</L>
<L>And all the rugged race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="230" REF="025104_0237_0FCE561F142C8918"/>
<L>Fierce came the Swede, in strength of numbers proud,</L>
<L>She scorn'd his feeble foe;</L>
<L>But soon the voice of battle roar'd aloud,</L>
<L>And many a Swede lay low.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Strong Rollo struck the towering Olaus dead,</L>
<L>Full fifteen bled beside.</L>
<L>Old Athold cleft the brave Adolphus' head,</L>
<L>In all his youthful pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Eric! Eric! rang'd the field around,</L>
<L>On Sivard still he cried:</L>
<L>The gasping Swedes lay heap'd upon the ground—</L>
<L>Sivard! the hills reply'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In fury Sivard seiz'd his shining shield,</L>
<L>His mail, his helm and spear;</L>
<L>He mounts his car, he thunders o'er the field;</L>
<L>And Norway knows to fear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great Rollo falls beneath his dreadful arm,</L>
<L>His ste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds are stain'd with blood;</L>
<L>Young Eric smil'd to hear the loud alarm,</L>
<L>And flew to stop the flood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He rag'd, he foam'd,—fierce flew the thirsty spear,</L>
<L>Down fell the foremost steed:</L>
<L>Astonish'd Sivard felt unusual fear—</L>
<L>"Tyrant, thou'rt doom'd to bleed!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Up sprung the youth—deep griding fell the sword</L>
<L>Sunk in the Tyrant's brow;</L>
<L>Fast fly the Swedes, and leave their hated lord,</L>
<L>His tow'ring pride laid low.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="231" REF="025104_0238_0FCE5621D9768248"/>
<L>Now Norway's sons their great deliverer hail,</L>
<L>But lo! he bleeds! he falls!</L>
<L>Old Athold strips the helm and beamy mail,</L>
<L>And on his Gods he calls.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He lifts the helm, and down the snowy neck</L>
<L>Fast falls the silky hair—</L>
<L>"And could those limbs, the conquering Sivard check</L>
<L>Oh Pow'r of great despair!—"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Life ebbs apace—she lifts her languid head,</L>
<L>She strives her hand to wave,</L>

<L>Hail, mighty Rum! and by this general name</L>
<L>I call each species—whisky, gin, or brandy:</L>
<L>(The kinds are various—but the effects the same;</L>
<L>And so I choose a name that's short and handy;</L>
<L>For, reader, know, it takes a deal of time,</L>
<L>To make a crooked word lie smooth in rhyme.)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, mighty Rum! thy song-inspiring merit</L>
<L>Is known to many a bard in these our days:</L>
<L>Apollo's drink, they find, is void of spirit—</L>
<L>Mere chicken-broth—insipid as their lays:</L>
<L>And, pleas'd, they'd give a riv'let—aye a sea</L>
<L>Of tuneful water, for one quart of thee!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, mighty Rum! how wond'rous is thy pow'r!</L>
<L>Unwarm'd by thee, how would our spirits fail,</L>
<L>When dark December comes, with aspect four,</L>
<L>And, sharp as razor, blows the northern gale!</L>
<L>And yet thour't grateful in that sultry day,</L>
<L>When raging Sirius darts his fervid ray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, mighty Rum! to thee the wretched fly:</L>
<L>And find a sweet oblivion of their woes;</L>
<L>Lock'd in thy arms, as in the grave, they lie—</L>
<L>Forget their kindred—and forgive their foes.</L>
<L>And Lethe's stream, (so much extoll'd by some,</L>
<L>In ancient times) I shrewdly guess, was Rum.</L>
</LG>

<L>Hail, mighty Rum! what can thy pow'r withstand!</L>
<L>E'en lordly Reason flies thy dreadful face:</L>
<L>And Health, and Joy, and all the lovely band</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>But fear not, Rum, tho' fiercely they assail,</L>
<L>And none but I, the bard, thy cause defend,</L>
<L>Think not thy foes—tho' num'rous—shall prevail,</L>

<L>And oft, when Sol's proud chariot quits the sky,</L>
<L>And humbler Cynthia mounts her one-horse chair,</L>
<L>To that snug closet shall thy vot'ry fly;</L>
<L>And, rapt in darkness, keep his orgies there;</L>
<L>Lift the full bottle, joyous, to his head,</L>
<L>Then, great as Caesar, reel sublime to bed.</L>

<L>OF war's tremendous deeds, the din of arms,</L>

<L>When Colin lifts the sack of mighty weight;</L>
<L>Such wit as sports in gambols o'er the green,</L>
<L>And would the ear of nicer townsman grate:</L>

<L>Silence with Sleep his empire now divides,</L>

<L>The ploughman still his steers and ploughshare guides,</L>

<LG>
<L>HAPPY the man who, safe on shore,</L>
<L>Now trims, at home, his evening fire;</L>
<L>Unmov'd he hears the tempest roar,</L>
<L>That on the tufted groves expire;</L>
<L>Alas! on us they doubly fall,</L>
<L>Our feeble bark must bear them all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now to their haunts the birds retreat,</L>
<L>The squirrel seeks his hollow tree,</L>
<L>Wolves in their shaded caverns meet,</L>
<L>All, all are blest but wretched we—</L>
<L>For, doom'd a stranger to repose,</L>
<L>No rest the unsettled ocean knows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whilst o'er the dark abyss we roam,</L>
<L>Perhaps whate'er the pilots say,</L>
<L>We saw the sun's descending gloom,</L>
<L>No more to see the rising ray;</L>
<L>But buried low, by far too deep,</L>
<L>On coral beds unpitied sleep!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But what a strange uncoasted strand</L>
<L>Is that where death permits no day,</L>
<L>No charts we have to mark that land,</L>
<L>No compass to direct the way!</L>
<L>What pilot shall explore that realm,</L>
<L>What new Columbus take the helm!</L>

<L>Of friendship's voice I hear no sound,</L>
<L>No comfort in this dreadful hour—</L>

<L>What comforts on this angry sea!</L>
</LG>

<L>The barque accustom'd to obey,</L>
<L>No more the trembling pilots guide,</L>
<L>Alone she gropes her trackless way,</L>

<L>Thus all the blest their happy days employ,</L>

<L>Their grateful incense rises up to heaven,</L>

<L>THE <HI>Lord of light</HI> has journey'd down the sky,</L>
<L>And bath'd his coursers in the foaming wave;</L>

<L>Her silver form, and vanish from my eye.</L>

<L>Direct thy wandering steps, and on this stone,</L>
<L>Worn by no traveller's feet, with moss o'ergrown,</L>

<L>DARK is the hour and lone, o'er icy plains</L>
<L>The wandering meteors gleam a deadly light;</L>
<L>Wild howls the blast amid descending rains,</L>
<L>And forms funereal flit along the night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Retir'd from scenes where Pleasure's airy wand</L>
<L>Gilds the light moments with delusive joy,</L>
<L>Where Mirth ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lting leads h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r festive band,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The clouds of death that gloom the baleful year,</L>
<L>The days of joy, alas, so lately fled!</L>
<L>While Friendship bids its sympathetic tear</L>
<L>Stream in remembrance of the much-lov'd dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My friend, but now, of every bliss possest</L>
<L>That love connubial can on man bestow,</L>
<L>When mutual wishes warm the mutual breast;</L>
<L>Behold the prey of life consuming woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of late, how fair the beauteous prospect show'd,</L>
<L>How lovely glittering in the morning's eye;</L>
<L>But long ere noon, like April's painted cloud,</L>
<L>Or hues that tinge the summer's evening sky,</L>

<L>The fairy hopes that raptur'd Fancy drew,</L>
<L>The dream of future bliss that shone so bright,</L>
<L>On Fate's swift pinions vanish'd from the view,</L>
<L>And sunk in shadows of eternal night.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What notes of woe in mournful cadence swell</L>
<L>Along the Western breeze from climes afar,</L>
<L>Mix'd with the dying groan, the savage yell,</L>
<L>And all the horrid dissonance of war!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And lo! mid gliding spectres dimly seen,</L>
<L>Pale as the mists that Autumn's car surround,</L>
<L>A form superior lifts his pensive mien,</L>
<L>While on his bosom glares the shadowy wound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Behold," he cries, "the band who lately bled,</L>
<L>"Mid western wilds in glorious conflict slain;</L>
<L>"While recreant troops in pale confusion fled,</L>
<L>"Ignobly left unburied on the plain."—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far opes the view, sublime in savage pride</L>
<L>A wild unbounded frowns on Fancy's eye;</L>
<L>Tall rise the trees, and o'er savannahs wide</L>
<L>The rank grass trembles to the breeze on nigh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With torrent sweep, amid a night of woods</L>
<L>Where scarce the sun a livid glimmering lends,</L>
<L>A blood-stain'd river rolls his foaming floods,</L>
<L>And o'er the plains in wild meanders bends.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lo! this the scene where War, with bloody hand,</L>
<L>Wav'd his red standard o'er the carnag'd ground;</L>
<L>Where wild-eyed Horror led the tawny band,</L>
<L>And fell the brave with dear-bought laurels crown'</L>

<L>Here, grim with gore, beneath the inclement sky,</L>
<L>Smote by the parching ray and driving rain,</L>
<L>The mangled forms of breathless warriors lie,</L>
<L>All pale extended on the lonely plain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In slaughter'd heaps, around promiscuous cast,</L>
<L>Mid savage chiefs Columbia's sons are spread,</L>
<L>While, breath'd from polar snows, the northern blast</L>
<L>Shakes its cold pinions o'er the unburied dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For them no more shall morning gild the sky,</L>
<L>No more shall May unveil her radiant charms,</L>
<L>No more shall Joy illume the sparkling eye,</L>
<L>Or Glory's voice excite the soul to arms.</L>

<LG>
<L>Near yon grey rock by withering leaves conceal'd,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not far, a corse distinguish'd o'er the rest,</L>

<L>Deep opes the wound that g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d his manly breast,</L>
<L>And his pale features wear a smile serene.</L>

<LG>
<L>Too well alas! that much lov'd form I know,</L>
<L>Those features pale with gory dust o'erspread,</L>
<L>O'er whom has Friendship mourn'd in bitterest woe,</L>
<L>For whom Affection's tenderest tears are shed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still, still in Fancy's view recurs the day</L>

<L>Opprest with toil, while countless foes surround,</L>
<L>Thy arm, thy voice, the fainting troop inspir'd;</L>
<L>And e'en when sinking with the deadly wound,</L>
<L>Thy latest breath their martial ardor fir'd.</L>

<L>Lamented Hero, far from weeping friends!</L>

<L>Long, long shall Memory's ardent eye recall</L>

<L>O'er the lone spot where rests thy mouldering form,</L>

<LG>
<L>THE hosts like two black ridges stood,</L>
<L>On either side wild Lubar's stream;</L>
<L>Here Foldath frown'd a darken'd cloud,</L>
<L>There Fillan shone a brightening beam.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their long spears glittering in the wave,</L>
<L>Each hero pour'd his voice afar;</L>
<L>Gaul struck the shield, the signal gave,</L>
<L>At once both armies plung'd in war.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="256" REF="025104_0262_0FCE5650C3DBCEE8"/>
<L>Steel pour'd its flashing gleam on steel;</L>
<L>The fields two rushing torrents glow,</L>
<L>That whitening foam, in mingled swell,</L>
<L>O'er the dark rock's projecting brow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He comes, with fame immortal crown'd,</L>
<L>His faulchion lays the heroes low;</L>
<L>Death rides the shadowy blasts around;</L>
<L>Thy paths O Fillan warriors strew!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Between two rocks in fissures rent,</L>
<L>Brave Rothmar stood, the warrior's pride;</L>
<L>Two aged oaks, that winds had bent,</L>
<L>Their branches spread on either side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Silent he shades his friends in flight,</L>
<L>While his dark eyes on Fillan roll;</L>
<L>Fingal beheld the approaching fight,</L>
<L>And all the father fill'd his soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As falls the stone of Loda, hurl'd</L>
<L>From trembling Drumanard's high cliff,</L>
<L>When angry spirits rock the world;</L>
<L>So Rothmar fell, blue-shielded chief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Young Culmin's friend'y steps are near,</L>
<L>His eye the bursting tear o'erflows;</L>
<L>Wrathful he cuts the empty air,</L>
<L>Ere yet with Fillan's mix his blows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He first with Rothmar bent the bow,</L>
<L>Along his own blue-winding streams;</L>
<L>And mark'd the dwelling of the roe,</L>

<L>"Why Youth would'st thou provoke the might</L>
<L>Of that bright beam, that wasting fire?</L>
<L>Unequal were your sires in fight;</L>
<L>Retire, Culalluins's son retire!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lone in her hall, his mother casts</L>
<L>Her eyes o'er Strutha's winding streams;</L>
<L>Wrapp'd in a whirlwind's eddying blasts,</L>
<L>Her son's thin spectre faintly gleams.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His dogs stand howling on the plain,</L>
<L>Red his suspended shield with gore;</L>
<L>"And is my fair-hair'd hero slain?</L>
<L>Pale does he lie on Ullin's shore?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As pierc'd in secret lies a hind,</L>
<L>Panting her wonted streams beside;</L>
<L>The hunter views her feet of wind;</L>
<L>Culalluin's son thus Fillan eyed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In a small stream his hair is roll'd,</L>
<L>His blood slow wanders o'er his shield;</L>
<L>Still grasps his hand, with dying hold,</L>
<L>The sword that fail'd in danger's field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Thou'rt fallen ere thy fame was known,"</L>
<L>Said Fillan, musing o'er the slain;</L>
<L>"Elate, in hopes of thy renown,</L>
<L>Thy father sent thee to the plain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perhaps, his streams grey bending o'er,</L>
<L>His dim eyes seek thee on the heath;</L>
<L>In vain,—for ah! returns no more,</L>
<L>His son extended pale in death."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="258" REF="025104_0264_0FCE56539D8720B8"/>
<L>Wide o'er the heath, in terror lost,</L>
<L>The flight of Erin Fillan pour'd;</L>
<L>But, man on man, falls Morven's host,</L>
<L>Before the rage of Foldath's sword.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Undaunted, Dermid meets his course;</L>
<L>The sons of Cona wake the fight;</L>
<L>But cleft his shield, by Foldath's force,</L>
<L>And far is spread his people's flight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The exulting foe with haughty boast,—</L>
<L>"Go Malthos, go to Erin's lord;</L>
<L>And bid him guard blue ocean's coast,</L>
<L>Lest Morven's king escape my sword.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For cold must Fingal lie in gore,</L>
<L>Near some low fen his tomb shall rise</L>
<L>Without a song, while hovering o'er,</L>
<L>Half hid in mist, his spirit flies."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In darkening doubt stood Malthos bold,</L>
<L>He knew the boaster's heart of pride;</L>
<L>Around his gloomy eyes he roll'd,</L>
<L>And plung'd in war with sullen stride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In Clono's narrow vale, two trees</L>
<L>Dark-bending o'er the rolling flood,</L>
<L>Shook their broad branches to the breeze;</L>
<L>There Duthno's son in silence stood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The blood is streaming from his thigh;</L>
<L>A rock sustains his ashen spear;</L>
<L>His bossy shield lies broken nigh;</L>
<L>"Why Dermid, why that bursting tear?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="259" REF="025104_0265_0FCE56555EC2E0C0"/>
<L>"I hear the battle roar afar,</L>
<L>Alone my people on the plain;</L>
<L>No shield is mine to stem the war,</L>
<L>And weak and slow my steps of pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shall Foldath then prevail in fight?</L>
<L>Ere that in death shall Dermid lie;</L>
<L>Again stern chief I'll prove thy might,</L>
<L>Again thy fiercest rage defy."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He seiz'd his spear the strife to join,</L>
<L>When Morni's son before him stood;</L>
<L>"Stay Dermid stay, no shield is thine,</L>
<L>Thy trembling steps are mark'd with blood."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Chief of Strumon give thy shield,</L>
<L>Oft has it stemm'd the battle's force;</L>
<L>This arm may yet sustain the field,</L>
<L>May yet repel yon boaster's course.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold that stone, with moss o'erspread,</L>
<L>Where spires the waving grass so high;</L>
<L>There low a kindred chief is laid—</L>
<L>And there in night let Dermid lie."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Slowly he rose the hill's tall brow,</L>
<L>And view'd the troubled field of death;</L>
<L>The gleaming ranks of fight below,</L>
<L>Disjoin'd, and broken o'er the heath.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As fires at distance, seem by night</L>
<L>Now lost in smoke, in darkness drown'd,</L>
<L>Now rear on high their streams of light,</L>
<L>As cease or blow the winds around;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="260" REF="025104_0266_0FCE565695A313E8"/>
<L>So met the battle from afar</L>
<L>Broad-shielded Dermid's eager eye.</L>
<L>Amidst the varying scene of war</L>
<L>The chief of Morna towers on high;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Like some black ship, in lofty pride,</L>
<L>Dark rider of the billowy plain;</L>
<L>Wide sporting o'er the echoing tide,</L>
<L>When winter rules the stormy main.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dermid with rage beheld his course,</L>
<L>He rush'd to meet the gloomy foe;</L>
<L>But fails the wounded hero's force,</L>
<L>And tears of pride his eyes o'erflow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He sounded thrice his bossy shield,</L>
<L>And thrice on Foldath call'd aloud;</L>
<L>Foldath with joy the chief beheld,</L>
<L>And lifted high his spear of blood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As some vast rock whose rugged side</L>
<L>Is mark'd with streams of many a storm;</L>
<L>So look'd, with wandering blood bedyed</L>
<L>The gloomy chief of Morna's form.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each host, appall'd, in terror flies,</L>
<L>From the contending fierce of Kings.</L>
<L>At once their gleaming points arise,</L>
<L>With speed of lightning Fillan springs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The haughty foe, with trembling, view'd,</L>
<L>That dazzling beam of early fame;</L>
<L>That swift, as issuing from a cloud,</L>
<L>To save the wounded hero came.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="261" REF="025104_0267_0FCE56591AC16168"/>
<L>In sounding strife as on the gale</L>
<L>Two broad-wing'd eagles fierce contend;</L>
<L>So, on Moilena's far-spread vale,</L>
<L>The chiefs in gloomy battle bend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Low on his shield is Foldath laid,</L>
<L>Pierc'd by the youthful hero's spear;</L>
<L>Nor o'er the fallen Fillan staid,</L>
<L>But onward roll'd the storm of war.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Malthos beheld the warrior low,</L>
<L>Low laid on Lubar's winding shore;</L>
<L>His bosom melts in generous woe,</L>
<L>And hatred fills his soul no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He seem'd a rock, down whose grey sides</L>
<L>The desart waters trickling stray;</L>
<L>When slow the sailing mist divides,</L>
<L>And gives its blasted trees to day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus to the dying chief he said,—</L>
<L>"Say shall thy mossy stone ascend,</L>
<L>Where Ullin's dark-green hills are spread,</L>
<L>Or Morna's woody vales extend?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There, where the sun looks forth serene,</L>
<L>On blue Dalrutho's bordering glades;</L>
<L>Fair Dardulena's steps are seen,</L>
<L>Thy daughter, pride of Erin's maids."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Rememberest thou," the chief reply'd,</L>
<L>"The maid, because no son is mine,</L>
<L>To roll the battle's deathful tide,</L>
<L>And in revenge in arms to shine?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="262" REF="025104_0268_0FCE565A52B72EF8"/>
<L>I am reveng'd, for not in vain</L>
<L>Has shone the lightning of my spear.</L>
<L>Amidst the tombs ot those I've slain</L>
<L>My narrow house, O Malthos! rear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft shall I leave my airy fold,</L>
<L>To hail the spot where low they lie;</L>
<L>When, spread around me, I behold,</L>
<L>The rank grass of their graves on high."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His spirit rush'd on eddying winds,</L>
<L>And came to Dardulena's dream;</L>
<L>As, wearied with the chace of hinds,</L>
<L>She slept by blue Dulrutho's stream.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her bow unstrung is near her placed,</L>
<L>The breezes fold her raven hair;</L>
<L>Each charm of youthful beauty graced</L>
<L>The love of chiefs, the blue-eyed fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From the dark skirts of Morna's wood,</L>
<L>Her father's ghost, pale bending, gleam'd;</L>
<L>At times his bloody form he shew'd,</L>
<L>Then hid in shrouding vapors seem'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She rose in tears, her soul divin'd</L>
<L>The chief in death was lowly laid;</L>
<L>To her a beam of light he shin'd.</L>
<L>When folded in his darkest shade.</L>

<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM THE CONQUEST OF SCANDINAVIA; BEING THE INTRODUCTION OF THE FOURTH BOOK. BY THE SAME.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ODIN</HI> having defeated the Scandinavians in several great bat∣tles, <HI>WOLDOMIR,</HI> the druidical sovereign of Scandinavia, reduced to the utmost distress, obtains the assistance of <HI>GRYMER,</HI> Prince of the Saraceni,—a Scythian Tribe,— the hereditary foe of <HI>ODIN</HI>; and having assembled his forces on an extensive plain, near the banks of a river, prepares to attack the Enemy, who are encamped on the opposite shore.—The present Book commences with the Night preceding the engagement.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>NOW Night, in clouds involv'd, her mantle drew,</L>
<L>And deepest darkness veil'd the etherial blue;</L>
<L>Dire heard afar, with wild and hollow roar,</L>
<L>Hoarse groan'd the woods along the rocky shore;</L>
<L>Loaded with vapours dank and drizzling rains,</L>
<L>The chill North-east shrill whistled o'er the plains;</L>
<L>Pale shone the phantom fires, whose boding light</L>
<L>In tenfold horror vests the storms of night;</L>
<L><PB N="273" REF="025104_0278_0FCE5670D2B2BE40"/>And, wildly yelling thro the dreary shade,</L>
<L>Shriek'd the sad spectres of the unburied dead;</L>
<L>Involv'd in anxious cares, and gloomy thought,</L>
<L>When Mondak's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grymer.</NOTE> Son the tent ot Ulfo sought.</L>
<L>Ulfo the old, renown'd for magic lore,</L>
<L>From Volga's flood to cold Kamschatka's shore;</L>
<L>Amid the gloom of Scythian forests bred,</L>
<L>Where Altai lifts on high his wintry head;</L>
<L>Among a savage race, rapacious, rude,</L>
<L>Wild as the storms that toss the Caspian flood,</L>
<L>As thunder dreadful, bursting from the cloud,</L>
<L>When Night o'er Altai hangs her sable shroud.</L>
<L>Olaf his sire, in fields of death renown'd,</L>
<L>As chief in war, the stern barbarians own'd,</L>
<L>Sprung from that race accurst, whose demon sway</L>
<L>The hoary Giants of the Frost obey,</L>
<L>The same stern soul which mark'd his sires of yore,</L>
<L>The same fell hate to Woden's laws he bore,</L>
<L>The same inspir'd the son, whose rebel pride</L>
<L>The God derided, and his power defied.</L>
<L>In nature vers'd, to him each plant was known</L>
<L>That blooms mid Scythia's snows, or Afric's torrid zone;</L>
<L>Each secret power that earth's dark bosom hides,</L>
<L>That rules in ocean, or in air presides.</L>
<L>To him had Grymer sent, o'er realms afar,</L>
<L>With costly gifts, to win him to the war,</L>
<L>When first imperial Woldomir implor'd,</L>
<L>In Scandinavia's aid, the hero's sword;</L>
<L><PB REF="025104_0279_0FCE5672D25000E8"/>Nor less impell'd by envious hate, he came,</L>
<L>Of Odin's glory and of Woden's name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Intent to solve the dark decrees of fate,</L>
<L>In deep enquiry fix'd, the Wizard sate;</L>
<L>When, Grymer entering, from his seat he prest,</L>
<L>With eager haste, and thus the Chief addrest.</L>
<L>"Say, at this hour, when o'er the dreary plains,</L>
<L>In all her horrors, Night funereal reigns;</L>
<L>While shrieks of terror on the blast arise,</L>
<L>And the black tempest howls along the skies;</L>
<L>At this untimely hour, what potent cause</L>
<L>Forth from his tent the Prince of Scythia draws?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"O Sire of magic!" thus the Prince replied,—</L>
<L>"My Shield in battle, and my counsels' guide,</L>
<L>Full well to thee is known what weight of care</L>
<L>Hangs on the vast uncertainty of war;</L>
<L>What anxious fears a leader's peace annoy,</L>
<L>Possess his soul, and every thought employ.</L>
<L>The chief who hopes in glory's walks to shine,</L>
<L>And round his brows the palms of conquest twine,</L>
<L>When war's dark tempest spreads its horrors round,</L>
<L>Not in the bowers of thoughtless Ease is found;</L>
<L>Not on the lap of Sloth reclines his head,</L>
<L>By proud Presumption's flattering glare misled;—</L>
<L>Which oft the vainly confident betrays,</L>
<L>And lights to ruin with its phantom blaze;—</L>
<L>But, when the hour of battle hovers near,</L>
<L>Neglects no caution, tho' he knows no fear.</L>
<L>By cares like these impell'd, I hither come,</L>

<L>And slumber seals the wearied soldier's eyes:</L>
<L>For lo! to morrow wakes the rage of fight,</L>
<L>When morning opes the golden gates of light;</L>
<L>To morrow gives my eager arm to dare</L>
<L>This scourge of Scandia's realms, this pest of war;</L>
<L>Gives me, perchance, that first of joys to know,</L>
<L>The joy of vengeance on a hated foe.</L>
<L>For that fell hate, which steel'd our sires of yore,</L>
<L>Which dyed so oft in blood jaxartes' shore,</L>
<L>That hate my breast with all its rage inspires,</L>
<L>Sublim'd, by rival love, to fiercer fires.</L>
<L>Yes! still revenge has set that day aside,</L>
<L>When, scorn'd my passion, and my suit denied,</L>
<L>Hermanric's daughter gave her heaven of charms,</L>
<L>Detested thought! to Odin's happy arms.</L>
<L>But tho' my soul delights where Danger rears</L>
<L>His awful crest, amid the strife of spears,</L>
<L>And glows with transport in the fierce alarms,</L>
<L>The shock of battles, and the din of arms;</L>
<L>Tho', in comparison, the foe are lost</L>
<L>Mid the vast numbers of our warlike host;</L>
<L>Yet not, in vain security, reclin'd,</L>
<L>The events of battle fill my anxious mind.</L>
<L>Perchance the Gods, too partial to the foe,</L>
<L>Our strength may wither, and our hopes o'erthrow;</L>
<L>For Odin long has prov'd their guardian care,</L>
<L>By Woden shielded in the storms of war;</L>
<L>And still the favoring God his aid affords,</L>
<L>And bears him harmless mid descending swords.</L>
<L>How oft has Scandia mourn'd her heroes' doom,</L>

<L>Ill-omen'd bats, in torpid clusters, hung;</L>
<L>And o'er the bottom, with dank leaves bestrow'd,</L>

<HEAD>AN ODE, ADDRESSED TO MISS ****.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE LATE REV. JOSEPH HOWE, OF BOSTON.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>NEVER did parting Youth feel more</L>
<L>Than I, fair Maid, when from the shore</L>
<L>Thy vessel sail'd away;</L>
<L>And can not then my prayers prevail,</L>
<L>Nor love, nor vows, nor tears, avail,</L>
<L>Nor aught procure thy stay?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Was it for this that I so long</L>
<L>Listen'd, to Fortune's syren song</L>
<L>Listen'd with rapturous joy?</L>
<L>Did she, for this, inspire my heart,</L>
<L>With hopes that we should never part,</L>
<L>And thus these hopes destroy?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Amid the much-admiring crowd,</L>
<L>While thus I sigh'd my griefs aloud,</L>
<L>I scarce refrain'd to speak;</L>
<L>Shame held my tongue, while from my eye</L>
<L>The pearly drops, full plenteously,</L>
<L>Stole trickling down my cheek.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, near fair Tibur's silver flood,</L>
<L>The Roman Bard, gay Horace, stood,</L>
<L>And saw Galatea sail;</L>
<L>And thrice he warn'd her, o'er, and o'er,</L>
<L>And told the fates Europa bore,</L>
<L>In hopes he might avail.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="298" REF="025104_0304_0FCE56A36DE2EAF0"/>
<L>In hopes he might avail to move</L>
<L>The fixed purpose of his love,</L>
<L>From such a dangerous choice.</L>
<L>But all in vain, like me, he tried,</L>
<L>Galatea still did firm abide,</L>
<L>Deaf to his moving voice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Then go, if naught," the Bard rejoin'd,—</L>
<L>"Can move the purpose of thy mind,</L>
<L>"Go, and may blessings follow thee;</L>
<L>"Let every gentle gale attend,</L>
<L>"Let every wave thy voyage befriend,</L>
<L>"But think, ah think! of me."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor less to heaven did I prefer,</L>
<L>For thy dear sake, my pious prayer.</L>
<L>O winds, O waves, agree!</L>
<L>Winds gently blow, waves softly flow,</L>
<L>Ship move with care, for thou dost bear</L>
<L>The better part of me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And think, and think, I also said—</L>
<L>On all the vows which we have made,</L>
<L>On all those charming scenes,</L>
<L>Which once, with glee, we pass'd away,</L>
<L>Pleased in each other, night and day,</L>
<L>Nor envied kings and queens.</L>

<HEAD>MESSAGE OF MORDECAI TO ESTHER. FROM A MANUSCRIPT POEM. BOOK II,—THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY TIMOTHY DWIGHT, D. D.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>THOU know'st, O Esther! from thy infant years,</L>
<L>To rear thy form, to nurse thy opening mind,</L>
<L>To teach thee every virtue, every truth,</L>
<L>To form thee finish'd, lovely, great, and wise,</L>
<L>Was all my care supreme. Friendless, alone,</L>
<L>An orphan scarcely budded, well thou know'st</L>
<L>I found thee; as a darling flower (the rose,</L>
<L>That blooms in Sharon, or at Hermon's foot</L>
<L>The lilly of the vale) from midst the wild,</L>
<L>With every care remov'd thee to my field,</L>
<L>And saw thee rise, and bloom, and send abroad</L>
<L>A fragrance, richer than the Arabian gale.</L>
<L>Why all adorn'd with beauty's living bloom,</L>
<L>In form as some young Virtue of the skies,</L>
<L>Of tincture died in health's immortal stream,</L>
<L>Of eye resplendent, as the morning sun</L>
<L>Looks thro' the cloud's fair opening, and of grace,</L>
<L>Where heaven was pleas'd to move in mortal guise;</L>
<L>Why form'd with soul, superior to thy kind,</L>
<L>With thoughts expanding thro' the world's wide round,</L>
<L>And pinion'd to the skies; with hardy mind,</L>
<L>Patient and daring, as the hero stands</L>
<L>Upon the deadly and fierce flaming breach,</L>
<L>Serene while Death walks onward; yet more soft</L>
<L><PB N="300" REF="025104_0306_0FCE56A673218DC8"/>Than the pleas'd infant smiles the savage dumb;</L>
<L>Why all accomplish'd, and why angel all,</L>
<L>I ponder'd long, and now from Heaven I learn.</L>
<L>This mighty hour the Eye Omniscient mark'd,</L>
<L>While fair, beneath his forming hand, uprose</L>
<L>Thy varied excellence. For this Heaven gave</L>
<L>Thy virtue, gift supreme, that virtue crown'd</L>
<L>With wisdom's power; that wisdoms cloth'd divine</L>
<L>With beauty's angel form; that form around</L>
<L>Diffus'd the light of Heaven; and all adorn'd</L>
<L>With grace and sweetness, dignity and love.</L>
<L>On that proud day, when, from an hundred realms</L>
<L>Summon'd, came many a lord, and chief, and king,</L>
<L>Magnificent, to grace the monarch's feast,</L>
<L>And all the pomp of Persia round him spread;</L>
<L>When Vashti's insolence, beyond all thought,</L>
<L>Her presence to the illustrious train refus'd;</L>
<L>When, taught by Memucan he wisely bade</L>
<L>The haughty fair one wear the crown no more;</L>
<L>Even then a field I saw, by Heaven outspread,</L>
<L>To give thy virtue scope, and rich reward.</L>
<L>Pondering, I brought thee to the eunuchs' Prince;</L>
<L>Amaz'd, amid all Persia's beauteous maids,</L>
<L>Thee, thee alone he gaz'd. Convinc'd, I knew</L>
<L>The crown reserv'd for thee. With no surprise,</L>
<L>I saw thee lifted to the world's great throne:</L>
<L>'Twas thus the Skies decreed. But, O bless'd fair!</L>
<L>Not for thyself the Heavens thy beauty gave,</L>
<L>Thy grace, thy wisdom; nor, for thee alone,</L>
<L>Did Mordecai uprear thy precious bloom.</L>
<L>Heaven's gifts are virtue's aids; for virtue us'd,</L>
<L>Are us'd aright; or else are given in vain.</L>
<L><PB N="301" REF="025104_0307_0FCE56AB2C1241D0"/>On thy great power to bless, all Israel build<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>A solemn claim. A voice, as thunder loud,</L>
<L>Awful, majestic, from thy nation sounds,</L>
<L>And bids thee rise to save. Their cause thou know'st</L>
<L>The cause of heaven. In them religion lives;</L>
<L>From them Messiah springs, by whose bless'd hand</L>
<L>All nations good, and life▪ and glory gain.</L>
<L>The world's great happiness on their suspend.</L>
<L>Creation's end, and Providence' great scope.</L>
<L>Go then, thy nation save. Should every ill,</L>
<L>Even death, betide; yet what is life, or death,</L>
<L>When Israel calls, when God demands our life.</L>
<L>And know, O fair! if thou thy voice withhold,</L>
<L>Yet to the ruling Heavens, whose piercing eye</L>
<L>All mortal things surveys, ten thousand paths,</L>
<L>From danger's deepest caves, lead up to day:</L>
<L>Paths, tho' by man unseen, yet strait, and plain,</L>
<L>To God's all-piercing view. Thro Death's dark vale,</L>
<L>Such paths shall Israel guide to life and peace.</L>
<L>Then from the skies indignant, while thy race</L>
<L>To peace and joy ascend, thy fairest day</L>
<L>Of duty, glory, lost, thy soul shall feel</L>
<L>The piercing anguish of a wounded heart,</L>
<L>And waste with keen remorse, and sad despair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus wrote the feeling Prince. Awhile, in deep</L>
<L>And solemn contemplation sat the fair,</L>
<L>Pondering the forceful message. Rouz'd at length</L>
<L>From off the sofa, all that softly sweet,</L>
<L>Angelic smile her face forsook; her eye,</L>
<L>Kindling with sacred fire, shot forth a ray</L>
<L>Of sunbright glory; high her bosom rose;</L>
<L><PB N="302" REF="025104_0308_0FCE56AC0E841C38"/>Her pulse beat high, and loftily she walk'd</L>
<L>The spacious room. Surpriz'd, her virgins stood,</L>
<L>While thus her faithful Hatach she address'd.</L>
<L>Go tell illustrious Mordecai, my soul</L>
<L>Is warm'd to this great deed. His daughter's heart</L>
<L>Shuns not for Israel, or for Heaven, to die.</L>
<L>Undone by me, no duty shall demand</L>
<L>Another's bosom; lost by me, no hour</L>
<L>Of real glory shall another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rown</L>

<L>Thro' Shushan's walls, with prayers, and tears, and fasts,</L>
<L>Implore the Skies; and tho no bright'ning hope</L>
<L>Presents the king complacent; yet, to morrow,</L>
<L>My feet shall tempt the court of gloomy danger,</L>
<L>And if my life's exacted, let me die.</L>

<L>Around her diadem, mid rows of pearls,</L>
<L>Twinkled unnumber'd stars. Two cupids fair</L>
