<P><HI>I</HI> A. B. <HI>do sincerely Promise and Swear, That I will be Faithful, and bear true Allegiance to Their Majesties, King</HI> WILLIAM <HI>and Queen</HI> MARY.</P>
<P>So help me God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I</HI> A. B. <HI>do Swear, That I do from my Heart Abhor, Detest, and Abjure, as Impi∣ous and Heretical, that Damnable Doctrine and Position,</HI> That Princes Excommu∣nicated or Deprived by the Pope, or any Authority of the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> may be Depo∣sed or Murthered by their Subjects, or any other whatsoever.</P>
<P><HI>And I do Declare, That no Foreign Prince, Person, Prelate, State, or Potentate, hath, or ought to have any Jurisdiction, Power, Superiority, Preeminence, or Autho∣rity Ecclesiastical or Spiritual within this Realm.</HI></P>
<P>So help me God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I A. B.</HI> do solemnly and sincerely in the presence of God, profess, testifie and declare, that I do believe that in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, there is not any Tran∣substantiation of the Elements of Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of Christ, at or after the Consecration thereof, by any person whatsoever, and that the Invocation or ado∣ration of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> or any other Saint, and the sacrifice of the Mass as they are now used in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> are Superstitious and Idolatrous. And I do solemnly in the presence of God, profess, testifie and declare, that I do make this Declaration and every part thereof in the plain and ordinary sence of the words read unto me, as they are common∣ly understood by <HI>English</HI> Protestants, without any Evasion, Equivocation or mental Reser∣vation whatsoever, and without any Dispensation already granted me for this purpose by the Pope, or any Authority or Person whatsoever, or without any hope of any such Dispensation from any Person or Authority whatsoever, or without thinking that I am or can be acquitted, before God or Man, or absolved of this Declaration or any part thereof, although the Pope or any other Person or Persons or Power whatsoever should dispence with, or annul the same or declare that it was null and void from the beginning.</P>
