<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a magnificent spectacle to behold a great people annually crouding their tem∣ples to consecrate the anniversary of their sovereignty. On this occasion the heart of every true American beats high with a just and noble pride. He still hears the illus∣trious Fathers of his Country appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World for the rectitude of their conduct, declare that the United States "ARE AND OF RIGHT OUGHT TO BE, FREE AND INDEPENDENT." The black catalogue of <HI>injury, abuse, contempt</HI> and <HI>crime,</HI> which exhausted forbearance and drove us to resistance, rushes on his mind. He passes in review those great men who
<PB N="4" REF="038437_0003_1011F024D87932A0"/>
then burst upon the world, and who, en∣dowed with every virtue and every talent which could fit them for the arduous task in which they engaged, appeared to be ex∣pressly commissioned by Heaven to rule the storm of revolution. It was then indeed that human nature, which for eighteen cen∣turies had appeared nearly to have lost those qualities which alone ennoble it, emerged at once from its degradation, and recover∣ed the lustre with which it shone in the hap∣piest days of antiquity.</P>
<P>ON the islands of the <HI>Adriatic,</HI> the moun∣tains of <HI>Biscay,</HI> and the rocks of <HI>Uri,</HI> the spirit of Liberty had indeed successfully sought a refuge, but driven at last, from all that could delight her on earth, she had al∣ready flapped her wings on the glaciers of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and was taking her flight to∣wards Heaven—The American people rose—they burst their fetters—they hurled them at their oppressors—they shouted they were FREE—The sound broke across the <HI>Atlan∣lic</HI>—it shook the fog-wrapt island of <HI>Britain,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="038437_0004_1011F05436E37F98"/>
and re-echoed along the <HI>Alps.</HI> The as∣cending spirit heard it—she recognized in it the voice of her elect, and holding her course <HI>westward,</HI> she rejoicing saw her in∣cense rise from a thousand altars. Her presence assured our triumph. Painful however was the struggle, and terrible the conflict which obtained that triumph—our harbours filled with hostile fleets—our fields ravaged—our cities wrapt in flames—a nu∣merous, veteran and unprincipled enemy let loose upon us—our army thinned by bat∣tles—wasted by sickness—disgusted by treachery and desertion—a prey to every species of privation and reduced to the last misery next despair—Even then, how∣ever, this little army shewed themselves worthy the holy cause for which they con∣tended. Driven from <HI>Long-Island</HI>—from the heights of <HI>Harlem</HI>—from <HI>White Plains</HI> pursued from post to post even to beyond the <HI>Delaware</HI>—they would often turn upon their insulting foe—and mingling their blood with the melting lava of the cannon's mouth, foretel them of <HI>Tronton, German∣town</HI> and <HI>Monmouth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="038437_0005_1011F0274C6D88A8"/>
BUT it was not in the ardent conflicts of the field only that our countrymen fell; it was not the ordinary chances of war alone, which they had to encounter. Happy in∣deed, and thrice happy were WARREN, MONT∣COMERY and MERCER; happy those other gallant spirits who fell with glory in the heat of battle distinguished by their country, and covered with her applause. Every soul, sensible to honor, envies rather than com∣passionates their fate. It was in the dun∣geons of our inhuman invaders; it was in their loathsome and pestiferous prison-ships, that the wretchedness of our countrymen still makes the heart bleed. It was there that hunger and thirst, and disease, and all contumely cold-hearted cruelty could be∣stow, sharpened every pang of death. Mis∣ery there wrung every fibre that could feel before she gave the blow of grace which sent the sufferer to eternity. It is said that poison was employed. No—there was no such mercy there—There nothing was em∣ployed which could blunt the susceptibility to anguish, or which by hastening death
<PB N="7" REF="038437_0006_1011F05601A06990"/>
could rob its agonies of a single pang. On board one only of these prison-ships above <HI>eleven thousand</HI> of our brave countrymen are said to have perished. She was called the <HI>Jersey.</HI> Her wreck still remains, and at low ebb presents to the world its accursed and blighted fragments. Twice in twenty four hours the winds of Heaven sigh through it, and repeat the groans of our expiring countrymen, and twice the ocean hides in her bosom those deadly and polluted ruins, which all her waters cannot purify. Every rain that descends washes from the unconse∣crated bank the bones of those intrepid suf∣ferers. They lie naked on the shore accus∣ing the neglect of their countrymen. How long shall gratitude and even piety deny them burial. They ought to be collected in one vast ossery, which shall stand a mon∣ument to future ages of the two extremes of the human character; of that depravity which, trampling on the rights of misfor∣tune, perpetrated cold and calculating mur∣der on a wretched and defenceless prisoner, and that virtue which animated this prison∣er
<PB N="8" REF="038437_0007_1011F029B27586B8"/>
to die a willing martyr for his country. Or rather, were it possible, there ought there to be raised a <HI>Colossal Column,</HI> whose base sinking to <HI>bell,</HI> should let the murderers read their <HI>infamy</HI> inscribed on it, and whose capital of <HI>Corinthian</HI> laurel assending to <HI>Heaven</HI> should show the fainted <HI>Patriots</HI> that they have triumphed.</P>
<P>DEEP and dreadful as the colouring of this picture may appear, it is but a faint and imperfect sketch of the original. You must remember a thousand unutterable ca∣lamities, a thousand instances of domestic as well as national anxiety and distress, which mock description. You ought to remem∣ber them, you ought to hand them down in tradition to your posterity, that they may know the awful price their fathers paid for freedom.</P>
<P>IT would be well however amidst these bitter recollections, to suppress if possible the muttered curse of indignation; to pass in silence over the name of that nation which
<PB N="9" REF="038437_0008_1011F05875BF9908"/>
was our enemy; and if the effort is not <HI>above</HI> human magnanimity, to hold her, without antipathy, "as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends." Of all the passions which vex the human breast there is none perhaps which dupes stupidity or excites malevolence like nation∣al antipathy. It hangs with a dark malig∣nity about the heart, and gives a tone to all its emotions. It violates not only the evan∣gelical precepts which enjoins the forgive∣ness of injuries, but disregarding the max∣ims of justice and even of common sense, it denies to virtue its excellence, it takes from crime its guilt, and disturbs society by a fu∣rious denunciation of vengeance without being able to assign its provocation. To a man under the influence of this unhappy malady, the manners of the unconscious for∣eigner, his gestures, his language, his food, and even the fashion of his coat are sources of uneasiness. But this is not all: He, who has once justified himself in his hatred to a part of the human race, has surmount∣ed the first great barrier to crime, benevo∣lence.

When <HI>Amilcar</HI> took <HI>Hannibal</HI> at only nine years old to the altar, and made him swear eternal enmity to the <HI>Romans,</HI> he violated the most sacred duties of the <HI>Fa∣ther</HI> and the <HI>Man.</HI> He ought to have fill∣ed the heart of his son with <HI>benevolence</HI> for the promotion of his felicity, and that of his fellow-men. Was there not malignity enough in the human breast without exact∣ing a guarantee for its hatred; or was it to be feared that <HI>Hannibal</HI> would too easily have forgiven his enemies unless forbid by the awful religion of an oath? National an∣tipathy has been the low and ignoble poli∣cy employed by some governments to se∣cure support in the wild wars of their am∣bition, but it is a policy which deeply affronts the people with whom it is employed, a policy which I trust the <HI>just</HI> and <HI>noble</HI> spir∣it of every AMERICAN will <HI>spurn</HI>—What—must we be led to believe that the rest of mankind are fools and villains before we can have a good opinion of our own wis∣dom and virtue; or must we be worked into an idea that they are all cowards before

we dare to place a confidence in our own courage. No—let us have the generosity, the magnanimity, the justice, to give to all nations their <HI>due;</HI> let us dwell on those qual∣ities which exalt rather than those which disgrace them, and let us found our glory on our own worth and not on their defects.</P>
<P>THE two great objects which divide the industry of the world are <HI>agriculture</HI> and <HI>commerce.</HI> Statesmen and moralists have calculated the effects which each of these has on the manners and opinions of man∣kind. They have been generally inclined to believe that commerce corrupts and makes mankind venal. Among the adver∣saries, however, of extensive commercial intercourse, will often be found men too deeply impressed with the charms of a coun∣try life, or those who have received disgust from the anxieties and disappointments of trade. They reflect that <HI>Carthage</HI> was the most commercial nation of antiquity, and there so little regard was paid to the prin∣ciples of integrity, that Punic faith became
<PB N="12" REF="038437_0011_1011F02FB7DEC3D0"/>
proverbial throughout the world. From a∣mong the nations of modern times, they chuse out <HI>Hamburg.</HI> This city, which in a high and pompous stile calls herself free and imperial, is purely commercial. Confined within her ramparts, she holds no inter∣course with nature, and it is scarcely known by some of her inhabitants, whether the vegetables they eat are not manufactured like the cloaths they wear. They have no fashions, no manners, and scarce a language of their own. They never think of their <HI>God</HI> unless it be to effect an insurance against his dispensations. People of all nations and tongues resort there; and when the citizens of this mighty republic assemble on their Exchange, which to them is the <HI>Camp</HI> of <HI>Mars,</HI> they form a motley group of dif∣ferent from and complexion, of differ∣ent manners and religion, of different ac∣cents and dress from all the different quar∣ters of the world, united and alike alone in their object, that of making <HI>money.</HI> There many a battle is fought, kings dethroned and nations conquered for <HI>half per cent,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="038437_0012_1011F05D6068BCD8"/>
Money is their great good; every thing is bought and sold, hospitality herself is set upon the tariff, and they will almost give you the price current of an oath. Talk to a <HI>Hamburgher,</HI> who probably was first a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> a <HI>Ragusan,</HI> a <HI>Genoese,</HI> or an <HI>Eng∣lishman,</HI> about the <HI>love of country</HI> and he will think you mad—he has <HI>no</HI> country. Talk to him about <HI>liberty</HI> and he will praise it, because he thinks you mean a <HI>free trade.</HI> He troubles himself no further with the po∣litical changes in the world than they af∣fect the markets, and if he has a preference for one country above another it is that where the best speculation is to be made.—Such is the sombre pencil with which com∣merce is pourtrayed. Agriculture is touch∣ed with brighter colours. It is remember∣ed that in the early days of <HI>Rome</HI> every thing <HI>virtuous</HI> and <HI>honourable</HI> was found among the rural tribes—The cultivation of the soil gives health and vigor to the body, and purity and tranquillity to the mind. The human form attains in the labors of the field its utmost development. The full
<PB N="14" REF="038437_0013_1011F0315D6F3F70"/>
chest, the muscular and brawny arm and the toil-strung sinew are the reward of the hus∣bandman. He preserves with nature all his relations. He every where converses with his God. He every where contem∣plates order, economy and peace, and his soul is filled with a delightful harmony. The seasons return with unerring regulari∣ty; nothing is in vain; every thing pro∣gresses towards some end for which it has been designed by the eternal wisdom, and every thing attains this end, without inter∣ference and without confusion; amidst the low but transporting music of the spheres. The cultivator of the soil is indeed a Patri∣ot. The habits formed in his youth never desert his age. The very trees and rocks among which he has grown up are objects of his affection. He loves the soil which has rewarded his labours, and he finds mu∣sic in the echo of his native hills. Even the fidelity of the honest <HI>Swiss</HI> was not proof to that touching air<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rans des Vaches.</NOTE> which brought to his remembrance the charms of his rural
<PB N="15" REF="038437_0014_1011F05FBA54B570"/>
home. Strongly however as agriculture and commerce may appear to be here con∣trasted: they are not naturally enemies, nor even rivals; they are friends and ought to unite for the attainment of a great and com∣mon object. In this country above all oth∣ers do they require the mutual aid of each other. Agriculture supplies Commerce with the articles of her exports, and with a ready market for her returns. Commerce, in her turn, incites the husbandman to labor beyend his wants, by administering to his enjoyments.—Make Commerce the only honorable pursuit; the farmer would de∣sert his plough, and leave the most delight∣ful country in the world to become again a howling wilderness—Destroy Commerce, the farmer would transform himself into a winder of silk or a knitter of lace, or, what alas is more probable, he would be actua∣ted by no nobler incentive than his coarse appetites, he would feel the last ray of civil∣ization expire within him, and he would revert to all the horrors of savage life. Is it not then astonishing that any man should
<PB N="16" REF="038437_0015_1011F033C4318450"/>
wish for the destruction either of agricul∣ture or commerce, since the first is necessa∣ry to life, and the second to make life ami∣able. It is the <HI>spirit</HI> of <HI>party</HI> alone which can be guilty of such madness. But of what is not the spirit of party guilty? It assails the fairest virtue—it overturns the statues of heroes—it ransacks nature for a poison, and by the midnight taper consults with science how to apply it. A thorough party-man forgets even himself, he is deaf to the sug∣gestions of self-love—he is absorbed in the sole desire of oppressing his opponents, and if ever a ray of pleasure crosses his dark and sullen soul it is when he has succeeded in inflicting some misery upon them. In his blind excess he neither loves himself, his par∣ty, or his country; but he hates religiously every one who differs from his opinions, when, perhaps these opinions were as light∣ly embraced as they are malignantly defend∣ed. He often in fact has no more faith in these opinions than the man he would sacri∣fice for not adopting them. He can de∣cree to <HI>Aristides</HI> the ostracism and to <HI>Socrates</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="038437_0016_1011F062873C7A60"/>
the deadly hemlock, and the next day ad∣vocate the just politics of the one and the pure morality of the other. This <HI>party, than</HI> has indeed no <HI>principle</HI> to rest upon, he is hung up like a <HI>pendulum</HI> and in eternal oscilation as stupidity or design may set him in motion, the rapidity of his vibrations are inversely as his length. Beware how you indulge this <HI>terrible</HI> spirit of party. There is no security in the triumph it may obtain, for you to day; to-morrow the very instru∣ments of that triumph may be turned upon you with affrightful execution. The same irregularity, which at one moment brought the loyal and virtuous <HI>Stafford</HI> to the scaf∣fold, was found a fit instrument the next for the execution of the popular and illustri∣ous <HI>Sydney:</HI> the same guillotine severed the neck of <HI>Danton,</HI> which had fallen on that of <HI>Louis,</HI> and <HI>Marius</HI> returned from the ru∣ins of <HI>Carthage</HI> to glut himself with venge∣ance on those who had driven him thither.</P>
<P>REVOLTING however as this barbarous spirit may appear, it generally chuses its▪
<PB N="18" REF="038437_0017_1011F0354FDCCE68"/>
dwelling in the fairest portions of the world, and although in its excess it appears the im∣placable and mortal <HI>enemy</HI> to <HI>liberty,</HI> yet is it nearly allied to that genius of faction which has often proved her strong but un∣tractable friend. This last indeed appears to be the thunder, which, while it shakes, refreshes and purifies the political atmos∣phere. Wherever it has been complete∣ly silenced every foul and noxious vapor has arisen which could extinguish life, or fully its charms. You may have the silence of death, you may have the patient despair of slavery; but violence will never obtain for you a free and animated tranquillity. <HI>Ire∣land</HI> will indeed be quiet when every tree is turned into a gallows, and <HI>France,</HI> had the energy of <HI>Robertspierre</HI> continued a little longer would have <HI>lost</HI> the last virtue that could rebel. All history is indeed full of the factions of free States. These, howev∣er, like the mountains oak appeared to ga∣ther vigor from the storms that shook them. <HI>Athens</HI> in one year, under the death-like tranquillity of a tyrant, lost more strength,
<PB N="19" REF="038437_0018_1011F065D1958A88"/>
more riches, more elegance, more glory than amidst the bosterous agitations of all her parties or even the conflicts of civil war. But these were not the beggarly and servile conflicts between a red rose and a white one, not whether a weak and inglorious bigot, or a wanton and abandoned debauchee should be king; they were not those temporary bursts of misery which now and then agitate the wretched inhabitants of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and which an execution will allay without exhibiting any evidence of its justice. They sprung from that unbroken spirit, that wild and unfettered boldness, that restless, that uncontroulable, that sublime love of Li∣berty which sometimes indeed mistakes its means but never loses fight of its object; which while it seems to endanger often se∣cures that object, and which burns with un∣diminished force while one generous senti∣ment lingers in the human breast to support it. I would rather, exclaimed a noble Pal∣atin<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Palatin of Posania; his words are Malo Libertatem periculosam quam quietum servitium.</NOTE> in the Polish diet, I would rather
<PB N="20" REF="038437_0019_1011F090E2FA77C0"/>
have danger with liberty than safety with servitude. It is indeed better to be tossed by the rudest storm that ever vexed the po∣litical ocean than to be motionless in port, and like a <HI>Genoese</HI> galley-slave have Liber∣ty only on your chains. But is the human race then doomed to the melancholy alterna∣tive of servitude or eternal insurrection. Must they be forever buffeted from despo∣tism to anarchy, and from anarchy to despot∣ism? If from these evils there is a refuge, it is not in the energy of government only, nor in the tame and worn-down spirit of the people—It is in the diffusion of knowledge, the indulgence of political opinion and the cultivation of the social virtues. You may give to government sufficient power to quell an insurrection, you ought to give it; but there are but two causes of insurrection; op∣pression and delusion. Will the energy of government redress the first? It is but a sanction to it. Will it cure the last? There is no avenue by which violence can arrive at the understanding. It may well be doubt∣ed if among the fifty thousand <HI>Moors,</HI> the
<PB N="21" REF="038437_0020_1011F0675BB356D0"/>
fierce Zealot<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ferdinand of Arragon.</NOTE> who conquered <HI>Grenada</HI> caused to be baptized at the point of the bayonet, there was a single convert to the <HI>Catholic</HI> faith. It is the light of knowledge alone which can dissipate error; it is that alone which can give a people worth and re∣spectability in the eyes of their rulers, and at the same time teach them the necessity of supporting a righteous government. Igno∣rance, by eternally brooding over imagina∣ry griefs, often produces real ones. That acquaintance, which every one has the leis∣ure to acquire, with the springs of human action and the leading events which have taken place in the world, must show the most timid how terrible that security is which absolute power affords, and convince the most adventurous and hardy of the tremend∣ous attributes of that freedom which exists in tempests and convulsions. <HI>Charondas,</HI> of all the legislators of antiquity, has alone the glory of having known the true source of republican happiness. He established FREE-SCHOOLS.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="038437_0021_1011F0935F4EADD0"/>
MUTUAL moderation between those of different political sentiments is essential to social harmony. It was said with truth, some thousand years ago, that it is not the opinions of men, but their quarrels about these opinions, which disturb the world. We have seen among religious sects, the a∣stonishing effects of toleration. From the conquest of <HI>Britain</HI> by the <HI>Romans,</HI> to the settlement of this state by its illustrious Founder, that balm to religious dissention appeared, like the lazerpitium of <HI>Egypt,</HI> to have left the world, or to have been consid∣ered as a worthless weed. It was then that the fiercest passions of the human breast, clad themselves in celestial armour, and re∣tiring into the impenetrable recesses of con∣science, harrassed the world with inexora∣ble and cruel warfare. It was then that mankind, in contending for the altar, for∣got the GOD, and destroyed in the name of religion, every thing that was dear to hu∣manity. But when toleration returned, all sects and persuasions, happy in the security obtained for themselves, ceased to molest
<PB N="23" REF="038437_0022_1011F069F4E18578"/>
others; and piety confiding vengeance to him, who has said it is mine, once more kneeled to the divinity.</P>
<P>IF such is the power of toleration over bigotry and superstition, which are uncon∣troulable by any earthly wisdom, whose flights are above the sublimest reason, and leave the understanding wearied and con∣founded whenever it attempts to pursue them; what have we not a right to expect from political moderation? Politics have no forbidding mysteries; they do not strain themselves to be co-extensive with faith, which, expanded by the ardours of zeal, of∣ten stretches beyond the utmost confines of possibility; they never leave the earth un∣less when hoisted for a moment from their sphere, by the gas of visionaries. Here ev∣ery thing may safely be brought to the test of reason, and here truth, when pursued with sincerity and moderation, will not be pursued in vain. Every absurdity and ex∣travagance necessarily contain the seeds of their own mortality, and unless they re∣ceive
<PB N="24" REF="038437_0023_1011F094F0EA5AA8"/>
a forced and artificial existence from persecution, they will die a speedy and tran∣quil death. It is a powerful truth, that no doctrine hostile to social order, can long prevail among a calm and enlightened peo∣ple. Government has the safe keeping of the public repose, but it has no right to in∣terfere with the consciences or reasonings of the governed. An interference of this kind is indeed as fruitless as it is unjust. How weak was I, exclaimed the Imperial bigot<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Charles the 5th.</NOTE> in his convent in <HI>Estre Madura,</HI> to have en∣deavoured by violence to reduce <HI>Europe</HI> to one faith, when I am unable to make even two watches move alike.</P>
<P>THE next political heresy after intole∣rance, which merits the reprobation of ev∣ery good citizen, is deception. Every Gov∣ernment which derives its support immedi∣ately from the people, ought to walk in the light. It ought to be able to meet every investigation, with a serene front; and with that confidence which conscious integrity inspires.
<PB N="25" REF="038437_0024_1011F06D31DC4070"/>
A people the least enlightened can∣not long be deceived, their good sense will ultimately detect every intrigue, and they will be terrible to those who may have abus∣ed their credulity. Darkly barbarous in∣deed must be that nation which it is neces∣sary to cheat into happiness, and unrighte∣ous and unprincipled must be that government which will descend to fraud for any purpose. The false notions of the people are sometimes however called honest preju∣dices, and the deceptions of government are hallowed with the name of pious frauds. But every man of feeling must weep over that honesty which is the mere result of de∣lusion, and every man of virtue must execrate that piety which couples itself with a fraud.—In <HI>America, "however, where the right of sovereignty resides indisputably in the body of the people, and where</HI> ALL <HI>are equal by law and by birth</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Adams' Defence of the American Constitution.</NOTE>," if you expect purity in the stream, you must keep the source free from pollution. If there is not virtue in the people, it cannot reasonably be presum∣ed
<PB N="26" REF="038437_0025_1011F09B050F7C88"/>
to exist in those who are chosen by, and from the people. There is no magic in an election, which will make a sage of an idiot, or transform a rogue into an honest man. Neither is candor and confidence to be ex∣pected in return for violence and jealousy. Every passion constantly tends to reproduce itself in its object: Even the divine com∣mand to return good for evil, having had to encounter the strongest propensities of the human heart, has obtained but a partial obedience. If you desire then moderation and confidence from your rulers, you must treat them with moderation and confidence. Do you ask what duty imposes on you the obligation of leading the way. It may be answered, that if ever the delightful compe∣tition of being and doing good takes place, it must begin somewhere, and you must have a better opinion of the virtue of others than you have of your own if you expect they will begin it.</P>
<P>THE politician may amuse you with a fa∣vourite system, he may tell you of the excel∣lence
<PB N="27" REF="038437_0026_1011F06F965F3028"/>
of this or that form of government, he may paint to you the magic there is in a balance of three powers; but every nation will be free or enslaved, happy or miserable, not by the parchments or prescriptions of the magistrate, but by the manners and cha∣racter of the people. Should the Grand Signior, by his Firman, establish through∣out his dominions a Constitution exactly similar to that of the <HI>United States,</HI> would <HI>Syria, Palestine</HI> and <HI>Egypt</HI> rise from their ruins, or degenerated <HI>Greece</HI> rekindle the holy fires of her <HI>freedom.</HI> No—<HI>Slavery</HI> would there still hug her chains; the <HI>Arab</HI> would still watch for plunder behind the fallen towers of <HI>Palmyra,</HI> and the barbarous inhabitant of <HI>Romelia</HI> would step heedlessly over the fragments of the <HI>Areopagus</HI> and the prostrate columns of the <HI>Parthenion.</HI> The balance of three powers has been exalted a∣bove the influence of religion. But where shall we find its excellence. Shall we look to the governments of ancient times? They have perished? Shall we search for it in <HI>England?</HI> Did it exist there in the absolute

despotism of the <HI>Tudors?</HI> Did it flourish in the murder and exile of the <HI>Stuarts?</HI> Is it to be found in the venality of the house of <HI>Han∣over?</HI> Prerogative, indeed, has dropt the sceptre, but corruption pours invisibly her aerial acid on the heart, and stifles there ev∣ery noble passion. Patriotism herself has be∣come a mercenary, and the honest <HI>English∣man</HI> of the present day, like <HI>Isaac,</HI> the tyrant of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> is well contented with his chains if they are but of silver. It is a kind of quackery in politics to prescribe one and the same constitution, as a sovereign reme∣dy to the evils of all nations. The excel∣lence of a government does not consist in either concentrating or dividing its powers, nor in an hereditary or elective executive, but in being adapted to the peculiar man∣ners and circumstances of the nation, where it is instituted. Superlatively happy, how∣ever, is that nation, where the people are sufficiently temperate and enlightened, to submit to a government of their own choice; for although monarchy may be best for some countries, yet those countries are for that
<PB N="29" REF="038437_0028_1011F071207FEE58"/>
very reason more miserable than where a re∣public is best. Every man in the <HI>United States,</HI> who wishes for monarchy, must have either the vanity to think himself more vir∣tuous than his fellow-citizens, or the con∣sciousness that he is not sufficiently virtuous to discharge his duties voluntarily. That man is no less a revolutionist, who would rear a throne on the ruins of a republic than he who would establish popular dominion on the destruction of royal power.</P>
<P>IT was a maxim of the great <HI>De Witt,</HI> that no nation however weak ought ever to relinquish a single point, the justice of which is obvious. That nation indeed, which dares not to be just to herself, will never be just to others. Such a nation has no business with sovereignty. It is extravagant and ridicul∣ous for a people to <HI>boast</HI> of <HI>independence,</HI> when they are <HI>afraid</HI> to make peace with one power least they should provoke anoth∣er. It must be humiliating to every man of spirit, and distressing to every man of prin∣ciple, tamely to submit to the abuses of a
<PB N="30" REF="038437_0029_1011F09F527DDB30"/>
haughty nation, and even to court her fa∣vour by wantonly defying her rival. Base and pusillanimous is it to play the hero where there is no danger, and the coward where there is. This is a mode of conduct which may answer the narrow and selfish views of a few little, headstrong political bargain-makers, but it can never gratify the just pride of a great people.</P>
<P>PERHAPS the expectations of many would be here disappointed was the war which now rages in <HI>Europe</HI> to be passed over in silence. In that war we behold something to admire but much to condemn. It makes the warri∣ors' pulse beat quick and high. Military skill has there attained its perfection; <HI>Hanni∣bal</HI> and <HI>Fabius</HI>—<HI>Turenne</HI> and <HI>Conde, Marl∣borough</HI> and <HI>Villars,</HI> with all their diversity of excellencies every where find equals. Yet the skill of the General does not surpass the courage of the Soldier. Across the rage of battles, in the deadly breach, over the smoak∣ing ashes of cities, and the convulsive mem∣bers of the slain, he seeks for glory. In the
<PB N="31" REF="038437_0030_1011F073B63E65F8"/>
onset prompt—impetuous—terrible as the glowing thunder-bolt; in defence, firm, and calm, and immoveable as a rock of adamant—a magnanimity—a fortitude—an intre∣pidity every where prevail—Victory has lost her insolence, defeat her disgrace, and death his terrors. But we must turn from the splen∣dor of this scene, where virtue appears at once to weep and to rejoice, where destruc∣tion herself rises on her pedestal with a high and imposing majesty, and where human na∣ture indemnifies herself for the calamities she suffers by ennobling the hand which in∣flicts them—we must turn from this scene to the cold crimes of politics.</P>
<P>ON either side we behold the atrocity of the end aggravated by the atrocity of the means, and the charms of profession harsh∣ly contrasted with affrightful realities. <HI>Uni∣versal domination</HI> has entered the lifts against <HI>universal monopoly</HI>—while <HI>liberty</HI> and the <HI>rights of man</HI> have found themselves among the auxiliries of <HI>tyranny,</HI> and <HI>religion</HI> and the <HI>love of order</HI> have been pressed into the

service of <HI>sacriledge</HI> and <HI>confusion:</HI>—LIBER∣TY—has the demolished the <HI>Bastile</HI> merely to take her sullen seat among the ruins, and to hurl them at affrighted humanity; and the rights of man do they consist in the ex∣pedition of a trial or the dispatch of an exe∣cution—do they hang upon the lamp-post or stream beneath the guillotine—are they to be found in provincial <HI>Holland</HI>—in dis∣tressed <HI>Liguria</HI>—in divided <HI>Venice,</HI> or on the desolated mountains of <HI>Helvetia.</HI></P>
<P>ON the other side, does RELIGION leave her holy places to trample upon every thing ven∣erable in years, amiable innocence, or re∣spectable in virtue. Does she execute mili∣tary law on the catholics of <HI>Ireland;</HI> does she hang the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Milan;</HI> does she man∣gle, and tear, and devour, the wretched pro∣testants at <HI>Naples.</HI> Does the love of order fill the world with ruin, discord and murder? Does it open the sluices upon the peasants of <HI>Belgium?</HI> Does it fire the kelp-thatched hovels of the fishermen on the coasts of <HI>Nor∣mandy?</HI> Does it excite treachery, sedition
<PB N="33" REF="038437_0032_1011F077028D9080"/>
and mutiny on board the fleets of <HI>Holland?</HI> Does it wake the furies of civil war on the confines of <HI>Almorica,</HI> and pay the <HI>Vendean</HI> and <HI>Chouan Brigand</HI> for the extinction of the hu∣man race. Does religion, does the love of or∣der bring single and double knotted devo∣tion from the wilds of <HI>Muscovy</HI> to fix her pol∣luted altars on the plains of <HI>Italy.</HI> Do they—but here the full heart must have vent—do they double the most southern promontory of <HI>Africa</HI> to go and overthrow the throne of an independent monarch of <HI>Asia.</HI> The blood of <HI>Saib</HI> was as pure that of the <HI>Bourbons</HI>—as noble as that of the <HI>Brunswicks.</HI> Unhappy monarch, was it not enough for him to be∣hold his territories dismembered and devas∣tated—his subjects slaughtered and enslaved—but were his throne, his family and his life devoted to destruction. He defended his power with a spirit which shewed he deserv∣ed it. His death was worthy of a king. He fell gored in front by many a wound, and the mangled bodies of his faithful subjects raised over him a glorious mausoleum. Let the <HI>pretended</HI> champions of religion, of or∣der,

and of ancient institutions tell of the plunder each assassin shared from the profan∣ed regalia of this murdered monarch; let the first and most celebrated minister in <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> insult his fallen fortunes, in cold and contemptuous irony, with the title of <HI>Citizen Tippoo;</HI> yet the wrongs of <HI>Citizen Tippoo</HI> shall be remembered, when the subverters of his power, the destroyers of his life, and the calumniators of his fame shall be crushed with execration or forgotten in oblivion. Let us take care how we bestow applause from the prevailing passion of the moment. <HI>Gedzar</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gedzar, says Baron de Tott, signifies in the Turkish language, Butcher, and that this very Pacha assumed it as ex∣pressive of his love of Human blood. See 3 vol. Mem. B. de Tott.</NOTE> <HI>Pacha</HI> and <HI>Suwarrow</HI> were the heroes of the last year, but the first has already become again the butcher of <HI>Acre,</HI> and the last the sacker of <HI>Ismael</HI> and the bloodsucker of <HI>Warsaw.</HI></P>
<P>SHOULD we be involved in the present European contest, if we are <HI>just</HI> we shall have <HI>nothing</HI> to <HI>repent</HI>—if we are <HI>united</HI> we shall have <HI>nothing</HI> to <HI>fear.</HI> UNION is the heart thro' which must circulate those streams of
<PB N="35" REF="038437_0034_1011F07982171C48"/>
life, of health, of joy, which shall animate ev∣ery member, which shall heal every disease, and which shall give a zest to every blessing. United you may set securely like a mighty giant on your mountains, and bending a stern regard upon the ocean dare the coming of the proudest foe; the little topical erup∣tion of a County or a State shall yield to the hale vigor of the whole; and every part re∣ciprocating those good offices, which a di∣versity of soil and climate give them the high privilege of rendering acceptable—you shall exhibit a spectacle which shall awe and delight the universe. Policy, genius, nature herself invites to union. She has bound us together by a chain of mountains which no human strength can break—she has interlac∣ed us by a hundred majestic streams, which pass and repass the boundaries of States; which parting nearly from the same sources flow in a hundred different directions, disre∣garding the little prejudices of the districts they fertalize; and now approaching, now receding from each other, they wind in a thousand mazes and weave a knot which no
<PB N="36" REF="038437_0035_1011F0A5D41BEB30"/>
intrigue can loosen, which no sword can se∣ver. Who will not rise superior to local pre∣possessions—who will not feel himself the citizen of a common country, the child of a common parent; and who is he, wherev∣er may be his abode, whether on this or the other side of the <HI>Chesapeak,</HI> whether on the banks of the <HI>Missisippi,</HI> or the borders of the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> who, while he exults in the name of an <HI>American</HI> will not regard as his brother every one who has a title to that proud distinction.</P>
<P>BE UNITED, was the last injunction which trembled from the lips of our departed <HI>WASHINGTON.</HI> At the name of <HI>Wash∣ington,</HI> does not a melancholy pleasure sad∣den and delight your souls. The <HI>Fourth of July</HI> shall never pass but HE on it shall be remembered. He has filled the world with his and our glory. The <HI>Tartar</HI> and the <HI>A∣rub</HI> converse about him in their tents. His form already stands in bronze and marble among the worthies of ancient and modern times. The fidelity of history has already
<PB N="37" REF="038437_0036_1011F07B0A8D2818"/>
taken care of the immortality of his fame. His <HI>example</HI> shall animate <HI>posterity,</HI> and should <HI>faction</HI> tear, or <HI>invasion</HI> approach our country, his <HI>spirit</HI> shall descend from the divinity and inspire <HI>tranquillity</HI> and <HI>cou∣rage. Death</HI> has not terminated his useful∣ness, he has not yet ceased to do good, and even now he holds from his tomb a torch which cheers and enlightens the world. He loved <HI>truth,</HI> let us love it; let us seek it with a sincere and single heart. It will re∣ward the search. It is great, immutable and eternal. The fugitive falshoods of the mo∣ment shall perish; party and passion may write their names upon the plaster, but this shall one day moulder, and truth remain forever inscribed upon the marble. But mistake not for truth that consistency which constitutes the mock virtue of the present day. Is the pursuit of this preposterous virtue the commission of one fault often makes a thousand others necessary. The unfortunate man who has committed it must not allow that he has erred, he must not take council of conscience, he must not
<PB N="38" REF="038437_0037_1011F0A930025438"/>
claim sanctuary in the charity of his kindred men; but he must have the spirit to adopt a system which shall vindicate the infallibil∣ity of his head, though at the sacrifice of ev∣ery amiable quality of his heart; and im∣pelled by the power of consistency he must press onward, though, like the <HI>Leming,</HI> he mark his course through life by a right-line of destruction. But truth, though it never changes, never errs—it shines with a mild and equal lustre—it breaks through the clouds of ignorance and barbarity—it dis∣pels the emanations of vice and folly, and like the sun diffusing light and joy, it goes on forever rejoicing in its course.</P>
