<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following little Poem was published in London, in February <HI>1792.</HI> It happened that two of the principal con∣spirators, the emperor Leopold, and the king of Sweden, died in a few weeks after. The opposite effects, produced by the death of these two persons, are very remarkable. From a view of the general character of the king of Sweden, and of the particular transactions of the last year of his life, there can be no doubt but he has determined to go any lengths with the powers which were then confederating against the liberty of France; and it is a consolation to human nature, that the violent death of one sceptred mad-man has saved the people of Sweden from those hor∣rid scenes of slaughter which now involve most of the neighbour∣ing nations.</P>
<P>The character of Leopold, in some of its leading traits, was
<PB N="vi" REF="026618_0004_0FD2253CDD0949E0"/>
directly the reverse of that of Gustavus. The latter was prod∣igal of wealth, and excessively eager for what is called military fame, without the capacity or the means of acquiring it; the former was affectedly pacific, moderate in most of his vices, and remarkable for nothing but his avarice. He had sense enough to see that nothing was to be gained by a war with France; his avarice, had he lived, would have been a sufficient guar∣antee against that event; and his death may be considered as the immediate cause of the war.</P>
<P>The treaty of Pilnitz was doubtless fabricated in the court of Paris. The emperor agreed to it, for the purpose of duping the king of Prussia into measures which might secure the obedi∣ence of the people of Brabant, whom he had pacified the year before by a cruel deception. His design was likewise to deceive the emigrant princes, who were then deceiving him; and to exhibit such a menacing appearance, as, according to his cal∣culation, would induce the French people to set down quietly under a limited monarchy; well knowing that, if they did this, their government would soon degenerate into a despotism, which would continue to give countenance to the general principle that had so long enslaved the nations of Europe.</P>
<P>That he never intended, or had relinquished the intention, of executing the conditions of the treaty of Pilnitz by going to war with France, is evident from the following considerations: the French constitution was ratified, and the revolution suppo∣sed to be finished, in September <HI>1791.</HI> A war, to overturn
<PB N="vii" REF="026618_0005_0FD2253F76B52468"/>
that constitution, certainly ought not to have been deferred be∣yond the ensuing spring; and as it would require an army of two or three hundred thousand men, the winter must have been occupied in making the preparations. Leopold died suddenly, about the first of March. At that time no preparations had been made for offensive hostilities. The number of troops sent from Austria into the Low Countries, during the autumn and winter, was not more than was stipulated to be maintained there, and were scarcely sufficient to enforce the despotism to which he had destined that unhappy people. Before the death of Leo∣pold, the French emigrants at Coblentz began to despair. The hopes they had built on the treaty of Pilnitz had nearly van∣ished; the princes had an army of forty thousand gentlemen to maintain; Louis was carrying on too great a system of corrup∣tion at home, to be able to supply them with money from his <HI>civil list;</HI> they had exhausted their credit in all the mercan∣tile towns in Europe; and Leopold, considering them in the character of beggars, began to treat them as troublesome guests; for none of the objects of their demands could be flattering to his favourite passion. At last, to their great satisfaction, the emperor died; and his system with regard to France was either never understood by his own ministers; or it was laid aside, in compliance with the predominant passions of his son; which happened to be for war, expence, and unqualified despotism.</P>
<P>This young man began his career by a solemn declaration to all the powers of Europe, that he should follow precisely the syst∣em
<PB N="viii" REF="026618_0006_0FD22540C92BA800"/>
of his father, with respect to the affairs of France. This de∣claration might be understood to mean the open and avowed system, prescribed by the treaty of Pilnitz, or the secret and un∣explained system, which was to avoid the war. It was univer∣sally understood, as it was doubtless meant, in favour of the a∣vowed system; whose object, announced in the treaty, was "<HI>to support the rights of crowns.</HI>"</P>
<P>From this moment, a spirit of hostility was provoked by the Court of Vienna, and encouraged by the French ambassador there, who, like their other ambassadors, was betraying the nation, to serve the king; till, on the <HI>20</HI>th of April, war was declared by the National Assembly. In this war the des∣pots of Europe will try their strength, and will probably soon be exhausted.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONSPIRACY OF KINGS.</HEAD>
<L>ETERNAL Truth, thy trump undaunted lend,</L>
<L>People and priests and courts and kings, attend;</L>
<L>While, borne on western gales from that far shore</L>
<L>Where Justice reigns, and tyrants tread no more,</L>
<L N="5">Th' untainted voice, that no dissuasion awes,</L>
<L>That fears no frown, and seeks no blind applause,</L>
<L>Shall tell the bliss that Freedom sheds abroad,</L>
<L>The rights of Nature and the gift of God.</L>
<L>Think not, ye knaves, whom meanness styles the Great,</L>
<L N="10">Drones of the Church and harpies of the State,— </L>
<L>Ye, whose curst sires, for blood and plunder fam'd,</L>
<L>Sultans or kings or czars or emp'rors nam'd,</L>
<L>Taught the deluded world their claims to own,</L>
<L>And raise the crested reptiles to a throne,—</L>
<L N="15"><PB N="10" REF="026618_0008_0FD2254414EB4920"/>Ye, who pretend to your dark host was given </L>
<L>The lamp of life, the mystic keys of heaven;</L>
<L>Whose impious arts with magic spells began,</L>
<L>When shades of ign'rance veil'd the race of man;</L>
<L>Who change, from age to age the sly deceit,</L>
<L N="20">As Science beams, and Virtue learns the cheat; </L>
<L>Tyrants of double powers, the souls that blind,</L>
<L>To rob, to scourge, and brutalize mankind,—</L>
<L>Think not I come to croak with omen'd yell</L>
<L>The dire damnations of your future hell,</L>
<L N="25">To bend a bigot or reform a knave,</L>
<L>By op'ning all the scenes beyond the grave.</L>
<L>I know your crusted souls: while one defies</L>
<L>In sceptic scorn the vengeance of the skies,</L>
<L>The other boasts,—"I ken thee, Power divine,</L>
<L N="30">"But fear thee not; th' avenging bolt is mine."</L>
<L>No! 'tis the present world that prompts the song,</L>
<L>The world we see, the world that feels the wrong,</L>
<L>The world of <HI>men,</HI> whose arguments ye know,</L>
<L>Of men, long curb'd to servitude and woe▪</L>

<L>Think not (ah no! the weak delusion shun,</L>
<L N="40">Burke leads you wrong, the world is not his own)</L>
<L>Indulge not once the thought, the vap'ry dream,</L>
<L>The fool's repast, the mad-man's thread-bare theme,</L>
<L>That nations, rising in the light of truth,</L>
<L>Strong with new life and pure regenerate youth,</L>
<L N="45">Will shrink from toils so splendidly begun,</L>
<L>Their bliss abandon and their glory shun,</L>
<L>Betray the trust by Heav'n's own hand consign'd,</L>
<L>The great concentred stake, the intrest of mankind.</L>
<L>Ye speak of kings combin'd, some league that draws</L>
<L N="50">Europe's whole force, to save your sinking cause; </L>
<L>Of fancy'd hosts by myriads that advance</L>
<L>To crush the untry'd power of new-born France.</L>

It only remains now for him and them to try on this new livery upon the French nation.</NOTE>?</L>
<L>Can Artois' sword, that erst near Calpe's wall,</L>
<L>Where Crillon sought and Elliott was to fall,</L>

A Duke of Cumberland, in order to become an Alexander, had to ride all the way to Culloden, and back again to London. Louis the Fourteenth was obliged to submit to the fatigue of being carried on board of a splendid barge, and row∣ed across the Rhine, about the same time that the French army cros∣ed it; and all this for the simple privilege of being placed above the Macedonian in the temple of Fame, and of causing this atchievement to be celebrated, as more glorious than the passing of the Granicus; as may be seen on that modest monument in the <HI>Place vendome</HI> in Paris.</P>
<P>The Count d'Artois has purchased, at a still dearer rate, the fame of being styled "<HI>le digne rejeton du grand Henri,</HI>" and of being destined to command all the armies of Europe in re-establishing the Monar∣chy of France. This champion of Christendom set out at the age of twenty-five, and travelled by land with a princely equipage, from Paris to Gibralter; where he arrived just in time to see, at a conve∣nient distance, Elliot's famous bonfire of the floating batteries. He then returned, covered with glory, by the way of Madrid; and arri∣ved at Versailles, amidst the caresses of the court and the applauses of all Europe. The accomplishment of this arduous enterprise has de∣servedly placed him, in point of military fame, at the head of all the present branches of the illustrious house of Bourbon.</P></NOTE></L>

<HEAD>Note on Mr. Burke, referring to page 17.</HEAD>
<P>* Some of the author's friends in England, although they join with him in censuring the writings of Mr. Burke on the French Revolu∣tion, are of opinion that the picture here drawn of that writer is too highly coloured; or at least, that the censure is so severe as to lose the effect that it might otherwise produce. It is impossible to say what effect, and whether any, has or will be produced by this poem; but, out of respect to the opinion above stated, it may be proper to make some observations on the effect that has already followed from the writings of Mr. Burke. I speak not of what has taken place in England; where it is supposed that, contrary to his intentions and those of the government that set him at work, his malicious attack upon liberty has opened a discussion which cannot be closed until the whole system of despotism, which he meant to support, shall be over∣turned in that country. The present war with France is doubtless the last piece of delusion that a set of hereditary tyrants will ever be able to impose upon the people of England.</P>
<P>But this subject opens a field of contemplation far more serious and extensive on the continent of Europe; where if Mr. Burke can view without horror the immensity of the mischiefs he has done, he will show himself worthy of much higher attributes of wickedness than have yet been ascribed to him. It is a painful task to traverse such a wide scene of slaughter and desolation as now involves the nations of Europe, and then to lay it all to the charge of a single individual; especially when we consider that individual as having for a long time before, enjoyed the confidence of all good men, and having at last be∣trayed it from the worst and vilest motives; as he had established his previous reputation by speaking the language of liberty, and profes∣sing himself to be the friend of national felicity. But it is not from a transitory disgust at his detestible principles, it is from deliberate observation and mature conviction, that I state it as an historical fact, That the present war, with all its train of calamities, must be attribu∣ted almost exclusively to the pen of Mr. Burke.</P>
<P>There is a peculiar combination of circumstances which threw this
<PB N="26" REF="026618_0024_0FD22575EEFA5A18"/>
power into his hands, and which ought to be duly considered, before we come to a decision on the subject. The people of England had enjoyed for several ages a much greater portion of liberty than any other people in Europe. This had raised them to a great degree of eminence in many respects. At the same time that it rendered them powerful as a nation, it made them sober, industrious and persevering, as individuals; it taught them to think and speak with a certain air of dignity, independence and precision, which was unknown in other countries. This circumstance could not fail to gain the admiration of foreigners and to excite a perpetual emulation among themselves. England has therefore produced more than her proportion of the il∣lustrious men of modern times, especially in politics and legislation, as these affairs came within the reach of a larger class of men in that country than in any other.</P>
<P>In a nation where there is an enormous civil list at the disposal of the crown, and a constitutional spirit of liberty kept alive in the peo∣ple we must necessarily expect to find two parties in the government. In such a case, as the king is sure to carry all the measures that he dares to propose, the party in favour of the people are called the <HI>op∣position;</HI> and it being always a minority, it gives occasion for great exertion of talents, and is supposed to be the nurse of every public virtue. Such has been the composition of the English government ever since the last revolution. The opposition has been the school of great men; its principle disciples have been the apostles of liberty; and their exertions have made the British name respectable in every part of the world. Mr. Burke had been for many years at the head of this school; and from the brilliant talents he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>covered in that con∣spicuous station, he rendered himself universally respected. His elo∣quence was of that flowery and figurative kind, which attract∣ed great admiration in foreign countries; where it was viewed, for the most part, through the medium of a translation; so that he was considered, at least in every country out of England, as the ablest ad∣vocate of liberty that then existed in Europe. Even kings and tyrants,
<PB N="27" REF="026618_0025_0FD2257967554A48"/>
who hated the cause, could not withhold their veneration from the man.</P>
<P>Under these impressions, their attention was called to the great e∣vent of the French revolution. It was a subject which they did not understand, a business in which they had no intention to interfere; as it was evidently no concern of theirs. But viewed as a speculative point, it is as natural for kings as for other persons to wait till they learn what great men have said, before they form their opinion. Mr. Burke did not suffer them to remain long in suspence; but, to en∣lighten their understandings and teach them how to judge, he came forward with his "<HI>Reflections on the Revolution in France</HI>;" where, in his quality of the political schoolmaster of his age, in his quality of the professed enemy of tyrants, the friend of the people, the most en∣lightened leader of the most enlightened nation in Europe, he tells them that this Revolution is an abominable usurpation of a gang of beggarly tyrants; that its principle is atheism and anarchy; that its instruments are murders, rapes, and plunders; that its object is to hunt down religion, overturn society, and deluge the world in blood.— Then, in the whining cant of state-piety, and in the cowardly inso∣lence of personal safety, he calls upon the principal sovereigns of Eu∣rope to unite in a general confederation, to march into France, to in∣terfere in the affairs of an independent power▪ to make war with the principles which he himself had long laboured to support, to over∣turn the noblest monument of human wisdom, and blast the fairest hopes of public happiness that the world had ever seen.</P>
<P>Copies of his book were sent in great profusion by the courts of London and Paris to the other courts of Europe; it was read by all men of letters, and by all men of state, with an avidity inspired by the celebrity of the author and the magnitude of the subject; and it produced an effect which, in other circumstances would have appear∣ed almost miraculous; especially when we consider the intrinsic char∣acter of the work. M. de Calonne, about the same time, published a book of much more internal merit; a book in which falshood is
<PB N="28" REF="026618_0026_0FD2257C27A5FA88"/>
clothed in a more decent covering; and in which there is more ener∣gy and argument, to excite the champions of despotism to begin the work of desolation. But Calonne wrote and appeared in his true char∣acter. It was known that he had been a robber in France, and was now an exile in England; and, while he herded with the English rob∣bers at St. James's, he wrote to revenge himself upon the country whose justice he had escaped. His writings, therefore, had but little weight; perhaps as little as Mr. Burke's would have had, if his real object had been known.</P>
<P>But this illustrious hypocrite possessed every advantage for decep∣tion. He palmed himself upon the world as a volunteer in the gene∣ral cause of philanthropy. Giving himself up to the frenzy of an unbridled imagination, he conceives himself writing tragedy, with∣out being confined to the obvious laws of fiction; and taking advan∣tage of the recency of the events, and of the ignorance of those who were to read his rhapsodies, he peoples France with assassins, for the sake of raising a hue-and-cry against its peaceable inhabitants; he paints ideal murders, that they may be avenged by the reality of a wide extended slaughter; he transforms the mildest and most generous people in Europe into a nation of monsters and atheists, "heaping mountains upon mountains, and waging war with heaven," that he may interest the consciences of one part of his readers, and cloak the hypocrisy of another, to induce them both to renounce the char∣acter of men, while they avenge the cause of God.</P>
<P>Such was the first picture of the French Revolution presented at once to the eyes of all the men who held the reins of government in the several states of Europe; and such was the authority of the author by whom it was presented, that we are not to be astonished at the ef∣fect. The emigrant princes, and the agents of the court of the Thu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣leries, who were then besieging the anti-chambers of ministers in eve∣ry country, found a new source of impudence in this extraordinary work. They found their own invented fictions confirmed in their ful∣lest latitude, and a rich variety of superadded falshood, of which the
<PB N="29" REF="026618_0027_0FD2257F26AE1D68"/>
most shameless sycophant of Louis or of Condé would hare blushed to have been the author. With this book in their hands it was easy to gain the ear of men already predisposed to listen to any project which might rivet the chains of their fellow creatures.</P>
<P>These arguments, detailed by proper agents, induced some of the principal sovereigns of Europe to agree to the treaty of Pilnitz; then the death of Leopold, as I have stated in the preface, unhappily re∣moved the great obstacle to the execution of that treaty, and the war of Mr. Burke was let loose, with all the horrors he intended to ex∣cite. And what is the language proper to be used in describing the character of a man, who, in his situation, at his time of life, and for a pension of only fifteen hundred pounds a year, could sit down de∣liberately in his closet and call upon the powers of earth and hell to inflict such a weight of misery on the human race? When we see Al∣exander depopulating kingdoms and reducing great cities to ashes, we transport ourselves to the age in which he lived, when human slaugh∣ter was human glory; and we make some allowance for the ravings of ambition. If we contemplate the frightful cruelties of Cortez and Pizarro, we view their characters as a composition of avarice and fan∣aticism; we see them insatiable of wealth, and mad with the idea of extending the knowledge of their religion. But here is a man who calls himself a philosopher, not remarkable for his avarice, the delight and ornament of a numerous society of valuable friends, respected by all enlightened men as a friend of peace and a preacher of humanity, living in an age when military madness has lost its charms, and men begin to unite in searching the means of avoiding the horrors of war; this man, wearied with the happiness that surrounds him, and disgust∣ed at the glory that awaits him, renounces all his friends, belies the doctrines of his former life, bewails that the military savageness of the fourteenth century is past away, and, to gratify his barbarous wishes to call it back, conjures up a war, in which at least two millions of his fellow creatures must be sacrificed to his unaccountable passion. Such is the condition of human nature, that the greatest crimes have usual∣ly
<PB N="30" REF="026618_0028_0FD22580973A9820"/>
gone unpunished. It appears to me, that history does not furnish a greater one than this of Mr. Burke; and yet all the consolation that we can draw from the detection, is to leave the man to his own re∣flections, and expose his conduct to the execration of posterity.</P>
