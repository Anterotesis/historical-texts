<HEAD>SOME OF THE Fundamental Truths OF CHRISTIANITY. Briefly hinted at, by way of Question and Answer. With a Postscript by the Author G. K. The 3d Edition.</HEAD>
<P>Quest. O<HI>F whom have we our Being, our Living, and Moving, and all the good things we enjoy?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Of God.</P>
<P><HI>Q. How know we that?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> There is somewhat in our own hearts that declareth it unto us.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that our own Natural Reason, as Men.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Tho' we might gather it even from Reason, as men, yet there is some-what in us that doth more convincingly and manifestly declare it unto us, than our own Reason as men.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How do we distinguish it from Reason?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Very plainly, because it oft teacheth us this, and many other true things, when we are not exercising our Reason, but still and quiet in our Minds; yea, it oft preventeth all Reasonings in us, and in a more ready and immediate way convinceth us than Reason can do.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How so?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because Reason teacheth us things by a way of Discourse and Inference, gathering a second thing from a first, and a third from a second, and a fourth from a third, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which way is but mediate, and commonly is wea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>isom and tedious.</P>
<P>Q <HI>How doth that other teach us?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By setting things before our Understandings simply and im∣mediately, even as when the outward Light giveth us to see the shapes and colour of outward things immediately, without the need or use of our Reason.</P>
<P>Q <HI>How may this other thing be called which is in us, a dinstin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Prin∣ciple <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our Reason, as men?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="000604_0002_0FA95F5FA5177008"/>
<HI>A.</HI> It may be called (according to Scripture) a spiritual and di∣vine Light, which hath the same use to the Mind, that the outward Light hath to the Eye.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What other Names hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, according to Scripture?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Word of God, because thereby God speaketh his Mind and Will unto the Heart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Souls of men, as one man speaketh his Mind to another by the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of his Mou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h.</P>
<P>Q. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is Light and Word God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is an immediate Manifestation of him, which tho' it may be distinguished from him, yet is not, nor cannot be divided o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> se∣parated from him, for he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with it and in it, and is the Fountain and Life of it.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What other difference is there betwixt our Natural Reason and this Principle.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Our natural Reason may be corrupted, and is oft corrupted, and so may teach us contrary things unto what this teacheth, but this is altogether uncorruptible.</P>
<P>Q <HI>What other Difference is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> betwixt them?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ching<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of our natural Reason, even of things that may be true, are but dry and barren, and void of that living Virtue, In∣fluence and Vigour, which the Teachings of this Principle have; for this Prince, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> quick and powerful and pregnant, or full of heavenly and divine Virtue and Life.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>But do they not differ originally, as to their very Nature &amp; Being?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yea, they do; the one is Natural, the other Supernatural; the one is Humane, the other divine, the one is an essential Property of the Humane Nature, the other is the free Grace and Favour of God given unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ian to dignifie and exalt him above his natural E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ate and Condition; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o he may be more than a natural Man, even a Son and Child of God, yea, to have a Name better than of Sons and Daughters.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Is this Principle given unto all men?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yea, it is given unto all Men.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>For what end is it given unto all?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That they may become the Children of God thereby, and may live soberly, righteously and godly in this present World, as the Children of God, that so after this Life in this present World they may live with God in the World to come, in the fullness of ever∣lasting Joy, Peace and Happiness.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="000604_0003_0FA95F6052E7BCA8"/>
Q. <HI>By whom doth this Grace or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come-up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> all Men?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By Jesus Christ, as <HI>John</HI> declared; <HI>The Law</HI> (said he) <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> given by</HI> Moses, <HI>but Grace and Truth cometh by Jesus Christ,</HI> and of his Fullness have we all received Grace for Grace.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Is Jesus Christ himself given unto all Men, or only his Grace?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He is given unto all men, in so far as he is sent of the Father unto all, and is come unto all, and is both offered of the Father as his Gift, and doth also offer himself unto all, so that his Grace is not alone without him, nor he alone without his Grace, they are given together, and are offered together, and are received together.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How is Christ and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Grace to be distinguished?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A</HI> No otherwise than as the light, warmth and influence of the Sun is from the Sun himself, which preceedeth from the Sun, as out of his fullness, according to <HI>John'</HI>s declaration, who said, <HI>Out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fullness have we all received, and Grace for Grace.</HI></P>
<P>Q. <HI>How is Christ Jesus come unto all? Is he come outwardly as a Man unto all?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He is not come outwardly as a Man unto all, tho' he is come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven outwardly as Man for all (so that all may receive the benefit of his outward Coming as Man, who are not wanting unto themselves) but he is come inwardly unto all, as the true Light that lightens every man that comes into the World, and not only as the Light, but as the Resurrection and the Life.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How is he the Resurrection?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because he quickeneth and maketh alive the Soul unto God, &amp; raiseth it out of its sin, in which, as in a Grave, it hath layn dead and corrupted as to the Life of God.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Is this the general Condition of Men?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yea, the general Condition of Men in the first state, is, that they are dead in their sins and trespasses.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>All men therefore do need Christ, not only to be a Light unto them, but to be the Resurrection and the Life also.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A</HI> Yea, for they want not only Light unto their Understandings, but they want Life unto their Hearts, and unto all their inward Powers and Affection<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which are de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d (as unto God) so that they cannot move towards him, nor in his Service, but as they are quick∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and influenced by him.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How doth Jesus Christ minister Light and Life unto the Souls of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="000604_0004_0FA95F611F022BE0"/>
<HI>A.</HI> By his shinings and breathings in their hearts.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Is that Immediately, or Mediately, or bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Both Immediately and Mediately.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How Immediately?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Even without all outward Means, as by his free Love and Fa∣vour, preventing he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n before the use of any outward Means, and by ministring unto them who have not, nor never had the outward means; for he is the Light of the World, according to his won Testimony, and as <HI>John</HI> declared of him, <HI>He lighteth every man that come<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> unto the World, that all through him might believe, and believing rug <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ave Eternal Life.</HI> Now if he lighteth all men, then surely he lighteth as well those who have means, as those who want them, and those who want, as those who have them, as truly, tho' not as equally: And therefore seeing they who want the outward means are imme∣diately onlightned and taught, then surely they who have the out∣ward means are also; otherwise their priviledge should be less who have the outward means, and theirs the greater who want them.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How Mediately?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By the shining and breathings of his own Light and Life, in and through his faithful Servants and their Testimonies, whether by words or works; all which have a manifestation and ministration of Light and Life in them, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncrease and raise up Light and Life in them, unto whom they minister.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God and Christ minister Light and Life immediately unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en, are not all means useles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and unnecessary?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We are to distinguish betwixt things that are absolutely neces∣sary, and things that are necessary in some respect; also, betwixt things absolutely necessary, and things very useful and profitable; for many things are greatly useful, which are not absolutely necessary. And thus, tho' men have no absolute need of outward means for the conveyance of Light and Life unto them, yet the outward means are very useful and helpful unto them.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Give us an Example in another case.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> All men have a Principle of Natural Reason in them, which without all outward means (either of Men or books) teacheth them immediately some things belonging to Natural Reason; and yet none will deny but that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth Men and Boo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s are very useful and pro∣fitable to further us in the Knowledge of Natural Things, and in the
<PB N="5" REF="000604_0005_0FA95F61D65FC0B0"/>
exercise of our Natural Reason, to the further improving the same.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>But are the Immediate Teachings of God and Christ of absolute Ne∣cessity unto every Man, to give him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> true and saving knowledge of God?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yea, they are<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for indeed all outward Means could do no∣thing without the immediate teaching and ministring of God and Christ, by his holy Spirit, Light and Life; because the Imme∣diate is the Ground and Foundation, or Principle, for or because of which the outward means are useful and profitable.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Give us an Example in another case.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The same as before; for if men had not an inward and im∣mediate Principle of Natural Reason in them, that taught them immediately some things belonging to Natural Reason, all the Men and Books in the World, though never so convincing, could not gain ground upon them; but because Men have a Principle of Rea∣son in themselves, therefore when things of Reason are presented and offered to them, by Men and Books, they imbrace them and receive them, not simply or only because the Men and Books say so, but because the innate Principle of Reason in themselves saith so, and doth witness and answer to the same things.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>By this it would seem that men are taught many more things immediately, than mediately.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yea surely, for according to the aforesaid Example, what men are there (except Fools and Idiots) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the Principle of Na∣tural Reason in them, teacheth them, in the things of Natural Reason, above an hundred to one, more than any Books or Men ever did, or can do? As is manifest in the daily Occurrances and Oc∣casions in the outward Life, a man's Natural Reason teacheth him a Thousand things which he never learned from Men or Books. Even so, the Children of God are taught of God many Divine &amp; Spiritual Things, which Men nor Books never did, or could teach them.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>By all this i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seemeth, that the Knowledge of Divine and Spiritual Things, must flow from a divine and spiritual Principle in the Heart, and that they cannot be known and learned sufficiently from or by the Na∣tural Principle of Natural Reason.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is even so; for tho' the Natural Reason in a subservient way, may be made use of, yet it can no more reach unto the things that are spiritual and divine, nor indeed so much, as a blind Man by all his Reason can reach unto Colours, to judge of them distinctly or
<PB N="6" REF="000604_0006_0FA95F628B120F88"/>
a Deaf man to judge of Sounds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for even as the things of Sence are judged or known by a Principle of their own Nature, which Rea∣son cannot immediately reach unto by descending; so the things of Faith, which are divine and spiritual, are judged and known by a Principle of Faith that is of their own Nature also, to wit, divine and spiritual, which Reason cannot immediately reach unto by its ascen∣ding; but as a man, having the Natural exercise of his Senses, can use his Reason in Natural things that are sensible; so he who hath the use of his spiritual Senses, can use the same Reason in Spiritual things, to wit, in a subservient and subordinate way.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What is the first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing required of men, that they may learn of God &amp; Christ Jesus, so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to become wise through those immediate Teachings?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That they believe those Teachings, and receive them in the love of them.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How can they do that?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not of themselves, but there is a Virtue in all the Teachings of God and Christ, that is ope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and effectual to cause men to be∣lieve them and receive them, and the Truth of them in love.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What is next required of them?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That they continually apply their whole Minds, Souls and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is spiritual &amp; divine Principle in them, and unto God and Christ therein, that it may have its universal influence in them and upon them.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How can they do that?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By its own drawings, or rather by the drawings of God and Christ in it.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What is that Universal Influence?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is not only of an enlightning nature, as to give Knowledge, but it is of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ening Nature, and of a leavening, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing, puri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Nature; more particularly, it hath these two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 1. <HI>To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me and destroy sin,</HI> both in fruit and root, sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k and branch; 2. <HI>To beget Righteousness and Holiness,</HI> which com∣prehends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raits of the Spirit, such as <HI>Love, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kness, Temper∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, Pati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Joy, Peace, Hope</HI> and <HI>Confidence, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>Q. <HI>How doth it grow in Men?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By getting root in their hearts, even as a grain of Corn, by getting root in the Earth.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How doth it get root?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It hath a native Virtue and Influence in it, whereby it taketh root in the heart naturally, if men do not resist it; and though the ground where it seeketh to take root, be foul and unfit, yet it hath a cleaning and fitting Virtue in it, to prepare the ground, and make it good and fit; but it requireth mans consent and concurrence, by which it acts, and God in it, and with it draweth and moveth effectually the heart of man unto him.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>But may these drawings and movings be commonly resisted?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yea, they may, and so the work of mans Salvation may be hindered by Man himself, and that both in the beginning, or when begun in its progress.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Doth God teach men all things necessary unto Faith and Godliness ly this Principle?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yea, as he is faithfully and chastely waited upon, believed and followed.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>But hath he not his Order in teaching, or doth he teach all at once?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He hath his Order, and doth not teach all at once, but line upon line, here a little and there a little, according as a man can bear, through the growth of this Principle in them.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What are the first things he teacheth in and by this Principle?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.

<P><HI>A.</HI> Yea.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What Faith then have they, who say, inward and immediate Re∣velation is not the common Priviledge of Men, nay, not of the Saints in these dayes?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They have not the true Faith, which is the Faith of Gods Elect, that worketh by love, and puri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eth the heart, and is fruitful of good Works, but their Faith is but a Dream and Imagination, which as it findeth them in their sins, so it leaveth them to live &amp; dye in them.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What is Repentance?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is a change of the Mind, and of all the Powers of the Soul, and its Affection, from Sin and Unrighteousness, unto Holiness and Righteousness; so that whereas it loved, desired and rejoyced in sin before, and had a distaste of all Righteousness and Holiness, and an aversion &amp; alienation therefrom, now it hath a distaste of Sin univer∣sally, and an aversion and alienation from it, and a true and intimate love of all Righteousness and Holiness, desire after it, and joy there∣in, and more abundantly after and in God and Christ, whose it is.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How is this Repentance wrought?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By degrees, through the Power of God, his Life, his Love, his Judgment, his Mercy, his Goodness, revealed in his own Light by his own Spirit, as the heart is turned thereunto, and continueth in a steady and fixed application unto the same; this naturally and gently melteh and thaweth the heart, and breaketh it into pieces, yea, changeth it from a heart of stone into a heart of flesh, and mak∣eth it naturally to savour and relish the things of God, which it hated before, and to dis-relish &amp; dis-mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the things of dishonesty and Un∣righteousness, which it loved before.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What Rule (or Law) hath God given unto men, to serve, obey and worship him?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Even the same divine &amp; spiritual Principle aforesaid, the <HI>Word of God, that is nigh unto us, even in our Mouthes and in our Hearts, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay know it, believe it, and obey it:</HI> This is the Law or Rule of the New Covenant, who walk after this Rule, Peace is and shall remain upon them; neither is there any Condemnation unto them, but justification and Approbation from hence forth and forever.</P>

<P>WHereas some years ago I writ some Questions and Answers is one Sheet, chiefly directing to the Fundamental and Origi∣nal Principle of divine Knowledge, which as a sacred Key opens the door into the Treasures of divine Wisdom as well as of divine Life &amp; Virtue, my principal end and aim in that sheet being to direct the minds of Peo∣ple thereunto, and leaving the said Sheet in the hands of a Friend, after I was come away for <HI>America,</HI> my dear Friend <HI>R. B.</HI> meeting with the said Sheet, caused it to be printed, and gave it this Title, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>The Fun∣damental Truths of Christianity, &amp;c.</HI> which so soon as I saw, I was dissa∣tisfied with it, being too large, and not answering to the Book, nor to my design in writing it, and therefore with my Pen corrected it thus, <HI>Some of the Fundamental Truths of Christianity, &amp;c.</HI> and that Title I can own and stand by; or if by the Fundamental Truths of <HI>Christianity,</HI> may be allowed to be understood not <HI>all</HI> the Fundamentals, but <HI>some</HI> (neither the word <HI>all</HI> nor <HI>some</HI> being expressed in the first Impression) in that qualified sence I can own the Title as it was first given; and I am well satisfied that my said dear Friend that caused it first to be printed, most especially and principally out of his love to Truth, and next out of his love to me, was of my Mind, to wit, that the said Sheet did not con∣tain all and every one of the Fundamental Truths and Principles of <HI>Christianity</HI> in express words and matter there delivered; and this is easily and clearly enough proved out of his own Books extant in print, especially his printed <HI>Apology,</HI> where he treateth of divers other weighty Truth of <HI>Christianity,</HI> as namely, concerning <HI>Christs Death and Suffer∣ings, and the Redemption that he wrought for us thereby,</HI> without us, and the influence it hath upon us for <HI>Remission of Sin and Justification,</HI> and how it is <HI>Damnable Unbelief</HI> not to to believe what the Scripture re∣cordeth of the same, to whom it pleaseth God to reveal it, when so declared; and he saith also expresly, <HI>We believe that the Remission of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which any partake of, is only in and by virtue of that most satisfactory Sa∣crifice, and no otherwise,</HI> see pag. 94, 95, 96. And in his Vindication of his Apology, pag. 89. he saith expresly, <HI>I do believe, that the Body of our Lord Jesus Christ that was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>was again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Power of God, in which glorified Body the Lord Jesus Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:

And pag. 189. <HI>We are fals<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y charged with denying the Outward Appearance o Christ, the real existence of Heaven and His, as a place without us, The last and general Judgment, The Resurrection o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Body, for we really be∣lieve these things:</HI> And all these, I am well satisfied, were to him, as they were, and still are to me Fundamental Truths and Principles of <HI>Christianity,</HI> as they are to all faithful Friends. And though the said Title seemeth too large, as is said, especially because of some that look more at Letter than Sence, and seek to pervert and mif-con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tine the words of some, at whom they are manifestly prejudiced, yet plead more than ordinary for a more favourable construction of their own words, than Reason or any good Sence can bear; notwithstanding, to can some of the Fundamentals or first Principles of <HI>Christianity,</HI> the Fundamentals, is consistent with Scripture phrase, and therefore no wise blame-worthy in a qualified sense, as where <HI>Repentance from dead Works, Faith towards God, the Resurrection of the dead, and Eternal Judg∣ment, the Doctrine of Baptisms, and of laying on of Hands</HI> (Note, it is said, the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> but not the <HI>Practise</HI>) are called <HI>The Principles of the Doctrine of Christ,</HI> Heb.6.1. and yet who will say, that these only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣presly mentioned there, are all the Principles of Christs Doctrine, see∣ing nothing is expresly mention'd in that place of Faith in Christ, either within us or without us, nor of <HI>Justification,</HI> nor of <HI>Perfection,</HI> nor of <HI>Universal Grace,</HI> nor of the <HI>parts inward Teachings,</HI> all which, and divers others, are Fundamental Truths and Principles of <HI>Christianity,</HI> as well to faithful Friends, as to others professing <HI>Christianity,</HI> altho' they are not expresly mentioned in that place, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.1. But if any say, <HI>Though they are not expresly mentioned in that place, yet they are implyed and understand;</HI> As this is granted, so I say the same of the present Sheet of Questions and Answers, concerning Christ and the Faith of him, as he dyed for our sins, and rose again for our Justification, and is gone into Heaven, and there rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ineth our Advocate and Intercessor with the Father, and other great and Fundamental Truth and Principles, they are implyed and understood in the same, though not so clearly and distinctly expressed, it not being my intention in that Sheet to write a fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l account of all Fundamental Principals of <HI>Christanity,</HI> but to direct to one Fundamental, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the <HI>Word, Light, Grace, and Spirit of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> which being duely improved (partly immediately by it self, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y mediately &amp; instrumentally by outward preaching &amp; Books, and especially the Scriptures, or where these outward instruments and
<PB N="11" REF="000604_0011_0FA95F67D05D9B10"/>
Helps are wanting, God supplying that defect some way and manner, as his infinite Goodness and Wisdom seeth meet) doth infallibly lead all faithful Improvers of the same, as by certain degrees and steps, to eternal Happiness: And thus the sufficiency of the <HI>Word, Light, Grace</HI> and <HI>Spirit of God within,</HI> is fully asserted by me, as well at pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, as at any time formerly, ever since I came under the same Profession with the People called in scorn <HI>Quakers,</HI> and though too many go under that Profession that are not worthy to be called <HI>Christians,</HI> for their igno∣rance and Unbelief, as well as loose and scandalous Life, yet the faith∣ful and sincere of that People, as many such there are to be found, I hope, through the Grace of God, to live and dye in unity with, not∣withstanding the Lyes and false Reports of my Adversaries to the con∣trary. And whoever understandeth the <HI>Quakers</HI> Principles, so called, cannot say or think that this one Sheet containeth all the <HI>Quakers</HI> Fun∣damental Principles, and consequently nor the <HI>Christians,</HI> seeing the faithful <HI>Quakers,</HI> own themselves to be of no other Religion but sincere <HI>Christianity,</HI> there being nothing expresly mentioned of Prayer, which yet is essential, and consequently fundamental to every true Christian; nor is any thing expresly mentioned in that Sheet concerning Meetings, and the Religious Exercises therein, that ought to be performed; not concerning the Church, and the qualifications of the Members, nor concerning our universal Testimony against <HI>Swearing, paying of Tythes,</HI> and <HI>using the carnal Sword;</HI> all which are so Essential and Fundamental to the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> their Religion, together with divers other things, that they hold none to belong to their Society who differ with them in the faith and practice of these things. And by what is said, it doth easily appear, that as I did not intend that Sheet to contain a full and entire Account and Declaration of all our Principles, who are called in Scorn <HI>Quakers,</HI> so none call'd a <HI>Quaker,</HI> that doth understand the <HI>Quakers</HI> Principles aright, can think it so to do: And yet some in this place, highly laying claim to the Title of <HI>Quakers,</HI> and to be of the better sort of them too, have caused to be reprinted this my said Sheet, thinking thereby to discredit me, and make the Readers believe I have changed the Fundamental Principles of my <HI>Christianity,</HI> which, I say, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gross abuse and trick they seek to put upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, wherewithal to de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ive the ignorant and inadvertent; and while they are most inveterate Adversaries to my Person, they pretend a great kindness to my former Books, and especially to the above-mentioned Sheet, and that chiefly,
<PB N="12" REF="000604_0012_0FA95F6894CB0F20"/>
(as one hath well observed to me in a late Epistle) <HI>The Reason why they so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> esteem the said Sheet is, because there is so little of Christ crucified in it.</HI> But in this they show themselves as foolish a full of prejudice, my design in that Sheet not being to treat of the whole <HI>Body of Christian Doctrine,</HI> but to inform People where and how to find the true Key that opens the door into the Knowledge of it, and therefore I am no more bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me worthy in that respect, than he who holdeth forth a Key to a man, is to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lamed, because he doth not show him all the parts of the Building, the Door or Gate into which that Key doth open. How many good Friends have writ on particular Subjects of Religion, select∣ed and set a part intentionally by them, to treat on them only, and have but occasionally mentioned other things, and many other things not at all, as some have writ on <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ythes,</HI> some on <HI>Swearing,</HI> some on <HI>the Use of the Carnal Sword,</HI> as inconsistent with <HI>Christian Perfection,</HI> and other subjects, wherein they treat little, or perhaps nothing of <HI>Faith in Christ cruc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> doth it therefore follow, that Faith in Christ crucified, is no Fundamental Doctrine of their <HI>Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y?</HI> Surely Nay: And no more doth it follow in this preser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> case; and yet through the good Provi∣dence of God, so much is expressed in that one Sheet (tho' but occa∣sionally,) as dorn suffice to demonstrate my sincere Faith in Christ Jesus, even the Man Christ Jesus, as he came outwardly for all, though he did not come or appear outwardly unto all, as it is expresly mentioned in one of the Answers to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Questions, see pag.3. Also there are in that Sheet divers express hints, sufficient to prove that my Faith was the same then, as now, concerning Christ, when I distinguish expresly betwixt the Grace of Christ and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ist himself, as the light, warmth and influence of the Sun is to be distinguished from the Sun himself, which proceedeth from the Sun, as out of his finners, according to <HI>John,</HI>who said, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Fulness have we all received, and Grace or Grace,</HI> see pag.3. And I show expresly how Jesus Christ doth minister Light and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e unto the bouls of men, both <HI>Immediately</HI> and <HI>Mediately: Meadiately</HI> in and through his faithful Servants, and their Testimonies, whatever by Words and Works, under which I comprehend chiefly the holy Scriptures; and yet some have so gros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y perverted my words, as if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hold, that God did so teach men all things necessary unto Faith and Godliness by this Principle, as not only to exclude all outward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Scripture<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, out also the Man Christ Jesus, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in having any part or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cern in our Salvation, which is a

notorious and abusive Perversion of my words, the which one of great Note made use of against meat a late Quarterly Meeting, in the hearing of some hundreds here at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and which to my vindication and his Shame, I sufficiently answered. Also, I say expresly in that Sheet, <HI>That the Object of Faith is God and Christ inwardly revealed;</HI> &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>scribe Faith expresly thus, <HI>It is a cleaving of the Soul and Heart of Man unto God, according to the inward Revelation of his divine Power, Mercy and Goodness, in the shinings of his own divine Light, Life &amp; Spir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s within him,</HI> see pag. 7,8. The which description of Faith I still own to be sound and true, and know it so to be by blessed Experi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e. But if any think that I mean God and Christ only as within and that our Christian Faith respecteth God and Christ no where else but within us, they are miserably mistaken, and have most dark, and false, and unbe∣coming Thoughts both of God and of Christ; for tho' we can know nothing of God or Christ, but as inwardly revealed, yet that Revela∣tion doth teach us; that God and Christ is in Heaven as well as in our Hearts, yea, much more gloriously revealed in Heaven, than in our Hearts, and our Faith doth respect God and Christ in Heaven; and tho' Christ, as he is God, is where-ever the Father is, filling Heaven &amp; Earth with his Presence, yet the Body of his Manhood that was raised and is ascended, is not every where, for the Heavens have received it, and will until his Coming again and Appearance without as to judge the quick and the dead.</HI></P>

And their causing to be Reprinted that Treatise of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>en Crisps</HI> doth no more serve them, unless they will say, <HI>That to preach Faith in Christ crucified and raised again, as necessary to our Salvation, is a Doctrine of Seducing Spirits, ac∣cording to</HI> S.
