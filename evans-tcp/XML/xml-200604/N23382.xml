<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends and Fellow Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the contempt in which you are held by Mr. Burke, and men like Mr. Burke, yet, as the following publication is calculated principally for your use and enter∣tainment, I think it proper to dedicate it to you. Indeed, I suppose, that those gentlemen, who, with their aristocracy of power, titles, wealth, places, pensions, &amp;c. conceive that they possess also an aristocracy of understanding, and that you were born only for their use, will not deign to cast their eyes on so vulgar a performance. For these <HI>great</HI> men I write not; but if I can afford <HI>you</HI> any amusement or any instruction, I shall have accomplished my end.</P>
<P>It may be objected to the title of this pamphlet, that <HI>Tom Paine</HI> is no <HI>Jester</HI>—that his works con∣tain <HI>serious truths: but you,</HI> I am certain, will allow, that they contain <HI>many good things;</HI> and even his enemies (both those formerly in power, and those received into power and favour, for their opposition to his doctrines, even Mr. Burke himself) must confess, that they contain <HI>smart things;</HI> for if these <HI>gentlemen-placemen</HI> had not <HI>smarted</HI> under them, we should not have seen the long list of prosecutions which have taken place against Mr. Paine and the booksellers who sold his works. In some of these prosecutions the juries have found the books to be libels, and in others, the juries have found them not to be libels. This is what is called, in that equitable place, Westminster Hall, the <HI>glorious uncertainty of the law.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="030952_0003_0FE9FD20B192D778"/>In the following sheets I have endeavoured to keep clear of any thing that may be the cause of my being honoured with the attention of that valuable officer of the <HI>Crown,</HI> the King's Attorney-General: but in these days, when lawyers assert that truth is a libel our friend Tom Paine ob∣serves, that to say truth is a libel is a libel on truth), even this innocent performance may, by the rulers of the land, be considered as libellous, especially as it is avowedly published for your use, and not for the use of those who call themselves learned men or great men. Should it so happen, I have only to hope though hardly to expect) that I may be tried by a jury indefinitely chosen from among <HI>you,</HI> and not by a <HI>special jury</HI> of <HI>ESQUIRES,</HI> named by the <HI>Crown Office.</HI></P>
<P>It only remains for me to express a wish, that the people, as the natural sovereigns of this, as of every other country, may assert their un∣alienable right to liberty; and to assure you, that for that great end, you have every wish, and shall have every exertion of</P>

<P N="1">1. A DROLL blunder was made in the Daily Advertiser, in the month of May last. It stated, that a bill was brought into parliament, to secure the rights of <HI>potentates,</HI> instead of <HI>patentees.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The following notice was, for many months, advertised on a board, at the Surry end of West∣minster Bridge:—"<HI>Rubbish may be shot by the di∣rection of Thomas Paine.</HI>" It has been lately taken down, at the request, it is said, of a <HI>Lord of the Bedchamber.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. A gentleman (an enemy to <HI>anarchists</HI>) lately ordered a glass of brandy in a coffee house, adding, "Take care there is none of your damned <HI>French</HI> stuff in it."—The waiter replied, "<HI>Genuine Bri∣tish, Sir, I assure you.</HI>"</P>
<P N="4">4. It was observed, some time ago, in a mines∣terial newspaper, that 5000 Hanoverians were on their march, to <HI>increase</HI> the number of <HI>British</HI> troops quartered at Tournay.</P>
<P N="5">5. When Lord Howe, in the month of August last, made the best of his way into port after he had <HI>got sight</HI> of the French fleet, one of his officers,
<PB N="6" REF="030952_0005_0FE9FD2702715208"/>
not remarkably correct in his orthography, wrote to a correspondent, that he expected they would soon go to SEE again.</P>
<P N="6">6. A workman, lately dismissed from his em∣ployment at Manchester, was told at the same time, that the war was not the cause of his mis∣fortune. "Now, to me (says the man bluffly) the case appears directly contrary;—are we not at this moment employed in <HI>shooting our custom∣ers?</HI>"</P>
<P N="7">7. Some wags in Dublin lately gave informa∣tion to a magistrate, that a Mr. Scanlon had three <HI>mortars</HI> in his possession. The magistrate, attended by a party of dragoons, surrounded the house, and demanded the <HI>mortars</HI> to be delivered to him in the name of the King. Mr. Scanlon, who is a respectable apothecary, immediately produced them, adding, that as they were useless without the <HI>pestles,</HI> these were also at his Majesty's service.</P>
<P N="8">8. At a late Kent assizes, an action was brought for slander, in which an attorney was plaintiff, and an honest farmer defendant. The action was brought to recover damages, for calling the at∣torney a <HI>rogue</HI> and a <HI>thief.</HI> The verdict of the ju∣ry was, that <HI>as the plaintiff was an attorney, the action did not lie.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Soon after Mr. Dundas's late marriage, a person observed that he wondered that gentleman held so many offices, for that he imagined it would be enough for him to do the <HI>duties</HI> of the <HI>home department.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. An Irish officer had the misfortune to be dreadfully wounded in one of the battles in Ame∣rica last war. As he lay on the ground, an un∣fortunate soldier, who was near him, and was al∣lo severely wounded, made a terrible howling; when the officer exclaimed, "<HI>Damn your eyes,
<PB N="7" REF="030952_0006_0FE9FD290497CBE8"/>
what do you make such a noise for? Do you think there is nobody killed but yourself?</HI>"</P>
<P N="11">11. The First Lord of the Admiralty, out of compliment to his talents, is commonly called in the office the <HI>late</HI> Lord Chatham.</P>
<P N="12">12. In an old church history, we meet with the following curious article: "The church of Witham Friary is a small structure supported by a <HI>nave.</HI>"</P>
<P N="13">13. His Grace of Richmond being asked, why he ordered a captain's guard to mount in the kitch∣en? replied, that he wished to accustom the cap∣tains of militia to <HI>stand fire.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. Some time ago a gentleman in Devonshire thought he could not give a greater proof of his loyalty, than by employing a number of persons to burn Tom Paine in effigy. At the conclusion, one of the fellows waited on him, to know if there was any other <HI>gemman</HI> among his friends, whom he would wish to have burned, as they were ready to do it for the same quantity of beer.</P>
<P N="15">15. A royal publican in Saint George's fields advertises his house by the title of <HI>the Princess Royal's Tap.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. During the riots in 1780, several persons, in order to save their houses, wrote on their doors '<HI>no popery.</HI>' Grimaldi, the dancer, to avoid all mistakes, wrote on his, '<HI>no religion.</HI>'</P>
<P N="17">17. One of Mr. Reeves's men was lately ha∣ranguing the people, in a barn in the country, on the blessings of our constitution, our paucity of taxes, &amp;c. When an ass, who had borne many <HI>heavy burdens,</HI> in the midst of the oration, put his head in at the window and began a braying. The company seeming divided in their attention be∣tween the two orators, a wag observed, <HI>only one at a time, if you please, gentlemen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>HISTORICAL REMARKS, ANECDOTES, OBSERVATIONS, BON MOTS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P N="18">18. The oath of allegiance (says Algernon Sid∣ney) binds no private man to more than the law directs; and has no influence upon the whole bo∣dy of the nation. Many princes are known to their subjects only by the injuries, losses, and mis∣chiefs they bring upon them. Rebellion itself is neither good nor bad more than any other war; but is just or unjust, according to the manner of it.</P>
<P N="19">19. Notwithstanding the stretches that have been lately made as to libels, it is hardly credible, but it is certainly true, that a man was lately ar∣rested in Dublin as a libeller, for shewing a print of Mr. Paine to some people around him.</P>
<P N="20">20. Dragonetti, in his Treatise on Virtues and Rewards, has a paragraph worthy of being re∣corded in every country in the world:—"The science (says he) of the politician consists in fixing the true point of happiness and freedom: Those men would deserve the gratitude of ages who should discover a mode of government that con∣tained the greatest sum of individual happiness, with the least national expense."</P>
<P N="21">21. "Put a country right (says Mr. Paine), and it will soon put goverment right."</P>
<P N="22">22. "For a nation to be free (say the French) it is sufficient that she wills it."</P>
<P N="23"><PB N="9" REF="030952_0008_0FE9FD359D9CC7B0"/>23. Almost immediately after Dr. Johnson's tract, entitled <HI>Taxation no Tyranny,</HI> appeared in America, it was answered by one, called <HI>Resis∣tance no Rebellion.</HI></P>
<P N="24">24. The first time that Mr. Pitt went to Cam∣bridge after his election for the university, all the <HI>sophs</HI> were (as might be expected) gaping for <HI>lawn sleeves,</HI> and the other good things in the gift of their representative. Dr. Paley preached before the young minister, from the following text; <HI>There is a lad here, which hath five borley loaves and two small fishes, but what are they among so many?</HI></P>
<P N="25">25. Tom Paine says, truth hath this advantage over prejudice, that truth cannot be unlearned.</P>
<P N="26">26. The late Mr. Flood, once talking of the Irish pension list, said, it might be compared to <HI>death,</HI> for it was the <HI>wages of sin.</HI></P>
<P N="27">27. <HI>Parliamentary Reform.</HI>—On this subject it was mentioned that a noble lord had got the rever∣sion of a borough, at the end of twenty years. A great lord, who was present pertinently asked, "<HI>What any borough would be worth twenty years hence?</HI>"</P>
<P N="28">28. Soon after the capture of the Spanish re∣gister ship, a recruiting serjeant of marines at Man∣chester, after expatiating on the number of <HI>gal∣leons,</HI> that were taken, informed his audience, that besides the king's bounty, every two men should be provided with a <HI>large</HI> chest, having a strong partition to hold their <HI>prize money.</HI></P>
<P N="29">29. A printseller in Dublin, lately had the au∣dacity to expose for sale, a print of the —, with the following lines from Pope's Homer underneath:</P>
<L>"Curst is the man, and void of law and right,</L>
<L>"Unworthy property, unworthy light,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="030952_0009_0FE9FD926B700A78"/>"Unfit for public rule or private care,</L>
<L>"That wretch, that monster, who delights in war:</L>
<L>"Whose lust is murder, and whose horrid joy,</L>
<L>"To tear his country, and his kind destroy."</L>
<P N="30">30. Henry the Seventh, on his death-bed said, "I have left my subjects a legacy: I have left them, <HI>peace,</HI> the best legacy a prince can leave his people." <HI>Some kings</HI> might parody this speech, using the word <HI>debt</HI> instead of <HI>peace,</HI> and substi∣tuting <HI>worst</HI> for <HI>best.</HI></P>
<P N="31">31. It is an observation of a French author, that there is no example of an English minister who began a war, continuing in office till its con∣clusion.</P>
<P N="32">32. The observation of Mr. Paine, that Eng∣land has no constitution, is not new. Something very like it is contained in the following passage from the <HI>courtly</HI> Hume's History of England. "Those (says he) who, from a pretended respect to antiquity, appeal, at every turn, to an original plan of the constitution, only cover their turbulent spirit, and their private ambition, under the ap∣pearance of venerable forms; and whatever period, they pitch on for their model, they may still be carried back to a more distant period, where they will find the measures of power entirely different, and where every circumstance, by reason of the greater barbarity of the times, will still appear less worthy of imitation. Above all, a civilized na∣tion, like the English, ought to be cautious in ap∣pealing to the practice of their ancestors, or re∣garding the maxims of uncultivated ages as certain rules for her present conduct. An acquaintance with the ancient periods of their goverment is chiefly useful by instructing them to cherish their present constitution, from a comparison or con∣trast with the condition of these present times.
<PB N="11" REF="030952_0010_0FE9FD9662D04310"/>
And it is also curious, by shewing them the re∣mote, and commonly faint and disfigured origi∣nals, of the most finished and most noble insti∣tutions: and by instructing them in the great mixture of accident, which commonly concurs with a small ingredient of wisdom and foresight, in erecting the complicated fabric of the most per∣fect government."</P>
<P N="33">33. When the Duke of Clarence mentioned, in the House of Lords in the course of the debate on the Slave Trade, that the condition of the slaves in the West Indies was preferable to that of the poor people in Great Britain; it was observed, that it would be a humane action in his Highness, to bring a bill into parliament, to make the con∣dition of the poor in this country as good as that of the African slaves.</P>
<P N="34">34. A man must serve a seven years appren∣ticeship to be a <HI>shoe-maker;</HI> but all our peers, and a great proportion of our commoners, are born <HI>legislators.</HI> Nor is this all; if the shoe-maker, after all his study does not make shoes to please his customers, they will not employ him; but we are obliged to receive all the <HI>manufactures</HI> of the other profession above mentioned, be they good or bad.</P>
<P N="35">35. Those who hold up to admiration the con∣stitution of this country, on account of the trial by <HI>jury,</HI> surely do not mean a <HI>special jury.</HI></P>
<P N="36">36. <HI>Comparisons of drunkenness.</HI>—A man is said to be <HI>as drunk as an owl,</HI> when he cannot see—<HI>as drunk as a sow,</HI> when he wallows in the dirt—<HI>as drunk as a beggar,</HI> when he is very impudent—<HI>as drunk as the devil,</HI> when he is inclined to mischief —and <HI>as drunk as a lord,</HI> when <HI>he is every thing that is bad.</HI></P>
<P N="37">37. A successful resistance (says Mr. Wilkes) is a revolution, not a rebellion. Rebellion indeed, appears on the back of a flying enemy; but Revo∣lution
<PB N="12" REF="030952_0011_0FE9FD9A315E6998"/>
flames or the breast plate of the victorious warrior.</P>
<P N="38">38. The following equally wise and loyal reso∣lutions, were published in the newspapers: —
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>"Petty France, new York-Street, Westminster.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>"At a meeting of the inhabitants of the above place, it was unanimously agreed to change the name of the street from <HI>Petty-France,</HI> to <HI>York-street,</HI> to perpetuate to posterity the detestation, we, the said inhabitants, have to <HI>French</HI> princi∣ples, politics, and all things that bear an affinity with the disordered system, at present prevailing with that deluded people.</P>
<P>"And we, the said inhabitants, do agree to call it <HI>York-street</HI> to commemorate the gallantry of <HI>his Royal Highness the Duke of York,</HI> who so nobly steps forward to defeat the hostile designs of a people, whose dangerous and destructive in∣novations, have reduced millions to beggary, and threatened the liberties of this happy country.</P>
<P>"Therefore the public in general, and our friends and connexions in particular, are re∣quested to observe, that the said street, lately called <HI>Petty-France,</HI> is, by the inhabitants at large, chang'd to <HI>York-street</HI>; and it is earnestly desired of every person, having occasion to send or write to their friends residing there (as likewise the postmen) will recollect the alteration, and direct, or deliver accordingly.</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P N="39">39. A person present at the above meeting, ob∣served, that it would be better to call it <HI>Fetter∣lane.</HI></P>
<P N="40">40. A gentleman being told, that Mr. Dundas
<PB N="13" REF="030952_0012_0FE9FD9BEB7CA508"/>
had received the freedom of a certain Scotch burgh in a little gold box—observed, that their freedom might be contained in a very little box indeed.</P>
<P N="41">41. Commissary Watson fidgets about so at the mess-rooms, and makes such a thumping noise with his wooden-leg, that the young officers have given him the nick-name of <HI>dot and go on.</HI></P>
<P N="42">42. The following curious article appeared in a Treasury newspaper, in the month of May last. —"In the late engagement, Ensign Hamilton, of the 3d regiment, had a very narrow escape—a cannon ball was making directly for his head, but a serjeant, who was near him, seeing it, held up his hand, and altered the direction so much, that it only went through Mr. Hamilton's hat!!!</P>
<P N="43">43. During the <HI>Coalition Ministry,</HI> when the late Lord North held the office of one of the prin∣cipal Secretaries of State, as he was one day going to his office, in ascending the long stair that leads to it, he was obliged, being a heavy man, to rest himself at the first floor, opposite the door leading into the treasury; at last he proceeded, observing very feelingly, "<HI>Well, I see that a man may go farther and fare worse.</HI>"</P>
<P N="44">44. <HI>Seneca</HI> was a Heathen: Hear his observa∣tion on war—"<HI>Homo sacre res homo, jam per lu∣sum et jocum occiditur.</HI>"—"Man, that sacred creature man, is sent to death as a matter of plea∣sure and diversion."</P>
<P N="45">45. Notwithstanding the many severe examples made in our courts of justice, of persons, for speaking seditiously, a man had the audacity to as∣sert, in a public coffee room, that <HI>two and two made four.</HI></P>
<P N="46">46. A <HI>Friend to the Constitution</HI> was preaching up the advantages of aristocracy, and stating the justice, that a general or an admiral for his <HI>merits</HI> in conquering the enemies of his <HI>King,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="030952_0013_0FE9FDA46E8DB1B0"/>
should be ennobled, and that his honours should descend to his posterity: A lady, who was pre∣sent, observed, that by the same rule, where a man is, for his <HI>merits,</HI> exalted to the gallows, his descendants should also succeed to that honour.</P>
<P N="47">47. In the time of Mr. Wilkes's patriotism, he observed, in a speech to parliament, that, "The House of Commons meet like a consul∣tation of physicians where every one's business is to apply to his own advantage, and not to con∣sider the condition of his miserable patient."</P>
<P N="48">48. On Mr. Pitt being condemned for taking his relations into the cabinet to prevent a <HI>division,</HI> a wag observed, that an improvement on this scheme would be, to take all the offices into his own hands, as there would be still less apprehen∣sion of his <HI>dividing against himself.</HI></P>
<P N="49">49. At the quarter sessions held at Cambridge, July 18, 1793, John Cook, a baker, was tried for uttering the following seditious words: "I will always have a calf's head for dinner, on the anniversary of the <HI>martyrdom,</HI> so long as I have money to buy one; King George's head would look well served up in a dish, there would be cut and come again; and what a wonderful discovery there would be when you came to the brains! Damn the monarchy, I want none; I wish to see all the churches down, and the roads mended with them, and the King's chapel made a stable of." He was found guilty; and sentenced to be im∣prisoned three months, to pay a fine of 40<HI>s.</HI> and to find sureties for six years, himself in 100<HI>l.</HI> and two sureties in 50<HI>l.</HI> each</P>
<P N="50">50. If the Scotch Judges, instead of fourteen years transportation, had adjudged Mr. Muir to be hanged, such a sentence would not have been without precedents in their court: —</P>
<P>In the year 1600, <HI>Archibald Cornwall</HI> was in∣dicted
<PB N="15" REF="030952_0014_0FE9FDA614E75950"/>
for ignominiously dishonouring and defa∣ming his Majesty, in making a portrait of him, and laying it upon the posts of the gibbet, pressing to fix the same thereupon."</P>
<P>The Jury "convict Archibald Cornwall of the <HI>treasonable</HI> setting of his Majesty's portrait to the posts of the gibbet, and putting of the same to be hung forth on a nail infixed on the same gibbet."</P>
<P>The Court decreed him "to forfeit life, lands and goods; and to be taken to the said gibbet, whereupon he pressed to hang his Majesty's por∣trait, and there to be hanged until he be dead, and to hang thereupon for the space of twenty-four hours, with a paper on his forehead, con∣taining the vile crime committed by him."</P>
<P>In the same year <HI>Francis Tenant</HI> was indicted for writing and despersing slanderous letters, re∣proachful to the king, his progenitors and coun∣cil, and the Jury having found him guilty,</P>
<P>A <HI>royal warrant</HI> was produced by the Lord Ad∣vocate, commanding the Court to pronounce the following sentence: —"That the prisoner be ta∣ken to the cross of Edinburgh, and his tongue cut out at the root; that a paper be fixed on his brow, denoting him to be the author of <HI>wild and seditious pasquinades;</HI> and that he be then taken to a gal∣lows, and hanged till he be dead."</P>
<P>But as the king (James I.) affected clemency, a <HI>second royal warrant</HI> was produced, in which his Majesty was <HI>graciously</HI> pleased to declare, that he was content that the prisoner <HI>would only be hanged;</HI> which sentence was accordingly pro∣nounced and executed.</P>
<P>In 1615 <HI>John Fleming</HI> was hanged for uttering the following words: —"<HI>Fiend nor the King die or the morn</HI> (no matter if the King die by to mor∣row) <HI>that he die of the falling sickness.</HI>"</P>
<P>In 1618 <HI>Thomas Ross</HI> or <HI>Rois</HI> was condemned
<PB N="16" REF="030952_0015_0FE9FDA7D6212170"/>
to have first his head struck off, and then his hand and head affixed to different gates in Edinburgh, for having, at Oxford, published a devilish, scan∣dalous, and seditious writing, containing reflex∣ions <HI>on his own countrymen;</HI> asserting that they should all be put from court, excepting his Ma∣jesty (James I.) and his children and a few others, and upbraiding the English for suffering themselves to be abused by such a multitude of the off-scour∣ing of the people."</P>
<P N="51">51. The following fable, a gross <HI>libel</HI> upon that <HI>best</HI> of all possible goverments, called <HI>Monarchy,</HI> is taken from the ninth chapter of the Book of Judges: —</P>
<P>"The trees met together to choose a king; but all the trees of worth declined the office. The olive would not quit the care of its oil, the fig∣tree of its figs, the vine of its wine, nor the other trees of their fruit. Thus disappointed, they ap∣plied to the <HI>bramble,</HI> as being good for nothing. and because it bore thorns and could do mischief, The bramble, far from declining the honour of reigning over the rest of the trees, showed itself of the true blood royal, 'every inch a king,' by the following <HI>most gracions speech:</HI>—
<Q>If, in truth, (said <HI>its</HI> majesty), you anoint me king, then come and put your trust in my shadow; if not, the fire shall come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.</Q>"</P>
<P N="52">52. The following might also be considered as a libel, at this particular juncture, if it were not extracted from the <HI>Holy Bible:</HI>—</P>
<P>1 <HI>Samuel, chap.</HI> 8.—"And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king.</P>
<P>"And he said, this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he shall take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariot,
<PB N="17" REF="030952_0016_0FE9FDACA5E28450"/>
and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.</P>
<P>"And he will appoint him captains over thou∣sands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war and instruments of his chariots.</P>
<P>"And he will take your daughters to be con∣fectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.</P>
<P>"And he will take your fields, and your vine∣yards, and your olive yards, <HI>even the best of them,</HI> and give them to his servants.</P>
<P>"And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers and ser∣vants.</P>

<P N="53">53. Soon after the institution of the Royal So∣ciety, King Charles II. sent as a question to them for their discussion, "What was the reason why a dead fish was so much heavier than a living one?" Many wise treatises were accordingly written, by the members of this learned body, to point out the physical reasons for this difference. At last, after the point had undergone a complete discussion, it occurred to them to try the fact, when they dis∣covered, to their no small mortification, that they were laughed at by the witty King, the living fish and the dead one being exactly the same weight.</P>
<P N="54">54. Those who find fault with our constitution, certainly do not believe the two following max∣ims:
<PB N="18" REF="030952_0017_0FE9FDB0B43F59D8"/>
I. "That the king <HI>can do</HI> no wrong, and II. That the act of law <HI>never doth</HI> wrong."</P>
<P N="55">55. A gentleman haranguing on the perfection of our law, and that it was equally open to the poor and the rich, was answered by another, "So is the London Tavern."</P>
<P N="56">56. Dean Swift observes, "that considering how many <HI>hopeful princes</HI> we have had, it is per∣fectly astonishing, that we should have had so few <HI>tolerable kings.</HI>"</P>
<P N="57">57. A man was lately tried at Aberdeen for ob∣structing a revenue officer; it unfortunately came out on the trial, that the prisoner had been <HI>guilty</HI> of planting <HI>the Tree of Liberty,</HI> where no tree had ever grown before, and where Liberty was not in the most flourishing state. The consequence was, a judgment, that he should be publicly whipped, and banished the kingdom for fourteen years.</P>
<P N="58">58. A royal shoe-maker in Bristol lately adver∣tised, that he had the honour to be an <HI>alarmist,</HI> and requested the custom of all his Majesty's <HI>loyal Subjects;</HI> as he was resolved not to make shoes for a <HI>republican.</HI></P>
<P N="59">59. A gentleman once observed, that if he was obliged to accept a title, it would be that of <HI>knighthood,</HI> as the infamy of it would not descend on his family.</P>
<P N="60">60. A country gentleman, on hearing that se∣veral persons were punished for selling the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> protessed, that he thought no punishment too great for those, who dared to SELL <HI>the Rights of Man.</HI></P>
<P N="61">61. There is no <HI>bayonet</HI> so long as to reach <HI>opi∣nion.</HI></P>
<P N="62">62. A modern writer say, "I shall never be∣lieve that men were born for slavery, until I see <HI>kings</HI> produced with <HI>combs</HI> on their heads, like <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to strut and crow; and <HI>men</HI> with <HI>bunches</HI>

on their backs, like <HI>camels,</HI> to denote their capa∣city to carry <HI>burdens.</HI>"</P>
<P N="63">63. A countryman was lately seen loitering all the forenoon about Somerset Place; a gentle∣man asked him his business; he said he had come up from Yorkshire on purpose to see Mr. Dun∣das; that he himself, with great labour, gained £. 50 a year, and he was desirous to see a man, who, from his merits and labour, got from the nation above £. 30,000 a year. The gentleman told him, that Mr. Dundas had, for a week past, been amusing himself at his country seat at Wim∣bleton; but, says he, if you wish to see a man who gets a great deal more, and does still less than Mr. Dundas, go to St. James's, and you will see the King. The Yorkshireman answered, "The King is more than a man: he is God's vicegerent it is our duty to give him a million a-year, and it is his Majesty's duty to receive it."</P>
<P N="64">64. Mr. Forbes, in the Irish House of Com∣mons, observed, in speaking of the absentees, that he should have little objection to them as <HI>birds of passage,</HI> if they did not prove to be <HI>birds of prey.</HI></P>
<P N="65">65. It was observed by Mr. Courtney, in the House of Commons, that "the Devil was first Master General of the Ordnance."</P>
<P N="66">66. We are apt to speak of the happiness of liv∣ing under a mild government, as if it were like the happiness of living under an indulgent climate: and when we thank God for it, we rank it with the blessings of the air and of the soil; whereas, we ought to thank God for the wisdom and virtue of living under a good government: for a good government is the first of national duties.</P>

<HEAD>ENGLISH LAWS.</HEAD>
<P N="67">67. A specimen of the perfection, wisdom, consistency, equality and impartiality of the En∣glish Law.</P>
<P>"The common law is the absolute perfection of human reason; for nothing that is contrary to reason is consonant with law."</P>
<P>"The act of law never doth wrong."</P>
<BIBL><HI>COKE.</HI></BIBL>
<P N="1">I. Clergymen and peers are not punishable for crimes, for which severe punishments are in∣flicted on all others; this is the case in all felonies having what is called benefit of clergy.</P>
<P N="2">II. Persons tried for felony are not allowed a copy of the indictments against them, nor even to see the indictments. They are not permitted to have council <HI>to argue their cases,</HI> even though they should be enabled to see them; yet the most learned council are employed against them.</P>
<P N="3">III. In cases at the suit of the Crown, the ser∣vant of the Crown names special jurors.</P>
<P N="4">IV. If the crown gains, the special jurors are allowed each two guineas, if it loses, only one guinea.</P>
<P N="5">V. A man who picks my pocket of an hand∣kerchief shall be hanged; while another who takes away an innocent man's life by perjury, shall be put upon the pillory.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="21" REF="030952_0020_0FEA065582046F08"/>VI. If a man owes ten pounds, he may be im∣prisoned for life; if he makes an unnatural assault on another, he may be imprisoned for perhaps six months.</P>
<P N="7">VII. It is the same crime to murder the king, or to plunge the country in a civil war, as to coin a six-pence. To plunge the country in an unne∣cessary foreign war is no crime whatever.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. It is equally capital to set fire to a hay∣rick, and to burn a populous town.</P>
<P N="9">IX. To write a letter to a man, threatening to burn his house, is a capital crime;—to plunge a knife in another's bosom, where death does not ensue, is (except in some particular circum∣stances) a misdemeanor punishable by fine and imprisonment.</P>
<P N="10">X. To burn a house, of which the criminal is a tenant at will, is capital; but if he has a lease, it is only a misdemeanor.</P>
<P N="11">XI. To wound cattle is a capital crime—to wound a man only a misdemeanor.</P>
<P N="12">XII. A comedian who performs in a theatre-royal is a reputable person; but if the same man plays the same characters in a theatre which wants the stamp of <HI>Royalty,</HI> he is a rogue and a vaga∣bond.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. It is high treason to have a connection with the king's eldest daughter; but a man may have a dozen children by each of the other daugh∣ters of the king without committing any crime whatever.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. "Almost in every case, the law for the king is not the law for the subject," Wood's In∣stitutes, page 21.</P>
<P N="15">XV. A poor man is deprived of the means of recovering his right from a rich man, on account of the expense of the law.—For, if he should be able to borrow 40<HI>l.</HI> or 50<HI>l.</HI> to carry on his action
<PB N="22" REF="030952_0021_0FE9FDB7EFE1FEE0"/>
for 10<HI>l.</HI> due to him by his rich neighbour, and should by means of that money, procure a verdict of his country, for his debt, the rich man can, by writs of error, arrests of judgment, bills in chan∣cery, &amp;c. so harass the poor plaintiff, that he shall in the end be obliged to give up, with the loss of perhaps ten times his debt.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The expenses of an action for two pounds are the same as for two thousand.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. A <HI>gentleman</HI> of large property may hunt on the ground of a <HI>man</HI> of small property; while the <HI>man</HI> of small property may not hunt on his own ground.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. Peers and Members of Parliament cannot be arrested for debt, <HI>but their creditors may.</HI></P>
<P N="19">XIX. Peers and Members of Parliament pay no postage.</P>
<P N="20">XX. Although every person in the kingdom pays taxes, a very small proportion of the people elect representatives: yet every man is bound to obey the law, from the <HI>fiction,</HI> that it is made either by himself or his representatives.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. Every man is bound to know all the laws; although it will take fifteen guineas to pur∣chase them, and a professional education to under∣stand them.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. If a man is tried at the quarter sessions, for a petty assault, it will cost him more if he is acquitted than if he shall be convicted.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. If a man's wife is unfaithful to him, he cannot procure a divorce, unless he can afford to pay 3 or 400<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P N="24">XXIV. A man who cries up <HI>king and constitu∣tion</HI> or <HI>church and state,</HI> or burns Tom Paine in effigy, may with impunity create as great riots as he pleases; but if a person attempts to shew, by cool reasoning, that there are faults in the constitu∣tion,
<PB N="23" REF="030952_0022_0FE9FDB9913B6080"/>
he shall be imprisoned for years, and put on the pillory.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. Monopolies are established in favour of towns and rich trading companies, whereby all other persons are excluded from the natural right of exercising their labour to the best advantage.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. If a man has chosen the profession of a seaman, he may, at a minister's pleasure, be dragged from his home, his friends, his family and his country, and devoted to slavery during his life; and if he endeavours to regain his freedom, he shall be hanged.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. The law gives a man's eldest son all <HI>his</HI> estate, and leaves the rest of his children beggars.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. If, by industry, I make my land worth ten times its former value, I must pay ten times as much as I did, to the priest.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. The king pays no costs.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. The poor man is hanged for taking a loaf from a baker's shop to satisfy the cravings of nature—the baker who cheats a whole parish is fined a few shillings—and the great man, who plunders the nation of thousands, goes unpu∣nished.</P>
<P N="68">68. The following is the progressive state of the taxes of England, from the time of William the Conqueror, taken from Sir John Sinclair's History of the Revenue:—

Think, think, I say, and be persuaded you <HI>are happy,</HI> for you must pay all the Reck∣oning!</P>
<P>Again, how will you be able to resist the irre∣futable logic of <HI>Musqueiry</HI> and <HI>Artillery?</HI> or how will you be able to deny you are HAPPY, when the <HI>sword</HI> is pointed to your breast? recollect how successfully Mahomet argued this way, and be∣lieve you are happy in this world, lest they silence your murmurs, by sending you into another, to search for happiness! but alas you are a banditti of incorrigible Heretics; I know you will not believe you are <HI>happy,</HI> although the Holiest Man in Canterbury were to declare it to you on his marrow-bones!</P>
<P>But let me, for a few moments, direct your attention to the great source of all your happiness,
<PB N="35" REF="030952_0033_0FE9FDE31AFCFF20"/>
to the most <HI>glorious</HI> and <HI>happy Constitution!</HI>—Take a view of each well constructed system in each department of government; and you <HI>may</HI> be astonished at the scene thrown open before you! The whole is a Paradise of Delights!</P>
<P>Look into the STATE!—'Tis true it has <HI>corruptions</HI> and <HI>defects,</HI> as <HI>poor Edmund</HI> says, and you must peep at them with <HI>due caution</HI>—But see your <HI>Liberties</HI> defended, your property pro∣tected, by men of the most <HI>unsullied virtue.</HI> The great Treasury of the Nation, which is accumulated from <HI>your</HI> hard labour and industry, is entrusted to <HI>integrity</HI> itself; and distributed with the most scrupulous exactness, on the pure principles of the RIGHTS OF MAN. The most favourite <HI>Persioners</HI> cannot finger a guinea till he has <HI>earnt it;</HI> nor has the most exalted man in office a single <HI>shilling more</HI> than his <HI>merit</HI> entitles him to. What is £.4000 per anmum to one <HI>great man,</HI> for introducing another great man to kiss a <HI>Third Great Man's Hand?</HI>—'tis cheap as dirt. Nay it is worth half the money to see them at work!—in time of war you pay double taxes, and is it not necessary the expences of war should be defrayed?—In time of peace you also pay double taxes, to <HI>defray the expences of Peace.</HI> Ye senseless idiots! These, and such like things, <HI>constitute</HI> the chief <HI>glory</HI> of the <HI>State!!</HI></P>
<P>Look again into the Law; the scene still brighters before you! <HI>Englishmen!</HI> you have the <HI>cheapest market for Justice</HI> in the whole universe! how happily adjusted are the laws between <HI>debtor</HI> and <HI>creditor!</HI> no unnecessary delay attends the action; no anxiety of mind between the contend∣ing parties; no <HI>neglect</HI> of business; so <HI>extrava∣gant</HI> expences;—O! what a glorious purchase of <HI>parchment</HI> and <HI>stamps</HI> do you make here! with
<PB N="36" REF="030952_0034_0FE9FDE9348A4970"/>
what composure do you look forward from term to term! in the hands of Mercy and Justice, what can you fear! nothing in the final decision of the court, to ruffle your spirits, or break the repose of your family! like fat oysters ye are gently opened and separated, that the <HI>happy stuff,</HI> which lies between, may be applied to enrich the <HI>glorious Constitution.</HI></P>
<P>And now take a view of the Church! and see the angelical life of the Holy Priesthood; here is Paradise Regained!—by divine permission, here is heaven itself let down upon earth! an assemblage of all the <HI>graces</HI> and <HI>virtues</HI> which dignify and adorn human nature—how equally proportioned is the hire to the labourer! No lazy Bishops, no sinecure places, no dissipated Priests, no <HI>starving Curates</HI>—O no, no!—Justice, temperance, truth, and brotherly love, animate and pervade the whole; here is a <HI>scourge</HI> for the wickedness of men in high life, and a consolation for the miscries of the poor—here is religion taught by the <HI>best masters</HI> with able assistants, on the most <HI>reasonable terms!</HI> a little entrance money only is required; marrying, christening, confirming, visiting and burying, almost for an old song; and tithes exactly according to circumstances! Thrice <HI>happy</HI> and <HI>glorious Constitution!!!</HI> we are lost in the contemplation of thy <HI>manifold</HI> blessings.</P>
<P>Hear then, ye "SWINISH MULTI∣TUDE!" the Statesmen at Whitehall, the Judges on the Bench, all the Parish Officers in the nation, their dependants and expectants, proclaim aloud that ye are HAPPY! and who so competent to judge of your <HI>happiness?</HI> Beware of that fatal error of judging for yourselves. What! think for yourselves! O let me intreat, nay let me insist upon it, that you never think of <HI>thinking
<PB N="37" REF="030952_0035_0FE9FDEF2EF6FAD0"/>
for yourselves;</HI> for the more you <HI>think,</HI> the more you will differ from these <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>happy</HI> men in your way of thinking: Think also, how many mild, happy and glorious Constitutions have been ruined by men thinking <HI>for themselves!</HI> Let your betters, therefore, think for you; because it stands to reason, they must think <HI>best;</HI> and if the phantom should again seize your brain, and tempt you to conceive you are not <HI>happy,</HI> you must petition the <HI>happy Constitution</HI> to furnish you with some <HI>patent engines, pullies</HI> and <HI>screws,</HI> whereby you may at any time wind up your imagination to their pitch, dance to their music, and be as happy as themselves.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Tune "<HI>Derrydown, down,</HI>" &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>YE vile SWINISH herd, in the sty of taxation,</L>
<L>What would ye be after—disturbing the nation?</L>
<L>Give over your grunting—be off—to your sty!</L>
<L>Nor dare to look out, if a King passes by.</L>
<L>Get ye down, down—down, keep ye down!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Do you know what a king is? By <HI>Patrick</HI> I'll tell ye;</L>
<L>He has power in his pocket to buy you and sell you;</L>
<L>To make you his soldiers, or keep you at work;</L>
<L>To hang you, and cure you, for ham or salt pork!</L>
<L>Get ye down!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Do you think that a KING is no more than a man?</L>
<L>Ye brutish, ye swinish, irrational clan!</L>
<L>I swear by his office, his right is divine,</L>
<L>To flog you, and feed you, and treat you like swine!</L>
<L>Get ye down!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To be sure, I have said—but I spoke it abrupt—</L>
<L>That "the state is <HI>defective,</HI> and also <HI>corrupt:</HI>"</L>
<L>Yet, remember I told you with caution to peep,</L>

<L>Why, the first law of nature:—<HI>We take our own pay</HI>—</L>

I saw her JUST ABOVE THE HORISON, decorating and chearing the elevated sphere she just began to move in—glittering like the MORNING STAR! full of life and splendor, and joy. I thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge <HI>(What!)</HI> even a LOOK that threatened her with an insult!!!—But the Age of Chivalry is gone! The GLORY of Europe is extinguished forever!!!</P>
<BIBL>— BURKE on the French Revolution, page 112.</BIBL></Q>
<P>SURELY, Reader, if you possess one grain of common sense, you will say that either this passage is not quoted from BURKE'S celebrated Defence of Royalty, or that the author took leave of his senses when he wrote it.—I have looked into his book three times, that I might not mistake, and I am willing to make affidavit before our sovereign lord the king, that you may find it in page 112.</P>

<LG>
<L>Ten thousand Dons and Cavaliers</L>
<L>Around her stood with swords and spears,</L>

<L>Kings have a right divine to be</L>
<L>Your <HI>Lords,</HI> and <HI>Gods,</HI> and masters;</L>
<L>And commons, peers, and priests agree,</L>
<L>To laugh at your disasters.</L>

<L>You have a right to all the toil,</L>
<L>And while it ne'er relaxes,</L>
<L>We eat the dainties of the soil,</L>
<L>And feed you well with taxes.</L>
<L>For kings and lords, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You have a right to chain your tongue,</L>
<L>When sore you feel oppression;</L>
<L>Nor check nor call our measures wrong,</L>
<L>So wide is our commission.</L>
<L>For kings and lords, &amp;c.</L>

<PB N="68" REF="030952_0065_0FE9FCD081F2C398"/>
<L>You have a right to live and breathe,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>You have a right to wear your rags,</L>
<L>And pay your debts in limbo,</L>
<L>While we, like Judas, keep your bags,</L>
<L>And boldly after him go.</L>
<L>For kings and lords, &amp;c.</L>

<L>As spring to the fields, or as dew to the flowers.</L>
