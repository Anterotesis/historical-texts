<P>THE Great and Glorious God the Creator and Former of all things; <HI>In whom the whole Family, of Heaven and Earth is Named;</HI> Hath in In∣finite Wisdom, so Ordered and Disposed, all His Creatures, as may most Harmoniously and Eminently, tend to advance His own Glory.

And therefore hath distributed, the several Communities, Societies, and Relations, of the Children of men (as to the Government of them) in such a manner as may be every way conducible, to that Supream and Ulti∣mate end of His. Hence then it is, that as the Heavens are the Habitation of His Throne, and the Place where He is attended, with Innume∣rable Companies of Angels, which do His plea∣sure and fulfil His Commands: So <HI>He hath gi∣ven the Earth unto the Children of men.</HI> Expect∣ing and Requiring, That every one, in their several Places, Stations, Relations, and Capacities, should by <HI>Serving</HI> of Him, and sincerely <HI>Engag∣ing</HI> themselves thereunto; testify their Abso∣lute dependance <HI>on</HI> Him; Trust <HI>in</HI> Him; and Resignation of themselves, and their ALL <HI>unto</HI> Him; according to the Example of this Re∣nowned Patriot, in the words now before us; <HI>But as for me and my House we will &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This Book of which our Text is part, Des∣cribeth the Entrance of the Childen of Israel, into the Promised Land; It is intituled the Book of <HI>Joshua</HI> (as some think) because he was the Penman of it, Others judge it bears his Name, because the Principal matters handled therein, are the Acts of <HI>Joshua,</HI> The Succes∣sour of <HI>Moses;</HI> The Leader of the People; And Chief Captain of Israel; under whose Conduct, they Conquered the land, Divided it,
<PB N="3" REF="000644_0011_0FA9616ED3D01520"/>
and took possession of it; The Scope of this Book then, is particularly, to display and il∣lustrate, Gods Exact Faithfulness, in fulfiling all that he had Promised to his People; As to their Deliverance out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> Entrance <HI>into,</HI> and Residence <HI>in,</HI> the Land of <HI>Canaan;</HI> after their Toilsome, Troublesome, and Tedious March, through the Wilderness, and Conflict with ma∣ny Enemies, and Oppositions: All which is surely, A representation of the Deliverance of Sinners, from the bondage of Sin, their being outed of all self Sufficiency, and Excellency; in their Wilderness state, of Spiritual Distress; And their entrance <HI>into,</HI> and residence <HI>in,</HI> the <HI>Cana∣an</HI> of Complacency in, and Peace with God: All this being under the Powerful Conduct, of the Blessed <HI>Jesus,</HI> of whom this <HI>Joshua,</HI> was in these things a lively, Tipe and Figure; As he was also in his Name, which is De∣rived from the same Hebrew word (<HI>JASHANG</HI>) which signifies to save or make safe, and is so interpreted Respecting the Sa∣viour of the World; <HI>Matth.</HI> 1. 21.</P>
<P>This Twenty fourth <HI>Chapter</HI> Contains, the Declaration of those things, which <HI>Joshua</HI> testi∣fyed, in a way of <HI>Historical Recitation,</HI> and in a way of <HI>Vehement Exhortation,</HI> to the People immediately before his Death.</P>
<P>Particularly, In it we have (First) <HI>Joshua's Oration</HI> or <HI>Sermon,</HI> in which he Commemo∣rates,
<PB N="4" REF="000644_0012_0FA9616F8A623FB8"/>
the many Mercies they had been parta∣kers of, in their coming forth out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and since that unto this day. And this he im∣proves, as a Cogent Argument, that they should <HI>wholly,</HI> and <HI>Onely</HI> give up themselves to the <HI>Service</HI> of the Lord, with all truth and sincerity of heart. This from the 1<HI>st.</HI> to the 16. <HI>Verse.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, We have account, of the <HI>Re∣newal of Covenant</HI> betwixt God and the Peo∣ple, or a new Obligation of the People, to the Obedience of the Law; in a Solemn manner, <HI>Verse</HI> 16. to the 29.</P>
<P>Thirdly, We have account of the <HI>Death of Joshua</HI> and <HI>Eleazar</HI> the High Priest; <HI>Ver.</HI> 29. to the end of the Chapter and of the Book.</P>
<P>In this 15. <HI>v.</HI> we may note Briefly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Explicitely</HI> Propounded, A seeming <HI>Per∣mission to</HI> them, upon <HI>Supposition</HI> of an Evil Inclination <HI>in</HI> them, to depart from the Lord, to Idolatry and Superstition. <HI>And if it seem Evil unto you, to serve the Lord, Chuse you this day whom ye will serve &amp;c.</HI> Yet in this manner of speaking, there is <HI>Implicitely</HI> contained, a serious warning and solemn Dehortation, against their turning aside, from following the Lord, to the worship and service of false Gods: He desires them to the Plain, Clear, and above∣board, whom they would Chuse to serve, and worship, whether the God who had done such

(1.) The <HI>Person</HI> Engaging, and that is <HI>Joshua</HI> for himself and those under his special Charge, he doth engage <HI>for</HI> them and <HI>with</HI> them; <HI>As for Me and my house &amp;c.</HI> (2.) The <HI>Duty</HI> He Engageth unto the performance of, and that is to <HI>Serve the Lord.</HI> (3.)We have here <HI>A free</HI> and voluntary, and yet <HI>firme</HI> and stedfast <HI>Resolution,</HI> with full Consent of the <HI>Will</HI> engaged for performance thereof? <HI>We Will serve the Lord.</HI> In a word, It is an <HI>Explicite</HI> Declaration, of an <HI>inward,</HI> Pious, Resolution. Now Scripture Examples, are for our In∣struction, and the practice of this Eminent Person, thus Presented <HI>unto us,</HI> ought to be imitated <HI>by Us,</HI> and layes Obligation <HI>upon Us,</HI> to do according thereunto.</P>
<P>So that the DOCTRINE is, <HI>That it is the special Duty and Peculiar Pro∣perty, of all Religious Housholders, to bind themselves and all under their Charge; by a Firm, Solemn, and Explicite Resolution, to serve the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="000644_0014_0FA961710AAD8158"/>
In Opening this Doctrine we may Inquire (1.)How it Appears, that <HI>Joshua</HI> speaks this as an <HI>Housholder</HI> or Master of a Family, (2.)What we are to Understand here by <HI>Serving</HI> the Lord (3.)What Influence a <HI>Solemn</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cite Resolution</HI> hath, upon the Vigorous Excercise of Religion in a Family, (4.)Why it is the <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Property</HI> of a Religious Housholder thus to Resolve and Practice. And so we may Proceed to the Application.</P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>How doth it Appear, that</HI> Joshua <HI>speaks this as an Housholder or Master of a Family?</HI></P>
<P>For Answer. The <HI>Hebrew</HI> word <HI>(BETH)</HI> here rendred <HI>House,</HI> is sometimes taken liter∣ally and properly, for a dwelling House or material building, in which Persons do dwell and inhabit; so it is used, Gen. 19.4. <HI>--They beset the House round,(i.e.)</HI> the dwelling place of <HI>Lot,</HI> and his Family. This House <HI>cannot</HI> serve the Lord. But besides this <HI>Pro∣per,</HI> the word <HI>House</HI> hath many <HI>Figurative</HI> ac∣ceptations in Scripture, I shall mention onely such as tend to clear up the matter now be∣fore us; sometimes then, it is a Comprehensive Term including a <HI>whole People,</HI> Nation, or Kingdom; Thus the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> are
<PB N="7" REF="000644_0015_0FA96171DD5FA358"/>
called <HI>The House of Israel,</HI> Ezek. 3.1,4,7. <HI>A Rebellious House;</HI> Chap. 2. 5.</P>
<P>Again, Sometimes it is put for a particular <HI>Tribe,</HI> Thus the Tribe of <HI>Benjemin</HI> is called, <HI>The whole House of Benjamin,</HI> 2 Sam. 3.19. Some∣times it is taken yet more strictly, for a Particular <HI>Stock</HI> or Linage, Those of the same <HI>Race,</HI> Descending from the same Ancestors; Thus it is said I Sam. 25.3.—<HI>He was of the House of</HI> Caleb, <HI>(i. e.)</HI> of his stock or linage. But yet more directly to our present purpose, It is put for all that dwell together in a Family, Collectively considered; and for the several persons there, sustaining several Re∣lations, of Superiours, Inferiors, and Equals; Thus Gen. 7. 1. <HI>Come thou and all thy House into the Ark &amp;c.</HI> For the <HI>Salvation of this House, Noah</HI> is said to be greatly concerned; <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 7. Here in special a mans Children and natural Posterity are his House; <HI>Psal.</HI> 49. 11.—<HI>That their Houses shall continue for ever &amp;c.(i. e.)</HI> that their Children and Posterity, shall be multiplyed upon the Earth from time to time, and their Race and Linage not be cut off: Of this Houshold and Family, every Master hath a Particular care, and Charge, committed unto him by the Blessed God, the neglect whereof is a great Sin and Shame; as we read 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.8. Such a neglecter <HI>hath denyed the Faith and is worse than an Infidel.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="000644_0016_0FA96172E2964368"/>
Now <HI>Joshua</HI> was the Chief Captain, Leader, and Ruler of the whole Nation or House of <HI>Israel,</HI> as he was the successour of <HI>Moses;</HI> Hence he had inclusively the Charge of e∣very Particular Tribe, especially his own Tribe; There (more strictly) he had peculiar re∣gard to his proper Race and Linage, those of his Kindred on whom he had influence by Re∣lation, as well as Office; And in short his own Houshold and Family, were to be the imme∣diate objects, of his daily care and Govern∣ment; He therefore in our Text gives us his Resolution to Serve and Honour God, in and with his Family; by his holy Dictates and Examples: Declaring though other Tribes, Families, and Housholds, should forsake the Lord; Yet He and his Family would serve Him, with all their heart.</P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>What are we to Understand by Serving the Lord?</HI></P>
<P>For Answer. The <HI>Hebrew</HI> word (<HI>GNA∣BHAD</HI>) here used, is very Comprehensive, and is variously interpreted; being put for the Service of <HI>God,</HI> of <HI>Man,</HI> and of the <HI>Earth;</HI> That which we are concerned about, it the Service of the LORD: Hence more generally, it is oftentimes put for all Religion; <HI>Deut.</HI> 6. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Thout shalt Fear the Lord thy God and Serve
<PB N="9" REF="000644_0017_0FA9617349ACDA38"/>
Him onely.</HI> Thus it Comprehends in it, all kind of Religious Duties, which are to be attended, in a well Ordered and Holy Conver∣sation, here in the world. For this <HI>Serving</HI> the Lord is enjoyned with <HI>Fearing</HI> of Him; <HI>I Sam:</HI> 12. 24. <HI>Onely Fear the Lord and Serve Him &amp;c.</HI> Fearing the Lord implies a <HI>Gracious</HI> Principle in the Soul, serving of Him denotes the <HI>Exercise</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> manifested by a Cheerfull and Diligent attending unto all Duties which are to be performed: But of those many acceptations of this word (<HI>Serve</HI>) in Scripture, there are principally <HI>Three</HI> which do afford us Light, to the understanding the matter now before us; (1.) It is put for <HI>Worship;</HI> and so read by the Apostle, Hebr. 12. 28.—<HI>To Serve Him acceptably, with reverence and Godly fear. (i. e.)</HI> To Worship Him. (2.) It is put for <HI>Subjection</HI> to his Soveraignty; Psal. 2. 11. <HI>Serve the Lord with fear &amp;c.</HI> The words following clear it, to imply Subjection. <HI>Verse.</HI> 12. <HI>Kiss the Son, least he be Angry, and we perish in the way</HI> That is, with a Kiss of <HI>Subjection</HI> to his Authori∣ly; (3.) It is put for <HI>Obedience,</HI> to his will and Command; so the Three Children, <HI>Dan.</HI> 3. 17. <HI>The God whom we Serve (i. e.)</HI> Whom we devote our selves to <HI>Obey;</HI> both in doing His will, and Suffering His Pleasure; Thus the Apostle Explaines <HI>Service</HI> by <HI>Obedience; Rom.</HI> 6.16. <HI>His Servants ye are to whom ye Obey &amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="000644_0018_0FA961760D85FD88"/>
These things are implyed in <HI>Serving</HI> the Lord; As therefore the Expression referres to the Constant, and Conscientious performance, of all Religious Family Duties: I reserve the handling of them, to the Application as pro∣perly belonging to Practical Godlyness. And Proceed to the Third thing, to be inquired into, for Opening the Doctrine.</P>
<P><ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>Quest. 3. <HI>What influence an</HI> Explicite Reso∣lution, <HI>hath upon the Vigorous Excercise of Religion in a Family?</HI></P>
<P>This will be cleared up in Considering these things.</P>
<P>First. An Explicite Resolution denotes a <HI>Particular Choice</HI> Of, <HI>and Determination of the mind</HI> About, <HI>the thing concerning which the</HI> Re∣solution <HI>is made.</HI> Man is a cause by Coun∣sel, of his own Acts; He is a Rational A∣gent, and while he is debating in his own mind, Comparing one thing with another, and Endeavouring to satisfy his Understand∣ing, which is most Eligible, and Advantagious; This or that: His mind hangs in suspense, and is like the <HI>beam</HI> of the <HI>ballances</HI> on an <HI>even poize.</HI> But when Judgment pitcheth on one thing as an Object, much to be preferred to the
<PB N="11" REF="000644_0019_0FA9617717E4C2A0"/>
other, the Choice is made; the Scale is turn∣ed; and a firm Resolution puts the matter out of Doubt; and makes appear to every one, the man accounts That, the most <HI>Accepta∣ble</HI> and <HI>Excellent</HI> Object, utterly contemning whatsoever stands any way in Competition therewith. Thus <HI>Joshua,</HI> in our Text and Context, declareth his fixed Resolution, and unalterable fixation, by an acquiescing of his Soul on God, and devoting himself to His Service, as the most suitable and adoequate Object of Choice; rejecting and contemning all other Gods;—<HI>Chuse you this day whom you will Serve</HI>—But <HI>As for me and my House we will Serve the Lord;</HI> Now the firmness of this Resolution, it grounded on the <HI>Eminen∣cy,</HI> of the Properties of this Act of Choos∣ing. (1.) It is a <HI>Free Act</HI> being the very Elicite Act of the will; hence where there is not an absolute freedom of will in the sub∣ject chusing, there cannot be a choice made, of <HI>This</HI> more than of another object. (2.) It is a <HI>Deliberate Act;</HI> When the judgment is called in, to cast the Scale and deterimne the matter; Thus <HI>Joshua</HI> here signifies, he had weighed the matter in the ballance of sound judgment, and found that the Service of the LORD, out weighed all other Service whatsoever. (3.) It is <HI>an Act that puts Respect, Preference, and Preheminence, upon the thing chosen;

above all other things;</HI> So here in the Text, (<HI>q. d.</HI>) <HI>Chuse you whom you will,</HI> to Serve and Worship, whom you will value and Esteem, as the supreme Object, of Divine Honour and Adoration; for my part, I am fully satisfied, there is none like unto the LORD the God of Heaven, <HI>Neither is there any</HI> other god <HI>to be Compared with Him;</HI> Isa. 46. 50.</P>
<P>Secondly. An Explicite Resolution, <HI>layes a Person under special Awe of GOD, in the things concerning which the Resolution is made.</HI> These Resolutions are Covenant Transactions with God, and Obligations of Soul to Him. Now to transact with the Infinitely Holy GOD, in a way of Covenant, is a very Awful thing; Yea it cannot be done, without the greatest care imaginable, to comply with out Engage∣ments. Thus <HI>Joshua</HI> Endeavours to possess the minds and Souls of the People, with the Solemnity of their binding themselves by Co∣venant to Serve the Lord; and Him onely, as in the 19. <HI>Verse</HI> of this Chap, <HI>Ye cannot Serve the Lord your God, for He is an Holy God, He is a Jealous God, He will not forgive your Ini∣quity and your Sin &amp;c. (i. e.)</HI> Ye Cannot, unless you are Resolved in your minds, by the help of His Grace, to cleave close to Him, with all sincerity of heart, so: if you are deceit∣ful in <HI>Making,</HI> or negligent in <HI>Keeping,</HI> your
<PB N="13" REF="000644_0021_0FA961788A9D4900"/>
Covenant with God; He will <HI>Return and do you Hurt, after that He hath done you Good;</HI> Verse. 20. So Solemn is the Obligation of an <HI>Explicite Resolution,</HI> in this great Duty of <HI>Serving</HI> the Lord.</P>
<P>Thirdly. An Explicite Resolution, <HI>will in its own</HI> Nature, <HI>produce those Effects, which may prevent a Persons neglecting or delaying, the things about which he is Resolved.</HI> This Ar∣gument <HI>Jephtha</HI> used, to his Daughter; <HI>Jud.</HI> 11. 35. <HI>I have opened my mouth to the Lord, and I cannot go back.</HI> He had not onely thought in his heart, but spoken with his mouth, and thereby <HI>Explicitely</HI> engaged him∣self in the matter; This made <HI>David,</HI> take special care of performing his Vows; Be∣cause; <HI>His Lips had uttered them, and his Mouth had spoken, when he was in distress. Psal.</HI> 66. 14.</P>
<P>Particularly; these Effects are,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Diligent Attending unto these means,</HI> which tend directly to promote, that unto which a person is resolved. Such a Resolu∣tion is a <HI>General</HI> Obligation, under which all <HI>Particular</HI> Duties, are comprehended.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Stedfast Withstanding, and careful Avoid∣ing, whatsoever might hinder our Complying with
<PB N="14" REF="000644_0022_0FA9617948CDFF70"/>
our Resolution.</HI> So soon as any Person comes up to a firme Resolution, in a matter of such importance, there are many Enemies and Oppositions step into the way to hinder their Compliance with it, and if Possible to make them break and violate it. I shall mention three.</P>
<P>First. <HI>Satan;</HI> He Endeavours, all he can to divert us <HI>From,</HI> or interrupt us <HI>In,</HI> our O∣bedience; But a resolved Soul Answers the Temptation, with Detestation, <HI>Get thee behind me Satan,</HI> I am Resolved to Serve the Lord, and will not (Divine Grace Assisting) be diverted, from my stedfast Obedience to Him; or betrayed by any of thy <HI>Power</HI> or <HI>Policy,</HI> to the Service of any false God whatsoever.</P>
<P>Secondly. <HI>Corruption within;</HI> Such is the Property of that Corrupt Principle, that is in every one by nature, that so soon as any Check is given to its motions and Ope∣rations, immediately it swells, strives, and struggles; appears in its Colours, looks like it self, and becomes <HI>Exceeding Sin ul;</HI> Rom. 7. 8. Now Holy and <HI>Solemn</HI> Resolutions, and Covenants, are as Dammes to stop the Tide, and Obstruct the Course of Sin; And when firmely, and Regularly made, they cannot readi∣ly be over-born, no not by the Rapid torrent of Original Concupiscence: Because the Lord
<PB N="15" REF="000644_0023_0FA9617A0D31AB98"/>
Himself will Assist unto the fulfilling of them.</P>
<P>Thirdly. <HI>Carnal and Sensual Objects;</HI> Or, <HI>Worldly things;</HI> are ready to ensnare and intangle us. The <HI>World</HI> is an Enemy to a Christians Holiness, and thence Opposeth all things tending thereunto: So that unless our Resolutions be well fixed, the Whisperings of this business; and Emergency of the other affair; will Obstruct the course of our Obe∣dience. Worldly things, will be as so many Snares and Traps, to intangle us, unless we can chase them away, with like <HI>Holy Zeal</HI> as the Psalmist did his <HI>wicked Enemies Psal.</HI> 119. 115. <HI>Depart from me ye Evil doers; for I</HI> Will <HI>keep the Commandments of my God. (i. e.)</HI> I will maintain my stedfastness of holy Resolution, and not let go my Integrity, so long as e∣ver I live.</P>
<P>Fourthly and Lastly. Explicite Resolutions, <HI>have influence upon others, As <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> render those about us inexcuseable,</HI> who do not take Exam∣ple by them, and Endeavour to Practice accor∣dingly. This is implyed in this Text, <HI>Chuse you this day whom you will serve &amp;c. (q.d.)</HI> But if you do not choose to serve the Lord, be Assured I shall by my Practice Condemn you; and bear Testimony against you; for I am come to a point in the matter, <HI>I and my House &amp;c.</HI> Thus
<PB N="16" REF="000644_0024_0FA9617AC97280B8"/>
<HI>Noah</HI> and his Family, where God was Served, and his Worship Celebrated, <HI>Condemned the</HI> Old <HI>World,</HI> Heb. 11. 7. Thus <HI>Lot</HI> and his Family, <HI>Condemned</HI> Sodom, and Gomorrah; 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 6,7. Yea a Particular <HI>Godly Family,</HI> in the midst of a Sinful, and Degenerous People, doth <HI>Con∣demn their Neighbours;</HI> for not Serving the Lord. And the <HI>Master</HI> of a Family, who is Conscientious in his Duty; will <HI>Condemn</HI> all un∣der his Charge, if they do not joyn with him in serving the Lord, with full <HI>Purpose</HI> of heart, and <HI>Resolution</HI> of Soul.</P>
<P>The REASONS of the Doctrine are.</P>
<P><HI>REASON.</HI> I. Because <HI>Our Service doth in all Respects, and by special Right belong unto God.</HI> He hath a Soveraign Right unto Us, and Ours, and all that <HI>We</HI> and <HI>They</HI> have and are: And that on these accounts.</P>
<P>First. <HI>He is our Creator by His Power.</HI> Thus we read; Gen: I. 26,27. <HI>God Created man &amp;c. (i.e.)</HI> the first man, and all mankind in him: Now he that made us; may by right of Sover∣aingty, challeng all that we <HI>Have, Are,</HI> and <HI>Can do;</HI> for his Service and Glory. He hath given us being, and in the making of us, hath <HI>Power as the Potter over the clay,</HI> (Jer. 18. 6.) and therefore, may justly Require our
<PB N="17" REF="000644_0025_0FA9617BB48D1C18"/>
utmost Service and Obedience, by this Ar∣gument, the Psalmist moveth Himself and others, to humble and Holy Adoration; Psal. 95. 6.—<HI>Let us Worship and fall down and Kneel before the Lord Our Maker.</HI> On this Account also; he Presseth the most Triumphant and Elevated Praises, to be Offer∣ed unto the Lord; Psal.100.1,2,3. <HI>Know that the Lord He is God, He hath made us and not We our selves &amp;c.</HI> Now <HI>Prayers,</HI> and <HI>Praises,</HI> are duties of <HI>Natural Worship,</HI> which we owe unto God as our Creator, and are Constantly to be attended, in the Exercise of Religion in Families.</P>
<P>Secondly. <HI>He is Our Preserver, by His Providence.</HI> As he did at first gives us our Beings, so he upholds us in our beings: Our Lives; Motions, and Actions, are continually Dependent upon His Influence; Acts. 17. 28. <HI>In Him we Live, and Move, and have our Being.</HI> Now this Providence is over us, in Two Res∣pects. (1.) <HI>In Providing for us,</HI> all that is Necessary; to the maintaining both our Bodys, and Souls in Life. Hence we read, That He hath <HI>According to his Divine Power, given unto us, all things which pertain to Life and Godlyness;</HI> 2. Per. 1, 3. It is from this Liberal Hand of Divine Bounty, that Common Favours are Pro∣miscuously dispensed, to Good and Bad; <HI>Mat.</HI> 5. 45.
<PB N="18" REF="000644_0026_0FA9617C496983F0"/>
—<HI>Maketh His Sun to Rise, on the Evil and on the Good, and sendeth Rain, on the Just &amp; on the Unjust.</HI> Thus <HI>Jacob</HI> acknowledged, the Lord to have been his <HI>Feeder, all his Life long;</HI> Gen. 48. 15. (2.) <HI>In Protecting of us</HI> from Injuries. We are every Day, every Night, yea every Hour, exposed unto Various Dangers, and Casualties; Wrongs and Injuries; form which the Lord doth <HI>Preserve</HI> and <HI>Deliver</HI> us, He then, that is our Defender, may well chal∣lenge our Service at all times; Now it is the Lords Peculiar Property, to Defend us <HI>from ALL Evil; To Preserve our Goings out, and our Comings in from hence forth and for ever.</HI> Psal 121. 7,8. Hence without His Protection, we cannot be safe; <HI>Except the LORD Keep the City, the Watchman waketh in vain.</HI> Psal. 121.1. On this account, the People of God apply themselves to Him, under such Metaphors and Titles, as denote the greatest Security, Protection, and Defence; Thus <HI>David, I Love Thee O Lord my Strength, my Rock—Fortress, Deliverer,—Buckler, Horn of Salvation, and High Tower,</HI> Psal. 18. 1,2. <HI>(i. e.)</HI> A Suitable and Sufficient Defence, at all Times and on all Oc∣casions; Hereby then are we strongly oblidg∣ed, to <HI>Love, Fear,</HI> and <HI>Serve</HI> Him.</P>
<P>Thirdly. <HI>He is our Rewarder;</HI> and There∣fore may Challenge our Service. Thus He is
<PB N="19" REF="000644_0027_0FA9617F21165258"/>
Propounded, in the Gospel as the Adaequate Object of our Faith; Heb. 11. 6. <HI>He that cometh unto God must Relieve that He is; and that He is a</HI> Rewarder <HI>of all them that Diligently seek Him;</HI> His Faithfulness, is engaged by His Pro∣mise, to Reward those that Serve Him. And the Apostle assures us, Heb. 6. 10. <HI>God is not Unrighteous, that He should Forget our Work and Labour of Love, &amp;c.</HI> Yea so Faithful is He that hath Promised, in this Respect, that even the <HI>Smallest Service,</HI> shall not pass unrewarded. As our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, hath Affirm∣ed to us. Matt. 10. 42. <HI>Whosoever shall give to Drink unto one of these Little ones, a Cup of cold Wa∣ter; in the Name of a Disciple; Verily I say unto you, He shall in no wise loose his Reward.</HI> There∣fore as the LORD is our <HI>Creator, Preserver,</HI> and <HI>Rewarder,</HI> our Service must needs of Right be∣long unto Him.</P>
<P><HI>REASON. II.</HI> Because <HI>the Lord doth Expect, Command, and Require, Our Service, Worship, and Obedience.</HI> I need not insist long here. It is plain, that the Maine End and Design of God is; by all the Precepts of the Scriptures, to <HI>Oblige</HI> us; by the Precedents, To <HI>Encourage</HI> us; by the Promises To <HI>Allure</HI> us unto his Service; and by the Threatnings, To <HI>Deterre</HI> us from the neglect thereof. Thus the Pro∣phet Summs up the People's Duty, in two
<PB N="20" REF="000644_0028_0FA96180B0F1D8A0"/>
Words; I Sam. 12.24. <HI>Onely Fear the Lord, and Serve Him in Truth; &amp;c. David</HI> also, Declares, it to be the Lord's <HI>Command,</HI> that we should <HI>Keep His Precepts Diligently.</HI> Psal. 119.4.</P>
<P><HI>REASON. III.</HI> As it is the <HI>Duty,</HI> so it is the <HI>Property,</HI> of the Religious Housholder thus to do; Appears <HI>From the Tendency of Grace, in such as do themselves sincerely Serve the Lord.</HI> The Grace of God is of a Diffusive, and Com∣municative Nature; Compared therefore by our Saviour to Leaven, <HI>a little</HI> whereof will <HI>Leaven the whole Lump,</HI> and Over-spread by is influence <HI>the three Measures of Meal,</HI> in which it is hidden; Matt.13.33. So <HI>So Grace</HI> will sea∣son and Sanctify the whole man, in <HI>Body, Soul,</HI> and <HI>Spirit:</HI> And having obtained Dominion over <HI>That Man,</HI> proceedeth to the <HI> Next, </HI> and Extendeth its Efficacy, to the Sanctification of <HI>Others,</HI> so far as may be. Hence the true Dis∣ciples of the Lord Jesus, are said to be <HI>the Salt of the Earth;</HI> Matt. 5. 13. <HI>Salt</HI> to prevent Pu∣trefaction; <HI>Salt</HI> to di<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use a <HI>Savoury Relish</HI> to those with whom they Converse. Again Saints are <HI>Lights of the World;</HI> Matt. 5.14. <HI>Lights</HI> for their own Lustre, and Brightness of Holy Con∣versation; As also to give Guidance and Di∣rection, to others with whom they Converse. Thus the Religions Housholder, is willing to bring as many others as possible he can, to Serve the
<PB N="21" REF="000644_0029_0FA961822054DB00"/>
<HI>LORD;</HI> Endeavouring to have his Family like that of the Devout Cornelius; <HI>Who Feared God with All his House, &amp;c.</HI> It is a special token of Sincerity, to Endeavour to the ut∣most of our Capacity, the Good and Salvation of others: and to be grieved, when we cannot prevaile upon them; hence David, Psal. 119. 136. <HI>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes; Because men keep not thy Law.</HI> So if we would approve our selves, to have a Principle of <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Holiness</HI> in us, we should mourn over the Sins of others, which we cannot prevent. Thus shall we come to be Known, <HI>(i. e.)</HI> Acknowledged, and Accepted of God, as <HI>Abraham</HI> was; Gen. 18. 19. <HI>For I Know him, that he will Command his Children and he Houshold, &amp;c.</HI> This will be matter of Com∣fort to us now, and Rejoiceing in the Day of the Lord.</P>
<P>For <HI>APPLICATION</HI> of this Doctrine to our selves.</P>
<P>There are three Uses to be insisted upon <HI>(First)</HI> Of <HI>Exhortation</HI> and <HI>Direction;</HI> how it may be so with us in our Families. <HI>(Secondly)</HI> OF <HI>Lamentation,</HI> because it is not so. <HI>(Thirdly)</HI> Of <HI>Caution</HI> against these things, which do Oftentimes hinder it from being so.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="application">

<HEAD>USE. I.</HEAD>
<P>Let it be for <HI>EXHORTATION to all Housholders now before the Lord;</HI> I call upon you, and Solemnly Exhort you in the Name and Fear of God, <HI>To Write after this Fair Cop∣py, and to follow this Eminent Leader the Godly JOSHUA</HI> Who seems to speak, to all in that Capacity here present, in the Words of <HI>Gideon; Judg.</HI> 7.17. <HI>Look on me—and as I Do so shall Ye Do.</HI> <ABBR>Viz.</ABBR> Bind your selves, and all under your Charge, in a <HI>Firm</HI> and <HI>Explicite</HI> Resolution to Serve the Lord; with Singleness and Upright∣ness of heart. Now for the Pressing this Duty, I shall here insert those Directions, under which this, Duty may be fully Opened, sub∣joyning those Motives which may be the Help of the Spirit of God, Awaken, and En∣courage, unto the Conscientious Practice there∣of. This being referred hither as the most probable Method; (If the Lord please) By which to inform the Judgment, and Excite the Affections together.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="direction">
<HEAD>DIRECTION. I.</HEAD>
<P>Let us make it Our Constant Care, and Di∣ligent Endeavour, to <HI>Live in the Constant and Conscientious Practice, of all manner of Christian∣Family-Duties</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="000644_0031_0FA9618319B29148"/>
Incumbent on the Heads of Fa∣milies. Now those Relative Duties which con∣cern the several Persons in Families, are to be reduced to Three heads. (1.) The Duties of <HI>Superiours,</HI> to <HI>Inferiours.</HI> (2.) Of <HI>Inferiours,</HI> to <HI>Su∣periours.</HI> (3.) Of <HI>Equals,</HI> one towards another. Those which we are now Concerned to Enquire into, are the Duties of Superiours to Inferi∣ours; for the maintaining a Constant course of Religions Service to God in Families; which belongs unto Practical Godliness, and consists in daily Excercise of these things. The People are wont oftentimes to say unto the Preachers; The Life of <HI>Doctrine</HI> lyes in <HI>Application;</HI> surely the Preachers may as truly and Properly An∣swer them, The Life of <HI>Application</HI> lyes in <HI>Practice.</HI> Especially in these Important Duties, of such Universal Concernment.</P>
<P>The Duties are,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Reading the Scriptures, daily in the Family.</HI> A Duty too too much neglected (I fear) even amongst Professors. The Scriptures are the Words of the <HI>Eternal God;</HI> Containing the Words of <HI>Eternal Life;</HI> Written by men <HI>Inspired</HI> by the <HI>Holy Ghost;</HI> 2 Pet. 1. <HI>ult.</HI> Now <HI>What is written is written for our Learning; &amp;c.</HI> Rom. 15. 4. Therefore surely for our <HI>Reading,</HI> without which we are not Capable to Learn. It is Recorded in Commendation of <HI>Timothy</HI> 2 Tim. 3.15. <HI>That from a Child, thou hast Known the Holy Scriptures &amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="000644_0032_0FA96183CCAF2D58"/>
Surely the way to know them, so as to grow Wiser unto Salvation, is to Read them. Once more, It is Required of the King; Deut. 17.19. <HI>That he should Read in the Book of the Law, all the Dayes of his Life.</HI> If the King is to Read daily in the Book of the <HI>Law,</HI> then surely Professors of the Name of Christ ought to Read in the Books of the <HI>Gospel</HI> every day; As proper means, to prepare them <HI>For,</HI> and quicken them <HI>To,</HI> o∣ther Duties of <HI>Family-Worship.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Follow this with <HI>Family prayer,</HI> This is a Duty belonging to <HI>Natural Worship,</HI> and there∣fore binds all Persons, at all Times; As the A∣postle Exhorteth, Eph. 6.18. <HI>Praying Alwayes, with All Prayer and Supplication, &amp;c.</HI> Of which <HI>Family Prayer</HI> is one kind, and is necessary, both for the <HI>Example,</HI> and <HI>Encouragment,</HI> of those that are under our charge. This is brought in, as a special evidence of <HI>Cornelius's</HI> Devoutness, in the <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Service</HI> of the Lord, with all his House, <HI>He Prayed Alwayes,</HI> Act. 10. 2. Besides <HI>Prayer</HI> is a <HI>Necessary duty,</HI> Pertaining to a Christians Walk, when he walks like himself; Surely then <HI>David</HI> did not walk in his House or Family, with a Perfect heart, but that he Prayed for them and with them; as <HI>Psal.</HI> 101.2. There is indeed, a Praying for our Children and Servants, in <HI>Secret;</HI> which is the Duty of all sincere Christians: An earnest Plying the Throne of
<PB N="25" REF="000644_0033_0FA96184C9B8EC10"/>
Grace, As <HI>Abraham</HI> did, Gen. 17. 18. <HI>O that</HI> Ishmael <HI>might Love before Thee.</HI> So should we, particularly Recommend our Children to the Mercy of God, in our <HI>Secret Addresses</HI> every day; But that <HI>They</HI> may be <HI>Assured,</HI> that we pray <HI>For Them,</HI> and may also be <HI>Encouraged</HI> to do the like, if they shall Live to come into the same Capa∣city of Family-Government, we ought Con∣scientiously, to attend Family-Prayer <HI>With Them</HI> every day. And that We and our Families may find acceptation, with the Lord in our <HI>Daily-<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-Supplications,</HI> Let us Carefully <HI>Watch</HI> against Two things; (1.) <HI>Coldness,</HI> and <HI>Formality.</HI> This is a Frame we are in great danger to fall into; Frequency in Prayer, if we are not very careful, will abate the Fervency of our atten∣dance therein; Let us not be Slothful, Cold, or Formal, in this Business; but Fervent in Spirit, <HI>&amp;c. Rom.</HI> 12.11. Serving that <HI>GOD</HI> who <HI>is a SPI∣RIT,</HI> with our <HI>Spirits;</HI> John 4.24. Finding in our <HI>Heart, to Pray</HI> our Prayer as <HI>David;</HI> 2 Sam. 7.27. <HI>And Pouring out our Soul before the Lord,</HI> as Hannah <HI>I Sam.</HI> 1 15. Otherwise we cannot Expect, to obtaine any Mercy at the Hand of God, for our Selves or Ours. The Apostle <HI>James</HI> informs us, That such a man as is <HI>Faint, Weak,</HI> Doubting, <HI>Cannot Expect to Re∣ceive any thing of the Lord;</HI> Jam. 1.6. Surely we all find by woful Experience, how much we stand in need of such a <HI>Watch Word</HI> as this.
<PB N="26" REF="000644_0034_0FA961858C221440"/>
(2.) Let us Watch against <HI>Distractions in Fa∣mily Duties.</HI> Many Occasions will Intrude upon us, to Distract our minds, and abate the Intens∣ness of our Souls in these Duties. Let us do our Utmost, so to Order and Compose every <HI>Business,</HI> and to Govern every <HI>Person,</HI> in their several Capacities, that there may be no distraction but what is purely Accidental; but as much as possible we may <HI>Attend upon the Lord,</HI> in Family-Prayer <HI>Without Distraction;</HI> I Cor. 7.35. Remembring we are in the <HI>Presence of GOD,</HI> who cannot Endure to behold Iniquity; About things of <HI>Everlasting Concernment,</HI> that our Hearts and Souls, may be Engaged in the Duty; and we may do it with <HI>ALL</HI> our <HI>Might;</HI> Distractions in Duties are very Evil things, and we are never more in Danger to be <HI>Pestered</HI> with them, than in Family Prayer; Let us do by them as <HI>Abraham</HI> did by the <HI>Birds,</HI> that annoyed his <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> Gen 15. 11. Use our utmost Endeavour, by the Assistance of the Spirit of God, to <HI>Drive them away.</HI> Heartily grieving, for what we cannot pre∣vent.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let us Carefully Attend <HI>Catechising of Our Families.</HI> This is a Duty of Great Concern∣ment, for the bringing Young ones, to a Sound and Methodical knowledge of God, Christ, and the Way of Salvation. Indeed the <HI>Word</HI> is not Expresly set down in Scripture, yet in
<PB N="27" REF="000644_0035_0FA961866637D810"/>
many places, we find the <HI>Thing</HI> intended there∣by; Particularly, Gal.6.6. <HI>Let him that is Taught in the Word Communicate &amp;c.</HI> The Greek word <HI>(CATECHOUMENOS)</HI> there used, for <HI>Him that is Taught</HI> gives us the derivation of the Name, and the true Notion of the thing. For it is <HI>an Orderly and Methodical Instructing, Per∣sons in the Great Doctrine of Godliness,</HI> Or the <HI>Fundamental Points</HI> of Religion <HI>Necessary unto Sal∣vation.</HI> Hence, It comprehends under it, both the <HI>Credenda,</HI> and <HI>Agenda, (i. e.) Truths</HI> to be believed, and <HI>Duties</HI> to be performed. By this means Persons well Catechised, will Attain unto, and Retain, the <HI>form of sound Words,</HI> or Summary of Christian Religion, according to the Apostles Exhortation, 2 Tim. 1.13. <HI>Hold∣fast the Form of</HI> Sound Words, <HI>which thou hast heard of me, &amp;c. (i. e.)</HI> in which he had In∣structed or Cathechized him. We are Com∣manded, to Trent frequently, and Familiarly, with out Children; <HI>&amp;c;</HI> about the great things, of their Salvation, <HI>Deut.</HI> 6.6,7. <HI>Thou shalt Talk of them, as thou <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> House, and when thou Walkest by the way, and when thou Lyest down and when thou <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Now Catechizing, is an Apposite, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and Compendious way, to Insinuate and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Divine things; The want whereof, makes so many grown persons, confused in their Knowledge, even of the Im∣portant Doctrines of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> As
<PB N="28" REF="000644_0036_0FA9618710797BC8"/>
also of the Glorious Mysteries of the Mediato∣rial Office of our Lord Jesus Christ; <ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR> His <HI>Incarnation, Humiliation,</HI> and <HI>Exaltation,</HI> with the Benefits redounding there from, Represented to us in Symbols and Sacraments Let this Duty then, be constantly attended by us, at certaine times every Week, so shall we find our Children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To grow in <HI>Knowledge,</HI> as they grow in Years; and may have ground to hope, that by the help of the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, they shall also grow in <HI>Grace.</HI> I humbly Recommend, For Grown Persons, The <HI>Assemblies Catechism,</HI> for young Children Dr. <HI>Owens, Primer Catechism,</HI> and for bringing them to a Familiarity, with the Words of the Sacred Text; the <HI>Scriptural Catechism,</HI> lately set forth by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Cotton Mather,</HI> is of Excellent use.</P>
<P N="4">4. A Fourth Duty, is <HI>Reproof Of, and bear∣ing full testimony Against, whatsoever we find in these of our</HI> Families, <HI>Contrary to God and God∣liness.</HI> Now Reproof is the Orderly Applicati∣on, of the Rule of God to them, to Convince then wherein they have Transgressed it, and to bear Testimony against the Delinquence.

too much Indulgence; <HI>Verse</HI> 23,24,25; And <HI>Chap.</HI> 3.13. We have Gods Testimony against his neglect, upon that account; Because <HI>his Sons made themselves</HI> Vile, <HI>and he Restrained them not.</HI> The word in the <HI>Hebrew (CAHAH)</HI> signi∣fies to bend the <HI>Browes,</HI> and wrinkle the <HI>Fore∣bead</HI> with anger; He did not severely <HI>Brow∣beat</HI> them fully testifying, against the Evil of their Wayes, and Heinousness of their Sin in the Sight of God. <HI>(i. e.)</HI> By Severely <HI>Chid∣ing</HI> them as he was a <HI>FATHER,</HI> Deposing them as he was <HI>High-Priest,</HI> and Punishing them Cor∣porally as he was a <HI>Judge.</HI> So <HI>Diodat, Ann<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, Belg, Piso.</HI></P>
<P>And we must alwayes, Remember, that over∣much Mildness in Reprooving, reflects the guilt of the Transgression, upon the Reproover; When therefore any in our Families, Sin <HI>Greatly,</HI> and Heinotsly, Let us Reproove them <HI>Sharply, and Effectually.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5<HI>ly.</HI> And Lastly. When other means failes, and we find an Obstinate Persisting in Evil Practices, <HI>We must add Correction to all the Rest.</HI> This is the Last Remedy, and though it is <HI>Rough</HI> and <HI>Unpleasant,</HI> yet it is sometimes <HI>Ne∣cessary,</HI> and <HI>Profitable.</HI> Thus the Wise man gives a Rule, Prov. 19. 18. <HI>Chasten thy Sin while there is Hope, and let not thy Soul spare for his Crying.</HI> Indeed it must be acknowledged, That as strong Working Physick, must be <HI>Skilfully Corrected;</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="000644_0038_0FA9618A715E7938"/>
So Chastisements must be very <HI>Prudently. Mana∣ged,</HI> by the Sober and Religious Housholder, who is to dispense them, according to the <HI>Age, Temper, Inclination,</HI> and <HI>Disposition,</HI> of the Offender; whether it be Child or Servant. As also with due regard to the <HI>Quality,</HI> Circumstances, and Aggravations, of the <HI>Offence,</HI> for which it is Administred.</P>
<P>Now although in Performing these <HI>Fami∣ly-Duties,</HI> all Persons in their Particular Stations are concerned, <HI>Superiours,</HI> to Injoyne and Practice them; <HI>Inferiours,</HI> to Attend on them, and Submit unto them; And <HI>Equals</HI> to Excite one another thereunto: Yet the main Stress of all, lyes on the <HI>Master,</HI> or <HI>Head</HI> of the Fami∣ly, as will Appear if we Consider Three things;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Master of the Family,</HI> is as it were <HI>the SOUL of the Family.</HI> He is the Correlate, of every Relation there, <ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR> The <HI>Husband,</HI> or the <HI>Wife;</HI> The <HI>Father</HI> of the <HI>Children;</HI> The <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of the <HI>Servants;</HI> The <HI>Governour</HI> or all the <HI>Governed;</HI> He is the <HI>Spring</HI> of Motion to all persons there; Every Child and Servant, acts, By, From, and Under him, The Wife indeed mooves <HI>By,</HI> and <HI>With,</HI> but all others <HI>From</HI> and <HI>Under</HI> him; when they move aright. As the Soul gives Wife and Motion, to the <HI>Body-Natural;</HI> So the Head of the Family, puts Vigor and Activity, into the <HI>Body-OEconomical;</HI> Hence <HI>JOSHUA</HI> in our Text, Moves First, Resolving that all the Rest of
<PB N="31" REF="000644_0039_0FA9618B9520FB38"/>
his Family, shall Move and Engage along with him: <HI>As for ME and my HOUSE, we will Serve the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Master of the Family, hath an Especial Betrustment, with all the SOULS in the Family, and must</HI> One Day <HI>be Accountable</HI> for them. Masters of Families, do in a sort sustaine a Publick Ca∣pacity, and such must give Account of the Per∣sons Committed unto their Charge: For they are not Betrusted only with the <HI>Bodies</HI> in their Families (although the Neglect of them were an unaccountable Transgression) But also with their <HI>SOULS,</HI> and with them Especially, as the most Excellent Constituent Parts of Man; Hence when another Person is added, to the Family, there is one <HI>Soul</HI> more, for whose Eternal Salvation, the Godly Housholder is to be <HI>Emi∣nently</HI> Concerned. The Children born in Our Families, are <HI>Born unto God,</HI> and a strict account will one day be Required of us, what we have done <HI>With,</HI> and how we have discharged Du∣ty <HI>Unto; GODS Children,</HI> Ezek. 16.20,21.—<HI>Thou hast Slaine Mr Children;</HI> These Children, God Committeth unto us for Education, He doth (To speak with Reverence) Put them Out to us; as <HI>Pharaohs</HI> Daughter did <HI>Moses,</HI> to the Hebrew Woman <HI>his Mother,</HI> saying as She Did; Exod. 2. 9. <HI>Take this Child, and Nurse it for ME, &amp;c.</HI> Being therefore thus Committed <HI>unto us,</HI> Account concerning them may <HI>Justly,</HI> and
<PB N="32" REF="000644_0040_0FA9618C15769160"/>
will <HI>Certainly,</HI> be Required <HI>Of us,</HI> in the Great Day: When if it shall Appear, that by means of our Neglect of Duty they be missing; <HI>Our Life</HI> must go for <HI>Theirs;</HI> Especially, being so Solemnly Warned before-hand; as he was in another case, (Kings 20. 43.)</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Inferiours are</HI> Generally <HI>Ordered in their Manners,</HI> according to the <HI>Practice</HI> and <HI>Example of their Superiours.</HI> The <HI>Poet</HI> hath told us,</P>

<P>As is the <HI>Prince,</HI> So is the <HI>People.</HI></P>
<P>And we Commonly say, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Exempla Movent.</HI> Precepts do <HI>Instruct,</HI> but Examples do <HI>Move,</HI> and Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. Hence such Masters of Fa∣milies, as give good Counsels, to their Children and Servants; And at the same time Practice what is Clean contrary, will find by Woful Ex∣perence that one Evil Example, will do more Hurt, than Ten good Precepts will Rectify and Amend. Indeed such Masters are like <HI>Rowers,</HI> who Look one way and Row another, speak <HI>Well</HI> but do <HI>Ill,</HI> so that I may allude to what He said in another case (Gen. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.22.) <HI>The Voice is</HI> Jacobs, <HI>but the Hands are the Hands of</HI> Esau.

<P>Labour to give every Duty, its <HI>Proper Season allowing full time unto the Performance thereof.</HI> What the Wise man saith, of <HI>a Word spoken in</HI> Season; Prov. 15. 23. I may properly Apply, unto a Duty done in Season, and say in like manner; <HI>How good is it?</HI> This puts a Beauty of Holyness, upon all other occasions o the Family. And for Encouraging our <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Conscience</HI> herein, we may Consider (1.) <HI>This will make our Dutyes, so much the more Acceptable to GOD.</HI> He is a God of Order, and doth all His works in the most Proper Season, and Therefore <HI>Expects,</HI> and <HI>Requires,</HI> that we should Endeavour to com∣ply with His <HI>Precept</HI> and <HI>Example,</HI> therein. It is said, Eccl. 3. 11. <HI>He hath made every thing, Beautifull in His Time.</HI> Hence then, the more <HI>Seasonable,</HI> the more <HI>Beautifull</HI> things are, in the Sight of God and Man; But Neg∣lect of the due Season, for our Family Du∣tyes, introduceth many uncomfortable Disord∣ers, and Distractions in the other affaires of our Families, and we find our selves, <HI>Taken in those Evil Nets,</HI> for <HI>not Knowing our Time;</HI>

(Eccl. 9.12.) To the Dishonnour of God, and our Profession of Godlyness; Convince∣ing us by our own Wofull Experience, of the truth of what the <HI>Wise Man</HI> Asserts, Eccl.8.6. <HI>Because to Every Purpose, there is Time and Judgment: therefore the Misery of man is Great upon him (i. e.)</HI> because he hath not Understanding, to comply therewith.</P>
<P>(2.) <HI>Our Conscientious Care in this matter, will Convince</HI> our Children and Servants, <HI>that these Dutyes are of great Importance,</HI> In that we are so much concerned, about the Ordering, and Timeing of them. It is very good, to <HI>State</HI> and <HI>Keep,</HI> a certaine <HI>Hour of Prayer,</HI> as that was at the Temple, when <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> Attended there Acts 3. 1. So if the Heads of Families, are carefully to attend, at the <HI>Stated</HI> Times (as near as Possible they Can) all others in the Family, will be under an <HI>Awe</HI> of such a <HI>Godly</HI> Practice; and Remember that all Affaires, in which they are concerned; either within Doores, or without; must be dispatched ac∣cordingly. And for Complyance with this Di∣rection take these RULES.</P>
<P><HI>RULE. I. Make every Occasion</HI> (that Pos∣sibly may) <HI>Give Way to the Time of Family Duties; all Suffer not them Ordinarily to give way to any thing.</HI> It must be Acknowledged; that there are several Duties incumbent on Christi∣ans,
<PB N="35" REF="000644_0043_0FA9618E4AF5C558"/>
in their <HI>Particular Callings,</HI> besides those of their <HI>General Calling,</HI> but God allows time for <HI>Both,</HI> and it belongs to every ones <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Conscience,</HI> so to manage the <HI>Former,</HI> that they may not Entersere with, or Obstruct the <HI>Latter:</HI> Let then the Momentous Duties of our General Calling, have a Proper and Pro∣potionable Time, all other business being <HI>Fore∣casted</HI> and Modelled accordingly. The <HI>Want of Care</HI> herein, doth too too often <HI>Obstruct,</HI> Reli∣ous Duties, Even in some of the Strictest Fa∣milies.</P>
<P><HI>RULE. II. Be sure to Begin with Religion, Earth in the Morning.</HI> This will have a Special Influence, upon the Orderly management of All the Duties of the Day, both in our Gene∣ral and Particular calling. The <HI>Poet</HI> could say, <HI>A Jove Principium &amp;c.</HI> Begin with God: And the <HI>Sweet Psalmist</HI> of Israel pleads his <HI>Ear∣liness,</HI> and <HI>Earnestness,</HI> For acceptance in his Devotions, Psal. 5. 3. <HI>My voice shalt Thou Hear in the</HI> Morning <HI>O Lord: in the</HI> Morning <HI>will I direct my Prayer unto Thee &amp; will Look up.</HI> It is Admirable to Observe, how Religion <HI>Thrives,</HI> in those few <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Families;</HI> who make Conscience, of Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly attending Family Duties. But on the Contrary; where <HI>Sloth</HI> is <HI>Indulged</HI> in the Morning, Religious Duties are long <HI>Deferred,</HI> so that this Person comes <HI>In,</HI> or
<PB N="36" REF="000644_0044_0FA9618F6197BF28"/>
the other Business <HI>Calls</HI> for Attendance, and the pretended Necessary delay of them, doth too often issue, in a <HI>Sinful</HI> and therefore <HI>Shame∣full,</HI> Obstruction or Omission for that Day and Time.</P>
<P><HI>RULE. III. Let all General Family Duties, be attended in such Seasonable manner, as that Eve∣ry Person of Understanding, and Capacity to Profit, may Without Faile be Present at them.</HI> We ought not to let our Children or Servants, want a Meal for their Bodies; Oh! Let none of them Miss of a <HI>Chapter,</HI> a <HI>Prayer,</HI> An <HI>Exhor∣tation</HI> or <HI>Counsel,</HI> for their Precious and Immor∣tal Souls. For if they do Perceive Us, not to be concerned, about their being Present at such Duties; they may well imagine, the Attending of them is of <HI>No Great Importance,</HI> and the Neg∣lect of them is of <HI>No very Dangerous Consequence.</HI> And under those Pernicious Misapprehensions, may be ready to harden themselves in Sin, and to Persist in Careless and Sinful Neglect of Du∣ty; so as to hazzard the Utter Ruin and De∣struction of their Souls for ever.</P>
<P><HI>RULE. IV.</HI> And Lastly. <HI>Be not over∣edious in Family-Duties.</HI> I Confess, this is an Error on the Right hand, yet it is an Error; which some Professors Do fall into: Now if we are Over-Tedious in Duties, it detracts from
<PB N="37" REF="000644_0045_0FA9619018CFB710"/>
the Seasonableness of them, hence a Duty be∣gun in good Time, may be Unseasonably Ended by the Length of it. <HI>God is in Heaven, and thou on Earth, therefore let thy Words be few, (i. e.) Humble, Sensible, Faithful,</HI> and <HI>Fervent;</HI> I would not be thought, to Diswade or Dis∣courage Pious Souls, from enlarging their Pray∣ers, when they want any <HI>Special Family-Mercies,</HI> and would Jointly Apply themselves to the Throne of Grace to obtain them: Or when they have received any <HI>Family-Blessings,</HI> and would Jointly return their Praises, and Thans∣givings for them; But it hath been observed, that the most <HI>Pious</HI> and <HI>Zealous</HI> Ministers; have not been long in Family Duties, no nor yet in Publick Prayer on Ordinary Occasions; giving this Reason, they were willing to Pray their Hearers Hearts <HI>Into Heaven</HI> (by a warmth of Holy Zeal and Fervency) but not by Tedious∣ness to Pray them <HI>Out again.</HI> Besides the <HI>Parts</HI> of <HI>Prayer</HI> are not many, and the Petitions in the Lords Prayer, that <HI>Most Excellent Platform,</HI> are but Six, besides the Preface and the Conclusion. Again the <HI>Spirit</HI> is never so willing as it ought to be; but when it is <HI>Most willing, the Flesh is Weak.</HI> Finally, God is not moved by a Multi∣tude of Words, he needs not <HI>Information,</HI> but hath Commanded us onely to be his <HI>Remem∣brancers,</HI> who hath graciously Commended, and Encouraged, Sincerity and Fervency; James 5.

<P>Let us <HI>be Careful, to Discharge Duty unto our Children, in Every Respect, so soon as they are Capable, and have Understanding to At∣tend us therein.</HI> The Reason why many Chil∣dren in our Families, Serve the Lord no more, when they are grown up; but rather Addict themselves, to the Service of <HI>Satan, Sin,</HI> and <HI>Sensuallity,</HI> is in great measure, to be Attributed unto their Parents Neglect of Duty towards them, in their Minority.

<DIV3 TYPE="considerations">
<P>By way of <HI>MOTIVE</HI> then, unto these Duties, briefly,</P>
<P>Let us <HI>CONSIDER. I. The Service of the LORD is the most Excellent Service, In which any Person can be Employed.</HI> It is an <HI>Happi∣ness,</HI> A <HI>Priviledg,</HI> A <HI>Dignity,</HI> to Serve the Lord What the Psalmist saith of the Precepts of the Word, I may say in this Case (Psal. 19.11.) <HI>In the Performance thereof, there is great Re∣ward;</HI>

God is our <HI>Master in Heaven,</HI> Eph. 6. 9. And His Glorious Properties, are en∣gaged to <HI>Direct, Assist,</HI> and <HI>Uphold</HI> His Ser∣vants; There is <HI>Honour</HI> in Serving the Lord, As they that serve great Princes, are honou∣rable for Their sakes; So Our Lord Jesus saith, <HI>If any man Serve ME, Him will MY Father Honnour;</HI> Joh. 12. 26. Besides there is True Happiness, in Serving the Lord; what the Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> said of the <HI>servants of Solomon,</HI> is much more true of those who Serve Him, who is <HI>Greater then Solomon;</HI> I King. 10. 8. <HI>Happy are thy men, and Happy are these thy Servants, who stand Continually before Thee; and hear Thy Wisdome.</HI> So <HI>Great,</HI> so <HI>Good,</HI> and <HI>Gracious,</HI> is the God whom we Serve. A∣gain, This <HI>LORD</HI> and <HI>Master,</HI> gives the most <HI>Excellent wages;</HI> such as Serve the Lord, they Do not, they <HI>Shall not, Serve Him for nought;</HI> Job 1. 9.

The Transcendent Excellency, of which Rewards, are Represented unto us by the most Illustrious Metaphors, <ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR> Of a <HI>Kingdom;</HI> Luke. 22. 29. A <HI>Throne</HI> Rev.

3. 21. A <HI>Crown of Life;</HI> Rev. 2. 10. A <HI>Crown of Righteousness;</HI> 2 Tim 4. 8. A <HI>Crown of Glory that fadeth not away;</HI> 1 Pet. 5. 4. And in a word, <HI>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath entred into the heart of man to Conceive, what God hath Prepared for those that Love Him</HI> and <HI>Serve</HI> Him, 1 Cor. 2. 9. <HI>This, This,</HI> is the <HI>Portion</HI> of him that Faith∣fully Serves the Lord: and the <HI>Heritage,</HI> Appointed unto him of God.</P>
<P><HI>CONSIDER. II. The Miserable Condi∣tion, of such Masters and Families, as do not Serve the Lord.</HI> They are the Objects of Di∣vine Fury. The Inspired Penmen of the Ho∣ly Scriptures, have by the Holy Ghost; uttered direful Imprecations, That Divine Wrath might not onely be <HI>Dropped,</HI> but <HI>Poured down, upon those that Call not on the Name of the Lord (i.e.)</HI> Such as Live in the Total Neglect, of Family Worship and Religion; <HI>Jer.</HI> 10. 25. A Fami∣ly which do not Serve and Worship the Lord, is an <HI>Heathenish Family;</HI> And is therefore Ex∣posed to the Wrath and Curse, of the Infinite and Eternal God. Consider this, Ye that <HI>Forget your Maker,</HI> and from time to time Neglect His Worship and Service in your Families. <HI>Lest He Tear you in Pieces, and there be none to Deliver.</HI></P>
<P><HI>CONSIDER. III. If any of those that make the fairest Profession, can allow themselves in the Neglect or Slighty Performance of Family Duties, they have
<PB N="48" REF="000644_0056_0FA9619BDC19C190"/>
great Reason to question the Truth of their Pro∣fession.</HI> It is one thing to <HI>Fall</HI> Into, or to be <HI>Forced</HI> Unto, a Neglect of Duty; and another thing to <HI>Allow</HI> our selves in that Neglect. The best of all, may Casually be Interrupted or hindred, but it is their grief. To allow the Omission of Known Duty; or Commission of Known Sin; Shews that Person to be under the Power of some Lust, which layes a Wound at the very Root and Foundation, of their Profession of Re∣ligion. Now the most distinguishing signes; of a Sincere Profession, are taken from a Spiritual and Fervent Performance, of Private Duties; Hence a man is not to Judge of himself or o∣thers, by the shew that he or they make, of Zeal and Devotion, in the Church, Town, or Company of Godly men: But by his or their Care, and Conscience; Zeal, and Fervency; in the <HI>Private, Secret,</HI> and most retired Duties, of Practical Godliness. It is oftentimes said, and that too truly, that Some men are <HI>Saints abroad, &amp; Devils at home.</HI> Amongst those that Countenance Religion, they can look as Demure, and speak as Fair as the best; but observe them at home, and they are guilty of many Sinful, and Shame∣ful Neglects, of Family Worship and Religion. Surely such may Justly fear, that God will one day Write upon their whole Profession. <HI>TEKEL thou are weighed in the ballance, and art found wanting.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="000644_0057_0FA9619C8B2B7770"/>
<HI>CONSIDER. IV. The Sincerity of our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to our Families and every Person under our Charge is best Approved by our Care of their SOULS.</HI> It is the Property of <HI>True Love</HI> to Endeavour the <HI>Best Good</HI> of the Object. Now a Natural Affection may move us to take care of the <HI>Bodies</HI> of our Children; Our own Worldly interest may Excite us to take care of the Bodies of our Servants, that they may Serve us the better; but it is onely a <HI>True Christian-Love</HI> that will Engage us to Concern our selves about their <HI>Souls.</HI> The <HI>Soul</HI> of man is the <HI>Better Part,</HI> and Love of that is the <HI>Best of Love.</HI> Hence those Duties of Religion which do in a special Manner tend to the good of <HI>SOULS</HI> are of the Highest concernment: For our Saviour Himself saith, <HI>What will it Profit a man, if he should Gain the whole World, and Loose his own SOUL: or What shall a man give in Exchange for his SOUL.</HI> Matt.16.26.</P>
<P><HI>CONSIDER. V. Our Faithful and Diligent Serv∣ing the LORD;</HI> In <HI>and</HI> With <HI>our Families; will In∣fluence those about us to be Diligent &amp; Industri∣ous in Serving of Us.</HI> If we are Conscientious, in Serving our <HI>Master in Heaven;</HI> it will oblige them to be Circumspect in Serving Us, who are our <HI>Servants on Earth.</HI> Sanctification is the Re∣newal of the <HI>Image</HI> of God, and that layes an Awe <HI>Upon;</HI> and Challenges a Reverence <HI>From;</HI> those about us; so that <HI>Godly</HI> Persons will Serve us out of Conscience; because they Serve God in Serv∣ing
<PB N="50" REF="000644_0058_0FA9619D5FC35130"/>
of us; <HI>Ungodly</HI> Persons, will be under special Awe of Religion and Godliness; though not meerly out of Conscience, yet from Unavoida∣ble Conviction, which ever accompanies the Pow∣er of Godliness: So that <HI>Falling down, they will</HI> and Must <HI>acknowledge that God is in you of a Truth.</HI> I Cor.14.25. And therefore that <HI>Reverence,</HI> and Service is due unto you.</P>
<P><HI>CONSIDER. VI. The Faithful Discharge of these Duties, will make our Families seem Like Little Churches.</HI> A Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, is a Number of <HI>Saints,</HI> that are engaged and <HI>Resolv∣ed;</HI> to perform <HI>Duties,</HI> and Celebrate <HI>Ordinances</HI> together. Where therefore, a Family doth Con∣stantly, and Carefully, attend all manner of Re∣ligious Duties, belonging thereunto: There is a Resemblance of an <HI>Holy</HI> and <HI>Church</HI> Communion, hence we read of a <HI>CHURCH which is in their House,</HI> I Cor.16.19.</P>
<P><HI>CONSIDER. VII. A Family, which Live in the Total Neglect of Religious Duties, is a meer Nurse∣ry of Satan, and Cage of Unclean Birds.</HI> Be∣cause there <HI>GOD</HI> is Dishonoured; His <HI>Name</HI> Blas∣phemed; His <HI>Worship</HI> Neglected; and <HI>Sin</HI> Com∣mitted, without Controule; Insomuch that <HI>SA∣TAN</HI> hath <HI>Therein</HI> and <HI>Thereby Dominion</HI> over them; Hence those <HI>Spriggs,</HI> which are Transplanted out of such a <HI>Nursery;</HI> into the Orchard of the Com∣mon-Wealth, cannot bring forth any, but <HI>Sowre</HI> and Unsavoury fruit, which will be <HI>Rejected</HI> of

<HI>GOD,</HI> being <HI>nigh unto Cursing, whose End is to be Burned,</HI> Heb. 6.8.</P>
<P><HI>CONSIDER. VIII. The Foundation of a whole People or Kingdoms Reformation, or Defection, Religion, or Rebellion, is laid in Families.</HI> Fa∣milies are the Constituent Parts of Nations, and Kingdoms; hence as Families are <HI>Well</HI> or <HI>Ill Dis∣ciplined,</HI> so will the whole be <HI>Well</HI> Disposed, or <HI>Ill Inclined.</HI> Ataxy and Disorder Here, the Lord threatens to Punish His own People for; Isai.3.5. <HI>The Child Riseth up against the Antient,</HI> and that seems to be the Reason of what follows, <ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>The Base behaves himself</HI> Unbecomingly <HI>Against the Honourable.</HI> And as for our selves, we need not wonder at the Disorders that happen in the <HI>State;</HI> when we observe the Neglects that are among us in respect of <HI>Family-Government.</HI> For where∣as, the <HI>Fifth</HI> Commandment Requires us; to Honour and Reverence our Parents, both in <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Gesture,</HI> some Professors amongst us, seem to make Conscience not to Expect or Challeng it from their Children, either in <HI>Word</HI> or <HI>Gesture,</HI> being ready to account it a <HI>Sin</HI> so to do; As that which Christian Parents <HI>Ought not,</HI> or at least <HI>Need not</HI> be concerned about. But it is certainly a <HI>Truth</HI> that such as carry themselves <HI>Ill</HI> in the <HI>Family,</HI> will not be likely to Demean themselves <HI>Well</HI> in the <HI>Common-Weatlh.</HI></P>
<P><HI>CONSIDER. IX. The Remembrance of our Con∣scientious Endeavour, to Serve the Lord in and with
<PB N="52" REF="000644_0060_0FA961A0B9166910"/>
our Families, will be Living Comfort to us in a Dying Hour.</HI> Friends, the Time is Coming; yea and hasteneth a pace, in which we must be Separated from our Families, and Every Particu∣lar Person in them; <ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR> Either by our being <HI>Ta∣ken</HI> from <HI>them,</HI> or they from <HI>Us:</HI> and then the Place that knew us here, shall know us again no more. Now the Hours of near approaching Death, are filled up, with many <HI>Cares,</HI> and <HI>Fears,</HI> about our Children and Relations which we are are to leave behind us: Surely, Then the Witness of a good Conscience, That we have Endeavoured with <HI>David,</HI> to <HI>Walk in our Houses with a Perfect Heart:</HI> And with <HI>Abraham, to Teach our Children and Houshold;</HI> in a Godly manner: will be unto us the Best Cordial in the Whole World. If then we can Plead with the Lord, as <HI>Hezekiah</HI> did; Isa.28.2. <HI>Remember O Lord, How I have Walked before Thee in Truth; and done that which is Right in Thy Sight. (i.e.)</HI> Filled up every Relation I Sustained, with a Conscientious Discharge of Duty therein: And accordingly have Reason to Believe, that we are Just going, to Receive a Blessed Re∣ward: we may even under our Sharpest Con∣flicts, with the <HI>King of Terrors;</HI> Rejoyce <HI>with Joy unspeakable and Full of Glory.</HI> On the other hand; if any in our Families, are by Death re∣moving <HI>From Us,</HI> and it is a <HI>Dying Hour</HI> with <HI>Them:</HI> we shall be able with Humble Subjection of Spirit, to Resigne them up to that God, to whom we have so often Recommended them, by our

Fervent Prayers; having Reason in our Mourn∣ing to <HI>Hope</HI> and <HI>Believe,</HI> that God will answer the Sincere desires of our Souls, on their behalf, and Receive them into <HI>His Armes of Everlasting Mercy.</HI> I Thes.4.13. How Quietly, How Comfortably; may we bear a Separation from them <HI>New;</HI> in hopes of a Joyful Meeting with them <HI>In the DAY of the LORD;</HI> which will never more Admit of any Separation.</P>
<P><HI>CONSIDER.

And further, if as an Aggravation, any Servant of ours should have
<PB N="54" REF="000644_0062_0FA961A371650500"/>
reason to alledg and say, Lord, I was <HI>Born of Religi∣our Parents,</HI> who made it their business, to Season my young and tender years, with the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord; who Carefully, and Faithfully, <HI>Exhorted</HI> and <HI>Exampled</HI> me in the Great and Important Duties, of Religion and God∣liness, whereby according to my Age and Capa∣city, I had some <HI>Light</HI> and Influence of <HI>Divine Truth</HI> upon my heart; and through the Common workings of the Spirit; I felt some <HI>Convictions</HI> of Sin, and had some <HI>Measure of Love</HI> To, and Desires After, the things of God; But being cast into <HI>This</HI> mans Family, to Serve some years with him, through his <HI>Sinful</HI> Examples, and <HI>Shameful</HI> Neglects of Duty, both to <HI>GOD</HI> and <HI>Me;</HI> my <HI>Convictions</HI> weakened, <HI>Corruption</HI> Strengthened, the <HI>Spirit with∣drew</HI> His Striveings with me, and I became at length, hardened <HI>In</HI> Sin, and <HI>From the Fear of God,</HI> to the Utter undoing of my Precious and Immor∣tal Soul. How will the Torments of <HI>Hell,</HI> Rack the Soul and Conscience of such a <HI>Father</HI> or <HI>Ma∣ster!</HI> How will they be a Thousand times more afraid, before the Great Judge, then <HI>Haman</HI> was, before the Great <HI>Ahasuerus,</HI> when he perceived, that <HI>Evil was determined against him,</HI> as to his Bodily Life; How will they Wish that thy might Shrivle and Vanish away into Nothing: That they might be <HI>Metamorphosed</HI> or Changed, into the most <HI>Ve∣nomous</HI> Serpent, the most <HI>Loathsome</HI> Toad; yea into A <HI>Stock,</HI> A <HI>Stone,</HI> or any sort of being, that is desti∣tute of a Rational and Immortal Soul.

Yea a <HI>Greater</HI> than the Apostle <HI>John</HI> tells us, Mat.6.24. <HI>Yee cannot Serve God and Mammon;</HI> He that indulges a fixed Worldly Principle in him, shall Certainly find, that the most <HI>Important</HI> Duties, of Family-Worship, will be either <HI>Neglected,</HI> or <HI>Shuffled</HI> over, if any Worldly Affaires Enterfere, or stand in Competition with them. For <HI>The Love of Money (i.e.)</HI> of Worldly Wealth and Riches, is <HI>The Root of all Evil,</HI> and those that Covet after it <HI>(i. e.)</HI> set their Heart upon it, so as to Neglect their Duties to God, either Publick or Private, will find themselves <HI>Pierced</HI> through with <HI>Many Sorrows;</HI> I Tim.6.10. In the Name and Words then, of our Lord Jesus Christ, Luke.12.15.—<HI>Take heed &amp; beware of Covetousness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Let us Take heed, <HI>of Suffering Our Anthority to be Disputed, or Exampled upon, by any of Our Chil∣dren or Servants.</HI> If we do not maintain, the <HI>Vigour</HI> of Family-Government to the utmost; Religious Duties, are so much against the <HI>Graine</HI> of Natural Corruption, that we shall not be able to Comply
<PB N="60" REF="000644_0068_0FA961A988AF1D30"/>
with our own Resolutions, to Serve the Lord: be∣cause this <HI>Child</HI> and the other <HI>Servant,</HI> will <HI>Neglect, Dispute</HI> against, and at last <HI>Despise</HI> to be <HI>Counselled, Catechized,</HI> and <HI>Instructed,</HI> much more to be Re∣buked or <HI>Corrected,</HI> for the greatest miscarriages. Maintain we then, a Civil Order and <HI>Decorum,</HI> by Vigorous Excercise of Family-<HI>Discipline,</HI> to every one in their Places and Relations, This will make way for their Ready Compliance, with Family∣Religious Duties; Whereas Remisness herein, will Introduce <HI>Confusion, Rebellion, Dissobedience,</HI> to God and Man; Yea and <HI>Every Evil Work.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Let us Take heed <HI>of Resolving In our own Strength.</HI> If we would have our Resolutions <HI>Sincere, Firm,</HI> and <HI>Lasting,</HI> Let us Implore the Guid∣ance and Direction of the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, in <HI>Make∣ing</HI> of them and depend upon His Influence and Assistance, for the <HI>Keeping</HI> of them, For we may be assured, that if we make never so <HI>Many</HI> Reso∣lutions, and those never so <HI>Firm</HI> in our own Strength, we shall find by <HI>Woful</HI> Experience, that they are but like the <HI>Goodness</HI> of <HI>Ephraim</HI> and <HI>Ju∣dah,</HI> which is by the Prophet in <HI>Hos.</HI> 6.4. Compa∣red to a <HI>Morning Cloud,</HI> and an <HI>Early Dew</HI> which Suddenly and Insensibly <HI>Passeth away.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. And Lastly, Take heed <HI>of giving way to Seruples About, or Objections Against, any kind of Family-Duties.</HI> This is the ready way, to bring them out of <HI>Respect</HI> with Us; and to betray us to <HI>Neglect</HI> of Them. Now the Excuses and <HI>Objections,</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="000644_0069_0FA961AAF9511C68"/>
which are Commonly made, about <HI>Prayer,</HI> and other Family-Worship; are reduceable to <HI>Three</HI> heads.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> I. Some are ready to say, <HI>I would Per∣form these Duties</HI> in my Family, <HI>but I want Expres∣sion:</HI> I cannot <HI>Express</HI> my self in a <HI>Suitable man∣ner,</HI> to Pray with, or to Instruct others.</P>
<P>Ans. I. <HI>Mayst thou not justly Blame, thy Former Neglect,</HI> for thy Present <HI>Inability,</HI> to perform these Duties? We say <HI>Use Leggs and have Leggs;</HI> and God sayes He <HI>Will give Grace to the Humble;</HI> I Pet.5.5. Yea and His <HI>Holy Spirit to those that ask Him.</HI> Luk.11.13. <HI>(i.e.)</HI> The Gifts and Graces of His Spirit, to those that are waiteing upon Him for it in a way of Duty; be deeply humbled, for <HI>Past</HI> Neglects; and let want of <HI>Utterance,</HI> be no longer any <HI>Hinderance.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Get Suitable Impressions, and that will help unto proper Expressions.</HI> Be we under a <HI>Deep</HI> and Humble sense, of the <HI>Need,</HI> that We and all Ours stand in, of <HI>Pardoning Mercy,</HI> and Purging Grace, Of <HI>Justification,</HI> from the Guilt of Sin, by the Im∣putation of Christs Righteousness <HI>To</HI> Us: Of <HI>Sanctification</HI> from the Pollution of Sin, by the Implantation of that Righteousness <HI>In</HI> Us: Be we under <HI>Sensible Impressions,</HI> that there is Enough in Christ, to supply all our Soul Necessities; even <HI>All Fulness.</HI> Col 1.19. And that it is Promised, that we shall <HI>Receive</HI> thereof <HI>Grace for Grace,</HI> Joh.1.16. <HI>As need Requires,</HI> Heb.4.16. And as <HI>Need will make the Naked man to Run;</HI> So sense thereof, will make
<PB N="62" REF="000644_0070_0FA961AC244E9228"/>
the <HI>Needy-Soul,</HI> able to Express himself so as may obtain <HI>Audience, Acceptance,</HI> and <HI>Answer,</HI> from that God, who never accounts Himself better Served in Prayer; than when the <HI>Spirit</HI> helpeth a Sincere Soul, to <HI>Address</HI> Him: <HI>Cum Suspirijs Inenarrabilibus;</HI> with <HI>Groanings which cannot be Uttered</HI> Rom.8.26.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Do as well as you Can,</HI> and improve all Ad∣vantages to do better. Up and be doing, manifest a willing mind, and be assured the Lord will accept you, according to what you have, and not according to what you have not. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.12.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Exercise Faith on Jesus Christ,</HI> and that will make the least Sincere Service accep∣table to God. Whereas <HI>Without Faith it is Impos∣sible to please Him.</HI> Heb.11.6.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Be Frequent and Fervent in Secret Duties,</HI> and that will fit us for Family Duties.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 2. <HI>But I am a Poor man, I cannot Spare Time to Attend these Duties, least my Family Want thereby.</HI></P>
<P>Ans. I. What Man! <HI>Dost thou want Time?</HI> Canst thou not afford <HI>One Hour,</HI> to the Service of that God who gives thee <HI>Twenty Four Hours</HI> Every Day, For thy Worldly Affaires?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Trust GOD, that thou shalt not loose by the time thou Expendest in His Service.</HI> He hath Pro∣mised, that if we <HI>Honnour the Lord with our Sub∣stance, Our Earnes shall be filled,</HI> Prov.3.10. He Challengeth His People to <HI>Prove Him,</HI> and see if He will not <HI>Open the Windows of Heaven, &amp; Rain down a Blessing, that there shall not be Room to Re∣ceive it.</HI> Mal. 3.10.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="63" REF="000644_0071_0FA961AC82260C80"/>
3. <HI>Do you not Squander away much more time; than these Duties would take up?</HI> In Unseasonable <HI>Sleeping, Smoaking, Drinking, Company Keeping,</HI> In <HI>Hearing</HI> or <HI>Telling</HI> News; Yea it may be <HI>Worse than that,</HI> In <HI>Reproaching, Slandering,</HI> and <HI>Backbite∣ing</HI> your Neighbours; Spend less time in these things; and there will Remain Sufficient time, for all Duties both of Our General and Particular Calling. In a word, Devote a Proportion of E∣very Day unto God, and He will Bless the Rest, so as shall fully make you Amends for so doing.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 3. But, <HI>There are many Grown Persons in my Family, I am Ashamed</HI> to attend These Duties before them.</P>
<P>Ans. I. This is <HI>a Shame,</HI> which we have rea∣son to be <HI>Ashamed</HI> of, and <HI>Humbled</HI> for; What ashamed! Of our <HI>Religion,</HI> Our <HI>Duty,</HI> Our <HI>Glory,</HI> Our <HI>GOD.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>All the Rest</HI> in our Families, <HI>are our Inferiours.</HI> It argues great holly and Weakness, to be Ashamed before such as are Our <HI>Inferiours.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. And Lastly, <HI>If we are now Ashamed of the Service</HI> and <HI>Worship</HI> of God; Our Lord Jesus Christ will be <HI>Ashamed</HI> of Us, when <HI>He comes in the Glory of His Father, with the Holy Angles,</HI> Mark 8.38.</P>
<P><HI>To Conclude,</HI> We that are Now before the Lord, are all of us Concerned in <HI>Families;</HI> being either <HI>In</HI> or <HI>Under</HI> Family-Government. It is of Special Concernment, that we do see to our <HI>De∣sires, Designs, Resolutions,</HI> and <HI>Endeavours,</HI> in those
<PB N="64" REF="000644_0072_0FA961AD22F7FB08"/>
Duties Incumbent on us; that we may Walk in our Places, and Stations, with an <HI>Upright Heart,</HI> in every Way of Serving, Worshiping, and Glorify∣ing the <HI>LORD:</HI> Who is yet Pleased, to afford us so much <HI>Peace,</HI> in our Borders, and <HI>Health,</HI> in our Dwellings. That He may still Delight to <HI>Do For us,</HI> and <HI>Abide With us,</HI> as He was with our <HI>Fathers;</HI> and may Never <HI>Leave us</HI> nor <HI>Forsake us.</HI> Let us then be <HI>Faithful,</HI> and <HI>Constant,</HI> in Serving the Lord, <HI>Doing</HI> our Duty with <HI>Dilligence, Suffer∣ing</HI> the Will of God with <HI>Patience,</HI> Going on to the <HI>Last,</HI> Holding out to the <HI>End,</HI> and being Faith∣ful unto <HI>Death:</HI> That in the day of Account, we may be able to say, with Holy Boldness, before the Great Judge: <HI>Here we Are,</HI> and those of Our Families, which the Lord was Graciously <HI>Pleased,</HI> to betrust us with the <HI>Care, Education,</HI> and <HI>Govern∣ment</HI> of; And we have Brought them Up, in the <HI>Nurture and Admonition of the LORD.</HI> Then shall we, together with them, Receive His <HI>Well Done,</HI> Good and Faithful Servants: <HI>Enter</HI> into Our Masters Joy: And be made Partakers, of that Everlasting Blessedness, which shall Assuredly be the Portion, of Every <HI>Servant,</HI> whom his Lord when he <HI>Cometh,</HI> shall find So Doing. <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
