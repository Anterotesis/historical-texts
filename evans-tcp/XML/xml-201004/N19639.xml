<HEAD>DEDICATION, <HI>To the</HI> PEOPLE <HI>who shall live in the</HI> DAYS <HI>of the</HI> MILLENNIUM.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>HAIL, YE HAPPY PEOPLE, HIGHLY FAVOURED OF THE LORD!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO you the following treatise on the Millen∣nium is dedicated, as you will live in that happy era, and enjoy the good of it in a much higher degree, than it can be now enjoyed in the prospect of it. And that you may know, if this book shall be conveyed down to your time, what is now thought of you, and of the happy day, in which you will come on the stage of life. You will be able to see the mistakes which are now made on this head; and how far what is advanced here, is agreeable to that which is noted in the scripture of truth, and a true and proper description of the events which are to take place; and to rectify every mistake. All is therefore humbly submitted to your better judgment.</P>
<P>When you shall learn what a variety of errors, in doctrine and practice, have been, and are now imbibed and propagated; and in what an imper∣fect and defective manner they are opposed and confuted; and the truth explained and defended: And observe how many defects and mistakes there are in those writings which contain most truth, and come nearest to the standard of all religious truth, the holy scripture, you will be ready to wonder how all this could be, where divine revela∣tion is enjoyed. But your benevolence and can∣dour, will make all proper allowances, for all the
<PB N="iv" REF="025635_0003_0FCEAC0A005A4948"/>prejudices and darkness which take place in these days, and pity us; while your piety will lead you to ascribe the greater light and advantages which you will enjoy, and your better discerning and judgment, not unto yourselves, but to the dis∣tinguishing, sovereign grace of God.</P>
<P>Though you have yet no existence, nevertheless, the faith of the christians in this and in former ages, beholds you "at hand to come;" and real∣izing your future existence and character, you are greatly esteemed and loved; and the pious have great joy in you, while they are constantly, and with great earnestness praying for you. They who make mention of the Lord, will not keep silence, nor give him any rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. For you they are praying and labouring, and to you they are min∣istring; and without you they cannot be made per∣fect. And you will enter into their labours, and reap the happy fruit of their prayers, toils and sufferings.</P>
<P>They will be in heaven, with the holy angels and the spririts of the just made perfect, when you will come upon the stage in this world; and they will rejoice in you, in your knowledge, benevo∣lence, piety, righteousness and happiness: And all their past prayers for you will be turned into joy and praise. And you will, in due time, be gather∣ed together with them unto the Lord Jesus Christ, in his eternal kingdom, and join in seeing and praising him forever, ascribing blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, unto the only true God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.</P>

<HEAD>A TREATISE ON THE MILLENNIUM.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>A PARTICULAR history of the church of Christ, from the days of the Apostles, to this time; of the various changes through which it has past; of the doctrines which have been taught and maintained; of the discipline, worship, and man∣ners, which have taken place; of the grand apostacy in the church of Rome, and of the reformation, &amp;c. might be prop∣erly subjoined to the foregoing system, were it not that this has been done by a number of writers already; so that all who are disposed to acquaint themselves with ecclesiastical history, may obtain this information by books already extant; Which, at the same time, serve to confirm the truth and divine original of chris∣tianity, by discovering, in how many instances the state of the church, and the events which have had a particular respect to it, have been foretold, and have taken place according to the pre∣dictions. This subject has been particularly illustrated by Mr. Lowman, in his "Paraphrase and Notes on the Revelation of St. John." And since, more largely, by Bishop Newton, in his "Dissertation on the Prophecies, which have remarkably been fulfilled, and at this time are fulfilling in the world."</P>
<P>A treatise on the Millennium, however, and of the future state of the church of Christ, from this time to the end of the world, as it is predicted and described in divine revelation, is thought
<PB N="6" REF="025635_0005_0FCEAC0D52DC1448"/>proper and important, not only as it has been more than once re∣ferred to in the preceding work; but as it appears not to be believed by many; and not to be well understood by more; or attended to by most, as an important event; full of instruction; suited to support, comfort and encourage christians, in the present dark appearance of things, respecting the interest of Christ, and his church; and to animate them to faith, patience and persever∣ance in obedience to Christ; putting on the hope of salvation for an helmet. And to excite them more earnestly to pray for the advancement and coming of the kingdom of Christ: Of which kingdom, as it is to take place in this world, or of chris∣tianity itself, there cannot be so clear, full and pleasing an idea, if the scripture doctrine of the Millennium be kept out of view.</P>
<P>In the first three centuries after the Aposties, the doctrine of the Millennium was believed and taught; but so many unwor∣thy and absurd things were by some advanced concerning it, that it afterwards fell into discredit, and was opposed, or pasted over in silence, by most, until the reformation from popery. And then a number of enthusiasts advanced so many unscriptural and ridiculous notions concerning it, and made such a bad improve∣ment of it, that many, if not most of the orthodox, in opposing them, were led to disbelieve and oppose the doctrine in general; or to say little or nothing in favour of the doctrine, in any sense or view of it.</P>
<P>But few of the most noted writers of the last century in Britain, or in other parts of the protestant world, have said any-thing to establish or explain this doctrine: And they who have mentioned it, do appear, at least the most of them, not to have well under∣stood it. In the present century, there has been more attention to it; and the scriptures which relate to it, have been more care∣fully considered, and explained by a number of writers; and it has been set in a more rational, scriptural and important light, than before. Dr. Whitby, has written a treatise on the Millen∣nium. And Mr. Robertson, and Mr. Lowman, have asserted and explained it in some measure, in their exposition of the book of the revelation by the Apostle John; especially the beginning of the twentieth chapter of that book. And the late President Edwards, attended much to this subject, and wrote upon it more than any other divine in this century. In the year 1747, he published a book, entitled "An humble attempt to promote ex∣plicit
<PB N="7" REF="025635_0006_0FCEAC0E81849878"/>agreement, and visible union of God's people, in extraor∣dinary prayer for the revival of religion, and the advancement of Christ's kingdom on earth, pursuant to scripture promises and prophecies concerning the last time." In which he produces the evidence from scripture, that such a day is yet to come. And in a posthumous publication of his, intitled "A history of the work of Redemption," this subject is brought into view, and par∣ticularly considered. There is also extant, a sermon on the Mil∣lennium, by the late Dr. Bellamy. And other writers have occasionally mentioned it. And this subject appears to be brought more particularly into view in the public prayers and preaching, and in conversation, in this age, than in former times; and the doctrine of the Millennium is more generally believed, and better understood.</P>
<P>This is rather an encouragement to attempt farther to explain and illustrate, this important, pleasing, useful subject, in which eve∣ry christian is so much interested, than a reason why nothing more should be said upon it. The subject is far from being exhausted; and as the church advances nearer to the Millennium state, we have reason to think the predictions in divine revelation respecting it, will be better understood; and the minds of christians will be more excited to great attention to this subject, and strong desires to look into those things, and to earnest longings and prayers for the coming of the kingdom of Christ, as it will take place in that day. And all this is to be effected, by means and proper at∣tempts and exertions. "Many shall run to and fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and know∣ledge shall be increased."</P>
<P>The prophecies of events which are yet to take place, cannot be so fully understood before these events come to pass, as they will be when they are fulfilled; and there is great danger of making mistakes about them. And it is certain, that many have made mistakes, since they have made very different and opposite con∣fiructions of the same predictions; and therefore all cannot be right. So far as the prophecies which respect the Millennium, of which there are many, can be understood, and the real mean∣ing of them be made plain, by a careful and diligent attention to them, and comparing them with each other, men may go on safe ground, and be certain of their accomplishment. And whatever is a plain and undeniable consequence, from what is expressly pre∣dicted, is equally revealed in the prediction, as an event, or cir∣cumstance
<PB N="8" REF="025635_0007_0FCEAC10E2D54838"/>of an event, necessarily included in it. But every opinion respecting future events, which is matter of conjecture on∣ly, however probable it may be in the view of him who proposes it, ought to be entertained with modesty and diffidence.</P>
<P>The following treatise on the Millennium, is not designed so much to advance any new sentiments concerning it, which have never before been offered to the public, as to revive and repeat those which have been already suggested by some au∣thors, which are thought to be very important, and ought to be understood, and kept constantly in the view of all, in order to their having a proper conception of the church of Christ in this world, and reading the scriptures to their best advantage, and greatest comfort: Though perhaps something will be advanced, respecting the events which, according to scripture, are to take place between the present time, and the introduction of the happy state of the church, which have not been before so particularly con∣sidered.</P>

<PB N="9" REF="025635_0008_0FCEAC12468904F8"/>
<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> In which it is proved from Scripture, that the church of Christ is to come to a state of prosperity in this world, which it has never yet enjoyed; in which it will con∣tinue at least a thousand years.</HEAD>
<P>THE first revelation of a Redeemer, in the prediction spoken to the serpent, may be considered as implying the destruc∣tion of the kingdom of the devil in this world, by the wisdom and energy of Christ. "He shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heal."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. iii. 18.</NOTE> Satan has bruised the heal of Christ, in the sufferings and dishonour he has been instrumental of bringing upon him, and in the opposition he has made to the interest and church of Christ, in this world. And it is natural to suppose, that Christ shall bruise his head in this world, by destroying his interest and kingdom among men, and gaining a conquest over him, in the struggle and war which has taken place between the Redeemer and seducer of men. And by the Redeemer's <HI>bruising the head</HI> of the serpent, is signified that he will not destroy him by the mere exertion of his power, but that by his superiour wis∣dom, he will confound and defeat satan, in all his subtilty and cunning, on which he depends so much, and by which he aims to disappoint Christ, and defeat him in his designs. And by this he will make a glorious display of his wisdom, as well as of his power, while he discovers the crastiness of satan to be foolishness, and disappoints him in his devices, carrying all the counsel of this cunning froward enemy headlong. If all this could not be gathered from this passage, considered by itself; yet that this is the real meaning, will perhaps appear, from what has already taken place in accomplishing this prediction; and from other prophecies respecting this, some of which are to be brought into view in the sequel: Without which the full meaning of this first promise could not be known.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="025635_0009_0FCEAC13C0599D68"/>
In order to bruise the head of the serpent, in this sense, most effectually; and turn his boasted wisdom and cunning into fool∣ishness, and entirely defeat him in this way, he must have oppor∣tunity and advantage to try his skill and power, and practise all his cunning, in opposing Christ, and the salvation of men. And in this way be overcome and wholly defeated, in the ruin of his interest and kingdom among men; so that all his attempts shall turn against himself, and be the occasion of making the victory and triumph of the Redeemer greater, more perspicuous and glori∣ous, in the final prevalence of his kingdom on earth, by drawing all men to him; and destroying the works and kingdom of satan in this world, and setting up his own on the ruins of it, and so as to turn all the attempts and works of the devil against him, and render the whole subservient to his own interest and kingdom. And thus the coming and kingdom of Christ will be, "As the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain." When the sun rises in a clear morning, af∣ter a dark night, attended with clouds, rain and storms, the morning is more pleasant, beautiful and glorious, and the grass springs and grows more fresh and thrifty, than if it had not been preceded by such a stormy night. So the prosperity and glory of the church, when the sun of righteousness shall rise upon it, with healing in his beams, will be enjoyed to a higher degree, and be more pleasant and glorious, and Christ will be more glorified, than if it had not been preceded by a dreadful night of darkness, con∣fusion and evil, by the wickedness of men, and the power and agency of satan.</P>
<P>The words above cited, are the last words of David the Proph∣et, and sweet Psalmist of Israel, and are a prophecy of the glorious event now under consideration. "The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue. The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake by me. He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God. And he shall be like the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth, by clear shining after rain."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xxiii. 2, 3, 4.</NOTE> The first words may be rendered so as to give the true sense more clearly. "He who is to rule over men (i. e. the Messiah) is just, ruling in the fear of God." The words <HI>must be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
<PB N="11" REF="025635_0010_0FCEAC16102F3BF8"/>in our translation, are not in the original, and the helping verb <HI>is,</HI> which is commonly not expressed, but understood, in the Heb∣rew, should have been supplied; "He that ruleth, or is to rule over men, <HI>is</HI> just." This is evidently a prophecy concerning Christ, his church and kingdom, when he shall take to himself his great power, and reign in his kingdom, which shall succeed the reign of satan during the four preceding monarchies, which were first to take place, which will be more particularly explained, as we proceed in examining the prophecies of this great event, <HI>The latter day glory.</HI> And that these words of David, are a prediction of the reign of Christ on earth, after the long prevalence of satan and wicked men, is farther evident from the words which follow, relative to the same thing. "But the sons of Belial shall <HI>all of them</HI> as thorns be thurst away, because they cannot be taken with hands. But the man that shall touch them, must be fenced with iron, and the staff of a spear, and they shall be utterly burnt with fire in the same place."</P>
<P>Exactly parallel with this prophecy, is that of the Prophet Mali∣chi. "Behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, all that do wickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name, shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth and grow up as the calves in the stall. And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the foles of your feet, in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord of hosts."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal. iv. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>But to return from this, which may seem to be some digression, or anticipation: The great and remarkable promise, so often made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and more than once mentioned by the Apostles, will next be considered. This promise was made to Abraham, and of him, three times. "In thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gen. xii. 3.</NOTE> "All the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him."
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Chap. xviii. 18.</NOTE> "And in thy seed shall the nations of the earth be blessed."
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Chap. xxii. 18.</NOTE> And this same promise is made to Isaac. "I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father—and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed."
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Chap. xxvi. 4.</NOTE> And to Jacob. "In thee and in thy seed, shall all the families of the earth
<PB N="12" REF="025635_0011_0FCEAC178E67D5F0"/>be blessed."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. xxviii. 14.</NOTE> The Apostle Peter mentions this promise as refer∣ring to the days of the gospel. "Ye are the children of the Prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts iii. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> The Apostle Paul speaks of this promise as referring to Christ, and all who believe in him, making him to be the promised seed, and believers in him to be those exclusively who are blessed in him, in whom the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ed good takes place. "Know ye therefore, that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. So then they which be of faith, are blessed with faithful Abraham.— Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ."
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 7, 8, 9, 16.</NOTE></P>
<P>This prediction and promise is very express and extensive, That all the families, kindreds and nations of the earth, should be blessed in Christ, by their becoming believers in him. This has never yet taken place, and cannot be fulfilled, unless christianity and the kingdom of Christ shall take place and prevail in the world to a vastly higher degree, and more extensively and universally, than has yet come to pass; and all nations, all the inhabitants of the earth, shall become believers in him, agreeable to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> number of other prophecies, some of which will be mentioned in this section.</P>
<P>The reign of Christ on earth, with his church and people, and the happiness and glory of that time, is a subject often mentioned, predicted and celebrated in the book of Psalms. To mention all that is there spoken with reference to that happy time, would be to transcribe great part of that book. Only the following passages will now be mentioned, which are thought abundantly to prove that the kingdom of Christ is to prevail and flourish in this world, as it has never yet done; and the church is to be brought to a state of purity, prosperity and happiness on earth, which has not yet taken place, and so as to include all nations, and fill the world.</P>
<P>In the second Psalm, it is predicted and promised, that the Son of God shall inherit and possess all nations, to the ends of the earth; which necessarily implies, that his church and kingdom
<PB N="13" REF="025635_0012_0FCEAC190082D048"/>shall be thus extensive, reaching to the ends of the earth, and in∣cluding all the nations and men on earth. "I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. I will declare the decree: The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine in∣heritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession." By Zion here is meant, as in numerous other places in the proph∣ecies, the church of Christ, of which Mount Zion was a type.</P>
<P>The twenty second Psalm contains a prophecy of the sufferings of Christ; and the glory that shall follow; and of the latter it is said; "The meek shall eat and be satisfied. They shall praise the Lord that seek him: Your heart shall live forever. All the ends of the world shall remember, and turn unto the Lord: And all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. For the kingdom is the Lord's; and he is the Governor among the nations: For evil doers shall be cut off: But those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be; yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be. But the meek shall inherit the earth, and delight themselves in the abundance of peace."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxxvii. 9, 10, 11.</NOTE> This is a prediction of an event which has never taken place yet. Evil doers and the wicked, have in all ages hitherto possessed the earth, and flourished and reigned in the world. When it is promised, that they who wait upon the Lord, and the meek shall inherit the earth, and delight themselves in the abundance of peace, the meaning must be, that persons of this character will yet have the possession of the earth, and fill the world, when no place shall be found for the wicked, as they shall be all destroyed, and their cause wholly lost. And all of this character who have lived be∣fore this time, and waited upon the Lord in the exercise of meek∣ness, shall flourish and live in their successors, and in the prosperity and triumph of the cause and interest, in which they lived and died. This is agreeable to other prophecies of this kind, as will be shewn in the sequel. "All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the Lord: And all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee▪" Who can believe that this has ever yet been? But few of mankind, compared with the whole, have yet turned unto the Lord. By far the greatest part of the nations of the earth, even to the ends of the world, have worshipped and do
<PB N="14" REF="025635_0013_0FCEAC1A81130258"/>now worship false gods, and idols. But when <HI>all the ends of the world</HI> shall remember, and turn to the Lord; and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before him; then the meek shall in∣herit the earth, and delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</P>
<P>The whole of the sixty seventh Psalm is a prediction of the same event, and of the same time, which is yet to come. It is a prayer of the church that such a time may take place; at the same time expressing her assurance that it was coming; and the whole is a prophecy of it. "God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us. That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among <HI>all nations.</HI> Let the people praise thee, O God; let <HI>all the people</HI> praise thee. O let the na∣tions be glad, and sing for joy; for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our God, shall bless us. God shall bless us; and <HI>all the ends of the earth shall fear him.</HI>"</P>
<P>The seventy second Psalm, the title of which is, "A Psalm for Solomon," contains a prophecy of Christ and his kingdom, of whom Solomon was an eminent type. The Psalmist looks beyond the type to the antitype, and says things which can be applied to the latter only, and are not true of the former, considered as dis∣tinct from the latter; which is common in the scripture, in such cases. Here it is said, "He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass; as showers that water the earth. In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth. He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. All kings shall fall down before him: All nations shall serve him. His name shall endure forever: His name shall be continued as long as the sun and moon shall be blessed in him: All nations shall call him blessed. Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who only doth wondrous things. And blessed be his glorious name for∣ever, and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen."</P>
<P>"Arise, O God, judge the earth; for thou shalt inherit all nations."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxxii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> In this Psalm, the rulers and judges among men are accused of unrighteousness, and condemned; and then the Psalm∣ist concludes with the words now quoted, which refer to some future event, in which God should judge the earth, and inherit
<PB N="15" REF="025635_0014_0FCEAC1E0CDCB1B0" MS="y"/>all nations, in a sense in which he had not yet done it. In the second Psalm, the heathen, i. e. the nations, all nations, are given to Christ for his inheritance; and here the same thing is ex∣pressed, "Thou shalt inherit all nations." And by his <HI>judging the earth,</HI> is meant his reigning and subduing the inhabitants of the earth, to a cordial subjection to himself; which will be more evident by what follows, where we shall find the same thing pre∣dicted.</P>
<P>The ninety sixth Psalm, relates wholly to redemption by Christ; to the happiness and glory of his kingdom, and his reign on earth. "O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: <HI>Fear before him, all the earth.</HI> Say among the heathen, that the Lord reigneth: The world also shall be established, that it shall not be moved, he shall judge the people righteously. Let the heavens re∣joice, and let the earth be glad: Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof. Let the field be joyful, and all that is there∣in: Then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord; for he cometh to judge the earth: He shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth." What is here foretold, is to take place before the end of the world, and the general judgment; and it relates to the whole world, all the earth and the nations in it; the kingdom and reign of Christ is to extend to all of them: And his coming to judge the earth, and the world in righteousness, intends his reigning in righteousness, and bringing all nations to share in the blessings of his salvation and kingdom. Agreeable to this, it is said by Christ, by Isaiah and Jeremiah, "Behold a king shall reign <HI>in righteousness.</HI> In those days, and at that time, will I cause the branch of righteous∣ness to grow up unto David, and he shall execute <HI>judgment and righteousness</HI> in the land," or in the earth.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. xxxii. 1. Jer. xxxiii. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>Great part of the prophecy of Isaiah, relates to the flourishing and happy state of the kingdom of Christ, and the prosperity of the church in the latter days. When he foretells the return of the people of Israel from the Babylonish captivity, which was a type of the deliverance of the church of Christ from spiritual Ba∣bylon, and from all her enemies in this world, visible and invisi∣ble, he commonly looks forward to the latter, and keeps that in view, and says things of it, which are not true of the former, and cannot be applied to it. And as Zion, Jerusalem, and Judah, and
<PB N="16" REF="025635_0015_0FCEAC1F04C150D0"/>Israel, were types of the church and kingdom of Christ, as includ∣ing all nations, the former are commonly mentioned only as types, being put for, and sygnifying the latter. And when the gospel day, the coming of Christ, and his church and kingdom, are brought into view, all that is included in these is comprehended; and commonly chief reference is had to the Millennium, or the day of the flourishing of the kingdom of Christ on earth, which is in a peculiar manner, and eminently the day of salvation; and will issue in the complete redemption of the church, at and after the day of judgment. He who reads this prophecy with care and discerning, will be convinced of the truth of these observations; and in any other view, great part of it cannot be understood.</P>
<P>Only part of the many prophecies of the glory and extent of the kingdom of Christ in this world, which are contained in this book, will be now mentioned, as those which are most express and clear, with reference to the subject in view. They who attentive∣ly read this prophecy, will find many more which refer to the same event.</P>
<P>"And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.

And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many people: And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. ii. 2, 3, 4.</NOTE> It is certain, that this prophecy has not been yet fulfilled, except in a very small degree, as the beginning, and first fruits of it.</P>
<P>"And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots. And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord: And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord, and he shall not judge after the fight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hear∣ing of his ears. But with righteousness shall he judge the poor,
<PB N="17" REF="025635_0016_0FCEAC2083509260"/>and reprove with equity, for the meek of the earth: And he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his lips shall he slay the wicked.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. xi. 1—9.</NOTE></P>
<P>This is evidently a prophecy of Christ, and his kingdom on earth. He shall judge and reprove for the meek of the earth, and slay all the wicked on earth, that the meek may inherit it; which is exactly agreeable to the forementioned prophecy in the thirty seventh Psalm. "Evil doers shall be cut off, and yet a little while and the wicked shall not be; but the meek shall inh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>arth; and delight themselves in the abundance of peace." And this universal peace and harmony among men, which shall take place at that time, is expressed in the prophecy before us, in very strong, figurative language; by the wolf dwelling with the lamb, &amp;c.— And the ground and reason of this is given. "For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea." By the knowledge of the Lord is meant true religion, or real christianity, which consists most effentially in benevolence and goodness, as has been shown. So far as this takes place, love, peace, and the most happy concord and union, are promoted; and every thing contrary to this suppressed and banished. Therefore, when this shall take place universally among men, and fill the earth, as the waters cover the sea, there will be nothing to destroy or hurt, but universal safety, peace and love. No such time has ever been yet known. The true knowledge of God has been so far from filling the earth; that gross darkness has covered much the greatest part of it; and real christianity has been confined to narrow bounds; and but very few of mankind have attained to the char∣acter of true christians, even where the gospel has been published. And a horrible scene of oppression, cruelty, war and murder, has
<PB N="18" REF="025635_0017_0FCEAC2477516850"/>spread all over the earth; and will continue to do so, until Christ shall arise and smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and slay the wicked with the breath of his lips; and cause the earth to be filled with the knowledge of God. Such a happy time is yet future, and will certainly come.</P>
<P>The twenty fifth chapter contains a prophecy of the same event, some of which is worthy to be transcribed. "And in this moun∣tain, shall the Lord of hosts make unto <HI>all people</HI> a feast of fat things, a feast of wine on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined. And he will destroy in this mountai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the face of the covering cast over <HI>all people,</HI> and the vail that is spread over <HI>all nations.</HI> He will swallow up death in victory, and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces, and the re∣buke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth; for the Lord hath spoken it. And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will save us: This is the Lord, we have waited for him, we will be glad, and rejoice in his salvation."</P>
<P>The gospel is here represented by a rich feast; and it is promised that all people and nations shall have their eyes opened to see it; and all reproach, and opposition to the church of Christ, shall be taken away from off all the earth; and there shall be universal joy in the salvation, for which the church has long waited, and which shall come in the last day.</P>
<P>"Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: For she hath receiv∣ed of the Lord's hand double for all her sins. The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a high way for our God. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain. And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and <HI>all flesh shall see it together:</HI> For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it."

<P>This is a prophecy of the times of the gospel, as it is thus ap∣plied in the New Testament. It does refer to the first introduc∣tion and the coming of Christ into the world; but is not confined to this: It gives a comprehensive view of this great salvation, and the favour and glory which is to come to the church of Christ in
<PB N="19" REF="025635_0018_0FCEAC26261AD260"/>this world, and looks forward to the day, when the glory of the Lord shall be so revealed that all flesh, that is, all nations, all man∣kind, shall see it together.

<P>From the beginning of the fortieth chapter of Isaiah, to the end of the sixty sixth chapter, with which his prophecy closes, there is almost one continued series of predictions and promises of good, salvation, happiness and glory to the church of Christ, which have principal reference to the latter day when the Millennium shall take place; and when they will have their chief accomplishment. It will be sufficient to answer the end now proposed, to mention the following passages.</P>
<P>Salvation by Christ, is frequently represented as actually extend∣ed <HI>to the ends of the earth,</HI> which has not yet been accomplished. "Look unto me, and be ye saved, <HI>all the ends of the earth;</HI> for I am God, and there is none else. And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayst be my salvation <HI>unto the end of the earth.</HI> The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of <HI>all nations,</HI> and <HI>all the ends of the earth</HI> shall see the salvation of our God."

<P>The sixtieth chapter of Isaiah, is filled with comfort and prom∣ises to the church, as also are the preceding chapters. The fol∣lowing expressions may be particularly noted. "Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people; but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. The Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to thy rising. Therefore, thy gates shall be open continual∣ly, they shall not be shut day nor night, that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles, and that their kings may he

<P>The sixty first chapter of Isaiah, is on the same subject, and the sixty second throughout. Upon such promises made to the church, she breaks forth into joy and praise, in the prospect of the good that is coming to her. "I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation; he hath covered me with the robe of righ∣teousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with jewels. For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth <HI>before all nations.</HI>" "For Zion's sake, I will not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake, I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth. And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: And thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name. I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night.

<P>In the prophecy of Jeremiah, the following passages are found, which predict the utter abolition of idolatry on earth, and the conversion of all nations to christianity, which events have not yet come to pass. "At that time they shall call Jerusalem (i. e. the church) the throne of the Lord (i. e. The Lord shall reign in and by it.) And all nations shall be gathered unto it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the name of the Lord, to Jerusalem; (i. e. shall become members of the church.)

<P>This subject is set in a very clear light in the book of Daniel the Prophet. It is there repeatedly declared that the church, or king∣dom of Christ, shall be the last kingdom on earth; that it shall succeed four preceding monarchies, become great, and fill the world, and exist in a very happy and glorious state on earth. By the dream of Nebuchadnezzar, and the interpretation of it in the second chapter of Daniel, the kingdom of Christ is set in this light. The image which Nebuchadnezzar saw, represents four kingdoms or monarchies, viz. 1. The Babylonian. 2. The Medo Persian, or that of the Medes and Persians. 3. The Macedonian or Grecian. 4. The Roman. These are all to pass away and be destroyed, to make way for a fifth kingdom, which shall be great, and fill the world; which is described in the dream, by the fol∣lowing words: "Thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and break them in pieces. Then were the iron, the clay,
<PB N="22" REF="025635_0021_0FCEAC2B2A9CAD18"/>the brass, the silver and gold, broken to pieces together, and be∣came like the chaff of the summer threshing floors, and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and <HI>filled the whole earth.</HI> This is interpreted by Daniel in the following words: "And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: And the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces, and con∣sume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever. For as much as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver and gold, the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter." That this last kingdom is the kingdom of Christ, there can be no doubt.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Newton on the Prophecies, vol. I. p. 426, 427, &amp;c.</NOTE> The same is called in the New Testament, "The kingdom of God, or the kingdom of heaven." This is to succeed the kingdom of the Romans, and to fill the whole earth, in which all nations, all mankind will be included. The Roman empire or kingdom, is not yet wholly destroyed; therefore what is here predicted of the kingdom of Christ is not yet accomplished, but shall take place in some future day. Nothing can be plainer and more certain than this.</P>
<P>In the seventh chapter of this book there is a representation of the same thing in a vision which Daniel had. He saw the same four empires or kingdoms in their succession, represented by four great, wild, fierce beasts, coming up from the sea. The last king∣dom turned into a little horn which came up last; and Daniel "beheld till this fourth beast with the little horn was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame." And then the vision proceeds, "I saw in the night visions, and beheld, one like the Son of man, come with the clouds of heaven, and came to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages should serve him: His domin∣ion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed." This vision is briefly explained to Daniel in the following words: "These great beasts, which are four, are four kings (i. e. kingdoms) which shall arise out of the earth. But the saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even for∣ever
<PB N="23" REF="025635_0022_0FCEAC2C81EFE538"/>and ever." Daniel requested a more particular explanation of the fourth beast, and of the ten horns, and of the little horn, "Even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows. And the same horn made war with the saints and prevailed against them; until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom." And he is then told, "That the fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth. And the ten horns out of this kingdom, are ten kings that shall arise: And another shall rise after them, and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings. And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws: And they shall be given in∣to his hand, until a time, and times, and the dividing of time. But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it to the end. <HI>And the kingdom and domin∣ion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High,</HI> whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him."</P>
<P>As in Nebuchadnezzar's dream, so in this vision, the fifth and last kingdom, is the kingdom of Christ, consisting wholly of saints. It is Jesus Christ whom Daniel saw, "And behold, one like to the Son of man, came with the clouds of heaven. And there was given him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations and languages should serve him." His kingdom and do∣minion is universal, including all the inhabitants of the earth. And these shall be all saints or holy persons; as no others can be the proper subjects of this kingdom. "The saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever. And the kingdom, and dominion, and the greatness of the king∣dom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High." The strongest expressions are used and repeated, to assert the universality of this kingdom, comprehend∣ing all mankind who shall then live on earth. And it is repeat∣edly declared, that this kingdom shall stand forever. It shall not be destroyed by any succeeding power or kingdom, as the former kingdoms were, but shall continue to the end of the world, and then be removed to heaven, to a more perfect and glorious state; and there exist and flourish in the highest perfection forever and ever.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="025635_0023_0FCEAC2E00208C08"/>
The little horn which was on the beast, and destroyed with the beast, whose body was given to the burning flame, is the Pope of Rome, with the kingdom and power, civil and ecclesiastical, of which he is the head.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is abundantly proved in Newton's Dissertation on the Prophecies, vol. I. page 441—492.</NOTE> This beast with this horn, is not yet de∣stroyed. When this is done, the kingdom and power of sin and satan in the world will fall; and then the kingdom of Christ will rise and fill the world, as is predicted here, and in the second chap∣ter of this book. This is very evident by these prophecies, if there were no other; but this truth is greatly illustrated and establish∣ed, by those predictions of the same event which have been con∣sidered; and more so, by those which are yet to be mentioned.</P>

<P><PB N="25" REF="025635_0024_0FCEAC3106F138C0"/>
This is a prophecy of the Millennium state, in figurative lan∣guage. Then, in the moral world, the church, there shall be no night or darkness; no change or day and night, as there was be∣fore, when the church was in a state of affliction, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her days of prosperity were short, and soon succeeded by darkness and night of degeneracy and affliction: But at the time when night used to come on, it shall be day; so that it shall be constantly light and day, and the enjoyment of prosperity, light and holiness, without interruption. And there shall be a constant flow of living waters, without any interruption, into all parts of the earth, among all nations; that is spiritual blessings, consisting in spiritual life, holy joy and happiness. And then all idolatry and false worship shall be wholly abolished; and Christ shall reign in all the earth, and all nations shall trust in him, and obey him. This prediction agrees exactly with all those which have been mentioned, pointing out the same important glorious event.</P>
<P>THE prophecies in the New Testament, foretold the universal spread of christianity, until all nations shall become the servants of Christ; and that Christ and his people shall reign on earth a thousand years; when satan shall be cast out of the earth, and his subjects and kingdom shall be destroyed; agreeable to the nu∣merous prophecies in the Old Testament, which have been mentioned.</P>
<P>Jesus Christ has foretold this, by the following parables.— "Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field. Which indeed is the least of all seeds: But when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree; so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. Another parable spake he unto them, The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xiii. 31, 32, 33.</NOTE> By the first of those parables Christ teaches, that his church and kingdom, though small in the beginning of it, should increase and become great in the world. In the next, he makes an advance, and more fully predicts the universal extent of this kingdom; that the gospel shall not cease to spread and influence the world, till all mankind, living on earth, the whole world, shall be formed by it, and imbibe
<PB N="26" REF="025635_0025_0FCEAC3284048C98"/>the spirit of it; so as to become the children of this kingdom. If the kingdom of heaven shall not finally prevail and extend to all nations, and fill the whole world, how can this parable be a just or true representation of it? In this view of it, it agrees exactly with many of the prophecies which have been mentioned; and with others, which are yet to be considered.</P>
<P>Agreeable to this, are the following words of Christ, in which indeed he asserts the same thing, "Now is the judgment of this world: Now shall the prince of this world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh: xii. 31, 32.</NOTE>— What is here foretold by Christ, is not yet accomplished, except in a very small part, as the first fruits and pledge of the whole.— A foundation for this was laid in the death of Christ, when he was lifted up on the cross; but the prince of this world, the devil, is not yet cast out of the world; nor has Christ yet drawn all men unto him. Christ has drawn great numbers to him, who have become his faithful subjects and servants, and has made great in∣roads upon the interest and kingdom of the prince of this world; but very few of mankind, compared with the whole, have been drawn to Christ; by far the greatest number even in the chris∣tian world, have rejected and opposed him; and the kingdom of satan has been great and strong, including the most of men who have lived in the world, from the time in which these words were spoken by Christ, to this day. Both of these events are therefore yet future, and the former is to make way for the latter; or rather one is included in the other. The same things which are here foretold, are predicted in different words, in the twentieth chapter of the Revelation, which will be considered. When Christ says, He will draw <HI>all men</HI> unto him, he does not mean that every one of mankind shall come unto him; for this is contrary to known fact; and to many express declarations of Christ. But that in conse∣quence of his death, the kingdom of satan shall be utterly destroyed on earth, and then all nations, even all men then in the world, shall become his voluntary subjects, and believe in him.</P>
<P>This was suited to support and comfort his disciples and friends at that time, when he had been speaking of his own death as at hand, in the view of the glory that should follow his dying on the cross: and served to explain what was spoken by the voice from
<PB N="27" REF="025635_0026_0FCEAC3401736238"/>heaven, in answer to his petition, "Father, glorify thy name."— "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Verse 28.</NOTE></P>
<P>What the Apostle Paul says in the eleventh chapter of his epistle to the Romans, of the Jews and Gentiles, which compre∣hend all mankind, holds forth this same truth. He there speaks of the Jews who were then, the most of them, broken off from the church by unbelief, as yet to come into the kingdom of Christ, even all of them, which he terms their <HI>fulness.</HI> And he says, that when they shall in their fulness be brought in, the fulness of the Gen∣tiles shall come in also. The fulness of the Jews, and the fulness of the Gentiles, must include the whole of all nations. And he speaks of what had taken place in the days of the Apostles, in the conversion of Jews and Gentiles, as only the first fruits, the root, foundation and beginning, of the whole lump, and the tree which were to follow in the coming in of the Jews and Gentiles, of the whole world, in the fulness thereof.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Verses 12, 16, 25.</NOTE></P>
<P>This leads to recollect the many prophecies by the ancient Prophets, of the restoration of the Jews to a state of holiness and happiness, in the last days, which has not yet come to pass, some of which it may be proper to mention here, as they serve to con∣firm the point under consideration. The thirty fourth, thirty sixth, and thirty seventh chapters of Ezekiel, relate chiefly to this event. Though the return of the Jews from their captivity in Babylon, may be implied in this prophecy, and some expressions may have particular reference to that; yet it evidently looks far∣ther, to a deliverance and salvation, of which their return from Babylon was a type or pledge: And there are many things pre∣dicted, which cannot be applied to the former, and were not true of it. Particularly the following: "I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed them, even my servant David: And he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. One king shall be king to them all. And I will cleanse them, so shall they be my people, and I will be their God. And David, my servant, shall be king over them, and they all shall have one shepherd. They shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them. And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt, and they shall dwell therein, even they and their children, and their childrens'
<PB N="28" REF="025635_0027_0FCEAC35A95C7C58"/>children forever, and my servant David, shall be their prince for∣ever."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. xxxiv. 23. xxxvii. 22, 23, 24, 25.</NOTE> By David, Jesus Christ the Son of David is meant, as the former was an eminent type of the latter. Therefore this must refer to their restoration and happy state under Christ, which is certainly not yet come; but will take place, when there shall be one fold, and one shepherd, and Jews and Gentiles shall be united in one church under the Redeemer, which, after the Millennium, shall be transplanted from earth to heaven; where the spiritual David will reign over it forever.</P>
<P>The same is foretold by the Prophet Hosea. "The children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim. Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the Lord their God, and David their king, and shall fear the Lord, and his goodness in the latter days."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Chap. iii. 4, 5.</NOTE>— The children of Israel are now in the state here described, without a king, and without a prince; without a sacrifice; for their tem∣ple is destroyed, and they cannot go to Jerusalem, and their law forbids them to sacrifice in any other place. They are without an image, without an ephod and teraphim; for they have a great and obstinate aversion from all kinds of idolatry, to which they were once so much addicted. They have been a long time, many days, in this state, and will continue so, until they return, and seek Jesus Christ their king, and submit to him, which is yet to come.</P>
<P>These prophecies, and others of the same kind, if they be con∣sidered as having reference to the Jews exclusively, and not includ∣ing the whole church of Christ, in the latter day, composed of Jews and Gentiles, do prove that there is yet to be a time, when the church of Christ shall be universal, and include all nations: For it appears from what St. Paul says, that when those prophe∣cies shall be fulfilled to the Jews, the fulness of the Gentiles will also come in, and all men in every nation will be subject to Christ, and his kingdom shall be glorious, and fill the world. And in this sense "All Israel shall be saved."</P>
<P>IN the revelation made by Jesus Christ to the Apostle John, the final victory and triumph of the church on earth, over all her ene∣mies, and the happy state to which it will be brought, which shall
<PB N="29" REF="025635_0028_0FCEAC37DDF0FA60"/>continue a thousand years, is, in some respects, more clearly set forth, than in the preceding prophecies; by which they are illus∣trated, and their meaning is more fully fixed and confirmed. Here the general state and circumstances of the church, from the time when the revelation was given, to this time, and down to the end of the world, are predicted. Here the afflictions and per∣secutions, through which the church should pass; the respite which she should have, and victory over the persecuting power of hea∣then Rome, in the days of Constantine; the grand apostacy which should take place in the church by the rise of the Pope, and the hierarchy of the false church of Rome; the gross idolatry which should be practised in that church; and the violent opposition of this power to the true followers of Christ; their cruel persecutions of them, and shedding their blood, for a thousand two hundred and sixty years; the judgments that should be executed on that corrupt church and her adherents, and on the whole world, for their obstinacy in wickedness; and the final overthrow of the Pope and all who support him, and of the kingdom of satan in the world, and the deliverance of the church of Christ into a state of rest and peace, when this kingdom of Christ shall increase and spread, and fill the world; and continue in this happy state on earth a thousand years: All this is foretold; much of which is already come to pass; but the most happy and glorious events are yet to come. The great and remarkable things which have come to pass, as they were foretold, are a standing, incontestible evidence and demonstration, that the prophecies in this book are from heaven: For it is as certain, that none but the omniscient God can know and predict such events, which take place accord∣ing to the prediction, as it is that this world was made by him. And the events which are come to pass, and are now taking place in the world before our eyes, agreeable to the prophecies in this book, at the same time that they prove that those predictions are from God, are also a pledge and assurance, that the prophecies of things not yet come, will be fulfilled in due season.</P>
<P>The subject now in hand, will lead more particularly to con∣sider what are the prophecies in this book, which relate to the future prosperity of the church and kingdom of Christ in this world, in which all the darkness and afflictions which do attend it, being oppressed and trodden down by enemies, while they prevail
<PB N="30" REF="025635_0029_0FCEAC3943453438"/>and triumph, shall issue; and to show that such a day is certainly coming, according to the predictions which are to be found here.</P>
<P>In the fifth chapter of the Revelation, the four and twenty elders, who represent the church, appear rejoicing and praising Christ in the prospect of their reigning on the earth. "And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: For thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and priests: <HI>And we shall reign on the earth.</HI>" This is spoken of <HI>the church,</HI> and is not literally true of every particular member of it, that then actually existed in heaven, or on earth. When the church shall reign on earth, consisting of the numerous members who shall then exist in this world; all those who are gone out of the world, and are in heaven, will reign in and with the church on earth, as members of the same society and kingdom; and will partake in all the joy and glory of this event, in a much higher de∣gree than if they were personally on earth. They will reign in their successors, who represent them, and in the prevalence, victory and triumph of that cause, which is theirs, and in which they lived and died. But this will be more particularly considered hereafter.</P>
<P>"And the seventh angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. x. 15.</NOTE> Here it is asserted, that under the seventh trumpet, which contains all the events from the time of its sounding, to the end of the world, all the nations and kingdoms in this world shall become one kingdom, under Christ, and shall be wholly swallowed up in this kingdom, which shall not be succeeded or give place to any other kingdom; but shall stand forever. It shall continue the only kingdom on earth to the end of the world, and exist forever in heaven. Which is perfectly agreeable to many other prophecies which have been mentioned. The mean∣ing is not, that this event shall follow immediately upon the sound∣ing of the seventh trumpet; but that this is comprehended in the events of this trumpet, to which all the preceding have respect, and in which they shall issue, as the most important and glorious
<PB N="31" REF="025635_0030_0FCEAC3AE5D6D038"/>event, to which all the inhabitants of heaven were attending, and in the prospect of which they had peculiar joy.</P>
<P>The same event is celebrated in heaven, as having actually taken place, in the former part of the nineteenth chapter. "And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Hallelujah! for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth: Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. And to her was granted, that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: For the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. And he said unto me, Write, Blessed are they who are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God." Here the Lord Jesus Christ is repre∣sented as reigning, as he never had done before; which is the same event which is so often predicted in the Psalms, and by the Prophets, especially by Daniel, by the Lord's reigning, that is Christ. And which is mentioned and celebrated in the tenth chapter; and in the twentieth chapter; "And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them, and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years." By the bride having made herself ready, and being arrayed in fine linen, clean and white, is meant the eminent degree of holiness and moral beauty, to which the church will arrive at that day, in the Millennium state. This is represented as taking place upon the fall of antichrist, and the great whore, the false idolatrous church of Rome. And it succeeds the overthrow of satan's kingdom in the world, and not only the destruction of the Roman empire un∣der antichrist, but of all the nations of wicked men; which is de∣scribed in the sixteenth chapter, verse seventeenth, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And the same event is again represented in the latter part of the nineteenth chapter, and in the beginning of the twentieth. "And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse: And he that sat upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war." From the following description it appears, that this person is Jesus Christ prepared, and going forth to de∣stroy his enemies on earth. And an angel is seen standing in the sun, in the most conspicuous place, calling with a loud voice upon all the fowls of the air to come "to the supper of the great God,"
<PB N="32" REF="025635_0031_0FCEAC3D6EC0DF40"/>to eat the flesh of kings and captains, &amp;c. and the flesh of <HI>all men,</HI> both free and bond, both small and great. And he saw the beast and the kings of the earth, and their armies <HI>gathered together,</HI> to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army." And the beast and false prophet were destroyed by him; and the remnant of those who joined with the beast and were enemies to Christ, were slain by him. This battle, and the destruction of the enemies of Christ, does not follow in time, and is not to take place after the events mentioned in the first part of this chapter, viz. the joy and praise in heaven, upon the reigning of Christ on earth, and the bride, the Lamb's wife, making herself ready, &amp;c. but is a repeated and more particular representation of what is to precede that happy event, which had been before mentioned in the sixteenth chapter, from the thirteenth verse to the end of it. There the kings of the earth, and the whole world, are said to be <HI>gath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red together to battle;</HI> "The battle of the great day of God Almighty." So here "The beast and the kings of the earth, and their armies, are <HI>gathered together to make war</HI> against him that sat on the horse." And there the battle is described as coming on, upon the pouring out of the seventh vial, and great Babylon, which is the same with the beast, and the false prophet, and all the enemies of Christ, are destroyed in battle. Which is exactly paral∣lel with the war and battle of which there is a more particular de∣scription in the nineteenth chapter, and must be one and the same event. This is confirmed, by what immediately follows this de∣struction of the enemies of Christ, in the beginning of the twentieth chapter, which, as has been observed, is the same event with that described in the nineteenth chapter by the marriage of the Lamb, whose bride, that is the church, was made ready, and arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. A more particular and remarkable description of this same thing, in the twentieth chapter, is in the following words.</P>
<P>"And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit, and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the devil and satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit, and sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should de∣ceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfill∣ed: And after that, he must be loosed a little season. And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto
<PB N="33" REF="025635_0032_0FCEAC3E8756E800"/>them. And I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands: And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection. On such the second death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God, and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years."</P>
<P>A particular explanation of this passage of scripture will be at∣tempted in the next section. That it does express and confirm the truth which is contained in the numerous prophecies which have been mentioned, and which is set up to be proved in this section, the following observations will show.</P>
<P N="1">1. This event here predicted, is to take place after the overthrow of the Roman antichristian kingdom, and the destruction of all the enemies of Christ and his church on earth. This is evident from the account of the destruction of these in the prophecy im∣mediately preceding these words, and upon which the glorious scene opened in this passage, is to take place. And the same is predicted in the last part of the sixteenth chapter, as has been shown. This is agreeable to the prophecies of the same event, in the Psalms, and by Daniel, and others, viz. that the time of the reign of Christ, and of the saints on earth, shall succeed the destruc∣tion of the wicked, and the total overthrow of all the preceding kingdoms and powers in the world, which has been from time to time observed upon them, when they were transcribed. And in this very passage, satan himself is represented as bound, and cast out of the earth, and shut up in the bottomless pit, antecedent to the reign of Christ, and his followers, in the world; which necessarily implies the total ruin of his cause and kingdom on earth, and the extirpation of all the wicked, who are his children and servants. Therefore, the time here predicted, is not yet come.</P>
<P N="2">2. All this is to take place before the end of the world, and the day of judgment. This is very evident and certain, since it is said, that when this happy time of a thousand years is ended, satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth: And then, after this, Christ is represented as coming to judgment, of which
<PB N="34" REF="025635_0033_0FCEAC402C479A10"/>there is a particular account; and of the final and eternal destruc∣tion of all his enemies.</P>
<P N="3">3. Christ is here said to reign, and his saints to reign with him, which, without any doubt, is the same event, and the same period, which is foretold by Daniel and other Prophets, as a most happy and joyful time, when that nation and those men who will not serve Jesus Christ, shall be destroyed; and there shall be given to him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages should serve him. And the kingdom and domin∣ion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the saints of the Most High, and all dominions shall serve him. And the extent and univers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lity of the kingdom of Christ, and of those who reign with him, as including all na∣tions and all men, is supposed and implied in his binding satan and casting him out, "that he should <HI>deceive the nations no more,</HI> till the thousand years should be fulfilled." Satan is said to de∣ceive the whole world.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. xii. 9.</NOTE> And when he is cast out of the whole world, Jesus Christ and his people will take possession of it, and reign in all the earth.</P>
<P N="4">4. Christ and his people are to reign on earth A THOUSAND YEARS.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hence this time is called the MILLENNIUM, which signifies a thousand years.</NOTE> All have not been agreed in the length of time denoted here by a thousand years. Some have supposed that a thousand years, is used indefinitely, not to express any precise number of years, but a great number of years, or a long time. But this can∣not reasonably be admitted as the sense of the expression here, since this precise number of years, is mentioned six times in this passage, which appears inconsistent with its being used in such an indefinite, vague sense. And besides, there is nothing in the connection here, or in the nature or circumstances of the case, to lead any one to understand this number, as put indefinitely.</P>
<P>There are others who suppose, that these are to be understood to be a thousand prophetical years, that is, as many years as there are days in a thousand literal years, a day being put for a year.— According to this way of reckoning, a thousand years are put for three hundred and sixty thousand years; for in that age, a year was reckoned to consist of three hundred and sixty days. It is said, that in this book of Revelation, a day is constantly put for a year. A thousand, two hundred and sixty days, mean so many
<PB N="35" REF="025635_0034_0FCEAC4257BD1660"/>years, and forty two months, mean as many years, as there are days in so many months, reckoning thirty days to each month, as they then did; which therefore amount to the same number of years, i. e. one thousand, two hundred and sixty years. And a time and times, and half a time, i. e. three years and an half, mean as many years as there are days in three years and an half; which are just as many as there are in forty two months; that is, one thousand, two hundred and sixty years. It is therefore con∣cluded, that these thousand years, must be understood in the same way; that is, that a day is put for a year; which will amount to three hundred and sixty thousand years.</P>
<P>It is acknowledged that this supposition is supported by some colour of argument, and plausibility: But there are objections to it, some of which will be mentioned.</P>
<P N="1">1. It does by no means follow that these are prophetical years, in the sense mentioned, because a day is put for a year, in other places in this prophecy. There may be reasons for putting a day for a year, in other instances; and yet there be no reason for put∣ting a thousand years for as many years as there are days in a thousand years, in this instance; and therefore no reason for un∣derstanding them so. And a day is not put for a year in every other instance in this book. The dead bodies of the two witnesse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are said to lie in the street of the city, three days and an half,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. xi. 11.</NOTE> which do not mean three years and an half, as no event respecting them can be made consistent with such a meaning.</P>
<P N="2">2. The number, <HI>a thousand years,</HI> being repeated so many times in one short paragraph, seems to be a reason that it is to be under∣stood literally, for just so many years, and not so many prophetical years. Especially, as there is nothing in this case to lead us to understand it in the latter sense; but it may, as consistently with every thing in this book, and this prophecy in particular, and more so, as will be now observed, be understood literally. And it is farther to be observed, that there is no instance in this book, or in the whole Bible, where a precise number is so often repeated in the same words, that is not to be understood literally.</P>
<P N="3">3. It seems to be out of all proper proportion, to suppose there will be so long a time as three hundred and sixty thousand years of prosperity and happiness, and of great and universal holiness in this world, the habitation of an apostate, sinful race of men; and
<PB N="36" REF="025635_0035_0FCEAC43BAAD8BA0"/>but six thousand years of evil times. And this does not appear consistent with this world being represented as an <HI>evil world,</HI> as it is in the scripture: Or with its being cursed in consequence of man's rebellion. One thousand years may be an exception out of seven thousand, in which the curse may be mitigated, and in a great measure removed; and yet, on the whole, or the whole taken together, it may be considered and called, an evil and accursed world, for man's sake. But if there were to be only six thousand years of evil and the curse, and three hundred and sixty thousand years of good and a blessing, it would not, on the whole, be an evil or cursed, but a happy and blessed world.</P>
<P N="4">4. It has been observed, that the natural world is evidently a designed type or shadow of the moral world, especially of the re∣demption by Christ. And that creating it in six days, and then resting on the seventh, is designed to be a type of bringing the moral world in the work of redemption, to a state of rest; that there are to be six thousand years in which every thing with re∣spect to redemption and the kingdom of Christ, is to be done and prepared, for a seventh thousand years of peace and rest, and joy in this glorious work. And it will be shown in the sequel, that there are institutions in the Mosaic ritual, which point out the same thing. The Apostle Peter seems to allude to this, when speaking of the coming of Christ, and the end of the world. "But beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise; but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night," &amp;c.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Peter iii. 8, 9, 10.</NOTE> Hence the constant revolu∣tion of weeks, consisting of seven days, is an emblem of the revo∣lution of time, which will come to an end, when the world has existed seven thousand years. And there has been a tradition among both Jews and Christians, agreeable to this sentiment.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"There is an old tradition both among Jews and Christians, that at the end of six thousand years, the Messiah shall come, and the world shall be renewed, the reign of the wicked one shall cease, and the reign of the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a upon earth shall begin." Newton's Dissertations on the Prophecies. Vol. I. Page 490.— And again, Vol. III. Page 410.—"According to tradition, these thousand years of the reign of Christ and the saints, will be the seventh m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lennary of the world; for as God created the world in six days, and rested on the seventh, so the world, it is argued, will continue six thousand years, and the seventh thou∣sand will be the great <HI>sabbatism,</HI> or holy rest, to the people of God: <HI>One day being with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</HI>"— <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Peter iii. 8.</NOTE>—
<PB N="37" REF="025635_0036_0FCEAC459B786110"/>Now, this sentiment and tradition suppose, that the thousand years of the Millennium, is but one literal thousand years, or the seventh part of the time in which the world is to stand. And as far as there is any weight in them, oppose and overthrow the notion that the world will not come to an end, till it has existed three hundred and sixty thousand years, after the Millennium shall begin.</P>
<P N="5">5. All the ends of such a day of peace and prosperity, of victory, triumph and salvation to the church on earth, and of the so much celebrated reign of Christ with his saints, in this world, will be fully answered in a literal thousand years, so far as it can be learned what they are, from scripture; or man can conceive them to be; as much and as fully answered, as they could be in hundreds of thou∣sands of years, or in any supposed length of time.</P>
<P>Satan will be as much defeated, and his kingdom and interest wholly destroyed in the world; the cause of wickedness, and evil men, will be entirely ruined and lost, and they all banished from the earth. The wisdom, power, grace, truth and faithfulness of Christ will have a proper and glorious manifestation, by intro∣ducing such a state, and continuing it as long as is most for his glory, and the best good of his church, though it shall continue but a thousand years. The church may have all the reward and enjoyment in that time, that it is proper or desirable that it should have on earth; and it may be wisest and best, then to take it to a more perfect, happy and glorious state in heaven. A thousand years will be time enough for Christ to show what he can do, in bringing good out of evil, and vindicating his cause and church, and triumphing gloriously over all opposition from earth and hell, and filling the world with his powerful presence and kingdom, with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord; with holiness and happiness. There will be full opportunity in this time, to show and demonstrate, from fact and abundant experience, what is the nature, beauty and excellence of christianity; that it is exactly suited to form the world into a state of love, union and happiness; and that all the preceding evils among mankind have been chiefly owing to ignorance or neglect of Christ, and the true spirit of christianity, and opposition to those in life or heart, or both. And this will be time enough to show, that all means are ineffectual to
<PB N="38" REF="025635_0037_0FCEAC47E3460780"/>reclaim man from sin; and that this can be effected by nothing but the spirit of God, poured down in plentiful effusions; and to give a sample and foretaste of the beauty, happiness and glory of the holy society and redeemed church in heaven.</P>
<P>And in this thousand years the work of redemption, and salva∣tion, may be fully accomplished, in the utmost extent and glory of it. In this time, in which the world will be soon filled with real christians, and continue full, by constant propagation, to supply the place of those who will leave the world; there will be many thou∣sands born and live on earth, to each one that had been born and lived in the preceding six thousand years. So that if they who shall be born in that thousand years, shall be all, or most of them, saved, as they will be, there will, on the whole, be many thousands of mankind saved, to one that shall be lost.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Beliamy's Sermon on the Millennium.</NOTE></P>
<P>The only end that can be imagined would be answered by pro∣tracting this time of the prosperity of the church in this world, is, that greater numbers of mankind might exist, and be saved. But that this is really desirable or best, all things considered, there is not the least evidence. A desire that more of mankind should be saved than will be saved, in a thousand years of the prevalence of holiness and salvation, in all the families of the earth, never could be satisfied: For though three hundred and sixty thousand years should be added, and all should be saved who lived in that time; still, for the same reason that this is desired, it will be equally de∣sirable, and more so, that the time of salvation should be lengthen∣ed out yet longer; and so on without end. This reason for making the time longer, that more may be saved, cannot cease; and a desire of more time, on this ground, or for this reason, is like the four things which Solomon mentions as never satisfied, and say not it is enough. It is most wise and best, that a certain number and proportion of mankind should be saved: And God only knows what this number is, how great, and what proportion it bears to the whole human race. And no man has any reason to think, that this number will not be compleated within a literal thousand years, after the Millennium commences. Nor can there be the least evidence from any quarter, that it will not, unless there be evidence that the Millennium contains a longer time; which is the question under consideration. And it is supposed
<PB N="39" REF="025635_0038_0FCEAC4906621820"/>that no evidence of this has yet been produced, or can be at pre∣sent: And it is certain, that the salvation of more of mankind, were the time to be longer, is no reason why it should be longer. But this will be best, and most infallibly decided by the event which will take place in due season: Which perhaps cannot be deter∣mined with certainty now, or so that all shall be satisfied and a∣greed in the matter. And it may not be wise to be very confi∣dent on either side of the question.</P>
<P>THE evidence has now been produced from scripture, that there is a time coming, in which the cause of Christ shall prevail in this world; and his kingdom spread and fill the earth, as it has never yet done; in which time, the church and people of Christ shall come to a state of peace and prosperity; when the kingdom of satan shall be utterly destroyed; and all wicked men shall be put down, and cast out of the earth, and there shall be none to destroy, hurt or oppose the truth and ways of Christ, or his people: And this happy, glorious day shall last a thousand years.</P>
<P>This is foretold, not by one single prophecy, but is repeatedly and abundantly mentiond in the sacred, prophetic writings, and represented by a variety of strong expressions, and by different similitudes, and in figurative language: And yet all perfectly a∣gree to point out the same thing. And there are many prophe∣cies of the same event, by Isaiah, and in other parts of the Bible, which have not been particularly mentioned.</P>
<P>Nothing has yet taken place in favour of the church of Christ, and in opposition to his enemies, which is in any measure answer∣able to these predictions. By far the greater part of mankind have been in a state of ignorance of christianity, or of opposition to it, ever since the gospel has been preached to men; and satan has had a greater and stronger kingdom on earth, than Christ, most of the time since his ascension. And sin, and real opposition to Christ, in principle and practice, have abounded in every age, even among nominal christians. The overthrow of the Jews by the Romans, and the consequent spread of christianity among the Gentiles, were events favourable to the church of Christ, and were a pledge and type of what he will yet do, in overthrowing his enemies and delivering his church, in the latter days. And so was the overthrow of heathen Rome, and the spread and preva∣knce of christianity through all the Roman empite, in the days
<PB N="40" REF="025635_0039_0FCEAC4A80478C68"/>of the Emperor Constantine, in the fourth century. But this was of short continuance, and within twenty years the church fell into a state of great calamity, by divisions, contentions, and he∣resies; and the empire was involved in confusion and war. And from that time to this, the church has been in a low, afflicted state. The many promises made to Israel by the prophets, of res∣toration to a long abiding state of obedience, holiness and prosperi∣ty, have not been in any measure fulfilled to that nation, nor to the church, including Jews and Gentiles, represented and typified by Israel, Jerusalem, Mount Zion, &amp;c. If such a day of prosperity of the church of Christ, comprehending Jews and Gentiles, and all nations, were not yet to come, great part of the prophecies in the Bible could have but a very low and little mean∣ing, and would be in a great measure, if not wholly, useless: Whereas, if they be understood according to the most natural, plain import of them, they open a most pleasing, wonderful scene, suited to support and animate the christian, and fill him with gra∣titude and joy, on the agreeable prospect.</P>
<P>It appears reasonable and desirable, that Jesus Christ, who suf∣fered shame and reproach in this world, and was condemned and put to death as a malefactor, by men, should have this reproach wiped off in the fight of all m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and that the cause in which he suffered and died, should prevail and be victorious in this same world, where he suffered and died: That he should, agreeably to ancient prophecies, be here on earth, "Exalted, and extolled, and be very high. As many were astonished at him (his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men) so shall he sprinkle many nations, and kings shall shut their mouths at him: For that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard, shall they con∣sider. He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied. He shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death; and was numbered with the transgres∣sors."

<P>And it appears very desirable, that the enemies of Christ and his church, should meet with disappointment, be defeated and confounded in this world, and that the reproach which has been cast upon the church should be removed: That the church should put on her beautiful garments, and shine in the true beauties of
<PB N="41" REF="025635_0040_0FCEAC4CB0BE68A8"/>christianity: That it should be seen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om experiment in this world, what christianity is, when acted out, according to the true nature and spirit of it; and that this, and this only, can render men and society happy in this state. All this is therefore predict∣ed, and promised. "Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee, and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out, and I will get them praise and fame in every land, where they have been put to shame: For I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth."

<P>One reason why this day of salvation is delayed so long after the death and resurrection of Christ, doubtless is, that there may be proper and full opportunity to discover the depravity and wicked∣ness of man, and the insufficiency of all means that can be used, or methods taken, to bring men to repentance, and a cordial sub∣mission to Christ, unless accompanied by the special, omnipotent influences of the Holy Spirit, to renew their hearts: And clearly to manifest the natural enmity in the hearts of mankind against Christ, and the truths of the gospel, and their strong disposition, and unconquerable by all possible external means and advantages, to oppose, and pervert the gospel, and abuse it to the worst pur∣poses; that it may appear in the most clear and striking light, how greatly and wholly depraved, and utterly lost, men are, unless they be saved by the washing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost; and that the whole praise and glory of the salvation of every one, may be ascribed to the sovereign grace of Christ, and man be forever abased. When God has sufficiently tried men, and used a variety of the most proper and powerful means to bring the world to repentance, and all has proved in vain, he will then pour out his spirit upon all, and renew their hearts, and converts will spring up as grass after showers of rain; and the obstinacy of man, and the power and sovereign grace of Christ, will be ac∣knowledged by all; and that men are saved, not by human might or power, but by the spirit of the Lord.

<P>And it appears proper and wife, that this day of prosperity and salvation, should be in the latter end of the world, in the last times, as this is suited to excite and support the faith and patience of christians, who live in the preceding dark and evil times; and to encourage and animate them to faithfulness and constancy, in fol∣lowing Christ, and adherence to his cause, in the midst of tempta∣tions
<PB N="42" REF="025635_0041_0FCEAC4D8250C218"/>and trials; and this use is made of it in the scripture, es∣pecially in the book of Revelation. And this is suited to excite the prayers of christians in all the preceding ages of darkness, affliction and suffering, and the prevalence of sin, and satan, for the coming and kingdom of Christ; which he has prescribed as the first and most important petition in the pattern of prayer which he has given. "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. <HI>Thy kingdom come.</HI> Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven." Daniel was excited and encouraged to fast and pray for the deliverance of the people of God, from their affliction and distress in their captivity, by finding that this was foretold and promised by Jeremiah the Prophet.

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> In which it is considered, in what the Millennium will consist, and what will be the peculiar happiness and glory of that day, according to Scripture.</HEAD>
<P>THERE have been, and still are, very different opin∣ions, respecting the Millennium, and the events which will take place in that day; which are grounded chiefly on the six first verses in the twentieth chapter of the Revelation, which passage has been brought into view, in the preceding section; but is to be more particicularly considered in this.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="025635_0042_0FCEAC4F0444C9E8"/>
Some have supposed, that this passage is to be taken literally, as importing that at that time, Jesus Christ will come in his human nature, from heaven to earth; and set his kingdom up here, and reign visibly, and personally, and with distinguished glory on earth. And that the bodies of the martyrs, and other eminent christians, will then be raised from the dead, in which they shall live and reign with Christ here on earth, a thousand years. And some suppose, that all the saints, the true friends to God and Christ, who have lived before that time, will then be raised from the dead, and live on earth perfectly holy, during this thousand years. And this they suppose, is meant by the first resurrection. Those who agree in general in this notion of the Millennium, differ with re∣spect to many circumstances, which it is needless to mention here.</P>
<P>Others have understood this paragraph of scripture, in a figura∣tive sense. That by this reign of Christ on earth, is not meant his coming from heaven to earth, in his human, visible nature; but his taking to himself his power, and utterly overthrowing the kingdom of satan, and setting up his own kingdom in all the world, which before this had been confined to very narrow bounds; and subduing all hearts to a willing subjection, and thus reigning over all men, who shall then be in the world, and live in that thou∣sand years. And by "The souls of them which were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands," living again and reigning with Christ a thousand years; they suppose, is not meant a literal resurrection, or the resurrection of their bodies, which is not asserted here, as there is nothing said of their bodies, or of their being raised to lite: But that they shall live again and reign with Christ, in the revival, prosperity, reign and triumph of that cause and interest in which they lived, and for the promotion of which they died; and in whose death, the cause seemed in a measure, and for a time, to die and be lost. And they shall live again in their successors, who shall arise and stand up with the same spirit, and in the same cause, in which they lived and died, and fill the world and reign with Christ a thousand years, agreeable to ancient prophecies. "The meek shall inherit the earth. And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
<PB N="44" REF="025635_0043_0FCEAC50846E0C68"/>and all dominions shall serve him." And they suppose, that this revival of the truths and cause of Christ, by the numerous inhabi∣tants of the earth, rising up to a new and holy life, and filling the world with holiness and happiness, is that which is here called the <HI>first resurrection,</HI> in distinction from the second, which will consist in the resurrection of the body; whereas this is a spiritual resurrec∣tion; a resurrection of the truths and cause of Christ, which had been in a great degree, dead and lost; and a resurrection of the souls of men, by the renovation of the Holy Ghost.</P>
<P>That this important passage of scripture, is to be understood in the figurative sense, last mentioned, is very probable, if not certain. And the following considerations are thought sufficient to sup∣port it.</P>
<P N="1">1. Most, if not all the prophecies in this book, are delivered in figurative language, referring to types and events recorded in the Old Testament; and in imitation of the language of the ancient Prophets. And this was proper and even necessary in the best manner to answer the ends of prophecy, as might easily be shown, were it necessary. The first part of this passage, all must allow, is figurative. Satan cannot be bound with a literal, material chain. The key, the great chain, and the seal, cannot be understood liter∣ally. The whole is a figure, and can mean no more than that when the time of the Millennium arrives, or rather previous to it, Jesus Christ will lay effectual restraints on satan, so that his power∣ful and prevailing influence by which he has before deceived and destroyed a great part of mankind, shall be wholly taken from him, for a thousand years. And it is most natural to understand the other part of the description of this remarkable event to be repre∣sented in the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igurative language; as the whole is a represen∣tation of one scene; especially, since no reason can be given why it should not be understood so: And there are reasons against tak∣ing it in a literal sense, which will be mentioned in the following particulars.</P>
<P N="2">2. To suppose that Christ shall come in his human nature to this earth, and live here in his whole person visibly a thousand years, before the day of judgment, appears to be contrary to several passages of scripture.</P>
<P>The coming of Christ, and his appearing at the day of judg∣ment in his human nature, is said to be his <HI>second</HI> appearance, answering to his <HI>first</HI> appearance in his human nature on earth,
<PB N="45" REF="025635_0044_0FCEAC53321A1490"/>from his birth to his ascension into heaven, which was past. "And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them who look for him shall he appear the <HI>second time,</HI> without sin, unto salvation."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix. 27, 28.</NOTE> The appearance here spoken of, is the appearance of Christ at the day of judgment, to complete the salvation of his church. This could not be his appearing the se∣cond time, were he thus to appear, and to be bodily present in his human nature on earth, in the time of the Millennium, which is to take place before the day of judgment. The coming of Christ, does not always intend his coming visibly in his human nature; but he is said to come, when he destroyed the temple and nation of the Jews, and appeared in favour of his church. So his de∣struction of heathen Rome, and delivering his church from that persecuting power, was an instance of his coming. And he will, in the same way, come to destroy antichrist, and the kingdom of satan in the world, and introduce the Millennium; and in these instances, and others, he may be said to appear. But his coming to judgment, and appearing to complete the final destruction of all his enemies, and to perfect the salvation of his church, is his last coming and appearance. And though this will not be his se∣cond appearance and coming, in the sense now mentioned, and with reference to those instances of his coming; yet, as he will then come and appear visibly in his human nature; this will be his second coming and appearance in this way and manner, having never appeared on earth in his human nature more than once be∣fore, or since his first ascension to heaven, after his incarnation. Therefore, when the final judgment shall take place, Christ is re∣presented as being revealed, and coming from heaven, and this is often called, by way of eminence, his <HI>appearing;</HI> meaning his ap∣pearing and coming from heaven in visible splendor and glory, in his whole person, in both natures, divine and human. But if he were here on earth, visible in his human nature, and reigning in his glorified body, during the Millennium; he would be already here to attend the last judgment, and he could not be properly said to come from heaven, and to be revealed from heaven, be∣cause this was done a thousand years before. Therefore, that Christ should come from heaven, and appear and reign in his hu∣man nature and presence before the day of judgment, seems to be contrary to the following scriptures: "For the Lord himself
<PB N="46" REF="025635_0045_0FCEAC5440F77B78"/>shall <HI>descend from heaven</HI> with a shout, with the voice of the arch∣angel, and with the trump of God: And the dead in Christ shall rise first. When the Lord Jesus shall be <HI>revealed from heaven,</HI> with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, &amp;c. When he <HI>shall come</HI> to be glorified in his saints."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. iv. 16. 2 Thess. i. 7, 8, 10.</NOTE> This is evidently his appearing the second time, for the salvation of all them that look for him; and were he on earth be∣fore this, in the human nature, during the time of the Millenni∣um, how could he be said to be <HI>revealed,</HI> to <HI>descend</HI> and <HI>come from</HI> heaven to judge the world?</P>
<P N="3">3. As it seems to be contrary to the above mentioned scrip∣tures to suppose, that Christ will appear on earth, and reign a thousand years in his human nature; so it appears contrary to all reason. Jesus Christ is now on the throne of the universe, having all power in heaven and earth given to him as God-man, and Redeemer, being made head over all things to the church. He is in the most proper, agreeable, and convenient situation to gov∣ern the world, and take care of his church. It does not appear agreeable to his station and office, as king and head over all things, for him to descend in the human nature, and erect a throne on earth; which, so far as can be conceived, would be no advantage to his person, design and work; but very much to the contrary. He is gone to heaven in the human nature, that he might reign there, till his enemies are made his footstool, and all things shall be subdued under him. And his church on earth will enjoy him to as great a degree, and as much advantage, as if he were person∣ally on earth in the human nature, and more; and will have as great enjoyment of his presence. He is now in the best situation to be adored and worshipped by his church on earth. Though they now do not see him, yet believing and loving him, they re∣joice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. And it would not tend to increase this faith, love and joy, to have him come from heaven, and live in some place on earth, in his human nature; but the contrary: For but few, compared with the whole inhabitants of the world, could have access to him, or see him more than they now do. And when the human nature is in heaven, all may equally have access to him, love and worship him. His church and kingdom on earth will be as happy, splendid and glorious, as if he were on earth, as he is now in heaven, and much more so; for these will consist in his spiritual presence and influence, which
<PB N="47" REF="025635_0046_0FCEAC55CACF8C30"/>may be as great while his human nature is in heaven, as if it were on earth; and in their holy conformity to Christ, which would not be increased by his being in that sense on earth. It hence ap∣pears in no respect advantageous or desirable, but the contrary, that Jesus Christ should come personally in the human nature from heaven to earth, to reign here with his church, or that he should thus appear, till he shall come to judgment. It is there∣fore unreasonable to expect or suppose he will thus come, unless it were expressly asserted in scripture, which it certainly is not; but there are some, if not many passages, which seem to be inconsistent with it.</P>
<P>It may be proper to observe here, that the question respecting the manner in which Christ will reign on earth in the Millennium, has no concern with the question concerning the literal or figura∣tive meaning of this passage, as the former does not depend upon the latter: For no man will suppose, that Christ's reigning on earth, is to be understood in a figurative sense. If he shall reign on earth in the hearts of men, by their voluntary subjection to him, he will reign as literally, as if he were present on earth in his humanity. The question, whether this passage is to be understood literally or figuratively, respects the souls of them that were be∣headed for the witness of Jesus, &amp;c. their living and reigning with Christ a thousand years. This therefore leads to other observa∣tions.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Apostle Paul in his writings, does not appear to expect to have his body raised from the dead to live here on earth again, after he died; or say any thing to lead the christians of this day to expect any such thing, but the contrary.</P>
<P>He says, "It is appointed unto man once to die, but after this the judgment." And leads christians to look forward to the se∣cond coming of Christ, when he will come to judgment, as the next great event that will immediately respect them; which seems to be inconsistent with the saints having their bodies raised, and living in this world again, a thousand years before the day of judg∣ment. He addresses christians in the following words, "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affec∣tion on things above, not on things on earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is
<PB N="48" REF="025635_0047_0FCEAC57FB22BF88"/>our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Col. iii. 1, 2, 3, 4.</NOTE> He directs them to expect and seek enjoyment in heaven where Christ is; and not to expect that he will leave his throne there, till he shall appear the second time, to receive his saints to glory in heaven. For appearing with Christ in glory, means, appearing with him in heaven, as that is the place of glory, where the re∣deemed are brought to be glorified, to be where Christ is, to be∣hold his glory. The Apostle Peter, speaking of the dissolution of the heavens and earth, says, "Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. iii. 13.</NOTE> Some have supposed, that this is the Millenni∣um state, which shall take place after the general conflagration, by which the earth will be renewed; in which a perfectly holy and happy state shall commence, to which all the saints who had died shall be raised, &amp;c. But such a notion cannot be reconciled to other passages of scripture, in which, as has been observed, the Millennium is represented as taking place before the general con∣flagration and the day of judgment. And after these are over, and the wicked are cast into endless punishment,
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rev. 20.</NOTE> the Apostle John says, "And I say a new heaven and a new earth: For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea."
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Chap. xxi. 1.</NOTE> By which the heavenly state is chiefly if not wholly meant, where redemption and the church will be perfected. By the new heaven and new earth, is meant the work of redemp∣tion, or the church redeemed by Christ. This is the new crea∣tion, infinitely superiour to the old creation, the natural world, and more important, excellent and durable; of which the latter is a faint type or shadow.</P>
<P>The renovation of the hearts of men, by the Spirit of God, by which they become true christians, is in scripture called a new creature, or as the original words <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> may as well be ren∣dered, <HI>a new creation.</HI> "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: Old things are past away, behold, all things are become new."
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 17.</NOTE> "For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision a∣vaileth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Gal. vi. 15.</NOTE>"— Therefore, every true member of the church belongs to the new creation, and is part of it; and this new creation of the new heaven and new earth, goes on and makes advances, as the church is en∣larged
<PB N="49" REF="025635_0048_0FCEAC5980431F98"/>and rises to a state of greater prosperity, and proceeds to∣wards perfection.</P>
<P>The new heavens, and new earth, the redeemed church of Christ, will be brought to a very happy and glorious state in the Millennium, and greater advantages will be made then in this new creation, than were ever made before. Therefore, to this event, the following prophecy of Isaiah, does chiefly refer, if not wholly. "For behold, I create new heavens, and a new earth. And the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be you glad and rejoice forever, in that which I create: For behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. lxv. 17, 18.</NOTE> It appears from the preceding and following context, that this prophecy refers to the Millennium, in which the new creation, the church of Christ, will come to the most perfect and happy state to which it will be brought in this world; from which it will pass to a perfect state, and be completely finished, after the general resurrection and judgment. Then the old creation, the heavens and the earth shall pass away, and be burnt up, and the new crea∣tion shall be finished, and brought to a most perfect, beautiful, happy and glorious state. To the new heaven and new earth, thus completed, wherein that righteousness or true holiness, which is the beauty, happiness and glory of the new creation, will <HI>dwell,</HI> i. e. continue and flourish forever, the Apostles Peter and John have chief reference in their words, which have been transcribed above.</P>
<P N="5">5. It does not appear desirable, or to be any advantage to the departed faints, or to the church of Christ on earth, to have the bodies of all who have died before the Millennium, raised from their graves, and come to live a thousand years in this world, before the general resurrection. They are now perfectly holy and happy; and so far as can be conceived, it would be no addition, but a diminution to their happiness, to come and live in this world, in the body, to eat and drink, and partake of the enjoyments of the world. This would be a degradation, which on no account can be desirable to the spirits of the just, now made perfect in heaven. And it would be no advance in the work of redemption, which is then to be carried on in a greater degree, than ever before. Nor would this be any advantage to the church, in that happy state, to which it will then be brought; but the contrary, as they would take up that room in the world, which will be then wanted
<PB N="50" REF="025635_0049_0FCEAC5B23AA7670"/>for those who will be born in that day. And the spirits of the just could not know or enjoy so much of the prosperity and hap∣piness of the church, in the salvation of men, were they to live in bodies on earth, in that time. The inhabitants of heaven have a more particular and extensive knowledge, of what takes place in favour of the church on earth, than any in this world have, or than they could have, were they to come and live here. They know of every conversion that takes place in this world; and they must have the knowledge of the state of the church on earth, and of every event which comes to pass in favour of it, and see the whole of its prosperity. And they have great joy in every thing of this kind. "There is joy in heaven, in presence of the angels of God, over one sinner that repenteth." How greatly will the happiness and joy in heaven be increased, when all the inhabitants of the world shall be converted to Christ, and the church of Christ shall fill the earth, and appear in the beauty of holiness! Agree∣able to this, the inhabitants of heaven are represented as greatly rejoicing in the prosperity of the church on earth, and the over∣throw of all her enemies. "Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy Apostles and Prophets; for God hath avenged you on her. And I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Hal∣lelujah; salvation, and glory, and honour, and power unto the Lord our God; for he hath judged the great whore, &amp;c. Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xviii. 10. xix. 1—7.</NOTE>— Surely none will desire to leave that place of knowledge, light and joy, and come and be contined in the body in this world, which will be darkness and solitary, compared with that: Such a change of place could be no privilege or reward; but rather a calamity. Therefore, it is not to be believed, unless it be plainly, and in ex∣press words revealed; which, it is presumed, it is not. This leads <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o another observation.</P>
<P N="6">6. There is nothing expressly said of the resurrection of the body in this passage. The Apostle John saw the <HI>souls</HI> of them which were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, &amp;c. and they lived and reigned with Christ. The resurrection of the body, is no where expressed in scripture, by the soul's living. And as there is noth∣ing said of the body, and he only saw their souls to live, this does not appear to be a proper expression, to denote the resurrection of the body, and their living in that. This therefore does not seem
<PB N="51" REF="025635_0050_0FCEAC5C9427D9E0"/>to be the natural meaning of the words; and certainly is not the <HI>necessary</HI> meaning. We are therefore warranted to look for ano∣ther meaning, and to acquiesce in it, if one can be found, which is more easy and natural, and more agreeable to the whole passage, and to the scripture in general. Therefore,</P>
<P N="7">7. The most easy and probable meaning is, that the souls of the martyrs, and all the faithful followers of Christ, who have lived in the world, and have died before the Millennium shall commence, shall revive and live again, in their successors, who shall rise up in the same spirit, and in the same character, in which they lived and died; and in the revival and flourishing of that cause which they espoused, and spent their lives in promoting it, which cause shall appear to be almost lost and dead, previous to the intro∣duction of that glorious day. This is therefore a spiritual resur∣rection, by which all the inhabitants of the world will be made spiritually alive, where spiritual death before had reigned; and they shall appear in the spirit and power of those martyrs and holy men, who had before lived in the world, and who shall live again, in these their successors, and in the revival of their cause, and in the resurrection of the church, from the very low state, in which it had been before the Millennium, to a state of great prosperity and glory.</P>
<P>This is agreeable to the way of representing things in scripture, in other instances. John the baptist was Elijah, because he rose in the spirit of Elijah, and promoted the same cause in which Elijah lived and died; and Elijah revived and lived in John the baptist, because he went before Christ, in the spirit and power of Elijah.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke i. 27.</NOTE> Therefore Christ says of John, "This is Elijah who was to come."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matth. x.. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is also to be observed, that the revival and restoration of the church to a state of prosperity, from a dark, low state, is represent∣ed by a resurrection to life, or as life from the dead. "Thy dead men shall live, together with my d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d body shall they arise; a∣wake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead."
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Isal. xxvi. 19.</NOTE> In the thirty seventh chapter of Ezekiel, this is represented by bringing dry bones to life; and from them, raising up a very great army.— This is a metaphorical or figura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive resurrection. "Then he said unto me, son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel.
<PB N="52" REF="025635_0051_0FCEAC5E0C9EFCD0"/>Behold, they say our bones are dried, and our hope is lost; we are cut off for our parts. Therefore, phephecy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel." The Apostle Paul, speaking of the con∣version of the Jews to Christ, at the Millennium, says it shall be as "life from the dead."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xi, 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the Millennium, there will be a spiritual resurrection, a re∣surrection of the souls of the whole church on earth, and in heaven. All nations will be converted, and the world will be filled with spiritual life, as it never was before; and this will be a general resurrection of the souls of men. This was represented in the re∣turning prodigal. The father says, "This my son was dead, and is alive." And the Apostle Paul speaks of christians as raised from the dead to life. "But God, who is rich in mercy, for the great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 4, 5.</NOTE> "If ye then be <HI>ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en</HI> with Christ."
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Col. iii. 1.</NOTE> And this will be a most remarkable resurrection of the church on earth from a low, dark, afflicted state, to a state of great life and joy. It will be multiplied to an exceeding great army, which will cover the face of the earth. And heaven will in a sense and degree, come down to earth; the spirit of the mar∣tyrs, and of all the just made perfect, will now revive and appear on earth, in their numerous successors, and the joy of those in heaven will be greatly increased.</P>
<P>This is the first resurrection, in which all they who have a part are blessed and holy. "Blessed and holy is he who hath part in the first resurrection: On such the second death hath no power." It is implied that <HI>they only</HI> are blessed and holy, who share in this resurrection; and therefore that all the redeemed in heaven and earth, who are blessed and holy, are the subjects of it, or have part in it. All who have been or shall be raised from death to spiritual life, have by this, a part in this first resurrection; and they, and they only, shall escape the second death. This is a farther evidence that this first resurrection is a spiritual resurrection, a re∣surrection of the soul; for if it were a literal resurrection of the body, no one would think it would include all the happy and ho∣ly, all that shall be saved. The second resurrection is to be the re∣surrection of the body, in which all shall have part, both the holy
<PB N="53" REF="025635_0052_0FCEAC5F8680C3B0"/>and the unholy, the blessed and the miserable; which is to take place after the first resurrection is over, and the Millennium is ended, and after the rise and destruction of God and Magog; when the day of judgment shall come on, of which there is an ac∣count in the latter part of this chapter. "And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it: And death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: And they were judged every man accord∣ing to their works." "But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished." The <HI>rest of the dead,</HI> are all the dead which have no part in the first resurrection; that is, are not holy, and partakers of spiritual life. This includes all the wicked who shall have lived, and shall die before the Millennium, the last of which will be slain, and swept off the earth previous to the Millennium, and in order to introduce it, of which there is a representation in the words immediately preceding the passage un∣der consideration. "And <HI>the rest</HI> were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth, and all the fowls were filled with their flesh." In our translation, it is <HI>the remnant.</HI> It is the same word in the original, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which is translated <HI>the rest,</HI> in the words transcribed a∣bove; and the latter seem to have reference to the former. The rest of the dead, are the wicked dead, in opposition to the righ∣teous, who lived again in their successors, who take possession of the earth and reign; and in the revival and prosperity of their cause, and the kingdom of which they are members. During this thou∣sand years, the rest of the dead, all the antichristian party, and the wicked enemies of Christ, who lived and died in the cause of satan, do not live again: They will have no successors on earth, who shall rise in their spirit, and espouse and promote their cause; but this will be wholly run down and lost, till the thousand years shall be ended: And then they shall live again a short time in their successors, Gog and Magog, who shall arise in their spirit and cause, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rease and prevail, while satan is loosed again for a little season. This is implied in the words, "But the rest of the dead lived not again, until the thousand years were finished." It is supposed that they will live again then, which must be during the time in which satan shall be loosed; for the general resurrection of the bodies will not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill this is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. These dead will live then,
<PB N="54" REF="025635_0053_0FCEAC610ACF49C8"/>just as the souls of the martyrs, and all the faithful followers of Christ, who had died, will live in the Millennium.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"It is very agreeable to the design and connection of this prophecy, to understand the rest of the dead, who lived not again till the thousand years were finished, of the rest or remnant, viz. of those who were slain with the sword of him that sat on the horse. Thus the dead church raised to life, and living and reigning for a thousand years, and the enemies of the church remaining dead, and not living again till the thousand years were finished, will exactly agree in the same figurative meaning. This will be a sense con∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stent with the resurrection of the antichristian party again, for a little sea∣son, after the thousand years shall be finished." Mr. Lowman's Note on Rev. xx. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>That this prophecy respects all nations, and the whole of man∣kind who shall live in the world in that thousand years, is evident, in that the binding of satan respects them all. "That he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be ful∣filled." And this answers to a prophecy in Isaiah. "And he will destroy in this mountain, the face of the covering cast over <HI>all people,</HI> and the vail that is spread over <HI>all nations.</HI>"
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isaiah xxv. 7.</NOTE> All nations, the world of mankind therefore, who shall then live on the earth, will have part in the first resurrection. And this warrants the ap∣plication of all the prophecies which have been mentioned in the preceding section, and others of the same tenor, to this time. And there is good reason to believe, that this prophecy, in the first six verses of the twentieth chapter of the Revelation, is expressed in language best suited to answer the end of it, if it be understood as it has been now explained. The meaning is as obvious and plain, as is desirable and proper that of prophecy should be, when compared with other prophecies. And it is in the best manner suited to support and comfort the followers of Christ, who live before that time; and to animate them to faithfulness, constancy and patience, under all their sufferings in this cause, while the wicked prosper and triumph, and satan reigns in the world, which is one special end of this revelation. Here they are taught, that an end is to come to the afflictions of the church, and to the triumph of all her enemies. That satan's kingdom on earth shall come to an end, and the church shall rise and spread, and fill the world; that the cause in which they labour and suffer shall be virtuous, and that all who suffer in this cause, and who are faithful to Christ, shall live to see this happy, glorious day, and have a large share in it, in proportion to the degree and length of their suffer∣ings,
<PB N="55" REF="025635_0054_0FCEAC6288D79878"/>labours, and persevering patience and fidelity, in the cause of Christ and his church.</P>
<P>THE way is now prepared, to consider and show more particu∣larly, in what the happiness and glory of the Millennium will con∣sist; and what particular circumstances will attend the church at that day: What is revealed concerning this by express prophecies, and what is implied in them, or may be deduced as consequences from what is expressly declared. It will be no wonder if some mistakes should be made on this point; but it is hoped if there should be any, they will not be very hurtful: And it is appre∣hended that the greatest error will be in falling short, and not coming up to the reality, in the description of the happiness and glory of that day; for doubtless, our ideas of these, when raised to the highest of which we are at present capable, fall vastly short of the truth. There is good reason to conclude, however, that the church, and christians, will not be perfectly holy in that day; but that every one will be attended with a degree of sinful imperfec∣tion, while in the body, however great may be his attainments and advantages in knowledge and holiness. Doubtless the inspired declarations, that "There is no man which sinneth not—There is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not— That if any who professes to be a christian, say he hath no sin, he deceiveth himself, and the truth is not in him," will remain true to the end of the world, even in the Millennium; and there will be no perfection on this side heaven. The apostacy which will take place at the end of the Millennium, can be better ac∣counted for, on the supposition that the saints will not be perfect in that time, and seems to suppose it. Though they may, and doubtless will, have vastly higher degrees of light and holiness, than any shall have before that time; yet they will be far from being wholly without sin.</P>
<P>It is most probable, that every individual person who shall then live will be a real christian; and all will doubtless be members of the church, in that day. That is the time when "all shall know the Lord, from the least to the greatest." God says to his church, speaking of that day, "Thy people also shall be all righteous."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. lx. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> "Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion, put on thy beauti∣ful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: For henceforth there shall no more come unto thee the uncircumcised and the unclean."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai. iii. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="025635_0055_0FCEAC640554C6D0"/>
The following things will take place in the Millennium in an eminent degree, as they never did before; which may be men∣tioned as generals, including many particulars, some of which will be afterwards suggested.</P>
<P N="1">I. THAT will be a time of eminent holiness, when it shall be acted out by all, in a high degree, in all the branches of it, so as to appear in its true beauty, and the happy effects of it. This will be the peculiar glory, and the source of the happiness of the Millennium. The Prophet Zechariah, speaking of that day, says, "In that day, shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLI∣NESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots of the Lord's house shall be like the bowls before the altar. Yea, every pot in Jerusa∣lem and in Judah, shall be holiness unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Lord of hosts."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. xiv, 20, 21.</NOTE>— In these metaphorical expressions, is declared the eminent degree of holiness of that day, which will consecrate every thing, even all the utensils and the common business and enjoyments of life, unto the Lord.</P>
<P>Holiness consists in love to God, and to man, with every affec∣tion and exercise implied in this, which being expressed and acted out, appears in the exercise of piety towards God, in every branch of it; and of righteousness and goodness, or disinterested benevolence towards man, including ourselves. This, so far as it shall take place, will banish all the evils which have existed and prevailed in the world; and becoming universal, and rising to a high and emi∣nent degree, will introduce a state of enjoyment and happiness, which never was known before on earth; and render it a resem∣blance of heaven in a high degree.</P>
<P>This will be effected by the abundant influences of the Holy Spirit, poured down on men more universally, and in more con∣stant and plentiful effusions, than ever before; for all holiness in man, is the effect of the Holy Spirit. That day will be, in a peculiar sense, <HI>the distensation of the Holy Spirit,</HI> when he will appear as the author of all holiness, by whose influence alone divine re∣vealed truth, and all religious institutions and means, become efficacious and salutary; by which he will have peculiar honour, in the holiness and salvation which shall then take place. The prophecies of scripture which respect the Millennium, represent it in this light. God, speaking by Isaiah of that time, says, "I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine
<PB N="57" REF="025635_0056_0FCEAC6591129718"/>offspring. And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses." And the same time and event is mention∣ed as the effect of the Holy Spirit, poured out upon the church. "Neither will I hide my face any more from them: <HI>For I have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel,</HI> saith the Lord God."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxix. 29.</NOTE> The same event is predicted by the Prophet Joel. "And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh. And also upon the servants, and upon the handmaids in these days, will I pour out my Spirit."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Joel ii. 28, 29.</NOTE> The Apostle Peter, ap∣plies this passage in Joel, to the pouring out of the Spirit, on the Apostles and others on the day of Penticost.
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 16, &amp;c.</NOTE> But this prophecy was fulfilled only in a small degree then. This was but the be∣ginning, the first fruits, which will issue in that which is unspeak∣ably greater, more extensive and glorious in the days of the Mil∣lennium, to which this prediction has chief respect, and when it will have the full and most complete accomplishment.</P>
<P N="2">II. THERE will be a great increase of light and knowledge to a degree vastly beyond what has been before. This is indeed im∣plied in the great degree of holiness, which has been mentioned. For knowledge, mental light, and holiness, are inseparably con∣nected; and are, in some respects, the same. Holiness is true light and discerning, so far as it depends upon a right taste, and consists in it; and it is a thirst after every kind and degree of useful knowledge; and this desire and thirst for knowledge, will be great and strong, in proportion to the degree of holiness exercised: And forms the mind to constant attention, and to make swift ad∣vances in understanding and knowledge; and becomes a strong guard against mistakes, error and delusion. Therefore, a time of eminent holiness, must be a time of proportionably great light and knowledge. This is the representation which the scripture gives of that time. The end of binding satan, and casting him into the bottomless pit, is said to be, "That he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled." This will put an end to the darkness, and multiplicity of strong delusions, which do prevail, and will prevail, till that time, by which satan supports and promotes his interest and kingdom among men.— Then "The face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail spread over all nations, shall be taken away and destroyed:"
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Isai. xxv. 7.</NOTE>
<PB N="58" REF="025635_0057_0FCEAC67073D0318"/>"And the eyes of them that see, shall not be dim; and the ears of them that hear, shall hearken. The heart also of the rash, shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. xxxii. 3, 4.</NOTE> The superior light and know∣ledge of that day, is metaphorically represented in the following words: "Moreover, the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be seven fold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai. xxx. 26.</NOTE> In that day, "The earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea."
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Isai. xi. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>The holy scriptures will then be attended to by all, and studied with care, meekness, humility and uprightness of heart, earnestly desiring to understand them, and know the truth; and the truths they contain will be received with a high relish and delight: And the Bible will be much better understood, than ever before. Many things expressed or implied in the scripture, which are now over∣looked and disregarded, will then be discovered, and appear im∣portant and excellent; and those things which now appear intri∣cate and unintelligible, will then appear plain and easy. Then public teachers will be eminently burning and shining lights; apt to teach; scribes well instructed into the things of the kingdom of heaven, who will bring out of their treasures, things new and old: And the hearers will be all attention, and receive the truth in the love of it, into honest and good hearts; and light and knowledge will constantly increase. The conversation of friends and neighbours, when they meet, will be full of instruction, and they will assist each other in their inquiries after the truth, and in pursuit of knowledge. Parents will be able and disposed to instruct their children, as soon as they are capable of learning; and they will early understand what are the great and leading truths which are revealed in the Bible, and the duties and institutions there prescribed. And from their childhood they will know and under∣stand the holy scriptures, by which they will grow in understand∣ing and wisdom; and will soon know more than the greatest and best divines have known in ages before. And a happy foundation will be laid for great advances in knowledge and usefulness to the end of life. Agreeable to this, the scripture, speaking of that day, says, "There shall be no more thence (i. e. in the church) an in∣fant
<PB N="59" REF="025635_0058_0FCEAC688E2ED430"/>of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days; for the child shall die an hundred years old."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. lxv. 20.</NOTE> "An infant of days," is an <HI>old infant.</HI> That is, an old man who is an infant in knowledge, understanding and discretion. Many such aged infants have been, and still are to be found. In that day all shall make advances in true knowledge, discretion and wisdom, in some proportion to their years. "Nor an old man that hath not filled his days." That is, an old man who has not improved in knowledge and usefulness and every good attainment, according to his age. "For a child shall die an hundred years old." That is, children in years shall then make such early progress in knowledge, and in religion, and in all excellent and useful attainments, that they shall equal, if not surpass, the highest attainments in these things, of the oldest men who have lived in former ages.</P>
<P>They will then have every desirable advantage and opportunity to get knowledge. They will all be engaged in the same pursuit, and give all the aid and assistance to each other, in their power.— They will all have sufficient leisure to pursue and acquire learning of every kind, that will be beneficial to themselves and to society; especially knowledge of divinity. And great advances will be made in all arts and sciences, and in every useful branch of know∣ledge, which tends to promote the spiritual and eternal good of men, or their convenience and comfort in this life.</P>
<P N="3">III. IT will be a time of universal peace, love and general and cordial friendship. War and all strife and contention shall then cease, and be succeeded by mutual love, friendship and benificence. Those lusts of men, which originate in self love, or selfishness, which produce all the wars and strifes among men, shall be sub∣dued and mortified, and yield to that disinterested benevolence, that heavenly wisdom, which is peaceable, gentle and easy to be intreated. This will effectually put an end to war, as the scripture teaches. "And he shall judge among the nations, and shall re∣buke many people: And they shall beat their swords into plow∣shares, and their spears into pruning hooks: Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai. ii. 4. xxxii. 18.</NOTE> The whole world of mankind will be united as one family, wisely seeking the good of
<PB N="60" REF="025635_0059_0FCEAC6A008C59B0"/>each other, in the exercise of the most sweet love and friendship, founded upon the best and everlasting principles. "The meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abund∣ance of peace." This change, which shall then take place, in which men, who were in ages before, like savage beasts, injurious, cruel, revengeful and destructive to each other, shall lay aside all this, and become harmless, humble and benevolent, is set in a striking, beautiful light in prophecies, representing it by the most fierce and cruel beasts of prey, changing their nature, and living quietly with those creatures which they used to destroy; and so tame and pliable that a little child might lead them; and by the most venemous creatures and insects becoming harmless, so that a child might play with them without any danger of being hurt. Isaiah, speaking of that day, says, "The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: And the lion shall eat straw, like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice den."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. xi. 6, 7, 8.</NOTE> Then "They shall sit every man under his vine, and under his fig tree, and none shall make them afraid."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mic. iv. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">IV. IN that day, men will not only be united in peace and love, as brethren; but will agree in sentiments, respecting the doctrines and truth contained in the Bible, and the religious insti∣tutions and practice, which are there prescribed.</P>
<P>Professing christians have been from the beginning of christianity to this day, greatly divided, and have opposed each other in their religious sentiments and practices; and are now divided into vari∣ous parties, sects and denominations, while all appeal to divine revelation, and profess to take their sentiments and practices from that.</P>
<P>It has been often said by some professing christians, and is a sentiment which appears to be spreading at this day, That differ∣ence in religious sentiments, and in attendance on the institutions of the gospel, and modes of worship, is attended with no incon∣venience, but is rather desirable, and advantageous; and by this variety, christianity is rendered more agreeable and beautiful.
<PB N="61" REF="025635_0060_0FCEAC6BB5FF2E60"/>That it is impossible that all men, whose capacities and genius are so different and various, and their minds, and way of thinking and conception are naturally so far from being alike, should ever be brought to think alike, and embrace the same religious sentiments. That this difference in man's belief and sentiment cannot be criminal; for men are no more obliged to think alike, than they are to look alike, and have the same bodily features and stature. All the union that is required, or that can take place, is that of kind affection, love and charity.</P>
<P>But such sentiments as these are not agreeable to reason or scripture. Error in judgment and sentiment, especially in things of a moral nature, is always wrong; and does not consist or originate merely in any defect of the moral faculties of the mind; but is of a moral nature, in which the taste, affection, or inclina∣tion of the heart is concerned; and therefore is always, in every degree of it, morally wrong, and more or less criminal. Were the moral faculties of the mind, were the heart, perfectly right, man would not be capable of error, or of judging wrong, or mak∣ing any mistake, especially in things of religion. The natural faculties of the mind, of perception and understanding or reason, considered as separate from the inclination or will, do not lead, and have no tendency in themselves, to judge wrong, or contrary to the truth of things. To do so, is to judge without evidence, and contrary to it, which the mind never would or could do, were not the inclination or heart concerned in it, so as to have influence, which must be a wrong inclination, and contrary to the truth, and to evidence; and therefore is morally wrong, or criminal.</P>
<P>Therefore, all the mistakes and wrong opinions which men en∣tertain, respecting the doctrines, institutions and duties revealed in the Bible, are criminal, and of a bad tendency. They must be so, as they are contrary to man's obligation and duty to believe all revealed truth; and are wholly owing to a wrong bias or in∣clination, or the depravity and corruption of the heart. What God has revealed in his word, he has declared to man, to be re∣ceived by him, and believed to be the truth; of which he has given sufficient evidence. And the man who does not believe what God has clearly revealed, and of which he has given sufficient evidence, even all that can be reasonably desired, does abuse and pervert his own understanding, and shuts his eyes against the truth, and re∣fuses to receive the testimony which God has given. And who will say there is no crime in this!</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="025635_0061_0FCEAC6CFA9ACAD8"/>
Since therefore, all mistakes and errors, contrary to the truths made known in the Bible, are criminal, and owing to the corrup∣tion of the heart of man, then perfect holiness will exclude all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣ror, and there neither is, nor can be, any wrong judgment in hea∣ven; and in the Millennium, which will be a greater image of heaven than ever was before on earth, holiness, light and know∣ledge, will rise so high, that the former errors in principle and practice will subside, and there will be a great and general union in the belief and practice of the truth, contained in divine reve∣lation.</P>
<P>As there is but "one Lord, one faith, and one baptism," so in that day men will be united in the belief and profession of this one faith, in the system of doctrines revealed in the Bible, which then will appear plain, and with the clearest evidence to all. And they will have one common Lord, will understand, and obey all the commands of Christ; and they will know what are the in∣stitutions and ordinances which Christ has appointed, which are all implied in baptism: They will understand what is the import of this, and implied in it, and be united in sentiments and practice, so as to form a beautiful, happy union and harmony; which will put an end to the variety and opposition of opinions, and practices, which now divide professing christians into so many sects, parties and denominations. The whole church, with all the members of it, which will fill the earth, and include all mankind then living, will in that day, come to that to which the gospel tends, and is designed to bring it: It will "Come in <HI>the unity of the saith,</HI> and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: That they shall be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and the cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive: But speaking the truth in love, shall grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 13, 14, 15.</NOTE> Then, agreeable to the wish and injunc∣tion of the Apostle Paul, christians will "all speak the same thing, and there will be no divisions among them; but will be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i. 10.</NOTE> Then the inventions and prescriptions of men, both in doctrines and modes of worship, and in christian practice, will be abolished and cease. The Bible will be then understood, and be found a
<PB N="63" REF="025635_0062_0FCEAC6E7AED3868"/>sufficient and perfect rule of faith and practice, in which all will agree, and will join "with one mind, and one mouth, to worship and glorify God."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xv. 6.</NOTE> Then the weapons of the gospel, the truths of divine revelation, being preached, understood and received, will cast down the imaginations of men, and every high thing, intro∣duced by the pride of man, which now exalts itself against the knowledge of God; and will bring into captivity every thought, to the obedience of Christ."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. x. 4.5.</NOTE> "And the Lord shall be king over all the earth. In that day shall there be one Lord, and his name one."
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Zech. xiv. 9.</NOTE> All shall agree in their view a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cknowledgment of the divine character, and consequently in all the revealed truths and dictates contained in the Bible. Christ will then come to his temple, his church, "and he will be like a refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap. And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righ∣teousness."
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Mal. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE> The question will be asked now, as it was then, "But who may abide the day of his coming? And who shall stand when he appeareth?" What sect or denomination of chris∣tians will abide the trial of that day, and be established?</P>
<P>Answer.—Nothing but the truth, or that which is conformable to it, will abide the trial of that day. "The lip of truth shall be established forever."
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Prov. xii. 19.</NOTE> "The righteous nation which <HI>keepeth the truth</HI> shall enter in," and be established in that day.
<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Isai. xxvi. 2.</NOTE> Those of every denomination will doubtless expect, that the doctrines they hold, and their mode of worship and discipline, and practice, with respect to the institutions and ordinances of Christ, will be then established as agreeable to the truth; and all others will be given up; and all men will freely conform to them. But the most, and perhaps all, will be much disappointed in this expectation; especially with regard to the different modes of worship, and prac∣tises relating to discipline, and the ordinances of the gospel. When the church comes to be built up in that day, and put on her beau∣tiful garments, it will doubtless be different from any thing which now takes place; and what church and particular denomination is now nearest the truth, and the church which will exist at that time, must be left to be decided by the event. It is certain, that all doctrines and practices which are not agreeable to the truth,
<PB N="64" REF="025635_0063_0FCEAC70067C7238"/>will at that day, as wood, hay, and stubble, be burnt up. There∣fore, it now highly concerns all, honestly to seek and find, love and practise, truth and peace.</P>
<P>It is agreeable to human nature, and seems to be essential to ra∣tional creatures, to be most pleased with those who think as they do, and are of the same sentiments with themselves, in those things in which they feel themselves chiefly interested and concerned. And this agreement in sentiment, cements and increases their union and friendship. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this is true, in a peculiar sense and degree, in the case before us. There can be no proper, cordial, religious union among professing christians, who wholly differ and oppose each other in their opinion, respecting the truths and doctrines of the gospel. And agreement in sentiment, and in the knowledge and belief of the truth, is essential to the most happy christian union and friendship. To him who loves the truth, error in others is disagreeable and hateful, and that in proportion to the degree of his love of the truth, and pleasure in it. Therefore, christians love one another <HI>in the truth,</HI> as the Apostles and primi∣tive christians did. "The Elder, unto the well beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">3 John, verse 1.</NOTE> Where there is no agreement and union in sentiment, and belief of the truth, there is no foundation for christian love and friendship. Love, without any regard to truth, is not christian love. In this sense, the knowledge and belief of the truth, and christian love, cannot be separated: And where there is no knowledge and belief of the truths of the gospel, and agreement in sentiment, there can be no union of heart, and true christian love and friendship.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">They who talk of christian union, love and charity, where there is no agreement in sentiment, respecting the truths and doctrines of the gospel, but a great difference and opposition; and think that doctrinal sentiments are of no importance in christianity; and that their having no belief of par∣ticular doctrines, and no creed; or differing in their religious sentiments ever so much, is no impediment to the greatest union and christian friend∣ship, seem not to know, what real christian union, love and friendship is. It is certain they do not love one another <HI>in the truth,</HI> and <HI>for the truth's sake,</HI> which dwelleth in them, as christians did in the Apostles days, 2 John 1, 2. The catholicism and love for which they plead, appears to be a <HI>political</HI> love and union, which may in some measure unite civil worldly societies; but has nothing of the nature of real christianity, and that union and love by which the followers of Christ are ONE.</NOTE></P>

As light and knowledge will be greatly increased in the Millen∣nium, and the great truths and doctrines contained in divine reve∣lation will then be more clearly discerned, and appear in their true connection, excellence and importance, they will be understood and cordially embraced by all; and they will be united together in the same mind, and the same judgment; and by this be formed to a high degree of happy christian union, love and friendship, lov∣ing one another in the truth, with a pure heart fervently. Thus were the primitive christians united in knowing and obeying the truth, whom the Apostle Peter thus addresses: "Seeing ye have purified your souls in <HI>obeying the truth</HI> through the Spirit, unto un∣feigned love of the brethren; see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently."

<P>This is often mentioned in prophecy, as what will take place in that day, in a peculiar manner and high degree.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xv. 7, 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>And this great increase of happiness and joy on earth will be the natural and even necessary consequence, of the great degree and universality of knowledge and holiness, which all will then profess. The knowledge of God, and the Redeemer, and love to him, will be the source of unspeaka<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e pleasure and joy in his char∣acter, government and kingdom. And the more the great truths of divine revelation are opened and come into view, and the wis∣dom and grace of God in the work of redemption, are seen; the more they are contemplated and relished, the greater will be their enjoyment and happiness; and great will be their evidence and assurance of the love and favour of God, and that they shall enjoy him, and all the blessings and glory of his kingdom forever.— Then, as it is predicted of that time, "The work of righteousness shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assur∣ance forever."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai. xxxii. 17.</NOTE> Then the eminent degree of righteousness or holiness, to which all shall arrive, will be attended with great enjoy∣ment and happiness, which is often meant by <HI>peace</HI> in scripture.

<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Note.

<P>They will have unspeakable satisfaction and delight in worship∣ping God in secret, and in social worship, whether more private or public. And their meditations and study on divine things will be sweet. The word of God will be to them sweeter than honey or the honey comb; and they will rejoice in the truths there
<PB N="67" REF="025635_0066_0FCEAC7584F07338"/>revealed, more than the men of the world ever did, or can do in all riches. In public assemblies, while the heart and lips of the preacher will glow with heavenly truth, and he pours light and instruction on a numerous congregation, they will all hang upon his lips, and drink in the divine sentiments which are communi∣cated, with a high reiish and delight. And in such entertainments there will be enjoyed unspeakably more real pleasure and happiness, than all the men of the world ever found in the most gay, brilliant company, with the most agreeable festivity and mirth, music and dancing, that is possible. The latter is not worthy to be compared with the former.</P>
<P>Then religious enjoyment, whether in company or alone, will appear to be a reality, and of the highest and most noble kind; and every one will be a witness and instance of it. There will then be no briar and thorns to molest enjoyment, or render company dis∣agreeable; but all will be amiable, happy and full of love, and render themselves agreeable to every one. Every one will behave with decency and propriety towards all, agreeable to his station and connections. The law of kindness will be on the tongues of all; and true friendship, of which there is so little among men now, will then be common and universal, even christian love and friendship, which is the most excellent kind of friendship, and is indeed the only real, happy, lasting friendship. And this will lay a foundation for a peculiar, happy intimacy and friendship, in the nearest relations and connections: By which conjugal and domes∣tic duties will be faithfully performed; and the happiness of those relations will be very great; and the end of the institutions of marriage, and families, be answered in a much greater degree, than ever before, and they will have their proper effect, in promoting the enjoyment of individuals, and the good of society.</P>
<P>Then the happiness and joy each one will have in the welfare of others, and the blessings bestowed on them, will be very great. Now the few christians who exercise disinterested benevolence, have, as the Apostle Paul had, great heaviness, and continual sor∣row in their hearts, while they behold so many miserable objects: And are surrounded with those who are unhappy in this world, and appear to be going to everlasting destruction, by their folly and obstinacy in sin. They have great comfort and joy, indeed, in the few who appear to be christians, and heirs of eternal life.— When they see persons who appear to understand and love the
<PB N="68" REF="025635_0067_0FCEAC7755B5B570"/>doctrines of the gospel, and to have imbibed the amiable, excellent spirit of christianity, and to be the blessed favourites of heaven, they greatly rejoice with them in their happiness, and can say, as Paul did, "What thanks can we render to God for you, for all the joy wherewith we rejoice <HI>for your sakes</HI> before our God!"
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. iii. 9.</NOTE> But in the Millennium, the happiness and joy of each one, will be unspeakably greater, in the character and happiness of all. The benevolence of every one will be gratified and pleased to a very high degree, by all whom he beholds, all with whom he converses, and of whom he thinks; and in their amiable character, and great happiness, he will have pleasure and joy, in proportion to the de∣gree of his bene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olence, which will vastly surpass that degree of it, which the best christians now exercise. There will then be no such infinitely miserable objects, which are now every where to be seen, to excite painful grief and sorrow; and the character of christians will then be much more beautiful and excellent, than that of real christians is now, as they will abound so much more in all holy exercise and practice; and their present enjoyment, and future happiness in heaven, will be more evident and realized by each one, which will give pleasure and joy to every one, in the amiable character and happiness of others, even beyond all our present conceptions. "There shall be no more a pricking briar unto the church, or particular christians, nor any grieving thorn, of all that are round about them."

But this enjoyment and pleasure will rise much higher between those who are particularly acquainted with each others character, exercises and circumstances; and especially those who are in a more near connection with each other, and whose circumstances and opportunities, lead them to form and cultivate a peculiar in∣timacy and friendship.</P>
<P>But it is not to be supposed that we are now able to give a proper and full description, or to form an adequate idea of the hap∣piness,
<PB N="69" REF="025635_0068_0FCEAC78A52798C0"/>joy and glory of that day; but all that is attempted, and our most enlarged and pleasing conceptions, fail much short of the truth, which cannot be fully known, till that happy time shall come. They who now have the best and highest taste for divine truth, and the greatest religious enjoyment, who abound most in christian love, and have the most experience of the happiness of christian friendship, and attend most to the Bible, and study the predictions of that day, will doubtless have the clearest view of it, and most agreeable to the truth, and the highest satisfaction and pleasure, in the prospect of it.</P>
<P>THERE are many other things and circumstances which will take place in that day, which are implied in what has now been observed, or may be inferred from it, and from the scripture, by which the advantages, happiness and glory of the Millennium will be promoted; some of which will be mentioned in the fol∣lowing particulars:</P>
<P N="1">1. All outward worldly circumstances will then be agree∣able and prosperous, and there will be for all, a sufficiency and fulness of every thing needed for the body, and for the comfort and convenience of every one.</P>
<P>This may be inferred from many passages of scripture, which refer to that day; among which are the following: "Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalms l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>i. 6.</NOTE> "Then shall he give the rain of thy seed; that thou shalt sow the ground withal, and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: In that day shall thy cat∣tle feed in large pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ures.

<P>This plenty, and fulness of the things of this life, and worldly prosperity, by which all will be in easy, comfortable circum∣stances, as to outward conveniences, and temporal enjoyment, will be owing to the following things:</P>
<P N="1">1. To the kindness and peculiar blessing of God in his provi∣dence. When all the inhabitants of the world shall become e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣nently pious, and devote all they have or can enjoy in this world, to God, to the reigning Saviour, he will smile upon men in his providence, and bless them in the city, and in the field, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the ground, in the increase of their herds, and of their flocks, in their basket and in their store, as he promised he would bless the children of Israel, if they would be obedient to him.

<P N="2">2. To the great degree of benevolence, virtue and wisdom, which all will then have and exercise, with respect to the affairs of this world. There will then be no war to impoverish, lay waste and destroy. This has been a vast expense and scourge to man∣kind in all ages, by which poverty and distress have been spread among all nations; and the fruits of the earth, produced and stored by the hard labour of man, have been devoured, and worse than lost. Then there will be no unrighteous persons, who shall be disposed to invade the rights and property of others, or deprive them of what justly belongs to them; but every one shall securely sit under his own vine, and fig tree; and there shall be none to make him afraid. Then there will be no law suits, which now, in civilized nations, are so vexatious and very expensive of time and money. Then, by the temperance in all things, which will be practised, and the prudent and wise care of the body, and by the smiles of heaven, there will be no expensive, distressing, de∣solating
<PB N="71" REF="025635_0070_0FCEAC7B42EFEC30"/>pestilence and sickness; but general health will be enjoy∣ed; by which much expense of time and money will be pre∣vented.</P>
<P>The intemperance, excess, extravagance and waste, in food and raiment, and the use of the things of life, which were before prac∣tised, will be discarded and cease, in that day. By these, a great part of the productions of the earth, which are for the comfort and convenience of man, are now wasted and worse than lost, as they are, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>numerable instances, the cause of debility of body, sick∣ness and death. But every thing of this kind will be used with great prudence and economy; and in that way, measure and de∣gree, which will best answer the ends of food, drink and clothing, and all other furniture, so as to be most comfortable, decent and convenient, and in the best manner furnish persons for their pro∣per business and duty. Nothing will be sought or used to gratify pride inordinate, sensual appetite or lust: So that there will be no waste of the thing of life: Nothing will be lost.</P>
<P>And at that time, the art of husbandry will be greatly advanced, and men will have skill to cultivate and manure the earth, in a much better and more easy way, than ever before; so that the fame land will thon produce much more than it does now, twenty, thirty, sixty, and perhaps an hundred fold more. And that which is now esteemed barren, and not capable of producing any thing, by cultivation, will then yield much more, for the sustenance of man and beast, than that which is most productive now; So that a very little spot will then produce more of the necessaries and comforts of life, than large tracts of land do now. And in this way, the curse which has hitherto been upon the ground, for the rebellion of man, will be in a great measure removed.</P>
<P>There will also doubtless, be great improvement and advances made in all those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> arts, by which the earth will be subdued and cultivated, and all the necessary and convenient articles of life, such as all utensils, clothing, buildings, &amp;c. will be formed and made, in a better manner, and with much less labour, than they now are. There may be inventions and arts of this kind, which are beyond our present conception. And if they could be now known by any one, and he could tell what they will be, they would be thought by most, to be utterly incredible and impossible; as those inventions and arts, which are now known and familiar to us, would have appeared to those who lived before they were found out and took place.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="025635_0071_0FCEAC7CC67A18A8"/>
It is not impossible, but very probable, that ways will yet be found out by men, to cut rocks and stones into any shape they please; and to remove them from place to place, with as little la∣bour, as that with which they now cut and remove the softest and lightest wood, in order to build houses, fences, bridges, paving roads, &amp;c. And those huge rocks and stones, which now appear to be useless, and even a nuisance, may then be found to be made, and reserved by him who is infinitely wise and good, for great use∣fulness, and important purposes. Perhaps there is good reason not to doubt of this. And can he doubt of it, who considers what inventions and arts have taken place in latter ages, which are as much an advance beyond what was known or thought of in ages before, as such an art would be, beyond what is now known and practised? The art by which they removed great stones, and raised them to a vast height, by which they built the pyramids in Egypt; and that by which huge stones were cut and put into the temple of Jerusalem, is now lost, and it cannot be conceived how this was done. This art may be revived in the Millennium; and there may be other inventions and arts, to us, inconceivably greater and more useful than that. Then, in a literal sense, The vallies shall be filled, and the mountains and hills shad be made low, and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough way, shall be made smooth, to render travelling more convenient and casy, and the earth more productive and fertile.</P>
<P>When all these things are considered, which have now been suggested, and others which will naturally occur to them who at∣tend to this subject, it will appear evident, that in the days of the Millennium, there will be a fulness and plenty of all the necessaries and conveniences of life, to render all much more easy and com∣fortable, in their worldly circumstances and enjoyments, than ever before, and with much less labour and toil: And that it will not be then necessary for any men or women to spend all, or the great∣est part of their time in labour, in order to procure a living, and enjoy all the comforts and desirable conveniencies of life. It will not be necessary for each one, to labour more than two or three hours in a day, and not more than will conduce to the health and vigour of the body. And the rest of their time they will be dis∣posed to spend in reading and conversation, and in all those ex∣ercises which are necessary and proper, in order to improve their minds, and make progress in knowledge; especially in the know∣ledge
<PB N="73" REF="025635_0072_0FCEAC7F97D33A58"/>of divinity: And in studying the scriptures, and in private and social and public worship, and attending on public instruction, &amp;c. When the earth shall be all subdued, and prepared in the best man∣ner for cultivation, and houses and inclosures, and other necessary and convenient buildings shall be erected, and completely finished, consisting of the most durable materials, the labour will not be hard, and will require but a small portion of their time, in order to supply every one with all the necessaries and conveniences of live: And the rest of their time will not be spent in dissipation or idleness, but in business, more entertaining and important, which has been now mentioned.</P>
<P>And there will be then such benevolence and fervent charity in every heart, that if any one shall be reduced to a state of want by some casuality, or by inability to provide for himself, he will have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l the relief and assistance that he could desire; and there will be such a mutual care and assistance of each other, that all worldly things will be in a great degree, and in the best manner common; so as not to be withheld from any who may want them; and they will take great delight in ministering to others and serving them, whenever, and in whatever ways, there shall be opportunity to do it.</P>
<P N="2">2. In that day, mankind will greatly multiply and and increase a number, till the earth shall be filled with them.</P>
<P>When God first made mankind, he said to them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish, (or fill) the earth, and subdue it."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.18.</NOTE> And he renewed this command to Noah and his sons, after the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood, and in them to mankind in general.

And where it has been most subdued and cultivated
<PB N="74" REF="025635_0073_0FCEAC80889C9ED0"/>and populous, it has been, and still is, far from being filled with inhabitants, so that it could support no more, except in a very few instances, if in any. An exact calculation cannot be made; but it is presumed that every man, who considers the things which have been mentioned above, will be sensible that this earth may be made capable of sustaining thousands to one of mankind who now inhabit it; so that if each one were multiplied to many thou∣sands, the earth would not be more than filled, and all might have ample provision for their sustenance, convenience and comfort.— This will not take place, so long as the world of mankind con∣tinue to exercise so much selfishness, unrighteousness and impiety as they do now, and always have done: But there is reason to think they will be greatly diminished, by their destroying them∣selves, and one another, and by remarkable divine judgments, which will be particularly considered in a following section.</P>
<P>But when the Millennium shall begin, the inhabitants which shall then be on the earth, will be disposed to obey the divine com∣mand, to subdue the earth, and multiply, until they have filled it; and they will have skill, and be under all desirable advantages to do it; and the earth will be soon replenished with inhabitants, and be brought to a state of high cultivation and improvement, in every part of it, and will bring forth abundantly for the full supply of all; and there will be many thousand times more people than ever existed before at once in the world. Then the following proph∣ecy, which relates to that day, shall be fulfilled: "A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation. I the Lord will hasten it in his time."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isri. lx. 78.</NOTE> And there is reason to think the earth will be then, in some degree, enlarged in more ways than can now be mentioned, or thought of. In many thousands, hundred of thousands, yea, millions of instances, large tracts now covered with water, coves and arms of the sea, may be drained, or the water shut out by banks and walls; so that hundreds of millions of persons may live on those places, and be sustained by the produce of them, which are now overflowed with water.— Who can doubt of this, who recollects how many millions of people now inhabit Holland and the Low Countries, the greatest part of which wasonce covered with the sea, or thought not to be capable of improvement? Other instances might be mentioned.</P>
<P>Though there will be so many millions of millions of people on the earth at the same time, this will not be the least inconveni∣ence
<PB N="75" REF="025635_0074_0FCEAC8207B841E0"/>to any; but the contrary; for each one will be fully supplied with all he wants, and they will all be united in love, as brethren of one family, and will be mutual helps and blessings to each other. They will die, or rather fall asleep, and pass into the invisible world; and others will come on the stage in their room. But death then will not be attended with the same calamitous and terrible circumstances as it has been, and is now; and will not be considered as an evil. It will not be brought on with long and painful sickness, or be accompanied with any great distress of body or mind. They will be in all respects ready for it, and welcome it with the greatest comfort and joy. Every one will die at the time, and in the manner which will be best for him, and all with whom he is connected: And death will not bring distress on sur∣viving relatives and friends; and they will rather rejoice than mourn, while they have a lively sense of the wisdom and goodness of the will of God, and of the greater happiness of the invisible world, to which their beloved friends are gone; and where they expect soon to arrive. So that in that day, death will in a great measure loose his sting, and have the appearance of a friend, and be welcomed by all as such.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the Millennium, all will probably speak <HI>one language:</HI> So that one language shall he known and understood all over the world, when it shall be filled with inbabitants innumerable.</P>
<P>The whole earth was once, and originally of one language, and of one speech.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xi. 1.6.</NOTE> And the folly and rebellion of men was the oc∣casion of their being confounded in speaking and understanding this one language, and the introduction of a variety of languages. This was considered as in itself a great calamity, and was ordered as such: And it can be considered in no other light. Had men been disposed to improve the advantages of all speaking and un∣derstanding one language, to wise and good purposes, this diver∣sity never would have taken place. And when men shall become universally pious, virtuous and benevolent, and be disposed to use such an advantage and blessing as having one speech and language will be, for the glory of God and the general good, it will doubt∣less be restored to them again. This may casily and soon be done, without a miracle, when mankind and the state of the world shall be ripe for it. When they shall all become as one family in affec∣tion, and discerning and wisdom shall preside and govern in all
<PB N="76" REF="025635_0075_0FCEAC8391F6E850"/>their affairs, shey will soon be sensible of the great disadvantage of being divided into so many different tongues, which will greatly impede that universal free intercourse which will be very desirable; and of the advantage of all speaking and using one language. And God may so order things in his providence that it will then be easy for the most learned and wife to determine which is the best language to be adopted, to be universally taught and spoken.— And when this shall be once determined, and published through the world, by those who are acknowledged to be the wisest men, and best able to fix upon a language that shall be universal, and have a right to do it, all will freely consent to the proposal. And that language will be taught in all schools, and used in publie writings, and books that shall be printed; and in a few years will become the common language, understood and spoken by all; and all or most of the different languages now in the world will be forgotten and lost. All the learning and knowledge of former ages, con∣tained in books, in different languages, worth preserving, will be introduced and published in the universal language, and commu∣nicated to all. This will in a great measure, supersede and render useless the great expense of time, toil and money, which is now bestowed on teaching and studying what are called the <HI>learned lan∣guages.</HI> Many thousands if not millions of youths are now con∣suming years in learning these languages, at great expense of money: And thousands of teachers are spending their lives in attending to them. It is thought by many now, that this is a useless and imprudent waste of time and money, in most instances, at least: It will appear to be much more so, when there shall be one universal language, which shall be understood and spoken by all; and when the books written in that language shall contain all the useful learning and knowledge in the world; and all far∣ther improvements will be communicated to the world in that language.</P>
<P>And when this language shall be established, and become univer∣sal, all the learning and wisdom in the world, will tend and serve to improve it, and render it more and more perfect. And there can be no doubt that such improvements will be made that persons will be able to communicate their ideas with more ease and pre∣cision, and with less ambiguity and danger of being misunderstood, than could be done before.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="025635_0076_0FCEAC85C4FD67A0"/>
And ways will be invented to learn children to read this lan∣guage with propriety, and to spell and write it with correctness, with more case, and in much less time, than it is now done, and with little labour and cost. And ways may be invented, perhaps something like the short hands, which are now used by many, by which they will be able to communicate their ideas, and hold in∣tercourse and correspondence with each other, who live in differ∣ent parts of the world, with much less expense of time and labour, perhaps an hundred times less, than that with which men now correspond.</P>
<P>This will also greatly facilitate the spreading useful knowledge, and all kinds of intelligence, which may be a benefit to mankind, to all parts of the world; and render books very cheap, and easy to be obtained by all. There will then be no need of translations into other languages, and numerous new impressions, in order to have the most useful books read by all. Many hundreds of thou∣sands of copies may be cast off by one impression, and spread over all the earth. And the Bible, one of which, at least, every person will have, by printing such a vast number of them at one impres∣sion, may be afforded much cheaper than it can be now; even though it should be supposed that no improvement will be made in the art of printing, and making paper, which cannot be reason∣ably supposed; but the contrary is much more probable, viz. that both these will then be performed, in a better manner, and with much less labour and expense, than they are now executed. None can doubt of this, who consider what improvements have been made in these arts, since they were first invented.</P>
<P>This universality of language will tend to cement the world of mankind so as to make them <HI>one,</HI> in a higher degree, and to great∣er advantage, than otherwise could be. This will absorb the dis∣tinctions that are now kept up between nations speaking different languages, and promote a general, free communication. It is ob∣served, when there was but one language in the world, that the people were <HI>one.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xi. 6.</NOTE> And this will greatly facilitate their united ex∣ertions, to effect whatever may be for the public good.</P>
<P>Therefore, since there will be so many and great advantages, in having one universal language, understood and used by all man∣kind, and it will answer so many good purposes, when men shall be disposed to make a right improvement of it; and since it may be so easily effected, when men shall be united in piety and benev∣olence,
<PB N="78" REF="025635_0077_0FCEAC873B6A9A10"/>and wisdom shall reign among them; there is reason to think that God will so order things in his providence, and so in∣fluence and turn the hearts of mankind, as in the most agreeable manner to introduce the best language, to be adopted and used by all, in that day, in which great and peculiar favour and blessings will be granted to the world, far beyond those which had been given in preceding ages. And this is agreeable to the scripture, which speaks of that day, as distinguished and remarkable for the union and happiness of mankind, when they shall have <HI>one bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt, and one way.</HI> And this seems to be expressly predicted: When speaking of that time it is said, "Then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. iii. 9.</NOTE> These words have been un∣derstood in another sense; but the most natural and consistent meaning seems to be, That the people shall not then have a mixed language, speaking with different tongues, which would naturally separate them into different parties, and render them barbarians to each other in their worship: But God will so order things at that time, that one language shall be introduced and spoken by all; and which shall be more perfect, elegant and pure, free from those defects, inconsistencies, and that jargon, which before attended all, or most languages; that they may all, even all mankind, call up∣on the name of the Lord, with one voice, and in one language, to serve him with one consent; by which they shall be united in worship, and divine service, not only in heart, but in lip, as man∣kind never were before.</P>
<P N="4">4. The church of Christ will then be formed and regulated, ac∣cording to his laws and institutions, in the most beautiful and pleasing order.</P>
<P>This is implied in what has been said; but is worthy of a more particular attention. There will then be but one universal, ca∣tholic church, comprehending all the inhabitants of the world, formed into numerous particular societies and congregations, as shall be most convenient, to attend on public worship, and the in∣stitutions of Christ. There will be no schisms in the church then: Christians will not be divided into various sects and de∣nominations; but there will be a beautiful and happy union in sentiment, respecting the doctrines, worship and institutions of Christ; and all will be of one heart, and one way, and serve Christ with one consent. The ordinances of baptism and the
<PB N="79" REF="025635_0078_0FCEAC898568C7E8"/>Lord's supper, and all the institutions of Christ, will be attended in due order, with solemnity and decency; and being accom∣panied with divine efficacy, will have their proper and saving ef∣fect. All the children will be members of the church, having the initiating seal applied to them, and being solemnly devoted to Christ in baptism; and they will be faithfully brought up for him, and early discover their love to Christ, not only in words, but by obeying him, and attending upon all his institutions. The dis∣cipline which Christ has instituted, will be faithfully practised, so far as there shall be any occasion; and christians, by watching over each other in love, and exhorting and admonishing one another, will prevent, or immediately heal all offences. In those respects, and in others not here mentioned, and perhaps not thought of, the church of Christ will then be the best regulated, most beautiful and happy society that ever existed, or can be formed on earth. "When the Lord shall build up Zion, the church, he shall appear in his glory." Then, what is predicted in the sixtieth chapter of Isaiah, and many other prophecies of the same event, shall be fufilled. God says to his church, "Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee: Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, the joy of many generations. I will make the place of my feet glorious. Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God."
<NOTE PLACE="foot">*
<P>It has been a question, Whether in the Millennium, when the church shall be thus universal, and be brought to such a well regulated, holy and happy state, there will be any need of civil rulers, to preside and govern in temporal matters? It is said, that every thing which will be accessary of this kind, will be regulated and ordered by particular churches, and civil officers will not be needed, and will have nothing to do.</P>
<P>But when it is considered, that the church of Christ is not a worldly so∣ciety, and has no concern with temporal matters, and the concerns of the world, considered merely as such, or any farther than they are included in obedience to the laws of Christ: And that there will be need of regulations and laws or orders, with respect to the temporal concerns of mankind; it will appear proper and convenient, if not necessary, that there should be wife men chosen and appointed to superintend, and direct in worldly af∣fairs, whose business it shall be to consult the temporal interest of men, and dictate those regulations from time to time, which shall promote the public good, and the temporal interest of individuals.</P></NOTE></P>

5. Then christianity will appear in its true beauty and excel∣lence, and the nature and genuine effects of it will be more mani∣fest than ever before, and the truth and amiableness of it be ex∣hibited in a clear and striking light.</P>
<P>Christianity has hitherto been generally abused and perverted by those who have enjoyed the gospel; and but little of the genu∣ine spirit and power of it has appeared among those who have been called christians. They have, the most of them, disobeyed the laws of Christ, and misrepresented and perverted the doctrines and institutions of the gospel, to accommodate it to the gratifica∣tion of their selfishness, pride and worldly spirit; and have hated and persecuted one another unto death. They have divided into innumerable sects and parties, and have not been agreed in the doctrines and institutions of the gospel; but have embraced va∣rious and contrary opinions concerning them; and contended a∣bout them with wrath and bitterness. And the greatest part of the christian world have been as openly vicious, as the hea∣then nations, if not more so. And as the name of God was blasphemed among the Gentiles by the wicked lives of the Jews,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4.</NOTE> so the name of Christ has been blasphemed by infidels and others, through the various kinds of wickedness of those who have been called christians. By reason of whom, the way of truth has been evil spoken of."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. ii. 2.</NOTE> But few in the christian world, in comparison with the rest, have honoured Christ, by entering into the true meaning and spirit of the gospel, loving it, and living agreeable to it: And those few have been generally hidden and overlooked by the multitude of merely nominal christians. And genuine chris∣tianity is not to be found in the faith and lives of those in general who assume the name of christians; but in the Bible only, since the most who profess to know Christ, by their doctrines and works do deny him.</P>
<P>But in the Millennium the scene will be changed, and chris∣tianity will be understood and acted out, in the true spirit and power of it, and have its genuine effect, in the lives and conduct of all. And when it comes to be thus reduced to practice by all, it will appear from fact and experience, to have a divine stamp; and that the gospel is indeed the wisdom of God, and the power of God, forming all who cordially embrace it to a truly amiable and excellent character, and is suited to make men happy in this
<PB N="81" REF="025635_0080_0FCEAC8C7AFF8400"/>world, and that which is to come. Then all the disgrace and reproach, which has come upon Christ, his true followers, and upon christianity, by the wickedness and enmity of men, and the abuse of the gospel, shall be wiped off. This is foretold in the following words: "Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee, and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out, and I will get them praise and fame in every land, where they have been put to shame. I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zeph. xix, 10.</NOTE> After the various schemes of false religion and infidelity have been tried by men, and the evil nature and bad effects of them discovered, real christianity, as it is stated in divine revelation, when it shall be understood by all, and appear in universal practice, will shine with peculiar lustre and glory; and the beauty and excellence of it, and the happiness it produces, will be more apparent and affecting, and be more ad∣mired, by the contraft, than if no such delusion and false religion had taken place. This is represented in the last words of David the Prophet. "And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xxiii, 4.</NOTE>— When the sun rises in a clear morning, after a dark, stormy night, and the tender grass springs up fresh and lively, it is much more pleasant and refreshing, than if it had not been preceded by such a night.</P>
<P N="6">6. The time of the Millennium will be in a peculiar and emi∣nent sense and degree, <HI>The day of salvation,</HI> in which the Bible, and all the doctrines, commands and institutions contained in it, will have their proper and designed issue and effect; and that which precedes that day is preparatory to it, and suited in the best man∣ner to introduce it, and render it eminently the gospel day.</P>
<P>The Spirit of God will then be poured out in his glorious ful∣ness, and fill the world with holiness, and salvation, as flood, upon the dry ground. All the preceding influences of the Holy Spirit, in converting and saving men, are but the first fruits, which precede the harvest, which will take place in that latter day. This was typified in the Mosaic institutions. The most remarkable festivals were the Passover, the feast of the first fruits, and the feast of Tabernacles, upon which all the males in Israel were com∣manded to attend at Jerusalem. The Passover typifred the death
<PB N="82" REF="025635_0081_0FCEAC8DF953B478"/>of Christ, and he was crucified at the time of that feast. The feast of the first fruits, or Pentecost, as it is called in the New Testament, typified the first fruits of the death of Christ, in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and the conversion of men, when the gospel was first preached, which took place at the time of this feast."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 1.</NOTE> The feast of Tabernacles, which was "the feast of <HI>inga∣thering,</HI> which was in the end of the year;"

This is the time when Christ will see the fruit of the travel of his soul, and shall be satisfied. To this day most of the prophecies of Christ, and salvation, and of the good things which were coming to the church, have their principal reference, and they will have their chief fulfilment then. This is the day which our Lord said Abraham saw with gladness and joy. "Your father Abraham rejoiced (or leaped forward) to see my day: And he saw it, and was glad."
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">John viii. 36.</NOTE> He saw the day of Christ in the promise made to him, That in his seed all nations should be bless∣ed; which will be accomplished in the Millennium, and not be∣fore. This is the day of Christ, the day of his great success and glory. This is the gospel day, in comparison with which all that precedes it, is night and darkness.</P>
<P>Then the chief end of divine revelation will be answered. It has been given with a chief reference to that time, and it will then be the mean of producing unspeakably greater good, than in all ages before. It will then be no longer misunderstood, and per∣verted and abused, to support error and wickedness; but be uni∣versally prized more than all riches, and improved to the best pur∣poses, as the fountain of knowledge and wisdom. And all the institutions and ordinances appointed by Christ, will then have their chief effect. They will then be understood and take place in due order, and be attended in a proper manner; and the wis∣dom and goodness of Christ in ordaining them, will be seen and experienced by all. Then the gospel will be preached, as it never was before, since the days of inspiration; in which the minis∣ters of the gospel will be eminently burning and shining lights, exhibiting the important, affecting, glorious truths of the gospel, in a clear and striking light, and in a manner most agreeable and entertaining; which will fall into honest and good hearts, and
<PB N="83" REF="025635_0082_0FCEAC908813DB18"/>be received with the highest relish and pleasure, and bring forth fruit abundantly. The Sabbath will be a most pleasant and pro∣fitable day, and improved to the best and most noble purposes. And the administration of baptism and the Lord's supper, according to divine institution, will greatly conduce to the edification of the church, and appear in their true importance and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ulness, as they never did before; these and all other institutions of Christ, being appointed with special reference to that day, when they will have their chief use, and answer the end of their appointment.</P>
<P>As the winter in the natural world is preparatory to the spring and summer, and the rain and snow, the shining of the sun, the wind and frost, issue in the order, beauty and fruitfulness of the vegetable world; and have their proper effect in these; and the end of winter is answered chiefly in what takes place in the spring and summer, and the former is necessary to introduce the latter, and in the best manner to prepare for it: So in the moral world, or the church of Christ, what precedes the Millennium is as the winter, while the way is preparing for the summer, and all that takes place has reference to that happy season, and is suited to introduce it in the best manner and most proper time, when the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spel, so far as it respects the church in this world, and all the institutions and ordinances of it, will have their genuine and chief effect, in the order, beauty, felicity and fruitfulness of the church.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> In which is considered which thousand years of the world will be the Millennium, and when it will begin.</HEAD>
<P>ALL who attend to the subject of the Millennium, will naturally inquire, When this happy time will take place; and how long it will be before it shall be introduced? And some who have undertaken to find from scripture, and to tell the precise time and the year when it will begin, have been evidently mis∣taken,
<PB N="84" REF="025635_0083_0FCEAC91C11563B8"/>because the time on which they fixed for this, is passed, and the event has not taken place. From this, some have concluded, that it is uncertain whether there will ever be such a time; and others have exploded all attempts to find from scripture when this time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be.</P>
<P>Though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be good reason to conclude that the exact time, the particular day or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear, of the beginning of the Millennium cannot be known, and that it will be introduced gradually, by different successive great and remarkable events, the precise time of which cannot be known before they take place; and that the prophecies respecting it, are so formed on design, that no man can certainly know when the event predicted shall be accomplish∣ed, within a year, or a number of years, until it is manifest by the accomplishment, as such knowledge would answer no good end, but the contrary: Yet there is no reason to suppose that this is left wholly in the dark, and that it is impossible to know, within a thousand, or hundreds of years, when this glorious day shall commence, which is so much the subject of prophecy, in which the glory which is to follow the sufferings of Christ, and the afflic∣tions of his church, will chiefly confist, so far as it relates to the transactions of time.</P>
<P>Though it may be evident from scripture, that the seventh thousand years of the world, will be the time of the prosperity of the church of Christ, on earth; yet this event may come on by degrees, and be in a measure introduced years before that time, and the church may not be brought to the most comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>te and happy state of that day, but still have farther advances to make, after this seventh thousand years begin, and continue some years after they are ended: So that the particular year of the beginning or end of this time, cannot be known, before it actually takes place.</P>
<P>It is thought that there is reason to conclude from divine reve∣lation, that the seventh millenary of the world, will be the time in which the church of Christ will enjoy a sabbath of rest, and be brought to its highest and chief prosperity in this world, which is so much the subject of scripture prophecy; and that the end of the world, and the day of general judgment, will take place soon after this Millennium is over. The following observations are designed to point out some of the evidence of this.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="025635_0084_0FCEAC933A695E80"/>
It has been already observed, That the creation of the natural world in six days, and the seventh being appointed to be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> day of reft, does afford an argument that the moral world, or the church and kingdom of Christ, of which the natural world is a designed type, in many respects, will be fix thousand years in forming, in order to be brought to such a state, as in the best <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to enjoy a thousand years of rest, peace and prosperity; a day in the natural world, in this instance, representing a thousand years in the moral world: And that time being thus divided into <HI>sevens,</HI> to have a perpetual rotation to the end of it, denotes that the world is to stand but seven thousand years, as "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day." And that this has been handed down as the opinion of many ancients, both Jews and Christians.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Sect. I. Page 36, 37. with the note there.</NOTE> It is acknowledged, that this argument is not sufficient to establish this point, considered by itsulf alone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s but it is thought to have some weight, when joined with other arguments from seripture which comcide with this, and serve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o strengthen it.</P>
<P>It is observable, that the number <HI>seven</HI> is the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted ntr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ber mentioned in scripture, in many respects, and is a <HI>sacred member</HI> above all others. And in the Mosaic ritual, which contained many typical institutions, the Israelites were cummanded, not only to observe every seventh day, as a day of rest; but every seventh year as a Sabbath, and year of rest. And the seventh month in every year, was a festival and sacred month, above all other months of the year. In this month was the feast of Tabernacles, which was to be observed seven days with great joy. On the first day of this month was the feast of trumpets, when the trumpets were to be blown through all the land, which was a type of the extraor∣dinary preaching of the gospel which will introduce the Millen∣nium. And on the tenth day was their annual and most solemn fast, on which they were to confess their sins and afflict their souls, and atonement was made for them. Which was a figure of the repentance and extraordinary humiliation, to which the inhabit∣ants of the world will be brought, by the preaching of the gospel, attended with the dispensations of divine providence suited to promote this, previous to their being raised up to the prosperity and joy of that day. And then the joyful feast of ingathering, in the end of the year, came on, on the fifteenth day of the same
<PB N="86" REF="025635_0085_0FCEAC9599266E48"/>month. This was a type of the happy, joyful Millennium in the seventh and last thousand years of the world, in which vast multi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>des, even most of the redec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, will be gathered into the church and kingdom of Christ; in comparison with whom, all who shall have been saved before this time, are but the first fruits of the pur∣chase of Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>.</P>
<P>It is evident that this feast of Tabernacles in the seventh month, was a designed type of the Millennium, from what has been now observed, and what has been said on the three most remarkable feasts appointed in the law of Moses, in the preceding section; but this evidence is strengthened, and made certain, by what is said by the Prophet Zechariah. When he is speaking of the Milleanium, and predicting that happy day, he says, "And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> against Jerusalem, shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, <HI>and to keep the feast of Tabern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cles.</HI>"
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zech. xiv. 16.</NOTE> By the feast of Tabernacles are meant the enjoy∣ments and blessings of the Millennium, of which all nations shall the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> partake, and which were typified by that feast.</P>
<P>All these things seem to point out the seventh thousand years of the world to be the time of the Millennium. But there is yet greater evidence of this, which will serve to strengthen what has been observed, and shew that it is not mere conjecture.</P>
<P>The prophecies in the book of Daniel, of the rise and continu∣ance of the little born, and of the time in which the church shall be in a state of affliction; and those in the Revelation, of the con∣tinuance of the beast, who is the same with the born; and of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ation of the afflicted state of the church during that time, when examined, and compared, will lead to six on the seventh thousand years of the world to be the time of the Millennium.</P>
<P>In the Revelation, the time of the continuance of the beast, af∣ter his deadly wound was healed, is said to be sorty and two months.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Chap. xiii. 5.</NOTE> And the time in which the church should be trodden down, afflicted and oppressed, is said to be sorty and two months, a thousand two humdred and sixty days, and a time, and times, and half a time.

<PB N="87" REF="025635_0086_0FCEAC96FA625D88"/>days. And a time, and times, and half a time, are three years and a half, which contain forty and two months, and a thousand two hundred and sixty days. So long the beast, the idolatrous per∣secuting power, exercised by the Bishop of Rome, the Pope, is to continue; during which time, the church of Christ is to be op∣pressed, afflicted and opposed, represented by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> city being trodden under foot by the Gentiles; the two witnesses prophecy∣ing in sackcloth: and a woman persecuted and flying into the wilderness, to hide herself from her enemies, where she is fed and protected during the reign of the beast, which is to continue a thousand two hundred and sixty years, a prophetical day being a year. At the end of those years, the Pope and the church of Rome, of which he is the head, will be destroyed. And accord∣ing to the representation in the Revelation, the kingdom of the devil in the world, will fall at the same time, and the kingdom of Christ be set up on the ruins of it, and the Millennium will take place.</P>
<P>If it were known when the Bishop of Rome first became what is designed to be denoted by the beast, the time of his fall, and of the end of the church of Rome, and of satan's kingdom in the world, when the Millennium will communce, could not be ascertained up a year. But as this beast rose gradually from step to step, till he became a beast, in the highest and most proper sense, this involves the subject in some degree of uncertainty, and renders it more dif∣ficult to determine, at which considerable increase and advance of the Bishop of Rome in power and influence, the thousand two hun∣dred and sixty years began. He had great influence, not only in the church, in ecclesiastical matters, but in the temporal affairs of the Roman empire, and of the kingdoms which were erected in it, by the invasion of the northern nations, before he was publicly ac∣knowledged and declared to be Universal Bishop; which was done in the year of Christ, 606. This greatly increased his influence and power in the christian world; and the church was now become ex∣ceeding corrupt. If the 1260 years be reckoned from this time, they will end in the year 1866, seventy four years from this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, viz. 1792. But the Pope did not become a temporal prince and publicly assume civil jurisdiction, till the year 756, when Popie, the king of France, then the most powerful prince in christendom, made him prince over a large dominion, and he assumed civil au∣thority, and upon this he subdued three kings or kingdoms, and
<PB N="88" REF="025635_0087_0FCEAC98A7E0E878"/>they fell before him, according to the prediction of him in the prophecy of Daniel.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. vii. 8, 20, 24.</NOTE> And he soon had such power over the na∣tions, as to set up an emperor in Germany, to be his tool, by whom to raise himself to universal empire, reserving to himself and claiming power over the emperor, and over all kings in the chris∣tian world, to let them up and crown them, or depose them when he pleased.</P>
<P>This is the most remarkable epoch; when the Pope became a beast, in the most proper sense, from whence his reign is to be dated. Twelve hundred and sixty years from this date, 756, will end near the beginning of the seventh thousandth years of the world. But as he rose to this height gradually, and was a beast in a lower sense long before this, it is reasonable to suppose that he will fall by degrees, until his usurped power is wholly taken from him, and the false church of Rome, the great whore, utter∣ly destroyed; and that he has been falling many years; and that as the time of his reign draws nearer to a close, more remarkable events, by which he and that church will come to total ruin, will take place in a more rapid succession. But this will be more par∣ticularly considered in the next section.</P>
<P>Therefore, these prophecies of the rise and fall of Antichrist, or the beast, and the time of his reign, and of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> state of the church of Christ, fix the end of these, and of the reign of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the world of mankind, near the beginning of the seventh thou∣sand years of the world; when the Millennium will be introduc∣ed; though many things will take place before that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, by which the Pope and his interest will gradually decline and sink, and in favour of the church and kingdom of Christ, to prepare the way for the introduction of the Millennium.</P>
<P>In the book of Dainel, the same idolatrous, persecuting power, and the time of the continuance of it, and of the oppressed state of the church, are predicted: And the time is fixed, and expressed by a time, and times, and an half, or the dividing of time;
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dan. vii. 25. xii. 7.</NOTE> which is the same mentioned by St. John, in the Revelation, and is 1260 prophetic days; that is, so many years, as has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> above. There it is said by him who interpreted to Daniel the vision of the four beasts, "The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be divers from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and tread it down and break it in pieces." This is the Roman empire. "And the ten horns out
<PB N="89" REF="025635_0088_0FCE9E4A75249D40"/>of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise. And another shall arise after them, and he shall subdue three kings. And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws: And they shall be given into his hand, until a time, and time, and the dividing of time."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dan. v.i. 23, 24, 25.</NOTE> This last horn, king or ruling power, is evidently the same with the little horn mentioned in the eighth chapter; and is the same with the beast when he was recovered to life, after he had been wounded unto death, which St. John saw, that is, the Pope of Rome, in whom the power and idolatry of this empire is revived and continued. The character given of each, is the same in substance; and the time of their continu∣ance is the same, which much end, according to every probable calculation, at or about the end of the sixth thousand years of the world, or about two thousand years after the incarnation of Christ.

<P>In the eighth chapter of Daniel, we have a different representa∣tion of this same kingdom, power or empire, by a little horn which came forth out of one of the four horns, into which the Grecian empire founded by Alexander the great, was divided, some time after his death. This is the Roman or fourth and last empire, upon the destruction of which the kingdom of Christ is to prevail, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the world. Daniel describes this little horn, as it appeared to him in the vision, in the following words: "And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeded great toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land. And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven, and it cast downsome of the host, and of the stars, to the ground, and stamped
<PB N="90" REF="025635_0089_0FCEAC9B827AB848"/>upon them. Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice, by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground, and it practised and prospered."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Verse 9, 10, 11, 12.</NOTE> And this vision is explained by the angel interpreter in the follow∣ing part of the chapter.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Verse 23—25.</NOTE> What is said of this horn respects the Roman kingdom and empire, from the beginning and end of it, the ruin of which shall open the way for the kingdom of Christ to flour∣ish in the world, and the reign of the saints on the earth. And what is said of this power or kingdom here, respects the idolatry that should be supported and practised by it, and the opposition it should make to God and his people, in which it should prevail, and have power to oppress and persecute the saints; and there is special reference to the Pope and those under his influence and direction, when he should be at the head of this empire, and rule in it, who is particularly designed in the seventh chapter, denoted by the little horn, "which had eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things; which should make war with the saints, and prevail against them; and speak great words against the Most High, and wear out the saints of the Most High."
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Verse 8, 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 23.</NOTE> This power, indeed, did oppose and destroy the mighty and holy people, and stand up against the Prince of princes, before it existed, and was exercised by antichrist, in the church of Rome. Jesus Christ the Prince of princes, was put to death by this power.— And this horn persecuted the church, especially at times, for near three hundred years after the death of Christ; all of which is includ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the description of the horn or kingdom, which is the chief subject of this chapter; but there is particular and chief reference to what this power would be and do, when in the hands of antichrist, for he, above all others, has spoken great things, and opened his mouth to blaspheme God and the saints: He has in∣troduced and promoted the grossest idolatry, and stood up against the Prince of princes; has magnified himself in his heart even to the Prince of the host, the Lord Jesus Christ; and has been the most cruel and bloody persecutor of the saints for many ages: He has cast down the truth to the ground, and practised and pros∣pered, and has destroyed vast numbers of the holy people, or the saints. Gabriel, who was ordered to make Daniel understand the vision, said to him, "Behold, I will make thee know what shall be <HI>in the
<PB N="91" REF="025635_0090_0FCEAC9D07459E38"/>last end of the indignation:</HI> For at the time appointed the end shall be."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Verse 19.</NOTE> His interpretation had chief respect to the latter end of this kingdom, under the reign of antichrist, in whose end the kingdom should be ruined, and exist no more.</P>
<P>The question is here asked, "How long shall be the vision con∣cerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?" Bishop Newton says, "In the original there is no such word as <HI>concerning;</HI> and Mr. Lowth righty observes, that the words may be rendered more agreeably to the Hebrew thus, <HI>For how long a time shall the vision last, the daily sacrifice be taken away, and the trans∣gression of the desolation continue, &amp;c.</HI> After the same manner the question is translated by the seventy, and in the Arabic version, and in the Vulgar Latin."</P>
<P>The answer is, "Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Verses 13, 14.</NOTE> These are no doubt prophetical days, a day being put for year. The time there∣fore specified is two thousand and three hundred years. All the difficulty in fixing on the time of the end of these days, lies in de∣termining at what time the reckoning begins. This is left in a degree of uncertainty, as is the beginning of the reign of antichrist, which is to continue twelve hundred and sixty years; the reason of which doubtless is, that it should not be precisely known to a day or year, when this time will end, till it shall be actually accom∣plished, while it is made certain, the time of the end is fixed, and they who are willing to attend to the subject, and make use of all the light that is offered, may have sufficient evidence to determine within a few years when the time will be, and not be left in a total uncertainty about it.</P>
<P>The little horn, which is the chief subject of this vision, and was to do such great things against the holy people, the church, came forth out of one of the four notable horns, toward the four winds of heaven, which grew out of the goat, after the one great horn was broken, which the goat had at first.
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Verse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> The goat is the king of Grecia, or the Grecian empire, erected by Alexander the great, who was the first king, or the great horn.
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Verse 21.</NOTE> After the death of Alexander, and when his successors in his family were extinct, four kings were set up, and divided the great empire between them into four kingdoms, which division was toward, or according
<PB N="92" REF="025635_0091_0FCEAC9E9036AE38"/>to the four winds, East, West, North and South. Cassander, one of the four kings, took the western part of the empire, or the wes∣tern kingdom, containing Macedon, Greece, &amp;c. Out of this horn came forth the little horn, which "waxed exceeding great, toward the South, and toward the East, and toward the pleasant land."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Verse 9.</NOTE> This horn Gabriel explains to be "A king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, who shall stand up."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Verse 23.</NOTE> The Romans are meant by this horn, who were west of Greece, and may be considered as included in the western part of the empire, which was one of the four horns, out of which they rose, and soon were conspicuous; and Prideaux says, "Their name began to grow of great note and fame among foreign na∣tions," by their conquests in a few, not above five or six twenty years, after the above mentioned partition of the empire of the goat, into four horns or kingdoms. And they were a distinct people, and doubtless made some figure, when the four horns first existed. From this time, and this small beginning, the Romans arose by their policy, power and conquests, until they arrived to a vast and universal empire. And as they existed as a people when the Grecian empire was divided into four kingdoms or horns, and they were really included in the western horn, and soon rose out of it, and went on and grew to universal empire, their beginning may properly be rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oned from the time when the western horn or kingdom arose, in which they were included, as they soon after that, became a distinct power and kingdom, and were a little horn, and proceeded to conquer and destroy the horn, out of which they came, and to subdue all the other horns.</P>
<P>This partitior of the Grecian empire into four kingdoms or horns, was just about three hundred years before the birth of Jesus Christ, or the beginning of the christian era. And as the incar∣nation of Christ was about the beginning of the fifth thousand years of the world, two thousand and three hundred years from the rise of the four horns will end at or near the beginning of the seventh thousand years of the world. Or if the be∣ginning of the little horn should not be reckoned from that time, but from the time when the Roman power or horn began to be conspicuo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and acknowledged among the nations, two thousand three hundred years from that time, will carry them but a few years beyond the beginning of the seventh thousand years of the world;
<PB N="93" REF="025635_0092_0FCEACA051CE1EE8"/>so that this number serves to confirm what has been observed from the other numbers in Daniel, and the Revelation, viz. That the reign of antichrist, who is the last head of the Roman empire, will end about the beginning of the seventh millenary of the world, when the Millennium will begin, and the meek, the saints, shall inherit the earth, take the kingdom and reign with Christ.</P>
<P>In the last chapter of Daniel, "One said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?" The answer is made in a very solemn manner, in the following words: "It shall be for a time, times, and an half. And when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be fin∣ished." He who shall scatter the power of the holy people or the saints, is the same with the horn, mentioned in the seventh chap∣ter, who should "Wear out the saints of the Most High;" which is the same event which is here expressed in different words. And the time of his doing this, is the same which is mentioned here: "And they shall be given into his hand, until a time, and times, and the dividing of time."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. vii. 15.</NOTE> That is, three prophetical years and an half, in which are 1260 prophetical days, which are put for so many years. And this is the same power which is called a beast in the Revelation, who was to do the same thing mentioned here, viz. It was given unto him to make war with the faints, and to overcome them! And the same time is there fixed for his doing this. "And power was given unto him to continue (or practise and make war) forty and two months," after he was recovered to life from being wounded unto death;
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. xiii. 3, 5, 7.</NOTE> which is just three years and an half, and twelve hundred and sixty days.</P>
<P>Daniel heard, but did not understand the answer, and therefore put the following question, "Then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?" The answer is, "From the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hun∣dred and ninety days. Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days." Here are two different numbers or times mentioned, and neither of them agrees exactly with the foregoing answer. In that, the time of the continuance of the persecuting power, which shall scatter and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>car out the faints, is limited to 1260 years. In the answer to
<PB N="94" REF="025635_0093_0FCEACA17AA70F78"/>Daniel's question, two different numbers of years are mentioned, when those evil things shall come to an end, and the prophana∣tion of the church, and the worship and ordinances of Christ, shall cease, and the church shall be restored to due order, and be blessed and brought to a happy, glorious state, viz. 1290, and 1335 years. The first is 30 years longer than the time mentioned above, and in the Revelation, and the last exceeds it 75 years. This seeming difference may be reconciled by observing, that these answers do not respect precisely the same event. The former expresses the time of the continuance and reign of antichrist, in which he shall oppress the church of Christ: And when he shall have accomplished to scat∣ter the power of the holy people, he shall be destroyed. The latter looks forward to the recovery of the church of Christ, from her low, afflicted, broken state, to a state of peace and prosperity, in the proper use and enjoyment of the worship, institutions and ordi∣nances of Christ, which had been to greatly corrupted by the false church of Rome. It may take some time to effect this, after the Pope and the church of Rome are wholly destroyed and extinct. As the corruption and perversion of the church, worship and or∣dinances of Christ, was brought on by degrees, and considerable advances were made in this, after antichrist arose, and the Pope became a persecuting beast; so doubtless the church will not be wholly purified when this beast shall be destroyed; but it will be some time after this, before all corruptions and errors in doctrine and practice, will be wholly extirpated, and the church appear in her true beauty, and come to a state of universal, established peace and prosperity. Within thirty years after the beast shall be slain, and his body destroyed and given to the burning flame, or at the end of 1290 years, the church may become universal, and all na∣tions be members of it; and it may arrive to a state of great pu∣rity and peace, and an end be put to all her troubles, and most of the wicked be swept off from the face of the earth, by some re∣markable event, and sudden stroke; by which the kingdom of fatan shall be nearly extinct; and his influence among mankind almost wholly cease. But the church of Christ may not arrive to the most pure and happy state which it shall enjoy, under forty or fifty years after this. For this happy period christians must wait; and they will be in a peculiar and high degree blessed, who shall come to this happy and glorious state of the church, when the first resurrection shall be universal and complete, and the Millennium
<PB N="95" REF="025635_0094_0FCEACA310A7BF88"/>state established, and brought to its full stature, and proper height in holiness and happiness, which took place in a considerable de∣gree, and might properly be said to have began a number of years before. But these events, and the precise time and manner of their taking place, will be fully known, and the prophecies by which they are foretold, will be better understood, when they shall be actually accomplished; and all the mistakes which are now made respecting them, will be rectified; until which time, they must be in some measure sealed. Nevertheless, it may be evident from divine revelation, that the end of the reign of antichrist draws near, and the time of deliverance of the church, from the dark and low state in which it has been near twelve hundred years, and of the ruin of the kingdom of satan in the world, is not far off; and that these great events will come on within two hun∣dred years, or about that time; and that the seventh thousand years of the world, is the time fixed for the prosperity of the church of Christ, and the reign of the saints on earth. And it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hoped that what has been now observed on this point, is sufficient to convince every unprejudiced, attentive inquirer, that there is satisfactory evidence from prophecy, and other things contained in scripture, that the predicted Millennium will take place at that time.</P>
<P>It has been observed, that as antichrist rose gradually, from one degree of influence and power to another, till he became a com∣plete beast, so this persecuting, idolatrous, antichristian power will fall by degrees, until it is wholly taken out of the way: And there may, and probably will be, 1260 years between the most remark∣able steps by which he rose, and as great and remarkable steps, by which he is to fall, and go into perdition.

<P>The time of the captivity of the Jews by the Babylonians, was fixed in the prophecy of Jeremiah to leventy years. But this prediction had refer∣ence to different beginnings and endings.

As the power and tyranny of the Bishop and church of Rome rose from less beginnings to their full height; so the fall is to be gradual, till it is completed: And from each remarkable advance, there are 1260 years, to as remarkable, successive events, by which the kingdom and the power of the beast shall decline, and be utterly destroyed.</P></NOTE></P>

The corruption and apostacy of the church had early begin∣nings, and the usurped, tyrannical, and worldly power of the Bish∣ops, especially of the Bishop of Rome, soon began to take place. The Apostle Paul, speaking of the grand apostacy which has ac∣tually taken place in the church of Rome, under the influence and power of the <HI>man of sin,</HI> that is, the Pope, says, that the seeds of all this were then sown, and this mystery of iniquity did then be∣gin to work with power and energy, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which was to be kept under powerful restraints for a while, but should openly ap∣pear and be acted out when these restraints should be taken off.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Thess. ii. 3—2.</NOTE> In the third century, "The Bishops assumed, in many places, a princely authority, particularly those who had the greatest number of churches under their inspection, and who presided over the most oppulent assemblies. They appropriated to their evangelical func∣tion, the splendid ensigns of temporal majesty: A throne sur∣rounded with ministers, exalted above his equals the servants of the meek and humble Jesus, and sumptuous garments dazzled the eyes and the minds of the multitude, into an ignorant venera∣tion for their arrogated authority."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History: Thiol Century, Chap. II.</NOTE> And about the middle of that century, STEPHEN, the Bishop of Rome, a haughty, ambi∣tious man, aspired to a superiority and power over all the other Bishops and churches, and his preeminence in the church univer∣sal, was acknowledged. From this time, to the reformation from popery in the sixteenth century, when the Pope began to fall in a remarkable degree, and lost a great part of his power and influence, which he is never like to regain, are 1260 years. Luther, the first reformer, arose in the year of Christ, 1517. If we reckon back from that time, 1260 years will carry us to the year 257, which is the very time in which STEPHEN, Bishop of Rome, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aimed and usurped the power and preeminence abovementioned, and which was, in some measure at least, granted to him.</P>
<P>And as this man of sin, rose higher and higher, and became more conspicuous by one remarkable step after another, in the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh centuries, until he was publicly in∣vested with temporal dominion, about the middle of the eighth
<PB N="97" REF="025635_0096_0FCEACA788E4B008"/>century, viz. in the year 756, when he became a complete beast, and assumed the greatest authority, both in civil and religious mat∣ters, in the christian world, and in fact had more power and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ia∣ence over all persons and things in the church and state, than any other man; so there is good reason to conclude, he will gradually fall, by one remarkable event after another, from the time of the reformation in the sixteenth century, when his power and influence in the christian world were so greatly eclipsed, until this son of per∣dition shall be utterly destroyed, not far from the end of the twen∣tieth century, or the beginning of the seventh thousand years of the world. And with the sall of this son of satan, the kingdom of satan, which has been so great and strong in this world for so long a time, will come to an end, and he will be cast out of the earth, and chained down in the bottomless pit: Which event will be succeeded by the kingdom of heaven, which shall compre∣hend all the men then on earth, in which the saints shall reign a thousand years.</P>
<P>The facts and events which have taken place since that time, especially in the present century, coincide with such a conclusion, and serve to strengthen and confirm it. The Pope and the hier∣archy of the church of Rome, are sinking with a rapid descent.— The kings and nations who once wandered after this beast, and joined to support and exalt this antichristian power, now pay little regard to him. They neither love nor fear him much, but are rather disposed to pull him down and strip him of his riches and power. The dissolution of the society of the Jesuits, banish∣ing them, and confiscating their riches, who were a great support of that church and the Pope; the kings taking from the Pope the power which he claimed, as his right, to nominate and ap∣point all the bishops to vacant sees, and actually taking it upon themselves to do this, by which a vast stream of money which used to be poured into the coffers of the Pope, is taken from him, and falls into the hands of these kings:—The increase and spread of light, by which the tyranny, superstition and idolatry of the church of Rome and its hierarchy are more clearly discerned, and exposed to the abhorence and contempt of men; and especially the great increase of the knowledge of the nature, reasonableness and importance of religious and civil liberty, and the rapid spread of zeal among the nations to promote these: All these are re∣markable events, which, among others not mentioned, serve to
<PB N="98" REF="025635_0097_0FCEACA9000B1BC0"/>confirm the above conclusion, that the Pope is falling with in∣creasing rapidity. And there is reason to expect from what has come to pass, and is now taking place, and from scripture prophe∣cy, that yet greater and more remarkable events will soon take place, and come on in a swift and surprising succession, which will hasten on the utter overthrow of the breast and all his adherents: And that the time predicted will soon come, when the ten horns, or kings, who have agreed in time past, and given their kingdom unto the beast, shall change their minds, and hate the whore, and make her desolate, and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xvi. 2.</NOTE> A number of these vials must have been already poured out, as the beaf▪ has existed above a thousand years already; and there∣fore the effects of the last vial, which include his utter destruction, will not reach much more than two hundred years from this time; and consequently these effects will soon begin to take place, if they have not already began in some measure.

<P>Some acquaintance with the history of the calamitous events which have taken place, answering to the prophetic description un∣der those vials which have been poured out, is necessary in order to know how and when it has been fulfilled, and how many vials appear to have already run out, and which is now running.— Mr. Lowman has taken pains to show from many credible histo∣rians, that the remarkable calamitous events which have taken place, and which have especially affected the beast and his follow∣ers, and brought great and distressing evils upon them, have an∣swered to the evils and events described in prophetic language, under the successive five first vials of wrath: And there appears to be satisfactory evidence that the judgments predicted under these vials, have already been executed on antichrist, and his supporters and followers: And that the reformation began by Luther, and the remarkable events attending it, was the judgment predicted by the pouring out of the fifth vial, to be inflicted on the beast and the church of Rome. This vial was to be poured out on the seat, or, as it is in the original, the throne of the beast—"And his kingdom was full of darkness, and they gnawed their tongues for pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m."

<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. xvi. 13, 14, 16.</NOTE> This is the first time that the false prophet is mentioned: And it appears from what is said of this false prophet, in the twentieth verse of the nineteenth chapter, that he is the same with the second boast, which is described in the thirteenth chapter, by which is meant the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rchy of the church of Rome, or the Pope and his clergy, in their ecclesiastical capacity, claiming to have the sole jurisdiction, and to be insolvable dictators in every thing that relates to christian saith and practice. The beast, as distinguished from the false prophet here, is the civil power of the Roman empire, with which the Pope in invested, which he has claimed and exercised, by which he became a beast.</P>
<P>The dragon is the devil, who is represented as a powerful, in∣visible agent, having a great hand in all the wickedness in the world, and has set up and animates the beast and false prophet,
<PB N="103" REF="025635_0102_0FCEACAD8D3AC7A0"/>making them instruments to answer his ends, being the spirit who works with all his power and deceptive cunning, in these children of disobedience; and who are his children in a peculiar <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> These spirits are therefore, the numerous spirits of devils who unite in one design, working miracles, or wonders, as the word in the original is sometimes rendered, which go forth unto the kings of the earth, and of the whole world; that is, to all men who dwell on the earth, great and small, high and low. What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the tendency and effect of these invisible, evil spirits, what they design and do accomplish, when thus let loose, and suffered to go forth into all the world, there can be no doubt.

<P>If any distinction is to be made between those evil spirits which are united in the same design, and like frogs pervade all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and assault all men, as the frogs did the Egyptians, in their attempts to seduce and corrupt them; especially those who live in the christian world; that which comes out of the mouth of the dragon, promotes infidelity, and influences and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> renounce all religion; especially that which is inculcated in the Bible. The spirit which proceeds from the mouth of the beast, inspires men with a worldly spirit, by which they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at∣tached to the things and enjoyments of this world, and angerly pursue them; either by gratifying their fleshly appetites and lusts, in beastly uncleanness, and intemperance in eating and drinking, frolick and wantonness; or by indulging an avaricious spirit, which leads to all kinds of unrighteousness, and oppression of each other, according to their power and opportunity: Or they eager∣ly pursue the honours of the world, in the gratification of pride and haughtiness, striving to outshine others in dress and high liv∣ing, or in distinguished posts of honour.

The spirit which comes out of the mouth of the false prophet, is a spirit of false religion and delusion, by which false doctrines and gross errors in principle and practice, are imbibed and propagated.</P>
<P>These spirits of devils unite and are agreed in one design, to pro∣mote all kind of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and wickedness among men, and to as great advance as they possible can, leading them to infidelity and impiety, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> endless train of gross errors and delusions, in matters of religion; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rying them on in a greedy pursuit of the enjoy∣ments of this world, in the indulgence of their lusts, and the grati∣fication of their love of their own selves, and their pride, in the practice of injustice and oppression, living in malice and envy, hat∣ing and speaking evil of one another, and engaging in fierce con∣tention, cruel and destructive war, and murder. By this the world in general, will be in arms against God, and his Son; and they will be gathered and knit together, as one man, in open war with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and all the friends of Christ on earth. This is doubtless <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by these spirits of devils, going out into the whole world, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. It is not meant, that they shall be gathered into one place on this globe, or any where alse; but that they shall be united with one heart in the same cause of sin and satan, against God, and his reveal∣ed truth and ways, in whatever part of the earth they live; and thus take arms, and rise in open rebellion, provoking the Almigh∣ty to battle, and, in a sense, challenging him to do his worst.— Thus they will be as really gathered to the battle, as an army are gathered together to engage in battle with another army, or to besiege a city.</P>
<P>"And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon." Armageddon is the mountain of Megiddo, at the foot of which the memorable battle was fought between the Canaanites, the enemies of Israel—and Barak, and the army under him, when Sisera and his host were defeated and utterly destroyed; which was a complete overthrow of the Canaanites, and issued in the final deliverance of Israel from their yoke and power. This was a type of the total defeat and over∣throw of the enemies of Christ and his church, which will issue in the peace and prosperity of the church in the Millennium state. This is intimated in the concluding words of the song of Deborah
<PB N="105" REF="025635_0104_0FCEACB07A2DE3F0"/>and Barak, in which this victory and deliverance is celebrated. "So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord: But let them who love him, be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judg. v. 11.</NOTE> There is therefore an allusion to the type, in this prophecy of the event which was typified by it, viz.—the overthrow of all the combined enemies of Christ and his church, in the battle of that great day of God Almighty. It cannot be reasonably inferred from this pre∣diction, that there will be a decisive battle between Christ and his followers, and their enemies, in any particular place. All that is signified by these words is, that as Jabin king of Cantaan gathered together a great army under Sisera, to fight with the God of Israel and his people, at the foot of the mountain of Megiddo; who were there overthrown and destroyed in battle, when "they fought from heaven, the stars in their courses fought against Sise∣ra:" So by the agency of the spirits of devils, under the super∣intendence and direction of divine providence, the world of man∣kind in general, and especially those in Christendom, will be so corrupted and obstinately rebellious, in all kinds, and the greatest degrees of wickedness, as to be united, and, in this sense, gathered together, all armed in a spiritual war against God, his cause and people. And their iniquity being full, and they ripe for the battle, God will arise as a man of war, and in his providence contend in battle with them, till they be utterly destroyed from the face of the earth. Thus "The wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs, they shall consume: Into smoke shall they consume away," and by this, way shall be made for the meek to inherit the earth, and delight themselves in the abundance of peace.

<P>But this battle is to come on under the next vial, which is the seventh and last. When mankind shall be prepared and gathered together, by the great degree of all kinds of wickedness, while God has been waiting upon them, even to long suffering, in the use of very powerful, and all proper means to reclaim and reform them, he will arise to battle, and by doing terrible things in right∣eousness, will manifest and display his awful displeasure with them, for their great wickedness, and obstinacy in rebellion against him; and the events will then take place which are predicted un∣der the seventh vial.</P>
<P>"And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air: And there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the
<PB N="106" REF="025635_0105_0FCEACB400C799A8"/>throne, saying, IT IS DONE." This vial being poured out into the air, denotes that it should affect and destroy satan's kingdom, and his followers in the world in general, who is the prince of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> power of the AIR. And the voice from heaven, saying, <HI>It is done,</HI> is a prediction that the events under this vial, by which the battle before mentioned is to be carried on and completed, will utterly destroy the interest and kingdom of the devil in the world, and finish the awful scene of divine judgments, on the antichristian church, and the wicked world in general. The prophecy then goes on to give a general and summary account of the battle of that great day, from the seventh verse to the end of the chapter, and the great and marvellous effects it will have upon great Baby∣lon, i. e. the church of Rome, and upon the nations of the world in general. There will be the greatest convulsions and revolutions in the political and moral world, that have ever been, attended with awful judgments upon men; which are predicted in prophet∣ic language, "And there were voices, and thunders, and light∣nings, and a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, to mighty an earthquake, and so great. And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found."— "And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: And great Babylon came into remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath." The great city, and great Babylon, seem to be one and the same thing, the church of Rome. In the next chap∣ter, this same false church is called "Babylon the great," and "The great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Verses 5, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> What is meant by this city being divided into three parts will be better known, when the prediction shall be accomplished. It doubtless intends, that which shall break the antichristian church into pieces, and will issue in the ruin of it, the fatal blow being struck. Perhaps it intends a division and opposition among those who have been the members and supporters of that church, by which this spiritual Babylon shall fall, or which shall hasten on the ruin of it; as a kingdom divided against itself, cannot stand, but is brought to desolation. In the prophecy of this kingdom of antichrist by Daniel, in the latter end of it, he says, "The king∣dom shall be <HI>divided;</HI> and by this it shall be partly broken.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dan. ii. 41, 42.</NOTE></P>
<P>"And the cities of the nations fell." Divine judgments, and a peculiar measure of wrath shall fall upon the christian world, in

The cities of the nations of the world, are their strength, defence and pride: These shall be demolished and wholly taken away, that they shall no more be able to tyrannize over one another.— The pride and power of Mahomeans and heathen nations, shall be made to cease by a series of divine judgments. "The day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up, and he shall be brought low. And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall. And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low, in that day. And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughti∣ness of the terrible."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. ii. 12, 13, 17. xiii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> The same is predicted in the following words: "I have cut off the nations, their towers are desolate; I have made their streets waste, that none passeth by: <HI>Their cities are destroyed,</HI> so that there is no man, there is none inhabitant. There∣fore wait upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey: For my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy."

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah viii. 21, 22.</NOTE></P>
<P>This battle is more particularly described in the nineteenth chapter, from the beginning of the eleventh verse, to the end of the chapter. "And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse; and he who sat upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteousness doth he judge and make war." This person is farther described, by which he appears to be the Lord Jesus Christ. "And the armies which were in heaven, followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean." This does not mean, that the inhabitants of heaven, or the saints on earth, will join in a visible army, and personally sight with the enemies of Christ and his church, and destroy them: But only that these shall join with Christ and be on his side, when he shall arise in his providence, and by his power destroy his and their enemies. In this sense, all heaven will be with him, when he shall come forth to battle in his providence, and execute his wrath upon men, in awful successive judgments, in which the angels may be used as invisible instruments of his vengeance: And he will do all this, in answer to the prayers of his church on earth, and in their cause, to vindicate and deliver them, and prepare the way for the prosperity of his church on earth. That he will be the great invisible agent in this battle, appears from the following words: And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it be should smite the nations: And he shall rule them with a rod of iron: And he treadeth the wine press of the tierceness and wrath of Almighty God." This is the battle of that great day of God Almighty. This awful seene proceeds and is yet farther described: "And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and be cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the great God; that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the
<PB N="110" REF="025635_0109_0FCEACBB0371AEF0"/>flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that fit on them, and the flesh of all men, both small and great." This is a strong, figurative, prophetic expres∣sion of the great slaughter and terrible destruction of mankind, when God Almighty shall come forth to battle, and manifest his hot displeasure and terrible wrath, in the judgment he will inflict on them. The representation of this battle, and the issue of it goes on, and "I John saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies <HI>gathered together,</HI> to make war against him who sat on the horse, and against his army." These are the same who are mentioned, chap. xvi. 14, 16, as <HI>gathered together</HI> to the battle of that great day of God Almighty, the meaning of which has been explained. And in this war and battle, the beast and the false pro∣phet were taken and destroyed, with their adherents. "And the remnant were slain with the sword of him who fat upon the horse, which sword proceedeth out of his mouth, and all the fowls were filled with their flesh." By <HI>the remnant,</HI> are meant the rest of mankind, who by their sins make war with Christ, and are not in∣cluded in the beast and false prophet, and their followers, who be∣long to the kingdom of antichrist. Their being slain by the sword which proceeded out of the mouth of Christ, does not mean their conversion, but their falling victims to his vengeance, which is expressed by the fowls being filled with their flesh.</P>
<P>The fame battle and slaughter of men, is represented and pre∣dicted in figurative prophetic language, in the fourteenth chapter, where John describes a vision which he had of one like unto the Son of man, who sat upon a white cloud, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp fickle. And it was said un∣to him, "Thrust in thy sickle and reap; for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. And he thrust in his fickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped. And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle." And it was said unto him, Thrust in thy sharp fickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. And the angel thrust in his fickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great wine press of the wrath of God. And the wine press was trod∣den without the city, and blood came out of the wine press, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred fur longs."</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="025635_0110_0FCEACBD32780370"/>
Upon this vision it is to be observed, that by the harvest of the earth, and the clusters of the vine of the earth, are meant the in∣habitants of the earth, or mankind in general. And reaping the harvest, and gathering the clusters of the vine of the earth, fignifies the slaughter and destruction of the inhabitants of the earth; not every one of them indeed; for in the harvest and vintage, some ears of corn are commonly left standing, which escape the sickle, and a few scattering grapes are left on the vine when the clusters in general are gathered: And that this slaughter and desolation, which shall be made of the inhabitants of the world, will take place in consequence of their apostacy, and obstinate continuance and increase in sin, until they are become ripe, fully ripe, for this dread∣ful execution and destruction, by divine vengeance: Therefore, that this reaping, and the harvest, and gathering the clusters of the vine of the earth, will not be a merciful dispensation towards the inhabitants then in the world; but the execution of divine ven∣geance, and an awful exercise and display of the displeasure and wrath of God, in the evils which shall fall on men, for their per∣severance and increase in wickedness. This is represented and expressed in a striking manner, by the figure of casting the vintage into the great wine press of the wrath of God, and the large and amazing quantity of blood which proceeded from thence; figni∣fying the great and general slaughter, and terrible sufferings of mankind, when this time of his wrath shall come.</P>
<P>From this view of the events predicted under the sixth and se∣venth vials, it appears, that while the sixth vial is running, the way will be preparing for the overthrow of spiritual Babylon.</P>
<P>One event will take place after another, which will greatly weaken and remove the power and influence of the Pope, among the nations in Christendom, by taking away his riches, by drying up the stream of wealth, and the removal of other things, by which the church of Rome has been made strong, and stood as impreg∣nable for many ages. But this will not be attended by any general reformation of professing christians, or revival and great increase of the true church of Christ; nor will the moral state of the chris∣tian world, or of mankind in general, be reformed and grow bet∣ter, but the contrary. By the evil influence which the beast and the hierarchy of the church of Rome, has had in the world, and by the power and agency of satan, the unrestrained lusts of men will kurty them on to all kinds of wickedness; so that it will rise to a

<P>The prevailing, unrestrained wickedness of men, which has been how mentioned, by which they shall be gathered unto this battle, is described by the Apostle Paul, in the following words: "This know also, that in the last days, perilous times shall come. For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en shall be lovers of their ownselves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, covenant breakers, false ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>users, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those who are good, traitors, heady, highmind∣ed, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof."

<P>The true church of Christ will subsist and continue in this evil time of the prevalence of the powers of darkness; but the number of real christians will be small; and many, even of them, if not
<PB N="113" REF="025635_0112_0FCEACBF7B83E6A0"/>the most, will probably be weak and low in their christian exercises, by the influences and uncommon power of those evil spirits, and in too great a degree conformed to this world. They will be hated, opposed, and trodden down, by the wicked, and be in an afflicted, suffering state in this dark and evil day. They will be in a great measure hidden and unknown, and the cause of Christ and of truth will be reproached, and appear to be almost lost; and the true followers of Christ, his sheep, will be scattered into corners in this cloudy and dark day.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxiv. 12.</NOTE> Whether wicked men, and enemies to the true servants of Christ, will persecute them unto death, and renew this horrid work, of which so much has been done in former ages, in this time when iniquity will abound to such a great degree, cannot be now determined, by any thing said in scripture respecting it. It is thought by most, that since the Pope is brought so low, and his power and influence is still sinking so fast; and so much light is spreading in favour of civil and religious liberty, showing the reasonableness and importance of it, and the unreasonableness and folly of a persecuting spirit; and liberal sentiments respecting religion are propagated and increasing, per∣secution on account of religious sentiments or practice, is near come to an end, and never will be revived and practised again.— This may appear most probable: But though the antichristian church should never persecute the faithful followers of Christ again, and a persecuting spirit should wholly cease among pro∣fessing christians of all denominations; yet infidels, who condemn all religious persecution, in every degree and form, in which it has been practised, and boast of their liberal sentiments and spirit, with respect to this; and use it as a strong and conclusive argument against christianity itself, that professed christians have, in so many instances, persecuted others; even <HI>these infidels,</HI> or their successors, may find true christians, their doctrines and practices, to be so disagreeable and hateful to them, and, in their view, so hurtful to society, and so contrary to all that, in which they place their own happiness, and that of mankind, that having all restraints taken off, and the power being put into their hands, they may think these men ought not to be suffered to live; and that it is for the good of society to have them extirpated, and put to death, unless they can be brought to renounce their sentiments and practices, by persuasion or punishments; and so become as determined,
<PB N="114" REF="025635_0113_0FCEACC1873B5950"/>cruel persecutors of christians, as any have been in past ages.— If this should take place, it will make a new, and perhaps greater and more striking discovery of the wickedness of the human heart, especially of the hearts and real character of this sort of men, than ever has been exhibited before. And they who now know what is in man, from the character given of him in scripture, and by the discovery mankind have made of their hearts, by words and deeds, and from a true acquaintance with their own hearts, must be sensible that nothing can prevent even men of this cast presecut∣ing christians, but restraints from heaven. But, however, perhaps this discovery of what is in man, is reserved to be made after the Millennium shall be over, in the rise of Gog and Magog, when it may be exhibited, in many respects, to greater advantage, and so as to answer more important ends.</P>
<P>Though the true church of Christ must be in a low, dark state, in many respects, under this vial, yet there will doubtless be re∣vivals of religion, and an increase of converts to real christianity, in many different places, and truth may be getting advantage, and more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>learly distinguished from error, by those who have eyes to see; and christianity be more and more refined in doctrines and practice, from the various errors and corruptions, which have been introduced among the true followers of Christ; and every thing, and all events, will serve to bring on and introduce the Millennium, in the best manner, and in the most proper time.</P>
<P>The battle of that great day of God Almighty, is to come on under the seventh vial, as has been observed. When the iniquity of the world of mankind shall be full, and they shall be united in open rebellion, and, in this sense, gathered together, and armed against heaven: And after God has waited long upon them in the use of all proper means to reclaim them, especially the christian world; and they are become fully ripe for destruction, he will come forth to battle against them, and execute most fearful judg∣ments upon them, and destroy them in a manner and degree, which shall manifest his awful displeasure with them, for their obstinacy in all kinds of wickedness. When these briars and thorns are set against God in battle, he will go through them and burn them together.

So God punished the nation of the Jews, by destroying them, and laying waste Jerusalem, and the temple. When they had filled up the measure of their sins, wrath came upon them to the uttermost. This was a figure or type of this greater, more dreadful and general battle, under the seventh vial, when "The Lord shall come out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity, and the earth shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. xxvi. 21.</NOTE></P>
<P>This battle, it has been observed, will not consist in the church or christians raising armies, and fighting and carrying on war with the antichristian party, or with the wicked world; or in a conflict between the former and the latter, respecting the truths and cause of Christ: But it will be commenced and carried on by Christ, while invisible in heaven, invested with all divine power in heaven and earth, in the exercise of his providence, bringing judg∣ments upon his enemies, and a wicked world, in such remarkable ways and manner, as to be a clear and remarkable manifestation of his presence and power; of his displeasure with a wicked world, for opposing him, his church and the gospel; and an incontestible evidence of the truth of christianity, by fulfilling his predictions and promises, taking vengeance on the enemies of his people, and effectually supporting them, and their cause. He will doubtless make use of instruments in this battle.</P>
<P>The holy angels may be made the instruments of many events which shall be full of evil to wicked men. And the true church of Christ, his witnesses in his cause, and against the delusions and wickedness of the antichristian church, and of the world, are re∣presented as having a hand in bringing upon their enemies all the evils which will come upon them; because they will take place in answer to their prayers, in their cause, and in order effectually to avenge his own elect of their adversaries.

<P>But multitudes of mankind will be destroyed by the more im∣mediate hand of God, by famine and pestilences, which will prevail in many countries, at different times, in an extraordinary manner, and to a degree never known before; by which vast multitudes will perish suddenly, and in circumstances very surprising and awful. And there will be earthquakes, and terrible storms of lightning and thunder, and inundations of water, by which many cities and places shall sink and be overflowed, with all the inhabi∣tants; and multitudes will perish by these, and innumerable other evil occurrents, which will take place in an unusual manner, and in quick succession; so that the hand of God will be visibly stretched out against the inhabitants of the world, to punish and destroy them for their wickedness; and the following prediction will be fulfilled, in the full and awful extent of it. "Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth. And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear, shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit, shall be taken in the snare: For the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake. The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly. The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage, and the trans∣gression thereof shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fall, and not rise again."

<P>This battle will not be fought at once, so as to be soon finished; but will be carried on through a course of years, probably for more than a century and an half, in order to make a suitable and suffi∣ciently clear display of the displeasure of God with a wicked world; and to give opportunity to men to repent and reform, when they are warned, called upon, and urged to it, by being made to suffer such a variety and long continued series of calamities, for their fins;
<PB N="117" REF="025635_0116_0FCEACC57A45E478"/>and to discover, and set in the most clear and striking light, the hardness, obstinacy and wickedness of the heart of man, while they continue disobedient and inflexible, under all these terrible dispen∣sations of providence, suited to awaken and reform them, to teach them the evil of sin, and the awful displeasure of God with them; and to warn them to fly from the wrath to come, and unto Christ, as the only refuge; and go on to revolt yet more and more, and blaspheme the hand which inflicts these evils. By all this will be more clearly manifested, than ever before, how totally lost and in∣finitely miserable mankind are, and their infinite need of a Re∣decemer; that no means that can be used, or methods taken to reclaim and save them, will be in the least degree effectual, unless the Spirit of God be given to change and renew their hearts, and therefore, that the salvation of men depends wholly on the mere sovereign grace of God, even all that good, holiness and salvation, which shall take place in the Millennium; and it will, in this re∣spect, prepare the way for that day of grace.</P>
<P>This battle and terrible slaughter and destruction of men in so many ways, and for so long a course of years, will greatly lessen the number of mankind in the world; so that in the close of this terrible scene, comparatively few will be left alive. Those will be the christians who shall be then members of the churches, and descendents from good people who have lived in former ages, and others who will then be true penitents, who will look back on the terrible scene which had taken place in the battle of the great day of God Almighty, and see, and have a clear and affecting convic∣tion of his displeasure with mankind, for their sins and the ter∣ribleness of his wrath; and will acknowledge the righteousness of it. They will consequently see the guilty, miserable, and utterly lost state of man, and their need of a Redeemer, to make atone∣ment for their sins, and the necessity of the Holy Spirit to renew their hearts, and form them to right, and truly christian exercises: And will be clearly convinced of the truth of all the great and im∣portant doctrines of the gospel, and cordially embrace them. And they will repent and humble themselves in the fight of the Lord, and earnestly, with united hearts, cry to heaven for the forgive∣ness of their sins, and for mercy on themselves, and on their chil∣dren, acknowledging their infinite ill desert, and flying to Christ, and sovereign grace through him, as their only refuge and hope. And then the scene will change. The battle will be over, divine
<PB N="118" REF="025635_0117_0FCEACC7A107FA78"/>judgments will cease, and there will be no more frowns on man, in the providence of God; but all dispensations and events will be expressions of kindness and mercy; and the Holy Spirit will be poured out on them and their offspring, and all shall be holiness to the Lord; and the Millennium will begin, and men will mul∣tiply and soon subdue the earth, and fill it with inhabitants.</P>
<P>As antichrist and the church of Rome, will have a large share in the cup of indignation and wrath which will be poured out; so all the christian world will have a distinguished portion of it, as the inhabitants of it are much more guilty than others. There is no reason to consider the antichristian spirit and practices to be confined to that which is now called the church of Rome: The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> churches have much of antichrist in them, and are far from being wholly reformed from the corruptions and wickedness, in doctrine and practice, which are found in that which is called BARYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>LOTS, AND A∣DMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. Her influence in promoting de∣lusion and wickedness extends, in some degree, to all the inhabit∣ants of the world, and more especially the christian world. She is the <HI>Mother</HI> of all the false doctrines, superstition, insidelity, and abominable practices in the protestant world. And where can the church be found, which is thoroughly purged from all these abomi∣nations? Some churches may be more pure, and may have pro∣ceeded farther in a reformation than others; but none are wholly clear of an antichristian spirit, and the fruits of it. There may be, and in many instances doubtless there is, much of the exercise of the spirit of antichrist, in opposing what is called antichrist, and the church of Rome; and by running into as great extremes ano∣ther way. The Apostle Paul said, this mystery of iniquity, the man of sin, which is antichrist, began already to work in the churches even in his day.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Thess. ii. 7.</NOTE> How much of this then, may it be reasonably thought, is to be found in most, if not all the churches now? In this view, the spirit and operation of antichrist are very extensive. And how few churches, or individual christians, have so far come out from this mother of harlots, and abominations of the earth, as not to be in any degree partakers of her fins, so as not to receive of her plagues? And while the sixth vial continues to run, it is not to be expected that the protestant churches in general will grow more pure; but the evil spirits which are gone forth,
<PB N="119" REF="025635_0118_0FCEACC8F5D8BE88"/>will promote and spread still greater corruption in doctrine and practice, by which they will be more ripe for divine judgments, and prepared to suffer in the battle under the seventh vial. The purest churches, and real christians, will soffer much in this battle, and few will go wholly unpunished. By this the rebels, or false hearted professing christians, will be purged out from among real christians, and these shall be purified and made white, and tried <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but the wicked shall do wickedly.

<P>The Jews have suffered greatly for their peenliarly aggravated wickedness, in rejecting and crucifying the Son of God; and they are now, and have been for near two thousand years, in a state of great affliction, and under the manifest displeasure of heaven, to a great and distinguished degree. They yet continue a people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> tinguished from all other nations, though scatterrd all over the world, as outcasts and vagabonds; and will continue thus a dis∣tinct people down to the Millennium. But though they have suf∣fered so much, they yet continue as obstinate as ever in rejecting Christ, and in all their sins. And there is reason to think they will not escape the battle of the great day of Almighty God; but great and new calamities will fall upon them, by which they may be much diminished, so as to be left few in number, compared with what they have been, or are now. And the threatning denounced against that people by Moses, will then be executed on them, in the full meaning and extent of it: "And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude: Because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the Lord thy God."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxviii. 62.</NOTE> But God will not make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ull end of them, which he probably will do of some, if not of many other nations.</P>
<P>The revolutions which will take place in this battle, will open the way for their return to the land given to their ancestors; and they which are left will repent and return to the Lord Jesus Christ, against whom, they and their fathers have finned, and unto their own land, and will become an eminently excellent part of the christian church, who shall multiply, and fill all that vast tract of land given to Abraham and his posterity, from the river of Egypt, to the great river Euphrates,

But whether they will continue a distinct people from all other christians, through the whole time of the Millennium, or be so in∣termixed with others, as not to be distinguished from them, will be determined by the event: But the latter is most probable, as the ends of their being preserved in such a state of distinction, will then be answered; and those circumstances and things, which have been, and still are, the means of their continuing a distinct and separate people, will then cease; such as circumcision, and their observance of other Mosaic rites. When they shall become christians, their name by which they are now distinguished will be lost, and they will be absorbed in the christian church, the true Israel of God, where there is neither Jew nor Greek, but all are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n Christ: And then there will be one fold, and one shepherd. And then, by this event, the following prediction will be fully ac∣complished: "And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen! For the Lord God shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name."

<P>THAT the above representation of this battle, which will be previous to the Millennium, and will introduce it, taken from the passages in the Revelation which have been considered, is just, and agreeable to the true sense of them, farther appears, and is confirm∣ed by other parts of holy scripture, especially by the prophecies of this same event, recorded in the Old Testament.</P>
<P>The destruction of the world of mankind by a flood, and the preservation of Noah and his family, who were by this brought into a new world, to be replenished by them, may be considered as a typical and prophetic representation of the great battle with the wicked world, previous to the Millennium; by which the wicked will be swept off the earth, and the true church of Christ will be delivered and preserved, and the way opened for its pros∣perity, and filling the earth.</P>
<P>The series of judgments brought upon Pharaoh and the Egyp∣tians, for their disobedience to JEHOVAH, and oppressions of his people, and their dreadful overthrow in the Red Sea, to prepare the way for the deliverance of Israel, was also a prophetic type of this great battle. So was the destruction of the inhabitants of Canaan, in order to introduce the people of Israel, and put them in pos∣session of that land. Therefore, reference is had to this in the representation of the battle of that great day, as has been observed.</P>

David was a man of blood, carried on great wars and destroyed much people, and many nations, who were enemies to him, and the people of God; and by his conquests prepared the way for the peaceable and glorious reign of Solomon, and the building of the temple. In this, David was a type of Christ, when he shall go forth, clothed with a vesture dipt in blood, and in righteousenss make war, and destroy the nations of mankind, his enemies, to prepare the way for the Millennium. Solomon was a type of Christ reigning in the Millennium, when the church shall rise to a state of beauty and glory, of which Solomon's temple was a type, when the meek shall inherit the earth, and delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</P>

<P>Balaam, in his remarkable prophecy of Christ and his kingdom, speaking of this latter day, when the Roman empire shall come to an end, and Christ shall have the dominion, represents this event as attended with great destruction of men. "Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that re∣maineth in the city. And he took up his parable, and said, "Alas, who shall live when God doth this!" This expresses a great and general destruction of men, so that comparatively few of them will be left alive.

Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people; for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people." This prophecy is very parallel with that which has been mentioned, which relates to the great battle.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. xviii. 20. xix 1, 2.</NOTE> The same events ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>redicted in the following words of Moses: "There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.

<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxiii. 16, 27, 28.</NOTE> In these words, God is represented as riding forth to thrust out and destroy the enemies of his people; and upon this the prosperity of his church, the true Israel, is introduced. This prophecy therefore coincides with the description of the battle in the Revelation, as introductory to the Millennium. The same events are predicted in the prayer or song of Hannah. "He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in dark∣ness; for by strength shall no man prevail. The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces: Out of heaven shall he thun∣der upon them.

<P>This battle, by which the wicked will be destroyed, and the reign of Christ and his church on earth introduced, is frequently brought into view and predicted in the book of Psalms. The following predictions of this kind, are worthy to be observed:— "Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron, thou shalt dash them in pieces
<PB N="123" REF="025635_0122_0FCEACCF413C77A0"/>like a potter's vessel."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. ii. 8, 9.</NOTE> There is reference to this prediction and promise in the following words of Christ: "And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations; and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to pieces, even as I received of my Father."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. ii. 26, 27.</NOTE> The followers of Christ are said to do what he does for them, and in their behalf in destroying their enemies, as they are engaged in the same cause, and are with him in these works of vengeance, and they who have overcome, and have arrived to heaven, will be with him in a peculiar man∣ner, when he shall come forth to fight this great battle, and dash the nations of the world into pieces, as a potter's vessel is broken. Therefore, there is again reference to those words in the second Psalm, when Christ is represented as riding forth to the battle there described, followed by the armies in heaven, comprehending all who shall then have overcome. "And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: And he shall rule them with a rod of iron: And he treadeth the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God."
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rev. xix. 14, 15.</NOTE> This is cer∣tainly the same with the battle of that great day of Almighty God, mentioned in the sixteenth chapter, as has been shown; and is predicted in the words now quoted from the second Psalm.— There is a prediction of the same battle described in the nineteenth chapter of the Revelation, in the following words: "Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty; with thy glory and thy majesty. And in thy majesty ride prosperously, because of truth and meekness, and righteousness: And thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies, whereby the people fall under thee."
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Psal. xlv. 3, 4, 5.</NOTE> In the next Psalm, the prosperity of the church is prodicted, which will take place in the Millennium; and the battle by which it will be introduced and effected is also described. "There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of our God. God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early. The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: He uttered his voice, the earth melted. Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth. He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth, he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder, he burneth the chariot
<PB N="124" REF="025635_0123_0FCEACD0C3105128"/>in the fire. Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth."</P>
<P>The twenty first Psalm contains a prediction of Christ, and foretells the destruction of the wicked, as introducing his reign on earth, and the prosperity and joy of the church. "Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies, thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee. Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: The Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them. Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men: For they intended evil against thee; they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform. Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings, against the face of them. Be thou exalt∣ed, Lord, in thine own strength: So shall we sing and praise thy power."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vers. 8—13.</NOTE></P>
<P>That the wicked shall be cut off and destroyed from the earth, that the saints may inherit it, is foretold throughout the thirty seventh Psalm. "Evil doers shall be cut off: But those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be. But the meek shall inherit the earth, and delight themselves in the abundance of peace. Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the earth: When the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it. The transgressors shall be destroyed together; the end of the wicked shall be cut off. But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord," &amp;c.</P>
<P>The same thing is brought into view in the seventy fifth, seventy sixth, and ninety seventh Psalms. "God is the judge, he putteth down one, and setteth up another. For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same; but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them. All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted. In Judah, is God known, his name is great in Israel. In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion. There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Thou art more glorious and excellent than
<PB N="125" REF="025635_0124_0FCEACD262EE17C8"/>the mountains of prey. The stout hearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: And none of the men of might have found their hands. At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep. Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared and was still, when God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. He shall cut off the spirit of princes: He is terrible to the kings of the earth." "The Lord reigneth, let the people rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof. Clouds and darkness are round about him, righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne. A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about. His lightnings enlightned the world: The earth saw, and tremb∣led. The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord; at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols.— Worship him all ye gods." This battle is brought into view, and foretold in the 110th Psalm. "The Lord said unto my Lord, fit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion; rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath, (i. e. in the great day of battle.) He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries."</P>
<P>In the prophecy of Isaiah, this battle, as it has been explained, is often brought into view, as connected with the prosperity of the church of Christ on earth, and introductory to it: Some instances of this will be mentioned. In the five first verses of the second chapter, there is a prophecy of the happy state of the church in the last days, that is, in the Millennium. In the four next verses is a descrip∣tion of the corruption, worldliness and idolatry of the visible church, and consequently of the world in general, as the reason of the displeasure with them, and his punishing them. And from the tenth verse to the end of the chapter, the manifestation of his displeasure, in his fighting against them, and punishing them, is described. "Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty. The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is
<PB N="126" REF="025635_0125_0FCEACD44980D0C8"/>proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up, and he shall be brought low. And the idols he shall utterly abolish. And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth."</P>
<P>The eleventh chapter contains a prediction of the Millennium, and of the slaughter of the wicked of the earth, which shall make way for it. "With righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity, for the meek of the earth: And he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his sips shall he slay the wicked."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Verse 4.</NOTE> These last words are parellel with those in the Revelation, by which this battle, and the effect of it are expressed. "And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of iron. And the remnant were slain with the sword of him-who sat on the horse, which sword proceedeth out of his mouth."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. xix. 15, 21.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the thirteenth chapter is a prediction of the same thing: "Howlye, for the day of the Lord is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty. Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath, and fierce anger, to lay the earth desolate: And he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it. And will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniqui∣ty; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible."
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Verse 6—11.</NOTE> What is said in this chapter, has reference to ancient Babylon, and the destruction of that, and of other nations, in order to the deliverance and restora∣tion of Israel. But it evidently has chief reference to the destruc∣tion of spiritual Babylon, and all the wicked in the world, in order to the deliverance and prosperity of the true, spiritual Israel of God, and will be most completely fulsilled in the latter, of which the former are types and shadows. As those prophecies which have a primary respect to the type, do generally, if not always, look forward to the antitype; and have their full and chief ac∣complishment in that, and the events whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> relate to it.</P>
<P>The twenty fourth chapter is wholly on this subject, and de∣scribes the battle of that great day of God Almighty, and the slaughter of the wicked, in clear and striking language, in conse∣quence of which, the church and people of God shall spread and
<PB N="127" REF="025635_0126_0FCEACD553EFE990"/>prosper. "Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the in∣habitants thereof. The earth shall be utterly emptied; for the Lord hath spoken this word. The earth mourneth and sadeth away: The world languisheth and fadeth away: The haughty people of the earth do languish. The earth is also defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. There∣fore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they who dwell therein are desolate: Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left. The city of confusion is broken down: Every house is shut up, that no man may remain. In the city is left de∣solation, and the gate is smitten with destruction. When thus it shall be, in the midst of the earth, among the people, there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as the gleaning of grapes, when the vintage is done. They shall lift up the voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the Lord," &amp;c.</P>
<P>Upon this prophecy it may be observed, that it is a prediction of great calamities on the inhabitants of the world in general, as a punishment for their sins, by which the earth is defiled; they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>v∣ing transgressed the laws of God, changed his ordinance, and broken the everlasting covenant. They have broken the covenant of grace and peace, made with No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h and his children, which, if it had been strictly observed, would have transmitted blessings, both holiness and happiness, to all mankind, to the end of the world. By violating this covenant, corruption and iniquity, and all the idolatry and abominations which have taken place, or ever will be practised among men, have been introduced. And by breaking the everlasting covenant made with Abraham, and trans∣gressing the laws, and changing the ordinances, which have been given and published by Moses, and the Prophets, by Jesus Christ, and his Apostles, which, had they been observed, would have pre∣served the church uncorrupt, and spread true religion and holiness over the whole earth; by disregarding and violating all these, the world is filled with wickedness, which will continue and increase, until mankind in general shall be ripe for that punishment, which God will inflict in those calamities and judgments, which will de∣stroy, and sweep from the earth, the greatest part of the inhabit∣ants; so that there will be but comparatively <HI>few men left, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> the few olives which remain on the tree, after it is shaken, and the scat∣tering
<PB N="128" REF="025635_0127_0FCEACD6BB39D1C8"/>grapes, which hang on the vine, after the vintage is over. 'Those who shall be left when the battle is over, will lift up their voice, and fing for the majesty of the Lord. They will behold the terrible works of God, in which they will see his terrible majesty, and tremble, submit, approve, and adore, and praise and pray. And then the Millennium will begin.</P>
<P>The prophecy goes on, and the same events, as to substance, and this battle, and the consequence of it, are described in other words: "Fear and the pit, and the snare are upon thee, O in∣habitant of the earth. The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly. The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be moved like a cottage, and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fall, and not rise again." This battle is described in the Revelation, in the same figurative language: "And there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake and so great. And every island fled a∣way, and the mountains were not found."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xvi. 18, 20.</NOTE> "And it shall come come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. And they shall be gathered together as prisoners are gather∣ed in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison; and after many days shall they be visited.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">What is meant by the host of the high ones, and the kings of the earth being <HI>visited</HI> after many days, is not so clear, at first view, and perhaps it is not now understood. God is often said in scripture to <HI>visit</HI> those whom he punishes, and the word here in the original is frequently translated, to punish. They who are shut up in prison, are often confined there, to be taken out after some days, and receive their punishment. When it is here said, "And after many days shall they be visited;" may not the meaning be, that those high ones, and kings of the earth shall no more appear in this world; but shall be shut up in prison until the day of judgment, when they shall be brought forth and punished? As the fallen angels are bound in chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment, so these unjust men will be reserved unto the day of judgment, to be punished. When it is said of Zedekiah, that he should be carried a captive to Babylon, it is added, "And there shall he be, until I visit him, saith the Lord." Jer. xxxii. 5. That is, until God should take him out of the world by death, and to judgment; so that he should never reign as king any more.</NOTE> Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the Lord of hosts shall reign in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously." This prediction respects the great men and kings of the earth, who ex∣alt
<PB N="129" REF="025635_0128_0FCEACD95F430570"/>themselves in pride and wickedness, and tyrannize over men, and describes their overthrow in this battle. They shall be taken as prisoners, be punished for their pride and tyranny, and shut up that they may do no more mischief. Thus God "will cut off the spirit of princes, and be terrible to the kings of the earth."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxvi. 12.</NOTE> And it is here said, that the Millennium shall follow upon this, in the reign of Christ and his church, "When the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d of hosts shall reign in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously." "Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed." That is, then there shall be such spiritual light and glory in the flourishing of the kingdom of Christ on earth, and so superiour to all the light and glory of the natural world, as that the latter shall be utterly eclipsed, and appear to be worthy of no regard, compared with the former.</P>
<P>The three next chapters are a continuation of prophecy of the same event, viz. the judgments which are to be inflicted on the false and degenerate professors of religion, and the world of man∣kind in general, previous to the prosperity of the church and king∣dom of Christ in the world, which will be evident to the careful judicious reader; and that the predictions contained in them, coincide with those which have been mentioned. It is needless to transcribe any particular passage here, except the following:— "Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide thyself as it were for a little moment, un∣til the indignation be overpassed. For behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: The earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai. xxvi. 20, 21.</NOTE> This must be a great and dreadful day of bat∣tle, punishment and vengeance, which shall fall on the inhabitants of the earth in general, when all the blood which has been, and shall be shed, from the beginning of the world to that day, shall be required at their hands. There is no reason to think, that this punishment has yet been inflicted; but it will doubtless be executed by the battle of that great day of God Almighty, men∣tioned in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>xteenth chapter of the Revelation; and more partic∣ularly described, in the fourteenth and nineteenth chapters, which have been considered; and in the foregoing prophecies of Isaiah, which have been now mentioned. The words which follow those transcribed above, are, "In that day, the Lord with his
<PB N="130" REF="025635_0129_0FCEACDA96CD3C08"/>fore great and strong sword, shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent, and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea." The same event is here predicted, of which there is a prophecy in the twentieth chapter of the Revela∣tion, viz. of the dragon that old serpent, which is the devil and fatan, being laid hold of, and bound and cast into the bottomless pit. And the same consequence of this with respect to the church is here foretold, as is described there, viz. the prosperity of it, by the special favour and presence of God. "In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine. I the Lord do keep it, I will water it every moment: Left any hurt it, I will keep it night and day." While the battle is going on, and God is punishing the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity, his people will be hid as in a secret chamber; but when it is over, they will become as a flourishing, fruitful vineyard, producing abundance of red wine, in consequence of the peculiar favour and care of Jesus Christ, and the abundance of heavenly divine influences.</P>
<P>The thirty fourth, and thirty fifth chapters of Isaiah, contain a prophecy of the Millennium, and of the day of battle which will precede it, which will consist in the punishment of the world for their iniquity. "Come near, ye nations, to hear, and hearken, ye people: Let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of it. For the indignation of the Lord is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies. He hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaugh∣ter. For it is the day of the Lord's vengeance, and the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion. Strengthen ye the weak hands, confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: Behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and fave you. Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the de∣sert," &amp;c "And the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away."</P>
<P>In the forty first chapter of Isaiah, God, speaking to the church, and promising the good things and prosperity which were in store
<PB N="131" REF="025635_0130_0FCEACDC06476C00"/>for it in the days of the Millennium, says, "Behold, all they that are incensed against thee, shall be ashamed and confounded: They shall be as nothing, and they that strive with thee, shall perish. Thou shalt seek them, and shall not find them that con∣tended with thee: They that war against thee, shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought. Behold, I will make thee a new, sharp threshing instrument, having teeth; thou shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and make the hills as chaff. Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: And thou shalt rejoice in the Lord, and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel."</P>
<P>In the forty second chapter, God makes promises to his church, which are to be accomplished in their fulness, in the days of the Millennium, and speaks of the war and battle in which he will destroy his enemies, to open the way for the good thing which was to be done for the church. "The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: He shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies. I have long time holden my peace, I have been still, and refrained myself: Now will I cry like a travailing woman, I will destroy and devour at once. I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools. And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not, I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them."</P>
<P>The fifty ninth and sixtieth chapters, are wholly on this subject of the Millennium. In the fourteen first verses of the fifty ninth chapter, the great degree of wickedness of the world of mankind is described. And then God is represented as greatly displeased, and rising to battle, to punish men for their evil deeds. "And the Lord saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment. And he saw that there was no man, and he wondered that there was no intercessor: Therefore, his arm brought salvation unto him, and his righteousness, it sustained him. For he put on righ∣teousness as a breastplate, and an helmit of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke. According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence. So shall
<PB N="132" REF="025635_0131_0FCEACDDA1CFFD98"/>they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him." And to this battle, this work of judgment and vengeance, succeeds the day of light and salvation to the church: Those who are left, shall repent and humble themselves, and "fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to them that turn from trans∣gression in Jacob." It will be then said to the church, "Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee."—The prophecy of the Millennium goes on through the sixtieth, sixty first, and sixty second chapters.</P>
<P>There is a parallel representation of this battle in the sixty third chapter, as executed by the same person who is exhibited in the nineteenth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>apter of the Revelation, riding forth to make war in righteousness, and fighting this same battle, in which the wicked then on earth will be slain. "Who is this that cometh from Edom, with died garments from Bozrah?
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bozrah was in the land of Edom. The Edomites, were implacable enemies to the people of God, and are in the prophecies of Isaiah, and else∣where, put for the enemies of God and his church in general, who shall be destroyed, as the Edomites were, of whom the Edomites, and their destruc∣tion were a type.</NOTE> This who is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save. Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him who treadeth in the wine fat? I have trodden the wine press alone, and of the people there was none with me: For I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury, and the blood shall be sprinked upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment. For the day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come. And I looked, and there was none to help, and I wondered that there was none to uphold: Therefore, mine own arm brought salvation unto me, and my fury it upheld me. And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth."</P>
<P>The same thing is predicted in the sixty sixth chapter: "A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord who rendereth recompence to his enemies. And the hand of the Lord shall be known towards his servants, and his in∣dignation
<PB N="133" REF="025635_0132_0FCEACDF531C2E70"/>towards his enemies. For behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his an∣ger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. For by fire, and by his sword, will the Lord plead with all flesh; and the slain of the Lord shall be many." These predictions of the slaughter and destruction of the wicked, are here intermixed with promises of salvation and prosperity to the church: "Rejoice ye with Jeru∣salem, and be glad with her, all ye who love her: Rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her: That ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations: That ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory. For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream. And when ye fee this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb."</P>
<P>A passage in the tenth chapter of Jeremiah, seems to refer to the same event. The folly, idolatry, and great wickedness of the people and nations of the earth, is mentioned and described in the first part of the chapter, upon which the following prediction is uttered: But JEHOVAH is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting King: At his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation. Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens, and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from un∣der those heavens."</P>
<P>In the first part of the twenty fifth chapter, there is a prophecy of the captivity of the Jews, and of other adjacent nations, by Ne∣buchadnezzar; and when their captivity during seventy years should be ended, Jeremiah foretells the ruin of Babylon, and the land of the Chaldeans. And the evil that was coming on the nations of the earth, which should attend the destruction of Ba∣bylon, is represented by ordering Jeremiah to take the wine cup of wrath, and cause all the nations of the earth to drink of it. And as the destruction of ancient Babylon, and the judgments which came on many other nations, was an eminent type of yet greater and more remarkable destruction of spiritual Babylon, and of all the nations of the earth, which will attend that, the prophecy is car∣ried on beyond the type, and looks forward to the antitype, which is common in scripture prophecy; and expressions are used which cannot be applied to the former, to the type, in their full extent
<PB N="134" REF="025635_0133_0FCEACE0898E9FF0"/>and meaning, but to the latter, the antitype, and therefore the prophecy is accomplished but in part, and in a lower degree in the former; but fully and most completely in the latter: Therefore, the Prophet goes on, and uses expressions toward the close of the prophecy, which refer chiefly to the battle in which antichrist, and the nations of the earth will fall. Such are the following: "Therefore, prophesy thou against them all those words, and say unto them, The Lord shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation, he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, a∣gainst all the inhabitants of the earth. A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth: For the Lord hath a controversy with the nations: He will plead with all flesh, he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day, from one end of the earth, even unto the other end of the earth: They shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Verse 30—33.</NOTE> The Prophet goes on to predict the evil that should come on the shepherds, and the principal of the flock, by whom are meant the kings and great men among the nations, who are to be brought down and destroyed in the battle,

<P>There is another prophecy of this in the thirtieth chapter of Jeremiah. Here the deliverance of the church from her oppressors, and from all her sufferings and trouble, is promised; which shall be attended with the utter overthrow and destruction of the wick∣ed, and all her enemies. That this prophecy looks beyond the deliverance of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity, and the evil that came on their enemies then, to the greater deliverance of the church from spiritual Babylon, and the general destruction of the wicked which shall attend it, of which the former was a type, is evident, not only from a number of expressions and promises which were not sully accomplished in the former, and have re∣spect to the latter; but from the express promise, that God will raise up David their king to reign over them, by whom must be
<PB N="135" REF="025635_0134_0FCEACE2177A96F0"/>meant Jesus Christ, the Son of David, and of whom David was an eminent type. This will appear, by attending to the following passages: "Alas! For that day is great, so that none is like it: It is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be delivered out of it. For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him. But they shall serve the Lord their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them. For I am with thee, saith the Lord, to save thee. Though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet I will not make a full end of thee. Behold, a whirlwind of the Lord goeth forth with fury, a con∣tinuing whrilwind, it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked. The fierce anger of the Lord shall not return, until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: In the latter days ye shall consider it."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Verses 7, 8, 9, 11, 23, 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the book of Daniel, there is prophecy of the same event. "And at that time," (i. e. when antichrist is to be destroyed, which is predicted in the paragraph immediately preceding these words) "shall Michael stand up, the great Prince who standeth for the children of thy people" (that is, Jesus Christ, who will sup∣port and deliver his church) "And there shall be a time of trou∣ble, such as never was fince there was a nation, even to that same time," (this is the time of the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttle of that great day of God Almighty) "And at that time, thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book." This is the time of the deliverance of the church from the power of antichrist, and from all wicked men, her enemies, and of her entering upon the prosperous, happy state, in which the saints will reign on earth a thousand years.</P>
<P>The Prophet Joel speaks of the same events. From the twenty eighth verse of the second chapter of his prophecy, is a prediction of the Millennium, and the preceding evils that shall be inflicted on mankind: "And it shall come to pass afterwards, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh," &amp;c. "This prophecy began to be fulfilled, when the Holy Spirit was first poured out after the as∣cention of Christ; but this, as has been before observed, was but the first fruits, and the prophecy will be fulfilled only in a very small part, before the harvest shall come in the days of the Millennium.
<PB N="136" REF="025635_0135_0FCEACE44F1C1290"/>At the same time he speaks of the great evils, and terrible events which shall take place: "The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be delivered." The Prophet goes on in the next chapter to speak more particularly on this subject: "For behold, in those days and in that time, when I shall bring a∣gain the captivity of Judah, and Jerusalem, I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people, and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land."</P>
<P>Judah and Jerusalem are put for the church of Christ, being a type of that, as has been observed. The captivity of the Jews in Babylon, and their return from it, is typical of the afflicted, suffer∣ing state of the church during the reign of antichrist, and the de∣liverance of it from this state on the fall of antichrist, and in the Millennium. This is therefore meant, when it is said, "In those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem." When the children of Moab, Ammon, and Edom, came with a great army, combined together to destroy Judah, Jehoshaphat was directed to go forth with the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem and meet them; and had a promise that he should have no occasion to fight with them; but should stand still and see the salvation of the Lord, because the battle was not their's, but God's. Accordingly they went out, and stood still, and saw their enemies fall upon, and destroy each other, until they were all wasted away. Jehoshaphat and his people went out to their camp, and found great riches, silver and gold, and much spoil; and they spent three days in gathering it▪ and on the fourth day they assembled in the valley to bless and praise the Lord, which was from that called, "The valley of Berachah." This is the valley of Jehoshaphat. And to this story, these words of the Prophet Joel refer.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See 2 Chron. 20th Chapter.</NOTE> Moab, Ammon, and Edom, the enemies of Israel, were a type of the enemies of the church and people of God, under the gospel dispensation, among all nations. This battle and their destruction of the enemies of Judah and Jerusalem in the valley of Jehoshaphat, was a type of the overthrow of all the enemies of Christ and his church, when they shall be gathered to the battle of
<PB N="137" REF="025635_0136_0FCEACE600B7C6E0"/>that great day of God Almighty. This prophecy therefore, is a prediction of the same event which is described in the sixteenth chapter of the Revelation. Here it is said, "I will gather all na∣tions, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people." That is, will punish and destroy them for their opposition to me and my church. There it is said, "The kings of the earth and of the whole world, were gathered to the battle of that great day. And he gathered them together to a place called in the Hebrew tongue, Armaged∣don." Which passage has been before explained.</P>
<P>The Prophet farther enlarges on this subject in the following part of this chapter:
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Verie 9, &amp;c.</NOTE> Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles: Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near, let them come up. Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears; let the weak say, I am strong. Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: Thither cause thy migh∣ty ones to come down, O Lord. Let the heathen be wakened and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about. Put ye in the fickle, for the harvest is ripe; come, get you down, for the press is full, the fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ever∣flow, for their wickedness is great. Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of decision; for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision. The sun and moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining. The Lord shall also roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth shall shake; but the Lord will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel." Every one who at∣tends to this passage, will observe what a striking similitude there is between this description of a battle, and that in the Revelation, which has been considered. God is here represented as fighting the battle against all the heathen, and destroying multitudes on multitudes. All the heathen, even all nations are gathered toge∣ther, all armed for war, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat, and there are cut off in this valley of decision. In the Revelation all the nations of the earth are gathered together to battle at Megiddo, typifying the same thing with the valley of Jehoshaphat, and there they are s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain. God ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> his mighty ones to come down. And John says, "I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse:
<PB N="138" REF="025635_0137_0FCEACE8B1A24898"/>And he that sat upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteousness doth he judge, and make war. And his name is called, The word of God. And the armies in heaven followed him upon white horses." Here there is a command to "put in the fickle, for the harvest is ripe: Come, get you down, for the press is full, the fats overflow, for the wickedness is great." Much the same representation is made of this battle in the Revelation,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. xiv. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp;c.</NOTE> which has been particularly mentioned already. The Prophet Joel goes on to the end of his prophecy describing the happy state of the church, which shall succeed this battle, which has never yet taken place, and is like other descriptions of the Millennium state, by the Prophets. "Then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no stranger pass through her any more. And it shall come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk. Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land. But Judah shall dwell forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation."</P>
<P>The Prophet Micah, prophesied of Christ and his kingdom, in the extent and glory of it in the latter day; and of the destruction of the wicked men, and the nations of the world, in favour of the church of Christ, and in order to the prosperity of his people.— All this is contained in the fifth chapter of his prophecy. "And He (i. e. Christ) shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God: And they shall ahide; for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth. And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles, in the midst of many people, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep; who if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver. Thine hand shall be lift up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off. And I will execute vengeance in anger and sury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard."

<P>The prophecy of Zephaniah has respect to the battle of that great day of God Almighty, and the succeeding happy and pros∣perous state of the church in the Millennium. It has indeed a primary respect to the evils and punishment brought upon Jeru∣salem and the Jews by the Chaldeans, for their apostacy and idol∣atry;
<PB N="139" REF="025635_0138_0FCEACEA06BFF378"/>and to the calamities and destruction which came upon the nations at that time, and previous to the restoration of the Jews; and to their restoration from their captivity, and return to their own land; which were types of the much greater and more im∣portant events, in the last days, in which all nations will be more immediately concerned; and to which the prophecy has an ulti∣mate and chief respect. It was fulfilled but in part, and in a small degree, in the former events; and will have the chief and com∣plete accomplishment in the latter; as has been before observed concerning other prophecies of the same kind. Jerusalem in her most pure state, when the statutes and ordinances which God had prescribed, were in some good degree observed, was a type of the true church of Christ. Therefore, under this name, and that of Mount Zion, and Israel, the Prophets speak of the true church in all future ages. But Jerusalem, considered in her most corrupt state of apostacy, was a type of the false church of Rome, and of all christian churches when they apostatize from the holy doctrines and precepts of the gospel. Therefore, Christ is said to be cruci∣fied in the great city, by which is meant the aposta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e church of Rome, and all who partake of her corruptions; because he was crucified at Jerusalem, which was then a type of that great city, in her apostacy, and enmity against Christ, and his true church.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xi. 8.</NOTE> The nations round about the land of Israel and Judea, and all those who at times afflicted and oppressed the visible people of God, and were enemies to them; were types of the enemies of the church of Christ, in the time of her affliction; especially of all the idolatrous nations and wicked men, who oppose the pros∣perity of the church, and are to be destroyed, in order to her deliv∣erance and salvation. With these observations in view, this proph∣ecy may be read, and the whole of it applied to the battle and events which will take place previous to the introduction of the Millennium, predicted in the Revelation, under the seventh vial; and to the prosperity of the church which will then commence. Then it will have its full accomplishment; and many of the expressions in it, considered in their most natural and extensive meaning, cannot be accommodated to any events which have taken place, and are not yet fulfilled. Some of these will be now mentioned. The prophecy begins with the following words:—
<PB N="140" REF="025635_0139_0FCEACEB043E70E8"/>"I will utterly comsume all things from off the land,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The word in the original translated <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d,</HI> is the same which in other places in this prophecy, and in many other places in scripture, is translated <HI>earth,</HI> and doubtless should have been so translated here, and in some other passages which will be transcribed.</NOTE> faith the Lord. I will consume man and beast: I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling blocks with the wicked, and I will cut off man from off the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd (the earth) saith the Lord. Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord God: For the day of the Lord is at hand: For the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid his guests. The great day of the Lord is ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d. The mighty men shall cry there bitterly. That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, a day of the trumpet and alarm against the senced cities, and against the high towers. And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, be∣cause they have sinned against the Lord: And their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as dung. Neither their sil∣ver, nor their gold, shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord's wrath; but the whole land (earth) shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: For he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land (earth.) Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness; seek meekness: It may be ye shall be hid in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay of the Lord's anger. Therefore, wait upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determina∣tion is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, and all my fierce anger:— For all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy." The parallel and likeness between this prophecy, and that of the battle in the Revelation, is worthy of particular notice. This is called "The great day of the Lord: The day of the Lord's wrath: A day of disiress and desolation: The day that God will rise up to the prey, to <HI>gather</HI> the nations, and assemble the king∣doms, to pour upon them his indignation, and fierce anger."— In the Revelation, the whole world were gathered to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. The words, THAT great day of battle, seem to have reference to some day which had al∣ready
<PB N="141" REF="025635_0140_0FCEACEC7A870070"/>been made known, and undoubtedly refer to the great day of God's wrath, which is mentioned in the prophecy before us, and by the other Prophets. "And he gathered them together into a place, called in the Hebrew tongue, Armageddon. And the seventh angel poured out his vial (of wrath) into the air. And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake and so great. And the cities of the nations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell.

And the remnant were s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain with the sword of him who sat on the horse; and the souls were filled with their flesh." In this prophecy it is said, "The Lord hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s guests." In the Revelation the fowls of heaven are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ted to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the supper of the great God, to eat the flesh of kings, &amp;c.</P>
<P>According to this Prophet, when the nations and kingdoms of the world have been gathered, and God has poured upon them his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dignation, even all his herce anger; and all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of his jealousy, the scene is changed, and the remnant which are left in the earth, the few afflicted and poor people, shall repent and pray, and humble themselves before God, and return and put their trust in him alone: And God will re∣turn to them in a way of mercy, and build them up, and they shall be comforted, rejoice and prosper. This is represented in the last chapter, from verse ninth to the end of the prophecy! "For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one con∣sent.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chapters xix, and xx.</NOTE> When the battle there described is over, the Millennium is introduced.</P>
<P>There is a prophecy by the Prophet Haggai to the same pur∣pose with the foregoing: "Again the word of the Lord came un∣to Haggai, saying, Speak to Zerubbabel, governour of Judah, say∣ing, I will shake the heavens and the earth; and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the beathen, and I will overthrow the chariots, and those who ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother. In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, I will take thee, O Zerubbabel my servant, and will make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hagg. ii. 20, 21, 22, 23.</NOTE> Zerub∣babel was a type of Christ, and what is here said of the type was not fulfilled in him; but is to be fulfilled in Jesus Christ the anti∣type, when he shall reign on the earth, and his church fill the world, and "he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high."
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Isai. lii. 13.</NOTE> In order to this, the great changes are to take place, represented here by shaking the heavens and the earth, and by overthrowing the throne and strength of all the kingdoms and nations, and their being destroyed by the sword: Which is the battle represented in the Revelation, by thunders and lightnings, and a great earth∣quake, and the falling of the cities of the nations, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Prophet Zechariah also speaks of these things. He pro∣phesies of the Millennium, and of the destruction of all the people and nations who oppose the interest of the church, as preceding the days of her prosperity, and introductory to it. "And in that day will I make Jerusalem (the true church of Christ) a burden∣some stone for all people: All that burden themselves with it, shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be <HI>gather∣ed together</HI> against it. In that day, saith the Lord, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness; and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness. In that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and he that is feeble among them at that day, shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of the Lord before them. And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem."

For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished, and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city." This is the gathering of the kingdoms and nations of the whole world, unto the battle, by the unclean spirits which go forth to corrupt the world, and arm them against God, and his people, by the practice of all kinds of wickedness, by which the best part of the church will be greatly corrupted; and the saints will suffer very much, being besieged on all sides by very wicked men, mentioned in the Revelation,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xvi. 13, 14.</NOTE> which has been explained.</P>
<P>The Prophet goes on to describe the battle of that great day of God Almighty, which is mentioned in the Revelation: "Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> shall the Lord go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.

<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Verses 3, 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>Malachi prophesied of the Millennium, and the preceding slaughter of the wicked, in the battle of that great day of God Al∣mighty, in the following concise and striking language: "Behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my nature, shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves in the stall. And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet, in the day that I shall do this, faith the Lord of hosts."
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mal. iv. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>FROM the above detail it appears, that the prophecy in the Re∣velation of the Millennium, and of the manner in which it will be introduced, is agreeable to the ancient prophecies of these same e∣vents: That previous to this, the christian world, and mankind in general, will become more corrupt in the practice of all kinds of wickedness: That God will rise out of his place, and come forth to do his work, his strange work, to punish the world for their
<PB N="144" REF="025635_0143_0FCEACF1C3B1FFC8"/>wickedness, and manifest his high displeasure and anger with man∣kind, for their perverseness and obstinacy in rebellion against him, and in opposition to his church: That this is the battle of that great day of God Almighty, in which he will, by a course of va∣rious and multiplied calamities and fore judgments, greater and more general, and continued longer than any which have taken place before, reduce and destroy mankind, so that comparatively few will be left; an afflicted and poor people, who will repent and humble themselves before God, and trust in the mighty Saviour; for whom he will appear in great mercy, and pour down the Holy Spirit on them and their offspring; and they will multiply and fill the world. And thus the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, and the church will reign on earth a thousand years.</P>
<P>It appears reasonable and proper, that God should manifest his displeasure with the inhabitants of Christendom, and of the world, for their long continued abuse of his goodness, and of all the means used with them to reclaim them; and their perseverance in their opposition to Christ and his people, and increasing in all kinds of wickedness, while he has been waiting upon them, even to long suffering; by inflicting on them severe and awful judgments, and remarkably fearful punishments, to vindicate the honour of his own name; and avenge his church and people, who have been so greatly injured, despised and trampled upon; and that it may be made known by this, as well as in other ways, that the God of christians, the God and Saviour revealed in the Bible, is the true God. And this will give great instruction to those who shall be left, who will have a heart to perceive and understand. They will have before their eyes a lesson, suited most effectually to teach them the exceeding depravity and wickedness of man; and how real and dreadful is the divine displeasure and anger with sinners: How undone and utterly lost forever, all men are, without a Redeemer and Sanctifier; by whom they may be recovered from the power of sin and satan, and obtain the forgiveness of their sins, and the favour of God: How dependent they are on sovereign grace for all good, for every thing better than complete destruction; by which alone they are distinguished from those who persevere in their sins, and perish. And all this will tend to guard them against sin, to promote their repentance and humiliation, and to lead
<PB N="145" REF="025635_0144_0FCEACF39FEA8840"/>them to more earnest, constant and united prayer to God for mer∣cy, than was ever exercised before by men: And to ascribe all the favours they shall receive, which will then be much more abun∣dant than ever before, to the free, sovereign grace of God; and to give him the praise of all.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this section it was suggested, that by attend∣ing to the events which are to take place, according to scripture prophecy, before the commencement of the Millennium, farther evidence would come into view, that this will not be much sooner or later, than the beginning of the seventh millenary of the world. This evidence has been now produced. The sixth vial is now running, and probably began to be poured out before the end of the last century, and will continue to run a considerable part of the next century; under which the power of antichrist is to be greatly weakened, and the way prepared for his utter overthrow: And at the same time, the christian world, and man∣kind in general, will be so far from reforming, that they will grow more and more corrupt in doctrine and practice, and greedily run into all manner of vice and wickedness, until they are prepared for the battle of that great day, and ripe to be cut down and de∣stroyed, by a series of divine judgments, which will be inflicted under the seventh vial, and will issue in the introduction of the Millennium.</P>
<P>The river Euphrates has been drying up, and the way has been preparing, for near a century past, for the utter ruin of the Pope and the hierarchy of the church of Rome, and the time of the utter overthrow of antichrist appears to be hastening on. But this is not accompanied with any reformation in that church, or in the Greek church, or in the protestant churches in general: But very much to the contrary appears. Ignorance, error and delusion, and open vice and wickedness abound, and are increasing; and infidelity is rapidly spreading in the christian world. The unclean spirits, like frogs, appear to have gone forth to all the kings' courts, and the great men in Christendom; and the greatest corruption and abominable vices are spread among them, and real christianity is neglected, run down and opposed. And the multitude in general, both learned and unlearned, are going the same way. Deism, and a multitude of errors which lead to it, and even to atheism, are increasing. A spirit of irreligion, selfish∣ness, pride and worldliness, is exceeding strong and prevalent, pro∣ducing
<PB N="146" REF="025635_0145_0FCE9E51EEC58A90"/>all kinds of wickedness, and a strong and general opposi∣tion to true religion, and the great truths and doctrines of the gos∣pel. And the healthen world are no more disposed to become christians, than they ever were: And the way to their conversion to christianity appears to be more obstructed; and the few at∣tempts that are made to christianize any of them, are generally unsuccessful. And Mahometans and Jews hate and oppose christianity as much as ever they did, if not more, and are sinking farther down in stupidity, ignorance, infidelity, worldliness, and all kinds of vice.</P>
<P>It is certain, that most of the evil things now mentioned, have been found among the body of mankind, in a greater or less degree, in all ages; and the pious friends of God, and true religion, have complained of, and lamented them. And it is probable, that the representation now made, will be considered by many, only as the revival of the old complaint, by those who are of an illiberal, gloomy cast of mind, and wholly without foundation, in truth and fact. But this opinion, though it should be generally im∣bibed, and asserted with great confidence, will not be any evidence that the representation is not true and just; but will rather serve to confirm it. For it is commonly, if not always, the case, that in times of great degeneracy, and the prevalence of ignorance, error and vice, they who are the greatest instances of it, and most sunk into darkness and delusion, are deluded in this also, and entertain a good opinion of themselves, and of others who join with them, being ignorant of their true character. They put darkness for light, and light for darkness, and call evil good, and good evil. And while real christianity and true virtue, founded upon principles of truth and genuine piety, are abandoned, opposed and forsaken, they perceive it not, but think all is well, and much better than before. And they may undertake to <HI>reform christianity,</HI> and think it is greatly reformed, when every doctrine and duty is excluded from it, which is contrary to the selfishness, pride, and worldly spirit of man, and little or nothing is left of it, but the mere name, to distinguish it from the religion of infidels or hea∣then; and nothing to render it preferable to these.</P>
<P>An appeal must be made, in this case, from the judgment of those of this character, to those who are born of the Spirit of God; are created in Christ Jesus unto good works; by which they are become new creatures, and turned from the darkness of this world,
<PB N="147" REF="025635_0146_0FCEACF705D3F950"/>to marvellous light: Who are not conformed to this world, but have overcome it, and are transformed by the renewing of their minds, so as to know and distinguish what is that good and ac∣ceptable and perfect will of God, which is revealed in the scrip∣tures. They who are thus spiritual, judge of all things respecting the doctrines and duties of christianity, in some good measure, according to the truth. To such, especially those of them who have a general knowledge of the state of religion in the christian world, and of the deluge of ignorance, error and vice with which it is overflowed, it is presumed, the above description will not ap∣pear exaggerated, and that there are greater strides, and swifter progress made in infidelity, and irreligion, error and false religon, in vice and all kinds of wickedness, than have been ever known before; and that all these are more common, have a wider spread, and are carried to a higher degree at this time, than in former ages; and threaten to bear down all truth, and real christianity before them: And that the appearance of things, in this respect, is just such as might be reasonably expected when the unclean spirits like frogs, the spirits of devils, are gone forth with a license and design to spread their influence among men, and deceive and corrupt the whole world.</P>
<P>There is reason to conclude, from what has already taken place of this kind, and from the prophecy of these unclean spirits, that they have not yet finished their work; but that the world, espe∣cially that part of it called christian and protestant, will yet make greater and more rapid advances, in all kinds of moral corruption, and open wickedness, till it will come to that state in which it will be fully ripe, and prepared to be cut down by the fickle of divine justice and wrath: And it may take near half a century from this time for these evil spirits to complete their work, and gather the world to this battle. But during this time, whether it be longer or shorter, and before the battle shall come on, there will probably be great and remarkable judgments, and fore, unusual and sur∣prising calamities, in one place and another, suited to awaken and warn mankind, and lead them to fear God, repent and re∣form; which being by most disregarded and abused, will become the occasion of greater hardness of heart and obstinacy, which will be a prelude and provocation to the battle of that great day, in which mankind will be destroyed in the manner, and to the degree, which has been described above. This battle, as has been before
<PB N="148" REF="025635_0147_0FCEACF884D61150"/>observed, will not be fought and finished at once; but by a series of different and increasing calamities and sore punishments, man∣kind will be reduced and brought down, and every high thing levelled to the ground, in which the hand of God will be remark∣ably visible, and his arm of power and vengeance made bare.— And it may take more than a century to effect all this, in the wisest and best manner; so that it will not be finished till near the beginning of the seventh millenary of the world.</P>
<P>It has been observed, that while antichrist is coming down, and the way preparing for the utter extinction of the church of Rome, and all her appendages, the world in general, and especially the christian world, will make swift advances in delusion and all kinds of wickedness; and infidelity will make great progress, under the influence of the spirits of devils, which are gone forth to the whole world. And it may be here observed, that the increase and spread∣ing of this wickedness, and spirit of infidelity, will doubtless be the means or weakening and preparing the way for the overthrow of that church. The ten horns, or kings, which shall hate the whore, and make her desolate and naked, and eat her flesh, and burn her with fire, will do this from a selfish, worldly spirit, and under the influence of infidelity, and opposition to all kinds of religion. And the prevalence of deism and atheism in popish countries and nations, which are the natural fruit and offspring of the abomina∣ble practices and tyranny of the antichristian church, has been the means of exposing the superstition and wickedness of that church, and weakening the papal hierarchy. And deists, and other wicked men, may be made the instruments of pulling down that anti∣christian fabrick yet farther; as the heathen Romans were of destroying the corrupt church of Israel. If so, the fall of the Pope will be so far from implying a revival of true religion; that it may be attended with the contrary, viz. infidelity, immorality, and all kinds of wickedness, as the means of it, so far as it will be effected by the instrumentality of men.</P>
<P>WHEN John is describing the vision under the sixth vial, of the unclean spirits like frogs, going forth to the whole world to gather them to the battle, he stops before he has finished the relation, and Jesus Christ himself speaks the following words: "Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his gar∣ments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xvi. 15.</NOTE> By which
<PB N="149" REF="025635_0148_0FCEACFB1CC697A8"/>he warns those in particular, who shall live when this vial is pour∣ed out, of their danger of being seduced by those evil spirits, and those who are corrupted by them, and behaving unworthy of their christian character; and sets before them the strongest motives to deter them from apostacy, and induce them to be faithful to him, to <HI>watch and keep their garments:</HI> To continue spirituaily awake, and properly attentive to all those things which concern them as christians; to their situation and state, their own exercises and conduct, to the cause of Christ, and the enemies with whom they are surrounded; to maintain their christian profession, and act a∣greeable to it, in the exercise of all christian graces; trusting in the great Captain and General, who only can save them, and his church; and waiting for him with a patient continuance in well doing. <HI>He comes as a thief.</HI> The thief does not make his pre∣sence and designs known to any but those who are joined with him, being his friends, and engaged in the same design with him. So, though Christ be present with his church and people, and is in the midst of his enemies, having all men and devils in his hands; and ordering and conducting every thing that is done by them, in this time of the greatest degeneracy, and high handed wickedness; and knows how to answer his own ends by it and them, and to protect his people, and bring the wheel over his enemies; yet, in this his coming and presence, he is not seen or thought of by the corrupt, wicked world: They think nothing of his presence, and see not his hand: He is seen only by his friends, who are engaged in the same cause with him, who watch and keep their garments. They see his hand in all those things, behold him present, and doing his own work; and are protected from all evil by him, while the wicked fall into mischief, and are destroying themselves. And when he comes forth to the battle, and rises up to the prey, and to punish the world for their wickedness, the wicked will not see him, they will not know their danger, or believe he is come, or will come, till evil falls upon them, and it is too late to escape. "For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden de∣struction cometh upon them; and they shall not escape."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thess. v. 3.</NOTE> And they only are safe, who watch and keep their garments, and see and ado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e his hand and presence, in all his works of terror and wrath. "Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with
<PB N="150" REF="025635_0149_0FCEACFC39237100"/>trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him."

<P>It is of the greatest importance to christians, who live at this day, and those who shall live in the time when the battle shall come on, that they should attend, and discern the signs of the times, and watch and keep their garments; as this is the only way to be safe and happy. Our Lord gave the same direction and com∣mand, as to substance, when he was on earth, with reference to these same events: "Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them who dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all those things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke xxi. 34, 35, 36.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT will probably be suggested, that the representation of such a dark scene, and evil time, to take place before the Millennium will come, is master of great discouragement, and tends to damp the spirits and hopes of christians, and to discourage them from at∣tempting to promote it, or praying for it; especially as it is set so far off from our day: So that none in this or the next generation are like to see it.</P>
<P>To such suggestions it is easy to reply,</P>
<P N="1">1. If it be true, and clearly and abundantly foretold, that such evils are to take place, before the prosperous state of the church comes on, it is proper and desirable that all should know it, and at∣tend to it, and it cannot be of any disadvantage to any, to know the truth in this case, but the contrary. This is revealed to the church for the instruction and benefit of christians, that they may be informed and warned of what is coming, and be prepared for it, and not he disappointed in their expectations, and surprised when it shall take place; but when they see these things coming to pass, their faith may be strengthened, and they lift up their heads and rejoice, knowing that the redemption, the deliverance and pros∣perity of the church draweth near.</P>
<P N="2">2. These evils, both natural and moral, however undesirable and dreadful, in themselves, are necessary for the greatest good of
<PB N="151" REF="025635_0150_0FCEACFDD71EDE78"/>the church of Christ, and to introduce the Millennium in the best manner, and there will be then, and forever, more holiness, joy and happiness, than if these evils had never taken place. In this view, they are kind and merciful dispensations to the church. The Apostles and Prophets, and all the inhabitants of heaven, are represented as rejoicing in the evils, the punishment and destruc∣tion of the enemies of Christ and his church.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xviii. 20. xix. 1—6.</NOTE> The affliction and servitude of the children of Israel in Egypt, and the wickedness, oppression and cruelty exercised towards them by Pharaoh and the Egyptians; and the successive calamities and punishments brought on them by the hand of God, and their final overthrow and de∣struction in the Red Sea, were an unspeakable advantage to the former, and afforded matter of joy and praise. Therefore, chris∣tians may now not only acquiesce, but even rejoice in these events, as ordered by God for wise ends, and necessary, in order to the greatest display of his righteousness and goodness, and to promote the best good and greatest happiness of his church.</P>
<P N="3">3. God revealed to Abraham the evils which were coming on his posterity in Egypt, previous to their deliverance and prosperity, and the wickedness and punishment of the Egyptians; not to dis∣courage him, and fink his spirit, but to support and animate him, and strengthen his faith; and this did not damp his joy; but in the view of the whole, he rejoiced. And Jesus Christ foretold to his disciples the great evils which were coming on them, upon the Jews, the church and the world, not to discourage and deject them, but that they might be forewarned, and expect them, so as not to be disappointed when they came, but have their faith confirmed, and possess their souls in patience when the dark scene should come on; and that they might be encouraged and rejoice, consider∣ing these events as tokens that their deliverance was at hand. He therefore said unto them, "And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemp∣tion draweth nigh."
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke xxi. 28.</NOTE> This may be applied to christians now. While you see the world gathering to the battle of the great day of God Almighty, and view this battle near at hand, lift up your heads and rejoice, that the church has got so near the end of dark∣ness and affliction; and that the happy day of her deliverance and prosperity is so near at hand.</P>

4. As to the distance of that happy day of salvation from this time; two hundred years, or near so many, will pass off before it will arrive, according to the calculation which has been made from scripture; so that none, now on the stage of life, will live to see and enjoy it on earth. But much may be done by christians who live in this age, to promote its coming on in the proper time, by prayer, and promoting the interest of religion, and the conversion of sinners: For that good day would not come, unless the cause of Christ be maintained to that time, and sinners be converted to keep up the church, and prevent the total extinction of it. In order to this, thousands must be converted, and there must be a succession of professing and real christians down to that day. The doctrines, institutions, and duties of christianity, must be main∣tained; and there will doubtless be remarkable revivals of religion in many places, and knowledge will increase among true christians, and there will be advances made in the purity of doctrines and worship, and all holy practice, by bringing all these nearer to the standard of the holy scriptures: And the churches will be formed into a greater union with each other; being more and more con∣formed to the divine pattern, contained in the Bible. Here then is work enough to do, by those who desire and are looking for such a day, to prepare the way for it, and it may be introduced in the proper time; and there is no want of encouragement to do it, even in this view, to be stedfast and unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as they may know, that their labour will not be in vain in the Lord.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 58.</NOTE></P>
<P>And christians may now have a great degree of enjoyment of that day, and joy in it, though they do not expect to live on earth till it shall come. True christians are disinterested and benevo∣lent to such a degree, that they can enjoy and rejoice in the good of others, even those who may live many ages hence, and in the good and prosperity of the church, and the advancement of the cause and kingdom of Christ in this world, though they should not live to see it. The stronger their faith is, that this good day is coming, and the clearer and more constant view they have of it, and the more desirable it appears to them, that there should be such a time; the higher enjoyment, and greater joy they will have in it, and in the prospect of it. Thus Abraham looked forward by his faith, and saw this day of Christ, when all the nations of the
<PB N="153" REF="025635_0152_0FCEAD018FBFD470"/>earth should be blessed in him, and derived great comfort and joy in this prospect. "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6.</NOTE> Christians know that it will come on in the best time, as soon as it can be introduced by infinite wisdom and goodness: That there is no delay, but "God will hasten it in his time." In this sense, Christ will come <HI>quickly</HI> to set up his kingdom in the whole world. He is on his way, coming as fast and as soon as he can, consistent with infinite wisdom. He is preparing the way, and ordering every thing in the best manner, so as in the most proper time, to reign with his church on earth; and no time is lost. And what christian can desire that it should be sooner, or before this time? Is it not enough that Jesus Christ has undertaken it, and will bring it on in the best manner, and the fittest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ne? And must not this give joy to every real christian?</P>
<P>It is farther to be observed, that though the christians who live at this day, will not see the Millennium come while they are in the body on earth; yet they will see and enjoy it, when it shall come, in a much higher degree than they could do, were they living on earth; or than those who will live on earth at that day. The powers, knowledge and views of the spirits of the just made perfect, are greatly enlarged in heaven, and they have a more clear and comprehensive view of the works of God, and a more particu∣lar knowledge of what is done in this world, especially of what relates to the work of redemption, the salvation of sinners, and the prosperity of the church and cause of Christ. There is joy in the presence of the angels over <HI>one sinner</HI> that repenteth. The spirits of the just made perfect are with the angels, and must know all that passes in their presence; and must rejoice in such an event, as much or more than they. How great must be their joy then, when whole nations, yea, all the world, become true penitents, and they see and know this, and what is implied in it, unspeaka∣bly to better advantage, and more clearly, than any can do who shall be then on earth!</P>
<P>The more christians labour and suffer on earth, in the cause of Christ; and the more they desire, pray for, and promote his com∣ing and kingdom in this world, the more they will enjoy it in heaven, when it shall take place, and the greater will be their joy
<PB N="154" REF="025635_0153_0FCEAD030DB166D0"/>and happiness. And it will be unspeakably more and greater in heaven, than if they were in bodies on earth. Who then can reasonably desire to live in this world, merely to see and enjoy the happy day of the Millennium.</P>
<P>ON the whole, it is hoped that it does appear from what has been said in this dissertation, that there will be a thousand years of prosperity of the church of Christ, in this world; that this is abundantly foretold and held up to view in the Bible; that this will be about the seventh millenary of the world; that it will be a most happy and glorious day, in which the christian dispensation shall have its proper and full effect on earth, in the salvation of men; to which all the preceding times and events are preparatory: That the degeneracy and increasing prevalence of ignorance, error and wickedness now in the world, especially in Christendom, is preparing for, and hastening on the battle of that great day of God Almighty, in which mankind will be punished, and the great∣est part then on earth destroyed; and then the Millennium will be introduced:—That this is an important and pleasing subject, suited to support and comfort christians in all the dark and evil days which precede it, and to excite them to earnest, constant, united prayer for this coming of Christ, and patient waiting for him, and to constant exertions in all proper ways, to promote his interest and kingdom in the world.</P>
<P>AFTER the thousand years of the reign of Christ and his church on earth, "Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: The number of whom is as the sand of the sea. And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: And fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xx. 7, 8, 9.</NOTE> In these words there is refer∣ence to what is said of Gog and Magog, in the thirty eighth and thirty ninth chapters of Ezekiel: Which prophecy, there is reason to think, is not to be understood literally, but in a figurative sense; as no events have ever taken place answerable to this representa∣tion, if taken in a literal sense. The prophecy of Gog and Magog,
<PB N="155" REF="025635_0154_0FCEAD0478C93758"/>may be considered as having reference to two events, which are to take place at different times, and are similar in some respects, and differ in others, viz. The great and general corruption and wickedness of mankind, and their punishment and destruction which will precede the Millennium, which has been described in this section; and the apostacy and wickedness of mankind at the end of the Millennium, and the remarkable overthrow and destruc∣tion of them, when Christ shall come to judgment; predicted in the words which have been now transcribed. Some things said of Gog and Magog, of their designs, doings, and their punish∣ment, and a number of expressions in that prophecy, are more applicable to the former of these events than to the latter, and some more applicable to the latter than to the former, and the whole cannot be well applied to one, exclusive of the other; but in both, the prophecy is completely fulfilled. Both these events respect wicked men, who have arrived to a great degree of obstina∣cy and wickedness; and they are both gathered together by the agency and deception of satan, let loose for that end. And they are both gathered together to battle against Christ and his church; and are destroyed in the battle.</P>
<P>This prophecy is figurative. It is not to be supposed that all this great multitude will be gathered together into one place; or that the church will be encamped together in one spot on earth, or collected in one city: But the gathering of the wicked, means their being abandoned to infidelity, and a very great degree of wickedness, in opposition to the church of Christ, and true religion, and being disposed to extirpate these from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>te of the earth. In this sense, the wicked will be gathered together to battle, before the Millennium, by the spirits of devils, or satan, who will go forth to the whole world for that end, as has been explained. The church will become small, and surrounded and assaulted by the wicked on every side, and ready to be swallowed up, and totally destroyed by them.</P>
<P>It has been a question, from whence this multitude of peopl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> here called Gog and Magog, should come, after the church <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ and true religion had prevailed in the world a thousand years? Some have supposed, that a number of people, and per∣haps whole nations, would live in some corner of the earth, during
<PB N="156" REF="025635_0155_0FCEAD068E12EBA8"/>the time of the Millennium, without partaking of any of the bless∣ings of it; but will continue in a state of heathenism and wicked∣ness all that time, till at length they will multiply so much, as to be able to rise in opposition to the church, and destroy it, were they not prevented by the miraculous interposition of heaven. And many have supposed, that this fact is inconsistent with all the inhabitants of the world being real christians, and eminently holy in the time of the Millennium. But this supposed difficulty may be easily solved; and the general and great apost<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> accounted for, consistent with the supposition, that in the Millennium all man∣kind will be real christians. Near the end of the thousand years, the divine influences, which produced and continued the universal and eminent holiness in the Millennium, may be in such a meas∣ure withheld, as that real christians will, in their exercises and conduct, fink much below what had taken place before, and in∣dulge a careless and worldly spirit to a great and sinful degree, and become more and more negligent of their duty, especially with re∣spect to their children; and be really guilty of breaking covenant with God, in this important point. In consequence of this, their children will not be regenerated and converted; but grow up in a state of sin, real enemies to God and to the truth. And as the world will be then full of people, it will in this way soon become full of wicked men, and the church will be very small. And those who will grow up under the power of sin and satan, in the face of all that light, truth and holiness, which had taken place through the Mil∣lennium, and in opposition to it, will naturally arrive to a great and amazing degree of hardness and obstinacy in sin, and become a far more guilty and perverse generation of men, than ever existed before; and will be greater enemies to truth and righteousness, and the church of Christ. And consequently will be united and engaged to banish all these from the earth. The world will have more wicked persons in it than ever before; and all these much more sinful, and engaged in all kinds and ways of opposition to Christ and his cause and people. The church will be on the brink of ruin, just ready to sink and be swallowed up; and the appearance and coming of Christ will be less believed, expected or thought of, than at any other time. Then Christ will be re∣vealed from heaven in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them who know not God, and obey not the gospel.</P>

This apostacy and great wickedness of so many millions of mankind, the number of whom will be as the sand of the sea, and their consequent misery, is an awful dispensation indeed, and is, in itself, an evil infinitely beyond the comprehension of man. But there is the clearest evidence, and the greatest certainty, that this instance of evil, as well as all other evil which precedes it, and will succeed it, though it will be endless, will, by the overruling hand of God, be productive of overbalancing good; and is neces∣sary, in order to effect the greatest possible good to the universe. "<HI>Surely</HI> the wrath of man shall praise thee: The remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm lxxvi. 10.</NOTE> This event will serve to set the total depravity, and the strong propensity of man to the greatest degree of wickedness, in a more clear and striking light than it had been, or perhaps could be before. That man should apostatize, and so soon arrive to such a high degree of wickedness, after all the light and holiness, and the wonderful goodness of God to man, displayed in the Millennium; and, in opposition to all this light and grace, and in the greatest abuse of it, join in rebellion against God, and trample on his authority, truth and goodness, contrary to the ad∣monitions and warnings from the word of God, and all faithful ministers and christians; will make a new discovery, and greater than was ever made before, of fallen human nature, and of the great and desperate evil that is in the heart of man; and that it is utterly incurable by any means that can possibly be used, short of the almighty energy of the Spirit of God, by which the heart is renewed; and consequently of the guilt and infinite ill desert of man; which discovery will be of great advantage to the church and kingdom of Christ forever, and necessary for the greatest hap∣piness and glory of it, and the highest honour of the Redeemer.</P>
<P>And this will make, from fact, a new and greater discovery of the absolute dependence of man on the grace and Spirit of God, to prevent his greatest wickedness and endless destruction, and to form him to holiness and happiness; and of the great and sover∣eign grace of God, in converting and saving lost man, and in bringing on such a wonderful degree of holiness and happiness, and continuing it a thousand years; and that this is all to be as∣cribed to the sovereign power and grace of God, who has mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.
<PB N="158" REF="025635_0157_0FCEAD08F9C8B598"/>When all men shall be righteous and holy from generation to generation for a thousand years, and all the children which shall be born in that time, shall appear to be pious and holy as soon as they begin to act, and persevere in this to the end of life, the ap∣pearance will be, that mankind are now grown better, and that the evil nature of man is not so great; but he is naturally in∣clined to obedience and holiness: The sudden and great apostacy which will take place, will take off this appearance; and show, that the heart of man is naturally as full of evil as ever it was; and that all the good and holiness of the Millennium state, was the effect of the power of the Spirit of God, and to be wholly ascribed to the infinite, sovereign grace of God. And this discovery will be remembered by the redeemed forever, and improved to the glory of God, to the praise of rich, sovereign grace, and conse∣quently to their own eternal advantage.</P>
