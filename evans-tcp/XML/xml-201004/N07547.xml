<P>How mony did you kill in the Gaol!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>We kilt them aw, men women and weans.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you count them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>No faith! I staid in the Street, for Fear of them De'ils, the Highlandmen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were not you frechtened to facht so mony Indians?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed were we: But we did not let them fecht Us. We kilt them at the Mannor just as they getting out of their Beds in the Morning: And the Gued Folks of <HI>Lancaster</HI> had taken away aw the Guns, Tomhawks, and long Knives, from them, that were in the Goal.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>But did you think it recht, <HI>Tom,</HI> to kill the Women and the Weans?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some of us did not, as soon as auld Saunders Kent that (you know he has been an Elder this thirty Year) when he gaid about Duty, the Night before, he sung the 137 <HI>Psalm,</HI> where it says, <Q>happy surely shall he be, they tender little ones, who shall lay hold upon, and them shall dash against the Stones.</Q> And he read the 15. <HI>Chapter</HI> of 1 <HI>Samuel.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you did all this in the Name of the Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, to be sure. We were aw <HI>Pres∣byterians.</HI> But that wild Chiel, <HI>Charly Breulluchan</HI> shot an Indian's Doug, while auld <HI>Saunder's</HI> was saying Grace till half a Pint of Whusky. I doubt he has the Pope, or the Heegh-Kirk in his Guts.</P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid all this is wrong. I am a <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> you know, as well as yourself. But I would fain hope that I am a Christian also. Jesus Christ is the Prince of <HI>Peace,</HI> and has taught us the Doctrine of forgiving even our Enemies, as we expect that our heaven∣ly Father will forgive us. I am afraid that you have done amiss. Many Things were permitted to the Jews because of the Hard∣ness of their Hearts, which the Light of the Gospel has discovered to be wrong. But even the Jews paid the greatest Regard to their Treaties. And these Indians by Treaties have been acknowledged to be our Friends.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gibeonites</HI> were spared on Account of the publick Faith plighted to them, tho obtained by Fraud and Falshood. And tho <HI>Schechem</HI> had committed a Crime for which he ought to have suffered Death: Yet after Peace was made, we find the good old Patriarch <HI>Jacob,</HI> on his Death-Bed, bit∣terly cursing his Sons, for breaking the Peace. Instruments of Cruelty are in your Habitations. O my Soul come not thou into your Secrets, unto your Assembly, mind
<PB N="7" REF="009634_0006_0F77386B2229D980"/>Honour, be not thou united: For in your Anger you have slain Man, and in yourself will you houghed Cattle. Cursed be your Anger, for it was fierce; and your Wrath for it was cruel. I pray that you may not be dispersed or scattered in the true <HI>Israel</HI> of GOD.</P>
