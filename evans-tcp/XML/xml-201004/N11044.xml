<HEAD>THE CRISIS. NUMBER XXVIII.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="proclamation">
<BYLINE>By his Excellency THOMAS SHAW, PROTECTOR and DEFENDER of MAGNA CHARTA, and the BILL of RIGHTS.</BYLINE>
<HEAD><HI>A</HI> PROCLAMATION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS the infatuated multitudes of royal Neronian dependants, catamites, pimps, and parasites, too many to be enumerated; have long conducted them∣selves as parricides and traitors in a fatal progression of crimes against the constitutional liberties of the British empire, and have at length proceeded to avowed and open rebellion against the laws of the land, and the lives of Englishmen in England and America, and the good effects which were expected to arise from the patience and lenity of the people, have been often frustrated, and remonstrance proved ineffectual and now rendered hopeless, from the obstinacy and cruelty of the sovereign, by the in∣fluence of their infernal counsels, and confederacy, it only remains for the people, who have the su∣preme power, as well for the punishment of those guilty parricides, as for the protection of the inno∣cent, to prove they do not bear the sword in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="013994_0002_0F92592CA0AAB390"/>
The infringements which have been committed upon the sacred rights of Magna Charta, and the people of Great-Britain and America, are too many to enumerate on one fide, and all too attrocious, too infamous, and too diabolical to be palliated on the other. All unprejudiced, unpensioned, and un∣placed Englishmen, who have been witness, (or even heard) of the late transactions, in this kingdom and America, will find, upon a transient review, marks of premeditation and conspiracy to destroy the constitution of the British empire, that would justify the fullness of chastisement; and even those who are least acquainted with facts, cannot fail to receive a just impression of the enormity, in pro∣portion as they discover the arts and assiduity, by which their bloody designs have been falsified and concealed. Those parricides, the authors of the present bloody measures and unnatural revolt from the laws, never daring to trust their cause, or their actions, to the judgment of an impartial public, or even to the dispassionate reflection of their followers and adherents, have uniformly placed their chief confidence in the suppression of truth; and while indefatigable and shameless pains have been taken to destroy the real interest of the people of England and America, the grossest forgeries, calumnies, and absurdities, that ever insulted human understanding, have been imposed upon their credulity, by the King, and those miscreants. The Press, that di∣stinguished appendage of public liberty, and when fairly and impartially employed, its best support, has been invariably prostituted by those pensioned rascals, Hume, Johnson, Kelly, Shebbeare, and other ministerial hirelings, to the most contrary
<PB N="231" REF="013994_0003_0F92592D40A632E0"/>purposes. The animated language of ancient and viriuous times, calculated to vindicate and promote the just rights and interests of mankind, have been applied by the King's minions, to countenance the most abandoned violations of those sacred blessings and not only from the flagitious ministerial prints, but from the slavish harangues of prostituted Peers, and venal Senetors, men have been taught to de∣pend upon activity in shedding of blood, for the security of their places, pensions, and persons, till to complete the horrid profanation of terms and of ideas, the name of God has been introduced in addresses and in the pulpit, by a groupe of rotten Popish Bishops, to excite devastation and massacre.</P>
<P>The minds of men, such as Gage, Percy, Bur∣goyne, Clinton, and Howe, and the King's mer∣cenary soldiers, having been thus gradually prepa∣red for murder, a number of armed troops to the amount of eighteen hundred, and upwards, on the 19th of April last, at Concord, cowardly attacked about sixty peaceable Americans, who not expect∣ing so consumate an act of savage barbarity, unpre∣pared for vengeance, and willing to decline it, made use of their arms only in their own defence. Since that period, the mercenaries, deriving confi∣dence from impunity, have added insult to outrage; have repeatedly fired upon, and barbarously killed many of their fellow subjects with cannon and small arms; and with a preposterous parade of military arrangement, they try to frighten, and mean if pos∣sible to enslave America, while part, of their body make daily and indiscriminate invasions upon private property, and with a wantonness of cruelty, peculiar in this reign, and ever incident to lawless power,
<PB N="232" REF="013994_0004_0F92593137F55528"/>carry depradation and distress where ever they turn their steps. The action of the 19th of April, and the cruel, bloody, and inhuman circumstances at∣tending that day's carnage, are of such notoriety, as must baffle all attempts to contradict them; and the flames of buildings, the cries of helpless infirm old men, women and children, wantonly slaughter'd in cold blood, spread, and will for ever stand a me∣lancholy confirmation of the subsequent assertions.</P>
<P>In this exigency of Neronian cruelty and com∣plicated calamities I avail myself of the last efforts within the bounds of my duty, as a peaceable sub∣ject, to spare the effusion of blood; to offer, and I do hereby, in the name of the whole people of England and America, offer and promise a most gracious pardon, to all the mercenaries who shall forthwith lay down their arms, and return to the duties of peaceable subjects and faithful Englishmen, loyal to the laws and the constitution, excepting only from such pardon, John Stuart, Earl of Bute, and William Lord Mansfield, the authors and pro∣moters of bloodshed and cruelty, whose crimes are of too flagitious a nature to admit of any other consideration than that of condign punishment.</P>
<P>And to the end that no person within the limits of this proferred mercy may plead ignorance of the consequences of refusing it, I by these presents pro∣claim not only the persons above named and ex∣cepted, but also their adherents, associates, and abettors, meaning to comprehend in those terms, all and every person and persons, of what class, de∣nomination, or description soever, who have ap∣peared in arms against the sacred laws and consti∣tution of the British empire, and shall not lay down
<PB N="233" REF="013994_0005_0F925932A801DDF8"/>the same as aforesaid; and likewise all such as shall so take up arms after the date hereof, or who shall in any wise protect or conceal such offenders, or assist them with money, provisions, cattle, arms, am∣munition, carriages, or any other necessiry for sub∣sistence or defence, or shall hold secret correspon∣dence with the mercenary murderers, by letter, message, signal, or otherwise, to be rebels and trai∣tors to the British coustitution, and as such to be treated.</P>
<P>And whereas, during the continuance of the pre∣sent bloody and unnatural civil war in America, jus∣tice cannot be obtained by the common law of the land, the course whereof has for a long time past been violently impeded, and wholly interrupted by the King and his paracidial minions and military cut throats, from whence results a necessity, in or∣der to preserve the dear bought rights of English∣men and hallowed constitution of the empire, for using and exercising the Lex Talionis or Law of Retaliation; I have therefore thought fit by the authority invested in me by Magna Charta as a Freeman, to publish, and I do hereby publish, pro∣claim, and order the use and exercise of the Lex Talionis, or Blood for Blood, within and through∣out Great-Britain and America, so long as the pre∣sent unhappy occasion shall necessarily require, till the sons of freedom shall gain a decisive victory over tyranny and lawless power, till each parricide and traitor shall be brought to the block or the gal∣lows, or otherwise fall a sacrifice by the hands of a much injured and enraged people, and till the li∣berties of England and America are settled upon a sure and lasting foundation, not to be again shaken
<PB N="234" REF="013994_0006_0F92593341380300"/>by any tyrant of the house of Brunswick; where∣of all true Englishmen are hereby required to take notice, and arm themselves—with a resolution as well to maintain their rights, as to resist, encounter and subdue the mercenaries and traitors above described.</P>
<P>To these inevitable, but I trust salutary measures, it is of a far more pleasing part of my duty to add the assurances of protection and support to all who in so trying a Crisis shall manifest no allegiance to tyrants, but an affection for the sacred constitution of their country; So that such persons as may have been induced to join in the present royal and mini∣sterial measures for destroying the laws, liberties, and lives of their fellow-subjects in America, may return to their respective callings and professions, be no longer the instruments of murder and public ruin, but stand distinct and separate from the par∣ricides of the constitution, till God in his mercy shall turn the hearts of tyrants, and restore peace to this distracted land, now polluted with innocent blood.</P>

<P><HI>Notwithstanding the Royal lying Gazette has given us an account, signed by that bloody monster in human shape, Gen. Gage, of another massacre in America, on the</HI> 17th <HI>of June last, wherein this modern Kirk exto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s his officers and mer∣cenary soldiers, stimulated by liquor, and promises of plunder,
<PB N="235" REF="013994_0007_0F925934089FE6A8"/>to slaughter their fellow subjects, for their valour and bra∣very, and boasts his having gained something like a victory, over the brave and virtuous Americans, fighting for liberty, whom that wretch calls rebels; yet the Public may depend this pretended superiority of his troops, conduct of his offi∣cers, and mighty victory is a LYE; and it will soon be proved, from unquestionable authority, that he has lost some hundreds of his men, more than is mentioned in the Gazette, which contains the most notorious falshoods, and infamous impositions on the Public, calculated to deceive the people here, and to spirit up the few remaining troops we have in England, to embark with the greater readiness to the field of slaughter in America, there to fall a just sacrifice to the injured laws, and glorious liberties of the Brtish empire: It will likewise appear that Gen. Gage's army with all the advantage of artillery, and the assistance of several ships of war, and armed vessels, was obliged to retreat to their barracks and sneaking holes in Boston, under the protection of the men of war.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If it was ever necessary to rouse the sleeping genius of England, to excite a generous emulation of our warlike fore∣fathers and to animate every Briton, by their example, to fight valiantly, to conquer nobly, or perish gloriously in de∣fence of his country—This is certainly the time.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If it was ever necessary for the people of England to rise altogether as one man and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a torrent on the bloody tyrannical invaders of their lives and liberties, and over∣whelm them in the midst of their fancied insolent security—it is surely at this time.</HI></P>
<P>If it was ever necessary for the people to enter into an association, to express and fully explain in a Manifesto the causes of their discontent; and to declare they take up arms to put a stop to the en∣croachments of those who govern in the King's name; to bring to condign punishment the betray∣ers of their country; to preserve their rights and li∣berties from farther violations; to restore the laws
<PB N="236" REF="013994_0008_0F925934CC6E7EC0"/>and the constitution now tottering to its base, to their pristine vigour; to prevent the inhuman slaughter of their fellow subjects in America by the hand of lawless power; to enforce a due obedience to Magna Charta from the King and his ministers; to oblige his Majesty to dismiss those parricides and traitors who surround his throne, and to restore the ancient independence and freedom of parliaments: If such a measure was ever necessary to preserve the people and kingdom from slavery and ruin.—it is NOW. But alas! It is (I fear) in vain to appeal to the reason or to the passions of Englishmen, they seem to have lost their very nature and genius, they seem to have forgot the arts of war, and the blessings of freedom; they have fatally degenerated into luxury and vice, and at last become insensible to every generous sentiment of public liberty; they have lost the virtue, the courage, and bravery of their glorious ancestors; and are now looked upon by surrounding nations, as a herd of pusillanimous drones, devoted to slavery, or doomed to destruction.</P>
