<HEAD>THE CRISIS. NUMBER XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">CASCA's Epistle to Lord Mansfield.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Uni aequres Virtuti atque ejus amicis</L>
<L>To <HI>Virtue</HI> only just and <HI>Virtue's Friends.</HI></L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LG>
<L>CAN you, my Lord, who serve despotic ends,</L>
<L>Can you be "just to virtue and her friends?"</L>
<L>To wanton murderers when did she afford</L>
<L>Protection yet, or alter a record?</L>
<L>Say, does your callous soul receive no shock,</L>
<L>When, conscious, in the hall, you view the clock?</L>
<L>Or can you fill profidious Scroges's place,</L>
<L>Without a pressage of your own disgrace?</L>
<L>Yes—Yes, to England's shame you're out of reach,</L>
<L>And laugh at him who threatens to impeach.</L>
<L>If Burke should rise, the farce no further goes;</L>
<L>To one just aye, North brings ten impious no's.</L>
<L>In youth, before dissembling was your trade,</L>
<L>To James libations on your knees you made:</L>
<L>Not loyalty, but fear has sheath'd your sting;</L>
<L>No Murray can be faithful to his King.</L>
<L><PB N="138" REF="013983_0002_0F92598C84E937A8"/>
From the black North in famish'd clans you swarm,</L>
<L>And thawing, feel how Albion's sun can warm;</L>
<L>Your clime you change, your sentiments retain;</L>
<L>In Scotchmen treason is an innate stain;</L>
<L>Like itch and scurvy in their blood it reigns;</L>
<L>He who would cure it must exhaust their veins.</L>
<L>Once against rebels, 'twas your place to plead,</L>
<L>Your mouth condemn'd, your soul approv'd the deed.</L>
<L>Whilst round your heart sad disappointment hung,</L>
<L>Dissimulation oil'd your treach'rous tongue.</L>
<L>A Murray then (your brother too) was found</L>
<L>In arms, in secret trust, in duty bound,</L>
<L>And principle (like yours) to aid a claim,</L>
<L>Which you affected with a blush to name;</L>
<L>A blush ill-acted;—to thy ghostly pale,</L>
<L>(Index of guilt) soft nature lends no veil.</L>
<L>No—we my lord disdains to serve ends;</L>
<L>She's "only just to virtue and her friends."</L>
<L>On them she smiles, on Chatham's cheek she glows,</L>
<L>When injur's children are assail'd like foes;</L>
<L>When famine's call'd to aid the coward plan,</L>
<L>And North compleats what Bute and you began.</L>
<L>Perish your names! your Thane in fear is fled,</L>
<L>With ev'ry curse but Scotland's on his head:</L>
<L>In shade, but not (alas!) in death enshrin'd,</L>
<L>Whilst you, his faithful proxy speaks his mind;</L>
<L>And (to weak George from soothing flatt'ry dear)</L>
<L>Pour your Laird's poison in the royal ear.</L>
<L>Why do your treach'rous actions shun the light?</L>
<L>Why do back-stairs feel Mansfield's steps at night?</L>
<L>To George your councils and yourself convey,</L>
<L>Fraught with infection, in the face of day.</L>
<L><PB N="139" REF="013983_0003_0F92598D42E2E058"/>
Let not the royal closet's whisper screen,</L>
<L>Your glorious works; but let your light be seen.</L>
<L>Conduct, avow, enforce your patriot plans,</L>
<L>Nor trust their merits to subaltern clans.</L>
<L>Tho' Bure absconds, yet aid your joint design,</L>
<L>Yourself, my Lord; and help to spring the mine.</L>
<L>Whilst Grafton, Sandwich, Denbig, North stand forth,</L>
<L>And to astonish'd ears proclaim their worth;</L>
<L>Whilst, with rank nonsense, Suffolk, Pomfret, dare,</L>
<L>Without a blush, to make Plebeians stare;</L>
<L>Why, when your sov'reign's pleas'd by law to kill,</L>
<L>Step not you forth to gild the desp'rate pill?</L>
<L>'Tis decent, sure, so pension'd, plac'd and brib'd,</L>
<L>To recommend the dose you have prescrib'd,</L>
<L>But fear, my lord, mean, abject fear, still gives</L>
<L>A check—in you a lurking traitor lives;</L>
<L>The worst of traitors—you have sense to see</L>
<L>Fair Freedom's charms, yet blast the soul that's free.</L>
<L>Early and late, incessant in your pains,</L>
<L>For brave America you forge vile chains.</L>
<L>Yet meanly, in your house or court take root,</L>
<L>When you should speak as deputy to Bute.</L>
<L>He still lies hid; perhaps at Clapham lurks,</L>
<L>Whilst you and Apsley carry on the works.</L>
<L>To grant a nation's claim each house is loth,</L>
<L>But you have representatives in both.</L>
<L>Strangely absurd!—yet this we know and see;</L>
<L>This truth subdu'd your modest member Leigh.</L>
<L>The man had sense, and felt his own disgrace,</L>
<L>How well an Aston wou'd supply his place!</L>
<L>So represented, with such leaders too,</L>
<L>(North—George—obsequious to your Lordship's Cue.)</L>
<L><PB N="140" REF="013983_0004_0F92598E408A4288"/>
This war against ourselves will soon be won,</L>
<L>Odious America be soon undone.</L>
<L>Remonstrances are vain, Bute won't relax,</L>
<L>But sternly bids North lay another tax.</L>
<L>The tax of death, by bayonet and ball;</L>
<L>But famine is the hardest tax of all.</L>
<L>From Scotland, could that thought derive its source?</L>
<L>Where is sharp famine felt with greater force?</L>
<L>In all the horrors there the fiend's array'd;</L>
<L>There her shrunk hand for ever chills the blade.</L>
<L>There with lank sides, the meagre cattle moan;</L>
<L>Their keeper asks for bread and gets a stone.</L>
<L>From this distress yourself and Bute soon fled,</L>
<L>Yet pour it's plagues upon a nation's head.</L>
<L>By vilest means, my Lord, you seek vile ends;</L>
<L>Thus are you "just to virtue and her friends."</L>
<L>In all your strokes a master's hand appears:</L>
<L>Stand forth, claim all your praise, and banish fears.</L>
<L>If conscience dictates every ill you do,</L>
<L>Frankly expose the knave you hide, to view.</L>
<L>Plebeians scorn—to gain your King'-applause,</L>
<L>Like base De Burgo, fawn and rest the laws.</L>
<L>Despise what faithful history shall say;</L>
<L>Full in your Zenith now, enjoy your day;</L>
<L>Tho' in times annals your foul name shou'd rust,</L>
<L>Whilst Fame to Hoit's erects a lasting bust.</L>
<L>He had no Smythe; no bias he had shown,</L>
<L>But dragg'd assassins from behind the throne.</L>
<L>Guardian of England's laws he gave 'em sway,</L>
<L>And held them forth for sovereign's to obey.</L>
<L>Against the people's rights he took no part,</L>
<L>But judg'd, and counsell'd with an honest heart.</L>
<L>Prerogative (unpension'd and unbrib'd)</L>
<L>He kept within the bounds that law prescrib'd,</L>
<L><PB N="141" REF="013983_0005_0F92598ECB038CB0"/>
By freedom's side he firmly took his stand,</L>
<L>Yet held the balance with an equal hand.</L>
<L>Of that fair plant he cherish'd ev'ry shoot,</L>
<L>And, with a parent's fondness nurs'd the root.</L>
<L>His name, whilst law endures, shall live in praise;</L>
<L>Asby and White, no Mansfield can erase.</L>
<L>But you, my Lord, to infamy still true,</L>
<L>Indulge your King's caprice in all you do.</L>
<L>If citizens their humble plaints express,</L>
<L>You bid him spurn the May'r, and his address.</L>
<L>With pleasantry your sov'reign's heat asswage,</L>
<L>And arm him for the horned cattle's rage.</L>
<L>Instruct him how to speak, to sneer and frown,</L>
<L>To try if tricks will bear a city down:</L>
<L>To be astonish'd that one voice shou'd sue</L>
<L>To turn a tyrant from his bloody-view.</L>
<L>Death is the word—let loose the dogs of prey;</L>
<L>Burgoyne's the man, my lord; encrease his pay.</L>
<L>Your heart's well known; your voice attention draws</L>
<L>Arise and vindicate your master's cause.</L>
<L>In art supreme, in perfidy not weak,</L>
<L>Show bashful Lordlings what it is to speak.</L>
<L>Let not such fools as Suffolk, when they rise,</L>
<L>Without a word of English, snatch the prize.</L>
<L>Shall Peers, whose infamy is scarce half-blown,</L>
<L>Vaunt Mansfield's schemes, as if they were his own;</L>
<L>In language, which no grammar e'er equipp'd,</L>
<L>Language, for which a school-boy wou'd be whip'd?</L>
<L>No.—Be yourself, my Lord, and unconfin'd,</L>
<L>Assert your right of ruining mankind.</L>
<L>Break forth in all your Ciceronian blaze,</L>
<L>And let your front no more than heart amaze.</L>
<L>Equal in private and in public shine,</L>
<L>And dare to be another Cataline.</L>
<L><PB N="142" REF="013983_0006_0F92598F8AB28A68"/>
Shou'd galling Junius make a new attack,</L>
<L>(Whose lashes still are flagrant on your back,)</L>
<L>The libeller by some state blood-hound trace,</L>
<L>And let him feel the terrors of your place.</L>
<L>Grafton in friendship some sure snare will lay,</L>
<L>As friend, and spy, he'll join him and betray.</L>
<L>If precedent injustice can anoint,</L>
<L>John Wilkes's case; will be a case in point.</L>
<L>Then, make the senate ring; like Pomfret rave;</L>
<L>And scorn by pension'd proxies to enslave.</L>
<L>"Pomfret!—there's weight in what such heads advise;</L>
<L>"Madmen in council are to me a prize.</L>
<L>"Since Smith is dead, Pomfret may be endured:</L>
<L>"We loose a vote, shou'd the poor man be cur'd.</L>
<L>"Besides, he speaks—in sentiments unites,</L>
<L>"He sometimes raves and stares, but never bites."</L>
<L>"Granted, my Lord"—but yet (unknown to yield,</L>
<L>As your troops are) why don't you take the field</L>
<L>In person? Clear suspicions, doubts dispell:</L>
<L>No Lord contrives, abetts, or speaks so well.</L>
<L>Does virtuous Camden talk your spirit down,</L>
<L>Or Chatham awe you with a Roman frown?</L>
<L>When patriot Rockingham, or Richmond rise,</L>
<L>Does Freedom's ray annoy your dazzled eyes?</L>
<L>Does Shelburne's boldness shake your dastard soul?</L>
<L>Or Temple's perseverance want controul?</L>
<L>Can you, with forces so well paid, and fed,</L>
<L>Despond, unless your thane is at your head?</L>
<L>Can you, his staunch lieutenant colonel, fail</L>
<L>In senate, as in council, to prevail?</L>
<L>Or is your courage check'd in it's career,</L>
<L>Because you've lost five thousand pounds a year?</L>
<L><PB N="143" REF="013983_0007_0F92599042FAC970"/>
Long in commission you had kept the seals;</L>
<L>Three Judges moving on your Lordship's wheels:</L>
<L>Their mouths pronounc'd, but your's prescrib'd the law;</L>
<L>Thus have we kings and judges too, of straw.</L>
<L>If ten such learn'd triumvirates as that,</L>
<L>With all their law will scarce make half a Pratt;</L>
<L>Who can behold (and not with rage be stirr'd)</L>
<L>A Praetor sliver'd from the weakest third?</L>
<L>This thought of yours my lord, your pow'r ensures,</L>
<L>The weaker the man is, the more he's yours.</L>
<L>In council, court, and parliament we see</L>
<L>Your faithful shadow moves as you decree;</L>
<L>Witness the cause of Thickness against Leigh.</L>
<L>This project shows your Machiavelian skill,</L>
<L>You're speaker thus (and more than speaker) still.</L>
<L>Profoundly politic in all you do,</L>
<L>Thus are you chancellor and speaker too.</L>
<L>Yet, when you can foresee an hard fought day,</L>
<L>Like Falstaff, from your post you sneak away.</L>
<L>The risque your rag-o-muffin bands may share:</L>
<L>You (like your thane) make self your dearest care.</L>
<L>Boldly you counsel underneath the rose;</L>
<L>But fly the conflict when the armies close.</L>
<L>A war of reason gives your lordship pain:</L>
<L>Virtue alone such conflicts can sustain.</L>
<L>Too free, too pure, to serve oppression's end,</L>
<L>She can't mistake a Mansfield for a friend.</L>
<L>Some few hard fronts can stand the shock of steel,</L>
<L>But none the thunder of the public weal.</L>
<L>Ev'n Jove himself, great Jove, can't bear reproach.</L>
<L>Nor pass without a pannic in his coach,</L>
<L>When to North's smuggled parliament he rides,</L>
<L>The God betraying what the Stoic hides.</L>
<L><PB N="144" REF="013983_0008_0F925990FB7592A8"/>
Fain would he smile—shrill hoots his muscles check,</L>
<L>Then how he wishes England had one neck!</L>
<L>At ev'ry hiss he feels a conscious start,</L>
<L>And groans re-echo'd pierce his tyrant-heart;</L>
<L>A heart, in infancy too soon ensur'd:</L>
<L>To slight those ills his people have endur'd;</L>
<L>Harden'd by female insolence and pride;</L>
<L>To Bute entrusted as it's only guide,</L>
<L>A guide to what? not to the people's love,</L>
<L>(The safest ground on which a King can move)</L>
<L>Nor to the path of honour, truth, or fame,</L>
<L>In which our Edwards won a glorious name;</L>
<L>Not, with discernment, to enforce the laws,</L>
<L>Or yield to subjects in a righteous cause;</L>
<L>To aid the just, to sooth the giddy throng,</L>
<L>And wisely to distinguish right from wrong;</L>
<L>To temper justice with an even hand,</L>
<L>And drive corruption from a sinking land;</L>
<L>But train'd (alas!) to act the meanest part,</L>
<L>To speak a language foreign to his heart.</L>
<L>To promise more than Britons ever heard,</L>
<L>Trusting to have his sacred lies rever'd;</L>
<L>To set his honour and his soul to sale,</L>
<L>As water false, as courtly sunshine frail;</L>
<L>In theory well school'd; in practice taught</L>
<L>To be the sad reverse of what he ought.</L>
<L>Honour and faith in falshood's stream he laves,</L>
<L>And toils to make a freeborn people slaves.</L>
<L>Not so our great Deliverer sought renown,</L>
<L>He knew from whom, and why he had the crown.</L>
<L>But now, the globe and scepter's held for show,</L>
<L>Bute, says that craft is all a king should know;</L>
<L>Quotes bright examples from each Stuart's reign;</L>
<L>To such a scholar not one hint's in vain.</L>
<L><PB N="145" REF="013983_0009_0F925991C588BF80"/>
A just petition's answer'd with a sneer;</L>
<L>And to secure his point he drops a tear.</L>
<L>Unhappy York! too fickle to resist!</L>
<L>Alas! thy death encreas'd the tyrants list!</L>
<L>Not to be won by all that sense could try,</L>
<L>You fell by water from the weakest eye!</L>
<L>If hypocrites and murd'rers, who shall dare</L>
<L>To excuse that guilt, which bare-fac'd thanks declare</L>
<L>When harmless lives were lost, and Rome was burn'd,</L>
<L>Nero, in form his grateful thanks return'd,</L>
<L>Happy to have a cool, obedient Scot</L>
<L>Perform his bloody orders to a jot;</L>
<L>Happy to find two more so bravely warm'd,</L>
<L>So hot for blood, to stab one youth unarm'd.</L>
<L>O! when in British annals shall this blot,</L>
<L>Of sanguinary power be forgot!</L>
<L>Never whilst brave America can feel</L>
<L>The sense of wrongs, or the redress of steel:</L>
<L>Never whilst liberty and right divine,</L>
<L>Mark the vile Stuart from the Brunswick line</L>
<L>Behold! what Bute's long-labour'd culture brings,</L>
<L>A King of patches! and a shame to Kings!</L>
<L>A baby! who is honour'd till he thinks</L>
<L>That water sacred, which a monarch drinks.</L>
<L>Taught that the height of piety's to kneel,</L>
<L>He says his pray'rs, and bids the vulgar feel.</L>
<L>Let meaner souls relent, forgive, forget;</L>
<L>Such weakness ne'er disgrac'd a Stuart yet.</L>
<L>No—let the slave that thwarts us be undone,</L>
<L>Long live the mother in the tyrant son!</L>
<L>Thus lectures Bute,—and this advice embrac'd;</L>
<L>All sense of virtue in the bud's effac'd,</L>
<L><PB N="146" REF="013983_0010_0F92599283D1F378"/>
How should kings see in infancy made blind?</L>
<L>Whose manhood's watch'd, whose knowledge is confin'd?</L>
<L>To whom no page in history's revealed,</L>
<L>But were they find the subject's cause appeal'd</L>
<L>To heav'n?—this tame redress Carte's volumes teach</L>
<L>These George may read—these Bute and Mansfield preach.</L>
<L>True to his trust, the Thane his task begun,</L>
<L>He pleased the mother, and he dup'd the son.</L>
<L>Taught him to fly above the legal sphere,</L>
<L>And by sad Charles's star his course to steer;</L>
<L>To bear no counsel, no sage hint, no guide,</L>
<L>But think all subjects born for kings to ride;</L>
<L>By famine brave resistance to entomb,</L>
<L>And (with Macbeth) to "leap the life to come,"</L>
<L>To wait no tide, attend no rising gale,</L>
<L>But rashly spread prerogative's full sail;</L>
<L>To heed no subject in his bold careers,</L>
<L>But passive pensioners and rotten peers.</L>
<L>To spare no life, if poignant fatyr strikes;</L>
<L>To plan the death of him he most dislikes;</L>
<L>Waiting impatient for the setting sun,</L>
<L>To hear good news from Martin and from Dun.</L>
<L>To give in jest a coronation pledge,</L>
<L>Nor think an oath more sacred than a wedge.</L>
<L>Alas! that off'ring shou'd suggest a thought,</L>
<L>That charity by former kings was wrought;</L>
<L>That, from the royal cradle to the grave,</L>
<L>The truest piety's to guard and save.</L>
<L>Such acts as these to crown a lustre lend;</L>
<L>This, Mansfield, this is being "Virtue's friend."</L>
<L>But, when destruction is a king's command,</L>
<L>And death gains passports from the royal hand;</L>
<L><PB N="147" REF="013983_0011_0F9259933A3B2678"/>
When carnage is the word—when gen'rous Gage,</L>
<L>Dreads that his name shou'd blot the historic page,</L>
<L>And, with a tenderness his Prince will blame,</L>
<L>Shrink from rank murder and eternal shame;</L>
<L>When conscience and remorse from court is flown,</L>
<L>Nor dare solicit a despotic throne;</L>
<L>All must be slaves till spirit shall return,</L>
<L>To fire those bosoms where it us'd to burn;</L>
<L>'Till we consider names far less than things,</L>
<L>Nor care from what sound stem we take our Kings,</L>
<L>Till scepter'd pride is taught to bless the hand</L>
<L>That calls her to protect a gen'rous land;</L>
<L>Is taught that British monarchs owe their state,</L>
<L>To those who can depose them or create;</L>
<L>Provok'd, insult'd, spurn'd, can spare, or try;</L>
<L>Or throw with scorn their royal creature by.</L>
<L>Bute! Mansfield! these are doctrines which appear,</L>
<L>Horrid and harsh to your distemper'd ear;</L>
<L>But there will come a time when you shall rue</L>
<L>That e'er you counsel'd with a heart untrue:</L>
<L>When from those counsels deadly fueds shall rise</L>
<L>To force a tear unfeign'd from George's eyes.</L>
<L>Truth ev'n on Kings in that sad hour attends:</L>
<L>Charles found, at last, his people were his friends;</L>
<L>To notions, false as friends, he bid adieu;</L>
<L>These had deceiv'd; the block spoke plain but true.</L>
<L>Ne'er may a Brunswick taste such bitter fruit,</L>
<L>But leave the axe to Mansfield, North, and Bute.</L>
<L>These lines inspired by Churchill's laurel'd shade,</L>
<L>I write, unknown, unpatronized, unpaid:</L>
<L>Proud of my honest muse, by chance has cropp'd</L>
<L>One slow'r from that fair wreath which Churchill dropp'd.</L>
<L><PB N="148" REF="013983_0012_0F92599747677260"/>
Let Johnson toil for hire, with falsehoods please;</L>
<L>(North's fiat feeds, and dubbs him with degrees.)</L>
<L>His be the shame, the gen'rous transport mine,</L>
<L>To goad a villain's heart at ev'ry line.</L>
<L>Disdaining pidlers, who for flowrets roam,</L>
<L>Like Brutus rough, I'll plant the dagger home.</L>
<L>Tyrants and traitors Casca ne'er forgives:</L>
<L>Tremble fuch monsters whilst that Casca lives.</L>
<L>The blast he blows their guilty souls shall shock,</L>
<L>And drive them to perdition and the block.</L>
