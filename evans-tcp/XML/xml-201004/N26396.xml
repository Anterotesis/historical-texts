<HEAD>American Independence.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been observed by an elegant wri∣ter, that <Q>as an individual unconnected with the government, can only reason upon their measures from what is publickly known, such an one may possibly contribute to weaken the effect of their authority by an attempt to sup∣port it upon ground which they would dis∣claim. A good cause is often injured by an unskilful defence, and an unsuccessful effort always lessons the facility of a practicable ope∣ration.</Q> With a conviction of the truth of these remarks strong on my mind, it is not with∣out considerable reluctance, that I undertake to state certain reasons and facts, to prove the po∣licy and expediency of the late appointment of an embassy to France. But as the subject is before the public, and is interesting in an high degree to every American, what is now offered, cannot be deemed impertinent, and may be use∣ful.</P>
<P>That any favourable opinion in the President of the United States, respecting the French rev∣olution, or the present government of France, dictated the nomination, no one in his senses can suppose. His many invaluable writings, his speeches to Congress, his answers to numerous addresses, all his measures, and all his conduct, forbid the momentary admission of such an idea. That a man of his deep political knowledge,
<PB N="4" REF="035103_0005_1000A686024A2A98"/>proved devotion to his country, incorruptible integrity, decided aversion to innovation and all the wild doctrines of modern philosophy; of so thorough a knowledge of the wickedness of the French rulers, could be taken in by any de∣lusive appearances, could be lulled by any pro∣fessions of their sincerity, is not, humanly speak∣ing, within the line of possibilities.</P>
<P>But a little experience of this world and its ways, is sufficient to convince us, how seldom the still voice of reason is heeded in the heat of political dissention. The most important servi∣ces are forgotten, the most exalted talents are depreciated, and one single difference of opin∣ion outweighs a life of virtue, patriotism and use fulness.</P>
<P>These reflections naturally arise out of the subject, but are not the defence on which I depend. It can I think be clearly shewn, with∣out any reference to the confidence due to the President, and independent of all personal con∣siderations, that <HI>the measure</HI> is entitled to our warmest approbation, as calculated to counter∣act the hostile designs of France, and promote the best interests of the United States.</P>
<P>It was not to be expected, that the French would set down easy and contented, under the disappointment and disgrace which the failure and developement of their attempts on our in∣dependence, peace and honour had brought up∣on them. We had every thing to fear from their intrigue, the lust of power, mortified pride, and ungratified avarice.</P>
<P>The mission of Logan has ceased to agitate the public mind; but those who think it too ri∣diculous
<PB N="5" REF="035103_0006_1000A69EB2DBE5C0"/>to be worthy of notice, will some time or other be convinced of their mistake.</P>
<P>That he was the agent of the French party in the United States, to the Directory, is beyond a doubt; and it is equally certain that the future operations of the Directory were determined by his communications.</P>
<P><HI>The plan,</HI> I think, will be clearly made to ap∣pear by what is herein disclosed; to be, <HI>For the Directory, previous to the adjournment of Congress, to request a renewal of the negociation at Paris, and to give the assurances required by the President, in rather an indirect manner, with the view that he should not consider them satisfactory, and decline a∣nother embassy. Then, immediately upon the disso∣lution of Congress to send an Envoy Extraordinary to Philadelphia, to tell the story of our Government's re∣jecting the advances of France, and to solicit a hear∣ing on all subjects of dispute.</HI></P>
<P>It may be asked, how was this known at the time of the nomination? I answer—a much less degree of penetration than is attributed to the Executive of the United States, must have foreseen that France would croud us with offers, assurances, and embassies. How to meet these was then the question. To refuse to treat, and afterwards be forced into it, would have been a most unfortunate circumstance. It would have destroyed the work of at least ten years; it would have taken away the well earned pop∣ularity of the American Government, and re∣stored French influence, with all its attendant horrors. Every body must allow that <HI>for us, Paris is the best place to treat in.</HI> It may be urg∣ed that as France had refufed to receive our
<PB N="6" REF="035103_0007_1000A68E4498ECF8"/>ministers, we could refuse to receive her minis∣ter. But this is reckoning without the host— We <HI>might</HI> have <HI>taken</HI> this ground but we never could have <HI>kept</HI> it. The rights of embassy are well understood, and France having disregard∣ed them, would be no apology for our doing the same. It is a <HI>general maxim</HI> of the law of nations, that, <Q>we are not to refuse admitting and hearing even an enemy's minister. The greater the calamities of war are, the more is it incumbent on nations to preserve means for putting an end to it.</Q></P>
<P>It may be insisted on, that the present gov∣ernment of France is an <HI>usurpation.</HI> The fact is readily admitted; but it must not be forgot∣ten that the <HI>usurpers</HI> have been long since ac∣knowledged <HI>sovereigns</HI> by the United States, and by every nation that has had any thing to do with them. Every objection on this score against the present embassy, applies with equal force, against Mr. Morris's continuing at Paris after the dethronement of the King, against the reception of Mr Genet, against the appointment of Mr. Monroe, against the reception of Messrs. Fauchet and Adet, and against the appointment of General Pinckney, and of the three Envoys Extraordinary, Messrs. Pinckney, Marshall and Gerry. But, such an objection has no validi∣ty. On the question, "Whether ministers may be received "from or sent to an usurper" VAT∣TEL lays it down, that <Q>foreign powers, if the advantage of their affairs invites them to it, follow possession: there is no rule more cer∣tain, or more agreeable to the law of nations, and the independency of them. As foreign∣ers
<PB N="7" REF="035103_0008_1000A6E9B855F388"/>have no right to interfere in the domestic concerns of a people, they are not obliged to canvas and inspect its oeconomy in those particulars, or to weigh either the justice or injustice of them. They may if they think proper, suppose the right to be annexed to the possession. When a nation has expelled its so∣vereign, the other powers which are not wil∣ling to declare against it, and would not draw on themselves its arms or its enmity, consider that nation as a free and sovereign state, with∣out taking on themselves to determine wheth∣er it has acted justly in withdrawing from the allegiance of subjects and dethroning the Prince. Cardinal Mazarine received Lock∣hart, who had been sent as ambassador from the republic of England, and would neither see King Charles the IId, nor his ministers. If a nation, after driving out its Prince, sub∣mits to another, or changes the order of suc∣cession, and acknowledges a sovereign to the prejudice of the natural and appointed heir; foreign powers may here likewise consider what has been done, as legal; it is no quarrel or business of theirs. At the beginning of the last century, Charles, duke of Suderma∣nia, having obtained the crown of Sweden, to the prejudice of Sigismund king of Poland, his nephew was soon acknowledged by most sovereigns. <HI>Villeroy,</HI> minister of Henry the IVth, king of France, at that court, in a me∣moir of the 8th of April 1608, plainly said to the President Jeannin, <HI>All these reasons and considerations shall not hinder the king from treat∣ing
<PB N="8" REF="035103_0009_1000B7DC8721B2E8"/>with Charles, if he finds it to be his interest, and that of his kingdom.</HI></Q></P>
<Q><P>This was arguing sensibly. The King of France was neither the judge nor the guar∣dian of the Swedish nation, that he should, against the good of his own kingdom, refuse to acknowledge the king which Sweden had chosen under pretence that a competitor termed Charles an usurper. Had it even been done with justice, it does not come un∣der the cognizance of foreigners.</P>
<P><HI>Therefore, when foreign powers have received the ministers of an usurper, and sent theirs to him, the lawful prince, on recovering his throne, cannot complain of these measures as an injury,</HI> nor justly make them the cause of a war, provided these powers have not gone farther, nor furnished any succours against him.</P></Q>
<P>I have been the more particular in giving this extract at length, because the question which it considers, though frequently alluded to, has never been fully discussed, in any of our political writings, that I have seen.</P>
<P>Let us suppose a French envoy arrived in this country. He is told, that our repeated embassies have been spurned with indignity, and without a hearing from the threshold of the Directorial palace, and therefore a Minis∣ter from the Directory could not be received.</P>
<P>The envoy replies, <HI>[the more lies the better for his purpose]</HI><Q>I am come to explain, and make atonement for that very thing; you surely cannot refuse to receive reparation for inju∣ries or insults." And perhaps he might add, the men who refused your ministers were
<PB N="9" REF="035103_0010_1000B7DE223D2AD0"/>traitors, enemies to France as well as Ameri∣ca; Merlin, and Treillard, and Rewbell, and Lepaux, and Talleyrand are taken up as con∣spirators, and are succeeded by the true pa∣triots, the friends of both countries, who have sent me to heal all differences, and re∣dress all your wrongs.</Q> Even setting aside, the law of nations and the right of embassy, those who think our government could have withstood all this, are desired to recollect <HI>town∣meetings</HI> and <HI>treaty remostrances,</HI> and if they are still inflexible, nothing which I can say will affect their opinions.</P>
<P>I have now before me a pamphlet which though I often before heard of, I never was a∣ble to obtain till within a few days. It is a handsome Paris edition. Several copies of it, directed to different characters in this country, arrived here about the middle of last summer. Some little was said respecting it at first, but the work has been kept from the public eye. The reason is obvious. It being predicated upon the idea that the President would make no nomination, it could not answer the purpo∣ses of the French government, or their friends the American jacobins. But few federalists, it is presumed, were possessed of a copy, and those it is probable, were themselves so well con∣vinced of the <HI>protriety</HI> of the nomination, that they did not think there was any necessity for the promulgation of information, which would place it in a more conspicuous light. It con∣tains three letters, the first entitled <HI>Joel Bar∣low to his fellow citizens of the United States,</HI> da∣ted
<PB N="10" REF="035103_0011_1000B7DFEDC9D8F8"/>Paris, March 4, 1799. The second <HI>Joel Barlow to General Washington,</HI> dated Paris, Oct 2, 1798, with a note prefixed at the time of publication. The third <HI>Fulwar Skipwith and Joel Barlow to a Member of the Executive Direc∣tory.</HI> The book appears to have been written by the express order of the Directory, with a view of accellerating their plan of getting a new minister at Philadelphia, <HI>under circumstan∣ces unfavourable to the United States.</HI></P>
<P>I shall quote and comment on such parts of the work as will unfold the desing.</P>
<P>Barlow professes a great deal of frankness, and is willing to allow many of the faults of the French government; a degree of candour, which any who are acquainted with <HI>their sys∣tem of justice and police,</HI> know would be rather too dangerous an experiment, if they had not some special purposes to answer by suffering it. The Directory having heard by Citizen Logan and others, what was consirmed by our war∣like preparations, that the spirit of this country was at length roused by injuries upon injuries, and insults upon insults; were convinced, that it would not do for. Citizen Barlow, or any o∣ther Citizen, to tell us that France had done us no wrong. This accounts for the following expressions in the first letter— <Q>How much you have unfortunately suffered from the pira∣cies carried on under the French laws" p. 4. the attempts which had been made here to extort from our commissioners a bribe to in∣dividuals, and a promise of a loan to the go∣vernment</Q> p. 5. <Q>No man in America could feel a greater indignation that I did at the
<PB N="11" REF="035103_0012_1000A69447BFE300"/>piece of villainy therein detailed</Q> (in the dis∣patches) ibi. <Q>I had no knowledge that even a <HI>loan</HI> was asked for, or contemplated to be asked for on the part of France. It was my opinion that it was the policy of the Ameri∣can government under circumstances then existing to <HI>offer</HI> a loan</Q> ibi. That monstrous system <Q>of piracy and plunder exercised to∣wards neutrals</Q>—<Q>all the horrors that have attended this tremendous revolution</Q> p. 6. <Q>The innumerable acts of injustice and vio∣lence committed under the order of the 2d of March 1797, and the law of the 18th of January 1798</Q> p. 7. <Q>The flood of piracy and plunder let loose upon your property; a scene of wickedness which no man can abo∣minate more than myself</Q> p. 36.</P>
<P>These expressions used by a man in the pow∣er of the French government, would be suffi∣cient evidence, if any was wanted, that the book was penned by their direction. But the char∣acter of Barlow, and his connection with, and dependence on that government, are so well known to all political men in the United States, that to <HI>them</HI> the proof must be unnecessary.</P>
<P>In the letter addressed to General Washing∣ton is the following passage, with the accompa∣nying note, added as before mentioned, when the book was published. The letter it seems was first sent as a private one. <Q>An embargo that had been laid on American vessels with∣in the republic in consequence of a report that war had been begun on the part of the United States, was taken off as soon as it was ascertained that such war had not been be∣gun;
<PB N="12" REF="035103_0013_1000B7E19B79DBF8"/>and a new declaration was at that time sent to America of the wishes of France to treat. 1</Q></P>
<P>NOTE. 1. <Q>Since writing this letter, I am at liberty to state that the <HI>new declaration,</HI> here referred to, was dispatched from Paris through an official channel about the end of Septem∣ber last. It should seem that it had not ar∣rived at Philadelphia, before the opening of Congress in December; as the President's speech alludes to a declaration made to Mr. Gerry in July, but takes no notiee of this sub∣sequent one, which was perfectly explicit and unconditional.</Q> The letter adds, <Q>these facts will doubtless come to your knowledge through other channels before you receive this letter.</Q></P>
<P>Thus it appears that the Directory had taken measures to spread in this country the news of their offer, upon the presumption that it would not be accepted, and that this circumstance would assist their intended mission to Philadel∣phia. And it is said that duplicates of the prof∣ferred assurances were read in jacobin meetings in Pennsylvania, previous to the nomination, and that the <HI>worthy</HI> members of these meetings only waited for Congress to break up, in order to blaze them abroad.</P>
<P>But France wanted a <HI>salvo,</HI> and this was rea∣dily furnished by the prostituted Skip with and Barlow. The following is taken from their letter to a Member of the Executive Directory; the date it will be recollected was the 12th of February 1799. <Q>The enlightened policy which has ever animated your conduct to∣wards
<PB N="13" REF="035103_0014_1000B7E471F72B10" MS="y"/>the United States, and particularly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> kind reception you gave that estimable patriot Doctor Logan, which has been followed by the most happy effects, induce us to address you some reflections on the intelligence lately re∣ceived from that country. We shall take the liberty of exposing to you our opinion rela∣tive to the best mode of silencing the ene∣mies of France in America, extending and invigorating republican principles" &amp;c. &amp;c. The Congress must rise on or before the 4th of March, (20 days from this) as the bienni∣al functions of all the House of Representa∣tives, and one third of the Senate, cease on that day. Should the President therefore be disposed to name a minister, he cannot do it after that day, without calling a special meet∣ing of the senate; which delay would neces∣sarily throw that operation into the summer; and such minister could not arrive in Paris till next autumn or winter.</Q></P>
<P><Q>France, seated on the car of victory, is surrounded with too much glory, to fear that an act of condescention should be misinter∣preted, or ascribed to any other cause than her own magnanimity. You would abridge the sufferings of your colonies, revive the manufactures, commerce and agriculture of many parts of France, give a new triumph to republican principles, and make a better treaty than could be made under other cir∣cumstances, if you would send a minister im∣mediately to Philadelphia." "If we dared to give a suggestion on an object still more delicate, we would hazard our opinion rela∣tive
<PB N="14" REF="035103_0015_1000A698D4F2F9E0"/>to the qualities of the person whom you may charge with this mission to Philadelphia. We should invite you to choose a citizen whose name and character are known and respected in America; who by his writings may have merited the esteem of the two countries; a citizen, if possible, who may have some ac∣quaintance with our excellent philosopher and patriot, Jefferson; and whose known moderation, integrity and wisdom shall at the same time prevent his being disagreeable to the oposite party; a citizen whose enlighten∣ed love of liberty, in its most extensive effects, shall render him proper for a negotiation which may become the source of the most ex∣tensive prosperity.</Q></P>
<P>After reading this, can any one hesitate as to the expediency of the late nomination? Con∣gress were just about dissolving without declar∣ing war, notwithstanding the losses and the buf∣fetings we had suffered and endured. The same constitution which gives Congress the <HI>"power to declare war"</HI> gives the President the <Q>pow∣er by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the senators present concur;</Q> to <Q>nomi∣nate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint ambassadors and other public ministers,</Q> and <HI>makes it his duty</HI> to <HI>"re∣ceive</HI> ambassadors and other public ministers. The President was to be left nine months the subject, (I was going to say the sport) of French diplomatic skill. <Q>A citizen whose name and character are known, and respected in A∣merica</Q> was designated, to allure us. The
<PB N="15" REF="035103_0016_1000B7E5F784F3A0"/><HI>tyger</HI> was in fact <HI>crouching to leap upon his prey,</HI> but our vigilant Executive discovered his <Q>mur∣derous fangs peeping through the downy vel∣vet of his paws,</Q> and checked the hideous monster at the outset.</P>
<P>That great statesman whose writings still il∣lumine the world which his immortal part has lately left, declares in his celebrated <Q>Reflec∣tions on the French Revolution</Q> that he <Q>would preserve consistency, by varying his means to secure the unity of his end.</Q> He who has the affairs of a nation to direct, must know to accomplish this, or he will be illy fit for the trust. The feelings and passions which operate in the common intercourse of mankind, ought to be discarded when the fate of our country is at issue. Keppel, one of the most judicious, brave and experienced officers that the naval history of Britain can boast, being en∣trusted with the command of the channel fleet in 1778 was accused of having been guilty of misconduct on the 27th of July of that year. Unjustly attacked in the house of Commons, by those who neither knew his difficulties nor resources, he calmly replied, <HI>I considered, on that day, that I had England in my hands.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps if the tide of success had continued on the side of France, many who now complain of the nomination, would have applauded it. But I contend, that the change of fortune among the belligerent powers is an argument in favour of the policy of the measure. We shall be more likely to obtain justice from France, while she is going down hill and contending against su∣perior power, than we should be, were she
<PB N="16" REF="035103_0017_1000B7E7810D5920"/>seated on the car of victory," The differen∣ces betwevn the two nations, must some time or other be settled; and while nothing is done, contrary to our engagements to other nations, <HI>our Government</HI> is alone the judge when to ne∣gotiate, or attempt to negotiate. Advantage ought to be taken, of every conjuncture, which can possibly turn out to our benefit.</P>
<P>If there are any, who wish to hear only one side of the question; such may say, <Q>as the envoys are gone on their mission, why this tedious essay?</Q> To these it is replied, that the objections to the mission have gone forth to the world, and are circulated in Europe as well as America. And if any misunderstanding, should arise in consequence of this mission, be∣tween us and any other powers, <HI>some</HI> of the A∣merican objectors will have the merit of hav∣ing anticipated it, just in the same degree that the jacobins, have that, of fortelling, French re∣sentment, and depredations in consequence of the British treaty.</P>
<P>But we are not to consult the pleasure of any foreign nation, in our negotiations with ano∣ther —the moment we do, we relinquish our in∣dependence. <HI>National friendship?</HI> is alas! to be found only in the imaginations, of revolu∣tionary fanatics. <HI>Interest,</HI> is the spring of all national intercourse. America has paid too dearly for this lesson, so soon to give it up.</P>
