</LIST>
<P N="1">I. 1. We may, in the first place, observe a few particulars of his life and death. He was born at <HI>Gloucester,</HI> in <HI>December,</HI> 1714, and put to a Gram∣mar-school there, when about twelve years old. When he was seventeen he began to be seriously reli∣gious, and served GOD to the best of his knowledge. A∣bout eighteen he removed to the University, and was admitted at <HI>Pembroke</HI>-college in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and about a year after, he became acquainted with the <HI>Me∣thodists</HI> (so called) whom from that time he loved as his own soul.</P>
<P N="2">2. By them he was convinced, That we <HI>must be born again,</HI> or outward religion will profit us no∣thing. He joined with them in fasting on <HI>Wednes∣days</HI> and <HI>Fridays,</HI> in visiting the sick and the priso∣ners, and in gathering up the very fragments of time, that no moment might be lost; and he chang∣ed the course of his studies, reading chiefly such books as entered into the heart of Religion, and led directly to an experimental knowledge of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and him crucified.</P>
<P N="3">3. He was soon tried as with fire. Not only his
<PB N="5" REF="012280_0003_0F8A8A268B5CB4E8"/>reputation was lost, and some of his best friends for∣sook him, but he had many inward trials. Many nights he lay sleepless upon his bed; many days pro∣strate on the ground. But after he had groaned se∣veral months under the <HI>spirit of bondage,</HI> GOD was pleased to remove the heavy load, by giving him <HI>the spirit of adoption,</HI> enabling him, through a liv∣ing faith, to lay hold on <HI>the Son of his love.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. However, it was thought needful, for the re∣covery of his health, which was much impaired, that he should go into the country. He accordingly went to <HI>Gloucester,</HI> where GOD enabled him to a∣waken several young persons. These soon formed themselves into a little society, and were some of the first fruits of his labour. Shortly after he began to read twice or thrice a week to some poor people in the town, and every day to read and to pray with the prisoners in the county goal.</P>
<P N="5">5. Being now about twenty-one years of age, he was solicited to enter into holy Orders. Of this he was greatly afraid, being deeply sensible of his own insufficiency. But the Bishop himself sending for him, and telling him, <Q>Tho' I had purposed to ordain none under three and twenty, yet I will ordain <HI>you</HI> whenever you come;</Q> and several o∣ther providental circumstances concurring, he sub∣mitted, and was ordained on <HI>Trinity-Sunday,</HI> 1736. The next <HI>Sunday</HI> he preached to a crowded audito∣ry, in the church wherein he was baptized. The week following he returned to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and took his Bachelor's degree. And he was now fully omploy∣ed, the care of the prisoners and the poor, lying chiefly on him.</P>
<P N="6">6. But it was not long before he was invited to <HI>London,</HI> to serve the cure of a friend going into the
<PB N="6" REF="012280_0004_0F8A8A26B22422C8"/>country. He continued there two months, lodging in the <HI>Tower,</HI> reading prayers in the chapel twice a week, catechizing and preaching once, besides daily visiting the soldiers in the barracks and the infirma∣ry. He also read prayers every evening at <HI>Wapping</HI> chapel, and preached at <HI>Ludgate</HI>-prison every <HI>Tues∣day.</HI> While he was here, letters came from his friends in <HI>Georgia,</HI> which made him long to go and help them. But not seeing his call clear, at the appointed time he returned to his little charge at <HI>Oxford;</HI> where se∣veral youths met daily at his room, to <HI>build up each other in their most holy faith.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. But he was quickly called from hence again, to supply the cure of <HI>Dummer</HI> in <HI>Hampshire.</HI> Here he read Prayers twice a day, early in the morning and in the evening, after the people came from work. He also daily catechized the children, and visited from house to house. He now divided the day into three parts, alloting eight hours for sleep and meals, eight for study and retirement, and eight for reading pray∣ers, catechizing, and visiting the people.—Is there a more excellent way for a servant of Christ and his church? If not, Who will not <HI>go and do likewise?</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Yet his mind still ran on going abroad. And being now fully convinced he was called of GOD thereto, he set all things in order, and in <HI>January</HI> 1737, went down to take leave of his friends in <HI>Gloucester.</HI> It was in this journey that GOD began to bless his ministry in an uncommon manner. Wherever he preached, amazing multitudes of hearers flocked toge∣ther, in <HI>Gloucester,</HI> in <HI>Stonehouse,</HI> in <HI>Bath,</HI> in <HI>Bristol</HI> so that the heat of the churches was scarce support∣able. And the impressions made on the minds of many, were no less extraordinary. After his return to <HI>London,</HI> while he was detained by general <HI>Ogle∣thorpe,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="012280_0004_0F8A8A26B22422C8"/>from week to week, and from month to month, it pleased GOD to bless his word still more. And he was indefatigable in his labour: generally on <HI>Sunday</HI> he preached four times to exceeding large auditories; besides reading prayers twice or thrice, and walking to and fro ten or twelve miles.</P>
<P N="9">9. On <HI>December</HI> 28 he left <HI>London.</HI> It was on the 29th that he first preached without notes. <HI>December</HI> 30 he went on board; but it was above a month be∣fore they cleared the land. One happy effect of their very slow passage, he mentions in <HI>April</HI> follow∣ing: <Q>Blessed be GOD, we now live very comfort∣ably in the great cabbin. We talk of little else but GOD and CHRIST: And scarce a word is heard among us when together, but what has re∣ference to our fall in the first, and our new birth in the second <HI>Adam.</HI></Q> It seems likewise to have been a peculiar Providence, that he should spend a little time at <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> where both citizens and soldiers, high and low, young and old, acknowledged the day of their visitation.</P>
<P N="10">10. From <HI>Sunday, May</HI> 7, 1738, till the latter end of <HI>August</HI> following, he <HI>made full proof of his mi∣nistry</HI> in <HI>Georgia,</HI> particularly at <HI>Savannah:</HI> He read prayers and expounded twice a day, and visited the sick daily. On <HI>Sunday</HI> he expounded at five in the morning; at ten read prayers and preached, and at three in the afternoon: And at seven in the evening expounded the church catechism. How much easi∣er is it for our brethren in the ministry, either in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> to find fault with such a labourer in our Lord's vineyard, than to tread in his steps?</P>
<P N="11">11. It was now that he observed the deplorable condition of many children here; and that GOD put
<PB N="8" REF="012280_0005_0F8A8A282AC9FEA8"/>into his heart the first thought of sounding an <HI>Or∣phan-House:</HI> for which he determined to raise con∣tributions in <HI>England,</HI> if GOD should give him a safe return thither. In <HI>December</HI> following he did re∣turn to <HI>London:</HI> and on <HI>Sunday, January</HI> the 14th, 1739, he was ordained Priest, at <HI>Christ-Church, Ox∣ford.</HI> The next day he came to <HI>London</HI> again: and on <HI>Sunday</HI> the 21st preached twice. But though the churches were large, and crowded exceedingly, yet many hundreds stood in the church-yard, and hun∣dreds more returned home. This put him upon the first thought of preaching in the open air. But when he mentioned it to some of his friends, they judged it to be mere madness. So he did not carry it into execution, till after he had left <HI>London.</HI> It was on <HI>Wednesday, February</HI> 21, that finding all the church∣doors to be shut in <HI>Bristol,</HI> (beside that no church was able to contain one half of the congregation) at three in the afternoon he went to <HI>Kingswood,</HI> and preached abroad, to near two thousand people. On <HI>Friday</HI> he preached there to four or five thousand; and on <HI>Sunday</HI> to (it was supposed) ten thousand. The number continually increased all the time he staid at <HI>Bristol.</HI> And a flame of holy love was kin∣dled, which will not easily be put out. The same was afterwards kindled in various parts of <HI>Wales,</HI> of <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI> and <HI>Worcestershire.</HI> Indeed where∣ever he went, <HI>GOD</HI> abundantly confirmed the word of his messenger.</P>
<P N="12">12. On <HI>Sunday April</HI> 29, he preached the first time in <HI>Moorfields,</HI> and on <HI>Kennington</HI> common, and the thousands of hearers were as quiet as they could have been in a church. Being again detained in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> from month to month, he made little excursions into several counties, and received the contributions
<PB N="9" REF="012280_0005_0F8A8A282AC9FEA8"/>of willing multitudes, for an <HI>Orphan-house</HI> in <HI>Geor∣gia.</HI> The embargo which was now laid on the ship∣ping, gave him leisure for the more journies, through various parts of <HI>England,</HI> for which many will have reason to bless God to all eternity. At length on <HI>August</HI> 14th he embarked, but he did not land in <HI>Pensylvania</HI> till <HI>October</HI> 30. Afterwards he went through <HI>Pensylvania,</HI> the <HI>Jersies, New-York, Mary∣land, Virginia, North</HI> and <HI>South Carolina,</HI> preach∣ing all along to immense congregations, with full as great effect as in <HI>England.</HI> On <HI>January</HI> 10, 1740, he arrived at <HI>Savannah.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>January</HI> 29, he added three desolate orphans to near twenty which he had in his house before. The next day he laid out the ground for the house, about ten miles from <HI>Savannah. February</HI> 11, he took in four Orphans more, and set out for <HI>Frederi∣ca,</HI> in order to fetch the orhans that were in the southern parts of the colony. In his return he fixt a school, both for children and grown persons, at <HI>Darien,</HI> and took four orphans thence. <HI>March</HI> 25, he laid the first stone of the <HI>Orphan-House,</HI> to which, with great propriety, he gave the name of <HI>Bethes∣da;</HI> a work for which the children yet unborn shall praise the LORD. He had now about forty orphans, so that there were near an hundred mouths to be fed daily. But he was <HI>careful for nothing,</HI> casting his care on HIM who <HI>feedeth the young ravens that call upon him.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. In <HI>April</HI> he made another tour through <HI>Penn∣sylvania,</HI> the <HI>Jersies,</HI> and <HI>New-York.</HI> Incredible multitudes flocked to hear him, among whom were abundance of negroes. In all places the greater part of the hearers were affected to an amazing de∣gree. Many were deeply convinced of their lost
<PB N="10" REF="012280_0006_0F8A8A28DDA95A70"/>state; many truly converted to <HI>GOD.</HI> In some pla∣ces thousands cried out aloud; many as in the agonies of death; most were drowned in tears; some turn∣ed pale as death; others were wringing their hands; others lying on the ground; others sinking into the arms of their friends; almost all lifting up their eyes, and calling for mercy.</P>
<P N="15">15. He return'd to <HI>Savannah June</HI> 5. The next evening, during the public service, the whole con∣gregation, young and old, were dissolved in tears; after service, several of the parishioners, and all his family, particularly the young children, returned home crying along the street, and some could not help praying aloud. The groans and cries of the children continued all night, and great part of the next day.</P>
<P N="16">16. In <HI>August</HI> he set out again, and through vari∣ous provinces came to <HI>Boston.</HI> While he was here, and in the neighbouring places, he was extremely weak in body. Yet the multitudes of hearers were so great, and the effects wrought on them so asto∣nishing, as the oldest men then alive in the town had never seen before. The same power attended his preaching at <HI>New-York;</HI> particularly on <HI>Sunday, November</HI> 2, almost as soon as he began, crying, weeping, and wailing, were to be heard on every side. Many sunk down to the ground, cut to the heart; and many were filled with divine consolation. Toward the close of this journey he made this re∣flection: <Q>It is the seventy-fifth day since I arrived at <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> exceeding weak in body. Yet <HI>GOD</HI> has enabled me to preach an hundred and seventy-five times in public, besides exhorting fre∣quently in private. Never did <HI>GOD</HI> vouchsafe me greater comforts: Never did I perform my jour∣nies
<PB N="11" REF="012280_0006_0F8A8A28DDA95A70"/>with less fatigue, or see such a continuance of the divine presence in the congregations to whom I preached.</Q> In <HI>December</HI> he returned to <HI>Sa∣vannah,</HI> and in the <HI>March</HI> following arrived in <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P N="17">17. You may easily observe, that the preceding account is chiefly extracted from his own Journals, which, for their artless and unaffected simplicity, may vie with any writings of the kind. And how exact a specimen is this of his labours both in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> for the honour of his beloved Master, du∣ring the thirty years that followed! As well as of the uninterrupted shower of blessings wherewith GOD was pleased to succeed his labours! Is it not much to be lamented, that any thing should have prevented his continuing this account, till at least, near the time when he was called by his, <HI>LORD</HI> to enjoy the fruit of his labour?—If he has left any papers of this kind, and his friends count me worthy of the honour, it would be my glory and joy to me∣thodize, transcribe, and prepare them for the pub∣lic view.</P>
<P N="18">18. A particular account of the last scene of his life, is thus given by a gentleman of <HI>Boston:</HI> <Q>Af∣ter being about a month with us in <HI>Boston</HI> and its vicinity, and preaching every day, he went to <HI>Old-York,</HI> preached on <HI>Thursday, September</HI> 27, there; proceeded to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> and preached there on <HI>Friday.</HI> On <HI>Saturday</HI> morning he set out for <HI>Boston;</HI> but before he came to <HI>Newbury,</HI> where he had engaged to preach the next morn∣ing, he was importuned to preach by the way. The house not being large enough to contain the people, he preached in the open field. But ha∣ving been infirm for several weeks, this so exhaust∣ed
<PB N="12" REF="012280_0007_0F8A8A29AD57D190"/>his strength, that when he came to <HI>Newbury</HI> he could not get out of the ferry-boat without the help of two men. In the evening, however, he recovered his spirits, and appeared with his u∣sual cheerfulness. He went to his chamber at nine, his fixt time, which no company could di∣vert him from; and slept better than he had done for some weeks before. He rose at four in the morning, <HI>September</HI> 30, and went into his closet; and his companion observed he was unusually long in private. He left his closet, returned to his companion, threw himself on the bed, and lay a∣bout ten minutes. Then he fell upon his knees, and prayed most fervently to GOD, That if it was consistant with his will, he might that day finish his Master's work." He then desired his man to call Mr. <HI>Parsons,</HI> the clergyman at whose house he was: But in a minute, before Mr. <HI>Parsons</HI> could reach him, died without a sigh or groan. On the news of his death, six gentlemen set out for <HI>New∣bury,</HI> in order to bring his remains hither, but he could not be moved, so that his precious ashes must remain at <HI>Newbury.</HI> Hundreds would have gone from this town to attend his funeral, had they not expected he would have been interred here.—May this stroke be sanctified to the church of GOD in general, and to this province in parti∣cular!</Q></P>
<P N="1">II. 1. We are in the second place, to take some view of his character. A little sketch of this, was soon published in the <HI>Boston Gazette:</HI> An extract of which is subjoined: <Q>Little can be said of him, but what every friend to vital Christianity, who has sat under his ministry, will attest. In his pub∣lic labours he has for many years astonished the
<PB N="13" REF="012280_0007_0F8A8A29AD57D190"/>world with his eloquence and devotion. With what divine pathos did he persuade the impeni∣tent sinner to embrace the practice of piety and virtue! Filled with the spirit of grace, he spoke from the heart, and with fervency of zeal, per∣haps unequalled since the days of the apostles, a∣dorned the truths he delivered with the most graceful charms of rhetoric and oratory. From the pulpit he was unrivalled in the command of an ever-crowded auditory. Nor was he less agreeable and instructive in his private conversation: Happy in a remarkable ease of address; willing to com∣municate, studious to edify. May the rising ge∣neration catch a spark of that flame which shone with such distinguished lustre in the spirit and practice of this faithful servant of the most high GOD!</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. A more particular, and equally just character of him, has appeared in one of the <HI>English</HI> papers. It may not be disagreeable to you, to add the sub∣stance of this likewise: <Q>The character of this tru∣ly pious person, must be deeply imprest on the heart of every friend of vital religion. In spite of a tender and delicate constitution, he continued, to the last day of his life, preaching with a fre∣quency and a fervor that seemed to exceed the natural strength of the most robust. Being called to the exercise of his function at an age, when most young men are only beginning to qualify themselves for it, he had not time to make a very considerable progress in the learned languages. But this defect was amply supplied, by a lively and fertile genius, by fervent zeal, and by a forcible and most persuasive delivery. And though in the pulpit he often found it needful, by <HI>the terrors of
<PB N="14" REF="012280_0008_0F8A8A2A6405DCE0"/>the Lord to persuade men,</HI> he had nothing gloom in his nature, being singularly cheerful, as well as charitable and tender hearted. He was as read to relieve the bodily as the spiritual necessities of those that applied to him. It ought also to be observed, that he constantly enforced upon his audience, every duty, particularly industry in their several callings, and obedience to the superiors. He endeavoured, by the most extra∣ordinary efforts of preaching in different place and even in the open fields, to rouse the lower <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of people, from the last degree of inattention and ignorance, to a sense of religion. For this and his other labours, the name of <HI>George Whitefield</HI> will long be remembered with esteem and venera∣tion.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. That both these accounts are just and imparti∣al, will readily be allowed; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as far as they go. But they go little farther than the <HI>outside</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his character. They shew you the <HI>Preacher,</HI> but not the <HI>Man,</HI> the <HI>Christian,</HI> the <HI>Saint</HI> of GOD. May I be permitted to add a little on this head, from personal knowledge of near forty years? Indeed, I am thoroughly sensible how difficult it is to speak <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so delicate a subject; what prudence is required to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣void both extremes, to say neither too little, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> too much? Nay, I know it is impossible to speak all, to say either less or more, without incurring from some the former, from others the latter censure. Some will seriously think, that too little is said; and others that it is too much. But without attending to this, I will speak just what I know, before Him to whom we are all to give an account.</P>
<P N="4">4. Mention has already been made of his unp∣aralleled <HI>Zeal,</HI> his indefatigable <HI>Activity,</HI> his <HI>Tender</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="012280_0008_0F8A8A2A6405DCE0"/><HI>heartedness</HI> to the afflicted, and <HI>Charitableness</HI> to∣ward the poor. But should we not likewise men∣tion his deep <HI>Gratitude,</HI> to all whom GOD had us∣ed as instruments of good to him? Of whom he did not cease to speak in the most respectful manner, even to his dying day. Should we not mention, that he had an heart susceptible of the most gener∣ous and the most tender <HI>Friendship?</HI> I have frequent∣ly thought, that this, of all others, was the distin∣guishing part of his character. How few have we known of so kind a temper, of such large and flow∣ing affections? was it not principally by this, that the hearts of others were so strangely drawn and knit to him? Can any thing but love beget love? This shone in his very countenance, and continually breathed in all his words, whether in public or pri∣vate. Was it not this, which, quick and penetrat∣ing as lightning, flew from heart to heart? Which gave that life to his Sermons, his Conversations, his Letters? Ye are witnesses.</P>
<P N="5">5. But away with the vile misconstruction of men of corrupt minds, who know of no love but what is <HI>Earthly and sensual.</HI> Be it remembered, at the same time, that he was endued with the most nice and un∣blemished <HI>modesty.</HI> His office called him to converse very frequently and largely, with women as well as men; and those of every age and condition. But his whole behaviour toward them, was a practical momment on that advice of St. <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy, In∣treat the elder women as mothers, the younger as sis∣ters, with all purity.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Mean time, how suitable to the friendliness of his spirit, was the <HI>frankness</HI> and <HI>openness</HI> of his con∣versation? Although it was as far removed from rudeness on the one hand, as from guile and disguise
<PB N="16" REF="012280_0009_0F8A8A2B1502C0F0"/>on the other. Was not this frankness at once a fruit and a proof of his <HI>courage</HI> and <HI>intrepidity?</HI> Armed with these, he feared not the faces of men, but <HI>used great plainness of speech</HI> to persons of every rank and condition, high and low, rich and poor: en∣deavouring only <HI>by manifestation of the truth,</HI> to <HI>commend himself to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Neither was he afraid of labour or pain, any more than of <HI>what man could do unto him,</HI> being equally
<Q>"<HI>Patient</HI> in bearing ill and doing well."</Q></P>
<P>And this appeared in the <HI>readiness</HI> wherewith has pursued whatever he undertook for his Master's sake. Witness one instance for all, the <HI>Orphan-House</HI> in <HI>Georgia,</HI> which he began and perfected, in spite of all discouragements. Indeed, in whatever concerned himself, he was pliant and flexible. In this case he was <HI>easy to be intreated,</HI> easy to be ei∣ther commenced or presuaded. But he was immove∣able in the things of GOD, or wherever his conscience was concerned. None could persuade, any more than affright him, to vary in the least point from that <HI>integrity,</HI> which was inseparable from his whole character, and regulated all his words and actions Herein he did
<Q><L>"Stand as an iron pillar strong,</L>
<L>"And stedfast as a wall of brass."</L></Q></P>
<P N="8">8. If it be required, What was the foundation of this integrity, or of his sincerity, courage, patience and every other valuable and amiable quality, it is easy to give the answer. It was not the excellence of his natural temper: Not the strength of his un∣derstanding: It was not the force of his education
<PB N="17" REF="012280_0009_0F8A8A2B1502C0F0"/>no, nor the advice of his friends. It was no other than faith in a bleeding LORD; <HI>Faith of the opera∣tion of God.</HI> It was <HI>a lively hope of an inheritance incorruptible, and that fadeth not away.</HI> It was <HI>the love of God shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost, which was given unto him,</HI> filling his soul with tender, disinterested love to every child of man. From this source arose that torrent of <HI>Elo∣quence</HI> which frequently bore down all before it: From this, that astonishing force of <HI>Persuasion,</HI> which the most hardened sinners could not resist. This it was, which often made his <HI>head as waters,</HI> and his eyes <HI>a fountain of tears.</HI> This it was which enabled him to pour out his soul in <HI>Prayer,</HI> in a manner pe∣culiar to himself, with such fullness and ease united together, with such strength and variety both of sentiment and expression.</P>
<P N="9">9. I may close this head with observing, What an honour it pleased GOD to put upon his faithful servant, by allowing him to declare his everlasting gospel in so many various countries, to such num∣bers of people, and with so great an effect on so many of their precious souls! Have we read or heard of any person since the apostles, who testified the gospel of the grace of GOD, through so widely ex∣tended a space, through so large a part of the habi∣table world? Have we read or heard of any person, who called so many thousands, so many miriads of sinners to repentance? Above all, have we read or heard of any, who has been a blessed instrument in his hand of <HI>bringing</HI> so many sinners from <HI>darkness to light, and from the power of a satan unto God?</HI> It is true, were we to talk thus to the gay world, we should be judged to <HI>speak as barbarians.</HI> But you understand the language of the country to which
<PB N="18" REF="012280_0010_0F8A8A2BE558AF28"/>you are going, and whither our dear friend is gone a little before us.</P>
<P N="3">III. But how shall we improve this awful provi∣dence? This is the <HI>Third</HI> thing which we have to consider. And the answer to this important questi∣on is easy; (may GOD write it in all our hearts!) By keeping close to the <HI>grand doctrines</HI> which he delivered: And by drinking into his <HI>spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. And first, let us keep close to the grand scrip∣tural doctrines, which he every where delivered. There are many doctrines of a less essential nature, with regard to which, even the sincere children of GOD (such is the present weakness of human un∣derstanding!) are and have been divided for many ages. In these we may think and let think; we may "agree to disagree." But mean time let us hold fast the essentials <HI>of the faith, which was once delivered to the saints;</HI> and which this champion of GOD so strongly insisted on, at all times, and in all places.</P>
<P N="2">2. His fundamental point was, give GOD all the glory of whatever is good in man. And in the busi∣ness of salvation, set CHRIST as high, and man as low as possible. With this point, he and his friends at <HI>Oxford,</HI> the original <HI>Methodists</HI> (so called) set out. Their grand principal was, there is <HI>no power</HI> (by na∣ture) and <HI>no merit</HI> in man. They insisted, All pow∣er to think, speak, or act right, is in and from the Spirit of CHRIST; And all merit is (not in man, how high soever in grace, but merely) in the blood of CHRIST. So he and they taught: There is no power in man, till it is given from above, to do one good work, to speak one good word, or to form one good desire. For it is not enough to say, all men are <HI>sick of sin:</HI> No, we are all <HI>Dead in trespasses and
<PB N="19" REF="012280_0010_0F8A8A2BE558AF28"/>sins.</HI> It follows, that all the children of men are <HI>by nature children of wrath.</HI> We are all <HI>guilty be∣fore God,</HI> liable to death temporal and eternal.</P>
<P N="3">3. And we are all helpless, both with regard to the power and to the guilt of sin. For <HI>who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</HI> None less than the Almighty. Who can raise those that are <HI>Dead,</HI> spiritually dead in sin? None but He who raised us from the dust of the earth But on what considera∣tion will he do this? <HI>Not for works of righteousness that we have done. The dead cannot praise thee, O Lord!</HI> Nor do any thing for the sake of which they should be raised to life. Whatever therefore GOD does, he does it merely for the sake of his well-be-loved Son: <HI>He was wounded for our trangressions, he was bruised for our iniquities. He himself bore all our sins in his own body upon the tree. He was de∣livered for our offences, and rose again for our justi∣fication.</HI> Here then is the sole <HI>meritorious cause</HI> of every blessing we do or can enjoy: In particular of our pardon and acceptance with GOD, of our full and free justification. But by what means do we become interested in what CHRIST has done and suf∣fered? <HI>Not by works, lest any man should boast;</HI> but by faith alone. <HI>We conclude,</HI> says the apostle, <HI>that a man is justified by faith, without the works of the law.</HI> And <HI>to as many as</HI> thus <HI>receive Him, giveth he power to become the sons of God: Even to those that believe in his name, who were born, not of the will of man, but of God.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. And <HI>except a man be thus born again, he can∣not see the kingdom of God.</HI> But all who are thus <HI>born of the spirit,</HI> have <HI>the kingdom of God within</HI> them. Christ sets up his kingdom in their hearts; <HI>Righte∣ousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.</HI> That <HI>mind
<PB N="20" REF="012280_0011_0F8A8A2CC42222D0"/>is in them, which was in Jesus Christ,</HI> enabling them to <HI>walk as Christ also walked.</HI> His in-dwelling-spirit makes them both holy in heart, and <HI>holy in all man∣ner of conversation.</HI> But still, seeing all this is a free gift, through the righteousness and blood of CHRIST, there is eternally the same reason to remember, <HI>He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. You are not ignorant, that these are the fun∣damental doctrines which he every where insisted on. And may they not be summed up, as it were, in two words, <HI>The new birth,</HI> and <HI>justification of faith?</HI> These let us insist upon with all boldness, at all times, and in all places: In public (those of us who are called thereto) and at all opportunities, in pri∣vate. Keep close to these good, old, unfashionable doctrines, how many soever contradict and blas∣pheme. Go on, my brethren, in the <HI>name of the Lord, and in the power of his might,</HI> With all care and deligence, <HI>keep that safe that is committed to your trust:</HI> Knowing that <HI>heaven and earth shall pass away; but</HI> this truth <HI>shall not pass away.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. But will it be sufficient, to keep close to his <HI>Doctrines,</HI> how pure soever they are? Is there not a point of still greater importance than this, namely to drink into his <HI>Spirit?</HI> Herein to <HI>be a follower of</HI> him, <HI>even as</HI> he was <HI>of Christ?</HI> Without this, the purity of our doctrines, would only increase our damnation. This therefore is the principal thing, to copy after his spirit. And allowing that in some points, we must be content, to <HI>admire</HI> what we can∣not <HI>imitate;</HI> yet in many others we may, through the same free grace, be partakers of the same bles∣sing. Conscious then of our own wants, and of his bounteous love, who <HI>giveth liberally and upbraideth not,</HI> cry to Him that worketh all in all, for a mea∣sure
<PB N="21" REF="012280_0011_0F8A8A2CC42222D0"/>of the same precious faith: Of the same zeal and activity, the same tender-heartedness, charita∣bleness, bowels of mercies. Wrestle with GOD for some degree of the same grateful, friendly, affecti∣onate temper; of the same openness, simplicity, and godly sincerity, <HI>Love without dissimulation.</HI> Wrestle on, till the Power from on high works in you the same steady courage and patience: And a∣bove all, because it is the crown of all, the same in∣variable integrity.</P>
<P N="7">7. Is there any other fruit of the grace of GOD, with which he was eminently endowed, and the want of which among the children of GOD he fre∣quently and passionately lamented? There is one, that is, <HI>Catholic love:</HI> That sincere and tender af∣fection, which is due to all those, who, we have reason to believe, are children of GOD by faith: In other words, all those in every persuasion, who <HI>fear God and work righteousness.</HI> He longed to see all who had <HI>tasted the good word,</HI> of a truly <HI>catholic spirit,</HI> (a word little understood and still less experi∣enced by many, who have it frequently in their mouth.) Who is he that answers this character? Who is a man of a <HI>catholic spirit?</HI> One who loves a friend, as brethren in the LORD, as joint partakers of the present kingdom of heaven, and fellow-heirs of his eternal kingdom, all of whatever opinion, mode of worship, or congregation, who believes in the LORD JESUS; who love GOD and man; who rejoice to please, and fear to offend GOD, are care∣ful to abstain from evil, and zealous of good works. He is a man of truly catholic spirit, who bears these continually upon his heart: Who having an unspeak∣able tenderness for their persons, and an earnesst de∣sire
<PB N="22" REF="012280_0012_0F8A8A2D60ADAD48"/>of their welfare, does not cease to commend them to GOD in prayer, as well as to plead their cause before men: Who speaks comfortably to them, and labours by all his words, to strengthen their hands in GOD. He assists them to the uttermost of his power, in all things, spiritual and temporal. He is ready to <HI>spend and to be spent</HI> for them; yea, to <HI>lay down his life for</HI> his <HI>brethren.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. How amiable a character is this? How desira∣ble to every child of GOD! But why is it then so rarely found? How is it, that there are so few instance of it? Indeed, supposing we have tasted of the love of GOD, how can any of us rest, till it is our own? Why, there is a delicate device, whereby Satan per∣suades thousands, that they may stop short of it and yet be guiltless. It is well, if many here pre∣sent are not in this <HI>snare of the devil, taken captive at his will.</HI> <Q>O yes, says one, I have all this love for those I believe to be children of GOD. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will never believe he is a child of GOD, who be∣longs to that <HI>vile congregation!</HI> Can he, do you think, be a child of GOD, who holds such <HI>detesta∣ble opinions?</HI> Or he that joins in such senseless and superstitious, if not idolatrous <HI>worship.</HI></Q> So we justify ourselves in one sin, by adding a second to it. We excuse the want of love in ourselves, by laying the blame on others. To colour our own devilish temper we pronounce our brethren children of the devil. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beware, of this! And if you are already taken in the snare, escape out of it as soon as possible. Go and learn that truly catholic love, which <HI>is not rash <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hasty</HI> in judging: That love which <HI>thinketh no evil,</HI> which <HI>believeth and hopeth all things:</HI> Which make all the allowances for others, that we desire other should make for us. Then we shall take knowledge
<PB N="23" REF="012280_0012_0F8A8A2D60ADAD48"/>of the grace of GOD, which is in every man, what∣ever be his opinion or mode of worship. Then will all that fear GOD be near and dear unto us, <HI>in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Was not this the spirit of our dear friend? And why should it not be ours? O thou GOD of love, how long shall thy people be a by word among the heathen? How long shall they laugh us to scorn, and say, <Q>See how <HI>these</HI> Christians love one ano∣ther?</Q> When wilt thou roll away our reproach! <HI>Shall the sword devour for ever? How long will it be, ere thou bid thy people return from following each other?</HI> Now at least, <HI>let all the people stand still, and pursue after</HI> their brethren <HI>no more!</HI> But whatever others do, let all of us my brethren, hear the voice of him that <HI>being dead, yet speaketh!</HI> Suppose ye hear him say, <Q>Now at least, <HI>be ye followers of me as I was of Christ!</HI> Let brother <HI>no more lift up sword</HI> against brother, neither <HI>know ye war any more!</HI> Rather <HI>put ye on, as the elect of God, bow∣els of mercies, humbleness of mind, brotherly kind∣ness, gentleness, long suffering, forbearing one an∣other in love.</HI> Let the time past suffice for strife, envy, contention; for <HI>biting and devouring one another.</HI> Blessed be GOD, that ye have not long ago been <HI>consumed one of another!</HI> From hence∣forth hold ye <HI>the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="10">10. O GOD, with thee no word is impossible: thou dost what whatsoever pleaseth thee! O that thou wouldst cause the mantle of thy prophet, whom thou hast taken up, now to fall upon us that remain! <HI>Where is the Lord God of Elijah? Let</HI> his <HI>Spirit rest upon</HI> these thy servants! Shew thou art the GOD that <HI>answered by fire!</HI> Let the fire of thy love
<PB N="24" REF="012280_0013_0F8A8A2E9292AF38"/>fall on every heart! And because we love thee, let us love one another with <HI>love stronger than death. Take away from us</HI> all <HI>anger, and wrath and bitter∣ness; all clamour and evil speaking.</HI> Let thy spirit rest upon us, that from this hour, we may be <HI>kind to each other, tender hearted: Forgiving one another, even as God, for Christ's sake, hath forgiven us!</HI></P>
