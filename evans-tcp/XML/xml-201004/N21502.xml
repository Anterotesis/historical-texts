<HEAD>Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THESE Essays are to be considered as only an introductory specimen of a much larger work, con∣sisting of Letters to a young Lady, on the much neglected subject of Fe∣male Education.—These letters were intended to be comprised in three small pocket volumes; the first recommend∣ing religious duties and writers for the culture of the heart; the second proper studies and authors for the im∣provement of the understanding; and the last pointing out the necessary, do∣mestic duties, as well as the proper manners, graces and accomplishments of the sex.</P>
<P>The whole work was intended to have made its appearance at the same time; but the intervention of other
<PB REF="028263_0003_0FD7DB5AA93EE620"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dies, professional engagements, as well as many private reasons of del∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y, which the Author does not feel himself at liberty to disclose, have in∣duced him to suspend, at least for the present, the publication of these Letters. Nor perhaps, may they now ever see the light, though nearly prepared for it, unless particularly called for (which he scarcely expects) by the encourage∣ment given to these preparatory sketch∣es. He has little to say concerning the performance now before the pub∣lic; but only that he conceives the subject to be important, whatever may be its execution. He is sensible how invidious a task it is to attack estab∣lished systems, prejudices, habits, er∣rors, that have been ridiculously <HI>con∣secrated,</HI> as it were, by the lapse of time, and what disgraceful epithets are lavished on the man, who sets up, from whatever motives, either for a censor or a reformer of his age. He
<PB N="v" REF="028263_0004_0FD7DB5CCAA9F330"/>is conscious that neither his talents nor his station will justify him in as∣suming so arduous a character, and has therefore cautiously concealed a name, which might only raise a prej∣udice against his bold undertaking, and hidden himself behind the shade of secrecy, until criticism shall have ful∣ly emptied its quiver, and <Q>the in∣dignation of publick censure is overpast. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the Publication of the first Edi∣tion of these <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>e,</HI> the author has thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gible to prefix his name to the work.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Still as he conceives that the cause of truth and virtue should fear <HI>no discouragements,</HI> and that neither mediocrity of talents nor obscurity of station should discourage a man from <HI>great</HI> undertakings, the time may come, when he shall openly avow these pro∣ductions of his pen, contented with the pittance, which an impartial publick shall be pleased to give him, of censure or of fame.</P>

<PB N="9" REF="028263_0008_0FD7DB72C44D5D38"/>witter deemed it a subject worthy of a full or a serious discussion.</P>
<P>Many systems of instruction have been adopted for the other sex, va∣rious as the countries, the religion, the climate, or even as the caprices of the writers, who, at different pe∣riods, have undertaken to compose them. But, by a strange fatality, women have been considerably o∣mitted in the account, as if they were not gifted with reason and understanding, but were only to be valued for the beauty of their persons, for the elegance of their manners, or the symmetry of their forms.</P>
<P>At the same time, we make no concessions, or abatement in our expectations from them, for this contemptuous neglect. Forming a high and flattering estimate of what their character <HI>should</HI> be, we extend no allowance for this
<PB N="10" REF="028263_0009_0FD7DB73E5BD5C98"/>insuperable disadvantage. We ex∣pect a rich, <HI>spontaneous</HI> harvest to spring from an untilled soil; and whilst we make their failings inev∣itable by our remissness, we fail not to load them with the heaviest censure, ridicule and contempt.</P>
<P>Complaints against the foibles and imprudence of women are al∣most coeval with the foundation of the world.—Whatever, in other in∣stances, may have been the scarcity of genius and talents, yet <HI>their</HI> im∣perfections have never wanted re∣corders. To do them <HI>ample justice,</HI> and place them in every varying point of view for the amusement of a busy and illnatured curiosity, for the gratification of a dark and malignant spleen, or the purpose of a publick and humiliating cor∣rection, the shafts of satire, the flights of poetry, the lucubrations of the moralist, and even the more
<PB N="11" REF="028263_0010_0FD7DB7830F34FA0"/>dignified labours of the Divine have, in turns, been employed. Many<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, Euripides, Thucydides, Boccace, an Italian Author, in his Laberyn to de Parnor, Pope, Swift, Con∣greve, &amp;c.

Dei.</NOTE> famous author of Greece and Rome, of modern Europe, and of our own country, have formed an ignominious phalanx, to wage, in inky armour, an unequal battle against this tender and defenceless sex. Even the sacred books of Rev∣elation have been called in to sanc∣tion these malevolent effusions; and, because Solomon declaimed, at an early period, only against the worst and most abandoned of the sex, he has been followed by a number of servile imitators, of all ages and nations, who indiscrim∣inately, have applied the dark por∣trait to all. I will not add a Ches∣terfield to a group, (whose letters
<PB N="12" REF="028263_0011_0FD7DB79294959E8"/>to his son, from beginning to end, are one continued libel upon wom∣en) because I wish the memory of his <HI>immortal graces,</HI> and his refined dissimulation, to sleep forever with him in his grave.</P>
<P>Nor is this sex more indebted, in general, to those, who assume the appearance of friendship and esteem. Like princes, they seldom hear the language of truth. Ma∣ny, like a Judas, betray them with a kiss. Their charms excite a fu∣gitive passion. Passion vents it∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>f in profuse adulation. And that flattery has frequently little more in view, than a momentary pleas∣ure, which must borrow its exist∣ence from their misery and ruin.</P>
<P>To enumerate the various charg∣es, which have been adduced, at different times, against this amia∣ble part of the Creation, would be a very difficult and laborious
<PB N="13" REF="028263_0012_0FD7DB7C321DC1F8"/>undertaking.

<PB N="14" REF="028263_0013_0FD7DB81CF01DBA0"/>the frothiness of their conversation. He who courts their society from motives of fashion, and makes it a system to say every thing but <HI>truth,</HI> pronounces them greedy of flat∣tery in the extreme, and capable of swallowing that undeserved praise, which is the severest satire in dis∣guise. The scholar is disgusted with their ignorance and insipidity; the lover with their coquetry, ca∣prices and inconstancy in the ten∣der connections. And he, who seeks them with the most honour∣able views, for the companions of his life, is terrified with the pros∣pect of that fondness for gaiety, which would sacrifice every emo∣tion of the heart to splendour and parade, and, instead of making his retirement a Paradise, threatens to convert it into a dreary wilderness of vexation and remorse. From all quarters they have been attack∣ed;
<PB N="15" REF="028263_0014_0FD7DB83A5FC4610"/>and whilst their form is con∣fessed to be enchanting, they are treated, by the bulk of men, as fit for little else but some domestick drudgeries, or some indelicate en∣joyments.</P>
<P>How far these heavy charges are founded on truth, it would appear invidious, and it is not, by any means, necessary to determine. Suffice it to remark in favour of this injured and persecuted sex, that the judge would be esteemed a monster of cruelty, who first in∣duced a person to be a culprit, and afterwards condemned.</P>
<P>It is an established and univer∣sally received maxim, that the future sentiments, actions and characters of men are considerably influenced by their earliest edu∣cation; and if we consider the su∣perior susceptibility of women, and that exquisite sensibility, which so
<PB N="16" REF="028263_0015_0FD7DB2F344A2F48"/>wonderfully dispose them to re∣ceive all impressions, and, in fact, have made so many of that sex, in different periods, and in various circumstances, martyrs to love, to friendship and devotion, it is reas∣onable to conclude, that, if they are defective in any rational at∣tainments, it is for want of a ju∣dicious and timely cultivation. If a soul, so <HI>lodged,</HI> was not ne∣glected, it would not be without its necessary excellences. If a mine so rich, was worked with skill and industry, it would reward its own∣er with as great a quantity of sol∣id gold and treasure, as, now, it only mocks him with a light and superficial tinsel, that glitters on the eye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> To censure them before we have made this experiment, is ungenerous anticipation. It is expecting to reap, where we have
<PB N="17" REF="028263_0016_0FD7DB87A4479130"/>not sowed, and gather where we have not strewed.</P>
<P>Whether we look into foreign countries or our own, and wheth∣er into the ancient or modern his∣tories of both, it will plainly ap∣pear that the instruction of wom∣en has engrossed but a little share of the publick attention; and, to a speculative mind, it may afford a moment's curious entertainment, if I endeavour to investigate the cause of this phaenomenon, why mankind have so uniformly ne∣glected the heart and understand∣ing of a creature, whose person has called forth their warmest pane∣gyricks, and whose shrine they have approached with the richest incense of idolatry and adulation.</P>
<P>The happy age of our first par∣ents in Eden is no subject of this contem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>on. A state or inti∣mate
<PB N="18" REF="028263_0017_0FD7DB89AB6B7E68"/>communion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>th God sup∣poses every possible degree of intel∣lectual information. The knowl∣ledge of both sexes issued imme∣diately from the fountain of light, and, if it was not communicated in equal rays to both, our first father would be impelled by the combined workings of duty and affection, to make up, in the most insinuating manner, the difference to a woman, whom heaven had so lately given "as its last, best gift;" whom he had led "so sweetly blush∣ing to the nuptial bower;" whom solitary haunts and familiar conver∣sations must have riveted so very closely to his heart; whose un∣studied innocence, and unartisicial charms must have poured a de∣licious rapture through his soul, who combined in her own person all the tenderest relationships, and monopolized all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>eliest names
<PB N="19" REF="028263_0018_0FD7DB8AF66F93D0"/>and attachments, and without whose society, all the fragrant shrubs, and fruits, and blossoms of his Paradise would have been but <HI>insipid</HI> and unanimated blessings.</P>
<P>So soon as we lose fight of Par∣adise (and alas! the golden pros∣pect soon fades upon the eye) we trace the dawnings of shameful negligence to women. We dis∣cover the baneful operation of a system, which, insensible to their charms, and unmindful of the blessings which they pour upon society, has bound them in the fet∣ters of an illiberal oppression. The earliest ages of the world are dis∣figured with a degrading treatment of this sex, which, notwithstand∣ing all the allowance to be made for difference of manners, and primitive simplicity, necessarily in∣volves but little moral culture, and less rational instruction. The sac∣red
<PB N="20" REF="028263_0019_0FD7DB8BEA834530"/>writings exhibit women, en∣gaged in the most laborious and ser∣vile employments, tending flocks, carrying water and performing many other domestick drudgeries, which, whilst they strike us as un∣suited to the dignity of their char∣acter, or the delicacy of their frame, evidently bespeak the very low es∣timation in which they were held.</P>
<P>The truth is, (and it is a first principle, to which we must often have recourse in the progress of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> quiry) a considerable civ∣ili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation must have taken place in any age or country, before the manners of women will be suf∣ficiently captivating to raise our admit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion, or before we ourselves shall ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny susceptibility of their many little, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>meless and delicate attractions.

On this <HI>morn∣ing</HI> of the world such an aera had not dawned. The pastoral life and agriculture, as they supplied the wants, occupied the hours and bounded likewise the wishes of these primitive and undesigning men. Satisfied with a plain and
<PB N="22" REF="028263_0021_0FD7DB8FA3576CA0"/>frugal repast, they sighed not for riches, and never so much as dream∣ed of a commerce, which in ma∣turer progressions of society, should spend its days, and nights and <HI>soul</HI> to accumulate, if possible, upon a single point, the treasures of the world. Ambition was, as yet, asleep, nor had Imagination opened to their dazzled view, its boundless regions of artificial pleasures, or artificial pains. Science was un∣cultivated, and taste was unborn; the manners of the men were pro∣portionably coarse, and the women were unrefined. It was happy, indeed, for the latter, that they were so. If they had been other∣wise, their sensibility must have shuddered at the lowness of their servitude, and the rigours of sub∣jection.</P>

Women, in such a mode of calculation, were com∣paratively, cyphers; and, when they had produced a race of sav∣age and of healthy warriors for the state, were supposed to have fulfilled the purposes of their exist∣ence, if they did not even possess one sentiment of the heart, or one illuminating ray of understanding.</P>

<P>Hitherto I have placed the cause of female neglect in the want of a proper civilization and refine∣ment, and considered it as result∣ing from a particular stage of so∣ciety and manners. I have been reviewing periods and nations, in which a savage barbarism or an ardent thirst of extending domin∣ion was considered as the essence of wisdom and of glory. I have been speculating, at leisure, on the conduct of men, uninfluenced by
<PB N="52" REF="028263_0051_0FD7F8ABCD5BF3D0"/>religious sentiments and unenlight∣ened by the gospel. If, therefore, we have blamed their treatment of this sex, their criminality is con∣siderably alleviated by their igno∣rance, and those very physical causes, which produced, palliate the moral guilt, which would, other∣wise, attend it. We pity women; and, from views more enlarged than their despots had, we even pity or forgive their oppressors. If the first were degraded, insulted or enslaved, candour pleads in fa∣vour of the latter, that no proper sense of duty operated on their conscience; that revelation had not dissipated their intellectual darkness, or pointed out the awful consequences of actions; and that they did not know the richness or the value of the jewel they despis∣ed.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="028263_0052_0FD7F8570D28D5E0"/>
But when we come to coun∣tries and aeras, when all the secon∣dary causes of advanced know∣ledge, taste and civilization combine with that, which should always be the first (I mean religious princi∣ple) to give women every possible advantage of moral discipline and cultivation; when, as men valuing themselves on their refinement, we should deny no attentions to this weaker sex, and, as Christians, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e taught that they, like all oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣man creatures, are of infinite con∣sequence in the sight of heaven; that they are gifted with the treas∣ure of an immortal soul; that they are training for eternal hap∣piness or misery; that the awful alternative will very much depend on their present education; and that the care of it, therefore, is the highest duty, that can possibly en∣gage the parental solicitude—with
<PB N="54" REF="028263_0053_0FD7F8AE4D957E48"/>these <HI>phy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>l</HI> advantages—these suggestions of <HI>conscience</HI>—and these powerful impressions of <HI>religion</HI> on the mind—what can be said, if any negligence is <HI>still</HI> observable to those, who, at the same time, are confessedly the fairest and most elegant part of the creation; who bear and nurse our offsprings, are admitted to our bosoms, alleviate our cares; who, by their gentle∣ness, compose the agitations of our minds, and are formed to con∣tribute to all the delicate pleasures and transports of life? What pleas can we offer to extenuate our guilt? What evasions can we make at the tribunal of reason or of Heaven, and what more than even <HI>savage</HI> insensibility must dark∣en our characters with an indelible disgrace.</P>
<P>The condition of women in England, no doubt, may justly be
<PB N="55" REF="028263_0054_0FD7F858BB6EB0F0"/>pronounced to be supremely hap∣py, if we compare it with what that of many females has been in some of the ages, that have just passed in review before us, or what it <HI>is,</HI> at <HI>present,</HI> in most countries of the world. They have certain∣ly, in their allotment <HI>here,</HI> as many obvious advantages, over women in <HI>general,</HI> as Nature has given them a marked superiority of per∣sonal beauty, figure and attrac∣tions. If Europe has been called the <HI>Paradise</HI> of the sex, Britain seems to be the choicest spot of this Paradise, in which the sove∣reign Former has deigned to place the fairest of the fair, and munifi∣cently, to distil, upon their favour∣ed heads, the richest of his sweets. In a happy, and enviable tem∣perature of climate, in the riches of commerce, in the improvement of the arts, in the blessings of lib∣erty,
<PB N="56" REF="028263_0055_0FD7F8AF54128108"/>and of a religion purified from bigotry on the one hand, and fanaticism on the other, they are, doubtless, equal partakers with ourselves. Nor in the present scale of society, do British ladies want considerable weight. Is it the <HI>fashion</HI> of the times to pay them attentions; and gallantry is planning honours for itself, when it seems only studious to decorate the brows, and to enhance the consequence of women. Incivility to a female, however <HI>frivolous,</HI> would, in modern estimation, re∣dound upon its author, however <HI>distinguished;</HI> and even men of rig∣id principles are led, almost <HI>me∣chanically,</HI> to heap flattering com∣pliments and encomiums upon women, for which their private judgment does not always find a claim in their hearts or under∣standing. Still if this sex could
<PB N="57" REF="028263_0056_0FD7F859D210FC18"/>diseriminate nicely, and would di∣vest themselves of an infatuating vanity, perhaps they would discov∣er, that even all this amounts not to a <HI>rational</HI> or an <HI>adequate</HI> atten∣tion.</P>
<P>Is it not a strong impulse of passion, that suggests such smooth things? Is it not a selfish vanity, that would be called polite, and stand well with the sex? Is it not a studious accommodation of our∣selves to (what we conceive) their frivolous sentiments and taste? Is it not a policy, which shrinks from their censure, and would not wholly sacrifice their applause and admi∣ration? Is it not the <HI>mechanical</HI> influence of manners, unaccom∣panied with any correspondent con∣viction, or is it not a motley figure, composed of all these different ma∣terials, which we offer at their shrine, without any very high o∣pinion
<PB N="58" REF="028263_0057_0FD7F8B10A82CFA8"/>of the sex, or any proper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>timation.</P>
<P>It the Ladies knew what unre∣served observations, we make upon them, in their absence, and what degrading liberties are taken with their characters, particularly by those, who offer them, when pres∣ent, the most fulsome adulation, they would know, that this is a necessary caution, and they would learn to distinguish a <HI>supersicial</HI> po∣liteness from a <HI>real</HI> respect. If they would reason justly, they might soon be undeceived. They might conclude from the very face of their prevailing education, that we wish them to bewitch our sen∣ses by their beauty and accom∣plishments, instead of securing our love and our esteem by any solid qualities or any rational acquire∣ments.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="028263_0058_0FD7F85BC8112F80"/>
But let us carefully analyze this subject. Let us come to first prin∣ciples, and reason from facts.</P>
<P>Till of late years, a very re∣markable negligence prevailed in the culture of their understanding.</P>
<P>It requires no violent effort of memory to recall the period, when there were females, and of no trifling rank, that were not able to compose or even <HI>spell</HI> a letter with propriety; and though of late, this defect has been con∣siderably remedied, yet how insuf∣ficient is the education, which we still, generally give them to fit them to be prudent mothers, sen∣sible companions, wise and valua∣ble members of society, or (what is most of all) thoughtful and re∣ligious christians? As soon as they are born, we consign them over to the care of a mercenary nurse who infuses, with her milk,
<PB N="60" REF="028263_0059_0FD7F8B456B28818"/>the illiberality of her mind, the ruggedness of her temper, and the <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le</HI> diseases of her constitution, and, when they are of age to dis∣criminate, and lay in a stock of ideas, we fend them to a boarding school to learn, what? Musick, dancing, accomplishments, dissi∣pation and intrigue—every thing but solid knowledge—every thing but humility—every thing but pi∣ety—every thing but virtue?</P>
<P>Is this an adequate discharge of the parental (that is) the highest of all christian and social duties? Can a mother easily acquit her conscience, if a girl thus vitiated from her early years, becomes the slave of folly, the plaything of fashion, the dupe, as she grows up, of some insidious villain, or, at least, the insipid poisoner of a connexion, that promised every
<PB N="61" REF="028263_0060_0FD7F85E716CEC70"/>sweet and every blessing? When such a mother lies upon her death∣bed, will she feel no melancholy re∣gret for a daughter's <HI>past,</HI> and no dreadful anticipation of her <HI>future</HI> indiscretions? Can she bid her the last adieu with a composed heart, and will not these words dart, like a sunbeam, on her awakened con∣science, <Q>And thou shalt teach these statutes diligently unto thy children, (of these surely daugh∣ters are a part) and shalt talk of them, when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down and when thou risest up?</Q></P>
<P>There are, doubtless, many ex∣ceptions to be made of parents, who are studiously and religiously attentive to this important duty. The Queen of these realms is an illustrious instance. Amidst all
<PB N="62" REF="028263_0061_0FD7F8B54E352178"/>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> incir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling cares of greatness and the enchantments of a throne, she has never forgotten, even for a moment, the tenderest or the minutest attentions of a <HI>mother.</HI> Her royal daughters do honour to her efforts and proclaim her suc∣cess.

<P>Nor do I wish to deny the mer∣it of those few, who have even handled the pen upon this subject. I am ready to acknowledge every attention bestowed on the sex, by the labours of a Halifax, by the the sensible and religious observa∣tions of a Chapone, and the more elegant and judicious sketches of a Gregory. The present writings of Madame la Comtesse de Genlis are a treasure to young Ladies.

Still a few examples, to the contrary, do not affect a general observation. Such a <HI>partial</HI> remedy is not calculated to remove the malignant disorder. Even royal virtue, in this instance, has not spread with so diffusive a rapidity, as would probably, have attended royal indiscretion.</P>
<P>It may be said, that England justly boasts many literary women. True. But who can say that they are not so many <HI>prodigies</HI> in their
<PB N="65" REF="028263_0064_0FD7F86517B9D270"/>species, or that general rules admit not of exceptions? There are uncommon me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eors in the plane∣tary world. There are eccentrick bodies in the heavens, which chal∣lenge our amazement. There are females, enriched with an etherial spirit, which mounts up to its kindred skies. I wish not to de∣ny the fame of a Graham, the knowledge of a Carter, or to pluck one single, well earned laurel from the temples of a Seward. But prodigies of female genius do not prove at all, the <HI>general</HI> state of female talents, or the <HI>ordinary</HI> level of female understanding. I would ask, at the same time, whether, for one of these cultivated few, we have not thousands of an <HI>opposite</HI> description, unlettered and unread.</P>
<P>Besides, I am not arguing for these <HI>great</HI> attainments. I am only contending for that degree of cul∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e,

It is obvious to any discerning observer, that female lit∣erature, in this country, is swelled beyond its <HI>natural</HI> dimensions. To sit as judges upon literary produc∣tions, is intruding on the prerog∣ative of the other sex. I want not a <HI>plethora,</HI> but a sound and undis∣tended state of the female under∣standing; and if a woman had ev∣ery thing that glitters in knowl∣edge, or fascinates in taste, what comfort would she administer to the possessor of her person, if he could not rely on the tenderness of her friendship, and the <HI>sincerity</HI> of her affection? To trust graces with <HI>such</HI> women, is putting weapons into the hands of one, who is intoxicat∣ed or insane. To give the charms of knowledge, is only furnishing incentives for a speedier seduction. It is laying thorns under pillows,

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Essay is intended to be a philosophical theory of the progress of love, as unconnected with any particular religion, or indeed with any system of Revelation. In moulding this passion, moral causes will, doubtless, have their influence, but the physical will, generally, preponderate over all others.</NOTE> THAT the passions were implanted in us by the Deity, as the springs of all our actions, and are
<PB N="86" REF="028263_0085_0FD7F8D7DC82A520"/>therefore, in a certain degree, in∣nocent and lawful, is too obvious a doctrine, in the theory of mor∣als, to need any illustration.</P>
<P>Amongst these passions, the love of the other sex is infinitely the strongest and the most universal; and by operating at a time of life, when the character and habits are most essentially affected, has given rise to the greatest revolutions in society, and to some of the most extraordinary incidents of common life.</P>
<P>To touch upon the subject of love, is gliding with an electrick force and quickness, into every bosom. The description of it ne∣ver fails to create an <HI>universal</HI> in∣terest, or to arrest the general at∣tention,
<PB N="87" REF="028263_0086_0FD7F88089A05B00"/>whether we read its prog∣ress, its adventures and its revolu∣tions in the sublime and dignified language of history, in the pather∣ick tragedy, in the visionary novel, or hear it only <HI>glanced</HI> at in the casy and familiar play of social conversation. To the old, it re∣calls, in an agreeable manner, ear∣ly glowing fondnesses, and early scenes, which the chilliness of years, only, now, permits Imagin∣ation to enjoy; whilst younger people with a rapture, that thrills on all their finest sensibilities, apply the picture, thus gratefully exhib∣ited, to the nearest and the dearest favourite of their hearts.</P>
<P>Love, like all other passions, has suffered in the wrong opinions, and the perverse representations of different men. Libertines have degraded it into downright bru∣tality,

<P>Nothing but a sound and com∣prehensive philosophy, grounded on the principles of nature and of truth, will ever stand the test of experience, or of a critical inves∣tigation. All other notions of this passion, not founded in such philosophy, will quickly disappear with the authors, who abet them. The frothy bubble bursts, as soon as it is handled. The cobweb system is deranged by the touch of life. Love is a passion, not to be <HI>cradi∣cated,</HI> but only to be properly reg∣ulated and controuled. And it will always rage with a violence in

Priestcraft and fa∣naticism may appear to have total∣ly extinguished the flame; but the embers will revive with the first gale of opportunity, and the fire will consume happiness and morals.</P>
<P>This passion of love will always receive its particular form and <HI>modification</HI> from the peculiar cir∣cumstances of rudeness or civil∣ization, from the particular cli∣mate, government, religion and temperament of the people, a∣mongst whom it is found. The mode, in which love is considered, will always prescribe the method of treating women, who are the objects of it. The light, in which females are viewed, whether of respectability or degradation, will
<PB N="94" REF="028263_0093_0FD7F8EB02E545A0"/>produce their particular kind of <HI>education.</HI> Their education will principally form their character and manners; and, if we consider the strong and universal force of this passion, the manners and characters of women will have the strongest reciprocal influence on the pursuits and habits, on the complexion and the taste, on the private and the publick happiness of any people.</P>
<P>This sympathy for the other sex is then in its proper state of vig∣our and perfection, when, to that ardour of passion, which is direct∣ed to their persons, we join a ten∣derness of sentiment, which es∣teems them as companions, as formed to soften the sorrows and misfortunes, and to communicate a zest, an elevation and a poignan∣cy to all the real pleasures and
<PB N="95" REF="028263_0094_0FD7F88918EBA768"/>enjoyments of life.

<P>Such a rational and proper sen∣timent of women will not be the produce of every age, or of every situation. Many happy circum∣stances must <HI>concur</HI> to produce and cherish it.

<P>Whatever may be said of the sublime, moral sentiments contained in some plays, it is certain, that, on the whole, the representations of the stage are highly pernicious to the morals of young peb∣ple. Such sentiments, no doubt, are, <HI>occasionally,</HI> interspersed through them, but, in fact, serve on∣ly, as a specious sweet to gild over the <HI>poison,</HI> that lurks beneath. For it is not these <HI>sentiments,</HI> that give to plays the amazing interest they have over our hearts. Let any person endeavour to recollect the most serious and sentimental plays we have in our language, and he will find them, at the same time, to be the worst received of any others in the representation. And what is the reason? they have not so much of that <HI>love plot</HI> and denouement, they have not enough of that vivid colouring and appeal to the <HI>tender passions,</HI> which give these entertainments, particularly with young people, such inexpressible charms. Can it be pru∣dent to <HI>heighten</HI> passions, always of themselves sufficiently fervid, or to blow up flames, which already rage so powerfully, as to threaten the des∣truction of the house we live in?</P>
<P>Mr. Addison has justly said, that the stage, un∣der proper regulations, might be made an excel∣lent source of entertainment and instruction; but, if is was laid under such severe restrictions, as the chastity of this good man's taste would have pre∣scribed, there is reasson to apprehend, it would soon be deserted.</P>
<P>It is true that palys are purified from some of their former indecencies; and, that the publick, car would be shocked at indelicacies, which, <HI>once,</HI> it heard with the highest approbation. But this seems more an effect of refinement, than of virtue. we still can bear the <HI>sentiment,</HI> though we should blush at te expression; we love the im∣purity, if it comes but in a cleanly garb. Our taste, in short, has taught us to shudder at all <HI>vulgar</HI> things, (and indelicacy is in the number) whilst the prog∣ress of licentious passion and the history of in∣trigues, prove that our hearts are not less, but perhaps, more deeply, corrupted.

<PB N="102" REF="028263_0101_0FD7F8F692419968"/>the last convulsions of virtue, and smother the just expiring embers of female reserve. An enervated body in the sex cannot long resist this extraordinary ferment. An enfeebled mind will not have vig∣our to struggle with temptation. Marriage will be a burthensome, and intolerable restraint on a rov∣ing inclination. Inconstancy will
<PB N="103" REF="028263_0102_0FD7F8FE42D59DD0"/>be frequent, and divorces sued for as the only resource, however poor, and however disgraceful, from an unhappy connexion. A vagrant, ever restless appetite will pant for variety. Libertinism will erect its desolating standard on the ruins of delicacy; and, in the general per∣version of taste, chastity will be∣come an unfashionable virtue. Such have been most nations of antiq∣uity in a certain stage and progres∣sion of their empire.

<PB N="104" REF="028263_0103_0FD7F900E9449B10"/>composes that <HI>motley</HI> mixture of attention and neglect, of flattery and contempt, of hom∣age and of insult which we extend to the fair. For in fact, whatever a cold hearted politeness says, or the affectation of sensibility may pretend to feel, women in this country, by the majority of men, are considered but as instruments of vanity and pleasure. Our love is chiefly fashion, mixed with a con∣siderable portion of ingredient, which it would be improper and indelicate to name. The latter we gratify with those unhappy crea∣tures, whose ruined character re∣quires no reparation; and for the first, we shift attentions, in an end∣less rotation, with those more il∣lustrious names, whose fashiona∣bleness can give <HI>eclat</HI> and dignity to our choice, and whose fortune has propitiously placed them in a rank to resent our seductions. Our eulogies have no sincerity; our at∣tachments
<PB N="105" REF="028263_0104_0FD7F902949ED6D0"/>have no ardour, no con∣stancy, no zest; we seek a pleasure from the sex, but we do not find it, because it is not sought in the <HI>qual∣ities of the heart.</HI></P>
<P>What but this strange opinion of women, sanctified by fashion, and connived at by our penal laws, could have emboldened the worth∣less and puny libertine to boast of his triumphs over the innocence of a credulous and tender sex, whose honour it is certainly his business to guard, and whose delicacy to protect? What but the idea of a fashionable <HI>consequence</HI> annexed to intrigue, and of credit resulting from a multiplicity of amours, could have qualified, with any ac∣commodating softness, the natur∣al horrors, indecency and guilt of violating the marriage bed? What other cause could have effectually skreened either of these characters from the universal odium and in∣famy they deserve? And what else
<PB N="106" REF="028263_0105_0FD7F904822DD0C8"/>could have induced an injured and insulted sex <HI>particularly</HI> to caress these assassins of their peace, and to consider the number of seduc∣tions in a man, as so many scar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of glory, gained in the field of love, which entitled him to superior notice and distinction.</P>
<P>I need not stop, a moment, to en∣umerate the evils (for they occur∣red in the beginning of this essay) resulting from such a taste. An absolute dissolution, a weakening, or a total prevention of that union which is the very bond and cement of society; suspicion substituted in∣to the room of confidence, incon∣stancy of attachment; vague and criminal pleasures, which commu∣nicate disease, which hinder prop∣agation, and suppose a total absence of sentiment and esteem; a youth emaciated from early excesses, without principles, without consti∣tutions and without love, leave a nation nothing to expect but a race
<PB N="107" REF="028263_0106_0FD7F90689884EC0"/>of puny, spiritless creatures, ill pre∣pared to become the defenders of their country, and bearing, on their very characters and faces, every foreboding symptom of its ap∣proaching dissolution.</P>
<P>With this sentiment of women, we are cautious to give them a cor∣responding education. It is wholly turned on vanity and trifles, calcu∣lated only to embellish those per∣sons, which we wish to <HI>enjoy;</HI> to feed that vanity, over which we mean to triumph, and to observe that abjectness and inferiority of mind, which are favourable to op∣pression. Person and manner are the great object in the education of this sex. To render the one beau∣tiful, and the other enchanting, are our highest care. This in gen∣eral, is the employment of the gov∣erness. To this are devoted all the labours of the toilet. To this are consecrated their mornings, and their days. The consequence is,
<PB N="108" REF="028263_0107_0FD7F90956D96168"/>that they dazzle or inflame the sen∣ses, but convey no joy or relish to the heart. The <HI>artificial</HI> flower has no smell or essence! The paint∣ed <HI>statue</HI> has no soul or animation.</P>
<P>The company of women, what∣ever may be their taste, will always, in a greater or less degree, be court∣ed by the other sex. With the vain and fashionable, it has passed into a <HI>system,</HI> to devote a very consider∣able portion of his hours to the fair, and it is generally esteemed a nec∣essary step to politeness and the graces.</P>
<P>I shall not stop a moment to ex∣amine the truth or fallacy of this opinion. Suffice it to remark, that in this intercourse all young men <HI>indiscriminately,</HI> will endeavour to please. In order to be agreeable, they must have such qualities, as captivate the sex and converse up∣on subjects, in which they are in∣terested. What is this conversa∣tion?

<P>I am sensible, whilst I am writing these lines, that <HI>these</HI> attentions to virtuous women, are much on the decline. Our manners are so undomesti∣cated, and our morals so depraved, that the <HI>gener∣ality</HI> of youth seek only from women, those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cen∣tious favours, which it is in the power of any <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣male</HI> to confer; and, having found these, with unblushing effrontery, in the arms of the impure, they have no further taste or wishes for the <HI>united</HI> pleasures, which all the virtuous and accomplished of the sex could bestow, in delicacy of sentiment, in vivacity of manner, in confidence of friendship, or in ease, ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ety and sprigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liness of conversation.

<P>In this career of gallantry, much time must be spent, and, in that precious and important sea∣son of life, when the foundations of every thing <HI>great</HI> should be laid, when activity should be rous∣ed, when talents should be ripened, and when the thirst of glory should be felt, as the grand and stimulating movement of the foul. With men of finished gaiety, scarcely is a little <HI>life</HI> sufficient for the purpose. Attention and attachment must be varied and multiplied in an endless succession. This fair one must be forsaken, and another must be addressed.

<P>Nor is the loss of time the only disadvantage, arising from this system. The propensities it gives are unfavourable to every great and magnanimous exertion.</P>
<P>Young men become insensibly <HI>assimilated</HI> to the frivolousness they address, and affect to admire; and that frivolousness extends itself to all their habits and modes of thinking, to all their designs and all their undertakings, to all their actions and intercourse with the world. They get modes of levity, effeminacy and dissipation, which
<PB N="112" REF="028263_0111_0FD7F913DA203B80"/>are equally incompatible with the acquirement of science, or the laborious efforts of virtue. Their pursuits of every kind will be mark∣ed with this <HI>frivolity.</HI> The youth, which should be the glory of a nation, will become its reproach. Instead of climbing, with arduous labour, the sacred hill of virtue or of learning, they will endeavour to transform and <HI>remodify</HI> their nature, and take up with such im∣perfect fragments of both, as they are able to find in the bosom of pleasure, or the inglorious vale of indulgence.

We have <HI>very pretty</HI> preachers; we have <HI>amiable</HI> Senators; we have ve∣ry <HI>polite</HI> officers, and few great men. Consequences so malignant, and so comprehensive in their effects, deserve consideration. A disease, so interwoven with the vitals of the constitution, should not be neglected.</P>
<P>I have not enumerated half the evils of this fashion. If it pre∣vents many marriages, it robs those, which do exist, of all their sweetness and all their joys.</P>
<P>It is in retirement, that sensi∣ble minds look for real, <HI>heartfelt</HI> satisfaction. It is in women, as the friend and companion of that retirement, that selfish is exalted
<PB N="114" REF="028263_0113_0FD7F917AEF4C850"/>into social enjoyment, and that the sweets of friendship and the luxury of confidence leave us nothing to desire but their stabil∣ity and their duration. How does the most distant prospect of such a state, amidst the toils of la∣bour, the wrinkles of care, and the agonies of disappointment, charm the most elevated and pen∣etrating mind! How often has it administered courage to the hero, eloquence to the senator, and how equally do the monarch and the peasant court it, as a relaxation from their toils! The tender inter∣view of Hector with Andromache, immortalized by Homer, and the modest, timid shrinking Asty∣anax from his helmet, are plea∣sures which the purest virtue may acknowledge for her own, and which the greatest Scholars, Gen∣erals

<P>But let not fancy dream over all the bliss of such a scene, to be awakened only in disappointment. The <HI>present</HI> education of women blasts this prospect, and destroys such an hope. Sensible men, if they be determined to form this connexion, must do it <HI>often</HI> to a disadvantage.

<PB N="116" REF="028263_0115_0FD7DB30FB6DE1E8"/>frivolousness and insipidity, can∣not be agreeable. What is not agreeable, will not be lasting. The heart can feel no durable attach∣ment, where it knows no esteem. Without the secret concurrence of the heart, there cannot be en∣joyment. Marriage is nothing more than a bare, ceremonious union of hands. This seeming paradise of sweets, will roughen, as we approach it, into a wilder∣ness of thorns. The senses are soon palled. Disgust succeeds to satiety, quarrels to disgust, where the soul has no fresh graces to ex∣pand, and there remain no new and unexplored treasures in the understanding.</P>
<P>Though this subject is of so immense a magnitude, and so in∣timately connected with the first and dearest interests of society, as
<PB N="117" REF="028263_0116_0FD7F929D5DF78D8"/>to deserve the attention of any monarch or legislator in the world, yet, in a free and opulent coun∣try like our own, where education cannot be made a publick concern, and where any particular edicts of a prince would be esteemed a gross infringement on the liberty of the subject, it is only in the power of parents or guardians to remove or palliate so malignant an evil. If there be a <HI>specifick,</HI> it is a better and a more rational education of women; and, if that education is to be better and more <HI>rational,</HI> it must not be left to a vain, a su∣perficial or mercenary governess, but planned by the wisdom, and executed by the zeal and affection of those mothers, who under prov∣idence, have given them existence.</P>
<P>If we consider the exquisite plea∣sure, which Nature has annexed, in every creature, to an early care
<PB N="118" REF="028263_0117_0FD7F92B173D5F10"/>and protection of his offspring, it is amazing that they, who are dig∣nified with the human form and the privilege of understanding, should form the only melancholy exception, by appearing wholly insensible to, or not shiving to enjoy it; that woman who lays claim to an exquisite sensibility, can tamely give her child, from the moment of its birth, into the bosom of an illiberal, low, or per∣haps, a <HI>diseased</HI> nurse, to imbibe at once in her corrupted milk, the unhappy peculiarities of her mind and constitution! But how much more wonderful is it, and melancholy still, that she can be contented with barely affording existence to a girl, and afterwards resign her to the frippery, the pride and nonsense of a publick school, regardless of her early mor∣als
<PB N="119" REF="028263_0118_0FD7F92D000C8320"/>and impressions, whilst she is seeking for herself an <HI>artificial</HI> en∣joyment in the glitter of gaiety, in the tumult of pleasure, or the in∣toxicating fumes of publick admi∣ration.</P>
<P>Though fashion may sanctify such a scandalous inattention, and she may limit the horizon of good and evil, of virtue and of vice by the applauses or the censures, by the customs and extravagancies of a licentious age, yet the moment is at hand, when she must think that a daughter, stepping into a world of seduction and of snares, needed every salutary caution, and every prudent admonition; that a woman formed to be the mistress of a family, should have had her accomplishments mixed with <HI>sub∣stantial qualities</HI> and <HI>domestick at∣tention;</HI> that a woman exposed,
<PB N="120" REF="028263_0119_0FD7F930DAC3F590"/>from the nature of her sex, to fre∣quent sicknesses, sorrows and mis∣fortunes, would have wanted a powerful balm of religion to alle∣viate and heal; that woman form∣ed to be a help meet for the man, the partaker of his fortune, as the sharer of his bed, should have cul∣tivated an ability for rational knowledge and amusing conver∣sation; and (what is the highest consideration of all) that a woman, born for an eternal existence, born for the society of glorified spirits, and the enjoyments of God in a future existence, should certainly have received some more interest∣ing lectures than the graces of manner, the fluctuations of fash∣ion, or the trifling, and empty study of elegance or admiration.</P>
<P>If a mother can think that there is not only an unnatural indecen∣cy,
<PB N="121" REF="028263_0120_0FD7F933D4980C88"/>but even the highest criminal∣ity in the neglect of such instruc∣tion, she has yet to learn what are the first, initiatory principles of nature and of virtue, and perhaps her awakened conscience may teach them at a time, when, her beauty being shrivelled with the wrinkles of age, there is no syren voice of flattery to bewitch, and repetition has made all the circle of her pleasures too stale to amuse!</P>
<P>Why indeed had woman her existence but to dignify and enno∣ble it by such superior employ∣ments? When doe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she appear to so much advantage, as when, sur∣rounded, in her nursery, by a train of pratlers, she is holding forth the moral page for the in∣struction of one, and pouring out the milk of health to invigorate the frame and constitution of
<PB N="122" REF="028263_0121_0FD7F9340B2BB9D8"/>another? When is her snowy bos∣om half so serence, or when thrills it with such an innocent and pleas∣ing rapture, as in these silent mo∣ments of domestick attention, or these attitudes of undissembled love? What painter, wandering, with a creative fancy over all the exhaustless riches of nature, can give us so enchanting and delight∣ful a picture in so elegant a frame? What pleasures of the <HI>Levee,</HI> the Drawing Room, or <HI>masquerade</HI> can vie, in flavour with these more retired, maternal satisfactions? And when can woman ever be said to consult the real dignity and happiness of her sex, but when she is thus conscientiously discharging her duty to the man, to whom she has plighted, at the altar of her God, her vows and her affections?</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="028263_0122_0FD7F934D5AAD448"/>
Such maternal culture, such a revolution in the sentiments and conduct of that sex, would be at∣tended with the happiest advanta∣ges. An alteration would soon be visible on the face of society.</P>
<P>If the minds of women were placed upon solid objects, by a ju∣dicious and early culture, they would become at once the orna∣ment and blessing, as <HI>now</HI> there is but too much reason to apprehend, that they are only the bane and corrupters of society. Their charms would be the stimulating prize of valour, merit, and un∣derstanding. Their conversation would be a soft, but powerful spur to every noble action; and, in the intervals, which would be <HI>then</HI> de∣voted to their company, the soul would be acquiring an elasticity
<PB N="124" REF="028263_0123_0FD7F942B238B468"/>and a vigour for every great and dignified undertaking.</P>
<P>Little do women know of their own <HI>real</HI> interests, if they do not think themselves essentially inter∣ested in such a revolution. They would <HI>then</HI> be approached with es∣teem and veneration. The froth∣iness of compliment would, grad∣ually, be changed into the language of truth. Their empire over our hearts, then, founded on the im∣mutable qualities of the mind, would be glorious and permanent, not subject to expire in the wrin∣kles of age, or wither with the transient roses of beauty. Their conversation would give chearful∣ness and delicacy of sentiment; and ours would give instruction. There would be a gentle conflict and emulation of talents, and both parties would be mutually
<PB N="125" REF="028263_0124_0FD7F944632F9D38"/>improved by the mutual collision. Their friendship would be courted, and our <HI>morals</HI> would be improved. In the refinement of our taste, we should disdain to stoop for pleas∣ure to an <HI>harlot;</HI> we should look for <HI>real</HI> enjoyment with women, who had <HI>sentiment and understand∣ing.</HI></P>
<P>We should <HI>dare</HI> to converse up∣on <HI>rational</HI> subjects, and they would listen with attention. They would not expect that extrava∣gant homage, which steals our time, as well as our attention from elevated pursuits. They would incite us to great and noble at∣chievments in the senate or the camp, in science and the arts; and their glory would consist (as it always should) in sharing our distinctions. The <HI>petit maitre</HI> would dwindle into his native in∣significance.
<PB N="126" REF="028263_0125_0FD7F9455DFFCB58"/>Without qualities to procure the esteem of one sex, this poor, <HI>amphibious</HI> animal would justly become the derision of the other. Marriage would be more frequent, inviolate and sacred, not checked by extravagance, not dis∣graced with infidelity or poisoned with dissipation. <HI>Unimpaired</HI> con∣stitutions would produce a race of hardy and of healthy children, who, in time, might become the defenders of their country, and the pillars of a declining state. Women would attain to that <HI>gold∣en</HI> age, which I have been de∣scribing; and men, though not in paradise, would have delicious pleasures spread round their re∣tirements.</P>

<P>THE nature of my undertaking calls for some reflec∣tions on the quality, the degree
<PB N="128" REF="028263_0127_0FD7F948977E2CE8"/>and extent of female talents. And this will involve me in the hack∣neyed comparison, which has so frequently been made, betwixt the natural endowments and under∣standing of the different sexes—an enquiry, which though it has ag∣itated the curiosity, and employed the pens of so many ingenious writers, does not seem to have been pursued with that disinterestedness and candour, which had so much in contemplation the discovery of truth, as the supporting of a sys∣tem.</P>
<P>The talents of women have been degraded by some to an un∣reasonable ebb of feebleness and frivolity, and exalted by others to as <HI>unnatural</HI> an eminence of bril∣liancy and distinction. In the ages immediately succeeding those of Chivalry, it was <HI>fashionable</HI> to
<PB N="129" REF="028263_0128_0FD7F94A8EED0F68"/>speak of women, as of prodigies in science, and to decorate, with equally lavish encomiums, their understanding, and their charms. Nor was this taste confined merely to individuals. Even nations have been as<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See Feyjoo's vindication of women, translated from the Spanish, by J.

<P>Interest, policy, or fashion have continued what enthusiasm thus began.</P>
<P>Authors, who have wished to stand well with the sex, to lie up∣on the toilet, to be distinguished with their favours, and to acquire the reputation of gallantry and
<PB N="130" REF="028263_0129_0FD7F94FEFA8FD20"/>taste, have supported the same fulsome panygericks. A <HI>rational</HI> enquirer has only to observe, that, if such extraordinary women ever <HI>did</HI> exist, they were only a kind of phenomena in their horizon, and neither prove the <HI>general</HI> state of female talents nor the general su∣periority of female understanding. From the foot of an Hercules, there is no deducing the usual <HI>stat∣ure</HI> and proportions of a man. The <HI>Alps</HI> would give a most im∣proper idea of the common moun∣tains and scenery of nature.</P>
<P>Though I am privately convinc∣ed of the absurdity of this com∣parison betwixt talents of the sex∣es; though I conceive it to be more a matter of curiosity than use, more calculated to <HI>amuse</HI> or display ingenuity than to serve the cause of science or of truth, yet
<PB N="131" REF="028263_0130_0FD7F94FF1BFEA88"/>philosophers have condescended to enter into it with so much mi∣nuteness, and to enlarge upon it with so nice a discrimination, as to have rendered it a plausible, and to the <HI>general</HI> design of this work, something of a necessary and an essential investigation. They have dissected the peculiar <HI>organization</HI> of women to discov∣er the most latent stamina of tal∣ents, or the physical, unhappy causes which obstructed their ex∣istence. From the size, formation, temperature and quality of their brain,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arist. § 5. Quaest. 26. Macrob. Saturn. Lib. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> Aristotle, Almaricus, Malabranche, and many others have reasoned to their particular degree of capacity and understand∣ing; but whoever has read their observations must allow, that such
<PB N="132" REF="028263_0131_0FD7F95164507A70"/>a species of research is but labo∣rious trifling, from which no certain inferences can be drawn, and no solid or rational improve∣ments can be reaped.</P>
<P>It may be supposed with great probability and fairness, that their very outward frame is marked with a <HI>physical</HI> inferiority. It ap∣pears not to be calculated for such efforts of thinking, as the more abstracted sciences require, and which entail on the most ro∣bust constitution even of men, languor and disease. The delica∣cy of the everlasting pea, which so happily unites elegance with sweetness, would be easily oppress∣ed. The tender plant, which is refreshed with <HI>gentle</HI> gales, would be entirely overwhelmed or exter∣minated by a whirlwind. Provi∣dence always wise, and always be∣nevolent,
<PB N="133" REF="028263_0132_0FD7F95B37A38BA8"/>has adapted the frame and organization, to their bur∣dens.—Where robustess is deni∣ed, vigorous, and athletick exer∣cises are not expected.</P>
<P>Principles of <HI>analogy</HI> are favour∣able to my argument. Observa∣tions on the brute creation con∣firm it.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buffoon's Histoire Naturelle. Chap. concern∣ing the va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eties of human species.</NOTE> Amongst birds, beasts, in∣sects, animals in general, the males are observed to have greater strength, courage, vigour, and en∣terprize; females, superior beau∣ty of plumage, form, proportion, more delicacy and softness, but withal an higher degree of timidi∣ty and weakness. The great God of nature is thus uniform in <HI>all</HI> his plans and in all his operations. Superiority, for the sake of order
<PB N="134" REF="028263_0133_0FD7F95FEC949CE8"/>and protection, must be lodged <HI>somewhere.</HI> And it seems <HI>providen∣tially</HI> lodged in the <HI>males.</HI> But let us not take up with this presump∣tive reasoning. Let us rather have recourse to experience and facts.</P>
<P>There are but two points of view, from which we can see this subject, or pursue the comparison with fairness and precision. Cul∣ture makes so great a difference in favour of <HI>our</HI> sex, that, to discover the precise bounties of nature to each, we must compare a boy and girl at the age of six or seven; or we must look into some savage countries, where both are in their <HI>primitive</HI> state of rudeness without knowledge or instruction. At this age, in point of quickness, do∣cility and imitation, females may be pronounced to have the advan∣tage.
<PB N="135" REF="028263_0134_0FD7F962458E8FC8"/>But this is, by no means, any adequate proof of their <HI>general</HI> superiority. Possibly the profoun∣der thoughtfulness of the boy may obstruct the more brilliant and shewy exertions. It is not the most solid bodies, that <HI>sparkle</HI> most in collision. Gold does not glitter half so much as tinsel. The lour∣ing, <HI>heavy</HI> cloud involves more moisture, than is contained in the <HI>glistening</HI> dew drops of the morn∣ing.</P>
<P>The conceptions of a girl, in∣stantaneous as lightning, astonish and surprize. She interests us by the liveliness, with which she en∣ters into all our instructions. Her fancy gives a pleasing hue to every image she receives, and <HI>reflects</HI> it with advantage; nor does human life afford a more agreeable em∣ployment, than carefully to tend
<PB N="136" REF="028263_0135_0FD7F9636A2E3F90"/>the beauties of this opening flow∣er, and shew them in perfection. Pitiable is the mother, who knows not that such an office has sweets beyond the <HI>giddiness of pleasure,</HI> the incense of <HI>admiration</HI> and <HI>the essence of perfumes.</HI></P>
<P>At the same time, the very <HI>na∣ture</HI> of these qualities precludes that superiority of strong judg∣ment and of nice <HI>discrimination,</HI> which are the more peculiar pre∣rogative of men. Vivacity is un∣favourable to profound thinking and accurate investigation. And yet it is profound thinking and accurate investigation, which car∣ry all knowledge and all literary improvements to their zenith of perfection. Even men, who are gisted with a fine imagination, and the more <HI>lively</HI> talents, are fre∣quently observed to be, propor∣tionably,

Virgil had an exquisite tas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, but not equal originality. Milton, if we consider the peculiar difficulties of his subject, possessed both these fac∣ulties in a very wonderful degree of perfection. His imagination, however, predominated over the other. Shakespeare with his astonishing imagina∣tion, sometimes erred in judgement, but was it not by way of accommodation to the popular taste? The comparison, in point of genius, betwixt Cice∣ro and Demosthenes will, probably, lie in favour of the latter. He had more of that true aetherial fire, which peculiarly deserves the name, though the latter yields not to him in point of taste or correctness.
<P>Amongst the French, Rousseau had an ardent, but an ungoverned fancy: Originality was his <HI>forte,</HI> but its fallies were wonderfully wild and ex∣centrick. Voltaire, on the other hand, had more taste, than fancy. Ariosto's Imagination was su∣perior to his judgment. Tasso abounds with tinsel, which wants the pruning assistance of a sober judg∣ment, and a corrected taste. Though the philos∣ophy of Sir Isaac Newton had been previously sketched out by the all comprehensive mind of Ba∣con, still he made such amazing improvements in it, as to be entitled to the praise of a first rate genius, and certainly united both the essential qualities of the character in a stupendous degree. Mr. Locke's invention cannot be doubted, and lit∣tle censure, I think, can lie against his judgement.</P>
<P>Amongst painters, Correggio excelled more in colouring, than design; he had greater judgment, than imagination. Rubens, on the other hand, had more invention than judgement. Michael An∣gelo had great invention, but sometimes erred against propriety in taste. Raphael seems to have united all the distinguishing qualities of genius in his profession. But parallels would be endless, and these examples are only produced to shew, how rarely, even in the greatest men, these separ∣ate, and, seemingly, discordant excellencies are united.</P></NOTE> The
<PB N="138" REF="028263_0137_0FD7F96E010F58D8"/>union of a warm and a vigorous imagination, with a very sound and discriminating judgment, is rare indeed. Nature has confer∣red so <HI>rich</HI> a fortune on few of her children. Her favours are, in general, dispensed with a nicer equality, and with a <HI>seeming</HI> parsi∣mony, to individuals, that has

<P>Let us, however, look more <HI>nearly</HI> at the contrast. Women then have a more brilliant fancy, a quicker apprehension, and a more exquisite taste. When they apply these faculties to their pro∣per

<P>It may be said, that judgment is <HI>principally</HI> formed by compar∣ison and observation; and that the weakness of <HI>theirs</HI> arises from their want of opportunities to improve it; the reserve of their sex, their domestick duties, and sedentary life chiefly confining them to a very narrow circle,
<PB N="144" REF="028263_0143_0FD7F97D71332760"/>whilst business, ambition, curiosi∣ty or pleasure, lead us into the world, to see various countries, manners, customs; to hear in different coffee houses, clubs and societies the sentiments of all ranks and denominations of people, and to witness characters of every kind and magnitude, of every different shade and every opposite complex∣ion. This is all in some measure, true. Still it does not account for that <HI>original</HI> difference betwixt the intellects of man and woman, which is discoverable at an <HI>early</HI> period of life, for that palpable opposition of the <HI>thoughtful</HI> to the <HI>lively,</HI> of the <HI>firm</HI> to the <HI>delicate</HI> and of the <HI>profound</HI> to the <HI>chear∣ing,</HI> which nature seems <HI>industrious∣ly,</HI> to have made characteristick of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>

I would ask the warmest pane∣gyrist of women, whether he can fancy that there ever existed <HI>one</HI> in the world, who, with the utmost stretch and cultivation of her mind, could have pursued such a train of thinking as a Locke, could have combined with a Montes∣quieu, arranged like an Euclid, or scrutinized the secrets of nature like a Newton. It is true I have mentioned only <HI>prodigies</HI> of men. It is true that nature, by extraor∣dinary efforts in the production of such characters, seems to have exhausted, for a considerable time, all her riches and her powers. The question, likewise, it may be urged, will always be unfair, till women have enjoyed equal advantages, and been called forth, by similar encour∣agements, into literary greatness. But dropping all the subtil ties of
<PB N="146" REF="028263_0145_0FD7F9815327E288"/>argument, and reasoning only from what appear the <HI>original</HI> stamina in the minds of both, I conceive it to be a question, which every man's convictions and private ob∣servations will answer in the <HI>nega∣tive,</HI> whatever tenderness to the sex may lead him to <HI>affect,</HI> or del∣icacy to <HI>conceal.</HI></P>

<P>As to politicks, what were they, at any of the periods, when wo∣men
<PB N="151" REF="028263_0150_0FD7F9A495749978"/>have been celebrated for their political attainments? Were they not the petty interests of as petty a territory, whose views and wants terminated chiefly in itself, with∣out looking into any other quar∣ter of the globe? Did they ever require that universal penetration, that comprehensiveness of research, that stretch and vigour of thought, that wonderful combination of schemes and ideas, that retrospec∣tion and anticipation, that bringing past and present into one common point of view, which the immense, diffusive, complicated concerns of large, extended kingdoms, at the <HI>present</HI> period, and in the <HI>modern</HI> cir∣cumstances of Europe, absolutely demand? It will follow from the observations, likewise, that have been already made in this essay, that women are not calculated to
<PB N="152" REF="028263_0151_0FD7F9A615CF86D0"/>preside over kingdoms. They were not formed to hold the reins of empire, to penetrate into the views and wants, or adjust the various and complicated interests of conflicting states.

<P>Nor let the sex suppose me their accuser or their foe. If I have not wholly <HI>mistaken</HI> the method, I mean to be their advocate and friend. I have left them the seeds of every thing, that pleases and
<PB N="154" REF="028263_0153_0FD7F9B0EC63FBB0"/>captivates in woman. <HI>Their</HI> brows were not intended to be plough∣ed with wrinkles, nor their inno∣cent gaiety damped by abstraction. They were perpetually to please, and perpetually to enliven. If we were to plan the edifice, they were to furnish the <HI>embellishments.</HI> If we were to lay out and cultivate the garden, they were beautifully to <HI>fringe</HI> its borders with flowers, and fill it with perfume. If we were destined to superintend the <HI>man∣agement</HI> of kingdoms, they were to be the fairest <HI>ornaments</HI> of those kingdoms, the embellishers of so∣ciety, and the sweeteners of life.</P>
<P>If we consult scripture, we shall discover, that such was the origin∣al <HI>intention</HI> of heaven in the for∣mation of the sexes. The sen∣tence of subordination obviously
<PB N="155" REF="028263_0154_0FD7F9C2EF1DD420"/>implies, that man should have the preeminence on subjects, that re∣quire extensive knowledge, cour∣age, strength, activity, talents or laborious application. Women were not formed for political em∣inence or literary refinement. The softness of their nature, the delicacy of their frame, the timid∣ity of their disposition and the modesty of their sex, absolutely disqualify them for such difficul∣ties and exertions. Their destiny of bearing and nursing children, the necessity of superintending do∣mestick concerns, and the pecu∣liar diseases, to which they are li∣able, leave them little time for such publick undertakings, whilst the humble offices in which they are engaged, confer a blessing and a benefit upon society, that are in∣finitely beyond the <HI>coldness</HI> of
<PB N="156" REF="028263_0155_0FD7F9C799F97D88"/>knowledge, and the <HI>apathy</HI> of spec∣ulation. The wife, the mother and the oeconomist of a family would unfortunately, be lost in the literary pedant; the order of nature would be totally reversed, and the population of the globe preposterously sacrificed to the cold, <HI>forbidding</HI> pride of a studious virginity. The woman of the cloister would grant the graces of a citizen of the world. In that ardour of understanding, which rouses emulation, she would lose that soothing manner, which con∣ciliates and endears. The world would be deprived of its fairest or∣naments, life of its highest zest, and man of that gentle bosom, on which he can <HI>recline</HI> amidst the toils of labour, and the agonies of disappointment.</P>

So far as the qualities of the <HI>heart</HI> are concerned (and this has, sometimes formed a part of the question) I think the sexes will not bear a comparison.

<P>In the list, which Scripture has given us of converts to Christian∣ity, in the very early ages, we meet with holy women, not a few,
<PB N="158" REF="028263_0157_0FD7F9CB66FDC408"/>The fathers of the Romish church maintained an opinion, which was borrowed, no doubt, from close observation, that the number of <HI>glorified</HI> females in heaven, would exceed that of men; and monas∣teries can produce their <HI>thousands</HI> of this sex, who, impelled by a holy, though misguided zeal, have sacrificed beauty, fortune, friends; every thing that could <HI>charm</HI> and every thing that could engage, for the loneliness of a convent and the rigid austerities of a <HI>perpetual</HI> de∣votion!</P>
<P>It has been said that women are more <HI>artful,</HI> and fond of subter∣fuge than the men, and perhaps there may be some degree of jus∣tice and authenticity in the obser∣vation. But does not this arise from the just and necessary jeal∣ousy
<PB N="159" REF="028263_0158_0FD7F9CC5BC2E348"/>they entertain of the other sex, and from the cruel task we impose upon them, of not know∣ing whether in the guise of a friend they may not meet with a betray∣er and a foe? If a woman has not reserve upon <HI>many</HI> occasions, we criminate and despise her; if she <HI>has,</HI> we load it with the odious name of artifice and dissimulation. In so rigorous a system, we do not leave her the <HI>possibility</HI> of escaping without censure. Either she is called a <HI>prudish</HI> hypocrite, or she is called <HI>indiscreet.</HI></P>
<P>If we carry our researches through the whole creation, we shall find, that, as any creature is deficient in strength, it is always furnished with a proportionate share of art and contrivance; and a little more reflection will serve to convince us, that such is the
<PB N="160" REF="028263_0159_0FD7F9CDCFC7B028"/>all wise appointment of the Deity, and that these <HI>inferior</HI> qualities are absolutely necessary to its ex∣istence and preservation.</P>
<P>In the intercourse of Love, which forms an essential part in the history of this sex, how pow∣erfully do they eclipse our own, and wrest the palm of triumph from the men! If a woman has <HI>once</HI> a proper confidence in a man's sincerity, how generous is her breast! How noble is her conduct! How undisguised and unbosom∣ed her soul! How tender is her friendship! How ardent and how immoveable is her affection! The love of man, in general, has many <HI>foreign</HI> ingredients of selfishness or vanity in its composition. He <HI>af∣fects</HI> to love (perhaps, persuades himself he loves) a woman, whose connexions, beauty, fashionable∣ness,
<PB N="161" REF="028263_0160_0FD7F9CFA3BC9328"/><HI>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lat,</HI> do honour to his choice, or whose fortune gives the widest range to his hopes, or opens the most unlimited prospects to his ambition. If a <HI>woman</HI> loves, it is the <HI>men</HI> himself. She has but this <HI>one</HI> object in view, and it <HI>en∣grosses</HI> her soul. Pride, ambition, vanity, dissolve into tenderness, and are humbled by the passion. She risks friends, character, for∣tune, ease, for the sake of her <HI>idol.</HI> In <HI>privacy,</HI> she broods over the be∣loved image, and if mentioned in <HI>publick,</HI> she tinges it with blushes. This man is become her <HI>Universe;</HI> for him <HI>alone</HI> she lives; with him she would <HI>die!</HI></P>
<P>Let this favourite be called by business or pleasure into some for∣eign country, her days are melan∣choly, her nights without sleep!
<PB N="162" REF="028263_0161_0FD7F9D3E479B908"/>Life is insipid, and her soul has no joy! Her fancy conjures up a thousand apprehensions. In her <HI>few,</HI> slumbering moments she dreams of his danger, and she starts, at once from thought and repose! Every billow is his grave! Every traveller is besmeared with the blood of the endeared absent! How despicable is the villain, who can betray so much fondness; how insensible is the soul, that can laugh at so much tenderness; and how execrable is that fash∣ion, which substitutes, in its place, the windings of art and the cold∣ness of affectation!</P>
<P>At the same time, if the merit of virtue is to be estimated (as it always should) from the strength or the weakness of the determin∣ing <HI>motives,</HI> how much superior is
<PB N="163" REF="028263_0162_0FD7F9D48FC80DE8"/>woman's! The love of fame, rich∣es, honour, consequence, give birth to almost all great atchievements that distinguish our own sex. If a man be celebrated for valour, science, enterprize, he is received into all companies with eulogies. His <HI>Sovereign</HI> applauds. <HI>Theatres</HI> welcome him with bursts of admi∣ration. In the countenance of his admiring friends, he continu∣ally reads his glory and his great∣ness; and, when he dies, <HI>history</HI> sheds over his unperishable mem∣ory, an <HI>immortal</HI> perfume.</P>
<P>Not so with women. <HI>Their</HI> virtues, exercised in <HI>solitude</HI> and springing purely from the <HI>heart,</HI> make no noise, and court no obser∣vation. Lavished chiefly on their children and their friends, they blaze not on the world, nor are
<PB N="164" REF="028263_0163_0FD7F9DF9ECFF080"/>they thought of dignity or conse∣quence enough to embellish the recording page.</P>
<P>Still let not these degrading fair ones despond. Let them not com∣plain of their humiliating lot. Whilst virtue, taste, sensibility or discernment remain in the world, they will always have a high de∣gree of influence and respect. Their rank, though subordinate, is not unimportant. The services they do to society, though not trumpeted by fame, are recorded by gratitude, and graven on the heart; and they share in the hon∣our and distinctions of the men. Their influence often lends con∣siderable aids in the formation of those characters, which history distinguishes with its undying honours. Many are the heroes

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HOW far a publick or a private education is most to be preferred, is an enquiry, that has
<PB N="168" REF="028263_0167_0FD7F9E68E4E8578"/>agitated the curiosity, and employ∣ed the pens of many distinguished writers both of ancient and mod∣ern times. From the days of Quintilian to the present moment, plausible things have been frequent∣ly advanced in favour of both, and attacked with as many and forcible objections. Some, indeed, seem to have undertaken the sub∣ject only from a partial, selfish principle of recommending the plan, which was best accommoda∣ted to their own private interests or peculiar situation, and notwith∣standing the various theories, that have prevailed, the general opin∣ion seems considerably unfixed; at least, both schemes are <HI>indiscrimi∣nately</HI> adopted, as other, collateral circumstances of fortune, conve∣nience, connexion or accident in∣fluence and direct.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="028263_0168_0FD7F9E8D426E7B0"/>
Without entering at all into the <HI>detail</HI> of the argument, or attempt∣ing to appreciate the separate mer∣its of the different reasoners, a sensible mind forms this conclu∣sion, that a private education is more favourable to <HI>morals,</HI> that young people at least, should nev∣er be trusted to the dangerous in∣fection of publick schools, till principles and even <HI>habits</HI> of vir∣tue have had time to <HI>take ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> but that neither a private, nor publick, but an education uniting, in some degree, the advantages of <HI>both,</HI> is most eligible for those, who wish their children to be, at once, pos∣sessed of talents and of virtues.</P>
<P>But every thing, in fact, that can be offered on this subject, will be only vain or amusing <HI>speculation,</HI> till the nation is disposed to be

<P>Whilst an exorbitant profusion, and extravagance of expense, in almost all other cases, characterize the kingdom, the education of children, though an object of the highest, <HI>private</HI> and <HI>national</HI> im∣portance, is an article, which we treat with the most <HI>abject</HI> and ill judged parsimony, except only, in those circumstances which re∣late to <HI>frivolousness, accomplishments</HI> or conceit, to a dancing, a musick, or a fencing master, who are to teach them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I would not here be understood, as intending to throw a stigma on any of the pleasing qualities or accompli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hments.

In general, the youth at publick schools, attend <HI>too little</HI> to them; and, whether it arises from the ignorance and aukwardness of pre∣ceptors themselves, from so many boys being grouped together without any of the <HI>softer</HI> sex to temper their ferocity, from their being so whol∣ly swallowed up with the severer studies, that they have little leisure for mixing in good company, or from the notion of an <HI>effeminacy,</HI> annexed in all classick writers, to these <HI>little attentions</HI>—whatever be the cause, nothing is a more common sight, than the union of an excellent <HI>Classick,</HI> and a <HI>bash∣ful, aukward, or uncivil clown</HI> in the very same person. Such a spectacle degrades, dishonours and raises prejudices against learning; at the same time, graces are surely but an <HI>inferior</HI> and <HI>secondary</HI> consideration, whilst solid improvement, knowledge and virtue should always be the <HI>first.</HI></NOTE> <HI>graces,</HI> and initiate
<PB N="171" REF="028263_0170_0FD7F9EA557BADF8"/>them in all the <HI>petits</HI> trifles of fash∣ionable life.</P>
<P>Circumstanced as we are, pub∣lick schools are the only possible, <HI>general</HI> receptable for the educa∣tion of youth; and, as we pay the teachers, in order that a person may not starve by his profession, these seminaries must contain such numbers of young people, as it is impossible for him to tend with
<PB N="172" REF="028263_0171_0FD7F9EC8EC599D8"/>any adequate vigilance, so as either to know their <HI>dispositions</HI> or their <HI>talents,</HI> their virtues or their vices.</P>
<P>Hence men of any liberal sen∣timents, or any decent fortune will not submit to the <HI>humiliating</HI> task. Hence (excepting in a few publick schools, endowed by the munificence of our more virtuous ancestors, and requiring a gradu∣ate from the universities) masters, in general, are but poorly quali∣fied for the office they assume; and hence an employment, in itself the most elevated and honourable of all others, in its tendency the most useful and important to the state, in the eye of religion and of en∣lightened reason, requiring the strongest union of goodness and of talents, and, in the sounder policy of the ancients, devolving only on the most distinguished and
<PB N="173" REF="028263_0172_0FD7F9F660C3DCF8"/>unexceptionable characters, is sunk amongst the <HI>frivolous and dissipated</HI> moderns, into considera∣ble disrepute, whilst its professors intitled to the publick gratitude, generally meet with little but the publick contempt.</P>
<P>Let it not be said, that their <HI>manners</HI> have deserved it. Let it not be urged that their ignorance of life and customs, their rudeness, their pedantry, their carrying in∣to society the imperiousness of a school, and expecting indiscrim∣inately from the people they con∣verse with, the homage paid by pupils to their despotick throne, have been the real cause of such an odious stigma thrown upon their order. Though the con∣ducting of a school is not favour∣able to the temper or manners, yet a person of <HI>real</HI> education and
<PB N="174" REF="028263_0173_0FD7F9F7F274B7B0"/>good sense, will generally rise, in his intervals of relaxation, above such little disadvantages; but, if our <HI>avarice</HI> forces others, and of a lower cast, into this department it is our avarice, chiefly, that should be blamed for their foibles and defects.</P>
<P>With regard to women, I do not know that this famous ques∣tion about a publick or private education has ever been agitated. Indeed it is not necessary. Though such parents, as think of being generous and liberal, seldom fail to give them the first, yet the lat∣ter, in the estimate of sober reason, is certainly to be preferred; and, whatever elegant or high sounding schools may be sought out for a girl, yet a mother seems the only governess, intended by nature.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="028263_0174_0FD7F9F94DD1A4B8"/>
Three principal advantages of publick schools for boys are; 1st. That they cure a timid bashfulness, and establish a confidence, so nec∣essary for any publick character or employment; 2dly. That they ex∣cite a proper emulation by the collision of talents; and 3dly. That they foster early, lasting friend∣ships, sometimes of a powerful kind, which frequently lead the way to worldly honour and ad∣vancement.</P>
<P>The first of these effects will not, by a <HI>judicious</HI> friend, be recom∣mended to women. Confidence, in them, "is a horrid bore;" and let a silly fashion suggest what it will, their sweetest graces are the crimsoning <HI>blush</HI> and the retiring <HI>timidity.</HI></P>
<P>As to emulation, there are often children enough in their own fam∣ily,
<PB N="176" REF="028263_0175_0FD7F9FC8190F488"/>or in the circle of their near∣est acquaintance to communicate the spirit, so far as it is <HI>necessary</HI> or useful amongst those, who are not to hold the reins of govern∣ment, the offices of state, or the post of a commander, and who cannot aspire to sacred greatness in the honours of the purple.</P>
<P>The last effect is superseded, likewise, by the nature of their sex; as the grand promotion, of which <HI>they</HI> are capable, is a dig∣nified marriage, which their <HI>sister</HI> acquaintance are not capable of conferring; which a publick life is not likely to ensure, and which they will always have the greatest chance of forming to advantage, of they rather court the shade of a meritorious <HI>retirement,</HI> than the intoxicating notice of the <HI>publick eye.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="028263_0176_0FD7FA02773A13A8"/>
So far, therefore, from their receiving any solid <HI>advantages</HI> from this method of exposure, I conceive that it often subjects girls to numerous inconveniencies, dan∣gers and temptations, which their early age, and yet unripened vir∣tue are not always found sufficient to resist.</P>
<P>Thrown together in shoals, in∣to one common reservoir, at a <HI>dan∣gerous</HI> age, when nature bids an unusual fervour rise in their blood, when they feel themselves sprung into a new epoch of existence, ac∣tuated with similar feelings and similar desires, and when a restless leisure awakens all the powers of imagination and the senses, they insensibly convey an infection to each other by tales of <HI>sentiment, sympathy</HI> and <HI>friendship,</HI> and by various communications, schemes
<PB N="178" REF="028263_0177_0FD7FA059C6A1BE0"/>and artifices, which the vigilance of no governess is able to discover, nor her power to suppress. In the heat of imagination, her res∣traints are considered as but a <HI>prudish</HI> bar to the <HI>only solid hap∣piness in life;</HI> a connexion with the other sex. In the taste of a licen∣tious age, viewing passion, as a <HI>business;</HI> in the <HI>fervour</HI> of nature, feeling it as an instinct; and, in the inexperience of youth, fancy∣ing it a paradise, in which are no thorns, a country, whose land∣scapes are all real, as they are beau∣tiful, they behold an <HI>enemy</HI> in the woman, who restrains them, and have recourse to every private me∣thod of breaking through the chains, the despotism and formal∣ities of their temporary <HI>convents.</HI></P>
<P>Hence, from so many offensive breaths all pent up together, pro∣ceeds
<PB N="179" REF="028263_0178_0FD7FA07901923B8"/>a total putrefaction of the moral air. Hence swarms of no∣vels to inflame their fancy, and effectually to pave the way for their future seduction. Hence private correspondences, assigna∣tions and intrigue. Hence levity, giddiness and a total forfeiture of that delicacy and softness, with∣out which it is impossible for any woman to be lovely, or to secure the <HI>esteem,</HI> whilst she engages the <HI>partiality</HI> of an impassioned be∣holder.</P>
<P>If I have <HI>exaggerated</HI> in the des∣cription, let experience contradict me. If I have said the truth, the prejudices or the interests of par∣ticular individuals should not be regarded.</P>
<P>The qualities, which every man of real taste and sense wishes, par∣ticularly, to find in a woman, are
<PB N="180" REF="028263_0179_0FD7FA090D99F2E8"/>innocence, simplicity and domes∣tick worth. To these he would sacrifice all the <HI>fanciful</HI> accom∣plishments. They are to soothe his sorrows, they are to bless his mar∣riage and sweeten his retirement.</P>
<P>Boarding schools wholly coun∣teract these dispositions. They trample upon nature, and give us artificial creatures, artificial looks and artificial smiles. In their formal walls, airs, gestures, sylla∣bles, articulation, all are studied, and are sure to disgust. Like hot beds, they give a <HI>forwardness</HI> to fruits, but deprive them of their natural healthiness and flavour; and the <HI>fine ladies</HI> they send into the world, feel themselves ridicu∣lous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y exalted above (what they conceive to be) the <HI>groveling</HI> offi∣ces of family economy, or domes∣tick attentions.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="028263_0180_0FD7FA0AE2CB16D8"/>
If women wish to please, they should consider that nothing <HI>can</HI> please long, but the simplicity of nature; at the same time, it be∣hoves them to remember, that they were certainly born for some∣thing more <HI>important,</HI> and that when the short reign of their charms, shall expire, they will be able to procure a <HI>durable</HI> esteem by nothing but the solid qualities, and the domestick virtues. The mistress of a family is no longer a girl; and, if men are to distin∣guish themselves by business, or letters, by enterprize, or valour, females are surely called on, in their turn, by motives of gratitude and a dignified ambition, to im∣mortalize themselves, if possible, within their own walls, and to tend, with unremitting care and vigilance, the little tender pledges
<PB N="182" REF="028263_0181_0FD7FA0C17D9ED30"/>of their mutual affection. What says the wise man? "A good wo∣man looketh well to the ways of her household, and all her family is clothed in scarlet."</P>
<P>Whatever <HI>undomesticates</HI> a wo∣man, so far unmakes her, as to all the valuable purposes of her exist∣ence, and is at once the bane of her usefulness, her happiness and virtue. It rifles her of her ten∣derness, sensibility, delicacy and of all the sweetest of her vir∣tues and of her graces. It is <HI>un∣domesticated</HI> women, that poison the sources of our sweetest com∣forts. It is <HI>undomesticated</HI> women, that have houses without any order or arrangement, servants without discipline, and children, without instruction; that are friends, with∣out friendship, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> without con∣stancy, and parents, without af∣fection. And it is, I conceive, a
<PB N="183" REF="028263_0182_0FD7FA0F49A84270"/>publick education, which first in∣spires the rage for pleasure and dissi∣pation.</P>
<P>Almost every thing <HI>in</HI> and <HI>about</HI> these seminaries, has a tendency to corrupt the heart. What is it these fair pupils are taught to pant for? Admiration. What is proposed as the highest object, the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of all their endeav∣ours? Admiration. What are considered as the steps to it? El∣egant dress, appearance, equipage, wit, smartness, dancing, singing. In the mean time what becomes of the <HI>love of God,</HI> which Christian∣ity represents, as the <HI>first</HI> of duties? How little do they study the ex∣ample of their saviour, who was meek and lowly in heart? Where, all this while, is the mortification, and religious government of their passions, indifference to the world,
<PB N="184" REF="028263_0183_0FD7FA0F4C4C50C0"/>the discipline of their heart, thoughts, and imagination, mod∣esty, humility, heavenly minded∣ness, and all the lovely train of christian and evangelical graces? With <HI>such</HI> impressions, how vain and <HI>groveling</HI> must be the heart! How full of petty <HI>jealousies,</HI> and paltry <HI>competitions!</HI> How closed to all the nobler sentiments and <HI>affections,</HI> and how great a stran∣ger to any solid, or any perma∣nent repose!</P>
<P>Without unreasonably suspect∣ing the abilities of a governess, it is impossible she should attend to the prodigious number of young people she receives, so as to discov∣er their infinite varieties of talents or dispositions; and it may be presumed, from the nature of things, that she will not be often equal to the arduous undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="028263_0184_0FD7FA156FEE6A90"/>
It will be allowed me without controversy, that, in every educa∣tion, principles of <HI>religion</HI> and <HI>virtue</HI> should form the great and <HI>primary</HI> consideration. Without these, all other qualities and all other accomplishments are but a specious structure, raised on the sand, which must totter in the moment of sorrow and of trial. But, to instil these in the best and most effectual manner; to illus∣trate them with the most proper images and embellishments; to <HI>diversify</HI> her efforts according to the endless variety and taste of her fair pupils; to communicate her knowledge and virtue, in such a manner as to make them, al∣ways, seem a rose without a thorn, requires no ordinary talents and exertions.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="028263_0185_0FD7FA18EA0FA788"/>
To accomplish such an end, a governess, in the first place, should be a <HI>prodigy of virtue.</HI> Like char∣ity, "she should suffer long and be kind." She should deny herself pleasure, ease, slumber, <HI>ev∣ery thing</HI> for the sake of her ten∣der flock. She should love them, as her daughters, and consider herself engaged in the noble em∣ployment of training up so many angels for the skies.</P>
<P>She should have great know∣ledge, and that knowledge should be embellished with taste. It should appear, like the fair ones, to whom it is recommended, al∣ways <HI>lovely,</HI> and always <HI>inviting.</HI> She should know the best books, and she should be able to discrim∣inate and select the most <HI>striking</HI> and <HI>interesting</HI> passages for their instruction.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="028263_0186_0FD7FA1A51E3D968"/>
Her address, likewise, should be conspicuous above all her other qualities. She should be able to see the heart in all its foldings and recesses. She should know how to <HI>multiply</HI> and <HI>variegate</HI> herself, as exigencies require; here she should sooth, and there she should expostulate; here she should en∣deavour to affect by the spirited, and there by the pathetick; in one place, she should be gentle like the dew, in another, <HI>thunder, lightning</HI> and <HI>storms.</HI></P>
<P>It would display a great igno∣rance of human nature to suppose, that such a combination of great talents is frequently to be met with in <HI>any</HI> female; and it would argue a still higher degree of ab∣surdity and inexperience to expect them <HI>concentred</HI> in the character of such a one, as generally un∣dertakes
<PB N="188" REF="028263_0187_0FD7FA1C87BC06B8"/>this particular employ∣ment.</P>
<P>So little is the esteem, in which the character of <HI>Governess,</HI> like that of <HI>Schoolmaster,</HI> is held, and so inadequate are the rewards, conferred on these people, that the office, in the <HI>best</HI> point of view, will, very frequently, devolve upon those, who, having once seen bet∣ter days, but now fallen from their dignity, have contracted not a little of that despondency and <HI>sourness,</HI> which attend degradation; and, in the worst, will, as often be undertaken, as a last <HI>resource,</HI> by many, who are not famous for the <HI>liberality</HI> of their sentiments, as they have not been distinguished by that of their <HI>education.</HI> To expect that <HI>such</HI> women should be patterns, either of the <HI>graces</HI> or the <HI>virtues,</HI> would be hoping a∣gainst
<PB N="189" REF="028263_0188_0FD7FA1DA6739120"/>all the <HI>probabilities</HI> of things, and amusing ourselves with an airy and romantick shadow, that vanishes on the touch of experi∣ence and fact.</P>
<P>Nor do I conceive that Board∣ing Schools have such a tendency, as has generally been imagined, to give the so <HI>much valued</HI> excel∣lence of politeness.</P>
<P>Without ease, there can be no grace. Without grace, there can∣not be politeness. But these semi∣naries nurse a <HI>formality</HI> and <HI>stiff∣ness,</HI> and their seclusion and re∣straints like those of a college, are unfavourable to these attain∣ments. Whence springs polite∣ness, but from collision with a great variety of characters; from living in <HI>habits</HI> of genteel and <HI>mix∣ed</HI> society; from being frequent∣ly in the company of those, whom
<PB N="190" REF="028263_0189_0FD7FA215F1438F8"/>we look up to with a degree of deference, and feel ourselves in∣spired with the ambition to please? None of these circumstances <HI>gen∣erally</HI> exist in schools; and, if there was no other reason, either of the sexes living aloof, and sep∣arated from the other will always contract a number of peculiarities, ungraceful and unpleasing. But the <HI>great</HI> consideration, after all, is virtue. And <HI>female</HI> virtue ap∣pears a plant of too delicate a na∣ture, to bear this scorching meth∣od of exposure.</P>
<P>It will appear from the general complexion of these remarks, that they are designed, principally, to apply to people in the higher ranks of life. Amongst others, cases, doubtless, will occur, in which a publick school may have
<PB N="191" REF="028263_0190_0FD7FA2299671510"/>its advantages, and be the best re∣source.</P>
<P>In a flourishing, commercial country, like Great Britain, some parents will attain, from <HI>very low beginnings</HI> to so ample a fortune, as to wish their children a much better education, than they them∣selves have enjoyed, or are capable of imparting. And it will occur to every reflecting person, from the nature of the case, that, under <HI>their</HI> roofs, daughters might imbibe only a set of illiberal no∣tions, or a system of vulgar, purse∣proud superciliousness. To <HI>such,</HI> these seminaries, defective as they are, may have their uses and ad∣vantage.</P>
<P>The sentiments of <HI>such</HI> girls, as well as their manners, may <HI>here</HI> receive an elevation and refine∣ment. They may feel themselves
<PB N="192" REF="028263_0191_0FD7FA2DE33DAEC8"/>levelled, nay usefully humbled by the company of their superiors. Little mortifications beget humil∣ity, and little superiorities produce subordination. The <HI>Queen of the village</HI> may be stripped of her u∣surped plumes, and insensibly taught to treat those with respect, whom once she considered with scorn and aversion. But where mothers are themselves <HI>equal</HI> to the task (if a task it must be deem∣ed) there cannot be a doubt a∣bout the difference of advantage, as a matter of <HI>duty,</HI> if all the cas∣uists of Europe were consulted, they could not bring the shadow of an argument against it. No; reason, religion, the thrillings of affection, the voice of nature, and the voice of God, the interests of society, the happiness of private life, the honour, the dignity and
<PB N="193" REF="028263_0192_0FD7FA33F7ED69D0"/><HI>true policy</HI> of woman—all say, that a <HI>mother</HI> should be the <HI>preceptress</HI> of her children, and that such children would stand a chance of the happiest instruction. <Q>If well nurtured sons grow up as young plants, such daughters would be as polished corners of the temple.</Q></P>
