<HEAD>DETECTION OF A CONSPIRACY, FORMED BY THE <HI>UNITED IRISHMEN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I HAVE long thought, that the French have form¦ed a regular plan for organizing an active and effective force within these States; and I am persuaded, that after what I am now going to lay before the public shall have been read with attention, few people will be so blind as not to perceive, that my opinion was well founded. The Parisian Propagande have, in every country that they wished to ruin, found villains in abundance ready to engage in their service. The am∣bitious they have allured by the prospect of power, and the needy by that of pillage. In America there is less ambition and less poverty than in most other countries, and therefore, though some traitors have been found amongst them, the <HI>natives</HI> were not much to be relied on, in the prosecution of any design, evidently hostile to the interests and honour of their country. They might be deceived, they might be duped to lend their aid indirectly to some such design; but no man, who
<PB N="4" REF="048395_0003_10250641DA415BF8"/>
is led on in the dark, can be safely confided in; because, at the first dawn of light, it is a thousand to one but he makes his retreat.</P>
<P>The French seem to have been fully aware of this. Indeed, they learnt this truth from the mortifying defection of the AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES. There were many well-meaning men, who became members of these seditious meetings from ignorance, and who discovered no inconsiderable zeal in propa∣gating their principles; but, the bandage was torn from their eyes, and no sooner did they perceive the real views of DALLAS and the other leaders, than they turned their backs on them with detestation.</P>
<P>This lesson induced the French to exert their <HI>"diplomatic skill'</HI> in choosing instruments more fit for their purpose. Ignorance when allied with honesty was no tool for them to work with. Real, sincere, villainy, then without property, without principles, without country and without character; dark and des∣perate, unnatural and bloody-thirsty ruffins; these were what they wanted; and where could they have sought them with such certainty of success, as amongst that restless rebellious tribe, the emigrated UNITED IRISHMEN? The wretches known by this name, had escaped from their country to avoid a punishment justly due to their multitude of crimes. <HI>Here</HI> they expected to find an organized system of perpetual anarchy: the needy anticipated a life of laziness and plunder, the ambitious thought to grasp on power already moulded
<PB N="5" REF="048395_0004_10250645A262CBA0"/>
to their hands; they all counted upon a state of things, congenial to their own wicked dispositions.</P>
<P>Happily for us, they were deceived. They found a government, which, if too weak (like their own) to punish conspirators according to their deserts, was yet too sturdy to fall prostrate at their feet. They found property protected from their fraternizing clutches; they saw their hopes of political consequence vanish like a dream; and, instead of caresses, condolence and applause, from the people, they meet with the same virtuous abhorrence that had followed them from the shores of their native land.</P>
<P>Thus disappointed, thus mortified, thus humbled and disgraced, it was not to be wondered at, that they conceived a hatred against America equal to that which they entertained agaist their own country, and it is still less to be wondered at, that they enrolled them∣selves in the treacherous service of France.</P>
<P>The first I heard of the existence of a Society of United Irishmen <HI>here,</HI> was by a printed paper (a copy of which the reader will see by-and-bye dated the 18th December last, and signed Js. REYNOLDS. It was envelloped in a piece of paper addressed to me, and was left by an unknown hand, at the house of a person in Market-street. It was on the 16th of January that I received this paper, and in about three weeks afterwards, the <HI>plan</HI> of the conspiracy was conveyed to me through the same channel.</P>
<P>This <HI>plan,</HI> which is called a <HI>constitution,</HI> is printed in
<PB N="6" REF="048395_0005_1025064733B84BA0"/>
a small octavo pamphlet, bearing date the 8th of Au∣gust last. The imprint imports, that it was printed at Philadelphia, for the society; but the <HI>printer's name</HI> is very cautiously omitted. The person who enclosed me the pamphlet, has, indeed, written in the margin the name of a printer, who, from the villainous publi∣cations which have come from his press, I make no doubt was really the man; but this evidence is too weak for me to proceed upon in publishing his name to the world, as guilty of an offence, which amount to treason against the United States.—Here follows the <HI>plan</HI> of the <HI>conspiracy.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Six hundred years have past, since division and fraud reduced Ireland to colonial subserviency; the division of her people have ever since subjected them to the lash and to the good of a foreign tyranny; a tyranny more odious than Asiatic despotism.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In our day and generation we have seen and we have felt; it is not necessary, there is not now time cooly to count over the long black catalogue of her baleful wrongs; there is not now time to argue and complain.</HI> THIS IS THE TIME TO ACT; to act with energy we must act with union: Irishmen are united at home, we will not be disunited abroad.</P>
<P><HI>Our love for freedom has not been lessened by what we have experienced of its effects, or for Ireland by our dis∣tance.

<DIV3 TYPE="constitution">
<HEAD>UNDER THE NAME OF <HI>THE AMERICAN SOCIETY</HI> OF UNITED IRISHMEN, ADOPTING THE FOLLOWING <HI>CONSTITUTION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>[The declared intention of procuring <Q>equality and liberty to ALL men,</Q> is a clear proof Ireland alone was not in their view. But, as we go on, we shall perceive that neither that country nor its concerns are at all included in the objects of these people. The words <HI>Ireland, Irishmen,</HI> &amp;c. are mere substitutes for other words, like the cant of the pick-pockets, ac∣cording to which a <HI>hog</HI> means a <HI>shilling,</HI> a <HI>pig</HI> means a <HI>sixpence,</HI> and so on. This will clearly appear from the articles and TEST of the precious constitution.]</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 1. That ALL SUCH PERSONS and such only, shall be eligible to this Society of United Irishmen, as shall have suffered in the cause of freedom, or who, by their zeal for THE RIGHTS OF MAN∣KIND, shall have rendered themselves distinguished and worthy of attachment and trust.</P>
<P>[Thus, you see, it is not IRISHMEN alone, who are eligible to this Society; but ALL SUCH PER∣SONS as shall, according to their cant, have <HI>suffered in the cause of freedom,</HI> or have shown their zeal for <HI>the
<PB N="8" REF="048395_0007_1025064B58662B88"/>
rights of mankind!!</HI> In other words, every scoundrel, of whatever nation, is eligible, provided he has been manacled or transported, or has rendered himself wor∣thy of the gibbet, for some attempt at rebellion or some act of treason, no matter under what government or on what occasion; or, provided his seditious principles are so well known and established as to leave no room to doubt of his attachment to the cause. <HI>Americans,</HI> then, and <HI>Britons,</HI> and <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> and men of every coun∣try being eligible to the Society, can any one be silly enough to suppose, that the conspiracy had <HI>Ireland</HI> in view? What had any of these people to do with <HI>Ire∣land?</HI> But, on the absurdity of this we shall have time to remark by-and-by. Indeed, the TEST itself gives the lie to this cant about Ireland. All that it is neces∣sary to remak on this section, is, <HI>that it provides for the admission of every discontented, factious man in the Uni∣ted States:</HI> and that the latter part of it is no more than a copy of the qualification clause of the Jacobin Club at Paris, except that the latter required positive proof from every new member of his having <HI>actually committed some crime deserving the halter,</HI> while our li∣beral conspirators, thinking it unjust to exclude a vil∣lain merely because he has failled of success, are willing, in some cases, to admit the <HI>intention</HI> as equal in merit to the deed.]</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 2. That no person shall be proposed for ad∣mittance but by a member in his place.</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 3. That no proposition for the admittance of a member shall be received, unless it be seconded by
<PB N="9" REF="048395_0008_1025064E2564EBF8"/>
another member present, and that it shall likewise be necessary for the proposer and seconder, to vouch for the moral character and CIVISM of the person propos∣ed; in defect of which, no election shall take place.</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 4. Members shall have the privilege of pro∣posing, or seconding the proposal of candidates, in any Section, as well as that to which they belong.</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 5. A candidate proposed agreeable to the 2d, 3d, and 4th sections, shall not be ballotted for, until the next meeting after that in which he has been proposed, unless known to two-thirds of the members present, (two black beans to reject without a reason, and one with reasons), but, upon his election, he shall be immediately admitted, under the following forms:—</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 6. Before a person elected shall be consider∣ed a member, the President shall put to him the fol∣lowing questions; an affirmative to the 1st, 5th and 6th, and a negative answer to the 2d, 3d, and 4th, shall be indispensable to admission as such:</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 7. I. Do you believe a free form of govern∣ment, and uncontrouled opinion on all subjects, to be the common rights of all the human species.</P>
<P N="2">II. Do you think the people of Ireland are in pos∣session of these rights.</P>
<P N="3">III. Do you think the government of Great Bri∣tain ever was, or is now disposed, to acknowledge, or assent, to the freedom of Ireland.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Do you think Great Britain ought, of right, to govern Ireland.</P>
<P N="5">V. Are you willing to do all that in you lies to promote the emancipation of Ireland, and the esta∣blishment of a republican form of government there.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Are you willing to bind yourself, by a solemn <HI>obligation,</HI> to the principles you have acknowledged.</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 8. That upon the candidate answering these questions, as required by the sixth section, the fol∣lowing shall be administered as a test, all present stand∣ing:</P>

<P>I. A. B. <HI>in the presence of the</HI> SUPREME BEING <HI>do most solemnly swear, that</HI> I <HI>will, to the utmost of my

power, promote the emancipation of Ireland from the ty∣ranny of the British Government:—That I will use the like endeavours for encreasing, and perpetuating, the warmest affection among all religious denominations of men, and for the attainment of LIBERTY and EQUA∣LITY, TO MANKIND, IN WHATEVER NA∣TION I MAY RESIDE. Moreover, I do swear, that I will, as far as in me lies, promote the interest of this, and every other Society of United Irishmen, and of each of its members—and that I will never, from fear of punishment, or hope of reward, divulge any of its</HI> SE∣CRETS <HI>given to me as such.</HI></P>
</DIV1>

</TEXT></Q>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 8. That the TEST of this Society, the INTENTION of this INSTITUTION, (in all other respects than as a <HI>social body,</HI> attached to free∣dom,) be considered as SECRET AND INVIO∣LABLE in all cases, but between members, and in the body of the Society.</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 9. That nevertheless, a member of the So∣ciety shall not be considered as divulging its secrets, who shall propound to persons disposed to become mem∣bers, the sense of the six propositions which <HI>precede the test.</HI></P>
<P>[Here we see that Ireland is almost dropped out of sight. It is just mentioned in order to introduce the British government; but the initiated is to swear, that he will do the utmost of his power for the attainment of LIBERTY and EQUALITY, to MANKIND; and, these efforts does he swear to make, IN WHAT∣EVER NATION HE MAY RESIDE! Ireland, therefore, if not totally dismissed by the TEST, is no more contemplated by it than America is, taking the words in their literal sense: and we shall see in the se∣quel, that this blessed liberty and equality is entended for America alone.</P>
<P>The crimality of the purpose and end of the com∣bination
<PB N="11" REF="048395_0010_1025065469B09798"/>
is most amply proved by the section that im∣mediately follows the TEST.—<Q>The TEST of this society and the INTENTION of the institution shall be kept SECRET and INVIOLABLE.</Q>— The members may tell the world that it is a <Q><HI>social body,</HI> attached to freedom;</Q> that is, they may give out that its principles are friendly to general liberty; they may represent it as one of those collections of individuals that men of sense usually laugh at, but they must not say a word about the INTENTION of the institution, nor must they discover the nature of the OATH.</P>
<P>Now, if nothing more were meant than an associa∣tion against <HI>the government of Great Britain,</HI> which they must well know would excite contempt and ridi∣cule, why all this <HI>secrecy?</HI> Why conceal the nature of the oath? and, particularly, why conceal the <HI>intention</HI> of the institution?</P>
<P>By the 9th Section we see, that the discoveries, made even to those who offer themselves as members, are to extend no further than "the sense of the six propositions <HI>preceding</HI> the TEST." The Test itself they are to know nothing of, 'till they have gone too far to retreat, and then they are bound not to divulge what they have learnt. First the initiated member swears, that he <Q>will never, from <HI>fear of punishment,</HI> or <HI>hope of reward,</HI> divulge any of the <HI>secrets,</HI> given to him as such?</Q> and then the INTENTION of the institution is immediately given to him as one of those <HI>inviolable secrets!</HI> If there were nothing wicked,
<PB N="12" REF="048395_0011_10250656F9B0E7D8"/>
nothing highly criminal, nothing dark and traiterous in this INTENTION, why is the discovery of it thus guarded against? Men never <HI>"fear punishment"</HI> for concealing what is not criminal. Indeed, this TEST stamps the character of the combination: a Test of secrecy, as to the <HI>motives</HI> of the members, is essential to a conspiracy; and it is that which distinguishes this society from <HI>"a social body,"</HI> which is the character they wish to appear under in the eyes of the world.</P>
<P>Here again we perceive the plan to be little more than a copy of that of the Jacobin club in France. The <HI>Christian Religion</HI> is discarded, and the initiated wretch swears by the "SUPREME BEING." Next <HI>Liberty and Equality to mankind</HI> is the object, <HI>in whatever country they may reside;</HI> the world are to be told, that the society is merely a <HI>social body;</HI> but its real INTENTION is to be kept a secret under the most solemn injunctions. Thus proceeded the Jaco∣bins at Paris, that <HI>social body</HI> who overturned the government of France. PLAYFAIR says, they had <HI>two creeds,</HI> one to <HI>amuse the public,</HI> and another that, for long time, never was known but to the members.</P>
<P>The oath of secrecy necessarily forbids a communi∣cation of one of the pamphlets containing the TEST, &amp;c. the person who made this communication to me must, therefore, have broken his oath, or must have pur∣loined the pamphlet. I rather think the former; because had he not thus committed himself; were it not that he was ashamed to own himself one of the
<PB N="13" REF="048395_0012_102506589A5C7D48"/>
conspirators, and at the same time, incurred the odium of having betrayed his companions, it is pretty clear' that possessing an inclination to make the discovery' he would long ago have come forward as the instrument of an effectual prosecution. He tells me in a note which covered one of the papers, that he has <HI>found a clue</HI> to all their secrets, and, as I before observed▪ he writes down the name of the printer in the margin. This latter circumstance was enough; for, if the printing could be proved, or if it can be proved now, the printer at least, can be punished as a conspirator, and this may lead to a discovery of his employers.</P>
<P>Having thus remarked on the design of the con∣spirators, I should now come to the means provided for <HI>insuring its success,</HI> by which the reader will at least see the extent of the plan, and will be fully con∣vinced that its real object is the destruction of the Ame∣rican Government.]</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 10. The member thus initiated shall subscribe his name to the constitution, and pay to the treasurer, half a dollar.</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 11. The monthly subscription of each mem∣ber shall be a quarter of a dollar; payable on the first meeting in every month: if the member be elected af∣ter the twentieth of any month, he shall pay no more than his fee of initiation for that month.</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 12. If any member neglect to pay the res∣pective sums before mentioned, for the space of three months, the secretary of his section shall then signify, in writing to the member, the amount of the arrears, and demand payment, and that in default thereof, his name and the sum due, shall be publicly read by the treasurer of the section to which he may belong, on
<PB N="14" REF="048395_0013_1025065D2179C748"/>
the three next succeeding meetings thereof, and if his arrears be not paid on the third reading, he shall be ex∣cluded the Society. But excluded members, upon paying all arrears due, and the usual contributions that were payable during his exclusion, may apply for ad∣mission, agreeable to the usual form, Provided, never∣theless, that this rule shall not extend to such mem∣bers as shall declare their inability to pay, in reply to the secretary, in an authentic form, and where local circumstances may render their attendance impossible, or highly inconvenient.</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 13. Any person elected by ballot, who shall not attend three successive meetings after his election, shall forfeit it, unless due cause be shewn to the proper section for his absence.</P>

<P><HI>Section</HI> 12. Every officer, and every member of a committee, is responsible to the body by whom he was elected, and liable to any punishment they may, on account of delinquency, inflict.</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 13. No person shall be eligible to hold two offices within his respective section.</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 14. That when the State Committees, or the General Executive Committee, or a majority of the sections recommend a revision of the preceding constitution, it shall take place.</P>
<P>[Now, leaving the mere formalities and other tri∣fling things aside, let us take this plan and look at it in its substance. It is very properly called an <HI>"en∣larged organization,"</HI> for it embraces an extent no less than that of the whole Union.</P>
<P>First, we see, that every restless wretch, of whatever nation, is admitted into any section of the society,
<PB N="19" REF="048395_0018_102506694FC59900"/>
and has his name, place of residence, &amp;c. enrolled on its list; but, lest the assemblages should become un∣wieldly, or alarming to the magistrates, these sections when they get to a certain strength, separate, and the detached parts form new ones, just as bees swarm when the hive is over-crowded — The troops being thus enrolled in the sections, the next thing is to render them manageable. Were the sections subjected to no superior command; were they to remain scattered over the country without any common head, they would be like so many independent companies without a com∣mander. But, these troops have not been raised to <HI>lie in idleness,</HI> and, therefore, a mode of uniting their efforts is provided. The sections in every state are to send delegates to form a <HI>State-Committee;</HI> and these sixteen State-Committees are to send delegates to form a <HI>"General EXECUTIVE Committee;"</HI> and this is the whole brought to one point.</P>
<P>So much for the organization. Now for the ope∣rative part of the plan.</P>
<P><HI>"The General</HI> EXECUTIVE <HI>Committee"</HI> (which, I have not the least doubt, is now sitting in Philadelphia) keeps up a constant communication with the State-Committees, and from it, the whole Society, or rather <HI>army,</HI> receives "directions" when and how to act. It has returns made to it of the numbers enrolled in each State, of the names, residence, and occupation, of the persons enrolled; by this mean it is at all times in∣formed of its strength, and of where that strength lies.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="048395_0019_1025066B20D3F228" MS="y"/>When it is necessary TO ACT, the General <HI>Exe∣cutive</HI> Committee are to dispatch their orders to the State Committees; these to their sections, and these a∣gain (by their committee of <HI>secrecy</HI>) to their <HI>sub-sections.</HI> Here the orders reach the <HI>active troops,</HI> and that there may be no confusion in their movements, these <HI>sub-sections</HI> consist of only <HI>eight</HI> men each, all <HI>living near one another,</HI> and one of these eight is a sort of non-commission officer, who (to use the very words of the conspirators) is to "have the <HI>charge</HI> of the other seven, and is to WARN them IN CASES OF UR∣GENCY"!!!</P>
<P>Now, I appeal to any man of common sense, whe∣ther this infernal combination can possibly have any other object in view than an insurrection against the government of America. What <HI>"cases of urgency"</HI> can arise <HI>in this country,</HI> what opportunity can offer it∣self <HI>here,</HI> for <HI>overturning the British Government in Ire∣land?</HI> Were the villains, indeed furnished with <HI>wings;</HI> could they like other birds of passage, assemble in a flock and take their flight to Ireland; then the ostensi∣ble motive of the association would have something like plausibility about it; but, as they are, this ostensible motive is a palpable absurdity, a mere trick which has been invented in order to inveigh ignorant persons to take the TEST, and, in case of detection, to avoid the punishment which the law awards to <HI>traitors</HI> and <HI>spies;</HI> or at least, to leave room for doubt and conten∣tion in the courts of justice; a bad chance being bet∣ter
<PB N="21" REF="048395_0020_102506700377B5E8"/>
than none, and ten years imprisonment being better than death.</P>
<P>That this conspiracy is intended <HI>to aid the cause of France,</HI> it is hardly necessary to insist on; every one must perceive it at the first glance.—What can these ragged russians expect to do <HI>alone?</HI> How can they alone support their current expences, exclusive of <HI>"cases of urgency,"</HI> of arms, ammunition, &amp;c. &amp;c. By an attention to the financical part of their plan, you will perceive, that the money they collect from the members is barely sufficient to defray the charges which must necessarily be incurred for rooms to meet in. Who is to pay for printing their CONSTITUTIONS, their CERTIFICATES (which I hear is from an engra∣ved copper plate); who is to pay for the time and travelling expences of all their Delegates from the Sec∣tions to the State Committees, and from them to the General Executive Committee at Philadelphia; who is to pay a sum amounting to not less than <HI>forty thou∣sand dollars</HI> annually? Who but those who boast of their "Diplomatick Skill," <HI>and of their</HI> <Q>powerful faction in this country;</Q> those who have long had in pay the leading <HI>patriots</HI> in Ireland, and who have constantly supported a hireling press in each of the principal Cities of America?</P>
<P>Next, observe that the closest intimacy exists be∣tween the sans-culotte French, who are here, the most distinguished of the emigrated United Irishmen, and a base American printer, notoriously in the service of France. Observe too, that NAPPER TANDY
<PB N="22" REF="048395_0021_10250672989916B0"/>
went from New York to France, and that the conspi∣racy, as appears by its date, was not formed, 'till <HI>after we heard of his arrival at Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The leaders in this conspiracy are the very same persons, who conducted that in Ireland. When a section of their deluded partizans, in that country, were taken unawares by the King's troops, no money but <HI>French</HI> was found upon them, and this in a retired part of the kingdom, where it was impossible these insatuated wretches could have come at it through any other channel than that of the despots of Paris and their wicked agents. And, if a conspiracy could be so effectually paid there, in a country at open war with France, with an <HI>alien law,</HI> vigourously enforced, how easy must it be for them to maintain a hired and regu∣larly paid conspiracy here, when there is no check whatsoever to their machinations!</P>
<P>This diabolical plan was formed on the 8th of Au∣gust last, immediately before the YELLOW FEVER commenced its ravages in this city; with this in his recollection the reader will form his opinion respecting the following, which is a copy of the <HI>printed paper,</HI> before mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>American Society, OF UNITED IRISHMEN.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the Society of United Irishmen was formed here, men were found emulous of crouding to the Irish Standard, for the aspect of Ireland then, af∣forded

hope that her wrongs would soon be redressed. —That view so consoling to humanity, has for a mo∣ment been obscured; but it is not honourable to de∣sert a deserving friend in distress, it is not honourable to abandon a meritorious cause, which, when pros∣perous we have sworn to support.</P>
<P>The society is happy to find, that there is still reason to think, the fire and the scourge, will not long be exercised over our brethren with impunity, that the tyrannical imprisonments, the rapes, the arsons, the tortures, and the military murders are about to be a∣venged, and, that a manly people, whom six hundred years slavery could not debase, are about to be restored to their rights.</P>
<P>We have cause to deplore the loss we have sustained by the disease which lately suspended our meetings; and, we are unwilling to ascribe the present neglect of attendance of some members, to unworthy motives— but, it is deemed a duty, to notify you, that those who in future absent themselves, cannot conformably to the 18th Article of the Constitution, be regarded as belonging to the association.</P>
<P>The next meeting will be held at 7 o'clock on the evening of the 21st instant, in the African School-room, Willing's-alley, which lies between Third, Fourth, Walnut, and Spruce-streets.</P>

<P>This is the man, who began his canting letter, res∣pecting his attack on Mr. Pickering, with declaring that he was come <HI>here</HI> in search of "REPOSE"!!— I will just remark further on this notice, that I would lay my life it was translated from the French.—<Q>That view so consoling to humanity.</Q>—This is French in English words.—<Q>a manly people whom six hundred

years slavery could not debase, are about to be res∣tored to their right.</Q>—A very awkward translation of French cant.</P>
<P>This notice, I would have the reader believe, I have not published without good proof of its being signed by REYNOLDS, the seeker of "REPOSE." His name is <HI>written,</HI> and the hand writing has not only been carefully compared with the signature to a letter of his, now in my possession; but has also been com∣pared and verified before one of the judges in this city. All that is now wanted is, good proof of the person who <HI>printed,</HI> or who <HI>authorized printing,</HI> the plan of the con∣spiracy, which is called the CONSTITUTION, and if any American, <HI>native</HI> or <HI>adopted,</HI> is in possession of the means of producing such proof, and neglects to pro∣duce it, he is to all intents and purposes a TRAITOR.</P>
<P>I shall, now, briefly state, what I have lately gathered respecting the members of which the conspi∣racy now consists, and respecting the manner in which they are to ACT, and on what occasions. In the mean time, I would have THOSE, in whose power alone it is to counteract the baleful effects of this hellish combination, to recollect, that any ALIEN LAW, which extends only to ALIENS of a <HI>nation committing hostilities on the United States,</HI> will not reach the members of this affiliation.</P>
<P>I am informed, by one of the persons who manage the affairs of the AFRICAN SCHOOL, that the United Irishmen have not assembled there, for some time past, and that the reason of this was, their number was be∣come
<PB REF="048395_0024_10253B7D01BB1998"/>
<HI>too great</HI> for so small a room. I am also well informed, that two <HI>Englishmen</HI> have been admitted into the Society (I dare say there are two hundred, and that they earnestly solicited <HI>another Englishman</HI> to join it. Their strength, at this time, in this city and twenty miles round, consists of above <HI>fifteen hun¦dred;</HI> no contemptible number, if we consider how short the space is, since they began to enlist. A <HI>sec∣tion</HI> has been formed at New-York, another at Balti∣more, and another is either formed, or about to be formed, at Chambersburgh, in this state. Indeed, there is very little doubt, but we shall very soon receive satisfactory information of their being organized in every state, and in every principal city and town in the Union.</P>
<P>With respect to their calling their troops into <HI>ac∣tual service,</HI> it is clear that they would proceed in the same manner as the Jacobins in every other country have done. Conspirators are always cowards: besides this, they know too well their weakness to attempt an attack on the Government, unaided by any other party, and unprotected by a foreign power. Their whole business therefore, at present, is, to organize themselves; to enlist and number their troops, and to lie in wait for what they very properly call, <HI>"cases of URGENCY."</HI></P>
<P>If the <HI>"diplomatic skill"</HI> of France had been ex∣ercised with such complete success as the tyrants of that wretched country supposed it was; if it had been found, upon trial, that she possessed a very numerous and for∣midable faction here entirely devoted to her orders, these <HI>"cases of URGENCY"</HI> might have arisen
<PB REF="048395_0025_1025067A59722130"/>
from internal commotions. This source now seems to be dried up. The dispatches from France have rob∣bed the "Sister Republic" of all her adherents, ex∣cept the most abandoned and infamous miscreants a∣mongst the Americans, her own sans-culottes, and the half-gibbeted democrats from Great Britain and Ireland. Nothing, then, can give rise to one of those <Q>cases of URGENCY</Q> short of an invasion by France either from the Spanish territory, or from the sea; and, for an event of this kind the conspirators are ooking for with hopes much more sanguine than wan∣dering seed of Abraham ever looked for the coming of the Messiah.</P>
<P>An invasion on the coast is a thing naturally to be expected, unless an alliance is formed with Great Bri∣tain: from Lousiana or the Floridas is to be expected, whether such an alliance takes place or no. This, then, would be the <HI>"case of URGENCY,"</HI> and thus the conspirators would act. Before the panic would be over, (for there are your panic people in all countries) the whole affiliation would be in movement. They would thwart, threaten, or collect mobs; openly op∣pose, or secretly betray, just as it suited their several situations. They are not visible now, but then they would be seen and felt too. I make no doubt but they have members, in some capacity or other, in every public department. I should not wonder if they had at this time fifty in the different branches of the Post∣office. Thus has it proved in every country, which the infamous sans-culottes have invaded with success. In Holland, for instance, few people feared the invaders. The barriers were well fortified, well garrisoned, we supplied with ammunition and provisions, and the people appeared <HI>unanimous</HI> in their hatred of the enemy. But the fortresses fell, nobody could tell how; the French arrived as if it were <HI>by appointment,</HI> and many of those who had been the loudest in their expressions against them, were the first that they took by the hand.
<PB REF="048395_0026_1025067CEBB26AA8"/>
These villains had held a correspondence with them, and afterwards made a boast of their treason; the ja∣cobin affiliation ran through all the United Provinces; its members had crept into every department, civil and military; the mine was completed, and, at the approach of the enemy it was sprung. Just so was it in Italy, in Geneva, in Venice; so was it in Switzerland; so will it be in Spain, and would it have been in Britain long ago, had it not been for her insular situation and the watchfulness and vigour of her government.</P>
<P>To the danger of such a conspiracy America is pe∣culiarly exposed. Her <HI>distance from France</HI> is often, and, I must add, very stupidly, held out as a guaran∣tee for her safety. I might insist that there is no bar∣rier between her and the Spanish territory, which no∣body would deny; but, waving that, what, without the interference of Great Britain, is there to prevent twenty thousand sans-culottes from landing in this country? And, if they should do this, how many circumstances has America against her which no state in Europe knew any thing of!</P>
<P>From various causes these United States have be∣come the resting place of ninety nine hundredths of the factions villains, which Great Britain and Ireland have vomitted from their shores. They are all school∣ed in sedition, are adepts at their trade, and they most certainly bear as cordial a hatred to this government as they did to their own. The French sans-culottes now here, capable of bearing arms, amount to at least thirty thousand, all furious ruffians, puffed up with vanity, starving with hunger, and sighing for conquest and pillage.</P>
<P><PB REF="048395_0027_1025067E7AF615F0"/>Great numbers of these wretches, of all countries, are what are called CITIZENS; so that no <HI>alien law</HI> will touch them. Several hundreds of French have very lately been admitted to this destructive privilege and it is well known, that REYNOLDS is not only a citizen, but the <HI>political father</HI> of other citizens; for he has been suffered to vouch for their "good moral character and <HI>their attachment to "Constitution,"</HI> a ne∣cessary prelude to their admission. The penal code has been softened down, till it has no terrors, except for the honest man, who stands in need of <HI>protection.</HI> There are sixteen governments, all in some measure in∣dependent of the general government, to whom the safety of the nation is committed, and these sixteen are very far from being all in the hands of such men as would lend their cordial support to that general govern∣ment. The villain, who would get his neck stretched in the Federal courts, would very probably escape through other hands. In such a state of things the civil magistrate must hold a blunted, if not a broken, sword; and as to the military, though I would be willing to stake every thing on their <HI>valour,</HI> yet valour alone without skilful commanders and soldier well disciplined, is like a razor in the hands of a child.</P>
<P>But, what renders the situation of America more favourable to the views of France than any other coun∣try, is, the <HI>negro slavery</HI> to the Southward. On this it is that the villains ground their hope. It is said that some of the <HI>free</HI> negroes have already been admit∣ted into the conspiracy of the UNITED IRISHMEN, and that some slave holders either in Carolina or Virginia have engaged, in <HI>"a case of URGENCY,"</HI> to set their negroes free, in order to excite discontents amongst
<PB REF="048395_0028_102506800FEDAAD0" MS="y"/>
those of their neighbours, and thus involve the whole country in rebellion and bloodshed. I do not take up∣on me to say that these preparatory steps have been taken, but this I know, that nothing could be thought more hellish or better calculated to insure success.</P>
<P>There are two sorts of people who will <HI>smile</HI> at all this, and will call it a mere bug bear: these are, the muddy-headed men of indifference and the jacobins themselves. But, I trust the real friends of government will see it in its true light, and will not suffer themselves to be lulled asleep by the songs of Doctor "REPOSE" and his adherents. All these people want for the present is, to see the government <HI>quiet,</HI> dull, and unsuspecting. This is what they wished in Britain and Ireland. Every precautionary measure of the legislature or the execu∣tive; every <HI>inquiry,</HI> however legal, and however deli∣cately conducted, they brand with the name of "jea∣lous tyranny;" and to every honest man, who has the zeal to come forward in the discovery of their infernal plots, they give the appellation of SPY. This has had much influence on weak minds. Your <HI>good-natured peaceable</HI> man cannot bear the name of <HI>spy</HI> or <HI>informer;</HI> he would sooner see his neighbours burnt in their beds, and his own wife and children along them. I hope, how∣ever, that there is yet good sense and spirit enough less amongst us to despise every thing these artful treacher∣ous villains can say, and to defeat every thing they shall attempt. The man, who shall bring the leaders of this conspiracy to the halter, will deserve as well of his country as those who shall shed their blood in its de∣fence.</P>
