<L>WHILE jarring interests wake the world to arms,</L>
<L>And fright the peaceful vale with dire alarms;</L>
<L>While Ocean hears vindictive thunders roll</L>
<L>Along his trembling wave from pole to pole:</L>
<L N="5"> Sick of the scene, where War, with ruthless hand,</L>

<L>Far other themes of deep distress to sing</L>
<L>Than ever trembled from the vocal string.</L>
<L>No pomp of battle sweels the exalted strain,</L>
<L>Nor gleaming arms ring dreadful on the plain:</L>
<L N="15"> But, o'er the scene while pale remembrance weeps,</L>
<L>Fate with fell triumph rides upon the deeps.</L>
<L>Here hostile elements tumultuous rise,</L>
<L>And lawless floods rebel against the skies,</L>
<L>Till Hope expires, and Peril and Dismay</L>
<L N="20"> Wave their black ensigns on the watery way.</L>

<L>Alas! neglected by the sacred Nine,</L>
<L N="40"> Their suppliant feels no genial ray divine!</L>
<L>Ah! will they leave Pieria's happy shore,</L>

<L>Stranger to Phoebus, and the tuneful Train?</L>

<L N="70"> The hostile ships in flaming combat join:</L>

<L>Though warn'd full oft the slippery track to shun,</L>
<L N="130"> Yet Hope, with flattering voice, betray'd them on.</L>
<L>Beguil'd to danger thus, they left behind</L>
<L>The scene of peace, and social joy resign'd.</L>
<L>Long absent they, from friends and native home,</L>
<L>The cheerless ocean were inur'd to roam:</L>
<L N="135"> Yet Heaven, in pity to severe distress,</L>
<L>Had crown'd each painful voyage with success:</L>
<L>Still, to atone for toils and hazards past,</L>
<L>Restor'd them to maternal plains at last.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thrice had the sun, to rule the varying year,</L>
<L N="140"> Across th' equator roll'd his flaming sphere,</L>
<L>Since last the vessel spread her ample sail</L>

<L>Unwearying wafted her commercial store.</L>

<L>The second powers and office Rodmond bore:</L>
<L>A hardy son of England's farthest shore!</L>
<L N="260"> Where bleak Northumbria pours her savage train</L>
<L>In sable souadrons o'er the northern main;</L>
<L>That, with her pitchy entrails stor'd, resort,</L>
<L>A sooty tribe! to fair Augusta's port.</L>
<L>Where'er in ambush lurk the fatal sands,</L>
<L N="265"> They claim the danger; proud of skilful hands!</L>
<L>For while with darkling course their vessels sweep</L>
<L>The winding shore, or plow the faithless deep,</L>
<L>O'er bar and shelf the watery path they sound,<NOTE PLACE="foot">Ver. 268. A bar is known, in hydrography, to be a mass of earth or sand collected by the surge of the sea, at the en∣trance of a river or haven: so as to render the navigation difficult, and often dangerous.</NOTE></L>
<L>With dexterous arm; sagacious of the ground!</L>
<L N="270"> Fearless they combat every hostile wind,</L>
<L>Wheeling in mazy tracks, with course inclin'd.</L>
<L>Expert to moor, where terrors line the road,</L>
<L>Or win the anchor from its dark abode:</L>
<L>But drooping and relax'd in climes afar,</L>
<L N="275"> Tumultuous and undisciplin'd in war.</L>
<PB N="14" REF="021081_0012_0FB22E3462108CF0"/>
<L>Such Rodmond was; by learning unrefin'd,</L>
<L>That oft enlightens to corrupt the mind.</L>
<L>Boisterous of manners; train'd, in early youth,</L>
<L>To scenes, that shame the conscious cheek of truth;</L>
<L N="280"> To scenes, that Nature's struggling voice controul,</L>
<L>And freeze compassion rising in the soul!</L>
<L>Where the grim hell-hounds, prowling round the shore,</L>
<L>With foul intent the stranded bark explore;</L>
<L>Deaf to the voice of woe, her decks they board,</L>
<L N="285"> While tardy justice slumbers o'er her sword;</L>
<L>Th' indignant Muse, severely taught to feel,</L>
<L>Shrinks from a theme, she blushes to reveal!</L>
<L>Too oft example, arm'd with poisons fell,</L>
<L>Pollutes the shrine, where Mercy loves to dwell:</L>
<L N="290"> Thus Rodmond, train'd by this unhallow'd crew,</L>
<L>The sacred social passions never knew:</L>
<L>Unskill'd to argue; in dispute yet loud;</L>
<L>Bold without caution; without honour proud;</L>
<L>In art unschool'd; each veteran rule he priz'd,</L>
<L N="295"> And all improvement haughtily despis'd:</L>
<L>Yet though full oft to future perils blind,</L>
<L>With skill superior glow'd his daring mind,</L>
<L>Through snares of death the reeling bark to guide,</L>
<L>When midnight shades involve the raging tide.</L>

<L>Hither he wander'd, anxious to explore,</L>
<L N="315"> Antiquities of nations now no more:</L>

<L>In vain; for rude Adversity's command,</L>
<L>Still on the margin of each famous land,</L>
<L N="320"> With unrelenting ire, his steps oppos'd;</L>
<L>And every gate of hope against him clos'd!</L>
<L>Permit my verse, ye blest Piërian Train,</L>
<L>To call Arion this ill-fated swain!</L>
<L>For, like that bard unhappy, on his, head</L>
<L N="325"> Malignant stars their hostile influence shed.</L>
<L>Both in lamenting numbers, o'er the deep,</L>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Argument. Reflection on leaving the land. The gale continues. A water-spout. Beauty of a dying dolphin. The ship's progress along the shore. Wind strengthens. The sails reduced. A shoal of porpoises. Last appearance of cape Spado. Sea rises. A squall. The sails further diminish∣ed. Mainsail split. Ship bears away before the wind. Again hauls upon the wind. Another mainsail fitted to the yard. The gale still increases. Topsails furled. Top∣gallant-yards sent down. Sea enlarges. Sun-set. Courses reefed. Four seamen lost off the lee main-yard-arm. Anxiety of the pilots from their dangerous situation. Re∣solute behaviour of the sailors. The ship labours in great distress. The artillery thrown overboard. Dismal ap∣pearance of the weather. Very high and dangerous sea. Severe fatigue of the crew. Consultation and resolution of the officers. Speech and advice of Albert to the crew. Necessary disposition to veer before the wind. Disap∣pointment in the proposed effect. New dispositions equally unsuccessful. The mizen-mast cut away.</P>

<L N="905"> Ingulph'd beneath two fluctuating hills:</L>
<L>On either side they rise; tremendous scene!</L>
<L>A long dark melancholy vale between.</L>
<L>The balanc'd ship, now forward, now behind,<NOTE PLACE="foot">Ver. <HI>908.</HI> That the reader, who is unacquainted with the manoeuvres of navigation, may conceive a clearer idea of the ship's state when <HI>trying;</HI> and of the change of her situation to that of <HI>scudding,</HI> I have quoted a part of the explanation of those articles as they appear in the Dictionary of the Marine.
<P>Trying is the situation in which a ship lies nearly in the trough or hollow of the sea in a tempest, particularly when it blows contrary to her course.</P>
<P>In trying as well as in scudding, the sails are always re∣duced in proportion to the increase of the storm; and in either state, if the storm is excessive, she may have all her sails furl∣ed; or be, according to the sea-phrase, <HI>under bare poles.</HI></P>
<P>The intent of spreading a sail at this time is to keep the ship more steady, and to prevent her from rolling violently, by pres∣sing her side down in the water; and also to turn her head towards the source of the wind, so that the shock of the seas may fall more obliquely on her flank, than when she lies along the trough of the sea, or in the interval between two waves. While she lies in this situation, the helm is fastened close to the lee side, to prevent her as much as possible from falling to lee∣ward. But as the ship is not then kept in equilibrium by the operation of her sails, which at other times counterbalance each other at the head and stern, she is moved by a slow but continual vibration, which turns her head alternately to wind∣ward and to leeward, forming an angle of <HI>30</HI> or <HI>40</HI> degrees in the interval. That part where she stops in approaching the direction of the wind, is called her <HI>coming-to;</HI> and the con∣trary excess of the angle to leeward, is called her <HI>falling-off.</HI></P>
<P>Veering or wearing, ver. <HI>641. 808.</HI> as used in the present sense, may be defined, the movement by which a ship changes her state from trying to that of scudding, or, of running be∣fore the direction of the wind and sea.</P>
<P>It is an axiom in natural philosophy, That every body will persevere in a state of rest, or of moving uniformly in a right line, unless it be compelled to change its state by forces impres∣sed: and that the change of motion is proportional to the mov∣ing force impressed, and made according to the right line in which that force acts.</P>
<P>Hence it is easy to conceive how a ship is compelled to turn into any direction by the force of the wind, acting upon any part of her length in lines parallel to the plane of the horizon. Thus in the act of veering, which is a necessary consequence of this invariable principle, the object of the seaman is to re∣duce the action of the wind on the ship's hind part, and to receive its utmost exertion on her fore part, so that the latter may be pushed to leeward. This effect is either produced by the operation of the sails, or by the impression of the wind on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> masts and yards. In the former case the sails on the hind part of the ship are either furled or arranged nearly parallel to the direction of the wind, which then glides ineffectually along their surfaces; at the same time the foremost sails are spread abroad, so as to receive the greatest exertion of the wind, ver. <HI>916.</HI> The fore part accordingly yields to this impulse, and is put in motion, and this motion, necessarily conspiring with that of the wind, pushes the ship about, as much as is requisite to produce the desired effect.</P>
<P>But when the tempest is so violent as to preclude the use of sails, the effort of the wind operates almost equally on the op∣posite ends of the ship, because the masts and yards situated near the head and stern serve to counterbalance each other, in receiving its impression. The effect of the helm is also consi∣derably diminished, because the headway, which gives life and vigour to all its operations, is at this time feeble and in∣effectual. Hence it becomes necessary to destroy this equilibri∣um, which subsists between the masts and yards before and behind, and to throw the balance forward to prepare for v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ing. If this cannot be effected by the arrangement of the yards on the masts, and it becomes absolutely necessary to veer in order to save the ship from destruction, ver. <HI>927.</HI> the mi∣zen-mast must be cut away, and even the main-mast, if she still remains incapable of answering the helm by turning her prow to leeward.</P>
<P>Scudding is that movement in navigation by which a ship is carried precipitately before a tempest, ver. <HI>645. 808.</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>As a ship flies with amazing rapidity through the water, whenever this expedient is put in practice, it is never at∣tempted in a contrary wind, unless when her condition ren∣ders her incapable of sustaining the mutual effort of the wind and waves any longer on her side, without being exposed to the most imminent danger.</P>
<P>A ship either scuds with a sail extended on her fore-mast, or, if the storm is excessive, without any sail, which in the sea-phrase is called scudding <HI>under bare poles.</HI></P>
<P>The principal hazards incident to scudding, are generally, a sea striking the ship's stern; the difficulty of steering, which perpetually exposes her to the danger of <HI>broaching-to;</HI> and the want of sufficient sea-room. A sea which strikes the stern violently may shatter it to pieces, by which the ship must in∣evitably founder. By broaching-to suddenly, she is threaten∣ed with losing all her masts and sails, or being immediately overturned: and for want of sea-room she is exposed to the dangers of being w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecked on a lee-shore.</P></NOTE></L>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN subjects of the highest importance are submited to the Public, an apology is ne∣cessary.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured, in verses at least equal to my own judgment, to express my ideas of a late event, which, whilst it awakened poetical feeling, must have excited national ideas.</P>
<P>I will not attempt to analyze a subject, which from its nature must preclude extreme regular composition, but appeal to the sensibility of my readers.</P>

<HEAD>THE STORM, A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>INTENT to praise th' ambitious chief or king,</L>
<L>Of wasteful war let loftier Poets sing,</L>
<L>And fix, the meed though reason disavow,</L>
<L>The wreath of triumph on the hero's brow;</L>
<L N="5"> Or, haply form'd for less exalted strains,</L>
<L>Paint the mild glories of the verdant plains,</L>
<L>Where liberty the peasant's toil rewards,</L>
<L>And, what she nobly gave, as nobly guards—</L>
<L>A different theme demands my humbler muse,</L>
<L N="10"> Who piteous sighs, and trembles, as she views</L>
<L>Earth, ocean, skies in conflict wild engage,</L>
<L>And the dire wrecks of elemental rage!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Thou, whose wisdom, still employ'd for man,</L>
<L>Seems for a moment erring from its plan;</L>
<L N="15"> Yet oft from poverty elicites wealth,</L>
<L>From anguish gladness, and from sickness health,</L>
<L>And bids those bosoms, which with triumph glow,</L>
<L>Submission learn from salutary woe!</L>
<L>Assist the verse, which scorning mean applause,</L>
<L N="20"> Exerts new vigour in the noblest cause;</L>
<PB N="112" REF="021081_0108_0FB23B0FC7DCF850"/>
<L>And boldly warns the valiant and the free,</L>
<L>Flush'd with proud conquest, to depend on thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now a fifth time light's delegated source</L>
<L>To glowing <HI>Cancer</HI> had perform'd his course,</L>
<L N="25"> Since the new world, by hardships bolder grown,</L>
<L>Had fix'd bright freedom on her radiant throne,</L>
<L>And taught (Heav'n secret works for noblest ends)</L>
<L>The truest lessons to her foes, and friends.</L>
<L>Yet, like the hero, who, with conquest crown'd,</L>
<L N="30"> Pines with an inward, deleterious wound,</L>
<L>Success a crowd of latent ills supplied;</L>
<L>Neglected labour, overweening pride,</L>
<L>Religion's voice contemn'd for Pleasure's strain,</L>
<L>And the long list of woes in Luxury's train.</L>
<L N="35"> In vain the Press, with Freedom's dictates bold,</L>
<L>Her true ally, th' approaching ills foretold.</L>
<L>Ideal treasures swelling in his mind,</L>
<L>To real misery <HI>Avarice</HI> was blind.</L>
<L>In vain the Preacher turn'd the sacred leaf,</L>
<L N="40"> Or spoke heav'n-prompted—<HI>Luxury</HI> was deaf.</L>
<L>As giddy boys th' illusive rainbow chace,</L>
<L>Heedless of toil, and fearless of disgrace,</L>
<L>Thus to false industry the merchant bow'd,</L>
<L>And worship'd speculation's goody cloud.</L>
<L N="45"> The farmer too, fir'd with the ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of gain,</L>
<L>Deserts the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eady labours of the plain;</L>
<L>And, all-unpractis'd in the giddy ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</L>
<L>In trade's aerial regions holdly strays;</L>
<L>But soon in poverty his rashness mourns,</L>
<L N="50"> And, meteer-like, to native earth returns.</L>
<L>O'er his neglected art the artist pines,</L>
<L>Or to mad revelry his hours resigns;</L>
<L>Smiles at those ills, at which he once turn'd p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</L>
<L>And hopes, not dreads, that fatal spunge, a jail.</L>

<L N="55"> Destructive luxury! thou child of ease;</L>
<L>Thee let the gilded courts of tyrants please.</L>
<L>Far from our rougher plains retire to vales,</L>
<L>Where silken dalliance, fann'd by spicy gales,</L>
<L>Devotes to mean delights the flying hours,</L>
<L N="60"> Nor dreads the chains, conceal'd by fragrant flowers.</L>
<L>Let Commerce too, if with accurs'd design,</L>
<L>She basely offers incense at thy shrine,</L>
<L>And hopes to check the ardour of the free,</L>
<L>From our indignant coasts retire with thee!</L>
<L N="65"> Sooth'd with the true delight of honest fame,</L>
<L>Methinks I hear our veterans exclaim—</L>
<L>"Our streaming wounds, our flattering hopes forgot,</L>
<L>"Be poverty and freedom still our lot!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus spoke the free and wise!—But ah! how vain</L>
<L N="70"> Their efforts 'gainst the flatt'ring tide of gain!</L>
<L>Which, whilst in peaceful stream it seems to flow,</L>
<L>Leads to the dark abyss of cruel woe.</L>

<L>And heavy <HI>Ignorance</HI> no danger sees;</L>
<L>Till the loud cataract assails their ears;</L>
<L N="80"> Then all, confus'd, at once confess their fears;</L>
<L>But ah! too late—down the swift flood they go,</L>
<L>Lost in the foaming gulph, which roars below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor be to trade alone those ills assign'd,</L>
<L>Which wrapt in dreary gloom the public mind;</L>
<L N="85"> Since to vile <HI>Faction</HI> half at least is due;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>On Aetna's fertile sides thus vineyards glow,</L>

<L N="95"> The song and dance delight the thoughtless swains,</L>

<L>And its rock'd basis rocks resounding shores.</L>
<L>Columns of smoke and fire alternate rise;</L>
<L N="100"> Now flame through ether, and now blot the skies.</L>
<L>Anon the burning torrents rush amain</L>

<L>Involving in resistless, firy tide</L>
<L>The works of industry, and arts of pride.</L>

<L>Again their flocks in happy leisure tend;</L>

<L>Ye, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ult in <HI>Freedom</HI>'s glorious rights,</L>
<L>Whom <HI>Industry</HI> to solid wealth invites;</L>

<L N="200"> And lightnings flash a momentary day.</L>
<L>O'er the drear scene, for his approach prepar'd,</L>

<L>Protracted war with earth he means to wage,</L>
<L>Nor pours at once his full collected rage.</L>
<L N="205"> Anon his wrath, impatient of controul,</L>
<L>Bursts o'er the world, convulsing either pole.</L>
