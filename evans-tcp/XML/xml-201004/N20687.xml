<P>THE general intention of occasions like the present, may be supposed to be rather amusement and pleasure than real improvement; and the speaker may be thought to have performed his duty, if he shall have gratified the imagi∣nation, or animated the passions of his audience. Although this be pleasing to the mind, and ought not to be altogether above our present aim: yet, existing circumstances demand something more useful than pleasure, and more serious than amusement.</P>
<P>ON this day, which is set apart by the COLUMBIAN ORDER, to celebrate their Anniversary, and to renew, in a public manner, their mutual tokens of brotherhood, of friendship, and of patriotism—At this period when all Europe is involved in confusion, and wrapt in war, and when even the peaceful hemisphere of this Western world begins to redden with the martial flame—At this critical season, when the interests of our country demand one heart, and one soul, and one uplifted arm; and when our enemies may be privately employed in sowing dissentions among us, and dividing our strength; what subject should equally arrest our attention; what is of comparative importance with
<PB N="6" REF="027169_0006_0FD392F561EE7A48"/>UNION: The proper influence of this principle will diffuse harmony through all ranks, will encrease and establish the advantages of the nation, will make strong and formi∣dable what before was contemptible and weak, and will al∣ways oppose an impenetrable phalanx to the bold front of ap∣proaching danger.</P>
<P>YOUR attention will, therefore, be called to this interest∣ing subject, which naturally divides itself into two branches, the UNION of the STATES, and UNION of SENTI∣MENT.</P>
<P>WHO can cast his eyes over this extensive region, and traverse our country from New-Hampshire on the north, to Georgia on the south, and not perceive that PROVIDENCE designed us to be a great and <HI>united</HI> nation? Our lines are marked by the very hand of nature. On the east the At∣lantic washes a various and extensive coast; on the west, the broad and rapid Mississippi pours its stream along; and on the north the river St. Lawrance, and a chain of august lakes, form a natural boundary. Within these limits marked by in∣variable lines, and abundantly extensive for the purposes of one empire, do we not find a variety of climate and of soil, and a rich diversity of productions, sufficient for all the con∣veniencies and elegancies of life? Have we not hence, ample resources within the bosom of our country, which, from their very nature, are inexhaustible, and which require nothing but our united exertions to be adequate to every useful purpose? Invested by nature with strength, it belongs to us to avail ourselves of it, and to become expert in all the modes of its appropriation. But disunion would defeat these beneficent purposes of nature, and totally annihilate those advantages which a kind PROVIDENCE has con∣ferred.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="027169_0007_0FD392F75DCCC4D8"/>
THE particular advantages attendant on the close and continued UNION of the States, arise from a variety of sources, are evident upon the least reflection, and are equally certain as to their favourable consequences. Not to mention the powerful influence which Union would have on MORALITY, the purest fountain of national happiness and glory—Does not COMMERCE always flourish in proportion to the excellence of commodities, and the safety and facility of reciprocal interchange? and are not the pro∣ductions of our country although various, yet generally ne∣cessary for the support of life, and requisite for the wants of civilized society? Union would therefore give occasion to a continued and encreasing exchange of commodities be∣tween the different States, to their mutual convenience and emolument. And, if the wealth of a country be an object both splendid and useful, the spirit of Commerce, like the breeze which fills the sail, should breathe freely and uncon∣fined. But though this domestic commerce should not pro∣duce the most exorbitant wealth, yet what it does afford, will be conveniently and with little hazard, acquired: Be∣sides, it ought to be remembered, that a nation becomes happy and elegant, not so much by the mere accumulation of wealth, as by the rapid circulation of that wealth, in the different channels of industry. This is the powerful cause which throws life and vigour into every department; gives a spring of constant activity to the public mind, and diffuses a polish and agreeable splendor over the face of society. Who can be made to believe that this country would derive half that strength, half that respectability, half that degree of glory from the possession of the mines of Mexico and Peru, which she would obtain from a small proportion of that wealth, acquired by labor, by the hazard of enter∣prize,
<PB N="8" REF="027169_0008_0FD392F838131658"/>and by the exertions of genius? Let the proprietors of those golden mountains examplify the truth which the question suggests.</P>
<P>THERE is another advantage intimately connected with COMMERCE, and of no less importantce than Commerce itself: By a frequent intercourse between the citizens of these States, manners, customs, and language, would conti∣nually assimilate; little asperities would gradually wear away; till, after a certain period, one spirit of friendship would pervade, and one soul of harmony actuate the whole of this free empire. This representation is not the ideal fabric of fancy, it is founded on the nature of society, and will certainly be the happy consequence of a firmly cement∣ed UNION.</P>
<P>IF the subject be viewed in a POLITICAL point of light the advantages of Union will appear equally obvious and striking. The policy of a measure always results from its nature, and from attendant circumstances. The very situation of the country, both natural and civil, exhibits the high policy of union. Are we not surrounded with a huge chain which seems to have been purposely designed to em∣brace within its mighty circumference, the interests, the hap∣piness, the liberties of one great nation? So weighty is this chain and at present so strong, that it will not only require an unnatural and violent concussion to burst its links asun∣der; but if once broken, it will probably remain, in defiance of art or strength, of policy or danger, forever separate, and for ever widning into a greater chasm.</P>
<P>CONTEMPLATING the first settlement of this country, when small colonies planted themselves in different parts of the American territory, some preferring the Northern and
<PB N="9" REF="027169_0009_0FD392FC09719658"/>some the Southern regions, it is easy to perceive that a consi∣derable difference would obtain in the appearance, in the lives, and in the manners of this widely scattered society. But, as they chiefly came from one nation, as they spoke one language, as they naturally imbibed the same ideas of civil government, and drank of the same spirit of freedom; it is as easy to perceive that they would, upon the great scale, be marked by a general similarity; and be, in fact, ONE PEO∣PLE. Here, then, we see diversity amid similarity, and a considerable variety amid a general uniformity. What consequence ought properly to flow from these separate qua∣lities? Independent and unconnected States? No. This would be a violation of the principle of uniformity. Ought it then to be one compact and consolidated empire? This would equally violate the principle of diversity. The only just and natural consequence would be both a <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>general</HI> government. This would not be the result of a hand∣some theory, or a choice from the wide field of speculation; it would arise from the very nature of the country, and from the civil situation of its inhabitants. You perceive, then, my fellow-citizens, that the PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, in forming their present political compact, have conformed to their respective local and rela∣tive positions, and acted upon the generous plan which the hand of nature had previously sketched. With similar wis∣dom will a people always act, if they enter into deliberation; and, on such important subjects, they will always deliberate, if they are free. The governments which we have made for ourselves, and under which we happily live, are both particular and general. And, if the nation have prudence to keep the wheels of each revolving within their proper sphere, sufficiently confined to prevent too wide a deviation;
<PB N="10" REF="027169_0010_0FD39301324F1EB0"/>yet, sufficiently loose to move with facility; may we not hope that, like the sun, and the planets which roll round his orb, their revolutions will be performed with equal beauty and harmony, till, the frame of nature disjointed, annihilate all human works, in order to introduce divine?</P>
<P>IF the present <HI>Federal Union</HI> be disolved; one of these two consequences must, if not immediately, yet not very re∣motely, follow—either a CONSOLIDATED EMPIRE, or several DISTINCT and UNCONNECTED STATES. Would not the first require such a high-toned government, such an exorbitant proportion of power in the executive, and such a vast multiplicity of officers flowing from it, that the mild influence of law would soon yield to the superior sway of official authority? And if one department embrace such an undue proportion of power, will not its appetite increase in a similar ratio? Will it probably be ever satiated till it have swallowed up the two other departments of go∣vernment? Where, then, will be your priviledges, your laws of freedom, and your glorious republican edifice? When the imperial power began at Rome, it amused the people with the continuance of the consular autho∣rity, and other popular establishments, at the same time that it was gradually absorbing their strength, till noth∣ing was left, but the shadow and paltry form of liberty—till in fact, the consulate, that dignified office, which awaken▪ the ambition of a Cato and a Tully, and other true patriots, became so degraded, that a <HI>horse</HI> was once invested with its honors, and I suppose performed very well, all the duties which it then embraced. So, perhaps, a consolidated go∣vernment, wrapped in the specious veil of forbearance and flattery, would at first move easily along, and press as light∣ly
<PB N="11" REF="027169_0011_0FD3930300E9CB90"/>as possible upon the public mind: but how soon would it be like the "letting out of waters", at first gently pressing through a narrow breach; till, wearing a sufficient passage, they sweep along with the fury of a torrent, impetuous and irresistible!</P>
<P>WHAT is meant by this word <HI>Consolidation?</HI> It has a strong and compact sound, and seems somewhat formidable in its very appearance. It expresses very well its peculiar meaning. What is it but forcing into one mass uniform and undistinguishable that which is by nature, by reason, and the power of habit, beautifully diversifyed? What is it in fine, but a total destruction of the State Governments? And if these be once demolished, where is the guardian who can so well inspect the affairs, so well attend to the wants, so intimately feel the particular interests of the peo∣people? Can one eye, however wakeful and piercing, watch the sacred deposit with as much safety, as the quick and vivid glance of fifteen Sovereign and United States? If you level these elevations, on what will you ascend to view the ever varying aspects of the political horizon? If you throw down these watch towers, whence will you at the encroachment of foreign or civil tyranny, sound so legally the dire alarm? But the American people are too wise, are too happy—they have drank too deep of the sweet stream of liberty, and perceive too clearly the advantages of a <HI>federal</HI> union, not to feel themselves roused and indignant at the thoughts of consolidation. Their voice is unanimous for UNION and FREEDOM, except perhaps a trifling few who sigh for <HI>garters,</HI> for <HI>ribbons,</HI> and for <HI>stars,</HI> pretty royal play things—and who would sell their rights and their country, for a song.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="027169_0012_0FD3930476172EE8"/>
BUT, supposing that the dissolution of the federal union, in∣stead of terminating in consolidation, should widen into sepa∣rate and unconnected sovereignties, would our situation be more eligible? If the union be broken, at the same moment will decline the common spirit of affection which so happily pervades this country. The Georgian would no more call the Carolinian brother; and the Pennsylvanian and New-Yorker would begin to eye each other with "mutual aspect malign." If the union be dissolved, at that instant start up in horrid shapes, different interests, contrary sentiments, selfish views, with all the hated passions which pride and mad ambition fire. Though at present the several states are acknowledged to have interests somewhat different, yet they are held in harmonious arrangment, and are made to promote their mutual advantage by the powerful and be∣nign influence of Union. But the moment that band is burst, that moment they all fly at random; mix and clash and jar with horrid concussion, till they produce one dismal scene of woe and confusion. So a machine, completed by the perfection of mechanic art, performs its operations in equal and orderly movements, till, shocked too rudely by some unskilful hand, the governing power gives way, and all the work suddenly sinks into total disorder. Or, to compare great things with small, thus, the solar system, re∣volving through the vast of nature in sublime and celestial harmony, if once loosened from the mighty influence of at∣traction, would exhibit beneath the cope of heaven, pla∣nets, and suns, and comets, in dire disorder—now darting in∣to the immensity of space—now clashing with horrid and loud jarring discord, till the whole universe has rushed into rapid ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="027169_0013_0FD3930926B6B4A0"/>
IF therefore, we were split by some discordant power into several unconected sovereignties, we should probably soon repent of the change. Was there not, about the time of forming the new constitution, some serious conversation respecting a division of the American nation into three grand departments—the northern, the middle, and the southern? Where the lines of separation were to run, I believe ne∣ver was, and it is to be hoped, never will be ascertained. For, it is an incontrovertible maxim, that so long as human nature continues the same, similar circumstances will always give rise to similar events. And, as soon as we are a divided people, our situation with respect to each other, will be like that of the Europeans; and, very probably, we shall act over again, those scenes of famous folly which they have al∣ready acted. One of our <HI>new made empires,</HI> perhaps the present state of New-York, may fancy that she has received some insult from another of our <HI>new made empires;</HI> the pre∣sent state of Pennsylvania. We must preserve our dignity; we must keep our honor free from stain; we will be treated with more respect. What! shall our national sovereignty be trampled upon by that proud and imperious people? No. We shall teach her a lesson of humility, and convince her to her sorrow, that in provoking the resentment of Yorkers, the has roused the spirit of heroes. Have we not a firm band of patriotic citizens, who will step forth with proud obe∣dience, to vindicate the national honor? Have we not twenty thousand hardy sons of the north, whose breasts burn for the conflict, and who would glory to reduce that haughty rival? And if these be not sufficient, is not the brave nation of Ver∣mont always prepared for battle, and always ready to join in league with their former brothers of New-York? Thus, my fellow-citizens, would we soon swell with pride, adopt
<PB N="14" REF="027169_0014_0FD3930AF09D1568"/>the language and imitate the destructive conduct of the European nations. League would be added to league, not with the view of repelling common danger, or promoting mutual happiness; but for the diabolical purpose of national revenge. And, dreadful to tell, those who now conceive their prosperity to be reciprocal; who are united by habits, by principle, by affection; and who form the most amiable and beautiful republic on the earth, would, like the beasts of the desart, furiously spring upon and devour each other.</P>
<P>WOULD not every thing, were we once disunited, invite to aggression and hostility? Our contiguity of situation, our open and extensive sea-coast, the weakness of some and the strength of other states, would quickly excite ideas of agran∣dizement, and afford frequent occasions for mutual invasion and conquest. Plunder would soon become our trade, and war and murder our national glory. It has been confessed that the interests of the states are somewhat different; dis∣union would greatly augment those differences, and conse∣quently occasion them more frequently to interfere and clash. Each state pursuing its own objects, not only without the spirit of accommodation, but with the spirit of opposition, would construe each causual clashing into designed provoca∣tion, and they would decide their differences by a hasty ap∣peal to arms. For it is very improbable that the complaisant principle of forbearance and negociation, by which we are at present characterized, would in our disputes with one another, be observed with such scrupulous punctuality.</P>
<P>BUT, supposing what is indeed very difficult to be imagined, that the separated States, should never light up the torch of war in defiance of each other, what would be their situation
<PB N="15" REF="027169_0015_0FD3930CD3A816D8"/>with respect to foreign powers? If forbearance would pre∣vent injury, if uniform submission would keep insult at a dis∣tance, if tameness and cowardice would occasion the return of respect and honor; then, and not till then, might disuni∣ted America flatter herself with the peace and friendship of Transatlantic Courts. But, if broken asunder, shall we not become weak in the extreme? And, if weak, shall we not in∣vite the attacks of every lawless invader? Do we not know that the strongest motive for insuring justice, is to be in a situ∣ation to inforce it? And, that the most effectual argument to preserve peace, is to be prepared and formidable for war? Who does not know that to rely upon the disinterested good will of foreign Courts, is to take grimace for sincerity, for∣mality for wisdom, the shadow for the substance, and Satan himself for an angel of light? But, even if the Transatlan∣tic Nations should be so <HI>singularly politie,</HI> as not to harrass our trade, invade our separated territory, or attempt our subjugation; yet, how could we keep ourselves without the dreadful vortex of their dark and mysterious politics? In such a complicated labyrinth of corruption and oppression; in such a dismal abyss of injustice and tyranny, if we are once in∣volved, we shall probably be involved forever. We should find it necessary to acquire the habits of perfect submission, and to enter with reluctant acquiescence into every courtly project. The blood of that heroic nation, which once flow∣ed so freely in the cause of liberty and of man, would stain the cold soil of slavery, and be wasted in the service of ambi∣tion, and of despotism. O my country! if once thou art disunited, what prophetic eye can foresee all thy calamities; what pen can describe, or what tongue relate all thy woes! From being the beauty of the whole earth, and the wide assylum of oppressed millions; thou shalt thyself become a scene of oppression, of slavery, of blood!</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="027169_0016_0FD3930E140C9D38"/>
YOUR eyes, my fellow citizens, shall probably never witness such an awful change. But, it is our duty as men, as christians, as members of a free republic, to make the greatest exertions in order to preserve to the latest ages, the sacred rights and priviledges of the nation. How will this important object be accomplished, but by the happiest influence of Union?</P>
<P>BUT, will the UNION of America ensure all that advan∣tage which it was calculated and expected to produce—will it acquire vigor and permanency—will it, in a word, be more than half complete, if it be a union only as to FORM, with∣out the UNION of SENTIMENT? This is that secret power, which first attracted, and still binds, in the tie of ge∣nuine affection, the hearts of Americans. This is the electric fluid, which fired in any part, suddenly vibrates through the whole. This is that intimate sympathy, which nature has im∣planted, which habit has refined, and which external force shall never destroy.</P>
<P>NUMEROUS have been the motives, and frequent the sea∣sons, which have excited in the breasts of Americans, the same glow of valor, the same throb of freedom, the same sentiments of patriotism; when their heroes inspired by the love of their country, fought side by side, on the en∣sanguined plain; and, for their children, their friends, and and the dearest interests of humanity, freely mingled their purest blood. See! it flows in immortal streams around the land of freedom, and may it forever flow, and form the eter∣nal line which tyranny shall never pass: Say, ye defenders of your country; ye, who ardently sought the post of dan∣ger; who dared the utmost fury of the storm, and stood un∣daunted amid the "rocking of the battlements"; say, were
<PB N="17" REF="027169_0017_0FD39310EA315888"/>ye not animate<SUP>1</SUP> with one sublime and patriotic sentiment, which illuminated and inspired the glorious efforts of Ame∣rica? But, does not the present season equally demand, equally urge, equally enforce a firmly cemented Union of all the civic and military virtues? Does not this mo∣ment call aloud, on all men who love the reign of free∣dom, who desire the happiness of mankind, who pray for the peace and prosperity of America—to lay aside their smaller differences, to strengthen themselves for the service of their country, and to brighten into lustre the high hope of patriotism? The alarm, it is true, has not yet called our citizen soldiers to the field of danger: the foe does not yet march, to spread havoc and desolation over your fertile plains; to stain, with horrid joy, his hands of cruelty in the blood of your reverend fires, and your innocent children; to ravish from your arms the wife of your bosom, or insult the virgin of your love. Hostile armor does not yet dazzle the affrighted eye, nor does the cannon's dire explosion an∣nounce the near approach of terror. What then, my be∣loved countrymen? Is this a time when the UNITED flames of love should burn languid, or be mixed with jealous fires? Is this a time of leisure to attend to the whispers of party, or to lend an ear to the clamourous voice of faction? Is this a period in which you ought to fancy yourselves se∣cure, your glorious privileges beyond the hazard of invasion, and your country perfectly free from danger? Will liberty in America remain at peace, and triumph undisturbed; when in Europe, she is attacked by the whole force of despotism, and threatened with extirpation and death? Behold there the scenes of blood and horror which rapidly strike the eye, and give agony to the mind! Peace has retired far off, and all the milder virtues follow weeping in her train! War with
<PB N="18" REF="027169_0018_0FD3931526F7EFD8"/>all his dreadful throng, famines, conflagrations, pestilences, and deaths, ravages the fairest abodes of man! Nothing is heard but noise, and tumult, and the loudly reitera∣ted shout of battle. Nothing seen but hostile preparations, and weapons drenched in human gore. All the atmosphere is black and turbid; all the sky dreadfully streaked with fire! See the huge armies rushing to the fierce onset, flaming with revenge! Front opposed to front, is stretched out, as far as sight can distinguish the lengthened line. The nodding plume, the proudly prancing steed, the dazzling of armor, and the banners unfurled, announce the dreadful approach. At the emboldening sound of martial music, slowly advances the moving terror. The grandeur of the scene, increasing with the danger, inspires an awful elevation of foul. With an eye that speaks desperate deeds, and with determined as∣pect they advance to a fearful interval—where death awaits the carnage—The music makes a moment's pause, and uni∣versal silence reigns, except where the clattering of armor, the tremor of the horses, and the perturbation of a hundred thousand souls, excite through all the host a confused noise, which murmurs on the ear like the distant roar of dying thunders. All at once the the drum's inspiring sound, and and the trumpet's shrill clangor, call to high atchievements, and to feats of glory. The instruments of destruction are levelled, and a thousand deaths fly hissing through the air. Blood stains the earth, and the sight of blood inspires with fiercer courage, and more desperate revenge. On they rush, regardless of the companion falling at their side, and the fiery-mouthed cannon disgorging instant ruin. Involved in smoke, the hostile fronts meet. Now the clashing swords, the exploding musketry, the continued roar of thunder, with the doleful shrieks of the wounded, and the shouts of victory,
<PB N="19" REF="027169_0019_0FD39317B477BF58"/>assail the ear, and rise in mingled confusion to heaven. But see? through this dread darkness, a glory bursts, and sheds a lustre on the dismal scene. Behold! surrounded with a radient cloud, LIBERTY in her triumphal car, "rides in this whirlwind and directs the storm." On her right, sits victory flashing terror. The vast concave of heaven far resounds to thunder of her call—FREEDOM or DEATH! Despo∣tism hears aghast the reverberating roar, and from his iron throne starts in trepidation and dismay.</P>
<P>HERETOFORE, in the contests of the mighty, Liberty has seldom appeared; and when she has, she was generally ac∣companied with misfortune and defeat. But men have ac∣quired the knowledge of their rights, and the dark reign of delusion has vanished. From the vigorous arm of our brave allies, has despotism received his mortal wound. This is the cause of the Monster's struggling so violently, and bel∣lowing so loud. But, remember that his sinews are of iron, and his bones of brass; and, that his agony in death will be direful. He may yet make the effort of despair, and wrap the whole world in flames.</P>
<P>WHO knows how thin may be the partition between us and the most iminent danger? Who knows, but before the flight of another month, the storm which now lowers in our horizon, may rapidly rise and involve us in destruction? At a distance we hear the thunders roar, and see the lightnings play; who can tell how soon they may flash across our sky, and enkindle all the fire of war? Then, then, when consternation walks through the land—when the loud alarm is sounded— TO ARMS, CITIZENS, TO ARMS! the foe is advan∣cing thick and formidable—the banners of slavery lower
<PB N="20" REF="027169_0020_0FD393192C0787B8"/>over his front. Your wives, your children, your venerable sires—your rights as men—your glory as freemen, demand your strenuous efforts—TO ARMS, CITIZENS, TO ARMS, and meet the embattled foe!—When this shall be our situation; in what shall be our safety, what shall give us firmness, what shall render us formidable—invincible— victorious, but the POWER of UNION? Breathe then, my fellow citizens, O breathe the same spirit of freedom; vigorously co-operate in the same honorable measures; en∣kindle the same ardent glow of patriotism, and let your souls burn with the noblest emulation, in the service of your country. Then if the impetuosity of war descend, you shall receive the shock like men, and return it like heroes. Ty∣ranny shall again fly before you, and liberty ride through the air in sublime triumph.</P>
<P>BUT, happy Americans! Although you ought vigorously to prepare for your defence; although the "war of freedom is better than the peace of slavery;" yet remember that a nation involved in war is like a vessel in a storm, some∣times plunging into the deep, and sometimes riding on the summit of the wave; but always in the midst of danger. Let our earnest endeavours and our fervent prayers there∣fore be, for the long continuance of the reign of PEACE. How striking the contrast between them! One is the breeze, which diffuses health and pleasure, and happiness around—the other is the storm, which scowls beneath the face of heaven, and hurries with rapid destruction over the earth. One, is the pure and gentle stream, which sweetly murmurs as it flows in various channels, and marks all its course with verdure, fertil∣ity, and beauty—the other is the deluge which has burst every mound; roars direful as it rolls along; and sweeps away
<PB N="21" REF="027169_0021_0FD3931AADEBB8D8"/>flocks, and herds, and houses, and inhabitants, in the up∣roar of confusion, to destruction. The one, surrounded with a shining robe of flowing white, holding high her flourishing olive-branch, and smiling on man with the sweet∣est benignity, stands confest a fair inhabitant of heaven—the other, wrapt in a garb of smoke, and blood, and flames, looks round for objects of revenge, and darting fury from his dragon eye, proves his foul origin from the region of darkness.</P>
<P>O my favored country! May the God of Peace, still con∣tinue to be thy friend; keep from thy sacred retreats and thy shades of freedom, the demon of war, and distinguish thee with the bright reign of happiness and peace! Or if his PROVIDENCE shall suffer the hostile flame again to en∣kindle around thee, may he, as in former days, display the power of his protecting arm, and crown thy efforts with victory, and thy name with glory!</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude, suffer me BROTHERS of the TAMMANY SOCIETY, as inclination and as duty prompt, to offer to you the sentiments of fraternal affection and regard. Within the walls of your wigwam, has my heart often ex∣panded with genuine delight. There innocent pleasure wanders free and unmolested, and smiles on every guest: There, friendship, founded on the purest motives, knits in the firm knot of UNION, the hearts of every true brother: There, the flame of patriotism, kindled by the tongue of eloquence, and the sweet voice of freedom, darts from soul to soul, and illuminates your peacefal hall. And there, if I have any love for my country, any ardor in the cause of liberty, any strong desire for the happiness of mankind, have
<PB N="22" REF="027169_0022_0FD3931DD6A33E08"/>these virtues been, both by precept and example, exalted and refined. May you long, very long be distinguished by every trait which can make you respected as men, and honor∣ed as a society. Let the principles of your institution be deeply engraven on your hearts, and be displayed in all your conduct. You will need no other defence against the attacks of calumny, no other qualification to ensure the praise of virtue.</P>
<P>BROTHERS, keep in mind that you are the UNION in miniature. Many are your fires, but they all burn with∣in the same circle; many are your links, but they all constitute one bright and strong chain. Continually breathe upon your fires the breath of affection: This will not only pre∣vent them from being extinguished, but will keep alive a a pure and gentle flame. Especially, guard against the desperate passion, or the guileful art; that would break asunder the chain, which so happily binds you together: Under their fatal influence, how soon would its strength depart, its links be covered with rust, and its beautiful polish vanish away forever! May you, therefore, be con∣vinced that your happiness as a society, like the glory of your country, depends upon the firmness, and can be secur∣ed only by the stability of UNION. And may time, as it flows equably along, find you continually strengthening in the principles of Liberty, and progressing in the light of Virtue, that you may at length shine in the patriotic hemis∣phere, like a constellation of superior magnitude, with bright and permanent lustre.</P>
<P>BROTHERS, I know you love the fragrant Calumet of Peace, and delight in the happy leisure which tranquillity
<PB N="23" REF="027169_0023_0FD3936F4E815548"/>affords. I know you love to wander beneath the shade of the wide spreading Oak, and to pluck the in∣spiring cluster from the arms of the vine. But I know you also love FREEDOM, and will never resign her but in death. Shew yourselves, then, worthy of this celestial visitant, by obeying her laws, and defending her rights. Let not the "engines of tyranny ever extinguish," nor all the floods of war drown the bright flame which burns in your breasts. But, when your country calls, display your principles by the UNION of your efforts, and by the energy of your action. See that your quivers be well supplied with the keen-pointed arrow, and let the twang of your bows sound dreadful. The warlike tomahawk, you have with pleasure, "buried deep" beneath the floor of your wigwam; with heroism fly to "unbury it" and, raise it high for the stroke, "when your country's good requires it;" And see how many patriots yet remain, "who have been tried on the rough edge of battle when it raged;" whose arm is yet strong, and whose souls yet glow for their country! See also the numerous bands of generous youths, who already breathe deliberate valor, and who burn to be led on to the contest of glory!</P>
<P>IF WAR shall invade our territory, and we must draw again the keenly tempered sword of freedom, let it be grasp∣ed by the strong hand, and wielded with all the energy of the UNION. It shall then sweep down whole ranks of slaves, and flashing rapidly over their hosts, throw them into terror and defeat. Our laws shall flourish, our rights be never more invaded, and our glory endure while the sun rolls round the world, and the GREAT SPIRIT walks on the tops of the mountains. Freedom so often victorious, shall at length entirely demolish the throne of despotism,
<PB N="24" REF="027169_0024_0FD39324D552D8D8"/>cause the thunders of war to be heard no more, and inspire ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH with UNI∣TED hearts, to raise the universal hymn to PEACE, to HAPPINESS and to LIBERTY.</P>
