<P><HI>AS</HI> the present state of our funds will not conveniently admit of our publishing at once, the four volumes of these admirable Sermons, we have judged it most prudent to furnish the purchasers with one or two volumes at a time; assuring them that we intend not to stop, till we have presented them with the whole set.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Sermons contain the sub∣stance of what I have been preaching, for between eight and nine years last past▪ During that time I have frequently spoken in publick, on every subject in the ensuing collection: And I am not conscious, that there is any one point of doctrine, on which I am accustomed to speak in public, which is not here, incidentally, if not professedly laid before every Christian Reader. Every serious man, who peruses these will there∣fore see in the clearest manner, what those doctrines are which I embrace and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the essentials of true religion.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="ii" REF="028060_0004_0FD689CB4F7A14F8"/>
2. But I am thoroughly sensible, these are not proposed, in such a manner as some may expect. Nothing here appears in an elaborate, elegant, or oratorical dress. If it had been my desire or design to write thus, my leisure would not permit. But in truth I at present designed nothing less; for I now write (as I generally speak) <HI>ad populum:</HI> To the bulk of mankind, to those who nei∣ther relish nor understand the art of speak∣ing: But who notwithstanding are compe∣tent judges of those truths, which are neces∣sary to present and future happiness. I mention this, that curious readers may spare themselves the labour of seeking for what they will not find.</P>
<P N="3">3. I design plain truth for plain people. Therefore of set purpose I abstain from all nice and philosophical speculations, from all perplext and intricate reasonings; and as far as possible, from even the shew of learn∣ing, unless in sometimes citing the original scriptures. I labour to avoid all words which are not easy to be understood, all which are not used in common life: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd in particular, those kind of technical terms, that so frequently occur in bodies of divini∣ty, those modes of speaking which men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reading are intimately acquainted with, but which to common people are an unknown
<PB N="iii" REF="028060_0005_0FD689CE0291B700"/>tongue. Yet I am not assured, that I do not sometimes slide into them unawares: It is so extremely natural to imagine, that a word which is familiar to ourselves, is so to all the world.</P>
<P N="4">4. Nay, my design is, in some sense to forget all that ever I have read in my life. I mean to speak, in the general, as if I had never read one author, antient or modern (always excepting the inspired.) I am per∣suaded, that on the one hand, this may be a means of enabling me more clearly to ex∣press the sentiments of my heart, while I sim∣ply follow the chain of my own thoughts, without entangling myself with those of other men: And that, on the other, I shall come with fewer weights upon my mind, with less of prejudice and prepossession, either to search for myself, or to deliver to others, the naked truths of the gospel.</P>
<P N="5">5. To candid, reasonable m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> I am not afraid to lay open what have been the inmost thoughts of my heart. I have thought, "I am a creature of a day, passing thro' life, as an arrow through the air. I am a Spirit, come from GOD, and returning to GOD: Just hovering over the Great Gulph; till a few moments hence, I am no more seen: I drop into an unchangeable eternity! I want
<PB N="iv" REF="028060_0006_0FD689D5F0394A88"/>to know one thing, the way to Heaven: How to land safe on that happy shore. GOD himself has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ondescended to teach the way; for this very end he came from Hea∣ven. He hath written it down in a book. O give me that book! At any price give me the book of GOD! I have it; Here is know∣ledge enough for me. Let me be <HI>Homo unius libri.</HI> Here then I am, far from the busy ways of men. I sit down alone: Only GOD is here. In his presence I open, I read his book; for this end, to find the way to Heaven. Is there a doubt concerning the meaning of what I read? Does any thing appear dark <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> intricate? I lift up my heart to the Father of lights. "Lord, is it not thy word, <HI>If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of</HI> GOD? Thou <HI>givest liberally and upbraidest not;</HI> Thou hast said, <HI>If any be willing to do thy will, he shall know.</HI> I am willing to do. Let me know thy will." I then search af∣ter and consider parallel passages of scrip∣ture, <HI>comparing Spiritual things with Spirit∣ual.</HI> I meditate thereon, with all the atten∣tion and earnestness of which my mind is capable. If any doubt still remain, I consult those who are experienced in the things of GOD: And then, the writings whereby be∣ing dead, they yet speak. And what I thus learn, that I teach.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="v" REF="028060_0007_0FD689DAC7420840"/>
6. I have accordingly set down in the fol∣lowing Sermons, what I find in the bible concerning the way to Heaven; with a view to distinguish this way of GOD, from all those which are the inventions of men. I have endeavoured to describe the true, the scriptural, experimental religion, so as to omit nothing which is a real part thereof, and to add nothing thereto which is not. And herein it is more especially my desire, first, to guard those who are just setting their faces toward Heaven, (and who having lit∣tle acquaintance with the things of GOD, are the more liable to be turned out of the way) from formality, from me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> outside re∣ligion, which has almost driven heart-reli∣on out of the world: And secondly, To warn those who know the religion of the heart, the faith which worketh by love, left at any time they make void the law thro' faith, and so fall back into the snare of the Devil.</P>
<P N="7">7. By the advice and at the request of some of my friends, I have prefixt to the other sermons contained in this volume, three sermons of my own and one of my Brother's, preached before the University of <HI>Oxford.</HI> My design requi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed some discour∣ses on those heads. And I preferred these before any others, as being a stronger an∣swer
<PB N="vi" REF="028060_0008_0FD689DDA8CBCD48"/>than any which can be drawn up now, to those who have frequently asserted,— "That we have changed our doctrine of late, and do not preach now, what we did some years ago." Any man of understand∣ing may now judge for himself, when he has compared the latter with the former Ser∣mons. But some may say, I have mistaken the way myself, altho' I take upon me to teach it to others. It is possible, many will think this, and it is very probable, that I have. But I trust, whereinsover I have mis∣taken, my mind is open to conviction. I sincerely desire to be better informed. I say to GOD and man, "What I know not, teach thou me!"</P>
<P N="9">9. Are you persuaded, you see more clear∣ly than me? It is not unlikely that you may. Then, treat me, as you would desire to be treated yourself upon a change of circum∣stances. Point me out a better way than I have yet known. Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> me it is so, by plain proof of scripture. And if I linger in the path I have been accustomed to tread, and therefore unwilling to leave, labour with me a little, take me by the hand, and lead me as I am able to bear. But be not displeased if I entreat you, not to beat me down, in or∣der to quicken my pace: I can go but feebly and slowly at best; then, I should not be
<PB N="vii" REF="028060_0009_0FD689DF1A9A6108"/>able to go at all. May I not request of you further, not to give me hard names, in or∣der to bring me into the right way? Sup∣pose I was ever so much in the wrong. I doubt this would not set me right. Rather, it would make me run so much the farther from you, and so get more and more out of the way.</P>
<P N="10">10. Nay, perhaps, if you are angry, so shall I be too; and then there will be small hopes of finding the truth. If once anger a∣rise, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (as <HI>Homer</HI> somewhere expresses it) this smoke will so dim the eyes of my soul, that I shall be able to see nothing clearly. For GOD'S sake, if it be possible to avoid it, let us not provoke one another to wrath. Let us not kindle in each other this fire of Hell; much less, blow it up into a flame. If we could discern truth by that dreadful light, would it not be loss, rather than gain? For how far is love, even with many wrong opinions, to be preferred before truth itself without love? We may die without the knowledge of many truths, and yet be car∣ried into <HI>Abraham</HI>'s bosom. But if we die without love, what will knowledge avail? Just as much as it avails the Devil and his Angels!</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="028060_0010_0FD689E0C9F19010"/>
The GOD of love forbid we should ever make the trial! May he prepare us for the knowledge of all truth, by filling our hearts with all his love, and with all joy and peace in believing.</P>

<HEAD>SALVATION by FAITH. A SERMON PREACHED AT St. MARY'S, <HI>OXFORD,</HI> BEFORE THE UNIVERSITY, On JUNE 18, 1738.</HEAD>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>EPHES. ii. 8.</HI></BIBL>
<P>By Grace ye are saved through Faith.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. ALL the Blessings which GOD hath bestow∣ed upon Man are of his mere Grace, Bounty or Favour: His Free, undeserved Favour; Favour altogether undeserved; Man having no claim to the least of his Mercies. It was free Grace that <HI>formed Man of the Dust of the Ground, and breathed into him a living Soul,</HI> and stamped on that Soul the Image of GOD, and <HI>put all Things under his Feet.</HI> The same Free Grace continues to us at this Day, Life and Breath, and all Things. For there is nothing we are, or have, or do, which can deserve the least Thing at GOD'S Hand. <HI>All our Works thou, O</HI> GOD, <HI>hast wrought in us.</HI> These, therefore, are so many more Instances of Free Mercy: And whatever Righteousness may be found in Man, this is also the Gift of GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. Wherewithal then shall a sinful Man atone for any the least of his Sins? With his own Works? No: Were they ever so many or holy, they are not his own, but GOD'S. But indeed they are all Unholy and Sinful themselves, so that every one of them needs a fresh Atonement. Only corrupt Fruit grows on a corrupt Tree. And his Heart is altogether corrupt and abominable; be∣ing <HI>come short of the Glory of</HI> GOD, the glorious
<PB N="12" REF="028060_0013_0FD689E99B56CB68"/>Righteousness at first impress'd on his Soul, after the Image of his Great Creator. Therefore, hav∣ing nothing, neither Righteousness nor Works to plead, his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s utterly stopt before</HI> GOD.</P>
<P N="3">3. If then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ful Man find Favour with GOD, it is <HI>Grace upon Grace.</HI> If GOD vouchsafe still to pour fresh Blessings upon us, yea, the Greatest of all Blessings, <HI>Salvation;</HI> what can we say to these Things, but <HI>Thanks be unto</HI> GOD <HI>for his Unspeak∣able Gift!</HI> And thus it is. Herein GOD <HI>com∣mendeth his Love toward us, in that while we were yet Sinners, Christ died</HI> to save us. <HI>By Grace then are ye saved through Faith.</HI> Grace is the Source, Faith the Condition, of Salvation.</P>
<P>Now, that we fall not short of the Grace of GOD, it concerns us carefully to enquire,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. What Faith it is through which we are sa∣ved?</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. What is the Salvation which is through Faith?</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. How we may answer some Objections.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. What Faith it is through which we are sa∣ved?</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. And first, It is not barely the Faith of a Heathen. Now GOD requireth of a Heathen to believe, <HI>That</HI> GOD <HI>is; that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him:</HI> and that he is to be sought by <HI>glorifying him as</HI> GOD, <HI>by giving him Thanks</HI> for all Things; and by a careful Practice of Moral Virtue, of Justice, Mercy and Truth toward their Fellow Creatures. A <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Ro∣man</HI> therefore, yea a <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ythi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> or <HI>Indian,</HI> was with∣out Excuse if he did not believe thus much. The Being and Attributes of GOD, a future State
<PB N="13" REF="028060_0014_0FD689EEE27EAC58"/>of Reward and Punishment, and the obligatory Nature of Moral Virtue. For this is barely the Faith of a Heathen.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Nor, 2dly, Is it the Faith of a Devil, tho' this goes much farther than that of a Heathen. For the Devil believes, not only, that there is a wise and powerful GOD, Gracious to reward, and Just to punish, but also, that JESUS is the Son of GOD, the CHRIST, the SAVIOUR of the World. So we find him declaring, in express Terms, <HI>Luke</HI> iv. 34. <HI>I know Thee, who Thou art, the Holy One of</HI> GOD. Nor can we doubt but that unhappy Spirit believes all those Words, which came out of the Mouth of the Holy One; yea, and whatsoever else was written by those Holy Men of old; of two of whom he was compelled to give that glorious Testimony, <HI>These men are the Servants of the most high</HI> GOD, <HI>who shew unto you the Way of Salvation.</HI> Thus much then the great Enemy of GOD and Man believes, and trembles in believing, That GOD <HI>was made manifest in the Flesh;</HI> That he will <HI>tread all Enemies under his Feet,</HI> and that <HI>all Scripture was given by Inspi∣ration of</HI> GOD. Thus far goeth the Faith of a Devil.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Faith through which we are saved, in that Sense of the Word which will here∣after be explained, is not barely that which the <HI>Apostles</HI> themselves had while CHRIST was yet upon Earth; tho' they so believed on him as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>leave all and follow him;</HI> altho' they had then Power to work Miracles, to <HI>heal all manner of Sickness, and all Manner of Disease;</HI> yea, they had then <HI>Power and Authority over all Devils:</HI> And which is beyond all this, were sent by their Master to <HI>preach the Kingdom of</HI> GOD.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="14" REF="028060_0015_0FD689F24E770890"/>
4. What Faith is it then through which we are saved? It may be answered, first, in general, It is a Faith in CHRIST; CHRIST, and GOD through CHRIST, are the proper Object of it. Herein therefore, it is sufficiently, absolutely, distinguished from the Faith either of ancient or modern Heathens. And from the Faith of a De∣vil, it is fully distinguished by this, It is not barely a Speculative, Rational Thing, a cold, lifeless Assent, a Train of Ideas in the Head; but also a Disposition of the Heart. For thus saith the Scripture, <HI>With the Heart, Man believeth unto Righteousness.</HI> And, <HI>If thou shalt confess with thy Mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe with thy</HI> Heart, <HI>that</HI> GOD <HI>hath raised Him from the Dead, thou shalt be saved.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. And herein does it differ from that Faith which the Apostles themselves had while our Lord was on Earth, that it acknowledges the Necessity and Merit of his Death, and the Power of his Re∣surrection. It acknowledges his death as the only sufficient Means of redeeming Man from Death Eternal; and his Resurrection as the Restoration of us all to Life and Immortality: Inasmuch as <HI>he was delivered for our Sins, and rose again for our Justification.</HI> Christian Faith is then, not only an Assent to the whole Gospel of CHRIST, but also a full Reliance on the Blood of CHRIST, a Trust in the Merits of his Life, Death, and Re∣surrection; a Recumbency upon him as our atone∣ment and our Life; <HI>as given for us,</HI> and <HI>living in us.</HI> It is a sure Confidence which a Man hath in GOD, that through the Merits of CHRIST, <HI>his</HI> Sins are forgiven, and <HI>he</HI> reconciled to the Favour of GOD; and in consequence hereof, a closing with him, and cleaving to him, as <HI>our Wisdom▪
<PB N="15" REF="028060_0016_0FD689F4F1398448"/>Righteousness, Sanctification, Redemption,</HI> or in one Word our <HI>Salvation.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="2">II. What Salvation it is, which is through this Faith, is the second Thing to be considered.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. And first, Whatsoever else it imply, it is a Present Salvation. It is something attainable, yea, actually attained on Earth, by those who are Par∣takers of this Faith. For thus saith the Apostle to the Believers at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and in them to the Be∣lievers of all Ages, not Ye shall be (tho' that also is true) but <HI>ye</HI> are <HI>saved through Faith.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Ye are saved</HI> (to comprize all in one Word) from Sin. This is the Salvation which is through Faith. This is that great Salvation foretold by the Angel, before GOD brought his first begotten into the World, <HI>Thou shalt call his Name</HI> JESUS, <HI>for he shall save his People from their Sins.</HI> And neither here, nor in other Parts of Holy Writ, is there any Limitation or Restriction. All his People, or, as it is elsewhere expressed, all that believe in him, he will save from all their Sins; from Original and Actual, Past and Present Sin, of the Flesh and of the Spirit. Through Faith that is in him, they are saved both from the Guilt and from the Power of it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. First from the Guilt of all Past Sin. For whereas <HI>all the World is guilty before</HI> GOD; inso∣much that should he <HI>be extreme to mark what is done amiss, there is none that could abide it:</HI> And whereas <HI>by the Law is only the Knowledge of Sin,</HI> but no Deliverance from it; so that <HI>by fulfilling the Deeds of the Law, no Flesh can be justified in his Sight: Now the Righteousness of</HI> GOD, <HI>which is by Faith of</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>is manifested unto all that believe.</HI> Now <HI>they are justified freely by
<PB N="16" REF="028060_0017_0FD689F4F7499080"/>his Grace, through the Redemption that is in</HI> JESUS CHRIST. <HI>Him</HI> GOD <HI>hath set forth to be a Propi∣tiation through Faith in his Blood; To declare his Righteousness for</HI> (or by) <HI>the Remission of the Sins that are past.</HI> Now hath CHRIST <HI>taken away the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us.</HI> He hath <HI>blotted out the Hand-writing that was against us, taking it out of the Way, nailing it to his Cross. There is therefore no Condemnation now, to them which</HI> believe <HI>in</HI> CHRIST JESUS.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. And being saved from Guilt, they are saved from Fear. Not indeed from a filial Fear of of∣fending, but from all servile Fear, from that <HI>Fear which hath Torment,</HI> from Fear of Punish∣ment, from Fear of the Wrath of GOD; whom they now no longer regard as a severe Master, but as an indulgent Father. <HI>They have not received again the Spirit of Bondage; but the Spirit of adop∣tion, whereby they cry, Abba, Father: The Spirit it∣self also bearing Witness with their Spirits, that they are the Children of</HI> GOD. They are also saved from the Fear, tho' not from the Possibility, of falling away from the Grace of GOD, and com∣ing short of the great and precious Promises: They are <HI>sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise, which is the Earnest of their Inheritance.</HI> (Eph. i. 13.) Thus have they <HI>Peace with</HI> GOD <HI>through our Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST. <HI>They rejoice in Hope of the Glory of</HI> GOD. <HI>And the love of</HI> GOD <HI>is shed abroad in their Hearts, through the Holy Ghost, which is given unto them.</HI> And hereby they are <HI>persuaded</HI> (tho' perhaps not all at all Times, nor with the same Fulness of Persuasion) that <HI>neither Death nor Life, nor Things present, nor Things to come, nor Heighth nor Depth, nor any other Creature, shall be able to separate them from
<PB N="17" REF="028060_0018_0FD689F659B7B5B0"/>the Love of</HI> GOD <HI>which is in</HI> CHRIST JESUS <HI>our Lord.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Again, through this Faith they are saved from the Power of Sin, as well as from the Guilt of it. So the Apostle declares. <HI>Ye know that he was manifested to take away our Sins, and in him is no Sin. Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not.</HI> (Chap. iii. 5, &amp;c.) Again, <HI>Little Children, let no Man de∣ceive you.—He that committeth Sin is of the Devil.— Whosoever believeth is born of</HI> GOD. <HI>And whosoever is born of</HI> GOD <HI>doth not commit Sin, for his Seed re∣maineth in him: And he cannot Sin, because he is born of</HI> GOD. Once more, <HI>We know that Whatsoever is born of</HI> God <HI>sinneth not: But he that is begotten of</HI> God, <HI>keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not,</HI> Chap. v. 18.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. He that is by Faith born of God, sinneth not,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. By any habitual Sin: For all habitual Sin, is Sin reigning. But Sin cannot reign in any that believeth. Nor,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. By any wilful Sin, for his Will, while he abideth in the Faith is utterly set against all Sin, and abhorreth it as deadly Poison. Nor,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. By any sinful Desire; for he continually desireth the Holy and Perfect Will of God; and any Tendency to an Unholy Desire, he by the Grace of God, stifleth in the Birth. Nor,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4, Doth he sin by Infirmities, whether in Act, Word, or Thought. For his Infirmities have no Concurrence of his Will; and without This they are not properly Sins. Thus, <HI>He that is born of</HI> God <HI>doth not commit Sin.</HI> And tho' he cannot say, <HI>He hath not sinned,</HI> yet now, <HI>he sin∣neth not.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. This then is the Salvation which is through Faith, even in the present World: A Salvation from Sin, and the Consequences of Sin, both often expressed in the Word <HI>Justification;</HI> which, taken
<PB N="18" REF="028060_0019_0FD689F7DF9A8BB0"/>in the largest Sense, implies, A Deliverance from Guilt and Punishment, by the Atonement of CHRIST actually applied to the Soul of the Sin∣ner now believing on him, and a Deliverance from the whole Body of Sin through CHRIST <HI>formed in his Heart.</HI> So that he who is thus justi∣fied or saved by Faith, is indeed <HI>born again.</HI> He is <HI>born again of the Spirit</HI> unto a new <HI>Life, which is hid with Christ in</HI> God. <HI>He is a new Creature: Old Things are past away: All Things in him are become new.</HI> And as a <HI>new-born Babe he gladly receives the</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>sincere Milk of the Word, and grows thereby: Going on in the Might of the Lord his</HI> God, <HI>from Faith to Faith, from Grace to Grace, until at Length he come unto a perfect Man, unto the Measure of the Stature of the Fulness of Christ.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="3">III. The first usual Objection to this is,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That to preach Salvation or Justification by Faith only, is to preach against Holiness and Good Works. To which a short Answer might be given: It would be so, if we spake, as some do, of a Faith which was separate from these. But we speak of a Faith which is not so, but necessarily productive of all Good Works and all Holiness.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. But it may be of use to consider it more at large: Especially since it is no new Objection, but as old as St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Time; for even then it was asked, <HI>Do we not make void the Law through Faith?</HI> We answer, first, All who preach not Faith, do manifestly make void the Law; either directly and grosly by Limitations and Comments, that eat out all the Spirit of the Text: Or indirectly, by not pointing out the only Means whereby it is possible to perform it. Whereas, secondly, <HI>We establish
<PB N="19" REF="028060_0020_0FD689F95AD4D9C8"/>the Law;</HI> both by shewing its full Extent, and Spiritual Meaning: And by calling all to that living Way, whereby <HI>the Righteousness of the Law may be fulfilled in them.</HI> These, while they trust in the Blood of CHRIST alone, use all the Ordi∣nances which he hath appointed, do all the <HI>Good Works which he had before prepared that they should walk therein,</HI> and enjoy and manifest all holy and heavenly Tempers, even the same <HI>Mind that was in</HI> Christ Jesus.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. But does not preaching this Faith lead Men into Pride? We answer, Accidentally it may. Therefore ought every Believer to be earnestly cau∣tioned, (in the Words of the Great Apostle) <HI>Be∣cause of Unbelief, the first Branches were broken off; and thou standest by Faith. Be not high minded, but fear. If</HI> God <HI>spared not the Natural Branches, take heed lest he spare not Thee. Behold, therefore, the Goodness and Severity of</HI> God! <HI>On them which fell, Severity: But towards thee, Goodness: If thou continue in his Goodness; otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</HI> And while he continues therein, he will remember those Words of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> foresee∣ing and answering this very Objection, (<HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 27) <HI>Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what Law? Of Works? Nay; but by the Law of Faith.</HI> If a Man were justified by his Works, he would have whereof to glory. But there is no glorying for him, <HI>that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the Ungodly,</HI> (Rom. iv.) To the same Effect, are the Words both preceed∣ing and following the Text, (<HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 4, &amp;c.) God, <HI>who is rich in Mercy,—even when we were dead in Sins, hath quickened us together with</HI> Christ, <HI>(by Grace ye are saved) — that he might slew the exceeding Riches of his Grace, in his Kind∣ness
<PB N="20" REF="028060_0021_0FD689FADD0B2670"/>towards us through</HI> Christ Jesus. <HI>For by Grace ye are saved through Faith. And that not of yourselves.</HI> Of yourselves cometh neither your Faith nor your Salvation. <HI>It is the Gift of</HI> God; the free, undeserved Gift, the Faith thro' which ye are saved, as well as the Salvation, which he of his own good Pleasure, his mere Favour, an∣nexes thereto. That ye believe, is one Instance of his Grace; that believing ye are saved, another. <HI>Not of Works, lest any Man should boast.</HI> For all our Works, all our Righteousness, which were before our Believing, merited nothing of God but Condemnation. So far were they from de∣serving Faith; which therefore, whenever given, is not <HI>of Works.</HI> Neither is Salvation of the Works we do when we believe. For <HI>it is</HI> then God <HI>that worketh in us.</HI> And therefore, that he giveth us a Reward for what he himself worketh, only commendeth the Riches of his Mercy, but leaveth us nothing whereof to glory.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. However, may not the speaking thus of the Mercy of God, as saving or justifying freely by Faith only, encourage Men in Sin? Indeed it may and will; many <HI>will continue in Sin that Grace may abound.</HI> But their Blood is upon their own Head. The Goodness of God ought to lead them to Repentance, and so it will those who are sincere of Heart. When they know there is yet Forgiveness with him, they will cry aloud that he would blot out their Sins also, thro' Faith which is in Jesus. And if they earnestly cry, and faint not, if they seek him in all the Means he hath appointed, if they refuse to be comforted till he come, <HI>he will come and will not tarry.</HI> And he can do much Work in a short Time. Many are the Examples in the Acts of the Apostles, of
<PB N="21" REF="028060_0022_0FD68A029F0EE998"/>God's shedding abroad this Faith in Men's Hearts, even like Lightning falling from Heaven. So in the same Hour that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> began to preach, the Jailor <HI>repented, believed, and was baptized:</HI> As were three Thousand by St. <HI>Peter</HI> on the Day of Pentecost, who all repented and believed at his first Preaching. And blessed be God, there are now many living Proofs, that he is still <HI>mighty to save.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Yet to the same Truth, placed in another View, a quite contrary Objection is made: <Q>If a Man cannot be saved by all that he can do, this will drive Men to Despair.</Q> True, to despair of being saved by their own Works, their own Merits or Righteousness. And so it ought; for none can trust in the Merits of Christ, till he has utterly renounced his own. He that <HI>goeth about to establish his own Righteousness,</HI> can∣not receive the Righteousness of God. The Righteousness which is of Faith cannot be given him, while he trusteth in that which is of the Law.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. But this, it is said, is an uncomfortable Doctrine. The Devil spoke like himself, that is, without either Truth or Shame, when he dared to suggest to Men that it is such. 'Tis the only comfortable one, 'tis <HI>very full of Comfort,</HI> to all self-destroy'd, self-condemn'd Sinners. That <HI>who∣soever believeth on him shall not be ashamed:</HI> That <HI>the same Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him:</HI> Here is Comfort, high as Heaven, stronger than Death! What! Mercy for all? For <HI>Zaccheus,</HI> a Public Robber? For <HI>Mary Magdalene,</HI> a Common Harlot? Methinks I hear one say, Then I, even I, may hope for Mercy! And so thou may'st, thou afflicted one, whom
<PB N="22" REF="028060_0023_0FD68A03C0A48530"/>none hath comforted! God will not cast out thy Prayer. Nay, perhaps he may say the next Hour, <HI>Be of good cheer, thy Sins are forgiven thee;</HI> so forgiven that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ee no more; yea, and that <HI>the Holy Spirit shall bear witness with thy Spirit that thou art a Child of</HI> God. O glad Tidings! Tidings of great Joy, which are sent unto all People. <HI>Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> every one that thirsteth, come ye to the Waters: Come ye and buy, without Money, and without Price.</HI> What∣soever your Sins be, <HI>though red, like Crimson,</HI> though <HI>more than the Hairs of your Head: Re∣turn ye unto the Lord, and he will have Mercy upon you; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. When no more Objections occur, then we are simply told, That Salvation by Faith only, ought not to be preached as the first Doctrine, or at least not to be preached to All. But what saith the Holy Ghost? <HI>Other Foundation can no Man lay, than that which is laid, even</HI> JESUS CHRIST. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen, <HI>That whosoever believeth on him shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> is and must be the Foundation of all our Preaching; that is, must be preached first. "Well, but not to all." To whom then are we not to preach it? Whom shall we except? The Poor? Nay, they have a peculiar Right to have the Gospel preached unto them. The unlearned? No. God hath revealed these Things unto un∣learned and ignorant Men from the Beginning. The Young? By no Means. <HI>Suffer these</HI> in any wise to <HI>come unto</HI> Christ, <HI>and forbid them not.</HI> The Sinners? Least of all. <HI>He came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance.</HI> Why then, if any, we are to except the Rich, the Learned, the Reputable, the Moral Men. And
<PB N="23" REF="028060_0024_0FD68A04B96ACE88"/>'tis true, they too often except themselves from hearing; yet we must speak the Words of our Lord. For thus the Tenor of our Commission runs, <HI>Go and preach the Gospel to every Creature.</HI> If any Man wrest it or any Part of it to his De∣struction, he must bear his own Burden. But still, <HI>as the Lord liveth, whatsoever the Lord saith unto us, That we will speak.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>8. At this Time more especially will we speak, That <HI>by Grace ye are saved through Faith:</HI> Be∣cause never was the maintaining this Doctrine more seasonable than it is at this Day. Nothing but this can effectually prevent the Increase of the <HI>Romish</HI> Delusion among us. 'Tis endless to attack one by one, all the Errors of that Church. But Salvation by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> strikes at the Root, and all fall at once where this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s established. It was this Doctrine, (which our Church justly calls <HI>the strong Rock and Fountain of the Christian Religion</HI>) that first drove Popery out of these Kingdoms, and 'tis this alone can keep it out. Nothing but this can give a Check to that Immorality, which hath <HI>overspread the Land as a Flood.</HI> Can you empty the great Deep, Drop by Drop? Then you may reform us, by Dissuasives from particular Vices. But let the <HI>Righteousness which is of</HI> God <HI>by Faith</HI> be brought in, and so shall its proud Waves be stayed. Nothing but this can stop the Mouths of those who <HI>glory in their Shame, and openly deny the Lord that bought them.</HI> They can talk as sublimely of the Law, as he that hath it written by God in his Heart. To hear them speak on this Head, might incline one to think, they were not far from the Kingdom of God. But take them out of the Law into the Gospel; begin with the Righteousness of Faith, <HI>with</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="028060_0025_0FD68A061F5FE028"/>Christ, <HI>the End of the Law to every one that believeth:</HI> And those who but now appeared almost, if not altogether Christians, stand con∣fessed the Sons of Perdition; as far from Life and Salvation (God be merciful unto them!) as the Depth of Hell from the Heighth of Heaven.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. For this Reason the Adversary so rages, whenever <HI>Salvation by Faith</HI> is declared to the World. For this Reason did he stir up Earth and Hell, to destroy those who first preached it. And for the same Reason, knowing that Faith alone could overturn the Foundations of his Kingdom, did he call forth all his Forces, and employ all his Arts of Lies and Calumny, to affright that Champion of the Lord of Hosts, <HI>Martin Luther,</HI> from reviving it. Nor can we wonder thereat; for as that Man of God observes, <HI>How would it enrage a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oud strong Man armed, to be stopt and set at naught by a little Child, coming against him with a Reed in his Hand?</HI> Especially, when he knew that little Child would surely overthrow him, and tread him under Foot. <HI>Even so, Lord</HI> Jesus! Thus hath thy Strength been ever <HI>made perfect in W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kness!</HI> Go forth then, thou little Child, that believ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st in him, and <HI>his Right hand shall teach thee terrible Things!</HI> Tho' thou art helpless and weak as an Infant of Days, the strong Man shall not be able to stand before thee. Thou shalt prevail over him, and subdue him, and overthrow him, and trample him under thy Feet. Thou shalt march on under the great Captain of thy Salvation, <HI>conquering and to conquer,</HI> until all thine Enemies are destroyed, and <HI>Death is swallowed up in Vic∣tory.</HI></ITEM>

<P>Almost thou persuadest <HI>me</HI> to be a Christian.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AND many there are who go <HI>thus far:</HI> Ever since the Christian Religion was in the World, there have been many in every Age and Nation, who were <HI>almost persuaded to be Christians.</HI> But seeing it avails nothing before God, to go <HI>only thus far,</HI> it highly imports us to consider,
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>First,</HI> What is implied in being <HI>almost,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> What in being <HI>altogether a Christian.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I.) 1. Now, in the being <HI>almost a Christian</HI> is implied, first Heathen Honesty. No one, I suppose, will make any Question of this; espe∣cially, since by Heathen Honesty here, I mean, not that which is recommended in the Writings of their Philosophers only, but such as the com∣mon Heathens expected of one another, and many of them actually practised. By the Rules of this they were taught, that they ought not to be un∣just; not to take away their Neighbour's Goods, either by Robbery or Theft: Not to oppress the Poor, neither to use Extortion toward any: Not to cheat or over-reach either the Poor or Rich, in whatsoever Commerce they had with them:
<PB N="30" REF="028060_0029_0FD68A0DDB80CD50"/>To defraud no Man of his Right, and, if it were possible to owe no Man any Thing.</P>
<P N="2">2. Again, the common Heathens allowed, that some Regard was to be paid to Truth as well as to Justice. And accordingly, they not only held him in Abomination, who was forsworn, who called God to witness to a Lie; but him also, who was known to be a Slanderer of his Neighbour, who falsely accused any Man. And indeed little better did they esteem wilful Liars of any Sort, ac∣counting them the Disgrace of Human Kind, and the Pests of Society.</P>
<P N="3">3. Yet again, there was a Sort of Love and Assistance, which they expected one from another. They expected whatever assistance any one could give another, without Prejudice to himself. And this they extended, not only to those little Offices of Humanity, which are performed without any Expense or Labour; but likewise, to the Feed∣ing the Hungry, if they had Food to spare, the clothing the Naked, with their own superfluous Raiment; and in general, the giving to any that needed, such Things as they needed not them∣selves. Thus far (in the lowest Account of it) Heathen Honesty went, the first Thing implied in the being <HI>almost a Christian.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II.) 4. A second Thing implied in the being <HI>almost a Christian,</HI> is the having a Form of God∣liness, of that Godliness which is prescribed in the Gospel of Christ: The having the <HI>Outside of a real Christian.</HI> Accordingly, the <HI>Almost Chri∣stian</HI> does nothing which the Gospel forbids. He taketh not the Name of God in vain: He bles∣seth and curseth not; he sweareth not at all, but his Communication is yea, yea; nay, nay. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> profanes not the Day of the Lord, nor suffers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="31" REF="028060_0030_0FD68A0F5E646928"/>to be profaned, even by the Stranger that is within his Gates. He not only avoids all actual Adultery, Fornication, and Uncleanness, but every Word or Look, that either directly or in∣directly tends thereto: Nay, and all idle Words, abstaining both from all Detraction, Backbiting, Tale bearing, Evil speaking, and from <HI>all foolish Talking and Jesting,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a kind of Virtue in the Heathen Moralist's Account. Briefly from all Conversation that is not <HI>good to the Use of edify∣ing,</HI> and that consequently <HI>grieves the Holy Spirit of</HI> God, <HI>whereby we are sealed to the Day of Re∣demption.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. He abstains from <HI>Wine wherein is Excess,</HI> from Revelling and Gluttony. He avoids, as much as in him lies, all Strife and Contention, continually endeavouring to live peaceably with all Men. And if he suffer wrong, he avengeth not himself, neither returns Evil for Evil. He is no Railer, no Brawler, no Scoffer, either at the Faults or Infirmities of his Neighbour. He does not willingly wrong, hurt, or grieve any Man; but in all Things acts and speaks by that plain Rule, <HI>Whatsoever thou wouldst not be should do unto thee, that do not thou to another.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. And in doing Good, he does not confine himself to cheap and easy Offices of Kindness, but labours and suffers for the Profit of many, that by all Means he may help some. In spite of Toil or Pain, <HI>Whatsoever his Hand findeth to do, he doeth it with all his Might:</HI> Whether it be for his Friends, or for his Enemies; for the Evil, or for the Good. For, being <HI>not slothful in this,</HI> or in any <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ness, as he hath Opportunity he doth Good,</HI> all M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>er of Good <HI>to all Men;</HI> and to their Souls as well as their Bodies. He reproves the
<PB N="32" REF="028060_0031_0FD68A10EEED0020"/>Wicked, instructs the Ignorant, confirms the Wavering, quickens the Good, and comforts the Afflicted. He labours to awaken those that sleep, to lead those whom God hath already awakened, to the Fountain opened for Sin and for Uncleanness, that they may wash therein and be clean; and to stir up those who are saved through Faith, to adorn the Gospel of Christ in all Things.</P>
<P N="7">7. He that hath the Form of Godliness, uses also the Means of Grace, yea, all of them, and at all Opportunities. He constantly frequents the House of God; and that not as the Manner of some is, who come into the Presence of the Most High, either loaded with Gold and costly Apparel, or in all the gaudy Vanity of Dress; and either by their unseasonable Civilities to each other, or the impertinent Gaiety of their Behaviour, disclaim all Pretensions to the Form, as well as to the Power of Godliness. Would to God there were none even among ourselves who fall under the same Condemnation: Who come into his House, it may be, gazing about, or with all the Signs of the most listless, careless Indifference, tho' some∣times they may <HI>seem</HI> to use a Prayer to God for his Blessing on what they are entering upon; who during that awful Service, are either asleep or reclined in the most convenient Posture for it; or, as tho' they supposed God was asleep, talk∣ing with one another, or looking round, as utter∣ly void of Employment. Neither let these be ac∣cused of the Form of Godliness. No; he who has even this, behaves with Seriousness and At∣tention, in every Part of that solemn Service. More especially when he approaches the Table of the Lord, it is not with a light or careless <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>a∣viour, but with an Air, Gesture and Deportment
<PB N="33" REF="028060_0032_0FD68A1580C00440"/>which speaks nothing else, but <HI>God be merciful to me a Sinner.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. To this if we add, the constant Use of Fa∣mily-Prayer, by those who are Masters of Families, and the setting Times apart for private Addresses to God, with a daily Seriousness of Behaviour: He who uniformly practises this Outward Religion, has the Form of Godliness. There needs but One Thing more in order to his being <HI>almost a Christian,</HI> and that is, Sincerity.</P>
<P N="3">III.) 9. By Sincerity, I mean, a real, inward Principle of Religion, from whence these outward Actions flow. And indeed, if we have not this, we have not Heathen Honesty; no, not so much of it as will answer the demand of a <HI>Heathen, Epi∣curean Poet.</HI> Even this poor Wretch, in his sober Intervals, is able to testify,
<Q><L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Good Men avoid Sin from the Love of Virtue: Wicked Men avoid Sin from a Fear of Punishment.</NOTE> Oderunt peccare boni, virtutis amore;</L>
<L>Oderunt peccare mali, formidine poenae.</L></Q>
So that if a Man only abstains from doing Evil, in order to avoid Punishment,
<Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Thou shalt not be hang'd.</NOTE> Non pasces in cru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e corvos,</Q>
saith the Pagan; there, <HI>Thou hast thy Reward.</HI> But even he will not allow such a harmless Man as this, to be so much as a <HI>good Heathen.</HI> If then any Man, from the same Motive, <HI>viz.</HI> to avoid Punishment, to avoid the Loss of his Friends, or his Gain, or his Reputation, should not only ab∣stain
<PB N="34" REF="028060_0033_0FD68A1882AF2DF8"/>from doing evil, but also do ever so much Good, yea, and use all the Means of Grace; yet we could not with any Propriety say, This Man is even <HI>almost a Christian.</HI> If he has no better Principle in his Heart, he is only a Hypocrite al∣together.</P>
<P N="10">10. Sincerity therefore is necessarily implied in the being <HI>almost a Christian:</HI> A real Design to serve God, a hearty Desire to do his Will: It is ne∣cessarily implied, that a Man have a sincere View of pleasing God in all Things: In all his Conver∣sation; in all his Actions; in all he does, or leaves undone. This Design, if any Man be <HI>al∣most a Christian,</HI> runs through the whole Tenor of his Life. This is the moving Principle both in his doing Good, his abstaining from Evil, and his using the Ordinances of God.</P>
<P N="11">11. But here it will probably be enquired, Is it possible that any Man living, should go so far as this, and nevertheless be <HI>only almost a Christian?</HI> What more than this can be implied, in the being <HI>a Christian altogether?</HI> I answer, first, That it is possible to go thus far, and yet be but <HI>almost a Christian;</HI> I learn not only from the Oracles of God, but also from the sure Testimony of Expe∣rience.</P>
<P N="12">12. Brethren, Great is <HI>my Boldness towards you in this Behalf.</HI> And <HI>forgive me this Wrong,</HI> if I declare my own Folly upon the House-top, for yours and the Gospel's Sake. Suffer me then to speak freely of myself, even as of another Man. I am content to be abased, so ye may be exalted, and to be yet more vile, for the Glory of my Lord.</P>
<P N="13">13. I did go thus far for many Years, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of this Place can testify: Using Diligence to eschew
<PB N="35" REF="028060_0034_0FD68A1B177416E0"/>all Evil, and to have a Conscience void of Offence: Redeeming the Time, buying up every Oppor∣tunity of doing all Good to all Men; constantly and carefully using all the Public and all the Pri∣vate Means of Grace; endeavouring after a steady Seriousness of Behaviour, at all Times and in all Places: And God is my Record, before whom I stand, doing all this in Sincerity; having a real Design to serve God, a hearty Desire to do his Will in all Things, to please him who had called me to <HI>fight the good Fight,</HI> and to <HI>lay hold of eternal Life.</HI> Yet my own Conscience beareth me Wit∣ness in the Holy Ghost, that all this Time I was but <HI>almost a Christian.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. If it be enquired, what more than this is implied in the being <HI>altogether a Christian?</HI> I an∣swer,</P>
<P N="1">I.) 1. First, The Love of God. For thus saith his Word, <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy</HI> God, <HI>with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind, and with all thy Strength:</HI> Such a Love of God is this, as engrosses the whole Heart, as takes up all the Affections, as fills the entire Capacity of the Soul, and employs the ut∣most Extent of all its Faculties. He that thus loves the Lord his God, his Spirit continually <HI>rejoiceth in</HI> God <HI>his Saviour.</HI> His <HI>Delight</HI> in <HI>in the Lord, his</HI> Lord and his All, to whom <HI>in every Thing he giveth Thanks. All</HI> his <HI>Desire is unto</HI> God, <HI>and the Remembrance of his Name.</HI> His Heart is ever crying out, <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but Thee, and there is none upon Earth that I desire beside Thee.</HI> Indeed, what can he desire beside God? Not the World, or the Things of the World. For he is <HI>crucified to the World, and the
<PB N="36" REF="028060_0035_0FD68A1C996CD9A0"/>World crucified to him.</HI> He is crucified to the Desire of the Flesh, the Desire of the Eye, and the Pride of Life. Yea, he is dead to Pride of every Kind: For <HI>Love is not puffed up;</HI> but he that dwelleth in Love <HI>dwelleth in God, and God in him,</HI> is less than nothing in his own Eyes.</P>
<P N="2">II.) 2. The Second Thing implied in the be∣ing <HI>altogether a Christian</HI> is, The Love of our Neighbour. For thus said our Lord in the fol∣lowing Words, <HI>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thyself.</HI> If any Man ask who is my Neighbour, we reply, Every Man in the World; every Child of his, who is <HI>the Father of the Spirits of all Flesh.</HI> Nor may we in any wise except our Ene∣mies, or the Enemies of God and their own Souls. But every Christian loveth these also as himself, yea, <HI>as Christ loved us.</HI> He that would more fully understand what Manner of Love this is, may consider St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Description of it. It is, <HI>long suffering and kind. It envieth not. It is not rash or hasty in judging. It is not puffed up,</HI> but maketh him that loves, the least, the Servant of all. Love <HI>doth not behave itself unseemly,</HI> but <HI>becometh all Things to all Men.</HI> She <HI>seeketh not her own,</HI> but only the Good of others, that they may be saved. Love <HI>is not provoked.</HI> It casteth out Wrath, which he who hath, is not <HI>made perfect in Laws.</HI> It <HI>thinketh no Evil.</HI> It <HI>rejoiceth not in Ini∣quity, but rejoiceth in the Truth.</HI> It <HI>cove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth all Things believeth all Things, hopeth all Things, endu∣reth all Things.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. 3. There is yet one Thing more that may be separately considered, tho' it cannot actually be separate from the preceding, which is im∣plied in the being <HI>altogether a Christian.</HI> And
<PB N="37" REF="028060_0036_0FD68A1E56FE17D8"/>that is the Ground of All, even Faith. V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry ex∣cellent Things are spoken of this throughout the Oracles of God. <HI>Every one,</HI> saith the beloved Disciple, <HI>that believeth, is born of</HI> God. <HI>To as many us received him, gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</HI> And, <HI>this is the Victory that overcometh the World, even our Faith.</HI> Yea, our Lord himself declares, <HI>He that believeth in the Son hath everlasting Life; and co∣meth not into Condemnation, but is passed from Death unto Life.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. But here let no Man deceive his own Soul. "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Homily on the Salvation of Man.</NOTE> It is diligently to be noted, the Faith which bringeth not forth Repentance and Love, and all good Works, is not that right living Faith which is here spoken of, but a dead and devilish one. For even the Devils believe that Christ was born of a Virgin, that he wrought all kinds of Miracles, declaring himself very God: That for our Sakes he suffered a most painful Death, to redeem us from Death everlasting: That he rose again the third Day; that he ascended into Hea∣ven, and sitteth at the Right Hand of the Fa∣ther, and at the End of the World, shall come a∣gain to judge both the Quick and Dead. These Articles of our Faith the Devils believe, and so they believe all that is written in the Old and New Testament. And yet for all this Faith, they be but Devils. They remain still in their damnable Estate, lacking the very true Christian Faith."</P>
<P N="5">5. "The right and true Christian Faith is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o go on in the Words of our own Church, not on∣ly to believe that holy Scripture, and the Articles of our Faith are true, but also to have a sure
<PB N="38" REF="028060_0037_0FD68A2302DDEEB8"/>Trust and Confidence, to be saved from ever∣lasting Damnation by Christ. It is a sure Trust and Confidence which a Man hath in God, that by the Merits of Christ his Sins <HI>are</HI> forgiven, and he reconciled to the Favour of God,—whereof doth follow a loving Heart, to obey his Com∣mandments."</P>
<P N="6">6. Now, whosoever has this Faith, which <HI>pu∣rifies the Heart,</HI> by the Power of God, who <HI>dwelleth therein,</HI> from Pride, Anger, Desire, <HI>from all Unrighteousness,</HI> from <HI>all Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit,</HI> whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fills it with Love stronger than Death, both to God and to all Mankind; Love that doth the Works of God, glorying to spend and to be spent for all Men, and that endureth with Joy, not only the Reproach of Christ, the being mocked, despised, and hated of all Men, but whatsoever the Wisdom of God permits the Malice of Men or Devils to inflict; whoso∣ever has this <HI>Faith,</HI> thus <HI>working by Love,</HI> is not <HI>almost only, but altogether a Christian.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. But who are the living Witnesses of these Things? I beseech you, Brethren, as in the Pre∣sence of that God, before whom <HI>Hell and De∣struction are without a Covering: How much more the Hearts of the Children of Men?</HI> That ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h of you would ask his own Heart, "Am I of that Number? Do I so far practise Justice, Mercy and Truth, as even the Rules of Heathen Honesty require? If so, have I the very <HI>Outside</HI> of a Christian? The Form of Godliness? Do I abstain from Evil, from whatsoever is forbidden in the written word of God? Do I, whatever Good my Hand findeth to do, do it with my Might? Do I seriously use all the Ordinances of
<PB N="39" REF="028060_0038_0FD68A2784EC9AD8"/>God at all Opportunities? And is all this done, with a sincere Design and Desire to please God in all Things?</P>
<P N="8">8. Are not many of you conscious, that you never came thus far: That you have not been even <HI>almost a Christian?</HI> That you have not come up to the Standard of Heathen Honesty? At least, not to the Form of Christian Godli∣ness? Much less hath God seen Sincerity in you, a real Design of pleasing him in all Things. You never so much as intended, to devote all your Words and Works, your Business, Studies, Di∣versions, to his Glory. You never even de∣signed or desired, that whatsoever you did, should be <HI>done in the Name of the Lord Jesus,</HI> and, as such, should be <HI>a spiritual Sacrifice, acceptable to God through Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. But supposing you had, Do good Designs and good Desires make a Christian? By no Means, unless they are brought to good Effect. <Q>Hell is paved, saith one, with good Inten∣tions.</Q> The great Question of all then still remains. Is the Love of God shed abroad in your Heart? Can you cry out, <Q>My God and my All?</Q> Do you desire nothing but him? Are you happy in God? Is he your Glory, your Delight, your Crown of Rejoicing? And is this Commandment written in your Heart, That he who loveth God loves his Brother also? Do you then love your Neighbour as yourself? Do you love every Man, even your Enemies, even the Enemies of God, as your own Soul? As Christ loved you? Yea, dost thou believe that Christ loved <HI>thee,</HI> and gave himself for thee? Hast thou Faith in his Blood? Believest thou the
<PB N="40" REF="028060_0039_0FD68A28A170CA80"/>Lamb of God hath taken away <HI>thy</HI> Sins, and cast them as a Stone into the Depth of the Sea? That he hath blotted out the Hand-writing that was against <HI>thee,</HI> taking it out of the Way, nailing it to his Cross? Hast <HI>thou</HI> indeed Redemption through his Blood, even the Remission of <HI>thy</HI> Sins? And doth his Spirit bear witness with <HI>thy</HI> Spirit, that thou art a Child of God?</P>
<P N="10">10. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who now standeth in the Midst of us, knoweth that if any Man die without this Faith and this Love, good it were for him that he had never been born. Awake then, thou that sleep∣est, and call upon thy God: Call in the Day when he may be found. Let him not rest, till he <HI>make his Goodness to pass before thee, till he proclaim unto thee the Name of the Lord. She Lord, the Lord</HI> God, <HI>merciful and gracious, long suffering, and abundant in Goodness and Truth; keeping Mercy for thousands, forgiving Iniq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry and Transgression and Sin.</HI> Let no Man persuade thee by vain Words, to rest short of this Prize of thy high Calling. But cry unto him Day and Night, who, <HI>while we were with∣out Strength, died for the Ungodly,</HI> until thou knowest in whom thou hast believed, and canst say, "My Lord and my God." Remember, <HI>always to pray and not to faint,</HI> till thou also canst lift up thy Hand unto Heaven, and declare to him that liveth for ever and ever, "Lord, Thou knowest all Things, Thou knowest that I love Thee."</P>
<P N="11">11. May we all thus experience what it is, to be not almost only, but altogether Christians!
<PB N="41" REF="028060_0040_0FD68A2A76F559E8"/>Being justified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Jesus: Knowing we have Peace with God through Jesus Christ: Rejoic∣ing in Hope of the Glory of God, and having the the Love of God shed abroad in our Hearts, by the Holy Ghost given unto us!</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>EPHES. V. 14.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the Dead, and Christ shall give thee Light.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN discoursing on these Words, I shall, with the Help of God,
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>First,</HI> Describe the Sleepers to whom they are spoken.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> Enforce the Exhortation, <HI>Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the Dead.</HI> And,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Explain the Promise made to such as do <HI>awake</HI> and <HI>arise; Christ shall give the Light.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I.)
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. And first, as to the Sleepers here spoken to. By Sleep is signified the Natural State of Man: That deep Sleep of the Soul into which the Sin of <HI>Adam</HI> hath cast all who spring from his Loins; that Supineness, Indolence, and Stupi∣dity, that Insensibility of his real Condition, where∣in every Man comes into the World, and con∣tinues till the Voice of God awakes him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Now <HI>they that sleep, sleep in the Night.</HI> The State of Nature is a State of utter Dark∣ness; a State wherein <HI>Darkness covers the Earth, and gross Darkness the People.</HI> The poor una∣wakened Sinner, how much Knowledge soever he may have as to other Things, has no Know∣ledge
<PB N="46" REF="028060_0043_0FD68A350DB56A28"/>of himself: In this Respect, <HI>he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.</HI> He knows not that he is a fallen Spirit, whose only Business in the present World, is to recover from his Fall, to regain that Image of God wherein he was created. He sees <HI>no Necessity</HI> for <HI>the one Thing needful,</HI> even that inward universal Change, that <HI>Birth from above</HI> (figured out by Baptism) which is the Beginning of that total Renovation, that Sanctification of Spirit, Soul and Body, <HI>without which no Man shall see the Lord.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Full of all Diseases as he is, he fancies himself in perfect Health: Fast bound in Misery and Iron, he dreams that he is happy, and at Li∣berty. He says, Peace, Peace, while the Devil, <HI>as a strong Man armed,</HI> is in full Possession of his Soul. He sleeps on still, and takes his Rest, tho' Hell is moved from beneath to meet him; tho' the Pit, from whence there is no Return, hath opened its Mouth to swallow him up: A Fire is kindled around him, yet he knoweth it not; yea it burns him, yet he lays it not to Heart.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. By one who sleeps we are therefore to un∣derstand (and wou'd to God we might all un∣derstand it!) A Sinner satisfied in his Sins; con∣tented to remain in his fallen State, to live and die without the Image of God: One who is ig∣norant both of his Disease, and of the only Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dy for it: One who never was warned, or never regarded the warning Voice of God <HI>to flee from the Wrath to come:</HI> One that never yet saw he was in Danger of Hell-fire, or cried out in the Earnestness of his Soul, <HI>What must I do to be saved?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="47" REF="028060_0044_0FD68A361B0CED40"/>
5. If this Sleeper be not Outwardly vicious, his Sleep is usually the deepest of all: Whether he be of the <HI>Laodician</HI> Spirit, <HI>neither cold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hot;</HI> but a quiet, rational, inoffensive; good natured Professor of the Religion of his Fathers; or whe∣ther he be Zealous and Orthodox, and <HI>after the most straitest Sect of our Religion, live a Pharisee;</HI> that is according to the Scriptural Account, one that <HI>justifies himself;</HI> one that labours <HI>to establish his own Righteousness,</HI> as the Ground of his Accept∣ance with God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. This is he, who <HI>having a Form of Godli∣ness, denies the Power thereof;</HI> yea, and pro∣bably reviles it, wheresoever it is found, as mere Extravagance and Delusion. Mean while, the wretched Self-deceiver thanks God, that he <HI>is not as other Men are; Adulterers, Unjust, Ex∣tortioners:</HI> No, he doth no Wrong to any Man. He <HI>fasts twice in a Week,</HI> uses all the Means of Grace, is constant at Church and Sacrament: Yea, and <HI>gives Tythes of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll that he has,</HI> does all the Good that he can: <HI>Touching the Righteousness of the Law,</HI> he is <HI>blameless:</HI> He wants nothing of Godliness but the Power; nothing of Religion, but the Spirit; nothing of Christianity, but the Truth and the Life.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. But know ye not, that however highly esteemed among men, <HI>such a Christian</HI> as this may be, he is an Abomination in the Sight of God, and an Heir of every Woe, which the Son of God Yesterday, To-day, and for ever, de∣nounces against <HI>Scribes and Pharisees, Hypo∣crites?</HI> He hath <HI>made clean the Outside of the Cup and the Platter,</HI> but within is full of all Filthiness. <HI>An evil Disease cleaveth</HI> still <HI>unto him,</HI> so that <HI>his inward Parts are very Wicked∣ness.</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="028060_0045_0FD68A3A141A1670"/>Our Lord fitly compares him to a <HI>painted Sepulchre,</HI> which <HI>appears <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>;</HI> but nevertheless is <HI>full of dead Mens Bones, and of all Uncleanness.</HI> The Bones indeed are no lon∣ger dry; <HI>the Sinews and Flesh are come upon them, and the Skin covers them above:</HI> But <HI>there is no Breath</HI> in them, no Spirit of the living God. And <HI>if any Man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. Ye are Christ's, if so be that the Spirit of</HI> God <HI>dwell in you.</HI> But if not, God knoweth that ye abide in death, even until now.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. This is another Character of the Sleeper here spoken to. He abides in Death, tho' he knows it not. He is dead unto God, <HI>dead in Trespasses and Sins.</HI> For, <HI>to be carnally minded is Death.</HI> Even as it is written, <HI>By one Man Sin entered into the world, and death by Sin: And so Death passed upon all Men,</HI> not only temporal Death, but likewise Spiritual and Eternal. <HI>In that Day that thou eatest</HI> (said God to <HI>Adam</HI>) <HI>Thou shalt surely die.</HI> Not bodily (unless as he then became Mortal) but spiritually: Thou shalt lose the Life of thy Soul: Thou shalt die to God; shalt be separated from him, thy essential Life and Happiness.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. Thus first was dissolved the Vital Union of our Soul with God: Insomuch that <HI>in the midst of</HI> natural <HI>Life, we are</HI> now <HI>in</HI> spiritual <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath.</HI> And herein we remain till the second <HI>Adam</HI> becomes a quickening Spirit to us, till he raises the Dead, the Dead in Sin, in Pleasure, Riches, or Honours. But before any dead Soul can live, he <HI>hears</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to) <HI>the Voice of the Son of</HI> God: He is made sensible of his lost e∣state, and receives the Sentence of Death in him∣self.
<PB N="49" REF="028060_0046_0FD68A3B6FD3D1F8"/>He knows himself to be <HI>dead while he liveth,</HI> dead to God, and all the Things of God: Hav∣ing no more Power to perform the Actions of a living Christian, than a dead Body to perform the Functions of a living Man.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. And most certain it is, that one dead in Sin, has not <HI>Senses exercised to discern</HI> spiritual <HI>Good and Evil. Having Eyes, he sees not, he hath Ears and hears not.</HI> He doth not <HI>taste and see that the Lord is gracious.</HI> He <HI>hath not se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> God <HI>at any Time,</HI> nor <HI>heard his Voice,</HI> nor <HI>handled the Word of Life.</HI> In vain is the Name of Jesus <HI>like Ointment poured forth,</HI> and <HI>all his Garments smell of Myrrh, Aloes and Cassia.</HI> The Soul that sleepeeth in Death hath no Per∣ception of any Objects of this Kind. His Heart is <HI>past feeling,</HI> and understandeth none of these Things.</ITEM>
<ITEM>11. And hence having no Spiritual Senses, no Inlets of Spiritual Knowledge, the Natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God; nay, he is so far from receiving them, that what∣soever is spiritually discerned is mere Foolishness unto him. He is not content with being utterly ignorant of Spiritual Things, but he denies the very Existence of them. And Spiritual Sensation itself is to him, the Foolishness of Folly. <HI>How,</HI> saith he, <HI>Can these Things be?</HI> How can any Man <HI>know,</HI> that he is alive to God? Even as you know, that your Body is now alive. Faith is the Life of the Soul: And if ye have this Life abiding in you, ye want no Mark to evidence it <HI>to yourself,</HI> but that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that divine Consciousness, that <HI>Witness of</HI> God, which is more and greater than ten thousand Human Wit∣nesses.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="50" REF="028060_0047_0FD68A3BB358E1D8"/>
12. If he doth not now bear Witness with thy Spirit, that thou art a Child of God, O that he might convince Thee, Thou poor una∣wakened Sinner, by his Demonstration and Pow∣er, that Thou art a Child of the Devil! O that as I prophecy, there might now be <HI>a Noise and a Shaking,</HI> and may <HI>the Bones come together, Bone to his Bone.</HI> Then <HI>come from the four Winds, O Breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live!</HI> And do not ye harden your Hearts, and resist the Holy Ghost, who eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> now is come to <HI>convince</HI> you <HI>of Sin, because you believe not on the Name of the only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of</HI> God.</ITEM>

<P N="2">II.)
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Wherefore, <HI>Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the Dead.</HI> God calleth Thee now by my Mouth; and bids Thee know thyself, Thou fallen Spirit, thy true State and only Con∣cern below. <HI>What meanest Thou, O Sleeper? Arise! Call upon thy</HI> God, <HI>if so be thy</HI> God <HI>will think upon Thee, that thou perish not.</HI> A mighty Tempest is stirred up round about Thee, and thou art sinking into the Depths of Perdition, the Gulf of God's Judgments. If thou wouldest escape them, cast thyself into them. <HI>Judge thyself,</HI> and thou shalt <HI>not be judged of the Lord.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Awake, awake! Stand up this Moment, lest Thou <HI>drink at the Lord's Hand the Cup of his Fury.</HI> Stir up thyself <HI>to l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> held on the Lord, the Lord thy Righteousness, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey to save! Shake thyself from the Dust.</HI> At least, let the Earthquake of God's Threatening shake Thee. Awake and cry out with the trembling Gaoler, <HI>What must I do to be saved?</HI> And never rest, till Thou believest on the Lord Jesus, with a
<PB N="51" REF="028060_0048_0FD68A415F1A0940"/>Faith which is his Gift, by the Operation of his Spirit.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. If I speak to any one of you more than to another, it is to Thee, who thinkest thyself un∣concerned in this Exhortation. <HI>I have a Mes∣sage from</HI> God <HI>unto Thee.</HI> In his Name, I <HI>warn</HI> Thee <HI>to flee from the Wrath to come.</HI> Thou un∣holy Soul, see thy Picture in condemned <HI>Peter,</HI> lying in the Dark Dungeon, between the Soldiers, bound with two Chains, the Keepers before the Door keeping the Prison. The Night is far spent, the Morning is at hand, when thou art to be brought forth to Execution. And in these dread Circumstances, Thou art fast asleep; Thou art fast asleep in the Devil's Arms, on the Brink of the Pit, in the Jaws of everlasting Destruction.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. O may <HI>the Angel of the Lord come upon Thee,</HI> and <HI>the Light shine into thy Prison!</HI> And mayst Thou feel the Stroke of an Almighty Hand, raising. Thee with <HI>Arise up quickly, gird thyself and bind on thy Sandals, cast thy Garment about Thee, and follow me.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Awake, Thou everlasting Spirit, out of thy Dream of Worldly Happiness. Did not God create Thee for Himself? Then, thou canst not rest, till th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> restest in him. Return thou Wan∣derer. Fly back to thy Ark. <HI>This is not thy Home.</HI> Think not of building Tabernacles here. Thou art but <HI>a Stranger, a Sojourner upon Earth:</HI> A Creature of a Day, but just launching out into an Unchangeable State. Make haste. Eternity is at hand. Eternity depends on this Moment. An Eternity of Happiness, or an Eternity of Misery!</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="52" REF="028060_0049_0FD68A43AAF62F28"/>
6. In what State is thy Soul? Was God, while I am yet speaking, to require it of Thee, art Thou ready to meet Death and Judgment? Canst Thou stand in his Sight, <HI>who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity?</HI> Art Thou <HI>meet to be Partaker of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light?</HI> Hast Thou <HI>fought a good Fight and kept the Faith?</HI> Hast Thou secured <HI>the one Thing Needful?</HI> Hast Thou recovered the Image of God, even <HI>Righ∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ness and true Holiness?</HI> Hast Thou <HI>put off the Old Man and put on the New?</HI> Art Thou <HI>cloathed upon with Christ?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Hast Thou Oil in thy Lamp? Grace in thy Heart? Dost Thou <HI>love the Lord thy</HI> God, <HI>with all thy Heart, and with all thy Mind, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Strength?</HI> Is <HI>that Mind in Thee, which was also in Christ Jesus?</HI> Art Thou a Christian indeed? That is, a new Creature? Are <HI>old Things past away, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Things become new?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>8. Art Thou <HI>a Partaker of the Divine Nature? Knowest thou not, that Christ is in Thee, except Thou be Reprobate?</HI> Knowest Thou, that God <HI>dwelleth in Thee, and Thou in</HI> God, <HI>by his Spi∣rit which he hath given Thee?</HI> Knowest Thou not, that <HI>thy Body is a Temple of the Holy Ghost, which Thou hast of</HI> God? Hast Thou the <HI>Witness in thyself? The Earnest of thine Inheritance?</HI> Art Thou <HI>sealed by that Spirit of Promise, unto the Day of Redemption?</HI> Hast Thou <HI>received the Holy Ghost—</HI> or dost thou start at the Question, not knowing whether there be any Holy Ghost?</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. If it offends Thee, be Thou assured, that Thou neither art a Christian, nor desirest to be One. Nay, thy very <HI>Prayer is turned into Sin;</HI> and Thou hast solemnly mocked God this very
<PB N="53" REF="028060_0050_0FD68A43B1F0E980"/>Day, by praying for <HI>the Inspiration of his Holy Spi∣rit,</HI> when Thou didst not believe there was any such Thing to be received.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. Yet on the Authority of God's Word and our own Church, I must repeat the Question, <HI>Hast thou received the Holy Ghost?</HI> If Thou hast not, Thou art not yet a Christian. For a Christian is a Man, that is <HI>anointed with the Holy Ghost, and with Power.</HI> Thou art not yet made a Par∣taker of pure Religion and undefiled. Dost Thou know, what Religion is? That it is, a Participa∣tion of the Divine Nature, the Life of God in the Soul of Man: <HI>Christ formed in the Heart, Christ in thee, the Hope of Glory.</HI> Happiness and Holi∣ness; Heaven begun upon Earth. <HI>A Kingdom of</HI> God <HI>within thee: Not Meat and Drink,</HI> no outward Thing: <HI>but Righteousness and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost?</HI> An everlasting Kingdom brought into thy Soul, a <HI>Peace of</HI> God, <HI>that passeth all Understanding;</HI> a <HI>Joy unspeakable and full of Glory?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>11. Knowest Thou, that <HI>in Jesus Christ, neither Circumcision availeth any Thing, nor Uncir∣cumcision; but Faith that Worketh by Love;</HI> but a New Creation? Seest Thou the Necessity of that Inward Change, that Spiritual Birth, that Life from the Dead? That Holiness? And art Thou thoroughly convinced, that <HI>without it, no Man shall see the Lord?</HI> Art thou labouring af∣ter it? <HI>Giving all Diligence, to make thy Call∣ing and Election sure? Working out thy Salvation with Fear and Trembling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Agonizing to enter in at the straight Gate?</HI> Art Thou <HI>in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nest</HI> about thy Soul? And, canst Thou tell the Searcher of Hearts, <HI>Thou O</HI> God, <HI>art the thing that I long for!</HI> Lord, Thou knowest all Things! Thou knowest that I <HI>would</HI> love Thee!</ITEM>

12. Thou hopest to be saved—but what Rea∣son hast Thou to give of the Hope that is in Thee? Is it because thou hast done no Harm? Or, because Thou hast done much Good? Or because Thou art not like other Men; but Wise, or Learned, or Honest and morally Good? Esteemed of Men, and of a Fair Reputation! Alas, all this will never bring Thee to God. It is in his Account lighter than Vanity. Dost Thou <HI>know Jesus Christ whom he hath sent?</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th he taught Thee, that <HI>by Grace we are saved through Faith? And that, not of ourselves: It is the Gift of</HI> God: <HI>Not of Works, lest any Man should boast.</HI> Hast Thou received the faith∣ful Saying as the whole Foundation of thy Hope, <HI>that Jesus Christ came into the World to save Sinners?</HI> Hast Thou learned what that meaneth, <HI>I came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance? I am not sent, but to the lost Sheep?</HI> Art Thou (He that heareth, let him understand!) Lost, Dead? <HI>Damned already?</HI>—Dost Thou know thy Deserts? Dost thou feel thy Wants? Art thou <HI>poor in Spirit? Mourning</HI> for God and refusing to be comforted? Is the Prodigal <HI>come to himself,</HI> and well-content to be therefore thought <HI>beside himself;</HI> by those who are still feeding upon the Husks which he hath left? Art Thou willing to <HI>live Godly in Christ Jesus?</HI> And dost thou therefore <HI>suffer Persecution?</HI> Do <HI>Men say all Manner of Evil against thee falsely, for the Son of Man's Sake?</HI></ITEM>

This is <HI>that falling away</HI> which was to come: that general Apostacy, of all Orders and Degrees of Men, which we even now find to have overspread the Earth. <HI>Run to and fro in the Streets of Jerusalem, and see if ye can find a Man;</HI> a Man that loveth the Lord his God with all his Heart, and serveth him with all his Strength? How does our own Land mourn (that to look no farther) under the Over∣flowings of Ungodliness? What Villainies of every Kind are committed Day by Day; yea, too often with Impunity, by those who sin with a high Hand, and glory in their Shame? Who can reckon up the Oaths, Curses, Profaneness, Blasphemies, the Lying, Slandering, Evil-speak∣ing, the Sabbath-breaking, Gluttony, Drunken∣ness, Revenge, the Whoredoms, Adulteries, and various Uncleanness, the Frauds, Injustice, Op∣pression, Extortion, which overspread our Land as a Flood?</ITEM>

And even among those who have kept themselves pure from these grosser Abominations; how much Anger and Pride, how much Sloth and Idleness, how much Softness and Effeminacy, how much Luxury and Self-Indulgence, how much Covetousness and Ambition, how much Thirst of Praise, how much Love of the World, how much Fear of Man is to be found? Mean while, how little of true Religion? For where is he that loveth either God or his Neighbour, as He hath.

On the one Hand are those, who have not so much as the Form of Godliness: On the other those who have the Form only; there stands the <HI>Open,</HI> there the <HI>Painted</HI> Sepulchre. So that in very Deed, who∣soever were earnestly to behold any publick ga∣thering together of the People, (I fear, those in our Churches are not to be excepted) might ea∣sily perceive, <HI>that the one Part were Sadduces, and the other Pharisees:</HI> The one having almost as little Concern about Religion, as if there were <HI>no Resurrection, neither Angel nor Spirit;</HI> and the other making it a mere lifeless Form, a dull Round of external Performances, without either true Faith, or the Love of God, or Joy in the Holy Ghost.</ITEM>

Corrupt are we also and abominable; and few are there that understand any more, few that worship God in Spirit and in Truth.

<P>I design to close these Considerations with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> plain practical Application.</P>
<P N="1">1. And first, let us consider Christianity in its Rise, as beginning to exist in Individuals.</P>
<P>Suppose then one of those who heard the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> preaching <HI>Repentance and Remission of Sins,</HI> was <HI>pricked to the Heart,</HI> was convinced of Sin, repented, and then <HI>believed in Jesus.</HI> By this <HI>Faith of the Operation of God,</HI> which was the very <HI>Substance</HI> or Subsistence <HI>of Things hoped for,</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi. 1.</NOTE> the demonstrative <HI>Evidence of invisible Things,</HI> he instantly <HI>received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby he</HI> now <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied Abba, Father!</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 15.</NOTE> Now first it was that he coul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>call Jesus Lord by the Holy Gh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xii. 3.</NOTE> <HI>the Spirit itself bearing Witness with his Spirit that he was a Child of God.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 15.</NOTE> Now it was that he could truly say, <HI>I live not, but Christ liveth in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;
<PB N="68" REF="028060_0064_0FD68A61A10D1710"/>and the Life which I now live in the Flesh, I live by Faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. ii. 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">2. This then was the very Essence of his Faith, a divine <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Evidence or Conviction.</NOTE> of the Love of God the Father, through the Son of his Love, to him a Sinner, now <HI>accepted in the Beloved.</HI> And<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 1.</NOTE> <HI>being justified by Faith, he had Peace with God,</HI> yea <HI>the Peace of God ruling in his Heart:</HI> A Peace which <HI>possing all Understanding,</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, all barely rational Con∣ception) <HI>kept his Heart and Mind</HI> from all Doubt and Fear, through the <HI>Knowledge of him in whom he had believed.</HI> He could not therefore <HI>be afraid of any evil Tidings; for his Heart stood fast be∣lieving in the Lord.</HI> He feared not what Man could do unto him, knowing <HI>the very Hairs of his Head were all numbered.</HI> He feared not all the Powers of Darkness, whom God was daily <HI>bruising under his Feet.</HI> Least of all was he afraid to die; nay, he <HI>desired to depart and be with Christ</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Phil. i. 23.</NOTE>; who<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Heb. 2.15.</NOTE> <HI>through Death had destroyed him that had the Power of Death even the Devil and delivered them who through Fear of Death, were all their Life time,</HI> till then, <HI>subject to Bondage.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul</HI> therefore <HI>magnified the Lord, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Spirit rejoiced in God his Saviour. He rejoiced in him with joy unspeakable, who had reconciled him to God even the Father: In whom he had Re∣demption through his Blood, the Forgiveness of Sins.</HI> He rejoiced in that <HI>Witness of God's Spirit with his Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> that he was a Child of God:</HI> And more abundantly, <HI>in Hope of the Glory of God,</HI> in Hope of the Glorious image of God, and full <HI>Renewal of his Soul in Righteousness and true Holiness;</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="028060_0065_0FD68A689AEFE3A8"/>and in Hope of that <HI>Crown of Glory,</HI> that <HI>Inhe∣ritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Love of God</HI> was also <HI>shed abroad in his Heart, by the Holy Ghost which was given unto him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Because he was a Son, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into his Heart, crying, Abba, Father!</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 6.</NOTE> And that filial Love of God was con∣tinually increased by the <HI>Witness he had in himself,</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 John v. 10.</NOTE> of God's pardoning Love to him, by <HI>beholding what Manner of Love it was, which the Father had bestowed upon him, that he should be called a Child of God</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 John iii. 1.</NOTE> So that God was the Desire of his Eyes, and the Joy of his Heart; his Portion in Time and in Eternity.</P>
<P N="5">5. He that thus <HI>loved God,</HI> could not but <HI>love his Brother also;</HI> and <HI>not in Word only, but in Deed and in Truth. "If God,</HI> said he, <HI>so loved us, we ought also to love one another</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 John iv. 11.</NOTE>." Yea, every Soul of Man, as the <HI>Merey</HI> of God <HI>is over all his Works</HI><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxlv. 9.</NOTE>. Agreeably hereto, the Af∣fection of this Lover of God, embraced all Mankind for his Sake; not excepting those whom he had never seen in the Flesh, or those of whom he knew nothing more than that they were <HI>the Offspring of God;</HI> for whose Souls his Son had died; not excepting the <HI>Evil</HI> and <HI>Un∣thankful,</HI> and least of all his Enemies, those who <HI>hated, or persecuted, or despitefully used</HI> him for his Master's sake. These had a peculiar Place both in his Heart and his Prayers. He loved them <HI>even as Christ loved us.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. And <HI>Love is not puffed up</HI><NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiii. 4.</NOTE>. It abases to the Dust every Soul wherein it dwells. Accord∣ingly
<PB N="70" REF="028060_0066_0FD68A6AE61728E0"/>he was <HI>lowly of Heart,</HI> little, mean, and vile in his own Eyes. He neither sought nor re∣ceived the <HI>Praise of Men, but that which cometh of God only.</HI> He was meek and long-suffering, gentle to all, and easy to be intreated. Faith∣fulness and Truth never forsook him; they were <HI>bound about his Neck, and wrote on the Table of his Heart.</HI> By the same Spirit he was enabled to be <HI>temperate i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all Things, refraining his Soul even as a weaned Child.</HI> He was <HI>crucified to the World, and the World crucified to him:</HI> Superior to <HI>the De∣sire of the Flesh, the Desire of the Eye, and the Pride of Life.</HI> By the same Almighty Love was he saved, both from Passion and Pride, from Lust and Vanity, from Ambition and Covetousness, and from every Temper which was not in Christ.</P>
<P N="7">7. It may easily be believed, he who had this Love in his Heart, would <HI>work no Evil to his Neighbour.</HI> It was impossible for him, knowing∣ly and designedly, to do Harm to any Man. He was at the greatest Distance from Cruelty and Wrong, from any unjust or unkind Action. With the same Care did he <HI>set a Watch before his Mouth, and keep the Door of his Lips;</HI> lest he should offend in Tongue, either against Justice, or against Mer∣cy or Truth. He <HI>put away all Lying,</HI> Falsehood and Fraud; neither was <HI>Guile found in his Mouth.</HI> He <HI>spake Evil of no Man;</HI> nor did an unkind Word ever come out of his Lips.</P>
<P N="8">8. And as he was deeply sensible of the Truth of that Word, <HI>without me ye can do nothing,</HI> and consequently, of the Need he had to be <HI>water'd</HI> of God <HI>every Moment;</HI> so he <HI>continued dady</HI> an all the Ordinances of God, the stated Channels of his Grace to Man. <HI>In the Apostle's Doctrine</HI> or Teaching, receiving that Food of the Soul with

And thus he daily <HI>grew in Grace,</HI> increasing in Strength, in the Knowledge and Love of God.</P>
<P N="9">9. But it did not satisfy him, barely to abstain from doing Evil. His Soul was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-thirst to do Good. The Language of his Heart conti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ally was, <HI>My Father worketh Hitherto, and I wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> My Lord <HI>went about doing Good;</HI> and shalt not<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>tread in his Steps? As</HI> he <HI>had Opportunity</HI> therefore, if he could do no Good of a higher Kind, he fed the Hungry, clothed the Naked, helped the Fatherless or Stranger, visited and assisted them that were Sick or in Prison. He <HI>gave all his Goods to feed the Poor.</HI> He rejoiced to labour or to suffer for them, and wherein soever he might profit another, there especially to <HI>deny himself.</HI> He counted nothing too dear to part with for them, as well remem∣bering the Word of his Lord, <HI>Insomuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my Brethren, ye have done it unto me</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxv. 40.</NOTE></P>
<P N="10">10. Such was <HI>Christianity</HI> in its Rise. Such was a Christian in ancient Days. Such was every one of those, who <Q>when they heard the Threaten∣ings of the Chief Priests and Elders, lift up their Voice to God with one Accord, and were all filled with the Holy Ghost. The Multitude of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that believed, were of one Heart and of one Soul.</Q> (So did the Love of Him in whom they had believed, constrain them to love one another.) <Q>Neither said any of them that ought of the Things which he pos∣sessed was his own; but they had all Things com∣mon.</Q> So fully were they crucified to the World,
<PB N="72" REF="028060_0068_0FD68A6DA1D89CA0"/>and the World crucified to them. <Q>And they con∣tinued steadfastly with one Accord in the Apostles Doctrine, and in the Breaking of Bread, and in Prayer. And great Grace was upon them all; nei∣ther was there any among them that lacked: For as many as were Possessors of Lands or Houses sold them, and brought the Prices of the Things that were sold, and laid them down at the Aposties Feet; and Distribution was made unto every M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> according as he had need<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts iv. 31—35.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="2">II. 1. Let us take a View, in the second Place, of this <HI>Christianity,</HI> as spreading from one to ano∣ther, and so gradually making its Way into the World. For such was the Will of God concern∣ing it, who <Q>did not light a Candle to put it under a Bushel, but that it might give Light to all that were in the House.</Q> And this our Lord had de∣clared to his first Disciples, <Q>Ye are the Salt of the Earth, the Light of the World;</Q> at the same Time that he gave that general Command, <Q>Let your Light so shine before Men, that they may see your good Works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Matt. v. 13, 14, 15, 16.</NOTE></Q>.</P>
<P N="2">2. And, indeed, supposing a few of these Lovers of Mankind, to see <HI>the whole World lying in Wick∣edness,</HI> Can we believe they would be unconcern∣ed at the Sight, at the Misery of those for whom their Lord died? Would not their Bowels yearn over them, and their Hearts <HI>melt away for very Trouble?</HI> Could they then stand idle all the Day long, even were there no Command from him whom they loved? Rather would they not labour, by all possible Means, to <HI>pluck</HI> some of <HI>these Brands out of the Burning?</HI> Undoubtedly they
<PB N="73" REF="028060_0069_0FD68A6F8C43D4E0"/>would: They would spare no Pains to bring back whomsoever they could of those poor <Q>Sheep that had gone astray, to the great Shepherd and Bi∣shop of their Soul<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 25.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. So the Christians of old did. They labour∣ed, having Opportunity,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gal. vi. 10.</NOTE> <HI>to do good unto all Men,</HI> warning them to <HI>flee from the Wrath to come,</HI> now, now, to escape <HI>the Damnation of Hell.</HI> They declared,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 30.</NOTE> <HI>The Times of Ignorance God winked at; but now he calleth all Men every where to repent.</HI> They cried aloud, <HI>Turn ye, turn ye from your Evil Ways; so Iniquity shall not be your Ruin</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xviii. 30.</NOTE>. They<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiv. 25.</NOTE> <HI>reasoned</HI> with them <HI>of Temperance and Righteousness,</HI> or Justice, of the Virtues op∣posite to their reigning Sins, and <HI>of Judgment to come,</HI> of the Wrath of God which would surely be executed on Evil Doers in that Day when he should judge the World.</P>
<P N="4">4. They endeavoured herein to speak to every Man severally as he had need. To the Careless, to those who lay unconcerned in Darkness and in the Shadow of Death, they thundred, <Q>Awake thou that sleepest; arise from the Dead, and Christ shall give thee Light:</Q> But to those who were already awakened out of Sleep, and groan∣ing under a Sense of the Wrath of God, their Language was, <Q>We have an advocate with the Father; he is the Propitiation for our Sins.</Q> Meantime those who had believed, they <Q>provoked to Love and to good Works; to patient Continu∣ance in Well-doing; and to abound more and more in that Holiness, without which no Man can see the Lord<NOTE N="§§" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 14.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="74" REF="028060_0070_0FD68A709AA209F8"/>
5. And their Labour was not in vain in the Lord. His <HI>Word ran and was glorified.</HI> It <HI>grew mightily and prevailed.</HI> But so much the more did offences prevail also. The World in general were offended, <HI>because they testified of it, that the Works thereof were evil</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John vii. 7.</NOTE>. The Men of Pleasure were offended, not only because these Men were <HI>made,</HI> as it were, <HI>to reprove their Thoughts.</HI> (<HI>He professeth,</HI> said they, <HI>to have the Knowledge of God: He calleth himself the Child of the Lord: His Life is not like other Mens; his Ways are of another Fashion: He abstaineth from our Ways, as from Filthiness: He maketh his Boast that God is his Father</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Wisd. i. 13, 14, 15, 16.</NOTE>.) But much more, because so many more of their Companions were taken away, and would no more <HI>run with them to the same Excess of Riot</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">I Pet. iv. 4.</NOTE>. The Men of Reputaion were offended, because, as the Gos∣pel spread, they declined in the Esteem of the People; and because many no longer dared to <HI>give them flattering Titles,</HI> or to pay Man the Homage due to God only. The Men of Trade called one another together, and said,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Acts xix. 25, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Sirs, ye know that by this Craft we have our Wealth. But ye see and hear that these Men have persuaded and turned away much People. So that this our Craft is in Danger to be set at nought.</HI> Above all, the Men of Religion, so called, the Men of <HI>Outside</HI> Religion, "the Saints of the World," were offended and ready at every Opportunity to cry out,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiv. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Men of Israel, Help! we have found these Men!

<P N="6">6. Thus it was that the Heavens grew black with Clouds, and the Storm gathered amain. For the more Christianity spread, <HI>the more Hurt was done,</HI> in the Account of those who received it not, and the Number increased of those who were more and more enraged at these<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Men who</HI> thus <HI>turned the World upside down;</HI> insomuch that they more and more cried out, <HI>Away with such fellows from the Earth; it is not fit that they should live,</HI> yea, and sincerely believed, that <HI>whosoever</HI> should <HI>kill them, would do</HI> God <HI>Service.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Mean while they did not fail to<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Luke vi. 22.</NOTE> <HI>cast out their Name as evil:</HI> So that this<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Acts xxxviii. 22.</NOTE> <HI>Sect was eve∣ry where spoken against.</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Matt. v. 11, 37, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Men said all Manner of Evil of them,</HI> even as had been done of the <HI>Prophets that were before them.</HI> And whatsoever any would affirm, others would believe. So that offences grew as the Stars of Heaven for Mul∣titude. And hence arose, at the Time fore-or∣dained of the Father, Persecution in all its Forms. Some, for a Season, suffered only Shame and Reproach; some, <HI>the Spoiling of their Goods;</HI> some <HI>had Trial of Mocking and Scourging,</HI> some <HI>of Bonds and Imprisonment;</HI> and others <HI>resisted unto Blood.</HI><NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 34—xi.</NOTE></P>
<P N="8">8. Now it was that the Pillars of Hell were shaken, and the Kingdom of God spread more and more. Sinners were every where <HI>turned from
<PB N="76" REF="028060_0072_0FD68A7C01682B20"/>Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto</HI> God. He gave his Children, <HI>such a Mouth, and such Wisdom, as all their Adversaries could not resist.</HI> And their Lives were of Equal Force with their Words. But, above all, their Suffer∣ings spake to all the World. They <HI>approved them∣selves</HI> the Servants of God, <HI>in Afflictions, in Ne∣cessities; in Distresses; in Stripes, in Imprisonments, in Tumults, in Labours; in Perils in the Sea, in Pe∣rils in the Wilderness; in Weariness and Painfulness, in Hunger and in Thirst, in Cold and Nakedness.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. vi. 4. &amp;c.</NOTE> And when having <HI>fought the good fight,</HI> they were <HI>led as Sheep to the Slaughter, and offered up on the Sacrifice and Service of their Faith,</HI> then the Blood of each found a Voice, and the Heathen owned, <HI>He being dead, yet speaketh.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Thus did <HI>Christianity</HI> spread itself in the Earth. But how soon did the Tares appear with the Wheat? And the <HI>Mystery of Iniquity</HI> work as well, as the <HI>Mystery of Godliness!</HI> How soon did Satan find a Seat, even <HI>in the Temple of God!</HI> Till <HI>the Woman fled in the Wilderness, and the Faithful were</HI> again <HI>minished from the Children of Men.</HI> Here we tread a beaten Path: The still increasing Corruptions of the succeeding Ge∣nerations, have been largely described from Time to Time, by those Witnesses God raised up, to shew that he had <HI>built his Church upon a Rock, and the Gates of Hell should not</HI> wholly <HI>prevail against her.</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Matt. xvi. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">III. I. But shall we not see greater Things than these? Yea, greater than have been yet from the Beginning of the World. Can Satan
<PB N="77" REF="028060_0073_0FD68A7D5A857D60"/>cause the Truth of God to fail, or his Pro∣mises to be of none Effect? If not, the Time will come, when <HI>Christianity</HI> will prevail over all, and cover the Earth. Let us stand a little, and survey (the third Thing which was proposed) this strange Sight, a <HI>Christian World</HI> <Q>Of this the Prophet of old enquired and searched dili∣gently:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I Pet. i. 10, 11, &amp;c.</NOTE> Of this the Spirit which was in them testified, It shall come to pass in the last Days, that the Mountain of the Lord's House shall be established in the Top of the Mountains, and shall be exalted above the Hills, and all Nations shall flow unto it. And they shall beat their Swords into Plough-shares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks. Nation shall not lift up Sword against Nation; neither shall they learn War any more.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa. ii. 2, 4.</NOTE> In that Day there shall be a Root of Jesse, which shall stand for an Ensign of the People. To it shall the Gentiles seek, and his Rest shall be glo∣rious. And it shall come to pass in that Day, that the Lord shall set his hand again to recover the Remnant of his People; and he shall set up an Ensign for the Nations, and shall assemble the Outcasts of Israel, and gather together the Dis∣persed of Judah, from the four Corners of the Earth.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Isa. xi. 10, 11, 12.</NOTE>' 'The Wolf shall then dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard shall lie down with the Kid: And the Calf and the young Lion and the Fatling together; and a little Child shall lead them. They shall not hurt nor destroy, saith the Lord, in all my Holy Mountain. For the Earth shall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea. <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Isa. xi. 6—9.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="78" REF="028060_0074_0FD68A7FAF3C3578"/>
2. To the same Effect are the Words of the great Apostle, which it is evident have never yet been fulfilled. <HI>Hath God cast away his People? God forbid. But through their Fall Salvation is come to the Gentiles. And if the diminishing of them be the Riches of the Gentiles, how much more their Fulness? For I would not, Brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this Mystery.—That Blindness in Part is happened to</HI> Israel, <HI>until the Ful∣ness of the Gentiles be come in: And so all</HI> Israel <HI>shall be saved.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xi. 1, 11, 12, 25, 26.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. Suppose now the Fulness of Time to be come, and the Prophecies to be accomplished. What a Prospect is this? All is <HI>Peace, Quiet∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>, and Assurance for ever.</HI> Here is no Din of Arms, no <HI>confused Noise,</HI> no <HI>Garments rolled in Blood. Destructions are come to a perpetual End:</HI> Wars are ceased from the Earth. Neither are there any intestine Jars remaining; no Bro∣ther rising up against Brother; no Country or City divided against itself and tearing out its own Bowels. Civil Discord is at an End for evermore, and none is left either to destroy or hurt his Neighbour. Here is no Oppression to <HI>Duke</HI> even <HI>the wise Man mad;</HI> no Extortion to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ind the Face of the Poor;</HI> no Robbery or Wrong; no Rapine or Injustice; for all are <HI>content with such Things as they possess.</HI> Thus <HI>Righteousness and Peace have kissed each other;</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. let iv. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> they have <HI>taken Root and filled the Land:</HI> Righteousness flourishing out of the Earth, and <HI>Peace looking down from Heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="79" REF="028060_0075_0FD68A7FB3486718"/>
4. And with Righteousness or Justice, Mer∣cy is also found. The Earth is no longer <HI>full of cruel Habitations. The Lord hath destroyed both the blood-thirsty</HI> and malicious, the envious and revengeful Man. Were there any Provocation, there is none that now knoweth to <HI>return Evil for Evil:</HI> But indeed there is none doth Evil, no not one: for all are <HI>harmless as Doves.</HI> And be∣ing <HI>filled with Peace and Joy in Believing,</HI> and united in one Body, by one Spirit, they all <HI>love as Brethren,</HI> they are all <HI>of one Heart, and of one Soul. Neither saith any of them, that ought of the Things which he possesseth is his own.</HI> There is none among them that lacketh; for every Man loveth his Neighbour as himself. And all walk by one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>Whatever ye would that Men should do unto you, even so do unto them.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. It follows that no unkind Word can ever be heard among them. No <HI>Strife of Tongue,</HI> no Contention of any Kind, no Railing or Evil∣speaking; but every one <HI>opens his Mouth with Wisdom, and in his Tongue there is the Law of Kindness.</HI> Equally incapable are they of Fraud or Guile: Their <HI>Love</HI> is <HI>without Dissimulation:</HI> Their Words are always the just Expression of their Thoughts, opening a Window into their Breast, that whosoever desires may look into thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hearts, and see that only Love and God are there.</P>
<P N="6">6. Thus, where <HI>the Lord Omnipotent taketh to himself his mighty Power and reigneth,</HI> doth he <HI>subdue all Things to himself;</HI> cause every Heart to overflow with Love, and fill every Mouth with Praise. <Q>Happy are the People that are in such a Case; yea, blessed are the People who

Thou hast known that I the Lord am thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer, the mighty God of Jacob. I have made thy Officers Peace, and thy Exacters Righteous∣ness. Violence shall no more be heard in thy Land, Wasting nor Destruction within thy Bor∣ders; but thou shalt call thy Walls Salvation, and thy Gates Praise. Thy People are all Righteous; they shall inherit the Land for ever: The Branch of my planting, the Work of my Hands, that I may be glorified.

<P N="4">IV Having thus briefly considered <HI>Christianity,</HI> as beginning, as going on, and as covering the Earth, it remains only that I should close the whole with a plain practical Application.</P>
<P N="1">1. And first, I would ask, Where does this <HI>Christianity</HI> now exist? Where, I pray, do the <HI>Christians</HI> live? Which is the Country, the In∣habitants whereof are <HI>all</HI> thus <HI>filled with the Holy Ghost?</HI> Are <HI>all of one Heart and of one Soul?</HI> Cannot suffer one among them <HI>to lack any Thing,</HI> but continually give <HI>to every Man as he hath Need?</HI> Who one and all have the Love of God filling their Hearts, and constraining them to love their Neighbour as themselves? Who have all <HI>put on Bowels of Mercy, Humbleness of Mind, Gentleness, Long suffering?</HI>-Who offend
<PB N="81" REF="028060_0077_0FD68A81B6CC5200"/>not in any Kind, either by Word or Deed, a∣gainst Justice, Mercy, or Truth? But in every Point do unto all Men, as they would these should do unto them. With what Propriety can we term any a <HI>Christian Country,</HI> which does not answer this Description? Why then, let us confess we have never yet seen a <HI>Christian Country</HI> upon Earth.</P>
<P N="3">3. I beseech you, Brethren, by the Mercies of God, if ye do account me a Madman or a Fool, yet <HI>as a Fool bear with me.</HI> It is utterly needful that some one should use great Plainness of Speech towards you. It is more especially needful at <HI>this</HI> Time; for who knoweth but it is the <HI>last?</HI> Who knoweth how soon the Righ∣teous Judge may say, <HI>I will no more be intreated for this People. Tho'</HI> Noah, Daniel, <HI>and</HI> Job, <HI>were in this Land, they should but deliver their own Souls.</HI> And who will use this Plainness, if I do not? Therefore I, even I will speak. And I adjure you, by the Living God, that ye steel not your Breasts against receiving a Blessing at <HI>my</HI> Hands. Do not say in your Heart, <HI>Non per∣suadebis, etiamsi persuaseris:</HI> Or, in other Words, Lord, thou shalt not <HI>send by whom thou wilt send.</HI> Let me rather perish in my Blood, than be saved by this Man!</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Brethren, I am persuaded better Things of you, tho' I thus speak.</HI> Let me ask you then, in tender Love, and in the Spirit of Meekness, Is this City a <HI>Christian</HI> City? Is <HI>Christianity, Scrip∣tural Christianity,</HI> found here? Are we, consi∣dered as a Community of Men, so <HI>filled with the Holy Ghost,</HI> as to enjoy in our Hearts, and shew forth in our Lives, the genuine Fruits of that Spirit? Are all the Magistrates, all Heads and
<PB N="82" REF="028060_0078_0FD68A88FB30C178"/>Governors of Colleges and Halls, and their re∣spective Societies, (not to speak of the Inhabi∣tants of the Town) <HI>of one Heart and one Soul?</HI> Is <HI>the Love of</HI> God <HI>shed abroad in our Hearts?</HI> Are our Tempers the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me that were in him? And are our Lives agreeable thereto? Are we <HI>Holy as he which hath called us is holy, in all manner of Conversation?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. I intreat you to observe, that here are no <HI>pe∣culiar Notions</HI> now under Consideration; that the Question moved is not concerning <HI>doubtful Opinions,</HI> of one kind or another; but concerning the un∣doubted, fundamental Branches (if there be any such) of our <HI>common Christianity.</HI> And for the de∣cision thereof, I appeal to your own Conscience, guided by the Word of God. He therefore that is not condemned by his own Heart, let him go free.</P>
<P N="5">5. In the Fear then, and in the Presence of the Great God, before whom both you and I shall shortly appear, I pray you that are in Authority over us, whom I reverence for your Office Sake, to consider, (and not after the Manner of Dis∣semblers with God) Are you <HI>filled with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Holy Ghost?</HI> Are ye lively Portraitures of Him, whom ye are appointed to represent among Men? <HI>I have said, Ye are Gods,</HI> ye Magistrates and Rulers; ye are by office so nearly allied to the God of Heaven! In your several Stations and Degrees, ye are to shew forth unto us <HI>the Lord our Governor.</HI> Are all the Thoughts of your Hearts, all your Tempers and Desires, suitable to your High Calling? Are all your Words like unto those which come out of the Mouth of God? Is there in all your Actions Dignity and Love? A Greatness which Words cannot express, which can flow only from an Heart full of
<PB N="83" REF="028060_0079_0FD68A8A25C8DA00"/>God—and yet consistent with the Character of <HI>Man that is a Worm and the Son of Man that is a Worm!</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Ye venerable Men, who are more especially called to form the tender Minds of Youth, to dis∣pel thence the Shades of Ignorance and Error, and train them up to be wise unto Salvation, Are you <HI>filled with the Holy Ghost?</HI> With all these <HI>Fruits of the Spirit,</HI> which your important Office so in∣dispensibly requires? Is your Heart whole with God? Full of Love and Zeal to set up his King∣dom on Earth? Do you continually remind those under your Care, that the one rational End of all our Studies, is to know, love, and serve <HI>the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent?</HI> Do you inculcate upon them, Day by Day, that <HI>Love</HI> alone <HI>never faileth?</HI> (Whereas, <HI>whether there be Tongues, they shall fail, or</HI> Philosophical <HI>Knowledge, it shall vanish away:</HI>) And that with∣out Love, all Learning is but splendid Ignorance, pompous Folly, Vexation of Spirit. Has all you teach an actual Tendency to the Love of God, and of all Mankind for his sake? Have you an Eye to this End in whatever you prescribe, touching the Kind, the Manner, and the Measure of their Studies; desiring and labouring, that wherever the Lot of these young Soldiers of Christ is cast, they may be so many <HI>burning and shining Lights, adorning the Gospel of Christ</HI> in all Things? And permit me to ask, Do you put forth all your Strength in the vast Work you have undertaken? Do you labour herein with all your Might? Exert∣ing every Faculty of your Soul? Using every Talent which God hath lent you, and that to the uttermost of your Power?</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="84" REF="028060_0080_0FD68A8B9CDF1148"/>
7. Let it not be said, that I speak here, as If all under your Care were intended to be Clergy∣men. Not so: I only speak as if they were all intended to be Christians. But what example is set them by us who enjoy the Beneficence of our Forefathers; by Fellows, Students, Scholars; more especially those who are of some Rank and Eminence? Do ye, Brethren, abound in the Fruits of the Spirit, in Lowliness of Mind, in Self-denial and Mortification, in Seriousness and Composure of Spirit, in Patience, Meekness, So∣briety, Temperance, and in unwearied, restless Endeavours, to do good, in every kind, unto all Men; to relieve their outward. Wants, and to bring their Souls to the true Knowledge and Love of God? Is this the general Character of Fel∣lows of Colleges? I fear it is not. Rather, have not Pride and Haughtiness of Spirit, Impatience and Peevishness, Sloth and Indolence, Gluttony, and Sensuality, and even a proverbial Uselessness, been objected to us, <HI>perhaps</HI> not always by our Enemies, <HI>nor wholly</HI> without Ground? O that God would Roll away this Reproach from us, that the very Memory of it might perish for ever!</P>
<P N="8">8. Many of us are more immediately conse∣crated to God, called to <HI>minister in holy Things.</HI> Are we then Patterns to the rest, <HI>in Word, in Conversation, in Charity; in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity?</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. iv.</NOTE> Is there written on our Forehead and on our Hearts, <HI>Holiness to the Lord?</HI> From what Motives did we enter upon this Office? Was it indeed with a single Eve <HI>to serve God, trusting that we were inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost, to take upon us this Ministration, for the promoting of his Glory and the edifying of his People?</HI> And <HI>have</HI> we <HI>clearly determined, by God's Grace, to give our∣selves
<PB N="85" REF="028060_0081_0FD68A8D1813F4A8"/>wholly to this Office? Do we forsake and set∣aside, as much as in us lies, all worldly Cares and Studies? Do we apply ourselves wholly to this one thing, and draw all our Cares and Studies this Way?</HI> Are we <HI>apt to teach?</HI> Are we <HI>taught of God,</HI> that we may be able to teach others also? Do we know God? Do we know Jesus Christ? Hath God <HI>revealed his Son in us?</HI> And hath he <HI>made us able Minislers of the New Covenant?</HI> Where then are <HI>the Seals of our Apostleship?</HI> Who <HI>that were dead in Trespasses and Sin,</HI> have been quickened by our Word? Have we a burning Zeal to save Souls from Death, so that for their sake we often forget even to eat our Bread? Do we speak plain, <HI>by Manifestation of the Truth, com∣mending ourselves to every Man's Conscience in the Sight of God?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iv. 2.</NOTE> Are we dead to the World and the Things of the World, <HI>laying up all our Trea∣sure in Heaven? Do we lord over God's Heri∣tage?</HI> Or are we the least, <HI>the Servants of all?</HI> When we bear the Reproach of Christ, Does it sit heavy upon us? Or do we rejoice therein? When we are <HI>smitten on the one Cheek,</HI> Do we re∣sent it? Are we impatient of Affronts? Or do we <HI>turn the other also; not resisting the Evil,</HI> but <HI>overcoming Evil with Good?</HI> Have we a bitter Zeal, inciting us to strive sharply and passionately with them <HI>that are out of the Way?</HI> Or is our Zeal the Flame of Love, so as to direct all our Words with Sweetness, Lowliness, and Meekness of Wisdom?</P>
<P N="9">9. Once more, What shall we say concerning the Youth of this Place? Have <HI>you</HI> either the Form or the Power of <HI>Christian</HI> Godliness? Are
<PB N="86" REF="028060_0082_0FD68A94E3CFC538"/>you humble, teachable, adviseable: or stubborn, self-willed, heady, and high-minded? Are you obedient to your Superiors as to Parents? Or do you despise those to whom you owe the tenderest Reverence? Are you diligent in your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asy Busi∣ness, pursuing your Studies with all your Strength? Do you <HI>re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>m the Time,</HI> crowding as much Work into every Day as it can contain? Rather, are ye not conscious to yourselves, that you waste away Day after Day, either in reading what has no Tendency to <HI>Christianity,</HI> or in Gaming, or in—you know not what? Are you better Ma∣nagers of your Fortune than of your Time? Do you, out of Principle, take care to <HI>owe no Man any thing?</HI> Do you <HI>remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy;</HI> to spend it in the more immeciate Worship of God? When you are in his House, Do you consider that God is there? Do you behave, <HI>as secing Him that is invisible?</HI> Do you know how to <HI>possess your Bodies, in Sanctification and Honour?</HI> Are not Dru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kenness and Un∣cleanness found among you? Yea, are there not of you, who <HI>glory in their Shame?</HI> Do not many of you <HI>take the Name of God in vain,</HI> perhaps ha∣bitually, without either Remorse or Fear? Yea, Are there not a Multitude of you that are for∣sworn? I fear, a swiftly-increasing Maltitude. Be not surprized, Brethren. Before God and this Congregation, I own myself to have been of the Number; solemnly swearing to <HI>observe all those Customs,</HI> which I then knew nothing of; <HI>and those Statutes,</HI> which I did not so much as read over, either then, or for some Years after. What is Perjury, if this is not? But if it be, O what a Weight of Sin, yea, Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of no common

<P N="10">10. May it not be one of the Consequences of this, that so many of you are a Generation of <HI>Triflers;</HI> Triflers with God, with one another, and with your own Souls? For how few of you spend, from one Week to another, a single Hour in private Prayer? How few have any Thought of God in the General Tenor of your Converia∣tion? Who of you is, in any Degree, acquaint∣ed with the Work of his Spirit, his supernatural Work in the Souls of Men? Can you bear, un∣less now and then, in a Church, any Talk of the Holy Ghost? Would you not take it for grant∣ed, if one began such a Conversation, that it was either <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> or <HI>Enthusiasm?</HI> In the Name of the Lord God Almighty, I ask, What Reli∣gion are <HI>you</HI> of? Even the Talk of <HI>Christianity</HI> ye cannot, will not bear. O my Brethren! What a <HI>Christian</HI> City is this? <HI>It is Time for thee, Lord, to lay to thine Hand!</HI></P>
<P N="11">11.

That all Orders of Men among us should speak and live as Men, <HI>filled with the Holy Ghost?</HI> By whom should this <HI>Christianity</HI> be restored? By those of you that are in Authority?

<P N="1">1. HOW a Sinner may be justified before God, the Lord and Judge of all, is a Question of no common Importance, to every Child of Man. It contains the Foundation of all our Hope; in as much as while we are at Enmity with God, there can be no true Peace, no solid Joy, either in Time or in Eternity. What Peace can there be, while our own Heart condemns us? And much more, He that <HI>is greater than our Heart and knoweth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Things?</HI> What solid Joy, either in this Word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or that to come, while <HI>the Wrath of</HI> God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>on us?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. And yet how little hath this importa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Question been understood? What confused No∣tions have many had concerning it? Indeed not only confused, but often utterly false; contra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to the Truth, as Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht to Darkness: Notions abso∣lutely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>consisten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the Oracles of God, and with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whole Analogy of Faith. And hence erring concerning the very Foundation, they could not
<PB N="92" REF="028060_0087_0FD68AA169D628C8"/>possibly build thereon: At least, not <HI>Gold, Silver, or precious Stenes,</HI> which would endure when <HI>tried</HI> as <HI>by Fire;</HI> but only <HI>Hay and Stubble,</HI> neither ac∣ceptable to God, nor profitable to Man.</P>
<P N="3">3. In order to do Justice, as far as in me lies, to the vast Importance of the Subject, to save those that seek the Truth in Sincerity, from <HI>vain J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngling and Strife of Words,</HI> to clear the Confused∣ness of Thought, into which so many have already been led thereby, and to give them true and just Conceptions of this great Mystery of Godsiness, I shall endeavour to shew,
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>First,</HI> What is the general Ground of this whole Doctrine of Justification.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> What Justification is.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Who they are that are justified. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Fourthly,</HI> On what Terms they are justified.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. I am, first, to shew, What is the general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>round of this whole Doctrine of Justification. 1. In the Image of God was Man made, ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he that created him is holy; merciful as the Author of all is merciful, perfect as his Fa∣ther in Heaven is perfect. As God is Love, so Man dwelling in Love, dwelt in God, and God in him. God made him to be <HI>an Image of his own Eternity,</HI> an incorruptible Picture of the God of Glory. He was accordingly pure, as God is pure, from every Spot of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. He knew not Evil in any King or Degree, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was inwardly and outwardly sinless and undefiled. He
<PB N="93" REF="028060_0088_0FD68AA5163BE118"/><HI>loved the Lord his God with all his Heart, and with all his Mind and Soul and Strength.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To Man thus upright and perfect, God give a perfect Law, to which he required full and perfect Obedience. He required full Obedience in every Point, and this to be performed without any Intermission, from the Moment Man became a living Soul, till the Time of his Trial should be ended. No Allowance was made for any fall∣ing short. As indeed there was no need of any; Man being altogether equal to the Task assigned, and thoroughly furnished for every good Word and Work.</P>
<P N="3">3. To the entire Law of Love which was written in his Heart (against which perhaps he could not sin directly) it seemed good to the sove∣reign Wisdom of God, to superadd one posi∣tive Law: <HI>Thou shalt not eat of the Fruit of the Tree that groweth in the midst of the Garden:</HI> Annexing that Penalty thereto, <HI>In the Day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Such then was the State of Man in Para∣dise. By the free, unmerited Love of God, he was holy and happy; he knew, loved, enjoyed God, which is (in Substance) Life everlasting. And in this Life of Love, he was to continue for ever, if he continued to obey God in all Things: But if he disobeyed in any, he was to forfeit all. <HI>In that Day,</HI> said God, <HI>thou shalt surely die.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Man did disobey God. He <HI>ate of the Tree, of which God commanded him, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it.</HI> And in that Day he was condemned, by the righteous Judgment of God. Then also the Sentence whereof he was
<PB N="94" REF="028060_0089_0FD68AAAF6EB76A8"/>warned before, began to take Place upon him. For the Moment he tasted that Fruit, he died: His Soul died, was separated from God; sepa∣rate from whom the Soul has no more Life, than the Body has when separate from the Soul. His Body likewise became corruptible and mortal; so that Death then took hold on this also. And be∣ing already dead in Spirit, dead to God, dead in Sin, he hastened on to Death everlasting; to the Destruction both of Body and Soul, in the Fire never to be quenched.</P>
<P N="6">6. Thus <HI>by one Man, Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin. And so Death passed upon all Men,</HI> as being contained in him who was the common Father and Representative of us all. Thus <HI>through the Offence of one,</HI> all are dead, dead to God, dead in Sin, dwelling in a cor∣ruptible, mortal Body, shortly to be dissolved, and under the Sentence of Death eternal. For as <HI>by one Man's Disobedience, all were made sinners;</HI> so by that Offence of one, <HI>Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation,</HI> Rom. v. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. In this State we were, even all Mankind, when God <HI>so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, to the End we might not perish but have everlasting Life.</HI> In the Fulness of Time, he was made Man, another common Head of Mankind, a second general Parent and Represen∣tative of the whole human Race. And as such it was that <HI>he bore our Griefs,</HI> the Lord <HI>laying upon him the Iniquities of us all.</HI> Then <HI>was he wound∣ed for our Transgressions and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uised for our Iniqui∣ties. He made his Soul an Offering for Sin:</HI> He poured out his Blood for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sgressors: He <HI>bare our Sins in his own Body on the Tree,</HI> that
<PB N="95" REF="028060_0090_0FD68AABD980F9F8"/><HI>by his Stripes we</HI> might be <HI>healed:</HI> And <HI>by that one Oblation of himself once offered, he hath redeemed me and all Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kind;</HI> having thereby <HI>made a full, per∣fect and sufficient Sacrifice and Satisfaction, for the Sins of the whole World.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. In Consideration of this, that the Son of God hath <HI>tasted Death for every Man,</HI> God hath now <HI>reconciled the World to himself, not in∣puting to them their former Trespasses.</HI> And thus, <HI>as by the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation, even so by the Righteousness of one, the free Gift came upon all Men unto Jus∣tification.</HI> So that for the Sake of his we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-he-loved Son, of what he hath done and suffered for <HI>us,</HI> God now vouchsafes on one only Condition (which himself also enables us to perform) both to remit the Punishment due to our Sins, to re∣instate us in his Favour, and to restore our dead Souls to spiritual Life, as the Earnest of Life eternal.</P>
<P N="9">9. This therefore is the general Ground, of the whole Doctrine of <HI>Justification.</HI> By the Sin of the first <HI>Adam,</HI> who was not only the Father, but likewise the Representative of us all, we all <HI>fell short of the</HI> Favour <HI>of</HI> God: we all became <HI>Children of Wrath:</HI> Or, as the Apostle expresses it, <HI>Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation.</HI> Even so, by the Sacrifice for Sin made by the se∣cond <HI>Adam,</HI> as the Representative of us all, God is so far reconciled to all the World, that he hath given them a New Covenant. The plain Condition whereof being once fulfilled, <HI>there is no more Condemnation for us,</HI> but we are <HI>justi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="028060_0091_0FD68AD3C8263E20"/>
But what is it to be <HI>justified?</HI> What is <HI>Justification?</HI> This was the second Thing which I proposed to shew. And it is evident from what has been already observed, that it is not, the being made actually just and righteous. This is <HI>Sanctification;</HI> which is indeed, in some Degree, the immeditate <HI>Fruit</HI> of Justification: But nevertheless is a distinct Gift of God, and of a totally different Nature. The one implies, what God <HI>does f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> us</HI> through his Son; the other what he <HI>works in us</HI> by his Spirit. So that altho' some rare Instances may be found, wherein the Term <HI>Justified,</HI> or <HI>Justification,</HI> is used in so wide a Sense as to include <HI>Sanctification</HI> also; yet in ge∣neral Use, they are sufficiently distinguished from each other, both by St. <HI>Paul</HI> and the other inspir∣ed Writers.</P>
<P N="2">2. Neither is that far-fetch'd Conceit, that Justification is, the clearing us from Accusation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>larly that of <HI>Satan,</HI> easily proveable from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Text of holy Writ. In the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>al Account of this Matter, as above laid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, neither that Accuser nor his Accusation appears to be at all taken in. It cannot indeed be denied, that he is the <HI>Accuser of Men,</HI> emphati∣cally so called. But it does in no wise appear, that the great Apostle hath any reference to this, more or less, in all that he hath written touching Justification, either to the <HI>Romans</HI> or the <HI>Gala∣tians.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It is also far easier to take for granted, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prove from any clear Scripture-Testimony, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Justification is, the clearing us from the Ac∣cusation brought against us by <HI>the Law.</HI> At least,
<PB N="97" REF="028060_0092_0FD68AAD60FF28A8"/>if this forced, unnatural Way of speaking, mean either more or loss than this, That whereas we have transgressed the Law of God, and thereby deserved the Damnation of Hell, God does not inflict on those who are justified, the Punishment which they had deserved.</P>
<P N="4">4. Least of all does Justification imply, that God is <HI>deceived</HI> in those whom he <HI>justifies;</HI> that he thinks them to be what in fact they are not, that he accounts them to be otherwise than they are. It does by no means imply, that God judges concerning us, contrary to the real Nature of Things: that he esteems us better than we really are, or believes us righteous, when we are unrighteous. Surely no. The judgment of the all wise God, is always according to Truth. Neither can it ever consist with his unerring Wis∣dom, to think that I am innocent, to judge that I am righteous or holy, because another is so. He can no more in this manuer confound me with Christ, than with <HI>David</HI> or <HI>Abraham.</HI> L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> any Man to whom God hath given Understanding, weigh this without Prejudice: and he cannot but perceive, that such a Notion of Justification, is neither reconcileable to Reason or Scripture.</P>
<P N="5">5. The plain scriptural Notion of Justification is Pardon, the Forgiveness of Sins. It is that Act of God the Father, whereby for the sake of the Propitiation made by the Blood of his Son, he <HI>sheweth forth his Righteousness</HI> (or Mer∣cy) <HI>by the Remission of the Sins that are past.</HI> This is the easy, natural Account of it given by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> throughout this whole Epistle. So he explains it himself, more particularly in this, and in the following Chapter. Thus in the next,
<PB N="98" REF="028060_0093_0FD68AAEED7C7860"/>Verses but one to the Text, <HI>Blessed are they,</HI> saith he, <HI>whose Iniquities are forgiven, and whose Sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are covered: Blessed is the Man to whom the Lord will not impute Sin.</HI> To him that is justified or forgiven, God <HI>will not impute Sin</HI> to his Con∣demnation. He will not condemn him on that account, either in this World or in that which is to come. His Sins, all his past Sins, in Thought, Word and Deed, are covered, are blotted out: shall not be remembered or mentioned against him, any more than if they had not been. God will not inflict on that Sinner what he deserved to suffer, because the Son of his Love hath suffered for him. And from the Time we are <HI>accepted through the Beloved, reconciled to</HI> God <HI>through his Blood,</HI> he loves and blesses and watches over us for Good, even as if we had never sinned.</P>
<P>Indeed the Apostle in one Place seems to extend the Meaning of the Word much farther; where he says, <HI>Not the Hearers of the Low, but the Do∣ers of the Law shall be justified.</HI> Here he appears to refer our Justification, to the Sentence of the great Day. And so our Lord himself unquestion∣ably doth, when he says, <HI>By thy Words thou shalt be justified:</HI> proving thereby, that <HI>for every idle Word Men shall speak, they shall give an Ac∣count in the Day of Judgment.</HI> But perhaps we can hardly p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oduce another Instance, of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s using the Word in that distant Sense. In the general Tenor of his Writings, it is evident he doth not. And least of all in the Text before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which undeniably speaks, not of those wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> have already <HI>finished their Course,</HI> but of those who are now just <HI>setting out,</HI> just <HI>beginning to run the Race which is set before them.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="99" REF="028060_0094_0FD68AB297D5B328"/>
III. 1. But this is the third Thing which was to be considered, namely, who are they that are justified? And the Apostle tells us expresly, <HI>the Ungodly:</HI> He, that is, God, <HI>justifieth the Un∣godly:</HI> The Ungodly of every Kind and Degree, and none but the Ungodly. As <HI>they that are righ∣teous, need no Repentance,</HI> so they need no For∣giveness. It is only Sinners that have any Occa∣sion for Pardon: It is Sin alone which admits of being forgiven. Forgiveness therefore has an im∣mediate Reference to Sin, and (in this Respect) to nothing else. It is our <HI>Unrighteousness</HI> to which the pardoning God is <HI>merciful:</HI> It is our <HI>Iniquity</HI> which he <HI>remembereth no more.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This seems not to be at all considered by those who so vehemently contend, that a Man must be sanctified, that is, holy, before he can be justified: Especially by such of them as affirm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that universal Holiness or Obedience must precede Justification (unless they mean, that Justification at the last Day, which is wholly out of the pre∣sent Question) so far from it, that the very Sup∣position, is not only flatly impossible (for where there is no Love of God, there is no Holiness; and there is no Love of God, but from a Sense of his loving us) but also grosly, intrinsically ab∣surd, contradictory to itself. For it is not a <HI>Saint</HI> but a <HI>Sinner</HI> that is <HI>forgiven,</HI> and under the Notion of a Sinner. God <HI>justifieth</HI> not the Godly, but the <HI>Ungodly:</HI> not those that are holy already, but the Unholy. Upon what Condition he doth this, will be considered quickly: But whatever it is, it cannot be Holiness. To as∣sert this, is to say, the Lamb of God takes
<PB N="100" REF="028060_0095_0FD68AB6353D45C0"/>away, only those Sins which were taken away before.</P>
<P N="3">3. Does then the good Shepherd seek and save only those that are found already? No. He seeks and saves that which is lost. He pardons those who <HI>need</HI> his pardoning Mercy. He saves from the Guilt of Sin (and at the same time from the Power) Sinners of every Kind, of every De∣gree: Men who till then were altogether ungodly; in whom the Love of the Father was not; and consequently, in whom dwelt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood Thing, no good or truly Christian Temper: But all such as were evil and abominable, Pride, Anger, Love of the World, the genuine Fruits of that <HI>carnal Mind, which is Enmity against</HI> God.</P>
<P N="4">4. These <HI>who are sick, the Burden of whose Sins is intol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ble,</HI> are they that <HI>need a Physician;</HI> these who are guilty, who groan under the Wrath of God. are they that need a Pardon. These who are <HI>condemned already,</HI> not only by God, but also by then own Conscience, as by a thousand Wit∣nesses, of all their Ungodliness, both in Thought and Word and Work, cry aloud for him that <HI>justi∣fieth the Ungodly, through the Redemption that is in Jesus: The Ungodly and him that worketh not;</HI> that worketh not before he is justified; any thing that is good, that is truly virtuous o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> holy, but only evil continually. For his Heart is necessarily, essentially evil, till the Love of God is shed abroad therein. And while the Tree is corrupt, so are the Fruits; <HI>for an evil Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. If it be objected, "Nay, but a Man, be∣fore he is justified, may feed the Hungry, or clothe the Naked; and these are good Works:"
<PB N="101" REF="028060_0096_0FD68AB71D2D8738"/>The answer is easy. He <HI>may</HI> do those, even be∣fore he is justified. And these are, in one Sense, <HI>Good Works;</HI> they are <HI>good and profitable to Man.</HI> But it does not follow, that they are, strictly speaking, good in themselves, or good in the Sight of God. All truly <HI>good Works</HI> (to use the Words of our Church) <HI>follow after Justification.</HI> And they are therefore good and <HI>acceptable to</HI> God <HI>in Christ,</HI> because they <HI>spring out of a true and living Faith.</HI> By a Parity of Reason, all <HI>Works done before Justification, are not</HI> good, in the Christian Sense, <HI>forasmuch as they spring not of Faith in Jesus Christ</HI> (tho' from some kind of Faith in God they may spring) <HI>yea rather, for that they are not done, as</HI> God <HI>hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> (how strange soever it may appear to some) <HI>but they have the Nature of Sin.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Perhaps those who doubt of this, have not duly cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dered the weighty Reason which is here assigned, why no Works done before Justification, can be truly and properly good. The Argument plainly run<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thus:</P>
<P>No Works are good which are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done:</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut no Works done before Justification are done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done:</P>
<P>Therefore no Works done before Justification are good.</P>
<P>The first Proposition is self-evident. And the second, That no Works done before Justification, are done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, will appear equally plain and
<PB N="102" REF="028060_0097_0FD68AB93B307F10"/>undeniable, if we only consider God hath willed and commanded, that <HI>all our Works</HI> should <HI>be done in Charity,</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) in Love, in that Love to God, which produces Love to all Man∣kind. But none of our Works can be done in this Love, while the Love of the Father (of God as our Father) is not in us. And this Love cannot be in us, till we receive the <HI>Spirit of Adaption, crying in our Hearts, Abba, Father.</HI> If therefore God doth not <HI>justify the Ungodly,</HI> and him that (in this Sense) <HI>worketh not,</HI> then hath Christ died in vain; then notwithstanding his Death, can no Flesh living be justified.</P>
<P N="4">IV. 1. But on what Terms then is he justified, who is altogether <HI>ungodly,</HI> and till that Time, <HI>worketh not?</HI> On one alone, which is Faith. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ieveth in him that justifieth the Ungodly. <Q>And he that believeth is not condemned: Yea, he is passed from Death unto Life. For the Righte∣ousness (or Mercy) of God is by Faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all them that believe:— Whom God hath set forth for a Propitiation, through Faith in his Blood: that he might be just, and (consistently with his Justice) the Justifier of him which believeth in Jesus: Therefore we conclude, that a Man is justified by Faith, without the Deeds of the Law:</Q> without previous Obedi∣ence to the Moral Law, which indeed he could not till now perform. That it is the Moral Law, and that alone which is here intended, ap∣pears evidently from the Words that follow. <HI>Do we then make void the Law through Faith?</HI> God <HI>forbid! Yea, we establish the Law.</HI> What Law do we establish by Faith? Not the Ritual Law:
<PB N="103" REF="028060_0098_0FD68ABB08C0E010"/>Not the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Moses.</HI> In no wise; but the great unchangeable Law of Love, the holy Love of God and of our Neighbour.</P>
<P N="2">2. Faith in general is, a divine, supernatural <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Evidence</HI> or Conviction <HI>of Things not seen,</HI> not discoverable by our bodily Senses, as being either past, future or spiritual. Justifying Faith implies, not only a Divine Evidence or Convic∣tion, that God <HI>was in Christ, reconciling the World unto himself,</HI> but a sure Trust and Confi∣dence, that Christ died for <HI>my</HI> Sins, that he loved <HI>me</HI> and gave himself for <HI>me.</HI> And at what Time soever a Sinner thus believes, be it in early Child∣hood, in the Strength of his Years, or when he is old and hoary-hair'd, God justifieth that un∣godly one: God for the sake of his Son, pardon∣eth and absolveth him who had in him till then no good Thing. Repentance indeed God had given him before: But that Repentance was nei∣ther more nor less, than a deep Sense of the Want of all Good, and the Presence of all Evil. And whatever Good he hath or doth from that Hour, when he first believes in God through Christ, Faith does not <HI>find</HI> but <HI>bring.</HI> This is the Fruit of Faith. First the Tree is good, and then the Fruit is good also.</P>
<P N="3">3. I cannot describe the Nature of this Faith better, than in the Words of our own Church. "The only Instrument of Salvation" (whereo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Justification is one Branch) "is Faith: that is, a sure Trust and Confidence, that God both hath and will forgive our Sins, that he hath accepted us again into his Favour, for the Merits of Christ's. Death and Passion.—But here we must take heed that we do not halt with God, through an in∣constant,
<PB N="104" REF="028060_0099_0FD68ABCAD4AE4F8"/>wavering Faith. <HI>Peter</HI> coming to Christ upon the Water, because he fainted in Faith, was in danger of drowning. So we, if we begin to waver or doubt, it is to be feared, that we should sink as <HI>Peter</HI> did, not into the Water, but into the bottomless Pit of Hell-fire." Second Sermon on the Passion.</P>
<P>"Therefore have a sure and constant Faith, not only that the Death of Christ is available for; all the World, but that he hath made a full and sufficient Sacrifice for <HI>thee,</HI> a perfect cleansing of <HI>thy</HI> Sins, so that thou mayst say with the Apostle, He loved <HI>thee</HI> and gave himself for <HI>thee.</HI> For this is to make Christ <HI>thine own,</HI> and to apply his Merits unto <HI>thyself.</HI>" Sermon on the Sacrament, first Part.</P>
<P N="4">4. By affirming that this Faith is the Term or <HI>Condition of Justification,</HI> I mean, first, that there is no Justification without it. <HI>He that be∣lieveth not is condemned already;</HI> and so long as he believeth not, that Condemnation cannot be re∣moved, but <HI>the Wrath of</HI> God <HI>abideth on him.</HI> As <HI>there is no other Name given under Heaven th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that of Jesus of Nazareth,</HI> no other Merit <HI>whereby</HI> a condemned Sinner can ever <HI>be saved</HI> from the Guilt of Sin; so there is no other Way of obtaining a Share in his Merit, than <HI>by Faith in his Name.</HI> So that as long as we are without this Faith, we are <HI>Strangers to the Covenant of Promise,</HI> we are <HI>Aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel, and without</HI> God <HI>in the World.</HI> What∣soever Virtues (so called) a Man may have (I speak of those unto whom the Gospel is preached; for <HI>what have I to do to judge them that are without?</HI>) whatsoever good Works (so accounted) he may
<PB N="105" REF="028060_0100_0FD68ABE95B57308"/>do, it profiteth not; he is still a <HI>Child of Wrath,</HI> still under the Curse, till he believes in Jesus.</P>
<P N="5">5. Faith therefore is the <HI>necessery</HI> Condition of Justification. Yea, and the <HI>only necessary</HI> Con∣dition thereof. This is the second Point care∣fully to be observed; that the very Moment God giveth Faith (<HI>for it is the Gift of</HI> God) to the <HI>Un∣godly, that worketh not,</HI> that <HI>Faith is counted to him for Righteousness.</HI> He hath no Righteousness at all, antecedent to this, not so much as negative Righteousness or Innocence. But <HI>Faith is imputed to him for Righteousness,</HI> the very Moment that he believeth. Not that God (as was observed before) thinketh him to be, what he is not. But as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made Christ to be Sin for us,</HI> that is, treated him as a Sinner, punished him for our Sins, so he counteth us righteous, from the time we believe in him: that is, he doth not punish us for our Sins, yea, treats us as tho' we were guiltless and righteous.</P>
<P N="6">6. Surely the Difficulty of assenting to the Proposition, That Faith is the <HI>only Condition</HI> of Justification, must arise from not understa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> We mean thereby thus much, That it is the only Thing without which none is justified; the only Thing that is immediately, indispensably, abso∣lutely requisite in order to Pardon. As on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hand, tho' a Man should have every thing else, without Faith, yet he cannot be justified; so on the other, tho' he be supposed to want every thing else, yet if he hath Faith, he cannot but be justi∣fied. For suppose a Sinner of any Kind or De∣gree,
<PB N="106" REF="028060_0101_0FD68AC58C61B938"/>in a full Sense of his total Ungodliness, of his utter Inability to think, speak or do Good, and his absolute Meetness for Hell-fire: Suppose, I say, this Sinner, helpless and hopeless, casts himself wholly on the Mercy of God in Christ (which indeed he cannot do but by the Grace of God) who can doubt, but he is forgiven in that Moment? Who will affirm, that any more is <HI>indispensably required,</HI> before that Sinner can be justified?</P>
<P>Now if there ever was one such Instance from the Beginning of the World (And have there not been, and are there not ten thousand times ten thousand?) it plainly follows, that Faith is, in the above Sense, the sole Condition of Justifica∣tion.</P>
<P N="7">7. It does not become poor, guilty, sinful Worms, who receive whatsoever Blessings they enjoy, (from the least Drop of Water that cools our Tongue, to the immense Riches of Glory in Eternity) of Grace, of mere Favour, and not of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to ask of God the Reasons of his Con∣duct. It is not meet for us to call him in ques∣tion, <HI>who giveth Account of None of his Ways;</HI> to demand, Why didst thou make Faith the Condition, the only Condition of Justification? Wherefore didst thou decr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, <HI>He that believeth,</HI> and he only. <HI>shall be saved?</HI> This is the very Point on which St. <HI>Paul</HI> so strongly insists in the Ninth Chapter of this Epistle, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Terms of Pardon and Acceptance must depend, not on us, but <HI>on him that calleth us:</HI> That there is no <HI>Unrighteousness with</HI> God, in fixing his
<PB N="107" REF="028060_0102_0FD68AC6DC5B9CF0"/>own Terms, not according to ours, but his own good Pleasure: who may justly say, <HI>I will have Mercy on whom I will have Mercy,</HI> namely, on him who believeth in Jesus. <HI>So then it is not of him that willeth, or of him that runneth,</HI> to chuse the Condition on which he shall find Acceptance; <HI>but of</HI> God <HI>that sheweth Mercy,</HI> that accepteth none at all, but of his own free Love, his unmerited Goodness. <HI>Therefore hath he Mercy on whom he will have Mercy,</HI> viz. on those who believe on the Son of his Love. <HI>And whom he will,</HI> that is, those who believe not, <HI>he hardeneth,</HI> leaves at last to the Hardness of their Hearts.</P>
<P N="8">8. One Reason, however, we may humbly conceive, of God's fixing this Condition of Justification, <HI>If thou believest in the Lord Je∣sus Christ thou shalt be saved,</HI> was to <HI>hide Pride from Man.</HI> Pride had already destroyed the very Angels of God, had cast down <HI>a third Part of the Stars of Heaven.</HI> It was like∣wise in great Measure owing to this, when the Tempter said, <HI>Ye shall be as Gods,</HI> that <HI>Adam</HI> fell from his own Stedfastness, and brought; Sin and Death into the World. It was therefore an Instance of Wisdom worthy of God, to ap∣point such a Condition of Reconciliation, for him and all his Posterity, as might effectually humble, might abase them to the Dust. And such is Faith. It is peculiarly fitted for this End. For he that cometh unto God by this Faith, must fix his Eye singly on h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wick∣edness, on his Guilt and Helph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> without having the least Regard to any supposed Good
<PB N="108" REF="028060_0103_0FD68AC85D8E8B28"/>in himself, to any Virtue or Righteousness whatsoever. He must come as a <HI>mere Sinner</HI> in∣wardly and outwardly, self-destroyed and self∣condemned, bringing nothing to God but Un∣godliness only, pleading nothing of his own but Sin and Misery. Thus it is, and thus alone, when his <HI>Mouth is stopped,</HI> and he stands utterly <HI>guilty before</HI>-God, that he can <HI>look unto Jesus,</HI> as the whole and sole <HI>Propitiation for his Sins.</HI> Thus only can he be <HI>found in him,</HI> and receive the <HI>Righteousness which is of</HI> God <HI>by Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Thou ungodly one, who hearest or readest these Words, thou vile, helpless, miserable Sin∣ner, I charge thee before God the Judge of all, go strait unto him, with all thy Ungodli∣ness. Take heed thou destroy not thy own Soul, by pleading thy Righteousness, more or less. Go as altogether ungodly, guilty, lost, destroyed, deserving and dropping into Hell: And thou shalt then find Favour in his Sight, and know that he justifieth the Ungodly. As such thou shalt be brought unto the <HI>Blood of Sprinkling,</HI> as an undone, helpless, damned Sin∣ner. Thus <HI>look unto Jesus!</HI> There is <HI>the Lamb of</HI> God, who <HI>taketh away</HI> thy <HI>Sins!</HI> Plead thou no Works, no Righteousness of thine own! No Humility, Contrition, Sincerity. In no wise. That were, in very Deed, to deny the Lord that bought thee. No. Plead thou singly, the Blood of the Covenant, the Ransom paid for thy proud, stubborn, sinful Soul. Who art thou, that now seest and feelest both thine in∣ward and outward Ungodliness! Thou art the
<PB N="109" REF="028060_0104_0FD68ACAAAA459F0"/>Man! I want thee for my Lord, I challenge <HI>Thee</HI> for a Child of God by Faith. The Lord hath need of Thee. Thou who feelest thou art just fit for Hell, art just fit to advance his Glo∣ry: The Glory of his free Grace, justifying the Ungodly and him that worketh not. O come quickly. Believe in the Lord Jesus: and <HI>thou,</HI> even <HI>thou</HI> art reconciled to God.</P>

<P><HI>Moses</HI> describeth the Righteousness which is of the Law, that the Man which doeth those Things shall live by them.</P>
<P>But the Righteousness which is of Faith speaketh on this wise. Say not in thine Heart, who shall ascend into Heaven? that is, to bring Christ down from Above:</P>
<P>Or who shall descend into the Deep? that is, to bring Christ again from the Dead.</P>
<P>But what saith it? The Word is nigh thee, even in thy Mouth and in thy Heart; that is the Word of Faith, which we preach.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. THE Apostle doēs not here oppose the Co∣venant given by <HI>Moses,</HI> to the Covenant given by Christ. If we ever imagined this, it was for want of observing, that the latter, as well as the former Part of these Words, were spoken by <HI>Moses</HI> himself, to the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> and that, concerning the Covenant which then was. (<HI>Deut.</HI> xxx. 11, 12, 14.) But it is the Covenant of <HI>Grace,</HI> which God through Christ hath establish∣ed with Men in all Ages, (as well before and under the <HI>Jewish</HI> Dispensation, as since God was manifest in the Flesh) which St. <HI>Paul</HI> here opposes to the Covenant of <HI>Works,</HI> made with <HI>Adam</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="028060_0107_0FD62874E2656798"/>while in Paradise; but commonly supposed to be the only Covenant which God had made with Man, particularly by those <HI>Jews</HI> of whom the A∣postle writes.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of these it was that he so affectionately speaks, in the Beginning of this Chapter. <HI>My Heart's Desire and Prayer to God for Israel is, that they may be saved. For I bear them Record, that they have a Zeal for</HI> God, <HI>but not according to Knowledge. For they being ignorant of</HI> God's <HI>Righteousness</HI> (of the Justification that flows from his mere Grace and Mercy, freely forgiving our Sins through the Son of his Love, through the Redemption which is in Jesus) <HI>and seeking to esta∣blish their own Righteousness,</HI> (their own Holiness, antecedent to Faith, in <HI>him that justifieth the Ʋn∣godly,</HI> as the Ground of their Pardon and Accep∣tance) <HI>have not submitted themselves unto the Righte∣ousness of</HI> God, and consequently seek Death in the Error of their Life.</P>
<P N="4">4. They were ignorant, that <HI>Christ is the End of the Law for Righteousness to every one that be∣lieveth,</HI> that by the Oblation of himself once of∣fered, he had put an End to the first Law or Co∣venant (which indeed was not given by God to <HI>Moses,</HI> but to <HI>Adam</HI> in his State of Innocence) the strict Tenor whereof, without any Abate∣ment was; "Do this and live:" And at the same time purchased for us that better Covenant, "Believe and live;" Believe and thou shalt be saved; now faved both from the Guilt and Power of Sin, and, of Consequence, from the Wages of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P N="4">4. And how many are equally ignorant now, even among those who are called by the Name
<PB N="115" REF="028060_0108_0FD68AD5D4671D30"/>of Christ? How many who have now a <HI>Zeal for God,</HI> yet have it not <HI>according to Knowledge:</HI> But are still <HI>seeking to establish their own Righte∣ousness,</HI> as the Ground of their Pardon and Ac∣ceptance; and therefore vehemently refuse, to <HI>submit themselves unto the Righteousness of</HI> God? Surely my Heart's Desire, and Prayer to God for you, Brethren, is, that ye may be saved. And in order to remove this grand Stumbling-block out of your Way, I will endeavour to shew, first, What <HI>the Righteousness</HI> is, <HI>which is of the Law,</HI> and what <HI>the Righteousness which is of Faith;</HI> Secondly, The Folly of trusting in <HI>the Righteousness of the Law,</HI> and the Wisdom of <HI>submitting to that which is of Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. 1. And, first, <HI>The Righteousness which is of the Law, saith, the Man which doth these Things, shall live by them.</HI> Constantly and perfectly ob∣serve all these Things to do them, and then thou shalt live for ever. This Law or Covenant (usu∣ally called, The Covenant of <HI>Works</HI>) given by God to Man in Paradise, required an Obedience, perfect in all its Parts, entire and wanting no∣thing, as the Condition of his eternal Continu∣ance, in the Holiness and Happiness wherein he was created.</P>
<P N="2">2. It required, that Man should fulfil all Righteousness, inward and outward, negative and positive: That he should not only abstain from every idle Word, and avoid every evil Work, but should keep every Affection, every Desire, every Thought in Obedience to the Will of God. That he should continue holy, as he which had created him was holy, both in Heart
<PB N="116" REF="028060_0109_0FD68ADE2E6CCBD0"/>and in all Manner of Conversation: That he should be pure in Heart, even as God is pure: perfect as his Father in Heaven was perfect: That he should love the Lord his God with all his Heart, with all his Soul, with all his Mind, and with all his Strength: That he should love every Soul which God had made, even as God had loved him: That by this universal Benevo∣lence, he should <HI>dwell in God</HI> (who is Love) <HI>and</HI> God <HI>in him:</HI> That he should serve the Lord his God with all his Strength, and in all Things sing∣ly aim at his Glory.</P>
<P N="3">3. These were the Things which the Righte∣ousness of the Law required, that he who did them might live thereby. But it farther required. That this entire Obedience to God, this inward and outward Holiness, this Conformity both of Heart and Life to his Will, should be perfect in <HI>Degree.</HI> No Abatement, no Allowance could possibly be made, for falling short in any Degree, as to any Jot or Tittle either of the outward or the inward Law. If every Commandment re∣lating to outward Things was obeyed, yet that was not sufficient, unless every one was obeyed with all the Strength, in the highest Measure, and most perfect Manner. Nor did it answer the Demand of this Covenant, to love God with every Power and Faculty, unless he were loved with the full Capacity of each, with the whole Possibility of the Soul.</P>
<P N="4">4. One Thing more was indispensably required by the Righteousness of the Law, namely, that this universal Obedience, this perfect Holiness both of Heart and Life, should be perfectly unin∣terrupted also, should continue without any In∣termission,
<PB N="117" REF="028060_0110_0FD68ADFAA016EE8"/>from the Moment wherein God cre∣ated Man, and breathed into his Nostrile the Breath of Life, until the Days of his Trial should be ended, and he should be confirmed in Life everlasting.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Righteousness then which is of the Law, speaketh on this wise. "Thou, O Man of God, stand fast in Love, in the Image of God, wherein thou art made. If then wilt re∣main in Life, keep the Commandments, which are now written in thy Heart. Love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart. Love as thyself every Soul that he hath made. Desire nothing but God. Aim at God in every Thought, in every Word and Work. Swerve not in one Motion of Body or Soul, from him thy Mark and the Prize of thy high Calling. And let all that is in thee praise his holy Name, every Power and Faculty of thy Soul, in every Kind, in every Degree, and at every Moment of thine Existence. <HI>This do, and thou shalt live:</HI> Thy Light shall shine, thy Love shall slame more and more, till thou art received up into the House of God in the Heavens, to reign with him for ever and ever."</P>
<P N="6">6. <Q>But the Righteousness which is of Faith speaketh on this wise: Say not i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thine Heart, who shall ascend into Heaven, that is, to bring down Christ from Above</Q> (as tho' it were some impossible Task, which God required thee previously to per∣form, in order to thine Acceptance:) <Q>Or, who shall descend into the Deep, that is, to bring up Christ from the Dead;</Q> (as tho' that were still re∣maining to be done, for the sake of which thou wert to be accepted.) <Q>But what saith it? The
<PB N="118" REF="028060_0111_0FD68AE11B9F3E48"/>Word</Q> (according to the Tenor of which, thou mayest now be accepted as an Heir of Life eternal) <Q>is nigh thee, even in thy Mouth and in thy Heart, that is, the Word of Faith, which we preach:</Q> The new Covenant which God hath now established with sinful Man, through Christ Jesus.</P>
<P N="7">7. 'By the Righteousness which is of Faith,' is meant, that Condition of Justification (and in Consequence of present and final Salvation, if we endure therein unto the End) which was given by God to <HI>fallen Man,</HI> through the Merits and Mediation of his only begotten Son. This was in Part revealed to <HI>Adam</HI> soon after his Fall, being contained in the Original Promise, made to him and his Seed, concerning the Seed of the Woman, who should <HI>bruise the</HI> Serpent's <HI>Head</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. iii. 15.</NOTE>. It was a little more clearly revealed to <HI>Abraham,</HI> by the Angel of God from Heaven, saying,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxii. 15, 18.</NOTE> <Q>By Myself have i sworn, saith the Lord, that in thy Seed shall all the Nations of the Earth be blessed.</Q> It was yet more fully made known to <HI>Moses,</HI> to <HI>Da∣vid,</HI> and to the Prophets that followed: And through them, to many of the People of God, in their respective Generations. But still the Bulk even of these were ignorant of it; and very few understood it clearly. Still <HI>Life and Immortality</HI> were not so <HI>brought to Light <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jews</HI> of old, as they are now unto us <HI>by the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Now this Covenant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>unful Man, "Perform unsinning Obedience and live." If this were the Term, he would have no more Be∣nefit by all which Christ hath done and suffered
<PB N="119" REF="028060_0112_0FD68AE45A545370"/>for him, than if he was required, in order to Life, to <HI>ascend into Heaven and bring down Christ from Above;</HI> or to <HI>descend into the Deep,</HI> into the invi∣sible World, and <HI>bring up Christ from the Dead.</HI> It doth not require any Impossibily to be done (altho' to mere Man, what it requires would be impossible; but not, to Man assisted by the Spirit of God:) this were only, to mock human Weak∣ness. Indeed, strictly speaking, the Covenant of <HI>Grace</HI> doth not requre us, to <HI>do</HI> any thing at all, as absolutely and indispensably necessary in order to our Justification: But only, to believe in him, who, for the Sake of his Son, and the Propitia∣tion which he hath made, <Q>justifieth the Ungodly that worketh not,</Q> and imputes his Faith to him for Righteousness. Even so <Q>Abraham believed in the Lord<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Gen. xv. 6.</NOTE> and he counted it to him for Righteous∣ness.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. II.</NOTE> And he received the Sign of Circumcision, a Seal of the Righteousness of Faith—that he might be the Father of all them that believe—that Righteousness might be imputed unto them also.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ver. 23, 24, 25.</NOTE> Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it (i. e. Faith) was imputed to him. But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed</Q> (to whom Faith shall be imputed for Righteousness, shall stand in the Stead of perfect Obedience, in order to our Acceptance with God) <Q>if we believe on him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the Dead: Who was delivered' to Death 'for our Offences, and was raised again for our Justification:</Q> "For the Assurance of the Remission of Sins, and of a se∣cond Life to come to them that believe."</P>
<P N="9">9. What saith then the Covenant of Forgiveness, of unmerited Love, of pardoning Mercy? <HI>Believe
<PB N="120" REF="028060_0113_0FD68AE595DD1778"/>in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.</HI> In the Day thou believest, thou shalt surely live. Thou shalt be restored to the Favour of God; and in his Favour is Life. Thou shalt be saved from the Curse and from the Wrath of God. Thou shalt be quickened from the Death of Sin, into the Life of Righteousness. And if thou en∣dure to the End, believing in Jesus, thou shalt ne∣ver taste the second Death, but having suffered with thy Lord, shalt also live and reign with him for ever and ever.</P>
<P N="10">10. Now <HI>this word is nigh thee.</HI> This Condi∣tion of Life, is plain, easy, always at hand. <HI>It is in thy Mouth and in thy Heart,</HI> through the Operation of the Spirit of God. The Moment <HI>thou believest in thine Heart</HI> in him, whom God <HI>hath raised from the Dead,</HI> and <HI>confessest with thy Mouth the Lord Jesus,</HI> as <HI>thy</HI> Lord and <HI>thy</HI> God, <HI>thou shalt be saved</HI> from Condemnation, from the Guilt and Punishment of thy <HI>former</HI> Sins, and shalt have Power to serve God in true Holiness, all the <HI>remaining</HI> Days of thy Life.</P>
<P N="11">11. What is the Difference then between the <HI>Righteousness which is of the Law,</HI> and the <HI>Righte∣ousness which is of Faith?</HI> Between the First Co∣venant, or the Covenant of Works, and the Se∣cond, the Covenant of Grace? The essential, unchangeable Difference is this: The one sup∣poses him to whom it is given, to be already holy and happy, created in the image and enjoying the Favour of God; and prescribes the Condition whereon he may continue therein, in Love and Joy, Life and Immortality. The other supposes him to whom it is given, to be now unholy and unhappy; fallen short of the glorious Image of
<PB N="121" REF="028060_0114_0FD68AEC321E2788"/>God, having the Wrath of God abiding on him, and hastening through Sin, whereby his Soul is dead, to bodily Death, and Death everlasting. And to Man in this State, it prescribes the Con∣dition, whereon he may regain the Pearl he has lost: May recover the Favour, and the Image of God, may retrieve the Life of God in his Soul, and be restored to the Knowledge and the Love of God, which is the Beginning of Life eternal.</P>
<P N="12">12. Again, the Covenant of Works, in order to Man's <HI>Continuance</HI> in the Favour of God, in his Knowledge and Love, in Holiness and Hap∣piness, required of perfect Man, a <HI>perfect</HI> and un∣interrupted <HI>Obedience,</HI> to every Point of the Law of God. Whereas the Covenant of Grace, in or∣der to Man's <HI>Recovery,</HI> of the Favour and Life of God, requires only <HI>Faith;</HI> living Faith in him who through God justifies him that <HI>obeyed not.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. Yet again: The Covenant of Works re∣quired of <HI>Adam</HI> and all his Children, to <HI>pay the Price themselves,</HI> in Consideration of which, they were to receive all the future Blessings of God. But in the Covenant of Grace, seeing we have nothing to pay, God <HI>frankly forgives us all:</HI> Provided only, that we believe in him, who hath <HI>paid the Frice for us;</HI> who hath given himself a <HI>Propitiation for our Sins, for the Sins of the whole World.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. Thus the first Covenant required what is now <HI>afar off</HI> from all the Children of Men; namely, unlinning Obedience, which is far from those who are <HI>conceived and born in Sin.</HI> Where∣as the second requires what is nigh at hand; as tho' it should say, Thou art Sin! God is Love. Thou by Sin art fallen short of the Glory of
<PB N="122" REF="028060_0115_0FD68AED9E1A4C80"/>God; yet there is Mercy with him. Bring then all thy Sins to the Pardoning God, and they shall vanish away as a Cloud. If thou wert not ungodly, there would be no room for him to jus∣tify thee as ungodly. But now draw near, in full Assurance of Faith. He speaketh, and it is done. Fear not, only believe; for even the just God <HI>justifieth all that believe in Jesus.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. 1. These Things considered, it will be easy to shew, as I proposed to do in the second Place, the Folly of trusting in the <HI>Righteousness which is of the Law,</HI> and the Wisdom of <HI>submitting to the Righteousness which is of Faith.</HI></P>
<P>The Folly of those who still trust, in the <HI>Righteousness which is of the Law,</HI> the Terms of which are, Do this and live, may abundantly appear from hence. They set out wrong. Their very first Step is a fundamental Mistake. For before they can ever think of claiming any Bles∣sing on the Terms of this Covenant, they must suppose themselves to be in his State, with whom this Covenant was made. But how vain a Sup∣position is this? Since it was made with <HI>Adam</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> State of Innocence. How weak therefore must that whole Building be, which stands on such a Foundation? And how foolish are they who thus build on the Sand? Who seem never to have considered, that the Covenant of Works was not given to Man, when he was dead in Tres∣passes and Sins, but when he was alive to God, when he knew no Sin, but was holy as God is holy: Who forget, that it was never design'd for the <HI>Recovery</HI> of the Favour and Life of God once lost, but only for the <HI>Continuance</HI> and In∣crease
<PB N="123" REF="028060_0116_0FD68AF0DF393D88"/>thereof, till it should be compleat in Life everlasting.</P>
<P N="2">2. Neither do they consider, who are thus <HI>seeking to establish their own Righteousness which is of the Law,</HI> what manner of Obedience or Righ∣teousness that is, which the Law indispensably requires. It must be perfect and entire, in every Point, or it answers not the Demand of the Law. But which of you is able to perform such Obe∣dience? Or, consequently, to live thereby? Who among you fulfils every Jot and Tittle even of the outward Commandments of God? Doing nothing, great or small, which God forbids? Leaving nothing undone which he enjoins? Speaking no <HI>idle Word?</HI> Having your Conver∣sation always <HI>meet to minister Grace to the Hear∣ers?</HI> And <HI>whether you eat or drink, or what∣ever you do,</HI> doing <HI>all to the Glory of</HI> God? And how much less are you able to fulfil all the inward Commandments of God? Those which require, that every Temper and motion of your Soul should be Holiness unto the Lord? Are you able, To <HI>love</HI> God <HI>with all your Heart?</HI> To love all Mankind as your own Soul? To <HI>pray without ceasing? In every Thing to give Thanks?</HI> To have God always before you? And to keep every Affection, Desire and Thought, in Obe∣dience to his Law?</P>
<P N="3">3. You should farther consider, That the Righ∣teousness of the Law requires, not only the obeying every Command of God, negative and positive, internal and external, but likewise in the perfect Degree. In every instance whatever, the Voice of the Law is, Thou shalt serve the Lord thy God with all thy Strength. It allows no Abate∣ment
<PB N="124" REF="028060_0117_0FD68AF0E3A434E0"/>of any Kind. It excuses no Defect. It condemns every coming short of the full Measure of Obedience, and immediately pronounces a Curse on the Offender. It regards only the in∣variable Rules of Justice, and saith, "I know not to shew Mercy."</P>
<P N="4">4. Who then can appear before such a Judge, which is <HI>extreme to mark what is done amiss?</HI> How weak are they who desire to be tried at the Bar, where <HI>no Flesh living can be justified?</HI> None of the Offspring of <HI>Adam.</HI> For suppose we did now keep every Commandment with all our Strength: Yet one single Breach which ever was, utterly de∣stroys our whole Claim to Life. If we have ever offended in any one Point, this Righteous∣ness is at an end. For the Law condemns all who do not perform uninterrupted as well as per∣fect Obedience. So that according to the Sen∣tence of this, for him who hath once finned, in any Degree, <HI>there remaineth only a fearful Look∣ing for of fiery Indignation, which shall devour the Adversaries</HI> of God.</P>
<P N="5">5. Is it not then the very Foolishness of Folly, for fallen Man to seek Life by this Righteousness? For Man, who was <HI>shapen in Wickedness,</HI> and <HI>in Sin did his Mother conceive him:</HI> Man, who is by Nature all <HI>earthly, sensual, devilish,</HI> altogether <HI>corrupt and abominable:</HI> In whom, till he find Grace, <HI>dwelleth no good Thing;</HI> nay, who can∣not of himself think one good Thought? Who is indeed all Sin, a mere Lump of Ungodliness, and who commits Sin in every Breath he draws; whose actual Transgressions, in Word and Deed, are more in Number than the Hairs of his Head! What Stupidity, what Senselesness must it be
<PB N="125" REF="028060_0118_0FD68AF45DB583B8"/>for such an unclean, guilty, helpless Worm as this, to dream of seeking Acceptance by <HI>his own Righteousness,</HI> of living by <HI>the Righteousness</HI> which <HI>is of the Law?</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Now whatsoever Considerations prove the Folly of trusting in the <HI>Righteousness which is of the Law,</HI> prove equally the Wisdom of submit∣ting to <HI>the Righteousness which is of</HI> God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Faith.</HI> This were easy to be shewn with regard to each of the preceding Considerations. But to wave this, the Wisdom of the first step hereto, the disclaiming our own Righteousness, plainly appears from hence, That it is acting according to Truth, to the real Nature of Things. For what is it more, than to acknowledge with our Heart as well as Lips, the true State wherein we are? To acknowledge, that we bring with us into the World, a corrupt, sinful Nature; more corrupt indeed than we can easily conceive, or find Words to express? That hereby we are prone to all that is evil, and averse from all that is good; that we are full of Pride, Self-will, un∣ruly Passions, foolish Desires, vile and inordi∣nate Affections; Lovers of the World, Lovers of Pleasure more than Lovers of God? That our Lives have been no better than our Hearts, but many ways ungodly and unholy; insomuch that our actual Sins, both in Word and Deed, have been as the Stars of Heaven for Multi∣tude: That on all these Accounts, we are dis∣pleasing to him, who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity; and deserve nothing from him, but Indignation and Wrath and Death, the due Wages of Sin? That we cannot by any of our Righteousness, (for indeed, we have none at all)
<PB N="126" REF="028060_0119_0FD68AF573AAF590"/>nor by any of our Works (for they are as the Tree from which they grow) appease the Wrath of God, or avert the Punishment we have justly deserved; Yea, that, if left to ourselves, we shall only was worse and worse, sink deeper and deeper into Sin, offend God more and more both with our evil Works, and with the evil Tempers of our carnal Mind, till we fill up the Measure of our Iniquities, and bring upon our∣selves swist Destruction? And is not this the very State wherein by Nature we are? To ac∣knowledge this then, both with our Heart and Lips, that is, to disclaim our own Righteousness, <HI>the Righteousness which is of the Law,</HI> is to act according to the Real Nature of Things, and consequently is an instance of true Wisdom.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Wisdom of submitting to <HI>the Righte∣ousness of Faith,</HI> appears farther from this Con∣sideration. That it is the Righteousness of God: I mean here, It is that Method of Reconcilia∣tion with God, which hath been chose and esta∣blished by God himself, not only as he is the God of Wisdom, but as he is the Sovereign Lord of Heaven and Earth, and of every Creature which he hath made. Now as it is not meet for Man to say unto God. What dost thou? As none who is not utterly void of Understanding, will contend with one that is mightier than he, with him whose Kingdom ruleth over all; so it is true Wisdom, it is a Mark of sound Understand∣ing, to acquiesce in whatever he hath chosen, to say in this, as in all Things, "It is the Lord. Let him do what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eemeth him Good."</P>
<P N="8">8. It may be farther considered. That it was of mere Grace, of free Love, of undeserved
<PB N="127" REF="028060_0120_0FD68AF6D6C767D8"/>Mercy, that God hath vouchsafed to sinful Man, any way of Reconciliation with himself, that we were not out away from his Hand, and utterly blotted out of his Remembrance. Therefore whatever Method he is pleased to appoint, of his tender Mercy, of his unmerited Goodness, whereby his Enemies, who have so deeply re∣volted from him, so long and obstinately rebelled against him, may still find Favour in his Sight, it is doubtless our Wisdom to accept with all Thankfulness.</P>
<P N="9">9. To mention but one Consideration more. It is wisdom to aim at the best End by the best Means. Now the best End which any Creature can pursue, is Happiness in God. And the best End a fallen Creature can pursue is, The Re∣covery of the Favour and Image of God. But the best, indeed the only Means under Heaven given to Man, whereby he may regain the Fa∣vour of God, which is better than Life itself, or the Image of God, which is the true Life of the Soul, is the submitting to the <HI>Righteousness which is of Faith,</HI> the believing in the only be∣gotten Son of God.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. Whosoever therefore thou art who de∣sirest to be forgiven and reconciled to the Favour of God; Do not say in thy Heart, "I must <HI>first do this;</HI> I must <HI>first</HI> conquer every Sin; break off every evil Word and Work, and do all Good to all Men: Or, I must <HI>first</HI> go to Church, receive the Lord's Supper, hear more Sermons, and say more Prayers." Alas, my Brother, thou art clean gone out of the Way. Thou art still <HI>ignorant of the Righteousness of</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="028060_0121_0FD68AF86FE3DF58"/>God, and art <HI>seeking to establish thy own Righ∣teousness,</HI> as the Ground of thy Reconciliation. Knowest thou not, that thou canst do nothing but sin, till thou art reconciled to God? Where∣fore then dost thou say, I <HI>must do this</HI> and this <HI>first,</HI> and then I shall believe. Nay, but <HI>First Believe.</HI> Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, the Propitiation for thy Sins. Let this good Foun∣dation <HI>first</HI> be laid, and then thou shalt do all Things well.</P>
<P N="2">2. Neither say in thy Heart, "I can't be ac∣cepted yet, because I am not <HI>good enough.</HI>" Who is <HI>good enough?</HI> Who ever was? To merit Ac∣ceptance at God's Hands! Was ever any Child of <HI>Adam good enough</HI> for this? Or will any, till the Consummation of all Things? And as for thee, thou art not good at all: There dwelleth in thee no good Thing. And thou never wilt be, till thou believe in Jesus. Rather thou wilt find thyself worse and worse. But is there any need of being worse, in order to be accepted? Art thou not <HI>bad enough</HI> already? Indeed thou art, and that God knoweth. And thou thyself canst not deny it. Then delay not. All Things are now ready. <HI>Arise and wash away thy Sins.</HI> The Fountain is open. Now is the Time, to wash thee white in the Blood of the Lamb. Now he shall <HI>purge</HI> thee as <HI>with Hyssop, and</HI> thou <HI>shalt be clean; he</HI> shall <HI>wash</HI> thee, and thou <HI>shalt be whiter than Snow.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Do not say, "But I am not <HI>contrite enough:</HI> I am not <HI>sensible enough</HI> of my Sins." I know it. I would to God, thou wert more <HI>sensible</HI> of them, more <HI>contrite</HI> a thousand fold than thou art. But do not stay for this. It may be God will make
<PB N="129" REF="028060_0122_0FD68AFDD8BBFC48"/>thee so, not before thou believest, but by be∣lieving. It may be, thou wilt nor weep much, till thou lovest much, because thou hast had much forgiven. In the mean time, look unto Jesus. Behold how he loveth thee! What could he have done more for thee which he hath not done?
<Q><L>"O Lamb of God, was ever Pain,</L>
<L>Was ever Love like Thine!"</L></Q>
Look steadily upon him, till he looks on thee, and breaks thy hard Heart. Then shall thy <HI>Head</HI> be <HI>Waters, and</HI> thy <HI>Eyes Fountains of Tears.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Nor yet do thou say, "I must <HI>do</HI> some∣thing more, <HI>before</HI> I come to Christ." I grant, supposing thy Lord should delay his coming, it were meet and right to wait for his appearing, in doing so far as thou hast Power, whatsoever he hath commanded thee. But there is no Ne∣cessity for making such a Supposition. How know∣est thou that he will delay? Perhaps he will ap∣pear, as the Day-spring from on High, before the Morning-light. O do not set him a Time. Ex∣pect him every Hour. Now, he is nigh! Even at the Door!</P>
<P N="5">5. And to what End wouldst thou wait for <HI>more Sincerity, before</HI> thy Sins are blotted out? To make thee more worthy of the Grace of God? Alas, thou art still <HI>establishing thy own Righteous∣ness.</HI> He will have Mercy, not because thou art worthy of it, but because his Compassions fail not: Not because thou art righteous; but because Jesus Christ hath atoned for thy Sins.</P>
<P>Again, if there be any thing good in <HI>Sincerity,</HI> why dost thou expect it, <HI>before</HI> thou hast Faith? See∣ing
<PB N="130" REF="028060_0123_0FD68AFF20C68890"/>Faith itself is the only Root of whatever is really good and holy.</P>
<P>Above all, How long wilt thou forget, That whatsoever thou dost, or whatsoever thou hast, before thy Sins are forgiven thee, it avails nothing with God, toward the procuring of thy For∣giveness? Yea, and that it must all be cast be∣hind thy Back, trampled under Foot, made no Account of, or thou wilt never find Favour in God's Sight; because until then thou canst not ask it, as a mere Sinner, guilty, lost, undone, having nothing to plead, nothing to offer to God, but only the Merits of his well-beloved Son, <HI>who loved</HI> thee, <HI>and gave himself for</HI> thee.</P>
<P N="6">6. To conlude. Whosoever thou art, O Man, who hast the Sentence of Death in thy∣self, who feelest thyself a condemned Sinner, and hast the Wrath of God abiding on thee: Unto thee saith the Lord, Not, Do this: per∣fectly obey all my Commands and live: But, <HI>Be∣lieve in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved. The Word of Faith is nigh unto thee;</HI> Now, at this instant, in the present Moment, and in thy present State, Sinner as thou art, just as thou art, Believe the Gospel: And <HI>I will be merciful unto</HI> thy <HI>Unrighteousness and</HI> thy <HI>Iniqui∣ties will I remember no more.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>MARK i. 15.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>God</HI> is at hand: Repent ye, and believe the Gospel.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE Words naturally lead us to consi∣der, First, The Nature of True Religion, here termed by our Lord, <HI>The Kingdom of</HI> God, which, saith he, <HI>is at hand:</HI> And Secondly, The Way thereto, which he points out in those Words, <HI>Repent ye, and believe the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. 1. We are First, to consider, The Na∣ture of True Religion, here term'd by our Lord, <HI>The Kingdom of</HI> God. The same Expression the great Apostle uses in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> where he likewise explains his Lord's Words, saying, <HI>The Kingdom of</HI> God <HI>is not Meat and Drink; but Righteousness, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost.</HI> Chap. xiv. 17.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Kingdom of</HI> God, or True Religion, <HI>is not Meat and Drink.</HI> It is well known, that not only the unconverted Jews, but great Num∣bers of those who had received the Faith of Christ, were notwithstanding <HI>zealous of the Law,</HI> (<HI>Acts</HI> xxi. 20.) even the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Moses.</HI> Whatsoever therefore they found written therein, either concerning Meat and Drink-Offerings,
<PB N="134" REF="028060_0126_0FD68B03AC84BA80"/>or the Distinction between clean and unclean Meats, they not only observed them∣selves, but vehemently press'd the same, even on those <HI>among the Gentiles</HI> (or Heathens) <HI>who were turned to</HI> God. Yea, to such a Degree, that so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of them taught, wheresoever they came a∣mong them, <HI>Except ye be circumcised, and keep the Law</HI> (the whole Ritual Law) <HI>ye cannot be saved.</HI> Acts xv. 1, 24.</P>
<P N="3">3. In Opposition to these, the Apostle de∣clares, both here and in many other Places, That True Religion, does not consist in <HI>Meat</HI> and <HI>Drink,</HI> or in any Ritual Observances: Nor in∣deed in any outward Thing whatever, in any Thing exterior to the Heart; the whole Sub∣stance thereof lying in <HI>Righteousness, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Not in any <HI>outward Things;</HI> such as <HI>Forms</HI> or <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> even of the most excellent Kind. Supposing these to be ever so decent and signifi∣cant, ever so expressive of inward Things: Sup∣posing them ever so helpful, not only to the Vul∣gar, whose Thought reaches little farther than their Sight; but even to Men of Understanding, Men of stronger Capacities, as doubtless they may sometimes be: Yea, supposing them, as in the Case of the Jews, to be appointed by God himself; yet even during the Period of Time wherein that Appointment remains in Force, True Religion does not principally consist there∣in; nay, strictly speaking, not at all. How much more must this hold concerning such Rights and Forms, as are only of Human Appointment? The Religion of Christ rises infinitely higher, and lies immensely deeper than all these. These
<PB N="135" REF="028060_0127_0FD68B081B7B9560"/>are good in their Place; just so far as they are in fact subservient to true Religion. And it were Superstition to object against them, while they are applied only as occasional Helps to Human Weakness. But let no Man carry them farther. Let no Man dream, that they have any intrinsic Worth; or that Religion cannot subsist without them. This were to make them an Abomination to the Lord.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Nature of Religion is so far from con∣sisting in these, in <HI>Forms</HI> of Worship, or <HI>Rites</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> that it does not properly consist in any <HI>outward Actions,</HI> of what Kind soever. It is true, a Man cannot have any Religion, who is guilty of vicious, immoral Actions; or who does to others, what he would not they should do to him, if he were in the same Circumstance. And it is also true, that he can have no real Religion, who <HI>knows to do good, and doth it not.</HI> Yet may a Man both abstain from outward Evil, and do Good, and still have no Religion. Yea, two Persons may do the same outward Work, suppose, Feeding the Hungry, or Cloathing the Naked: And, in the Mean Time, one of these may be truly Religious, and the other have no Religion at all: For the one may act from the Love of God, and the other from the Love of Praise. So manifest it is; that altho' true Religion natu∣rally leads to every good Word and Work, yet the Real Nature thereof lies deeper still, even in <HI>the Hidden Man of the Heart.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. I say of <HI>the Heart.</HI> For neither does Re∣ligion consist in <HI>Orthodoxy</HI> or <HI>Right Opinions;</HI> which altho' they are not properly outward things, and not in the Heart, but the Understanding.
<PB N="136" REF="028060_0128_0FD68B0B6936DB88"/>A Man may be orthodox in every Point; he may not only espouse Right Opinions, but zealously defend them against all Opposers: He may think justly concerning the Incarnation of our Lord, concerning the ever blessed Trinity, and every other Doctrine, contained in the Oracles of God: He may assent to all the three Creeds; that called The Apostles, the <HI>Nicene,</HI> and the <HI>Atha∣nasian:</HI> And yet 'tis possible, he may have no Religion at all, no more than a <HI>Jew, Turk,</HI> or <HI>Pagan.</HI> He may be almost as orthodox as — the Devil; (tho' indeed, not altogether. For every Man errs in something; whereas we can't well conceive him to hold any erroneous Opinion) and may all the while be as great a Stranger as he to the Religion of the Heart.</P>
<P N="7">7. This alone is Religion, truly so called: This alone is in the Sight of God of great Price. The Apostle sums it all up in three Particulars, <HI>Righ∣teousness, and Pence, and Joy in the Holy Ghost.</HI> And first, <HI>Righteousness.</HI> We cannot be at a Loss concerning this, if we remember the Words of our Lord describing the two grand Branches thereof, or which <HI>hang all the Law and the Pro∣phets. Thou shalt love the Lord thy</HI> God <HI>with all thy Heart, and with all thy Mind, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mark xii. 30.</NOTE> <HI>Strength. This is the First and great Commandment,</HI> the first and great Branch of Christian Righteousness. Thou shalt delight thyself in the Lord thy God; thou shalt seek and find all Happiness in Him. He shall be <HI>thy Shield, and thy exceeding great Reward,</HI> in Time and in Eternity. All thy Bones shall say, <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but Thee? And there is
<PB N="137" REF="028060_0129_0FD68B0E65E28C20"/>none upon Earth that I desire beside thee!</HI> Thou shalt hear, and fulfil his Word who saith, <HI>My Son, give me thy Heart.</HI> And having given him thy Heart, thy inmost Soul, to reign there with∣out a Rival, thou may'st well cry out, in the Fulness of thy Heart, <HI>I will love thee, O Lord, my Strength. The Lord is my strong Rock, and my Defence: My Saviour, my</HI> God, <HI>and my Might, in whom I will trust; my Buckler, the Horn also of my Salvation, and my Refuge.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. And the Second Commandment is like unto this; the Second great Branch of Christian Righ∣teousness is closely and inseparably connected there∣with, even <HI>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy∣self. Thou shalt love</HI>— Thou shalt embrace with the most tender good-will, the most earnest and cordial Affection, the most inflamed Desires of pre∣venting or removing all Evil, and of procuring for him every possible Good—<HI>Thy Neighbour</HI>—that is, not only thy Friend, thy Kinsman, or thy Ac∣quaintance; not only the Virtuous, the Friendly, him that loves thee, that prevents or returns thy Kindness; but every Child of Man, every hu∣man Creature, every Soul which God hath made: Not excepting him whom thou never hast seen in the Flesh, whom thou knowest not either by Face or Name: Not excepting him whom thou know∣est to be evil and unthankful, him that still de∣spightfully uses and persecutes thee. Him thou shalt <HI>love as thyself;</HI> with the same invariable Thirst after his Happiness in every Kind: the same unwearied Care to skreen him from what∣ever might grieve or hurt either his Soul or Body.</P>
<P N="9">9. Now is not this Love <HI>The fulfilling of the Law?</HI> The Sum of all Christian Righteousness?
<PB N="138" REF="028060_0130_0FD68B0FEEDC0478"/>Of all inward Righteousness; for it necessarily im∣plies <HI>Bowels of Mercies, Humbleness of Mind</HI> (see∣ing <HI>Love is not puffed up) Gentleness, Meekness, Long-suffering,</HI> (for Love <HI>is not provoked</HI> but <HI>be∣lieveth, hopeth, endureth all Things</HI>) and of all out∣ward Righteousness; for <HI>Love worketh no Evil to his Neighbour,</HI> either by Word or Deed. It can∣not willingly either hurt or grieve any one. And it is zealous of Good Works. Every Lover of Mankind, as he hath Opportunity, <HI>doth good unto all Men,</HI> being <HI>(without Partiality and without Hypocrisy) full of Mercy and good Fruits.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. But true Religion, or a Heart right toward God and Man, implies Happiness as well as Ho∣liness. For it is not only <HI>Righteousness</HI> but also <HI>Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost.</HI> What Peace? <HI>The Peace of</HI> God, which God only can give and the World cannot take away: The Peace which <HI>passeth all Understanding,</HI> all (barely) rati∣onal Conception; being a supernatural Sensation, a divine Taste of <HI>the Powers of the World to come:</HI> Such as the natural Man knoweth not, how wise soever in the Things of this World: Nor indeed can he know it, in his present State, <HI>because it is spiritually discerned.</HI> It is a Peace that banishes all Doubt, all painful Uncertainty; the Spirit of God <HI>bearing witness with the Spirit</HI> of a Christi∣an, that he is <HI>a Child of</HI> God. And it banishes Fear, all such Fear as hath Torment; the Fear of the Wrath of God, the Fear of Hell, the Fear of the Devil, and in particular, the Fear of Death: he that hath the Peace of God, <HI>desiring</HI> (if it were the Will of God) <HI>to depart and to be with Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="11"><PB N="139" REF="028060_0131_0FD68B1119DEA288"/>
11. With this Peace of God, wherever it is fixed in the Soul, there is also <HI>Joy in the Holy Ghost;</HI> Joy wrought in the Heart by the Holy Ghost, by the ever blessed Spirit of God. He it is that worketh in us that calm, humble Rejoicing in God, through Christ Jesus, <HI>by whom we have now received the Atonement,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the Re∣conciliation with God; and that enables us bold∣ly to confirm the Truth of the Royal Psalmist's Declaration, <HI>Blessed is the Man</HI> (or rather <HI>happy</HI>) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>whose Unrighteousness is forgiven, and whose Sin is covered.</HI> He it is that inspires the Christian Soul, with that even, solid Joy, which arises from the Testimony of the Spirit, that he is a Child of God: And that gives him to <HI>rejoice with Joy unspeakable, in Hope of the Glory of</HI> God: Hope, both of the glorious Image of God, which is in part and shall be fully <HI>revealed in him;</HI> and of that Crown of Glory, which fadeth not away, reserved in Heaven for him.</P>
<P N="12">12. This Holiness and happiness joined in one, are sometimes stiled in the inspired Writings, <HI>the Kingdom of</HI> God, (as by our Lord in the Text) and sometimes, <HI>The Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> It is termed, <HI>the Kingdom of</HI> God, because it is the im∣mediate Fruit of God's reigning in the Soul. So soon as ever he takes unto himself his mighty Power, and sets up his Throne in our Hearts, they are instantly filled with this <HI>Righteousness and Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost.</HI> It is called <HI>the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> because it is (in a Degree) Heaven opened in the Soul. For whosoever they are that experience this, they can aver before Angels and Men,

<Q><L>"Everlasting Life is won:</L>
<L>Glory is on Earth begun.</L></Q>
According to the constant Tenor of Scripture, which every where bears Record, God <HI>hath given unto us eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son. He that hath the Son</HI> (reigning in his Heart) <HI>hath Life,</HI> even Life everlasting 1 <HI>John</HI> v. 11, 12, <HI>For this is Life eternal, to know thee, the only true</HI> God, <HI>and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent,</HI> John xvii. 3. And they to whom this is given, may confidently address God, tho' they were in the midst of a fiery Furnace.</P>
<Q><L>"Thee—Lord, safe shielded by thy Pow'r,</L>

<P N="10">10. And this <HI>Kingdom of</HI> God or of Heaven <HI>is at hand.</HI> As these Words were originally spoken, they implied, that <HI>the Time</HI> was then <HI>ful∣filled,</HI> God being <HI>made manifest in the Flesh,</HI> when he would set up his Kingdom among Men, and reign in the Hearts of his People. And is not the Time now fulfilled? For <HI>lo!</HI> saith he, <HI>I am with you always,</HI> you who preach Remission of Sins in my Name, <HI>even unto the End of the World.</HI> (Matt. xxviii. 20.) Wheresoever therefore the Gospel of Christ is preached, this his <HI>Kingdom is nigh at hand.</HI> It is not far from every one of you. Ye may this Hour enter thereinto, if so be ye
<PB N="141" REF="028060_0133_0FD68B1486C9C718"/>hearken to his Voice, <HI>Repent ye, and believe the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. 1. This is the Way. Walk ye in it. And first, Repent, that is, Know yourselves. This is the first Repentance, previous to Faith; even Conviction, or Self-Knowledge. Awake then thou that sleepest. Know thyself to be a Sinner, and what Manner of Sinner thou art. Know that Corruption of thy inmost Nature, whereby thou art very far gone from Original Righteousness, whereby <HI>the Flesh lusteth</HI> always <HI>contrary to the Spirit,</HI> through that <HI>carnal Mind which is Enmity against</HI> God, which <HI>is not subject to the Law of</HI> God, <HI>neither indeed can be.</HI> Know that thou art corrupted in every Power, in every Faculty of thy Soul; that thou art totally corrupted in every one of these, all the Foundations being out of Course. The Eyes of thine Understanding are darkened, so that they cannot discern God or the Things of God. The Clouds of Ignorance and Error rest upon thee, and cover thee with the Shadow of Death. Thou knowest nothing yet, as thou oughtest to know, neither God, nor the World, nor thyself. Thy Will is no longer the Will of God, but is utterly perverse and distorted, averse from all Good, from all which God loves, and prone to all Evil, to every Abomination which God hateth. Thy Affections are alienated from God, and scattered abroad over all the Earth. All thy Passions, both thy Desires and Aversions, thy Joys and Sorrows, thy Hopes and Fears, are out of Frame, are either undue in their Degree, or placed on undue Objects. So that there is no Soundness in thy Soul; but <HI>from the Crown of the
<PB N="142" REF="028060_0134_0FD68B148DE46580"/>Head to the Sole of the Foot</HI> (to use the strong Ex∣pression of the Prophet) there are only <HI>Wounds and Bruises and putrifying Sores.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Such is the inbred Corruption of thy Heart, of thy very inmost Nature. And what Manner of Branches canst thou expect to grow, from such an evil Root? Hence springs Unbelief, ever depart∣ing from the living God: Saying, "Who is the Lord that I should serve him? Tush! Thou, God, carest not for it." Hence Independence, affecting to be like the Most High; hence Pride, in all its Forms, teaching thee to say, "I am rich, and increased in Goods, and have need of nothing." From this evil Fountain flow forth the bitter streams of Vanity, Thirst of Praise; Ambition, Covetousness; the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye, and the Pride of Life. From this arise Anger, Hatred, Malice, Revenge, Envy, Jealousy, evil Surmisings: From this all the fool∣ish and hurtful Lusts, that now <HI>pierce thee through with many Sorrows,</HI> and if not timely prevented, will at length <HI>drown thy Soul in everlasting Perdi∣tion.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. And what Fruits can grow on such Branches as these? Only such as are bitter and evil conti∣nually. Of Pride cometh Contention, vain boast∣ing, seeking and receiving Praise of Men, and so robbing God of that Glory which he cannot give unto another. Of the Lust of the Flesh come Gluttony or Drunkenness, Luxury or Sen∣suality: Fornication, Uncleanness, variously de∣filing that Body, which was designed for a Temple of the Holy Ghost: Of Unbelief, every evil Word and Work. But the Time would fail, should'st thou reckon up all; all the idle Words
<PB N="143" REF="028060_0135_0FD68B182F857B48"/>thou hast spoken, provoking the Most High, grieving the holy One of <HI>Israel:</HI> All the evil Works thou hast done, either wholly evil in them∣selves, or at least, not done to the Glory of God. For thy actual Sins are more than thou art able to express, more than the Hairs of thy Head. Who can number the Sands of the Sea, or the Drops of Rain, or thy Iniquities?</P>
<P N="4">4. And knowest thou not that <HI>the Wages of Sin is Death?</HI> Death not only temporal, but eternal. <HI>The Soul that sinneth, it shall die:</HI> For the Mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. It shall die the second Death. This is the Sentence, to <HI>be punished</HI> with never-ending Death, <HI>with ever∣lasting Destruction from the Presence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power.</HI> Knowest thou not that every Sinner, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; not properly <HI>is in Danger of Hell-Fire,</HI> that Ex∣pression is far too weak: But rather, <HI>is under the Sentence of Hell Fire,</HI> doom'd already, just drag∣ging to Execution. Thou art guilty of everlast∣ing Death. It is the just Reward of thy Inward and Outward Wickedness. It is just, that the Sentence should now take place. Dost thou see, dost thou feel this? Art thou thoroughly convinced, that thou deservest God's Wrath and everlasting Damnation? Would God do thee no wrong, if he now commanded the Earth to open and swal∣low thee up? If thou wert now to go down quick into the Pit, into the Fire that never shall be quenched? If God hath given thee truly to repent, thou hast a deep Sense that these Things are so; and that it is of his mere Mercy thou art not consumed, swept away from the Face of the Earth.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="144" REF="028060_0136_0FD68B1C63615F80"/>
5. And what wilt thou do to appease the Wrath of God, to atone for all thy Sins, and to escape the Punishment thou hast so justly deserved? Alas, thou canst do nothing: Nothing that will in any wise make amends to God, for one evil Work, or Word, or Thought. If thou couldst now do all Things well, if from this very Hour, till thy Soul should return to God, thou couldest perform perfect uninterrupted Obedience, even this would not atone for what is past. The not increasing thy Debt would not discharge it. It would still remain as great as ever. Yea, the present and fu∣ture Obedience of all the Men upon Earth, and all the Angels in Heaven, would never make Sa∣tisfaction to the Justice of God for one single Sin. How vain then was the Thought, of aton∣ing for thy own Sins by any Thing thou could'st do? It costeth far more to redeem one Soul, than all Mankind is able to pay. So that were there no other Help for a guilty Sinner, without Doubt he must have perished everlastingly.</P>
<P N="6">6. But suppose perfect Obedience for the time to come, could atone for the Sins that are past, this would profit thee nothing; for thou art not able to perform it; no, not in any one Point. Begin now. Make the Trial. Shake off that outward Sin that so easily besetteth thee. Thou canst not. How then wilt thou change thy Life from all Evil to all Good? Indeed, it is impos∣sible to be done, unless first thy Heart be changed. For so long as the Tree remains evil, it cannot bring forth good Fruit. But art thou able to change thy own Heart, from all Sin to all Holi∣ness? To quicken a Soul that is dead in Sin? Dead to God and alive only to the World? No more
<PB N="145" REF="028060_0137_0FD68B1DDEB9EFB0"/>than thou art able to quicken a dead Body, to raise to Life him that lieth in the Grave. Yea, thou art not able to quicken thy Soul in any De∣gree, no more than to give any Degree of Life to the dead Body. Thou canst do nothing more or less, in this Matter; thou art utterly without Strength. To be deeply sensible of this, how helpless thou art, as well as how guilty and how sinful, this is that <HI>Repentance not to be repented of,</HI> which is the Fore-runner of the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P N="7">7. If to this lively Conviction of thy inward and outward Sins, of thy utter Guiltiness and Helplessness, there be added suitable Affections, Sorrow of Heart, for having despised thy own Mercies, Remorse and Self-condemnation, having the Mouth stop'd, ashamed to lift up thine Eyes to Heaven; Fear of the Wrath of God abiding on thee, of his Curse hanging over thy Head, and of the fiery Indignation ready to devour those who forget God, and obey not our Lord Jesus Christ: Earnest Desire to escape from that Indignation, to cease from evil and learn to do well: Then I say unto thee in the Name of the Lord, <HI>Thou art not far from the Kingdom of GOD.</HI> One Step more and thou shalt enter in. Thou dost <HI>repent.</HI> Now, <HI>Believe the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>The Gospel</HI> (that is, good Tidings, good News for guilty, helpless Sinners) in the largest Sense of the Word, means, the whole Revela∣tion made to Men by Jesus Christ: And some∣times the whole Account of what our Lord did and suffered, while he tabernacled among Men. The Substance of all is, <HI>Jesus Christ came into the World to save Sinners.</HI> Or, <HI>GOD so loved the
<PB N="146" REF="028060_0138_0FD68B1FC3904310"/>World, that he gave his only begotten Son, to the End we might not perish, but have everlasting Life.</HI> Or, <HI>he was bruised for our Transgressions, he was wounded for our Iniquities: The Chastisement of our Peace was upon Him, and with his Stripes we are healed.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Believe this and the Kingdom of God is thine. By Faith thou attainest the Promise. "He pardoneth and absolveth all that truly repent and unfeignedly believe his holy Gospel." As soon as ever God hath spoken to thy Heart, "Be of good Chear, thy Sins are forgiven thee," his Kingdom com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; thou hast Righteousness and Peace, and Joy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Holy Ghost.</P>
<P N="10">10. Only beware thou do not deceive thy own Soul, with regard to the Nature of this Faith. It is not (as some have fondly conceived) a bare Assent to the Truth of the Bible, of the Articles of our Creed, or of all that is contained in the Old and New Testament. The Devils believe this, as well as I or thou? and yet they are Devils still. But it is, over and above this, a sure Trust in the Mercy of God through Christ Jesus. It is a Confidence in a pardoning God. It is a Divine Evidence or Conviction, that <HI>GOD was in Christ reconciling the World to himself, not imputing to them their former Trespasses:</HI> And in particular, that the Son of God hath loved <HI>me</HI> and given him∣self for me: and that I, even I, am now recon∣ciled to God by the Blood of the Cross.</P>
<P N="11">11. Dost thou thus believe? Then the Peace of God is in thy Heart, and Sorrow and Sighing flee away. Thou art no longer in doubt for the Love of God: It is clear as the Noon-day Sun. Thou cryest out, <HI>My Song shall be always of the
<PB N="147" REF="028060_0139_0FD68B210B2FD4A0"/>Loving Kindness of the Lord: with my Mouth will Liver to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing of thy Truth, from one Generation to another.</HI> Thou art no longer afraid of Hell, or Death, or him that had once the Power of Death, the Devil: No, nor painfully afraid of God him∣self; only thou hast a tender, filial Fear of offend∣ing him. Dost thou believe? Then thy <HI>Soul doth magnify the Lord, and thy Spirit rejoiceth in</HI> God <HI>thy Saviour.</HI> Thou rejoicest in that thou hast <HI>Redemp∣tion thro' his Blood, ever the forgiveness of Sins.</HI> Thou rejoicest in that <HI>Spirit of Adoption, which crieth in thy Heart, Abba, Father!</HI> Thou rejoicest in a <HI>Hope full of Immortality,</HI> in reaching forth unto the <HI>Mark of the Prize of thy high Calling;</HI> in an Earnest Ex∣pectation of all the good Things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</P>
<P N="12">12. Dost thou now believe? Then <HI>the Love of</HI> God is now <HI>shed abroad in thy Heart.</HI> Thou lovest him, because he first loved us. And be∣cause thou lovest God, thou lovest thy Brother also. And being filled with <HI>Love, Peace, Joy,</HI> thou art also filled with <HI>Long suffering, Gentleness, Fidelity, Goodness, Meekness, Temperance,</HI> and all the other Fruits of the same Spirit: in a Word, with whatever Dispositions are holy, are heavenly, or divine. For while thou <HI>beholdest with open</HI> un∣cover'd <HI>Face,</HI> (the Veil now being taken away) <HI>the Glory of the Lord,</HI> his glorious Love, and glorious Image wherein thou wast created, <HI>thou art changed into the same Image, from Glory to Glory, by the Spi∣rit of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. This Repentance, this Faith, this Peace, Joy, Love; this Change from Glory to Glory, is what the Wisdom of the World has voted to
<PB N="148" REF="028060_0140_0FD68B22607718A0"/>be Madoess, mere Enthusiasm, utter Distraction, But thou, O Man of God, regard them not: Be thou moved by none of these Things. Thou knowest in whom thou hast believed. See that no Man take thy Crown. Whereunto thou hast already attained hold fast; and follow, till thou attain all the great and precious Promises. And thou who hast not yet known him, let not vain men make thee ashamed of the Gospel of Christ. Be thou in nothing terrified by those who speak evil of the Things which they know not. God will soon turn thy Heaviness into Joy. O let not thy Hands hang down. Yet a little longer, and he will take away thy Fears, and give thee the Spirit of a sound Mind. <HI>He is nigh that justifieth: Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died; yea rather that rose again; who is even now on the Right hand of God, making Intercession for thee.</HI> Now cast thyself on the Lamb of God, with all thy Sins, how many soever they be; and <HI>an Entrance shall</HI> now <HI>be ministred unto</HI> thee, <HI>into the Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ROM. viii. 1.</HI></BIBL>
<P>There is therefore now no Condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. BY <HI>them which are in Christ Jesus,</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> evidently means, Those who tru∣ly believe in him: Those who <HI>being justified by Faith, have Peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> They who thus believe do no longer <HI>walk after the Flesh,</HI> no longer follow the Motions of corrupt Nature: But <HI>after the Spirit:</HI> Both their Thoughts, Words and Works, are under the Direction of the blessed Spirit of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There is therefore now no Condemnation to</HI> these. There is no Condemnation to them from God: For he hath <HI>justified</HI> them <HI>freely by his Grace, thro' the Redemption that is in Jesus.</HI> He hath forgiven all their iniquities, and blotted out all their Sins. And there is no Condemnation to them from within: For they <HI>have received, not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of</HI> God, <HI>that they might know the Things which are freely given to them of</HI> God:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Which Spirit beareth Witness with their Spirits, that they are the Children of</HI> God. And to this is added,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. i. 12.</NOTE> <HI>the Testimony of</HI> their <HI>Conscience: that in Simpli∣city
<PB N="152" REF="028060_0143_0FD68B3161FF8590"/>and godly Sincerity, not with fleshly Wisdom, but by the Grace of</HI> God, they <HI>have had</HI> their <HI>Conver∣sation in the World.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. But because this Scripture has been so fre∣quently misunderstood, and that in so dangerous a Manner, because such Multitudes of <HI>unlearned and unstable Men,</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Men un∣taught of God, and consequently unestablished in <HI>the truth which is after Godliness</HI>) have <HI>wrested</HI> it <HI>to their own Destruction.</HI> I propose to shew as clear∣ly as I can, First. Who those are <HI>which are in Christ Jesus, and walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit;</HI> and Secondly, How <HI>there is no Condemna∣tion to</HI> these. I shall conclude with some practical Inferences.</P>
<P N="1">I. 1. First I am to shew, Who those are that <HI>are in Christ Jesus.</HI> And are they not, Those who believe in his Name? Those who are <HI>found in him, not having</HI> their <HI>own Righteousness, but the Righteousness which is of</HI> God <HI>by Faith?</HI> These, who <HI>have Redemption through his Blood,</HI> are properly said, to be <HI>in Him.</HI> For <HI>they dwell in Christ and Christ in them.</HI> They are <HI>joined unto the Lord in one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pirit.</HI> They are ingrafted in∣to him as Branches into the Vine. They are unit∣ed, as Members to their Head, in a manner which words cannot express, nor could it before enter in∣to their Hearts to conceive.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now <HI>whosoever abideth in him, sinneth not: walketh not after the Flesh.</HI> The Flesh, in the usual Language of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> signifies corrupt Na∣ture. In this Sense, he uses the Word, writing to the <HI>Galatians. The Works of the Flesh are ma∣nifest,</HI> Gal. v. 19. And a little before, <HI>Walk in
<PB N="153" REF="028060_0144_0FD68B3167C36D98"/>the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the Lust</HI> (or De∣sire) <HI>of the Flesh</HI> (<HI>v.</HI> 16.) To prove which, namely, that those who <HI>walk by the Spirit, do not fulfil the Lust of the Flesh,</HI> he immediately adds, <HI>For the Flesh lusteth against the Spirit; but the Spirit lusteth against the Flesh (for these are contrary to each other) that ye may not do the Things which ye would.</HI> So the words are literally trans∣lated, (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) Not, <HI>So that ye cannot do the Things that ye would,</HI> as if the Flesh overcame the Spirit: A Translation which hath not only nothing to do with the Original Text of the Apostle, but likewise makes his whole Argument nothing worth, yea, asserts just the Reverse of what he is proving.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They who are of Christ,</HI> who <HI>abide in him, have crucified the Flesh with its Affections and Lusts.</HI> They abstain from all those Works of the Flesh: from <HI>Adultery and Fornication,</HI> from <HI>Uncleanness and Lasciviousness;</HI> from <HI>Idolatry, Witchcraft, Hatred, Variance;</HI> from <HI>Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Sedition, Heresies, Envyings, Murders, Drunken∣ness, Revellings:</HI> From every Design, and Word and Work, to which the Corruption of Nature leads. Altho' they feel the Root of Bitterness in themselves, yet are they endued with Power from on High, to trample it continually under Foot, so that it cannot <HI>spring up to trouble them:</HI> Inso∣much that every fresh Assault which they undergo, only gives them fresh Occasion of Praise, of cry∣ing out, <HI>Thanks be unto</HI> God, <HI>who giveth us the Victory, thro' Jesus Christ our Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. They now <HI>walk after the Spirit,</HI> both in their Hearts and Lives. They are taught of Him to love God and their Neighbour with a Love
<PB N="154" REF="028060_0145_0FD68B32DA765A60"/>which is <Q>as a Well of Water, springing up into everlasting Life.</Q> And by him they are led into every holy Desire, into every divine and heavenly Temper, till every Thought which arises in their Heart is Holiness unto the Lord.</P>
<P N="5">5. They who 'walk after the Spirit,' are also led by him, into all Holiness of Conversation. Their Speech is <Q>always in Grace, seasoned with Salt,</Q> with the Love and Fear of God. <Q>No cor∣rupt Communication comes out of their Mouth, but</Q> only 'that which is good;' that which is <Q>to the Use of edifying,</Q> which is <Q>meet to minister Grace to the Hearers.</Q> And herein likewise do they exercise themselves Day and Night, to do on∣ly the Things which please God: in all their out∣ward Behaviour to follow Him, <Q>who left us an Example that we might tread in his Steps:</Q> In all their intercourse with their Neighbour to walk in Justice, Mercy and Truth; and <Q>whatsoever they do,</Q> in every Circumstance of Life, to <Q>do all to the Glory of God.</Q></P>
<P N="6">6. These are they who indeed <Q>walk by the Spi∣rit.</Q> Being filled with Faith and with the Holy Ghost, they possess in their Hearts, and shew forth in their Lives, in the whole Course of their Words and Actions, the genuine Fruits of the Spirit of God, namely, <Q>Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Fidelity, Meek∣ness, Temperance,</Q> and whatsoever else is lovely or praise-worthy. They <Q>adorn in all Things the Gospel of God our Saviour;</Q> and give full Proof to all Mankind, they are indeed actuated by the same Spirit, <Q>which raised up Jesus from the Dead.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="155" REF="028060_0146_0FD68B34F66AF050"/>
II. 1. I proposed to shew, in the second Place, How <HI>there is no Condemnation to them, which are</HI> thus <HI>in Christ Jesus,</HI> and thus <HI>walk, not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>And, first, To Believers in Christ, walking thus, <HI>there is no Condemnation</HI> on Account of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> past Sins. God condemneth them not for any of these: They are as tho' they had never been. They are <HI>cast as a Stone into the Depth of the Sea,</HI> and he remembereth them no more. God hav∣ing <HI>set forth his Son to be a Propitiation for them, thro' Faith in his Blood, hath declared</HI> unto them, <HI>his Righteousness, for the Remission of the Sins that are past.</HI> He layeth therefore none of these to their Charge; their Memorial is perished with them.</P>
<P N="2">2. And there is no Condemnation in their own Breast; no Sense of Guilt, or Dread of the Wrath of God. They <HI>have the Witness in them∣selves;</HI> they are conscious of their Interest in the Blood of Sprinkling. <HI>They have not received a∣gain the Spirit of Bondage unto Pear,</HI> unto Doubt and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acking Uncertainty; but they <HI>have receiv∣ed the Spirit of Adoption, crying in their Hearts, Abba, Father.</HI> Thus being <HI>justified by Faith, they have</HI> the <HI>Peace</HI> of God ruling in their Hearts: Flowing from a continual Sense of his Pardoning Mercy, and <HI>the Answer of a good Conscience toward</HI> God.</P>
<P N="3">3. If it be said, But sometimes a Believer in Christ, may lose his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight of the Mercy of God; sometimes such Darkness may s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll upon him, that he no longer sees him that is invisible, no longer feels that Witness in himself of his Part in the atoning Blood; and then he is inwardly con∣demned
<PB N="156" REF="028060_0147_0FD68B36978BA238"/>he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h again <HI>the Sentence of Death in himself:</HI> I answer, supposing it so to be, sup∣posing him no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to see the Mercy of God, then he is not a Believer; for Faith implies Light; the Light of God shining upon the Soul. So far therefore as any one loses this Light, he for the Time loses his Faith. And no doubt a true Be∣liever in Christ, may lose the Light of Faith. And so far as this is lost, he may for a Time fall again into Condemnation. But this is not the Case of them who now <HI>are in Christ Jesus,</HI> who now believe in his Name. For so long as they believe and walk after the Spirit, neither God condemns them nor their own Heart.</P>
<P N="5">5. They are not condemned, Secondly, for any Present Sins, for now transgressing the Com∣mandments of God. For they do not transgress them; they do not <HI>walk after the Flesh but after the Spirit.</HI> This is the continual Proof of their <HI>Love of</HI> God, <HI>that they keep his Commandments:</HI> Even as St. <HI>John</HI> bears witness, <HI>Whosoever is born of</HI> God <HI>doth not com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it Sin. For his Seed re∣maineth in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of</HI> God: He cannot, so long as that Seed of God, that loving, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Faith re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>eth in him. So long as <HI>he keepeth himself</HI> herein <HI>that wicked one toucheth him not.</HI> Now it is evident, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is not condemned for the Sins which he doth not commit at all. They therefore who are thus <HI>had by the Spirit, are not under the Law,</HI> (<HI>Gal.</HI> v. 18.) Not under the Curse or Condemnation of it; for it condemns none but those who break it. Thus, that Law of God, <HI>Thou shalt not sheal,</HI> condemns none but these who do steal. Thus, <HI>Remember the Sallath day to keep it holy,</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="028060_0148_0FD68B3E150DC928"/>condemns those only who do not keep it holy. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ainst</HI> the Fruits of the Spirit, <HI>there is no Law;</HI> (<HI>v.</HI> 23.) As the Apostle more largely de∣clares, in those memorable Words of his former Epistle to <HI>Timothy. We know, that the Law is good, if a Man use it lawfully; Knowing this</HI> (if while he uses the Law of God, in order either to convince or direct, he knows and remembers this) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. (Not that the Law is not made for a righteous Man; but) <HI>That the Law does not lie against a righteous Man:</HI> (It has no Force against him, no Power to condemn him) <HI>but against the Lawless and Disobedient, against the Ungodly and Sinners, against the Unholy and Profane—according to the glorious Gospel of the blessed</HI> God. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> i. 8, 9, 11.</P>
<P N="6">6. They are not condemned Thirdly, for In∣ward Sin, even tho' it does now remain. That the Corruption of Nature does still remain, even in those who are the Children of God by Faith, that they have in them the Seeds of Pride and Vanity, of Anger, Lust and evil Desire, yea, Sin of every Kind, is too plain to be denied, being Matter of daily Experience. And on this Ac∣count it is, That St. <HI>Paul</HI> speaking to those, whom he had just before witnessed to be<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i. 2.</NOTE> <HI>in Christ Jesus</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ver. 9.</NOTE>, to have been <HI>called of</HI> God <HI>into the Fel∣lowship</HI> (or Participation) <HI>of his Son Jesus Christ,</HI> yet declares, <HI>Brethren, I could not speak unto you as unto Spiritual; but as unto Carnal; even as unto Babes in Christ</HI> (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> iii. 1.) <HI>Babes in Christ</HI>— So we see they were <HI>in Christ;</HI> they were Be∣lievers in a low Degree. And yet how much of
<PB N="158" REF="028060_0149_0FD68B3FF18CB910"/>Sin remained in them? Of that <HI>carnal Mind,</HI> which <HI>is not subject to the Law of</HI> God!</P>
<P N="7">7. And yet, for all this, they are not con∣demned. Altho' they seel the Flesh, the evil Nature in them, altho' they are more sensible Day by Day, that their <HI>Heart is deceitful and despe∣rately wicked:</HI> Yet so long as they do not yield thereto, so long as they give no Place to the De∣vil, so long as they maintain a continual War, with all Sin, with Pride, Anger, Desire, so that the Flesh hath not Dominion over them, but they still <HI>walk after the Spirit:</HI> There is <HI>no Condemna∣tion to them which are in Christ Jesus.</HI> God is well-pleased with their sincere, tho' imperfect Obedience: And they <HI>have Confidence toward</HI> God, knowing <HI>they are his, by the Spirit which he hath given them.</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 24.</P>
<P N="8">8. Nay, Fourthly, altho' they are continually convinced of Sin cleaving to all they do; altho' they are conscious of not fulfilling the Perfect Law, either in their Thoughts, or Words, or Works; altho' they know they do not love the Lord their God, with all their Heart, and Mind, and Soul and Strength; altho' they seel more or less of Pride or Self will, stealing in and mixing with their best Duties; altho' even in their more immediate Intercourse with God, when they as∣semble themselves with the great Congregation, and when they pour out their Souls in secret to him, who seeth all the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart, they are continually ashamed of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ering Thoughts, or of the Deadness and Dul∣ness of their Affections: Yet there is no Con∣demnation to them still, either from God or from their own Heart. The Consideration of these manifold Defects only gives them a deeper
<PB N="159" REF="028060_0150_0FD68B4665D0E880"/>Sense, That they have always need of that Blood of Sprinkling, which speaks for them in the Ears of God, and that Advocate with the Father <HI>who ever liveth, to make Int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ssion for them.</HI> So far are these from driving them away from him, in whom they have believed, that they rather drive them the closer to him, whom they feel the Want of every Moment. And at the same Time, the deeper Sense they have of this Want, the more earnest Desire do they feel, and the more diligent they are, as they <HI>have received the Lord Jesus, so</HI> to <HI>walk in Him.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. They are not condemned, Fifthly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Sins of Infirmity,</HI> as they are usually called. (Perhaps it were adviseable rather to call them <HI>Infirmities,</HI> that we may not seem to give any Countenance to Sin, or to extenuate it in any Degree, by thus coupling it with Infirmity. But if we must re∣tain so ambiguous and dangerous an Expression) by <HI>Sins of Infirmity</HI> I would mean, such involun∣tary Failings, as the saying a Thing we believe True, tho' in Fact it prove to be False; or the Hurting our Neighbour, without knowing or de∣signing it; perhaps when we designed to do him Good. Tho' these are Deviations from the holy and acceptable and perfect will of God, yet they are not properly Sins, nor do they bring any Guilt on the Conscience of <HI>them which are in Christ Jesus.</HI> They separate not between God and them, neither intercept the Light of his Countenance; as being no Ways inconsistent with their general Character, of <HI>walking not after the Flesh but after the Spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. Lastly, <HI>There is no Condemnation</HI> to them for any Thing whatever, which it is not in their Power to help; whether it be of an inward or
<PB N="160" REF="028060_0151_0FD68B490923A150"/>outward Nature, and whether it be doing some∣thing, or leaving something undone. For In∣stance: The Lord's Supper is to be administered. But you do not partake thereof. Why do you not? You are consined by Sickness. Therefore you cannot help omitting it: And for the same Reason, you are not condemned. There is no Guilt; because there is no Choice. As there <HI>is a willing Mind, it is accepted, according to that a Man hath, not according to that he hath not.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. A Believer indeed may sometimes be <HI>griev∣ed,</HI> because he cannot do what his Soul longs for. He may cry out, when he is detained from wor∣shipping God in the great Congregation, <HI>Like as the Hart panteth after the Water brooks, so pant∣eth my Soul after thee, O</HI> God. <HI>My Soul is a∣thirst for</HI> God, <HI>yea even for the living</HI> God: <HI>when shall I come to appear in the Presence of</HI> God? He may earnestly desire (only still saying in his Heart, Not as I will, but as thou wilt) to <HI>go again with the Multitude and bring them forth into the House of</HI> God. But still, if he cannot go, he feels no Condemnation, no Guilt, no Sense of God's Displeasure: But can chearfully yield up those Desires, with <HI>O my Soul, put thy Trust in</HI> God: <HI>For I will yet give him Thanks, who is the Help of my Countenance and my</HI> God.</P>
<P N="12">12. It is more difficult to determine concerning those which are usually stiled, <HI>Sins of Surprize<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> As when one who commonly in Patience pos∣sesses his Soul, on a Sudden and violent Temp∣tation, speaks or acts in a manner not consistent with the Roval Law. <HI>Thou shalt love thy Neigh∣hour as thyself.</HI> Perhaps it is not easy to fix a General Rule, concerning Transgressions of this Nature. We cannot say, either that Men are,
<PB N="161" REF="028060_0152_0FD68B4B99A03228"/>or that they are not condemned, for Sins of Sur∣prize in general. But it seems whenever a Be∣liever is by Surprize over-taken in a Fault, there is more or less Condemnation, as there is more or less Concurrence of his Will. In Proportion as a sinful Desire or Word or Action is more or less voluntary, so we may conceive, God is more or less displeased, and there is more or less Guilt upon the Soul.</P>
<P N="13">13. But if so, then there may be some Sins of Surprize, which bring much Guilt and Condem∣nation. For in some Instances, our being sur∣prized is owing to some wilful and culpable Neg∣lect; or to a Sleepiness of Soul which might have been prevented, or shaken off before the Temp∣tation came. A Man may be previously warned either of God or Man, That Trials and Danger are at hand: And yet may say in his Heart, <HI>A little more Slumber, a little more Folding of the Hands to Rest.</HI> Now if such an one afterwards fall tho' unawares, into the Snare which he might have avoided; that he fell unawares is no Ex∣cuse: He might have foreseen, and have shunned the Danger. The falling even by Surprize, in such an Instance as this, is, in effect, a wilful Sin; and as such must expose the Sinner to Con∣demnation, both from God and his own Consci∣ence.</P>
<P N="14">14. On the other Hand, there may be sudden Assaults, either from the World, or the God of this World, and frequently from our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> evil Hearts, which we did not, and hardly could fore∣see. And by these even a Believer, while weak in Faith, may possibly be borne down, suppost into a Degree of Anger, or thinking evil of an∣other,
<PB N="162" REF="028060_0153_0FD68B4B9DADE298"/>with scarce any Concurrence of his Will. Now in such a Case, the Jealous God would un∣doubtedly shew him that he had done foolishly. He would be convinced of having swerved from the Perfect Law, from the Mind which was in Christ, and consequently <HI>grieved</HI> with a godly Sorrow, and lovingly <HI>ashamed</HI> before God. Yet need he not come into condemnation. God lay∣eth not Folly to his Charge, but hath Compassion upon him, <HI>even as a Father pitieth his own Chil∣dren.</HI> And his Heart Condemneth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not; in the midst of that Sorrow and Shame, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> still say, <HI>I will trust and not be afraid. For the Lord Jehovah is my Strength and my Song; he is also become my Salvation.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. 1. It remains only, to draw some practi∣cal Inferences from the preceeding Considerations.</P>
<P>And, first, If there be <HI>no Condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, and walk not after the Flesh but after the Spirit,</HI> on account of their past Sin: Then why art thou fearful, O thou of little Faith? Tho' thy Sins were once more in Num∣ber than the Sand, what is that to thee now thou art in Christ Jesus? <HI>Who shall lay any thing to the Charge of</HI> God's <HI>Elect? It is God that jus∣tifieth: Who is he that condemneth?</HI> All the Sins thou hast committed from thy Youth up, until the Hour when thou wast <HI>accepted in the Beloved,</HI> are dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>en away as Chaff, are gone, are lost, swallowed up, remembered no more. Thou art now <HI>born of the Spirit:</HI> Wilt thou be troubled or afraid of what was done before thou wert horn? Away with thy Fears! Thou art not called to Fear; but to the <HI>Spirit of Love and of a sound
<PB N="163" REF="028060_0154_0FD68B4D1989C010"/>Mind.</HI> Know thy Calling. Rejoice in God thy Saviour, and give Thanks to God thy Father through him.</P>
<P N="2">2. Wilt thou say, "But I have again com∣mitted Sin, since I had Redemption through his Blood? And therefore it is, that <HI>I abhor myself, and repent in Dust and Ashes.</HI>" It is meet thou shouldst abhor thyself; and it is God who hath wrought thee to this self-same Thing. But dost thou now believe? Hath he again enabled thee to say, <HI>I know that my Redeemer liveth: And the Life which I now live, I live by Faith in the Son of</HI> God? Then that Faith again cancels all that is past, and there is no Condemnation to thee. At whatsoever Time thou truly believest in the Name of the Son of God, all thy Sins antecedent to that Hour, vanish away as the Morning Dew. Now then, <HI>Stand thou fast in the Liberty where∣with Christ hath made thee free.</HI> He hath once more made thee free from the Power of Sin, as well as from the Guilt and Punishment of it. <HI>O be not intangled again with the Yoke of Bondage!</HI> Neither the vile devilish Bondage of Sin; of evil Desires, evil Tempers, or Words or Works, the most grievous Yoke on this Side Hell; Nor the Bondage of slavish tormenting Fear, of Guilt and Self-condemnation.</P>
<P N="3">3. But, Secondly: Do all they which abide <HI>in Christ Jesus, walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit?</HI> Then we cannot but infer, that who∣soever now committeth Sin, hath no Part or Lot in this Matter. He is even now condemned by his own Heart. But <HI>if our Heart condemn us,</HI> if our own Conscience beareth Witness that we are guilty, undoubtedly God doth: For <HI>he is greater
<PB N="164" REF="028060_0155_0FD68B503B85C330"/>than our Heart, and knoweth all Things;</HI> so that we cannot doceive him, if we can ourselves. And think not to say, "I was justified once; my Sins were once forgiven me." I know not that: Neither will I dispute whether they were or no. Perhaps, at this Distance of Time, 'tis next to impossible to know with any tolerable Degree of Certainty, whether that was a true, genuine Work of God, or whether thou didst only de∣ceive thy own Soul. But this I know with the utmost Degree of Certainty, <HI>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil.</HI> Therefore thou art of thy Father the Devil. It cannot be denied: For the Works of thy Father thou dost. O flatter not thyself with vain Hopes. Say not to thy Soul, Peace, Peace! For there is no Peace. Cry a∣loud! Cry unto God out of the Deep; if haply he may hear thy Voice. Come unto him as at first, as wretched and poor, as sinful, miserable, blind and naked. And beware thou suffer thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ul to take no Rest, till his pardoning Love be again revealed, till he <HI>heal thy Backslidings,</HI> and fill thee again with the <HI>Faith that worketh by Love.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Thirdly, Is there no Condemnation to them which <HI>walk after the Spirit,</HI> by reason of <HI>inward Sin</HI> still remaining, so long as they do not give Way thereto; nor by reason of <HI>Sin cleaving</HI> to all they do? Then fret not thyself because of Un∣godliness, tho' it still remain in thy Heart. Re∣pine not, because thou still comest short of the glorious Image of God: Nor yet, because Pride, Self-will, or Unbelief, cleave to all thy Words and Works. And be not afraid to know all this Evil of thy Heart, to know thyself as also thou art known. Yea, desire of God, that thou mayst
<PB N="165" REF="028060_0156_0FD68B5385194470"/>not think of thyself more highly than thou ought∣est to think. Let thy continual Prayer be,
<Q><L>"Shew me, as my Soul can bear,</L>
<L>The Depth of inbred Sin:</L>
<L>All the Unbelief declare,</L>
<L>The Pride that lurks within!"</L></Q>
But when he heareth thy Prayer, and unveils thy Heart, when he shews thee thoroughly what Spirit thou art of: Then beware that thy Faith fail thee not, that thou suffer not thy Shield to be torn from thee. Be abased. Be humbled in the Dust. See thyself nothing, less than Nothing and Vani∣ty. But still, <HI>let not</HI> thy <HI>Heart be troubled, nei∣ther let it be afraid.</HI> Still hold fast. "<HI>I,</HI> even I, <HI>have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Rightecus.</HI> And as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, so is his Love higher than even my Sins."—Therefore God is merciful to thee a Sinner! Such a Sinner as thou art! God is Love; and Christ hath died. Therefore the Fa∣ther himself loveth thee. Thou art his Child. Therefore he will with-hold from thee no man∣ner of thing that is good. Is it good, that the whole Body of Sin, which is now crucified in thee, should be destroyed? It shall be done. Thou shalt be <HI>cleansed from all Filthiness both of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sh and Spirit.</HI> It it good, that nothing should re∣main in thy Heart, but the pure Love of God alone? Be of good Chear! <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy</HI> God, <HI>with all thy Heart and Mind and Soul and Strength. Faithful is he that hath pro∣mised, who also will do it.</HI> It is thy Part, pati∣ently to continue in the Work of Faith, and in
<PB N="166" REF="028060_0157_0FD68B5498EF6C40"/>the Labour of Love: And in cheerful Peace, in humble Confidence, with calm and resigned, and yet earnest Expectation, to wait till <HI>the Zeal of the Lord of Hosts shall perform this.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Fourth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, If they that <HI>are in Christ, and walk after the Spirit,</HI> are not condemned for <HI>Sins of Infirmity,</HI> as neither for <HI>involuntary Failings,</HI> nor for any Thing whatever which they are not able to help: Then beware, O thou that hast Faith in his Blood, that Satan herein <HI>gain no Ad∣vantage over thee.</HI> Thou art still foolish and weak, blind and ignorant. More weak than any Words can express, more foolish than it can yet enter in∣to thy Heart to conceive, knowing nothing yet as thou oughtest to know. Yet let not all thy Weakness and Folly, or any Fruit thereof, which thou art not yet able to avoid, shake thy Faith, thy filial Trust in God, or disturb thy Peace or Joy in the Lord. The Rule which some give as to wilful Sins, and which in that Case, may per∣haps be dangerous, is undoubtedly wise and safe, if it be applied only to the Case of Weakness and Infirmities. Art thou fallen, O Man of God? Yet do not lie there, fretting thyself and bemoan∣ing thy Weakness: But meekly say, Lord, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall fall thus every Moment, unless thou uphold me with thy Hand. And then arise! Leap and Walk. Go on thy Way. <HI>Run with Patience the Race set before thee..</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Lastly, Since a Believer need not come into Condemnation, even tho' he be <HI>surprized</HI> into what his Soul abhors, (suppose his being surprized is not owing to any Carelessness or wilful Neglect of his own:) If thou who believest, art thus over∣taken in a Fault, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n grieve unto the Lord; it
<PB N="167" REF="028060_0158_0FD68B57B56382D0"/>shall be a precious Balm: Pour out thy Heart be∣fore him, and shew him of thy Trouble. And pray with all thy Might to him who is <HI>touched with the Feeling of</HI> thy <HI>Infirmities,</HI> that he would stablish and strenthen and settle thy Soul, and suffer thee to fall no more. But still he condem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣eth thee not. Wherefore should'st thou fear? Thou hast no Need of any <HI>Fear that hath Torment.</HI> Thou shalt love him that loveth thee, and it suf∣ficeth: More Love will bring more Strength. And as soon as thou lovest him with all thy Heart, thou shalt be <HI>perfect and entire, lacking nothing.</HI> Wait in Peace for that Hour, when <HI>the</HI> God <HI>of Peace</HI> shall <HI>sanctify thee wholly, so that thy whole Spirit, and Soul and Body may be preserved blameless unto the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ!</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Spirit of Bondage and of Adoption. A SERMON On ROMANS viii. 15.</HEAD>
<PB N="171" REF="028060_0160_0FD68B5AAF87D4D8"/>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ROM. viii. 15.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Ye have not received the Spirit of Bondage again unto Fear: But ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. ST. <HI>PAUL</HI> here speaks to those who are the Children of God by Faith, Ye, saith he, who are indeed his Children, have drank into his Spirit. <HI>Ye have not received the Spirit of Bondage again unto Fear.</HI> But <HI>because ye are Sons,</HI> God <HI>hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your Hearts. Ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Spirit of Bondage and Fear is widely distant from this loving Spirit of Adoption. Those who are influenced only by slavish Fear, cannot be termed, The Sons of God. Yet some of them may be styled his Servants, and are <HI>not far from the Kinddom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. But it is to be feared, the Bulk of Man∣kind, yea, of what is called <HI>The Christian World,</HI> have not attain'd even this; but are still afar off, <HI>neither is</HI> God <HI>in all their Thoughts.</HI> A few Names may be found of those who love God: A few more there are that fear him. But the greater Part have neither the Fear of God before their Eyes, nor the Love of God in their Hearts.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="172" REF="028060_0161_0FD68B5F8E6EA420"/>
4. Perhaps most of you, who by the Mercy of God, now partake of a better Spirit, may re∣member the Time, when ye were as they, when ye were under the same Condemnation. But at first ye knew it not, tho' ye were wallowing daily in your Sins and in your Blood: Till in due time ye <HI>received the Spirit of Fear</HI> (<HI>ye received;</HI> for this also is the Gift of God:) And afterwards, Fear vanished away, and the Spirit of Love filled your Hearts.</P>
<P N="5">5. One who is in the first State of Mind, without Fear or Love, is in Scripture termed <HI>a natural Man.</HI> One who is under the Spirit of Bondage and Fear, is sometimes said to be <HI>under the Law:</HI> (Altho' that Expression more frequent∣ly signifies One, who is under the <HI>Jewish</HI> Dis∣pensation, who thinks himself obliged to observe all the Rites and Ceremonies of the <HI>Jewish Law.</HI>) But one who has exchanged the Spirit of Fear for the Spirit of Love, is properly said, To be <HI>under Grace.</HI></P>
<P>Now because it highly imports us, to know what Spirit we are of, I shall endeavour to point out distinctly, First, The State of a <HI>natural Man,</HI> Secondly, That of one who is <HI>under the Law,</HI> and Thirdly, of one who is <HI>under Grace.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. 1. And, First, the State of a <HI>natural Man.</HI> This the Scripture represents as a State of Sleep. The Voice of God to him is, <HI>Awake, thou that sleepest.</HI> For his Soul is in a deep Sleep. His Spi∣ritual Senses are not awake: They discern neither Spiritual Good nor Evil. The Eyes of his Un∣derstanding are closed; they are sealed together, and see not. Clouds and Darkness continually
<PB N="173" REF="028060_0162_0FD68B62E830E8F0"/>rest upon them; for he lies in the Valley of the Shadow of Death. Hence having no Inlets for the Knowledge of Spiritual Things, all the Ave∣nues of his Soul being shut up, he is in gross, stupid Ignorance of whatever he is most con∣cerned to know. He is utterly ignorant of God, knowing nothing concerning him as he ought to know. He is totally a Stranger to the Law of God, as to its True, Inward, Spiritual Mean∣ing. He has no Conception of that Evangelical Holiness, without which no Man shall see the Lord; nor of the Happiness, which they only find, whose <HI>Life is hid with Christ in</HI> God.</P>
<P N="2">2. And for this very Reason, because he is fast <HI>asleep,</HI> he is, in some Sense, at <HI>Rest.</HI> Because he is <HI>blind,</HI> he is also <HI>secure:</HI> He saith, <HI>Tush, there shall no Harm happen unto me.</HI> The Darkness which covers him on every Side, keeps him in a kind of Peace: (So far as Peace can consist with the Works of the Devil, and with an earthly, devilish Mind.) He <HI>sees</HI> not that he stands on the Edge of the Pit; therefore he <HI>fears</HI> it not. He cannot <HI>tremble</HI> at the Danger he does not <HI>know.</HI> He has not understanding enough to fear. Why is it that he is in no Dread of God? Be∣cause he is totally ignorant of him: If not <HI>saying in his Heart, There is no</HI> God, or that he <HI>sitteth on the Circle of the Heavens, and humbleth</HI> not <HI>himself to behold the Things</HI> which are done on Earth: yet satisfying himself as well, to all <HI>Epi∣curean</HI> Intents and Purposes, by saying, "God is Merciful:" Confounding and swallowing up at once, in that unweildly Idea of Mercy, all his Holiness and Essential Hatred of Sin, all his Ju∣stice, Wisdom and Truth. He is in no Dread
<PB N="174" REF="028060_0163_0FD68B645BB2C648"/>of the Vengeance denounced against those who obey not the blessed Law of God, because he understands it not. He imagines the main Point is, To <HI>do thus,</HI> to be <HI>outwardly</HI> blameless: And sees not that it extends to every Temper, Desire, Thought, Motion of the Heart. Or he fancies, that the Obligation hereto is ceased; that Christ came to <HI>destroy the Law and the Prophets;</HI> to save his People, <HI>in,</HI> not <HI>from</HI> their Sins; to bring them to Heaven, without Holiness. Not∣withstanding his own Words, <HI>Not one Jot or Tittle of the Law shall pass away, till all Things are fulfilled:</HI> And, <HI>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord! shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he that doth the Will of my Father which is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. He is secure, because he is utterly ignorant of himself. Hence he talks of "repenting by and by," he does not indeed exactly know when; but some time or other before he dies: Taking it for granted, That this is quite in his own Power. For what should hinder his doing it, if he will? If he does but once set a Resolution, no fear but he will make it good.</P>
<P N="4">4. But this Ignorance never so strongly glares, as in those who are termed, <HI>Men of Learning,</HI> If a Natural Man be one of these, he can talk at large of his Rational Faculties; of the Freedom of his Will, and the absolute Necessity of such Freedom, in order to constitute a Man a Moral Agent. He reads and argues, and proves to a Demonstration, That every Man may do as he will; may dispose his own Heart to Evil or Good, as it seems best in his own Eyes. Thus the God of this World spreads a double Veil of Blindness
<PB N="175" REF="028060_0164_0FD68B65DC2C6318"/>over I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Heart, lest by any Means <HI>the Light of the glorious Gospel of Christ should shine</HI> upon it.</P>
<P N="5">5. From the same Ignorance of himself and God there may sometimes arise in the Natural Man, a kind of <HI>Joy,</HI> in congratulating himself, upon his own Wisdom and Goodness. And what the World calls Joy, he may often possess. He may have Pleasure in various Kinds; either in gratifying the Desires of the Flesh, or the Desire of the Eye, or the Pride of Life: Particularly if he has large Possessions; if he enjoy an affluent Fortune. Then he may <HI>cloath</HI> himself <HI>in Purple and fine Linen, and fare sumptuously every Day.</HI> And <HI>so long as</HI> he thus <HI>doth well unto himself, Men will</HI> doubtless <HI>speak good of</HI> him. They will say, He is a happy Man: For indeed this is the Sum of Wordly Happiness: To dress, and visit, and talk, and eat, and drink, and rise up to play.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is not surprising, if one in such Circum∣stances as these, dozed with the Opiates of Flat∣tery and Sin, should imagine, among his other waking Dreams, That he walks in great <HI>Liberty.</HI> How easily may he persuade himself, that he is at Liberty from all <HI>Vulgar Errors,</HI> and from the <HI>Prejudice</HI> of Education, judging exactly right, and keeping clear of all Extremes. "I am free (may he say) from all the <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> of weak and narrow Souls: From <HI>Superstition,</HI> the Disease of Fools and Cowards, always righteous over much; and from <HI>Bigotry,</HI> continually incident to those who have not a free and generous Way of Think∣ing." And too sure it is, That he is altogether free, from the <HI>Wisdom which cometh from Above,</HI> from Holiness, from the Religion of the Heart, from the whole Mind which was in Christ.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="176" REF="028060_0165_0FD68B68240F27C8"/>
7. For all this Time, he is the Servant of Sin. He commits Sin, more or less Day by Day. Yet he is not troubled: He "is in no Bondage;" (as some speak) he feels no Condemnation. He con∣tents himself, (even tho' he should profess to be∣lieve, that the Christian Revelation is of God?) with, "Man is frail. We are all weak. Every Man has his Infirmity." Perhaps he quotes Scrip∣ture: "Why, does not <HI>Solomon</HI> say, "Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Righteous Man falls into Sin seven Times a Day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. And doubtless, they are all Hypocrites or Enthu∣siasts who pretend to be better than their Neigh∣bours." If at any Time a serious Thought fixes upon him, he stifles it as soon as possible, with, "Why should I fear, since God is merciful, and Christ died for Sinners?" Thus he remains a willing Servant of Sin, content with the Bon∣dage of Corruption; inwardly and outwardly un∣holy, and satisfied therewith; not only not con∣quering Sin, but not striving to conquer, parti∣cularly That Sin, which doth so easily beset him.</P>
<P N="8">8. Such is the State of every <HI>Natural Man;</HI> whether he be a gross, scandalous Transgressor, or a more reputable and decent Sinner, having the Form, tho' not the Power of Godliness. But how can such an one be <HI>convinced of Sin?</HI> How is he brought to <HI>repent?</HI> To be <HI>under the Law?</HI> To receive the <HI>Spirit of Bondage unto Fear?</HI> This is the Point which is next to be considered.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. By some awful Providence, or by his Word applied with the Demonstration of his Spi∣rit, God touches the Heart of him that lay asleep in Darkness and in the Shadow of Death. He is
<PB N="177" REF="028060_0166_0FD68B6829879780"/>terribly shaken out of his Sleep, and awakes into a Consciousness of his Danger. Perhaps in a Mo∣ment, perhaps by Degrees, the Eyes of his Un∣derstanding are opened, and now first (the Veil being in Part removed) discern the real State he is in. Horrid Light breaks in upon his Soul; such Light, as may be conceived to gleam from the bottomless Pit, from the lowest Deep, from a Lake of Fire, burning with Brimstone. He at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sees the Loving, the Merciful God, is also <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>consuming Fire;</HI> that he is a just God and a ter∣rible, rendering to every Man according to his Works, entering into Judgment with the Ungodly for every idle Word, yea, and for the Imagina∣tions of the Heart. He now clearly perceives, that the great and holy God is <HI>of purer Eyes than is behold Iniquity;</HI> that he is an Avenger of every one who rebelleth against him, and repayeth the Wicked to his Face; and that <HI>it is a fearful Thing to fall into the Hands of the living</HI> God.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Inward, Spiritual Meaning of the Law of God now begins to glare upon him. He per∣ceives the <HI>Commandment is exceeding broad,</HI> and <HI>there is nothing hid from the Light thereof.</HI> He is convinced, that every Part of it relates not barely to outward Sin or Obedience, but to what passes in the secret Recesses of the Soul, which no Eye but God's can penetrate. If he now hears, <HI>Thou shalt not kill,</HI> God speaks in Thunder, <HI>He that hateth his Brother is a Murtherer.</HI> He that saith unto his Brother, <HI>Thou Fool, is obnoxious to Hell-Fire.</HI> If the Law say, <HI>Thou shalt not commit Adul∣tery,</HI> the Voice of the Lord sounds in his Ears, <HI>He that looketh on a Woman to lust after her, hath committed Adultery with her already in his
<PB N="178" REF="028060_0167_0FD68B6D0D3178D0"/>Heart.</HI> And thus in every Point, he feels the Word of God, <HI>quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged Sword.</HI> It pierces even <HI>to the divid∣ing asunder of</HI> his <HI>Soul and Spirit,</HI> his <HI>Joints and Marrow.</HI> And so much the more, because he is conscious to <HI>himself</HI> of having neglected so great Salvation; of having <HI>trodden under Foot the Son of</HI> God, who would have saved him from his Sins, and <HI>counted the Blood of the Covenant an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> holy,</HI> a common, unsanctifying, <HI>Thing.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. And as he knows <HI>all Things are naked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> open unto the Eyes of him with whom we have to do,</HI> so he sees himself, naked, stript of all the Fig-leaves which he had sewed together, of all his poor Pretences to Religion or Virtue, and his wretched Excuses for sinning against God. He now sees himself like the ancient Sacrifices, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, cleft in sunder, as it were, from the Neck downward, so that all within him stands confest. His Heart is bare, and he sees it is all Sin, <HI>deceitful above all Things, desperately wicked;</HI> that it is altogether corrupt and abominable, more than it is possible for Tongue to express: that there dwelleth therein no good Thing, but Un∣righteousness and Ungodliness only; every Motion thereof, every Temper and Thought, being only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> continually.</P>
<P N="5">5. And he not only sees, but feels in himself, by an Emotion of Soul which he cannot describe, that for the Sins of his Heart, were his Life with∣out Blame (which yet it is not, and cannot be: seeing <HI>an evil Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit</HI>) he deserves to be cast into <HI>the Fire that never shall be quenched.</HI> He feels, that the <HI>Wages,</HI> the just Reward <HI>of Sin,</HI> of his Sin above all, <HI>is Death;</HI>
<PB N="179" REF="028060_0168_0FD68B708A418CA0"/>even the Second Death, the Death which dieth not, the Destruction of Body and Soul in Hell.</P>
<P N="6">6. Here ends his pleasing Dream, his delusive Rest, his false Peace, his vain Security His Joy now vanishes as a Cloud; Pleasures, once loved, delight no more. They pall upon the Taste; he loaths the nauseous Sweet; he is weary to bear them. The shadows of Happiness flee away, and sink into Oblivion. So that he is stript of all, and wanders to and fro, seeking Rest, but find∣ing none.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Fumes of those Opiates being now dis∣pelled, he feels the Anguish of a wounded Spirit. He finds that Sin let loose upon the Soul (whe∣ther it be Pride, Anger, or Evil Desire, whether Self-will, Malice, Envy, Revenge, or any other) is perfect Misery. He feels Sorrow of Heart for the Blessings he has lost, and the Curse which is come upon him; Remorse sor having thus de∣stroyed himself, and despised his own Mercies; Fear,from a lively Sense of the Wrath of God, and of the Consequences of his Wrath; of the Punishment which he has justly deserved, and which he sees hanging over his Head; Fear of Death, as being to him the Gate of Hell, the Entrance of Death eternal; Fear of the Devil, the Executioner of the Wrath and righteous Ven∣geance of God; Fear of Men, who if they were able to kill his Body, would thereby plunge both Body and Soul into Hell; Fear, sometimes aris∣ing to such a Heighth, that the poor, sinful, guilty Soul, is terrified with every Thing, with Nothing, with Shades, with a Leaf shaken of the Wind. Yea sometimes it may even border upon Distraction, making a Man <HI>drunken, tho' not with Wine,</HI> sus∣pending
<PB N="180" REF="028060_0169_0FD68B7278935E30"/>the Exercise of the Memory, of the Un∣derstanding, of all the Natural Faculties. Some∣times it may approach to the very Brink of De∣spair: So that he who trembles at the Name of Death, may yet be ready to plunge into it every Moment, to <HI>chuse strangling rather than Life.</HI> Well may such a Man <HI>roar,</HI> like him of old, <HI>for the very Disquietness of</HI> his <HI>Heart.</HI> Well may he cry out, <HI>The Spirit of a Man may sustain his In∣firmities; but a wounded Spirit who can bear?</HI></P>
<P N="8">8, Now he truly desires to break loose fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sin, and begins to struggle with it. But tho' h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> strive with all his Might, he cannot conquer: Sin is mightier than he. He would fain escape; but he is so fast in Prison, that he cannot get forth. He resolves against Sin, but yet Sins on: He sees the Snare, and abhors, and runs into it. So much does his boasted Reason avail! Only to i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nce his Guilt, and increase his Misery. Such is the Freedom of his Will! Free only to Evil; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <HI>drink in Iniquity like Water;</HI> to wander farther and farther from the living God, and do more <HI>Despite to the Spirit of Grace!</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. The more he strives, wishes, labours to be free, the more does he feel his Chains, the grie∣vous Chains of Sin, wherewith Satan binds and <HI>leads him Captive at his Will:</HI> His Servant he is, tho' he repine ever so much; tho' he rebel, he cannot prevail. He is still in Bondage and Fear, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reason of Sin: Generally, of some outward Sin, to which he is peculiarly disposed, either by Nature, Custom, or Outward Circumstances; But always, of some inward Sin, some Evil Tem∣per or unholy Affection. And the more he frets against it, the more it prevails; he may bite, but
<PB N="181" REF="028060_0170_0FD68B739B5F5AD0"/>cannot break his Chain. Thus he toils without End, repenting and sinning, and repenting and finning again, till at length the poor sinful, help∣less Wretch is even at his Wit's End, and can barely groan, <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. This whole Struggle of one who is <HI>under the Law,</HI> under the <HI>Spirit of Fear and Bondage,</HI> is beautifully described by the Apostle in the fore∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing Chapter, speaking in the Person of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>akened Man. <HI>I</HI> (saith he) <HI>was alive without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Law once,</HI> ver. 9. I had much Life, Wisdom, Strength and Virtue; so I thought: <HI>But when the Commandment came, Sin revived, and I died.</HI> When the Commandment, in its spiritual Mean∣ing, came to my Heart, with the Power of God, my inbred Sin was stirred up, fretted, inflamed, and all my Virtue died away. <HI>And the Command∣ment, which was ordained to Life, I found to be unto Death, For Sin, taking Occasion by the Com∣mandment, deceived me, and by it slew me,</HI> ver. 10, 11. It came upon me unawares, slew all my Hopes, and plainly shewed, in the midst of Life I was in Death. <HI>Wherefore the Law is holy, and the Com∣mandment holy, and just and good,</HI> ver. 12. I no longer lay the Blame on this, but on the Cor∣ruption of my own Heart. I acknowledge that <HI>the Law is Spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under Sin,</HI> ver. 14. I now see the Spiritual Nature of the Law, and my own carnal, devilish Heart; <HI>sold under Sin,</HI> totally inslaved: (like Slaves bought with Money, who were absolutely at their Ma∣ster's Disposal.) <HI>For that which I do, I allow not; for what I would, I do not; but what I hate, that I do,</HI> ver. 15. Such is the Bondage under which
<PB N="182" REF="028060_0171_0FD68B74E87C5D58"/>I groan; such the Tyranny of my hard Master. <HI>To will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not. For the good that I would, I do not; but the Evil which I would not, that I do,</HI> ver. 18, 19. <HI>I find a Law,</HI> an inward constraining Power, <HI>that when I would do good, Evil is present with me. For I delight in</HI> (or con∣sent to) <HI>the Law of</HI> God, <HI>after the inward Man.</HI> (ver. 21, 22.) In my Mind: So the Apostle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> plains himself in the Words that immediately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> low; (and so <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>the inward Man;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> understood in all other <HI>Greek</HI> Writers.) <HI>But I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> another Law in my Members,</HI> another constraining Power, <HI>warring against the Law of my Mind,</HI> or inward Man, <HI>and bringing me into Captivity to the Law,</HI> or Power, <HI>of Sin,</HI> ver. 23. dragging me as it were at my Conqueror's Chariot-wheels, into the very Thing which my Soul abhors. <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</HI> ver. 24. Who shall deliver me from this helpless, dying Life; from this Bon∣dage of Sin and Misery! Till this is done, <HI>I my∣self</HI> (or rather, <HI>that I,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>that Man</HI> I am now personating) <HI>with the Mind,</HI> or inward Man, <HI>serve the Law of</HI> God; my mind, my Con∣science is on God's Side: <HI>But with the Flesh;</HI> with my Body, <HI>the Law of Sin,</HI> ver. 25. being hurried away by a Force I cannot resist.</P>
<P N="11">11. How lively a Portraiture is this of one <HI>un∣der the Law!</HI> One who feels the Burthen he cannot shake off; who pants after Liberty, Pow∣er and Love, but is in Fear and Bondage still! Until the Time that God answers the wretched Man, crying out, <HI>Who shall deliver me?</HI> from this Bondage of Sin, from this Body of
<PB N="183" REF="028060_0172_0FD68B7A71493FA0"/>Death? <HI>The Grace of</HI> God <HI>through Jesus Christ thy Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. 1. Then it is that this miserable Bondage ends, and he is no more <HI>under the Law, but un∣der Grace.</HI> This State we are thirdly to consider, the State of one who has found <HI>Grace</HI> or Favour, in the Sight of God, even the Father, and who has the <HI>Grace,</HI> or Power of the Holy Ghost, reigning in his Heart: Who has received, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anguage of the Apostle, 'the Spirit of Adoption, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whereby he now cries, Abba, Father!'</P>
<P N="2">2. <Q>He cried unto the Lord in his Trouble, and God delivers him out of his Distress.</Q> His Eyes are opened in quite another Manner than before, even to see a loving, gracious God. While he is calling, <HI>I beseech thee shew me thy Glory,</HI> he hears a Voice in his inmost Soul, <Q>I will make all my Goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the Name of the Lord: I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will shew Mercy to whom I will shew Mercy. And it is not long before the Lord descends in the Cloud, and proclaims the Name of the Lord.</Q> Then he sees (but not with the Eyes of Flesh and Blood.) <Q>The Lord, the Lord God: Merciful and gracious, Long-suffering, and abun∣dant in Goodness and Truth: Keeping Mercy for thousands, and forgiving Iniquities and Trans∣gressions and Sin.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. Heavenly, healing Light now breaks in upon his Soul. He <HI>looks on him whom he bad pierced,</HI> and God <HI>who out of Darkness commanded Light of shine, shineth in</HI> his <HI>Heart.</HI> He <HI>sees the Light of the</HI> glorious Love <HI>of</HI> God, <HI>in the Face of Jesus Christ.</HI> He hath a divine <HI>Evidence of Things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seen</HI> by Sense, even of <HI>the deep Things of</HI> God;
<PB N="184" REF="028060_0173_0FD68B7C54F73FA0"/>More particularly of the Love of God, of his pardoning Love to him that believes in Jesus. Overpowered with the Sight, his whole Soul cries out, <HI>My Lord, and my</HI> God! For he sees all his Iniquities laid on him, who <HI>bare them in his own Body on the Tree:</HI> He beholds the Lamb of God taking away his Sins. How clearly now does he discern, that <Q>God was in Christ, recon∣ciling the World unto himself! Making him Sin for us, who knew no Sin, that we might be made th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Righteousness of God through him</Q> And that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> himself is reconciled to God, by that Blood of the Covenant!</P>
<P N="4">4. Here end both the Guilt and Power of Sin. He can now say, <Q>I am crucified with Christ. Ne∣vertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. And the Life which I now live in the Flesh, even in this mortal Body, I live by Faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</Q> Here end Remorse and Sorrow of Heart, and the An∣guish of a wounded Spirit. God <HI>turneth his Hea∣viness into Joy.</HI> He <HI>made sore,</HI> and now <HI>his Hands bind up.</HI> Here ends also that Bondage un∣to Fear; for <HI>his Heart standeth fast, believing in the Lord.</HI> He cannot fear any longer the Wrath of God; for he knows it is now turned away from him, and looks upon him no more as an angry Judge, but as a loving Father. He cannot fear the Devil, knowing he has <HI>no Power, ex∣cept it be given him from above.</HI> He fears not Hell, being an Heir of the Kingdom of Heaven; consequently, he has no Fear of Death: by rea∣son whereof he was in Time past, for so many Years, <HI>subject to Bondage.</HI> Rather, knowing that <HI>if the earthly House of this Tabernacle be dissolv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="028060_0174_0FD68B7F5A9A64F0"/><Q>he hath a Building of God, a House not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens. He groaneth earnestly, desiring to be cloathed upon, with that House which is from Heaven.</Q> He groans to shake off this House of Earth, that <Q>Mortality may be swallowed up of Life:</Q> Knowing that <Q>God hath wrought him for the self same Thing: who hath also given him the Earnest of his Spirit.</Q></P>
<P N="5">5. And <HI>where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iberty;</HI> Liberty not only from Guilt and Fear, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from Sin, from that heaviest of all Yokes, that basest of all Bondage. His Labour is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot now in vain. The Snare is broken and he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣livered. He not only strives, but likewise pre∣vails; he not only fights, but conquers also. 'Henceforth he doth not serve Sin (Chap. vi. ver. 6, &amp;c.) <Q>He is dead unto Sin and alive unto God. Sin doth not now reign, even in his mortal Body, nor doth he obey it in the Desires thereof. He does not yield his Members as Instruments of Unright∣eousness unto Sin, but as Instruments of Righte∣ousness unto God. For being now made free from Sin, he is become the Servant of Righte∣ousness.</Q></P>
<P N="6">6. Thus <HI>having Peace with</HI> God, <HI>through our Lord Jesus Christ, rejoicing in Hope of the Glory of</HI> God, and having Power over all Sin, over every evil Desire, and Temper, and Word, and Work, he is a living Witness of the <HI>glorious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣berty of the Sons of</HI> God: All of whom, being Partakers of <HI>like precious Faith,</HI> bear Record with one Voice, <HI>We have received the Spirit of Adop∣tion, whereby we cry, Abba, Father!</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. It is this Spirit which continually <HI>worketh in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> both to will and to do of his good Pleasure.</HI> It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he that sheds the Love of God abroad in
<PB N="186" REF="028060_0175_0FD68B80DD3BC3C0"/>their Hearts, and the Love of all Mankind; there∣by purifying their Hearts from the Love of the World, from the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye, and the Pride of Life. It is by him they are delivered from Anger and Pride, from all vile and inordinate Affections. In conse∣quence, they are delivered from evil Words and Works, from all unholiness of Conversation: do∣ing no evil to any Child of Man, and being zea∣lous of all good Works.</P>
<P N="8">8. To sum up all. The <HI>Natural</HI> Man neith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> fears nor loves God; one <HI>under the Law,</HI> fears; one <HI>under Grace,</HI> loves him. The First, has no Light in the Things of God, but walks in utter Darkness; The Second sees the painful Light of Hell; The Third, the joyous Light of Heaven. He that sleeps in Death, has a False Peace. He that is awakened has no Peace at all. He that be∣lieves has true Peace, the Peace of God filling and ruling his Heart. The Heathen, baptized or unbaptized, hath a fancied Liberty, which is in∣deed Licentiousness: The <HI>Jew</HI> (or one under the <HI>Jewish</HI> Dispensation) is in an heavy, grievous Bon∣dage: The Christian enjoys the true glorious Li∣berty of the Sons of God. An unawakened Child of the Devil, sins willingly: One that is awakened sins unwillingly: A Child of God <HI>sin∣neth not,</HI> but <HI>keepeth himself, and the wicked one toucheth him not.</HI> To conclude; the Natural Man neither conquers nor fights; the Man un∣der the Law fights with Sin, but cannot conquer: The Man under Grace fights and conquers, yea, is <HI>more than Conqueror, through him that loveth him.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="187" REF="028060_0176_0FD68B825BD11BE8"/>
IV. 1. From this plain account of the three∣fold State of Man, the <HI>Natural,</HI> the <HI>Legal,</HI> and the <HI>Evangelical,</HI> it appears, that it is not sufficient, to divide Mankind, into Sincere and Insincere. A Man may be sincere in any of these States; not only when he has the <HI>Spirit of Adoption,</HI> but while he has the <HI>Spirit of Bondage unto Fear.</HI> Yea, while he has neither this Fear, nor Love. For undoubtedly there may be sincere Heathens, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell as sincere <HI>Jews</HI> or Christians. This Cir∣cumstance then, does by no means prove, that a Man is in a State of Acceptance with God.</P>
<P><HI>Examine yourselves</HI> therefore, not only whether ye are sincere, <HI>but whether ye be in the Faith.</HI> Examine narrowly; for it imports you much. What is the ruling Principle in your Soul? Is it the Love of God? Is it the Fear of God? Or is it neither one nor the other? Is it not rather, the Love of the World? the Love of Pleasure? or Gain? of Ease, or Reputation? if so, you are not come so far as a <HI>Jew.</HI> You are but a <HI>Heathen</HI> still. Have you Heaven in your Heart? Have you the Spirit of Adoption, ever crying, <HI>Abba, Father?</HI> Or do you cry unto God, as <HI>out of the Belly of Hell,</HI> overwhelmed with Sorrow and Fear? Or are you a Stranger to this whole Affair, and cannot imagine what I mean? Hea∣then, pull off the Mask. Thou hast never put on Christ. Stand barefaced. Look up to Hea∣ven. And own before Him that liveth for e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and ever, thou hast no Part either among the Sons or Servants of God.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="028060_0177_0FD68B8863F903D0"/>
Whosoever thou art, Dost thou commit Sin, or dost thou not? If thou dost, is it willingly or unwillingly? In either case God hath told thee whose thou art, <HI>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil.</HI> If thou committest it willingly, thou art his Faithful Servant. He will not fail to reward thy Labour. If unwillingly, still thou art his Servant. God deliver thee out of his Hands!</P>
<P>Art thou daily fighting against all Sin? and daily more than Conqueror? I acknowledge thee for a Child of God. O stand fast in thy glori∣ous Liberty. Art thou fighting, but not con∣quering; striving for the Mastery, but not able to attain? Then thou art not yet a Believer in Christ; but follow on; and thou shalt know the Lord. Art thou not fighting at all, but leading an easy, indolent, fashionable Life? O how hast thou dared to Name the Name of Christ? Only to make it a Reproach among the Heathen? Awake thou Sleeper! Call upon thy God: Before the Deep swallow thee up.</P>
<P N="2">2. Perhaps one Reason why so many think of themselves more highly than they ought to think, why they do not discern what State they are in, is, because these several States of Soul, are often mingled together, and in some Measure meet, in one and the same Person. Thus Experience shews, that the legal State, or State of Fear, is frequently mixt with the Natural. For few Men are so fast asleep in Sin, but they are sometimes, more or less awakened. As the Spirit of God does not <HI>wait for the Call of Man,</HI> so at some times he <HI>will</HI> be heard. He puts them in Fear, so that for a Season, at least, the Heathen <HI>know
<PB N="189" REF="028060_0178_0FD68B8B930FBAF0"/>themselves to be but Men.</HI> They feel the Burthen of Sin, and earnestly desire to flee from the Wrath to come. But not long. They seldom suffer the Arrows of Conviction to go deep into their Souls; but quickly stifle the Grace of God, and return to their Wallowing in the Mire.</P>
<P>In like Manner, the Evangelical State, or State of Love, is frequently mixt with the Legal. For few of those who have the Spirit of Bondage and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear, remain always without Hope. The wise and gracious God rarely suffers this; for he re∣membereth that we are but Dust. And he willeth not that <HI>the Flesh should fail before him, or the Spirit which he hath made.</HI> Therefore at such Times as he seeth Good, he gives a Dawning of Light unto them that sit in Darkness. He causes a Part of his Goodness to pass before them, and shews he is a God <HI>that heareth the Prayer.</HI> They see the Promise which is by Faith in Christ Jesus, tho' it yet be afar off: And hereby they are encou∣raged to <HI>run with Patience the Race which is set before them.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Another Reason why many deceive them∣selves, is because they do not consider, how far a Man may go, and yet be in a Natural, or at best a Legal State. A Man may be of a compassionate and a benevolent Temper, he may be affable, courteous, generous, friendly; he may have some Degree of Meekness, Patience, Temperance, and of many other moral Virtues. He may feel many Desires of shaking off all Vice, and attain∣ing higher Degrees of Virtue. He may abstain from much Evil; perhaps from all that is grosly contrary to Justice, Mercy or Truth. He may do much Good, may feed the Hungry, cloath the
<PB N="190" REF="028060_0179_0FD68B8CD6C31E30"/>Naked, relieve the Widow and Fatherless. He may attend Public Worship, use Prayer in pri∣vate, read many Books of Devotion: And yet for all this, he may be a mere Natural Man, knowing neither himself nor God; equally a Stranger to the Spirit of Fear and to that of Love; having neither repented nor believed the Gospel.</P>
<P>But suppose there were added to all this, a deep Conviction of Sin, with much Fear of the Wrath of God; vehement Desires to east off every Sin, and to fulfil all Righteousness; frequent rejoicing in Hope, and Touches of Love often glancing upon the Soul: Yet neither do these prove a Man to be <HI>under Grace,</HI> to have True, Living, Christian Faith, unless the Spirit of Adoption a∣bide in his Heart, unless he can continually cry, Abba, Father!</P>
<P N="4">4. Beware then, thou who art called by the Name of Christ, that thou come not short of the Mark of thy high Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling. Beware thou rest not, either in a Natural State, with too many that are accounted <HI>good Christians:</HI> Or in a Legal State, wherein those who are <HI>highly esteemed of Men,</HI> are generally content to live and die. Nay, but God hath prepared better Things for thee, if thou follow on till thou attain. Thou art not called to fear and tremble, like Devils, but to re∣joice and love, like the Angels of God. <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy</HI> God, <HI>with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind, and with all thy Strength.</HI> Thou shalt <HI>rejoice ever∣more.</HI> Thou shalt <HI>pray without ceasing.</HI> Thou shalt <HI>in every Thing give Thanks.</HI> Thou shalt do the Will of God <HI>on Earth as it is done in Hea∣ven.</HI> O <HI>prove</HI> thou <HI>what is that good and acceptable
<PB N="191" REF="028060_0180_0FD68B8E59C88660"/>and perfect Will of</HI> God. Now <HI>present</HI> thyself <HI>a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable to</HI> God. <HI>Where∣unto thou hast already attained, hold fast,</HI> by <HI>reaching forth unto those Things which are before;</HI> until the God <HI>of Peace make thee perfect in every good Work, working in thee that which is well-pleasing in his Sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be Glory for ever and ever! Amen!</HI></P>

<P>The Spirit itself heareth Witness with our Spi∣rit, that we are the Children of <HI>God.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HOW many vain Men, not understanding what they spake, neither whereof they af∣firmed, have wrested this Scripture, to the great Loss, if not the Destruction, of their Souls? How many have mistaken the Voice of their own Ima∣gination, for this <HI>Witness of the Spirit</HI> of God? And thence idly presumed; they were the Children of God, while they were doing the Works of the Devil? These are truly and properly <HI>Enthusiasts;</HI> and indeed in the worst Sense of the Word. But with what Difficulty are they convinced thereof? Especially, if they have drank deep into that Spirit of Error. All Endeavours to bring them to the Knowledge of themselves, they will then account <HI>fighting against</HI> God. And that Vehemence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Impetuosity of Spirit, which they call <HI>con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> earnestly for the Faith,</HI> sets them so far above all the usual Methods of Conviction, that we may well say, <HI>With Men it is impossible.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Who can then be surprized, if many reason∣able Men, seeing the dreadful Effects of this De∣lusion, and labouring to keep at the utmost Dis∣tance from it, should sometimes lean toward an∣other Extreme? If they are not forward to be∣lieve
<PB N="196" REF="028060_0183_0FD68BC630B8BF70"/>any who speak of havin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Witness, con∣cerning which others have so grievously erred? If they are almost ready, to set all down for <HI>Enthu∣siasts,</HI> who use the Expressions which have been so terribly abused. Yea, if they should question, whether the Witness or Testimony here spoken of, be the Privilege of <HI>ordinary</HI> Christians, and not rather, one of those <HI>extraordinary</HI> Gifts, which they suppose belonged only to the Aposte∣lick Age.</P>
<P N="3">3. But is there any Necessity laid upon us, of running either into one Extreme or the other? May we not steer a middle Course? Keep a suf∣ficient Distance from that Spirit of Error and En∣thusiasm, without denying the Gift of God, and giving up the great Privilege of his Children? Surely we may. In order thereto, let us consider, in the Presence and Fear of God,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>First, What is this <HI>Witness</HI> or <HI>Testimony of our Spirit?</HI> What is the <HI>Testimony of</HI> God's <HI>Spirit?</HI> And how does he <HI>bear Witness with our Spirit, that we are the Children of</HI> God?</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, How is this joint Testimony of God's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pirit and our own, clearly and solidly distinguished, from the Presumption of a Natural Mind; and from the Delusion of the Devil?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. 1. Let us first consider, What is the <HI>Wit∣ness</HI> or <HI>Testimony of our Spirit.</HI> But here I can∣not but desire all those who are for swallowing up the <HI>Testimony of the Spirit of</HI> God, in the <HI>rational Testimony</HI> of our own Spirit, to observe, That in this Text the Apostle is so far from speak∣ing
<PB N="197" REF="028060_0184_0FD68B9AEE0A77F0"/>of the Testimony of our own Spirit <HI>only,</HI> that it may be questioned, whether he speaks of it <HI>at all?</HI> Whether he does not speak, <HI>only</HI> of the Testimony of God's Spirit? It does not appear, but the original Text may be fairly understood thus. Thus Apostle had just said, in the preced∣ing Verse, <HI>Ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father,</HI> and immediately subjoins, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (some Copies read <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Which may be translated, <HI>The same Spirit beareth Witness</HI> to <HI>our Spirit, that we are the Children of</HI> God (the Proposition <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> only denoting, that he witnesses this <HI>at the same time</HI> that he enables us to cry Abba, Father!) But I contend not; seeing so many other Texts, with the Experience of all real Christians, sufficiently evince, that there is, in every Believer, both the Testimony of God's Spirit, and the Testimony of his own, that he is a Child of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. With regard to the latter, the Foundation thereof is laid in those numerous Texts of Scrip∣ture, which describe the Marks of the Children of God, and that so plain, that he which run∣neth may read them. These are also collected together, and placed in the strongest Light, by many both ancient and modern Writers. If any need farther Light he may receive it by attend∣ing on the Ministry of God's Word; by medi∣tating thereon before God in secret, and by con∣versing with those who have the Knowledge of his Ways. And by the Reason or Understanding that God has given him (which Religion was de∣signed not to extinguish, but to perfect: Accord∣ing to that of the Apostle, <HI>Brethren be not Chil∣dren
<PB N="198" REF="028060_0185_0FD68B9C9AF6FC10"/>in Understanding; in Malice</HI> (or Wicked∣ness) <HI>be ye Children; but in Understanding be ye Men,</HI> (1 Cor. xiv. 20.) Every Man applying those scriptural Marks to himself, may know, whether he is a Child of God. Thus if he know, First, <HI>as many as are led by the Spirit of</HI> God, into all holy Tempers and Actions, <HI>they are the Sons of</HI> God, (for which he has the infallible Assurance of holy Writ;) Secondly, I am thus <HI>led by the Spirit of</HI> God; he will easily conclude, There∣fore I am a <HI>Son of</HI> God.</P>
<P N="3">3. Agreeable to this are all those plain Declara∣tions of St. <HI>John</HI> in his first Epistle. <HI>Hereby we know, that we do know him, if we keep his Com∣mandments,</HI> Chap. ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. ver. 3. <HI>Whoso keepeth his Word, in him verily is the Love of</HI> God <HI>per∣fected; hereby we know that we are in him,</HI> that we are indeed the Children of God, ver. 5. <HI>If ye know, that he is Righteous, ye know that every one that doet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Righteousness is born of him,</HI> ver. 29. <HI>We know, that we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssed from Death unto Life, because we love the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>thren,</HI> Chap. iii. ver. 4. <HI>Hereby we know, that we are of the Truth, and shall assure our Hearts before him,</HI> ver. 18. Name∣ly because we <HI>love</HI> one another, <HI>not in Word, neither in Tongue; but in Deed and in Truth. Hereby know we, that we dwell in him, because he hath given us of his</HI> (loving) <HI>Spirit,</HI> Chap. iv. 13. And, <HI>Hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the</HI> (obedient) <HI>Spirit which he hath given us,</HI> Chap. iii. 24.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is highly probable, there never were any Children of God, from the Beginning of the World unto this Day, who were farther advan∣ced in the Grace of God, and the Knowledge of
<PB N="199" REF="028060_0186_0FD68B9E1C80A568"/>our Lord Jesus Christ, than the Apostle <HI>John</HI> at the Time when he wrote these Words, and the <HI>Fathers in Christ</HI> to whom he wrote. Notwith∣standing which, it is evident, both the Apostle himself, and all those Pillars in God's Temple, were very far from despising these Marks, of their being the Children of God; and that they ap∣plied them to their own Souls, for the Confir∣mation of their Faith. Yet all this is no other than rational Evidence; the <HI>Witness of our Spi∣rit,</HI> or Reason or Understanding. It all resolves into this: Those who have these Marks, they are the Children of God. But we have these Marks: Therefore we are Children of God.</P>
<P N="5">5. But how does it appear that we have these Marks? This is a question which still remains. How does it appear, that we do love God and our Neighbour? And that we keep his Com∣mandments? Observe, that the Meaning of the Question is, How does it appear to <HI>ourselves?</HI> (not to <HI>others.</HI>) I would ask him then that proposes this Question, How does it appear to you, That you are alive? And that you are now in Ease and not in Pain? Are you not immediately conscious of it? By the same immediate Consciousness you will know, if your Soul is alive to God: If you are saved from the Pain of proud Wrath, and have the Ease of a meek and quiet Spirit. By the same Means you cannot but perceive, if you love, rejoice, and delight in God. By the same, you must be directly assured, if you love your Neighbour as yourself; if you are kindly af∣fection'd to all Mankind, and full of Gentleness and Long-Suffering. And with regard to the Outward Mark of the Children of God, which
<PB N="200" REF="028060_0187_0FD68B9FBA93F8C0"/>is (according to St. <HI>John</HI>) the keeping his Commandments, You undoubtedly know in your own Breast, if, by the Grace of God, it belongs to you. Your Conscience informs you from Day to Day, if you do not take the Name of God within your Lips, unless with Seriousness and De∣votion, with Reverence and godly Fear: If you remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy: if you honour your Father and Mother; if you do to all as you would they should do unto you: if you possess y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Body in Sanctification and Ho∣nour: and if whether you eat or drink, you are temperate therein, and do all to the Glory of God.</P>
<P N="6">6. Now this is properly the <HI>Testimony of our own Spirit;</HI> even the Testimony of our Con∣science, that God hath given us to be holy of Heart, and holy in outward Conversation. It is a Consciousness of our having received, in and by the Spirit of Adoption, the Tempers men∣tioned in the Word of God, as belonging to his adopted Children: Even, a loving Heart toward God and toward all Mankind, hanging with child-like Confidence on God our Father, desir∣ing nothing but him, casting all our Care upon him, and embracing every Child of Man, with earnest tender affection; so as to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>y to lay down our Life for our Brother, as Christ lay down his Life for us: A Consciousness, that we are in∣wardly conformed, by the Spirit of God, to the Image of his Son, and that we walk before him in Justice, Mercy and Truth, doing the Things which are pleasing in his Sight.</P>
<P N="7">7. But what is that Testimony of God's Spi∣rit, which is super-added to and conjoined with
<PB N="201" REF="028060_0188_0FD68BA7B85B2F60"/>this? How does he <HI>bear witness with our Spirit, that we are the Children of GOD.</HI> It is hard to find Words in the Language of Men, to explain <HI>the deep Things of GOD.</HI> Indeed there are none that will adequately express, what the Children of God experience. But perhaps one might say (desiring any who are taught of God, to correct, to soften or Strengthen the Expression.) The Te∣stimony of the Spirit, is an inward Impression on the Soul, whereby the Spirit of God directly <HI>witnesses to my Spirit, That I am a Child of GOD;</HI> that Jesus Christ hath loved me, and given himself for me: That all my Sins are blotted out, and I, even I, am reconciled to God.</P>
<P N="8">8. That this <HI>Testimony of the Spirit of GOD</HI> must needs, in the very Nature of Things, be antecedent to the <HI>Testimony of our own Spirit,</HI> may appear from this single Consideration. We must be holy of Heart and holy in Life, before we can be conscious that we are so; before we can have <HI>the Testimony of our Spirit,</HI> that we are inwardly and outwardly Holy. But we must love God, before we can be holy at all; this being the Root of all Holiness. Now we cannot love God, till we know he loves us. <HI>We love Him, because he first loved us.</HI> And we cannot know his Pardoning Love to us, till his Spirit witnesses it to our Spirit. Since therefore this <HI>Testimony of his Spirit</HI> must precede the Love of God and all Holiness, of Consequence it must precede our in∣ward Consciousness thereof, or, the <HI>Testimony of our Spirit</HI> concerning them.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="202" REF="028060_0189_0FD68BA8B2E196C8"/>
9. Then, and not till then, when the Spirit of God beareth that Witness to our Spirit, "God hath loved thee, and given his own Son to be the Propitiation for thy Sins; the Son of God hath loved thee, and hath washed thee from thy Sins in his Blood:" <HI>We love</HI> God, <HI>because he first loved us,</HI> and for his Sake we <HI>love our Brother also.</HI> And of this we cannot but be conscious to ourselves: We <HI>know the Things that are freely given to us of</HI> God. We know that we love God and keep his Com∣mandments. And <HI>hereby also we know that we are of</HI> God. This is that Testimony of our own Spirit; which, so long as we continue to love God and keep his Commandments, continues joined with the Testimony of God's Spirit, <HI>that we are the Children of</HI> God.</P>
<P N="10">10. Not that I would, by any means, be un∣derstood, by any Thing which has been spoken concerning it, to exclude the Operation of the Spirit of God, even from the <HI>Testimony of our own Spirit.</HI> In no wise. It is he that not only worketh in us every Manner of Thing that is good, but also shines upon his own Work, and clearly shews what he has wrought. According∣ly this is spoken of by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> as one great End of our receiving the Spirit, <HI>That we may know the Things which are freely given to us of</HI> God: that he may strengthen the Testimony of our Conscience, touching our <HI>Simplicity and Godly Sin∣cerity,</HI> and give us to discern in a fuller and stronger Light, that we now do the Things which please him.</P>
<P N="11">11. Should it still be enquired, How does the Spirit of God, <HI>bear Witness with our Spirit, that we are the Children of</HI> God, so as to exclude all
<PB N="203" REF="028060_0190_0FD68BAA1BC1C620"/>Doubt, and evince the Reality of our Sonship? The answer is clear, from what has been ob∣served above. And first, as to the Witness of our Spirit. The Soul as intimately and evidently per∣ceives, when it loves, delights, and rejoices in God, as when it loves and delights in any Thing on Earth. And it can no more doubt, whe∣ther it loves, delights and rejoices, or no, than whether it exists, or no. If therefore this be just Reasoning.</P>
<P>He that now loves God, that delights and re∣joices in him, with an humble Joy, an holy Delight, and an obedient Love, is a Child of God:</P>
<P>But I thus love, delight, and rejoice in God;</P>
<P>Therefore I am a Child of God: Then a Christian can in no wise doubt, of his being a Child of God. Of the Former Propo∣sition, he has as full an Assurance, as he has that the Scriptures are of God. And of his thus loving God, he has an Inward Proof, which is nothing short of Self-evidence. Thus the <HI>Testi∣mony of our own Spirit</HI> is with the most intimate Conviction manifested to our Hearts; in such a Manner, as beyond all reasonable Doubt, to e∣vince the Reality of our Sonship.</P>
<P N="12">12. The <HI>Manner</HI> how the Divine Testimony is manifested to the Heart, I do not take upon me to explain. <HI>Such Knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me; I cannot attain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it. The Wind bloweth:</HI> And <HI>I hear the Sound thereof,</HI> But I cannot <HI>tell how it cometh, or whither it goeth.</HI> As no one knoweth the Things of a Man, save the Spirit of a Man that is in him; so the <HI>Manner</HI> of the Things of God knoweth no one,
<PB N="204" REF="028060_0191_0FD68BAB95E99A98"/>save the Spirit of God. But the Fact we know: namely, that the Spirit of God does give a Be∣liever such a Testimony of his Adoption, that while it is present to the Soul, he can no more doub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Reality of his Sonship, than he can doubt the Shining of the Sun, while he stands in the full Blaze of his Beams.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. How this joint Testimony of God's Spirit and our Spirit, may be clearly and solidly distinguished, from the Presumption of a natural Mind, and from the Delusion of the Devil, is the next Thing to be considered. And it highly im∣ports all who desire the Salvation of God, to consider it with the deepest Attention, as they would not deceive their own Souls. An Error in this is generally observed to have the most fatal Consequences: the rather, because he that errs seldom discovers his Mistake, till it is too late to remedy it.</P>
<P N="2">2. And first, how is this Testimony to be di∣stinguished from the Presumption of a natural Mind? It is certain, one who was never con∣vinced of Sin, is always ready to flatter himself, and to think of himself, especially in spiritual Things, more highly than be ought to think. And hence, it is in no wise strange if one who is vainly puffed up by his fleshy Mind, when he hears of this Privilege of true Christians, among whom he undoubtedly ranks himself, should soon work himself up into a Persuasion, that he is al∣ready possest thereof. Such Instances now abound in the World, and have abounded in all Ages. How then may the real Testimony of the Spirit with our Spirit, be distinguished from this damning Presumption?</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="205" REF="028060_0192_0FD68BB083B733D0"/>
3. I answer, the Holy Scriptures abound with Marks, whereby the one may be distinguished from the other. They describe in the plaine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Manner the Circumstance which go before, which accompany, and which follow, the true, genuine Testimony of the Spirit of God with the Spirit of a Believer. Whoever carefully weighs and attends to these, will not need to put Darkness for Light. He will perceive so w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> Difference with Respect to all these, between the Real and Pretended Witness of the Spirit, that there will be no Danger, I might say, no Possibi∣lity, of confounding the one with the other.</P>
<P N="4">4. By these, one who vainly presumes on the Gift of God, might surely know, if he really de∣sired it, that he hath been hitherto <HI>given up to a strong Delusion,</HI> and suffered to <HI>believe a Lie.</HI> For the Scriptures lay down those clear, obvious Marks as preceding, accompanying and following that Gift, which a little Reflection would con∣vince him, beyond all Doubt, were never found in his Soul. For Instance, the Scripture describes Repentance, or Conviction of Sin, as constantly going before this Witness of Pardon. So, <HI>Re∣pent; for the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand,</HI> Matt iii. 2. <HI>Repent ye, and believe the Gospel,</HI> Mark i. 15. <HI>Repent, and be baptized every one of you, for the Remission of Sins,</HI> Acts ii. 38. <HI>Re∣pent ye therefore and be converted, that your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins may be blotted out,</HI> Chap. iii. 19. In Conformity whereto our Church also continually places Re∣pentance, before Pardon or the Witness of it. "He pardoneth and absolveth all them that truly repent and unfeignedly believe his Holy Gospel." "Almighty God—hath promised Forgiveness
<PB N="206" REF="028060_0193_0FD68BB403CDB1A0"/>of Sins to all of them, who with hearty Repen∣tance and true Faith return unto him." But he is a Stranger even to this Repentance. He hath never known <HI>a broken and a contrite Heart. The Remembrance of</HI> his <HI>Sins</HI> was never <HI>grievous unto</HI> him, nor <HI>the Burthen of them intolerable.</HI> In re∣peating those Words, he never meant what he said; he merely paid a Compliment to God. And were it only from the Want of this previous Work of God, he hath too great Reason to be∣lieve, that he hath grasped a mere Shadow, and never yet known the real Privilege of the Sons of God.</P>
<P N="5">5. Again, the Scriptures describe the being born of God, which must precede the Witness that we are his Children, as a vast and mighty Change, a Change <HI>from Darkness to Light,</HI> as well as <HI>from the Power of Satan unto</HI> God: As a <HI>passing from Death unto Life,</HI> a Resurrection from the Dead. Thus the Apostle to the <HI>Ephe∣sians; You hath he quickened who were dead in Trespasses and Sins,</HI> Chap. ii. ver. 1. And again, <HI>When we were dead in Sins, he hath quickened us together with Christ; and hath raised us up toge∣ther, and made us sit together, in heavenly Places, in Christ Jesus,</HI> ver. 5.6. But what knoweth he, concerning whom we now speak, of any such Change as this? He is altogether unacquainted with this whole Matter. This is a Language which he does not understand. He tells you, "He always was a Christian. He knows no Time when he had need of such a Change." By this also, if he give himself leave to think, may he know, that he is not born of the Spirit: That he has never yet known God; but has mistaken the Voice of Nature for the Voice of God.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="207" REF="028060_0194_0FD68BB568979A00"/>
6. But waving the Consideration of whatever he has or has not experienced in Time past; by the present Marks may we easily distinguish a Child of God, from a presumptuous Self-deceiver. The Scriptures describe that Joy in the Lord which accompanies the Witness of his Spirit, as an humble Joy, a Joy that abases to the Dust; that makes a pardon'd Sinner cry out, "I am vile! What am I, or my Father's House?—Now mine Eye seeth thee, I abhor myself in Dust and Ashes!" And wherever Lowliness is, there is Meekness, Patience, Gentleness, Long-suffering, There is a soft, yielding Spirit; a Mildness and Sweetness: a Tenderness of Soul which Words canno express. But do these Fruits attend that <HI>supposed</HI> Testimony of the Spirit, in a Presumptu∣ous Man? Just the Reverse. The more consi∣dent he is of the Favour of God, the more is he lifted up. The more does he exalt himself; the more haughty and assuming is his whole Behaviour. The stronger Witness he imagines himself to have, the more overbearing is he to all around him; the more incapable of receiving any Reproof, the more impatient of Contradiction. Instead of be∣ing more meek, and gentle, and teachable, more <HI>swift to hear, and slow to speak,</HI> he is more slow to hear and swift to speak, more unready to learn of any one; more fiery and vehement in his Temper, and eager in his Conversation. Yea, perhaps, there will sometimes appear a Kind of Fierceness in his Air, his Manner of Speaking, his whole Deportment, as if he were just going to take the Matter out of God's Hands, and himself to <HI>devour the Adversaries.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><PB N="208" REF="028060_0195_0FD68BB74560D0D8"/>
7. Once more. The Scriptures teach, <HI>this is the Love of</HI> God (the sure Mark thereof) <HI>that we keep his Commandments,</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> ver. 3. And our Lord himself saith, <HI>he that keepeth my Com∣mandments, he it is that loveth me John</HI> xiv. 21. Love rejoices to obey; to do n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> every Point, whatever is acceptable to the Beloved. A true Lover of God hastens to do his Will on Earth as it is done in Heaven. But is this the Character of the presumptuous Pretender to the Love of God? Nay, but his Love gives him a Liberty to disobey, to break, not keep, the Command∣ments of God. Perhaps when he was in Fear of the Wrath of God, the did labour to do his Will. But now looking on himself as <HI>not under the Law,</HI> he thinks he is no longer obliged to ob∣serve it. He is therefore less zealous of good Works, less careful to abstain from Evil; less watchful over his own Heart, less jealous over his Tongue. He is less earnest to deny himself, and to take up h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Cross daily. In a Word the whole Form of his Life is changed, since he has fancied himself to be at <HI>Liberty.</HI> He is no longer <HI>exer∣cising himself unto Godliness; wrestling not</HI> only <HI>with Flesh and Blood, but with Principalities and F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wers, enducing Hardships, agonizing to enter in at the strait Gate.</HI> No; he has found an easier W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to Heaven; a broad, smooth, flowry Path; in which he can say to his Soul. "Soul, take thy F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se; eat, drin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and be merry." It follows with undeniable Evidence, that he has not the true Testimony of his own Spirit. He cannot be conscious of having those Marks which he hath not; that Lowliness, Meekness, and Obedience. Nor yet can the Spirit of the God of Truth bear
<PB N="209" REF="028060_0196_0FD68BB860C2B030"/>Witness to a lie; or testify that he is a Child of God, when he is manifestly a Child of the De∣vil.</P>
<P N="8">8. Discover thyself, thou poor Self-deceiver! Thou who art confident of being a Child of God, thou who sayest, "I have the Witness in myself," and therefore defiest all thy Enemies. Thou art weighed in the Balance and found wanting; even in the Balance of the Sanctuary. The Word of the Lord hath tried thy Soul, and proved thee to be reprobate Silver. Thou art not lowly of Heart. Therefore thou hast not received the Spirit of Jesus unto this Day. Thou art not gentle and meek; therefore thy Joy is nothing worth: It is not Joy in the Lord. Thou dost not keep his Commandments; therefore thou lovest him not, neither art thou Partaker of the Holy Ghost. It is consequently, as certain and as evident, as the Oracles of God can make it, his Spirit doth not bear Witness with thy Spirit, that thou art a Child of God. O cry unto him that the Seales may fall off thine Eyes, that thou mayest know thyself as thou art known; that thou mayest receive the Sentence of Death in thyself, till thou hear the Voice that raises the Dead, saying, "be of good Cheer: Thy Sins are forgiven; thy Faith hath made thee whole."</P>
<P N="9">9. "But how may one who has the real Wit∣ness in himself distinguish it from Presumption:" How, I pray, do you distinguish Day from Night? How do you distinguish Light from Darkness? Or the Light of a Star, or glimmering Taper, from the Light of the Noon-day Sun? Is there not an inherent, obvious, essential Difference be∣tween the one and the other? And do you not,
<PB N="210" REF="028060_0197_0FD68BBA433BFCD8"/>immediately and directly perceive that Difference, provided your Senses are rightly disposed? In like Manner, there is an inhorent, essential Difference between Spiritual Light and Spiritual Darkness; And between the Light wherewith the Sun of Righteousness shines upon our Hearts, and that glimmering Light, which arises only from <HI>Sparks of</HI> our <HI>own kindling.</HI> And this Difference also is immediately and directly perceived, if our Spiritual Senses are rightly disposed.</P>
<P N="10">10. To require a more minute and philosophi∣cal Account of the <HI>Manner</HI> whereby we distin∣guish these, and of the <HI>Criteria,</HI> or intrinsic Marks, whereby we know the Voice of God, is to make a Demand which can never be an∣swered; no, not by one who has the deepest Knowledge of God. Suppose, when <HI>Paul</HI> an∣swered before <HI>Agrippa,</HI> the wise <HI>Roman</HI> had said, "Thou talkest of hearing the Voice of the Son of God. How dost thou know, it was his Voice? By what <HI>Criteria,</HI> what intrinsic Markes dost thou know the Voice of God? Explain to me, the <HI>Manner</HI> of distinguishing this, from a Human or Angelic Voice." Can you believe, the Apostle himself would have once attempted to answer so Idle a Demand? And yet doubtless the Moment he heard that Voice, he knew it was the Voice of God. But <HI>how</HI> he knew this who is able to explain? Perhaps neither Man nor Angel.</P>
<P N="11">11. To come yet closer. Suppose God were now to speak to any Soul, "Thy Sins are for∣given thee." He must be willing that Soul should know his Voice; otherwise he would speak in vain. And he is able to effect this; for when∣ever
<PB N="211" REF="028060_0198_0FD68BBB552E39D8"/>he wills, to do is present with him. And he does effect it. That Soul is absolutely assur'd "This Voice is the Voice of God." <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yet he who hath that Witness in himself, cannot ex∣plain it to one who hath not. Nor indeed is it to be expected that he should. Were there any natural Medium to prove, or natural Method to explain the Things of God, to unexperienced Men; then the natural Man might discern and know the Things of the Spirit of God. But this is utterly contrary to the Assertion of the Apostle, that <HI>he cannot know them; because they are spiritually discerned;</HI> even by spiritual Senses, which the natural Man hath not.</P>
<P N="12">12. "But how shall I know, that my spiri∣tual Senses are rightly disposed? This also is a Question of vast Importance. For it a Man mis∣take in this, he may run on in endless Error and Delusion. And how am I assured, that this is not my Case; and that I do not mistake the Voice of the Spirit?" Even by the <HI>Testimony of your own Spirit;</HI> by <HI>the Answer of a good Con∣science toward</HI> God. By the Fruits which he hath wrought in your Spirit you shall know the <HI>Testimony of the Spirit of</HI> God. Hereby you shall know, that you are in no Delusion, that you have not deceived your own Soul. The imme∣diate Fruits of the Spirit, ruling in the Heart, are <HI>Love, Joy, Peace; Bowels of Mercies, Humble∣ness of Mind, Meekness, Gentleness, Long-suffering,</HI> And the outward Fruits are, The doing Good to all Men; the doing no Evil to any; and the walking in the Light; a zealous, uniform Obe∣dience to all the Commandments of God.</P>
<P N="13">13. By the same Fruits shall you distinguish
<PB N="212" REF="028060_0199_0FD68BBCDFDC6328"/>this Voice of God, from any Delusion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Devil. That proud Spirit cannot humble the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before God. He neither can nor would soften thy Heart, and melt it first into earnest Mourn∣ing after God, and then into filial Love. It is not the Adversary of God and Man, that enables shee to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Neighbour; or to put on Meek∣ness, Gentleness, Patience, Temperance, and the whole Armour of God. He is not divided against himself, or a Destroyer of Sin, his own Work. No; it is none but the Son of God who com∣eth <HI>to destroy the Works of the Devil.</HI> As surely therefore as Holiness is of God, and as Sin is the Work of the Devil, so surely the Witness thou hast in thyself is not of Satan, but of God.</P>
<P N="14">14. Well then mayest thou say, <HI>Thanks be unto</HI> God <HI>for his unspeakable Gift!</HI> Thanks be unto God, who giveth me to <HI>know in whom I have believed:</HI> Who <HI>hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into my Heart, crying, Abba, Father,</HI> and even now <HI>bearing Witness with my Spirit, that I am a Child of</HI> God! And see, that not only thy Lips, but thy Life shew for his Praise. He hath sealed thee for his own; <HI>glorify him</HI> then <HI>in thy Body and thy Spirit which are</HI> his. Beloved, if thou <HI>hast this Hope in</HI> thyself; <HI>purify</HI> thyself <HI>as he is pure.</HI> White thou beholdest <HI>what manner of Love the Father hath given</HI> thee, that thou shouldest <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e called a Child of</HI> God; <HI>cleanse</HI> thyself <HI>from all Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit, perfecting Holiness in the Fear of</HI> God: And let all thy Thoughts, Words, and Works be a spiritual Sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God through Christ Jesus!</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2 COR. i. 12.</HI></BIBL>
<P>This is our Rejoicing, the Testimony of our Conscience, that in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not with fleshly Wisdom, but by the Grace of <HI>GOD,</HI> we have had our Con∣versation in the World.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. SUCH is the Voice of every true Believer in Christ, so long as he abides in Faith and Love. <HI>He that followeth me,</HI> saith our Lord, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣eth not in Darkness:</HI> And while he hath the Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, he rejoiceth therein. <HI>As</HI> he <HI>hath received the Lord Jesus Christ, so</HI> he <HI>walketh in him.</HI> And while <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> walketh in him, the Exhortation of the Apostle takes place in his Soul Day by Day, <HI>Rejoice in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lord always, and again I say, rejoice.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. But that we may not build our House upon the Sand, (lest when the Rains descend, and the Winds blow, and the Floods arise and beat upon it, it fall, and great be the Fall thereof) I intend, in the following Discourse, to shew, what is the Nature and Ground of a Christian's Joy. We know, in general, It is that happy Pea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, that calm Satisfaction of Spirit, which arises from such a Testimony of his Conscience, as is here de∣scribed by the Apostle. But in order to under∣stand this the more throughly, it will be requi∣site to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gh all his Words: Whence will easily
<PB N="216" REF="028060_0202_0FD68B97F1129388"/>appear, both what we are to understand by <HI>Con∣science,</HI> and what, by the <HI>Testimony</HI> thereof; and also, How he that hath this Testimony rejoiceth evermore.</P>
<P N="3">3. And, first, What are we to understand by <HI>Conscience?</HI> What is the Meaning of this World that is in every one's Mouth? One would ima∣gine, it was an exceeding difficult Thing, to dis∣cover this, when we consider, how large and nu∣merous Volumes have been from time to time wrote on this Subject: And how all the Trea∣sures of ancient and modern Learning have been ransacked, in order to explain it. And yet it is to be feared, it has not received much Light from all those elaborate Enquiries. Rather, have not most of those Writers puzzled the Cause, <HI>darken∣ing Counsel by Words without Knowledge;</HI> per∣plexing a Subject, plain in itself, and easy to be understood? For set aside but hard Words, and every Man of an honest Heart will soon under∣stand the Thing.</P>
<P N="4">4. God has made us Thinking Beings, ca∣pable of perceiving what is present, and of re∣flecting or looking back on what is past. In par∣ticular, we are capable of perceiving, whatsoever passes in our own Hearts or Lives; of knowing whatsoever we feel or do; and that either while it passes, or when it is past. This we mean when we say, Man is a <HI>conscious</HI> Being: He hath a <HI>Consciousness</HI> or inward Perception, both of Things present and past relating to himself, of his own Tempers and outward Behaviour. But what we usually term <HI>Conscience,</HI> implies some∣what more than this. It is not barely, The Knowledge of our present, or the Remembrance
<PB N="217" REF="028060_0203_0FD68BC7B3357770"/>of our preceding Life. To remember, to bear witness either of past or present Things, is only one, and the least Office of Conscience. Its main Business is to excuse or accuse, to approve or disapprove, to acquit or condemn.</P>
<P N="5">5. Some late Writers indeed have given a new Name to this, and have chose to stile it, a <HI>moral Sense.</HI> But the old Word seems preferable to the new, were it only on this Account, That it is more common and familiar among Men, and therefore easier to be understood. And to Chris∣tians it is undeniably preferable, on another Ac∣count also; namely, because it is Scriptural; be∣cause it is the Word which the Wisdom of God hath chose to use in the Inspired Writings.</P>
<P>And according to the Meaning wherein it is generally used there, particularly in the Epistles of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> we may understand by Conscience, A Faculty or Power, implanted by God in every Soul that comes into the World, of perceiving what is Right or Wrong in his own Heart or Life, in his Temper, Thoughts, Words and Actions.</P>
<P N="6">6. But what is the <HI>Rule</HI> whereby Men are to judge of Right and Wrong? Whereby their Con∣science is to be directed? The Rule of Heathens, (as the Apostle teaches elsewhere) is <HI>the Law written in their Hearts. These,</HI> saith he, <HI>not hav∣ing the</HI> (outward) <HI>Law, are a Law unto them∣selves: Who shew the Work of the Law</HI> (that which the outward Law prescribes) <HI>written in their Heart,</HI> by the Finger of God; <HI>their Con∣science also bearing witness,</HI> whether they walk by this Rule, or not; <HI>and their Thoughts the mean while accusing, or else excusing,</HI> acquitting, de∣fending
<PB N="218" REF="028060_0204_0FD68BC8DD795578"/>them, (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 14, 15. But the Christian Rule of Right and Wrong is the Word of God, the Writings of the Old and New Testament: All which the Prophets and <HI>Holy Men of Old</HI> wrote <HI>as they were moved by the Holy Ghost: All</HI> that <HI>Scripture</HI> which was <HI>given by Inspiration of</HI> God, <HI>and</HI> which <HI>is</HI> indeed <HI>pro∣fitable for Doctrine,</HI> or teaching the whole Will of God: <HI>for Reproof</HI> of what is contrary there∣to; <HI>for Correction</HI> of Error, <HI>and for Instruction</HI> (or training us up) <HI>in Righteousness.</HI> 2 Tim. iii. 16.</P>
<P>This is <HI>a Lanthorn unto</HI> a Christian's <HI>Feet, and a Light in all</HI> his <HI>Paths.</HI> This alone he receives as his Rule of Right or Wrong, of whatever is really Good or Evil. He esteems nothing Good, but what is here enjoined, either directly or by plain Consequence. He accounts nothing Evil but what is here forbidden, either in Terms, or by undeniable Inference. Whatever the Scrip∣ture neither forbids nor enjoins, (either directly, or by plain Consequence) he believes to be of an indifferent Nature, to be in itself neither Good nor Evil: This being the whole and sole out∣ward Rule, whereby his Conscience is to be di∣rected in all Things.</P>
<P N="7">7. And if it be directed thereby in fact, then hath he <HI>the Answer of a good Conscience toward</HI> God. A <HI>good Conscience</HI> is what is elsewhere termed by the Apostle, a <HI>Conscience void of Of∣fence.</HI> So, what he at one time expresses thus, <HI>I have lived in all good Conscience before</HI> God <HI>until this Day,</HI> Acts xxiii. 1. he denotes at ano∣ther, by that Expression, <HI>Herein do I exercise myself, to have always a Conscience void of Offence toward</HI> God <HI>and toward Man,</HI> Chap. xxiv. 16.
<PB N="219" REF="028060_0205_0FD68BCA765170F8"/>Now in order to this, there is absolutely required, First, A Right Understanding of the Word of God, of his <HI>holy and acceptable and perfect Will</HI> concerning us, as it is revealed therein. For it is impossible we should walk by a Rule, if we do not know what it means. There is, Secondly, required (which how few have attained?) a true Knowledge of ourselves; a Knowledge both of our Hearts and Lives, of our inward Tempers and outward Conversation: seeing if we know them not, it is not possible that we should com∣pare them with our Rule. There is required, Thirdly, an Agreement of our Hearts and Lives, of our Tempers and Conversation, of our Thoughts and Words and Works with that Rule, with the written Word of God. For without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if we have any Conscience at all, it can be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly an evil Conscience. There is, Fourthly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quired, and inward Perception, of this Agree∣ment with our Rule. And this habitual Per∣ception, this inward Consciousness itself, is pro∣perly a <HI>Good Conscience;</HI> or (in the other Phrase of the Apostle) <HI>A Conscience void of Offence, to∣ward</HI> God <HI>and toward Man.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. But whoever desires to have a Conscience thus void of Offence, let him see that he lay the right Foundation. Let him remember, <HI>Other Foundation</HI> of this <HI>can no Man lay, than that which is laid, even Jesus Christ.</HI> And let him also be mindful, that no Man buildeth on him but by a Living Faith; that no Man is a Bartaker of Christ, until he can clearly testify, <HI>The Life which I now live, I live <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Faith in the Son of</HI> God; in him who is n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aled</HI> in my Heart; who <HI>loved me, and gave himself for me.</HI> Faith
<PB N="220" REF="028060_0206_0FD68BCCADED0CB0"/>alone is that Evidence, that Conviction, that De∣monstration of Things invisible, whereby the Eyes of our Understanding being opened, and Divine Light poured in upon them, we <HI>see the wondrous Things of</HI> God's <HI>Law,</HI> the Excellency and Purity of it; the Heighth and Depth, and Length and Breadth thereof, and of every Com∣mandment contained therein. It is by Faith, that beholding <HI>the Light of the Glory of</HI> God, <HI>in the Face of Jesus Christ,</HI> we perceive, as in a Glass, all that is in ourselves, yea, the inmost Motions of our Souls. And by this alone can that blessed Love of God be <HI>shed abroad in our Hearts,</HI> which enables us so to love one another as Christ loved us. By this, is that gracious Pro∣mise fulfilled, unto all the <HI>Israel</HI> of God, <HI>I will put my Laws into their Minds, and write</HI> (or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> grave) <HI>them in their Hearts,</HI> Heb. viii. 10. Her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> by producing in their Souls, an entire Agreement with his holy and perfect Law, and <HI>bringing into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>And as an evil Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit, so a good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit. As the Heart therefore of a Believer, so likewise his Life is thoroughly conformed to the Rule of God's Commandments. In a Consci∣ousness whereof, he can give Glory to God, and say, with the Apostle, <HI>This is our Rejoicing, the Testimony of our Conscience, that in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not with fleshly Wisdom, but by the Grace of</HI> God, <HI>we have had our Conversation in the World.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>We have had our Conversation.</HI> The A∣postle in the Original, expresses this by one single Word (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.) But the Meaning thereof it
<PB N="221" REF="028060_0207_0FD68BCF84B3ACA0"/>exceeding broad, taking in our whole Deport∣ment, yea, every inward as well as outward Cir∣cumstance, whether relating to our Soul or Bo∣dy. It includes every Motion of our Heart, of our Tongue, of our Hands and bodily Members. It extends to all our Actions and Words; to the Employment of all our Powers and Faculties; to the Manner of using every Talent we have re∣ceived, with respect either to God or Man.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>We have had our Conversation in the World;</HI> even in the World of the Ungodly: Not o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y among the Children of God (that were, compa∣ratively, a little Thing:) But among the Chil∣dren of the Devil, among those that <HI>lie in Wick∣edness,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>in the Wicked one.</HI> What a World is this! How throughly impregnated with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Spirit it continually breathes! as our God is good and doth good, so the God of this World, and all his Children, are evil, and do evil, (so far as they are suffered) to all the Children of God. Like their Father, they are always lying in wait, or <HI>walking about, seeking whom they may devour:</HI> Using Fraud or Force, secret Wites or open Violence, to destroy those who are not of the World: Continually warring against our Souls, and by old or new Weapons and Devices of every kind, labouring to bring them back into the Snare of the Devil, into the broad Road th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> leadeth to Destruction.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>We have had our,</HI> whole <HI>Conversation in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch a World, in Simplicity and godly Sincerity,</HI> First, <HI>in Simplicity.</HI> This is what our Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> re∣commends, under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a <HI>Sing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e. The Light of the Body, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is the Exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. If therefore thine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be sing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whole body shall be
<PB N="222" REF="028060_0208_0FD68BD1448A3B40"/>full of Light.</HI> The Meaning whereof is this. What the Eye is to the Body, that the Intention is, to all the Words and Actions. If therefore this Eye of thy Soul be single, all thy Actions and Conversation, shall be <HI>full of Light,</HI> of the Light of Heaven; of Love and Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost.</P>
<P>We are then simple of Heart, when the Eye of our Mind is singly fixt on God: When in all Things we aim at God alone, as our God, our Portion, our Strength, our Happiness, our exceeding great Reward, our All, in Time and Eternity. This is Simplicity; when a steady View, a single Intention of promoting his Glory, of doing and suffering his blessed Will, runs thro' our whole Soul, fills all our Heart, and is the constant Spring of all our Thoughts, Desires and Purposes.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>We have had our Conversation in the World,</HI> Secondly, <HI>in godly Sincerity.</HI> The Difference be∣tween Simplicity and Sincerity seems to be chiefly this: Simplicity regards the Intention itself, Sin∣cerity, the Execution of it. And this Sincerity relates not barely to our Words, but to our whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onversation, as described above. It is not here to be understood in that narrow Sense, wherein St. <HI>Paul</HI> himself sometimes uses it, for speaking the Truth, or abstaining from Guile, from Craft and Dissimulation. But in a more extensive Meaning, as actually hitting the Mark which we a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m at by Simplicity. Accordingly it implies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this Place, that we do in fact speak and do all to the Glory of God; that all our Words are not only pointed at this, but actually con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ve there∣to; that all our Actions flow on in an even
<PB N="223" REF="028060_0209_0FD68BD30380F130"/>Stream, uniformly subservient to this great End: And that in our whole Lives, we are moving strait toward God, and that continually; walk∣ing steadily on in the High-way of Holiness, in the Paths of Justice, Mercy and Truth.</P>
<P N="13">13. This Sincerity is termed by the Apostle, Godly Sincerity, or the Sincerity of God, (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) to prevent our mistaking or con∣founding it with the Sincerity of the Heathens: (For they had also a kind of Sincerity among them, for which they professed no small Vene∣ration) likewise to denote the Object and End of this, as of every Christian Virtue; seeing whatever does not ultimately tend to God, sinks among <HI>the beggarly Elements of the World.</HI> By styling it, the Sincerity of God, he also points out the Author of it, the <HI>Father of Light, from whom every good and perfect Gift descendeth:</HI> Which is still more clearly declared in the fol∣lowing Words, <HI>Not with fleshly Wisdom, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Grace of</HI> God.</P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>Not with fleshly Wisdom.</HI> As if he had said, We cannot thus converse in the World, by any natural Strength of understanding, neither by any naturally-acquired Knowledge or Wisdo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> We cannot gain this Simplicity, or practise this Sincerity, by the Force either of Good Sense, Good Nature, or Good Breeding. It overshoots all our Native Courage and Resolution, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as all our Precepts of Philosophy. The Power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Custom is not able to train us up to this, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the most exquisite Rules of Human Education. Neither could I <HI>Paul</HI> ever attain hereto, notwith∣standing all the Advantages I enjoyed, so long as
<PB N="224" REF="028060_0210_0FD68BD4E695DE60"/>I was <HI>in the Flesh,</HI> in my natural State, and pur∣sued it only by <HI>fleshly,</HI> natural <HI>Wisdom.</HI></P>
<P>And yet surely, if any Man could, <HI>Paul</HI> him∣self might have attained thereto by that Wisdom. For we can hardly conceive any, who was more highly favoured with all the Gifts both of Nature and Education. Besides his natural Abilities, pro∣bably not inferior to those of any Person then upon the Earth, he had all the Benefits of Learn∣ing, studying at the University of <HI>Tarsus,</HI> after∣wards brought up at the Feet of <HI>Gamaliel,</HI> a Person of the greatest Account both for Know∣ledge and Integrity, that was then in the whole <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation. And he had all the possible Ad∣vantages of Religious Education, being a Pharisee, the Son of a Pharisee, trained up in the very straitest Sect or Profession, distinguished from all others by a more eminent Strictness. And here∣in he had <HI>profited above many</HI> others, <HI>who were his Equals in Years, being more abundantly zealous</HI> of whatever he Thought would please God, and <HI>as touching the Righteousness of the Law blameless.</HI> But it could not be, that he should hereby attain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Simplicity and godly Sincerity. It was all but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Labour; in a deep, piercing Sense of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ength constrained to cry out, <HI>The Things which were Gain to me, those I counted Loss for Christ. Yea doubtless, and I count all Things but Loss for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.</HI> Phil. iii. 7, 8.</P>
<P N="15">15. It could not be that ever he should attain to this, but by the <HI>excellent Knowledge of Jesus Christ,</HI> our Lord: Or <HI>by the Grace of</HI> God; another Expression of nearly the same Import. By <HI>the Grace of</HI> God is sometimes to be under∣stood,
<PB N="225" REF="028060_0211_0FD68BD8BB30E0B8"/>that free Love, that unmerited Mercy, by which I a Sinner, thro' the Merits of Christ, am now reconciled to God. But in this Place it ra∣ther means, that Power of God the Holy G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost, which <HI>worketh in us both to will and to do, of his good Pleasure.</HI> As soon as ever the Grace of God, in the former Sense, his pardoning Love is manifested to our Soul, the Grace of God, in the latter Sense, the Power of his Spirit, takes Place therein. And now we can perform, thro' God, what to Man was impossible. Now we can order our Conversation aright. We can do all Things in the Light and Power of that Love, thro' Christ which strengtheneth us. We now have <HI>the Testimony of our Conscience,</HI> which we could never have by fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shly Wisdom, <HI>that in Sim∣plicity and godly Sincerity we have our Conversation in the World.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. This is properly the Ground of a Chris∣tian's Joy. We may now therefore readily con∣ceive, How he that hath this Testimony in him∣self, <HI>rejoiceth evermore. My Soul,</HI> may he say, <HI>doth magnify the Lord and my Spirit rejoiceth in</HI> God <HI>my Saviour.</HI> I rejoice in him, who of his own unmerited Love, of his own free and tender Mercy, <HI>hath called me into this State of Salvation,</HI> wherein thro' his Power I now stand. I rejoice because his Spirit beareth witness, to my Spirit, that I am bought with the Blood of the Lamb, and that believing in him, "I am a Member of Christ, a Child of God, and an Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven." I rejoice because the Sense of God's Love to me, hath by the same Spirit wrought in me to love him, and to love for his Sake every Child of Man, every Soul that
<PB N="226" REF="028060_0212_0FD68BDBE8507710"/>he hath made. I rejoice, because he gives me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o feel in myself <HI>the Mind that was in Christ:</HI> Sim∣plicity, a single Eye to him, in every Motion of my Heart; Power always to fix the loving Eye of my Soul on him who <HI>loved me, and gave him∣self for me,</HI> to aim at him alone, at his glorious Will, in all I think or speak or do: Purity, de∣siring nothing more but God, <HI>crucifying the Flesh with its Affections and Lusts, setting my Affections on Things above, not on Things of the Earth:</HI> Ho∣liness, a Recovery of the Image of God, a Re∣newal of Soul after his Likeness: and godly Sin∣cerity, directing all my Words and Works, so as to conduce to his Glory. In this I likewise re∣joice, yea and will rejoice, because my Conscience beareth me witness in the Holy Ghost, by the Light he continually pours in upon it, that I <HI>walk worthy of the Vocation wherewith</HI> I am <HI>called;</HI> that I <HI>abstain from all Appearance of Evil, fleeing from Sin as from the Face of a Serpent;</HI> that as I have Opportunity, I do all possible Good, in every kind, to all Men; that I follow my Lord in all my Steps, and do what is acceptable in his sight. I rejoice because I both see and feel, through the Inspiration of God's Holy Spirit, that all my Works are wrought in him, yea and that it is he who worketh all my Works in me. I rejoice in seeing, thro' the Light of God which shines in my Heart, that I have Power to walk in his Ways, and that thro' his Grace, I turn not therefrom, to the Right Hand or to the Left.</P>
<P N="17">17. Such is the Ground and the Nature of that Joy, whereby a Christian rejoiceth ever∣more. And from all this we may easily infer, First. That this is not a <HI>natural</HI> Joy. It does
<PB N="227" REF="028060_0213_0FD68BDDD333BDB0"/>not arise from any natural Cause: Not from any sudden Flow of Spirits. This may give a tran∣sient Start of Joy. But the Christian <HI>rejoiceth al∣ways.</HI> It cannot be owing to bodily Health or Ease; to Strength and Soundness of Constitution. For it is equally strong in Sickness and Pain; yea perhaps far stronger than before. Many Chris∣tians have never experienced any Joy, to be com∣pared with that which then silled their Soul, when the Body was well nigh worn out with Pain, or consumed away with pining Sickness. Least of all can it be ascribed to outward Prosperity, to the Favour of Men, or Plenty of worldly Goods. For then chiefly, when their Faith has been tried as with Fire, by all Manner of outward Afflic∣tions, have the Children of God rejoiced in him, <HI>whom unseen they loved,</HI> even <HI>with Joy un∣speakable.</HI> And never surely did Men rejoice like those, who were used as <HI>the Filth and off scouring of the World;</HI> who wandered to and two, being in want of all Things; in Hunger, in Cold, in Nakedness: Who <HI>had Trials,</HI> not only <HI>of cru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Mockings,</HI> but <HI>moreover of Bouds and Imprison∣ments:</HI> Yea, who at last <HI>counted not their Lives dear unto themselves, so</HI> they <HI>might finish their Course with Joy.</HI></P>
<P N="18">18. From the preceding Considerations, we may, Secondly, infer, That the Joy of a Chris∣tian does not arise from any <HI>Blindness of Con∣science,</HI> from his not being able to discern Good from Evil. So far from it, that he was an utter Stranger to this Joy, till the Eyes of his Under∣standing were opened! that he knew it not, un∣til he had Spiritual Senses, fitted to discern spiri∣tual Good and Evil. And now the Eye of his
<PB N="228" REF="028060_0214_0FD68BDFC9F41880"/>Soul waxeth not dim. He was never so sharp-sighted before. He has so quick a Perception of the smallest Things, as is quite amazing to the natural Man. As a Mote is visible in the Sar∣beam, so to him who is walking in the Light, in the Beams of the uncreated Sun, every Mote of Sin is visible. Nor does he close the Eyes of his Conscience any more. That Sleep is departed from him. His Soul is always bread awake; No more Slumber or folding of the Hands to Rest! He is always standing on the Tower, and heark∣ning what his Lord will say concerning him: And always rejoicing in this very Thing, in <HI>seeing him that is invisible.</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. Neither does the Joy of a Christian arise, Thirdly, from any <HI>Dulness</HI> or <HI>Callousness of Con∣science.</HI> A Kind of Joy, it is true, may arise from this, in those whose <HI>foolish Hearts are darken∣ed;</HI> whose Heart is callous, unfeeling, dull of Sense; and consequently, without spiritual Under∣standing, Because of their senseless, unseeling Hearts, they may rejoice even in committing Sin: And this they may probably call <HI>Liberty!</HI> Which is indeed more Drunkenness of Soul: A fatal Numbness of Spirit, the stupid Insensibility of a seared Conscience. On the contrary, a Christian has the most exquisite Sensibility; such as he could not have conceived before. He never had such a Tenderness of Conscience as he has had, since the Love of God has reigned in his Heart. And this also is his Glory and Joy; that God hath heard his daily Prayer,
<Q><L>"O that my tender Soul might fly</L>
<L>The first, abhorr'd Approach of Ill:</L>
<L>Quick, as the Apple of an Eye</L>
<L>The slightest Touch of Sin to feel."</L></Q></P>
<P N="20"><PB N="229" REF="028060_0215_0FD68BE1079A3678"/>
20. To conclude. Christian Joy, is Joy in Obedience: Joy in loving God and keeping his Commandments. And yet not in keeping them, as if we were thereby to fulfil the Terms of the <HI>Covenant of Works;</HI> as if by any Works or Righ∣teousness of ours, we were to <HI>procure</HI> Pardon and Acceptance with God. Not so: We are already pardoned and accepted, thro' the Mercy of God in Christ Jesus—Not as if we were by our own Obedience to <HI>procure</HI> Life, Life from the Death of Sin. This also we have already thro' the Grace of God. <HI>Us hath he quickened, who were dead in Sin.</HI> And now we are <HI>alive to</HI> God, <HI>thro' Jesus Christ our Lord.</HI> But we rejoice in knowing, That <HI>being justified thro' his Grace,</HI> we have <HI>not received that Grace of</HI> God <HI>in vain;</HI> That God having freely (not for the Sake of our willing or running, but through the Blood of the Lamb) reconciled us to himself, we run in the Strength which he hath given us, the Way of his Commandments. He hath <HI>girded us with Strength unto the War,</HI> and we gladly <HI>fight the good Fight of Faith.</HI> We rejoice, thro' him who liveth in our Hearts by Faith, to <HI>lay hold of eter∣nal Life.</HI> This is our Rejoicing: that as our <HI>Father worketh hitherto,</HI> so (not by our own Might or Wisdom, but through the Power of his Spirit freely given in Christ Jesus) we also work the Works of God. And may he work in us, what∣soever is well-pleasing in his Sight! To whom be the Praise for ever and ever!</P>

<PB N="233" REF="028060_0217_0FD68BE631563BD8"/>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>MALACHI iii. 7.</BIBL>
<P><HI>Ye are gone away from mine Ordinances, and have not kept them.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. BUT are there any <HI>Ordinances</HI> now, since Life and Immortality were brought to Light by the Gospel? Are there under the Chris∣tian Dispensation, any <HI>Means</HI> ordained of God, as the usual Channels of his Grace? This Question could never have been proposed, in the Apostoli∣cal Church, unless by one who openly avowe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> himself to be an Heathen; the whole Body of Christi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> being agreed, that Christ had ordained certain outward Means, for conveying his Grace into the Souls of Men. Their constant Practice set this beyond all Dispute; for so long as <HI>all that believed were together, and had all Things common,</HI> (Acts ii. 44.) <HI>they continued stedfastly in the traching of the Apostles, and in the breaking of Bread and in Prayers,</HI> ver. 42.</P>
<P N="2">2. But in Process of time, when <HI>the Love of many waxed cold,</HI> some began to mistake the <HI>Means</HI> for the <HI>End,</HI> and to place Religion, rather in doing those outward Works, than in a Heart renewed after the Image of God. They forgot, that <HI>the End of</HI> every <HI>Commandment is Love, out of a pure Heart, with Faith unfeigned:</HI> The
<PB N="234" REF="028060_0218_0FD68BE914C60DE0"/>loving the Lord their God with all their Heart, and their Neighbour as themselves; and the be∣ing purified from Pride, Anger, and evil Desires, by a <HI>Faith of the Operation of</HI> God. Others seemed to imagine, that tho' Religion did not principally consist in these outward Means, yet there was something in them where with God was well pleased, something that would still make them acceptable in his Sight, tho' they were not exact in the weightier Matters of the Law, in Justice, Mercy, and the Love of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is evident, in those who abused them thus, they did not conduce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the End for which they were ordained. Rather, the Things which should have been for their Health, were to them an Occasion of falling. They were so far from receiving any Blessing therein, that they only drew down a Curse upon their Head: so far from growing more heavenly in Heart and Life, that they were twofold more the Children of Hell than before. Others clearly perceiving, that these Means did not convey the Grace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God to those Children of the Devil, began from this particular Case to draw a General Conclusion, "That they were not Means of conveying the Grace of God."</P>
<P N="4">4. Yet the Number of those who <HI>abused</HI> the Ordinances of God, was far greater than of those who <HI>despised</HI> them, till certain Men arose, not only or great understanding, (sometimes joined with considerable Learning) but who likewise ap∣peared to be Men of Love, experimentally ac∣quainted with true, Inward Religion. Some of these were burning and shining Lights, Persons famous in their Generations, and such as had
<PB N="235" REF="028060_0219_0FD68BEC552A51D8"/>well deserved of the Church of Christ, for stand∣ing in the Gap against the Overflowing of Un∣godliness.</P>
<P>It cannot be supposed, that these holy and ve∣nerable Men, intended any more at first, than to shew that Outward Religion is nothing worth, without the Religion of the Heart: That God <HI>is a Spirit, and they who worship him, must wor∣ship him in Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it and in Truth:</HI> That therefore external Worship is lost Labour, withou a Heart devoted to God: That the Outward Ordinances of God then profit much, when they advance Inward Holiness, but when they advance it not, are unprofitable and void, are lighter than Vanity: Yea, that when they are used, as it were, <HI>in the Place</HI> of This, they are an utter Abomination to the Lord.</P>
<P N="5">5. Yet it is not strange, if some of these, be∣ing strongly convinced, of that horrid Prosana∣tion of the Ordinances of God, which had spread itself over the whole Church, and well nigh driven True Religion out of the World; in their fervent Zeal for the Glory of God, and the Re∣covery of Souls; from that fatal Delusion, spake as if Outward Religion were <HI>absolutely nothing,</HI> as if it had <HI>no</HI> Place in the Religion of Christ. It is not surprizing at all, if they should not always have expressed themselves with sufficent Caution. So that unwary Hearers might believe, they con∣demned all Outward Means, as altogether un∣profitable; and as not designed of God to be the Ordinary Channels of conveying his Grace into the Souls of Men.</P>
<P>Nay, it is not impossible, some of these holy Men did at length themselves fall into this Opi∣nion:
<PB N="236" REF="028060_0220_0FD68BF0F0C2CDA8"/>In particular, those who, not by Choice, but by the Providence of God, were out off from all these Ordinances: Perhaps wandering up and down, having no certain Abiding-place, or dwelling in Dens and Caves of the Earth. These experiencing the Grace of God in themselves, tho' they were deprived of all Outward Means, might infer, that the same Grace would be given to them, who of set Purpose abstained from them.</P>
<P N="6">6. And Experience shews, how easily this No∣tion spreads, and insinuates itself into the Minds of Men: Especially of those who are thoroughly awakened out of the Sleep of Death, and begin to feel the Weight of their Sins, a Burthen too heavy to be born. These are usually impatient of their present State, and trying every Way to escape from it. They are always ready to catch at any new Thing, any new Proposal of Ease or Happiness. They have probably tried most Outward Means, and found no Ease in Them: It may be, more and more of Remorse and Fear, and Sorrow and Condemnation. It is easy there∣fore to persuade these, That it is better for them to abstain from all those Means. They are al∣ready weary of striving (as it seems) in vain, of labouring in the Fire: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d are therefore glad of any Pretence to east aside that, wherein their Soul has no Pleasure; to give over the painful Strife, and sink down into an indolent Inactivity.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. In the following Discourse, I propose to examine at large. Whether there are any Means of Grace?</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="028060_0221_0FD68BF22321BE70"/>
By <HI>Means of Grace</HI> I understand, Outward Signs, Words or Actions, ordained of God, and appointed for this End, to be the <HI>Ordinary</HI> Chan∣nels whereby he might convey to Men, prevent∣ing, justifying or sanctifying Grace.</P>
<P>I use this Expression, "Means of Grace," be∣cause I know none better, and because it has been generally used in the Christian Church for many Ages: In particular, by our own Church, which directs us to bless God, both for the "<HI>Means of Grace</HI> and Hope of Glory;" and teaches us that a Sacrament is "An Outward Sign of In∣ward <HI>Grace,</HI> and a <HI>Means</HI> whereby we receive the same."</P>
<P>The Chief of these Means are Prayer, whe∣ther in secret, or with the great Congregation; searching the Scriptures (which implies Reading, Hearing and meditating thereon) and receiving the Lord's Supper, eating Bread and drinking Wine in Remembrance of him; and these we believe to be ordained of God, as the ordinary Channels of conveying his Grace to the Souls of Men.</P>
<P N="2">2. But we allow, That the whole Value of the Means depends on their actual Subservience to the End of Religion; that consequently all these Means, when separate from the End, are less than Nothing and Vanity; That if they do not actually conduce to the Knowledge and Love of God, they are not acceptable in his Sight; yea, rather, they are an Abomination before him; a Stink in his Nostrils; he is weary to bear them, Above all, if they are used as a kind of <HI>Commu∣nion</HI> for the Religion they were designed to subserve. It is not easy to find Words for the
<PB N="238" REF="028060_0222_0FD68BF40EECB978"/>enormous Folly and Wickedness, of thus turn∣ing God's Arms against himself; of keeping Christianity out of the Heart by those very Means, which were ordained for the bringing it in.</P>
<P N="3">3. We allow likewise, that all Outward Means whatever, if separate from the Spirit of God, cannot profit at all, cannot conduce in any De∣gree either to the Knowledge or Love of God. Without Controversy, the Help that is done up∣on Earth, he doth it himself. It is He alone, who by his own Almighty Power, worketh in us what is pleasing in his Sight. And all out∣ward Things, unless he work in them and by them, are mere weak and beggarly Elements. Whosoever therefore imagines, there is any In∣trinsic <HI>Power,</HI> in any Means whatsoever, does greatly err, not knowing the Scriptures, neither the Power of God. We know that there is no inherent Power, in the Words that are spoken in Prayer; in the Letter of Scripture read, the Sound thereof heard, or the Bread and Wine received in the Lord's Supper: But that it is God alone who is the Giver of every good Gift, the Author of all Grace; that the whole Power is of him whereby thro' any of these, there is any Blessing conveyed to our Soul. We know like∣wise, that he is able to give the same Grace, tho' there were no Means on the Face of the Earth. In this Sense we may affirm, that "with Regard to God, there is no such Thing as Means:" Seeing he is equally able to work whatsoever pleaseth him, by Any, or by None at all.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="239" REF="028060_0223_0FD68BF5313C4368"/>
4. We allow farther, That the Use of all Means whatever, will never atone for one Sin; That it is the Blood of Christ alone, whereby any Sinner can be reconciled to God; there be∣ing no other Propitiation for our Sins, no other Fountain for Sin and Uncleanness. Every Be∣liever in Christ is deeply convinced, that there is no <HI>Merit,</HI> but in Him: That there is no <HI>Merit</HI> in any of his own Works; not in uttering the Prayer, or searching the Scripture, or hearing the Word of God, or eating of that Bread and drinking of that Cup. So that if no more be intended by the Expression some have used, "Christ is the only Means of Grace," than this, That he is the only <HI>Meritorious Cause</HI> of it, it cannot be gain-said by any who know the Grace of God.</P>
<P N="5">5. Yet once more. We allow (tho' it is a melancholy Truth) that a large Proportion of those who are called Christians, do to this Day abuse the Means of Grace, to the Destruction of their Souls. This is doubtless the Case with all those who rest content, in the Form of Godli∣ness without the Power. Either they fondly pre∣sume, they are Christians already, because they do thus and thus; altho' Christ was never yet re∣vealed in their Hearts, nor the Love of God shed abroad therein: Or else they suppose, They shall infallibly be so, barely because they use these Means: Idly dreaming (tho' perhaps hardly con∣scious thereof) either that there is some Kind of <HI>Power</HI> therein, whereby sooner or later (they know not when) they shall certainly be made Holy: Or that there is a Sort of <HI>Merit</HI> in using
<PB N="240" REF="028060_0224_0FD68BF696987450"/>them, which will surely move God to give them Holiness, or accept them without it.</P>
<P N="6">6. So little do they understand that great Foundation of the whole Christian Building, <HI>By Grace ye are saved.</HI> Ye are saved from your Sins, from the Guilt and Power thereof, ye are restored to the Favour and Image of God, not for any Works, <HI>Merits</HI> or Deservings of yours, but by the free <HI>Grace,</HI> the mere mercy of God, thro' the <HI>Merits</HI> of his well-beloved Son. Ye are thus saved, not by any <HI>Power,</HI> Wisdom or Strength, which is in you, or in any other Crea∣ture: but merely thro' the Grace or <HI>Power</HI> of the Holy Ghost, which worketh all in all.</P>
<P N="7">7. But the main Question remains. We know this Salvation is the Gift and the Work of God. But how (may one say, who is convinced he hath it not) may I attain thereto? If you say, "Believe, and thou shalt be saved:" He an∣swers, True; but how shall I believe? You re∣ply, W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it upon God.—Well. But how am I to wait? In the Means of Grace, or out of them? Am I to wait for the Grace of God which bringeth Salvation, by using these Means, or by laying them aside?</P>
<P N="8">8. It cannot possibly be conceived, that the Word of God should give no Direction in so important a Point: Or that the Son of God, who came down from Heaven for us Men and for our Salvation, should have left us undeter∣mined with regard to a Question, wherein our Salvation is so nearly concerned.</P>
<P>And in Fact, he hath not lest us undetermined; he hath shewn us the Way wherein we should go. We have only to consult the Oracles of
<PB N="241" REF="028060_0225_0FD68BFC9D78A1C8"/>God, to inquire what is written there? And if we simply abide by their Decision, there can no possible Doubt remain.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. According to this, according to the Decision of Holy Writ, all who desire the Grace of God, are to wait for it, in the Means which he hath ordained; in using, not in laying them aside.</P>
<P>And first: All who desire the Grace of God, are to wait for it in the Way of <HI>Prayer.</HI> This is the express Direction of our Lord himself. In his Sermon upon the Mount, after explaining at large wherein Religion consists, and describing the main Branches of it, he adds, <Q>Ask and it shall be given you, seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh re∣ceiveth, and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.</Q> (<HI>Matth.</HI> vii. 7, 8.) Here we are in the plainest Manner directed to ask, in order to, or as a <HI>Means</HI> of receiving; to seek in order to find, the Grace of God, the Pearl of great Price; and to knock, to con∣tinue asking and seeking, if we would enter in∣to his Kingdom.</P>
<P N="2">2. That no Doubt might remain, our Lord labours this Point in a more peculiar Manner. He appeals to every Man's own Heart. <Q>What Man is there of you, who if his Son ask Bread, will give him a Stone? Or if he ask a Fish, will he give him a Serpent? If ye then being evil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ow how to give good Gifts unto your Children, how much more shall your Father which is in Heaven,</Q> the Father of Angels and Men, the Father of the
<PB N="242" REF="028060_0226_0FD68BFF9E908238"/>Spirits of all Flesh, <HI>give good Things to them that ask him?</HI> ver. 9, 10, 11. Or, as he expresses himself on another Occasion, including all good things in one, <HI>How much more shall your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him? Luke</HI> xi. 13. It should be particularly observed here, that the Persons directed to ask, had not then received the Holy Spirit. Nevertheless our Lord directs them to use this Means, and pro∣mises that it should be effectual; that upon ask∣ing they should receive the Holy Spirit, from him whose Mercy is over all his Works.</P>
<P N="3">3. The absolute Necessity of using this Means, if we would receive any Gift from God, yet farther appears from that remarkable Passage which immediately precedes these Words: <Q>And he said unto them</Q> (whom he had just been teach∣ing, how to pray) <Q>which of you shall have a Friend, and shall go unto him at Midnight, and shall say unto him, Friend, lend me three Loaves— and he from within shall answer, Trouble me not —I cannot rise and give thee: I say unto you, though he will not rise and give him, because he is his Friend, yet because of his Importunity he will rise, and give him as many as he needeth. And I say unto you, ask and it shall be given you,</Q> Luke xi. 5, 7, 8, 9. <Q>Though he will not give him, because he is his Friend, yet because of his Im∣portunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.</Q> How could our blessed Lord more plainly declare, That we may receive of God, by this Means, by importunately asking, what otherwise we should not receive at all.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="243" REF="028060_0227_0FD68BFFA470ACA0"/>
4. <HI>He spake also another Parable to this End, that Men ought always to pray, and not to faint,</HI> 'till through this Means they should receive of God, whatsoever Petition they asked of him. <Q>There was in a city a Judge which feared not God, neither regarded Man. And there was a Widow in that City, and she came unto him, say∣ing, Avenge me of my Adversary. And he would not for a while; but afterwards he said with him∣self, Though I fear not God, nor regard Man, yet because this Widow troubleth me I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.</Q> Luke xviii 1—4. The Application of this our Lord himself hath made. <HI>Hear what the unjust Judge saith!</HI> Because she continues to ask, be∣cause the will take no Denial, therefore I will a∣venge her. <HI>And shall not</HI> God <HI>avenge his own Elect, which cry Day and Night unto him? I tell you be will avenge them speedily</HI>—if they <HI>pray and faint not.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. A Direction equally full and express, to wait for the Blessings of God in private Prayer, together with a positive Promise, that by this Means we shall obtain the Request of our Lips, he hath given us in those well-known Words: <Q>Enter into thy Closet, and when thou hast shut thy Door, pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly,</Q> Matth. vi. 6.</P>
<P N="6">6. If it be possible for any Direction to be more clear, it is that which God hath given us by the Apostle, with regard to Prayer of every Kind, public or private, and the Blessings annext thereto. <HI>If any of you lack Wisdom, let him ask
<PB N="244" REF="028060_0228_0FD68C01151BC348"/>of</HI> God, <HI>that giveth to all Men liberally,</HI> (if they ask; otherwise <HI>ye have not, because ye ask not,</HI> Jam. iv. 2.) <HI>and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him,</HI> ch. i. 5.</P>
<P>If it be objected, "But this is no Direction to Unbelievers; to them who know not the par∣doning Grace of God: For the Apostle adds, <HI>But let him ask in Faith:</HI> otherwise, <HI>let him not think that he shall receive any Thing of the Lord."</HI> I answer, The Meaning of the Word <HI>Faith</HI> in this Place is fixed by the Apostle himself, (as if it were on purpose to obviate this Objection) in the Words immediately following: <HI>Let him ask in Faith, nothing wavering,</HI> nothing <HI>doubting,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Not doubting but God hear∣eth his Prayer, and will fulfil the Desire of his Heart.</P>
<P>The gross, blasphemous Absurdity of suppos∣ing <HI>Faith</HI> in this Place to be taken in the full Christian Meaning, appears hence: It is suppos∣ing the Holy Ghost to direct a Man who knows he hath not this Faith, (which is here termed <HI>Wis∣dom</HI>) to ask it of God, with a positive Promise that <HI>it shall be given him;</HI> and then immediately to subjoin, That it shall not be given him, un∣less he have it before he asks for it! But who can bear such a Supposition; from this Scrip∣ture, therefore, as well as those cited above, we must infer, that all who desire the Grace of God, are to wait for it in the Way of Prayer.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Secondly,</HI> All who desire the Grace of God, are to wait for it in <HI>searching the Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>Our Lord's Direction with regard to the Use of this Means, is likewise plain and clear. <HI>Search
<PB N="245" REF="028060_0229_0FD68C029A565710"/>the Scriptures,</HI> faith he to the unbelieving <HI>Jews, —for they testify of me,</HI> John v. 39. And for this very End did he direct them to search the Scriptures, that they might <HI>believe in him.</HI></P>
<P>The Objection, "That this is not a Command, but only an Assertion, that they did search the Scriptures," is shamelesly false. I desire those who urge it, to let us know, how a Command can be more clearly expressed, than in those Terms, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. It is as peremptory as so many Words can make it.</P>
<P>And what a Blessing from God attends the Use of this Means, appears from what is record∣ed concerning the <HI>Bereans;</HI> who after hearing St. <HI>Paul, searched the Scriptures daily, whether those Things were so? Therefore many of them be∣lieved;</HI> found the Grace of God, in the Way which he had ordained. <HI>Acts</HI> xvii. 12, 13.</P>
<P>It is probable, indeed, that in some of those who had <HI>received the Word with all Readiness of Mind, Faith came</HI> (as the same Apostle speaks) <HI>by hearing,</HI> and was only confirmed by <HI>reading</HI> the Scriptures. But it was observed above, that under the general Term of <HI>searching the Scrip∣tures,</HI> both Hearing, Reading, and Meditating, are contained.</P>
<P N="8">8. And that this is a Means whereby God not only gives, but also confirms and increases true Wisdom, we learn from the Words of St. <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy: From a Child thou hast known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto Salvation, thro' Faith which is in Christ Jesus,</HI> 2. Tim. iii. 15. The same Truth (namely, that this is the great Means God has ordained for
<PB N="246" REF="028060_0230_0FD68C0A5D6FA8E8"/>conveying his manifold Grace to Man) is deli∣vered, in the fullest Manner that can be con∣ceived, in the Words which immediately follow: <HI>All Scripture is given by Inspiration of</HI> God; (consequently, all Scripture is infallibly true;) <HI>and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness: To the End that the Man of GOD may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good Works,</HI> ver. 16, 17.</P>
<P N="9">9. It should be observed, that this is spoken primarily and directly, of the Scriptures which <HI>Timothy</HI> had <HI>known from a Child;</HI> which must have been those of the Old Testament, for the New was not then wrote. How far then was St. <HI>Paul</HI> (though he was <HI>not a whit behind the very Chief of the Apostles,</HI> not therefore, I pre∣sume, behind any Man now upon Earth) from making light of the Old Testament! Behold this, lest ye one Day <HI>wonder and perish,</HI> ye who make so small Account of one Half of the Oracles of God! Yea, and that Half of which the Holy Ghost expressly declares, That it is <HI>profitable,</HI> as a Means ordained of God, for this very Thing, <HI>for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for In∣struction in Righteousness: To the End the Man of GOD may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good Works.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. Nor is this prositable only for the Men of God, for those who walk already in the Light of his Countenance; but also for those who are yet in Darkness, seeking him whom they know not. Thus St. <HI>Peter, We have also a more sure Word of Prophecy:</HI> (Literally, <HI>and we
<PB N="247" REF="028060_0231_0FD68C0C6AEDD288"/>have the prophetic Word more sure:</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, confirmed by our being <HI>Eye witnesses of his Majesty,</HI> and <HI>hearing the Voice which came from the Excellent Glory) unto which</HI> (prophetic Word; so he stiles the holy Scriptures) <HI>ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a Light that shineth in a dark Place, until the Day down, and the Day star arise in your Hearts,</HI> 2 Pet. i. 19. Let all, therefore, who desire that Day to dawn upon their Hearts, wait for it in <HI>searching the Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> All who desire an Increase of the Grace of God, are to wait for it in partaking of the Lord's Supper. For this also is a Direction himself hath given. <Q>The same Night in which he was betrayed, he took Bread, and brake it, and said, Take, eat:</Q> This is my Body (that is, the sacred Sign of my Body) <Q>This do in Remembrance of me. Likewise, he took the Cup, saying, This Cup is the New Testament, or <HI>Covenant,</HI> in my Blood, (the sacred sign of that Covenant) this do ye, in Remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do shew forth the Lord's Death till he come,</Q> 2 Cor. xi. 23, &amp;c. Ye openly exhibit the same, by these visible Signs, before God, and Angels, and Men. Ye manifest your solemn Remembrance of his Death, till he cometh in the Clouds of Heaven.</P>
<P>Only <HI>let a Man</HI> first <HI>examine himself,</HI> whether he understands the Nature and Design of this holy Institution, and whether he really desire to be himself made conformable to the Death of
<PB N="248" REF="028060_0232_0FD68C0DD5FA7318"/>Christ: <HI>and so,</HI> nothing doubting, <HI>let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup,</HI> ver. 28.</P>
<P>Here then the Direction first given by our Lord, is expresly repeated by the Apostle. Let him eat; let him drink: (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> both in the Imperative Mood.) Words not implying a bare Permission only, but a clear explicit Com∣mand; a Command to all those, either who al∣ready are filled with Peace and Joy in believing, or who can truly say, "The Remembrance of our Sins is grievous unto us, the Burden of them is intolerable."</P>
<P N="12">12. And that this is also an ordinary stated Means of receiving the Grace of God, is evi∣dent from those Words of the Apostle, which occur in the preceding Chapter. <Q>The Cup of Blessing which we bless, is it not the Communion, <HI>or Communication,</HI> of the Blood of Christ? The Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Christ?</Q> (1 Cor. x. 16.) Is not the eating of that Bread, and the drinking of that Cup, the outward, visible Means, whereby God conveys into our Souls all that Spiritual Grace, that Righteousness, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost, which were purchased by the Body of Christ once broken, and the Blood of Christ once shed for us? Let all, therefore, who truly desire the Grace of God, eat of that Bread and drink of that Cup.</P>
<P N="4">IV. 1. But as plainly as God hath pointed out the Way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nerein he will be inquired after, innumerable are the Objections which Men,
<PB N="249" REF="028060_0233_0FD68C0F68061030"/>wise in their own Eyes, have from Time to Time raised against it. It may be needful to consider a few of these; not because they are of Weight in themselves, but because they have so often been used, especially of late Years, to turn the Lame out of the Way; yea, to trouble and subvert those who did run well, till Satan appeared as an Angel of Light.</P>
<P>The first and Chief of these is, "You can∣not use these Means (as you call them) without <HI>trusting</HI> in them." I pray, where is this written? I expect you should shew me plain Scripture for your Assertion. Otherwise I dare not receive it: Because I am not convinced, that you are wiser than God.</P>
<P>If it really had been as you assert, it is certain Christ must have known it. And if he had known it, he would surely have warned us, he would have revealed it long ago. Therefore be∣cause he has not, because there is no Tittle of this in the whole Revelation of Jesus Christ, I am as fully assured your Assertion is false, as that this Revelation is of God.</P>
<P>"However, leave them off for a short Time, to see whether you trusted in them or no." So I am to disobey God, in order to know, whether I trust in obeying him! And do you avow this Advice? Do you deliberately teach, to <HI>do Evil that Good may come?</HI> O tremble at the Sentence of God against such Teachers! Their <HI>Damna∣tion is just.</HI></P>
<P>"Nay, if you are troubled, when you leave them off, it is plain, you trusted in them." By no means. If I am troubled when I wilfully dis∣obey God, it is plain his Spirit is still stroving
<PB N="250" REF="028060_0234_0FD68C161864B0A0"/>with me. But if I am not troubled at wilful Sin, it is plain, I am given up to a reprobate Mind.</P>
<P>But what do you mean by "<HI>Trusting</HI> in them?" Looking for the Blessing of God therein? Be∣lieving, that If I wait in this Way I shall attain, what otherwise I should not? So I do. And so I will, God being my Helper, even to my Life's End. By the Grace of God, I will <HI>thus</HI> trust in them, till the Day of my Death; that is, I will believe that whatever God hath promised, he is faithfull <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to perform. And seeing he hath promised to bless me in this Way, I <HI>trust</HI> it shall be according to his Word.</P>
<P N="2">2. It has been, secondly, objected, "This is seeking Salvation by Works." Do you know the Meaning of the Expression you use? What is, "seeking Salvation by Works?" In the Writ∣ings of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> it means, either seeking to be saved by observing the ritual Works of the Mosaic Law, or expecting Salvation for the Sake of our own Works, by the Merit of our own Righteous∣ness. But how is either of these implied, in my waiting in the Way God has ordained, and ex∣pecting that he will meet me there, because he has promised so to do?</P>
<P>I do expect, that he will fulfil his Word, that he will meet and bless me in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Yet not for the Sake of any Works which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have done, nor for the Merit of my Righteousness: But mere∣ly through the Merits and Sufferings and Love of his Son, in whom he is always well-pleased.</P>
<P N="3">3. It has been vehemently objected. Thirdly, "that Christ is the only Means of Grace." I an∣swer, this is mere playing upon Words. Explain your Term, and the Objection vanishes away.
<PB REF="028060_0235_0FD68C1AB1BDA480"/>
<PB N="251" REF="028060_0236_0FD68C1796F53A50"/>When we say, "Prayer is a Means of Grace," we understand, a Channel through which the Grace of God is conveyed. When you say, "Christ is the Means of Grace," you under∣stand, the sole Price and Purchaser of it: Or, that <HI>no Man cometh unto the Father, but thro' him.</HI> And who denies it? But this us utterly wide of the Question.</P>
<P N="4">4. But does not the Scripture (it has been ob∣jected, Fourthly) direct us to <HI>wait</HI> for Salvation? Does not <HI>David</HI> say, <HI>My Soul waiteth upon GOD: for of him cometh my Salvation?</HI> And does not <HI>Isaiah</HI> teach us the same Thing, saying, <HI>O Lord, we have waited for thee?</HI> All this cannot be de∣nied. Seeing it is the Gift of God, we are un∣doubtedly to <HI>wait</HI> on him for Salvation. But how shall we wait i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> If God himself has appoint∣ed a Way, can you find a better Way of waiting for him? But, that he hath appointed a Way, hath been shewn at large, and also what that Way is. The very Words of the Prophet which you cite, put this out of all Question. For the whole Sentence runs thus: <HI>In the Way of thy Judgments,</HI> or Ordinances, <HI>O Lord, have we waited for thee. (Isai.</HI> xxvi. 8.) And in the very same Way did <HI>David</HI> wait, as his own Words abundatly testify: <HI>I have waited for thy saving Health, O Lord, and have kept thy Law. Teach me, O Lord, the Way of thy Statutes, and I shall keep it unto the End.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. "Yea, say some, but God has appointed another Way, <HI>stand still and see the Salvation of GOD.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="028060_0237_0FD68C1CDA50CD18"/>
Let us examine the Scriptures to which you refer. The first of them, with the Context, runs thus:</P>
<P><Q>And when Pharoah drew nigh, the Children of Israel lift up their Eyes—and they were sore afraid. And they said unto Moses, Because there were no Graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the Wilderness? And Moses said unto the People, Fear ye not: Stand still, and see the Salvation of the Lord. And the Lord said unto Moses, speak unto the Children of Israel, that they go forward. But lift thou up thy Rod, and stretch out thine Hand over the Sea and di∣vide it. And the Children of Israel shall go on dry Ground through the Midst of the Sea, Exod. xiv, 10, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>This was the <HI>Salvation</HI> of God, which they <HI>stood still</HI> to see, by <HI>marching forward</HI> with all their Might!</P>
<P>The other Passage wherein this Expression oc∣curs, stands thus. <Q>There came some that told Je∣hoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great Multitude against thee, from beyond the Sea. And Jehosha∣phat feared, and set himself to seek the Lord, and proclaimed a Fast throughout all Judah. And Ju∣dah gathered themselves together to ask Help of the Lord, even out of all the Cities they came to seek the Lord. And Jehoshaphat stood in the Congregation, in the House of the Lord—Then upon Jahaziel came the Spirit of the Lord—And he said—Be not dismayed by Reason of this great Multitude—To-morrow go ye down against them, ye shall not need to fight in this Battle. Set yourselves: Stand ye still, and see the Salva∣tion of the Lord—And they rose early in the Morning and went forth. And when they began
<PB N="253" REF="028060_0238_0FD68C22D9061CD8"/>to sing and to praise, the Lord set Ambushments against the Children of Moab, Ammon, and Mount Seir—and every one helped to destroy another, 2 Chron. xx. 2, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Such was the Salvation which the Children of <HI>Judah</HI> saw. But how does all this prove, that we ought not to wait for the Grace of God, in the Means which he hath ordained?</P>
<P N="6">6. I shall mention but one Objection more, which indeed does not properly belong to this Head. Nevertheless, because it has been so fre∣quently urged, I may not wholly pass it by.</P>
<P>"Does not St. <HI>Paul</HI> say, <HI>If ye be dead with Christ, why are ye subject to Ordinances? Col.</HI> ii. 20. Therefore a Christian, one that is <HI>dead with Christ,</HI> need not use the Ordinances any more."</P>
<P>So you say, "If I am a Christian, I am not subject to the Ordinances of Christ!" Surely, by the Absurdity of this, you must see at the first Glance, that the Ordinances here mentioned can∣not be the Ordinances of Christ! That they must needs be the <HI>Jewish</HI> Ordinances, to which it is certain, a Christian is no longer a Subject.</P>
<P>And the same undeniably appears from the Words immediately following, <HI>Touch not, taste not, handle not</HI>—all evidently referring to the an∣cient Ordinances of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Law.</P>
<P>So that this Objection is the weakest of all. And in Spight of all, that great Truth must stand unshaken, That all who desire the Grace of God, are to wait for it, in the Means which he hath ordained.</P>
<P N="5">V. 1. But this being allowed, that all who de∣sire the Grace of God, are to wait for it in the Means he hath ordained: It may still be enquired,
<PB N="254" REF="028060_0239_0FD68C23F7FE7900"/>how those Means should be used, both as to the <HI>Order,</HI> and the <HI>Manner</HI> of using them;</P>
<P>With regard to the former, we may observe, there is a Kind of Order, wherein God himself is generally pleased, to use these Means, in bring∣ing a Sinner to Salvation. A stupid, senseless Wretch is going on in his own Way, not having God in all his Thoughts, when God comes up∣on him unawares, perhaps by an awakening Ser∣mon or Conversation, perhaps by some awful Providence; or it may be by an immediate Stroke of his convincing Spirit, without any outward Means at all. Having now a Desire to flee from the Wrath to come, he purposely goes to <HI>hear,</HI> how it may be done. If he find a Preacher who speaks to the Heart, he is amazed, and begins <HI>searching the Scriptures,</HI> whether these Things are so? The more he <HI>hears</HI> and <HI>reads</HI> the more con∣vinced he is; and the more he <HI>meditates</HI> thereon, Day and Night. Perhaps he finds some other Book, which explains and inforces what he has heard and read in Scripture. And by all these Means, the Arrows of Conviction sink deeper into his Soul. He begins also to <HI>talk</HI> of the Things of God, which are ever uppermost in his Thoughts: Yea, and to talk with God, to <HI>pray</HI> to him, altho' through Fear and Shame, he scarce knows what to say. But whether he can speak or no, he cannot but pray, were it only in <HI>Grouns which cannot be uttered.</HI> Yet being in doubt, whether <HI>the high and lofty One that inha∣biteth Eternity</HI> will regard such a Sinner as him, he wants to pray with those who know God, with the Faithful, in the <HI>Great Congregation.</HI> But here he observes others go up to the <HI>Table of
<PB N="255" REF="028060_0240_0FD68C2610806D20"/>the Lord.</HI> He considers, Christ has said, "Do this!" How is it, that I do not! I am too great a Sinner. I am not fit. I am not worthy. After struggling with these Scruples a while, he breaks through. And thus he continues in God's Way, in hearing, reading, meditating, praying, and par∣taking of the Lord's Supper, till God, in the Man∣ner that pleases him, speaks to his Heart, <HI>Thy Faith hath saved thee! Go in Peace.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. By observing this Order of God, we may learn what Means to recommend to any particular Soul. If any of these will reach a stupid care∣less Sinner, it is probably <HI>Hearing</HI> or <HI>Conversation.</HI> To such therefore we might recommend those, if he has ever any Thought about Salvation. To one who begins to feel the Weight of his Sins, not only Hearing the Word of God, but <HI>Read∣ing</HI> it too, and perhaps other <HI>serious Books</HI> may be a Means of deeper Conviction. May you not advise him also, to <HI>meditate</HI> on what he reads, that it may have its full Force upon his Heart? Yea, and to <HI>speak</HI> thereof and not be ashamed, parti∣cularly among those who walk in the same Path. When Trouble and Heaviness take hold upon him, should you not then earnestly exhort him, to pour out his Soul before God! Always to <HI>pray and not to faint?</HI> And when he feels the Worth∣lessness of his own Prayers, are you not to work together with God, and remind him of going up into <HI>the House of the Lord,</HI> and praying with all them that fear him? But if he does this, the <HI>dy∣ing Word</HI> of his Lord, will soon be brought to his Remembrance: A plain Intimation, that this is the Time, when we should second the Motions of the Blessed Spirit. And thus may we lead him
<PB N="256" REF="028060_0241_0FD68C27C1643F38"/>Step by Step, through all the Means which God has ordained; not according to our own Will, but just as the Providence and the Spirit of God go before and open the Way.</P>
<P N="3">3. Yet as we find no Command in Holy Writ, for any particular Order to be observed herein, so neither do the Providence and the Spirit of God, adhere to any without Variation: But the Means into which different Men are led, and in which they find the Blessing of God, are varied, transposed and combined together, a thousand dif∣ferent Ways. Yet still our Wisdom is, to follow the Leadings of his Providence and his Spirit: To be guided herein (more especially as to the Means wherein we ourselves seek the Grace of God) partly by his outward Providence, giving us the Opportunity of using sometimes one Means, sometimes another: Partly by our Experience, which it is whereby his free Spirit is pleased most to work in our Heart. And in the mean time, the sure and general Rule for all who groan for the Salvation of God, is this, Whenever Oppor∣tunity serves, use all the Means which God has ordained. For who knows, in which God will meet thee, with the Grace that bringeth Salva∣tion?</P>
<P N="4">4. As to the <HI>Manner</HI> of using them, whereon indeed it wholly depends, whether they should convey any Grace at all to the User, it behoves us, First, always to retain a lively Sense, that God is above all Means. Have a Care therefore of limiting the Almighty. He doth whatsoever and whensoever it pleaseth him. He can convey his Grace, either in or out of any of the Means which he hath appointed. Perhaps he will. <HI>Who
<PB N="257" REF="028060_0242_0FD68C28DF4EF808"/>hath known the Mind of the Lord? Or who hath been his Counsellor?</HI> Look then every Moment for his Appearing! Be it at the Hour you are employed in his Ordinances; or before, or after that Hour. Or when you are hindered therefrom. He is not hindered. He is always ready: Always able, always willing to save. <HI>It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Before</HI> you use any Means, let it be deeply imprest on your Soul, "There is no <HI>Power</HI> in this. It is in itself a poor, dead, empty Thing: Separate from God; it is a dry Leaf, a Shadow. Neither is there any <HI>Merit</HI> in my using this; nothing intrinsically pleasing to God, nothing whereby I deserve any Favour at his hands, no, not a Drop of Water to cool my Tongue. But because God bids, therefore I do; because he directs me to wait in his Way, therefore here I wait for his free Mercy, whereof cometh my Sal∣vation.</P>
<P>Settle this in your Heart, that the <HI>Opus Opera∣tum,</HI> the mere Work done profiteth nothing: That there is no <HI>Power</HI> to save, but in the Spirit of God; no <HI>Merit,</HI> but in the Blood of Christ: That consequently, even what God ordains, conveys no Grace to the Soul, if you trust not in him alone. On the other Hand, he that does truly trust in him, cannot fall short of the Grace of God, even tho' he were cut off from every Outward Ordinance, tho' he were shut up in the Center of the Earth.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>In</HI> using all Means, seek God alone. In and through every Outward Thing, look singly to the <HI>Power</HI> of his Spirit, and the <HI>Merits</HI> of his Son. Beware you do not stick in the
<PB N="258" REF="028060_0243_0FD68C2BDEBBFF08"/><HI>Work</HI> itself; if you do, it is all lost Labour. No∣thing short of God can satisfy your Soul. There∣fore eye him, in all, through all, and above all.</P>
<P>Remember also, to use all Means, <HI>as Means:</HI> As ordained, not for their own Sake, but in order to the Renewal of your Soul in Righteousness and true Holiness. If therefore they actually tend to this, well. But if not, they are Dung and Dross. Lastly, <HI>After</HI> you have used any of these, take care, how you value yourself thereon: How you congratulate yourself, as having done some great Thing. This is turning all into Poison. Think, "If God was not there, what does this avail? Have I not been adding Sin to Sin? How long! O Lord! save or I perish! O lay not this Sin to my Charge!" If God was there, if his Love flowed into your Heart, you have forgot, as it were, the Outward Work. You see, you know, you feel, God is All in All. Be abased. Sink down before him. Give him all the Praise. Let God <HI>in all Things be glorified through Christ Jesus.</HI> Let <HI>all</HI> your <HI>Bones cry out, My Song shall be always of the Loving-kindness of the Lord: With my Mouth will I ever be telling of thy Truth, from one Genera∣tion to another!</HI></P>

<P>I design, fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> particularly to enquire, wherein this Circumcision of Heart consis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>: And, secondly, to mention some Reflection<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that naturally arise from such an Enquiry.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="259" REF="028060_0247_0FD68C35953444B8"/>
I. 1. I am, first, to enquire, wherein that Cir∣cumcision of Heart consists, which will receive the Praise of God. In general we may observe, it is that habitual Disposition of Soul, which in the Sacred Writings is termed Holiness, and which di∣rectly implies, the being cleansed from Sin <Q>from all Filthiness both of Flesh and Spirit,</Q> and by Consequence, the being endued with those Virtues, which were also in <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> the being so <HI>re∣newed in the Image of our Mind,</HI> as to be <HI>perfect, as our Father in Heaven is perfect.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To be more particular, Circumcision of Heart implies, Humility, Faith, Hope, and Cha∣rity. Humility, a right Judgment of ourselves, cleanses our Minds from those high Conceits of our own Perfections, from that undue Opi∣nion of our own Abilities and Attainments, which are the genuine Fruit of a corrupted Na∣ture. This entirely cuts off that vain Thought, I am <HI>rich</HI> and <HI>wise,</HI> and <HI>have Need of nothing;</HI> and convinces us, that we are by Nature <HI>wretched. and poor, and miserable, and blind, and naked.</HI> It convinces us, that in our best Estate, we are of ourselves all Sin and Vanity; that Confusion, and Ignorance, and Error, reign over our Understand∣ing; that unreasonable, earthly, sensual, devilish Passions, usurp Authority over our Will: In a Word, that there is no whole Part in our Soul, that all the Foundations of our Nature are out of Course.</P>
<P N="3">3. At the same Time we are convinced, that we are not sufficient of ourselves to help ourselves; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Spirit of God we can do no∣thing but add Sin to Sin: that it is He alone
<PB N="260" REF="028060_0248_0FD68C3713304EC8"/><HI>who worketh in us</HI> by his almighty Power, either <HI>to will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do</HI> that which is good; it being as impossible for us even to think a good Thought, without the supernatural Assistance of his Spirit, as to create ourselves, or to renew our whole Souls in Righ∣teousness and true Holiness.</P>
<P N="4">4. A sure Effect of our having formed this right Judgment, of the Sinfulness and Helpless∣ness of our Nature, is a Disregard of that <HI>Honour which cometh of Man,</HI> which is usually paid to some supposed Excellency in us. He who knows him∣self, neither desires nor values the Applause which he knows he deserves not. It is therefore <HI>a very small Thing with</HI> him, <HI>to be judged by Man's Judg∣ment.</HI> He has all Reason to think, by compa∣ring what it has said either for or against him, with what he feels in his own Breast, that the World, as well as the God of this World, was <HI>a Liar from the Beginning.</HI> And even as to those who are not of the World, though he would choose, if it were the Will of God, that they should account of him as of one desirous to be sound a faithful Steward of his Lord's Goods, if haply this might be a Means of enabling him to be of more Use to his Fellow-Servants, yet as this is the one End of his wishing for their Ap∣probation, so he does not at all rest upon it. For he is assured, that whatever God wills, He can never want Instruments to perform; since He is able, even of these Stones, to raise up Servants to do his Pleasure.</P>
<P N="5">5. This is that Lowliness of Mind, which they have learned of <HI>Christ,</HI> who follow his Ex∣ample and tread in his Steps. And this Know∣ledge of their Disease, whereby they are more
<PB N="261" REF="028060_0249_0FD68C3A19454CA0"/>and more cleansed from one Part of it, Pride and Vanity, disposes them to embrace, with a willing Mind, the second Thing implied in <HI>Circumcision of Heart,</HI> that Faith which alone is able to make them whole, which is the one Medicine given under Heaven to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Sickness.</P>
<P N="6">6. The best Guide of the Blind, the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>est Light of them that are in Darkness, the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>fect In∣struct or of the Foolish, is Faith. But it must be such a Faith as is <HI>mighty through GOD, to the pulling down</HI> of <HI>Strong holds,</HI> to the overturning all the Prejudices of corrupt Reason, all the false Max∣ims revered among Men; all evil Customs and Habits; all that <HI>Wisdom of the World</HI> which <HI>is Foolishness with GOD;</HI> as <HI>casteth down Imagina∣tions</HI> (Reasonings) <HI>and every high Thing that ex∣alteth itself against the Knowledge of GOD, and bringeth into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience of</HI> Christ.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>All Things are possible to him that</HI> thus <HI>be∣lieveth: The Eyes of his Understanding being en∣lightened,</HI> he <HI>sees</HI> what is his Calling, even to <HI>glorify GOD,</HI> who hath <HI>bought him with</HI> so high <HI>a Price, in his Body and in his Spirit, which now are GOD's</HI> by Redemption, as well as by Creation. He feels what is <HI>the exceeding Great∣ness of his Power,</HI> who as He raised up <HI>Christ</HI> from the Dead, so is able to quicken us, <HI>dead in Sin, by his Spirit which dwelleth in us. This is the Victory which overcometh the World, even our Faith:</HI> That Faith which is not only an unshaken Assent to all that God hath revealed in Scripture, and in particular to those important Truths, <HI>Jesus Christ came into the World to save Sinners; He bare our Sins in his own Body on the
<PB N="262" REF="028060_0250_0FD68C3D277E0BE0"/>Tree; He is the Propitiation for our Sins; and not for ours only, but also for the Sins of the whole World:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>N. B.</HI> The following Part of this Paragraph is now added <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Sermon formerly proached.</NOTE> But likewise the Revelation of <HI>Christ</HI> in our Hearts; a divine Evidence or Conviction of his Love, his free, unmerited Love to me a Sinner; a sure Confidence in his pardoning Mercy, wrought in us by the Holy Ghost: A Confidence, whereby every true. Believer is enabled to bear Witness, <HI>I know that my Redeemer liveth;</HI> that <HI>I have an Ad∣vocate with the Father;</HI> that <HI>Jesus Christ the righteous is</HI> my Lord, and <HI>the Propitiation for</HI> my <HI>Sins.</HI> I know He <HI>hath loved</HI> me, <HI>and given Himself for</HI> me. He <HI>hath reconciled</HI> me, <HI>even</HI> me <HI>to GOD;</HI> and I <HI>have Redemption through his Blood, even the Forgiveness of Sins.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Such a Faith as this, cannot fail to shew evidently the Power of Him that inspires it, by delivering his Children from the Yoke of Sin, and <HI>purging</HI> their <HI>Consciences from dead Works:</HI> By strengthening them so, that they are no longer constrained to <HI>obey Sin in the Desires thereof;</HI> but in∣stead of <HI>yielding their Members unto</HI> it, <HI>as Instruments of Unrighteousness,</HI> they now <HI>yield</HI> themselves en∣tirely <HI>unto GOD, as those that are alive from the Dead.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Those who are thus by Faith <HI>born of GOD,</HI> have also <HI>strong Consolation through Hope.</HI> This is the next Thing which the <HI>Circumcision of the Heart</HI> implies; even the Testimony of their own Spirit, with the Spirit which witnesses in their Hearts, that they are the Children of God. Indeed it is the same Spirit who works in them
<PB N="263" REF="028060_0251_0FD68C402691DEF0"/>that clear and chearful Confidence, that their Heart is upright toward God; that good Assurance, that they now do, through his Grace, the Things which are acceptable in his Sight; that they are now in the Path which leadeth to Life, and shall, by the Mercy of God, endure therein to the End. It is he who giveth them a lively Expectation of receiving all good Things at God's Hand; a joy∣ous Prospect of that <HI>Crown of Glory, which is re∣served in Heaven</HI> for them. By this Anchor a Christian is kept steady in the Midst of the Waves of this troublesome World, and preserved from striking upon either of those fatal Roc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, Presump∣tion or Despair. He is neither discouraged by the misconceived Severity of his Lord, nor does he <HI>despise the Richness of his Goodness.</HI> He neither apprehends the Difficulties of the Race set before him, to be greater than he has Strength to conquer, nor expects them to be so little as to yield him the Conquest, 'till he has put forth all his Strength. The Experience he already has in the Christian Warfare, as it assures him, his <HI>Labour is not in vain,</HI> if <HI>whatever his Hand findeth to do,</HI> he <HI>doth it with his Might;</HI> so it forbids his entertaining so vain a Thought, as that he can otherwise gain any Advantage, as that any Virtue can be shewn, any Praise attained, by <HI>faint Hearts and feeble Hands:</HI> Or indeed by any but those who pursue the same Course with the great Apostle of the Gen∣tiles, <HI>I,</HI> says he, <HI>so run, not as uncertainly, so fight I, not as one that beateth the Air. But I keep under my Body, and bring it into Subjection; lest by any Means when I have preached to others, I myself should be a Cast away.</HI></P>
<P N="10"><PB N="264" REF="028060_0252_0FD68C43710D24E8"/>
10. By the same Discipline is every good Soldier of <HI>Christ,</HI> to <HI>innure himself to endure Hard∣ships.</HI> Confirmed and strengthened by this, he will be able not only to renounce the <HI>Works of Darkness,</HI> but every Appetite too and every Af∣fection, which is not subject to the Law of God. For <HI>every one,</HI> saith St. <HI>John, who hath this Hope, purifieth himself even as He is pure.</HI> It is his daily Care, by the Grace of God in <HI>Christ,</HI> and thro' the Blood of the Covenant, to purge the Inmost Recesses of his Soul, from the Lusts that before possest and defiled it: from Unclean∣ness, and Envy, and Malice, and Wrath, from every Passion and Temper, that is <HI>after the Flesh,</HI> that either springs from, or cherishes his Native Corruption: As well knowing, that he whose very <HI>Body is the Temple of GOD,</HI> ought to admit into it nothing common or unclean; and that <HI>Holiness becometh</HI> that <HI>House for ever,</HI> where the Spirit of Holiness vouchsafes to dwell.</P>
<P N="11">11. Yet lackest thou one Thing, whosoever thou art, that to a deep Humility, and a stead∣fast Faith, hast joined a lively Hope, and thereby in a good Measure cleansed thy Heart from its in∣bred Pollution. If thou wilt be perfect, add to all these Charity; add Love, and thou hast the <HI>Cir∣cumcision of the Heart. Love is the fulfilling of the Law, the End of the Commandment.</HI> Very ex∣cellent Things are spoken of Love; it is the Essence, the Spirit, the Life of all Virtue. It is not only the first and great Command, but it is all the Commandments in one. Whatsoever Things are just, whatsoever Things are pure, whatsoever Things are amiable or honourable; if there be any Virtue, if there be any Praise,
<PB N="265" REF="028060_0253_0FD68C468DDD1280"/>they are all comprized in this one Word, Love. In this is Perfection and Glory and Happiness: The Royal Law of Heaven and Earth is this, <HI>Thou shalt love the</HI> Lord <HI>thy</HI> God <HI>with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind, and with all thy Strength.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. Not that this forbids us to love any Thing besides God: It implies, that we <HI>love our Brother also.</HI> Nor yet does it forbid us (as some have strangely imagined) to take Pleasure in any Thing but God. To suppose this, is to suppose the Fountain of Holiness, is directly the Author of Sin: Since he has inseparably annexed Pleasure to the Use of those Creatures, which are neces∣sary to sustain the Life he has given us. This therefore can never be the Meaning of his Com∣mand. What the real Sense of it is, both our blessed Lord and his Apostles tell us too frequent∣ly and too plainly to be misunderstood. They all with one Mouth bear Witness, that the true Mean∣ing of those several Declarations, <HI>The</HI> Lord <HI>thy</HI> God <HI>is One</HI> Lord. <HI>Thou shalt have no other Gods but Me; Thou shalt love the</HI> Lord <HI>thy</HI> God <HI>with all thy Strength; Thou shalt cleave unto Him;</HI> The <HI>Desire of the Soul</HI> shall be <HI>to his Name:</HI> Is no o∣ther than this. The one perfect Good shall be your one ultimate End. One Thing shall ye de∣sire for its own Sake, The Fruition of Him that is All in All. One Happiness shall ye propose to your Souls, even an Union with him that made them: The having <HI>Fellowship with the Father and the Son:</HI> The being <HI>joined to the</HI> Lord <HI>in one Spirit.</HI> One Design ye are to pursue to the End of Time, The Enjoyment of God in Time and in Eternity. Desire other
<PB N="266" REF="028060_0254_0FD68C48B9598C90"/>Things, so far as they tend to this. Love the Creature—as it leads to the Creator. But in every Step you take, be this the glorious Point that ter∣minates your View. Let every Affection, and Thought, and Word, and Work, be subordinate to this. Whatever ye desire or fear, whatever ye seek or shun, whatever ye think, speak, or do, be it in order to your Happiness in God, the sole End <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> well as Source of your Being.</P>
<P N="13">13. Have no End, no ultimate End but God. Thus our Lord, <HI>One Thing is needful.</HI> And if thine Eye be singly fixt on this one Thing, <HI>thy whole Body shall be full of Light.</HI> Thus St. <HI>Paul,</HI> <Q>This one Thing I do; I press toward the Mark, for the Prize of the high Calling in Christ Jesus.</Q> Thus St. <HI>James,</HI> <Q>Cleanse your Hands, ye Sinners, and purify your Hearts, ye Double-minded.</Q> Thus St. <HI>John,</HI> <Q>Love not the World, neither the Things that are in the World. For all that is in the World, the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, is not of the Father, but is of the World.</Q> The seeking Happiness in what gratifies either the Desire of the Flesh, by a∣greeably striking upon the out ward Senses, the De∣sire of the Eye, of the Imagination, by its Novelty, Greatness, or Beauty; or the Pride of Life, whe∣ther by Pomp, Grandeur, Power, or the usual Con∣sequence of them, Applause and Admiration: <HI>Is not of the Father,</HI> cometh not from, neither is ap∣proved by the Father of Spirits; <HI>but of the World;</HI> it is the distinguishing Mark of those, who will not have Him to reign over them.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="267" REF="028060_0255_0FD68C49D520B100"/>
II. 1. Thus have I particularly inquired, what that <HI>Circumcision of Heart</HI> is, which will obtain the Praise or God. I am, in the second Place, to mention some Reflections, that naturally arise from such an Inquiry, as a plain Rule whereby eve∣ry Man may judge of himself, whether he be of the World or of God.</P>
<P>And, first, it is clear, from what has been said, That no Man has a Title to the Praise of God, unless his Heart is circumcised by Humility, unless he is little, and base, and vile in his own Eyes: unless he is deeply convinced of that inbred "Cor∣ruption of his Nature, whereby he is very far gone from Original Righteousness," being prone to all Evil, averse to all Good, corrupt and abomina∣ble; having a <HI>carnal Mind.</HI> which <HI>is Enmity a∣gainst GOD, and is not subject to the Law of GOD; nor indeed can be:</HI> Unless he continually feels in his in most Soul, that without the Spirit of God resting upon him, he can neither think, nor desire, nor speak, nor act, any Thing good or well-pleasing in his Sight.</P>
<P>No Man, I say, has a Title to the Praise of God, 'till he feels his Want of God: Nor in∣deed, 'till he seeketh that <HI>Honour, which cometh of GOD only:</HI> And neither desires nor pursues that which cometh of Man, unless so far, only as it tends to this.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Truth which naturally follows from what has been said, is, that none shall ob∣tain the Honour that cometh of God, unless his Heart be circumcised by Faith; even a <HI>Faith of the Operation of GOD:</HI> unless refusing to be any longer led by his Senses, Appetites or Pas∣sions, or even by that blind Leader of the Blind,
<PB N="268" REF="028060_0256_0FD68C4B5F8F6820"/>so idolized by the World, natural Reason, he lives and <HI>walks by Faith,</HI> directs every Step, as <HI>seeing Him that is invisible, looks not at the Things that are seen, which are temporal, but at the Things that are not seen which are eternal;</HI> and governs all his De∣sires, Designs and Thoughts, all his Actions and Conversations, as one who is entered in within the Veil, where <HI>Jesus</HI> sits at the Right-hand of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. It were to be wished, that they were better acquainted with this Faith, who employ much of their Time and Pains, in laying another Founda∣tion; in grounding Religion, on "the Eternal <HI>Fit∣ness</HI> of Things," on "the intrinsick <HI>Excellence</HI> of Virtue," and the <HI>Beauty</HI> of Actions flowing from it: On the <HI>Reasons,</HI> as they term them, of Good and Evil, and the <HI>Relations</HI> of Beings to each other. Either these Accounts of the Grounds of Christian Duty, coincide with the Scriptural, or not. If they do, why are well-meaning Men perplext, and drawn from the weightier Matters of the Law, by a Cloud of Terms, whereby the easiest Truths are explained into Obscurity. If they are not, then it behoves them to consider, who is the Author of this New Doctrine: Whether he is likely to be <HI>an Angel from Heaven,</HI> who <HI>preacheth another Gospel</HI> than that of <HI>Christ Jesus:</HI> Though, if he were, God, not we, hath pronounced his Sentence, <HI>Let him be accursed.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Our Gospel, as it knows no other Founda∣tion of Good Works than Faith, or of Faith than <HI>Christ,</HI> so it clearly informs us, we are not his Dis∣ciples, while we either deny Him to be the Author, or his Spirit to be the Inspirer and Perfecter both of our Faith and Works. <HI>If any Man have not the Spirit of</HI> Christ, <HI>he is none of his.</HI> He alone can
<PB N="269" REF="028060_0257_0FD68C4D30AB2EC8"/>quicken those who are dead unto God, can breathe into them the Breath of Christian Life, and so pre∣vent, accompany, and follow them with his Grace, as to bring their good Desires to good Effect. And <HI>as many as are thus led, by the Spirit of</HI> God, <HI>they are the Sons of</HI> God. This is God's short and plain Account of true Religion and Virtue; and <HI>other Foundation can no Man lay.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. From what has been said we may, Thirdly, learn, That none is truly <HI>led by the Spirit,</HI> unless that <HI>Spirit bear Witness with his Spirit, that he is a Child of</HI> God: unless he see the Prize and the Crown before him, and <HI>rejoice in Hope of the Glory of</HI> God: So greatly have they erred, who have taught that in serving God, we ought not to have a View to our own Happiness. Nay, but we are often and expressly taught of God, to have Respect <HI>unto the Recompence of Reward;</HI> to balance the Toil with the <HI>Joy set before us,</HI> these <HI>light Afflictions</HI> with that <HI>exceeding Weight of Glory.</HI> Yea, we are <HI>Aliens to the Covenant of Promise,</HI> we are <HI>without</HI> God <HI>in the World,</HI> until God <HI>of his abundant Mercy, hath be∣gotten us again, unto a living Hope, of the Inheri∣tance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. But if these Things are so, 'tis high Time for those Persons to deal faithfully with their own Souls, who are so far from finding in themselves this joyful Assurance, that they fulfil the Terms and shall obtain the Promises of that Covenant, as to quarrel with the Covenant itself, and blaspheme the Terms of it: To complain, "They are too severe, and that no Man ever did, or shall live up to them!" What is this, but to reproach God, as if He were an hard Master, requiring of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Servants more than he enables them to perform: as if He
<PB N="270" REF="028060_0258_0FD68C4F4E988AB0"/>had mocked the helpless Works of his Hands, by binding them to Impossibilities; by commanding them to overcome, where neither their own Strength, nor his Grace was sufficient for them?</P>
<P N="7">7. These Blasphemers might almost persuade those, to imagine themselves guiltless, who, in the contrary Extreme, hope to fulfil the Commands of God, without taking any Pains at all. Vain Hope! that a Child of <HI>Adam</HI> should ever expect, to see the Kingdom of <HI>Christ</HI> and of God, without striving, without <HI>agonizing</HI> first, <HI>to enter in at the strait Gate!</HI> that one who was <HI>conceived and born in Sin,</HI> and whose <HI>inward Parts are very Wickedness,</HI> should once entertain a Thought, of being <HI>purified as his</HI> Lord <HI>is pure,</HI> unless he <HI>treads in his Steps,</HI> and <HI>take up his Cross daily;</HI> unless he <HI>cut off his Right Hand,</HI> and <HI>pluck out the Right Eye and cast it from</HI> him; that he should ever dream of shaking off his old Opinions, Passions, Tempers, of being <HI>sanc∣tified throughout in Spirit, Soul, and Body,</HI> without a constant and continued Course of general Self-denial!</P>
<P N="8">8. What less than this can we possibly infer from the above cited Words of St. <HI>Paul?</HI> Who "living in <HI>Infirmities, in Reproaches, in Necessities, in Perse∣cutions, in Distresses</HI> for <HI>Christ</HI>'s Sake, who being full of <HI>Signs and Wonders and mighty Deeds,</HI> who having been <HI>caught up into the third Heaven;</HI>" yet reckoned (as a late Author strongly expresses it) that all his Virtues would be unsecure, and even his Salvation in Danger, without this constant Self-denial. his Salvation in Danger, without this constant Self-denial. <HI>So run I,</HI> says he, <HI>not as uncertainly, so fight I, not as one that beateth the Air.</HI> By which he plainly reaches us, That he who does not thus run, who does not thus deny himself daily, does <HI>run

<P N="9">9. To as little Purpose does he talk of <HI>fighting the Fight of Faith,</HI> as vainly ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to attain the Crown of Incorruption (as we may, lastly, infer from the preceding Observations) whose Heart is not circum∣cised by Love. Cutting off both the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, engaging the whole Man, Body, Soul and Spirit, in the ardent Pursuit of that one Object, is so es∣sential to a Child of God, that "without it, who∣soever liveth is counted dead before Him." <Q>Tho' I speak with the Tongue of Men and Angels, and have not Love, I am as sounding Brass, or a tink∣ling Cymbal. Though I have the Gift of Pro∣phecy, and understand all Mysteries and all Know∣ledge, and though I have all Faith so as to remove Mountains, and have not Love, I am noshing. Nay, though I give all my Goods to feed the Poor, and my Body to be burned, and have not Love, it profiteth me nothing?</Q></P>
<P N="10">10. Here then is the Sum of the Perfect Law, this is the true <HI>Circumcision of the Heart.</HI> Let the Spirit return to God that gave it, with the whole Train of its Affections. <HI>Unto the Place from whence all the Rivers came, thither</HI> let them flow again. Other Sacrifices from us He would not; but the living Sacrifice of the Heart he hath chosen. Let it be continually offered up to God through <HI>Christ,</HI> in Flames of holy Love. And let no Creature be suffered to share with Him: For he is a jealous God. His Throne will he not divide with another: He will reign without a Rival. Be no Design, no Desire admitted there, but what has Him for its ul∣timate Object. This is the Way wherein those Children of God once walked, who being dead,
<PB N="272" REF="028060_0260_0FD68C581822D540"/>still speak to us, "Desire not to live but to praise his Name; let all your Thoughts, Words and Works, tend to his Glory. Set your Heart firm on Him, and on other Things, only as they are in and from Him." Let your Soul be filled with so entire a Love of Him, that you may love nothing but for his Sake." "Have a pure Intention of Heart, a steadfast Regard to his Glory in all your Actions." "Fix your Eye upon the blessed Hope of your Call∣ing, and make all the Things of the World minister unto it." For then, and not till then, is that <HI>Mind in us which was also in</HI> Christ Jesus, when in every Motion of our Heart, in every Word of our Tongue, in every Work of our Hands, we "pursue nothing but in Relation to Him, and in Subordination to his Pleasure:" When we too, neither think, nor speak, nor act, to fulfil our own <HI>Will, but the Will of Him that sent</HI> us: When whether we <HI>eat or drink, or whatever we do, we do all to the Glory of</HI> God.</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>JOHN iii. 8.</HI></BIBL>
<P>So is every one that is born of the Spirit.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HOW is every one that is <HI>born of the Spirit?</HI> That is <HI>born again? Born of</HI> God? What is meant by the being <HI>born again?</HI> The being <HI>bor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of</HI> God? Or, being <HI>born of the Spirit?</HI> What is implied in, The Being a <HI>Son</HI> or a <HI>Child</HI> of God? Or, Having the <HI>Spirit of Adoption?</HI> That these Pri∣vileges, by the free Mercy of God, are ordinarily annexed to Baptism, (which is thence termed by our Lord in the preceding Verse, the being <HI>born of Water and of the Spirit</HI>) we know: But we would<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 26.</NOTE> know what these Privileges are? What is <HI>The New Birth?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Perhaps it is not needful to give a Definition<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of this, seeing the Scripture gives none. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Question is of the deepest Concern, to every Child of Man, (since <HI>except a Man be born again, born of the Spirit,</HI> he <HI>cannot see the Kingdom of</HI> God) I propose to lay down the Marks of it in the plainest Manner, just as I find them laid down in Scripture.</P>
<P N="1">I. 1. The first of these (and the Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tion of all the rest) is Faith. So St. <HI>Paul, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>are
<PB N="276" REF="028060_0263_0FD68C631E966608"/>all the Children of</HI> God <HI>by Faith in</HI> Christ Je∣sus. So St. <HI>John,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John i. 12, 13.</NOTE> <HI>To them gave He Power</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Right, or Privilege, it might rather be translated) <HI>to become the Sons of</HI> God, <HI>even to them that believe on his Name: Which were born</HI> when they believed, (<HI>not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Flesh,</HI> not by natural Generation, <HI>nor of the Will of Man,</HI> like those Children adopted by Men, in whom no inward Change is thereby wrought <HI>but</HI>) <HI>of</HI> God. And again in his General Epistle,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John v. I.</NOTE> <HI>Whosoever believeth that</HI> Jesus <HI>is the</HI> Christ, <HI>is born of</HI> God.</P>
<P N="2">2. But it is not a barely notional or specula∣tive Faith, that is here spoken of by the A∣postles. It is not a bare Assent to this Propo∣sition, "<HI>Jesus</HI> is the <HI>Christ;</HI>" nor indeed to all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Propositions contained in our Creed, or in the Old and New Testament. It is not merely "an Assent, to any, or all these credible Things as credible." To say this, were to say, (which who could hear?) that the Devils were born of God. For they have this Faith. They trem∣bling believe, both that <HI>Jesus</HI> is the <HI>Christ,</HI> and that all Scripture having been given by Inspi∣ration of God, is true as God is true. It is not only "an Assent to Divine Truth, upon the Testi∣mony of God," or "upon the Evidence of Miracles." For they also heard the Words of his Mouth, and knew Him to be a faithful and true Witness. They could not but receive the Testimony He gave, both of Himself, and of the Father which sent Him. They saw likewise the mighty Works which he did, and thence believ∣ed that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>came forth from</HI> God. Yet not
<PB N="277" REF="028060_0264_0FD68C6422124658"/>withstanding this Faith, they are still <Q>reserved in Chains of Darkness, unto the Judgment of the great Day.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. For all this is no more than a dead Faith. The True, Living, Christian Faith, which who∣soever hath is <HI>born of</HI> God, is not only an As∣sent, an Act of the Understanding, but a Dispo∣sition which God hath wrought in his Heart; "a sure Trust and Confidence in God, that through the Merits of <HI>Christ,</HI> his Sins are for∣given, and he reconciled to the Favour of God." This implies, that a Man first <HI>renounces himself;</HI> that in order to be <HI>found in</HI> Christ, to be accept∣ed through Him, he totally rejects all <HI>Confidence in the Flesh;</HI> that <HI>having nothing to pay,</HI> having no Trust in his own Works of Righteousness of any Kind, he comes to God, as a lost, miserable, self-destroyed, self-condemned, undone, helpless Sinner; as one whose <HI>Mouth</HI> is utterly <HI>stopped,</HI> and who is altogether <HI>guilty before</HI> God. Such a Sense of Sin (commonly called <HI>Despair,</HI> by those who speak Evil of the Things they know not together with a full Conviction, such as no Words can express, That of <HI>Christ</HI> only cometh our Sal∣vation, and an earnest Desire of that Salvation, must precede a Living Faith: A Trust in Him, who "for us paid our Ransom by his Death, and for us fulfilled the Law in his Life." This Faith then, whereby we are born of God, is "not only a Belief of all the Articles of our Faith, but also a true Confidence of the Mercy of God, thro' our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI>"</P>
<P N="4">4. An immediate and constant Fruit of this Faith, whereby we are born of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it which can in no wise be separated from it, no not
<PB N="278" REF="028060_0265_0FD68C659E1E7EB8"/>for an Hour, is Power over Sin: Power over out∣ward Sin, of every King; over every evil Word and Work; for wheresoever the Blood of <HI>Christ</HI> is thus applied, it <Q>purgeth the Conscience from dead Works:</Q> And over inward Sin; for it <HI>purifi∣eth the Hears</HI> from every unholy Desire and Temper. This Fruit of Faith, St. <HI>Paul</HI> has largely described, in the sixth Chapter of his Epistle to the <HI>Romans.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> i. 6. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <Q>How shall we (saith he) who by Faith are dead to Sin, live any longer therein? Our old Man is crucified with Christ, that the Body of Sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve Sin.—Likewise reckon ye yourselves to be dead un∣to Sin, but alive unto God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.—Let not Sin therefore reign,</Q> even <Q>in your mortal Body, but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the Dead. For Sin shall not have Dominion over you.—God be thanked, that ye were the Servants of Sin—But being made free</Q>—the plain Meaning is, God be thanked, that though ye were in Time past the Servants of Sin, yet now <Q>being free from Sin, ye are become the Servants of Righteousness.</Q></P>
<P N="5">5. The same invaluable Privilege of the Sons of God, is as strongly asserted by St. <HI>John;</HI> par∣ticularly, with Regard to the former Branch of it, namely, Power over outward Sin. After he had been crying out, as one astonished at the Depth of the Riches of the Goodness of God,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 1, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <Q>Behold what Manner of Love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the Sons of God! Beloved, now are we the Sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> but we know, that when He shall appear we
<PB N="279" REF="028060_0266_0FD68C6B7A7AEAB0"/>shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is?</Q> He soon adds,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 1, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <Q>Whosoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin, for his Seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</Q> But some Men will say, "True; whosoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin <HI>habitually." Habitually!</HI> whence is that? I read it not. It is not written in the Book. God plainly faith, <HI>He doth not commit Sin.</HI> And thou addest, <HI>habi∣tually!</HI> Who art thou that <HI>mendest</HI> the Oracles of God? That <HI>addest to the Words of this Book?</HI> Beware I beseech thee, lest God <HI>add to thee, all the Plagues that are written therein!</HI> Especially when the Comment thou addest is such, as quite swal∣lows up the Text: So that by this <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> this artful Method of Deceiving, the precious Pro∣mise is utterly lost: By this <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, this Tricking and Shuffling of Men, the Word of God is made of none Effect. O beware thou that thus takest from the Words of this Book, that taking away the whole Meaning and Spirit from them, leavest only what may indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> termed a dead Letter, lest God take away thy Part out of the Book of Life!</P>
<P N="6">6. Suffer we the Apostle to interpret his own Words, by the whole Tenor of his Discourse. In the fifth Verse of this Chapter he had said, <Q>Ye know that He (Christ) was manifested, to take away our Sins; and in him is no Sin.</Q> What is the Inference he draws from this?<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ver.</HI> 9.</NOTE> <Q>Whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not: Whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, neither known Him?</Q> To his Inforcement of this important Doctrine, he pre∣mises an highly necessary Caution:<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ver.</HI> 7.</NOTE> <Q>Little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hil∣dren,
<PB N="280" REF="028060_0267_0FD68C6CB9E941A0"/>let no Man deceive you,</Q> (for many will en∣deavour so to do; to persuade you that you may be unrighteous, that you may commit Sin, and yet be Children of God.) <Q>He that doth Righteous∣ness is righteous even as he is righteous. He that committeth Sin is of the Devil; for the Devil sinneth from the Beginning.' Then follows, whosoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin; for his Seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. In this, adds the Apostle, the Children of God are manifest, and the Children of the Devil.</Q> By this plain Mark (the committing or not committing Sin) are they distinguished from each other. To the same Ef∣fect are those Words in his fifth Chapter,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 18.</NOTE> <Q>We know that whosoever is born of God, sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.</Q></P>
<P N="7">7. Another Fruit of this living Faith is Peace. For<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 1.</NOTE> <HI>being justified by Faith,</HI> having all our Sins blotted out, <HI>we have Peace with</HI> God, <HI>through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Lord Jesus Christ. This indeed our Lord Himself, the Night before his Death, solemnly be∣queathed to all his Followe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 27.</NOTE> <HI>Peace,</HI> saith He, <Q>I leave with you; (you who believe in God, and believe also in Me) my Peace I give unto you. Not as the World giveth, give I unto you. Let not your Heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. And again,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ch. xvi. 33.</NOTE> These Things have I spoken unto you, that in Me ye might have Peace. This is that Peace of God, which passeth all Understanding,</Q> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ity of Soul, which it hath not entered into the Heart of a natural Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to conceive,
<PB N="281" REF="028060_0268_0FD68C6F23633FF8"/>and which it is not possible for even the spi∣ritual Man to utter. And it is a Peace which all the Powers of Earth and Hell are unable to take from him. Waves and Storms beat upon it, but they shake it not; for it is founded upon a Rock. It keepeth the Hearts and Minds of the Children of God, at all Times and in all Places. Whether they are in Ease or in Pain, in Sickness or Health, in Abundance or Want, they are happy in God. In every State they have learned to be content, yea, to give Thanks unto God through <HI>Christ Jesus:</HI> Being well assured, That "whatsoever Is, is best;" because it is his Will, concerning them. So that in all the Vicissitudes of Life, their <HI>Heart standeth fast, believing in the</HI> Lord.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. A second Scriptural Mark of those who are born of God is Hope. Thus St. <HI>Peter,</HI> speaking to all the Children of God, who were then <HI>scattered abroad,</HI> saith, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 3.</NOTE> <Q>Blessed be the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who accord∣ing to his abundant Mercy, hath begotten us a∣gain unto a lively Hope.</Q> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> A <HI>lively</HI> or <HI>living</HI> Hope, saith the Apostle: Because there is also a <HI>dead</HI> Hope (as well as a dead Faith) a Hope which is not from God, but from the Enemy of God and Man; as evidently appears by its Fruits; for, as it is the Offspring of Pride, so it is the Parent of every evil Word and Work. Whereas every Man that hath in him this liv∣ing Hope, is <HI>holy as He that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>h him is holy:</HI> Every Man that can truly say to his Brethren in <HI>Christ, Beloved, now are we the Sons of</HI> God,
<PB N="282" REF="028060_0269_0FD68C7022513B88"/><HI>and we shall see Him as He is, purifieth himself, even as He is pure.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This Hope termed in the Epistle to the <HI>He∣brews,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 22.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and elsewhere, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 11.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (in our Translation, <HI>The Full Assurance of Faith,</HI> and the <HI>full ssurance of Hope;</HI> Expressions the best which our Language could afford, altho' far weaker than those in the Original) as described in Scripture, implies, 1. The Testimony of our own Spirit or Conscience, that we walk <HI>in Simpli∣city and godly Sincerity;</HI> but, secondly and chiefly, The Testimony of the Spirit of God, <HI>hearing Witness with,</HI> or to, <HI>our Spirit, that we are the Children of</HI> God, <HI>and if Children, then Heirs, Heirs of</HI> God, and <HI>Joint-heirs with</HI> Christ.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let us well observe, what is here taught us by God Himself, touching the glorious Privilege of his Children. Who is it, that is here said to <HI>bear Witness?</HI> Not our Spirit only, but another; even the Spirit of God: He it is who <HI>beareth Witness with our Spirit.</HI> What is it, He beareth Witness of? <HI>That we are the Children of</HI> God; <HI>and if Children then Heirs, Heirs of</HI> God, <HI>and Joint-heirs with</HI> Christ:—<HI>if so be that we suffer with Him</HI> (if we deny ourselves, if we take up our Cross daily, if we chearfully endure Persecu∣tion or Reproach for his Sake) <HI>that we may also be glorified together.</HI> And in whom doth the Spirit of God bear this Witness? In all who are the Chil∣dren of God. By this very Argument does the A∣postle prove in the preceding Verses that they are so:<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 16, 17.</NOTE> <Q>As many (saith he) as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God. For ye have not received the Spirit of Bondage again, to fear;
<PB N="283" REF="028060_0270_0FD68C71BA368EB0"/>but ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father!</Q> It follows, <Q>The Spirit itself beareth Witness with our Spirit, that we are the Children of God.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. The Variation of the Phrase in the 15th Verse, is worthy our Observation. Ye <HI>have re∣ceived the Spirit of Adoption, whereby</HI> we <HI>cry, Abba, Father! Ye,</HI> as many as are the Sons of God, have in Virtue of your Sonship, received that self∣same Spirit of Adoption, whereby <HI>we</HI> cry, Abba, Father. <HI>We,</HI> the Apostles, Prophets, Teachers, (for so the Word may not improperly be understood) we, through whom you have believed, the <HI>Mini∣sters of</HI> Christ, <HI>and Stewards of the Mysteries of</HI> God. As <HI>we</HI> and <HI>you</HI> have one Lord, so we have one Spirit: As we have one Faith, so we have one Hope also. We and you are sealed with one <HI>Spi∣rit of Promise,</HI> the Earnest of <HI>yours</HI> and of <HI>our</HI> In∣heritance: The same Spirit bearing Witness with yours and with our Spirit, <HI>that we are the Children of</HI> God.</P>
<P N="5">5. And thus is the Scripture fulfilled, <HI>Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.</HI> For 'tis easy to believe, that though Sorrow may pre∣cede this Witness of God's Spirit with our Spirit, (indeed <HI>must,</HI> in some Degree, while we groan un∣der Fear, and a Sense of the Wrath of God abid∣ing on us) yet as soon as any Man feeleth it in him∣self, his <HI>Sorrow is turned into Joy.</HI> Whatsoever his Pain may have been before, yet as soon as that <HI>Hour is come, he remembreth the Anguish no more, for Joy</HI> that he is born of God. It may be, many of <HI>you</HI> have now Sorrow, because you are <HI>Aliens from the Common-wealth of</HI> Israel; because you are con∣scious
<PB N="284" REF="028060_0271_0FD68C7766B66E50"/>to yourselves that you have not this Spirit, that you are <HI>without Hope and without</HI> God <HI>in the World.</HI> But when the Comforter is come,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xxi. 22.</NOTE> <HI>then your Heart shall rejoice; yea, your Joy shall be full,</HI> and <HI>that Joy no Man taketh from you.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 11.</NOTE> <HI>We joy in</HI> God, will ye say, <HI>through our</HI> Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>by whom we have now received the Atonement: By whom we have Access into this Grace,</HI> this State of Grace, of Favour, of Reconciliation with God, <HI>wherein we stand, and rejoice in Hope of the Glory of</HI> God. Ye, saith St. <HI>Peter,</HI> whom<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 5, &amp;c.</NOTE> God <HI>hath begotten again un∣to a lively Hope, are kept by the Power of</HI> God <HI>unto Salvation—Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a Season, if Need be, ye are in Heaviness through ma∣nifold Temptations: That the trial of your Faith— may be sound unto Praise, and Honour, and Glory, at the Appearing of</HI> Jesus Christ—<HI>In whom, though now ye see Him not, ye rejoice with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory.</HI> Unspeakable indeed! It is not for the Tongue of Man to describe this Joy in the Holy Ghost. It is <HI>hidden Manna, which no Man know∣eth, save he that receiveth it.</HI> But this we know, it not only remains, but overflows in the Depth of Affliction. <HI>Are the Consolations of</HI> God <HI>small</HI> with his Children, when all earthly Comforts fail? Not so, But when Sufferings most abound, the Consolation of his Spirit doth much more abound: Insomuch that the Sons of God <HI>laugh at Destruction when it cometh;</HI> at Want, Pain, Hell, and the Grave; as knowing Him who <HI>hath the Keys of Death and Hell,</HI> and will shortly <HI>cast them into the bottomless Pit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> As hearing even now the <HI>great Voice out of Heaven, saying,</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxi. 3, 4. 4.</NOTE> <Q>Behold the Tabernacle
<PB N="285" REF="028060_0272_0FD68C791CD89908"/>of God is with Men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be his People, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes, and there shall be no more Death, neither Sorrow, nor Crying; neither shall there be any more Pain; for the former Things are past away.</Q></P>
<P N="3">III. 1. A third scriptural Mark of those who are born of God, and the greatest of all, is Love: Even<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 5.</NOTE> <Q>the Love of God shed abroad in their Hearts, by the Holy Ghost which is given unto them.</Q> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cal. iv. 8.</NOTE> <Q>Because they are Sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into their Hearts, cry∣ing, Abba, Father!</Q> By this Spirit, continually looking up to God, as their reconciled and loving Father, they cry to Him for their daily Bread, for all Things needful whether for their Souls or Bo∣dies.

<P N="2">2. And, in this Sense also,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John v. 1.</NOTE> Every one who loveth Him that begat, loveth him that is begotten of Him. His Spirit rejoiceth in God his Saviour.

<P N="3">3. The necessary Fruit of this Love of God, is the Love of our Neighbour, of every Soul which God hath made; not excepting our enemies, not excepting those who are now <HI>despitefully using and persecuting us:</HI> A Love, whereby we love every Man <HI>as ourselves,</HI> as we love our own Souls. Nay, our Lord has expressed it still more strongly, teaching us to <HI>love one another even as he hath loved us.</HI> Accordingly the Commandment written in the Hearts of all those that love God, is no other than this, <HI>As I have loved you, so love ye one another.</HI> Now<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 John iii. 16.</NOTE> <HI>herein perceive we the Love of</HI> God, <HI>in that He laid down his Life for us.

Then<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ver. 14.</NOTE> <HI>we know that we have passed from Death unto Life, be∣cause we</HI> thus <HI>love our Brethren.</HI><NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Ch. iv. 13.</NOTE> <HI>Hereby know we</HI> that we are born of God, that we <HI>dwell in Him, and He in us, because he hath given us of his loving Spirit.</HI> For<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">John iv. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Love is of</HI> God, <HI>and every one that</HI> thus <HI>loveth, is born of</HI> God <HI>and knoweth</HI> God.</P>
<P N="4">4. But some may possibly ask, Does not the Apostle say,<NOTE N="§§" PLACE="foot">1 John v. 3.</NOTE> <HI>This is the Love of</HI> God, <HI>that we keep his Commandments?</HI> Yea, and this the Love of our Neighbour also, in the same Sense as it is the Love of God. But what would you infer from hence? That the keeping the outward Commandments, is all that is implied in loving God with all your
<PB N="287" REF="028060_0274_0FD68C7C1D4B5BF0"/>Heart, with all your Mind, and Soul, and Strength, and in loving your Neighbour as yourself? That the Love of God is not an Affection of the Soul, but merely an <HI>Outward Service?</HI> And that the Love of our Neighbour is not a Disposition of Heart, but barely a Course of <HI>Outward Works!</HI> To mention so wild an Interpretation of the Apostle's Words, is sufficiently to confute it. The plain indisputable Meaning of that Text is, <HI>this is the</HI> Sign or Proof of the <HI>Love of</HI> God, of our keeping the first and great Commandment, to keep all the rest of his Commandments. For true Love, if it be once shed abroad in our Heart, will constrain us so to do: Since whosoever loves God with all his Heart, cannot but serve Him with all his Strength.</P>
<P N="5">5. A second Fruit then of the Love of God, (so far as it can be distinguished from it) is universal Obedience to Him we love, and Conformity to his Will: Obedience to all the Commands of God, internal and external: Obedience of the Heart and of the Life, in every Temper, and in all Manner of Conversation. And one of the Tempers most obviously implied herein is, the being <HI>zealous of good Works;</HI> the hungering and thirsting to do Good, in every possible Kind, unto all Men; The rejoic∣ing to <HI>spend and be spent for them,</HI> for every Child of Man, not looking for any Recompense in this World, but only in the Resurrection of the Just.</P>
<P N="1">1. Thus have I plainly laid down those Marks of the New-birth, which I find laid down in Scrip∣ture. Thus doth God Himself answer that weighty Question, what it is to be born of God? Such, if the Appeal be made to the Oracles of God, is <HI>every one that is born of the Spirit.</HI> This it is, in the
<PB N="288" REF="028060_0275_0FD68C7F1E692800"/>Judgment of the Spirit of God, to be a Son or a Child of God. It is, so to believe in God thro' <HI>Christ,</HI> as <HI>not to commit Sin,</HI> and to enjoy at all Times and in all Places, that <HI>Peace of</HI> God <HI>which passeth all Understanding.</HI> It is, so to <HI>hope</HI> in God through the Son of his Love, as to have not only the <HI>Testimony of a good Conscience,</HI> but also the Spirit of God <HI>bearing Witness with your Spirits, that ye are the Children of</HI> God: Whence cannot but spring the <HI>rejoicing evermore in Him through whom ye have received the Atonement.</HI> It is so to <HI>love</HI> God who hath thus loved you, as you never did love any Creature: So that ye are constrained to love all Men as yourselves; with a Love not only ever burning in your Hearts, but flaming out in all your Actions and Conversations, and making your whole Life one <HI>Labour of Love,</HI> one continued O∣bedience to those Commands, <HI>Be ye merciful, as</HI> God <HI>is merciful; Be ye holy, as I the</HI> Lord <HI>am holy; Be ye perfect, as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Who then are ye that are thus born of God? Ye <HI>know the Things which are given to you of</HI> God. Ye well know, that ye are the Children of God; and <HI>can assure your Hearts before Him.</HI> And every one of you who has observed these Words cannot but feel and know of a Truth, whether at this Hour, (answer to God and not to Man!) you are thus a Child of God or no? The Question is not what you was made in Baptism: (Do not evade:) But, what you are now? Is the Spirit of Adoption now in your Heart? To your own Heart let the Appeal be made. I ask not, whether you <HI>was</HI> born of Water and of the Spirit. But <HI>are</HI> you <HI>now</HI> the Temple of the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in you? I
<PB N="289" REF="028060_0276_0FD68C8092257648"/>allow you <HI>was circumcised with the Circumcision of</HI> Christ, (as St. <HI>Paul</HI> emphatically terms Baptism.) But does the Spirit of <HI>Christ</HI> and of Glory <HI>now</HI> rest upon you? Else <HI>your Circumcision is become Uncir∣cumcision.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Say not then in your Heart, I <HI>was once</HI> bap∣tized. Therefore I <HI>am now</HI> a Child of God? Alas, that Consequence will by no Means hold. How many are the baptized Gluttons and Drunkards, the baptized Liars and common Swearers, the bap∣tized Railers and Evil-speakers, the baptized Whore-mongers, Thieves, Extortioners? What think you? Are these now the Children of God? Verily I say unto you, whosoever you are, unto whom any one of the preceding Characters be∣long, <HI>ye are of your Father the Devil, and the Works of your Father ye do.</HI> Unto you I call, in the Name of Him whom you crucify afresh, and in his Words to your circumcised Predecessors, <HI>Ye Serpents, ye Generation of Vipers, How can you escape the Damna∣tion of Hell?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. How indeed, except ye be born again! For ye are now dead in Trespasses and Sins. To say then, that ye cannot be born again, That there is no New-birth but in Baptism, is to seal you all under Damnation, to consign you to Hell, without Help, without Hope. And perhaps some may think this just and right. In their Zeal for the Lord of Hosts, they may say, "Yea, cut off the Sinners, the <HI>Amelekites!</HI> Let these <HI>Gibeonites</HI> be utterly de∣stroyed! They deserve no less."—No; nor I: nor you.—Mine and your Desert, as well as theirs, is Hell. And it is more Mercy, free undeserved Mer∣cy, that <HI>we</HI> are not now in unquenchable Fire. You will say, "But we are washed, we were born
<PB N="290" REF="028060_0277_0FD62876F2CC1AC8"/>again of Water and of the Spirit." So <HI>were</HI> they. This therefore hinders not at all, but that ye may <HI>now</HI> be even as they. Know ye not, that <HI>what is highly esteemed of Men is an Abomination in the Sight of</HI> God? Come forth, ye "Saints of the World." ye that are honoured of Men, and see who will cast the first Stone at them, at these Wretches, not fit to live upon the Earth, these common Harlots, Adultevers, Murderers. Only learn ye first what that meaneth,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John ili. 15.</NOTE> <HI>He that hateth his Brother is a Mur∣derer.</HI> —<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matt, v. 28.</NOTE> <HI>He that looketh on a Woman to lust after her, hath committed Adultery with her already in his Heart.</HI> —<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">James iv. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Ye Adulterers and Adulteresses, know ye not, that the Friendship of the World, is Enmity with</HI> God?</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Verily, verily I say unto you, ye</HI> also <HI>must be born again. Except</HI> ye also <HI>be born again, ye cannot see the Kingdom of</HI> God. Lean no more on the Staff of that broken Reed, that ye <HI>were</HI> born again in Baptism. Ye are now Children of the De∣vil. Therefore ye must be born again. And let not <HI>Satan</HI> put it into your Heart, to cavil at a Word, when the Thing is clear. Ye have heard, what are the Marks of the Children of God: All ye who have them not on your Souls, baptized or unbaptized, must needs receive them, or without Doubt ye will perish everlastingly. And if ye have been baptized, your only Hope is this, That those who were sederally made the Chil∣dren of God by Baptism, but are now the Children of the Devil, may yet receive <HI>Power, to become the Sons of</HI> God: That they may receive even the <HI>Spi∣rit of Adoption, crying in their Hearts, Abba, Fa∣ther!</HI></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="291" REF="028060_0278_0FD68C888DCF85C0"/>
6. Amen, LORD JESUS! May every one who prepareth his Heart to seek thy Face, receive now that Spirit of Adoption, and cry out, Ab∣ba, Father! Let him now have Power, so to believe in thy Name, as to become the Child of God; as to know and feel he hath <HI>Redemption in thy Blood, even the Forgiveness of Sins,</HI> and that he <HI>cannot commit Sin, because he is born of</HI> God. Let him be now <HI>begotten again unto a living Hope,</HI> so as to <HI>purify himself, as Thou art pure!</HI> And <HI>because he is a Son,</HI> let the Spirit of Love and of Glory rest upon him, cleansing him <HI>from all Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit,</HI> and teaching him to <HI>perfect Holiness in the Fear of</HI> God!</P>

<HEAD>The great Privilege of those that are born of God. A SERMON On 1 JOHN iii. 9.</HEAD>
<PB N="5" REF="028060_0281_0FD68C8B1571CAB8"/>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>1 JOHN iii. 9.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Whosoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. IT has been frequently supposed, that the being born of God was all one with the being justified; that the new birth and justifica∣tion were only different expressions, denoting the same thing: It being certain on the one hand, that whoever is justified, is also born of God; and on the other, that whoever is born of God, is al∣so justified: Yea, that both these gifts of God are given to every believer in one and the same mo∣ment. In one point of time his sins are blotted out, and he is born again of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. But though it be also wed, that justification and the new birth are in point of time inseparable from each other, yet are they easily distinguished, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being not the same, but things of a widely dif∣ferent nature. Justification implies only a relative, the new birth a real change. God in justifying us, does something <HI>for</HI> us: In begetting us again, he does the work <HI>in</HI> us. The former changes our outward relation to God, so that of enemies we become children. By the latter our inmost souls are changed, so that of sinners we become saints.
<PB N="6" REF="028060_0282_0FD68C8D05FE35D0"/>The one restores us to the favour, the other to the image of God. The one is, the taking away the guilt, the other, the taking away the power of sin. So that although they are joined together in point of time, yet are they of wholly distinct natures.</P>
<P N="3">3. The not discerning this, the not observing the wide difference there is, between being justi∣fied and being born again, has occasioned exceed∣ing great confusion of thought, in many who have treated on this subject: particularly when they have attempted to explain this great privilege of the children of God; to shew how <HI>whosoever is born of</HI> God, <HI>doth not commit sin.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. In order to apprehend this clearly, it may be necessary, first, to consider what is the proper meaning of that expression, <HI>Whosoever is born of</HI> God; and, secondly, to enquire, in what sense he <HI>doth not commit sin.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. 1. First, we are to consider, what is the proper meaning of that expression, <HI>Whosoever is born of</HI> God. And in general, from all the pas∣sages of holy writ, wherein this expression, the being <HI>born of</HI> God, occurs, we may learn that it implies not barely the being baptized, or any outward change whatever; but a vast inward change, a change wrought in the soul, by the operation of the Holy Ghost: a change in the whole manner of our existence; for from the moment we are <HI>born of</HI> God, we live in quite ano∣ther manner than we did before; we are, as it were, in another world.</P>
<P N="2">2. The ground and reason of the expression, his easy to be understood. When we under go this
<PB N="7" REF="028060_0283_0FD68C8F1A221428"/>great change, we may with much propriety be said <HI>to be born again,</HI> because there is so near a re∣semblance between the circumstances of the na∣tural and of the spiritual birth: so that to consider the circumstances of the natural birth, is the most easy way to understand the spiritual.</P>
<P N="3">3. The child which is not yet born, subsists in∣deed by the air, as does every thing which has life; but <HI>feels</HI> it not, nor any thing else, unless in a very dull and imperfect manner. It <HI>hears</HI> lit∣tle, if at all, the organs of hearing being as yet closed up. It <HI>sees</HI> nothing, having its eyes fast shut, and being surrounded with utter darkness, There are, it may be, some saint beginnings of life, when the time of its birth draws nigh; and some motion consequent thereon, whereby it is distinguished from a mere mass of matter. But it has no <HI>senses;</HI> all these avenues of the soul are hitherto quite shut up. Of consequence, it has scarce any intercourse with this visible world: nor any knowledge, conception, or idea, of the things that occur therein.</P>
<P N="4">4. The reason why he that is not yet born, is wholly a stranger to the visible world, is, not be∣cause it is afar off. It is very nigh. It surrounde him on every side. But partly, because he has not those senses, they are not yet opened in his soul, whereby alone it is possible to hold com∣merce with the material world; and partly be∣cause so thick a veil is cast between, thro' which he can discern nothing.</P>
<P N="5">5. But no sooner is the child born into the world, than he exists in a quite different man∣ner. He now <HI>feels</HI> the air with which he is surrounded, and which pours into him from
<PB N="8" REF="028060_0284_0FD68C917A3BD640"/>every side, as fast as he alternately breathes it back, to sustain the flame of life. And hence springs a continual increase of strength, of mo∣tion and of sensation: all the bodily senses being now awakened, and furnished with their proper objects.</P>
<P>His eyes are now opened to perceive the light, which silently flowing in upon them, dis∣covers not only itself, but an insinite variety of things, with which before he was wholly unacquainted. His ears are unclosed, and sounds rush in, with endless diversity. Every, sense is employed upon such objects as are peculiarly suitable to it. And by these inlets, the soul having an open intercourse with the visible world, acquires more and more knowledge of sensible things, of all the things which are under the sun.</P>
<P N="6">6. So it is with him that is born of God. Before that great change is wrought, although he subsists by him, in whom all that have life <HI>live and move and have their being,</HI> yet he is not <HI>sensible</HI> of God; he does not <HI>feel,</HI> he has no in∣ward consciousness of his presence. He does not perceive that divine breath of life, with∣out which he cannot subsist a moment. Nor is he sensible of any of the things of God. They make no impression upon his soul. God is con∣tinually calling to him from on high, but he heareth not; his ears are shut; so that <HI>the voice of the charmer</HI> is lost to him, <HI>charm he n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r so wisely.</HI> He seeth not the things of the spirit of God, the eyes of his understanding being closed, and utter darkness covering his whole soul, surrounding him on every side. It is true, he
<PB N="9" REF="028060_0285_0FD68C95A24C0780"/>may have some saint dawnings of life, some small beginnings of spiritual motion; but as yet he has no spiritual senses, capable of discerning spiritual objects. Consequently he <HI>discerneth not the things of the spirit of</HI> God. <HI>He cannot know them; be∣cause they are spiritually discerned.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Hence he has scarce any knowledge of the invisible world, as he has scarce any inter∣course with it. Not that it is afar off. No: he is in the midst of it: it encompasses him round about. The <HI>other world,</HI> as we usually term it, is not far from every one of us. It is above, and beneath, and on every side. On∣ly the natural man discerneth it not; partly, be∣cause he has no spiritual senses, whereby alone we can discern the things of God; partly, because so thick a veil is interposed, as he knows not how to penetrate.</P>
<P N="8">8. But when he is born of God, born of the Spirit, how is the manner of his existence chang∣ed? his whole soul is now sensible of God, and he can say by sure experience, <HI>thou art a∣bout my bed, and about my path;</HI> I feel thee <HI>in all my ways.</HI> Thou <HI>besettest me behind and be∣fore, and layest thy hand upon me.</HI> The spirit or breath of God is immediately inspired, breathed into the new-born soul. And the same breath which comes from, returns to God: as it is con∣tinually received by faith, so it is continually rendered back by love, by prayer, an praise, and thanksgiving: love and praise and prayer being the breath of every soul which is truly born of God. And by this new kind of spiri∣tual respiration, spiritual life is not only sustained, but increased day by day; together with spiritual
<PB N="10" REF="028060_0286_0FD68C9727002D38"/>strength and motion, and sensation. All the senses of the soul be now awake, and capable of <HI>discerning</HI> spiritual <HI>good and evil.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>The eyes of his understanding</HI> are now <HI>open,</HI> and he <HI>seeth him that is invisible.</HI> He sees what is <HI>the exceeding greatness of his power,</HI> and of his love toward them that believe. He sees that God is merciful to him a sinner; that he is reconciled through the son of his love. He clearly perceives both the pardoning love of God, and all his <HI>exceeding great and precious promises.</HI> God <HI>who commandeth the light to shine out of dark∣ness, hath shined,</HI> and doth shine, <HI>in</HI> his <HI>heart, to enlighten him with the knowledge of the Glory of</HI> God, <HI>in the face of</HI> Jesus Christ. All the dark∣ness is now passed away, and he abides in the light of God's countenance.</P>
<P N="10">10. His ears are now opened, and the voice of God no longer calls in vain. He hears and obeys the heavenly calling: He <HI>knows the voice of his shepherd.</HI> All his spiritual senses being now awakened, he has a clear intercourse with the in∣visible world. And hence he knows more and more of the things which before <HI>it could not enter into his heart to conceive.</HI> He now knows what the peace of God is: what is joy in the Holy Ghost: what the love of God which is shed abroad in the hearts of them that believe in him thro' <HI>Christ Jesus.</HI> Thus the veil being removed, which before interrupted the light and voice, the know∣ledge and love of God, he who is born of the spirit, <HI>dwelling in love, dwelleth in</HI> God <HI>and</HI> God <HI>in him.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="11" REF="028060_0287_0FD68C9A1E072DF8"/>
II. 1. Having considered the meaning of that expression, <HI>whosoever is born of God,</HI> it remains in the second place to enquire, in what sense he <HI>doth not commit sin.</HI></P>
<P>Now one who is so born of God as hath been above described, who continually receives into his soul the breath of life from God, the graci∣ous influence of his Spirit, and continually ren∣ders it back: one who thus believes and loves; who by faith perceives the continual actings of God upon his spirit; and by a kind of spiritual re∣action, returns the grace he receives in unceas∣ing love, and praise, and prayer; not only <HI>doth not commit sin</HI> while <HI>he</HI> thus <HI>keepeth himself;</HI> but so long as this <HI>seed remaineth in him,</HI> he <HI>cannot sin,</HI> because he is born of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. By <HI>sin,</HI> I here understand, outward sin, according to the plain, common acceptation of the word: an actual, voluntary <HI>transgression of the law;</HI> of the revealed, written law of God: of any commandment of God, acknowledged to be such, at the time that it is transgressed. But <HI>whosoever is born of God,</HI> while he abideth in faith and love, and in the spirit of prayer and thanksgiving, not only <HI>doth not,</HI> but <HI>cannot</HI> thus <HI>commit sin.</HI> So long as he thus believeth in God through Christ, and loves him, and is pouring out his heart before him, he cannot vo∣luntarily transgress any command of God, ei∣ther by speaking or acting what he knows God hath forbidden. So long that <HI>seed</HI> which <HI>re∣maineth in him,</HI> that loving, praying, thankful faith compels him to refrain from whatsoever he knows to be an abomination in the sight of God.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="12" REF="028060_0288_0FD68C9B9347FD48"/>
3. But here a difficulty will immediately occur; and one, that to many has appeared insuperable, and induced them to deny the plain assertion of the apostle, and give up the privilege of the children of God.</P>
<P>It is plain in fact, that those whom we cannot deny to have been truly <HI>born of</HI> God (the spirit of God having given us in his word, this infalli∣ble testimony concerning them) nevertheless not only could, but did commit sin, even gross, out∣ward sin. They did transgress the plain, known laws of God, speaking or acting what they knew he had forbidden.</P>
<P N="4">4. Thus <HI>David</HI> was unquestionably born of God, or ever he was anointed king over <HI>Israel.</HI> He knew in whom he had believed; he was strong in faith, giving glory to God.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxiii. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>The</HI> Lord, saith he, <HI>is my shepherd; therefore can I lack nothing. He shall feed me in green pas∣tures, and lead me forth beside the waters of com∣fort.</HI> Yea, <HI>though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me.</HI> He was filled with love; such as often constrained him to cry out,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. xviii. 1.</NOTE> <HI>I will love thee, O</HI> Lord, <HI>my</HI> God: <HI>the</HI> Lord <HI>is my stony rock, and my defence: the born al∣so of my salvation, and my refuge.</HI> He was a man of prayer, pouring out his soul before God, in all circumstances of life; and abun∣dant in praises and thanksgiving;<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxxiv. 1.</NOTE> <HI>thy praise,</HI> faith he, <HI>shall be ever in my mouth.</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxviii. 28.</NOTE> <HI>Thou art my</HI> God, <HI>and I will thank thee; thou art my</HI> God <HI>and I will praise thee.</HI> And yet such a child of God
<PB N="13" REF="028060_0289_0FD68CA0F9FEE898"/>could and did commit sin; yea, the horrid sins of adultery and murder.</P>
<P N="5">5. And even after the Holy Ghost was more largely given, after <HI>life and immortality</HI> were <HI>brought to light by the gospel,</HI> we want not instances of the same melancholy kind, which were also doubtless written for our instruction. Thus he who (proba∣bly from his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts iv. 36, 37.</NOTE> <HI>selling</HI> all that he had, and <HI>bringing the price</HI> for the relief of his poor brethren) was <HI>by the apostles</HI> themselves <HI>sirnamed</HI> Barnabas, that is, <HI>the son of consolation;</HI> who was so honoured at <HI>Antioch,</HI> as to be selected with <HI>Saul</HI> out of all <HI>the disciples,</HI> to carry their<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ch. xi. 29.</NOTE> <HI>relief unto the brethren in</HI> Judea: this <HI>Barnabas,</HI> who at his return from <HI>Judea,</HI> was by the peculiar direction of the Holy Ghost, solemnly<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ch. xiii. 1, 2, 4.</NOTE> <HI>separated from the</HI> other <HI>prophets and teachers, for the work whereunto God had called him,</HI> even to accompany the great apostle among the gentiles, and to be his fellow-labourer in every place; nevertheless was afterward so<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ch. xv. 35, 38, 39.</NOTE> <HI>sharp</HI> in his <HI>contention</HI> with St. <HI>Paul</HI> (because he <HI>thought it not good to take with them</HI> John, in his <HI>visiting the bre∣thren,</HI> a second time, <HI>who had departed from them from</HI> Pamphylia, <HI>and went not with them to the work</HI>) that he himself also departed from the work; that he <HI>took</HI> John, <HI>and sailed unto</HI> Cyprus; forsaking him to whom he had been in so imme∣diate a manner joined by the Holy Ghost.</P>
<P N="6">6. An instance more astonishing than both these is given by St. <HI>Paul</HI> in his epistle to the <HI>Galatians. When</HI> Peter, the aged, the zealous, the first of the apostles, one of the three most highly favoured by his Lord; <HI>was come to</HI> Antioch, <HI>I withstood him to
<PB N="14" REF="028060_0290_0FD68CA267AE5EF8"/>the face, because he was to be blamed. For before that certain came from</HI> James, <HI>he did eat with the gentiles,</HI> the heathens converted to the christian faith, as having been peculiarly taught of God, that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xi. 28.</NOTE> he <HI>should not call any man common or unclean.</HI> But<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gal. ii. 11, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>when they were come, he separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision. And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that</HI> Barnabas <HI>also was carried away with their dissimula∣tion. But when I saw that they walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto</HI> Peter <HI>before them all, if thou being a Jew, livest after the manner of the gentiles,</HI> not regarding the ceremonial law of <HI>Moses, why compellest thou the gentiles to live as do the Jews?</HI> here is also plain, undeniable sin, committed by one who was undoubtedly <HI>born of God.</HI> But how can this be reconciled with the asser∣tion of St. <HI>John,</HI> if taken in the obvious literal meaning, that <HI>whosoever is born of God, doth not commit sin?</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. I answer, what has been long observed is this: so long as <HI>he that is born of God keepeth himself</HI> (which he is able to do, by the grace of God) <HI>the wicked one toucheth him not.</HI> But if he keepeth not himself, if he abide not in the faith, he may com∣mit sin even as another man.</P>
<P>It is easy therefore to understand, how any of these children of God might be moved from his own stedfastness, and yet the great truth of God, declared by the apostle, remain stedfast and unshaken. He did not <HI>keep himself</HI> by that grace of God which was sufficient for him. He fell, step by step, first, into negative, inward sin, not <HI>stirring up the gift of God</HI> which was in him,
<PB N="15" REF="028060_0291_0FD68CA58E9E4B58"/>not <HI>watching unto prayer,</HI> not <HI>pressing on to the mark of the prize of his high calling:</HI> then into positive inward sin, inclining to wickedness with his heart, giving way to some evil desire or temper. Next, he lost his faith, his sight of a pardoning God, and consequently his love of God. And being then weak and like another man, he was capable of committing even outward sin.</P>
<P N="8">8. To explain this by a particular instance: <HI>Da∣vid</HI> was born of God, and saw God by faith. He loved God in sincerity. He could truly say, <HI>whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth</HI> (neither person, nor thing) <HI>that I desire in comparison of thee!</HI> but still there remained in his heart that corruption of nature, which is the seed of all evil.</P>
<P>He was<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xi. 2.</NOTE> <HI>walking upon the roof of his house,</HI> pro∣bably praising the God whom his soul loved, when he looked down and saw <HI>Bathsheba.</HI> He felt a temptation, a thought which tended to evil. The spirit of God did not fail to convince him of this. He doubtless heard and knew the warning voice. But he yielded in some measure to the thought, and the temptation began to prevail over him. Hereby his spirit was sullied; he saw God still; but it was more dimly than before. He loved God still; but not in the same degree, not with the same strength and ardor of affection. Yet God checked him again, though his spirit was grieved; and his voice, though fainter and fainter, still whispered, "Sin lieth at the door; look unto me, and be thou saved." But he would not hear. He looked again, not unto God, but unto the forbidden object, till nature was supe∣rior to grace, and kindled lust in his soul.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="028060_0292_0FD68CA6BA118638"/>
The eye of his mind was now closed again, and God vanished out of his sight. Faith, the divine supernatural intercourse with God, and the love of God ceased together. He then rust. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on as a horse into the battle, and knowingly com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed the outward sin.</P>
<P N="9">9. You see the unquestionable progress from grace to sin. Thus it goes on, from step to step.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The divine seed of loving, conquering faith, remains in him that is <HI>born of God. He keepeth himself,</HI> by the grace of God, and <HI>cannot commit sin.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A temptation arises, whether from the world, the flesh, or the devil, it matters not.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The spirit of God gives him warning that sin is near, and bids him more abundantly watch unto prayer.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. He gives way in some degree to the tempta∣tion, which now begins to grow pleasing to him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The Holy Spirit is grieved; his saith is weak∣ened, and his love of God grows cold,</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The spirit reproves him more sharply, and saith, "This is the way; walk thou in it."</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. He turns away from the painful voice of God, and listens to the pleasing voice of the tempter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. Evil desire vanish away. He is then capable of committing outward sin, the power of the Lord being depart∣ed from him.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="10">10. To explain this by another instance. The apostle <HI>Peter</HI> was full of faith and of the Holy Ghost; and hereby keeping himself, he had a con∣science void of offence toward God and toward man.</P>
<P>Walking thus in simplicity and godly sincerity, <HI>before that certain came from</HI> James, <HI>he did eat with the gentiles,</HI> knowing that what God had cleansed, was not common or unclean.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="028060_0293_0FD68CA79A66E170"/>
But <HI>when they were come,</HI> a temptation arose in his heart, <HI>to fear those of the circumcision</HI> (the Jew∣ish converts, who were zealous for circumcisron and the other rites of the Mosaic law) and regard the favour and praise of these men, more than the praise of God.</P>
<P>He was warned by the spirit that sin was near. Nevertheless he yielded to it in some degree, even to sinful fear of man, and his faith and love were proportionably weakened.</P>
<P>God reproved him again for giving place to the devil. Yet he would not hearken to the voice of his shepherd; but gave himself up to that flavish fear, and thereby quenched the spirit.</P>
<P>Then God disappeared, and faith and love be∣ing extinct, he committed the outward sin. <HI>Walk∣ing not uprightly,</HI> not <HI>according to the truth of the gospel,</HI> he <HI>separated himself</HI> from his christian bre∣thren, and by his evil example, if not advice also, <HI>compelled</HI> even <HI>the</HI> Gentiles <HI>to live after the manner of the</HI> Jews; to entangle themselves again with that <HI>yoke of bondage,</HI> from which <HI>Christ had set them free.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it is unquestionably true, that he who is born of God, keeping himself, doth not, cannot commit sin; and yet, if he keepeth not himself, he may commit all manner of sin with greediness.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. From the preceding considerations we may learn, first, To give a clear and uncontestible answer, to a question which has frequently per∣plexed many, who were sincere of heart. Does sin precede or follow the loss of faith? "Does a child of God first commit sin, and thereby lose his faith? Or does he lose his faith first, before he can commit sin?"</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="028060_0294_0FD68CABC6EA7648"/>
I answer, some sin of omission at least, must necessarily precede the loss of faith: some inward sin. But the loss of saith must precede the com∣mitting outward sin.</P>
<P>The more any believer examines his own heart, the more will he be convinced of this: That <HI>faith working by love,</HI> excludes both inward and out∣ward sin from a soul <HI>watching unto prayer:</HI> that nevertheless we are even then liable to tempta∣tion, particularly to the sin that did easily beset us: that if the loving eye of the soul be steadily fixed on God, the temptation soon vanishes away: but if not, if we are<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James i. 14.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (as the apostle James speaks) <HI>drawn out</HI> of God by our <HI>own de∣sire,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>caught by the bait</HI> of present or promised pleasure: then that <HI>desire conceived</HI> in us, <HI>brings forth sin;</HI> and having by that inward sin destroyed our faith, it casts us headlong into the snare of the devil, so that we may commit any outward sin whatever.</P>
<P N="2">2. From what has been said, we may learn, secondly, what the life of God in the soul of a believer is; wherein it properly consists; and what is immediately and necessarily implied therein. It immediately and necessarily implies, the continual inspiration of God's Holy Spirit: God's breath∣ing into the soul, and the soul's breathing back what it first receives from God: a continual ac∣tion of God upon the soul, and re-action of the soul upon God: an unceasing presence of God, the loving, pardoning God, manifested to the heart, and perceived by faith; and an unceasing return of love, praise, and prayer, offering up all the thoughts of our hearts, all the words of our
<PB N="19" REF="028060_0295_0FD68CAED55F9E60"/>tongues, all the works of our hands, all our bo∣dy, soul, and spirit, to be an holy sacrifice, ac∣ceptable unto God in Christ Jesus.</P>
<P N="3">3. And hence we may, thirdly, infer, the ab∣solute necessity of this re-action of the soul (whatsoever it be called) in order to the continu∣ance of the divine life therein. For it plainly appears, God does not continue to act upon the soul, unless the soul re-acts upon God. He pre∣vents us indeed with the blessings of his good∣ness. He first loves us, and manifests himself unto us. While we are yet afar off, he calls us to himself, and shines upon our hearts. But if we do not then love him who first loved us, if we will not hearken to his voice; if we turn our eye away from him, and will not attend to the light which he pours upon us, his spirit will not always strive; he will gradually withdraw, and leave us to the darkness of our own hearts. He will not continue to breathe into our soul, unless our soul breathes toward him again; unless our love, and prayer, and thanksgiving return to him, a sacrifice wherewith he is well pleased.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let us learn, lastly, to follow that directi∣on of the great apostle, <HI>Be not high minded, but fear.</HI> Let us fear sin more than death or hell. Let us have a jealous (tho' not painful) fear, lest we should lean to our own deceitful hearts. <HI>Let him that standeth take heed lest he fall.</HI> Even he who now standeth fast in the grace of God, in the <HI>faith</HI> that <HI>overcometh the world,</HI> may nevertheless fall into inward sin, and thereby <HI>make shipwreck of his faith.</HI> And how easily then will outward sin regain its dominion over him? Thou therefore, O man of God, watch always; that thou mayest
<PB N="20" REF="028060_0296_0FD68CAFD7D541E0"/>always hear the voice of God. Watch that thou mayest pray without ceasing, at all times and in all places, pouring out thy heart before him. So shalt thou always believe, and always love, and never commit sin.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>MATT. v. 1, 2, 3, 4.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And seeing the Multitudes, he went up into a Mountain; and when he was set, his Disciples came unto him:</P>
<P>And he opened his Mouth, and taught them, saying,</P>
<P>Blessed are the Poor in Spirit; for their's is the Kingdom of Heaven.</P>
<P>Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be com∣forted.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>OUR Lord had now <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. iv. 23.</NOTE> <HI>gone about all</HI> Galilee, beginning at the time<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ver. 12.</NOTE> <HI>when</HI> John <HI>was cast into prison,</HI> not only <HI>teaching in their syna∣gogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom,</HI> but likewise <HI>healing all manner of sickness, and all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anner of disease among the people.</HI> It was a natu∣ral consequence of this, that<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ver. 25.</NOTE> <HI>there followed him great multitudes from</HI> Galilee, <HI>and from</HI> Decapolis, <HI>and from</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>and from</HI> Judea, <HI>and from the region beyond</HI> Jordan.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Matt. v. 1, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>And seeing the multitudes,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="028060_0299_0FD68CB757DBF0D0"/>whom no synagogue could contain, even had there been any at hand, <HI>he went up into a moun∣tain,</HI> where there was room for all that <HI>came unto him from every quarter. And when he was set,</HI> as the manner of the Jews was, <HI>his disci∣ples came unto him. And he opened his mouth</HI> (an expression denoting the beginning of a solemn discourse) <HI>and taught them, saying—</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Let us observe, who it is, that is here speak∣ing, that we may <HI>take heed how</HI> we <HI>hear.</HI> It is the Lord of heaven and earth, the Creator of all, who as such, has a right to dispose of all his creatures; the Lord our governor, whose kingdom is from everlasting, and ruleth over all; the great lawgiver, who can well enforce all his laws, being <HI>able to save and to destroy;</HI> yea, to punish with everlasting destruction from his presence and from the glory of his power. It is the eternal wisdom of the Father, who knoweth whereof we are made, and understands our inmost frame; who knows how we stand related to God, to one another, to every crea∣ture which God hath made; and consequently how to adapt every law he prescribes, to all the circumstances wherein he hath placed us. It is he who is <HI>loving unto every man, whose mercy is over all his works:</HI> The God of love, who having emptied himself of his eternal glory, is come forth from his Father, to declare his will to the children of men, and then goeth again to the Father: who is sent of God <HI>to open the eyes of the blind, to give light to them that fit in darkness:</HI> it is the great prophet of the Lord, concerning whom God had solemnly declared
<PB N="25" REF="028060_0300_0FD68CB8D240F558"/>long ago,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. xviii. 19.</NOTE> <HI>Whosoever will not hearken unto my words, which he shall speak in my name, I will re∣quire it of him.</HI> Or, as the apostle expresses it,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts iii. 23.</NOTE> <HI>Every soul which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. And what is it which he is teaching? The Son of God, who came from heaven, is here shewing us the way to heaven, to the place which he hath prepared for us, the glory he had before the world began. He is teaching us the true way to life everlasting, the royal way which leads to the kingdom. And the only true way; for there is none besides: all other paths lead to destruction. From the character of the speaker we are well assured, that he hath declared the full and perfect will of God. He hath utter∣ed not one tittle too much; nothing more than he had received of the Father. Nor too little; he hath not shunned to declare the whole coun∣sel of God. Much less hath he uttered any thing wrong, any thing contrary to the will of him that sent him. All his words are true, and right, concerning all things, and shall stand fast for ever and ever.</P>
<P>And we may easily remark, that in explaining and confirming these faithful and true sayings, he takes care to refute not only the mistakes of the Scribes and Pharisees which then were, the false comments whereby the Jewish teachers of that age had perverted the word of God; but all the practical mistakes, that are inconsistent
<PB N="26" REF="028060_0301_0FD68CBE90A36258"/>with salvation, which should ever arise in the Christian church: all the comments whereby the Christian teachers (so called) of any age or nation should pervert the word of God, and teach unwary souls to seek death in the error of their life.</P>
<P N="4">4. And hence we are naturally led to observe, whom it is that he is here teaching? Not the apostles alone; if so, he had no need to have gone <HI>up into the mountain.</HI> A room in the house of Matthew, or any of his disciples, would have contained the twelve. Nor does it in any wise appear, that the <HI>disciples</HI> who <HI>came unto him,</HI> were the twelve only. O <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, with∣out any force put upon the expression, may be understood, of all who desired to <HI>learn of him.</HI> But to put this out of all question, to make it undeniably plain that where it is said, <HI>He opened his mouth and taught them,</HI> the word <HI>them</HI> in∣cludes all the multitudes, who went up with him into the mountain, we need only observe the concluding verses of the seventh chapter, <HI>And it came to pass, when</HI> Jesus <HI>had ended these sayings, the multitudes,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>were astonished at his doctrine</HI> (or teaching). <HI>For he taught</HI> them (the multitudes) <HI>as one having authority, and not as the scribes.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was it only those multitudes who were with him on the mount, to whom he now taught the way of salvation; but all the children of men, the whole race of mankind, the children that were yet unborn; all the generations to come even to the end of the world, who should ever hear the words of this life.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="27" REF="028060_0302_0FD68CBF9CD224B0"/>
5. And this all men allow, with regard to some parts of the ensuing discourse. No man, for in∣stance, denies, that what is said of <HI>poverty of spirit,</HI> relates to all mankind. But many have supposed, that other parts concerned only the apostles, or the first christians, or the ministers of <HI>Christ;</HI> and were never designed for the generality of men, who consequently, have nothing at all to do with them.</P>
<P>But may we not justly enquire, who told them this? that some parts of this discourse, concern∣ed only the apostles? or the christians of the apostolic age? or the ministers of <HI>Christ?</HI> bare assertions are not a sufficient proof, to establish a point of so great importance. Has then our Lord himself taught us, that some parts of his discourse, do not concern all mankind? without doubt, had it been so, he would have told us; he could not have omitted so necessary an informa∣tion. But has he told us so? where? in the dis∣course itself? no: here is not the least intimati∣on of it. Has he said so elsewhere? in any other of his discourses? not one word so much as glanc∣ing this way, can we find in any thing he ever spoke, either to the multitudes or to his disciples. Has any of the apostles, or other inspired writers, left such an instruction upon record? no such thing. No assertion of this kind is to be found in all the oracles of God. Who then are the men who are so much wiser than God? wise, so far above that is written?</P>
<P N="6">6. Perhaps they will say, "That the reason of the thing requires such a restriction to be made." If it does, it must be on one of these
<PB N="28" REF="028060_0303_0FD68CC1144967B8"/>two accounts; because without such a restricti∣on, the discourse would either be apparently ab∣surd, or would contradict some other scripture, But this is not the case. It will plainly appear, when we come to examine the several particulars, that there is no absurdity at all in applying all which our Lord hath here delivered, to all man∣kind. Neither will it infer any contradiction to any thing else he has delivered, nor to any other scripture whatever. Nay, it will farther appear, that either all the parts of this discourse are to be applied to men in general; or no part; see∣ing they are all connected together, all joined as the stones in an arch, of which you cannot take one away, without destroying the whole fabric.</P>
<P N="7">7. We may, lastly, observe, how our Lord teaches here. And surely, as at all times, so particularly at this he speaks, <HI>as never man spake.</HI> Not as the holy men of old; altho' they also spoke <HI>as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</HI> Not as Peter or James, or John or Paul. They were indeed wife master-builders in his church. But still in this, in the degrees of heavenly wis∣dom, the servant is not as his Lord. No, nor even as himself, at any other time, or on any other occasion. It does not appear, that it was ever his design, at any other time or place, to lay down at once the whole plan of his reli∣gion, to give us a full prospect of christianity, to describe at large the nature of that holiness without which no man shall see the Lord. Par∣ticular branches of this he has indeed described, on a thousand different occasions. But never besides here, did he give, of set purpose, a ge∣neral
<PB N="29" REF="028060_0304_0FD68CC2A9197430"/>view of the whole. Nay, we have no∣thing else of this kind in all the bible: unless one should except that short sketch of holiness, delivered by God in those ten words or com∣mandments, to <HI>Moses,</HI> on mount <HI>Sinai.</HI> But even here how wide a difference is there between one and the other? <HI>Even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth,</HI> 2 Cor. iii. 10.</P>
<P N="8">8. Above all, with what amazing love does the son of God, here reveal his Father's will to man! he does not bring us <HI>again to the mount that burned with fire, nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest.</HI> He does not speak as when he <HI>thundered out of heaven, when the Highest gave his thunder, hail-stones and coals of fire.</HI> He now addresses us with his still, small voice. <HI>Blessed</HI> or happy <HI>are the poor in spirit.</HI> Happy are the mourners, the meek; those that hunger after righteousness; the merciful, the pure in heart: happy in the end and in the way; happy in this life, and in life everlasting! as if he had said, who is he that lusteth to live, and would fain see good days? behold, I shew you the thing which your soul longeth for; see the way you have so long sought in vain! the way of plea∣santness; the path to calm, joyous peace, to heaven below and heaven above!</P>
<P N="9">9. At the same time with what authority does he teach! well might they say, <HI>not as the scribes.</HI> Observe the manner (but it cannot be expressed in words) the air, with which he speaks! not as <HI>Moses,</HI> the servant of God: not as <HI>Abraham,</HI> his friend; not as any of the prophets; nor as any
<PB N="30" REF="028060_0305_0FD68CC9AFCFFD80"/>of the sons of men. It is something more than human; more than can agree to any created being. It speaks the creator of all, a God, a God appears! Yea, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the Being of beings, <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the self-existent, the supreme, the God who is over all, blessed for ever!</P>
<P N="10">10. This discourse, delivered in the most ex∣cellent method, every subsequent part illustrat∣ing those that precede, is commonly, and not improperly divided, into three principal bran∣ches: the first contained in the fifth, the se∣cond in the sixth, and the third in the seventh chapter. In the first, the sum of all true reli∣gion is laid down in eight particulars, which are explained and guarded against the false glosses of man, in the following parts of the fifth chap∣ter, In the second are rule, for that right inten∣tion, which we are to preserve in all our out∣ward actions; unmixed with worldly desires, or anxious cares for even the necessaries of life. In the third, are cautions against the main hin∣drances of religion, closed with an application of the whole.</P>
<P N="1">I. 1. Our Lord, first, lays down the sum of all true religion in eight particulars, which he explains and guards against the false glosses of men to the end of the fifth chapter.</P>
<P>Some have supposed that he designed in these, to point out the several stages of the christian course; the steps which a christian successively takes in his journey to the Promised Land; o∣thers, that all the particulars here set down, be∣long at all times to every christian: and why may we not allow both the one and the other? what
<PB N="31" REF="028060_0306_0FD68CCAD6222728"/>inconsistency is there between them? It is un∣doubtedly true, that both <HI>poverty of spirit</HI> and every other tempter which is here mentioned, are at all times found, in a greater or less de∣gree, in every real christian. And it is equally true, that real christianity always begins in po∣verty of spirit, and goes on in the order here set down, till the <HI>man of God</HI> is made <HI>perfect.</HI> We begin at the lowest of these gifts of God; yet so as not to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inquish this, when we are called of God, to come up higher: But <HI>where∣unto we have already attained, we hold fast,</HI> while we <HI>press on</HI> to what is yet <HI>behind,</HI> to the highest blessings of God in Christ Jesus.</P>
<P N="2">2. The foundation of all is <HI>poverty of spirit:</HI> here therefore our Lord begins: <HI>Blessed,</HI> saith he, <HI>are the poor in spirit, for their's is the kingdom of heaven.</HI></P>
<P>It may not improbably be supposed, that our Lord, looking on those who were round about him, and observing that not many rich were there, but rather the poor of the world, took oc∣casion from thence to make a transition from temporal to spiritual things. <HI>Blessed,</HI> saith he (or <HI>happy;</HI> so the word should be rendered, both in this and the following verses) <HI>are the poor in spirit.</HI> He does not say, they that are <HI>poor</HI> as to <HI>outward circumstances;</HI> it being not impossible that some of these may be as far from happi∣ness, as a monarch upon his throne: but <HI>the poor in spirit,</HI> they who, whatever their outward circumstances are, have that disposition of heart, which is the first step to all real, substantial happiness, either in this world or that which is to come.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="32" REF="028060_0307_0FD68CCCB5765B08"/>
3. Some have judged, That by the <HI>poor in spirit</HI> here, are meant, those who love poverty; those who are free from covetousness; from the love of money; who fear, rather than desire riches. Perhaps they have been induced so to judge, by wholly confining their thought to the very term: or by considering that weighty ob∣servation of St. <HI>Paul, that the love of money is the root of all evil.</HI> And hence many have wholly divested themselves, not only of riches, but of all worldly goods. Hence also the vows of voluntary poverty, seem to have arisen in the <HI>Romish</HI> church: it being supposed that so emi∣nent a degree of this fundamental grace, must be a large step toward <HI>the kingdom of heaven.</HI></P>
<P>But these do not seem to have observed, First, that the expression of St. <HI>Paul</HI> must be under∣stood with some restriction. Otherwise it is not true: for the love of money is not <HI>the root,</HI> the sole root <HI>of all evil.</HI> There are a thousand other roots of evil in the world, as sad experience dai∣ly shews. His meaning can only be, it is the root of very many evils; perhaps of more than any single vice besides: Secondly, that this sense of the expression, <HI>poor in spirit,</HI> will by no means suit our Lord's present design, which is to lay a general foundation whereon the whole fabric of christianity may be built; a design which would be in no wise answered, by guard∣ing against one particular vice: so that, if even this were supposed to be one part of his mean∣ing, it could not possibly be the whole: Thirdly, that it cannot be supposed to be any part of his meaning, unless we charge him with manifest tautology: seeing if <HI>poverty of spirit</HI> were only
<PB N="33" REF="028060_0308_0FD68CCE2F05E720"/>freedom from covetousness, from the love of mo∣ney, or the desire of riches, it would coincide with what he afterwards mentions, it would be only a branch of <HI>purity of heart.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Who then are <HI>the poor in spirit?</HI> Without question, the humble; they who know them∣selves; who are convinced of sin: those to whom God hath given that first repentance, which is previous to faith in Christ.</P>
<P>One of these can no longer say, <HI>I am rich, and increased in goods, and have need of nothing:</HI> as now knowing, that he is <HI>wretched, and poor, and miserable, and blind, and naked.</HI> He is con∣vinced that he is spiritually poor indeed; having no spiritual good abiding in him. <HI>In me,</HI> saith he, <HI>dwelleth no good thing;</HI> but whatsoever is e∣vil and abominable. He has a deep sense of the loathsome leprosy of sin, which he brought with him from his mother's womb, which overspreads his whole soul, and totally corrupts every power and faculty thereof. He sees more and more of the evil tempers, which spring from that evil root: the pride and haughtiness of spirit, the constant bias to think of himself more highly than he ought to think: the vanity, the thirst af∣ter the esteem or honour that cometh from men: the hatred or envy, the jealousy or revenge, the anger, malice, or bitterness; the inbred enmity both against God and man, which appears in ten thousand shapes: the love of the world, the self-will, the foolish and hurtful desires, which cleave to his inmost soul. He is conscious how deeply he has offended by his tongue; if not by profane, immodest, untrue, or unkind words, yet by discourse which was not <HI>good, to the use
<PB N="34" REF="028060_0309_0FD68CCFB30E3890"/>of edifying,</HI> not <HI>meet to minister grace to the bear∣ers;</HI> which consequently was all <HI>corrupt</HI> in God's account, and grievous to his holy spirit. His evil works are now likewise ever in his sight; if he tell them, <HI>they are more than he is able to ex∣press.</HI> He may as well think to number the <HI>drops of rain, the sands of the sea, or the days of eternity.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. His guilt is now also before his face: he knows the punishment he has deserved, were it only on account of his <HI>carnal mind,</HI> the entire, universal corruption of his nature: how much more, on account of all his evil desires and thoughts, of all his sinful words and actions? he cannot doubt for a moment, but the least of these deserves the damnation of hell; <HI>the worm that dieth not, and the fire that never shall be quenched.</HI> Above all, the guilt of <HI>not believing on the name of the only begotten Son of God,</HI> lies hea∣vy upon him. <HI>How,</HI> saith he, <HI>shall</HI> I escape, who <HI>neglect so great Salvation! he that believeth not, is condemned already, and the wrath of God abideth on him.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. But what shall he give in exchange for his soul, which is forfeited to the just vengeance of God? <HI>Wherewithal shall he come before the</HI> Lord? How shall he pay him that he oweth? were he from this moment to perform the most perfect obedience to every command of God, this would make no amends for a single sin, for any one act of past disobedience: seeing he owes God all the service he is able to perform from this moment to all eternity, could he pay this, it would make no manner of amends, for what he ought to have done before. He sees himself
<PB N="35" REF="028060_0310_0FD68CD2557F3068"/>therefore utterly helpless, with regard to atoning for his past sins; utterly unable to make any amends to God, to pay any ransom for his own soul.</P>
<P>But if God would forgive him all that is past, on this one condition, that he should sin no more, that for the time to come he should en∣tirely and constantly obey all his commands: he well knows that this would profit him nothing, being a condition he could never perform. He knows and feels, that he is not able to obey, even the outward commands of God: seeing these cannot be obeyed, while his heart remains in its natural sinfulness and corruption: In as much as an evil tree, cannot bring forth good fruit. But he cannot cleanse a sinful heart, with men this is impossible. So that he is utterly at a loss, even how to begin walking in the path of God's commandments. He knows not how to get one step forward in the way. Incompassed with sin and sorrow, and fear, and finding no way to escape, he can only cry out, Lord <HI>save, or I perish!</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Poverty of spirit</HI> then, as it implies the first step we take in running the race which is set be∣fore us, is, a just sense of our inward and out∣ward sins, and of our guilt and helplessness. This some have monstrously stiled, The <HI>virtue of humility;</HI> thus teaching us to be proud of know∣ing we deserve damnation. But our Lord's expression is quite of another kind; convey∣ing no idea to the hearer, but that of mere want, of naked sin, of helpless guilt and mi∣sery.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="36" REF="028060_0311_0FD68CD25AD4CA28"/>
8. The great apostle, where he endeavours to bring sinners to God, speaks in a manner just answerable to this.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 18, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>The wrath of</HI> God, saith he, <HI>is revealed from heaven, against all ungodli∣ness and unrighteousness of men:</HI> a charge which he immediately fixes on the heathen world, and thereby proves, they were under the wrath of God. He next shews, that the Jews were no better than they, and were therefore under the same condemnation: and all this, not in order to their attaining "The noble virtue of humili∣ty," but <HI>that every mouth might be stopped, and all the world become guilty before</HI> God.</P>
<P>He proceeds to shew, that they were helpless as well as guilty; which is the plain purport of all those expressions, <HI>therefore by the deeds of the law, there shall no flesh be justified—but now the righteousness of</HI> God, <HI>which is by faith, of</HI> Jesus Christ, <HI>without the law is manifested—we con∣clude, that a man is justified by faith, without the deeds of the law:</HI> expressions all tending to the same point, even to <HI>hide pride from man:</HI> to humble him to the dust, without teaching him to reflect upon his humility as a virtue; to in∣spire him with that full piercing conviction of his utter sinfulness, guilt and helplessness, which casts the sinner, stript of all, lost and undone, on his strong helper, Jesus Christ <HI>the righteous.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. One cannot but observe here, that christia∣nity begins, just where heathen morality ends: <HI>poverty of spirit, conviction of sin,</HI> the <HI>renouncing
<PB N="37" REF="028060_0312_0FD68CD5F006E818"/>ourselves,</HI> the <HI>not having our</HI> own <HI>righteousness,</HI> the very first point in the religion of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> leaving all Pagan religion behind. This was ever hid from the wise men of this world: inso∣much that the whole Roman language, even with all the improvements of the Augustan age, does not afford so much as a name for <HI>humility</HI> (the word from whence we borrow this, as is well known, beating in Latin a quite different meaning): no, nor was one found in all the co∣pious language of Greece, till it was <HI>made</HI> by the great apostle.</P>
<P N="10">10. O that we may feel what they were not able to express! sinner, awake! know thyself! know and feel, that thou wert <HI>shapen in wicked∣ness, and that in sin did thy mother conceive</HI> thee, and that thou thyself hast been heaping sin upon sin, ever since thou couldst discern good from e∣vil. Sink under the mighty hand of God, as guil∣ty of death eternal: and cast off, renounce, abhor all imagination, of ever being able to help thy∣self! be it all thy hope to be washed in his blood, and renewed by his almighty spirit, <HI>who himself bare all our sins in his own body on the tree.</HI> So shalt thou witness, <HI>happy are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. This is that <HI>kingdom of heaven or of</HI> God which <HI>is within</HI> us, even <HI>righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</HI> And what is righte∣ness, but the life of God in the soul: the mind which was in Christ Jesus: the image of God stamped upon the heart, now renewed after the likeness of him that created it? What is it but the love of God because he first loved us, and the love of all mankind, for his sake?</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="028060_0313_0FD68CD865449A88"/>
And what is this peace, the peace of God, but that calm serenity of soul, that sweet repose in the blood of Jesus, which leaves no doubt of our acceptance in him? Which excludes all fear, but the loving, filial fear of offending our Fa∣ther which is in heaven.</P>
<P>This inward kingdom implies also <HI>joy in the Holy Ghost,</HI> who seals upon our hearts, <HI>the re∣demption which is in Jesus,</HI> the righteousness of Christ, imputed to us <HI>for the remission of the sins that are past:</HI> who giveth us now the <HI>earnest of our inheritance</HI> of the crown which the Lord, the righteous judge will give at that day. And well may this be termed <HI>the kingdom of heaven;</HI> seeing it is heaven already opened in the soul; the first springing up of those rivers of pleasure which flow at God's right-hand for evermore.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</HI> Whoso∣ever thou art, to whom God hath given to be <HI>poor in spirit,</HI> to feel thyself lost, thou hast a right thereto, through the gracious promise of him who cannot lie. It is purchased for thee by the blood of the Lamb. It is very nigh: thou art on the brink of heaven. Another step, and thou enterest into the kingdom of righteousness, and peace, and joy. Art thou all sin? <HI>Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.</HI> All unholy? See thy <HI>advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.</HI> Art thou un∣able to atone for the least of thy sins? <HI>He is the propitiation for</HI> all thy <HI>sins.</HI> Now believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and all thy sins are blot∣ted out. Art thou totally unclean in soul and body? Here is the <HI>fountain for sin and unclean∣ness.
<PB N="39" REF="028060_0314_0FD68CDA4FF6F9A0"/>Arise and wash away thy sins:</HI> stagger no more at the promise through unbelief. Give glory to God: dare to believe! now cry out, from the ground of thy heart,
<Q><L>Yes, I yield, I yield at last,</L>
<L>Listen to thy speaking blood;</L>
<L>Me with all my sins I cast</L>
<L>On my atoning God!</L></Q></P>
<P N="13">13. Then thou learnest of him to be <HI>lowly of heart.</HI> And this is the true, genuine, Christian humility, which flows from a sense of the love of God, reconciled to us in Christ Jesus. <HI>Poverty of spirit,</HI> in this meaning of the word, begins where a sense of guilt and of the wrath of God ends; and is, a continual sense of our total dependance on him, for every good thought or word or work; of our utter inability to all good, unless he <HI>water us every moment:</HI> and an abhorrence of the praise of men, knowing that all praise is due unto God only. With this is joined a loving shame, a tender humiliation before God, even for the sins which we know he hath forgiven us, and for the sin which still remaineth in our hearts, although we know it is not imputed to our con∣demnation. Nevertheless the conviction we feel of inbred sin, is deeper and deeper every day. The more we grow in grace, the more do we see of the desperate wickedness of our heart. The more we advance in the knowledge and love of God, through our Lord Jesus Christ (as great a mystery as this may appear, to those who know not the power of God unto salvation) the more do we discern of our alienation from God, of the
<PB N="40" REF="028060_0315_0FD68CDB591C19C0"/>enmity that is in our carnal mind, and the neces∣sity of our being entirely renewed in righteous∣ness and true holiness.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. It is true, he has scarce any conception of this, who now begins to know the inward king∣dom of heaven. <HI>In is prosperity</HI> he saith, <HI>I shall never be moved; thou Lord, hast made my hill so strong.</HI> Sin is utterly bruised beneath his feet, that he can scarce believe it remaineth in him. Even temptation is silenced and speaks not again: is cannot approach, but stands afar off. He is borne alost in the chariots of joy and love: he soars <HI>or upon the wings of an eagle.</HI> But our Lord well knew, that this triumphant state does not often continue long. He therefore presently subjoins, <HI>Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot that we can imagine this promise belongs to those, who mourn only on some worldly ac∣count: who are in sorrow and heaviness, merely on account of some worldly trouble or disappoint∣ment; such as the loss of their reputation, or friends; or the impairing of their fortune. As little title to it have they who are afflicting them∣selves, through fear of some temporal evil: or who pipe away with anxious care, or that desire of earthly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ings which <HI>maketh the heart sick.</HI> Let us not thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, these <HI>shall receive any thing from the</HI> Lord: he is not in all their thoughts. Therefore it is that they thus <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lk in a vain shadow, and disquiet themselves in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>in.</HI> And <HI>this shall ye have of mine hand,</HI> saith the Lord, <HI>ye shall die down in sorrow.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The mourners of whom our Lord here speaks, are those that mourn on quite another ac∣count: they that mourn after God, after him in
<PB N="41" REF="028060_0316_0FD68CDE690EFC80"/>whom they did <HI>rejoice, with joy unspeakable,</HI> when he gave them to <HI>taste the good,</HI> the pardoning <HI>word, and the powers of the world to come.</HI> But he now <HI>hides his face and they are troubled;</HI> they cannot see him through the dark cloud. But they see temptation and sin, which they fondly supposed were gone never to return, arising again, following after them amain, and holding them in on every side. It is not strange if their soul is now disquieted within them, and trouble and heaviness take hold upon them. Nor will their great enemy fail to improve the occasion, to ask, "Where is now thy God? where is now the blessedness whereof thou spakest? the beginning of the kingdom of heaven? Yea, hath God said, Thy sins are forgiven thee? sure∣ly God hath not said it. It was only a dream, a mere delusion, a creature of thy own imagination. If thy sins are forgiven, why art thou thus? can a pardoned sinner be thus unholy?"—And if then, instead of immediately crying to God, they reason with him that is wiser than they, they will be in heaviness indeed, in sorrow of heart, in anguish not to be expressed. Nay, even when God shines again upon the soul, and takes away all doubt of his past mercy, still he that is <HI>weak in faith</HI> may be tempted and troubled, on account of what is to come: especially, when inward sin revives, and thrusts sore at him that he may fall. Then may he again cry out,
<Q><L>"I have a sin of fear, that when I've spun</L>
<L>"My last thread, I shall perish on the shore!"</L></Q>
least I should make shipwreck of the faith, and my last state be worse than the first:
<PB N="42" REF="028060_0317_0FD68CDFD7E07510"/>
<Q><L>"Lest all my bread of life should fail</L>
<L>"And I sink down unchang'd to hell."</L></Q></P>
<P N="4">4. Sure it is that this affliction <HI>for the present is not joyous but grievous. Nevertheless, afterward it bringeth forth peaceable fruit unto them that are exer∣cised thereby. Blessed</HI> therefore <HI>are they that</HI> thus <HI>mourn,</HI> if they <HI>tarry the</HI> Lore's <HI>leisure,</HI> and suffer not themselves to be turned out of the way, by the miserable comforters of the world; if they reso∣lutely reject all the comforts of sin, of folly and vanity; all the idie diversions and amusements of the world, all the pleasures which <HI>perish in the using,</HI> and which only tend to benumb and stupify the soul, that it may neither be sensible of itself nor God. Blessed are they who <HI>follow on to know the</HI> Lord, and steadily refuse all other comfort. They shall be comforted by the consolations of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> spirit, by a fresh manifestation of his love; by such a witness of his accepting them in the belov∣ed, as shall never more be taken away from them. This <HI>full assurance of faith</HI> swallows up all doubt, as well as all tormenting fear; God now giving them a sure hope of an enduring substance, and <HI>strong consolation thro' grace.</HI> Without disputing, Whether it be possible for any of those to <HI>fall a∣way, who were once enlightened and made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</HI> it suffices them to say, by the power now resting upon them,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 35, 38, 39.</NOTE> <HI>Who shall sepa∣rate them from the love of</HI> Christ? <HI>I am persuaded, that neither death <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> life, nor things present, nor things to come: nor height nor depth—shall be able to separate us from the love of</HI> God, <HI>which is in</HI> Christ Jesus <HI>our</HI> Lord.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="43" REF="028060_0318_0FD68CE30EEF97D8"/>
5. This whole process, both of mourning for an absent God, and recovering the joy of his countenance, seems to be shadowed out in what our Lord spoke to his apostles, the night before his passion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xvi. 19—22.</NOTE> <HI>Do ye enquire of that I said, a lit∣tle while and ye shall not see me, and again a little while and ye shall see me? Verily, verily I say unto you, that ye shall weep and lamem,</HI> namely, when ye do not see me; <HI>but the world shall re∣joice,</HI> shall triumph over you, as though your hope were now come to an end. <HI>And ye shall be sorrowful,</HI> thro' doubt, thro' fear, thro' temp∣tation, thro' vehement desire: <HI>But your sorrow shall be turned into joy,</HI> by the return of him whom your soul loveth. <HI>A woman when she is in tra∣vail, hath sorrow, because her hour is come. But as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remem∣bereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. And ye now have sorrow:</HI> ye mourn and cannot be comforted. <HI>But I will see you again: and your heart shall rejoice,</HI> with calm, inward joy, <HI>and your joy no man taketh from you.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. But altho' this mourning is at an end, is lost in holy joy, by the return of the comforter, yet is there another, and a blessed mourning it is, which abides in the children of God. They still mourn for the sins and miseries of mankind: they <HI>weep with them that weep.</HI> They weep for them that weep not for themselves, for the sinners against their own souls. They mourn for the weakness and unfaithfulness of those, that are in some measure saved from their sins. <HI>Who is weak and they are not weak? Who is offended and they
<PB N="44" REF="028060_0319_0FD68CE6A6FEB250"/>burn not?</HI> They are grieved for the dishonour continually done to the Majesty of heaven and earth. At all times they have an awful sense of this, which brings a deep seriousness upon their spirit: a seriousness which is not a little increas∣ed, since the eyes of their understanding were opened, by their continually seeing the vast ocean of eternity, without a bottom or a shore, which has already swallowed up millions of mil∣lions of men, and is gaping to devour them that yet remain. They see here the house of God eternal in the heavens; there, hell and destruc∣tion without a covering; and thence feel the importance of every moment, which just appears, and is gone for ever.</P>
<P N="7">7. But all this wisdom of God is foolishness with the world. The whole affair of <HI>mourning</HI> and <HI>poverty of spirit,</HI> is with them stupidity and dulness. Nay, it is well if they pass so favour∣able a judgment upon it; if they do not vote it to be mere moping and melancholy, if not down∣right lunacy and distraction. And it is no won∣der at all, that this judgment should be passed by those who know not God. Suppose as two persons were walking together, one should sud∣denly stop, and with the strongest signs of fear and amazement, cry out, "On what a preci∣pice do we stand! See, we are on the point of being dasned in pieces! Another step, and we fall into that huge abyss. Stop! I will not go on for all the world." When the other, who seemed to himself at least equally sharp-sighted, looked forward and saw nothing of all this; what would he think of his companion? But that he
<PB N="45" REF="028060_0320_0FD68CE6AC2A55E0"/>was <HI>beside himself;</HI> that his head was out of order: that much religion (if he was not guilty of much learning) had certainly <HI>made him mad.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. But let not the children of God, <HI>the mourn∣ers in Sion,</HI> be moved by any of these things. Ye whose eyes are enlightened, be not troubled by those who walk on still in darkness. Ye do not walk on in a vain shadow: God and eternity are real things. Heaven and hell are in very deed open before you: and ye are on the edge of the great gulph. It has already swallowed up more than words can express. Nations, and kindreds and people, and tongues, and still yawns to de∣vour, whether they see it or no, the giddy, mi∣serable children of men. O cry aloud! Spare not! Lift up your voice, to him who grasps both time and eternity, both for yourselves and your brethren, that ye may be counted worthy to escape the destruction that cometh as a whirl∣wind! That ye may be brought safe thro' all the waves and storms, into the haven where you would be. Weep for yourselves, till he wipes away the tears from your eyes. And even then weep for the miseries that come upon the earth, till the Lord of all shall put a period to misery and sin, shall wipe away the tears from all faces, and <HI>the knowledge of the Lord shall co∣ver the earth as the waters cover the sea.</HI></P>

<P N="2"><PB N="50" REF="028060_0323_0FD6287AC5454610"/>
2. But who are the meek? Not those who grieve at nothing, because they know nothing; who are not discomposed at the evils that occur, because they discern not evil from good. Not those who are sheltered from the shocks of life, by a stupid insensibility; who have either by na∣ture or art, the virtue of stocks and stones, and resent nothing, because they feel nothing. Brute philosophers are wholly unconcerned in this matter. Apathy is as far from meekness as from humanity. So that one would not easily conceive, how any christians of the purer ages, especially any of the fathers of the church, could confound these, and mistake one of the foulest errors of heathenism, for a branch of true chris∣tianity.</P>
<P N="3">3. Nor does christian meekness imply, the be∣ing without zeal for God, any more than it does ignorance or insensibility. No; it keeps clear of every extreme, whether in excess or defect. It does not destroy but balance the affections, which the God of Nature never designed should be rooted out by grace, but only brought and kept under due regulations. It poises the mind aright. It holds an even scale, with regard to anger, and sorrow, and fear: preserving the mean in every circumstance of life, and not declining either to the right-hand or the left.</P>
<P N="4">4. Meekness therefore seems properly to relate to ourselves. But it may be referred either to God or our neighbour. When this due compo∣sure of mind has reference to God, it is usually termed resignation; a calm acquiescence in what∣soever is his will concerning us, even though it may not be pleasing to nature; saying continu∣ally,
<PB N="51" REF="028060_0324_0FD68CEC9628D618"/><HI>It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good.</HI> When we consider it more strictly with re∣gard to ourselves, we stile it patience or content∣edness. When it is exerted toward other men, then it is mildness to the good, and gentleness to the evil.</P>
<P N="5">5. They who are truly meek, can clearly dis∣cern what is evil; and they can also suffer it. They are <HI>sensible</HI> of every thing of this kind; but still meekness holds the reins. They are exceed∣ing <HI>zealous for the Lord of Hosts;</HI> but their zeal is always guided by knowledge, and tempered in every thought, and word, and work, with the love of man as well as the love of God. They do not desire to extinguish any of the passions, which God has for wise ends implanted in their nature. But they have the mastery of all; they hold them all in subjection, and employ them on∣ly in subservience to those ends. And thus even the harsher and more unpleasing passions, are applicable to the noblest purposes. Even hate, and anger, and fear, when engaged against sin, and regulated by faith, and love, are as walls and bulwarks to the soul, so that the wicked one cannot approach to hurt it.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is evident, this divine temper, is not only to abide, but to increase in us day by day. Occasions of exercising, and thereby increasing it, will never be wanting while we remain upon earth. We <HI>have need of patience, that after</HI> we <HI>have done</HI> and suffered <HI>the will of God,</HI> we <HI>may receive the promise.</HI> We have need of resigna∣tion, that we may in all circumstances say, <HI>Not as I will, but as thou wilt.</HI> And we have need of <HI>gentleness toward all men;</HI> but especially to∣ward
<PB N="52" REF="028060_0325_0FD68CEE1304DDB0"/>the evil and unthankful: otherwise we shall be overcome of evil, instead of overcoming evil with good.</P>
<P N="7">7. Nor does meekness restrain only the outward act, as the scribes and pharisees taught of old, and the miserable teachers, who are not taught of God, will not fail to do in all ages. Our Lord guards us against this, and shews the true extent of it in the following words: <HI>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill, shall be in danger of the judgment,</HI> Ver. 21, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>But I say unto you, that whosoever shall be angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: But whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in dan∣ger of hell-fire.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Our Lord here ranks under the head of murder, even that anger which goes no farther than the heart; which does not shew itself by any outward unkindness; no not so much as a passionate word.</P>
<P><HI>Whosoever is angry with his brother,</HI> with any man living, seeing we are all brethren, whosoe∣ver feels any unkindness in his heart, any temper contrary to love: whosoever is angry <HI>without a cause,</HI> without a sufficient cause, or farther than that cause requires, <HI>shall be in danger of the judg∣ment, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> shall</HI> in that moment <HI>be obnoxious to</HI> the righteous judgment of God.</P>
<P>But would not one be inclined to prefer the reading of those copies, which omit the word, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>without a cause?</HI> Is it not entirely super∣fluous?
<PB N="53" REF="028060_0326_0FD6287F0D402A88"/>for if <HI>anger at persons</HI> be a temper con∣trary to love, how can there be a cause, a suf∣ficient cause for it? any that will justify it in the sight of God?</P>
<P><HI>Anger at sin</HI> we allow. In this sense we may <HI>be angry and</HI> yet we <HI>sin not.</HI> In this sense our Lord himself, is once recorded to have been an∣gry. He <HI>looked round about upon them with an∣ger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts.</HI> He was grieved at the sinners, and angry at the sin. And this is undoubtedly right before God.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>And whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca:</HI> whosoever shall give way to anger, so as to ut∣ter any contemptuous word. It is observed by commentators, that <HI>raca</HI> is a <HI>Syriac</HI> word, which properly signifies, <HI>empty, vain, foolish:</HI> so that it is as inoffensive an expression as can well be used, toward one at whom we are displeased. And yet whosoever shall use this, as our Lord assures us, <HI>shall be in danger of the council:</HI> ra∣ther, shall be obnoxious thereto: he shall be li∣able to a severer sentence from the Judge of all the earth.</P>
<P><HI>But whosoever shall say, Thou Fool</HI>—Whosoe∣ver shall so give place to the devil, as to break out into reviling, into designedly reproachful and contumelious language, <HI>shall be obnoxious to hell-fire,</HI> shall in that instant be liable to the highest condemnation. It should be observed, that our Lord describes all these, as obnoxious to capital punishment. The first to strangling, usually in∣flicted on those who were condemned in one of the inferior courts: the second to stoning, which was frequently inflicted on those who were con∣demned
<PB N="54" REF="028060_0327_0FD68CF0961964F8"/>by the great council at Jerusalem; the third to burning alive, inflicted only on the high∣est offenders, in the <HI>valley of the sons of</HI> Hin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> from which that word is evi∣dently taken, which we translate hell.</P>
<P N="10">10. And whereas men naturally imagine, that God will excuse their defect in some duties, for their exactness in others, our Lord next takes care to cut off that vain, though comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> imagi∣nation. He shews, that it is impossible for any sinner to <HI>commute</HI> with God: who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not ac∣cept one duty for another, nor take a part of obedience for the whole. He warns us, that the performing our duty to God, will not excuse us from our duty to our neighbour: that works of piety, as they are called, will be so far from com∣mending us to God, if we are wanting in chari∣ty, that on the contrary, that want of charity will make all those works an abomination to the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>Therefore, if thou bring thy gift to the aliar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee,</HI> on account of thy unkind behaviour toward him, of thy calling him, <HI>Raca,</HI> or <HI>Thou Fool;</HI> think not that thy gift will atone for thy anger; or that it will find any acceptance with God, so long as thy conscience is defiled with the guilt of unrepented sin. <HI>Leave there thy gift be∣fore the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother</HI> (at least, do all that in thee lies toward being reconciled) <HI>and then come and offer thy gift,</HI> Ver. 23, 24.</P>
<P N="11">11. And let there be no delay in what so nearly concerneth thy soul. <HI>Agree with thine adversary quickly</HI>—Now: upon the spot—<HI>while
<PB N="55" REF="028060_0328_0FD68CF575E6EB70"/>thou art in the way with him</HI>—if it be possible, before he go out of thy sight—<HI>lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge</HI>—lest he appeal to God, the judge of all, <HI>and the judge deliver thee to the officer,</HI> to <HI>satan,</HI> the executioner of the wrath of God, <HI>and thou be cast into prison,</HI> into hell, there to be reserved to the judgment of the great day. <HI>Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the utter∣most farthing.</HI> But this it is impossible for thee ever to do; seeing thou hast nothing to pay. Therefore if thou art once in that prison, the smoke of thy torment must <HI>ascend up for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. Mean time <HI>the meek shall inherit the earth.</HI> Such is the foolishness of worldly wisdom! The wise of the world had warned them again and again, "That if they did not refent such treat∣ment, if they would tamely suffer themselves to be thus abused, there would be no living for them upon earth; that they would never be able to procure the common necessaries of life, nor to keep even what they had; that they could ex∣pect no peace, no quiet possession, no enjoyment of any thing." Most true—suppose there were no God in the world; or suppose he did not con∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> himself with the children of men. But <HI>when</HI> God <HI>ariseth to judgment, and to help all the meek upon earth,</HI> how doth he laugh all this heathen wisdom to scorn, and turn the <HI>fierceness of man to his praise!</HI> he takes a peculiar care, to provide them with all things needful for life and godliness. He secures to them the provision he hath made, in spite of the force, fraud or malice of
<PB N="56" REF="028060_0329_0FD68CF928B687F8"/>men. And what he secures, he <HI>gives</HI> them <HI>richly to enjoy.</HI> It is sweet to them, be it little or much. As <HI>in patience</HI> they <HI>possess their souls,</HI> so they truly possess whatever God hath given them. They are always content, always pleased with what they have. It pleases them, because it pleases God. so that while their heart, their desire, their joy is in heaven, they may truly be said to <HI>inherit the earth.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. But there seems to be a yet farther mean∣ing in these words, even that they shall have a more eminent part <HI>in the new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness,</HI> in that inheritance, a ge∣neral description of which (and the particulars we shall know hereafter) St. John hath given in the 20th chapter of the <HI>revelation. And I saw an angel come down from heaven—and he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent—and bound him a thousand years—and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of</HI> Jesus, <HI>and for the word of</HI> God, <HI>and of them which had not worship∣ped the beast, neither his image, neither had receiv∣ed his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands, and they lived and reigned with</HI> Christ <HI>a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again, until the thousand years were expired. This is the first resurrection: blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power. But they shall be priests of</HI> God <HI>and of</HI> Christ, <HI>and shall reign with him a thousand years.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. 1. Our Lord has hitherto been more im∣mediately employed, in removing the hinderances of true religion: such is pride, the first, grand
<PB N="57" REF="028060_0330_0FD68CFA16D3DB58"/>hinderance of all religion, which is taken away by <HI>poverty of spirit;</HI> levity, and thoughtlessness, which prevent any religion from taking root in the soul, till they are removed by holy <HI>mourning:</HI> such are anger, impatience, discontent, which are all healed by christian <HI>meekness.</HI> And when once these hinderances are removed, these evil diseases of the soul, which were continually rai∣sing false cravings therein, and filling it with sick∣ly appetites, the native appetite of a heaven-born spirit returns; it hungers and thirsts after righte∣ousness: and <HI>blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they shall be filled.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Righteousness (as was observed before) is the image of God, the mind which was in Christ Jesus. It is every holy and heavenly temp∣er in one; springing from, as well as terminat∣ing in the love of God, as our Father and Re∣deemer, and the love of all men, for his sake.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after</HI> this: in order fully to understand which expression, we should observe, First, That hun∣ger and thirst are the strongest of all our bodily appetites. In like manner this hunger in the soul, this thirst after the image of God, is the strongest of all our spirituall appetites, when it is once awakened in the heart: yea, it swal∣lows up all the rest in that one great desire, to he renewed after the likeness of him that created us. We should, secondly, observe, that from the time we begin to hunger and thirst, those appetites do not cease but are more and more craving and importunate, till we either eat and
<PB N="58" REF="028060_0331_0FD68CFC5395AFE8"/>drink or die. And even so, from the time that we begin to hunger and thirst after the whole mind which was in Christ, these spiritual appe∣tites do not cease, but cry after their food with more and more importunity. Nor can they pos∣sibly cease, before they are satisfied, while there is any spiritual life remaining. We may, Third∣ly, observe, That hunger and thirst are satisfi∣ed with nothing but meat and drink. If you would give to him that is hungry all the world beside, all the elegance of apparel, all the trap∣pings of state, all the treasure upon earth, yea thousands of gold and silver: if you would pay him ever so much honour, he regards it not; all these things are then of no account with him. He would still say, these are not the things I want; give me food, or else I die. The very same is the case with every soul that truly hun∣gers and thirsts after righteousness. He can find no comfort in any thing but this; he can be sa∣tisfied with nothing else. Whatever you offer besides, it is lightly esteemed; whether it be riches, or honour, or pleasure, he still says, this is not the thing which I want. Give me love or else I die!</P>
<P N="4">4. And it is as impossible to satisfy such a soul, a soul that is a-thirst for God, the living God, with what the world accounts religion, as with what they account happiness. The religion of the world implies three things; First, the do∣ing no harm, the abstaining from outward sin; at least from such as is scandalous, as robbery, theft, common swearing, drunkenness; Second∣ly, The doing good, the relieving the poor, the being charitable, as it is called: Thirdly, The
<PB N="59" REF="028060_0332_0FD68CFC57D99358"/>using the means of grace; at least, the going to church and to the Lord's supper. He in whom these three marks are found, is termed by the world a religious man. But will this satisfy him who hungers after God? No. It is not food for his soul. He wants a religion of a no∣bler kind, a religion higher and deeper than this. He can no more feed on this poor, shallow, formal thing, than he can <HI>fill his belly with the east-wind.</HI> True, he is careful to abstain from the very appearance of evil: he is zealous of good works. He attends all the ordinances of God. But all this is not what he longs for. This is only the outside of that religion, which he insatiably hungers after. The knowledge of God in Christ Jesus, <HI>the Life which is hid with</HI> Christ <HI>in</HI> God, the being <HI>joined unto the</HI> Lord in <HI>one spirit,</HI> the having <HI>fellowship with the Father and the Son;</HI> the <HI>walking in the light as</HI> God <HI>is in the light,</HI> the being <HI>purified even as he is pure:</HI> this is the religion, the righteousness he thirsts after. Nor can he rest, till he thus rests in God.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Blessed are they who</HI> thus <HI>hunger and thirst after righteousness. For they shall be filled.</HI> They shall be filled with the thing which they long for; even with righteousness and true holiness. God shall satisfy them with the blessings of his goodness, with the felicity of his chosen. He shall feed them with the bread of heaven, with the manna of his love. He shall give them to drink of his pleasures as out of the river, which he that drinketh of, shall never thirst: only for more and more of the water of life. This thirst shall endure for ever.</P>
<PB N="60" REF="028060_0333_0FD68D002A13BE68"/>
<Q><L>The painful thirst, the fond desire,</L>
<L>Thy joyous presence shall remove:</L>
<L>But my full soul shall still require</L>
<L>A whole eternity of love.</L></Q>
<P N="6">6. Whosoever then thou art, to whom God hath given to <HI>hunger and thirst after righteousness,</HI> cry unto him that thou mayest never lose that inestimable gift, that this divine appetite may never cease. If many rebuke thee, and bid thee hold thy peace, regard them not, yea, cry so much the more, Jesus, <HI>Master, have mercy on me!</HI> let me not live, but to be holy as thou art holy! no more <HI>spend thy money for that which is not bread,</HI> nor thy <HI>labour for that which satisfieth not.</HI> Canst thou hope to dig happiness out of the earth? to find it in the things of the world? O trample under foot all its pleasures, despise its honours, count its riches as dung and dross: yea, and all the things which are beneath the sun, <HI>for the excellency of the knowledge of</HI> Christ Jesus; for the entire renewal of thy soul in that Image of God, wherein it was originally cre∣ated. Beware of quenching that blessed hunger and thirst, by what the world calls religion: A religion of form, of outside shew, which leave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the heart as earthly and sensual as ever. Let no∣thing satisfy thee but the power of godliness, but a religion that is spirit and life; the dwelling in God and God in thee, the being an inhabitant of eternity; the entering in by the blood of sprinkling <HI>within the veil,</HI> and <HI>sitting in heavenly places with</HI> Christ Jesus.</P>

III. 1. And the more they are filled with the life of God, the more tenderly will they be con∣cerned, for those who are still without God in the world, still dead in trespasses and sins. Nor shall this concern for others lose its reward. <HI>Blessed are the merciful; for they shall obtain mercy.</HI></P>
<P>The word used by our Lord, more immedi∣ately implies, the compassionate, the tender-hearted; those, who far from despising, earnest∣ly grieve for those that do not hunger after God. This eminent part of brotherly love, is here (by a common figure) put for the whole: so that <HI>the merciful,</HI> in the full sense of the term, are they who <HI>love their neighbours as themselves.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Because of the vast importance of this love, without which, <HI>tho' we spake with the tongues of men and angels, tho' we had the gift of prophecy and understood all mysteries and all knowledge, tho' we had all faith so as to remove mountains;</HI> yea, <HI>tho'</HI> we <HI>gave all</HI> our <HI>goods to feed the poor, and</HI> our very <HI>bodies to be burned, it</HI> would <HI>profit us nothing:</HI> the wisdom of God has given us by the apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> a full and particular account of it: by con∣sidering which we shall most clearly discern, who are the <HI>merciful</HI> that shall <HI>obtain mercy.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Charity,</HI> or love (as it were to be wished it had been rendered throughout, being a far plamer and less ambiguous word) the love of our neighbour as <HI>Christ</HI> hath loved us, <HI>suffereth long,</HI> is patient toward all men. It suffers all the weak∣ness, ignorance, errors, infirmities, all the fro∣wardness and littleness of faith, in the children of God; all the malice and wickedness of the children of the world. And it suffers all this,
<PB N="62" REF="028060_0335_0FD68D069E279EA8"/>not only for a time, for a short season, but to the end: still feeding our enemy when he hungers: if he thirst, still giving him drink: thus continual∣ly <HI>heaping coals of fire,</HI> of melting love, <HI>upon his head.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. And in every step toward this desirable end, the <HI>overcoming evil with good, love is kind</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> a word not easily translated) it is soft, mild, benign. It stands at the utmost distance from moroseness, from all harshness or sowerness of spirit; and inspires the sufferer at once with the most amiable sweetness, and the most fervent and tender affection.</P>
<P N="5">5. Consequently, <HI>love envieth not,</HI> it is impos∣sible it should, it is directly opposite to that bane∣ful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mper. It cannot be, that he who has this tender affection to all, who earnestly wishes all temporal and spiritual blessings, all good things in this world and the world to come, to every soul that God hath made, should be pained at his bestowing any good gift, on any child of man. If he has himself received the same, he does not grieve but rejoice, that another partakes of the common benefit. If he has not, he blesses God, that his brother at least has, and is herein hap∣pier than himself. And the greater his love, the more does he rejoice, in the blessings of all mankind: the farther is he removed from every kind and degree of envy toward any creature.</P>
<P N="6">6. Love <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Not <HI>vaunteth not itself,</HI> which co-incides with the very next words, but rather (as the word likewise properly imports) <HI>is not rash</HI> or <HI>hasty</HI> in judging. It will not hastily condemn any one. It does not pass a severe sen∣tence,
<PB N="63" REF="028060_0336_0FD68D07A1531508"/>on a slight or sudden view of things. It first weighs all the evidence, particularly that which is brought in favour of the accused. A true lover of his neighbour, is not like the gene∣rality of men, who even in cases of the nicest na∣ture, "see a little, presume a great deal, and so jump to the conclusion." No: he proceeds with wariness and circumspection, taking heed to e∣very step: willingly subscribing to that rule of the ancient heathen, (O where will the modern christian appear!) "I am so far from lightly be∣lieving what one man says against another, that I will not easily believe what a man says against himself. I will always allow him second thoughts, and many times council too."</P>
<P N="7">7. It follows, love <HI>is not pussed</HI> up. It does not incline or suffer any man, <HI>to think more high∣ly of himself than be ought to think:</HI> but rather <HI>to think soberly.</HI> Yea, it humbles the soul unto the dust. It destroys all high conceits engendering pride, and makes us rejoice to be as nothing, to be little and vile, the lowest of all, the servant of all. They who are <HI>kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love,</HI> cannot but <HI>in honour prefer one another.</HI> Those who <HI>having the same love</HI> are <HI>of one accord,</HI> do <HI>in lowliness of mind each esteem other better than themselves.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>It doth not behave itself unseemly.</HI> It is not rude, or willingly offensive to any. It <HI>renders to all their due; fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour:</HI> courtesy, civility, humanity to all the world; in their several degrees <HI>honouring all men.</HI> A late writer defines good-breeding, nay, the highest degree of it, politeness, "a continual de∣sire
<PB N="64" REF="028060_0337_0FD68D091DA7A108"/>to please, appearing in all the behaviour. But if so, there is none so well-bred as a chris∣tian, a lover of all mankind. For he cannot but defire to <HI>please all me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir their good, to edifica∣tion.</HI> And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> desires cannot be hid: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t will necessarily appear in all his intercourse with man. For his <HI>love</HI> is <HI>without dissimulotion;</HI> it will ap∣pear in all his actions and conversation: yea, and will constrain him, tho' without guile, to <HI>become all things to all men, if by any means</HI> he <HI>may save some.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. And in becoming all things to all men, <HI>love seeketh not her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn.</HI> In stri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to please all men, the lover of mankind has no eye at all to his own temporal advantage. He covets no man's silver, or gold, or apparel: he desires nothing, but the salvation of their souls. Yea, in some sense he may be said, <HI>not to seek his own</HI> spiritual, any more than temporal advantage. For while he is on the full stretch to save their souls from death, he, as it were forgets himself. He does not think of himself, so long as that zeal for the glory of God swallows him up. Nay, at some times, he may almost seem, through an excess of love, to give up himself, both his soul and his body: while he cries out with <HI>Moses,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> xxxii. 31, 32.</NOTE> <HI>Oh! this people have sinned a great sin. Yet now, if thou wilt, forgive their sin. And if not, blot me out of the book which thou hast written!</HI> Or with St. <HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> ix. 3.</NOTE> <HI>I could wish that myself were ac∣cursed from</HI> Christ, <HI>for my brethren my kinsmen ac∣cording to the flesh!</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. No marvel that such <HI>love is not provoked:</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Let it be observed, the word <HI>easily,</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="028060_0338_0FD68D0C5EB9C4B8"/>strangely inserted in the translation, is not in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s words are absolute. <HI>Love is not provoked:</HI> It is not provoked to unkindness toward any one. Occasions indeed will frequent∣ly occur; outward provocations of various kinds: but love does not yield to provocation. It tri∣umphs over all. In all trials it looketh unto <HI>Je∣sus,</HI> and is more that conqueror in his love.</P>
<P>It is not improbable, that our translators in∣serted that word, as it were to excuse the a∣postle; who, as they supposed, might otherwise appear to be wanting, in the very love which he so beautifully describes. They seem to have sup∣posed this from a phrase in the <HI>Acts of the A∣postles;</HI> which is likewise very inaccurately trans∣lated. When <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> disagreed con∣cerning <HI>John,</HI> the translation runs thus,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts.</HI> xv. 39.</NOTE> <HI>And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder.</HI> This naturally induces the reader to suppose, that they were equally sharp therein: that St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who was undoubtedly right, with regard to the point in question (it being quite improper to take <HI>John</HI> with them a∣gain, who had deserted them before) was as much provoked as <HI>Barnabas</HI> who gave such a proof of his anger, as to leave <HI>the work</HI> for which he had been <HI>set apart by the Holy Ghost.</HI> But the ori∣ginal imports no such thing; nor does it affirm, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was provoked at all. It simply says <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>And there was a sharpness a paroxysm</HI> of anger: in consequence of which <HI>Bar∣nabas</HI> left St. <HI>Paul,</HI> took <HI>John</HI> and went his own way. <HI>Paul</HI> then <HI>chose</HI> Silas <HI>and departed, being re∣commended
<PB N="66" REF="028060_0339_0FD68D115693C518"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the brethren to the grace of</HI> God;; (which is not said concerning <HI>Barnabas</HI>) <HI>and he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nt through</HI> Syria <HI>and</HI> Cilicia, as he had propos∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l, <HI>confirming the churches.</HI> But to return.</P>
<P N="11">11. Love prevents a thousand provocations which would otherwise arise, because <HI>it thinketh no evil.</HI> Indeed the merciful man cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> knowing many things that are evil, he cannot but see them with his own eyes and hear them with his own ears. For love does not put out his eyes, so that it is impossible for him, not to see that such things are done. Neither does it take away his understanding, any more than his senses, so that he cannot but know that they are evil. For instance: when he sees a man strike his neighbour, or hears him blaspheme God, he cannot either question the thing done or the words spoken, or doubt of their being evil. Yet <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> The word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>(think∣eth)</HI> does not refer, either to our seeing and hear∣ing, or to the first and involuntary acts of our understanding: but to our willingly <HI>thinking</HI> what we need not; our <HI>inferring</HI> evil, where it does not appear: to our <HI>reasoning</HI> concerning things which we do not see; our <HI>supposing</HI> what we have neither seen nor heard. This is what true love absolutely destroys. It tears up, root and branch, all <HI>imagining</HI> what we have not known. It casts out all jealousies, all evil sur∣misings, all readiness to believe evil. It is frank, open, unsuspicious; and as it cannot design, so neither does it fear evil.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>It rejoiceth not in iniquity:</HI> common as this is, even among those who bear the name of <HI>Christ;</HI> who scruple not to rejoice over their
<PB N="67" REF="028060_0340_0FD68D115CC75710"/>enemy, when he falleth either into affliction or error or sin. Indeed how hardly can they avoid this, who are zealously attached to any party? how difficult is it for them not to be pleased with any fault which they discover in those of the op∣posite party? with any real or supposed blemish, either in their principles or practice? what warm defender of any cause is clear of these? Yea, who is so calm as to be altogether free? who does not rejoice when his adversary makes a false step, which he thinks will advantage his own cause? only a man of love. He alone weeps over either the sin or folly of his enemy, takes no pleasure in hearing or in repeating it, but ra∣ther desires that it may be forgotten for ever.</P>
<P N="13">13. But he <HI>rejoiceth in the truth,</HI> wheresoever it is found, in the <HI>truth which is after godliness,</HI> bringing forth its proper fruit, holiness of heart and holiness of conversation. He rejoices to sind, that even those who oppose him, whether with regard to opinions or some points of prac∣tice, are nevertheless lovers of God, and in other respects unreprovable. He is glad to hear good of them, and to speak all he can consistent∣ly with truth and justice. Indeed, good in gene∣ral is his glory and joy, wherever diffused thro'out the race of mankind. As a citizen of the world he claims a share in the happiness of all the in∣habitants of it. Because he is a man, he is not unconcerned in the welfare of any man: but en∣joys whatsoever brings glory to God, and pro∣motes peace and good-will among men.</P>
<P N="14">14. This love <HI>covereth all things.</HI> (So with∣out all doubt <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> should be translated:

So far is he from mak∣ing the faults or failings of others the matter of his conversation, that of the absent he never does speak at all, unless he can speak well. A talebearer, a backbiter, a whisperer, an evilspeak∣er, is to him all one as a murderer. He would just as soon cut his neighbour's throat, as thus murder his reputation. Just as soon would he think of diverting himself by setting fire to his neighbour's house, as of thus <HI>scattering abroad arrows, firebrands and death, and saying, am I not in sport?</HI></P>
<P>He makes one only exception. Sometimes he is convinced, that it is for the glory of God, or (which comes to the same) the good of his neighbour, that an evil should not be covered. In this case, for the benefit of the innocent, he is constrained to declare the guilty. But even here,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. He will not speak at all, till love, su∣perior love constrains him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. He cannot do it from a general confused view of doing good, or promoting the glory of God, but from a clear sight of some particular end, some determinate good which he pursues.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Still he cannot speak, unless he be fully convinced, that this very means
<PB N="69" REF="028060_0342_0FD68D14CC5A46F8"/>is necessary to that end; that the end cannot be answered, at least not so effectually, by any other way.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. He then doth it with the utmost sor∣row and reluctance, using it a the last and worst medicine, a desperate remedy in a desperate case, a kind of poison never to be used but to expel poison. Consequently,</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. He uses it as sparing∣ly as possible. And this he does with fear and trembling, lest he should transgress the law of love by speaking too much, more than he would have done by not speaking at all.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="15">15. Love <HI>believeth all things.</HI> It is always wil∣ling to think the best; to put the most favour∣able construction on every thing. It is ever rea∣dy to believe whatever may tend to the advant∣age of any ones character. It is easily convin∣ced of (what it earnestly desires) the innocence or integrity of any man; or, at least, of the sincerity of his repentance, if he had once erred from the way. It is glad to excuse whatever is amiss; to condemn the offender as little as pos∣sible, and to make all the allowance for human weakness, which can be done without betraying the truth of God.</P>
<P N="16">16. And when it can no longer believe, then <HI>love hopeth all things.</HI> Is any evil related of any man? love hopes, that the relation is not true, that the thing related was never done? Is it cer∣tain it was?—"But perhaps it was not done with such circumstances as are related; so that allowing the fact, there is room to hope, it was not so ill as it is represented." Was the action apparently, undeniably evil? love hopes the in∣tention was not so. Is it clear, the design was evil too?—"Yet might it not spring from the
<PB N="70" REF="028060_0343_0FD68D1637FFC8F0"/>settled temper of the heart: but from a start of passion, or from some vehement temptation, which hurried the man beyond himself." And even when it cannot be doubted, but all the ac∣tions, designs and tempers are equally evil: still love hopes that God will at last make bare his arm, and get himself the victory; and that <HI>there shall be joy in heaven over this one sinner that re∣penteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons that need no repentance.</HI></P>
<P N="17">17. Lastly, <HI>it endureth all things.</HI> This com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eates the character, of him that is truly merci∣ful. He endureth not some, not many things only, not most, but absolutely <HI>all things.</HI> What∣ever the injustice, the malice, the cruelty of men, can inflict, he is able to suffer. He calls nothing intolerable; he never says of any thing, "This is not to be borne." No; he can, not on∣ly do, but suffer all things thro' Christ which strengtheneth him. And all he suffers does not destroy his love, not impair it in the least. It is proof against all. It is a flame that burns even in the midst of the great deep. <HI>Many waters cannot quench</HI> his <HI>love, neither can the floods drown it.</HI> It triumphs over all. It <HI>never faileth,</HI> either in time or in eternity.</P>
<Q><L>"In obedience to what heaven decrees,</L>
<L>Knowledge shall fail and prophecy shall cease.</L>
<L>But lasting charity's more ample sway,</L>
<L>Nor bound by time, nor subject to decay,</L>
<L>In happy triumph shall for ever live,</L>
<L>And endless good diffuse, and endless praise receive."</L></Q>
<P><PB N="71" REF="028060_0344_0FD68D1815A17DA8"/>
So shall <HI>the merciful obtain mercy:</HI> not only by the blessing of God, upon all their ways, by his now repaying the love they bear to their brethren, a thousand sold into their own bosom: but like∣wise by <HI>an exceeding and eternal weight of glory,</HI> in the <HI>kingdom prepared for them from the beginning of the world.</HI></P>

And mean while, how do they also anathematize each other! devote each other to the nethermost hell! what wrath, what contention, what malice, what bitterness, is every where found among them? even where they agree in essentials, and only differ in opinions, or in the circumstantials of religion. Who <HI>follows after</HI> only <HI>the things that make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another?</HI> O God! how long shall thy promise fail? fear it not, ye little flock.

<P N="1">1. HOW excellent things are spoken of the love of our neighbour! It is <HI>the fulfilling of the law, the end of the commandment.</HI> Without this all we have, all we do, all we suf∣fer, is of no value in the sight of God. But it is that love of our neighbour which springs from
<PB N="78" REF="028060_0349_0FD68D205C3E3598"/>the love of God: otherwise itself is nothing worth. It behoves us therefore to examine well upon what foundation our love of our neigh∣bour stands: whether it is really built upon the love of God? whether <HI>we</HI> do <HI>love him, because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first loved us?</HI> whether we are <HI>pure in heart?</HI> for this is the foundation, which shall never be mov∣ed. <HI>Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see</HI> God.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The pure in heart</HI> are they, whose hearts God hath <HI>purified even as he is pure;</HI> who are purified thro' faith in the blood of <HI>Jesus,</HI> from every unholy affection; who being <HI>cleansed from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, perfect holiness in the</HI> loving fear <HI>of</HI> God. They are, through the power of his grace, purified from pride, by the deepest poverty of spirit; from anger, from every unkind or turbulent passion, by meekness and gentleness; from every desire but to please and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>joy God, to know and love him more and mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, by that hunger and thirst after righte∣ousness, which now engrosses their whole soul: so that now they love the Lord their God, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their heart, and with all their soul and mind and strength.</P>
<P N="3">3. But how little has this <HI>purity of heart</HI> been regarded, by the false teachers of all ages? They have taught men barely, to abstain from such outward impurities, as God hath forbidden by name. But they did not strike at the heart; and by not guarding against, they in effect, counte∣nanced inward corruptions.</P>
<P>A remarkable imbance of this, our Lord has given us, in the following words: <HI>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not
<PB N="79" REF="028060_0350_0FD68D21D91BFA80"/>commit adultery.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ver.</HI> 27.</NOTE> And in explaining this, those blind leaders of the blind, only insist on men's abstaining from the outward act.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ver.</HI> 28.</NOTE> <HI>But I say unto you, whosoever looketh on a woman to lust af∣ter her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart,</HI> for God requireth truth in the in∣ward parts. He searcheth the heart and trieth the reins. And <HI>if</HI> thou <HI>incline unto iniquity with</HI> thy <HI>heart, the</HI> Lord <HI>will not hear</HI> thee.</P>
<P N="4">4. And God admits no excuse for retaining any thing, which is an occasion of impurity. Therefore <HI>if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell,</HI> ver. 29. If a person as dear to thee as thy right eye, be an occasion of thy thus offend∣ing God, a means of exciting unholy desire in thy soul; delay not; forcibly separate from them. <HI>And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell,</HI> ver. 30. If any who seems as necessary to thee as thy right hand, be an occasion of sin, of impure desire; even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>gh it were never to go beyond the heart, never to break out in word or action; constrain thyself to an entire and final parting: cut them off at a stroke; give them up to God. Any loss, whether of pleasure or substance or friends, is preferable to the loss of any soul.</P>
<P>Two steps only it may not be improper to take, before such an absolute and final separation.
<PB N="80" REF="028060_0351_0FD68D2351E494E8"/>First, try whether the unclean spirit may not be driven out by fasting and prayer, and by carefully abstaining from every action and word and look, which thou hast found to be an occasion of evil. Secondly, if thou art not by this means deli∣vered, ask counsel of him that watcheth over thy soul, or at least of some who have experi∣ence in the ways of God, touching the time and manner of that separation. But confer not with flesh and blood, lest thou be <HI>given up to a strong delusion to believe a lie.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Nor may marriage itself, holy and honour∣able as it is, be used, as a pretence for giving a loose to our desires. Indeed, <HI>It hath been said, whosoever will put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement.</HI> And then all was well; tho' he alledged no cause, but that he did not like her; or liked another better. <HI>But I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication</HI> (that is, adultery; the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifying unchastity in general, ei∣ther in the married or unmarried state) <HI>causeth her to commit adultery,</HI> if she marry again; <HI>and who∣soever shall marry her that is put away, committeth adultery,</HI> ver. 31, 32.</P>
<P>All polygamy is clearly forbidden in these words, wherein our Lord expressly declares, that for any woman who has a husband alive, to marry again is adultery. By parity of reason, it is adultery for any man to marry again, so long as he has a wife alive. Yea, although they were divorced: unless that divorce had been for the cause of adultery. In that only case, there is no scripture, which forbids the innocent person to marry again.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="81" REF="028060_0352_0FD68D29DADDEA18"/>
6. Such is the purity of heart which God re∣quires, and works in those who believe on the son of his love. And <HI>blessed are they</HI> who are thus <HI>pure in heart. For they shall see</HI> God. He will <HI>manifest himself unto them,</HI> not only <HI>as he doth not unto the world,</HI> but as he doth not always to his own children. He will bless them with the clearest communications of his spirit, the most intimate <HI>fellowship with the Father and with the Son.</HI> He will cause his presence to go continual∣ly before them, and the light of his countenance to shine upon them. It is the ceaseless prayer of their heart, <HI>I beseech thee, shew me thy glory:</HI> and they have the petition they ask of him. They now see him by faith (the veil of flesh being made, as it were, transparent) even in these his lowest works, in all that surrounds them, in all that God has created and made. They see him in the height above and in the depth beneath; they see him filling all in all.</P>
<P>The pure in heart see all things full of God. They see him in the firmament of heaven, in the moon walking in brightness, in the sun when he rejoiceth as a giant to run his course. They see him <HI>making the clouds his chariots, and walking upon the wings of the wind.</HI> They see him <HI>pre∣paring rain for the earth, and blessing the increase of it; giving grass for the cattle, and green herbs for the use of man.</HI> They see the Creator of all, wisely governing all, and <HI>upholding all things by the word of his power.</HI> O Lord, <HI>our governor! how excellent is thy name in all the world!</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. In all his providences relating to themselves, to their souls or bodies, the pure in heart do more
<PB N="82" REF="028060_0353_0FD68D2B91A06F98"/>particularly see God. They see his hand ever over them for good; giving them all things in weight, and measure, numbering the hairs of their head, making a hedge round about them and all that they have, and disposing all the circum∣stances of their life, according to the depth both of his wisdom and mercy.</P>
<P N="8">8. But in a more especial manner, they see God in his ordinances. Whether they appear in the great congregation, to <HI>pay him the honour due un∣to his name, and worship</HI> him <HI>in the beauty of ho∣liness;</HI> or <HI>enter into their closets</HI> and there pour out their souls before their <HI>Father which is in se∣cret:</HI> whether they search the oracles of God, or hear the ambassadors of Christ proclaiming glad tidings of salvation; or by eating of that bread, and drinking of that cup, <HI>shew forth his death till he come</HI> in the clouds of heaven: in all these his appointed ways, they find such a near ap∣proach as cannot be expressed. They see him, as it were, face to face, and <HI>talk with him, as a man talketh with his friend:</HI> a fit preparation for those mansions above, wherein they shall <HI>see him as he is.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. But how far were they from seeing God, who having <HI>beard, that it</HI> had been <HI>said by them of old time,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 33.</NOTE> <HI>thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the</HI> Lord <HI>thine oaths:</HI> interpreted it thus, thou shalt not forswear thyself, when thou swearest by the Lord Jehovah. Thou <HI>shalt per∣form unto the</HI> Lord these <HI>thine oaths.</HI> But as to other oaths he regardeth them not.</P>
<P>So the Pharisees taught. They not only al∣lowed all manner of swearing in common con∣versation:
<PB N="83" REF="028060_0354_0FD68D2D15310898"/>but accounted even forswearing a lit∣tle thing, so they had not sworn by the peculiar name of God.</P>
<P>But our Lord here absolutely forbids all com∣mon swearing, as well as all false swearing: and thews the heinousness of both, by the same aw∣ful consideration, that every creature is God's, and he is every where present, in all, and over all.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 34.</NOTE> <HI>I say unto you, swear not at all: neither by heaven, for it is</HI> God's <HI>throne.</HI> And therefore this is the same as to swear by him, who sitteth upon the circle of the heavens:<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ver. 35.</NOTE> <HI>nor by the earth: for it is his footstool:</HI> and he is as inti∣mately present in earth as heaven: <HI>neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king,</HI> and God is <HI>well known in her palaces.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ver. 36.</NOTE> <HI>Neither shalt thou swear by thy head; because thou canst not make one hair white or black:</HI> because even this, it is plain, is not thine but God's, the sole dis∣poser of all in heaven and earth.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ver. 37.</NOTE> <HI>But let your communication,</HI> your conversation, your discourse with each other, <HI>be yea, yea; nay, nay:</HI> a bare, serious affirming or denying; <HI>for whatsoever is more than these, cometh of evil:</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>is of the evil one;</HI> proceedeth from the devil and is a mark of his children.</P>
<P N="10">10. That our Lord does not here forbid, the <HI>swearing in judgment and truth,</HI> when we are re∣quired so to do by a magistrate, may appear,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. From the occasion of this part of his dis∣course, the abuse he was here reproving, which was false swearing and common swearing; the

<ITEM>2. From the very words wherein he forms the general conclusion, <HI>let your commu∣nication,</HI> or discourse, <HI>be yea, yea; nay, nay.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. From his own example; for he answered him∣self upon oath, when required by a magistrate. When<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxvi. 63, 64.</NOTE> <HI>the high priest said unto him, I adjure thee by the living</HI> God, <HI>that thou tell us, whether thou be the</HI> Christ, <HI>the son of</HI> God!

</LIST>
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 9.</NOTE> God <HI>is my witness,</HI> saith he, to the <HI>Romans, that with∣out ceasing, I make mention of you always in my prayers;</HI> to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. i. 23.</NOTE> <HI>I call</HI> God <HI>to re∣cord upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth:</HI> and to the <HI>Philippians,</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Phil. i. 8.</NOTE> God <HI>is my record how greatly I long after you, in the bowels of</HI> Jesus Christ (hence it undeniably ap∣pears, that if the apostle knew the meaning of his Lord's words, they do not forbid swearing on weighty occasions, even to one another: how much less before a magistrate?) and lastly, from that assertion of the great apostle, concerning solemn
<PB N="85" REF="028060_0356_0FD68D32597810B8"/>swearing in general (which it is impossible he could have mentioned without any touch of blame, if his Lord had totally forbidden it)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi.</NOTE> <HI>men verily swear by the greater</HI> (by one greater than themselves) <HI>and on oath for confirmation is to them the end of all strife.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. But the great lesson which our blessed Lord inouleates here, and which he illustrates by this example, is, that God is in all things, and that we are to see the Creator in the glass of e∣very creature; that we should use and look upon nothing as separate from God, which indeed is a kind of practical atheism; but with a true magni∣ficence of thought, survey heaven and earth and all that is therein, as contained by God in the hol∣low of his hand, who by his intimate presence holds them all in being, who pervades and actu∣ates the whole created frame, and is, in a true sense, the soul of the universe.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. Thus far our Lord has been more di∣rectly employed, in teaching the religion of the heart. He has shewn, what christians are to <HI>be.</HI> He proceeds to shew, what they are to <HI>do</HI> also: how inward holiness is to exert itself in our outward conversation. <HI>Blessed,</HI> faith he, <HI>are the peace-makers: for they shall be called the children of</HI> God.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The peace-makers:</HI> The word in the original is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> It is well known that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the sacred writings, implies all manner of good; eve∣ry blessing that relates either to the soul or the bo∣dy, to time or eternity. Accordingly when <HI>St.
<PB N="86" REF="028060_0357_0FD68D33F5E74548"/>Paul</HI> in the titles of his epistles, wishes <HI>grace and peace</HI> to the <HI>Romans</HI> or the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> it is as if he had said, "As a fruit of the free, undeserved love and favour of God, may you enjoy all bless∣ings, spiritual and temporal, all the good things which God hath prepared for them that love him."</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence we may easily learn, in how wide a sense, the term <HI>peace-makers</HI> is to be understood. In its literal meaning it implies, those lovers of God and man, who utterly detest and abhor all strife and debate, all variance and contention: and accordingly labour with all their might either to prevent this fire of hell from being kindled, or when it is kindled, from breaking out, or when it is broke out, from spreading any farther. They endeavour to calm the stormy spirits of men, to quiet their turbulent passions, to soften the minds of contending parties, and, if possible, reconcile them to each other. They use all innocent arts, and employ all their strength, all the talents which God has given them, as well to preserve peace, where it is, as to restore it, where it is not. It is the joy of then heart, to promote, to confirm, to increase mutual good-will among men: but more especially among the children of God, how∣ever distinguished by things of smaller importance. That as they have all <HI>one</HI> Lord, <HI>one faith;</HI> as they <HI>are</HI> all <HI>called in one hope of their calling,</HI> so they may all <HI>walk worthy of the vocation wherewith they are called: with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love; endea∣vouring to keep the unity of the spirit, in the bond of peace.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="87" REF="028060_0358_0FD68D355D40C118"/>
4. But in the full extent of the word, a <HI>peace-maker</HI> is one, that as he hath opportunity, <HI>doth good unto all men:</HI> one that being filled with the love of God and of all mankind, cannot confine the expressions of it to his own family, or friends, or acquaintance, or party: or to those of his own opinions; no, nor those who are partakers of like precious faith: but steps ever all these narrow bounds, that he may do good to every man: that he may some way or other manifest his love to neighbours and strangers, friends and enemies. He doth good to them all, as he hath opportunity, that is on every possible occasion; <HI>redeeming the time,</HI> in order thereto, <HI>buying up every opportunity,</HI> improving every hour, losing no moment wherein he may profit another. He does good, not of one particular kind, but good in general: in every possible way, em∣ploying herein all his talents of every kind; all his powers and faculties of body and soul; all his fortune, his interest, his reputation; desiring only, that when his Lord cometh he may say, "Well done, good and faithful servant!"</P>
<P N="5">5. He doth good, to the uttermost of his pow∣er, even to the bodies of all men. He rejoices to <HI>deal his bread to the hungry,</HI> and to <HI>cover the naked with a garment.</HI> Is any a stranger? he takes him in, and relieves him according to his necessities. Are any sick or in prison? he visits them, and administers such help as they stand most in need of. And all this he does, not as unto man; but remembering him that hath said, <HI>inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="88" REF="028060_0359_0FD68D3912F20190"/>
6. How much more does he rejoice, if he can do any good to the soul of any man! this pow∣er indeed belongeth unto God. It is he only that changes the heart, without which every o∣ther change is lighter than vanity. Neverthe∣less it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ses him who worketh all in all, to help man chiefly by man; to convey his own power and blessing and love, thro' one man to ano∣ther. Therefore, altho' it be certain; that <HI>the help which is done upon earth,</HI> God <HI>doth it himself,</HI> yet has no man need, on this account, to stand idle in his vineyard. The peace-maker cannot: he is ever labouring therein, and as an instrument in God's hand, preparing the ground for his master's use, or sowing the seed of the king∣dom, or watering what is already sown, if hap∣ly God may give the increase. According to the measure of grace which he has received, he uses all diligence, either to reprove the gross sinner, to reclaim those who run on headlong in the broad way of destruction; or <HI>to give light to them that sit in darkness,</HI> and are ready to <HI>pe∣rish for lack of knowledge;</HI> or to <HI>support the weak,</HI> to <HI>lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees;</HI> or to bring back and heal that which was <HI>lame</HI> and <HI>turned out of the way.</HI> Nor is he less zealous to confirm those who are al∣ready striving to enter in at the straight gate; to strengthen those that stand, that they may <HI>run with patience the race which is set before them;</HI> to <HI>build up in</HI> their <HI>most holy faith,</HI> those that know in whom they have believed: to exhort them to stir up the gift of God which is in them,
<PB N="89" REF="028060_0360_0FD68D3CE8FC0508"/>that daily <HI>growing in grace, an emtrance may be ministered unto them abundantly into the ever∣lasting kingdom of our</HI> Lord <HI>and Saviour</HI> Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="7">7. Blessed are they who are thus comtinually employed, in the work of saith and the labour of love. <HI>For they shall be called,</HI> that is, <HI>shall be</HI> (a conimon Hebraism) <HI>the children of</HI> God. God shall continue unto them the spirit of adoption, yea, shall pour it more abundantly into their hearts. He shall bless them with all the bles∣sings of his children. He shall acknowledge them as sons before angels and men; <HI>and if sons, then heirs; heirs of</HI> God <HI>and joint heirs with</HI> Christ.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. One would imagine such a person as has been above described, so full of genuine hu∣mility, so unaffectedly serious, so mild and gen∣tle, so free from all selfish design, so devoted to God, and such an active lover of men, should be the darling of mankind. But our Lord was better acquainted with human nature, in its pre∣sent state. He therefore closes the character of this man of God, with shewing him the treat∣ment he is to expect in the world. <HI>Blessed,</HI> saith he, <HI>are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. In order to understand this throughly, let us, First, enquire, who are they that are perse∣cuted. And this we may easily learn from St. <HI>Paul:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 29.</NOTE> <HI>as of old, he that was born after the flesh, persecuted him that was born after the spi∣rit,
<PB N="90" REF="028060_0361_0FD68D3E53383A20"/>even so it is now.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tim.</NOTE> <HI>Yea,</HI> saith the apostle, <HI>and all that will live godly in</HI> Christ Jesus, <HI>shall suffer parsecution.</HI> The same we are taught by St. John.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 John iii. 13.</NOTE> <HI>Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. We know that we have passed fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m death unto life, because we love the bre∣thren.</HI> As if he had said, the brethren, the christians cannot be loved, but by them who have passed from death unto life. And most ex∣pressly, by our Lord:<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">John xv. 18, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>if the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love its own<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s but because ye are not of the world—therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, the servant is not greater than his</HI> Lord. <HI>If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.</HI></P>
<P>By all these scriptures i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> manifestly appears; who they are that are persecuted: namely, the righteous, <HI>he that is born after the spirit; all that will live godly in</HI> Christ Jesus: they that are <HI>pass∣ed from death unto life;</HI> those who <HI>are not of the world:</HI> all these who are meek and lowly in heart, that mourn for God, that hunger after his like∣ness; all that love God and their neighbour, and therefore as they have opportunity, do good unto all men.</P>
<P N="3">3. If it be, Secondly, enquired, why they are persecuted? the answer is equally plain and ob∣vious. It is <HI>for righteousness sake;</HI> because they are righteous; because they are <HI>born after the spirit;</HI> because they <HI>will live godly in</HI> Christ Jesus; because they <HI>are not of the world.</HI> What∣ever
<PB N="91" REF="028060_0362_0FD68D3FD36D9648"/>may be pretended, this is the real cause: be their insirmities more or less, still if it were not for this, they would be borne with, and the world would love its own. They are persecuted, because they are <HI>poor in spirit,</HI> that is, say the world, "Boor-spirited, mean, dastardly souls, good for nothing, not fit to live in the world!" because they mourn; "They are such dull heavy, lumpish creatures, enough to sink any one's spirite that sees them! they are mere deaths-heads; they kill innocent mirth, and spoil company wherever they come:" because they are <HI>meek;</HI> "tame, passive fools, just fit to be tramp∣led upon:" because they <HI>hunger and thirst after righteousness;</HI> "A parcel of hot-brained enthu∣siasts, gaping after they know not what, not con∣tent with rational religion, but running mad af∣ter raptures and inwards feelings:" because they are merciful, lovers of all, lovers of the evil and unthankful: "Encouraging all manner of wick∣edness; nay, tempting people to do mischief by impunity: and men who, it is to be feared, have their own religion still to seek; very loose in their-principles:" because they are pure in heart? "Uncharitable creatures! that damn all the world, but those that are of their own sort! blasphemous wretches, that pretend to make God a har, to live without sin!" above all, be∣cause they are peace-makers, because they take all opportunities of doing good to all men. This is the grand reason why they have been per∣secuted in all ages, and will be till the restituti∣on of all things.</P>
<P>"If they would but keep their religion to themselves, it would be tolerable. But it is this
<PB N="92" REF="028060_0363_0FD68D4363CBE8F0"/>spreading their errors, this infecting so many o∣thers, which is not to be endured. They do so much mischief in the world, that they ought to be tolerated no longer. It is true, the men do some things well enough; they relieve some of the poor. But this too, is only done to gain the more to their party; and so, in effect, to do the more mischief." Thus the men of the world sincerely think and speak. And the more the kingdom of God prevails, the more the peace-makers are enabled to propagate lowliness, meek∣ness, and all other divine tempers; the more mischief is done, in their account. Consequent∣ly, the more are they enraged, against the au∣thors of this, and the more vehemently will they persecute them.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let us, Thirdly, enquire, who are they that persecute them? St. Paul answers, <HI>he that is born after the flesh;</HI> every one who is not <HI>born of the spirit,</HI> or at least, desirous so to be: all that do not, at least, labour to <HI>live godly in</HI> Christ Jesus: all that are not <HI>passed from death unto life,</HI> and consequently cannot <HI>love the brethren: the world,</HI> that is according to our saviour's account, <HI>they who know not him that sent me:</HI> they who know not God, even the loving, pardoning God, by the teaching of his own spirit.</P>
<P>The reason is plain. The spirit which is in the world is directly opposite to the spirit which is of God. It must therefore needs be that those who are of the world, will be opposite to those who are of God. There is the utmost contra∣riety between them, in all their opinions, their desires, designs, and tempers. And hitherto
<PB N="93" REF="028060_0364_0FD68D45239DB4D0"/><HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pard and the kid,</HI> cannot <HI>lie down</HI> in peace <HI>together.</HI> The proud, because he is proud, can∣not but persecute the lowly; the light and airy, those that mourn: and so in every other kind; the unlikeness of disposition (were there no o∣ther) being a perpetual ground of earnity. There∣fore (were it only on this account) all the ser∣rants of the devil, will persecute the children of God.</P>
<P N="5">5. Should it be enquired, fourthly, how they will persecute them? it may be answered in ge∣neral, just in that manner and measure which the wise disposer of all, sees will be most for his glory; will tend most to his children's growth in grace, and the enlargement of his own kingdom. There is no one branch of God's government of the world, which is more to be admired than this. His car is never heavy to the threatnings of the persecutor, or the cry of the persecuted. His eye is ever open, and his hand stretched out, to direct every, the minutest circumstance. When the storm shall begin, how high it shall rise, which way it shall point its course, when and how it shall end, are all determined by his uner∣ring wisdom. The ungodly are only a sword of his: an instrument which he uses, as it pleaseth him, and which itself, when the gracious ends of his providence are answered, is cast into the fire.</P>
<P>At some rare times, as when christianity was planted first, and while it was taking root in the earth; as also when the pure doctrine of Christ began to be planted again in our nation: God permitted the storm to rise high, and his children were called to resist unto blood. There was a pe∣culiar
<PB N="94" REF="028060_0365_0FD68D47C2131120"/>reason why he suffered this with regard to the apostles, that their evidence might be the more unexceptionable. But from the annals of the church, we learn another, and a far different reason, why he suffered the heavy persecutions which arose in the second and third centuries: namely, because the mystery of iniquity did so strongly work, because of the monstrous corrup∣tions which even then reigned in the church: these God chastised, and at the same time strove to heal, by those severe but necessary visitations.</P>
<P>Perhaps the same: observation may be made, with regard to the grand persecution in our own land. God had dealt very graciously with out nation; he had poured out various blessings upon us. He had given us peace abroad and at home; and a king wise and good, beyond his years. And above all, he had caused the pure light of his gos∣pel, to arise and shine amongst us. But what re∣turn did he find? <HI>be looked for righteousness. But behold a cry!</HI> a cry of oppression and wrong, of ambition and injustice, of malice and fraud and covetousness. Yea, the cry of those who even then expired in the flames, entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth. It was then God arose to main∣tain his own cause, against those that held the truth in unrighteousness. Then he sold them into the hands of their persecutors, by a judgment mixt with mercy: an affliction to punish and yet a medi∣cine to heal the grievous backslidings of his people.</P>
<P N="6">6. But it is seldom God suffers the storm to rise so high, as torture or death or bonds or im∣prisonment. Whereas his children are frequently called to endure those lighter kinds of persecution; they frequently suffer the estrangement of kins∣folks;
<PB N="95" REF="028060_0366_0FD68D4997BF5C68"/>the loss of the friends that were as their own soul. They find the truth of their Lord's word (concerning the event, though not the de∣sign of his coming) * <HI>Suppose ye that I am come to give peace upon earth? I tell you nay; but rather division.</HI> And hence will naturally follow loss of business or employment, and consequently of sub∣stance. But all these circumstances likewise are under the wise direction of God, who allots to every one what is most expedient for him.</P>
<P N="7">7. But the persecution which attends all the children of God, is that our Lord describes in the following words, <HI>Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you</HI> (shall persecute, by re∣viling you) <HI>and say all manner of evil against you, falsely, for my sake.</HI> This cannot fail: it is the very badge of our discipleship: it is one of the seals of our calling. It is a sure portion, entailed on all the children of God: if we have it not, we are bastards and not sons. Strait thro' <HI>evil re∣port,</HI> as well as <HI>good report,</HI> lies the only way to the Kingdom. The meek, serious, humble, zea∣lous lovers of God and man, are of good report among their brethren; but of evil report with the world, who count and treat them <HI>as the filth and off-scouring of all things.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Indeed some have supposed, that before the fulness of the gentiles shall come in, the scandal of the cross will cease: that God will cause chris∣tians to be esteemed and loved, even by those who are as yet in their sins. Yea, and sure it is, that even now, he at sometimes suspends the contempt as well as the fierceness of men: <HI>be makes a man's enemies to be at peace with him</HI> for a season,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xii. 51.</NOTE>
<PB N="96" REF="028060_0367_0FD68D4C54E647E0"/>and gives him favour with his bitterest perfecutors But setting aside this exempt case, <HI>the scandal of the cross is</HI> not yet <HI>ceased:</HI> but a man may say still, <HI>if I please men, I am not the servant of</HI> Christ: let no man therefore regard that pleasing suggestion (pleasing doubtless to flesh and blood) "That bad men only <HI>pretend</HI> to hate and depise them that are good, but do indeed love and esteem them in their hearts." Not so: they may employ them sometimes; but it is for their own profit. They may put confidence in them; for they know their ways are not like other men's. But still they love them not; unless so far as the spirit of God may be striving with them. Our Saviour's words are express: <HI>if ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but because ye are not of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</HI> Yea (setting aside what exceptions may be made by the preventing grace or the peculiar providence of God) it hateth them as cordially and sincerely, as ever it did their master.</P>
<P N="9">9. It remains only to enquire, how are the children of God to behave, with regard to perse∣cution? and first, they ought not knowingly or designedly, to bring it upon themselves. This is contrary both to the example and advice of our Lord and all his apostles; who teach us not only not to seck, but to avoid it, as far as we can, with∣out injuring our conscience; without giving up any part of that righteousness, which we are to prefer before life itself. So our Lord expressly, <HI>when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into ano∣ther:</HI> which is indeed, when it can be taken, the most unexceptionable way of avoiding persecution.</P>
<P N="10">10. Yet think not, that you can always avoid it either by this, or any other means. If ever that
<PB N="97" REF="028060_0368_0FD68D4EE17A1568"/>idle imagination steals into your heart, put it to flight by that earnest caution, <HI>remember the word that I said unto you, the servant is not greater th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> his</HI> Lord. <HI>If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.</HI> Be ye <HI>wise as serpents and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣less as doves.</HI> But will this screen you from per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>u∣tion? not unless you have more wisdom tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ur master, or more innocence than the Lamb of God.</P>
<P>Neither desire to avoid it, to escape it wholly; for if you do, you are none of his. If you e∣scape the persecution, you escape the blessing; the blessing of those who are persecuted for right∣eousness sake. If you are not persecuted for right∣eousness sake, you cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven. <HI>If we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him. But if we deny him, he will also deny us.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. Nay, rather, <HI>rejoice and be exceeding glad,</HI> when men persecute you for his sake: when <HI>they persecute</HI> you by <HI>reviling</HI> you, and by <HI>saying all manner of evil against you, falsely</HI> (which they will not fail to mix with every kind of persecution; they must blacken you to excuse themselves.) <HI>For so persecuted they the prophets which were before you,</HI> those who were most eminently holy in heart and life; yea, and all the righteous which ever have been from the beginning of the world. Rejoice, because by this mark also, ye know unto whom ye belong. And because <HI>great is your reward in hea∣ven:</HI> the reward purchased by the blood of the covenant, and freely bestowed in proportion to your sufferings, as well as holiness of heart and life. <HI>Be exceeding glad;</HI> knowing that. <HI>these light afflictions, which are but for a moment, work out for you a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</HI></P>
<P N="12"><PB N="98" REF="028060_0369_0FD68D51D3A99990"/>
12. Mean time, let no persecution turn you out of the way of lowliness and meekness, of love and beneficence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 38, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Ye have heard indeed that it hath been said, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.</HI> And your miserable teachers have hence allowed you to avenge yourselves, to return evil for evil.</P>
<P><HI>But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil</HI>—not thus; not by returning it in kind. <HI>But</HI> (rather than do this) <HI>whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall com∣pel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.</HI></P>
<P>So invincible let thy meekness be. And be thy love suitable thereto. <HI>Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.</HI> Only, give not away that which is ano∣ther man's, that which is not thine own. There∣fore, 1. Take care to owe no man any thing. For what thou owest is not thy own but another man's. 2. Provide for those of thine own house∣hold. This also God hath required of thee: and what is necessary to sustain them in life and god∣liness, is also not thine own. Then, 3. Give or lend all that remains from day to day, or from year to year.

<P N="1">1. THE beauty of holiness, of that inward man of the heart, which is renewed after the image of God, cannot but strike every eye which God hath opened, every enlightened understanding. The ornament of a meek, hum∣ble, loving spirit, will at least excite the appro∣bation of all those who are capable in any degree of discerning spiritual good and evil. From the
<PB N="106" REF="028060_0375_0FD68D5B91F71348"/>hour men begin to emerge out of the darkness which covers the giddy, unthinking world, they cannot but perceive how desirable a thing it is, to be thus transformed into the likeness of him that created us. This inward religion bears the shape of God, so visibly impressed upon it, that a soul must be wholly immersed in flesh and blood, when he can doubt of its divine original. We may say of this, in a secondary sense, even as of the Son of God himself, that it is the <HI>Bright∣ness of his glory, the express image of his person:</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>The beaming forth of his</HI> eternal <HI>glory;</HI> and yet so tempered and softened, that even the children of men, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ay herein see God and live: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>the cha∣racter, the stamp, the living impression, of his per∣son,</HI> who is the fountain of beauty and love, the original source of all excellency and perfection.</P>
<P N="3">3. If religion therefore were carried no far∣ther than this, they could have no doubt con∣cerning it: they should have no objection against pursuing it with the whole ardor of their souls. But why, say they, is it clogged with other things? what need of loading it with <HI>doing</HI> and <HI>suffering?</HI> these are what damps the vigour of the soul and sinks it down to earth again Is it not enough, to <HI>follow after charity?</HI> to soar upon the wings of love? will it not suffice, to worship God who is a spirit, with the spirit of our minds, without incumbering ourselves with out∣ward things, or even thinking of them at all? is it not better, that the whole extent of our thought should be taken up with high and hea∣venly contemplation? and that instead of busying
<PB N="107" REF="028060_0376_0FD68D616BA101A0"/>ourselves at all about externals, we should only commune with God in our hearts?</P>
<P N="4">4. Many eminent men have spoken thus; have advised us "To cease from all outward ac∣tion;" wholly to withdraw from the world; to leave the body behind us; to abstract ourselves from all sensible things: to have no concern at all about outward religion, but to "work all vir∣tues in the will," as the far more excellent way, more perfective of the soul, as well as more ac∣ceptable to God.</P>

It needed not that any should tell our Lord, of this master-piece of the wisdom from be∣neath! this fairest of all the devices wherewith <HI>satan</HI> hath ever perverted the right ways of the Lord. And O! what instruments hath he found from time to time, to employ in this his service! to wield this grand engine of hell, against some of the most important truths of God! men that <HI>would deceive if it were possible the very elect;</HI> the men of faith and love: yea, that have for a sea∣son deceived and led away no inconsiderable num∣ber of them; who have fallen in all ages into the gilded snare, and hardly escaped with the skin of their teeth.</P>
<P N="6">6. But has our Lord been wanting on his part? has he not sufficently guarded us against this pleasing delusion? has he not armed us here with armour of proof against satan <HI>transformed into an angel of light?</HI> yea, verily: he here de∣fends, in the clearest and strongest manner, the active, patient religion he had just described: what can be fuller and plainer than the words he immediately subjoins, to what he had said of doing and suffering? <HI>ye are the salt of the earth.
<PB N="108" REF="028060_0377_0FD68D64D2BC8240"/>But if the salt have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men. Ye are the light of the world: a city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither a men light a candle and put it under a bushel; but on a candlestick, and it giveth light to all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and glorify your father which is in heaven.</HI></P>
<P>In order fully to explain and enforce these im∣portant words, I shall endeavour to shew, First, that christianity is essentially a social religion, and that to turn it into a solitary one, is to destroy it: Secondly, that to conceal this religion is impossi∣ble, as well as utterly contrary to the design of its author. I shall, Thirdly, answer some ob∣jections; and conclude the whole with a prac∣tical application.</P>
<P N="1">I. 1. First, I shall endeavour to shew, that christianity is essentially a social religion; and that to turn it into a solitary religion, is indeed to destroy it.</P>
<P>By christianity I mean, that method of wor∣shipping God, which is here revealed to man by Jesus Christ. When I say, this is essentially a social religion, I mean not only, that it cannot subsist so well, but that it cannot subsist at all without society, without living and conversing with other men. And in shewing this, I shall confine myself to those considerations, which will arise from the very discourse before us. But if this be shewn, then doubtless to turn this reli∣gion into a solitary one, is to destroy it.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="028060_0378_0FD68D6613E6C9A0"/>
Not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we can in any wise condemn the in∣termixing solitude or retirement with society. This is not only allowable, but expedient: nay, it is necessary as daily experience shews, for every one that either already is, or desires to be a real christian. It can hardly be that we should spend one entire day, in a continued intercourse with men, without suffering loss in our soul, and in some measure grieving the holy spirit of God. We have need daily to retire from the world, at least, morning and evening, to converse with God, to commune more freely with our Father which is in secret. Nor indeed can a man of experience condemn, even longer seasons of re∣ligious retirement, so they do not imply any ne∣glect of the worldly employ, wherein the provi∣dence of God has placed us.</P>
<P N="2">2. Yet such retirement must not swallow up all our time; this would be to destroy, not ad∣vance true religion. For, that the religion de∣scribed by our Lord in the foregoing words, can∣not subsist without society, without our living and conversing with other men, is manifest from hence, that several of the most essential branches thereof, can have no place, if we have no inter∣course with the world.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is no disposition (for instance) which is more essential to christianity than meekness. Now altho' this, as it implies resignation to God, or patience in pain and sickness, may subsist in a desert, in a hermit's cell, in total solitude; yet as it implies (which it no less necessarily does) mild∣ness, gentleness and long-suffering, it cannot pos∣sibly have a being, it has no place under hea∣ven, without an intercourse with other men.
<PB N="110" REF="028060_0379_0FD68D67EF5A7790"/>So that to attempt turning this into a solita∣ry virtue, is to destroy it from the face of the earth.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another necessary branch of true christi∣anity, is peace-making, or doing of good. That this is equally essential with any of the other parts of the religion of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> there can be no stronger argument to evince (and therefore it would be absurd to allege any other) than that it is here inserted in the original plan he has laid down, of the fundamentals of his religion. Therefore to set aside this, is the same daring in∣sait on the authority of our great master, as to set aside mercifulness, purity of heart, or any other branch of his institution. But this is ap∣parently set aside, by all who call us to the wil∣derness; who recommend entire solitude either to the babes, or the young men, or the fathers in <HI>Christ.</HI> For will any man affirm, that a soli∣tary christian (so called, tho' it is little less than a contradiction in terms) can be a merciful man? that is, one that takes every opportunity of do∣ing all good to all men? what can be more plain, than that this fundamental branch of the religi∣on of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> cannot possibly subsist with∣out society, without our living and conversing with other men?</P>
<P N="5">5. But is it not expedient however (one might naturally ask) to converse only with good men? only with those whom we know to be meek and merciful; holy of heart and holy of life? is it not expedient to refrain from any conversation or intercourse, with men of the opposite charac∣ter? men who do not obey, perhaps do not be∣lieve, the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ? the
<PB N="111" REF="028060_0380_0FD68D69F11DE9E0"/>advice of St. Paul to the christians at <HI>Corinth,</HI> may s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m to favour this. <HI>I</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. v. 9.</NOTE> <HI>wrote unto you in an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>le, not to company with fornicators.</HI> And it is certainly not advisable so to company with them, or with any of the workers of iniquity, as to have any particular familiarity, or any strict∣ness of friendship with them. To contract or continue an intimacy with any such, is no way expedient for a christian. It must necessarily ex∣pose him to abundance of dangers and snares, out of which he can have no reasonable hope of deliverance.</P>
<P>But the apostle does not forbid us, to have any intercourse at all, even with the men that know not God. For then, says he, <HI>ye must needs go out of the world,</HI> which he could never advise them to do. But he subjoins, <HI>If</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ver. 11.</NOTE> <HI>any man that is called a brother,</HI> that professes himself a chris∣tian, <HI>be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner—now I have written unto you not to keep company</HI> with him; <HI>with such an one, no not to eat.</HI> This must necessarily imply, that we break off all fa∣miliarity, all intimacy of acquaintance with them.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Thess. iii. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Yet count him not,</HI> saith the apostle elsewhere, <HI>as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother:</HI> plain∣ly shewing, that even in such a case as this, we are not to renounce all fellowship with him: so that here is no advice, to separate wholly, even from wicked men. Yea, these very words teach us quite the contrary.</P>
<P N="6">6. Much more the words of our Lord: who is so far from directing us, to break off all com∣merce with the world, that without it, accord∣ing
<PB N="112" REF="028060_0381_0FD68D6B9A11A908"/>to his account of christianity, we cannot be christians at all. It would be easy to shew, that some intercourse even with ungodly and un∣holy men, is absolutely needful in order to the full exertion of every temper, which he has de∣scribed as the way of the kingdom: that it is in∣dispensibly necessary in order to the compleat ex∣ercise of poverty of spirit, of mourning, and of every other disposition which has a place here, in the genuine religion of Jesus Christ. Yea, it is necessary to the very being of several of them; of that meekness, for example, which instead of demanding <HI>an eye for an eye, or a tooth for a tooth,</HI> doth <HI>not resist evil;</HI> but causes us rather, when smitten <HI>on the right cheek, to turn the other also:</HI> of that mercifulness, whereby we <HI>love our ene∣mies, bless them that curse us, do good to them that hate us, and pray for them which despitefully use us and persecute us:</HI> and of that complication of love and all holy tempers, which is exercised in su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ering for righteousness sake. Now all these, it is clear, could have no being, were we to have no commerce with any but real christians.</P>
<P N="7">7. Indeed were we wholly to separate our∣selves from sinners, how could we possibly an∣swer that character, which our Lord gives us in these very words: <HI>ye</HI> (christians, ye that are low∣ly, serious and meek; ye that hunger after right∣eousness, that love God and man, that do good to all, and therefore suffer evil: ye) <HI>are the salt of the earth.</HI> It is your very nature to season whatever is round about you. It is the na∣ture of the divine favour which is in you, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ead to whatsoever you touch; to diffuse itself,
<PB N="113" REF="028060_0382_0FD68D6CCA3860F8"/>on every side, to all those among whom you are. This is the great reason why the Providence of God has so mingled you together with other men, that whatever grace you have received of God may through you be communicated to others; that every holy temper, and word, and work of yours, may have an influence on them also. By this means a check will in some measure be given to the corruption which is in the world; and a small part, at least, saved from the general infec∣tion, and rendered holy and pure before God.</P>
<P N="8">8. That we may the more diligently labour to season all we can, with every holy and heavenly temper, our Lord proceeds to shew the desperate state of those, who do not impart the religion they have received; which indeed they cannot possibly fail to do, so long as it remains in their own hearts. <HI>If the salt hath lost its savour, where∣with shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out, and trodden under foot of men.</HI> If ye who were holy and heavenly∣minded, and consequently zealous of good works, have no longer that savour in yourselves, and do therefore no longer season others; if you are grown flat, insipid, dead, both carcless of your own soul, and useless to the souls of other men, <HI>wherewith shall</HI> ye <HI>be salted?</HI> How shall ye be recovered? What help? What hope? Can taste∣less salt be restored to its savour! No; <HI>it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out,</HI> even as the mire in the streets, <HI>and to be trodden under foot of men,</HI> to be overwhelmed with everlasting comtempt. If ye had never known the Lord, there might have
<PB N="114" REF="028060_0383_0FD68D6EDBF2D8A0"/>been hope, if ye had never been <HI>found in him.</HI> But what can you say to that his solemn declara∣tion, just parallel to what he hath here spoken?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xv. 2, 5, 6.</NOTE> <HI>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he</HI> (the Father) <HI>taketh away. He that abideth in me, and I in him, bringeth forth much fruit.—If a man abide not in me</HI> (or, do not bring forth fruit) <HI>be is cast out as a branch and withered; and men gather them</HI> (not to plant them again, but) <HI>to cast them into the fire.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Toward those who have never tasted of the good word, God is indeed pitiful and of tender mercy. But justice takes place with regard to those who have tasted that the Lord is gracious, and have afterwards <HI>turned back from the holy com∣mandment</HI> then <HI>delivered to them.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 4, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>For it is im∣possible for those who were once enlightened,</HI> in whose hearts God had once shined, to enlighten them with the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ; <HI>who have tasted of the heavenly gift,</HI> of redemption in his blood, the forgiveness of sins; <HI>and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</HI> of lowliness, of meekness, and of the love of God and man shed abroad in their hearts, by the Holy Ghost which was given un∣to them: <HI>And have fallen away,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>(here is not a supposition, but a flat declaration of matter of fact) <HI>to renew them again unto re∣pentance: seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of</HI> God <HI>afresh, and put him to an open shame.</HI></P>
<P>But that none may misunderstand these awful words, if should be carefully observed, 1. Who they are that are here spoken of; namely, they,
<PB N="115" REF="028060_0384_0FD6288071523C68"/>and they only, who <HI>were once</HI> thus <HI>enlightened.</HI> They only <HI>who did taste of</HI> that <HI>heavenly gift, and were</HI> thus <HI>made partakers of the Holy Ghost.</HI> So that all who have not experienced these things, are wholly unconcerned in this scripture. 2. What that falling away is which is here spoken of. It is an absolute, total apostacy. A believ∣er may fall, and not fall away. He may fall and rise again. And if he should fall, even into sin, yet this case, dreadful as it is, is not despe∣rate. For <HI>we have an advocate with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Father,</HI> Jesus Christ <HI>the righteous; and he is the propitia∣tion for our sins.</HI> But let him above all things beware, lest his <HI>heart be hardened by the deceitful∣ness of sin:</HI> lest he should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nk lower and lower, till he wholly fall away, till he become as <HI>salt</HI> that hath <HI>lost its savour: for if we</HI> thus <HI>sin wil∣fully, after we have received the</HI> experimental <HI>knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins: But a certain, fearful looking for of fiery indignation, which shall devour the ad∣versaries.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. 1. "But although we may not wholly se∣parate ourselves from mankind, although it be granted, we ought to season them, with the re∣ligion which God has wrought in our hearts, yet may not this be done insensibly? may we not convey this into others in a secret, and almost imperceptible manner? so that scarce any one shall be able to observe, how or when it is done? even as salt conveys its own savour, into that which is seasoned thereby, without any noise, and without being liable to any outward obser∣vation.
<PB N="116" REF="028060_0385_0FD68D77B1801E80"/>And if so, altho' we do not go out of the world, yet we may lie hid in it. We may thus far keep our religion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>selves, and not offend those whom we cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>p."</P>
<P N="2">2. Of this plausible reasoning of flesh and blood, our Lord was well aware also. And he has given a full answer to it in those words, which come now to be considered: in explain∣ing which I shall endeavour to shew, as I propos∣ed to do in the second place, that so long as true religion abides in our hearts, it is impossible to conceal it, as well as absolutely contrary to the design of its great author.</P>
<P>And, First, It is impossible for any that have it, to conceal the religion of Jesus Christ. This our Lord makes plain beyond all contradiction, by a two-fold comparison. <HI>Ye are the light of the world. A city set upon an hill cannot be hid.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ye</HI> christians <HI>are the light of the world,</HI> with regard both to your tempers and actions. Your holiness makes you as conspicuous, as the sun in the midst of heaven. As ye cannot go out of the world, so neither can ye stay in it, without appearing to all mankind. Ye may not flee from men, and while ye are among them, it is impossible to hide your lowliness and meek∣ness, and those other dispositions whereby ye as∣pire to be perfect, as your Father which is in hea∣ven is perfect. Love cannot be hid any more than light; and least of all, when it shines forth in action; when ye exercise yourselves in the la∣bour of love, in beneficence of every kind. As well may men think to hide a city, as to hide a christian: yea, as well may they conceal a
<PB N="117" REF="028060_0386_0FD68D79B63E8D08"/>city set upon a hill, as a holy, zealous, active lover of God and man.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is true, men who love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil, will take all possible pains to prove, that the light which is in you is darkness. They will say evil, all manner of evil, falsely, of the good which is in you: they will lay to your charge that which is farthest from your thoughts, which is the very re∣verse of all you are and all you do. And your patient continuance in well-doing, your meek suffering all things for the Lord's sake, your calm, humble joy in the midst of persecution, your un∣wearied labour to overcome evil with good, will make you still more visible and conspicuous than ye were before.</P>
<P N="4">4. So impossible it is, to keep our religion from being seen, unless we cast it away: so vain is the thought, of hiding the light, unless by putting it out. Sure it is, that a secret, unob∣served religion cannot be the religion of Jesus Christ. Whatever religion can be concealed, is not christianity. If a christian could be hid, he could not be compared to a city set upon an hill; to the light of the world, the sun shining from heaven, and seen by all the world below. Never therefore let it enter into the heart of him whom God hath renewed in the spirit of his mind, to hide that light, to keep his religion to himself; especially considering it is not only impossible to conceal true christianity, but likewise absolute∣ly contrary to the design of the great author of it.</P>
<P N="5">5. This plainly appears from the following words: <HI>neither do men light a candle to put it
<PB N="118" REF="028060_0387_0FD68D7B449CE880"/>under a bushel.</HI> As if he had said, as men do not light a candle, only to cover and conceal it, so neither does God enlighten any soul with his glo∣rious knowledge and love, to have it covered or concealed, either by prudence, falsely so called, or shame, or voluntary humility: to have it hid either in a desert, or in the world; either by a∣voiding men, or in conversing with them. <HI>But they put it on a candlestick, and it giveth light to all that are in the house.</HI> In like manner, it is the design of God, that every christian should be in an open point of view: that he may give light to all around, that he may visibly express the re∣ligion of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="6">6. Thus hath God in all ages spoken to the world, not only by precept but by example also. He hath <HI>not left himself without witness</HI> in any nation, where the sound of the gospel had gone forth, without a few who testified his truth, by their lives as well as their words. These have been <HI>as lights shining in a dark place.</HI> And from time to time they have been the means of enlight∣ening some, of preserving a remnant, a little seed, which was <HI>counted unto the</HI> Lord <HI>for a gene∣ration.</HI> They have led a few poor sheep out of the darkness of the world, and guided their feet into the way of peace.</P>
<P N="7">7. One might imagine, that where both scrip∣ture and the reason of things speak so clearly and expressly, there could not be much advanced on the other side, at least, not with any appear∣ance of truth. But they who imagine thus, know little of the depths of <HI>Satan.</HI> After all that scripture and reason have said, so exceeding plausible are the pretences for solitary religion,
<PB N="119" REF="028060_0388_0FD68D7CA7040D68"/>for a christian's going out of the world, or at least hiding himself in it, that we need all the wisdom of God to see through the snare, and all the power of God to escape it: so many and strong are the objections which have been brought, against being social, open, active chris∣tians.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. To answer these was the third thing which I proposed. And, first, it has been often objected, that religion does not lie in outward things, but in the heart, the inmost soul: that it is the union of the soul with God, the life of God in the soul of man: that outside religion is nothing worth; seeing God <HI>delighteth not in burnt-offerings,</HI> in outward services, but a pure and holy heart is the <HI>sacrifice he will not despise.</HI></P>
<P>I answer, it is most true, that the root of re∣ligion lies in the heart, in the inmost soul: that this is, the union of the soul with God; the life of God in the soul of man. But if this root be really in the heart, it cannot but put forth branches. And these are, the several in∣stances of outward obedience, which partake of the same nature with the root; and consequently, are not only marks or signs, but substantial parts of religion.</P>
<P>It is also true, that bare outside religion, which has no root in the heart, is nothing worth; that God delighteth not in <HI>such</HI> outward ser∣vices, no more than in Jewish burnt-offerings, and that a pure and holy heart is a sacrifice, with which he is always well pleased. But he is also well pleased with all that outward service, which
<PB N="120" REF="028060_0389_0FD68D7E18E73A98"/>arises from the heart: with the sacrifice of our prayers (whether public or private) of our p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ses and thanksgivings: with the sacrifice of our goods, humbly devoted to him, and employ∣ed wholly to his glory: and with that of our bodies, which he peculiarly claims; which the apostle <HI>beseeches</HI> us, <HI>by the mercies of</HI> God, <HI>to pre∣sent unto him, a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to</HI> God.</P>
<P N="2">2. A second objection, nearly related to this is, that love is all in all: that it is <HI>the fulfilling of the saw, the end of the commandment,</HI> of every com∣mandment of God: that all we do and all we suffer, if we have not charity, or love, profiteth us nothing: and therefore the apostle directs us, <HI>to follow after charity,</HI> and terms this, <HI>the more excellent way.</HI></P>
<P>I answer, it is granted, that the love of God and man, arising from <HI>faith unfeigned,</HI> is all in all, the fulfilling of the law, the end of every commandment of God. It is true, that without this whatever we do, whatever we suffer profits us nothing. But it does not follow, that love is all in such a sense, as to supe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cede either faith or good works. It is <HI>the fulfilling of the law,</HI> not by releasing us from, but by constraining us to obey it. It is <HI>the end of the commandment,</HI> as every commandment leads to and centres in it. It is allowed, that whatever we do or suffer, without love, profits us nothing. But withal whatever we do or suffer in love, though it were only the suffering reproach for <HI>Christ,</HI> or the giv∣ing a cup of cold water in his name, it shall in no wise lose its reward.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="121" REF="028060_0390_0FD68D8751E16868"/>
3. "But does not the apostle direct us, to <HI>fol∣low after charity?</HI> And does he not term it, <HI>a more excellent way?</HI>"—He does direct us to <HI>follow after charity.</HI> But not after that alone. His words are,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiv. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Follow after charity; and desire spi∣ritual gifts.</HI> Yea, <HI>follow after charity;</HI> and desire to spend and to be spent for your brethren. <HI>Fol∣low after charity;</HI> and as you have opportunity, do good to all men.</P>
<P>In the same verse also, wherein he terms this, The way of love, <HI>a more excellent way,</HI> he directs the <HI>Corinthians</HI> to desire other gifts besides it: yea, to desire them earnestly.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xii. 31.</NOTE> <HI>Covet earnestly,</HI> saith he, <HI>the best gifts: And yet I shew unto you a more excellent way.</HI> More excellent than what? Than the gifts of <HI>healing,</HI> of <HI>speaking with tongues,</HI> and of <HI>interpreting,</HI> mentioned in the preceding verse. But not more excellent than the way of obedience. Of this the apostle is not speaking. Neither is he speaking of outward religion at all. So that this text is quite wide of the present question.</P>
<P>But suppose the apostle had been speaking of outward as well as inward religion, and com∣paring them together: suppose in the comparison he had given the preference ever so much to the latter: suppose he had preferred (as he justly might) a loving heart, before all outward works whatever: Yet it would not follow, that we were to reject, either one or the other. No; God hath joined them together from the beginning of the world. And let not man put them asunder.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="122" REF="028060_0391_0FD68D889A9AB310"/>
4. "But God <HI>is a Spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.</HI> And is not this enough? Nay, ought we not to employ the whole strength of our mind herein? Does not attending to outward things, clog the soul, that it cannot soar aloft in holy contemplation? Does it not damp the vigour of our thought? Has it not a natural tendency, to incumber and distract the mind? Whereas St. <HI>Paul</HI> would have us <HI>to be without carefulness,</HI> and to <HI>wait upon the</HI> Lord <HI>without distraction.</HI>"</P>
<P>I answer, God is a Spirit, and they that wor∣ship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth. Yea, and this is enough: we ought to employ the whole strength of our mind therein. But then I would ask, What is it to worship God, a Spirit, in spirit and in truth? Why, it is to wor∣ship him with our spirit; to worship him in that manner, which none but spirits are capable of. It is, to believe in him, as a wise, just, holy Being, of purer eyes than to behold iniquity: and yet merciful, gracious, and long-suffering; forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin: cast∣ing all our sins behind his back, and accepting us in the beloved. It is, To love him, to delight in him, to desire him, with all our heart, and mind, and soul, and strength: to imitate him we love, by purifying ourselves, even as he is pure; and to obey him whom we love and in whom we believe, both in thought, and word, and work. Consequently, one branch of the worshipping God in spirit and in truth, is the keeping his out∣ward commandments. To glorify him therefore with our bodies as well as with our spirits, to go
<PB N="123" REF="028060_0392_0FD68D8A51F22978"/>thro' outward work with hearts lifted up to him, to make our daily employment a sacrifice to God; to buy and sell, to eat and drink to his glory: this is worshipping God in spirit and in truth, as much as the praying to him in a wilderness.</P>
<P N="5">5. But if so, then contemplation is only one way of worshipping God in spirit and in truth. Therefore to give ourselves up entirely to this, would be to destroy many branches of spiritual worship, all equally acceptable to God, and equally profitable, not hurtful, to the soul. For it is a great mistake to suppose, that an attention to those outward things, whereto the providence of God hath called us, is any clog to a christian, or any hinderance at all to his always seeing him that is invisible. It does not at all damp the ar∣dor of his thought, it does not incumber or di∣stract his mind; it gives him no uneasy or hurt∣ful care, who does it all as unto the Lord: who hath learned, whatsoever he doth in word or deed, to do all in the name of the Lord Jesus: having only one eye of the soul, which moves round on outward things, and one immovably fixed on God. Learn what this meaneth, ye poor recluses, that you may clearly discern your own littleness of faith. Yea, that you may no longer judge others by yourselves, go and learn what that meaneth:
<Q><L>Thou, O Lord, in tender love</L>
<L>Dost all my burdens bear;</L>

<P N="6">6. But the grand objection is still behind. "We appeal, say they, to experience. Our light did shine: we used outward things many years: and yet they profited nothing. We at∣tended on all the ordinances: but we were no better for it; nor indeed any one else: nay we were the worse. For we fancied ourselves chri∣stians for so doing, when we knew not what chri∣stianity meant."</P>
<P>I allow the fact. I allow that you and ten thou∣sand more have thus abused the ordinances of God: mistaking the means for the end: suppo∣sing that the doing these, or some other outward works, either was the religion of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> or would be accepted in the place of it. But let the abuse be taken away and the use remain. Now use all outward things; but use them with a constant eye to the renewal of your soul in righteousness and true holiness.</P>
<P N="7">7. But this is not all. They affirm, "Expe∣rience likewise shews, that the trying to do good is but lost labour: what does it avail to feed or cloath men's bodies, if they are just dropping into everlasting fire? and what good can any man do to their souls? if these are changed, God doth it himself. Besides, all men are ei∣ther good, at least desirous so to be, or obsti∣nately evil. Now the former have no need of us. Let them ask help of God, and it shall be
<PB N="125" REF="028060_0394_0FD68D8E93644F48"/>given them. And the latter will receive no help from us. Nay, and our Lord forbids, to <HI>cast our pearls before swine.</HI>"</P>
<P>I answer, 1. Whether they will finally be lost or saved, you are expressly commanded to feed the hungry and cloath the naked. If you can, and do not, whatever becomes of them, you shall go away into everlasting fire. 2. Though it is God only changes hearts, yet he generally doth it by man. It is our part to do all that in us lies, as diligently as if we could change them ourselves, and then to leave the event to him. 3. God in answer to their prayers, builds up his children by each other in every good gift; nourishing and strengthening the whole <HI>body, by that which every joint supplieth.</HI> So that <HI>the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee;</HI> no, nor even <HI>the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</HI> Lastly, how are you assured, that the persons before you are dogs or swine? judge them not, until you have tried. <HI>How knowest thou, O man, but thou mayest gain thy brother?</HI> but thou mayest under God, save his soul from death? when he spurns thy love and blasphemes the good word, then it is time to give him up to God.</P>
<P N="8">8. "We have tried. We have laboured to reform sinners. And what did it avail? on ma∣ny we could make no impression at all: and if some were changed for a while, yet their good∣ness was but as the morning dew; and they were soon as bad, nay, worse than ever. So that we only hurt them—and ourselves too; for our minds were hurried and discomposed; perhaps filled with anger instead of love. Therefore
<PB N="126" REF="028060_0395_0FD68D944D67F220"/>we had better have kept our religion to our∣selves."</P>
<P>It is very possible this fact also may be true: that you have tried to do good and have not suc∣ceeded; yea, that those who seemed reformed, relapsed into sin, and their last state was worse than the first. And what marvel? is the ser∣vant above his master? but how often did he strive to save sinners: and they would not hear: or when they had followed him a while, they turned back as a dog to his vomit. But he did not therefore desist from striving to do good: no more should you, whatever your success be. It is your part, to do as you are commanded: the event is in the hand of God. You are not ac∣countable for this: leave it to him, who orders all things well. <HI>In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withold not thy hand; for thou know∣est not whether shall prosper,</HI> Eccles. ix. 6.</P>
<P>"But the trial hurries and frets your own soul." Perhaps it did so for this very reason, because you thought you was accountable for the event, which no man is, nor indeed can be. Or perhaps, because you was off your guard; you was not watchful ever your own spirit. But this is no reason for disobeying God. Try again; but try more warily than before. Do good (as you forgive) <HI>not seven times only; but until seventy times seven.</HI> Only be wiser by experience: at∣tempt it every time more cautiously than be∣fore. Be more humbled before God, more deeply convinced, that of yourself you can do nothing. Be more jealous over your own spirit:
<PB N="127" REF="028060_0396_0FD68D9753B2D4D8"/>more gentle and watchful unto prayer. Thus <HI>cast your bread upon the waters, and you shall find it again after many days.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. 1. Notwithstanding all these plausible pretences for hiding it, <HI>let your light so shine be∣fore men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</HI> This is the practical application which our Lord himself makes of the foregoing considerations.</P>
<P><HI>Let your light so shine</HI>—Your lowliness of heart, your gentleness and meekness of wisdom: your serious, weighty concern for the things of eternity, and sorrow for the sins and miseries of men: your earnest desire of universal holiness and full happiness in God: your tender good∣will to all mankind, and fervent love to your su∣preme benefactor. Endeavour not to conceal this light, wherewith God hath enlightened your soul: but let it <HI>shine before men,</HI> before all with whom you are, in the whole tenour of your conversation. Let it shine still more eminently in your actions, in your doing all possible good to all m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n: and in your suffering for righteous∣ness-sake, while you <HI>rejoice and are exceeding glad, knowing that great is your reward in hea∣ven.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works:</HI> so far let a christian be from ever designing, or desiring to conceal his religion. On the coutrary, let it be your desire, not to conceal it; not to put the <HI>light under a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ushel.</HI> Let it be your care, to place it <HI>on a can∣dlestic,
<PB N="128" REF="028060_0397_0FD68D9858F91CB8"/>that it may give light to all that are in the house.</HI> Only take heed, not to seek your own praise herein, not to desire any honour to your∣selves. But let it be your sole aim, that all, who see your good works, may <HI>glorify your Father which is in heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Be this your one ultimate end in all things. With this view, be plain, open, undisguised, let your love be without dissimulation: why should you hide fair, disinterested love? let there be no guile found in your mouth: let your words be the genuine picture of your heart. Let there be no darkness or reservedness in your conver∣sation, no disguise in your behaviour. Leave this to those who have other designs in view; designs which will not bear the light. Be ye artless and simple to all mankind; that all may see the grace of God which is in you. And al∣though some will harden their hearts, yet others will take knowledge, that ye have been with <HI>Jesus,</HI> and by returning themselves <HI>to the great Bishop of their souls, glorify your Father which is in heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. With this one design, that men may <HI>glo∣rify</HI> God <HI>in you,</HI> go on in his name, and in the power of his might. Be not ashamed, even to stand alone, so it be in the ways of God. Let the light which is in your heart, shine in all good works, both works of piety and works of mercy. And in order to inlarge your ability of doing good, renounce all supersluities. Cut off all unnecessary expense, in food, in furniture, in apparel. Be a good steward of every gift of God, even of these his lowest gifts. Cut off all unnecessary expense of time, all needless or useless
<PB N="129" REF="028060_0398_0FD68D99D756A3D0"/>employments. And <HI>whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.</HI> In a word, be thou full of faith and love: do good: suffer evil. And herein be thou <HI>stedfast, unmovable:</HI> Yea, <HI>al∣ways abounding in the work of the</HI> Lord; <HI>forasmuch as thou knowest that thy labour is not in vain in the</HI> Lord.</P>

<P>Think not that I am come to destroy th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or the Prophets; I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. AMONG the multitude of reproaches which fell upon him who <HI>was despised and rejected of men,</HI> it could not fail to be one, that he was a teacher of novelties, an introducer of a <HI>new religion.</HI> This might be affirmed with
<PB N="134" REF="028060_0401_0FD68DA21333BDB0"/>the more colour, because many of the expres∣sions he had used, were not common among the <HI>Jews:</HI> either they did not use them at all, or not in the same sense, not in so full and strong a meaning. Add to this, that the worshipping God <HI>in spirit and in truth,</HI> must always appear a new religion, to those who have hitherto known no∣thing but outside worship, nothing but the <HI>form of Godliness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. And it is not improbable, some might hope it was so: that he was abolishing the old religion, and bringing in another; one which they might slatter themselves, would be an easier way to hea∣ven. But our Lord refutes in these words both the vain hopes of the one, and the groundless ca∣lumnies of the other.</P>
<P>I shall consider them in the same order as they lie, taking each verse for a distinct head of dis∣course.</P>
<P N="1">I. 1. And, First, <HI>Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets. I am not come to destroy but to fulfil.</HI></P>
<P>The ritual or ceremonial law, delivered by <HI>Moses</HI> to the children of <HI>Israel,</HI> containing all the injunctions and ordinances which related to the old sacrifices and service of the temple, our Lord indeed did come to destroy, to dissolve and utterly abolish. To this bear all the apostles wit∣ness: not only Barnabas and Paul, who vehe∣mently withstood those who taught, that Chris∣tians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts. xv. 6.</NOTE> <HI>ought to keep the law of</HI> Moses: not only St. Peter, who termed the insisting on this, on
<PB N="135" REF="028060_0402_0FD68DA4EE5A39E8"/>the observance of the ritual law, a<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts xv. 10.</NOTE> <HI>templ∣ing</HI> God, <HI>and putting a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers,</HI> saith he, <HI>nor we were able to bear:</HI> But <HI>all the apostles, elders and brethren being assembled with one accord,</HI> de∣clared, that to command them to keep this law, was to<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ver. 24.</NOTE> <HI>subver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their souls;</HI> and that <HI>it seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to them, to lay no</HI> such <HI>burthens upon</HI> them. This <HI>hand-writing of ordi∣nances our</HI> Lord did <HI>blot out, take away and nail to his cross.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. But the moral law, contained in the ten commandments, and inforced by the prophets, he did not take away. It was not the design of his coming, to revoke any part of this. This is a law which never can be broken, which <HI>stands fast as the faithful witness in heaven.</HI> The moral stands on an entirely different foundation, from the ceremonial or ritual law; which was only de∣signed for a temporary restraint upon a disobedi∣ent and stiff-necked people: whereas this was from the beginning of the world; being <HI>written not on tables of stone,</HI> but on the hearts of all the children of men, when they came out of the hands of the Creator. And however the letters once wrote by the finger of God, are now in a great measure defaced by sin, yet can they not wholly be blotted out, while we have any con∣sciousness of good and evil. Every part of this law must remain in force, upon all mankind, and in all ages: as not depending either on time or place, or any other circumstances liable to change; but on the nature of God, and the na∣ture
<PB N="136" REF="028060_0403_0FD68DA71C0E82A8"/>of man, and their unchangeable relation to each other.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>I am not come to destroy but to fulfil.</HI> Some have conceived our Lord to mean, I am come to fulfil this, by my entire and perfect obedience to it. And it cannot be doubted but he did, in this sense, fulfil every part of it. But this does not appear to be what he intends here, being foreign to the scope of his present discourse. Without question his meaning in this place is (consistently with all that goes before and follows after) <HI>I am come</HI> to establish it in its fulness, in spite of all the glosses of men. I am come to place in a full and clear view, whatsoever was dark or obscure therein. I am come to declare the true and full import of every part of it: to shew the length and breadth, the entire extent of every commandment contained therein; and the height and depth, the inconceivable purity and spirituality of it in all its branches.</P>
<P N="4">4. And this our Lord has abundantly perform∣ed in the preceding and subsequent parts of the discourse before us: in which he has not intro∣duced a new religion into the world, but the same which was from the beginning: a religion, the substance of which is without question, "as old as the creation;" being coëval with man, and having proceeded from God, at the very time when <HI>man became a living soul</HI> (the substance, I say, for some circumstances of it, now relate to man as a fallen creature.) A religion witnessed to both by the law, and by the prophets in all suc∣ceeding generations. Yet was it never so fully explained, nor so throughly understood, till the
<PB N="137" REF="028060_0404_0FD68DA818BD4080"/>great author of it himself, condescen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d to give mankind this authentic comment on all the essen∣tial branches of it: at the same time declaring it should never be changed, but remain in force to the end of the world.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. <HI>For verily I say unto you</HI> (a solemn pre∣face, which denotes both the importance and certainty of what is spoken) <HI>till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled.</HI></P>
<P><HI>One jot</HI>—it is literally, <HI>not one Iota,</HI> not the most inconsiderable vowel, <HI>or one tittle,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, one corner, or point of a consonant. It is a proverbial expression, which signifies that no one commandment contained in the moral law, nor the least part of one, however inconsiderable it might seem, should ever be disannulled.</P>
<P><HI>Shall in no wise pass from the law:</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. The double negative here used, strengthens the sense, so as to admit of no con∣tradiction. And the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, it may be observed, is not barely <HI>future;</HI> declaring what <HI>will</HI> be; but has likewise the force of an <HI>impera∣tive;</HI> ordering what <HI>shall</HI> be. It is a word of authority, expressing the sovareign will and pow∣er of him that spake: of him whose word is the law of heaven and earth, and stands fast for ever and ever.</P>
<P><HI>One jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass, till heaven and earth pass;</HI> or as it is expressed imme∣diately after, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>till all</HI> (or ra∣ther <HI>all things</HI>) <HI>be fulfilled,</HI> till the consummati∣on of all things. Here is therefore no room for that poor evasion (with which some have de∣lighted
<PB N="138" REF="028060_0405_0FD68DAC33A53100"/>themselves greatly) that "no part of the law was to pass away, till <HI>all the law</HI> was fulfil∣led: but it has been fulfilled by <HI>Christ;</HI> and there∣fore now must pass, for the gospel to be esta∣blished." Not so; the word <HI>all</HI> does not mean all the law, but all things in the universe; as neither has the term <HI>fulfilled,</HI> any reference to the law, but to all things in heaven and earth.</P>
<P N="2">2. From all this we may learn, that there is no contrariety at all, between the law and the gospel; that there is no need for the law to pass away, in order to the establishing the gospel. Indeed neither of them supercedes the other, but they agree perfectly well together. Yea, the very same words, considered in different re∣spects, are parts both of the law and of the gospel: if they are considered as commandments, they are parts of the law; if as promises, of the gospel. Thus, <HI>thou shalt love the</HI> Lord <HI>thy</HI> God <HI>with all thy heart,</HI> when considered as a com∣mandment, is a branch of the law; when re∣garded as a promise, is an essential part of the gospel: the gospel being no other than the com∣mands of the law, proposed by way of pro∣mises. Accordingly poverty of spirit, purity of heart, and whatever else is enjoined in the holy law of God, are no other, when viewed in a gospel light, than so many great and precious promises.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is therefore the closest connexion that can be conceived, between the law and the gospel. On the one hand, the law continually makes way for, and points us to the gospel: on the other, the gospel continually leads us to a
<PB N="139" REF="028060_0406_0FD68DAE1530F128"/>more exact fulfilling of the law. The law, for instance, requires us to love God, to love our neighbour, to be meek, humble or holy: we feel that we are not sufficient for these things; yea, that <HI>with man this is impossible.</HI> But we see a promise of God, to give us that love, and to make us humble, meek and holy. We lay hold of this gospel, of these glad tidings; it is done unto us according to our faith: and <HI>the righteous∣ness of the law is fulfilled in us,</HI> through faith which is in <HI>Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>We may yet farther observe, that every com∣mand in holy writ, is only a covered promise. For by that solemn declaration, <HI>this is the cove∣nant I will make after those days, saith the</HI> Lord, <HI>I will put my laws in your minds, and write them in your hearts,</HI> God hath engaged to give whatsoe∣ver he commands. Does he command us then to <HI>pray without ceasing?</HI> to <HI>rejoice evermore?</HI> to be <HI>holy as he is holy?</HI> it is enough. He will work in us this very thing. It shall be unto us ac∣cording to his word.</P>
<P N="4">4. But if these things are so, we cannot be at a loss, what to think of those who in all ages of the church, have undertaken to change or super∣cede some commands of God, as they professed, by the peculiar direction of his Spirit. <HI>Christ</HI> has here given us an infallible rule, whereby to judge of all such pretensions. Christianity, as it includes the whole moral law of God, both by way of injunction and of promise, if we will hear him, is designed of God, to be the last of all his dispensations. There is no other to come after this. This is to endure till the consumma∣tion of all things. Of consequence all such
<PB N="140" REF="028060_0407_0FD68DAFF34F1608"/>new revelations, are of Satan and not of God; and all pretences to another more perfect dis∣pensation, fall to the ground of course. <HI>Hea∣ven and earth shall pass away: But</HI> this <HI>word shall not pass away:</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. 1. <HI>Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: But whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Who, what are they, that make "The preach∣ing of the law," a character of reproach? do they not see on whom the reproach must fall? on whose head it must light at last? whosoever on this ground despiseth us, despiseth him that sent us. For did ever any man preach the law like him? even when he <HI>came, not to condemn but to save the world:</HI> when he came purposely to <HI>bring life and immortality to light through the gospel?</HI> can any "preach the law" more expressly, more rigorously, than <HI>Christ</HI> does in these words? and who is he that shall amend them? who is he that shall instruct the Son of God, how to preach? who will teach him a better way of de∣livering the message which he hath received of the Father?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Whosoever shall break one of these least com∣mandments,</HI> or one of the least of these com∣mandments—<HI>These commandments,</HI> we may ob∣serve, is a term used by our Lord as equivalent with <HI>the law:</HI> or the <HI>law and the prophets,</HI> which is the same thing, seeing the prophets added no∣thing to the law; but only declared, explained,
<PB N="141" REF="028060_0408_0FD68DB1F19567B8"/>or enforced it, as they w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e moved by the Holy Ghost.</P>
<P><HI>Whosoever shall break one of these least command∣ments</HI>—especially if it be done wilfully or pre∣sumptuously: <HI>one:</HI>—for <HI>he th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> keepeth the whole law and</HI> thus <HI>offends in one point, is guilty of all<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> the wrath of God abide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> on him, as surely as if he had broken every one. So that no allow∣ance is made for one darling lust; no reserve for one idol; no excuse for refraining from all be∣sides, and only giving way to one bosom sin. What God demands is, an entire obedience; we are to have an eye to all his commandments: otherwise we lose all the labour we take in keeping some, and our poor souls for ever and ever.</P>
<P><HI>One of these least,</HI> or one of the least of these <HI>commandments.</HI>—Here is another excuse cut off, whereby many, who cannot deceive God, mise∣rably deceive their own souls. "This sin, saith the sinner, is it not a little one? will not the Lord spare me in this thing? surely he will not be extreme to mark this, since I do not offend in the greater matters of the law." Vain hope! speaking after the manner of men, we may term these great and those little commandments. But in reality, they are not so. If we use propriety of speech, there is no such thing as a little sin: every sin being a transgression of the holy and perfect law, and an affront of the great majesty of heaven.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>And shall teach men so</HI>—In some sense it may be said, that whosoever openly breaks any commandment, teaches others to do the same: for example speaks, and many times louder than
<PB N="142" REF="028060_0409_0FD68DB355093160"/>precept. In this sense it is apparent every open drunkard, is a teacher of drunkenness: every sabbath-breaker is constantly teaching his neigh∣bour, to profane the day of the Lord. But this is not all; an habitual breaker of the law, is seldom content to stop here. He generally teach∣es other men to do so too, by word as well as ex∣ample: especially when he hardens his neck, and hateth to be reproved. Such a sinner soon com∣mences an advocate for sin: he defends what he is resolved not to forsake. He excuses the sin which he will not leave, and thus directly teaches every sin which he commits.</P>
<P><HI>He shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven:</HI> that is, shall have no part therein. He is a stranger to the kingdom of heaven which is on earth; he hath no portion in that inheritance; no share of that righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. Nor by consequence can he have any part in the glory which shall be re∣vealed.</P>
<P N="4">4. But if those who even thus <HI>break and teach</HI> others to break, <HI>one of the least of these command∣ments, shall be called least in the kingdom of hea∣ven,</HI> shall have no part in the kingdom of Christ and of God; if even these shall be cast into <HI>outer darkness, where is wailing and gnashing of teeth:</HI> then where will they appear, whom our Lord chiefly and primarily intends in these words? they who bearing the character of teach∣ers sent from God, do nevertheless themselves hie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> his commandments, yea, and openly teach others so to do; being corrupt both in life and doctrine.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="143" REF="028060_0410_0FD68DB6CB450E38"/>
5. These are of several sorts. Of the first sort are they, who live in some wilful, habitual sin. Now if an ordinary sinner teaches by his exam∣ple, how much more a sinful minister? Even if he does not attempt to defend, excuse or extenu∣ate his sin. If he does, he is a murderer indeed, yea, the murderer-general of his congregation. He peoples the regions of death. He is the choic∣est instrument of the prince of darkness. When he goes hence, <HI>hell from beneath is moved to meet him at his coming.</HI> Nor can he sink into the bot∣tomless pit, without dragging a multitude after him.</P>
<P N="6">6. Next to these are the good-natured, good sort of men: who live an easy, harmless life, neither troubling themselves with outward sin, nor with inward holiness: men who are remark∣able neither one way nor the other; neither for religion nor irreligion: who are very regular both in public and private; but do not pretend to be any stricter than their neighbours. A minister of this kind breaks, not one, or a few only of the least commandments of God; but all the great and weighty branches of his law, which relate to the power of godliness: And all that require us to <HI>pass the time of our sojourning in fear,</HI> to <HI>work out our salvation with fear and trembling;</HI> to have our <HI>loins always girt and our lights burning;</HI> to strive or <HI>agonize to enter in at the strait gate.</HI> And he <HI>teaches men so,</HI> by the whole form of his life, and the general tenor of his preaching; which uniformly tends to sooth those in their pleasing dream, who imagine themselves christians and are not; to persuade all who attend upon his ministry, to sleep on and take their rest. No
<PB N="144" REF="028060_0411_0FD68DB7D1B4E9C8"/>marvel therefore if both he and they that follow him, wake together in everlasting burnings.</P>
<P N="7">7. But above all these, in the highest rank of the enemies of the gospel of <HI>Christ,</HI> are they who openly and explicitly <HI>judge the law</HI> itself, and <HI>speak evil of the law:</HI> Who teach men to break (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> to dissolve, to loose, to untie the obligation of) not one only, whether of the least, or of the greatest, but all the commandments at a stroke: who teach, without any cover, in so many words, "What did our Lord do with the law? He abo∣lished it." "There is but one duty, which is that of believing." "All commands are unfit for our times." "From any demand of the law no man is obliged now to go one step, to give away one farthing, to eat or omit one morsel." This is indeed carrying matters with a high hand. This is withstanding our Lord to the face, and telling him, That he understood not how to deli∣ver the message on which he was sent. O Lord, lay not this sin to their charge! Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do!</P>
<P N="8">8. The most surprising of all the circumstances, that attend this strong delusion, is that they who are given up to it really believe, that they honour <HI>Christ,</HI> by overthrowing his law, and that they are magnifying his office, while they are destroy∣ing his doctrine! Yea, they honour him just as <HI>Judas</HI> did, when he <HI>said, Hail, Master, and kis∣sed him.</HI> And he may as justly say, to every one of them, <HI>Betrayest thou the son of Man with a kiss?</HI> It is no other than betraying him with a kiss, to talk of his blood and take away his crown: to
<PB N="145" REF="028060_0412_0FD68DBB5BCB6310"/>set light by any part of his law, under pre∣tence of advancing his gospel. Nor indeed can any one escape this charge, who preaches faith in any such manner as, either directly or in∣directly, tends to set aside any branch of obe∣dience: who preaches Christ so as to disannull or weaken, in any wise, the least of the com∣mandments of God.</P>
<P N="9">9. It is impossible indeed to have too high an esteem for <HI>the faith of</HI> God's <HI>elect.</HI> And we must all declare, <HI>by grace ye are saved through faith:—Not of works lest any man should boast.</HI> We must cry aloud to every penitent sinner, <HI>be∣lieve in the</HI> Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>and thou shalt be saved.</HI> But at the same time we must take care to let all men know, we esteem no faith but that <HI>which worketh by love:</HI> and that we are not <HI>sav∣ed by faith,</HI> unless so far as we are delivered from the power as well as the guilt of sin. And when we say, <HI>believe and thou shalt be saved;</HI> we do not mean, "believe and thou shalt step from sin to heaven; without any holiness coming between; faith supplying the place of holiness:" But, believe and thou shalt be holy; believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt have peace and power together. Thou shalt have power from him in whom thou believest, to trample sin un∣der thy feet; power to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and to serve him with all thy strength. Thou shalt have power, <HI>by patient con∣tinuance in well-doing,</HI> to <HI>seek for glory, and ho∣nour, and immortality.</HI> Thou shalt both <HI>do and teach</HI> all the commandments of God, from the least even to the greatest. Thou shalt teach
<PB N="146" REF="028060_0413_0FD68DBC58432A98"/>them by thy life as well as thy words, and so <HI>be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. 1. Whatever other way we teach to the kingdom of heaven, to glory, honour, and im∣mortality, be it called the way of faith, or by any other name, it is in truth, the way to de∣struction. It will not bring a man peace at the last. For thus saith the Lord, <HI>verily I say unto you, except your righteousness shall exceed the right|
eousness of the scribes and pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The scribes,</HI> mentioned so often in the new testament, as some of the most constant and ve∣hement opposers of our Lord, were not secreta∣ries, or men employed in writing only, as that term might incline us to believe. Neither were they <HI>lawyers,</HI> in our common sense of the word (although the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is so rendered in our translation.) Their employment had no aflinity at all, to that of a lawyer among <HI>us.</HI> They were conversant with the laws of God, and not with the laws of man. These were their study: it was their proper and peculiar business, to read and expourd the law and the prophets; particu∣larly in the synagogues. They were the ordina∣ry, stated preachers among the Jews. So that if the sense of the original word was attended to, we might render it, the divines. For these were the men who made divinity their profession; and they were generally (as their name literally im∣ports) men of letters; men of the greatest ac∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t for learning th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> were then in the Jewish nation.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="147" REF="028060_0414_0FD68DBDD17CBEE0"/>
2. The pharisees <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere a very ancient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> body of men, among the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> called from the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣nifies, to separate or divide. Not that they made any formal separation from, or division in the national church. They were only distinguished from others, by greater strictness of life, by more exactness of conversation. For they were zea∣lous of the law in the minutest points; paying tithes of mint, anise and cummin. And hence they were had in honour of all the people, and generally esteemed the holiest of men.</P>
<P>Many of the scribes were of the sect of the pharisees. Thus St. Paul himself, who was edu∣cated for a scribe, first at the university of Tarsus, and after that in Jerusalem, at the feet of Gama∣liel (one of the most learned scribes or doctors of the law that were then in the nation) declares of himself before the council,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiii. 6.</NOTE> <HI>I am a pharisee, the son of a pharisee:</HI> and before king Agrippa,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Chap. xxvi. 5.</NOTE> <HI>after the straitest sect of our religion I lived a pharisee.</HI> And the whole body of the scribes ge∣nerally esteemed and acted in concert with the pharisees. Hence we find our Saviour so fre∣quently coupling them together, as coming in many respects under the same consideration. In this place they seem to be mentioned together, as the most eminent professors of religion: the form∣er of whom were accounted the wisest, the latter the holiest of men.</P>
<P N="3">3. What <HI>the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees</HI> really was, it is not difficult to deter∣mine. Our Lord has preserved an authentic ac∣count, which one of them gave of himself.
<PB N="148" REF="028060_0415_0FD68DC2D79454C8"/>And he is clear and full in describing his own righteousness; and cannot be supposed to have omitted any part of it. He <HI>went up</HI> indeed <HI>into the temple to pray;</HI> but was so intent upon his own virtues, that he forgot the design upon which he came. For it is remarkable, he does not properly pray at all. He only tells God, how wise and good he was. God, <HI>I thank thee, that I am not as other men are; extortioners, unjust, adulterers; or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I possess.</HI> His righteousness therefore consisted of three parts, First, saith he, <HI>I am not as other men are.</HI> I am not an <HI>extortioner,</HI> not <HI>unjust,</HI> not an <HI>adulterer;</HI> not even <HI>as this publican.</HI> Secondly, <HI>I fast twice in the week;</HI> and Thirdly, <HI>give tithes of all that I possess.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I am not as other men are.</HI> This is not a small point. It is not every man that can say this. It is as if he had said, I do not suffer myself to be carried away by that great torrent, custom. I live not by custom, but by reason; not by the examples of men, but by the word of God. <HI>I am not an extortioner, not unjust, not an adulterer:</HI> however common these sins are, even among those who are called the people of God: (extorti∣on, in particular, a kind of legal injustice; not punishable by any human law, the making gain of another's ignorance or necessity, having filled every corner of the land) <HI>nor even as this publican;</HI> not guilty of any open or presumptuous sin; not an outward sinner; but a fair, honest man, of blameless life and conversation.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>I fast twice in the week.</HI> There is more implied in this, than we may at first be sensible of. All the stricter pharisees observed the weekly
<PB N="149" REF="028060_0416_0FD68DC565F09DB0"/>fasts; namely, every <HI>Monday</HI> and <HI>Thursday.</HI> On the former day, they fasted in memory of Moses receiving on that day (as their tradition taught) the two tables of stone written by the finger of God: on the latter, in memory of his casting them out of his hand, when he saw the people dancing round the golden calf. On these days, they took no sustenance at all till three in the afternoon; the hour at which they began to of∣fer up the evening sacrifice in the temple. Till that hour it was their custom to remain in the temple, in some of the corners, apartments or courts thereof; that they might be ready to assist at all the sacrifices, and to join in all the pub∣lic prayers. The time between, they were ac∣customed to employ, partly in private addresses to God, partly in searching the scriptures, in read∣ing the law and the prophets, and in meditating thereon. Thus much is implied in, <HI>I fast twice in the week,</HI> the second branch of the righteousness of a pharisee.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>I give tithes of all that I possess.</HI> This the pharisees did with the utmost exactness. They would not except the most inconsiderable thing, no, not mint, anise and cummin. They would not keep back the least part of what they believed properly to belong to God; but gave a full tenth of their whole substance yearly, and of all their increase, whatsoever it was.</P>
<P>Yea, the stricter pharisees (as has been often observed, by those who are versed in the ancient Jewish writings) not content with giving one tenth of their substance to God, in his priests and levites, gave another tenth to God in the poor, and that continually. They gave the same
<PB N="150" REF="028060_0417_0FD68DC8812044E0"/>proportion of all they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> alms, as they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to give in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>hes. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his likewise they adjusted with the u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>most exactness, that they might not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eep back any part, but might fully render unto God the things which were God's, as they accounted this to be. So that, upon the whole, they gave away, from year to year, an entire fifth of all that they possessed.</P>
<P N="6">6. This was <HI>the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees:</HI> a righteousness, which in many re∣spects, went far beyond the conception which many have been accustomed to entertain concern∣ing it. But perhaps, it will be said, it was all false a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> feigned; for they were all a company of hypocrites.—Some of them doubtless were; men who had really no religion at all; no fear of God, or desire to please him: who had no concern for the honour that cometh of God, but only for the praise of men. And these are they whom our Lord so severely condemns, so sharply reproves on many occasions. But we must not suppose, because many pharisees were hypocrites, therefore all were so. Nor indeed is hypocrisy by any means essential to the cha∣racter of a pharisee. This is not the distinguish∣ing mark of their sect. It is rather this (accord∣ing to our Lord's account) <HI>they trusted in them∣selves that they were righteous, and despised others.</HI> This is their genuine badge. But the pharisee of this kind cannot be a hypocrite. He must be, in the common sense, sincere: otherwise he could not <HI>trust in himself that he is righteous.</HI> The man who was here commending himself to God, unquestionably thought himself righte∣ous. Consequently, he was no hypocrite: he
<PB N="151" REF="028060_0418_0FD68DCA3371A1C8"/>was not conscious to himself of any insincerity. He now spoke to God just what he thought, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ly, that he was abundantly better than other men.</P>
<P>But the example of St. Paul, were there no other, is sufficient, to put this out of all questi∣on. He could not only say, when he was a chris∣tian,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiv. 16.</NOTE> <HI>herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence, toward</HI> God <HI>and toward men:</HI> but even concerning the time when he was a pharisee;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Chap. xxiii. 1.</NOTE> <HI>men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before</HI> God <HI>until this day.</HI> He was therefore sincere when he was a pharisee, as well as when he was a christian. He was no more an hypocrite when he persecuted the church, than when he preached the faith which once he persecuted. Let this then be added to <HI>the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees,</HI> a sin∣cere belief that they are righteous, and in all things <HI>doing</HI> God <HI>service.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. And yet, <HI>except your righteousness,</HI> saith our Lord, <HI>shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the king∣dom of heaven.</HI> A solemn and weighty declara∣tion! and which it behoves all who are called by the name of <HI>Christ,</HI> seriously and deeply to con∣sider. But before we inquire, how our righte∣ousness may exceed theirs, let us examine, whe∣ther at present we come up to it?</P>
<P>First, a pharisee was <HI>not as other men are.</HI> In externals he was singularly good. Are we so? do we dare to be singular at all? do we not ra∣ther swim with the stream? do we not many times dispense with religion and reason together,
<PB N="152" REF="028060_0419_0FD68DCB56C7D538"/>because we would not <HI>look particular?</HI> are we not often more afraid of being out of the fashion, than being out of the way of salvation? have we cou∣rage to stem the tide? to run counter to the world: <HI>to obey</HI> God <HI>rather than man?</HI> otherwise the phari∣see leaves us behind at the very first step. It is well if we overtake him any more.</P>
<P>But, to come closer. Can we use his first plea with God, which is in substance, "I do no harm. I live in no outward sin; I do nothing, for which my own heart condemns me." Do you not? are you sure of that? do you live in no practise, for which your own heart condemns you? if you are not an adulterer, if you are not unchaste, either in word or deed, are you not unjust? the grand measure of justice, as well as of mercy, is, do unto others as thou wouldst they should do unto thee. Do you walk by this rule? do you never do unto any what you would not they should do unto you? nay, are you not grossly unjust? are you not an extortioner? do you not make a gain of any one's ignorance or necessity? neither in buying nor selling? suppose you are engaged in trade, do you demand, do you receive no more than the real value of what you sell? do you demand, do you receive no more of the ignorant than of the knowing; of a little child, than of an experien∣ced trader? if you do, why does not your heart condemn you? you are a barefaced extortioner. Do you demand no more than the usual price of the goods, of any who is in pressing want? who must have, and that without delay the things which you only can furnish him with? if you do, this also is flat extortion. Indeed you do not come up to the righteousness of a ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sec.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="153" REF="028060_0420_0FD68DCE1C560F10"/>
8. A pharisee, Secondly (to express his sense in our common way) used all the means of grace. As he fasted <HI>often and much, twice in</HI> every <HI>we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> so he attended all the sacrifices. He was constant in public and private prayer, and in reading and hearing the scriptures. Do you go as far as this? Do you fast <HI>much and often?</HI> Twice in the week? I fear not. Once, at least; "on all <HI>Fridays</HI> in the year?" (So our church clearly and peremptorily enjoins all her members to do: to observe all these, as well as the vigils and the forty days of lent, as "days of fast∣ing or abstinence.") Do you fast twice in the year? I am afraid, some among us cannot plead even this!—Do you neglect no opportunity of attending and partaking of the christian sacri∣fice? How many are they, who call themselves christians, and yet are utterly regardless of it? Yea, do not eat of that bread, or drink of that cup, for months, perhaps years together? Do you every day, either hear the scriptures, or read them and meditate thereon? Do you join in prayer with the great congregation, daily, if you have opportunity? If not whenever you can, particularly on that day, which you <HI>remember, to keep it holy?</HI> Do you strive to <HI>make</HI> opportu∣nities? Are you <HI>glad when they say unto you, we will go into the house of the</HI> Lord? Are you zealous of, and diligent in private prayer? Do you suffer no day to pass without it? Rather, are not some of you so far from spending therein (with the pharisee) several hours in one day, that you think one hour full enough, if not too
<PB N="154" REF="028060_0421_0FD68DD188DA3470"/>much? Do you spend an hour in a day, or in a week, in praying to your Father which is in se∣cret? Yea, an hour in a month? Have you spent one hour together in private prayer ever since you was born? Ah poor christian! Shall not the pharisee rise up in the judgment against thee and condemn thee? His righteousness is as far above thine, as the heaven is above the earth.</P>
<P N="9">9. The pharisee, Thirdly, <HI>paid tithes</HI> and gave alms <HI>of all that he possessed.</HI> And in how ample a manner? So that he was (as we phrase it) <Q>a man that did much good.</Q> Do we come up to him here? Which of us is so abundant as he was, in good works? Which of us gives a fifth of all his substance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>? Both of the principal, and of the increase? Who of us, out of (suppose) an hundred pounds a year, gives twenty to God and the poor: Out of fifty, ten; and so in a lar∣ger or a smaller proportion? When shall our righteousness, in using all the means of grace, in attending all the ordinances of God, in avoid∣ing evil and doing good, equal at least the righte∣ousness of the scribes and pharisees?</P>
<P N="10">10. Altho' if it only equalled theirs, what would that profit? <HI>For verily I say un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> you, except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</HI> But how can it ex∣ceed theirs? Wherein does the righteousness of a christian exceed that of a scribe or a pharisee?</P>
<P>Christian righteousness exceeds theirs, First, in the extent of it. Most of the pharisees, <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> they were rigorously exact in many things, yet were emboldened by the traditions of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ders
<PB N="155" REF="028060_0422_0FD68DD46052EED0"/>to dispense with others of equal importance. Thus they were extremely punctual in keeping the fourth commandment; they would not even <HI>rub an ear of corn</HI> on the sabbath day: but not at all in keeping the third, making little account of light, or even false swearing. So that their righteousness was partial: whereas the righteous∣ness of a real christian is universal. He does not observe one, or some parts of the law of God, and neglect the rest; but keeps all his com∣mandments, loves them all, values them above gold or precious stones.</P>
<P N="11">11. It may be indeed, that some of the scribes and pharisees, endeavoured to keep all the com∣mandments, and consequently were, as touching the righteousness of the law, that is, according to the letter of it, blameless. But still the righte∣ousness of a christian exceeds all this righteous∣ness of a scribe or pharisee, by fulfilling the spi∣rit as well as the letter of the law, by inward as well as outward obedience. In this, in the spi∣rituality of it, it admits of no comparison. This is the point which our Lord has so largely pro∣ved, in the whole tenor of this discourse. Their righteousness was external only; christian right∣eousness is in the inner man. The pharisee <HI>clean∣sed the outside of the cup and the platter;</HI> the christian is clean within. The pharisee labour∣ed to present God with a good life; the chris∣tian with a holy heart. The one shook off the leaves, perhaps the fruits of sin; the other <HI>lays the ax to the root:</HI> as not being content with the outward form of godliness, how exact soe∣ver it be, unless the life, the spirit, the power of God unto salvation, be felt in the inmost soul.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="028060_0423_0FD68DD6719CFD20"/>
Thus, to do no harm, to do good, to attend the ordinances of God (the righteousness of a pharisee) are all external: whereas, on the con∣trary, poverty of spirit, mourning, meekness, hunger and thirst after righteousness, the love of our neighbour, and purity of heart (the righte∣ousness of a christian) are all internal. And e∣ven peace-making (or doing good) and suffering for righteousness sake, stand intitled to the bless∣ings annexed to them, only as they imply these inward dispositions, as they spring from, exercise and confirm them. So that whereas the righte∣ousness of the scribes and pharisees was external only, it may be said, in some sense, that the right∣eousness of a christian is internal only: all his actions and sufferings being as nothing in them∣selves, being estimated before God only by the tempers from which they spring.</P>
<P N="12">12. Whosoever therefore thou art, who bear∣est the holy and venerable name of a christian, see, first, that thy righteousness fall not short of the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees. Be <HI>not</HI> thou <HI>as other men are.</HI> Dare to stand alone, to be</P>
<P>"Against example, singularly good!" If thou <HI>follow a multitude</HI> at all, it must be, <HI>to do evil.</HI> Let not custom or fashion be thy guide, but reason and religion. The practice of others is nothing to thee: <HI>Every man</HI> must <HI>give an ac∣count of himself to</HI> God. Indeed if thou canst save the soul of another, do: but at least, save one, thy own. Walk not in the path of death, because it is broad, and many walk therein. Nay, by this very token thou mayest know it. Is the way wherein thou now walkest, a broad,
<PB N="157" REF="028060_0424_0FD68DD754207740"/>well-frequented, fashionable way? then it in∣fallibly leads to destruction. O be not thou "damned for company:" cease from evil; fly from sin as from the face of a serpent. At least, do no harm. <HI>He that committeth sin is of the devil.</HI> Be not thou found in that number. Touch∣ing outward sins, surely the grace of God is even now sufficient for thee. <HI>Herein</HI> at least, <HI>exercise</HI> thyself <HI>to have a conscience void of offence toward</HI> God <HI>and toward man.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Let not thy righteousness fall short of theirs, with regard to the ordinances of God. If thy labour or bodily strength will not allow of thy fasting <HI>twice in the week,</HI> however, deal faithfully with thy own soul, and fast as often as thy strength will permit. Omit no public, no private opportunity, of pouring out thy soul in prayer. Neglect no occasion of eating that bread and drinking that cup, which is the communion of the body and blood of <HI>Christ.</HI> Be diligent in searching the scriptures; read as thou mayest, and meditate therein day and night. Rejoice to embrace every opportunity, of hearing <HI>the word of reconciliation</HI> declared by <HI>the ambassadors of</HI> Christ, <HI>the stewards of the mysteries of</HI> God. In using all the means of grace, in a constant and careful attendance on every ordinance of God, live up to (at least, till thou canst go beyond) <HI>the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, Fall not short of a pharisee in doing good. Give alms of all thou dost possess. Is any hungry? feed him. Is he athirst? give him drink. Naked? cover him with a garment. If thou hast this world's goods, do not limit thy be∣neficence
<PB N="158" REF="028060_0425_0FD68DD92C56D868"/>to a scanty proportion. Be merciful to the uttermost of thy power. Why not, even as this pharisee? now <HI>make thyself friends,</HI> while the time is, <HI>of the mammon of unrighteousness, that when</HI> thou <HI>failest,</HI> when this earthly tabernacle is dissolved, they <HI>may receive thee into everlasting habitations.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. But rest not here. Let thy <HI>righteous∣ness exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pha∣risees.</HI> Be not thou content, to <HI>keep the whole law, and offend in one point. Hold thou fast all his commandments, and all false ways</HI> do thou <HI>ut∣terly abhor.</HI> Do all the things, whatsoever he hath commanded, and that with all thy might. Thou canst do all things through Christ strength∣ening thee, though without him thou canst do nothing.</P>
<P>Above all, let thy righteousness exceed theirs in the purity and spirituality of it. What is the most exact form of religion to thee? the most perfect outside righteousness? go thou higher and deeper than all this. Let thy religion be the re∣ligion of the heart. Be thou poor in spirit; lit∣tle and base and mean and vile in thy own eyes; amazed and humbled to the dust at the love of God which is in Christ Jesus thy Lord. Be seri∣ous: let the whole stream of thy thoughts, words and works, be such as flows from the deepest conviction, that thou standest on the edge of the great gulph, thou and all the children of men, just ready to drop in, either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to ever∣lasting glory, or everlasting burnings. Be meek: let thy soul be filled with mildness, gentleness, patience, long-suffering toward all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. at the same time that all which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thee is ath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r
<PB N="159" REF="028060_0426_0FD68DDA522B88F8"/>God, the living God; longing to awake up after his likeness, and to be satisfied with it. Be thou a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of God and of all mankind.

<P>But when thou dost Alms, let not thy left Hand know what thy right Hand doth: That thine Alms may be in secret, and thy Fa∣ther which seeth in secret, himself shall reward thee openly.</P>
<P>And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites are; for they love to pray, standing in the Synagogues and in the cor∣ners of the Streets, that they may be seen of Men. Verily I say unto you, they have their Reward.</P>
<P>But thou when thou prayest, enter into thy Closet, and when thou hast shut th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Door,
<PB N="164" REF="028060_0429_0FD68DE3572EBCF8"/>pray to thy Father which is in secret; And thy Father which seeth in secret, he shall reward thee openly.</P>
<P>But when ye pray, use not vain Repetitions as the Heathen do; for they think that they shall be heard for their much Speaking.</P>
<P>Be not ye therefore like unto them; for your Father knoweth what Things ye have Need of, before you ask him.</P>
<P>After this Manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this Day our daily Bread. And for∣give us our Trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into Temptation, but deliver us from Evil. For thine is the Kingdom and the Power and the Glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</P>
<P>For if ye forgive Men their Trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.</P>
<P>But if ye forgive not Men their Trespasses, nei∣ther will your Father forgive your Trespasses.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. IN the preceding chapter our Lord has de∣scribed inward religion, in its various branch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. He has laid before us those disposi∣tions
<PB N="165" REF="028060_0430_0FD68DE4D80BE628"/>of soul, which constitute real christianity: the inward tempers contained in that holiness, <HI>without</HI> which <HI>no man shall see the</HI> Lord; the af∣fections which, when flowing from their proper fountain, from a living faith in God through Christ Jesus, are intrinsically and essentially good, and acceptable to God. He proceeds to shew in this chapter, how all our actions likewise, even those that are indifferent in their own nature, may be made holy and good and acceptable to God, by a pure and holy intention. Whatever is done without this, he largely declares, is of no value before God. Whereas whatever outward works are thus consecrated to God, they are in his sight of great price.</P>
<P N="2">2. The necessity of this purity of intention, he shews first, with regard to those, which are usu∣ally accounted religious actions, and indeed are such, when performed with a right intention. Some of these are commonly termed works of piety; the rest, works of charity or mercy. Of the latter sort, he particularly names almigiving; of the former, prayer and fasting. But the di∣rections given for these are equally to be applied to every work, whether of charity or mercy.</P>
<P N="1">I. 1. And first, with regard to works of mercy. <HI>Take heed,</HI> saith he, <HI>that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them. Otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in hea∣ven. That ye do not your alms.</HI> Although this only is named, yet is every work of charity in∣cluded, every thing which we give, or speak, or
<PB N="166" REF="028060_0431_0FD68DE6501AB228"/>do, whereby our neighbour may be profited, whereby another man may receive any advantage, either in his body or soul. The feeding the hun∣gry, the cloathing the naked, the entertaining or assisting the stranger, the visiting those that are sick or in prison, the comforting the afflicted; the instructing the ignorant, the reproving the wick∣ed, the exhorting and encouraging the well-doer; and if there be any other work of mercy, it is equally included in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> direction.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Take heed that ye do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our alms before men, to be seen of them.</HI> The thing which is here for∣bidden, is not, barely the doing good in the sight of men: this circumstance alone, that others see what we do, makes the action neither worse nor better: but the doing it before men, <HI>to be seen of them;</HI> with this view, from this intention only. I say, from <HI>this intention only;</HI> for this may, in some cases, be a part of our intention; we may design that some of our actions should be seen, and yet they may be acceptable to God. We may intend, that our <HI>light</HI> should <HI>shine before men,</HI> when our conscience bears us witness, in the Holy Ghost, that our ultimate end in designing they should <HI>see our good works,</HI> is, <HI>that they may glorify our Father which is in heaven.</HI> But take heed that ye do not the least thing with a view to your own glory. Take heed, that a regard to the praise of men, have no place at all in your works of mercy. If ye seek your own glory, if you have any design to gain the honour that cometh of men, whatever is done with this view is nothing worth; it is not done unto the Lord;
<PB N="167" REF="028060_0432_0FD68DEBF111A540"/>he accepteth it not; <HI>ye have no reward</HI> for this <HI>of your Father which is in heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Therefore when thou dost thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have praise of men.</HI> The word <HI>synagogue</HI> does not here mean, a place of worship, but any place of public resort, such as the market-place or exchange. It was a common thing among the <HI>Jews,</HI> who were men of large fortunes, particularly among the pharisees, to cause a trumpet to be sounded before them in the most public parts of the city, when they were about to give any considerable alms. The pretended reason for this was, To call the poor together to receive it: but the real design, that they might have praise of men. But be not thou like unto them. Do not thou cause a trumpet to be founded before thee. Use no ostentation in do∣ing good. Aim at the honour which cometh of God only. <HI>They</HI> who seek the praise of men, <HI>have their reward.</HI> They shall have no praise of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth.</HI> This is a proverbial expression, the meaning of which is, Do it in as secret a manner as is possible: as secret as is consistent with the doing it at all; (for it must not be left undone: omit no oppor∣tunity of doing good, whether secretly or openly) and with the doing it in the most effectual manner. For here is also an exception to be made. When you are fully persuaded in your own mind, that by your not concealing the good which is done,
<PB N="168" REF="028060_0433_0FD68DED131B2CA0"/>either you will yourself be enabled, or others ex∣cited to do the more good, then you may not conceal it: then let your light appear, and <HI>shine to all that are in the house.</HI> But unless where the glory of God and the good of mankind oblige you to the contrary, act in as private and unob∣served a manner, as the nature of the thing will admit: <HI>That thy alms may be in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret, he shall reward thee openly.</HI> Perhaps in the present world; many in∣stances of this stand recorded in all ages: but in∣fallibly in the world to come, before the general assembly of men and angels.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. From works of charity or mercy, our Lord proceeds to those which are termed works of piety. <HI>And when thou prayest,</HI> saith he, <HI>thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are.</HI> Hypocrisy then, or insincerity, is the first thing we are to guard against in prayer. Beware not to speak what thou dost not mean. Prayer is, the lifting up of the heart to God: all words of prayer without this are mere hypocrisy. Whenever therefore thou at∣temptest to pray, see that it be thy one design, to commune with God, to lift up thy heart to him, to pour out thy soul before him. Not <HI>as the hypocrites,</HI> who <HI>love,</HI> or are wont, <HI>to pray standing in the synagogues,</HI> the exchange or mar∣ket-places, <HI>and in the corners of the streets,</HI> where∣ver the most people are, <HI>that they may be seen of men:</HI> this was the sole design, the motive and end, of the prayers which they there repeated.
<PB N="169" REF="028060_0434_0FD68DEE997BA2C8"/><HI>Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.</HI> They are to expect none from your Father which is in heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. But it is not only, the having an eye to the praise of men, which cuts us off from any re∣ward in heaven; which leaves us no room to expect the blessing of God, upon our works whether of piety or mercy. Purity of intention is equally destroyed by a view to any temporal reward whatever. If we repeat our prayers, if we attend the public worship of God, if we relieve the poor, with a view to gain or inte∣rest, it is not a whit more acceptable to God, than if it were done with a view to praise. Any temporal view, any motive whatever on this side eternity, any design but that of promoting the glory of God, and the happiness of men, for God's sake, makes every action, however fair it may appear to men, an abomination unto the Lord.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>But when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut the door, pray to thy Fa∣ther which is in secret.</HI> There is a time, when thou art openly to glorify God, to pray and praise him in the great congregation. But when thou desirest more largely and more particularly to make thy requests known unto God, whether it be in the evening or in the morning or at noon∣day, <HI>enter into thy closet and shut the door.</HI> Use all the privacy thou canst. (Only leave it not undone, whether thou hast any closet, any pri∣vacy or no. Pray to God if it be possible, when none seeth but he: but if otherwise, pray to God.) Thus <HI>pray to thy Father which is in secret;</HI> pour out all thy heart before him. <HI>And thy Fa∣ther
<PB N="170" REF="028060_0435_0FD68DF01C8D5768"/>which seeth in secret, he shall reward thee openly.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>But when ye pray,</HI> even in secret, <HI>use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do.</HI> M <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Do not use abundance of words without any meaning. Say not the same thing over and over again; think not the fruit of your prayers de∣pends on the length of them: like the heathens; for <HI>they think they shall be heard for their much speaking.</HI></P>
<P>The thing here reproved, is not simply the length, no more than the shortness of our pray∣ers: but, first, length without meaning; the speaking much, and meaning little or nothing: the using (not all repetitions; for our Lord him∣self prayed thrice, repeating the same words; but) vain repetitions, as the heathens did, re∣citing the names of their gods over and over: as they do among christians (vulgarly so called) and not among the papists only, who say over and over the same string of prayers, without ever feeling what they speak: Secondly, the thinking to be heard for our much speaking, the fancying God measures prayers by their length, and is best pleased with those which contain the most words, which sound the longest in his ears. These are such instances of superstition and solly, as all who are named by the name of Christ, should leave to the heathens, to them on whom the glorious light of the gospel hath never shined.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Be not ye therefore like unto them.</HI> Ye who have tasted of the grace of God in Christ Jesus, are throughly convinced, <HI>your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him.</HI> So that the
<PB N="171" REF="028060_0436_0FD68DF538A7B920"/>end of your praving, is not to inform God, as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>' he knew not your wants already; but ra∣ther to inform yourselves, to fix the sense of those wants more deeply in your hearts, and the sense of your continual dependance on him, who only is able to supply all your wants. It is not so much to move God, who is always more ready to give than you to ask; as to move yourselves, that you may be willing and ready to receive the good things he has prepared for you.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. After having taught the true nature and ends of prayer, our Lord subjoins an ex∣ample of it: even that divine form of prayer, which seems in this place to be pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sed by way of pattern chiefly, as the model <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> standard of all our prayers; <HI>after this manner therefore pray ye.</HI> Whereas elsewhere he enjoins the use of these very words,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xi. 2</NOTE> <HI>He said unto them, when ye pray, say—</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. We may observe in general concerning this divine prayer. First, That it contains all we can reasonably or innocently pray for. There is nothing which we can ask without offending him, which is not included either directly or in∣directly in this comprehensive form: Secondly, That it contains all we can reasonably or inno∣cently desire; whatever is for the glory of God, whatever is needful or prositable not only for our∣selves, but for every creature in heaven and earth. And indeed our prayers are the proper test of our desires; nothing being sit to have a place in our desires, which is not sit to have a
<PB N="172" REF="028060_0437_0FD68DF616017FC8"/>place in our prayers; what we may not pray for, neither should we desire: Thirdly, That it con∣tains all our duty to God and man; whatsoever things are pure and holy, whatsoever God re∣quires of the children of men, whatsoever is ac∣ceptable in his sight, whatsoever it is whereby we may profit our neighbour, being expressed or implied therein.</P>
<P N="3">3. It consists of three parts, the preface, the petitions, and the doxology or conclusion. The preface, <HI>Our Father which art in heaven,</HI> lays a general foundation for prayer; comprising what we must first know of God, before we can pray, in confidence of being heard. It likewise points out to us all those tempers, with which we are to approach to God, which are most essentially requisite, if we desire either our prayers or our lives should find acceptance with him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>"Our Father."</HI> If he is a Father, then he is good, then he is loving to his children. And here is the first and great reason for prayer. God is willing to bless, let us ask for a blessing. <HI>"Our Father,"</HI>—Our Creator; the Author of our being; he who raised us from the dust of the earth, who breathed into us the breath of life, and we became living souls. But if he made us, let us ask and he will not with-hold any good thing from the work of his own hands. <HI>"Our Father"</HI>—Our preserver; who day by day sustains the life he has given: of whose con∣tinuing love, we now and every moment receive life and breath and all things. So much the more ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us come to him, and <HI>we</HI> shall <HI>find mercy and grace to help in time of need.</HI> Above all, the
<PB N="173" REF="028060_0438_0FD68DFB51AC0470"/>Father of our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and of all that believe in him: who justfies us <HI>freely by his grace, thro' the redemption that is in</HI> Jesus: who hath <HI>blotted out all our sins, and healed all our infirmities;</HI> who hath received us for <HI>his own children, by adoption and grace,</HI> and <HI>because we are sons,</HI> hath <HI>sent forth the spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying Abba, Father: who hath begotten us again of incorruptible seed,</HI> and <HI>created us a-new in</HI> Christ Jesus. Therefore we know that he heareth us always: therefore we <HI>pray</HI> to him <HI>without ceasing.</HI> We pray, because we love. And <HI>we love him, because he first loved us.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>"Our Father"</HI>—Not <HI>mine</HI> only who now cry unto him; but <HI>our's,</HI> in the most extensive sense. The God and <HI>Father of the spirits of all flesh;</HI> the Father of angels and men: (So the very heathens acknowledged him to be, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.) The Father of the uni∣verse, of all the families both in heaven and earth. Therefore with him there is no respect of persons. He loveth all that he hath made. He <HI>is loving unto every man, and his mercy is over all his works.</HI> And the Lord's <HI>delight is in them that fear him, and that put their trust in his mercy;</HI> in them that trust in him through the Son of his love, knowing they are <HI>accepted in the beloved.</HI> But if God <HI>so loved us, we ought also to love one another.</HI> Yea, all mankind: seeing God <HI>so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,</HI> even to die the death, that they <HI>might not perish but have ever∣lasting life.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Which art in heaven:</HI> high and lifted up; God over all, blessed for ever. Who sitting on
<PB N="174" REF="028060_0439_0FD68DFB56873E10"/>the circle of the heavens, beholdeth all things both in heaven and earth. Whose eye pervades the whole sphere of created being; yea, and of uncreated night: unto whom <HI>known are all his works,</HI> and all the works of every creature, not only <HI>from the beginning of the world</HI> (a poor, low, weak translation) but <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> from all eternity, from everlasting to everlasting: who constrains the host of heaven, as well as the children of men, to cry out with wonder and amazement, O the depth! <HI>The depth of the riches both of the wisdom and of the knowledge of</HI> God! <HI>which art in heaven</HI>—the Lord and Ruler of all, superin∣tending and disposing all things: who art the King of kings, and Lord of lords, the blessed and only Potentate: who art strong and girded about with power, doing whatsoever pleaseth thee! the Almighty: for whensoever thou wil∣lest, to do is present with thee. <HI>In heaven,</HI>—emi∣nently there. Heaven is thy throne, the place where thine Honour particularly dwelleth. But not there alone; for thou fillest heaven and earth, the whole expanse of space. Heaven and earth are full of thy glory. Glory be to thee, O Lord most high!</P>
<P>Therefore should we <HI>serve the</HI> Lord <HI>with fear, and rejoice unto him with reverence.</HI> Therefore should we think, speak and act, as continually under the eye, in the immediate presence of the Lord, the King.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Hallowed be thy Name.</HI> This is the first of the six petitions, whereof the prayer itself is composed. The name of God is God himself; the nature of God, so far as it can be discover∣ed to man: It means therefore, together with
<PB N="175" REF="028060_0440_0FD68DFD3779B0D0"/>his existence, all his attributes or perfections—his eternity, particularly signified by his great and incommunicable name JEHOVAH, as the apostle John translates it, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>The alpha and omega, the beginning and the end, he which is, and which was, and which is to come:</HI>—His <HI>fulness of being,</HI> denoted by his other great name, <HI>I am that I am</HI>—His omniptesence—His omnipotence; who is indeed the only agent in the material world; all matter being essentially dull and in∣active, and moving only as it is moved by the finger of God: and he is the spring of action in every creature, visible and invisible; which could neither act nor exist, without the continued in∣flux and agency of his almighty power—His wisdom, clearly deduced from the things that are seen, from the goodly order of the universe—His Trinity in Unity and Unity in Trinity, dis∣covered to us in the very first line of his written word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: literally <HI>the</HI> Gods <HI>created,</HI> a plural noun joined with a verb of the singular number: as well as in every part of his subse∣quent revelations, given by the mouth of all his holy prophets and apostles—His essential purity and holiness—and above all, his love, which is the very brightness of his glory.</P>
<P>In praying that God, or his <HI>name</HI> may <HI>be hal∣lowed</HI> or glorified, we pray that he may be known, such as he is, by all that are capable thereof, by all intelligent beings, and with affections suita∣ble to that knowledge: that he may be duly ho∣noured and feared and loved by all in heaven above and in the earth beneath; by all angels and
<PB N="176" REF="028060_0441_0FD68DFE56AB7780"/>men, whom for that end he has made capable of knowing and loving him to eternity.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Thy kingdom come.</HI> This has a close con∣nexion with the preceding petition. In order that the name of God may be hallowed, we pray that his kingdom, the kingdom of Christ may come. This kingdom then comes to a particular person, when he <HI>repents and believes the gospel:</HI> when he is taught of God, not only to know himself, but to know Jesus Christ and him cru∣cified. As <HI>this is life eternal, to know the only true</HI> God, <HI>and</HI> Jesus Christ <HI>whom he hath sent,</HI> so it is the kingdom of God begun below, set up in the believer's heart: the Lord God omnipotent then reigneth, when he is known through Christ Je∣sus. He taketh unto himself his mighty power; that he may subdue all things unto himself. He goeth on in the soul conquering and to conquer, till he hath put all things under his feet, till <HI>every thought</HI> is <HI>brought into captivity to the obedience of</HI> Christ.</P>
<P>When therefore God shall <HI>give his son the hea∣then for his inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for his possession;</HI> when <HI>all kingdoms shall bow before him, and all nations shall do him ser∣vice;</HI> when <HI>the mountain of the</HI> Lord's <HI>house,</HI> the church of <HI>Christ shall be established in the top of the mountains;</HI> when <HI>the fulness of the gentiles shall come in, and all Israel shall be saved:</HI> then shall it be seen, that <HI>the</HI> Lord <HI>is king and hath put on glorious apparel</HI> appearing to every soul of man, as King of kings, and Lord of lords. And it is meet for all those who <HI>love his appear∣ing,</HI> to pray that he would hasten the time: that
<PB N="177" REF="028060_0442_0FD68E006159DF50"/>this his kingdom, the kingdom of grace may come quickly, and swallow up all the kingdoms of the earth; that all mankind receiving him for their king, truly believing in his name, may be filled with righteousness and peace and joy, with holiness and happiness, till they are removed hence into his heavenly kingdom, there to reign with him for ever and ever.</P>
<P>For this also we pray in those words, <HI>Thy kingdom come:</HI> we pray for the coming of his everlasting kingdom, the kingdom of glory in heaven, which is the continuation and perfection of the kingdom of grace on earth. Conse∣quently this, as well as the preceding petition, is offered up for the whole intelligent creation, who are all interested in this grand event, the sinal renovation of all things, by God's putting an end to misery and sin, to infirmity and death, for the righteous; taking all things into his own hands, and setting up the kingdom which en∣dureth throughout all ages.</P>
<P>Exactly answerable to this, are those awful words, in the prayer, at the burial of the dead; "Beseeching thee, that it may please thee of thy gracious goodness, shortly to accomplish the num∣ber of thine elect, and to hasten thy kingdom: that we with all those that are departed, in the true faith of thy holy name, may have our per∣fect consummation and bliss, both in body and soul, in thy everlasting glory."</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</HI> This is the necessary and immediate consequence, wherever the kingdom of God is come: where
<PB N="178" REF="028060_0443_0FD68E016286FD40"/>ever God dwells in the soul by faith, and Christ reigns in the heart by love.</P>
<P>It is probable, many, perhaps the generality of men, at the first view of these words, are apt to imagine they are only an expression of, or petiti∣on for resignation; for a readiness to suffer the will of God, whatsoever it be concerning us. And this is unquestionably a divine and excellent temper, a most precious gift of God. But this is not what we pray for in this petition, at least not in the chief and primary sense of it. We pray, not so much for a passive, as for an active conformity to the will of God, in saying, <HI>Thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.</HI></P>
<P>How is it done by the angels of God in hea∣ven? those who now circle his throne rejoicing? they do it <HI>willingly;</HI> they love his command∣ments, and gladly hearken to his words. It is their meat and drink to do his will; it is their highest glory and joy. They do it <HI>continually;</HI> there is no interruption in their willing service. They rest not day nor night, but employ every hour (speaking after the manner of men; other∣wise our measures of duration, days and nights and hours, have no place in eternity) in fulfilling his commands, in executing his designs, in per∣forming the counsel of his will. And they do it <HI>perfectly.</HI> No sin, no defect belongs to angelic minds. It is true; <HI>the stars are not pure in his sight,</HI> even the morning-stars that sing together before him. <HI>In his sight,</HI> that is in comparison of him, the very angels are not pure. But this does not imply, that they are not pure <HI>in them∣selves.</HI> Doubtless they are; they are without
<PB N="179" REF="028060_0444_0FD68E052C03E9F0"/>spot and blameless. They are altogether de∣voted to his will, and perfectly obedient in all things.</P>
<P>If we view this in another light, we may ob∣serve, the angels of God in heaven, do <HI>all</HI> the will of God. And they do nothing else, nothing but what they are absolutely assured is his will Again, they do all the will of God, <HI>as</HI> he will∣eth, in the manner which pleases him, and no other. Yea, and they do this, only <HI>because</HI> it is his will; for this and no other reason.</P>
<P N="10">10. When therefore we pray, that the <HI>will of</HI> God may <HI>be done on earth as it is in heaven,</HI> the meaning is, that all the inhabitants of the earth, even the whole race of mankind, may do the will of their Father which is in heaven, as <HI>willingly</HI> as the holy angels: that these may do it <HI>continually</HI> even as they, without any interruption of their willing service: yea, and that they may do it <HI>per∣fectly;</HI> that <HI>the</HI> God <HI>of peace, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, may make them perfect in every good work to do his will, and work in them all which is well-pleasing in his sight.</HI></P>
<P>In other words, we pray, that we and all man∣kind, may do the whole will of God in all things: and nothing else, not the least thing but what is the holy and acceptable will of God. We pray that we may do the whole will of God <HI>as</HI> he willeth, in the manner that pleases him: and lastly, that we may do it, <HI>because</HI> it is his will: that this may be the sole reason and ground, the whole and only motive of whatsoever we think, or whatsoever we speak or do.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="180" REF="028060_0445_0FD68E06963C8910"/>
11. <HI>Give us this day our daily bread.</HI> In the three former petitions, we have been praying for all mankind. We come now more particularly to desire a supply for our own wants. Not that we are directed even here, to confine our prayer altoge∣ther to ourselves: but this and each of the fol∣lowing petitions, may be used for the whole church of Christ upon earth.</P>
<P>By <HI>bread</HI> we may understand, all things need∣ful whether for our souls or bodies; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>the things pertaining to life and god∣liness.</HI> We understand not barely the outward bread, what our Lord terms <HI>the meat which perish∣eth;</HI> but much more the spiritual bread, the grace of God, the food <HI>which endureth unto everlasting life.</HI> It was the judgment of many of the anci∣ent fathers, that we are here to understand, the sacramental bread also: daily received in the be∣ginning by the whole church of Christ, and high∣ly esteemed, till the love of many waxed cold, as the grand channel whereby the grace of his spi∣rit was conveyed to the souls of all the children of God.</P>
<P><HI>Our daily bread.</HI> The word we render <HI>daily</HI> has been differently explained by different com∣mentators. But the most plain and natural sense of it seems to be this, which is retained in al∣most all translations, as well ancient as modern: what is sufficient for this day; and so for each day, as it succeeds.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Give us.</HI> For we claim nothing of right, but only of free mercy. We deserve not the air we breathe, the earth that bears, or the sun
<PB N="181" REF="028060_0446_0FD68E08117C70C0"/>that shines upon us. All our desert, we own, is hell But God loves us freely. Therefore we ask him to <HI>give,</HI> what we can no more <HI>pro∣cure</HI> for ourselves, than we can <HI>merit</HI> it at his hands.</P>
<P>Not that either the goodness or the power of God is a reason for us to stand idle. It is his will, that we should use all diligence in all things, that we should employ our utmost endeavours, as much as if our success were the natural effect of our own wisdom and strength. And then, as though we had done nothing, we are to depend on him, the giver of every good and perfect gift.</P>
<P><HI>This day.</HI> For we are to take no thought for the morrow. For this very end has our wise Creator divided life into these little por∣tions of time, so clearly separated from each other: that we might look on every day, as a fresh gift of God, another life, which we may devote to his glory; and that every evening may be as the close of life, beyond which we are to see nothing but eternity.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us.</HI> As nothing but sin can hinder the bounty of God from flowing forth upon every creature, so this petition na∣turally follows the former; that all hinderances being removed, we may the more clearly trust in the God of love, for every manner of thing which is good.</P>
<P><HI>Our trespasses.</HI> The word properly signifies <HI>our debts.</HI> Thus our sins are frequently repre∣sented in scripture: every sin laying us under a fresh debt to God; to whom we already owe,
<PB N="182" REF="028060_0447_0FD68E0B1009DD90"/>as it were, ten thousand talents. What then can we answer when he shall say, <HI>Pay me that thou owest?</HI> We are utterly insolvent: we have nothing to pay: we have wasted all our sub∣stance. Therefore if he deal with us according to the rigour of his law, if he exact what he justly may, he must command us to be <HI>bound hand and foot, and delivered over to the tormentors.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed we are already bound hand and foot, by the chains of our own sins. These, consi∣dered with regard to ourselves, are chains of iron and fetters of brass. They are wounds wherewith the world, the flesh and the devil, have gashed and mangled us all over. They are dis∣eases that drink up our blood and spirits, that bring us down to the chambers of the grave. But considered as they are here, with regard to God, they are debts immense and numberless. Well therefore, seeing we have nothing to pay, may we cry unto him, that he would <HI>frankly forgive</HI> us all.</P>
<P>The word translated <HI>forgive,</HI> implies either to forgive a debt, or to unloose a chain. And if we attain the former, the latter follows of course; if our debts are forgiven, the chains fall off our hands. As soon as ever, through the free grace of God in <HI>Christ,</HI> we <HI>receive forgiveness of sins,</HI> we receive likewise <HI>a lot among those which are sanctified, by faith which is in</HI> him. Sin has lost its power: it has no dominion over those, who <HI>are under grace,</HI> that is, in favour with God. As <HI>there is now no condemnation for them that are in</HI> Christ Jesus, so they are freed from sin as well as from guilt. <HI>The righteousness of the law is fulfilled
<PB N="183" REF="028060_0448_0FD68E111F9501B8"/>in them,</HI> and they <HI>walk not after the flesh but after the spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>As we forgive them that trespass against us.</HI> In these words our Lord clearly declares, both on what condition, and in what degree or manner we may look to be forgiven of God. All our trespasses and sins are forgiven us, <HI>if</HI> we forgive, and <HI>as</HI> we forgive others. This is a point of the utmost importance. And our blessed Lord is so jealous, lest at any time we should let it slip out of our thoughts, that he not only inserts it in the body of his prayer, but presently after repeats it twice over.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 14, 15.</NOTE> <HI>If,</HI> saith he, <HI>ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</HI> Secondly, God forgives us, <HI>as</HI> we forgive others. So that if any malice or bitterness, if any taint of unkindness or anger remains, if we do not clear∣ly fully, and from the heart, forgive all men their trespasses, we so far cut short the forgive∣ness of our own. God cannot clearly and fully forgive us. He may shew us some degree of mercy. But we will not suffer him to blot out all our sins, and forgive all our iniquities.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while we do not from our hearts, forgive our neighbour his trespasses, what manner of prayer are we offering to God, when∣ever we utter these words? we are indeed set∣ting God at open defiance: we are daring him to do his worst. Forgive us our trespasses, as we
<PB N="184" REF="028060_0449_0FD68E129E4D9950"/>forgive them that trespass against us! that is in plain terms, "Do not thou forgive us at all: we desire no favour at thy hands. We pray, that thou wilt keep our sins in remembrance, and that thy wrath may abide upon us." But can you se∣riously offer such a prayer to God? and hath he not yet cast you quick into hell? O tempt him no longer! now, even now, by his grace, forgive as you would be forgiven! now have compassion on thy fellow-servant, as God hath had and will have pity on thee.</P>
<P N="15">15. <HI>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Lead us not into temptation.</HI> The word translated <HI>temptation,</HI> means trial of any kind. And so the English word temptation was formerly taken, in an indifferent sense: although now it is usually understood, of solicitation to sin. St. <HI>James</HI> uses the word in both these senses; first, in its general, then in its restrained ac∣ceptation. He takes it in the former sense when he saith,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. i. Ver. 12, 13.</NOTE> <HI>Blessed is the man that endureth tempt∣ation; for when he is tried,</HI> or approved of God, <HI>he shall receive the crown of life.</HI> He immedi∣ately adds, taking the word in the latter sense, <HI>let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of</HI> God: <HI>for</HI> God <HI>cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust,</HI> or desire, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, drawn out of God, in whom alone he is safe, <HI>and enticed,</HI> caught as a fish with a bait. Then it is, when he is thus <HI>drawn away and en∣ticed,</HI> that he properly <HI>enters into temptation.</HI> The temptation covers him as a cloud: it overspreads
<PB N="185" REF="028060_0450_0FD68E1668C21500"/>his whole soul. Then how hardly shall he escape out of the snare? therefore we beseech. God, <HI>no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to lead us into temptation,</HI> that is (seeing God <HI>tempt∣eth no man</HI>) not to suffer us to be led into it. <HI>But deliver us from evil:</HI> Rather, <HI>from the evil one;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. 'O <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is unquestionably <HI>the wicked one,</HI> emphatically so called, the prince and god of this world, who works with mighty power in the children of disobedience. But all those who are the children of God by faith, are delivered out of his hands. He may fight against them: and so he will. But he cannot conquer, unless they betray their own souls. He may tor∣ment for a time; but he cannot destroy; for God is on their side, who will not fail in the end, to <HI>avenge his own elect, that cry unto him day and night,</HI> "Lord, when we are tempted, suffer us not to enter into temptation. Do thou make a way for us to escape, that the wicked one touch us not."</P>
<P N="16">16. The conclusion of this divine prayer, com∣monly called the doxology, is a solemn thanks∣giving, a compendious acknowledgment of the attributes and works of God. <HI>For thine is the kingdom;</HI> the sovereign right of all things that are, or ever were created: yea, thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion en∣dureth throughout all ages. <HI>The power:</HI> the ex∣ecutive power, whereby thou governest all things in thy everlasting kingdom, whereby thou dost whatsoever pleaseth thee, in all places of thy do∣minion.—<HI>And the glory;</HI> the praise due from eve∣ry creature, for thy power and the mightiness of
<PB N="186" REF="028060_0451_0FD68E19DFEED9B8"/>thy kingdom, and for all thy wondrous works, which thou workest from everlasting, and shalt do, world without end, <HI>for ever and ever! Amen.</HI> So be it!</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>MATT. vi. 16, 17, 18.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Moreover, when ye fast, be not as the Hypocrites, of a sad Countenance, for they disfigure their Faces, that they may appear unto Men to fast. Verily I say unto you, they have their Reward.</P>
<P>But thou when thou fastest, anoint thy Head and wash thy Face.</P>
<P>That thou appear not unto Men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. IT has been the endeavour of Satan from the beginning of the world, to put asunder what God had joined together; to separate in∣ward from outward religion, to set one of these at variance with the other. And herein he has met with no small success, among those who were <HI>ignorant of his devices.</HI></P>
<P>Many in all ages, having a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge, have been strictly at∣tached to the <HI>righteousness of the law,</HI> the perform∣ance of outward duties, but in the mean time wholly regardless of inward righteousness, <HI>the righteousness which is of</HI> God <HI>by faith.</HI> And many
<PB N="194" REF="028060_0457_0FD68E272F0AF418"/>have run into the opposite extreme, disregarding all outward duties, perhaps even <HI>speaking evil of the law and judging the law,</HI> so far as it enjoins the performance of them.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is by this very device of Satan, that faith and works have been so often set at variance with each other. And many who had a real zeal for God, have for a time fallen into the snare on ei∣ther hand. Some have magnified faith to the ut∣ter exclusion of good works, not only from be∣ing the cause of our justification (for we know that man is <HI>justified freely by the redemption which is in</HI> Jesus) but from being the necessary fruit of it, yea, from having any place in the religion of <HI>Je∣sus Christ.</HI> Others, eager to avoid this dangerous mistake, have run as much too far the contrary way; and either maintained, That good works were the cause, at least the previous condition of justification; or spoken of them as if they were all in all, the whole religion of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. In the same manner have the end and the means of religion, been set at variance with each other. Some well-meaning men, have seemed to place all religion, in attending the prayers of the church, in receiving the Lord's supper, in hear∣ing sermons, and reading books of piety: ne∣glecting mean-time the end of all these, the love of God and their neighbour. And this very thing has confirmed others in the neglect, if not contempt of the ordinances of God; so wretchedly abused to undermine and overthrow the very end they were designed to establish.</P>
<P N="4">4. But of all the means of grace there is scarce any, concerning which men have run
<PB N="195" REF="028060_0458_0FD68E295EC624B0"/>into greater extremes, than that of which our Lord speaks in the above-mentioned words, I mean, religious fasting. How have some exalted this beyond all scripture and reason? and others utterly disregarded it? as it were, revenging themselves, by undervaluing, as much as the former had overvalued it. Those have spoken of it, as if it were all in all; if not the end itself, yet infallibly connected with it: these, as if it were just nothing, as if it were a fruitless labour, which had no relation at all thereto. Whereas it is certain the truth lies between them both. It is not all; nor yet is it nothing. It is not the end, but it is a precious means thereto; a means which God himself has ordained; and in which therefore, when it is duly used, he will surely give us his blessing.</P>
<P>In order to set this in the clearest light, I shall endeavour to shew, First, what is the nature of fasting, and what the several sorts and degrees thereof: Secondly, what are the reasons, grounds and ends of it: Thirdly, how we may answer the most plausible objections against it: and Fourthly, in what manner it should be performed.</P>
<P N="1">I. 1. I shall endeavour to shew, First, what is the nature of fasting, and what the several sorts and degrees thereof. As to the nature of it, all the inspired writers, both in the Old Testa∣ment and the New, take the word, to fast, in one single sense, for not to eat, to abstain from food. This is so clear, that it would be labour lost to quote the words of <HI>David, Nehemiah, Isaiah,</HI> and the prophets which followed, or of
<PB N="196" REF="028060_0459_0FD68E2A99AC5B70"/>our Lord and his apostles; all agreeing in this, that, to fast, is not to eat for a time prescribed.</P>
<P N="2">2. To this other circumstances were usually joined by them of old, which had no necessary connexion with it. Such were the neglect of their apparel, the laying aside those ornaments which they were accustomed to wear: the put∣ting on mourning, the strewing ashes upon their head, or wearing sackcloth next their skin. But we find little mention made in the new testa∣ment, of any of these indifferent circumstances. Nor does it appear that any stress was laid upon them, by the christians of the purer ages; how∣ever some penitents might voluntarily use them, as outward signs of inward humiliation. Much less did the apostles or the christians cotemporary with them, beat or tear their own flesh. Such <HI>discipline</HI> as this was not unbecoming the priests or worshippers of <HI>Baal.</HI> The gods of the hea∣thens were but devils; and it was doubtless ac∣ceptable to their devil-god, when his priests<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Kings xviii. 28.</NOTE> <HI>cried aloud, and cut themselves after this manner, till the blood gushed out upon them:</HI> but it cannot be pleasing to Him, nor become his followers, who <HI>came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. As to the degrees or measures of fasting, we have instances of some who have fasted seve∣ral days together. So Moses, Elijah and our blessed Lord, being indued with supernatural strength for that purpose, are recorded to have fasted without intermission, <HI>forty days and forty nights.</HI> But the time of fasting more frequently mentioned in scripture, is, one day, from morn∣ing
<PB N="197" REF="028060_0460_0FD68E2C153ED7C0"/>till evening. And this was the fast commonly observed among the ancient christians. But be∣side these, they had also their half-fasts (<HI>semije∣junia,</HI> as <HI>Tertullian</HI> stiles them) on the fourth and sixth days of the week (Wednesday and Friday) throughout the year: on which they took no sustenance till three in the afternoon, the time when they returned from the public service.</P>
<P N="4">4. Nearly related to this, is what our church seems peculiarly to mean by the term <HI>abstinence:</HI> which may be used when we cannot fast entirely by reason of sickness or hodily weakness. This is, the eating little; the abstaining in part; the taking a smaller quantity of food than usual. I do not remember any scriptural instance of this. But neither can I condemn it. For the scripture does not: it may have its use, and receive a blessing from God.</P>
<P N="5">5. The lowest kind of fasting, if it can be called by that name, is the abstaining from plea∣sant food. Of this we have several instances in scripture besides that of Daniel and his brethren: who from a peculiar consideration, namely, that they might<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dan, iv. 5, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>not defile themselves with the portion of the kings meat,</HI> nor <HI>with the wine which he drank</HI> (<HI>a daily provision</HI> of which <HI>the king had ap∣pointed for them</HI>) <HI>requested</HI> and obtained of <HI>the prince of the eunuchs, pulse to eat and water to drink.</HI> Perhaps from a mistaken imitation of this, might spring the very ancient custom, of abstaining from flesh and wine during such times as were set a-part for fasting and abstinence. If it did not rather arise from a supposition that
<PB N="198" REF="028060_0461_0FD68E2DA9723EA8"/>these were the most pleasant food, and a belief, that it was proper to use what was least pleasing, at those times of solemn approach to God.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the Jewish church, there were some stated fasts. Such was the fast of the seventh month, appointed by God himself, to be observed by all Israel, under the severest penalty.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lev. xxiii. 26, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>The</HI> Lord <HI>spake unto Moses, saying, On the tenth day of the seventh month, there shall be a day of atone∣ment; and ye shall afflict your souls—to make an atonement for you before the</HI> Lord <HI>your</HI> God. <HI>For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day he shall be cut off from among his people.</HI> In after ages several other stated fasts were added to these. So mention is made by the prophet Zechariah, of the fast, not only<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Zech. viii. 19.</NOTE> <HI>of the seventh,</HI> but also of <HI>the sourth, of the fifth, and of the tenth month.</HI></P>
<P>In the ancient christian church there were like∣wise stated fasts, and those both annual and week∣ly. Of the former sort was that before Easter; observed by some for eight and forty hours: by others, for an entire week; by many for two weeks, taking no sustenance till the evening of each day. Of the latter, those of the fourth and sixth days of the week, observed (as Epipha∣nius writes, remarking it as an undeniable fact) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>in the whole habitable earth,</HI> at least, in every place where any christians made their abode. The annual fasts in our church are, "The forty days of lent, the ember days at the four seasons, the rogation days, and the vigils or
<PB N="199" REF="028060_0462_0FD68E33B91C48F8"/>eves of several solemn festivals: the weekly, all Fridays in the year, except Christmas-day.</P>
<P>But beside those which were fixed, in every na∣tion fearing God, there have always been occa∣sional fasts, appointed from time to time, as the particular circumstances and occasions of each required. So<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. xx. 1, 3.</NOTE> when <HI>the children of Moah and the children of Ammon, came against Jehoshaphat to battle; Jehoshaphat set himself to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eh the</HI> Lord, <HI>and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.</HI> And so<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxxvi. 9.</NOTE> <HI>in the fifth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Jo∣siah, in the ninth month,</HI> when they were afraid of the king of Babylon, the princes of Judah <HI>pro∣claimed a fast before the</HI> Lord, <HI>to all the people of Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>And in like manner, particular persons, who take heed unto their ways, and desire to walk humbly and closely with God, will find frequent occasion for private seasons of thus afflicting their souls, before their Father which is in secret. And it is to this kind of fasting, that the direc∣tions here given, do chiefly and primarily refer.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. I proceed, to shew, in the second place, what are the grounds, the reasons and ends of fasting.</P>
<P>And, first, men who are under strong emoti∣ons of mind, who are affected with any vehe∣ment passion, such as sorrow or fear, are often swallowed up therein, and even <HI>forget to eat their bread.</HI> At such seasons they have little regard for food, not even what is needful to sustain na∣ture; much less for any delicacy or variety, be∣ing
<PB N="200" REF="028060_0463_0FD68E51365DEC48"/>taken up with quite different thoughts. Thus when<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. xxvsii. 15, 20.</NOTE> Saul said, <HI>I am sore distressed; for the Phi∣listines make was against me, and</HI> God <HI>is departed from me;</HI> it is recorded, <HI>he had eaten no bread, all the day nor all the night.</HI> Thus those who were in the ship with St. Paul, <HI>when no small tempest lay upon them,</HI> and all <HI>hope that they should be saved was taken away,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts xxvii. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>continued fasting, hav∣ing taken nothin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> no regular meal, for fourteen days together. And thus <HI>David and all the men that were with him,</HI> when they heard that <HI>the peo∣ple were fled from the battle, and that many of the people were fallen and dead, and</HI> Saul <HI>and</HI> Jonathan <HI>his son were dead also;</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>12.</NOTE> <HI>mourned and wept and fasted until even for</HI> Saul <HI>and</HI> Jonathan, <HI>and for the house of</HI> Israel.</P>
<P>Nay, many times they whose minds are deeply engaged, and impatient of any interruption, and even loath their needful food, as diverting their thoughts, from what they desire should engross their whole attention. Even as Saul, when on the occasion mentioned before, he had <HI>fallen all along upon the earth and there was no strength in him,</HI> yet <HI>said, I will not eat,</HI> till <HI>his servants, together with the woman compelled him.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Here then is the natural ground of fasting. One who is under deep affliction, overwhelmed with sorrow for sin, and a strong apprehension of the wrath of God, would without any rule, without knowing or considering, whether it were a command of God or not, <HI>forget to eat his bread,</HI> abstain not only from pleasant, but even from needful food. Like St. Paul, who after he was
<PB N="201" REF="028060_0464_0FD6288AF56FCB58"/><HI>led into</HI> Damascus, <HI>was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink,</HI> Acts ix. 9.</P>
<P>Yea, when the storm rose high, when <HI>an hor∣rible dread overwhelmed</HI> one who had long been without God in the world; his soul would <HI>loath all manner of meat;</HI> it would be unpleasing and irk∣some to him. He would be impatient of any thing that should interrupt his ceaseless cry, Lord, <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve! or I perish.</HI></P>
<P>How strongly is this expressed by our church, in the first part of the homily on fasting?</P>
<P>"When men feel in themselves the heavy burthen of sin, see damnation to be the reward of it, and behold with the eye of their mind the horror of hell; they tremble, they quake, and are inwardly touched with sorrowfulness of heart, and cannot but accuse themselves and open their grief unto almighty God, and call unto him for mercy. This being done seriously, their mind is so occupied (taken up) partly with sorrow and heaviness, partly with an earnest desire to be deli∣vered from this danger of hell and damnation, that all desire of meat and drink is laid apart, and loathsomeness (or loathing) of all worldly things and pleasure cometh in place. So that nothing then liketh them more than to weep, to lament, to mourn, and both with words and behaviour of body to show themselves weary of life."</P>
<P N="3">3. Another reason or ground of fasting is this. Many of those who now fear God, are deeply sensible how often they have sinned against him, by the abuse of these lawful things. They know, how much they have sinned by excess of food; how long they have transgressed the holy law of
<PB N="202" REF="028060_0465_0FD62897E03671D8"/>God, with regard to temperance, if not sobriety too: how they have indulged their sensual appe∣tites, perhaps to the impairing even their bodily health; certainly to the no small hurt of their soul. For hereby they continually fed and in∣creased that sprightly folly, that airiness of mind, that levity of temper, that gay inattention to things of the deepest concern, that giddiness and carelessness of spirit, which were no other than drunkenness of soul, which stupified all their no∣blest faculties, no less than excess of wine or strong drink. To remove therefore the effect, they remove the cause: They keep at a distance from all excess. They abstain, as far as is possi∣ble, from what had well nigh plunged them in everlasting perdition. They often wholly refrain; always take care to be sparing and temperate in all things.</P>
<P N="4">4. They likewise well remember, how fulness of bread, increased not only carelessess and le∣nity of spirit, but also foolish and unholy desires, yea, unclean and vile affections. And this expe∣rience puts beyond all doubt. Even a genteel; regular sensuality, is continually sensualizing the soul, and sinking it into a level with the beasts that perish. It cannot be expressed what an ef∣fect variety and delicacy of food have on the mind as well as the body; making it just ripe for every pleasure of sense, as soon as opportunity sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll in∣vite. Therefore on this ground also e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y wise man will refrain his foul, and keep it low; will wean it more and more from all those indulgences of the inferior appetites, which naturally tend to chain it down to earth, and to pollute as well as debase it. Here is another perpetual reason for
<PB N="203" REF="028060_0466_0FD68E35D5CE2358"/>fasting: to remove the food of lust and sensuality, to withdraw the incentives of foolish and hurtful desires, of vile and vain affections.</P>
<P N="5">5. Perhaps we need not altogether omit (altho' I know not if we should do well, to lay any great stress upon it) another reason for fasting, which some good men have largely insisted on: namely, the punishing themselves for having abused the good gifts of God, by sometimes wholly refraining from them: thus exercising a kind of holy revenge upon themselves, for their past folly and ingratitude, in turning the things which should have been for their health, into an occasion of falling. They suppose <HI>David</HI> to have had an eye to this when he said, <HI>I wept and chas∣tened,</HI> or punished <HI>my soul with fasting:</HI> and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> when he mentions <HI>what revenge</HI> godly sor∣row occasioned in the <HI>Corinthians.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. A fifth, and more weighty reason for fast∣ing, is, That it is an help to prayer: par∣ticularly, when we set apart larger portions of time for private prayer. Then especially it is, that God is often pleased to lift up the souls of his servants above all the things of earth, and sometimes to wrap them up, as it were, into the third heavens. And it is chiefly, as it is an help to prayer, that it has so frequently been found a means in the hand of God, of con∣firming and increasing not one virtue, not chas∣tity only (as some have idly imagined, without any ground, either from scripture, reason or experience) but also seriousness of spirit, ear∣nestness, sensibility, and tenderness of consci∣ence; deadness to the world, and consequently
<PB N="204" REF="028060_0467_0FD68E36F9294530"/>the love of God and every holy and heavenly affection.</P>
<P N="7">7. Not that there is any natural or necessary connexion, between fasting, and the blessings God conveys thereby. But he will have mercy <HI>as</HI> he will have mercy: he will convey whatsoever seemeth him good, by whatsoever means he is pleased to appoint. And he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in all ages ap∣pointed this, to be a means <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing his wrath, and obtaining whatever blessings we from time to time stand in need of.</P>
<P>How powerful a means this is, to avert the wrath of God, we may learn from the remarka∣ble instance of <HI>Ahab. There was none like</HI> him, <HI>who did sell himself;</HI> wholly give himself up, like a slave bought with money, <HI>to work wickedness.</HI> Yet whenever he <HI>rent his cloaths and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and went softly: The word of the</HI> Lord <HI>came to</HI> Elijah, <HI>saying, S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st thou how</HI> Ahab <HI>humbleth himself before me? Because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days.</HI></P>
<P>It was for this end, to avert the wrath of God, that <HI>Daniel</HI> sought God, <HI>with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.</HI> This appears from the whole tenor of his prayer, particularly from the solemn conclusi∣on of it. <HI>O</HI> Lord, <HI>according to all thy righteousness∣es</HI> (or mercies) <HI>let thy anger be turned away from thy holy mountain—Hear the prayer of thy servant, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate.—O</HI> Lord, <HI>hear! O</HI> Lord, <HI>forgive: O</HI> Lord, <HI>hearken and do, for thine own sake,</HI> Dan. ix. 3, 16, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. But it is not only from the people of God that we learn, when his anger is moved, to seek
<PB N="205" REF="028060_0468_0FD68E3817AADE50"/>him by fasting and prayer; but even from the heathens. When Jonah had declared, <HI>yet forty days and</HI> Nineveh <HI>shall be destroyed, the people of</HI> Nineveh <HI>proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth From the greatest of them unto the least. For the king of</HI> Nineveh <HI>arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. And he caused it to be proclaim∣ed and published through</HI> Nineveh, <HI>let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing. Let them not feed, nor drink water.</HI> (Not that the beast had sinned, or could repent; but that by their example man might be admonished, considering that for his sin, the anger of God was hanging over all creatures.) <HI>Who can tell, if</HI> God <HI>will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</HI>—And their labour was not in vain. The fierce anger of God was turn∣ed away from them. God <HI>saw their works</HI> (the fruits of that repentance and faith, which he had wrought in them by his prophet) <HI>and</HI> God <HI>re∣pented of the evil that he had said he would do unto them; and he did it not.</HI> son. 3, 4, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. And it is a means not only of turning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y the wrath of God, but also of obtaining whatever blessings we stand in need of. So when the other tribes were smitten before the <HI>Benja∣mites</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judg. xx. 26, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>all the children of Israel went up unto the house of the</HI> Lord, <HI>and wept and fasted that day until; even;</HI> and then the Lord said, <HI>go up again; for to-morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.</HI>
<PB N="206" REF="028060_0469_0FD68E3C378E7538"/>So <HI>Samuel</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. vii. 6, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>gathered all Israel together, when they were in bondage to the Philistines, and they fasted on that day before the</HI> Lord: and when <HI>the Phi∣listines drew near to battle against Israel, the</HI> Lord <HI>thundered upon them with a great thunder, and dis∣comfited them, and they were smitten before Israel.</HI> So <HI>Ezra; I</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ezra. viii. 21.</NOTE> <HI>proclaimed a fast at the river Aha∣va, that we might afflict ourselves before our</HI> God, <HI>to seek of him a right way for us, and for our lit∣tle ones—and he was entreated of us.</HI> So <HI>Nehe∣miah; I</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Nehem. i. 4, 11.</NOTE> <HI>fasted and prayed before the</HI> God <HI>of heaven, and said, prospe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.</HI> And God granted him mercy in the sight of the king.</P>
<P N="10">10. In like manner, the apostles always joined fasting with prayer, when they desired the bless∣ing of God on any important undertaking. Thus we read, <HI>Acts</HI> xiii. <HI>There were in the church that was at</HI> Antioch <HI>certain prophets and teachers—As they ministered to the</HI> Lord <HI>and fasted</HI> (doubtless for direction in this very affair) <HI>the Holy Ghost said, separate me</HI> Barnabas <HI>and</HI> Saul, <HI>for the work whereunto I have called them. And when they had</HI> (a second time) <HI>fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away,</HI> ver. 1, 2, 3.</P>
<P>Thus also Paul and Barnabas themselves, as we read in the following chapter, when they <HI>re∣turned again to</HI> Lystra, Iconium <HI>and</HI> Antioch, <HI>con∣firming the souls of the disciples;</HI> and <HI>when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had
<PB N="207" REF="028060_0470_0FD68E3E2BACC170"/>prayed with fasting, commended them to the</HI> Lord, ver. 23.</P>
<P>Yea, that blessings are to be obtained in the use of this means, which are no otherwise at∣tainable, our Lord expressly declares in his an∣swer to his disciples, asking,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xvii. 19, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Why could not we cast him out? Jesus said unto them, because of your vnbelief; for verily I say unto you, if ye have faith as a grain of mustard-seed, ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove, and nothing shall be impossible unto you. Howbeit, this kind</HI> (of devils) <HI>goeth not out, but by prayer and fasting:</HI> these being the appointed means of attaining that faith, whereby the very devils are subject unto you.</P>
<P N="11">11. These were the appointed means. For it was not merely by the light of reason, or of natural conscience (as it is called) that the people of God have been in all ages directed, to use fasting as a means to these ends. But they have been from time to time taught it of God himself, by clear and open revelations of his will. Such is that remarkable one by the prophet Joel,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Joel ii. 12, &amp;c.</NOTE> <Q>Therefore thus saith the Lord, turn you un∣to me, with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning—Who knoweth if the Lord will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him? blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly—Then will the Lord be jealous over his land, and will spare his people. Yea, I will send you corn and wine and oil—I will no more make you a reproach among the hea∣then.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="028060_0471_0FD68E3E31816E70"/>
Nor are they only temporal blessings which God directs his people to expect in the use of these means. For at the same time that he promised to those who should seek him with fasting, and weeping, and mourning, <HI>I will render you the ears which the grashopper hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar and the palmer-worm, my great army,</HI> he subjoins, <HI>so shall ye eat and be satisfied, and praise the name of the</HI> Lord <HI>your</HI> God—<HI>Ye sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>w that I am in the midst of Israel, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the</HI> Lord <HI>your</HI> God. And then immediately follows the great gospel-promise, <Q>I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophecy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions. And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.</Q></P>
<P N="12">12. Now whatsoever reasons there were to quicken those of old in the zealous and constant discharge of this duty, they are of equal force still to quicken us. But above all these we have a peculiar reason for being in fastings often, namely, the command of him by whose name we are called. He does not indeed in this place ex∣pressly enjoin, either fasting, giving of alms or prayer. But his directions how to fast, to give alms, and to pray, are of the same force with such injunctions. For the commanding us, to do any thing <HI>that,</HI> is an unquestionable com∣mand, to do that thing; seeing it is impossible to perform it thus, if it be not performed at all. Consequently, the saying, give alms, pray, fast in such a manner, is a clear command to per∣form
<PB N="209" REF="028060_0472_0FD68E3FB14F7190"/>all those duties: as well as to perform them in that manner, which shall in no wise lose its reward.</P>
<P>And this is a still farther motive and encou∣ragement, to the performance of this duty; even the promise which our Lord has graciously an∣nexed to the due discharge of it: <HI>Thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</HI> Such are the plain grounds, reasons and ends of fast∣ing; such our encouragement to persevere there∣in, notwithstanding abundance of objections which men, wiser than their Lord, have been continually raising against it.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. The most plausible of these I come now to consider. And, First, It has been frequently said, "Let a christian fast from sin, and not from food: this is what God requires at his hands." So he does: but he requires the other also. Therefore this ought to be done, and that not left undone.</P>
<P>View your argument in its full dimensions; and your will easily judge of the strength of it.</P>
<P>"If a christian ought to abstain from sin, then he ought not to abstain from food:</P>
<P>But a christian ought to abstain from sin:</P>
<P>Therefore he ought not to abstain from food."</P>
<P>That a christian ought to abstain from sin, is most true. But does it follow from hence, that he ought not to abstain from food? Yea, let him do both the one and the other. Let him, by the grace of God, always abstain from sin; and let him often abstain from food; for such reasons and
<PB N="210" REF="028060_0473_0FD68E41148426C8"/>ends as experience and scripture plainly shew to be answered thereby.</P>
<P N="2">2. "But is it not better (as it has, Secondly, been objected) to abstain from pride and vanity, from foolish and hurtful desires, from peevishness, and anger, and discontent, than from food?" Without question it is. But here again we have need to remind you of our Lord's words, <HI>these things ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</HI> And indeed the latter is only in order to the former; it is a means to that great end. We abstain from food with this view, that by the grace of God, conveyed into our souls, through this outward means, in conjunction with all the other channels of his grace which he hath appointed, we may be enabled to abstain from eve∣ry passion and temper, which is not pleasing in his sight. We refrain from the one, that being en∣dued with power from on high, we may be able to refrain from the other, so that your argument proves just the contrary to what you designed. It proves, that we ought to fast. For if we ought to abstain from evil tempers and desires, then we ought thus to abstain from food: since these little instances of self-denial are the ways God hath chose, wherein to bestow that great salvation.</P>
<P N="3">3. "But we do not find it so in fact: (this is a third objection.) We have fasted much and often. But what did it avail? we were not a whit better: we found no blessing therein. Nay, we have found it an hinderance rather than an help. Instead of preventing anger, for instance,
<PB N="211" REF="028060_0474_0FD68E429ECAEF40"/>or fretfulness, it has been a means of increasing them to such a height, that we could neither bear others nor ourselves." This may very possibly be the case. It is possible, either to fast or pray, in such a manner, as to make you much worse than before; more unhappy, and more unholy. Yet the fault does not lie in the means itself; but in the manner of using it. Use it still, but use it in a different manner. Do what God commands as he commands it, and then doubtless his promise shall not fail; his blessing shall be with-held no longer: but <HI>when thou fastest in secret, he that seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. "But is it not mere superstition (so it has been, Fourthly, objected) to imagine that God regards such little things as these?" if you say it is, you condemn all the generation of God's children. But will you say, these were all weak, superstitious men? can you be so hardy as to af∣firm this, both of Moses and Joshua, of Samuel and David, of Jehoshaphat, Ezra, Nehemiah, and all the prophets? Yea, of a greater than all, the Son of God himself? it is certain, both our Master, and all these his servants, did imagine, that fasting is not a little thing, and that he who is higher than the highest doth regard it. Of the same judgment, it is plain, were all the apostles, after they were <HI>filled with the Holy Ghost and with wisdom.</HI> When they had <HI>the unction of the Holy One, teaching</HI> them <HI>all things,</HI> they still <HI>approved themselves the ministers of</HI> God, <HI>by fastings,</HI> as well as <HI>by the armour of righteousness on the right hand, and on the left.</HI> After <HI>the Bridegroom was
<PB N="212" REF="028060_0475_0FD68E441444F700"/>taken from them, then did they fast in those days.</HI> Nor would they attempt any thing (as we have seen above) wherein the glory of God was near∣ly concerned, such as the sending forth labourers into the harvest, without solemn fasting as well as prayer.</P>
<P N="5">5. "But if fasting be indeed of so great im∣portance, and attended with such a blessing, is it not best, say some, Fifthly, to fast always? not to do it now and then, but to keep a continual fast? to use as much abstinence at all times, as our bodily strength will bear?" let none be dis∣couraged from doing this. By all means use as little and plain food, exercise as much self-denial herein at all times, as your bodily strength will bear. And this may conduce, by the blessing of God, to several of the great ends above-menti∣oned. It may be a considerable help not only to chastity, but also to heavenly-mindedness; to the weaning your affections from things below, and setting them on things above. But this is not fasting, scriptural fasting: it is never termed so in all the Bible. It in some measure answers some of the ends hereof but still it is another thing. Practise it by all means; but not so as thereby to set aside a command of God, and an instituted means of averting his judgment, and obtaining the blessings of his children.</P>
<P N="6">6. Use continually then as much abstinence as you please; which taken thus, is no other than christian temperance. But this need not at all interfere with your observing solemn times of fasting and prayer. For instance; your habitual
<PB N="213" REF="028060_0476_0FD68E4832DB2658"/>abstinence or temperance, would not prevent your fasting in secret, if you was suddenly over∣whelmed with huge sorrow and remorse, and with horrible fear and dismay. Such a situation of mind would almost constrain you to fast: you would loath your dainty food: you would scarce endure even to take such supplies, as were need∣ful for the body, till God lifted-you up-<HI>out of the horrible pit, and set your feet upon a rock, and or∣dered your goings.</HI> The same would be the case if you was in agony of desire vehemently wrestling with God for his blessing. You would need none to instruct you, not to eat bread, till you had ob∣tained the request of your lips.</P>
<P N="7">7. Again had you been at Nineveh, when it was proclaimed throughout the city, <HI>Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock taste any thing: let them not feed or drink water, but let them cry might∣ily unto</HI> God: would your continual fast have been any reason for not bearing part in that general humiliation? doubtless it would not. You would have been as much concerned as any other, not to taste food on that day.</P>
<P>No more would abstinence, or the observing a continual fast, have excused any of the children of Israel, from fasting on the tenth day of the seventh month, the great annual day of atone∣ment. There was no exception for these in that solemn decree, <HI>Whatsoever soul it shall be, that shall not be afflicted</HI> (shall not fast) <HI>in that day, he shall be cut off from among his people.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, had you been with the brethren in An∣tioch at the time when they fasted and prayed,
<PB N="214" REF="028060_0477_0FD68E4DD568CDF0"/>before the sending forth of Barnabas and Saul, can you possibly imagine that your temperance or abstinence would have been a sufficient cause for not jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g therein? without doubt if you had not, you would soon have been cut off from the christian community. You would have deserved∣ly been cast out from among them, "as bringing confusion into the church of God."</P>
<P N="4">IV. 1. I am, in the last place, to shew, in what manner we are to fast, that it may be an acceptable service unto the Lord. And, first, Let it be done <HI>unto the</HI> Lord with our eye singly fixed on him. Let our intention herein be this, and this alone, to glorify our Father which is in heaven: to express our sorrow and shame, for our manifold tranfgressions of his holy law: to wait for an increase of purifying grace, drawing our affections to things above: to add seriousness and earnestness to our prayers: to avert the wrath of God, and to obtain all the great and precious promises, which he hath made to us in Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>Let us beware of mocking God, of turning our fast as well as our prayer into an abomination unto the Lord, by the mixture of any temporal view, particularly, by seeking the praise of men. A∣gainst this our blessed Lord more peculiarly guards us, in the words of the text. <HI>Moreover, when ye fast, be ye not as the hypocrites</HI> (such were too many who were called the people of God) <HI>of a sad countenance;</HI> four, affectedly sad, putting their looks into a peculiar form. <HI>For they dis∣figure
<PB N="215" REF="028060_0478_0FD68E4F57BA18C0"/>their faces,</HI> not only by unnatural distorti∣ons, but also by covering them with dust and ash∣es— <HI>That they may appear unto men to fast.</HI> This is their chief, if not only design. <HI>Verily I say unto you, they have their reward;</HI> even the ad∣miration and praise of men. <HI>But thou when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy fact.</HI> Do as thou art accustomed to do at other times —<HI>That thou appear not unto men to fast</HI> (let this be no part of thy intention: if they know it with∣out any desire of thine, it matters not, thou art neither the better nor the worse) <HI>but unto thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. But if we desire this reward, let us be∣ware, Secondly, of fancying we <HI>merit</HI> any thing of God by our fasting. We cannot be too often warned of this; inasmuch as a desire to <HI>establish our own righteousness,</HI> to procure salvation of <HI>debt,</HI> and not of <HI>grace,</HI> is so deeply rooted in all our hearts:—Fasting is only a way which God hath ordained, wherein we wait for his <HI>unme∣rited</HI> mercy; and wherein, without any desert of ours, he hath promised, <HI>freely</HI> to give us his blessing.</P>
<P N="3">3. Not that we are to imagine, the perform∣ing the bare outward act, will receive any bles∣sing from God. <HI>Is it such a fast that I have cho∣sen, saith the</HI> Lord: <HI>a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to spread sackcloth and ashes under him?</HI> are these outward acts, however strictly per∣formed, all that is meant by a man's <HI>afflicting his soul? Wilt thou call this a fast, and an ac∣ceptable
<PB N="216" REF="028060_0479_0FD62889A95B72B8"/>day to the</HI> Lord? No, surely. If it be a mere external service, it is all but lost labour. Such a performance may possibly an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> body. But as to the soul, it profiteth nothing.</P>
<P N="4">4. Yea, the body may sometimes be afflicted too much, so as to be unsit for the works of our calling. This also we are diligently to guard against: for we ought to preserve our health, as a good gist of God. Therefore care is to be taken, whenever we fast, to proportion the fast to our strength. For we may not offer God murder for sacrifice, or destroy our bodies to help our souls.</P>
<P>But at these solemn seasons, we may even in great weakness of body, avoid that other ex∣treme, for which God condemns those who of old expostulated with him for not accepting their fasts. <HI>Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not?—Behold in the day of your fast you find pleasure,</HI> saith the Lord—If we cannot wholly abstain, we may at least abstain from plea∣sant food; and then we shall not seek his face in vain.</P>
<P N="5">5. But let us take care to afflict our souls as well as our bodies. Let every season either of public or private fasting, be a season of exer∣cising all those holy affections, which are implied im a broken and contrite heart. Let it be a sea∣son of devout mourning, of godly sorrow for sin; Such a sorrow as that of the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> concerning which the apostle saith, <HI>I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance. For ye were made sorry after a godly
<PB N="217" REF="028060_0480_0FD68E529D92CD00"/>manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing. For godly sorrow</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) the sorrow which is according to God, which is a precious gift of his spirit, lifting the soul to God (from whom it flows) <HI>worketh repentance to salvation, not to be repented of.</HI> Yea, and let our sorrowing after a godly fort, work in us the same inward and outward repentance; the same en∣tire change of heart, renewed after the image of God, in righteousness and true holiness; and the same change of life, till we are holy as he is holy in all manner of conversation. Let it work in us the same <HI>carefulness,</HI> to be found in him, without spot and blameless the same <HI>clearing of ourselves,</HI> by our lives rather than words, by our abstaining from all appearance of evil; the same <HI>indignation,</HI> vehement abhor∣rence of every sin; the same <HI>fear</HI> of our own deceitful hearts; the same <HI>desire</HI> to be in all things conformed to the holy and acceptable will of God; the same <HI>zeal</HI> for whatever may be a means of his glory, and of our growth in the knowledge of our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI> And the same <HI>revenge</HI> against <HI>Satan</HI> and all his works, against all filthiness both of flesh and spirit, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> vii. 9, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. And with fasting let us always join fervent prayer, pouring out our whole souls before God, confessing our sins with all their aggravations, humbling ourselves under his mighty hand, lay∣ing open before him all our wants, all our guiltiness and helplessness. This is a season for enlarging our prayers, both in behalf of our∣selves
<PB N="218" REF="028060_0481_0FD68E56464C03C8"/>and of our brethren. Let us now bewail the sins of our people, and cry aloud for the city of our God: That the Lord may build up <HI>Zion,</HI> and cause his face to shine on her desolations, Thus we may observe the men of God in an∣cient times always joined prayer and fasting to∣gether. Thus the apostles in all the instances cited above: and thus our Lord joins them in the discourse before us.</P>
<P N="7">7. It remains only, in order to our observing such a fast, as is acceptable to the Lord, that we add alms thereto; works of mercy, after our power, both to the bodies and fouls of men. <HI>With such sacrifices</HI> also God <HI>is well-pleased.</HI> Thus the angel declares to <HI>Cornelius,</HI> fasting and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts x. 4, &amp;c.</NOTE> praying in his house, <HI>Thy prayers and thine ulms are come up for a memorial before</HI> God. And this God himself expressly and largely de∣clares,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa. lviii. 6, &amp;c.</NOTE> <Q>Is not this the fast that I have chosen, to undo the heavy burdens, to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? When thou seest the naked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thyself from thy own flesh? Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: And thy righteousness shall go before thee, the glory of the Lord shall be thy rere-ward. Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall
<PB N="219" REF="028060_0482_0FD68E598DD1C7E0"/>say, here I am.—If <HI>(when thou fastest)</HI> thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: Then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon-day. And the <HI>Lord</HI> shall guide thee con∣tinually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make thy bones fat: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring whose waters fail not.</Q></P>

<P N="1">1. FROM those which are commonly termed <HI>religious actions,</HI> and which are real bran∣ches of true religion, where they spring from a pure and holy intention, and are performed in a manner suitable thereto, our Lord proceeds to
<PB N="224" REF="028060_0485_0FD68E5F1B39C1D0"/>the actions of <HI>common life,</HI> and shews that the same purity of intention, is as indispensably re∣quired in our ordinary business, as in giving alms, or fasting or prayer.</P>
<P>And without question the same purity of in∣tention, "which makes our alms and devotions acceptable, must also make our labour or employ∣ment, a proper offering to God. If a man pur∣sues his business, that he may raise himself to a state of figure and riches in the world, he is no longer serving God in his employment, and has no more title to a reward from God, than he who gives alms that he may be <HI>seen,</HI> or prays that he may be <HI>heard</HI> of men. For vain and earthly designs are no more allowable in our employ∣ments, than in our alms and devotions. They are not only evil when they mix with our good works," with our religious actions, "but they have the same evil nature when they enter into the common business of our employments. If it were allowable to pursue them in our worldly em∣ployments, it would be allowable to pursue them in our devotions. But as our alms and devotions are not an acceptable service, but when they proceed from a pure intention, so our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>on employment cannot be reckoned a service <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o him, but when it is performed with the same piety of heart."</P>
<P N="2">2. This our blessed Lord declares in the live∣liest manner, in those strong and comprehensive words which he explains, enforces and enlarges upon, throughout this whole chapter. <HI>The light of the body is the eye. If therefore thine eye be sin∣gle, thy whole body shall be full of light: but if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of dark∣ness.</HI>
<PB N="225" REF="028060_0486_0FD68E622DDCA190"/>The eye is the intention: What the eye is to the body, the intention is to the soul. As the one guides all the motions of the body, so does the other those of the soul. This eye of the soul is then said to be single, when it looks at one thing only; when we have no other design, but to <HI>know</HI> God, <HI>and</HI> Jesus Christ <HI>whom he hath sent:</HI> to know him with suitable affections, loving him as he hath loved us: to please God in all things: to serve God (as we love him) with all our heart and mind and soul and strength: and to enjoy God in all and above all things, in time and in eternity.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>If thine eye be</HI> thus <HI>single,</HI> thus fixed on God, <HI>thy whole body shall be full of light. Thy whole body.</HI>— All that is guided by the intention, as the body is by the eye. All thou art: all thou dost: thy desires, tempers, affections; thy thoughts and words and actions. The whole of these <HI>shall be full of light:</HI> full of true, divine knowledge. This is the first thing we may here understand by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght. <HI>In his light thou shall see light. He which</HI> of old <HI>commanded light to shine out of darkness, shall shine in thy heart.</HI> He shall enlighten the eyes of thy understanding, with the knowledge of the glory of God. His spirit shall reveal unto thee the deep things of God. The inspiration of the Holy One shall give thee understanding, and cause three to know wisdom secretly. Yea, <HI>the ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing</HI> which thou receivest of him, <HI>shall abide in thee and teach thee of all things.</HI></P>
<P>How does experience con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> this? Even af∣ter God hath opened the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es of our under∣standing, if we seek or des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> any thing else than
<PB N="226" REF="028060_0487_0FD68E64A1239CB0"/>God, how soon is our foolish heart darkened? then clouds again rest upon our souls. Doubts and fears again overwhelm us. We are tossed to and fro, and know not what to do, or which is the path wherein we should go. But when we desire and seek nothing but God, clouds and doubts vanish away. We <HI>who were sometime darkness, are now light in the</HI> Lord. The night now shineth as the day; and we find, <HI>the path of the upright is light.</HI> God sheweth us the path wherein we should go, and <HI>maketh plain the way before our face.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The second thing which we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay here un∣derstand by light, is holiness. While thou seekest God in all things, thou shalt find him in all, the fountain of all holiness, continually filling thee with his own likeness, with justice, mercy and truth. While thou lookest unto Jesus and him alone, thou shalt be filled with the mind that was in him. Thy soul shall be renewed day by day, after the image of him that created it. If the eye of thy mind be not removed from him, if thou endurest <HI>seeing him that is invisible,</HI> and seek∣ing nothing else in heaven or earth, then as thou beholdest the glory of the Lord, <HI>thou shall be transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, by the</HI> spirit <HI>of the</HI> Lord.</P>
<P>And it is also matter of daily experience, that <HI>by grace we are</HI> thus saved <HI>through faith.</HI> It is by faith that the eye of the mind is opened, to see the light of the glorious love of God. And as long as it is steadily fixed thereon, on God in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, we are more and more filled with the love of God
<PB N="227" REF="028060_0488_0FD68E691C1A2B08"/>and man, with meekness, gentleness, long suf∣fering; with all the fruits of holiness, which are through Christ Jesus, to the glory of God the Father.</P>
<P N="5">5. This light which fills him who has a single eye, implies, Thirdly, Happiness as well as holi∣ness. Surely <HI>light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is to see the sun.</HI> But how much more to see the sun of righteousness, continually shining up∣on the soul? and if there be any consolation in Christ, in any comfort of love, if any peace that passeth all understanding, if any rejoicing in hope of the glory of God, they all belong to him whose eye is single. Thus is his <HI>whole body full of light.</HI> He walketh in the light as God is in the light, rejoicing evermore, praying without ceas∣ing, and in every thing giving thanks, enjoying whatever is the will of God concerning him in Christ Jesus.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If thine eye be evil:</HI> we see there is no medium between a single and an evil eye. If the eye be not single, then it is evil. If the intention, in whatever we do, be not singly to God, if we seek any thing else, then our <HI>mind and conscience are defiled.</HI></P>
<P>Our eye therefore is evil, if in any thing we do, we aim at any other end than God; if we have any view, but to know and to love God, to please and serve him in all things: if we have any other design than to enjoy God, to be happy in him both now and for ever.</P>
<P N="9">9. If thine eye be not singly fixed on God, <HI>thy whole body shall be full of darkness.</HI> The veil shall still remain on thy heart. Thy mind
<PB N="228" REF="028060_0489_0FD68E6B16147740"/>shall be more and more blinded, by <HI>the</HI> God <HI>of this world, lest the light of the glorious gospel of</HI> Christ <HI>should shine upon thee.</HI> Thou wilt be full of ignorance and error touching the things of God, not being able to receive or discern them. And even when thou hast some desire to serve God, thou wilt be full of uncertainty as to the manner of serving him; sinding doubts and dif∣ficulties on every side, and not seeing any way to escape.</P>
<P>Yea, if thine eye be not single, if thou seek any of the things of earth, thou shalt be full of ungodliness and unrighteousness: thy desires, tempers, affections, being all out of course, be∣ing all dark, and vile, and vain. And thy con∣versation will be evil, as well as thy heart, not <HI>seasoned with salt,</HI> or <HI>meet to minister grace unto the hearers,</HI> but idle, unprofitable, corrupt, griev∣ous to the Holy Spirit of God.</P>
<P N="8">8. Both <HI>destruction and unhappiness are in thy ways;</HI> for <HI>the way of peace hast</HI> thou <HI>not known.</HI> There is no peace, no settled, solid peace, for them that know not God. There is no true, nor lasting content for any, who do not seek him with their whole heart. While thou aimest at any of the things that perish, <HI>all that cometh is vanity.</HI> Yea, not only vanity, but <HI>vexation of spirit,</HI> and that both in the pursuit and the enjoy∣ment also. Thou walkest indeed in a vain sha∣dow, and disquietest thyself in vain. Thou walkest in darkness that may be felt. <HI>Sleep on;</HI> but thou canst not <HI>take thy rest.</HI> The dreams of life can give pain, and that thou knowest: but ease they cannot give. There is no rest, in this
<PB N="229" REF="028060_0490_0FD68E6D0A034738"/>world or the world to come, but only in God the centre of spirits.</P>
<P><HI>If the light which is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</HI> If the intention which ought to enlighten the whole soul, to fill it with knowledge, and love, and peace, and which, in fact, does so as long as it is single, as long as it aims at God alone: if this be darkness; if it aim at any thing beside God, and consequently cover the soul with darkness instead of light, with ig∣norance and error, with sin and misery: O how great is that darkness! it is the very smoke which ascends out of the bottomless pit! it is the essen∣tial night, which reigns in the lowest deep, in the land of the shadow of death.</P>
<P N="9">9. Therefore <HI>lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal.</HI> If you do, it is plain your eye is evil: it is not singly fixed on God.</P>
<P>With regard to most of the commandments of God, whether relating to the heart or life, the heathens of Africa or America stand much on a level, with those that are called christians. The christians observe them (a few only being except∣ed) very near as much as the heathens. For in∣stance: the generality of the natives of England, commonly called christians, are as sober and as temperate, as the generality of the heathens, near the Cape of Good Hope. And s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>he Dutch or French christians, are as humble and as chaste, as the Choctaw or Cherokee-Indians. It is not easy to say, when we compare the bulk of the nations in <HI>Europe</HI> with those in <HI>America,</HI> whether
<PB N="230" REF="028060_0491_0FD68E6F0EB1EEB0"/>the superiority lies on the one side or the other. At least the <HI>American</HI> has not much the advantage. But we cannot affirm this, with regard to the com∣mand now before us. Here the heathen has far the pre-eminence. He desires and seeks nothing more than plain food to eat, and plain raiment to put on. And he seeks this only from day to day. He reserves, he lays up nothing; unless it be, as much corn at one season of the year, as he will need before that season returns. This com∣mand, therefore, the heathens, though they know it not, do constantly and punctually observe. They <HI>lay up for themselves no treasures upon earth;</HI> no stores of purple or sine linen, of gold or silver, which either <HI>moth or rust may corrupt,</HI> or <HI>thieves break through and steal.</HI> But how do the christi∣ans observe, what they profess to receive as a com∣mand of the most high God? not at all; not in any degree; no more than if no such command had ever been given to man. Even the <HI>good chris∣tians,</HI> as they are accounted by others as well as themselves, pay no manner of regard thereto. It might as well be still hid in its original <HI>Greek,</HI> for any notice they take of it. In what christian ci∣ty do you find one man of five hundred, who makes the least scruple, of laying up just as much treasure as he can? of increasing his goods just as far as he is able? there are indeed those who would not do this unjustly; there are many who will neither rob nor steal; and some, who will not defraud their neighbour; nay, who will not gain, either by his ignorance or necessity. But this is quite another point. Even these do not scruple the thing but the manner of it. They do not
<PB N="231" REF="028060_0492_0FD68E73AC46C720"/>scruple the <HI>laying up treasures upon earth;</HI> but the laying them up by dishonesty. They do not start at disobeying Christ, but at a breach of hea∣then morality. So that even these honest men do no more obey this command, than a high∣wayman or a house-breaker. Nay, they never designed to obey it. From their youth up, it never entered into their thoughts. They were bred up by their christian parents, masters and friends, without any instruction at all concern∣ing it: unless it were this, to break it as soon, and as much as they could, and to continue break∣ing it to their lives end.</P>
<P N="10">10. There is no one instance of spiritual infa∣tuation in the world, which is more amazing than this. Most of these very men read, or hear the bible read, many of them every Lord's day. They have read or heard these words an hundred times, and ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> never suspect that they are themselves condemned thereby, any more than by those which forbid parents to offer up their sons or daughters unto <HI>Moloch.</HI></P>
<P>O that God would speak to these miserable self-deceivers, with his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, his mighty voice! that they may at last awake out of the snare of the devil, and the scales may fall from their eyes!</P>
<P N="11">11. Do you ask, what it is to lay <HI>up treasures on earth?</HI> it will be needful to examine this tho∣roughly. And let us, first, observe, what is not forbidden in this command, that we may then clearly discern, what is.</P>
<P>We are not forbidden in this command, First, <HI>to provide things honest in the sight of all men,</HI> to
<PB N="232" REF="028060_0493_0FD68E74E6DCA390"/>provide wherewith we may <HI>render unto all their due,</HI> whatsoever they can justly demand of us. So far from it, that we are taught of God, to <HI>owe no man any thing.</HI> We ought therefore to use all diligence in our calling, in order to owe no man any thing: this being no other than a plain law of common justice, which our Lord came <HI>not to destroy, but to fulfil.</HI></P>
<P>Neither, Secondly, does he here forbid the pro∣viding for ourselves, such things as are needful for the body; a sufficiency of plain, wholesome food to eat, and clean raiment to put on. Yea, it is our duty, so far as God puts it into our pow∣er, to provide these things also; to the end we may <HI>eat our own bread,</HI> and be <HI>burdensome to no man.</HI></P>
<P>Nor yet are we forbidden, Thirdly, to provide for our children, and for those of our own house∣hold. This also it is our duty to do, even upon principles of heathen morality. Every man ought to provide the plain necessaries of life, both for his own wife and children; and to put them into a capacity of providing these for themselves, when he is gone hence and is no more seen. I say, of providing <HI>these,</HI> the plain necessaries of life, not delicacies, not superfluities: and that by their <HI>diligent labour;</HI> for it is no man's duty to furnish them any more than himself, with the means either of luxury or idleness. But if any man provide not thus far for his own children (as well as for <HI>the widows of his own house;</HI> of whom primarily St. Paul is speaking, in those well known words to Timothy:) <HI>he hath</HI> practically <HI>denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel,</HI> or heathen.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="028060_0494_0FD68E77513CB070"/>
Lastly, We are not forbidden in these words, to lay up from time to time, what is needful for the carrying on our worldly but ness, in such a measure and degree, as is sufficient to answer the foregoing purposes: in such a measure, as first, to owe no man any thing; secondly, to procure for ourselves the necessaries of life; and thirdly, to furnish those of our own house with them while we live, and with the means of procuring them when we are gone to God.</P>
<P N="12">12. We may now clearly discern (unless we are unwilling to discern it) what that is which is forbidden here. It is, The designedly procuring more of this world's goods, than will answer the foregoing purposes: the labouring after a larger measure of worldly substance, a larger increase of gold and silver; the laying up any more than these ends require, is what is here expressly and absolutely forbidden. If the words have any meaning at all, it must be this; for they are capable of no other. Consequently, whoever he is, that owing no man any thing, and having food and raiment for himself and his household, together with a sufficiency to carry on his worldly business, so far as answers these reasonable pur∣poses: whosoever, I say, being already in these circumstances, seeks a still larger portion on earth, he lives in an open habitual denial of the Lord that bought him. He hath practically <HI>denied the faith, and is worse than an</HI> African <HI>or</HI> American <HI>infidel.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. Hear ye this all ye that dwell in the world, and love the world wherein ye dwell. Ye may be <HI>highly esteemed of men;</HI> but ye are
<PB N="234" REF="028060_0495_0FD68E79CF8A4580"/><HI>on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ination in the sight of</HI> God. How long shall your souls cleave to the dust? How long will ye load yourselves with thick clay? When will ye awake and see, that the open, speculative heathens are nearer the kingdom of heaven than you? When will ye be persuaded to chuse the better part; that which cannot be taken away from you? When will ye seek only to <HI>lay up treasures in heaven,</HI> renouncing, dreading, ab∣horring all other? If you aim at <HI>laying up trea∣sures on earth,</HI> you are not barely losing your time, and spending your strength for that which is not bread: for what is the fruit if you suc∣ceed? You have murdered your own soul. You have extinguished the last spark of spiritual life therein. Now indeed, in the midst of life you are in death. You are a living man, but a dead christian. <HI>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</HI> Your heart is sunk into the dust: Your soul cleaveth to the ground. Your affections are set, not on things above, but on things on the earth; on poor husks that may poison, but cannot satisfy an everlasting spi∣rit, made for God. Your love, your joy, your desire, are all placed on the things when perish in the using. You have thrown away the treasure in heaven: <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> are lost. You have gained riches and hell-fire.</P>
<P N="14">14. O <HI>how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of</HI> God! When our Lord's disciples were astonished at his speaking thus, he was so far from retracting it that he re∣peated the same important truth, in stronger terms than before. <HI>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man
<PB N="235" REF="028060_0496_0FD68E7C58360B38"/>to enter into the kingdom of</HI> God. How hard is it for them whose every word is applauded, not to be wise in their own eyes! how hard, for them not to think themselves better than the poor, base, uneducated herd of men! how hard, not to seek happiness in their riches, or in things dependent upon them; in gratifying the desire of the flesh, the desire of the eye, or the pride of life! O ye rich, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?— only with God all things are possible.</P>
<P N="15">15. And even if you do not succeed, what is the fruit of your <HI>endeavouring</HI> to lay up treasures on earth? <HI>They that will be rich</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, they that desire, that endeavour after it, whether they succeed or no) <HI>full into a temptation and a snare,</HI> a gin, a trap of the devil, <HI>and into many foolish and hurtful lusts;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, desires with which reason hath nothing to do; such as properly belong, not to rational and im∣mortal beings, but only to the brute-beasts, which have no understanding: <HI>which drown men in de∣struction and perdition,</HI> in present and eternal mi∣sery. Let us but open our eyes, and we may daily see the melancholy proofs of this: men, who desiring, resolving to be rich, <HI>coveting after money, the root of all evil, have</HI> already <HI>pierced themselves through with many sorrows,</HI> and antici∣pated the hell to which they are going.</P>
<P>The cautiousness with which the apostle here speaks, is highly observable. He does not affirm this absolutery of <HI>the rich;</HI> for a man may pos∣sibly be rich, without any fault of his, by an over-ruling providence, preventing his own choice.
<PB N="236" REF="028060_0497_0FD68E7DD12319A8"/>But he affirms it of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>These who desire</HI> or seek to <HI>be rich.</HI> Riches, dangerous as they are, do not always <HI>drown men in destruction and perdition.</HI> But the <HI>desire of riches</HI> does: those who calmly desire and deliberately seek to attain them, whether they do, in fact, gain the world or no, do infallibly lose their own souls. These are they, that sell him who bought them with his blood, for a few pieces of gold or silver. These enter into a covenant with death and hell: and their covenant shall stand. For they are daily mak∣ing themselves meet to partake of their inheri∣tance with the devil and his angels.</P>
<P N="16">16. O who shall warn this generation of vi∣pers, to flee from the wrath to come! not those who lie at their gate or cringe at their feet, de∣siring to be fed with the crumbs that fall from their tables. Not those who court their favour or fear their frown; none of those who mind earth∣ly things. But if there be a christian upon earth, if there be a man who hath overcome the world, who desires nothing but God, and fears none but him that is able to destroy both body and soul in hell: thou, O man of God, speak and spare not; lift up thy voice like a trumpet. Cry aloud and shew these honourable sinners the desperate con∣dition wherein they stand. It may be, one in a thousand may have ears to hear, may arise and shake himself from the dust; may break loose from these chains that bind him to the earth, and at length lay up treasures in heaven.</P>
<P N="17">17. And if it should be, that one of these, by the mighty power of God, awoke and ashed,
<PB N="237" REF="028060_0498_0FD68E8145FE0AD8"/>what must I do to be saved? the answer, accord∣ing to the oracles of God, is clear, full and ex∣press. God doth not say to thee, <HI>sell all that thou hast.</HI> Indeed he who seeth the hearts of men, saw it needful to enjoin this in one peculiar ease, that of the <HI>young, rich ruler.</HI> But he never laid it down for a general rule, to all rich men, in all succeeding generations. His general direction is, First, <HI>be not high-minded.</HI> God seeth not as man seeth. He esteems thee not for thy riches, for thy grandeur or equipage, for any qualification or accomplishment which is directly or indirectly owing to thy wealth, which can be bought or pro∣cured thereby. All these are with him as dung and dross: let them be so with thee also. Beware thou think not thyself to be one jot wiser, or bet∣ter for all these things. Weigh thyself in another balance: estimate thyself only by the measure of faith and love which God hath given thee. If thou hast more of the knowledge and love of God than he, thou art on this account and no other, wiser and better, more valuable and honourable than him, who is with the dogs of thy stock. But if thou hast not this treasure, thou art more fool∣ish, more vile more truly contemptible, I will not say, than the lowest servant under thy roof, but than the beggar laid at thy gate full of sores.</P>
<P N="18">18. Secondly, <HI>Trust not in uncertain riches.</HI> Trust not in them for help: and trust not in them for happiness.</P>
<P>First, Trust not in them for help. Thou art miserably mistaken, if thou lookest for this in gold or silver. These are no more able to see
<PB N="238" REF="028060_0499_0FD68E825247A448"/>thee <HI>above the world,</HI> than to set-thee above the devil Know that both the world and the prince of this world laugh at all such preparations against them. These will little avail in the day of trou∣ble: even if they remain in the trying hour. But it is not certain, that they will: for how oft do they <HI>make themselves wing? and fly away?</HI> But if not, what support will they afford, even in the ordinary troubles of life? the desire of thy eyes, the wife of thy youth, thy son, thine only son, or the friend which was as thy own soul, is taken away at a stroke. Will thy riches re-animate the breathless clay, or call back its late inhabitant? will they secure thee from sickness, diseases, pain? do these visit the poor only? nay; he that feeds thy flocks or tills thy ground, has less sickness and pain than thou. He is more rarely visited by these unwelcome guests: and if they come there at all, they are more easily driven away from the lit∣tle cot, than from "the cloud-topp'd palaces." And during the time that thy body is chastened with pain, or consumes away with pining sick∣ness, how do thy treasures help thee? let the poor heathen answer.</P>
<Q><L>Ut lippum pictae tabulae, fomenta podagrum,</L>
<L>Auriculas citharae collectà sorde dolentes.</L></Q>
<P N="19">19. But there is at hand a greater trouble that all these. <HI>Thou</HI> art to die. <HI>Thou</HI> art to sink into dust; to return to the ground from which thou wast taken, to mix with common clay. <HI>Thy</HI> bo∣dy is to go to the earth as it was, while thy spi∣rit returns to God that gave it. And the time
<PB N="239" REF="028060_0500_0FD68E85B86A69D0"/>draws on: the years slide away with a swift tho' silent pace. Perhaps your day is far spent: the noon of life is past, and the evening shadows begin to rest upon you. You feel in yourself sure approaching decay. The springs of life wear away apace. Now what help in your riches? Do they sweeten death? Do they en∣dear that solemn hour? Quite the reverse. <HI>O death how bitter art thou, to a man that liveth at rest in his possessions?</HI> How unacceptable to him is that awful sentence, <HI>This night shall thy soul be required of thee?</HI>—Or will they prevent the unwelcome stroke, or protract the dreadful hour? Can they deliver your soul that it should not see death? Can they restore the years that are past? Can they add to your appointed time, a month, a day, an hour, a moment?—Or will the good things you have chosen for your portion here, follow you over the great gulf? Not so: na∣ked came you into this world; naked must you return.
<Q><L>Linquenda tellus, &amp; domus &amp; placens</L>
<L>Uxor: nec harum quas seris arborum</L>
<L>Te prater invisam cupressum,</L>
<L>Ulla brevem dominum sequetur.</L></Q>
Surely were not these truths too plain to be <HI>observ∣ed,</HI> because they are too plain to be denied; no man that is to die could possibly trust, for help <HI>in un∣certain riches?</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. And trust not in them for happiness. For here also they will be found <HI>deceitful upon the weights.</HI> Indeed this every reasonable man may infer, from what has been observed already. For
<PB N="240" REF="028060_0501_0FD68E86DF1EC818"/>if neither thousands of gold and silver, not any of the advantages or pleasures purchased thereby, can prevent our being miserable, it evidently fol∣lows, they cannot make us happy. What happi∣ness can they afford him, who in the midst of all is constrained to cry out,
<Q><L>"To my new courts sad thought does still repair,</L>
<L>"And round my gilded roofs hangs hovering care."</L></Q>
Indeed experience is here so full, strong, and un∣deniable, that it makes all other arguments need∣less. Appeal we therefore to fact. Are the rich and great, the only happy men? and is each of them more or less happy, in proportion to his measure of riches? are they happy at all? I had well nigh said, they are of all men most misera∣ble! rich man, for once, speak the truth from thy heart. Speak, both for thyself, and for thy bre∣thren.
<Q><L>"Amidst our plenty something still—</L>
<L>To me, to thee, to him is wanting!</L>
<L>That cruel something unpossess'd</L>
<L>Corrodes and leavens all the rest."</L></Q>
Yea, and so it will, till thy wearisome days of v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ity are shut up in the night of death.</P>
<P>Surely then to trust in riches for happiness, is the greatest folly of all that are under the sun! are you not convinced of this? Is it pos∣sible, you should still expect to find happiness in money, or all it can procure? what! can silver and
<PB N="241" REF="028060_0502_0FD68E886A2F87B0"/>gold, and eating and drinking, and horses and servants, and glittering apparel, and diversions and pleasuren (as they are called) make thee hap∣py? they can as soon make thee immortal.</P>
<P N="21">21. These are all dead show. Regard them not. <HI>Trust</HI> thou <HI>in the living</HI> God. So shalt thou be safe under the shadow of the Almighty; his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buck∣ler. He is a very present help in time of trouble; such an help as can never fail. Then shalt thou say, if all thy other friends die, <HI>The</HI> Lord <HI>liverth, and blessed be any strong helper!</HI> he shall remember thee when thou liest sick upon thy bed: when vain is the help of man, when all the things of the earth can give no support, he will <HI>make all thy bed in thy sickness.</HI> He will sweeten thy pain; the consolations of God shall cause thee to clap thy hands in the flames. And even when this house of earth is well nigh shaken down, when it is just ready to drop into the dust, he will teach thee to say, <HI>O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? thanks be unto</HI> God, <HI>who giveth me the victory through my</HI> Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>O trust in him for happiness as well as for help. All the springs of happiness are in him. Trust <HI>in him who giveth us all things richly to en∣joy,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Who of his own rich and free mercy, holds them out to us, as in his own hand, that receiving them as his gift, and as pledges of his love, we may <HI>enjoy all</HI> that we possess. It is his love gives a relish to all we taste, puts life and sweetness in∣to
<PB N="242" REF="028060_0503_0FD68E9097A76F68"/>all, while every creature leads us up to the great Creator, and all earth is a scule to hea∣ven. He transfuses the joys that are at his own right-hand, into all he bestows on his thankful children: who having fellowship with the Father and is son Jesus Christ, enjoy him in all and above all.</P>
<P N="22">22. Thirdly, Seek not to <HI>increase in goods. Lay not up for thyself treasures upon earth.</HI> This is a flat, positive command, full as clear, as <HI>thou shall not commit adultery.</HI> How then is it possi∣ble for a rich man to grow richer, without deny∣ing the Lord that bought him? yea, how can any man, who has already the necessaries of life, gain or aim at more, and be guiltless? <HI>lay not up,</HI> faith our Lord, <HI>treasures upon earth.</HI> If in spite of this, you do and will lay up, money or goods, what <HI>moth or rust</HI> may <HI>corrupt, or thieves break through and steal:</HI> if you will add house to house, or field to field, why do you call yourself a christian? you do not obey Jesus Christ. You do not design it. Why do you name yourself by his name? <HI>why call ye me</HI> Lord, Lord, faith he himself, <HI>and do not the things which I say?</HI></P>
<P N="23">23. If you ask, "But what must we do with our goods, seeing we have more than we have occasion to use, if we must not lay them up? must we throw them away?" I answer, if you threw them into the sea, if you were to cast them into the fire and consume them, they would be better bestowed than they are now. You can∣not find so mischievous a manner of throwing them away, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ither the laying them up for
<PB N="243" REF="028060_0504_0FD68E95208FA1E0"/>your posterity, or the laying them out upon yourselves, in folly and superfluity. Of all possi∣ble methods of <HI>throwing them away,</HI> these two are the very worst; the most opposite to the god∣pel of Christ, and the most pernicious to year own soul.</P>
<P>How pernicious to your own soul the latter of these is, has been excellently shewn by a late writer. "If we waste our money we are not only guilty of wasting a talent which God has given us, but we do ourselves this farther harm, we turn this useful talent into a powerful means of corrupting ourselves: because so far as it is spent wrong so far it is spent in the support of some wrong temper, in gratifying some vain and unreasonable desires, which as christians we are obliged to renounce."</P>
<P>"As wit and fine parts cannot be only trifled away, but will expose those that have them to greater follies: so money cannot be only trifled away, but if it is not used according to reason and religion, will make people live a more silly and extravagant life, than they would have done without it: if therefore you dont spend your money in doing good to others, you must spend it to the hurt of yourself. You act like one that refuses the cordial to his sick friend, which he cannot drink himself without inflaming his blood. For this is the case of superfluous money; if you give it to those who want it, it is a cordial. If you spend it upon yourself in something that you do not want, it only inflames and disorders your mind."</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="028060_0505_0FD68E979B08DE30"/>
"In using riches where they have no real use, nor we any real want, we only use them to our great hurt, in creating unreasonable desires, in nourishing ill tempers, in indulging foolish pas∣sions, and supporting a vain turn of mind. For high eating and drinking, fine cloaths and fine houses, state and equipage, gay pleasures and diversions, do all of them naturally hurt and disorder our heart. They are the food and nourishment of all the folly and weakness of our nature. They are all of them the support of something, that ought not to be supported. They are contrary to that sobriety and piety of heart, which relishes divine things. They are so many weights upon our mind, that make us less able and less inclined to raise our thoughts and affections to things above."</P>
<P>"So that money thus spent is not merely wasted or lost, but it is spent to bad purposes and miserable effects; to the corruption and disor∣der of our hearts, to the making us unable to fol∣low the sublime doctrines of the gospel. It is but like keeping money from the poor, to buy poison for ourselves."</P>
<P N="24">24. Equally inexcusable are those, who <HI>lay up</HI> what they do not need for any reasonable pur∣poses. "If a man had hands and eyes and feet, that he could give to those that wanted them; if he should lock them up in a chest, in∣stead of giving them to his brethren, that were blind and lame, should we not justly reckon him an inhuman wretch? if he should rather chuse to amuse himself with hoarding them up,
<PB N="245" REF="028060_0506_0FD68E99191B5A58"/>than entitle himself to an eternal reward, by giving them to those that wanted eyes and hands, might we not justly reckon him mad?"</P>
<P>"Now money has very much the nature of eyes and feet. If therefore we lock it up in chests, while the poor and distressed want it for their necessary uses, we are not far from the cru∣elty of him, that chuses rather to hoard up the hands and eyes, than to give them to those that want them. If we chuse to lay it up, rather than to entitle ourselves to an eternal reward, by disposing of our money well, we are guilty of his madness, that rather chuses to lock up eyes and hands, than to make himself for ever blessed, by giving them to those that want them."</P>
<P N="25">25. May not this be another reason why rich men shall so hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven? a vast majority of them are under a curse, under the peculiar curse of God: inas∣much as in the general tenor of their lives, they are not only robbing God continually, imbez∣zling and wasting their Lord's goods, and by that very means corrupting their own souls: but also robbing the poor, the hungry, the naked, wronging the widow and the fatherless, and making themselves accountable for all the want, affliction and distress, which they may, but do not remove. Yea, doth not the blood of all those who perish for want, of what they either lay up, or lay out needlessly, cry against them from the earth? O what account will they give, to him who is ready to judge both the quick and the dead!</P>
<P N="26"><PB N="246" REF="028060_0507_0FD68E9B35BD2808"/>
26. The true way of employing what you do not want yourselves, you may, Fourthly, learn from those words of our Lord, which are the counterpart of what went before: <HI>Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven: where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through and steal.</HI> Put out whatever thou canst spare, upon better security than this world can afford. Lay up thy treasures in the bank of heaven: And God shall restore them in that day. <HI>He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth un∣to the</HI> Lord, <HI>and look, what he layeth out, it shall be paid him again.</HI> Place that, saith he, unto my account. Howbeit! <HI>thou owest me thine own∣self also!</HI></P>
<P>Give to the poor with a single eye, with an up∣right heart, and "Write, so much given to God." For <HI>inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</HI></P>
<P>This is the part of a <HI>faithful and wife steward.</HI> Not, to sell either his houses or lands, or prin∣cipal stock, be it more or less, unless some pecu∣liar circumstance should require it; and not to de∣sire or endeavour to increase it, any more than to squander it away in vanity but to employ it wholly to those wise and reasonable pur∣poses, for which his Lord has lodged it in his hands The wise steward, after having pro∣vided his own household, with what is needful for life and godliness, <HI>makes</HI> himself <HI>friends with</HI> all that remains from time to time, of the <HI>mam∣mon of unrighteousness; that when he fails, they may receive him into everlasting habitations:</HI> that
<PB N="247" REF="028060_0508_0FD68E9CA5DB7F70"/>whensoever his earthly tabernacle is dissolved, they who were before carried into <HI>Abraham's</HI> bo∣som, after having eaten his bread, and worn the fleece of his flock, and praised God for the consolation, may welcome him into paradise, and to <HI>the house of</HI> God, <HI>eternal in the heavens.</HI></P>
<P N="27">27. We <HI>charge you</HI> therefore, <HI>who are rich in this world,</HI> as having authority from our great Lord and Master, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>to be habitually do∣ing good,</HI> to live in a course of good works. <HI>Be ye merciful as your Father which is in heaven is merciful,</HI> who doth good and ceaseth not. <HI>Be ye merciful,</HI>—"How far?"—<HI>After your power,</HI> with all the ability which God giveth. Make this your only measure of doing good, not any beggarly maxims or customs of the world. We <HI>charge you to be rich in good works;</HI> as you have much, to give plenteously. Freely ye have re∣ceived; freely give; so as to lay up no treasure but in heaven. Be ye <HI>ready to distribute,</HI> to every one according to his necessity. Dis∣perse abroad, give to the poor; deal your bread to the hungry. Cover the naked with a gar∣ment, entertain the stranger, carry or send re∣lief to them that are in prison. Heal the sick; not by miracle, but thro' the blessing of God upon your seasonable support. Let the blessing of him that was ready to perish thro' pining want, come upon thee. Defend the oppressed, plead the cause of the fatherless, and make the wi∣dow's heart sing for joy.</P>
<P N="28">28. We exhort <HI>you,</HI> in the name of the Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> to be <HI>willing to communicate:</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. To be of the same spirit (tho' not in the

Thus <HI>lay up for yourselves a good foundation,</HI> not in the world which now is, but rather <HI>for the time to come, that ye may lay hold on eternal life.</HI> The great foundation indeed of all the blessings of God, whether temporal or eternal, is the Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> his righteousness and blood, what he hath done, and what he hath suffered for us. And <HI>other foundation,</HI> in this sense, <HI>can no man lay;</HI> no not an apostle, no not an angel from heaven.

<P N="1">1. IT is recorded of the Nations whom the king of <HI>Assyria,</HI> after he had carried <HI>Isra∣el</HI> away into captivity, placed in the cities of <HI>Sa∣maria, they feared the</HI> Lord, <HI>and served their own
<PB N="255" REF="028060_0514_0FD68EAAD718BC28"/>gods. These nations,</HI> saith the inspired writer, <HI>fear∣ed the</HI> Lord, performed an outward service to him, (a plain proof that they had a fear of God though not according to knowledge) <HI>and served their gra∣ven images, both their children and their children's children; as did their fathers, so did they unto this day,</HI> 2. Kings xvii. 33, &amp;c.</P>
<P>How nearly does the practice of most modern christians, resemble this of the ancient heathens? <HI>they fear the</HI> Lord: they also perform an outward service to him, and hereby shew, they have some fear of God; but they likewise <HI>serve their own gods.</HI> There are those who <HI>teach them</HI> (as there were who taught the <HI>Assyrians</HI>) <HI>the manner of the</HI> God <HI>of the land;</HI> the God whose name the country bears to this day, and who was once wor∣shipped there with an holy worship. <HI>Howbeit,</HI> they do not serve him alone; they do not fear him enough for this. But <HI>every nation maketh gods of their own, every nation in the cities wherein they dwell. These nations fear the</HI> Lord, they have not laid aside the outward form of wor∣shipping him. But <HI>they serve their graven images,</HI> silver and gold, he work of men's hands. Mo∣ney, pleasure and praise, the goods of this world, more than divide their service with the God of Israel. This is the manner both of <HI>their children and their children's children; as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> although speaking in a loose way, af∣ter th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mon manner of men, these poor heathens were said <HI>to fear the</HI> Lord, yet we may observe the Holy Ghost immediately adds, speak∣ing
<PB N="256" REF="028060_0515_0FD68EB0B5C30408"/>according to the truth and real nature of things, <HI>they fear not the</HI> Lord, <HI>neither do after the law and commandment which the</HI> Lord <HI>commanded the children of Jacob: with whom the</HI> Lord <HI>made a covenant, and charged them, saying, ye shall not fear other gods, nor serve them.—But the</HI> Lord <HI>your</HI> God <HI>ye shall fear, and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all you enemies.</HI></P>
<P>The same judgment is past by the unerring spirit of God, and indeed by all, the eyes of whose understanding he hath opened, to discern the things of God, upon these poor christians, commonly so called. If we speak according to the truth and real nature of things, <HI>they fear not the</HI> Lord, <HI>neither do they serve him.</HI> For they do not <HI>after the covenant the</HI> Lord <HI>hath made with them; neither after the law and command∣ment which he hath commanded them,</HI> saying, thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. <HI>They serve other gods</HI> unto this day. And <HI>no man can serve two masters.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. How vain is it for any man to aim at this? To attempt the serving of two masters. Is it not easy to foresee, what must be the unavoida∣ble consequence of such an attempt? <HI>either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will hold to the one and despise the other.</HI> The two parts of this sentence, although separately pro∣posed, are to be understood in a connexion with each other. For the latter part is a consequence of the former. He will naturally <HI>hold to</HI> him whom he loves. He will so cleave to him, as to perform to him a willing, faithful, and diligent
<PB N="257" REF="028060_0516_0FD68EB2707355E8"/>service. And in the mean time, he will so far, at least, <HI>despise</HI> the master he hates, as to have little regard to his commands, and to obey them, if at all, in a slight and careless man∣ner. Therefore, whatsoever the wise men of the world may suppose, <HI>Ye cannot serve</HI> God <HI>and mammon.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Mammon</HI> was the name of one of the hea∣then gods, who was supposed to preside over riches. It is here understood of riches them∣selves; gold and silver, or in general, money: and by a common figure of speech, of all that may be purchased thereby; such as ease, honour, and sensual pleasure.</P>
<P>But what are we here to understand, by <HI>serving</HI> God? and what, by <HI>serving mammon?</HI></P>
<P>We cannot <HI>serve</HI> God, unless we believe in him. This is the only true foundation of serv∣ing him. Therefore, the believing in God, as <HI>reconciling the world to himself</HI> through Christ Jesus, the believing in him, as a loving, par∣doning God, is the first great branch of his ser∣vice.</P>
<P>And, thus to believe in God implies, to <HI>trust</HI> in him as our strength, without whom we can do nothing, who every moment endues us with power from on high, without which it is impos∣sible to please him: as our help, our only help in time of trouble, who compasseth us about with songs of deliverance: as our shield, our defend∣er, and the lifter up of our head above all our enemies that are round about us.</P>
<P>It implies, to trust in God as our happiness; as the centre of spirits, the only rest of our souls; the only good who is adequate to all
<PB N="258" REF="028060_0517_0FD68EB3D4AAD138"/>our capacities, and sufficient to satisfy all the de∣sires he hath given us.</P>
<P>It implies (what is nearly allied to the other) to trust in God, as our end; to have an eye to him in all things; to use all things only as means of enjoying him: wheresoever we are, or what∣soever we do, to see him that is invisible, looking on us well-pleased, and refer all things to him in Christ Jesus.</P>
<P N="5">5. Thus to believe, is the first thing we are to understand by <HI>serving</HI> God. The second is, to love him.</P>
<P>Now, to love God in the manner the scrip∣ture describes, in the manner God himself re∣quires of us, and by requiring engages to work in us, is to love him as the one God; that is, <HI>with all our heart and with all our soul, and with all our mind, and with all our strength:</HI> it is, to desire God alone for his own sake; and nothing else, but with reference to him: to re∣joice in God; to delight in the Lord; not only to seek but find happiness in him: to enjoy God as the chiefest among ten thousand; to rest in him, as our God and our all. In a word, to have such a possession of God, as makes us always happy.</P>
<P N="6">6. A third thing we are to understand by <HI>serv∣ing</HI> God, is, to resemble or imitate him.</P>
<P>So the ancient father, <HI>Optimus Dei cultus, imi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ari quem colis.</HI> It is the best worship or service of God, to imitate him you worship.</P>
<P>We here speak, of imitating or resembling him in the spirit of our minds. For here the true christian imitation of God begins. God
<PB N="259" REF="028060_0518_0FD68EB5515F8668"/>is a spirit; and they that imitate or resemble him, must do it in spirit and in truth.</P>
<P>Now God is love. Therefore they who resem∣ble him in the spirit of their minds, are trans∣formed into the same image. They are merciful, even as he is merciful. Their soul is all love. They are kind, benevolent, compassionate, ten∣der-hearted: and that not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward. Yea, they are, like him, loving unto every man, and their mercy extends to all his works.</P>
<P N="7">7. One thing more we are to understand by <HI>serving</HI> God, and that is, the obeying him; the glorifying him with our bodies, as well as with our spirits; the keeping his outward command∣ments: the zealously doing whatever he hath en∣joined, the carefully avoiding whatever he hath forbidden: the performing all the ordinary acti∣ons of life, with a single eye and a pure heart; offering them all in holy, fervent love, as sacrifices to God, through Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="8">8. Let us consider now, what we are to un∣derstand, on the other hand, by <HI>serving mam∣mon.</HI> And first, it implies, the trusting in rich∣es, in money, or the things purchaseable thereby, as our strength, the means whereby we shall perform, whatever cause we have in hand: the trusting in them as our help, by which we look to be comforted in, or delivered out of trouble.</P>
<P>It implies, the trusting in the world for hap∣piness; the supposing that <HI>a man's life consist∣eth</HI> (the comfort of his life) <HI>in the abundance of
<PB N="260" REF="028060_0519_0FD68EBD28644948"/>the things which he possesseth:</HI> the looking for rest, in the things that are seen; for content in out∣ward plenty; the expecting that satisfaction in the things of the world, which can never be sound out of God.</P>
<P>And if we do this, we cannot but make the world our end; the ultimate end, if not of all, at least of many of our undertakings, many of our actions and designs: in which we shall aim only at an increase of wealth, at the obtaining plea∣sure or praise; at the gaining a larger measure of temporal things, without any reference to things eternal.</P>
<P N="9">9. The <HI>serving mammon</HI> implies, Secondly, Loving the world; desiring it for its own sake; the placing our joy in the things thereof, and set∣ting our hearts upon them; the seeking (what in∣deed it is impossible we should find) our happiness therein; the resting with the whole weight of our souls upon the staff of this broken reed; although daily experience shews it cannot support, but will only <HI>enter into our hand and pierce it.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. To resemble, to be conformed to the world, is a third thing we are to understand by <HI>serving mammon:</HI> to have not only designs, but desires, tempers, affections suitable to those of the world: to be of an earthly, sensual mind, chained down to the things of earth: To be self-willed, inordinare lavers of ourselves; to think highly of our own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ments; to desire and delight in the praise of men: to fear, shun, and abhor reproach: To be impatient of re∣proof, easy to be provok<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and swift to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rn evil for evil.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="261" REF="028060_0520_0FD68EBF12702378"/>
11. To <HI>serve mammon</HI> is, lastly, to obey the world, by outwardly conforming to its maxims and customs; to walk as other men walk, in the common road, in the broad, smooth, beaten path; to be in the fashion, to follow a multi∣tude; to do like the rest of our neighbours; that is, to do the will of the flesh and the mind, to gratify our appetites and inclinations; to sa∣crifice to ourselves; aim at our own ease and pleasure, in the general course both of our words and actions.</P>
<P>Now what can be more undeniably clear, than that we <HI>cannot</HI> thus <HI>serve</HI> God <HI>and mam∣mon?</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. Does not every man see, that he cannot <HI>comfortably</HI> serve both? That to trim between God and the world, is the sure way to be dis∣appointed in both, and to have no rest either in one or the other? How uncomfortable a con∣dition must he be in, who having the fear but not the love of God, who serving him, but not with all his heart, has only the toils and not the joys of religion? He has religion enough to make him miserable, but not enough to make him happy: His religion will not let him enjoy the world; and the world will not let him enjoy God. So that by halting be∣tween both he loses both, and has no peace ei∣ther in God or the world.</P>
<P N="13">13. Does not every man see, that he cannot serve both, <HI>consistently</HI> with himself? What more glaring inconsistency can be conceived, than must continually appear in his whole behaviour, who is endeavouring to obey both these masters, striving to <HI>serve</HI> God <HI>and mammon?</HI> He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in∣deed
<PB N="262" REF="028060_0521_0FD68EC096D2B278"/><HI>a sinner that goeth two ways;</HI> one step forward and another backward. He is continual∣ly building up with one hand, and pulling down with the other. He loves sin, and he hates it: he is always seeking, and yet always fleeing from God. He would and he would not. He is not the same man, for one day, no, not for an hour together. He is a motly mixture of all sorts of contrarieties; a heap of contradictions jumbled in one. O, be consistent with thyself, one way or the other. Turn to the right-hand or to the left. If <HI>mammon</HI> be God, serve thou him; if the Lord, then serve Him. But never think of serving either at all, unless it be with thy whole heart</P>
<P N="14">14. Does not every reasonable, every think∣ing man see, that he cannot <HI>possibly serve</HI> God <HI>and mammon?</HI> Because there is the most ab∣solute contrariety, the most irreconcileable en∣mity between them. The contrariety between the most opposite things on earth, between fire and water, darkness and light, vanishes into nothing, when compared to the contrariety be∣tween God and mammon. So that in what∣soever respect you serve the one, you necessarily renounce the other. Do you believe in God through <HI>Christ?</HI> Do you trust in him as your strength, your help, your shield, and your ex∣ceeding great reward? As your happiness? Your end in all, above all things? Then you cannot trust in riches? It is absolutely impossible you should, so long as you have this faith in God. Do you thus <HI>trust in riches?</HI> Then you have denied the saith. You do not trust in the living God. Do you <HI>love</HI> God? Do
<PB N="263" REF="028060_0522_0FD68EC7CC6AD158"/>you seek and find happiness in him? then you cannot love the world; neither the things of the world. You are crucified to the world and the world crucified to you. Do you <HI>love the world?</HI> are your affections set on things beneath? do you seek happiness in earthly things? then it is impossible you should love God. Then the love of the Father is not in you. Do you <HI>resemble</HI> God? are you merciful, as your Father is mer∣ciful? are you transformed by the renewal of your mind, into the image of him that created you? then you cannot be conformed to the pre∣sent world. You have renounced all its affec∣tions and lusts. Are you conformed to the world? does your soul still bear the image of the earthly? then you are not renewed in the spirit of your mind. You do not bear the image of the heavenly. Do you obey God? are you zealous to do his will on earth as the angels do in heaven? then it is impossible you should <HI>obey mammon.</HI> Then you set the world at open defi∣ance. You trample its customs and maxims under foot, and will neither follow nor be led by them. Do you follow the world? do you live like other men? do you please men? do you please yourself? then you cannot be a ser∣vant of God. You are of your master and father the devil.</P>
<P N="15">15. Therefore thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve. Thou shalt lay aside all thoughts of obeying two masters, of serving God and mammon. Thou shalt propose to thyself no end, no help, no happiness, but God. Thou shalt seek nothing
<PB N="264" REF="028060_0523_0FD68ECC4CF006E8"/>in earth or heaven but him: thou shalt aim at nothing, but to know, to love and enjoy him. And because this is all your business below, the only view you can reasonably have, the one de∣sign you are to pursue in all things; <HI>therefore I say unto you</HI> (as our Lord continues his discourse) <HI>take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.</HI> A deep and weighty di∣rection, which it imports us well to consider and throughly to understand.</P>
<P N="16">16. Our Lord does not here require, that we should be utterly without thought, even touch∣ing the concerns of this life. A giddy, careless temper is at the farthest remove from the whole religion of Jesus Christ. Neither does he re∣quire us to be <HI>slothful in business,</HI> to be slack and dilatory therein. This likewise is contrary to the whole spirit and genius of his religion. A christian abhors sloth as much as drunkenness, and flees from idleness as he does from adultery. He well knows, that there is one kind of thought and care, with which God is well-pleased; which is absolutely needful for the due performance of those outward works, unto which the providence of God has called him.</P>
<P>It is the will of God, that every man should labour to <HI>eat his own bread:</HI> yea, and that eve∣ry man should provide for his own, for them of his own household. It is likewise his will, that we should <HI>owe no man any thing,</HI> but <HI>pro∣vide things honest in the sight of all men.</HI> But this cannot be done, without taking some thought, without having some care upon our
<PB N="265" REF="028060_0524_0FD68ED113A6EDF8"/>minds: yea, often, not without long and seri∣ous thought, not without much and earnest care. Consequently, this care, to provide for ourselves and our household, this thought, how to render to all their dues, our blessed Lord does not con∣demn. Yea, it is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour.</P>
<P>It is good and acceptable to God, that we should so take thought concerning whatever we have in hand, as to have a clear comprehension of what we are about to do, and to plan our bu∣siness before we enter upon it. And it is right that we should carefully consider from time to time, what steps we are to take therein; as well as that we should prepare all things before hand, for the carrying it on in the most effectual man∣ner. This care, termed by some, "The care of the head," it was by no means our Lord's design to condemn.</P>
<P N="17">17. What he here condemns is, "The care of the heart:" The anxious, uneasy care: the care that hath torment; all such care as does hurt, either to the soul or body. What he forbids is, that care which sad experience shews, wastes the blood and drinks up the spirits: which an∣ticipates all the misery it fears, and comes to torment us before the time. He forbids only that care, which poisons the blessings of to-day, by fear of what may be to-morrow; which can∣not enjoy the present plenty, through apprehen∣sions of future want. This care is not only a fore disease, a grievous sickness of soul, but also an heinous offence against God, a sin of the deepest dye. It is an high affront to the gra∣cious
<PB N="266" REF="028060_0525_0FD68ED23B091920"/>governor and wise disposer of all things; necessarily implying, that the great judge does not do right, that he does not order all things well. It plainly implies, that he is wanting, either in wisdom, if he does not know what things we stand in need of: or in goodness, if he does not provide those things, for all who put their trust in him. Beware therefore that you take not thought in this sense: be ye anxiously careful for nothing. Take no uneasy thought: this is a plain, sure rule, <HI>uneasy</HI> care is <HI>un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ful care.</HI> With a single eye to God do all that in you lies, to provide things honest in the sight of all men. And then give up all into better hands: leave the whole event to God.</P>
<P N="18">18. <HI>Take no thought</HI> of this kind, no uneasy thought even <HI>for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</HI> if then God gave you life, the greater gift, will he not give you food to sus∣tain it? if he hath given you the body, how can ye doubt, but he will give you raiment to cover it? more especially, if you give yourselves up to him, and serve him with your whole heart. <HI>Be∣hold,</HI> see before your eyes, <HI>the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns;</HI> and yet they lack nothing, <HI>yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye much bet∣ter than they?</HI> ye that are creatures capable of God? are ye not of more account in the eyes of God? of a higher rank in the scale of be∣ings? <HI>and which of you by taking thought, can
<PB N="267" REF="028060_0526_0FD68ED368274430"/>add one cubit to his stature?</HI> what profit have you then from this anxious thought? it is every way fruitless and unavailing.</P>
<P><HI>And why take ye thought for raiment?</HI> have ye not a daily reproof, wherever you turn your eyes? <HI>consider the lillies of the field how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin. And yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Wherefore if</HI> God <HI>so cloath the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven,</HI> is cut down, burnt up and seen no more, <HI>shall he not much more cloath you, O ye of little faith?</HI> you, whom he made to endure for ever and ever, to be pic∣tures of his own eternity! ye are indeed of little faith. Otherwise ye could not doubt of his love and care, no, not for a moment.</P>
<P N="19">19. <HI>Therefore take no thought, saying, what shall we eat,</HI> if we lay up no treasure upon earth? <HI>what shall we drink,</HI> if we serve God with all our strength, if our eye be singly fixed on him? <HI>wherewithal shall we be cloathed,</HI> if we are not conformed to the world, if we disoblige those by whom we might be profited? <HI>for after all these things do the gentiles seek,</HI> the heathens who know not God. But ye are sensible, <HI>your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</HI> And he hath pointed out to you an infallible way of being constantly supplied there∣with. <HI>Seek ye first the kingdom of</HI> God <HI>and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. <HI>Seek ye f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st the kingdom of</HI> God. Be∣fore ye give place to any other thought or care,
<PB N="268" REF="028060_0527_0FD68ED4E72335F8"/>let it be your concern, that the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who <HI>gave his only be∣gotten Son, to the end that believing in him, ye might not perish but have everlasting life,</HI> may reign in your heart, may manifest himself in your soul, and dwell and rule there: that he may <HI>cast down every high thing which exalteth itself against the knowledge of</HI> God, <HI>and bring into captivity eve∣ry thought to the abedience of</HI> Christ. Let God have the sole dominion over you. Let him reign without a rival. Let him possess all your heart, and rule alone. Let him be your one desire, your joy, your love: so that all that is within you may continually cry out, <HI>the</HI> Lord God <HI>om∣nipotent reigneth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Seek the kingdom of</HI> God <HI>and his righteousness.</HI> Righteousness is the fruit of God's reigning in the heart. And what is righteousness but love? the love of God and of all mankind, flowing from faith in Jesus Christ, and producing hum∣bleness of mind, meekness, gentleness, long-suf∣fering, patience, deadness to the world; and every right disposition of heart, toward God and toward man. And by these it produces all holy actions, whatsoever are lovely or of good report; whatsoever works of faith and labour of love are acceptable to God and profitable to man.</P>
<P><HI>His righteousness:</HI> this is all <HI>his</HI> righteousness still: it is his own free <HI>gift</HI> to us, for the sake of Jesus Christ the righteous, through whom alone it is purchased for us: and it is his work: it is he alone that worketh it in us, by the inspiration of his Holy Spirit.</P>
<P N="21"><PB N="269" REF="028060_0528_0FD68ED8D7873D38"/>
21. Perhaps the well observing this may give light to some other scriptures, which we have not always so clearly understood. St. <HI>Paul,</HI> speak∣ing in his epistle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> concerning the unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> saith, <HI>They being ignorant of</HI> God's <HI>righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submited them∣selves unto the righteousness of</HI> God. They were <HI>ignorant of</HI> God's <HI>righteousness,</HI> not only of the righteousness of <HI>Christ,</HI> imputed to every be∣liever, whereby all his sins are blotted out, and he is reconciled to the favour of God: But (which seems here to be more immediately un∣derstood) they were ignorant of that inward righteousness, of that holiness of heart, which is with the utmost propriety termed God's <HI>righteousness,</HI> as being borh his own free gift through <HI>Christ,</HI> and his own work, by his al∣mighty spirit. And because they were ignorant of this, they <HI>went about to establish their own righteousness.</HI> They laboured to establish that outside righteousness, which might very proper∣ly be termed <HI>their own.</HI> For neither was it wrought by the spirit of God, nor was it owned or accepted of him. They might work this them∣selves, by their own natural strength: and when they had done, it was a stink in his nostrils. And yet trusting in this, they would <HI>not submit themselves unto the righteousness</HI> of God. Yea, they hardened themselves against that faith whereby alone it was possible to attain it. <HI>For</HI> Christ <HI>is the end of the law, for righteousness, to every one that believeth. Christ,</HI> when he said, <HI>It is finished,</HI> put an end to that law, to the law of external rites and ceremonies, that he
<PB N="270" REF="028060_0529_0FD68EDA5A7CFD98"/>might <HI>bring in a better righteousness,</HI> thro' his blood, by that one oblation of himself once of∣fered, even the image of God, into the inmost soul of <HI>every one that believeth.</HI></P>
<P N="22">22. Nearly related to these are those words of the apostle, in his epistle to the <HI>Philippians. I count all things but dung that I may win</HI> Christ, an entrance into his everlasting king∣dom, <HI>and be found in him,</HI> believing in him, <HI>not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is thro' the faith of</HI> Christ, <HI>the righteousness which is of</HI> God <HI>by faith—Not having my own righteousness which is of the law;</HI> a barely external righteousness, the outside re∣ligion I formerly had, when I hoped to be ac∣cepted of God, because I was, <HI>touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless—But that which is through the faith of</HI> Christ, <HI>the righteousness which is of</HI> God <HI>by faith:</HI> That holiness of heart, that renewal of the soul, in all its desires, tempers, and affections, <HI>which is of</HI> God: It is the work of God and not of man, <HI>by faith;</HI> thro' the faith of <HI>Christ,</HI> thro' the revelation of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> in us and by faith in his blood; whereby alone we obtain the re∣mission of our sins, and an inheritance among those that are sanctified.</P>
<P N="23">23. <HI>Seek ye first</HI> this <HI>kingdom of</HI> God in your hearts, this <HI>righteousness,</HI> which is the gift and work of God, the image of God renewed in your souls: <HI>And all these things shall</HI> be ad∣ded unto you: all things needful for the body; such a measure of all, as God sees most for the advancement of his kingdom. These <HI>shall be added,</HI> they shall be thrown in, over and above.
<PB N="271" REF="028060_0530_0FD68EDD950A3EE8"/>In seeking the peace and the love of God, you shall not only find what you more immediately seek, even the kingdom that cannot be moved; but also what you seek not, not at all for us own sake, but only in reference to the other. You shall find in your way to the kingdom all outward things, so far as they are expedient for you: this care God hath taken upon himself: Cast you all your care upon him. He knoweth your wants; and whatsoever is lacking, he will not fail to supply.</P>
<P N="24">24. <HI>Therefore take no thought for the morrow.</HI> Not only, take ye no thought, how to lay up treasures on earth, how to increase in worldly substance; take no thought how to procure more food than you can eat, or more raiment than you can put on; or more money than is required from day to day, for the plain, rea∣sonable purposes of life: but take no uneasy thought even concerning those things which are absolutely needful for the body. Do not trouble yourself now, with thinking what you shall do, at a season which is yet afar off. Per∣haps that season will never come: or it will be no concern of yours: before then you will have passed through all the waves, and be landed in eternity. All those distant views do not belong to you, who are but a creature of a day. Nay, what have you to do with the <HI>morrow,</HI> more strictly speaking? Why should you perplex your∣self without need? God provides for you to∣day what is needful to sustain the life which he hath given you. It is enough: give yourself up into his hands: if you live another day, he will provide for that also.</P>
<P N="25"><PB N="272" REF="028060_0531_0FD68EE22438C420"/>
25. Above all, do not make the care of fu∣ture things, a pretence for neglecting present duty. This is the most fatal way of <HI>taking thought for the morrow.</HI> And how common is it among men? Many, if we exhort them to keep a conscience void of offence, to abstain from what they are convinced is evil, do not scru∣ple to reply, "How then must we live? Must we not take care of ourselves and of our families?" And this they imagine to be a sufficient reason, for continuing in known, wilful sin. They say, and perhaps think, they would serve God now; were it not that they should by and by lose their bread. They would prepare for eternity; but they are afraid of wanting the necessaries of life. So they serve the devil for a morsel of bread; they rush into hell, for fear of want; they throw away their poor souls, lest they should some time or other fall short of what is needful for their bodies.</P>
<P>It is not strange that they who thus take the matter out of God's hand, should be so often disappointed of the very things they seek; that while they throw away heaven, to secure the things of earth, they lose the one, but do not gain the other. The jealous God, in the wise course of his providence, frequently suffers this. So that they who will not cast their care on God, who taking thought for temporal things, have little concern for things eternal, lose the very portion which they have chosen. There is a visible blast on all their undertakings: Whatsoever they do, it doth not prosper. Inso∣much, that after they have forsaken God for the world, they lose what they sought, as well
<PB N="273" REF="028060_0532_0FD68EE417667A80"/>as what they sought not. They fall short of the kingdom of God and his righteousness; nor yet are other things added unto them.</P>
<P N="26">26. There is another way of <HI>taking thought for the morrow,</HI> which is equally forbidden in these words. It is possible to <HI>take thought</HI> in a wrong manner, even with regard to spiritual things; to be so careful about what may be by and by, as to neglect what is now required at our hands. How insensibly do we slide into this, if we are not continually watching unto prayer? how easily are we carried away, in a kind of waking dream, projecting distant schemes, and drawing fine scenes in our own imagination! we think, what good we will do, when we are in such a place, or when such a time is come! how useful we will be, how plenteous in good works, when we are easier in our circumstances? how earnestly we will serve God, when once such an hinderance is out of the way.</P>
<P>Or, perhaps, you are now in heaviness of soul: God, as it were, hides his face from you. You see little of the light of his countenance; you cannot taste his redeeming love. In such a temper of mind, how natural is it to say. "O how I will praise God, when the light of his countenance shall be again lifted up upon my soul? how will I exhort others to praise him, when his love is again shed abroad in my heart? then I will do thus and thus: I will speak for God in all places: I will not be ashamed of the gospel of Christ. Then I will redeem the time. I will use to the uttermost every talent I have received." Do not believe thyself. Thou wilt not do it then, unless thou dost it now. <HI>He
<PB N="274" REF="028060_0533_0FD68EE554ADEA30"/>that is faithful in that which is little,</HI> of whatso∣ever kind it be, whether it be worldly substance, or the fear or love of God, <HI>will be faithful in that which is much.</HI> But if thou now hidest one ta∣lent in the earth, thou wilt then hide five: that is, if ever they are given; but there is small rea∣son to expect they ever will. Indeed <HI>unto him that hath,</HI> that is, uses what he hath, <HI>shall be given, and he shall have more abundantly. But from him that hath not,</HI> that is, uses not the grace which he hath already received, whether in a larger or smaller degree, <HI>shall be taken away even that which he hath.</HI></P>
<P N="27">27. And <HI>take no thought</HI> for the temptations of to-morrow. This also is a dangerous snare. Think not, "When such a temptation comes, what shall I do, how shall I stand? I feel, I have not power to resist: I am not able to conquer that enemy." Most true: you have not now the power which you do not now stand in need of. You are not able at <HI>this time</HI> to conquer that enemy; and at <HI>this time</HI> he does not assault you. With the grace you have now, you could not withstand the temptations which you have not. But when the temptation comes, the grace will come. In greater trials you will have great∣er strength. When sufferings abound, the con∣solations of God will in the same proportion a∣bound also. So that in every situation, the grace of God will be sufficient for you. He doth not suffer you <HI>to be tempted</HI> to-day, <HI>above that ye are able to bear.</HI> And <HI>in every temptation he will make a way to escape.

<P N="1">1. OUR blessed Lord, having now finished his main design, having first, delivered the sum of true religion, carefully guarded against those glosses of men, whereby they would make the word of God of none effect: and having, next, laid down rules touching that right inten∣tion, which we are to preserve in all our outward actions: now proceeds to point out the main hin∣derances of this religion, and concludes all with a suitable application.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the fifth chapter our great teacher has fully described inward religion in its various branches. He has there laid before us those dis∣position,
<PB N="281" REF="028060_0538_0FD68EF16AE49740"/>of soul, which constitute real christia∣nity; the tempers contained in that holiness, <HI>without which no man shall see the Lord;</HI> the af∣fections, which when flowing from their proper fountain, from a living faith in God through Christ Jesus, are intrinsically and essentially good, and acceptable to God. In the sixth he has shewn, how all our actions likewise, even those that are indifferent in their own nature, may be made holy and good, and acceptable to God, by a pure and holy intention. Whatever is done without this, he declares is of no value with God: whereas whatever outward works are thus consecrated to God, are in his sight of great price.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the former part of this chapter he points out the most common and most fatal hinderances of this holiness. In the latter, he exhorts us by various motives, to break through all, and secure that prize of our high calling.</P>
<P N="4">4. The first hinderance he cautions us against is judging. <HI>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</HI> Judge not others, that ye be not judged of the Lord, that ye bring not vengeance on your own heads. <HI>For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged, and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again:</HI> a plain and equitable rule, whereby God permits you to determine for yourselves, in what manner he shall deal with you in the judgment of the great day.</P>
<P N="5">5. There is no station of life, nor any pe∣riod of time, from the hour of our first repent∣ing and believing the gospel, till we are made perfect in love, wherein this caution is not needful for every child of God. For occasions
<PB N="282" REF="028060_0539_0FD68EF2D5C93988"/>of judging can never be wanting. And the temptations to it are innumerable: many where∣of are so artfully disguised, that we fall into the sin, before we suspect any danger. And un∣speakable are the mischiefs produced hereby; always to him that judges another: thus wound∣ing his own soul, and exposing himself to the righteous judgment of God: and frequently to those who are judged, whose hands hang down, who are weakened and hindered in their course, if not wholly turned out of the way, and caused to draw back even to perdition. Yea, how often, when this <HI>root of bitterness springs up,</HI> are <HI>many defiled thereby:</HI> by reason whereof the way of truth itself is evil spoken of, and that worthy name blasphemed whereby we are called.</P>
<P N="6">6. Yet it does not appear, that our Lord de∣signed this caution, only or chiefly for the chil∣dren of God: but rather for the children of the world, for the men who know not God. These cannot but hear of those, who are not of the world, who sollow after the religion above-described: who endeavour to be humble, seri∣ous, gentle, merciful and pure in heart; who earnestly desire such measures of these holy tem∣pers, as they have not yet attained: and wait for them in doing all good to all men, and pa∣tiently suffering evil. Whoever go but thus f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, cannot be hid, no more than <HI>a city set upon a h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll.</HI> And why do not these, who see their <HI>good works, glorify their Father which is in heaven?</HI> what excuse have they, for not treading in their steps? for not imitating their example, and being followers of them, as they are also of
<PB N="283" REF="028060_0540_0FD68EF4FB473F48"/>Christ? why, in order to provide an excuse for themselves, they condemn those whom they ought to imitate. They spend their time in finding out their neighbour's faults, instead of amending their own. They are so busied about others go∣ing out of the way, that themselves never come into it at all: at least, never get forward, never go beyond a poor dead form of godliness without the power.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is to these more especially that our Lord says, <HI>Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy bro∣ther's eye,</HI> the infirmities, the mistakes, the im∣prudence, the weakness of the children of God; <HI>but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</HI> thou considerest not the damnable impeni∣tence, the fanatic pride, the accursed self-will, the idolatrous love of the world, which are in thyself, and which make thy whole life an abomination to the Lord. Above all, with what supine carelessness and indifference art thou dancing over the mouth of hell? and how then, with what grace, with what decency or mo∣desty, <HI>wilt thou say to thy brother, let me pull out the mote out of thine eye,</HI> the excess of zeal for God, the extreme self-denial, the too great dis∣engagement from worldly cares and employ∣ments, the desire to be day and night in prayer, or hearing the words of eternal life? <HI>and be∣hold a beam is in thine own eye!</HI> not a mote, like one of these. <HI>Thou hypocrite!</HI> who pretendest to care for others and hast no care for thy own soul! who maketh a show of zeal for the cause of God, when in truth thou neither lovest nor fearest him! <HI>first cast out the beam out of thine own eye.</HI> Cast out the beam of impenitence.
<PB N="284" REF="028060_0541_0FD68EF5CFDE1688"/>Know thyself. See and feel thyself a sinner. Feel, that thy inward parts are very wickedness, that thou art altogether corrupt and abominable, and that the wrath of God abideth on thee. Cast out the beam of pride. Abhor thyself. Sink down as in dust and ashes. Be more and more little and mean, and base and vile in thine own eyes. Cast out the beam of self-will. Learn what that meaneth, <HI>if any man will come after me, let him renounce himself.</HI> Deny thyself and take up thy cross daily. Let thy whole soul cry out, <HI>I came down from heaven</HI> (for so thou didst, thou never-dying spirit, whether thou knowest it or no) <HI>not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.</HI> Cast out the beam of love of the world. Love not the world, neither the things of the world. Be thou crucified unto the world, and the world crucified unto thee. Only use the world, but <HI>enjoy</HI> God. Seek all thy happiness in him. Above all, cast out the grand beam, that supine carelessness and indifference. Deeply con∣sider, that <HI>one thing is needful,</HI> the one thing which thou hast scarce ever thought of. Know and feel, that thou art a poor, vile, guilty worm, quivering over the great gulph! what art thou? a sinner born to die: a leaf driven before the wind: a vapour ready to vanish away: just appearing, and then scattered into air, to be no more seen! see this, <HI>and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.</HI> Then, if thou hast leisure from the concerns of thy own soul, thou shalt know how to correct thy brother also.</P>
<P N="8">8. But what is properly the meaning of this word, <HI>judge not?</HI> what is the <HI>judging</HI> which is
<PB N="285" REF="028060_0542_0FD68EFB893F85F0"/>here forbidden? it is not the same as evil-speak∣ing, although it is frequently joined therewith. Evil-speaking is, the relating any thing that is evil, concerning an absent person: whereas judg∣ing may indifferently refer, either to the absent or the present. Neither does it necessarily imply the speaking at all, but only the <HI>thinking evil</HI> of another. Not, that all kind of thinking evil of others, is that judging which our Lord con∣demns. If I see one commit robbery or murder, or hear him blaspheme the name of God, I can∣not refrain from thinking ill of the robber or murderer. Yet this is not evil judging: there is no sin in this, nor any thing contrary to tender affection.</P>
<P N="9">9. The thinking of another, in a manner that is contrary to love, is that judging which is here condemned, and this may be of various kinds. For, first, we may think another to blame when he is not. We may lay to his charge (at least in our own mind) the things of which he is not guil∣ty: the words which he has never spoke, or the actions which he has never done. Or we may think his manner of acting was wrong, although in reality it was not. And even where nothing can justly be blamed, either in the thing itself, or in the manner of doing it, we may suppose, his intention was not good, and so condemn him on that ground; at the same time that he who searches the heart, sees his simplicity and godly sincerity.</P>
<P N="10">10. But we may not only fall into the sin of judging, by condemning the innocent, but also, secondly, by condemning the guilty, in a higher degree than he deserves. This species of judg∣ing
<PB N="286" REF="028060_0543_0FD68EFCA4833E88"/>is likewise an offence against justice as well as mercy: and yet such an offence as nothing can secure us from, but the strongest and tenderest affection. Without this, we readily suppose one who is acknowledged to be in fault, to be more in fault than he really is. We undervalue whatever good is found in him. Nay, we are not easily in∣duced to believe, that any thing good can remain in him, in whom we have found any thing that is evil.</P>
<P N="11">11. All this shews a manifest want of that love, which <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Thinketh no evil:</HI> which never draws an unjust or unkind conclu∣sion, from any premises whatsoever. Love will not infer, from a person's falling once into an act of open sin, that he is accustomed so to do, that he is habitually guilty of it. And if he was habitu∣ally guilty once, love does not conclude, he is so still: much less, that if he is now guilty of this, there∣fore he is guilty of other sins also. These evil reasonings all pertain to that sinful judging, which our Lord here guards us against: and which we are in the highest degree concerned to avoid, if we love either God or our own souls.</P>
<P N="12">12. But supposing we do not condemn the in∣nocent, neither the guilty any farther than they deserve: still we may not be altogether clear of the snare. For there is a third sort of sinful judging, which is the condemning any person at all where there is not a sufficient evidence. And be the facts we suppose ever so true, yet that does not acquit us. For they ought not to have been supposed but proved, and till they were, we ought to have formed no judgment, I say, till
<PB N="287" REF="028060_0544_0FD68EFE6B39A0C8"/>they were: for neither are we excused, although the facts admit of ever so strong proof, unless that proof be produced before we pass sentence, and compared with the evidence on the other side. Nor can we be excused, if ever we pass a full sentence, before the accused has spoken for himself. Even a jew might teach us this, as a mere lesson of justice abstracted from mercy and brotherly love. <HI>Doth our law,</HI> says Nicodemus, <HI>Judge any man before it hear him and know what he doth? John.</HI> xvii. 51. Yea, a heathen could reply, when the chief of the jewish nation de∣sired to have judgment against his prisoner, <HI>it is not the manner of the Romans to</HI> judge <HI>any man before he that is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself, concerning the crime laid against him.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. Indeed we could not easily fall into sinful <HI>judging,</HI> were we only to observe that rule, which<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Seneca.</NOTE> another of those heathen <HI>Romans</HI> affirms to have been the measure of his own practice. "I am so far, says he, from lightly believing every man's, or any man's evidence against another, that I do not easily or immediately be∣lieve a man's evidence against himself. I always allow him second thoughts, and many times council too." Go thou who art called a chris∣tian, and do likewise, lest the heathen rise and condemn thee in that day.</P>
<P N="14">14. But how rarely should we condemn or judge one another, at least, how soon would that evil be remedied, were we to walk by that clear and express rule, which our Lord himself has taught us? <HI>If thy brother shall trespass against thee</HI>
<PB N="288" REF="028060_0545_0FD68F0083CD6B50"/>(or if thou hear, or believe that he hath) <HI>go and tell him of his fault, between him and thee alone.</HI> This is the first step thou art to take. <HI>But if he will not hear, take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word may be established.</HI> This is the second step. <HI>If he neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church;</HI> either to the overseers thereof, or to the whole congregation. Thou hast then done thy part. Then think of it no more, but commend the whole to God.</P>
<P N="15">15. But supposing thou hast, by the grace of God, <HI>cast the beam out of thine own eye,</HI> and dost now <HI>clearly see the mote or beam which is in thy brother's eye,</HI> yet beware thou dost not receive hurt thyself, by endeavouring to help him Still <HI>give not that which is holy unto dogs.</HI> Do not lightly account any to be of this num∣ber. But if it evidently appear, that they de∣serve the title, then cast ye not your <HI>pearls be∣fore swine.</HI> Beware of that zeal which is not according to knowledge. For this is another great hinderance in their way who would be <HI>perfect as</HI> their <HI>heavenly Father is perfect.</HI> They who desire this, cannot but desire that all man∣kind should partake of the common blessing. And when we ourselves first partake of the heavenly gift, the divine <HI>evidence of things not seen,</HI> we wonder, that all mankind do not see, the things which we see so plainly, and make no doubt at all but we shall open the eyes of all we have any intercourse with. Hence we are for attacking all we meet without delay, and constraining them to see, whether they will or no. And by the ill success of this intemperate zeal, we often
<PB N="289" REF="028060_0546_0FD68F048312BE40"/>suffer in our own souls. To prevent this spend∣ing our strength in vain, our Lord adds this needful caution (needful to all, but more especi∣ally to those who are now warm in their first love:) <HI>give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine: lest they trample them under foot, and turn again and rent you.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. <HI>Give not that which is holy unto the dogs.</HI> Be∣ware of thinking, that any deserve this appella∣tion, till there is full and incontestable proof, such as you can no longer resist. But when it is clearly and indisputably proved, that they are un∣holy and wicked men, not only strangers to, but enemies to God, to all righteousness and true ho∣liness; <HI>Give not that which is holy,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the holy thing, emphatically so called, unto these. The holy, the peculiar doctrines of the gospel, such as were <HI>hid from the ages and generations</HI> of old, and are now made known to us, only by the revelation of Jesus Christ, and the inspiration of his holy spirit; are not to be prostituted unto these men, who know not if there be any Holy Ghost. Not indeed that the ambassadors of Christ can re∣frain, from declaring them in the great congre∣gation, wherein some of these may probably be. We must speak, whether men will hear or whe∣ther they will forbear. But this is not the case with private christians. They do not bear that awful character; nor are they under any man∣ner of obligation, to force these great and glori∣ous truths, on them who contradict and blas∣pheme, who have a rooted enmity against them. Nay, they ought not so to do, but rather to lead
<PB N="290" REF="028060_0547_0FD68F07D561A200"/>them, as they are able to bear. Do not begin a discourse with these, upon remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. But talk with them in their own manner, and upon their own princi∣ples. With the rational, honourable, unjust epi∣cure, <HI>reason of righteousness, temperance, and judg∣ment to come.</HI> This is the most probable way to make Felix <HI>tremble.</HI> Reserve higher subjects for men of higher attainments.</P>
<P N="17">17. <HI>Neither cast ye your pearls before swine.</HI> Be very unwilling to pass this judgment on any man. But if the fact be plain and undeniable, If it is clear, beyond all dispute, if the swine do not endeavour to disguise themselves, but rather glory in their shame, making no preter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to pu∣rity either of heart or life, but working all un∣cleanness with greediness: then <HI>cast</HI> not <HI>ye your pearls before them.</HI> Talk not to them of the my∣steries of the kingdom: of the things which <HI>eye hath not seen, nor car heard;</HI> which of conse∣quence, as they have no other inlets of know∣ledge, no spiritual senses, it cannot enter into their hearts to conceive. Tell not them of the <HI>exceeding great and precious promises,</HI> which God hath given us, in the Son of his love. What conception can they have, of being <HI>made parta∣kers of the divine nature,</HI> who do not even desire to <HI>escape the corruption that is in the world thro' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t?</HI> just as much knowledge as swine have of pearls, and as much relish as they have for them, so much relish have they for the deep things of God, so much knowledge of the mysteries of the gospel, who are immersed in the mire of this world, in worldly pleasures, desires and cares. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s not</HI> those <HI>pearls before</HI> these, <HI>lest they trample
<PB N="291" REF="028060_0548_0FD68F0951C78380"/>them under their feet,</HI> lest they utterly despise what they cannot understand, and speak evil of the things which they know not. Nay, it is pro∣bable, this would not be the only inconvenience which would follow. It would not be strange, if they were, according to their nature, to <HI>turn again, and rent you:</HI> if they were to return you evil for good, cursing for blessing, and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed for your good-will. Such is the enmity of the car∣nal mind, against God and all the things of God. Such the treatment you are to expect from these, if you offer them the unpardonable affront, of endeavouring to save their souls from death, to pluck them as brands out of the burning!</P>
<P N="18">18. And yet you need not utterly despair even of these, who for the present <HI>turn again and rent you.</HI> For if all your arguments and persuasives fail, there is yet another remedy left; and one that is frequently found effectual, when no other method avails. This is prayer. Therefore what∣ever you desire or want, either for others or for your own soul, <HI>ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and ye shall find: kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck, and it shall be open∣ed unto you.</HI> The neglect of this is a third grand hinderance of holiness. Still we have not, <HI>be∣cause we ask not.</HI> O how meek and gentle, how lowly in heart, how full of love both to God and man, might ye have been at this day, if you had only asked? if you had <HI>continued instant in prayer!</HI> therefore now, at least, <HI>ask, and it shall be given unto you. Ask,</HI> that ye may throughly experience and perfectly practise the whole of that religion, which our Lord has here so beatifully described. <HI>It shall then be
<PB N="292" REF="028060_0549_0FD68F0B97B66F40"/>given you,</HI> to be holy as he is holy, both in heart and in all manner of conversation. <HI>Seek,</HI> in the way he hath ordained, in searching the scriptures, in hearing his word, in meditating thereon, in fasting, in partaking of the supper of the Lord, and surely <HI>ye shall find.</HI> Ye shall find that pearl of great price, that faith which overcometh the world, that peace which the world cannot give, that love which is the earnest of your inheri∣tance. <HI>Knock:</HI> continue in prayer, and in every other way of the Lord. Be not weary or faint in your mind. Press on to the mark. Take no denial. Let him not go until he bless you. And the door of mercy, of holiness, of heaven <HI>shall be opened unto you.</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. It is in compassion to the hardness of our hearts, so unready to believe the goodness of God, that our Lord is pleased to enlarge upon this head, and to repeat and confirm what he hath spoken. <HI>For every one,</HI> saith he, <HI>that asketh, receiveth:</HI> so that none need come short of the blessing: <HI>and he that seeketh,</HI> even every one that seeketh, <HI>findeth,</HI> the love and the image of God: <HI>and to him that knocketh,</HI> to every one that knock∣eth, the gate of righteousness shall be opened. So that here is no room for any to be discouraged, as though they might ask or seek or knock in vain. Only remember, <HI>always to pray,</HI> to seek, to knock <HI>and not to be faint</HI> And then the promise stand∣eth sure. It is firm as the pillars of heaven. Yea, more firm; for heaven and earth shall pass away, but his word shall not pass away.</P>
<P N="20">20. To cut off every pretence for unbelief, our blessed Lord, in the following verses, il∣lustrates
<PB N="293" REF="028060_0550_0FD68F0B9DE1EED0"/>yet farther what he had said, by an ap∣peal to what passes in our own breasts. <HI>What man,</HI> saith he, <HI>is there of</HI> you, <HI>who, if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?</HI> will even na∣tural affection permit you to refuse the reasonable request of one you love? <HI>or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?</HI> will he give him hurtful, instead of profitable things? so that even from what you feel and do yourselves, you may receive the fullest assurance, as, on the one hand, that no ill effect can possibly attend your asking, so on the other, that it will be attended with that good effect, a full supply of all your wants. For <HI>if ye being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven,</HI> who is pure, unmixed, essential good∣ness, <HI>give good things to them that ask him?</HI> or, (as he expresses it on another occasion) <HI>give the Holy Ghost to them that ask him?</HI> In him are in∣cluded all good things; all wisdom, peace, joy, love: the whole treasure of holiness and happi∣ness: all that God hath prepared for them that love him.</P>
<P N="21">21. But that your prayer may have its full weight with God, see that ye be in charity with all men. For otherwise, it is more likely to bring a curse than a blessing on your own head: nor can you expect, to receive any blessing from God, while you have not charity towards your neigh∣bour. Therefore let this hinderance be removed without delay. Confirm your love towards one another and towards all men. And love them, not in word only, but in deed and in truth. <HI>Therefore all things whatsoever ye would, that
<PB N="294" REF="028060_0551_0FD68F0DB047D530"/>men should do to you, do ye even so unto them: for this is the have and the prophets.</HI></P>
<P N="22">22. This is that royal law, that golden rule of mercy as well as justice, which even the heathen emperor caused to be written over the gate of his palace: a rule, which many believe to be na∣turally engraved on the mind of every one that comes into the world. And thus much is certain, that it commends itself, as soon as heard, to every man's conscience and understanding: insomuch that no man can knowingly offend against it, without carrying his condemnation in his own breast.</P>
<P N="23">23. <HI>This is the law and the prophets.</HI> What∣soever is written in that law which God of old revealed to mankind; and whatsoever precepts God has given by <HI>his holy prophets, which have been since the world began,</HI> they are all summed up in these few words, they are all contained in this short direction. And this rightly understood comprizes the whole of that religion, which our Lord came to establish upon earth.</P>
<P N="24">24. It may be understood, either in a posi∣tive or negative sense. If understood in a ne∣gative sense, the meaning is, "Whatever ye would not that men should do to you, do not ye unto them." Here is a plain rule, always ready at hand, always easy to be applied. In all cases relating to your neighbour, make this case your own. Suppose the circumstances to be changed, and yourself to be just as he is now. And then beware that you indulge no temper or thought, that no word pass out of your lips, that you take no stop which you should have condemned
<PB N="295" REF="028060_0552_0FD68F0E942954C8"/>in him, upon such a change of circumstances. If understood in a direct and positive sense, the plain meaning of it is, "Whatsoever you could reasonably desire of him, supposing yourself to be in his circumstance, that do, to the uttermost of your power, to every child of man."</P>
<P N="25">25. To apply this in one or two obvious instan∣ces. It is clear to every man's own conscience, we would not that others should <HI>judge</HI> us, should causelessly or lightly think evil of us. Much less would we that any should speak evil of us, should publish our real faults or infirmities. Apply this to yourself. Do not unto another what you would not he should do unto you; and you will never more <HI>judge</HI> your neighbour, never causelessly or lightly think evil of any one. Much less will you speak evil: You will never mention even the real fault of an absent person, unless so far as you are convinced, it is absolutely needful, for the good of other souls.</P>
<P N="26">26. Again: We would that all men should love and esteem us, and behave towards us, ac∣cording to justice, mercy and truth. And we may reasonably desire, that they should do us all the good they can do, without injuring them∣selves: Yea, that in outward things (accord∣ing to the known rule) their superfluities should give way to our conveniencies, their convenien∣cies to our necessities, and their necessities to our extremities. Now then let us walk by the same rule: Let us do unto all, as we would they should do to us. Let us love and honour all men. Let justice, mercy and truth govern all our minds and actions. Let our superfluities give way to our neighbour's conveniencies: (and who then will
<PB N="296" REF="028060_0553_0FD68F106E4D7C30"/>have any superfluities left?) Our conveniencies to our neighbour's necessities, our necessities to his extremities.</P>
<P N="27">27. This is pure and genuine morality. This do and thou shalt live. <HI>As many as walk by this rule, peace be to them, and mercy:</HI> for they are the <HI>Israel of</HI> God. But then be it observed, none can walk by this rule (nor ever did from the beginning of the world) none can love his neighbour as himself, unless he first love God. And none can love God, unless he believe in Christ, unless he have redemption thro' his blood, and the spirit of God bearing witness with his spirit, that he is a child of God. Faith therefore is still the root of all, of present as well as future salvation. Still we must say to every sinner, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved. Thou shalt be saved now, that thou mayst be saved for ever; saved on earth, that thou mayst be saved in heaven Believe in him and thy faith will work by love. Thou wilt love the Lord thy God, because he hath loved thee: Thou wilt love thy neighbour as thyself. And then it will be thy glory and joy, to exert and increase this love, not barely by abstaining from what is contrary thereto, from every unkind thought, word and action, but by shewing all that kindness to every man, which thou wouldst he should shew unto thee.</P>
