<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>PLYMOUTH controversy hath made a great noise in the country: It hath been of long standing, and very various have been the reports about it: That peo∣ple might have right conceptions of the matter, I published my Essays. They have now met with an answer; whether it be full and sufficient, must be left to the world to judge. What <HI>assistance</HI> Mr. <HI>R.</HI> had in the affair, I am not able with precision to determine; but there are evident traces of <HI>another hand</HI> in several parts of his reply; the natural effect of his <HI>famous journey by night.</HI> But whoever was concerned, since he is pleased to <HI>father</HI> the whole, I shall treat it as his general offspring. It has been <HI>long</HI> a preparing; the reason of this delay I know not: Word was given out in mid-winter (after a certain <HI>packet</HI> was received) that it would soon be ready; but it ap∣peared not upon the stage, till late in the spring. One would naturally think, that after so long a time it would come forth more perfect, and be a thorough answer to every thing that I had alledged: But this is not the case; several things of great
<PB N="6" REF="012739_0004_0F8BEA86B9635478"/>importance are left almost wholly unno∣ticed, and sentences and scraps of senten∣ces are picked out here and there, and man∣gled at a strange rate, and the misrepre∣sentations are innumerable: A method of proceedure tending to bewilder the reader, and perpetuate the controversy: Instead of throwing light, it only throws darkness on the subject. It may perhaps gain the applause of the vulgar (for whom it seems especially calculated) and raise their indig∣nation against me; but men of learning and penetration will easily see, that the merits of the cause are not touched.</P>
<P>The cause indeed, that he is pleading, looks with a good face: The purity of churches, keeping out unregenerates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are sounds pleasing and captivating to <HI>serious souls,</HI> and they will be ready to rise in arms against any one whom he represents as mak∣ing the church (which is an <HI>inclosed garden</HI>) a meer common, or a cage for every un∣clean and hateful bird. By the like sounds, the <HI>separates</HI> insnared many zealous and god∣ly people in the late day, and gained great advantages against the established churches. And will he tread in their steps? For my part I am as much for a <HI>godly discipline</HI> as he (which is much wanted;) but at the same time am for allowing all privileges
<PB N="7" REF="012739_0005_0F8BEA87F9485E20"/>to <HI>"proper members"</HI> of the church when∣ever asked for, if they are not guilty of <HI>censurable evil.</HI> And as for <HI>practice,</HI> is he more <HI>strict</HI> than his brethren? BE IT KNOWN UNTO ALL MEN, that Mr <HI>R.</HI> hath been, ever since his settlement, as large in his admissi∣ons or in his <HI>practical charity</HI> as I could desire or any minister I know, and perhaps larg∣er in some instances than I should have been. And <HI>even now</HI> I have reason to think, that he would exclude none that should apply (if they would come to full communion) whom Mr. <HI>Stoddard</HI> would have received. At least it is evident from his <HI>piece</HI> (as well as practice) that he would receive them at <HI>second hand,</HI> if any such should remove into his parish, or be occasionally present on communion days; and that he is even will∣ing to hold communion in all other ways, with such churches as are built on Mr. <HI>Stoddard</HI>'s plan; (see <HI>p.</HI> 63.) which is a much greater <HI>inconsistency</HI> than any he endeavors to fasten on me.</P>
<P>Having mentioned <HI>discipline,</HI> let me drop a tear that it is so much neglected. It is lamentable to think, that the church-mem∣bership of children is looked upon as such a little thing; they seem to be left by the church as lambs in a large pasture; little or no care is taken of them; all proper
<PB N="8" REF="012739_0006_0F8BEA8897721EF8"/>restraint seems almost at an end. And even when such are spoken of by others, they are treated as no part of the church; or if as really <HI>without,</HI> and communicants <HI>only</HI> were members. Hence how frequent the lan∣guage, "such a one was admitted into the church at such a time; such a one is not a member, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" when in reality they were <HI>complete members</HI> before. This <HI>by custom</HI> is so riveted in the minds of many, that they cannot get rid of the notion; hence natu∣rally arise prejudices against the practice we are pleading for, as if it was a prostitution of ordinances to those that <HI>do not belong to the church.</HI> But this is not the case in other churches at a distance, neither was it so with us from the beginning. Our fathers always treated <HI>baptized persons</HI> as <HI>members,</HI> as I have noted in the Essays, and exercised discipline over them as much as over communicants. And why is it not so at this day? Surely, if primitive discipline were revived and kept up with rigor, and ministers would duly discharge their duty in training up the <HI>bap∣tizati</HI> for the Lord's-table (as the two Mr. <HI>Henrys,</HI> Mr. <HI>Havel</HI> and others have done) there would soon be little occasion for the present controversy.</P>
<P>It is further matter of grief and lamen∣tation, that there are so few <HI>proper subjects</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="012739_0007_0F8BEA8FB450F5A8"/>of discipline; I mean that there are such an amazing number of <HI>unbaptized persons</HI> among us. For (surprizing to tell) it is affirmed by some who best know the circumstances of the town, that there are at least <HI>two thirds,</HI> if not <HI>three quarters,</HI> of the children in this place, who remain unbaptized. And is this a <HI>proper season</HI> to lay still <HI>further restricti∣ons</HI> on the ordinance of baptism? What shall we then come to (according to an ordinary course of providence) at last? In what situation will the next generation be? And what is as surprizing to tell, I never heard <HI>one whole sermon</HI> since my return to the town, reproving this neglect: But it has only been touched upon two or three times in some transient expressions, and blended with other particulars. The most that he ever said on this head was in those sermons he mentioned <HI>p.</HI> 2. and then he stood upon it but a few minutes: His strength being chiefly exhausted on the head of <HI>qualifications;</HI> and <HI>coming without gracious sincerity,</HI> appeared in a much more awful light, than <HI>not coming at all</HI> (direct∣ly contrary to <HI>Gen.</HI> xvii. 14.) In other places, I think all over <HI>Christendom,</HI> it is com∣mon to compute the number of inhabi∣tants, by the number of <HI>christenings:</HI> From
<PB N="10" REF="012739_0008_0F8BEA8FE15C8318"/>whence we may infer what their general practice is. But if such computation should be made in the public prints respecting us by the <HI>number of christenings,</HI> we should ap∣pear a place diminutive indeed (though the first in <HI>New-England</HI>) and hardly wor∣thy of the least public notice.</P>
<P>But not to inlarge further. I shall close this preface with observing a few things relative both to his and my reply.</P>
<P>As to <HI>his</HI>—The reader cannot but take notice how he, every where, both in his let∣ters and book, links in the brethern with him. He seems only to stand forth in their behalf and to plead their cause, and speaks of himself as but one of many who were dissatisfied with the practice; withal in∣sinuating, that all the strokes I had against him were aqually leveled against them. This method he takes (out of policy) to ingratiate himself, and to fasten them the more to him. Whereas in fact "it is he <HI>alone,</HI> that is the source and spring of all; and if he should once cease his opposition, I doubt not the rest would do so too: If he should tell them (as <HI>Roger Williams</HI> did his hear∣ers,) "that he had misled them, that he was now convinced that he was in an er∣ror, and that prayer and study had brought
<PB N="11" REF="012739_0009_0F8BEA90CC156A10"/>him to be of another mind." There is not a man of them, I believe, but would acqui∣esce, and be intirely easy with the conti∣nuance of the practice. I would further notice his frequent phrase, <HI>my scheme, my plan,</HI> &amp;c. as if I was singular in my opini∣on, and differed from all the world besides. Whereas in <HI>the main</HI> I agree with my <HI>fa∣thers</HI> and brethren in the point: But we, enjoying <HI>their</HI> light and standing on their shoulders, may possibly make some im∣provement of things they did but just glance at: As Dr. <HI>B.</HI> and Mr. <HI>H.</HI> have made great improvements of some casual hints thrown out by Mr. <HI>Edwards.</HI></P>
<P>And now in regard of the <HI>answer</HI> here exhibited, I have compleated it, without taking a journey by night. And I have <HI>presumed</HI> to make it, although some of his chief men have given out, that his piece was "decisive and unanswerable;" and although he himself hath said, "that <HI>Ply∣mouth</HI> controversy, he believed, would "be a means of banishing the half-way practice out of this part of the country;" as much as to say, that <HI>his book</HI> would produce this marvellous effect. Whether it will or no, time must discover: But there seems lit∣tle prospect of it at present; for I have
<PB N="12" REF="012739_0010_0F8BEA9140004650"/>heard it observed by several, that in less than a week after his books came up, they seemed to be as <HI>dead</HI> almost as if they ne∣ver had a being; no exultations, no triumphs, no congratulations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were heard of, and indeed but little discourse about them. So that it seemed to some almost unnecessary to make a reply: But upon several accounts, it appears to me (as well as to others) absolutely necessary: And the reader will perhaps be of the same mind, before he has done.</P>
<P>But to come to what I more particular∣ly intended to observe.</P>
<P>In regard of the <HI>general controversy,</HI> I de∣sire it may be remembred, that all my pleas go upon this supposition, that there will be unregenerate persons in the church: And the same supposition must be made upon his plan, or any plan whatsoever. According to the standard Christ gives his church, they <HI>cannot be kept out:</HI> And if they are in already, they <HI>must not be cast out,</HI> with∣out plain proofs of their unregeneracy. should this be the case of any, they must be left to God and <HI>their own conscience.</HI> In the mean time, the church ought to treat them as regu∣lar members, and grant them the privileges they ask for: And if they (or the pastor
<PB N="13" REF="012739_0011_0F8BEA921F25F020"/>alone) upon conjectures and suspicions go about to exclude them, they act an un∣warrantable part, such privileges being their <HI>proper birth-right</HI> by <HI>divine grant,</HI> till such time as an absolute forfeiture be made, and full conviction takes place. And this I desire may be kept in mind.</P>
<P>And with respect to the <HI>particular con∣troversy</HI>—I am really grieved, that I am ob∣liged to continue it. Mr. <HI>R.</HI> might have prevented it with three or four words speaking. But he was too <HI>haughty</HI> and <HI>grand</HI> to make the least concession. And he must take the consequence. I am sure I take no delight in exposing him: But a regard to truth, my own reputation, and even the interest of religion obliged me to clear myself of his aspersions: I say, the <HI>interest of religion.</HI> For who will regard any thing I advance in the general controversy, if they think me such a man as Mr. <HI>R.</HI> represents me to be? I am astonished, that he should take the liberties he has done; that he should give such scope to misrepresentation and abuse, when he could not but know how easily he might be detected: But I suppose he thought, that either his <HI>great name</HI> or <HI>popularity,</HI> would bear down all be∣fore it, or that I should be uncapable of
<PB N="14" REF="012739_0012_0F8BEA9467DE5C20"/>answering the <HI>argumentative part</HI> of his book: And if so, that it would be an idle attempt for me ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely to endeavor to rescue my name from personal invective or abuse; and of consequence must necessarily bear the load for ever. But perhaps in both, or either, he will find himself disappointed. In the following reply, I have endeavored to treat him with moderation and temper, and to avoid personal reflections and re∣criminations as much as possible: How∣ever, the charges he hath brought against me (many of them unnecessarily, merely to load me with obloquy and reproach, with∣out the least advantage to his cause,) ren∣der it necessary for me sometimes to touch on that string, though in very gentle de∣grees, considering the occasion. He ob∣serves in his preface, <Q>That his people judged it needful for him to vindicate himself from the unkind aspersions I had cast upon him, least his character and use∣fulness should be hurt among strangers.</Q> But if what I have heard be true, this was <HI>judged needful</HI> merely by a <HI>junto</HI> of them, and that the <HI>major part</HI> were rather against his writing, and would have been glad if he had forbore, lest it should make matters <HI>more desparate</HI> than ever; as appears now to
<PB N="15" REF="012739_0013_0F8BEA95159C93D8"/>be really the case; for he hath managed in such a manner, as to render a reply abso∣lutely <HI>needful,</HI> least those who are "unac∣quainted with affairs in this place" be mis∣led by wrong and ungrounded accounts and misrepresentations. This is not only my opinion, but the opinion of many others, even of some that Mr. <HI>R.</HI> reckons among the number of his <HI>friends.</HI></P>
<P>I leave the whole to the readers animad∣version, begging them to weigh matters in an impartial ballance (even the ballance of the sanctuary) and not be swayed by per∣sonal regard either on the one side or the other. And may the God of truth lead us into all truth. <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN ANSWER TO Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI>'s REPLY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is a true but melancholy observation, that the ordinance of the supper, which is an ordinance of peace and love, has been the occasion of more feuds and ani∣mosities in the christian world, than almost any other thing whatever. The contentions about the ordinance of baptism have neither been so frequent nor long continued; I find little traces of them till something above 200 years ago, when the sect of the <HI>anabaptists</HI> arose in <HI>Germany.</HI> Since which time, the <HI>poedo-baptist</HI> controversy hath subsisted, and a small number have ever appeared in opposition; but other controversies in relation to baptism have been rare. The controversy in which we are at present engaged, seems to be unknown in other parts of <HI>Christendom;</HI> it scarce reaches beyond the confines of <HI>New-England.</HI> Other churches seem agreed to allow church-privileges to members bap∣tized whenever asked for, if of sober and regular lives; and the generality of our churches have long been in the same sentiments. But of late there seems to be a disposition in many to lay a restricti∣on on such members, and to exclude them from <HI>any</HI> privilege without they see their way clear to ask for <HI>every one; all</HI> or <HI>none</HI> are the terms insisted on. Whether this be right or not is the present question?</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="012739_0015_0F8BEA9676D8B1F8"/>
It would surely be happy, a thing very desirable, if all in visible covenant were fully disposed to dis∣charge every duty of the covenant, if they had ge∣nerally such a heart in them as to give up them∣selves and their's intirely to God, not only in pri∣vate, but also publicly, and to walk in all the com∣mandments and or finances of the Lord blameless, and so to have all occasion of dispute removed out of the way. But since this cannot be expected in this imperfect state, since there are such different degrees of knowledge and grace, and all professors do not see their duty in the same point of light, or have not equal capacity to discern what is duty in their present circumstances, and what is not, it would not surely be amiss to grant some indulgence to scrupulous tender consciences, and to allow them to go on in the path of duty as far as their present light leads them, without strictly obliging them to that, from which doubts and fears keep them off, hoping and praying, that God would in his own time and way scatter their doubts and dissipate their fears, and give them such a sense of their du∣ty and clearness of evidence, as would embolden their access in full with comfort and joy. Whe∣ther such indulgence or connivance be warrant∣able or not is the point in debate. Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> holds the negative. I the affirmative.</P>
<P>In discussing the subject, for the more clearness I propose this method.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. I shall make some general observations on the state of the controversy, with remarks on Mr. <HI>Rob∣bins</HI>'s manner of managing it, and the arguments he makes use of in support of his opinion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Take particular notice of some of his main objections, especially those contained in the first part of his reply.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Consider his manner of treating me both in relation to the general and particular controversy. Under which I shall endeavor to obviate the ob∣jections more particularly levelled against my principles and conduct in the latter part of his book.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>To make the way more plain,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="19" REF="012739_0016_0F8BEA978F008F98"/>
1. I shall begin with OBSERVATIONS. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the</P>
<P N="1">1st. Thing I shall observe is, That the dispute between us is not whether unregenerate persons ought to be <HI>knowingly</HI> admitted, but what <HI>evidence of regeneration</HI> the church ought to act upon. Since it will be the necessary consequence of any plan whatsoever, that many unregenerate will in fact be admitted not only to own the covenant, but also to full communion; I interspersed a passage here and there to abate Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s <HI>horrors</HI> at the very thoughts of an unregenerate person's coming. And now instead of making such use of the passages as I intended, he carefully culls them out to prove that I hold, the church ought knowingly to ad∣mit unregenerates, or that baptized persons have a right to church-privileges, let their lives and be∣havior be what they will. Whether <Q>this be fair or manly let the world judge.</Q> I say with him, if the church can certainly prove unregeneracy upon any (which must be done by the life and con∣versation) let them be excluded from any privilege although baptized. But what is to be done with those against whom no such proof can be exhibit∣ed? Of whom the church knows nothing amiss, whose lives are inoffensive. <HI>&amp;c?</HI> How must these be treated in case they apply for church privileges? This is the question.—Here I asserted, that such <HI>ne∣gative</HI> evidence was sufficient with respect to those already in covenant; that nothing further was re∣quired of communicants; why then of other mem∣bers? That if the church went further, they must necessarily run into the plan of the separates, who are for purging the church, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Mr. <HI>R.</HI> spurns at all this; but how does he disprove it? I find no∣thing but his bare affirmation. "Negative evi∣dence, says he, is no evidence at all." "Here is a negation or want of that, which is a proper ground of charity in this case." And again, "A baptized person's being free from open known sin is no pro∣per evidence that he is a <HI>saint;</HI> or upon which, the scriptures will warrant such a presumption of it, as will make it <HI>LAWFUL</HI> for us to treat him as such." <HI>p.</HI> 59. But pray what right has he or any
<PB N="20" REF="012739_0017_0F8BEA980D8D6FC8"/>of his party to call his fellow-members unregene∣rate, or to treat them as unregenerates, if they know nothing amiss in them, if inoffensive in their lives? Every baptized person has a right to be treated as a christian, if their general conduct be not inconsistent with christianity. The church ought in duty to suppose every member to be re∣generated, till they prove themselves to be other∣wise; or in other words, the church have no right to suppose any of their body unconverted, till it appears by their conversation. This is a christian law or rule. Dr. <HI>C. Mather</HI> says, <Q>Many baptized in infancy, when grown up do prove by their apostacies that they are not real saints. A judg∣ment of <HI>rational charity</HI> may be left for others. And it is a rule to be kept in the proceedings of the church, <HI>I am to judge as charitably of the infant as of the parent</HI> (that the grace of God is in their souls) <HI>until there appear a reason to the contrary.</HI></Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>R.</HI> indeed seems to have found out a reason to the contrary, that such are guilty of <HI>"habitual wicked∣ness"</HI> in not coming to the Lord's table, p. <HI>57.</HI> But yet in other places he says the direct reverse. Concerning this I shall speak elsewhere.</NOTE> (<HI>C. M.</HI> in∣fant bapt. <HI>p.</HI> 18)</P>
<P>If there be any weight in this sort of reasoning, then surely baptized persons of regular conversa∣tions cannot justly be excluded from owning the covenant, and bringing their children, whenever they desire it; they have a right to demand it as members, and none have a right to deny them.</P>
<P>As for those <HI>without,</HI> if they apply, something more <HI>positive</HI> is necessary; and Mr. <HI>R.</HI> greatly in∣jures me by suggesting that I hold negative evidences are sufficient in both cases, or that bap∣tized and unbaptized persons were to be received on equal terms (see <HI>p.</HI> 6.7.). Surely more strictness is necessary in receiving <HI>heathens</HI> than <HI>christians,</HI> or those that are already members; or in other words, there is more necessary to intitle a person to <HI>ad∣mission,</HI> than to a <HI>continuation</HI> of membership: And I think him much out of the way in every where
<PB N="21" REF="012739_0018_0F8BEA9DBB2D3B20"/>putting these two different sorts upon a par, un∣less he held that baptized persons were no pro∣per members."</P>
<P>This makes way for a</P>
<P N="2">2d. OBSERVATION, That I did not particularly treat the subject as a case of conscience, what the candidates ought to do, but what the church's du∣ty was in case they did apply.—The question in controversy is not so much, who ought to come? But if they do come, what the church ought to do, whether to exclude or receive them? If I had treated the question in any other light, he might have justly accused me of "rambling." But this is a fault, that he is guilty of in a high degree. What is it but rambling to treat the affair almost wholly as a case of conscience, and not what was the churches duty in case of actual application, and no sufficient objection against the canditates <HI>&amp;c.?</HI> Is not this running off from the point in debate with a witness? If he had kept close to it, it would have reduced his book to a much narrower com∣pass.</P>
<P>The chief that I said in the other view of the question was, that if candidates acted conscienci∣ously in what they did, if they come out of a sense of the command, and if (as far as they knew their own hearts) they were sincere in what they pro∣fessed, though they could not say it was a gracious sincerity, that was sufficient, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And must he not of necessity go upon the same plan, if certainty be not required? But he will object here, that I han∣dle the subject in such a manner, as will necessa∣rily encorage unregenerate men (knowing them∣selves to be such) to apply. But how groundless is this? I was not directing myself to them, but to the church. And while I was doing so, how pre∣posterous would it have been thought, if I had made a large digression, exhorting such not to come in an hypocritical manner? If I had been preach∣ing indeed to a promiscuous congregation, it would have been proper; and I should in that case have exhorted them to come not only to that, but to <HI>all other</HI> duties with real sincerity, if they expected ac∣ceptance
<PB N="22" REF="012739_0019_0F8BEAA0037B1918"/>with God. But this would have been a mere wandring, a rambling in the present case. How unjust therefore is he in saying. <HI>p.</HI> 41. "The <HI>grand point</HI> Mr. C. is aiming at is to prove, that it is <HI>lawful</HI> for baptized persons not scandalous, to own the covenant, and have baptism, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" How could he say, that this was my <HI>grand point,</HI> when I meddle little with it?

<P N="3">3d. I observe, That it is necessary to make a dis∣tinction respecting persons right in the sight of GOD. This right is to be taken in a two-fold sense. 1st. A right to outward privileges. 2d. A right to saving blessings. Mr. <HI>R.</HI> denies the right of unre∣generate persons in the sight of God in any sense. And says, I contradict myself in implicitly intimat∣ing that they have. But in this I think he goes too far. As to saving blessings we certainly agree; but with respect to outward privileges, I see no absurdity or contradiction in asserting, that they have some right to them in the sight of God; I
<PB N="23" REF="012739_0020_0F8BEAA1021080E0"/>mean a right so far at least, that he would be of∣fended with his church, if they should exclude them without full evidence of their unregeneracy. The case is plain with respect to infants; God knows that many of them are not regenerate, yet if children of the faithful, they must be baptized upon pain of his displeasure. And even in regard of the children of unregenerates, God calls them <HI>my children, the children that were born unto me.</HI> Ezek. xvi. 20, 21. which implies some right in the sight of God to visible privileges, if the parents were in visible covenant and not regularly cut off. This suggests to me a thought of weighty consideration. What one instance of reproof do we find from <HI>Ge∣nesis</HI> to <HI>Malachi</HI> to any individual for <HI>bringing</HI> their children to circumcision, even in their most lapsed and degenerate state? And does not this prove to a demonstration, that all visible members had a right in God' sight to circumcise their children, or that he approved of their administring the rite to them, though at the same time he disapproved of their formality and wrong ends in this and other duties? Further, may we not justly ask, Had not <HI>Judas</HI> a right to outward privileges in the sight of Christ, as well as <HI>Peter?</HI> Would he have otherwise admit∣ted him to the passover, and it is thought by most divines to the Lords supper too? And would he have been offended with the other apostles, if upon suspicion they had endeavored to exclude him till by some overt act he had plainly discovered him∣self, or till full proof appeared against him? And would God himself have <HI>baptized</HI> the <HI>Israelites</HI> of old <HI>in the cloud and in the sea,</HI> if they had not some right to the <HI>visible mark,</HI> as being a people whom he had taken into covenant with himself? 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> x. Yea and does not Mr. <HI>R.</HI> himself assert in his surprising comment on <HI>Jer.</HI> iii. 14. That God treats the church of the <HI>Jews</HI> as <HI>visible saints,</HI> because of their covenant relation to him, (when in fact there was scarce a <HI>real saint</HI> among them?) <HI>p.</HI> 55. And would he have done so, if they had not some right in his sight to visible privileges and favors? Mr. <HI>R.</HI> then must have recourse to this distinction of a two-fold
<PB N="24" REF="012739_0021_0F8BEAA1C5964858"/>right, or he cannot solve his own concession here; though he every where else heedlessly confounds and blends these two rights together. And the like not attending to this distinction by others, has been the source of bitter contentions. But if men would but duely consider, I think none will be so absurd as to assert, that they have no right in the sight of God to that which is given them by the church in direct consequence of his commands. The <HI>sowing of tares</HI> in the <HI>gospel kingdom</HI> is indeed said to <HI>be done by an enemy, i. e.</HI> the devil. <HI>Matt.</HI> xiii 28. But this cannot he applied to those that were bap∣tized in infancy, of whom I am specially treating, because they were not <HI>planted</HI> or <HI>sowed</HI> in the church by the devil, but by God's special appointment, as being children of the faithful. And I hope they will not charge laxness on their maker. This makes way for a notable observation, that if those even of the <HI>devil's sowing,</HI> viz. Those that come at adult age merely for secular and carnal ends; I say, if these must <HI>not be gathered or plucked up</HI> (without full proof appear against them.) v. 29. How much less must they be so, who are of <HI>God's own planting,</HI> and were admitted by his direct order? And if they must be continued still in the church, then church-privileges must necessarily be their's too; and it will be right in the sight of God and man to put them in possession of them, whenever asked for. Their right indeed in the view of the church goes further than this, and is more extensive than their right before God; for in the latter case, their right is confined merely to things outward and visible; but in regard of the church, they have not only a right to outward privileges, but to saving blessings (in the judgment of rational chari∣ty.) Here I apprehend lies the proper difference between their right in the sight of God and the church, or in <HI>soro ecclesiae.</HI></P>
<P>But if they have such a right in the sight of God, does not this militate with what is said under the last head? I answer no, because though they have a right to come as members, yet they have no right to come in a <HI>wrong manner:</HI> And as far as they are
<PB N="25" REF="012739_0022_0F8BEAA278E1D038"/>destitute of gospel principles and ends, so far they offend God in this or any other duty. But then it must be remembred, that this offence is no so great as a total neglect, if a man acts conscienciously in the affair. <HI>Jehu</HI> was commissioned, yea commanded by God to <HI>root out Ahab</HI>'s <HI>vile race;</HI> I <HI>Kings</HI> xiii. And he did right in doing it; yet he had no right to do it in a wrong manner, <HI>i. e.</HI> with a murderous heart; and therefore while he is rewarded for the <HI>act,</HI> he is punished for his <HI>evil intent, Hos</HI> i, 4. But it is evid∣ent his sin would have been greater if he had whol∣ly forborn to act. This may serve as an illustration in the present case. My</P>
<P N="4">4th. OBSERVATION or remark is, That several material things in the Essays remain untouched. I observe,</P>
<P N="1">1st. That his scheme was incumbred with the same difficulty as mine. He had proposed this expedient, namely, to admit candidates under scruple to full communion, and then to dispense with their imme∣diate attendance at the Lord's table, till their scru∣ples were removed. This I said was a half-way prac∣tice, a dividing the seals, a tolerating persons in liv∣ing in the neglect of the holy supper, as much as the other practice. And if the one was unwarrant∣ed by scripture, the other was equally so. And what does he say to obviate the difficulty? Why nothing, or worse than nothing. "Let us wait on them, says he, as members in covenant, and not as half mem∣bers." <HI>p.</HI> 74. A most surprizing speech! as if there were some members not in covenant, or that being members and being in covenant, were not synony∣mous terms. What is the plain import of his words (saving the nonsense) but this? "Let us wait on them as perjured persons, that having covenanted or promised to come imediately, yet stay away; and not as persons that have made no such promise." A notable solution truly! I leave it to the readers animadversion, with adding, that it appears to me impossible, a man should conscienciously scru∣ple the present practice, and yet come into Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s expedient. There is no real difference between the one and the other; all the difference lies
<PB N="26" REF="012739_0023_0F8BEAA339D7A1E8"/>in names and forms only, not in essentials. This leads me to observe,</P>
<P N="2">2d. That all my arguments against his dispens∣ing scheme, are not taken the least notice of, (ex∣cept one sentence in one of them, which is quoted only to be wrested) so that they all yet stand in full force.</P>
<P N="3">3d. Another thing left unnoticed is, That <HI>ex∣plicit</HI> covenanting in baptized persons is a pruden∣tial of the church, and not absolutely necessary by divine institution.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I would observe here, the question between us is, not whether all profession whatsoever is needless with respect to bap∣tized persons; but whether such an open, explicit or large and ample profession, as is required, be necessary by scrip∣ture warrant: Whether we ought to be altogether as strict with them as with a new converted <HI>heathen,</HI> &amp;c. And that it is essential, that they pass through all the formali∣ties as are required of the worst of <HI>pagans</HI> or <HI>jews.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> churches thought a confession of faith sufficient. See <HI>Quick's</HI> synodicon.</NOTE> Here I expected, that he would have attempted to prove that it is necessary, but I find nothing of this. And yet all he says, is founded upon the supposition of such necessity; and if the supposition be not supported, all his su∣perstructure must f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll. The chief he says here is, "That the <HI>Synod</HI> makes it necessary." <HI>p.</HI> 6. But this is a mere human authority, which in other in∣stances he rejects with contempt. Yea, he in effect grants, that explicit covenanting is not ne∣cessary: For in one place he seems to dislike any thing, that "looks like a double admission into the church of Christ." And in another tells us, "that when persons are admitted into the church of Christ, they are admitted once for all:" Which if it be the case, what need they be admitted over again, after they have been actually received into the church in their infancy? <HI>Ursin,</HI> one of the au∣thors Mr. <HI>R.</HI> quotes, says, <HI>To be born in the church, serv∣eth to the infants in stead of their profession</HI> p. 414. and again, <HI>To be born in the church is to infants instead, and in place of profession.</HI> p. 420.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="012739_0024_0F8BEAA40A29AF40"/>
Mr. <HI>R.</HI> indeed says, <HI>p.</HI> 17. "That the <HI>Isarelites</HI> were required to make a public explicit profession, or to renew covenant in a public manner every se∣ven years: So that none could have children to circumcise, who had before made a public profes∣sion of religion." But he says this without proof. The whole law (and not merely the ten command∣ments, as he insinuates) was indeed to be read every seven years in the audience of all the people. <HI>Duet.</HI> xxxi. 9—12.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If hearing the law read be covenanting, then his congre∣gation covenant every sabbath; for the law or scriptures are read to them each day. How can he endure this? How does it consist with his principles to suffer such abu∣sive covenanting, as it must be on the part of many? This of consequence must exclude the scriptures from being read in the public assemblies, if his position be true: Which is the best argument against the public reading of the scriptures, that ever I heard of.</NOTE> But nothing is said about their <HI>covenanting:</HI> And if there was any thing of that nature, it was merely implicit. As is the case, when we hear the word read in our public congre∣gation. Suppose Christ had commanded, that all the new-testament (or the four evangelists) should be read at once every seven years in his church, that his people might better know and understand their duty, could it be inferred from hence, that he instituted a public renewal of covenant every seven years? It would be a very strained inference indeed, and "unworthy a <HI>Logician.</HI>"</P>
<P>But supposing such a public explicit covenanting was required of the <HI>jews</HI> every seven years, what does it prove? Not that individuals should renew covenant alone or singly, as they happen to be sa∣tisfied of their gracious state; but that the whole church (consisting of all baptized persons) should renew the covenant in a body every few years. Thus it was in the days of king <HI>Hezekiah</HI> and <HI>Josiah;</HI> and thus our fathers did; and this we have be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n asking for: And if Mr. <HI>R.</HI> would allow of it, he might properly (in his own sense) "wait upon scruplers as members in covenant, and not as half-members."
<PB N="28" REF="012739_0025_0F8BEAA4B71A79D0"/>But this it seems will not go down with him, neither is it consistent with his plan. Such general covenanting according to them being stark naught, unless, every individual be in some mea∣sure persuaded of their regenerate state; which never was, nor ever will be the case.</P>
<P>Besides this general covenanting of the <HI>Israelites</HI> (if there was any such thing) was not previous to their first receiving the passover, as is the case with res∣pect to the gospel-passover or Lords supper. For all the members of the <HI>jewish</HI> church, were admitted to the passover from their infancy; and so owning the covenant was not necessary, in order to their com∣ing. I observed</P>
<P N="4">4th. That relations were absolutely necessary up∣on their scheme. "The original plan of the church∣es," which he speaks so often of and urges in other instances, renders them essential to communion, so essential, that none in any case were to be admitted without. And they are alike essential on his scheme; I do not see how it can otherwise be supported, as I have frequently noted heretofore. And yet instead of pleading and proving the necessity, he in eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct gives them up, granting that they are not necessary to "the right or regular constitution of a church." <HI>p.</HI> 63. And if that be the case, what evidences of regeneration has he more than others? or what is he contending about!</P>
<P N="5">5th. I observed, that renewing or owning the covenant did not make them members or any ad∣dition to their membership: that membership was a thing, that could not be increased or diminished: That a man was a member or no member, and that there could be no medium or halves in the case, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That their <HI>capacities of acting</HI> might indeed be widely different, but yet no inequality in their member∣ship. And for illustration I might add, that my young son of three years of age, was as much a mem∣ber of the town of <HI>Plymouth</HI> and of the province of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay.</HI> as I myself; yet he was not ca∣pable at present of acting in that relation as I did; but might justly claim the privilege as soon as his capacity allowed of it. This position Mr. <HI>R.</HI> does not
<PB N="29" REF="012739_0026_0F8BEAA65C0B9C78"/>so much as look in the face: He durst not assert in direct terms, that there are degrees of membership. That a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n might become one quarter, one half, two thirds or nine tenths of a member, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> till at last his membership arrived to maturity or complete∣ness. But yet in many places he says, that which implies <HI>degrees</HI> of membership: Yea, he actually as∣serts (though without proof) that baptized persons, after they have renewed covenant, are but half members. But what confusion of thought does this betray? He grants, that infants baptized are <HI>"proper members;"</HI> yet when they grow up and declare that they stand to their parent's act, they are but <HI>half-members:</HI> So that it seems by renewing covenant, they lose <HI>half</HI> their membership. A poor encorage∣ment truely to the renewing covenant, and they had much better let it alone. Or if he supposes this half-membership to commence from their infancy; how could he in any sense call them "proper mem∣bers?" A half-member, is not a proper member, but a monster. And for a church to bring forth half-members, would be as monstrous in the eccle∣siastical, as for a woman to bring forth a half child into the natural world. And such births, I believe, would never have been heard of in the christian church, had it not been for Dr. <HI>B—y</HI>'s fertile in∣vention. Upon the whole, here, I think I have a a right to demand of them, either to prove that membership is a <HI>gradual</HI> growing, increasing thing, or to lay aside this absurd way of expression of <HI>half-members,</HI> &amp;c. If they will continue it without such proof, can it be any uncharitableness to say, that they do it to mislead the vulgar, and to impose upon them with sounds instead of substance?</P>
<P N="6">6th. I observe, That infant baptism must be given up, if this way of arguing be not conclusive, <HI>They that are visibly in covenant, have a right to the seal of the coven∣ant for themselves and children.</HI> This is indeed taken notice of, but in what a strange manner? <HI>p.</HI> 47. "Mr. <HI>C.</HI> says he, strenuously and repeatedly insists, that infant baptism cannot be maintained on the plan he is opposing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But this he asserts on sup∣position that we <HI>deny</HI> infant-membership." I did not
<PB N="30" REF="012739_0027_0F8BEAA8A044DD40"/>assert it on any such supposition, but intirely on the contrary supposition, namely, that they <HI>owned</HI> in∣fant-membership. The ground I went upon was so plain, that he that runs might read. The main argument for infant baptism is this, that the parents are visibly in covenant with God, and that God grants the same right to their children in the <HI>grand charter, Gen.</HI> xvii. So that if the parent be in cove∣nant, the children are so too, and consequently ought to have the seal of the covenant. This I appli∣ed to the present controversy; the parents in question are in visible covenant; and if so, the children are so likewise; and consequently ought to have the seal. If the argument was conclusive in the one case, it was certainly so in the other. And therefore to deny the validity of this way of argu∣ing, was to undermine the very foundation of in∣fant-baptism. To this nothing is said, neither is the baptism of infants accounted for, on any other footing, which he ought to have done if he design∣ed to invalidate my argument. It is an acknow∣ledged point with all <HI>paedo-baptists,</HI> that infants are always members together with their parents; that there is a necessary connection between the mem∣bership of the one and the other: Therefore none can justly deny infants the seal in the present case, unless they deny infant-membership, or the conti∣nuance of it at adult age.</P>
<P>Here is a proper place to remind him of Mr. <HI>Mit∣chel's</HI> argument, with which I begin my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssays, and which he does not think proper directly to contest. <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>1st. The whole visible church under the new-testament is to be baptized. 2d. If a man be once in the church (whether admitted at age or in infancy) nothing less than censurable evil can put him out. 3d. That if the parent be in the visible church, his infant child is so also.</Q> The first and last of these propositions Mr. <HI>R.</HI> dare not deny. He nibbles a little here and there at the second; but says nothing effectually. The amount of what he says is, that if any <HI>"habitually neglect"</HI> the ordinance of the supper, they are guilty of a <HI>censurable</HI> evil, consequently ought to be excluded. I grant it. But
<PB N="31" REF="012739_0028_0F8BE20289073FB0"/>how can he prove this <HI>habitual neglect</HI> on the candi∣dates I am pleading for? They profess the <HI>highest esteem</HI> for this ordinance. They think, with Mr. <HI>R.</HI> that the command to attend it is directed to <HI>true believers.</HI> They doubt whether they are such, though they have some hopes. They fear they shall profane it, and drink judgment to themselves, if they immediately approach it. They think it better to seek clearer evidences before they ven∣ture. This is certainly the case of many: And how dare he say, that it is not the case of all, un∣less they discover an <HI>habitual neglect</HI> by their <HI>profani∣ty?</HI> If he will say it of others (notwithstanding their professions to the contrary) is not this judg∣ing the heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a a witness? which the scripture gives him no warrant to do; yea, which he him∣self sometimes disclaims.</P>
<P N="7">7th. I observed, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> repealing this practice would be a virtual excommunication or unchurch∣ing our children. Mr. <HI>R.</HI> disclaims this with in∣dignation, and is very angry with me for using the words, <HI>delivering to satan,</HI> which is the scripture ex∣pression for excommunication. But does he clear himself from it? in no wise.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He rather fully confirms it by his frequent expressions of their having "forfeited their right" "forfeited the cha∣racter of visible christians." "Their visible discipleship good for nothing"—"no right to be treated as disciples"—"Not a right to so much as the name." Yea. "that there was a rule or pattern in scripture for denying them all privi∣leges, if not for <HI>casting them out,</HI>" &amp;c. p. 17. 32. 33. 34. &amp;c.</NOTE> Let us calmly con∣sider the matter To deprive members of all pri∣vilege, is it not synonymous or the same thing with excommunication? if I should be deprived of <HI>all</HI> the privileges of an <HI>Englishman,</HI> I should be outlaw∣ed or excommunicated from the civil society with a witness; that is, as really as if a <HI>sentence of outlawry</HI> was pronounced. And why is it not so in the other case? When persons have been received as mem∣bers and acknowledged as "proper members;" yet afterwards to be treated as no members, to be de∣nied
<PB N="32" REF="012739_0029_0F8BEAA93490FC48"/>every privilege, if this be not an <HI>ipso facto</HI> ex∣communication. I know not what words mean. There is no <HI>essential</HI> difference between this, and what is commonly called excommunication: All the difference lies here, that in the one case a <HI>form∣al sentence</HI> is pronounced, but not so in the other, which is but a circumstance. But does not this as∣sertion carry in it a great reflection on our <HI>fathers</HI> of this church, and all the other churches that ne∣ver came into this practice. Is tnot a direct con∣demning them as guilty of excommunicating all the children of the church? I answer, no; such churches cannot be justly taxed with this fault: They never <HI>acted</HI> any thing in a <HI>formal manner</HI> about it: None ever applied and claimed their right, and were refused; so that these churches seem rather <HI>passive</HI> in the affair. But where a door has been opened, and baptized members have been express∣ly declared to be intitled to this privilege, and have long enjoyed it: for such now to be shut out, and declared uncapable of any privilege, and treated really as no members, if this be not excommunica∣tion, what can be called so? And must our children be thus treated, when no just objection lies against them? unhappy case then of these poor lambs of the flock! The church must cast them out, if they do not come; Mr. <HI>R.</HI> would not receive them if they do; what shall they do? and will they tame∣ly submit to this? will they contentedly rest un∣der such an excommunication, because Mr. <HI>R.</HI> tells them it is right? (as well as put up with all the <HI>hard names</HI> he calls them?) who could have thought it? but it is verily the case with many, who seem almost ready to <HI>throw dust in the air, and cry, away,</HI> &amp;c. because I plead their cause, and stand up for their just rights and privileges. Who ever heard before of such treatment of an <HI>advocate?</HI> if the advocates for our <HI>civil liberties</HI> and <HI>privileges</HI> should be treated thus, we should find but few to stand in the gap in this day of difficulty and danger.</P>
<P N="8">8th. I observed, that he must necessarily run in∣to the plan of the <HI>separates,</HI> if he treats those whom he acknowleges proper members in this manner.
<PB N="33" REF="012739_0030_0F8BEAADE4FEA460"/>(See at large in the Essays. <HI>p.</HI> 7. and elsewhere.) And does he clear himself of this? not a word tend∣ing that way.</P>
<P>Lastly, I find he takes not the least notice of my "long string of arguments" for infant membership in one view of them. <HI>p.</HI> 53. They were calculated to prove, not only that they were proper members when first baptized, but that they <HI>continued</HI> such when they grew up. That they did not grow out of the church, but that their infant membership remained in full force, till regularly cut off: and that of consequence he was wrong in denying them the privileges belonging to members as such, when∣ever asked for. With respect to this there is a deep silence. I now proceed to a,</P>
<P N="5">V. General observation, that he makes such con∣cessions as destroy his whole scheme.</P>
<P N="1">1st. He grants, that baptized persons are mem∣bers, yea "proper members." Why then will he not treat them as members? why will he not allow them the privileges of members? Membership and privilege are inseparable; being in covenant and the privileges of the covenant always go together, as far as the capacity of the subject will allow, and they ought to be granted as far as they are asked for. There is no way to get over this but by say∣ing, that their membership is wholly lost; that it is forfeited some way or other; and that of conse∣quence they are as much <HI>without,</HI> as if they had never been baptized. Indeed he sometimes hints, that this is the case: but why does he not directly speak out, if he be of that mind? and why does he not call the church together to discipline them and pass sentence against them in form, as he ought to do, if their membership be wholly sor∣feited? but it seems he rather chooses to act, as if they were neither <HI>within</HI> or <HI>without;</HI> he will nei∣ther receive them nor cast them off: but leaves them as it were, suspended between heaven and hell, as if they belonged to neither; or if (as half-members) half of them belonged to God's, and half to the devil's kingdom.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="34" REF="012739_0031_0F8BEAAEC7528EB8"/>
2d. He grants, "that real good christians may be u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der scruples of conscience about the Lord's supper." And that these scruples may be lawfully indulged. <HI>p.</HI> 38.41.74. And if they may be indulg∣ed in one case, why not in another! if on his plan, why not on ours?</P>
<P N="3">3d. He grants, that baptized persons are the sub∣jects of discipline, and that they are "under the special watch and care of the church, intitled to their prayers in a more peculiar manner, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" And that these are "great advantages" or privileges. <HI>p.</HI> 54. Well then persons baptized may partake of <HI>some privileges</HI> without coming to the Lord's table. And of of some, why not of others? if they may claim the church's watch for themselves, why not put their children under the same watch? if they have a peculiar right to the church's prayers, why not rightfully ask the same prayers for their children as being part of themselves, <HI>&amp;c.?</HI> Mr. <HI>R.</HI> it seems divides privileges, and we have as much right to do it as he; and he is self-condemned, if he holds the unlawfulness of it.</P>
<P N="4">4th. He grants, that a baptized person (if he lays no bar in his own way) may demand rightfully one privilege, <HI>viz.</HI> the Lord's-supper. And why may he not as well demand another privilege, <HI>viz.</HI> bap∣tism for his children? what ground is there to make the Lord's-supper the <HI>only standard?</HI> why must admission to or exclusion from the rest be wholly regulated by this? it is not coming to this feast, but being in covenant that gives the right.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Another thing observable is that his plan necessarily runs him into several absurdities. Dr. <HI>I. Mather</HI> observes of the opposite party in his time, "that to maintain their scheme they are forced to run into several absurdities:" from whence he justly infers, that it could not be of God: for "truth is always consistent." The same I observe with re∣spect to Mr. <HI>R.</HI> I shall now mention two or three, leaving the rest to be taken notice of elsewhere.</P>
<P N="1">1st. That there are some in covenant, that have no right to the privileges of the covenant, when as they are inseparable, as I have already noted.
<PB N="35" REF="012739_0032_0F8BEAAF552C1EC8"/>How absurd would it be to say, that an incorporat∣ed member of civil society had no right to the privileges of the society? such right is essential to the very idea of membership. The same absurdi∣ty they are guilty of in the present case. Accord∣ing to them there is very little or no difference at all between a baptized and unbaptized person: they can claim no more privilege than the unbap∣tized; they must be as strictly examined; they must pass through all the same formalities, in or∣der to be received into the church, or to <HI>enter into covenant</HI> (as their pharse is, not <HI>renewing covenant,</HI> which way of expression they carefully avoid) as the other. They have no more ground to expect or hope for divine influence (at least if their parent be unregenerate) than the other. Well therefore may we put the question, what advantage of cir∣cumcision? or what privilege accrues to them by being baptized?</P>
<P N="2">2d. Another most gross, glaring absurdity is, that the baptism of the children of unregenerates is "a MERE NULLITY." <HI>p.</HI> 48.—I was astonished when I read this: it is a position I believe that was never before heard of in the christian church, except from professed <HI>anabaptists.</HI> What! was the circum∣cision of <HI>Asa, Hezekiah</HI> and <HI>Josiah</HI> (the children of unregerate men) a mere nullity? I know they did not think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o; neither (to speak with reverence) did God himself think so.</P>
<P>If this extraordinary assertion be true: then 1st. All distinction between the visible and invisible church is distroyed; yea, the former is intirely an∣nihilated; nothing done in it being of any real validity, as it stands contradistinguished from the latter; nothing is left but a heap of <HI>nullities</HI> from the beginning to end. This confounding all dis∣tinction between the visible and invisible church I formerly noted in the Essays. And now he is pleased to confirm it: and that not only in this passage, but in what preceeds. There he utterly denies any promises made to the visible church collectively considered, and consines them <HI>only</HI> to the <HI>believing</HI> part of the church. <HI>The promise is to you
<PB N="36" REF="012739_0033_0F8BEAAFF7A98EB8"/>and to your children,</HI> the apostle tells us, <HI>Act.</HI> ii. 39. <HI>i. e.</HI> (says Mr. <HI>R.</HI>) "To you who are the children of <HI>Abraham</HI> and have THE FAITH of <HI>Abraham;</HI> and to your children, as <HI>parts</HI> of your selves." <HI>p.</HI> 47. What a strange and new construction of the text is here? what business had he to apply these words to true believers, invisible members only? was not the apostle preaching to <HI>unconverted jews?</HI> and did he not address them merely as members of the <HI>visible church?</HI> as such he tells them, that <HI>the promise was to them and to their children:</HI> and in the same manner it belongs to the visible church to the end of time, and not to the believing part only. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ike ad∣dress we have <HI>Act.</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i. 25. And to the same pur∣pose St. <HI>Paul</HI> says, <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 2. <HI>To them pertain the adop∣tion and the glory and the covenants and the promises,</HI> &amp;c. And yet Mr. <HI>R.</HI> boldly asserts, that "there are no promises in the book of God" to the visible church, but that they all belong to the church invisible, and to that only. "And on these principles, he says, some rational as well as scriptural account may be given of infant baptism." And on these principles I say, not only infant, but all baptism is impracticable and without foundation; it being impossible to tell who are members of the invisible church, real believers, without an immediate revela∣tion from heaven. 2d. If this assertion be true, what a dilemma are all baptized in infancy brought into? in what inextricable difficulties are they in∣volved? who of us can say, that our baptism was not a mere nullity, a nothing? we may indeed have c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty for our parents, and verily hope they were c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rted: but how can we certainly know it? and without such knowledge, how can we plead for covenant blessings on their account? how can we use it as an argument for special grace, as <HI>Ephraim</HI> did? <HI>Jer.</HI> xxxi. 18. What a mockery to plead a mere nullity? or must we come with an <HI>if;</HI> "if they were converted, Lord, grant us these blessings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If not, we have no more to say; we ask only for <HI>uncovenanted</HI> mercies?" 3d. Upon the same prin∣ciple, it will follow, that the baptism administred by unregenerate ministers is a mere nullity: as
<PB N="37" REF="012739_0034_0F8BEAB246215218"/><HI>spiritual fathers</HI> they have no more right to admini∣ster the ordinance, than the <HI>natural parents</HI> have to bring their children to it. The right on both sides must be merely visible and <HI>nominal,</HI> not <HI>real.</HI> And what a wilderness will this lead us into? 4th. Accord∣ing to this principle, the baptism of <HI>Luther, Calvin</HI> and all the other first reformers, received in the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> was a mere nullity; consequently they ought to be looked upon as unbaptized per∣sons. How then can our baptism received from them be of any validity? for no unbaptized person can baptize another. Well then it is come to this at last, that there is no true baptism in the <HI>protestant</HI> world. Why then do we so earnestly contend about <HI>nothing.</HI> 5th. If this be the case, baptism ought to be reiterated upon parents discovering their unregeneracy, as is often the case. If it be a thing of nought, a mere nullity, it must stand for nought, and re-baptization is necessary. Or if Mr. <HI>R.</HI> has a faculty of turning <HI>nothing</HI> into <HI>something,</HI> the world would be obliged to him for the disco∣very.</P>
<P>Upon the whole here, if this position be true, in∣fant baptism is a matter of such uncertainty view∣ed in every light, that I should think it best for every one to be re-baptized at adult age: or rather, that no infants should be baptized at all. For there is no possible way to ascertain it to them, that their bap∣tism was not a mere nullity, <HI>i. e.</HI> a nothing, a shadow, a vanity—of no more real validity, than the bap∣tizing of <HI>bells</HI> or a piece of wood in the <HI>Romish</HI> church.</P>
<P N="3">3d. His reasoning about baptisms alone not in∣titling, or "not being of itself a sufficient qualifi∣cation," appears to me very absurd. <HI>p.</HI> 9. <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We had much more of it in the piece he read to the church.</NOTE> It is an old maxim of divines, <HI>baptism gives a right to all ordinances:</HI> No, says he, unless they have other qualifications. I might as well say, he holds com∣ing to full communion gives a right to all ordi∣nances; no, say I, they must have other qualifica∣tions; they must be blameless, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> How absurd
<PB N="38" REF="012739_0035_0F8BEAB333399238"/>would such a way of reasoning appear? it is cer∣tain, that in both cases, they may forfeit their right. And till such forfeiture be made, their right re∣mains in full force, and their membership continues one and the same without addition or dimmution. But according to this notion, <HI>viz.</HI> that such and such things are necessary besides baptism to make a compleat member, every new act of duty that a man performs, serves to increase his membership: so that even a communicant becomes more and more a member every day, while he goes on in the path of duty: membership must necessarily be a growing thing, as long as a man's life lasts: and to what an enormous bulk would it arrive in forty or fifty years? what new nonsense is this? QUERY, whether one of these <HI>grown</HI> members ought not to have a dozen or more <HI>voices</HI> in our church-meeting, seeing his membership is of a bulk so vastly exceed∣ing that of others? I pass to a</P>
<P N="7">VII. General OBSERVATION, that really after all this bustle about evidences; what has he more up∣on his plan than mine? if he differs from me about evidences, he ought to have ascertained par∣ticularly wherein the difference lies and set down with precision what evidences were absolutely ne∣cessary, and that in the <HI>low<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> degree, and not have muffled himself up in shade and obscurity, and lest the matter in such uncertainty and confusion as he has done. This general loose handling the point has a tendency to make common people think, that he is more for <HI>purity</HI> and <HI>holiness</HI> than others: whereas if he had come to particulars, it would have appeared that he contended about no∣thing. But what evidences are to be had in the case? is it profession or asserting to the covenant? the evidence is equal on both sides. Is it relations? these are cast out by some leaders in his plan; and he himself acknowledges, that they are not neces∣sary to the right constitution of a church. <HI>p</HI> 63. Though he herein departs from the original plan, upon which these churches were founded, which he imputes to us as a crime. But what, though rela∣tions be not absolutely necessary, yet they are still
<PB N="39" REF="012739_0036_0F8BEAB3CA253AA0"/>used among us; and as long as they are so they will be some help to the church in forming a judgment of charity. What always? are not these relations sometimes weak and imperfect, and contain little or nothing of experimental religion? are they not at other times such ostentations things, as serve ra∣ther to prejudice than help forward christian cha∣rity? what must be done in this case? would not he be thought a strange member that should object merely on such an account? must he not have something to allege against the life and conversa∣tion, or his objection would be taken no notice of? well then it is plain that the life and conversation is the grand criterion the chief evidence after all to regulate the church's proceedings. But how much of this must be known before I can list up my hand for a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>son's admission! respecting some, the church in general may have full know∣ledge; their lives are so exemplary, as carries full conviction in the consciences of all. But how often is it otherwise in regard of others? how little is known of many candidates by the generality of the church? especially in such great towns as this? and must they not of necessity go upon negative evidences in many cases? at least many individuals of the church must necessarily do so. The most they can say is, that they never heard any thing amiss of the candidates. And sometimes they cannot say so much as that, having heard-several things amiss, though for want of proof or not looking upon it as a censurable evil, they do not think proper to al∣lege it as a bar. I am sure, that as to half that have been admitted into our communion, I have had nothing but negative evidence, ex∣cept their relation or consenting to the cove∣nant. And the same may many others say. And what had Mr. <HI>R</HI> but negative evidences about us when he first settled here? and yet he ventured to covenant with us <HI>i e.</HI> to receive us as christians, as well as we him. Now if negative evidences be sufficient with respect to communicants; why not sufficient likewise for his other "proper members?" are greater evidences required of these minors,
<PB N="40" REF="012739_0037_0F8BEAB488973418"/>than of grown members? but these were once ad∣mitted upon a profession of grace or relation of ex∣periences. What in those churches, that were founded upon Mr. <HI>Stoddard</HI>'s plan? and yet he owns he will receive such to communion if they be oc∣casionally with us or should settle among us. <HI>p.</HI> 63. But have not these persons something <HI>more</HI> than ne∣gative evidence, if that be requisite? do not they offer to renew covenant publicly? and is not this the main evidence they build upon? is not this profession the all in all with them? (See Mr. <HI>Green</HI>)</P>
<P>But this they do not do understandingly, believ∣ingly, if they will come no further, this is all hypo∣crisy if they do not come in full. How dare he say this, when at the same time he grants, it may be the case with some sincere souls? did he find it so with those whom he admitted? then he is self-condemned. Is it the case with other ministers? they will not own it. Upon the whole here, will he, dare he say, "that negative evidence (that the church knows nothing amiss of them) is no evidence at all" with respect to communicants: what more is necessary in order to the <HI>continuation</HI> of their mem∣bership? and may not the same be said of other members, that if the church knows nothing essen∣tially amiss of them, their membership still conti∣nues, and they ought to be treated as members: there is no way to get rid of this way of reasoning, but by acting upon the separates plan. Or must we do as he proposed at our meeting with some bre∣thren last year, namely, "for every member to go and discourse personally with candidates upon their being propounded, in order to obtain full sa∣tisfaction: this, he said, was our express duty." But I believe he will find few of his mind in the country: such a laborious task being incompatible with our other duties, as well as absurd in itself. My</P>
<P N="8">VIII. And last OBSERVATION is, that his book abounds with blunders and mistakes, with incon∣sistences and contradictions. I have already taken notice of some of them <HI>en passant</HI> under the forego∣ing observations. I shall now put several of them together, leaving others to their proper places.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="012739_0038_0F8BEAB538DAC770"/>
Mr. <HI>R.</HI> stumbles at the very thresh-hold; even at first setting out, before he had got three pages there are three notable mistakes, if not more. In <HI>p</HI> 1. he tells us, that he always had scruples about the practice; or, to use his own words. <Q>The practice has EVER appeared to me attended with some difficulties, which I could not easily get over; however, not attending so thoroughly to the arguments that were used in support of this scheme, as I endeavored to do since, and being <HI>educated</HI> in the practice, I did <HI>submit</HI> to it here for a number of years after I was ordained; though still not without some <HI>uneasiness,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> How will the reader be astonished when I tell him, that previous to Mr <HI>R</HI>'s settlement, he was discoursed with by a number of the brethren (and they were the more critical with him, because he came from a colony where their discipline somewhat differs from ours) and he was told the constitution of the church step by step, and he appeared cordially and fully to join with us in every thing; and par∣ticularly as to this practice he expressed the <HI>fullest satisfaction</HI> (and if he had not done so, he would ne∣ver have been settled here) saying, "that he look∣ed upon it as scriptural, that his father was in it, that he thought it intirely right, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" But now it seems he scrupled it <HI>ever,</HI> and <HI>submitted</HI> to it with <HI>uneasiness</HI> for a number of years, even from the very time of his ordination. How can these things be reconciled? could a man of sincerity say, that he was intirely satisfied with a practice, when he had latent scruples in his mind, whether it were lawful or no? how needlessly has he here exposed himself? I am sure it affords not the least advantage to his cause to tell the world, that he always had doubts about it; he had much better have kept them to himself. But I suppose he does it to avoid the imputation of <HI>fic∣kleness,</HI> or toward off the charge of <HI>arminianism</HI> I had brought against him for holding to this practice for his first nine years. But, <HI>incidit in scyllam, qui vult,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But how comes he finally to get rid of his doubts, and to be fixed in the negative side of the question?
<PB N="42" REF="012739_0039_0F8BEAB5F99B44C8"/>here is another stumble. He tells us, "such force his scruples had upon him, that at length he de∣termines to study the point more closely, and for that end procured what authors <HI>he could</HI> on both sides, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" A good method surely, but how does he manage in it? he first manifested his dislike of the practice to one of our deacons, as he transiently met him on the road, the same day with our sacramental lecture; and appeared fully determined telling him in express terms, that he would never baptize ano∣ther upon the old plan; and was all on high to stop the church after lecture, to have the practice cast out at once. The deacon with much difficulty dis∣suaded him from such a rash and precipitant pro∣cedure. In further discourse on the subject, Mr. <HI>R.</HI> owned it was Dr. <HI>B—y</HI>'s <HI>dialogue</HI> that had convinc∣ed him, and withal said that there was an answer published, but he had not yet seen it. He also owned, that he had not read the <HI>synod</HI>'s result, and indeed seemed to know nothing about it, when the deacon recommended it to his perusal. And as for other anci∣ent authors on the subject, it is manifest from his book and otherways, that he never read Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> which even lay in his way: and the authors on the other side, as <HI>I. Mather,</HI> president <HI>Wadsworth,</HI> Mr. <HI>Stone,</HI> &amp;c. I know he had never seen them, till long after the matter was brought into public. I put the two first of these authors into his hands, and desired him to read them attentively: he took them with much seeming indifference▪ and carried them home. Sometime after being at his house, I found, instead of giving Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> a diligent perusal, he was only turning over the book, to cull out passages that he thought favored his scheme; so he declared himself. And whether he ever read the other at all, I can not say. Is this the man that had so carefully (as well as prayerfully) studied the point "for many months?" he could read Mr. <HI>B—y</HI>'s <HI>dialogue</HI> in half an hour. I know he has since procured the <HI>Connec∣ticut</HI> writers on both sides, but he was, it seems, set∣tled before, and declared himself to be so, upon the bare perusal of the <HI>dialogue.</HI> A book that appears to me the least calculated to bring conviction, of al∣most
<PB N="43" REF="012739_0040_0F8BEAB727734DE0"/>any that ever I read: it must be the outhor's name, and not his arguments that gains proselytes. The whole piece being founded on these two sup∣positions
<LIST>
<ITEM>1st. That the candidate himself <HI>knows</HI> that he is not converted.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. That he makes <HI>open profession</HI> of unregeneracy; which is equivalent to a bad life. Besides his making his parishioners talk like fools, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
The deacon told Mr. <HI>R.</HI> he wondered how he could be convinced by so week a piece, which he thought he could fully answer himself.</P>
<P>He again stumbles and blunders strangely in <HI>p.</HI> 2. He appears very angry at me about the word <HI>stre∣nuous.</HI> How in the name of common sense he could mistake me thus, "I cannot imagine." All I as∣serted was, that he was <HI>strenuous</HI> on the negative side of the question. (Essays, 1st leaf.) And if he was not so, what means his book?—What means all his management for two or three years past? but he turns it, contrary to all the rules of reason, that I charge him with being <HI>strenuous to have church-meet∣ings.</HI> I never thought him so; but rather believe he either designed to lay aside the practice by his sole authority, or expected the church would give it up at a word's speaking out of complaisance to him. This perhaps he would have thought "po∣lite."</P>
<P>Another blunder exactly of the same tenor is about the <HI>highest evidence,</HI> p. 59. I was speaking of the highest sort of evidence <HI>before the church,</HI> he turns it the highest sort of evidence <HI>in a persons own breast.</HI></P>
<P>A like gross mistake he makes about the word <HI>unsatisfied.</HI> p. 75. I said, that he was as much unsa∣tisfied with the practice as ever. He turns it thus (even making a <HI>lye</HI> of it) that I said he was unsatis∣fied with the meeting's being dissolved. How could a man in his senses mistake me thus? is he so barren of matter to load me with reproaches, that he will even strain a point for it! I knew he was so far from being unsatisfied with the dissolution of the meet∣ing, that it was what he labored for with all his might; and that not only personally, but by his emissaries, whom he sent about to put the mem∣bers into a flamé in order to effect it; they infus∣ing
<PB N="44" REF="012739_0041_0F8BEAB7AD480698"/>into people that it was not conscience that ac∣tuated us, but that all our aim in our opposition was to get away Mr. <HI>R.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the beginning of the book—it is certainly a mistake, not to say worse, to tell the world, that his book is but "a brief sketch of the arguments he made use of in support of his opini∣on." <HI>p.</HI> 3. All the church know the contrary. Here is much more delivered than ever the church heard before, and drawn up in a more copious and masterly manner. In fact, all the <HI>real</HI> arguments he brought before the church might be contained in a nutshell; he never attempting to give a direct reply to any of my Essays (though he had a copy of the first, and the second I sent him above a week before it was read in public;) but the chief he did wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to read to us a long collection from Messieurs <HI>Edwards, Bellamy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>on,</HI> &amp;c. principally about quali∣fications. But to as little purpose almost, as if he had read Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> about the Lord's-supper sole∣ly and <HI>verbatim.</HI> If he thinks it was to the purpose, let him print it: I promise him to be a <HI>subscriber,</HI> if he will make no alterations or additions.</P>
<P>And as to his sermons or "discourses in public" mentioned <HI>p.</HI> 2. He handled the point merely in a <HI>casaistical</HI> manner, and did not so much as touch the case as it was a matter of <HI>church consideration.</HI> And even this he managed in such a manner, as gave almost general dissatisfaction: people then (being free from <HI>prejudice</HI>) not being so ready to swallow every thing he said as gospel.</P>
<P>Let us now touch a little on inconsistencies and contradictions.</P>
<P>And here more generally we may observe, that in some places of his book baptized persons are proper members, in others but half members, and in others no members at all, having forfeited all their right by their <HI>wickedness</HI> in not coming to the Lord's-table. <HI>p.</HI> 57. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And yet they may be good persons notwithstanding, and deserving the church∣es forbearance. <HI>p.</HI> 38. Sometimes they are members, but not members in covenant. <HI>p.</HI> 74. As if being members and being in covenant were not words
<PB N="45" REF="012739_0042_0F8BEABF5BFC0C18"/>exactly of the same import. Pray what is it makes them members but their being in covenant?</P>
<P>But to be more particular.—The gentlemen in <HI>Connecticut</HI> express themselves in such a manner as this, that they are in some sort members, members in a sense, imperfect members, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But Mr. <HI>R.</HI> who has a better talent in reconciling contradicti∣ons, expresses himself without boggling, that they are "proper members;" and yet denies them every privilege, that belongs to members as such. But these have forfeited their right by their disobedi∣ence in not coming to the Lord's-supper. How so! when they may be real good christians at the same time, and ought to be used with all possible ten∣derness? what bitter water and sweet does he pour forth at once? to the same effect we find that for 6. or 7. pages together he endeavored with all his might to prove, that it is impossible for a person to be a true christian without coming to the Lord's-table. (<HI>p.</HI> 31—37.) And yet he kicks it all down at one stroke, even in one line, by granting, "that it was often the case of good christians to be kept away by scruples." Yea, he actually canoni∣zed one of this sort in a funeral discourse, since his change of principles.</P>
<P>This leads me to take notice of a cluster of con∣tradictions blended or jumbled together. He says repeatedly, that persons who have only owned the covenant are but half-members. We have a num∣ber of such, that owned the covenant either in his or Mr. <HI>Leonard's</HI> days, who have never yet of∣fered themselves to communion. How does Mr <HI>R.</HI> treat them? as half-members? as guilty of habi∣tual continued neglect? as wilful renouncers and refusers? as wicked persons <HI>&amp;c.</HI> No; instead of this, these are all at once turned by him (without their asking, without the churches consent) into <HI>members in full communion;</HI> and as such he baptizes their children without boggling or scruple.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This suggests to my mind a <HI>lucky expedient,</HI> that may perhaps reconcile all. If Mr. <HI>R.</HI> can get over the difficulty about those who have <HI>already</HI> owned the covenant, by saying, he <HI>looks upon them as members in full com∣munion.</HI> Why can not he get over the difficulty the same way <HI>in futuro,</HI> by admitting persons to own the covenant, and then saying <HI>they are in full communion!</HI> thus he and the church may jogg on together in harmony and peace.</NOTE> And
<PB N="46" REF="012739_0043_0F8BEAC06946F4A0"/>to render the inconsistence more compleat, when these new sort of members in full communion ap∣ply to be received to the Lord's-supper (of which there has been two instances very lately) does he immediately receive them without further ceremo∣ny, or ask the church to do it? no; they must needs be received in common form; be propounded for a fortnight, bring a relation, covenant anew, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here is a double, treble, yea, quadruple admission into the church of God. All <HI>wrong</HI> according to him: and yet he the <HI>chief actor</HI> in it. But as if all this were not enough, there must be another cir∣cumstance added, to render it compleater still which is the "crowning cut of all;" and that is, Mr. <HI>R—s</HI>'s chief champion, the man of his right hand (whom he most employs to propagate his cause) is one that hath actually owned the cove∣nant among us in former years, but hath never yet asked for an admission to the Lord's-table. Here is confusion upon confusion. Let us now attend to other instances.</P>
<P>We have often observed, that Mr. <HI>R.</HI> calls them "proper members" that have been baptized in in∣fancy; yet of late he carefully avoids the old ex∣pression of <HI>renewing covenant,</HI> when such apply at adult years; always using that of <HI>entering into cove∣nant,</HI> as if they were never in covenant before. See all over his book; and this is his general language in public, when any are propounded. I beg to know how they can <HI>enter</HI> upon a thing which (ac∣cording to his own concession) they entered upon or were in possession of long before. This language imports, that they were never really in covenant till now. And there are many other passages in his book, that import the same thing, or that they were never members till this entrance we are speaking of. The fourth argument <HI>p.</HI> 6. goes wholly
<PB N="47" REF="012739_0044_0F8BEAC099A85818"/>upon this supposition. He appears to dislike "any thing that looks like a double admission into the church of God." <HI>p.</HI> 3. He says, persons "are ad∣mitted into the family of Christ once for all." <HI>p.</HI> 6. How can this be till this entrance? he seems to fault me for calling baptized persons <HI>real members, compleat members.</HI> p. 9. 42. He mentions these phrases with a sneer. He speaks of them as <HI>not of the church. p.</HI> 74. And frequently calls their owning covenant an <HI>admission,</HI> as if their membership did not com∣mence till now. How can all this be, if they were proper members when first baptized?</P>
<P>Again, he says. <HI>p.</HI> 3. "God's covenant people both under the old and new testament had no war∣rant to make any exceptions or limitations, under any circumstances or upon any pretence whatever." And again, <HI>p.</HI> 16. "no person, church or power on earth, can lawfully dispense with such an atten∣dance." <HI>viz.</HI> on the Lord's-supper. And yet he of∣fered to make exceptions and limitations. Yea, he proposed to the church to pass an <HI>actual vote</HI> to dis∣pense with candidates in case of scruple, if they would verbally consent to be called members in full communion. What a direct inconsistency is here? yea, he further supposes, that persons in the dark may <HI>lawfully</HI> stay away. And yet at the same time calls them renouncers, refusers, habitual neglecters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and not to be tolerated, lest we be partakers of other men's sins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Again, he supposes all over his book, that those who act upon my plan, are <HI>unconverted;</HI> he taxes them with "<HI>habitual and continual disobedience</HI> to the ex∣press command of Christ:" <HI>p.</HI> 57. and yet says, the command was <HI>never</HI> given to <HI>them,</HI> but to others, <HI>viz.</HI> "to true disciples" or believers <HI>only. p.</HI> 45, 6.—Que∣ry, how can persons be taxed with disobedience to a command, that was never given to them? is it not an eternal rule, that where there is no law there is no transgression? those indeed to whom the com∣mand is given may be guilty of disobedience, but those to whom it is not given are no more concerned in it than if there was no command at all. How does he here relax the bonds of duty from the neck of
<PB N="48" REF="012739_0045_0F8BEAC2E1EBF9A8"/>sinners? if the command indeed were given to the <HI>visible church,</HI> then all neglecters are guilty, but if the command only reaches <HI>invisible members,</HI> then it is they only that must plead guilty or not guilty, all others have nothing to do with it. He may as well say, that infants are guilty of the breach of this com∣mand.</P>
<P>Again, Mr. <HI>R.</HI> asserts, that <HI>saving blessings</HI> are no more (no not so much as conditionally) sealed to the children of the faithful, if unconverted, than to <HI>jews, deists and mahometans:</HI> p. 43. and yet he owns that there are <HI>gracious promises</HI> all over the bible con∣cerning such. <HI>p.</HI> 48.</P>
<P>Further he says, "that owning the covenant is one of the <HI>greatest</HI> and <HI>most solemn</HI> transactions on this side death," and that "coming to the Lord's table is a <HI>lesser</HI> transaction:" <HI>p.</HI> 36. and yet, that persons equally own the covenant every time they come, as much as they did at first. The same he says of other covenant transactions. <HI>p.</HI> 6. How then can there be any <HI>greater</HI> or <HI>lesser</HI> in the case? or is it a lesser trans∣action to own the covenant in <HI>deed</HI> than in <HI>words?</HI> would it be deemed a greater thing to <HI>accept</HI> a prince's invitation to dinner, than the <HI>actual dining</HI> with him?</P>
<P>Again, Mr. <HI>R.</HI> says, that baptized persons have forfeited their right, if they do not come to the Lord's-table, and that they ought to be censured; and yet will not suffer them to come, if he thinks them unqualified, let them be ever so inoffensive. unhappy case, that they must neither come nor not come.</P>
<P>Again, he durst not defend Dr. <HI>Bellamy's</HI> doc∣trine, "that for a natural man to pretend to own the covenant, was to sin against God in a more provoking manner, than if he had committed drunkenness, fornication, and adultry." (Essays, <HI>p.</HI> 68.) I say, he durst not defend this in direct terms, because he knew it would render him obnoxion to his own party: yet he holds the same thing in effect all over his book. Why will not men honestly speak out, but conceal themselves in a shade?</P>
<P>Again, he prayed against me and preached against me for the exposition I gave of the text; <HI>Jer.</HI> iii. 14.
<PB N="49" REF="012739_0046_0F8BEAC385A626D8"/>and seems still surprized at it: while at the same time he expounds the text exactly as I did, name∣ly, that it was an address to the whole visible church collectively considered, without any regard to their inward gracious state. <HI>p.</HI> 55. This is the very thing I aimed at, and indeed all that was necessary to establish my point, though perhaps not so fully expressed as it might have been. The address for certain included both regenerates and unregenerates, though very few of the former sort among them at that time: they were generally corrupt; yet had not lost their membership re∣ceived in infancy. This Mr. <HI>R.</HI> would not then al∣low of, but led his people to think by his prayers and preaching, that the words were directed to true believers and to them only, and not to the whole church in general including unregenerates. But now he turns directly about, and fully joyns with me, and yet continues to fault me. How sur∣prising is this?</P>
<P>Further, he taxes me with leaving the original plan of the fathers; and yet dissents from them as well as we: he pretends to honor them, yet leaves them. He differs from them in several particulars, two especially.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1st. In not making relations necessary.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. In implicitly bearing down the practice of ge∣neral owning the covenant, which is certainly de∣structive of his scheme.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Lastly, he taxes me with using passionate excla∣mations to gain my point. And hath he not pas∣sionate exclamations all over his book! Are they not interspersed everywhere? see particularly from <HI>p.</HI> 23—26. and <HI>p.</HI> 32—35.</P>
<P>Thus I have presented the reader "with a brief sketch" of the blunderata and inconsistencies that abound in his book: "it would be endless to fol∣low him in all." May I not justly then conclude the head with his own words, which are much more applicable to him than to me. <HI>p.</HI> 41. <Q>Truth is always consistent; therefore when a person ad∣vances any scheme or position, and in his argu∣ments to support it, is inconsistent with himself,
<PB N="50" REF="012739_0047_0F8BEAC4356BDF70"/>it affords, at least, a strong presumption that his scheme or position is not true. Whether Mr. <HI>R.</HI> has not fallen into this difficulty in attempting to support his scheme, I do, after pointing out these things (with others elsewhere) leave the reader to judge.</Q></P>
<P>I now proceed to the</P>
<P N="2">II. General HEAD, namely, to consider and ans∣wer his objections, especially those contained in the first part of his reply. I would observe here in general, that I do not find any new objections in this place, which I had not before considered, but only the old expatiated and recited at greater length, but not with more clearness than before. His policy here is remarkable in treating the sub∣ject in a large declamatory diffusive way in order to captivate the vulgar, and even using "passion∣ate exclamations." But this method will not take with men of thought and penetration. Such up∣on the re-perusal of my book will find the main objections fully obviated already. But yet for the sake of others. I think it necessary to take some no∣tice of his main pleas. His</P>
<P N="1">1st. Objection is, "that there is no text in the whole word of God to justify the practice, nor any example to warrant it." <HI>p.</HI> 3. How exactly does this tally with the words of an <HI>anabaptist</HI> writer quoted by <HI>Ursin?</HI> <Q>no opinion is to be received, whereof we have neither express commandment or apparent example in the scripture: but there is no commandment or example extant in scrip∣ture for baptizing infants: wherefore the bap∣tizing of infants is not to be permitted in the church." To which <HI>Ursin</HI> answers, "God com∣mandeth that all be baptized of what age, sex, condition or state soever, which pertain to the covenant and the church, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> p. 419. This is full to the point; and it coming from one of Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s authorities (though it seems at second hand) I hope it will have the more weight with him. Can he then say, that there are no texts to justify the practice? are not those sufficient for that purpose, that prove the membership of the persons in ques∣tion?
<PB N="51" REF="012739_0048_0F8BEAC4FAD25D68"/>for if members themselves, their children are certainly so too, (according to the divine constituti∣on, <HI>Gen.</HI> xvii.) and so are intitled to the seal. This is as strong and conclusive a way of arguing as we can possibly have for infant baptism; and indeed it is the main ground. And if he rejects it as in∣sufficient, he must necessarily become an <HI>anabaptist;</HI> not only joining with them in requiring an express text, but in all parts of their scheme.</P>
<P>Further, he says there is no <HI>example.</HI> I think we have a direct example in the case of <HI>lepers,</HI> which were (in most cases) excluded the passover for life, were they ever so gracious inwardly; yet their chil∣dren were not excluded circumcision. And when∣ever a person was otherwise legally unclean, his attendence on the passover was dispensed with; but still his children were to be circumcised. The case is plain, the first seal was <HI>never</HI> to be omitted on any account whatever, where the parents were in coven∣ant; but the other seal was often omitted or dispens∣ed with upon incidental accounts, and the two seals were frequently divided. An example that I do not think unlawful for us to follow. If Mr. <HI>R.</HI> should say, that this <HI>legal uncleanness</HI> (which is excluded from the passover) typified <HI>moral uncleanness</HI> under the gospel; which ought to exclude equally now. What would be the consequence of such an asserti∣on? why, that <HI>moral uncleanness</HI> is a sufficient bar from coming to the Lord's-supper, but not from bringing their children to baptism, if they are visi∣bly in covenant; as <HI>legal uncleanness</HI> debared from the second seal, but not from the first. And let them take the consequence to themselves, if they argue thus, (as Mr <HI>Edwards</HI> and Dr. <HI>Bellamy</HI> actually do) It is their's, and not mine, though I can not see how they can get over it.</P>
<P>Another objection is, the <HI>indispensibleness</HI> of the com∣mand, <HI>do this, &amp;c.</HI> This is repeated over and over, and seems his <HI>all in all,</HI> though I cannot see with what face he can plead it, when he actually offer∣ed to dispense with the command upon certain conditions. A dispensation is as allowable upon our scheme as his. And for my part I must ac∣knowlege,
<PB N="52" REF="012739_0049_0F8BEAC5D42282B0"/>that <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>positive</HI> precepts always appeared to me in a very different light. The latter have been often dispensed with, but the former never. The scripture abounds with instances of such dispensations.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Suspending the passover and circumcision in the wilder∣ness seems only a prudential of the church, upon the account of their <HI>travelling circumstances,</HI> as divines think. If God had particularly commanded it, it would no doubt have been recorded, as <HI>Moses</HI> sets down commands for very minute things, as about fringes, the paddle, &amp;c. And if churches may upon occasion, and as particular cir∣cumstances occur, suspend a <HI>general</HI> attendance, they may as well suspend a <HI>particular</HI> one. Instances of such ge∣neral suspension of the Lord's-supper has been known in our days even for years, not only when a church has been without a pastor, but also when in divided broken circum∣stances.</NOTE> And if particular persons, through mistakes or scruples, deprive themselves of the benefit of <HI>positive institutions,</HI> I dare not con∣demn them to the pit of hell upon that account. St. <HI>Austin's</HI> saying is most true, <HI>not the want, but the contempt of ordinances condemneth.</HI> And that saying of other divines is equally true, <HI>that these special ordi∣nances serve not for the being, but the well being of a christi∣an.</HI> The <HI>habitual</HI> wilful <HI>neglect</HI> of them is certainly a very heinous sin; but if persons having a <HI>due value</HI> for such institutions, are kept away merely from fears that they have not the befitting and requisite qualifications, this I look upon rather as an <HI>infirmity,</HI> than a damnable offence.</P>
<P>Again, it is objected, "that this practice is of a very bad and dangerous tendency," and that it par∣ticularly, "tends to promote a careless secure spirit in candidates." <HI>p.</HI> 8.—QUERY, whether those places where the practice is not allowed, have fewer in propotion of this secure careless spirit than the places where it is received? let him ask the mini∣sters, and they will tell him the reverse: the pre∣vailing security then must not be ascribed to this practice. And let him ask them further, whether they have not reason to think, that many whom
<PB N="53" REF="012739_0050_0F8BEAC68A9B31D8"/>they have not over great charity for, have upon this very account come up in full, that otherwise would not, merely to get their children baptized.</P>
<P>I observed in my second Essay, <HI>p.</HI> 20. That mini∣sters refusing to receive them upon this plan, and yet urging them to come in full, had a much great∣er tendency to promote this secure spirit. To this he deigns not a word of answer. I would now ob∣serve further, that in the course of my ministry, I never found <HI>one</HI> under conviction (among the many scores I conversed with) whose conscience pricked them merely for not owning the covenant, but it was for their neglect of the Lord's-supper; and to that many seemed earnestly desirous of fly∣ing as an <HI>asylum,</HI> to get ease to their wounded spirits. And if they are admitted to that, there is much more danger of their resting there, than if they had only owned the covenant. In short, this objection and what is said under it, bewrays to me too much <HI>unacquaintedness</HI> or <HI>experience</HI> of the work∣ings of the human mind under conviction, and is rather matter of theory than reality.</P>
<P>Again, he says, that <HI>John's</HI> baptism was not of such latitude as we plead for; but was confined to professing penitents. I answer, if he will be as large in administring baptism, as <HI>John</HI> was, there are none I believe but would be content. The text says, <HI>all Judea and Jerusalem went out to him, and were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins. Matt.</HI> iii. 5, 6. Will Mr. <HI>R.</HI> baptize any merely on such confession? no, says he; promises of amendment are implied, through the assistance of divine grace. Well, let it be so (though the words do not directly imply it) all would be content still. Would he bap∣tize them or their children now? no, they must make a profession of <HI>saving repentance.</HI> Well, but how can they profess it without they <HI>knew</HI> they had it! would he have them lye, or declare more than they know? no; it is sufficient for them to say, that as far as they knew their own hearts they were sincere in <HI>confessing their sins,</HI> &amp;c. If he would receive them now, where is the difference between him and me? It appears to me, that all <HI>John</HI> holds forth when he
<PB N="54" REF="012739_0051_0F8BEAC74363C088"/><HI>preached the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins,</HI> was, that repentance was necessary in order to par∣take of the <HI>saving mercies</HI> of the covenant, or to ob∣tain the <HI>spiritual good</HI> held forth in baptism; and that it cannot be justly inferred from anything that is said, that he thought they were all real penitents whom he baptized: yea, the direct contrary appears, for he himself intimates, that many of them were but <HI>cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fy professors</HI> (as afterwards appeared). And therefore he exhorts them to exercise gospel repent∣ance, and not to rest merely in the outward privi∣lege, lest their baptism should be of no avail. I would observe further, that <HI>John</HI> does not erect a new church (the gospel church was not erected till some time after) but seems to baptize them as mem∣bers already, or as part of the standing church of the <HI>jews:</HI> and it does not appear, neither is it pro∣bable, that he rejected any that came, though he gave a severe reproof to some sorts.</P>
<P>Further he objects, that we place too great a dis∣tinction between baptism and the Lord's-supper. I answer; this, the other side are especially guilty of, who would not allow baptized persons any pri∣vilege at all; whereas if they will but come to the Lord's-supper, all privileges are their's and their children's forever.</P>
<P>A like objection is, that "I make <HI>lower qualificati∣ons</HI> necessary for baptism than for the Lord's-sup∣per, which is quite wrong." <HI>p.</HI> 48, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He ought rather to have said <HI>lower dagrees</HI> of the same quali∣fications. And is not this reasonable? certainly stronger language may be expected from <HI>grown men</HI> than from <HI>mere babes;</HI> from those that have had some <HI>experience,</HI> than form those that are just come to the <HI>birth.</HI> To be sure they can give a more full and satisfactory evidence of their being in Christ after some experience, than when first born into the world of grace. And in some cases their lives have been so notorious, that though baptism can∣not be denied to them when they come to us, as they did to <HI>John, confessing their sins;</HI> yet it would not be proper immediately to receive them to the Lord's-table. And the same may be said respecting
<PB N="55" REF="012739_0052_0F8BEAC7F5C52EB8"/>persons grosly ignorant; when they come to know the fundamentals of religion, that there is a Savi∣our, and justification through him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and appear to receive it cordially, they are intitled to baptism: yet they ought not to be received to the other or∣dinance, till better and more fully instructed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We find a plain distinction made between the <HI>spouse</HI> and <HI>the daughters of Jerusalem.</HI> Cant. v. and 6. though both within the pale of the church. The one were admitted to full privileges, the other not so—which seems to give a direct warrant to our practice.</P>
<P>Further, it is said, what signifies it to be so stre∣nuous in the affair? what good will baptism do their children, if they be not good themselves? it may be of some advantage indeed as to this world; it may take away their reproach. But of what advantage in the sight of God? as they come with∣out his leave, so they will be sent away with∣out his blessing; the baptism of such being a <HI>mere nullity</HI> with him, <HI>p.</HI> 48. This objection suggests a question of weighty moment, what the real situa∣tion of a baptized child is, whose parent is unre∣generate let him be a communicant or otherwise? I have already endeavored to disprove such a bap∣tism's being a mere nullity. But of what real ad∣vantage is it? I answer, much every way; if it be not a <HI>nullity</HI> it must be <HI>something, i. e.</HI> answer some valuable end, and be of real use to the child. Sup∣posing Mr. <HI>R.</HI> were <HI>right,</HI> that the <HI>promises</HI> were made only to the invisible church; yet God may fulfil them to the child for their pious grand pa∣rents sake, or for the sake of some other godly pro∣genitor (as was the case of king <HI>Josiah</HI>) for the pro∣mise runs to a thousand generations. But if Mr. <HI>R.</HI> be <HI>wrong,</HI> as I think has been proved, and the <HI>pro∣mise</HI> mentioned, <HI>Act.</HI> ii. 39. respects the church visi∣ble, it may reach such a child as much as if his parents were really godly; and he has as good a right to plead it, as an argument for converting grace, as the child of the best saint living. He hath been received into the church according to divine rules, and therefore hath ground to ask for
<PB N="56" REF="012739_0053_0F8BEAC8B44F8E48"/>divine blessings, as one of God's covenant children. Yea, I may add, that God may, and no doubt often does, bless the ordinance to a child, as being <HI>his own institution,</HI> though not for the parent's sake; as common means are often blest to sinners that use them, as being means of God's appointment, though not for the sinners sake. <HI>Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord, be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel, but for my own name sake.</HI> Ezek. xxxvi, 22, 32. <HI>i. e.</HI> He does it for his own honor, and that he may grace his own institutions, without any regard to the sinner.</P>
<P>Again, he objects, that both ordinances are <HI>equal∣ly solemn;</HI> and asks upon it, why fears and scruples do not operate as strongly to keep from the one as from the other; especially since owning the cove∣nant (which is previous) is a <HI>solemner thing</HI> than both. <HI>p.</HI> 36. The absurdity of the latter clause of the ob∣jection has been already taken notice of. Let me answer to the first part; supposing it to be the case, that the two ordinances are equally solemn, is there not something in human nature, that of∣ten reluets (or is terrified) at one duty, yet not at another, though equally solemn? and is Mr. <HI>R.</HI> so little acquainted with the workings of the hu∣man mind, as not to know it? it is really as solemn a thing in itself considered, to approach Gord's throne in <HI>secret of family devotions,</HI> as at the Lord's-supper: And yet Mr. <HI>R.</HI> would not himself won∣der, that some will venture to <HI>pray,</HI> and yet not venture to the Lord's-supper. An unaccountable fear, which they cannot shake off, may often pre∣possess the mind, and sway it to forbear in one in∣stance; yet have no effect in another case, though nearly parallel. It is a minister's duty to endea∣vor to dispel such fears (if groundless) in the course of his ministration in the pulpit, and not to knock them down at one blow by votes and prescription and penalties, which certainly never yet enlight∣ened one soul.</P>
<P>Again, it is objected, that if we plead the exam∣ple of the jewish church it proves <HI>too much,</HI> that <HI>scandalous persons</HI> ought to be admitted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which
<PB N="57" REF="012739_0054_0F8BEACB021854C8"/>we will not allow of. <HI>p.</HI> 19.—I answer, it does not prove <HI>too much;</HI> for scandalous persons are allowed privileges now as well as then if in the same circum∣stances, that is, supposing those that are acquaint∣ed with the scandal do not complain of them, and get them regularly convicted: for the church ought to look upon none of their members as scandalous, till such conviction takes place. All are innocent in the eye of the law or gospel, till guilt be proved upon them; and if those who are witnesses of the guilt will not appear against them, the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ult lies at their, and not at the church's door. The church must receive them still and allow them privileges, whether they be communicants, or only owners of the covenant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This observation enervates se∣veral of the arguments of those on the opposite side of the question.</P>
<P>Again, he urges very strenuously, and for many pages, that it is much better to have the <HI>greater part</HI> of the country unbaptized, yea, and brought into a state of perfect <HI>heathenism,</HI> than to have this practice continued. <HI>p</HI> 22. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In answer to this, I would desire him to read once more my quotati∣on from Mr. <HI>Mitchell,</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssays, <HI>p.</HI> 4, 5) and to do it prayerfully and with attention; and if it does not make his heartake; I would have him for the future forbear to tax his neighbors with <HI>callous consciences</HI> (<HI>p.</HI> 59.) And to what he has said I would add, that we have all the reason in the world to think, that christianity would have been long since intirely root∣ed out of the <HI>Greek churches</HI> (which have been groan∣ing so many hundred years under the <HI>mahometan</HI> yoke) had it not been for these <HI>external badges.</HI> But the use of them hath kept it alive, no doubt, to the benefit and salvation of many souls: But says Mr. <HI>R.</HI> (or rather Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>) <HI>"we must not do evil, that good may come."</HI> I answer, neither he or Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> have yet proved it to be evil. I would also subjoin. Dr. <HI>I. Mather</HI>'s weighty words in his <HI>first principles of New-England,</HI> relating to this point. (<HI>pref. p.</HI> 4.) <Q>Brethren, one word let me in the bowels of the Lord say to you, and I speak it
<PB N="58" REF="012739_0055_0F8BEACC3B8866F8"/>not with a desire to grieve or offend any of you, but if my heart deceive me not, love to Christ and to you, and to the succeeding generations in <HI>New-England,</HI> causeth me to speak it; it is only this, <HI>Oh tremble! lest this very error of yours prove the breaking and the ruin of your poor posterity.</HI> Truly, when I think (and I often think of it) seriously and sadly with myself, that in a plantation of religion (for such <HI>New-England</HI> was) the generali∣ty of the inhabitants should be in the condition of <HI>infidels;</HI> that the posterity of a people profess∣ing godliness, yea, of the most eminent professors in the whole world, should in our age be as <HI>in∣fidels,</HI> even not so much as within the compass of the visible church, or have the livery and character belonging to christians upon them, whereby such are distinguished from the <HI>infidel,</HI> and <HI>pagan world:</HI> what it has to others I know not, but to me it has a most formidable appearance.</Q></P>
<P>Again, he lugs in the doctrine of <HI>human depravity</HI> as overthrown by this practice, and makes great use of it in his letter and elsewhere. This shews what shifts they are reduced to, to support their scheme. I boldly assert, that it is a bare-faced im∣position. But of this, more elsewhere.</P>
<P>Another objection or imposition near a kin to this is, that it must "surely be a bad cause that is de∣fended with such weapons" as I use. <HI>p.</HI> 51. But what are these weapons? why <HI>Arminian</HI> ones. This is not true, (as will appear presently:) but sup∣posing it was, are not <HI>arminian</HI> weapons as good as <HI>immoral</HI> ones? is the cause of Christ to be support∣ed by scandalous advertisments in the public prints? by malicious scurrilous libels posted up at market-places or droped in the streets? by the most un∣grounded misrepresentations? by all the low arts and methods of artifice that could be devised? and even by ransacking the graves of the dead, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If Mr. <HI>R.</HI> can (either in whole or in part) clean himself from these, can he clear some that he looks upon as his <HI>best friends</HI> and the greatest pro∣moters of his cause? I dare say the whole town are convinced from what quarter these must come.
<PB N="59" REF="012739_0056_0F8BEACC9FCF7690"/>And the hand-writing of one of them (however disguised) can be produced against him. But enough of this for the present.</P>
<P>Lastly, another objection of the like sort is his outcry. <HI>p.</HI> 32. "That it was as <HI>dark a day</HI> with re∣spect to religion as almost ever was known in this town, when this practice was brought in," <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Such a dark time it seems was the properest to in∣troduce such a dark practice. But was it such a dark day, when the <HI>Synod</HI> introduced it, most of the first fathers of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> being then alive; and when some of their churches were in the practice before? And as for the time he speaks of, let him ask the elderly people, and they will all tell him, that it was not near so dark a time in regard to religion as it is now: there was much more vi∣tal piety appearing; there was more religious conference and exemplary walking; religious meetings were frequent, the minister almost constant∣ly attending; there was a standing society of religious young people: (how do all these fail at present!) family religion and government much more pre∣vailed, and immoralities did not so abound as at this day. And how comes it to pass, that in these <HI>darkest</HI> of days, more <HI>light</HI> should spring up than in the former period? or does the light all center in Mr. <HI>R</HI>—'s breast? for the people were generally easy under the practice, till his attempt to super∣sede it. Here we see what mean and low methods he takes to prejudice the present generation against the cause, as also in the rest of the para∣graph, which I shall not transcribe.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A report has been raised and propagated by some of them, that Mr. <HI>Leonard</HI> in his "lively days" (there spoken of) <HI>repented</HI> that he had ever brought in the practice.

<P>In contrast to this, I would set what Dr. <HI>I. Mather</HI> says, <HI>pref. p.</HI> 2, 3. <Q>It is a good observation. says he, which Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> hath in his letter to Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> where he argueth, that the way of the rigid seperation is not of God, because those
<PB N="60" REF="012739_0057_0F8BEACD3597D940"/>who in simplicity and tenderness of conscience have been drawn into the error of that way; yet when they have grown in grace, they have also grown to discern the error of the seperation. The same (says Dr. <HI>M.</HI>) we may say in this case, some who did once conscienciously and humbly, according to their present light, dissent from the late <HI>Synods,</HI> yet as they have grown in <HI>wisdom</HI> and <HI>grace,</HI> and <HI>ripeness</HI> for Heaven, the Lord hath given them for to see, that their <HI>rigidity</HI> in this particular was a failing.</Q> And particularly as to himself, how does he intimate the same thing in that pathetic address to other dissenters? <Q>Bre∣thern (says he) I was once of your persuasion; but study and prayer and much affliction hath brought me to be of another belief than once! was.</Q> (<HI>preface.</HI> p. 1.)</P>

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>I now come to the</P>
<P N="3">III. Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al HEAD, to consider his manner of treat∣ing me both in relation to the general, and par∣ticular controversy.</P>
<P>IN general we may observe the method of his book. He first lays down arguments in proof of his plan; then considers them in objections, taking but little or no notice of me all this while, as if none of these objections were found in the Essay, but were found out by his own sagacity. And when he comes to speak of the Essays, it seems he finds nothing in them but a heap of ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bles and inconsistencies, of misrepresensations and unjust charges, scarce wor∣thy of his notice. In this contemptuous manner he treats me. And with the like contempt he hath treated me in his letters and otherwise during this controversy. And the same sort of treatment I had much experience of, during the first seven years of his ministry, as the whole parish do know, if they would testify, which gave great offence in the time of it. Of these things more hereafter.</P>
<P>But with respect to the <HI>general controversy.</HI> Here are three sections, which I shall consider distinct∣ly. I begin with his 4th SECTION from <HI>p.</HI> 28, to <HI>p.</HI> 41.</P>
<P>He first says, <HI>p.</HI> 28. "I stated the question rightly, whether the <HI>half way practice</HI> of admitting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" I never stated the question so It is an abomination to me. The phrase half practice, half members, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is entirely his own, and what he imported from <HI>Connecticut.</HI> It was never known or thought of in these parts, till he introduced it. And the first coiners of the phrase (who they were God knows) did it out of politic views: it being a common me∣thod, when any have a mind to run down a cause, to brand it with some odious <HI>nick-name.</HI> This is the
<PB N="62" REF="012739_0059_0F8BEAD3AE7A4CD8"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> here. The phrase in my apprehension in∣volves so much venom and malignity in it, that it is strange any christian should use it.</P>
<P>"The question being thus rightly stated (says he) I quickly ramble from it, and endeavor to estab∣lish another point." But how does he prove it? not by following me argument by argument, but by culling out a passage here and there, without regarding what preceeded or followed. First a short passage (Essay 1st) <HI>p.</HI> 2. and then flying to <HI>p.</HI> 12. (Essay 2d.) I desire the reader to look into both those pages, and they will plainly see how he abuses me. These passages are, "neither does Christ so much as intimate that they were graci∣ous thereby letting us know, that it is visible mem∣bership gives the right." "From whence we may infer that it is not contrary to the mind of God, that the children of persons unregenerate should have this ordinance administred to them, if their parents be in covenant relation to him." What do these expressions import more than this, that God expects and requires that his church treat all those that are visibly in covenant with him as proper members of his church, whether regene∣rate or no, as long as they behave well. Does not Mr. <HI>R.</HI> hold this as well as I? and hath he not se∣veral passages to the like purpose? for he acknow∣leges, that we have nothing to do with the heart. This first passage then being the only ramble he accuses me of in the 1st. Essay, and the second the only one in the 2d. Essay, (all comprized within the compass of 5 lines:) surely all the rest must be to the point. Why then does not he attempt to answer it? as surely he has not done. For my part, upon reviewing the piece, it appears to me, that instead of flying from the point, I stick close∣ly to it. And here by the way, I would observe how easy it is to answer any book whatsoever, if it is sufficient to pick out a passage or scrap here and there (leaving out what preceeded or follow∣ed) and then rack and mangle it to speak what they please. A man may go on answering to eter∣nity at this rate.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="012739_0060_0F8BEAD3F7C01070"/>
<HI>P.</HI> 30. He states the question anew for me "whe∣ther it is warrantable from scripture for persons to own the covenant, and have baptism for their children, while they <HI>neglect</HI> to attend the other or∣dinance" This is as wrong a stating it as the other. If he can prove, that the candidates <HI>neglect, i. e.</HI> slight and contemn the ordinance of the supper, let them in God's name be kept off. This I ob∣serve is his common phrase, not only in his title page, but throughout his whole book, to inflame people against me; sometimes the word <HI>neglect</HI> only is used; sometimes <HI>habitual neglect</HI> (which is stronger still;) sometimes <HI>renounce, refuse, &amp;c.</HI> Sometimes it is <HI>allowed neglect and violation,</HI> a <HI>continu∣ed neglect</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How can he tell that it will be a <HI>continued neglect,</HI> when first admitted? most of those at <HI>Halifax,</HI> that owned the covenant, soon came into full communion. And as for those that have long continued in this neglect among us (some of them for many years) why does not he preach to them? why does he not call them to account? why does he not treat them as <HI>wicked persons?</HI> (as he must do according to his principles.) So far from this, that he calls them <HI>members in full communion,</HI> baptizes their children; yea, gives them the character of <HI>exemplary</HI> christians; (justly I trust as to most of them, but inconsistently as to himself.)</NOTE> (always the strongest expressions he could invent) Yea, it comes at last to be down∣right wickedness. <HI>p.</HI> 57. Thus blinding people with a notion, that I was for opening the door to the worst of sinners. But how does he alter his tone, when he comes to speak of his candidates whom he would dispense with. There he can suppose, that the persons have <HI>a high value</HI> for the ordinance even <HI>too</HI> high; and that all the dif∣ficulty lies in their doubts and fears whether they are duely qualified for so sacred and solemn an institution. What partiality is here. What bu∣siness has he to treat candidates upon my scheme as <HI>neglecters and contemners,</HI> and the others as <HI>over∣valuers</HI> of the ordinance. Is this the charity that believeth all things, hopeth all things. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Is there
<PB N="64" REF="012739_0061_0F8BEAD4B8398248"/>not as much ground to treat the one gently as the other.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 32, 35. He hath "a long string" of Texts to prove, that <HI>universal obedience</HI> is necessary in order to denominate a person a disciple, a friend of Christ, a christian or believer, <HI>&amp;c</HI> And therefore if they do not come to the Lords-table, they cannot, and ought not to have any of these denominations however regular in other respects "If any, says he, teaches that such are visible friends of Christ, they teach for doctrine the commandments of men." "This is the test, the touch stone, the mark. by which you are to ground your charity." "Without this, says Christ, you are none of mine." "To assert the contrary is to oppose and contra∣dict Christ." "The obedience of such persons is but a pretence, their discipleship good for nothing." "They have no right to be treated as disciples." "These words will forever stand as a barr against admitting persons, who walk not in all the institu∣ted ordinances of Christ." "We have no right to call persons <HI>visible christians,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If <HI>baptized</HI> persons are not so much as <HI>visible christians,</HI> why is he so offended at calling the <HI>unbaptized, heathens?</HI> he taxes me with <HI>wickedness</HI> on this account. See <HI>Es∣says.</HI> p. <HI>37.</HI></NOTE> or grant them spe∣cial privileges, but those that obey that positive command of Christ, <HI>do this,</HI> &amp;c." And innumer∣able other passages of the like nature. And yet, to our amazement, after all this group of expressions; and after he had further declared, "that we find no warrant for any exception in the word of God, let the plea for it be what it will," he comes at length to grant, in direct contradiction to all he had said, that it is "<HI>often</HI> the case that real good christians may be under such scruples, under such doubts and fears, as to deter them from the Lord's-supper, and yet see their way clear to offer their children to baptism. <HI>p.</HI> 38. And all possible tenderness, he grants, is to be used towards such." And what do we desire more? if he would act accordingly there would be an end of the controversy.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="012739_0062_0F8BEAD580A58700"/>
But such scruples are not to be indulged. Why? because they arise from <HI>wrong notions. p.</HI> 38. For my part, I think in many cases they are justly grounded, if our opponent's plan be right. What can be more natural than such reasonings as these? "it is a plain command it is true, <HI>do this,</HI> &amp;c. But to whom is this command given? to believers, real disciples, not to sinners while such. <HI>p.</HI> 46. Am I then a believer? it is true, I have some hopes; I have had some experience of a law and gospel work upon my soul; I have seen something of the evil of sin, and my need of Christ, and my soul longs for an interest in him. But may not this be only a <HI>common work?</HI> have not sinners great convictions and illuminations? do they not cry out with <HI>Pharaoh and Saul, I have sinned?</HI> do they not so hunger and thirst as to cry, <HI>Lord ever more give us this bread? give us of the waters of life?</HI> have they not <HI>tasted of the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come?</HI> do they not hear the gospel calls <HI>with joy?</HI> I dare not upon any account say, that my experi∣ences are of a <HI>saving kind;</HI> I rather fear, that I am only a stony ground hearer. What shall I do? if I come, and am really such a one, I shall only profane the ordinance; I come as an unbidden guest; the ordinance is not for me; I shall be "guilty of a greater sin than drunkenness, forni∣cation and adultery. It is much better therefore for me to stay, till I have clearer evidences. This is certainly safest; as coming in hypocrisy (as must be the case if I be unregenerate) is worse than not coming at all." Such reasonings as these, I do not see how the best casuist among them can get over, or duely solve, without warping and bending their plan to suit every case.</P>
<P>As for the intimation, "that such scruples chief∣ly arise from this half-way practice." <HI>p.</HI> 38. It is intirely groundless. It is the natural consequence of the plan. And it is certain, that such scruples as much or more prevailed, when what Mr. <HI>R.</HI> calls "the <HI>original plan</HI>" was in vogue, than even at this day. For if they had not been generally
<PB N="66" REF="012739_0063_0F8BEAD7C8C27E20"/>prevalent in the days of our <HI>fathers,</HI> the genera court would never have called a <HI>synod</HI> to consider what was to be done in the case.</P>
<P>As for the supposition, <HI>p.</HI> 37. of a person's com∣ing demand the Lord's-supper before he was baptized; it is so absurd and weak, that I am al∣most ashamed to mention it. It is like a person's demanding meat and drink, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fore he was born, or before he had a being. The one supposition is as natural as the other. But if he must be argued with, let me tell him, that text would forever stand as a barr. <HI>Exod.</HI> xii. 48.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 38. Mr. <HI>R.</HI> accuses me of "frequently appealing to the <HI>decisions</HI> of men." The occasion of it was, be∣cause I had said, "The Church hath in all ages been larger in admitting to baptism than to the Lord's-supper." I think there is somewhat in the observation, though we are not to be certainly de∣termined by their opinion; but must go to the law and to the testimony. But if I was to be swayed by human authority, I had much rather make the <HI>universal church</HI> my standard, than either Dr. <HI>B.</HI> or Mr. <HI>R.</HI> especially since they are so fluctuating in their opinions. I would observe here, that Mr. <HI>R.</HI> is quite as ready to fly to human authority as I, when he thinks it makes for him: the instances of it in his book are numerous; and even in his letter, does he not have recourse to human authority? what a stress does he there lay on the authority of the WOMEN? It seems to be the chief argument in that epistle; "I question, says he, whether you have 4 women in the whole church with you;" and this he "thinks matter of weighty consideration in the affair." (Essays, <HI>p.</HI> 35.) I never-knew before but that the authority of <HI>men,</HI> was as <HI>decisive</HI> as that of <HI>women,</HI> especially of women the most part of whom had never heard or read any thing about the affair. But to leave trifting, I doubt not but that he thinks it somewhat in the <HI>ante-poedobaptist</HI> controversy, that their opinion is novel, and was never heard of in the christian church till about 200 years ago. So that even according to him, it is lawful to mention hu∣man authority, or "the decisions of men" sometimes,
<PB N="67" REF="012739_0064_0F8BEAD8B2DB7478"/>in way of illustration or collateral proof. As for the piece of history that follows, (for he must shew himself an historian as well as divine) I am certain he is mistaken: in the primitive church, they were admitted as <HI>catachumens,</HI> long before they were bap∣tized; and they were for the most part baptized (especially if <HI>gentiles</HI> before) sometime before they were confirmed; though in several instances, where the candidate appeared a great proficient, as in the case of <HI>Ambrose</HI> and others, baptism and confirmati∣on immediately followed one the other.</P>
<P>In <HI>p.</HI> 38, 9. he says, "That I certainly intimate in many places, that the <HI>same essential</HI> qualifications were not necessary for the one ordinance as the other." Where this certain intimation appears, I know not: all that they can justly infer from my words is, that the church need not be so strict res∣pecting candidates for baptism as for the Lords-sup∣per; but if there be the lowest degree of proba∣bility, or but a <HI>possibility</HI> of their being gracious, though they have many fears about them, they ought not to be excluded, in case they ask this pri∣vilege for their children. The one is a sacrament of entrance, the other of growth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The worst of sinners, if they appear penitent to the church, ought to be immediately baptized. But in some cases it would not be so advisable to re∣ceive him directly to the Lord's-supper. The most ignorant of <HI>heathens</HI> may be taught enough in an hours time, and he may appear to receive it so cor∣dially, that he may be intitled to baptism; yet not have knowlege enough to be received immediately to the Lord's-supper.</P>
<P>In the next page, he observes that "the first settlers in <HI>New-England</HI> allowed this privilege to none but the children of communicants." And in many other places he says, that "this practice is contrary to the <HI>original plan</HI> upon which these church∣es were settled." <HI>p.</HI> 1. 53. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> How he durst so bold∣ly affirm this I know not: I am sure with respect to <HI>Plymouth</HI> church he asserts it intirely by guess; for there are no church records extant but what were written after my grandfather's settlement in
<PB N="68" REF="012739_0065_0F8BEAD9C1B5D9D8"/>1667. And no account of their practice in this particular in their early days; nor any account of their sentiments at all except what makes against Mr. <HI>R.</HI> The ministers and elders weekly cate∣chising and instructing, putting questions, and preaching or expounding the principles of religi∣on to the children of the church, and training them up for the Lords-supper; their dealing with them as members as much as the communicants; their admitting them to covenant more than once, in a body, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are all contrary to modern example, and inconsistent with present principles or practices. It is certain there is nothing in the church records, that directly militates with this practice, and we may with great propriety put the question here, that has been so often put at this day, <HI>"who was ever denied?"</HI> can he produce an instance of one baptized person that applied, and was refused, either in a general or particular manner? nothing surely can be inferred from a church's forbearing the practice, what their real principle was about it; it might be owing to none's applying, and not to principle. I might add, that there are some passages in Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI>'s (their first minister's) writings, that look favorably towards this practice.</P>
<P>And as to the first settlers of the <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> he cannot but know what were the sentiments of al∣most all the first fathers in the point. I having lent him Dr. <HI>I. Mather</HI>'s book intitled, "<HI>the first principles of New-England,</HI> &amp;c." whether he thought it worth reading or no, I cannot tell; but if he did read it, I am amazed he should talk as he does. The fact was this, the first comers were generally communicants, so there was no occasion to discuss the point: but when grand-children were born, and the country increased, after a due consideration of the point, most of the first settlers (being then alive) fell in with the practice. But I have spoke enough upon this head in the Essays, which it seems he deems unworthy of the least notice; except to speak in direct contradiction to part of it.</P>
<P>As to "the melancholy prostitution of this ordi∣nance" by their posterity, so contrary to the origi∣nal
<PB N="69" REF="012739_0066_0F8BEADA1DE3D718"/>design of the <HI>synod,</HI> which he tells us of in the same page, whether he accuses himself or others, I know not; I leave his own conscience to judge: but I would tell him this, that I am far from plead∣ing guilty to the charge, while I was in the minist∣ry: and I do not doubt many other ministers can say the same.</P>
<P>I now come to his fifth Section, from <HI>p.</HI> 41. to <HI>p.</HI> 51.</P>
<P>Wherein he endeavors to shew, that my book con∣tains little else but a bundle of inconsistencies and contradictions, or else is very erroneous and weak, and betrays great confusion of thought. "It would be <HI>endless,</HI> says he, to follow Mr. <HI>C.</HI> in all his contra∣dictions and inconsistencies." Therefore it seems he only selects a few.</P>
<P>In his first entrance on this Section, <HI>p.</HI> 41. there seems to be as many misrepresentations almost as lines: he intirely mistakes "<HI>the grand point</HI> I am aiming at." "It is, says he, to prove that it is <HI>lawful</HI> for persons that have been baptized and are not scandalous, to own the covenant and have baptism for their children though they <HI>neglect</HI> to come up to the other ordinance; and that church∣es ought to admit them to the former, though they refuse the latter." This I have already disclaimed: I say with him, let all <HI>neglecters</HI> and <HI>refusers</HI> be ex∣cluded, if he can prove them such.</P>
<P>The first instance of inconsistence that he alleges is, that I charge him "with proposing a popish dispensation, and yet my whole book is wrote to es∣tablish the lawfulness of such a dispensation." I de∣ny the charge: I made a distinction between <HI>a mere sufferance or passive connivance,</HI> and an <HI>actual allowance.</HI> The former I said was the case according to the present mode, and the latter according to his scheme. There must be an <HI>actual vote</HI> in the case, after the candidate had promised to come immediately. He himself once saw the force of this distinction, when I discoursed with him in private, and endeavored to contrive methods to obviate the difficulty. But now the scale is turned, and he endeavors to involve me in the same difficulty. I know no way to ac∣count for it, but by supposing his <HI>assistant</HI> wrote this
<PB N="70" REF="012739_0067_0F8BEADAE8273C60"/>part, who did not so much consider. But suppos∣ing the dispensation on both sides were of the like tenor, all that can be said upon it is, that this ar∣gument of mine must stand for nothing, but does not in the least invalidate my other pleas against his expedient.</P>
<P>The second instance of inconsistence is, that I call "baptized persons <HI>real</HI> members, <HI>compleat</HI> members, visible chrstians, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet in effect call t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em elsewhere a <HI>carnal generation,</HI> &amp;c." I would ask him, whether the prophets, <HI>John</HI> the baptist, yea, Christ himself, have not frequently done the like? and does not he and other ministers often do the same in their preaching? we may certainly express our fears in a general way, that there is too great reigning car∣nality among professors, whether communicants or others; and yet not do right in rejecting indivi∣duals when they offer themselves against whom we know no just objection. And it is certain, if bap∣tized persons should generally come to communion, we should have a greater number of carnal com∣municants than we have now. As for that expres∣sion, "that the church would willingly admit these candidates in full; but the difficulty lies in their own breasts, not in ours." <HI>I</HI> speak not here of baptized persons in general (as he intimates) but only of those who actually apply, against whom is no just exception.</P>
<P>The next inconsistency (<HI>p.</HI> 42.) is already obvi∣ated under the observations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And here <HI>I</HI> can∣not but observe what a captious disposition it shews, to repeat over and over detached shreds and pas∣sages, which appear quite harmless and natural, as they stand in connection.</P>
<P>He here seems to have done with inconsistencies for the present, and next musters up a number of particulars, to make me appear ignorant and weak, or very erroneous.</P>
<P>In <HI>p.</HI> 43. He taxes me with gross error in assert∣ing, "that children's membership is a <HI>distinct thing</HI> from that of their parents, though coming through their means; and that to punish them, because their parents do not immediately approach to the
<PB N="71" REF="012739_0068_0F8BEADB8E468A80"/>Lord's-table, is hard and injurious." But where does the error lye? is it in the first part? dare he deny, that their membership is distinct? are they not distinct parties in the covenant! <HI>Gen.</HI> xvii. Does not their membership remain, when their parents are dead, and their relation to the visible church wholly ceased?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> remarks, that some of the opposers of the <HI>synod</HI> were so absurd, as to make a serious question of it, <HI>whether men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o not remain members of the visi∣ble church after they are dead?</HI> <Q>But can any man (says the doctor) in good earnest think, that an hypocrite when he is dead and gone to his own place, is still a member of God's church? yet his infant child is so: therefore the membership of the child doth exist after the membership of the parent is extinct; therefore it is really distinct from the parents membership.</Q> <HI>Subjects of bapt.</HI> p. <HI>64.</HI></NOTE> And do not the children of of∣fenders, though ever so young, retain their mem∣bership, after their parents are excommunicated? which could not be, if their membership was not distinct. But it is perhaps the inference that of∣fends him, "to punish children, because their parents do not immediately come to the Lord's-ta∣ble, is hard and injurtous." I think so still: for if they are in such a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ation, as to be <HI>real members</HI> of the church as being children of members (which way of arguing he has not yet disproved) they ought to have the seal. But will it not follow from hence, "that the children of all baptized persons however scand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lous, ought to have the seal?" I answer, no; if parents have actually <HI>forfeited</HI> their membership, their children cannot properly be called the children of members. Or if they have not forfeited it, the church ought not to force the privilege upon them, without asking. But if they come and ask for it, and no proper objection made against their conduct, who dare deny them?</P>
<P>He next accuses me of great confusion of thought in that expression, "baptism seals saving blessing to the unregenerate, <HI>conditionally.</HI>" It is an expres∣sion of Mr. <HI>Stoddard's,</HI> and let him fight it out
<PB N="72" REF="012739_0069_0F8BEADCF19E87A8"/>with him. However, I must tell him, that I see no impropriety in the expression. Suppose there should be a covenant wrote between him and me, and I should sign and seal it, but he by reason of absence or otherwise should not sign and seal for weeks and months, it may properly be called a sealed covenant on my part, but yet <HI>conditionally;</HI> it takes no effect till he hath sealed it likewise. The same may be said in the present case. But what advantage would it be to suppose such a condition∣al seal on God's part? what benefit does it con∣vey any more to the baptized than unbaptized? I answer, great benefit, even according to him. For he says a few pages after, "there are promises all over the bible to the children of believers." And is it no advantage to have such promises sealed to them, though at present in a state of unregene∣racy? I make no doubt but <HI>Ishmael,</HI> whom I there mentioned by name, found great benefit by this conditional seal. For from some passages in the old-testament, we may infer that he died a good man, however bad in his younger years.</P>
<P>Another instance of "the same confusion, says he, appears in my idea or description of a seal." <HI>p.</HI> 43. I had said and I think fully proved, that prayer, hearing, reading, offering sacrifices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were seals, always seals of the covenant of grace, when proper∣ly used. And I would now further tell him, that the saying of the Lord's prayer (which is the pat∣tern of all true prayer) <HI>from the heart,</HI> is as much a solemn covenant transaction as if any person should stand in the broad alley, and should have the cove∣nant in form propounded to him. True prayer is a covenant transaction always; there is a promise on God's part, and there is a seal on our part in pleading and laying hold of it. In answer to this, he seems readily to grant, that prayer, hearing, reading, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are seals, if used in faith. And surely baptism and the Lord's-supper are seals in no other sense. A <HI>conditional seal</HI> he hath been just laughing at. So that all the ordinances in this respect seem to be upon a par. Hence I argued, that if unre∣generate men may lawfully use some of the seals
<PB N="73" REF="012739_0070_0F8BEADD1EADF548"/>(considered only as seals) he may upon the same ground use the other, yea all, and that there was nothing in the <HI>nature</HI> of a seal to hinder him. Con∣sequently, their argument taken merely from the word seal (which they laid so much stress upon) was of no force. However, that there were some other considerations which rendered it not proper, that baptism and the Lord's-supper should be made as <HI>common</HI> as the other ordinances, though this from the nature of a seal was given up. Of this latter clause he takes no notice; and as to the other part of the argument, he seems not to have the least idea of what I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imed at; which was not to prove (as he asserts) that all sorts, good and bad, even the most scandalous, have a right to baptism; but that the restrictive use of this and the other ordinance could not be argued merely from the term <HI>seal</HI> (which was a common name for all the ordinances) but must be taken from other topicks. As much as to say, that a barrier ought indeed to be set round the ordinances of baptism and the Lord's-supper; but that this could not be proved barely from the word <HI>seal</HI> (this being a common term) but must be taken from weightier considera∣tions, namely, the express declarations of God in scripture. This gives me occasion to caution him not to mistake me again, as he has done above twenty-times in my book, I hope not wilfully.</P>
<P>Next, he animadverts upon "my strange notions about assurance," and wrests my words in a strange manner. It appears to me the unavoidable conse∣quence of their doctrine, that <HI>full assurance</HI> is ne∣cessary in order to coming to the ordinance: so far as they doubt of their state, so far they must doubt of their right; and no man ought to come to it with a <HI>doubting conscience,</HI> especially if the sin be greater for an unregenerate person to come than to stay away, (as some of them expressly teach.) Now if full assurance or an assurance that excludes all doubt be necessary, it must be attained before they come; and if attained, what need they come to attain what they have already? as it is not ne∣cessary
<PB N="74" REF="012739_0071_0F8BEADDB81986C8"/>for a man regenerate to come to the means to obtain regenerating grace, which he is already possessed of. But yet in both cases, they ought to come for other ends: the assured christian ought to come to get his assurance confirmed, habituated and preserved, which may be lost many ways; he ought to come to have his <HI>graces</HI> increased and strengthened, for certainly they are not come to their full strength, although his <HI>evidences</HI> are; there being no <HI>higher pitch</HI> than full assurance attainable in this life: he ought to come to testify his love and respect to his gracious Lord and master, and for many other valuable ends. These I thought needless to set down, because not to the point in hand. How injurious then is Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s representa∣tion of the matter, as if I held that the ordinances were instituted only or principally "to ascertain to a man his own safe state:" But it is his way to take all opportunities to represent me weak or wicked.</P>
<P>As to his assertion, that my scheme necessarily involves me in the same difficulty they are under, or "that the dead weight I mention lies full as heavy upon me as on them," I see no just grounds for it. I have already noticed a two-fold distincti∣on relative to our right in the sight of God, which I think sufficiently clears me. And then further, Dr. <HI>B.</HI> holds. that it is a <HI>greater sin</HI> for an unregene∣rate man (however sincere or whatever his hopes are) to come than to stay away, (which doctrine he no where disavows, though I rendred it neces∣sary for him to do it, if he was of another mind) which certainly is a sufficient bar against any one's coming upon uncertainties. Whereas if they incur less guilt by coming than by absenting, though uncertain and even under a mistake, they had better come than not, in hopes divine mercy will bless the ordinance for their spiritual good. This leads me to take notice of his surprizing argu∣mentation (taken from Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> although he gives him not credit for it.) <HI>p.</HI> 46. <Q>If the Lord's-supper were only a privilege, which I am allow∣ed to take, upon certain qualifications in me;
<PB N="75" REF="012739_0072_0F8BEAE502C11018"/>and forbidden, if I had not those qualifications; in such a case, it would certainly be safest for me to abstain, till I <HI>know</HI> I have the qualifications. But supposing I am strictly commanded and en∣joined by God, to take, if I have those qualifica∣tions then it is EQUALLY dangerous to neglect on uncertainties as to take on uncertainties.</Q> What, <HI>equally</HI> dangerous, when the sin is <HI>greater</HI> on the side of coming! what, shall I be guilty of a greater sin in coming than "drunkenness, adultery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" and yet had I best come after all, though I do not know but that I may involve myself in such heinous guilt? surely such sort of reasoning will convince no body but such as believe with their <HI>wills,</HI> and not with their <HI>understandings.</HI> But supposing the guilt <HI>equal</HI> on both sides, as the words in this place import, then it seems the scale is even: a man in doubt must neither come nor stay away: there is nothing to preponderate on the one side or the other; he may chuse either, and not be more guilty. And yet notwithstanding this even bal∣lance, the inference is, that he ought to come. "An inference truly worthy a <HI>logician.</HI>" It would not avail them here to say, that a man hath <HI>pre∣vailing hopes</HI> in the case: for what good will these prevailing hopes do him, if he be <HI>really mistaken</HI> af∣ter all? such hopes do not abate, but rather ag∣gravate his guilt. So that these ought not to turn the scale in favor of coming. Nothing but absolute certainty will do. This is so plain a case, that when one of his intimates in the ministry (of one soul with him in this dispute) was lately pressed with my <HI>dead weight,</HI> and when beat out of their common place subter-fuges (such as Mr. <HI>R.</HI> uses) he at last openly declared, "that he did not care if this consequence did follow from their doctrine, it was true doctrine, and none ought to come with∣out they had <HI>assurance.</HI>"</P>
<P>In the next paragraph. 46. I scarce know what he is after. I had said, "if a man declares on oath more than he knows, he is guilty of perjury, though it happen afterwards to appear true, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" Does he deny this? no, not in direct terms. But
<PB N="76" REF="012739_0073_0F8BEAE74EDCF268"/>he endeavors to make it a contradiction to another passage of mine, namely, "that if a person offers his child in baptism he must say, that as far as he knows his own heart he is sincerely willing to give up himself and his children to God." Does this man declare more than he knows? are these expres∣sion <HI>as far as he knows,</HI> and, <HI>more than he knows,</HI> synony∣mous? what trifling is here?</P>
<P>Further, he says, "that if there be any validity in my way of reasoning here, all the forms of cove∣nanting used all over the country must be abolish∣ed." I answer, it is high time they were abolish∣ed, if they oblige men to say upon oath more than they know; or to declare that to be true which they do not know to be true; or in other words, to tell their maker and the church in the most solemn manner, that they <HI>have saving faith,</HI> when they do not know whether they have it or not. I never put any such construction upon the cove∣nant, nor I believe any one else before this day.</P>
<P>In <HI>p.</HI> 47. he taxes me with "a very great mis∣take (not to call it worse) in asserting, that he de∣nied infant membership." And to the same pur∣pose he speaks more largely in his marginal note, <HI>p.</HI> 30.31. I never asserted, that he held baptized infants stood in no sort of relation to the church: but that he denied their membership in any <HI>proper sense,</HI> if I can understand language, he did do it, and that in the plainest manner: and this not by a transient expression; it was a point talked of near half an hour; and this was all we could bring him to own, after all possible canvassings and endea∣vors to make him speak out, <HI>that they were laid under bonds,</HI> &amp;c. Upon which one of the members said, "that if this was all that was imported in infant membership, <HI>i. e.</HI> that they were only laid under bonds, but intitled to no privilege, then they were <HI>mere bond slaves;</HI>" which occasioned a sharp reproof. And presently after, upon my mentioning that pas∣sage of the catechism, <HI>the infants of such as are mem∣bers of the visible church are to be baptized,</HI> he readily granted it. Which implied that the persons in question were not members. How could we un∣derstand
<PB N="77" REF="012739_0074_0F8BEAE7810F5CC0"/>him otherwise than that he denied their membership in any proper sense? But the truth of the matter is, he hath shifted so often, when press∣ed closely, and sometimes owned and sometimes denied, as suited the present purpose, that we scarce know how to take him. However, if we may judge by his book, comparing one passage with another, his <HI>present</HI> opinion seems to be this; when they are first baptized they are <HI>proper members,</HI> but when they grow up, their membership wears off by piece-meal or they gradually lose it, till at last it is quite gone, unless they come to the Lord's-table; and this without the churches setting a mark on them, or any chargeable irregularity. But if they go so far as actually to own the cove∣nant, <HI>half</HI> of their (proper) membership remains, the other half is lost. How reasonable this is ap∣pears elsewhere.</P>
<P>Next he observes, "that this half-way practice tends to bring infant baptism into disgrace, and that <HI>nothing in the world</HI> hath contributed more to prejudice many against infant baptism, and to in∣crease the number of <HI>anabaptists</HI> among us than this." <HI>p.</HI> 48. For this we have only his <HI>ipse dixit.</HI> I never heard or read of any, that made this their main plea; yea, I never heard it pleaded at all by the favorers of <HI>anabaptism</HI> (though I have conversed with several.) And plain fact proves, that this as∣sertion is not true. For let us look all around us, and we shall find, that the places where the <HI>ana∣baptists</HI> have most generally increased, are such places where this practice is shut out. And indeed the very shutting it out, affords them a good plea, (which they do not fall to use:) "for here, say they, are some whom you have received as mem∣bers, and acknowlege as members; and yet actually treat them as no members; you will not baptize their children, nor exercise any discipline over them, but let them run as lambs in a large pasture: what is their membership good for, if they are allow∣ed no privilege, nor any care taken of them? it were much better they had never been baptized at all." This pleasurely carries great weight with it. The
<PB N="78" REF="012739_0075_0F8BEAE888FA9580"/>only way to disprove it, would be to treat them as members, and to revive a godly discipline over them (as strict as that over communicants, which was practised in the days of our fathers) and then their prejudices would gradually vanish.</P>
<P>I must just take notice of his marginal note here (<HI>p.</HI> 48.) because he hath accused me of <HI>sewing pillows,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>dawbing,</HI> &amp;c. and would ask, whether there is no appearance of it here? <Q>I would not be under∣stood, says he, by any thing I have said to im∣peach the characters of any in <HI>this place,</HI> who have owned the covenant. It must be acknow∣leged they are, to all appearance, persons of good characters and <HI>exemplary conversation.</HI></Q> If this be true, it is surely a good encouragement to proceed in the practice. But can he say upon his conscience, that he never heard any thing <HI>amiss</HI> of <HI>one</HI> of them? and yet is he caressed. as one of the dearest and most bosom friends and companions?</P>
<P>I now come to the grand point, the <HI>proton-pseu∣dos</HI> of all. <HI>p.</HI> 49. <Q>Mr. <HI>C.</HI> says he, in defending this practice (as many others have done before him) has naturally, and I think, upon his plan necessarily, warped off from <HI>Calvinism,</HI> and run into sentiments respecting men's <HI>natural depravity,</HI> exactly agreable to <HI>arminian</HI> writers.</Q> When I first read the charge of <HI>arminianism</HI> in his letter, I was astonished, and could not imagine from whence it took it's rise: but since I have had opportunity of reading several <HI>connecticut</HI> writers on the subject, which unfolded the mystery. The charge it seems was brought by Dr <HI>B.</HI> against his antagonists on the same side of the question with me in that co∣lony, and that perhaps not without some founda∣tion: Mr. <HI>R.</HI> took it from him as it were <HI>by rote,</HI> and thought the charge was calculated for the <HI>meridian</HI> of <HI>Plymouth</HI> as well as <HI>Connecticut,</HI> without <HI>being able</HI> to comprehend the different plans we went upon; and therefore in a random confused manner he hath exhibited it against me; and through me against all that ever were in the prac∣tice. And having once brought the charge, he thinks himself obliged in honor to defend it,
<PB N="79" REF="012739_0076_0F8BEAE9132E2800"/>though it would have been much more to his honor to have retracted it, and not have need∣lessly exposed himself. But how does he defend it? Why, by alleging some passages in my Essays, which he says are of <HI>arminian</HI> sound. Here I would desire the reader to turn to his letter, and they will find that this charge is not founded on such passages as he here produces, but on "the practice itself and the arguments made use of" (Essays. <HI>p.</HI> 35.) whereas these passages are no necessary part of the argument, but are mere <HI>transient expressions,</HI> and might as well have been left out, and my arguments would have remained in full force. But this is a fetch that he hath thought of, or was suggested to him by some friend when he came to study and answer my piece after printing. If he had thought of these in the time of writing his letter, instead of found∣ing the charge upon the general scheme and run of the arguments (which he is careful not to call <HI>my arguments,</HI> lest he should give me too much credit) he would have expressed himself thus that in such and such expressions I <HI>arminianized,</HI> and not that the general scheme was incumbered with this difficulty.</P>
<P>But let us now look into those dangerous passages, and see what he can make of them. First, says he, "he frequently represents natural men as <HI>truly de∣sirous of</HI> avouching the Lord for their God." I flatly deny the charge; there is not the least found∣ation for it in my Essays. Next, says he, "he fre∣quently represents natural men as <HI>sincerely</HI> entring into covenant with God, and giving up themselves and their children to him in covenant." This is as groundless as the other. Is there no difference between a man's <HI>prevailingly hoping</HI> he does a duty sincerely (<HI>i. e.</HI> graciously) and his <HI>really</HI> doing it in that manner? those that have been <HI>long under conviction</HI> must certainly know, that they pass through such a variety of dispositions, as that they are exceeding apt to take it for saving grace: sometimes mourn∣ing and great relentings for sin, it appearing to them the most odious thing in the world: some∣times great pangs of affection; sometimes great
<PB N="80" REF="012739_0077_0F8BEAE9C3444DC0"/>joy at some imperfect discoveries of gospel grace, or upon viewing gospel encouragements; some∣times all these streams are dried up, and they ap∣pear to themselves the most hardened wretches in the world; and then they flow again, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And thus it may be alternately for years. And during the continuance of such operations, they may be (at times) as fully satisfied of their <HI>sincerity</HI> as that they have a being (whether it be a <HI>gracious sincerity</HI> they know not). And in such a case, may they not justly say (say it without lying) "that as far as they know their own heart they are sincerely willing to give themselves and their children to God? Mr. <HI>R. art thou a</HI> MASTER IN ISRAEL, <HI>and know∣est not these things?</HI> if not, it is high time you should: and for that end, to read <HI>Mead, Allen, Guthry,</HI> and such experimental writers; if it be not beneath you to read such low authors as these. It is plain, the <HI>Israelites</HI> were under such religious impressions at <HI>Sinai,</HI> that they verily thought they spoke truth and acted with sincerity, when they said, <HI>all that the Lord hath commanded us, we will do,</HI> &amp;c. And the same is the case frequently with sinners, when un∣der conviction. Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI>'s mistake, whenever he is speaking of the unregenerate, seems to arise from his considering them in their <HI>mere naturals</HI> (in which nothing but hell is breathed forth) wholly destitute of the <HI>common</HI> influences of the spirit, or of those divine <HI>afflatus</HI>'s which the unrege∣nerate are capable of; such as <HI>Balaam</HI> was under when he talks so divinely, or <HI>Saul</HI> when he had <HI>another heart</HI> (though not a <HI>new heart</HI>) given him; or the divine impressions the <HI>stony ground hearers</HI> were under, though the <HI>stony heart</HI> still remained. In which case, not only <HI>outward acts</HI> of sin are restrain∣ed; but the <HI>inward motions</HI> of sin are pent up; so that their inclination to them seems to be gone, and their hearts rise within them with indigna∣tion against themselves, whenever they think of their old ways. This is a common case. And whenever it is so, it is natural for men (who are unacquainted with the real operations of divine or sanctifying grace) to think themselves <HI>sincere,</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="012739_0078_0F8BEAEA79C68AE8"/>and that these impressions will forever remain.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a frequent observation of divines, there is such a <HI>re∣semblance</HI> between <HI>common</HI> and <HI>saving</HI> grace, that not only the church, but the person himself may be deceiv∣ed by it: and when this is the case, according to Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s own principles, a man ought to come.—I would query here, whether he had not as much charity for one he pro∣pounded, in the time of it, as for any that ever he admitted, who made a <HI>relation</HI> very particular indeed. But hath since given too much reason to think, that there was no∣thing <HI>saving</HI> in it. To which I add, if it is such an easy thing to come to satisfying conclusions about a man's re∣generate state, as Dr. <HI>B.</HI> holds, what need of so many vo∣lumes to satisfy the doubting conscience? "He must sit down and count the cost and come to a peremptory resoluti∣on," says he. Alas! how many have done so in their own apprehension; and yet when temptations came, what wythes have they proved?</NOTE> This observation I desire the reader to carry along with him, whenever the unregerate are spoken of as acting with any degree of sincerity: and not to imagine that I hold, or that it is the natural conse∣quence of my doctrine, "that there is really some <HI>good thing</HI> in them towards the Lord;" as Mr. <HI>R.</HI> represents in his letter (Essays. <HI>p</HI> 36.) and in his book.</P>
<P>He next quotes that passage, "as for those that grow up, it is a seal at least that they shall not only have the offer of Christ, but the strivings of his spirit, which, if not resisted, will prove effectual to their conversion." Does the <HI>arminianism</HI> lye in the first part of this passage? then Dr. <HI>C. Mather</HI> was an <HI>ar∣minian;</HI> for he says, <Q>their baptism is to seal the engagement of God to them, that when they are of age to choose and to act for themselves, they shall at least have some <HI>offer</HI> of the gospel, with some striving of the spirit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> (Infant bapt <HI>p.</HI> 6.) Or does it lye in the words <HI>not resisted?</HI> supposing I had used the words <HI>not quenched,</HI> it would have as fully expressed my meaning. And is not this an apostolic expression? 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> v. 19. He must then fight it out with the apostle, as using
<PB N="82" REF="012739_0079_0F8BEAEB3AA175E0"/>a phrase tending to <HI>arminianism.</HI> I never scrupled to tell sinners under evident convictions, that God's spirit striving with them was a token for good; that when he begun to strive in a soul, he never left it, unless <HI>wilfully resisted;</HI> that therefore it was their duty to <HI>cherish</HI> his motions, and not to <HI>stifle</HI> them, as too many did, by company, by drink, by neglect of the means, by unwatchfulness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Not that God was tyed <HI>by promise</HI> to give them special grace; but that, seeing he in <HI>sovereign mercy</HI> had begun to work in them (when he knew their na∣tural contrariety and opposition to hun) they had reason to expect the continuance of his motions and influences, till he had wrought saving effects in their souls, if not with violence drove away, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> see <HI>Act.</HI> vii. 51. and <HI>Isai.</HI> lxiii. 10. Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s blun∣der here seems to arise from his not distinguishing between <HI>wilful resistance</HI> and the <HI>natural opposition</HI> there is between corruption and divine operations: or it arises from the bare sound of the word <HI>resist</HI> which is much used in the <HI>quinquarticular</HI> controversy.</P>
<P>As for spelling out the denial of the doctrine of <HI>irresistible grace in conversion,</HI> because I suppose the sinner may resist the motions of the spirit <HI>previous to conversi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> it is so <HI>weak</HI> that it is unworthy of the least notice. I might as well spell out <HI>arminianism</HI> from his exhorting sinners to <HI>cherish</HI> the influences of the spirit, whenever striving; as if he held that the unregenerate soul was not wholly de∣praved, or that it was capable of <HI>co-operating</HI> with the spirit of God in the work of regeneration: for certainly <HI>cherishing</HI> is an <HI>act.</HI></P>
<P>Next, he falls soul upon me for some "quotations from a writer," who he says is "not the most noted for <HI>Calvinism.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is surprizing, that Dr. <HI>B.</HI> and his <HI>disciples</HI> talk so much about <HI>Calvinism,</HI> when it is notoriously known, that he brands all those that are real and thorough <HI>Calvinists,</HI> (or that hold the same principles <HI>Calvin</HI> did) with the name of <HI>antinomians.</HI></NOTE> [As much as to say, that he was a half-way <HI>Calvinist,</HI> a proper advocate for a half-way practice.] If it be bad to speak evil of <HI>things we know
<PB N="83" REF="012739_0080_0F8BEAEBF80F16E8"/>not,</HI> it is equally bad to speak evil of <HI>persons we know not.</HI> I am certain he never read this author, on whom he lays such a stigma, and that in fact he knows nothing about him. It is the pious and learn∣ed <HI>Edward Leigh,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a man as famous for sound∣ness in the faith and vital piety as judge <HI>Hale</HI> him∣self, or Mr. <HI>Polhill.</HI> And his <HI>systim of divinity</HI> contains but little of his own composure; it is chiefly a col∣lection from the old <HI>puritan</HI> and <HI>calvinistical</HI> writers, such as <HI>Perkins, Twiss, Ames, Pemble, Calvin, Ursin,</HI> and scores more; and is filled with an elaberate confutation of all the <HI>arminian</HI> doctrines. He might with as much truth have fixed such a brand on <HI>Calvin</HI> himself.</P>
<P>But what are these quotations! The first is, "The Lord will as <HI>assuredly</HI> ingrasse us into Christ and cloache us with his righteousness, as we have the <HI>outward washing,</HI> if we deprive not ourselves thereof by our own carelessness." And is not this the very doctrine that he implicitly teaches, when he says, <HI>p.</HI> 48. "There are promises all over the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble to children of believers;" promises of what? not of <HI>outward mer∣cies</HI> only, but of <HI>spiritual blessings</HI> also: for "otherwise there is no sense or meaning in the words." But setting this aside, what is the plain meaning of the quotation taken in connexion; but this; that when God's spirit is striving in a soul, nothing but their own carelessness will deprive them of the benefit of them? or prevent their ingras<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure into Christ? or in other words, that sinners are the only faulty causes of their own destruction? that it is owing to their own carelessness, ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ligence and wilfulness? as Christ says, <HI>John</HI> v. 40. <HI>Ye will not come to me,</HI> &amp;c. in which words there is as much <HI>arminianism</HI> as in the passage under consideration.</P>
<P>The next quotation which he endeavors to wrest is, "one end of this ordinance is to quicken our dulness, and excite our diligence in performing gospel duties, <HI>viz.</HI> our endeavors to believe, repent and obey, in confidence of God's help and assistance." His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine reasoning here w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll be spoiled by adding two words. Let it run thus, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> end of this ordi∣nance is to quicken our dulness and excite our di∣ligence in performing gospel duties, viz. <HI>to excite</HI> our
<PB N="84" REF="012739_0081_0F8BEAEE464CC718"/>endeavors to believe, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" The word <HI>excite</HI> is ne∣cessarily understood, and it would have been but tantology to have repeated it; and none but a wil∣ful wrester of words would have put such a con∣struction on the passage as he has done; which was, that what Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> meant by <HI>performing gospel-duties</HI> was, the <HI>ende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ors of sinners</HI> and not <HI>believing repenting,</HI> &amp;c. He adds, "according to this, graceless persons (for he is speaking of those that are destitute of the spiritual washing) do <HI>with diligence perform</HI> gospel du∣ties." Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> was not speaking particularly of those destitute of the spiritual washing, but in a ge∣neral way including all baptized persons, whether believers or sinners. But supposing it meant only of sinners, is there no difference between having <HI>our diligence excited</HI> to perform gospel duties, and the <HI>actual performance?</HI> is it any sin for unregenerates to <HI>ende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vor</HI> to perform gospel duties, to believe, repent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> although they cannot do them without special grace? is it not in the use of such endeavors, that they come to feel their own impotency and want of strength, and the necessity of divine help, and so are brought to look to God for all? But then these endeavors must be "in <HI>confidence</HI> of God's help and assistance." This <HI>confidence</HI> it seems is another <HI>armi∣nian</HI> phrase. Not so I hope with respect to the <HI>be∣lieving part</HI> of the baptized (of whom Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> is partly speaking). But it must be so only with re∣spect to unregenerates. Why? because it implies "<HI>a promise</HI> of assistance" "<HI>a promise</HI> of saving blessings to such," which is rank <HI>arminianism.</HI> But can there be no <HI>confidence</HI> without an <HI>express promise?</HI> had not the woman of <HI>Canaan</HI> a strong confidence re∣specting her daughter, and yet no promise in the case? had not King <HI>Abijah</HI> (a graceless man) the strongest confidence without a promise? 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> xiii. 12.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If he should say, this confidence was built upon the pro∣mises to <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon.</HI> I answer, these promi∣ses might have been fulfilled to his pious son <HI>Asa,</HI> though he and his present army had perished.</NOTE> And may not confidence arise from the <HI>general encouragements</HI> of the word, without an ex∣press
<PB N="85" REF="012739_0082_0F8BEAEEF90EAC98"/>promise? Mr. <HI>Vincent</HI> says, "baptized persons may address God <HI>with confidence.</HI> (see Essays. <HI>p.</HI> 58.) and dare Mr. <HI>R.</HI> deny him to be a thorough <HI>Cal∣vinist?</HI> but suppose a promise was wanting to found this confidence upon. Mr. <HI>R.</HI> tells us, "there are promises all over the bible concerning the seed or children of believers," tho' unregenerate themselves. And are not these promises a sufficient foundation for confidence? I may well then re∣tort. Mr. <HI>R.</HI> "espouses the doctrine of <HI>promises,</HI> of saving blessings to the <HI>unregenerate.</HI>"</P>
<P>The last instance of <HI>arminianism</HI> is, that I assert, "that <HI>in infants</HI> there is no resistance or opposition to God's grace: for speaking of infants, Mr. <HI>C.</HI> says, concerning most of them, they have not the grace of the covenant, though there be no resistance or opposition on their parts." W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> then, infants are capable of <HI>resisting</HI> God's grace. And resistance is an ACT. Then consequently they are capable of <HI>actual sin,</HI> which doctrine is neither <HI>Calvinism,</HI> nor <HI>arminian∣ism,</HI> nor the tenet of any sect that ever I heard of. I should be reckoned two sarcastic, if I called it by the name of <HI>Robbinism</HI> for it's singularity, though I know not what other name to give it. Mr. <HI>R.</HI> sure∣ly forgets (when he accuses me of denying the doctrine of <HI>depravity</HI>) that if they were not "depraved creatures," they would stand in no need of <HI>regene∣rating grace,</HI> or the grace of the covenant. And <HI>pas∣sive resistance</HI> is a thing that I can have no idea of, if it be not a direct contradiction in terms. Upon the whole, let me ask him, is this a christian way of treating a brother? what if I should criticise upon his sermons in this <HI>odd manner,</HI> I should surely spell out <HI>arminianism</HI> in almost every sermon he preached. And is he willing to pass through the ordeal or fiery tryal in print?</P>
<P>Having thus done with particular instances, he in the close laments my unhappy fate "in falling into such bad company," and "sinking so deep into the mire before I was aware:" and is so kind as to offer his helping hand to lift me out, advis∣ing me "to look around me" and consider and stop in time, before I was wholly swallowed up in the
<PB N="86" REF="012739_0083_0F8BEAF05C5EE0E0"/>dreadful whirlpool of error: for "that in reality the dispute was more about <HI>doctrines</HI> than <HI>discipline,</HI> and the whole cause of <HI>Calvinism</HI> was verily at stake, <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Agreable to this it is a notion diligently propagated among us, that none but <HI>arminian</HI> ministers approve of my book.</NOTE> This brings to min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a story I lately heard; one of his warm adherents, with another, not long since falling into company with a minister of a neighboring county, the minister enquired of them about the controversy at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> which they gave him some account of.

This leads me to take notice, that Mr. <HI>R.</HI> endeavors to affix the charge of <HI>arminianism,</HI> not only on me particu∣larly (upon the account of the passages above) but also on the pactice itself. <Q>It is a necessary warp∣ing off, says he, from <HI>Calvinism,</HI> and running in∣to sentiments exactly agreable to <HI>arminian</HI> wri∣ters.</Q> Arise ye ghosts! of <HI>Shepard. Cotton, Hooker, Norton, Wilson, Mather,</HI> &amp;c. and hear the charge, that this man of <HI>yesterday</HI> brings against you! do you plead guilty or not? it is strange, that none of our fathers, that none of the <HI>synod,</HI> that none of the ministers for 140 years ever found it out: that the great Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI> the chief opposer of the <HI>synod,</HI> never dreamed of any such thing: but that this wonderful discovery should be reserved till this pre∣sent age, and that Dr. <HI>B.</HI> and Mr. <HI>R.</HI> should be the sagacious persons that spelt it out. But it is an old proverb, <HI>that every generation grows wiser and wiser;</HI> tho' here I must a little suspect their wisdom, and pro∣fess myself still so pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>blind as not to see the neces∣sary connextion between this practice and <HI>arminianism;</HI> and hope that he, in his next answer, will render the matter more plain, or there will still be many
<PB N="87" REF="012739_0084_0F8BEAF08DF9F8F0"/><HI>unbelievers,</HI> who will look upon it as a scare-crow, set up to amuse or affright the populace.</P>
<P>For my part I never desire better company than the vener<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> persons above mentioned, and would say, <HI>let my soul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gathered with them.</HI> And as for "the <HI>bad company</HI> I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> present fallen into," I must tell him it is <HI>below</HI> a gentleman to make such reflections, and hope upon further consideration he will be rea∣dy to make all due acknowlegements. What if I shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in return, lament the <HI>bad company</HI> he is fallen into, namely, <HI>anabaptists,</HI> bad advisors, counsellors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (even such counsellors, as s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of his <HI>great friends</HI> have said they fear will prove his overthrow;) would he not think himself abused! and yet I may more justly do it, than he in regard of me.</P>
<P>I now proceed to his sixth section from <HI>p.</HI> 51. to <HI>p.</HI> 60.</P>
<P>Wherein he endeavors to show, that I have <HI>mis∣apprehended</HI> him in some things, and <HI>misrepresented</HI> him in others. Some of the instances, he alleges I have either already, or shall hereafter consider; and therefore shall pass them here.</P>
<P>The first instance is, "that I represent it as his opinion. that a man must know he is in a gracious state, must have <HI>assurance</HI> before he come, <HI>&amp;c." p.</HI> 51. "This is unfair, says he, we never held any such doctrine." To this I suppose he refers in that pas∣sage of his letter. "You, sir, do certainly know, that neither I nor the brethren hold such things as you there advanced as being our sentiments." (Essays. <HI>p.</HI> 34.) Whether he holds it or no, I am certain it is the <HI>necessary</HI> consequence of his princi∣ples, as I have often noted. But where can we find that I directly charge him with this? he refers for proof to some passages in the Essays, the first is <HI>p.</HI> 6. "if the knowlege of a man's good estate (as they hold) is a necessary qualification for the Lord's-sup∣per," <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And to the same purpose, <HI>p.</HI> 7. But is there not such a thing as a <HI>conjectural</HI> as well as <HI>certain</HI> knowlege.? and do not I make an evident distincti∣on between these two? <HI>p.</HI> 9. (which is one of the pages he refers to): and is not the <HI>latter</HI> there charg∣ed only as the <HI>necessary consequence</HI> of his doctrine?
<PB N="88" REF="012739_0085_0F8BEAF1353012D8"/>I am sure Dr. <HI>B.</HI> makes use of the word <HI>knowlege</HI> or <HI>knowing</HI> in the case. And Mr. <HI>R.</HI> has several times, either in his sermon or otherwise used such high expressions, as his hearers took to purport a <HI>certain knowlege.</HI> But yet I never directly charged him with this. His usual phrase I know is, that <HI>prevailing hopes</HI> are sufficient. But is not even this carrying the matter too far? there is no <HI>essential</HI> difference be∣tween the <HI>first</HI> coming to ordinances, and the <HI>after</HI>-coming (they renewing covenant as really each time); and if the first coming must be with pre∣vailing hopes, then the after coming must be so too: consequently persons must never come when they are under <HI>prevailing fears.</HI> And is this right? must this door of consolation be shut? must christians be excluded from ordinances when they stand in most need of them.</P>
<P>He next taxes me with treating him hardly and unjustly in that passage of the Essays. <HI>p.</HI> 26. "It hath been once and again said, that the purport of the new scheme is to <HI>enlarge,</HI> and not to <HI>curtail and di∣minish their privileges.</HI> viz. by obliging them to come immediately into full communion." And is not this an obligation with a witness? and designed as such? for how could their privileges be <HI>enlarged</HI> in any other way but by coming? if they stayed away, he would allow them no privilege at all.</P>
<P>In the same page, he taxes me with mistake (if not falshood) in the account I gave of Mr. <HI>Leonard</HI>'s introducing the practice. But which is most like∣ly to know the truth of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acts, whether Mr. <HI>R</HI> or I who lived upon the spot in the time of it, I leave the world to judge. And my account is confirmed by an ancient deacon of the church, who was pre∣sent at the meeting, and actually voted in the af∣fair. But it seems Mr. <HI>R.</HI> will not believe any thing that comes from our quarter, if it does not suit him. This is not the only instance of his <HI>infidelity.</HI> It is certain matter of fact, that Mr. <HI>Leonard</HI> had the majority with him long before the point was brought to a public decision. That the practice was received by a <HI>unanimous voice</HI> I never asserted; but that there was a <HI>general acquiescence</HI> I have the
<PB N="89" REF="012739_0086_0F8BEAF760B27FA8"/>utmost reason to believe. As to some (<HI>i. e.</HI> two or three's) objecting, mentioned in the record, that was previous to the vote, and is no ways inconsist∣ent with their declaring they would acquiesce, if the generality of the church were for introducing the practice; and "the <HI>calmness</HI>" with which the meeting was carried on and concluded, shows it to be the case. And if it had been otherwise, is it not strange that some or other should not remem∣ber it, besides the "aged member," mentioned by Mr. <HI>R.</HI> (it being transacted but about 41 years ago) As to the account given by said aged person (if I am informed right) it so <HI>directly militated</HI> with the record, that Mr. <HI>R.</HI> (though he made use of it in his private visits, to prove the deacon and me, <HI>liars,</HI> yet he) was afraid to set it down in full in his book. But if the record had not providentially stood in his way, how unmercifully would he have triumphed over us, upon this single testimony? and indeed he can scarce help doing it notwithstanding. I do not intend here∣by, to cast any disparagement upon this aged mem∣ber (I reckon him a <HI>worthy one</HI> as well as Mr. <HI>R.</HI>); but age and infirmity may make him forget.</P>
<P>As for the charge of <HI>"innovation"</HI> (<HI>p.</HI> 53.) I never brought it against him. He hath a right to pro∣pose an alteration, if he be conscienciously per∣suaded. But I should have been glad, if he had been as prudent in the management of it as Mr. <HI>Leonard</HI> was. If Mr. <HI>Leonard,</HI> instead of taking the steps he did, had wrote two such letters either to elder <HI>Faunce,</HI> or old deacon <HI>Foster,</HI> as Mr. <HI>R.</HI> has done to me; instead of bringing in the practice, he would have outed himself (without a very hum∣ble acknowlegement indeed), and brought such a stain upon him as he could never have got over. And as to the "alteration's not <HI>originating</HI> from him," but that numbers of the brethren were dis∣satisfied with the practice previous to his appear∣ing against it, I have reason to think he is mistaken. It was not so much the practice <HI>itself</HI> as the <HI>abuse</HI> of it, that gave ground of dissatisfaction. If only per∣sons of serious characters had applied, I believe
<PB N="90" REF="012739_0087_0F8BEAF9A78CDCD8"/>none would have been uneasy; but that some (whose real characters were better known to them than to the minister) should stand up in the con∣gregation and covenant in such a solemn manner, this filled them with trembling: and it would have been just the same, if they had applied for full communion. This was really the case, as I have heard some of the brethren declare, whom I suppose Mr. <HI>R.</HI> refers to.</P>
<P>It makes me sick to hear so much of "the origi∣nal plan of this church and of all the churches in <HI>New-England.</HI>" (<HI>p.</HI> 53.) They had really no plan about it; it was a point not thought of, till the <HI>third</HI> generation came upon the stage. And then as soon as there was occasion for it, the matter was dis∣cussed; and not long after the practice was almost ganerally received.</P>
<P>In <HI>p.</HI> 55. He "takes notice of a <HI>very cruel</HI> instance of misrepresentation," as he calls it, namely, my setting down that expression of his, <HI>what signifies it to have an infant sprinkled with a little water?</HI> this expres∣sion, he says, or something like it was brought in in the midst of an <HI>elaborate speech,</HI> which he sets down. <HI>p.</HI> 56. But how was it possible for him to make such a speech, while I was actually reading my Essay? Could we both speak at once? in fact, this expression stood singly and alone, and was blurted out in the audience of some that stood near him in the time of my reading, and not spoken in the hearing of the whole assembly, when I had done, in a set answer to me. And indeed he never attempted a <HI>direct answer</HI> to any of my arguments in one of the church meetings, as I or others can re∣collect. The truth is, that when he uttered this sentence, he was "under such great perturbation of spirit" (of which hereafter) that I believe he scarce knew what he said; and if he had alleged this in excuse, it would have served much better, than to have entertained his reader with a <HI>romantick speech</HI> that no body ever heard before. It is certain, there is nothing contained in my <HI>thrid Essay,</HI> that gave proper foundation for such a speech. He says, <Q>Mr. <HI>C.</HI> had then been insisting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the great pri∣vilege
<PB N="91" REF="012739_0088_0F8BEAFAB7690730"/>of infant's baptism; and had carried the matter too far; even so far, that people would be in danger of thinking that they were <HI>actually regenerated</HI> by baptism; and therefore all that were not baptized must consequently be lost.</Q> Where can he find one passage in that third Essay tending that way? (or indeed in any of the Essays?) And I did not otherwise utter one word about the point in controversy during that whole meeting; but studiously avoided it, being then very unwell. (This then is all a mere <HI>fiction</HI> of his own) Again, he says, "Mr. <HI>C.</HI> then insisted, that all baptized persons had a right to this privilege, whether re∣generate or not, if they were free from <HI>heresy</HI> or <HI>scandal,</HI> &amp;c." But where can he find any thing of this in that third Essay? is there one word in it a¦bout heresy or scandal? or about the right of un∣regenerate persons? his <HI>foundation</HI> and <HI>speech</HI> then must both fall together, and pass with the reader for a mere non-entity. I am sorry I am obliged to say this; but must I not speak the truth? does he not enforce me to it in my own defence? and will he venture to call it <HI>cruelty</HI> again?</P>
<P>In <HI>p.</HI> 58. he expressly asserts contrary to several former concessions, that <HI>all</HI> the baptized, who do not come to the Lord's-table, are <HI>wicked persons.</HI> He had before mustered up all the hard terms (or names) he could think of, calling them, <HI>neglecters, ha∣bitual neglecters and violaters, renouncers, refusers,</HI> &amp;c.&amp;c. (These phrases occur above 50 times in his book.) But here is the crowning cut, it comes at last to be <HI>"open wickedness."</HI> This they "live" in, and this they are likely to dye in, for it seems as "the neglect is continued," and like to be so to the end. And be∣ing so bad, they have it seems "justly forfeited the <HI>character</HI> and <HI>privileges</HI> of disciples, or visible christi∣ans." What man or what woman of <HI>feeling</HI> will bear all this? and how is the <HI>bruised reed</HI> broken to purpose? did he think of this, when he preached his funeral sermon? or did it come in mind, when he passes such a <HI>compliment</HI> upon "the <HI>continued</HI> and <HI>habitual neglecters</HI>" (as he calls them) among us? <HI>p.</HI> 48.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="012739_0089_0F8BEAFB11EAC6D8"/>
Upon the whole here, I would observe, and it cannot but be obvious to every learned reader, what immense pains he has taken to pick out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hreds and scraps of my discourse, to wrest my ex∣pressions, and misrepresent my assertions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to make me look inconsistent and ridiculous. If he had taken half the pains to have studied and ans∣wered my arguments, he would have done a much more acceptable service to the church of Christ. What good will it do his cause to make me appear weak and low, or even vile and bad?</P>

<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<P>I come now to his last Section. <HI>p.</HI> 60.</P>
<P>In remarking upon which, I shall consider his manner of treating me in relation to the <HI>particular</HI> controversy.</P>
<P>HERE a dark scene occurs, which I am sorry he hath obliged me to bring into light. It really pains me to enter upon it; but how can I do otherwise, after such innumerable misrepresenta∣tions? and when he hath had recourse to so many evasions to hide the truth? perhaps he thought by the <HI>number</HI> of his charges to lay me under a ne∣cessity of writing so largely in order to clear my∣self, that the book would be of such bulk as none would subscribe for it or buy it, so that I must of necessity lay under the weight of them and be silenced forever. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut I trust providence will order otherwise, and that there will be some way for the relief of injured innocence. Perhaps some may think I take delight in the subject, and that I mustered up every thing I could in my first piece to expose him; but it is far from being the case. What I then wrote was but a small sample of his management, (which, not a principle of re∣venge, but necessity did dictate:) and I suppressed a multitude of things (directly in point) that were as derogatory to his character as those I mentioned, and that out of tenderness to him. But now by his imprudent and unguarded manner of writing, he hath necessitated me to enter upon a larger field, and to relate several things (though not the one half that might be told) that I had much ra∣ther have buried in oblivion. My end in it is not to expose him, but to clear my own character; which I am the more solicitous to do, least a <HI>good
<PB N="94" REF="012739_0091_0F8BEAFC89FCA400"/>cause</HI> should suffer for my sake: for if I am so bad as represented, who will think my Essays worth reading?</P>
<P>He first attacks me about <HI>publishing his letters,</HI> that passed between us; he begins with it in his pre∣face, pursues it in his book, and repeats it over and over. He calls them <HI>"private letters:"</HI> but how could they be private, when all the town and country (where the public controversy was known) had heard of the letters long before their printing? he tells us "that the publication of them was kept a profound secret from the subscribers." The un∣dertakers tell me the direct contrary; they never made a secret of it: but openly declared, that not <HI>"what was read,"</HI> but the <HI>whole affair</HI> should be brought into public. "Some, he says, would ne∣ver have subscribed, had they known of the print∣ing of the letters." I never heard of but one that declared so; and he, after the book came out, and had the opportunity of perusal, said, he now saw the absolute necessity of printing the letters. But, "what have the public to do with private letters? what concern with matters merely personal? or that relate to some difference between two persons at <HI>Plymouth?</HI>" But how could they be called <HI>merely personal,</HI> unless they were written <HI>merely to vent his spleen against me?</HI> Did they not relate to the questi∣on in debate? was it not the <HI>only</HI> answer he had ever given <HI>directly</HI> to my Essays? and was it not natural to expect to find something in them edifying and instructing, tending to illustrate the controversy, and to bring conviction both to me and others? what a reflection does he cast upon himself, by sup∣posing it to be otherwise? by calling them <HI>merely personal?</HI> by intimating that they contained matter foreign to the point? and that they were really nothing to the purpose? why did he write them then? "But I did not ask his leave to publish them." What reason had he to expect this, after he had abused me as he had done? But "I published them without his knowlege, he did not so much as <HI>suspect</HI> it, till after they were gone to the press." How could this be, when he declared to one (if not more) of the
<PB N="95" REF="012739_0092_0F8BEAD580A58700"/>members several weeks before they were sent to the press, "that he understood the letters were to be printed, but did not ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e upon his own account, but should be sorry for me, because he thought it would hurt me?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This seems to be a common expression with him both before and after the letters went to the press; and I sup∣pose was chiefly spoken before those, who he thought would tell me of it, to discourage my proceeding. I heard it at several different times.</NOTE> And how came it about, that some of his most noted intimates were up in arms about printing the letters, and took such pains to prevent it near 2 months before they were sent, <HI>viz.</HI> by posting up at the market place, a most virulent libel, containing not only <HI>invectives,</HI> but <HI>threatnings</HI> in case I proceeded? and dropping another of the same import in the streets? perhaps he thought these would make such impressions as to prevent my going on, and so did not "<HI>suspect,</HI> &amp;c." I know no better way to account for his peremptory denial, or to save his veracity. But "I myself was the faulty cause of their being made public; they were indeed soon in every one's mouth, yet it was not through his means, but my own." How could this be, when he read my letter openly in a neighbors house pre∣sently after he received it? "But I never shewed them, says he, to <HI>four persons</HI> in the world, till I heard he had given off <HI>copies.</HI>" This cannot be true;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">His second letter perhaps he did not show, but the other he did frequently. This I guess is his salvo, to prevent the impeachment of his veracity.</NOTE> but suppose it was, did he not do what was worse? the same week and the week after he received my letter, he visited most abundantly, and in all places the letters were the subject of conversation; mine he represented in the most heinous light, as a mere heap of "<HI>scurrilities,</HI> &amp;c." reading scraps of it for confirmation, or reciting them <HI>memoriter;</HI> and his own he explained away to nothing,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In general, by saying, "that he did not mean so and so," though he could put no other meaning. Or more particularly, "that by the <HI>most godly,</HI> he chiefly meant <HI>women,</HI>" though he expressly mentions <HI>men,</HI> and though he speaks of those "that <HI>saw the bad consequences of my argu∣ments</HI> (Essays. p. <HI>35. 39.</HI>) which the <HI>women</HI> could not do, most of them having never heard the arguments. Further, that "by <HI>seeming affectionateness,</HI>" he had no design to impeach my sincerity. That he had no intent to tax me with <HI>arminianism,</HI> "though I hold <HI>exactly</HI> the same sentiments with <HI>arminian</HI> writers," (p. <HI>49.</HI>) that he had no thoughts of forbidding my preaching; that by <HI>instructions</HI> he did not mean preaching, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And as a <HI>crowning cut,</HI> take this specimen of his art. A <HI>good woman</HI> was <HI>grieving</HI> to him, that he should call me an <HI>arminian,</HI> &amp;c. He told her, "it was no such thing, Mr. <HI>C.</HI> was as sound a man as any in the world; all he meant by it was, that I was in a <HI>legal frame</HI> when I wrote my peice," thus he suits his answer to the sever∣al tastes of his hearers.</NOTE> endeavoring
<PB N="96" REF="012739_0093_0F8BEAFE34907B60"/>to make it appear altogether harmless and innocent. In consequence of this, the cry was from all quarters, how I had abused him, calling him <HI>school-boy,</HI> &amp;c. and that without any just provocation. And at the same time his emissaries were indefaticable in trumpeting it about to people in town and country, and even in the streets, that my letter was a most spiteful, malicious, scurrilous thing, and Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s a harmless, just, and handsome letter. These things I had information of from day to day. In the mean time, I only read his and my letter in my own house to such as asked the favor, and never went about publishing them at all.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How could I otherwise account for my withdraw from the sacrament, but by reading his letter? where is the man that should have received such a letter from his minister just before the sacrament but would have absented? and upon such absence, would not every one be upon the en∣quiry what was the ground or cause of it? (as was really the case here). And was I not necessitated to tell? and must I not read the letter to justify myself? must I not show, that I was ineffect laid under <HI>admonition,</HI> as far as his <HI>authority</HI> reached? and so an effectual bar laid in the way of my coming? and indeed I was unfit for communion, if his letter was true. And besides, how could I get witnesses to clear me of his aspersions, but by com∣municating the letters to those that were at the church meeting (both of the church and congregation) who heard what I said and read as well as he: and by communicat∣ing them to them, did not the matter become fully, a public affair?</NOTE> "But I gave copies."

<PB N="97" REF="012739_0094_0F8BEB0081D45E58"/>of the affair; and that copy was taken without my knowlege, but if I had known it I see nothing faul∣ty in it. The other letters were not copied till long after. I would here observe, that if Mr. <HI>R.</HI> had dealt fairly and ingenuously about the letters, and had read the whole every where, both in town and country, and, without commenting, had left every one to judge for themselves about the contents, I should never have had a thought of printing them. But it seems it would not answer his end, to have either his or my letter read in full; but they must be mangled and distorted in such manner, as to set people in a rage against me.</P>
<P>At length, after so much talk about <HI>private letters,</HI> he seems finally to give up all, and to grant that they were of a <HI>public nature p.</HI> 61. "What then, says he, does this give him a right to publish them with∣out my consent!" Yes, say I, because he and his adherents endeavored "to palm it upon the world," that they were just, good and necessary, yea, even <HI>meek</HI> letters, and that mine were bad and abusive to the last degree. "But what right had I to publish his letters any more than his sermon without his consent?" I answer, the case is vastly different; but if they were exactly parrellel, there are many cases wherein it is necessary to publish the whole or part of minister's sermons, particularly when they preach false doctrine, and persist in it after due admoniti∣on. It is an old saying <HI>that a minister</HI>'s <HI>sermon</HI> is no longer his own when he hath preached it. His hearers then have a right to take notice of it when, and how they please, especially if he hath deliver∣ed
<PB N="98" REF="012739_0095_0F8BEB0183A84F50"/>any thing that is wrong, and will not confess it, after proper means have been used to bring him to confession. Upon the whole here, what means all this heat about the letters? either they were <HI>just and good,</HI> or they were <HI>bad:</HI> if the former, who ever made such an ado before about having their <HI>good deeds</HI> published to the world? ought he not rather to thank me for it? if they were <HI>bad,</HI> why did he not confess it, and so put an end to the controver∣sy? I had left the communion (though not the meeting) upon the account of the letters, and was aspersed for it with the utmost diligence, as hav∣ing done it without sufficient grounds; Mr. <HI>R.</HI> justified his conduct in every part, and endeavored to prejudice people against me all manner of ways; he even cried out of <HI>persecution</HI> in the pulpit. What would I then do? what remedy had I left but to publish the letters, and let the church and world know how injuriously I was treated? I know it will signify nothing with those that will not so much as read my book; but I trust the impartial world will weigh things in an even ballance, and that they will acquit me from the heinous charges he brings against me as having acted "contrary to <HI>all</HI> the rules of <HI>politeness, humanity and christianity;</HI>" and "<HI>below</HI> the character of a <HI>man of benevolence and up∣rightness.</HI>" Yea, must he not acquit me himself? for if "I had wronged him 30 times more by my letter than he had me (as he has declared over and over) I had exposed myself 30 times more by the publication than I did him. If he <HI>believes himself,</HI> believes his own declarations, how can he justly fault me for what I have done? at lest how can he cry out of wrong and injury, when I had been on∣ly wronging myself? is all this concern manifested merely out of regard to my reputation? I think it unnecessary to say any more about the publication of the letters, though I could add many other particulars, if it were needful, in my own vindica∣tion. I would only further notice, that the design of this fearful outcry seems to be to divert people's minds from <HI>the merits of the cause,</HI> and to turn their attention from the abuses I have received, that I
<PB N="99" REF="012739_0096_0F913FFFC4E883F8"/>might have none to aid and assist me in seeking re∣lief; as a subtle bird will flutter and cry and run on, in order to draw people further from their nest.</P>
<P>Having thus chastised me for the <HI>publication</HI> of the letters, he next proceeds to consider the <HI>contents</HI> of them. He first tells us, "they contained his real sentiments, and that he had never seen cause to alter them." <HI>p.</HI> 61. Pray then what did he con∣fess at our meeting? for he would bear the world in hand, that he offered me <HI>all proper satisfaction:</HI> but this now appears by his own words to be no∣thing at all. Alas! what a cheat did he design to put upon me by a few doubtful words artfully put together? he then gives his grounds for writing. 1st. "That I had delivered things of VERY danger∣ous tendency." Let the reader look into my 3d. Essay, and he will see that this is without founda∣tion. 2d. "That I had grosly misrepresented him." How? by saying that he "was for obliging persons to come immediately into full communion." (Essays. <HI>p.</HI> 26.) This could not be a <HI>ground</HI> of his writing, because this expression was never read in public, but was afterwards added, when I tran∣scribed the Essays for the press, by way of expla∣nation. But however the thing is true; he is for <HI>obliging</HI> them two ways. 1st. By denying them any privilege, if they will not come immediately into full communion. 2d. By intimating frequently, that the church ought to call them to an account, if they do not come.</P>
<P>He adds as another ground of his writing, "that I had charged him with <HI>speaking slightingly of relati∣ons." p.</HI> 62. How short is his memory? this passage was not contained in any of my Essays, but is only to be found in my answer to his letter. And how could he tell without a prophetic spirit what I would write before-hand? or how could that be a ground of writing his letter, which was not wrote till after I had received his letter? this shows in what a careless random manner he makes his re∣marks. Other instances will occur presently. As for the other things that I charge him with, re∣specting
<PB N="100" REF="012739_0097_0F8BE2045596CF48"/>relations, he plainly owns them to be true. <HI>p.</HI> 63. And as to the phrase <HI>speaking slightingly</HI> &amp;c. the chief I meant by it was, that he slighted <HI>the use</HI> of them, by holding them unnecessary, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which he plainly confesses.</P>
<P>Another instance of misrepresentation he says is in <HI>p.</HI> 32. of the Essays, wherein I assert, "that the new plan supposes it necessary that candidates have a certain knowlege or assurance of their gra∣cious state." My words are, "the new plan sup∣poses it necessary, that all candidates should have clear evidence, if not assurance of their regene∣rate state" As much as to say, that if they do not hold <HI>assurance,</HI> yet at lest they hold <HI>clear evidences</HI> to be necessary. And is not this the case? surely he does not hold that <HI>dark evidence</HI> is sufficient. Again, under the same head, I use the term <HI>good evidence;</HI> and does he think, that <HI>bad evidence</HI> will do? he then goes further than I. What little ground then had he for that exclamation in his letter; "you, sir, do <HI>certainly know,</HI> that neither I nor they hold to such things as you there advanced as being our sentiments?" which is founded upon this pas∣sage of the Essays.</P>
<P>Another misrepresentation is, "that he was for driving on with <HI>violence. p.</HI> 63. Let any one read over his letters again, and they will find <HI>violence</HI> enough. In what a jehu-like manner does he drive on? what method does he take to terrify me and others from free-speaking and opposing him in public any more? besides many other proofs, that might be mentioned, but I must not write a volume.</P>
<P>A third reason of writing his letter was "the unfair methods I took, working upon people's pas∣sions instead of reason, <HI>&amp;c. p.</HI> 63.— In his letter he represents <HI>the whole</HI> of my piece to be of this teno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but now it seems it was only two or three short passages. The rest then must be addressed to "their reason and judgment." And why would not he allow me to mix a word or two of the <HI>pathetic</HI> with this? it would be a dry piece indeed, if there was nothing said to move the affections in such a con∣cerning
<PB N="101" REF="012739_0098_0F8BE206949AD760"/>point, no less than the unchurching our children. And that it was really an unchurching or <HI>excommunicating</HI> them, I think has been fully proved; so that I appealed to men's reason and judgment, as well as passions in the case. I must add here, if these baptized childred are <HI>lambs</HI> (as he seems to grant, <HI>p.</HI> 64.) they ought to be treated as <HI>lambs,</HI> not as <HI>dogs</HI> only to be whiped. <HI>Whipping</HI> is indeed sometimes necessary for <HI>children,</HI> but <HI>only</HI> to be whiped is to treat them worse than <HI>dogs.</HI> For he seems to suppose, that they are <HI>the subjects of discipline,</HI> in some parts of his book (though I can not find that he di∣rectly asserts it) when he laments the want of disci∣pline. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>As for the expression <HI>"sprung from hell"</HI> p. 65. Do not all practices that are "wrong and erroneous" spring from hell? And must not the brethren ne∣cessarily say, this practice sprung from thence, if they voted it out? must I then be faulted for speak∣ing of things as they are? or for representing the truth in a strong light? is he afraid of the light?</P>
<P>The next "unfair method I used, was, quoting <HI>Isai.</HI> lxvi. 5." <HI>p.</HI> 62, 5. Concerning this I think I have said enough in my letter, which he takes not the least notice of, but goes on to represent things in the worst colors. If he will have it after all that I pronounced <HI>curses</HI> upon him; let me tell him, the curse seems <HI>already</HI> come, upon him in full weight and measure, and I hope and pray that he never may feel it in higher degrees: the <HI>curse</HI> is <HI>shame.</HI> And is it not evident from his conduct, that he is <HI>really and greatly ashamed of his letters,</HI> tho' he be too <HI>haughty</HI> to own it? how comes he else to call me "unpolite, inhuman, and unchristian" in publishing them? and why such a noise about it for many months to∣gether? I wonder he had not brought a new charge of <HI>cursing</HI> upon my reminding him of that text, <HI>Matt.</HI> xviii. 6. in my letter. (See Essays. <HI>p.</HI> 43.) He hath such a knack at commenting, he might have made it appear in as hedious a light as the text under consideration. As to my pointing at him when I read the text, I have no remembrance of it. <HI>I</HI> have a common motion of one hand when speaking in
<PB N="102" REF="012739_0099_0F8BE20724931150"/>public, which he might take for pointing, as I stood facing him. As for addressing the <HI>baptized in general,</HI> as he represents both in <HI>p.</HI> 62, and 65. it is utterly unfair to give such a representation to the world. I only spake to those of <HI>"good conversation:" many</HI> of whom stood ready to renew their baptismal cove∣nant, as he himself tells us, <HI>p.</HI> 65. but were prevent∣ed by his shutting the door against them. And I thought I ought to give them a word of comfort under the dark cloud that was hanging over them. And as I had then, so I have still a strong faith, that this practice will never be wholly banished out of this church, though it may be suspended for a while. Perhaps after I am dead and gone, these words may be remembered. The promise is sure. <HI>Isai.</HI> lvii. 17. 1st. <HI>cl.</HI></P>
<P>With this text, he couples a sentence belonging to another head "the plea or pretence is grace." But is not the word pretence or pretension some∣times used in a good sense? but if it be taken in the worst sense, is there no grounds for it? no doubt <HI>many</HI> act sincerely and conscienciously in the affair: but can it be deemed any other than <HI>pretence</HI> in those that take the most <HI>ungracious methods</HI> to propa∣gate the cause? filling the whole town and country with lyes and false representations: dropping the most notorious libels in the streets, or posting them up in public places; printing a most infamous advertisement, to blast the credit of my book and the author? endeavoring to get the book suppress∣ed or burnt, by carring the most barefaced false∣hoods to the printer! and many other such like things? but who hath done this? none I believe doubts but that some of the <HI>warmest zealots</HI> in the affair had a principal hand in the whole. And what can it be but <HI>pretence</HI> in one of the hottest advocates for the new scheme, who in former years actually owned the covenant among us, but hath not as yet come to full communion? can a man be <HI>sincere</HI> in fighting against himself?</P>
<P>He concludes about his letter with observing, "That <HI>all the while</HI> I was treating of this affair at the church-meeting, I appeared to be in as great
<PB N="103" REF="012739_0100_0F8BE20C533AF940"/>heat and vehemence of temper, as ever he saw a man, on any such occasion in his life. And that this was the observation of <HI>multitudes,</HI> as well as his own." <HI>p.</HI> 65. But there was not multitudes there, how then could they observe it? I am sure I never heard of such an observation made by the spectators be∣fore.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have been informed, that the few <HI>indifferent</HI> spectators from other parishes, universally observed after the meeting, that the anger and vehemence was all on the other side.</NOTE> And is not this observation utterly repug∣nant to the tenor of his letter? we hear nothing there of anger and bad temper, but only of "passi∣onate exclamations and pathetic addresses, and seem∣ing affectionateness, popular harangues, and appeals to men's passions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Even such an <HI>artful method</HI> in general, as tended to gain the populace and to fill their minds with prejudices against his." But now it seems nothing but tempest and hurricane, or vio∣lence, heat and anger appeared in me, and that thro' the whole meeting. A sur method not to captivate and charm the hearers, but to ruin myself and cause. And with what an ill grace do <HI>angryness</HI> and <HI>affectionate∣ness</HI> seem to be coupled together?<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">If I was in such a passion as he tells of, I think he ought to have reproved me for it in a friendly manner, either by word or writing; this would have afforded sufficient ground for a <HI>letter of castigation:</HI> but not a word of this in his letter, but quite reverse: which shows, that the account he now gives is but <HI>a late invention,</HI> to serve a present turn.</NOTE> But if I was in such a heat and passion must there not be some <HI>cause</HI> for it? and why does he not set that down? was it because he overcame me in argument? no; he never pretended to give a <HI>direct</HI> answer to any of my arguments. Was it because the church were not willing to hear me? no; many of the church pushed me forward to speak, and there seemed a general disposition to hear me in all the meetings, except the last. Was it because the major part of the church appeared disposed to cast out the practice? no; the contrary appeared in all our meetings; and I much question whe∣ther
<PB N="104" REF="012739_0101_0F8BE20D4A2394C0"/>he could get a vote for it even now, when he hath put the generality into a flame. Why then should I manifest such heat and anger? for my part, I am not conscious of <HI>much</HI> anger at that meeting; (nay rather <HI>too little,</HI> considering my pro∣vocations.) I am sure I did not read my piece in an angry tone and accent, (of this he himself clears me in his letter: I was silent the much greater part of the meeting, being not well: I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at with patience to hear him read his <HI>collection</HI> (though I thought it not much to the purpose) which lasted about an hour and a quarter or more. And when he <HI>hist</HI> or <HI>pished</HI> at my Essays (which he did several times and at great length) I manifested not the least resentment. Although it be the <HI>highest indig∣nity,</HI> that can be offered to a man in the literary world, I did not so much as let him know I heard him; which shows, that I had some command of my passions. And the only times I spake with heat was, when he broke in upon me and interrupted me in reading my piece, endeavoring to hinder my going on, (which he did frequently:) and I think this was a just ground of resentment; especially when I had patiently and without interruption heard his piece, which was more than as long again as mine. At these times, I claimed my pri∣vilege with some warmth; and told him, that as a member I had a right to speak, and would speak, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And by this means I at last got through, though with much difficulty.</P>
<P>If he should say, he interrupted me, because I would not give others opportunity to speak, and because our side monopolized most of the talk to themselves. This could not be the case; for none of his side of the question ever attempted to speak to the <HI>merits of the cause</HI> in any of our meetings, except he himself: (so that, altho' <HI>"the most godly,"</HI> they did not manifest any <HI>super-eminence of knowlege.</HI>) we should have been <HI>glad</HI> to have heard them, if they had had any thing to say, and would readily have given way: but they seemed all to depend upon him, and implicitly to receive what he said for truth. And as for himself, he argued as much and as long as he pleased, without interruption.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="012739_0102_0F8BE20DC6C857E8"/>
In something the like sort, (though not so grosly) he treated deacon <HI>F.</HI> The deacon in the preceed∣ing meetings had said but little; but was now determined to speak his whole mind, and argue the point at some length. He began—but had scarce uttered a sentence or two, before Mr. <HI>R.</HI> (who stood facing him) attempting to answer, and so kept doing as fast as the deacon uttered any thing new, (though he begged not to be interrupt∣ed) that after a few minutes he was forced to desist. And hath had no opportunity of declar∣ing his full sentiments to the church to this day. Of this the deacon much complained the evening after. And another of the deacons he endeavor∣ed to stop in the same manner while speaking; but when that would not do, he (with a peremp∣tory tone and with a slap of his hand on the seat) bad him <HI>sit down;</HI> which the deacon readily obeyed.</P>
<P>But was there no passion on Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s side at this meet∣ing? we hear not a word of that. Though as soon as I had mentioned that text in <HI>Isaiah,</HI> he appeared all in a flame:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His repeated <HI>hissing</HI> or <HI>pishing</HI> was previous to this, when he appeared otherwise to be in a <HI>perfect calm,</HI> name∣ly, while my 2d. Essay was in reading, which was done by one of the deacons at the beginning of the meeting, I be∣ing too much indisposed to read both Essays. But the 3d. Essay I delivered myself, towards the close of the meeting, when he was too angry to <HI>hiss.</HI> I would here mention a <HI>curious anecdote</HI> about this <HI>hissing:</HI> when my book first came out, he said, <HI>"that was a lye, for he did not hiss, but only pished;"</HI> as if <HI>pishing</HI> was not a species of <HI>hissing.</HI> But if my cars deceived me not, there was <HI>hissing</HI> in more senses than one. This <HI>lye</HI> he hath not seen meet to record in his book, but seems to have reserved it for the private use of his own auditors; It was they alone, that were to be entertained with this curi∣ous and notable distinction.</NOTE> and it continued all the remain∣der of the meeting; and the reader will easily see, that he had not got over it, 4 days after, when he wrote his lettter; yea, it is evident by his book,
<PB N="106" REF="012739_0103_0F8BE20E84A56460"/>that he hath not got over it to this day, although I made him something of a confession in my letter. (Essays. <HI>p.</HI> 39.) But how did his passion manifest itself at the meeting? why he appeared to be in the greatest agitation; sometimes sitting down, then suddenly starting up, then sitting and rising again, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> talking to himself, blurting out short sentences to those that stood near him, shaking his head, scowling, (not to say <HI>grinning</HI>) stamping, fre∣quent interrupting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In short, he appeared to be in as great a tempest of passion, as ever I saw a man in my life, (and so but an ill judge of other's passions). And his whole deportment during the two last meetings was unbecoming a <HI>moderator,</HI> (not to say more:) insomuch that I have frequently said, that if the <HI>moderator</HI> of a town-meeting, or the <HI>speaker</HI> of the general assembly should behave in such manner, they would be in danger of being thrown off the bench with violence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For such reasons as these, the deacons asked the advice of an ordination council at <HI>Middleborough</HI> a few weeks after, whether it were not proper for the church to have <HI>another moderator</HI> (viz. a neighboring minis∣ter) at the next meeting. They did not indeed give a <HI>particular detail</HI> of their <HI>reasons,</HI> out of <HI>tenderness</HI> to Mr. <HI>R.</HI> but only in general, that Mr. <HI>R.</HI> being one party and the church the other, whether it would not be advisable upon this ground? But Mr. <HI>R.</HI> who was present, would not hear a word of it, though, as I am informed, the ministers <HI>advised</HI> to it; which advice Mr. <HI>R.</HI> wholly denied <HI>in the face of the church,</HI> when reminded of it at the next meeting.</P>
<P>I now come to his animadversions on my letter. And here upon entrance I must note, that he whol∣ly omits one thing with which he inflamed com∣mon people as much as any thing; my calling him <HI>"school-boy."</HI> (Essays. <HI>p.</HI> 41.) This was long in every one's mouth, but it seems it would not bear publi∣cation. Another thing omitted is, "the glaring inconsistencies in my letter, which he forebore pointing out, least it should put me to pain." (See his 2d. letter. <HI>p.</HI> 49.) We hear not a word of this in his book. Perhaps he still forebore, out of tender∣ness
<PB N="107" REF="012739_0104_0F8BE20F46B03050"/>to me, least he should "give me some pain and uneasiness." He likewise omits remarking about "his provoking letters to the precinct committee." This was too tender a string to touch upon. I believe they would have proved fatal to him, if they had been brought into public; but we of the committee endeavored to stifle them: so far were <HI>we</HI> from seeking his hurt; though we were censured by many for it.</P>
<P>The first thing he animadverts upon is, that it is intimated in the Essays, "he had turned away or <HI>refused</HI> some who had offered to own the covenant." <HI>p.</HI> 65. It is amazing to me, that such stress is laid upon this. The question I believe has been put scores of times, both in church-meeting and out, by himself and others, <HI>"who was ever denied?"</HI> and with∣al added, that it is time enough to complain, and to have church-meetings, when instances of refusal appear, and individuals enter complaint of being debared. But is not a <HI>general denial</HI> equivalent to a thousand particular ones? has he not denied them in his sermons, in all his discourses public and pri∣vate, for above two years past, yea, and in his book, <HI>p.</HI> 2. "I thought it my duty (says he there) to desist the practice?" And yet he still dins us with this question, <HI>who was ever denied?</HI> it makes me perfectly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick to hear so much of it. He tells us, <HI>p.</HI> 65. "<HI>many</HI> have frequently discoursed with him on the affair, and wished that it might be peaceably settled, that they might bring their children." <HI>i. e.</HI> They wish∣ed that he would take off the bar he had laid in their way, and allow them to come. And is not this all the <HI>application,</HI> that persons can well make under the present situation of things? but the <HI>particular person</HI> he refers to, went much further than this; he discoursed with him no less than 3 times on the affair, with direct design to have been admitted, if he would have suffered it; nay, he went so far as to tell him, that if he could not have his children baptized, he would apply to Mr. <HI>T—n,</HI> the church minister, though he did not indeed in terms ask him to propound him the next sabbath. Mr. <HI>R.</HI> would no doubt have been affronted if he had gone
<PB N="108" REF="012739_0105_0F8BE1FF9155BA98"/>so far as this, after he had so fully declared his principles.</P>
<P>The next thing is, "that I give a wrong turn to that expression of his, <HI>the most godly</HI> among us, both men and women, are on his side." <HI>p.</HI> 65. The ex∣pression is so plain in itself, that it is incapable of a <HI>wrong turn,</HI> though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e endeavors to give it, but in vain.</P>
<P>He then faults me "for expressing <HI>my fears,</HI> that he converses too little with his flock to pass a judg∣ment, who are the most godly, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" <HI>p.</HI> 66 For my part I never heard of any <HI>pastoral visits,</HI> except to the <HI>sick</HI> or <HI>bereaved.</HI> But I have frequently heard com∣plaints, that he visited but little, except a few in∣dividuals. How then could he know much who "lived nearest to God, or who enjoyed most of the life, power and sweetness of experimental religion?" He hath indeed visited greatly, and almost univers∣ally for about fifteen months past. But I am apt to think that the discourse hath been generally taken up with <HI>something else</HI> besides experiences. And I suppose the real foundation he goes upon in asserting, that he hath the most godly on his side, is this, the brethren with him, several of them, were received by himself, and so he had particular occasion and opportunity to discourse with them about their acquaintance with experimental religi∣on. But as to the members received in Mr. <HI>Leonard's</HI> days, I believe he scarce knows any thing about them, except such as have particularly applied to him under distress of conscience. "I utter this with christian temper," and as my real persuasion: perhaps he would not believe me if I added, "that I <HI>felt good natured</HI>" too, and heartily pitied him that he was <HI>left</HI> to give such wrong accounts to the world.</P>
<P>"As for his being more a <HI>favorite</HI> with the women than I am," <HI>p.</HI> 66. He himself acknowleges, that he could see nothing amiss in the expression. But some elbow friend hath suggested, that I had <HI>a bad design</HI> in it. And he seems ready upon it to "demand an <HI>explanation.</HI>" All the explanation I shall give him is, that it is <HI>his voice</HI> and nothing else <HI>(nihil pre∣terea)</HI> that has produced this effect. It is surprising that he should take such notice of this passage as he here does, or indeed any notice of it at all. But
<PB N="109" REF="012739_0106_0F8BE21004993730"/>what opportunity does he miss to bring an "odium" upon me among his more thoughtless hearers? can not one man be more favored than another, even by <HI>women,</HI> without "some reflection on his cha∣racter?" it would then be a dangerous thing to be a <HI>popular preacher.</HI></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 66. He apears "greatly surprized at that group of extravagant expressions, thundering anathema, authoritatively denounced for advancing such <HI>per∣nitious, soul-damning destructive</HI> doctrines." But why this surprize? I appeal to the whole <HI>learned</HI> world, whether I don't give a just and natural paraphrase upon the passages of his letters. What more or worse could he have said to <HI>Arius, Socinus, Pelagius</HI> or <HI>Arminius,</HI> if they were now living? The preamble is awful, the sentence se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere, the grounds of it most striking and terrible: no less than "the <HI>subversion</HI> and <HI>overthrow</HI> of the <HI>grand doctrines</HI> of the gospel. This is the <HI>direct</HI> and <HI>unavoidable</HI> tendency of my opi∣nion.

And what is this but <HI>"a thundering ana∣thema?"</HI> an excommunication from <HI>ministerial com∣munion</HI> with a witness? I appeal to every minister in the land, whether the term was too harsh. And this <HI>ana∣thema</HI> he hath never yet offered to take off: so that if I had consented to his proposals of accommodation at our meet∣ing, I must have laid under the weight of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>accursed still,</HI> though other preachers of the same principles are freely admitted.</NOTE> And "should be guilty of the GREATEST unfaithfulness to God and his people, if he did not oppose me with all his might, or to the UTMOST of his power." (See Es∣says. <HI>p.</HI> 36, 48.) How then could I express these things in too strong a light? "This is <HI>all,</HI>" says Mr. <HI>R.</HI> and a great ALL it appears to be.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="012739_0107_0F8BE210C858FE50"/>
As to "the <HI>brethren's</HI> being involved in the same doom," it is as evident as the light, that all that hold the same principles as I do (whether mini∣sters or brethren) are as guilty as I am, and must necessarily stand or fall with me.</P>
<P>As for the expression, "especially those of note." <HI>p.</HI> 66. I had grounds for putting it in, but I must not particularly explain myself. The reason is ob∣vious to a thoughtful reader</P>
<P>He next attacks my <HI>post-script,</HI> (<HI>p.</HI> 67) which he calls "a most peculiar one of it's kind. I misquote him, says he, and pervert his meaning in almost every passage." Let the reader compare the quo∣tations with his letters, and they will find it other∣wise. I do not indeed exactly quote his words, (that would have made my letter too long) but I endeavored to collect his <HI>evident meaning</HI> into a nar∣row compass, using chiefly his own expressions. "But he will not own the letter in this dress." Why then does he not give it another dress, and tell us his meaning? why did he not paraphrase his letter particularly, and show that the passages import something else? and not think to come off by saying in general, "he did not mean so?" How easy is it to get rid of the blackest charges, if this be sufficient?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That Mr. <HI>R.</HI> intended to carry matters as far as I have repre∣sented, appears from a passage that I have never yet parti∣cularly noticed, <HI>viz.</HI> Those words of his letter "it ap∣pears to me when you come calmly to reflect upon it, it must excite penitential shame, and be matter of DEEP humiliation before God." (Essays. p. <HI>34.</HI>) If so, it must be a DEEP crime that I was guilty off! a crime of a most aggravated nature, (of a scarlet color and crimson dye:) for there must be a <HI>proportion</HI> between the crime and penitence. <HI>Deep contrition</HI> pre-supposes <HI>deep guilt.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Well, but what was the effect of my "dressing up his letter in a garb of my own manufacture?" How did it's "ugly hue" or appearence operate upon me? why it seems it sets me <HI>"a raving." p.</HI> 61. "It puts me out of all patience, so that unable to
<PB N="111" REF="012739_0108_0F8BE211CABFD4C0"/>contain, I cry out, <HI>thundering anathema, soul-damning doctrines,</HI> &amp;c." There is not such a word in all my post-script. They were contained in the body of the letter, and relate to another matter. "But what was the occasion of all this vehemence? why, because he had said, "my doctrines were of an <HI>arminian</HI> tendency, and that he could not en∣courage my instructions." <HI>p.</HI> 68. I think such a representation is "enough to put one out of all patience." I was not speaking of <HI>doctrines</HI> and in∣structions, but of his charge of <HI>deceit</HI> and <HI>hypocrisy</HI> and <HI>crafty management,</HI> which he that runs may read, in the first part of his letter. And my account of this I think is just. (See Essays. <HI>p.</HI> 45, 6.) And what will the reader think of a man, that will thus in open light endeavor to impose upon him, when he may be so easily convicted? and what stress can be laid upon his representations in other matters? certainly he takes his readers to be as careless and inadvertent as himself. He here indeed designed to be <HI>witty,</HI> but his <HI>wit</HI> comes at the expence of <HI>truth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 67. He says, "I charge him with <HI>breaking open</HI> a letter." How carelessly does he write? I charge him with no such thing. I supposed at the time, that the letter came to him inclosed and unsealed. But what I taxed him with, was, <HI>erasing part of a letter.</HI> This he acknowleges, but endeavors to excuse it. But this I observe, that nothing appears, even from his own account, that his <HI>father</HI> commissioned him <HI>to expunge any passage of the letter;</HI> but only left it to him, either to send or not to send it, as he thought best. He hath told what the erased pas∣sages were, and I believe told me right. And I cannot help observing upon it, his haughty mind could not brook any thing, that looked like <HI>intreaty.</HI> He scorned to have thought, that either he or his friends had any apprehension of it's being in <HI>my power</HI> to do him the least hurt. I would add, that it was these very erasures, that made me misunder∣stand his father's intent.</P>
<P>He appears next to be mightily offended at the intimation, "that he had been obliged to <HI>retract</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="012739_0109_0F8BE2124BC5AC00"/>some opinions which he had <HI>learned</HI> from Mr. <HI>B." p.</HI> 68. By being obliged, I meant obliged in consci∣ence and from conviction. And that he had learn∣ed them from Mr. <HI>B.</HI> I had reason to think, be∣cause we had none of these doctrines in his first years, but immediately after the publication of se∣veral of Mr. <HI>B</HI>'s books. The doctrines were such as these, "that men are regenerated <HI>without</HI> the word of truth; that they love God, love his law, and repent of sin, <HI>before</HI> they have any true know∣lege or discovery of <HI>Jesus</HI> the mediator, or of God in Christ as reconcilable to sinners; before union to Christ, faith in the atonement and justification in the sight of God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" These and the like doctrines were preached for years, and inculcated with the utmost earnestness, which caused almost <HI>a general uneasiness:</HI> insomuch that some have told me, "they wondered how I could sit with pati∣ence and hear him, and not immediately rise up and oppose him." But a reverend and worthy gentleman coming from <HI>Connecticut,</HI> on a visit, he preached a sabbath in <HI>direct opposition</HI> to Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s doctrines. With which Mr. <HI>R.</HI> was gratified; and he told me himself the same week, "that Mr. <HI>H—t's</HI> sermon and discourse after meeting, had gi∣ven him a new train of ideas, and things appeared to him in quite a different light from what they did before." And since that, his preaching has been generally in quite another strain and tenor; and people I believe have universally thought, that he was come off from his former notions. But now it seems, "he hath never retracted or seen cause to retract any sentiments in divinity, which he formerly held, but still thinks them agreable to the word of God." Hear this, O people and con∣sider. Mr. <HI>R.</HI> still holds the same principles (he tells you so himself) which in former years filled you with grief and uneasiness, and caused many tears. And may you not expect they will be re∣vived upon you in full weight and measure, as soon as the times will bear it? we had a specimen of it some little time after he received my letter; which I took to be occasioned by this very passage
<PB N="113" REF="012739_0110_0F8BE218CAE84450"/>of the letter, to let me know that he still held Messieurs <HI>B</HI>'s and <HI>H—n</HI>'s doctrines as much as ever. He preached from <HI>Luke</HI> xv. 24. and advanced, that the begetting spiritual life or regeneration was an immediate act of the spirit <HI>without the word.</HI> And that faith, repentance, love, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were the <HI>fruits</HI> and effects of regeneration, and no essential parts of it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These sermons were disgustful to several, and three of us the next morning sent him the following script.

<SALUTE>Sir.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE think it our duty to testify our dislike of the doct∣rine delivered yesterday. It was then advanced, that regeneration was wrought by a divine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> act, <HI>without,</HI> and independent of all means, and previous to faith, repentance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which we apprehended contrary to the scripture. For 1st. the apostles over and over as∣sert, that regeneration is wrought through means. <HI>I have begotten you, says</HI> Paul, <HI>through the gos∣pel. Beholding as in a glass</HI> (i. e. the word ap∣plied) <HI>the glory of the Lord, we are changed into the same image,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Of his own will be∣gat he us with the word of truth. Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of in∣corruptible, by the word of God. By the great and precious promises, we become partakers of the divine nature,</HI> &amp;c. 2d. The doctrine ad∣vanced makes union to Christ no <HI>part,</HI> but an <HI>effect</HI> of regeneration, whereas it is an <HI>essential part</HI> of rege∣neration. <HI>If a man be in Christ,</HI> says the apostle, <HI>he is a new creature,</HI> new-born, <HI>2 Cor. v. 17.</HI> and regeneration is described by this phrase, <HI>Christ liveth in me.</HI> Gal. <HI>iii. 20. He that hath the son, hath life,</HI> says St. John, <HI>and he that hath not the son of God, hath not life. 1</HI> John <HI>v. 12.</HI> 3d. This contradicts the apostle, when he says, <HI>faith comes by hearing:</HI> according to this new doctrine it comes from regeneration, and not from hearing and applying the word. All the proof you brought for your new doctrine was from <HI>John i. 12.13.</HI> which is nothing to the purpose: for <HI>receiving Christ</HI> is in the pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter-perfect tense, as well as <HI>being born,</HI> &amp;c. which implies that they are coeval, or really the same thing in other words. Whereas according to you; <HI>receiving Christ</HI> must be in the present tense, and <HI>being born</HI> in the praeter perfect, contrary to the very letter of the text. Upon the whole, we apprehend your notion of regeneration to be a mere <HI>chimera,</HI> and that it never had an existence but in the brain of Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and his followers. We rest your dissatisfied brethren.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This, though a <HI>private letter, and designed</HI> as such, Mr. <HI>R.</HI> immediately published (without returning us any ans∣wer either by word or writing) presently after taking horse, and communicating it about the town; and in his return reading it at the water side in the open air to a company gathered round him. And the next sabbath, the whole affair was carried to <HI>Plimpton</HI> upon a change. And the sabbath after we were lashed to purpose, he endeavoring to refute our paper; though by the way he said nothing about the <HI>instrumentaliy of the word.</HI></P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="012739_0111_0F8BE21B02D14488"/>
He, in fine, appears much chagrined at a para∣graph in my letter, which he still says was "wrote on the sabbath." <HI>p.</HI> 68. It is strange he keeps in∣sisting on this, when I had told him it was wrote in the evening (when according to his principles) the sabbath was ended. The paragraph related to that passage in his prayer, <HI>let them not shun,</HI> &amp;c. (Essays. <HI>p.</HI> 47.) And this was spoken, I am persuad∣ed, when he was under an <HI>impressive sense</HI> of <HI>something else</HI> besides divine things;" for he spoke in an an∣gry tone and with vehemence, "as his manner is," when he is preaching against <HI>lay-teachers,</HI> or those that tax him with false doctrine. As to what fol∣lows, "that he had omitted many heads of divini∣ty in his preaching," I am really sorry for his sake that I sat it down. But it came in so apprope, that I could not well omit it. But alas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is too true. He confines himself chiefly to <HI>affectionate sub∣jects,</HI> and neglects explaining doctrines, and the nature of ordinances too much. (Which I have heard observed and lamented by others as well as myself.<NOTE N="{inverted ⁂}" PLACE="foot">Behold the man, that cries out of the publishing private letters!</NOTE>) So that I fear <HI>ignorance</HI> will greatly pre∣vail
<PB N="115" REF="012739_0112_0F8BEA4ADE634818"/>in the next generation: and indeed some have occasionally observed to me, that it does so too much already; more than ever was known before in this town: (one proof of it is <HI>their readiness,</HI> yea, <HI>even fondness to be unchurched or excommunicated,</HI> upon Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s bare word, without exhibiting any valid evidence; as sure there was none before his book came out, whatever there is now.) On this head of <HI>preaching</HI> I could say much more, but my heart recoils at the thought. I would gladly have omit∣ed this and several other paragraphs in <HI>printing</HI> the letters out of regard to him; but I knew what a fearful outcry (worse than "cants") would have been raised, that I had <HI>altered</HI> the letters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that I sat down every <HI>iota.</HI> I should have freely told him my thoughts upon this and several other heads "in a friendly manner," if he had given op∣portunity by frequent visits and an unreserved in∣timacy; but it seems he thought it best to keep at a distance (except in his distressing hours.) And if I had gone to his house to have talked of such things, such is his temper, that he would have been apt to have construed it <HI>insult,</HI> and I might have expected to have heard it proclaimed (as he is little capable of keeping secrets, to my disad∣vantage. I have had experience of something of this kind, and so have others. Upon the whole here, if instead of taking offence, and turning it into a jest, he had reformed and enlarged his plan of preaching, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it would have been much better. But I am informed, he still goes on in the old track, chiefly, if not wholly, confining himself to <HI>affectionate subjects</HI> and herein even abounding more and more, which seems calculated to retain the affections of his hearers. And further to captivate, he preaches of late much <HI>without notes,</HI> by reason of which much <HI>crude matter</HI> (I hear) is poured forth as well as repetitions, the same thing recurring over and over.</P>
<P>Having done with the letters, he comes to what he calls "my catalogue of charges." <HI>p.</HI> 69. The reader will observe, that they are <HI>bare facts,</HI> set down without the least comment. How far is this
<PB N="116" REF="012739_0113_0F8BEA4B80F719D0"/>from his treatment of me? ill-natured comments, and the worst constructions occurring every where. These charges were, it seems "a potion as bitter" as aloes. Yet have they not had "salutary effects?" Have they not in a great measure prevented irretat∣ing things being brought into the pulpit, which were so frequent before? but being pent up there, he gives himself the more vent in his book, and in his abundant visits. But how does he clear him∣self from these charges? some are not mentioned, therefore stand confessed, as that of <HI>hissing,</HI> &amp;c. "Pointed psalms" he denies; and says, "the <HI>psalms</HI> were sung in course." But did he sing the 12th psalm in course? this was sung the sabbath before the last church-meeting; and it would have come in course in about 3 weeks or a month: but it seems he skipt over 4 or 5 psalms to come at it: and then returned back. When this <HI>psalm</HI> was read, those that were in the <HI>secret</HI> of that meeting were variously affected, several were upon the ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ter, and one man was observed to bow down his head, and thrust his handkerchief in his mouth, that he might not be seen to laugh. This was in the forenoon. In the afternoon, the <HI>psalms</HI> are not sung in course; so that he is at liberty to suit all occasions. And whether he had not these debates sometimes in mind, the reader may judge by omit∣ting that stanza, <HI>Psal.</HI> xviii. 17. when he came to it in course, wherein are these words, <HI>"the weak de∣fence that I could make." (Tate</HI> and <HI>Brady.</HI>) Which might be passed least <HI>profane wits</HI> should <HI>burlesque</HI> and <HI>scoff.</HI> Sometimes some of his strong adherents have observed after meeting, that he suited the <HI>psalm</HI> to the times, or "that there was a <HI>psalm</HI> for us."</P>
<P>As for the <HI>sermon of triumph,</HI> he tells us, "It was made above a month before the church-meeting, and therefore he could not possibly know, or even <HI>sus∣pect</HI> what would then be done." I never heard be∣fore, nor I believe any one else of his making a stock of sermons before-hand. How comes he then so often to preach old sermons? But to let that pass. How various have been the reports about this ser∣mon?
<PB N="117" REF="012739_0114_0F8BE2034589B598"/>Sometimes it was said, that it was made a fortnight, sometimes 3 weeks before the meeting, sometimes that he had only begun it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But be that as it will, how can he say "that he did not <HI>even suspect</HI> what would be done at that meeting, when it was determined in the <HI>conclave</HI> what should be done? for one of his <HI>privy council</HI> told about pub∣licly, near <HI>two months</HI> before the meeting, "that they designed to have no more debates on the affair, but that the meeting should be dissolved." And an agent or agents were accordingly secretly sent about to get the major part of the members to sign for a dissolution; so that the sermon might be made in prospect of such an event; which I doubt not they deemed as certain. Here I would observe, that he preached 4 sermons from that text <HI>Isai.</HI> liv. 17. So that it was not a single sermon we controvert about. The first sabbath he carried the matter so far, that he seemed to make us all open enemies and adver∣saries of the church, seeking it's destruction by pro∣moting false professions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But this making a great noise, and producing severe reflections, even from some of his own side, he found, no doubt, that he had carried the matter too far; so that when the text came next under consideration, a fortnight after, he seemed to make a sort of retraction, re-as∣suming the first head (which to appearance he had finished) and shewed how even <HI>good men</HI> might, thro' <HI>ignorance</HI> or <HI>mistake,</HI> do that which was prejudicial to the church's welfare, and were so far enemies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To which we may add, that the first sabbath he preached from the text, the congregation seem∣ed all alive, and such whisperings there was after the conclusion of the services, as I scarce ever saw before; or such discoursings on both sides, after people had got out of the meeting-house; some saying, "they hoped deacon <HI>F.</HI> Mr. <HI>C.</HI> &amp;c. had got their belly full, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" And will he after all bear the world in hand, that he had "no design" in those sermons, "and that the thing was too low and ridiculous to mention, being founded on nothing but surmize and jealousy," and that "he always studiously avoided every thing that might be look∣ed
<PB N="118" REF="012739_0115_0F8BEA4C81F841D8"/>upon as pointed, or tending to irritate?" Upon the whole, whether these sermons were "sermons of triumph" or not, whether they had a retrospect, and looked backward or forward, or whether they are rightfully or wrongfully named in the Essays, these things are not material. It is certain the situ∣ation of the times gave birth to them, they were <HI>designedly</HI> and <HI>evidently pointed,</HI> and of this we complain.</P>
<P>As for the phrase "my friends and my enemies," the town can better judge of the truth of it than those that live at a distance (except the ministers of his acquaintance) and to them I leave it.</P>
<P>I come now to the <HI>cruellest</HI> part of his whole reply, it is filled with untrue suggestions and sur∣mises, calculated to represent me as one of the worst of men, having a heart fraught with malice and revenge, and bearing old grudges from year to year, and wanting nothing but an opportunity to mani∣fest and vent itself, and all without the least grounds, and even in such degree as he could not have thought possible before. <HI>p.</HI> 70, 71. "But pray let us get away from the noise of a torrent, and calmly enquire what it is that occasioned all this vehemence." Why, it seems chiefly founded upon a <HI>letter</HI> I sent him many years ago. But this he will not publish, being of a <HI>private nature,</HI> least he should follow my <HI>bad example.</HI> But did he not publish it in the time of it all over the parish, and even carry it to the association? and does he not <HI>worse</HI> than publish it now, giving hints that it contains something very bad, even so bad that it would not bear the light? and all this he hath done, without ever answering the letter, or ex∣changing one word with me about it from the time it was wrote to this day. I have had frequent intimations coming directly from him, that he designed to publish this letter at full length in his reply, but it seems some friend hath dissuaded him from it, lest it should expose him after his great outcry of publishing private letters. But he hath taken a method ten-fold more injurious. But what dreadful things were contained in that letter? the case was this; he hath discovered a disposition for
<PB N="119" REF="012739_0116_0F8BEA4D1E9DA580"/><HI>novelty,</HI> and <HI>arbitrary management</HI> ever since he came to the town: the instances are numerous; among other things he propounded <HI>a baptized person</HI> for full communion, that lay sick of a deep consumption, and was never like to go abroad again: this he did in the usual form, but <HI>without bringing a relation,</HI> or the least intimation that he designed to bring one; and proposed, that after the usual term of pro∣pounding was up, a number of the church should go with him to the house and actually receive her. I was dissatisfied with <HI>the thing itself,</HI> and <HI>the manner</HI> of his ushering it in; having heard more than once before, that he was grown weary of relations, and wanted them laid aside; and I really thought he took this opportunity of feeling the pulse of the church, how they stood affected to relations; and if they bore this well, we should hear no more of them, but he would lay them aside by his <HI>own authority.</HI> Upon this I wrote as follows.</P>

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THINK it my duty to bear testimony against <HI>despotic</HI> and absolute power in the church as well as the state. I never saw a more flagrant in∣stance of it than yesterday, in your propounding a per∣son for full communion, without making any sort of relation, contrary to the practice of this church for above 140 years, and in direct opposition to the vote of the church, of which you could not be ignorant. If you dislike the practice, this is not <HI>the right method</HI> to get it superseded; for surely the church will not be treated as a <HI>cypher,</HI> and suffer their votes to be trampled under foot without notice. I am <HI>sorry</HI> to see such stretches towards <HI>arbitrary power</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His disposition to arbitrary power appeared early, from his erasing out of his father's ordination sermon, when he transcribed it for the press, a passage wherein his father earnestly recommends it to him "to consult the elder bre∣thren or fathers of the church in all affairs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>noment." such it seems was his <HI>self-sufficiency,</HI> that he thought such advice needless.</NOTE> in this and other instances, but I advise you as a friend for the future to <HI>consult your

<P>The consequence was, he soon brought a relation, and the church having sometime after considered the affair, they appeared generally dissatisfied with the method proposed, looking upon it as <HI>a bad pre∣sident,</HI> and as really answering no end, unless <HI>a pri∣vate communion</HI> had followed, which does not well consist with the principles of dissenters: and they would vote no further, than that in case provi∣dence should restore her so that she was able to appear in public, they were ready to receive her; being in the mean time fully satisfied, <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>R.</HI> meerly upon this, baptized her children after her death; so that he does not look upon <HI>explicit covenant∣ing</HI> any more <HI>necessary,</HI> than I do.</NOTE> If Mr. <HI>R.</HI> should say, he always designed to bring a relati∣on, but had not time to pen it down, she living at a distance, why then did he not tell us so? this would have been fully satisfactory, the time of read∣ing it, whether at first propounding, as the custom is, or afterwards, being immaterial. As for his intimati∣on, "that none faulted him but I," it is wrong, I know of others that were uneasy, and the church in general disliked his proposal.</P>
<P>If any should think the letter was wrote in rather too sharp a style, they will not so much wonder at it, if they recollect what has been said about his treatment of me in his first years. That treatment naturally produced uneasiness. But upon Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s altering his conduct at and after the time of <HI>his great concern,</HI> all resentment subsided, and I was as ful∣ly reconciled as if nothing had happened.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He acknowleges, "I had shewed him instances of <HI>kind∣ness</HI> and <HI>friendship,</HI> since the letter." And in the same breath says, that at the very instant I bore him "a rooted prejudice." What a wretch, an hypocrite, does he make me? Even my very acts of kindness turn to my reproach: these it seems all come from a cankered invenomed heart. Alas! this is the effect of doing kindnesses for the UNGRATEFUL! "How discouraging to be always exposed to such CANTS!"</NOTE> And I
<PB N="121" REF="012739_0118_0F8BEA5277756EF8"/>might well say, "we hold a <HI>good correspondence</HI>" (which expression he mentions with a sneer and "with inverted <HI>commas.</HI>") I am sure it was so <HI>on my part.</HI> And if any <HI>"root of prejudice"</HI> remained, it must be on his side: and it appears too plainly that there was, by his raking up this letter at this day: and by the great use he hath made of it, in the present controversy. For it was represented all over the town after the late letters passed, that it was I that wrote the <HI>first letter</HI> and was the be∣ginner of the strife, and people were in a rage at me for it; and it was sometime before we could un∣deceive them about it. And the like report was carried to other towns. When the news reached me of my writing first, I could not imagine what it meant or whence it sprang; and it was some∣time before I could recollect that I had ever wrote him any offensive letter at all; so far was I from retaining it in my mind, or bearing him any old grudge or prejudice upon the account, or indeed on any other account. How ungrounded, and very injurious then is his representation of things? but he seems resolved to <HI>ruin</HI> me if possible, or to drive me to desperation. To this end he and his 2 emis∣saries have made it their business for a 12 month past to represent me every where, "as an impla∣cable, malicious, spiteful, revengeful man: one who, if once offended, will never forgive or be reconcil∣ed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" This is their constant theme in the house and <HI>by the way,</HI> where they think it will make impression. This they utter in discourse. This they write, and this they print. But God knows, and my own conscience knows, and the people lately my charge do universally know, that this is not my disposition, or turn of mind. I know I am naturally <HI>hasty</HI> and <HI>passionate:</HI> but rooted en∣mity and malice, and implacability are the remotest things possible from my natural temper. I dare appeal to his own father (a former intimate ac∣quaintance) for the truth of this; who I believe if he <HI>really knew</HI> how his son managed, would be far from countenancing him: the <HI>grieving</HI> of whom
<PB N="122" REF="012739_0119_0F8BEA530883A060"/>is what goes as near to me as almost any thing in the present controversy.</P>
<P>But why then am I not reconciled to Mr. <HI>R?</HI> has he not said and done enough to satisfy any reasonable man? but do not I remain inflexible? obstinately standing out against the advice of <HI>mini∣sters,</HI> and <HI>brethren,</HI> and <HI>others,</HI> who all with one voice cry out, that the <HI>satisfaction</HI> he offers is sufficient? thus he hath represented the matter to the world: how <HI>truly</HI> will presently appear. Reconciliation was what I had at heart, and truly sought, and was the <HI>first mover</HI> in it. At my request, deacon <HI>T.</HI> proposed a meeting to him with some brethren, he seemed not much inclined to it, and the deacon was forced to go backward and forward several times before the matter was fully settled: at length he complies upon these terms, "that there should be an equal number of the brethren on both sides, that the brethren should <HI>say nothing,</HI> but that all the talk should be between him and me,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The chief reason of this restriction I suppose to be, because he thought by his voluble tongue, and great flow of words to obtain an advantage against me, and so to drown and confuse me, if left alone: and that he took the advantage, appears from the <HI>narrative</HI> of the whole conference drawn up by a brother present. <Q>Mr. <HI>C.</HI> says he, often desired time to speak, told Mr. <HI>R.</HI> you break in upon me when I attempt to speak, and confuse me; but it signi∣fied no great matter, it appeared to me he did it on pur∣pose.</Q> I should be glad to insert the whole narrative, by which it would appear how unchristianly I was used; but it would lengthen out the book too much. If Mr. <HI>R.</HI> should say, that he had another reason for this restriction, namely. "because I insisted upon a particular brother's be∣ing present, who he did not want should speak." This no way militates with the reason I give, because that brother was the most capable of helping and assisting me, if there had been occasion; and perhaps he thought he could do well enough with the rest, if he was absent. If he should say, "it was not upon this account that he was for debarring that brother, but because of his unplacable turn of mind, and that his presence would rather hinder than promote a reconciliation." Such a suggestion would be <HI>unchristian</HI> to the last degree; and contrary to truth; <HI>none being more tender and helpful on such occasions</HI> (in which he had been much used) tho' I do not think he would have suffered me to have been <HI>trampled on.</HI> And besides, if Mr. <HI>R.</HI> was <HI>personally offended</HI> with him, there was more reason for his being present, that the recon∣ciliation might have been complete. I could not consent, that such a <HI>slight</HI> should be put upon one of the principle members of the church; and then I wanted him as an evi∣dence to some <HI>particulars,</HI> in case I could have brought Mr. <HI>R.</HI> to have talked of them. And surely it did not show much of a <HI>disposition for peace</HI> in Mr. <HI>R.</HI> to cast such contempt on a fellow-member, and a fellow sufferer with me, especially when I did not <HI>object</HI> against any brother of his choosing, though I had much more reason for it.</NOTE> and
<PB N="123" REF="012739_0120_0F8BEA53B483D900"/>that there should be no discourse upon <HI>any particular</HI> on either side, but that we should make up in a general way." I thought the terms hard; but ra∣ther than not meet, I complied; hoping to convince him of the unreasonableness of the preliminaries, and to bring him to allow the brethren to speak and mediate,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Two of the brethren that went with me have declared since, that if they had known of the terms before-hand, they would not have gone.</NOTE> and to a free discussion of particulars, with∣out which no good end could be answered by the meet∣ing. Well, we met, I carried; brethren with me, and found that he had invited 4, contrary to agree∣ment. I objected not, but presently proceeded to the business of the meeting. Having lamented the difference, and expressed my hop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of its being peaceably healed, I endeavored to draw him into a discourse of some particulars, telling him <HI>that deceit lay in generals,</HI> and that it was necessary to discourse on some things more particularly, or an amicable agreement could not be expected. But he utterly refused, and insisted on a general making up, and then declared the terms he would consent to, and nothing else; namely, "that as many things had been said on both sides that had better have never been said, he was willing to make mutual concessi∣ons
<PB N="124" REF="012739_0121_0F8BEA5600AC4590"/>to each other, and to bury the hatchet, and that we should both forget and forgive all that was past, and for the future live together in love." He ex∣presses the terms rather more largely in his book, but I am satisfied this account comes nearer the truth; and so say the brethren that were with me; the words being exactly cited from the narrative mentioned in the margin. I expressed my dissatis∣faction with this, and told him I did not think this a proper way of healing the breach. Upon which he replied very quick, and with a great deal of warmth, "you think I have injured you, I think you have injured me 30 times more by your letter, and I think it a peice of condescention in me, to go so far as I have offered." Which expressions were repeated in the course of the conversation. I think, more than once. After this I did, with difficulty, force him to discourse a little on 3 or 4 particulars. One was about "the <HI>most</HI> godly, being on his side." This I thought hard and uncharitable. He <HI>denied</HI> the charge, and insisted that he allowed those on our side to be <HI>equally</HI> godly, and referred to the pos∣cript for proof. I told him he spake of the one in the <HI>positive,</HI> and the other in the <HI>superlative</HI> degree, which was an evident preferrence. But still he kept <HI>denying,</HI> and so I left it, and let him have the last word. Another particular was about <HI>arminianism:</HI> he told me he did not call me an <HI>arminian,</HI> but only taxed me with doctrines tending to <HI>arminianism.</HI> I answered, I cared not for the name: whether he charged me with <HI>arminianism</HI> or not, he certainly charged me with <HI>dangerous and destructive doctrines, such as rendred me unfit to preach,</HI> and read part of his let∣ter to prove it. This he answered with a shrug.—Another thing discoursed of was, about his asserting before the council at <HI>Middleborough,</HI> when he found he could not support the charges in his letter from any thing contained in my 3d Essay, which was read there, "that his letter was found∣ed more on what I <HI>said</HI> at the church-meeting than on <HI>what I read,</HI> and that I said a great deal, turning myself round, and swinging my hands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" And that he stood to it (before the ministers) in opposi∣tion
<PB N="125" REF="012739_0122_0F8BEA56E58EE9F8"/>to the declaration of three of the brethren, then present, when in reality I had <HI>said nothing</HI> dur∣ing the whole meeting, relative to the point in con∣troversy. His answer to this was a mere <HI>evasion,</HI> namely, "that he did not know but that while I was reading, I might put in something here and there memoriter:" though he did not pretend to recollect any thing omitted in the manuscript. This falsity then, was by no means cleared up. An∣other thing I mention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d was, his reporting about, that I never preached for him <HI>without pay.</HI> He deni∣ed he had ever so reported, and owned that the re∣port was groundless, I having preached several times without, to his knowlege. During this discourse, he would frequently call me to order, and to an ob∣servance of the preliminaries, and finally refused to go any further into particulars. And as to <HI>generals,</HI> he never so much as offered to acknowlege that his letters were <HI>hasty</HI> and <HI>severe,</HI> or <HI>rash</HI> and <HI>unguarded,</HI> or expressed any <HI>sorrow</HI> or <HI>concern</HI> for the writing of them. If he had gone so far as that, I would have acquiesced, rather than have continued in a broil. Nay, he was so far from it, that in 3 hours con∣versation, he did not so much as hint that he tho't himself <HI>wrong in the letters,</HI> either for <HI>matter</HI> or <HI>manner,</HI> either in <HI>general</HI> or <HI>particular,</HI> either in <HI>part</HI> or in <HI>whole:</HI> but appeared to justify the letters, and every thing relating to them, from beginning to end, as he does now in his book.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The brother in his narrative says, <Q>I do not believe one of the brethren will say, they heard him speak one word in the whole of their confer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing together, as if he thought he did the least amiss in what he had charged Mr. <HI>C.</HI> with in his letters. Upon the strictest recollection I cannot remember one word from Mr. <HI>R.</HI> that looked that way. It appeared to me, that Mr. <HI>R.</HI> designed to have it said, or to have it to say himself, that he never did say any thing of this kind, <HI>i. e.</HI> that he was wrong in writing as he did to Mr. <HI>C.</HI></Q></NOTE> How then could I make up? Alas! I was forced to come away with a sorrowful heart. And thus ended the meeting.</P>

The account he has given of the affair is full of gross errors, tending to mislead the reader greatly. 1st. He says, "a number of the brethren met at his house, in order to confer, and endeavor to heal the breach." <HI>p.</HI> 71. The brethren did not meet to <HI>confer</HI> and <HI>use endeavors,</HI> but to set as <HI>mum-chances</HI> to hear us jaw, and contradict. If a free conference had been allowed, it is likely something might have been brought to pass. But this was strictly forbid, though two of the brethren on his side spoke several times, without controul, either from him or me; but when one that went with me once attempted to speak, his mouth was stopped immediately before he could bring out one sen∣tence. (<HI>"You are not to speak one word,"</HI> says Mr. <HI>R.</HI> to him) The end of my having <HI>brethren</HI> with me was in pursuance of Christ's rule, <HI>Matt.</HI> xviii. 16. and I suppose their business was, to interpose when either party carried matters too high, and to me∣diate and propose terms of accommodation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the door was effectually barred against this. My end also in this meeting was pursuant to the same rule. <HI>Matt.</HI> xviii. <HI>to tell him his fault,</HI> i. e. the particulars I was offended at. But neither was this suffered: and the reason he gives is, <HI>because it would not make for peace.</HI> Who ever heard of such a reason before, why a man must not be told of his <HI>faults</HI> by a brother offended? but this by the way. 2d. He attempts to make the world believe, that he made me some <HI>confession,</HI> or at least offered to do it <HI>conditionally.</HI> The brethren that went with me, say, he made me no confession at all, but rather <HI>insulted</HI> me. But what does he confess? the book says, <Q>be∣ing sensible that it has been a day of <HI>temptation</HI> and <HI>controversy</HI> among us, we had both, no doubt, said and done many things which are wrong, and which at another time we should not have done.</Q> The expression I never heard before, as I can recollect; I dare say none of the brethren present (no nor Mr. <HI>R.</HI> himself) will venture to give their oaths, that these were <HI>the individual words.</HI> But suppose they were, did he design to confess
<PB N="127" REF="012739_0124_0F8BEA5837DA37C0"/>any thing that I wanted him to confess?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I dare put it to his conscience, whether he designed in those words to confess, that he had done me any wrong or in∣jury by the letters. And indeed the words do not import, that he had any sense of his having wronged <HI>me person∣ally</HI> at all. They may refer to <HI>any other wrong step</HI> that he was conscious of, in the management of the contro∣versy, that had no relation to me. Yea, they may mean, that he had <HI>only wronged himself,</HI> and <HI>not others,</HI> by something he had said or done.</NOTE> was it not rather a general expression devised to make the hearers think, that he confessed something, when really he confessed nothing? that this was the case, appeared by the whole of his conversati∣on then, and by his book now. <Q>My first letter, says he, contained my real sentiments upon his conduct and principles; and I have never yet met with any just cause to <HI>alter</HI> my sentiments.</Q> <HI>p</HI> 61. How then can he fault me for not accepting his confession? he tells us, that he meant <HI>nothing</HI> by it; and yet I am blame-worthy in his and the brethren's opinion, for not taking up with it. How unreasonable is this? and besides, was I not to have <HI>joined with him</HI> in the confession? was not the acknowlegement to be <HI>mutual?</HI> the same terms he used, was I not to have used? and how could I do it without a consciousness of guilt? if I had been guilty, why did he not tell me wherein? why would he not come to particulars, and point out my faults? I stood ready to <HI>hear</HI> him, and upon <HI>convicti∣on,</HI> would as readily have acknowleged. But as things then appeared to me, how could I do it? and I would observe further, that if he was <HI>consci∣ous</HI> he had <HI>wronged</HI> me, he ought to have confessed whether I did or no; and if he <HI>was not</HI> conscious of it; how comes he to offer any thing that looked like confession? in short, this whole affair of con∣fession<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I would observe here, that Mr. <HI>R.</HI> carefully avoids the term <HI>confession,</HI> in all his account of the affair; he <HI>scorned</HI> to have it thought, that he had made me any con∣fession at all. Some months before the term of <HI>general amnesty</HI> seems much more agreable to his idea of the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut how could he content himself with that, if he really thought at the time, that I had injured him so much as he now represents to the world? perhaps he would have it pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as an instance of his great "conde∣scention, and meekness and love of peace."</NOTE> appears to me to be a <HI>mere farce, a designed im∣position</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="012739_0125_0F8BEA590767BC98"/>upon me and others. If I had accepted the terms, how would he and his party have laughed in their sleeves? telling all about, "that Mr. <HI>R.</HI> had confessed nothing: that after making a great stir, I had given up all for a song; that being con∣scious of my own guilt, I durst not prosecute the affair any further, but was glad to come off so, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" And he would have gone on justifying his letters and conduct to the end of time. 3. He says, "the major part of the brethren thought the satisfaction he offered, reasonable and sufficient, and that they should desire no more, had they been the offended." <HI>p.</HI> 71. But how could they know <HI>that,</HI> without they heard the <HI>particulars</HI> I had against him? will they fall under the condemnation of <HI>judging a matter before they hear it?</HI> "but they knew the particulars." No, they did not know all. And as for those they knew, how could they tell but that they would have ap∣peared to them in quite a different light, if I had had liberty to have spoken to them particularly?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am satisfied that some of these brethren had not then heard the whole of the three letters. Or if they had, how could they pass a proper judgment of them, upon hearing them <HI>once transiently?</HI> his first letter appeared to me ten times worse in the after deliberate perusal, than it did at first; and so it might to them, if they had heard it de∣liberately a second time, and the particulars of it closely canvassed.</NOTE> They had previously heard Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s explanation and defence, but not mine. Whether they ever declared to Mr. <HI>R.</HI> that they thought the satisfac∣tion sufficient or no, I cannot tell. I am sure they never told me so, either at the meeting or since. By the way, he would not have been able to say, that the <HI>major part</HI> of the brethren gave their voice in favor of his proposals, if he had not broke the
<PB N="129" REF="012739_0126_0F8BEA59B7CD9560"/>agreement, and invited one more to the meeting than I. Two of which number were as great sticklers in the affair as himself, and <HI>I</HI> would <HI>rather</HI> have left the whole matter to him alone, than to them. And the 3d in the number was wholly under his influence. And the 4th (who had ne∣ver heard my account of the matter) seemed, by what he said at the meeting, to go upon this prin∣ciple, "that as no body thought the <HI>worse</HI> of me for his letter, it would be best to pass it lightly by:" being a man of peace, he would have been glad of peace at any rate. Upon the whole here, let me observe, both with respect them and others, that if they are among thóse who <HI>justify the letters,</HI> it is no wonder they think the satisfaction suffici∣ent, for in that case no satisfaction was due; but confession ought to come from me, as having charged him unjustly, and withdrawn from his communion without grounds.</P>
<P>Again, he says, "ministers as well as brethren advised to such a general making up as he propos∣ed." He means the ministers of <HI>Middleborough</HI> coun∣cil: I have asked 3 of them, and they tell me they never gave such advice. That there was indeed a transient expression of one of the ministers pre∣sent about burning the letters, and so finishing the controversy—and that was all.</P>
<P>Finally, he says, "that I pulled out 3 or 4 <HI>confessi∣ons</HI> for him to make." <HI>p.</HI> 72. This conveys a wrong idea. I made a few <HI>memorandums</HI> in short hand on the back of his letter, running in these terms. 1st. As to the charge of <HI>insincerity and deceit.</HI> Mr. <HI>R.</HI> says in his last letter, "that it was far from his intenti∣on." I expect he will add further, that he disavows all such expressions as look that way, or carry such an implication in them, in the apprehension of any. 2d. As to the charge of <HI>arminianism,</HI> I expect he say thus much at least, that he did this without suffi∣cient grounds, and that it arose from mistaken ap∣prehensions of what I read. 3d. That the expressi∣ons were uncharitable and improper, wherein he asserts "that the <HI>most godly</HI> among us, were all on his side of the question." There were 2, or 3,
<PB N="130" REF="012739_0127_0F8BEA5F24B0F1C0"/>other articles set down, that did not relate to the letters. But these were all I read to him. And I thought it impossible to propose more moderate terms. But he would scarce give me the hearing, and rejected the whole with disdain. As for my refusing to answer a question. <HI>p.</HI> 72. I think I was quite right in it, unless he would go into particu∣lars, and tell me wherein I had offended. Thus the meeting terminated. And by this account, which is just, does it appear, that he was any ways disposed to peace? The brother, mentioned in his narrative, says, "I am much surprized Mr. <HI>R.</HI> should say <HI>"he endeavored a reconciliation in the presence of a number of the brethren."</HI> It appeared to me, and so it did to others present, <Q>that there appeared no disposition in Mr. <HI>R.</HI> to take one proper or christian step for a reconciliation; for no per∣son could be more deaf to any proposals made by another, and more fixedly to appearance set∣tled in the matter not to hear any thing Mr. <HI>C.</HI> offered, and <HI>often</HI> spake of his own proposal, as if it was going further than was needful, but that he did it for peace sake, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" Again, he says, there appeared to me from the beginning to the end of their conference, that there was no dis∣position in Mr. <HI>R.</HI> to make up the matter in any shape, unless he could lay Mr. <HI>C.</HI> under such a <HI>disadvantage</HI> as no <HI>christian</HI> ought to <HI>consent</HI> to.</Q> He says further, "that captain <HI>C.</HI> deacon <HI>T.</HI> and I (the three brethren present) have divers times since said to one another, that it appeared to us, that Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s treatment of Mr. <HI>C.</HI> at that time was rather an <HI>insulting</HI> of him, than shewing any <HI>real desire</HI> of settling the affair in a friendly and christian man∣ner." And since that time what hath he done towards reconciliation? he indeed goes about every where crying, "how much he is for peace; that he longs to have the matter settled, that he is will∣ing to do any thing," <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By this means his hearers are induced to think, that he is all made up of <HI>love</HI> and <HI>peace:</HI> but let any one touch upon <HI>particulars,</HI> he will justify <HI>all</HI> as much as ever, and misrepresentation abound more and more.</NOTE> And yet what <HI>one step</HI>
<PB N="131" REF="012739_0128_0F8BEA61686ED868"/>hath he taken towards it? I was indeed a little in hopes, that he would have laid some foundation for a reconciliation in his book, or made some con∣cession, after so long time of deliberation: but in stead of that, he aggravates matters to the utmost, and hath widened the breach ten-fold more than ever. Which gives a specimen of what he would have done at this meeting, if we had come to par∣ticulars. Who then can blame me for not accept∣ing his proposal, or agreeing to his offer of a <HI>gene∣ral oblivion?</HI> which is the utmost that can be said of it, and really all he intended.</P>
<P>I come now to the article of his "giving me the lye in the face of the church." <HI>p.</HI> 73. I had disa∣vowed in the most solemn terms any <HI>direct design</HI> of getting him away, and declared that our oppositi∣on proceeded <HI>solely</HI> from consciencious motives. He presently starts up, and tells the church in effect, that he did not believe one word I said, but that "he was now <HI>confirmed</HI> in it, our whole design was to get him away." But what were the grounds of his disbelief? or what gave him confirmation? he tells us, "it was a matter much talked of, in the town." I dare say, it was never talked of, till he and his <HI>two</HI> emissaries infused it into people. Not so, says he, "I suppose they formed their opinion from the whole tenor of his conduct towards me of late." I challenge him and his whole <HI>posse</HI> to allege <HI>one speech</HI> or <HI>overt-act</HI> tending that way, (except my public writings have that tendency.) But what, though it appeared so evident to the whole parish, that I had a design of getting him away; yet he seems still to hesitate and doubt about it: how comes he at length "to be better satisfied, that the reports were true?" why, by the <HI>matter</HI> and the <HI>extraordinary manner,</HI> in which my last piece was delivered?" this gave full proof and "confirmati∣on," whatever I could say to the contrary. But why does he put in the <HI>manner,</HI> except it be to im∣pose upon the public? what could there be <HI>extra∣ordinary</HI> in that? if it was delivered with "un∣christian heat," as he intimates, <HI>p.</HI> 75. had that a tendency to get him away? should I not defeat
<PB N="132" REF="012739_0129_0F8BEA6253CC92B0"/>my own end by taking such a method? in truth I had such a bad cold and cough at that time, and for above 3 months before, that I believe I deli∣vered myself in a <HI>very ordinary manner,</HI> and not with much <HI>pathos.</HI> As for the <HI>matter,</HI> that appears from the print, to be worse than it was, the church appeared to be in such <HI>extraordinary agitation</HI> upon the account of a paper clandestinely signed, and brought in (of which more presently) that I tho't I would not aggravate matters. And accordingly in reading my Essay, I omitted that paragraph about <HI>infant's being sprinkled,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>p.</HI> 62. And also the whole of the 10th and 11th heads, <HI>p.</HI> 70. and the whole of the conclusion about his expedient, <HI>p.</HI> 73. which seemed to have a <HI>personal</HI> reference; and Mr. <HI>R.</HI> never saw or heard them, till they appear∣ed in print.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was likewise another article omitted both in the read∣ing and in the <HI>printing</HI> too (least I should load him too much, and which unless remedied, there will be no peace, to this church;) and that relates to a record he made (after the 2 or 3 first meetings) which he calls <HI>stating the arguments on both sides,</HI>" and which was made of his own mere motion without the knowledge and consent of the church. It is among the proposals to∣wards the latter end of my last Essay, and runs in those terms. "3d. I would propose, that the church record relating to this point may be erased or amended. It is the duty of a <HI>clerk</HI> to record the transactions of the society he belongs to, and not his own fancies and opinions. If the clerk of the general court, or of a town, should take liberty of stating cases, reciting arguments, and giving prefer∣ence to which side he pleases, and making it part of the public records, without the knowlege of his constituents; how would it be resented? but if a clerk should go fur∣ther still, and draw up such a state of the case, as evident∣ly condemned the court or town, and brought a <HI>slur</HI> upon their <HI>former practices</HI> (upon their own records) what a <HI>stigma</HI> would he bring upon himself? it is certain, that the account set down on the church records does not contain a full and compleat state of the arguments on both sides; some of the arguments are wholly omitted, others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and some things are added, which I never heard at any church-meeting.

Or if this will not pass, I move that a committee be chosen to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such addition to the church-records, as may leave a fair state of the case to <HI>posterity;</HI> who will have <HI>strange ideas</HI> of the <HI>present generation,</HI> if it should stand as it now does."</NOTE> So that there was scarce any thing
<PB N="133" REF="012739_0130_0F8BEA62B702E6A8"/>except <HI>general matter</HI> left. And how could he from that infer, that I had a design of getting him away; yea, and be absolutely confirmed in it too? but still says he, "actions speak louder than words;" and from them it was evident, that I had such a design. But what were these actions? why a series of wrongs, or "injurious treatment frequently given." <HI>p.</HI> 72. I had said and done things (to his prejudice) which he could not have thought possible before," they were so very bad. <HI>p.</HI> 70. "By all that ap∣peared of late, it was evident I had LONG some <HI>root of prejudice</HI> against him; and that nothing was wanting but opportunity, for it to manifest itself. But that now opportunity being given by this con∣troversy, I had used it to purpose." <HI>p.</HI> 71. And that all the while "my conscience was so <HI>perfectly</HI> CALLOUS and <HI>insensible,</HI> that I would not own I had wronged him at all." <HI>p.</HI> 59. And to the like pur∣pose in several other places.</P>
<P>Thus hath he cloathed me "in a garb of his own manufacture, terrible eno'l acknowledge," and much like the dress of victims devoted to destruction by the <HI>Spanish</HI> inquisition, all painted with devils; yea, and exactly in the same strain and language of a late printed advertisement. But to strip myself of this awful garb, let me observe a few things. 1st. That at the time of this meeting, our division was comprized in a narrow compass. It was in a manner, all contained in the letters that passed be∣tween us: he did not so much as hint, that he had any thing further against me at the meeting with
<PB N="134" REF="012739_0131_0F8BEA639ABD8CF0"/>the brethren, that followed soon after; no, nor at any other time hath he intimated to me, that he took offence at any thing else. But now it seems there was a series of other injuries. How unjust and unchristian are such representations? as for my letter, the world hath that before them; and they may judge, as well as we, whether it gave founda∣tion for all this outcry. 2d. The suggestion is utter∣ly groundless, "that nothing but <HI>opportunity</HI> was wanting for me to revenge myself, or to manifest the <HI>rooted prejudice</HI> or grudge I had long bore him." For never man gave more <HI>opportunities,</HI> if I had been disposed to embrace them. His <HI>imprudent management</HI> was such from year to year, that the parish was frequently in a flame about it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At some of these times, I myself heard one of his present <HI>prime pillars</HI> allege in his excuse, "that we must con∣sider that he was but <HI>a child;</HI> and that when he had more years over his head, he would behave with more pru∣dence and caution."</NOTE> But how did I behave at such times? why, instead of taking the opportunity, I was either silent, or endeavored to smooth over his conduct. And even when it was proposed to print my first Essay, I declined it chief∣ly on this ground, lest it should bring on a <HI>personal contest</HI> between me and Mr. <HI>R.</HI> And previous to this, when I have been blamed for not preaching in his absence, or for being so loth to preach, I have rather bore the blame than tell my reasons pub∣licly, lest it should hurt him. And when he sent the provoking letters to the precinct committee about his salary, I, with the rest, endeavored to stifle and suppress them, because I knew how much the precinct would resent it, if they were commu∣nicated (as he designed they should be) though for this, many much blamed us. Yea, under all the flights and neglects, or ill-treatment in general, I received from him in former years,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Perhaps he will here retort, that this is only a <HI>general charge,</HI> and utterly deny any such treatment. To pre∣vent which, let me subjoin one instance among many. When he knew, that <HI>3</HI> quarters of the parish or more would gladly hear me preach, and (being about to take a journey to <HI>Connecticut</HI>) was earnestly urged by some of the principal men to invite me to supply the pulpit, and told, that it should not cost him a farthing; he rather than do it, chose to ride above <HI>40</HI> miles to get a young preacher, who when he came no body liked, and I was forced at last to preach part of the time, at the invitation of the deacons and precinct committee. And (strange to tell) though I preached so frequently▪ he never once heard me till the time of his <HI>great concern</HI> about <HI>4</HI> or <HI>5</HI> years ago, altho' he hath been in the town ever since the year <HI>1759.</HI> He in∣deed never went so far as (he has now) to forbid my preach∣ing; he knew that would not bear; however he discouraged it as far as he durst, all the while declaring to some that were then closely attached to me, "how he <HI>longed</HI> to hear me preach and what a value he had for me, &amp;c." but to others he talked otherways; and to justify himself, told about town, "that the <HI>association</HI> advised him not to ask me to preach; which I cannot think true, most of them freely and repeatedly asking me into their own pulpits. Nay, to such a height did he carry his dislike, that when once he was obliged by his people to invite me to preach upon his being suddenly taken ill, his <HI>wife</HI> went to the other meet∣ing, though there was no ministerial communion between him and the other minister. This could not proceed from any distaste to my manner of preaching for she had never heard me. Many other slights there were, besides those on the article of preaching. Let me particularly mention one; when I was chosen <HI>town-clerk</HI> anno 1766, he was pleased to say after the meeting, in a large and promiscuous company, respect∣ing me and my competitor; "he wondered that they should chose Mr. <HI>C.</HI> Mr. <HI>S—r</HI> would have made a charm∣ing clerk." Here observe, a <HI>meddling</HI> with town and precinct affairs; which I and others have had ten-fold more <HI>experience</HI> of the last <HI>March.</HI></NOTE> I bore it with
<PB N="135" REF="012739_0132_0F8BEA6439694BD0"/>patience, and would not so much as hint any thing to his disadvantage. Here, by the way, I cannot help observing, that if he had not been <HI>conscious</HI> of ill-treating me in former years, he would not have <HI>suspected</HI> I bore him an old grudge. I should sure∣ly have been one of the <HI>worst</HI> of mortals to bear re∣sentment against any one that never injured me,
<PB N="136" REF="012739_0133_0F8BEA6561A25230"/>but had always treated me with kindness and res∣pect. I would observe further, that after the church-meetings upon this affair had been discon∣tinued for about a 12 month, I had no hand in their revival; I knew nothing of the 3 deacon's making the motion, till after it was done; I was not consult∣ed upon it; if I had been, I should have advised against it: so far was I from pushing it on, to get him away. It struck me with consternation when I first heard of it, as partly seeing the event. I knew Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s natural disposition, that he would be <HI>strengthened by opposition,</HI> at least from such <HI>minute beings</HI> as he apprehended us to be; whereas by longer forbearance he might fall off from his new notions of his own accord, his native sickleness and insta∣bility giving some ground of hope. I could see no other consequence resulting from a new meeting, but that Mr. <HI>R.</HI> must leave us, or the church give up the practice to gratify him: to prevent <HI>either,</HI> I set myself to study for some expedient, in which both might agree, and at length thought of <HI>a neigh∣bouring minister</HI>'s <HI>coming;</HI> which I accordingly propos∣ed: how Mr. <HI>R.</HI> received it, the world hath heard. And even after he had given <HI>me offence</HI> by his letters, I made another proposal (Essays. <HI>p.</HI> 73.) even giving up the point of <HI>qualifications.</HI> But it was not taken the <HI>least</HI> notice of. This was the case. And yet now one of these very persons, that petitioned for the meetings being revived, and was as earnest in it as the rest, <HI>joins</HI> in the cry of a design of driving Mr. <HI>R.</HI> off, when I did all I could to prevent it; which I think very hard: when he had laid me under a <HI>necessity</HI> of going on with my defence (I could do no other, when the meetings were once revived). That yet he should tax me for it, and impute it to <HI>bad designs,</HI> even without once discoursing with me upon the affair: Is this <HI>brotherly</HI> or <HI>christian!</HI> Alas! how far will affection sometimes lead good men! To sum up all in a word, if such prejudice subsisted in my breast, as Mr. <HI>R.</HI> here suggests, if I retained an old grudge against him, is it possible it should lye dormant? could I help manifesting it some way or other, in such a long course of years? and I appeal
<PB N="137" REF="012739_0134_0F8BEA65D7FF5750"/>to the whole parish, whether by word or action, I have tried to hurt him. But to pass on, 3d. His charges, the reader will naturally observe, are all of a general nature, except the letter in 1764, no∣thing particular; much like the charges of <HI>Ter∣tullus</HI> against <HI>Paul. Act.</HI> xxiv. 5. And how easy is it to asperse the best man alive in this manner? and who could escape? if I was guilty of such acts of injury, and that so frequently, why are they not particu∣larized? why does he not tell the world what they are? I challenge him to do it; I demand it of him, as a man, as a christian, as a minister, that he bring them forth: I will turn the whole cause upon it, if he can produce so much as one, except he raises up false witnesses against me, or except he accuses me <HI>in the matter of my God,</HI> i. e. for my de∣fence of what I think a truth, an important truth of Christ. And must I leave this undefended? must I give it up, for fear of getting him away? let me be first cast to <HI>the lions. Dan.</HI> vi. It is true, in the present situation of things, no body can imagine that I should <HI>much grieve</HI> if he was gone, without there appeared a great change in him. But as for saying or doing any thing previous to or at the church-meeting, with design to get him away, I utterly disavow it. And even <HI>since</HI> the church-meet∣ing, I have taken no measures or steps for such a purpose; but have been much upon the reserve, saying or doing nothing, except by way of self-de∣fence; which I think is my bounden duty, and none can justly blame me for it. And so far am I from being <HI>implacable</HI> and <HI>unforgiving,</HI> that if there appear∣ed any <HI>hearty concern</HI> in him for his mis-management, and the injuries he hath done me, or if he was in the same temper and disposition he was about four years ago, I could freely pass by all, and receive him as cordially as ever. But till this appears, <HI>christianity itself</HI> does not oblige me to <HI>forgive,</HI> except so far as not to bear him <HI>ill-will,</HI> but to wish and pray for his spiritual welfare, that his eyes may be open∣ed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here for a <HI>coronis</HI> on this head, I hope it will be a warning to the reader, in case he should
<PB N="138" REF="012739_0135_0F8BEA6D50C2F460"/>return an answer to this book, not to give heed to <HI>general charges</HI> and <HI>accusations.</HI> If this subterfuge should fail him, I know he would have very little left. I hope also, it will be a warning to his <HI>parishi∣oners,</HI> not to regard such general outcry "of <HI>injury, abuse and persecution,</HI>" which I expect will be more abundant than ever, and that he <HI>will ride all over the town</HI> for that purpose. To show any regard to them, would manifest to the world, that they are more swayed by <HI>affection</HI> than by <HI>judgment,</HI> and that the <HI>prejudice</HI> lays wholly on their side and not on mine; and that <HI>the grieving the good Mr.</HI> R. (as the phrase is) lyes nearer their hearts, than <HI>justice, truth</HI> and <HI>the spiri∣tual good</HI> of their own dear offspring,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some there are, that declare, "they are in my sentiments, and that they think the practice right;" yet will give it up, for fear of grieving or offending Mr. <HI>R.</HI> which shows, that they are <HI>man-pleasers;</HI> and that they prefer <HI>peace</HI> to <HI>truth;</HI> and that present ease is better in their esteem than the spiritual advantage of their children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> which I think closely connected with this controversy. Which God forbid.</P>
<P>Well, Mr. <HI>R.</HI> having cleared himself from the heinous charge of <HI>giving me the lye,</HI> he next proceeds to retort the charge. It seems "I gave him the lye too, in the face of the church." After much study, he hath hammered out something, that he thought would carry such an appearance. <HI>p.</HI> 74. But as it happens it wants <HI>truth</HI> to support it in every part. First he says, "he told me and the church <HI>publicly,</HI> that some churches had practiced agreable to his expedient, both in this province and <HI>connecticut,</HI> one in the former, and another in the latter, both of which he named." It makes me sick to hear so much of things said in public, which were never said, (I believe I could mention near a score of instances, which were only the fruit of after study). This expedient of his, was never proposed in a <HI>formal manner</HI> in public; but only to the members <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>everally in a <HI>private</HI> way in their own houses or as he had opportunity; thus he proposed it to me at my own home. But finding
<PB N="139" REF="012739_0136_0F8BEA6E673F0710"/>it would not bear, I suppose upon this account he forebore offering it in public. For which reason when my 2d. Essay was read at the meeting pre∣ceeding the last (which was done by one of the deacons, as I have noted, upon the account of my indisposition) I stood up, when he came to my ob∣servations about the expedient, and said, "that inasmuch as the proposal had never been made to the church at any of our public meetings, I tho't it best he should omit reading that part, and that it was time enough to read it when the proposal was brought into public:" it was omitted accord∣ingly (<HI>viz.</HI> from <HI>p.</HI> 21 to 26. of the Essays,) and the church never heard it at all.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>R.</HI> was in too great ferment, to make such a deliberate proposal in our last meeting. However, I recollect, that when one of the deacons then expressed his wishes, that he would come into our expedient of a neighbouring minister's coming, he turned it off slightly, and said, he thought we might as well come into his expedient: and so the matter went off, without being particularly urged and enforced. To be sure, there was no particular mention of other churches in the practice, as I, or others of good memories, can possibly recollect. However, if there had been, this does not prove <HI>I gave him the lye:</HI> for I did not thwart or contradict him at that time in the face of the church; nei∣ther saying or reading any thing relating to the expedient.</NOTE> And as for what he puts in contrast to this, and which makes the <HI>lye,</HI> namely, my saying, "no church in the province practices any thing like it, and that we could not tell whether the report about the <HI>Connecticut</HI> church was true or no." (<HI>p.</HI> 73. Essays.) This was not read at the church-meeting, as I have observed before; no, neither was it so much as wrote; I adding that part, when I transcribed the Essays for the press, upon hearing that after the dissolution of the meeting, he still urged the members to come into the expedient. So that <HI>his assertion</HI> and my <HI>denial</HI> in the face of the church publicly, must both fall to the ground; there never was any such thing on either side. And as for his telling me of it in pri∣vate at my own house, I am certain he never did;
<PB N="140" REF="012739_0137_0F8BEA6ED519DB00"/>we talking only of the propriety of the expedient. I had the account of the practice of the <HI>Connecticut</HI> church from another quarter. And as for the church in this province that is in the practice, I know not what he means; I cannot so much as guess even now what church he refers to. I have heard since my Essays were in the press, that this expedi∣ent was in common use among the <HI>Connecticut</HI> church∣es in Dr. <HI>B</HI>'s scheme. Why did he not tell us of this! had he a mind to appear among us as one of the prime leaders in this new device? and so be hand∣ed down to posterity on the list of fame?</P>
<P>I pass over the rest of his 74th <HI>p.</HI> though it justly deserves castigation. And proceed to his account of the last church-meeting, <HI>p.</HI> 75. with which he finishes his book. I had prepared a particular ac∣count of this meeting to be added to my Essays: but fearing to bring discredit on the church (which was my <HI>alma mater</HI>) I erased it; and only concluded with a general and short relation, which I thought impossible any should be offended at. But it seems Mr. <HI>R.</HI> hath taken great offence. And by his ran∣dom and imprudent manner of writing about it, hath necessitated me to be particular in the affair, which I am really sorry for. He says, "I represent him, as <HI>unsatisfied</HI> with the dissolution of the meet∣ing" I never gave any such representation, as I have noted before; it was what he wanted. He tells us "the church were not willing to hear me any more, having seen the sad effects of my Essays in former meetings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> What an idea does this carry with it, as if I had <HI>forced</HI> my Essays upon the church in former meetings, (so that they were wearied out with them) and urged the matter even to nauseousness? when in fact the church appeared always desirous to hear me till now, and many act∣ually put me on to speak. The more their ingrati∣tude, that they now give me up a <HI>victim</HI> to Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s resentment! they cannot but know, that <HI>I am suf∣fering for pleading their cause and the cause of their children:</HI> and why will they not see me <HI>righted?</HI> how cruel and unbrotherly to leave me thus in the lurch? But why were they not willing to hear me now?
<PB N="141" REF="012739_0138_0F8BEA6F76392638"/>because Mr. <HI>R.</HI> and his seconds had told them, "that it was not <HI>conscience,</HI> but <HI>revenge</HI> that influenced us, and that our only motive was to drive him off:" and they had previously determined to bar any further process, and to dissolve the meeting at all events. But what were the <HI>sad effects</HI> of my Essays formerly? why, it prevented his gaining his ends, and getting the practice cast out, and he had <HI>un∣justly picked a quarrel</HI> with me for it. He could not brook opposition. "I could not have believed it possible, says he, some years ago." <HI>p.</HI> 70. <HI>Believed what?</HI> why, that I should be so presumptuous as to rise in rebellion, and dare to defend a practice, that he had stigmatized. This was the whole that he could object against me. He tells us further, "that there was more warmth and unchristian heat in this than in any of our meetings before, and that we <HI>had all reason to be ashamed of it.</HI>" It is well he <HI>takes himself in;</HI> it is the <HI>first time</HI> he hath done it throughout his whole book. But what was "the occasion of this heat?" why, "our opposition to the dissolution of the meeting." Here he <HI>skulks</HI> out again, and lays all the blame on us. But was this fact? no; it was not the dissolving the meeting (this we would have consented to on proper terms) but <HI>the paper</HI> that he immediately mentions, which caused all this heat and warmth. A paper had been drawn up (not "a day or two," as he says, but) several days before the meeting, and put into the hands of a <HI>proper instrument,</HI> who, carrying it about, <HI>ployed his game</HI> so well, as to get near half the church to sign. But "this they did willingly, says Mr. <HI>R.</HI> and not by constraint or <HI>persuasion.</HI>" How could this be, when he went to one member no less than 3 times, <HI>persuading</HI> him to sign, but he finally refused? and was not the utmost art, or rather artifice, used with the rest? did he not tell the members applied to, "that this was the only way to keep Mr. <HI>R?</HI> that there was a plan laid to get him away? that this was all we had in view in our opposition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" or such like suggestions. And was it not such considerations as these, that in∣duced them to sign? I appeal to the members sign∣ing, whether this was not the case. This paper
<PB N="142" REF="012739_0139_0F8BEA71C314F890"/>was kept a profound secret, till the opening of the church-meeting, and then was presented: Mr. <HI>R.</HI> was in a great hurry to read it, and stopped one of the deacons for that end who was beginning upon the merits of the cause. But previous to the read∣ing of it, he told us. "he had no hand or concern in it."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some folks had need have good memories. For some time after, in the course of the debate, he said in <HI>his haste, "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> (including himself) expunged some passages out of the paper, which <HI>WE</HI> thought would give offence." So that he had the <HI>correcting,</HI> if not the first <HI>draughting</HI> the paper: and yet it seems by his first declaration, he had <HI>no concern</HI> in it at all. It was a mere free will offering of others, to which he was an intire stranger.</NOTE> And then read as follows.</P>
<P>"WE the subscribers, brethren of the first church of Christ in <HI>Plymouth,</HI> taking into serious considera∣tion the unhappy difference subsisting in the said church, relative to the subjects of baptism, and be∣ing of opinion that the most effectual method to restore peace and harmony to the said church, would be to drop the affair for the present. We would therefore hereby signify our earnest desire, that the church-meeting, which stands adjourned to Tuesday the 30th instant <HI>June,</HI> be dissolved, without entring into <HI>further debate</HI> on the affair: the church to re-assume the further consideration thereof when they shall think proper. In the mean time to leave the CONDUCT of the affair un∣der consideration to the WISDOM and PRUDENCE of our pastor. May the great head of the church lead and guide us in this and in all our other af∣fairs, so as shall tend most for his glory and our good, and at last bring us to that blessed state, where love, peace and unity reign in perfection."</P>

<P>The reading of this paper put us all in confusi∣on; and such a ferment followed, as I never saw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n any public assembly before.

And the MAT∣TER of it was equally offensive: that Mr. <HI>R.</HI> was to be cloathed with sovereign authority; that it was to be lest to him to do or forbear at his pleasure, and to be accountable to none: in short, that the whole power of the church relating to this affair was to be wholly deposited in his hands; so that the church's constitution became essentially alter∣ed:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Query, supposing Mr. <HI>R.</HI> had <HI>suspended</HI> every one of us who opposed him from communion, whether this paper and the vote that followed upon it, would not have bore him out? or whether the church had not given him suffi∣cient authority for it? if he had power to exclude <HI>bapti∣zed persons,</HI> why not <HI>communicants?</HI> might they not be dealt with alike, the one as <HI>claimers,</HI> the other as <HI>upholders</HI> and <HI>abettors?</HI> equally involved in error?</NOTE> these things, together with the <HI>suddenness</HI> and <HI>unexpectedness</HI> of it, set us all in a flame;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">When I consider my natural temper and disposition, and look black, it is matter of wonderment to me, that I kept my temper as I did at this and other meetings, consider∣ing his numerous provocations.

Supposing one of their body at their meeting, had disputed with Mr. <HI>R.</HI> on the point, and used the same arguments I did (the rest sitting by consenting;) and Mr. <HI>R.</HI> after he got home, had wrote such a letter to his opponent as he did to me, taxing him "with injurious, unchristian, ungentleman-like treatment; charging him with giving false representations of his prin∣ciples, contrary to the light of his own mind, with deceit in managing the controversy, with wresting the scripture to serve the purposes of a party, with dangerous destructive doctrines of an unavoidable <HI>arminian</HI> tendency." <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And withal, "renouncing ministerial communion with him." Whether they <HI>in general</HI> would have <HI>silently</HI> bore it; and whether the party charged <HI>in particular</HI> would have ever sit with him in association again, without a very humble acknowledgment? I should be glad, if they would make the case their own. If I had been of their body now (as I was once) I dare say I should have had ample reparation long ere this, or Mr. <HI>R's</HI> face would never have been seen in the association again. Every one would have rose up in arms in my behalf. And why will they <HI>be silent</HI> now, when they see an <HI>old brother</HI> suf∣fering? especially since the cause is <HI>their own?</HI> for if the charge of dangerous error and <HI>arminianism</HI> be true of me, it is equally so of <HI>most</HI> of them; and I may just∣ly say, <HI>mutato nomine de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e narratur.</HI> I am satis∣fied, if ministers had <HI>fully</HI> spoke their minds from the be∣ginning, Mr. <HI>R.</HI> would have been brought to something before now.

<PB N="144" REF="012739_0141_0F8BEA733A8450F0"/>I was angry to purpose, and it was the only time that I was thoroughly angry at any of our meetings. We protested against the paper;
<PB N="145" REF="012739_0142_0F8BEA73F5830538"/>we desired to be heard upon it, and insisted upon our right to speak: but all in vain. A vote was <HI>hurried on,</HI> (Mr. <HI>R.</HI> the ring-leader in it,) and it passed in the very words of the paper. After the passing of it, the opposite party, who, <HI>all the while ap∣peared to be in as great agitation as we,</HI> became so far <HI>calmed</HI> as to suffer us to speak, before the sentence of dissolution was pronounced, though Mr. <HI>R.</HI> ap∣peared utterly averse to it. We then argued and remonstrated, shewing the <HI>impropriety</HI> of the mea∣sure, and the <HI>bad consequences</HI> that would result from it; and withal claiming it as our right and privi∣lege to deliver our whole minds on the affair, and showing the injustice of stopping our mouths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Mr. <HI>R.</HI> and <HI>M—w</HI> were our chief opposers all the while. But at length (with much difficulty, and after a struggle of 2 or 3 hours) the church re-con∣sidered their vote, and liberty was granted to speak to the merits of the cause. One of the old members saying, "<HI>come let us hear Mr.</HI> C. <HI>perhaps af∣ter all this noise, the mountain will bring forth a mouse</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It seems he could not hear me long with patience; for he kept altering his posture, rising and sitting, shifting seats, walking in the alley, running out of doors, and then returning; and sometimes speaking and objecting, try∣ing to stop me, &amp;c. For which management I gave a <HI>stamp</HI> at him, and kept on reading. This I mention, lest Mr. <HI>R.</HI> (as he never misses an advantage) should make a formidable story of it in his next piece and leave out the provoking circumstances. It was the <HI>only</HI> method where∣in I could well testify my dislike of his behavior; for my breath and strength was nigh spent with speaking and reading (being not well) and then a verbal reproof would have engaged me in a dispute, and diverted and stopt my reading in the midst, which was what he wanted. And besides, we had a <HI>moderator,</HI> that would keep no sort of order; on the contrary, he was most <HI>unorderly</HI> him∣self, and encouraged the like in others, (<HI>his friends,</HI> as he calls them.)</NOTE> I took no notice of the speech, but proceeded to read my last piece, leaving out the parts most of∣fensive.
<PB N="146" REF="012739_0143_0F8BEA74B5DDB410"/>After this, others spoke to the point in controversy, (the meeting not being immediately dissolved, as he asserts, but continuing near an hour after) and pleaded for the continuance of the practice. But not expecting it would have any effect, the brethren with me finally offered to con∣sent to the dissolution of the meeting upon pro∣per terms; which were, that the offensive paper should be wholly laid aside: and, inasmuch as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igners of it had with one voice declared, "that the intent of it was only, that the affair might be dropt for the present, and that things should remain in the same situation they were before we had any church-meetings." That the vote should be drawn up accordingly. But this could not be obtained. Then it was offered further, to join in the vote ac∣cording to the terms used in the paper, provided the latter clause relating to the pastor might be left out. But neither could this be obtained: but the vote finally passed as it stood at first. And then the meeting was dissolved. This was the true state of the case. How unfair is Mr. <HI>R.</HI> then in telling the world, that I (with others) opposed a dissolution of the meeting with vehemence? and that this was the sole cause of all the unchristian heat appearing at that time? the real cause was the <HI>unchristian paper,</HI> that was brought into the meeting. And this had such effects, afterwards, that several withdrew from the communion upon the account, looking upon it that the constitution of the church was intirely changed; and Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> was obliged to have a church-meeting on the affair; which was held on the <HI>sabbath!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>R.</HI> stopped the church after meeting, to get them to make the following declaration (ready prepared to their heads;) namely, "That they did not intend by the offensive clause to make any alteration in the constitution of the church, or invest the pastor with any new power in his office, which he was not possessed of before the vote passed; but that the constitution of the church and the power of the pastor should be considered just in the same point of light as before." And he took <HI>the sabbath</HI> for it, <HI>to prevent any debate on the affair.</HI> However there was some debate, and the church after deliberation were so <HI>wise</HI> (in∣stead of making such a <HI>contradictory declaration</HI>) as to strike at the <HI>root</HI> and to vote an erasure; to the ap∣parent dissatisfiaction of Mr. <HI>R.</HI> and 2 or 3 other zealous sticklers. Here I desire the reader to recall to mind how <HI>his zeal was stirred</HI> at my writing <HI>remarks</HI> on his <HI>prayer</HI> upon <HI>the sabbath;</HI> and how I am taxed with it even <HI>twice.</HI> Lo! here are <HI>church-meetings</HI> (as well as <HI>weddings</HI>) on the SABBATH!</NOTE> In
<PB N="147" REF="012739_0144_0F8BEA75E2B84E40"/>which the church agreed to erase the passage most offensive in their vote; namely, those words, <HI>"in the mean time to leave the conduct of the affair under consideration to the wisdom and prudence of the pastor."</HI> So that Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s absolute power and reign was of short continuance; at lest in word and name, though in reality it remains as much as ever; and perhaps more so.</P>
<P>And thus I have at length arrived to the conclu∣sion of his book; having so much <HI>rubbish</HI> to remove out of the way, I have proceeded the more slowly and gradually; and yet have left unnoticed many articles less material and which did not so imme∣diately affect my reputation, which were as grossly misrepresented as the rest. What I have taken notice of appeared absolutely necessary to me: "they are facts (to use his own words, <HI>p.</HI> 65.) which should never have been made more public by me, had not Mr. <HI>R.</HI> really obliged me to it, to vindi∣cate myself from those <HI>charges</HI> which he has thrown out against me in his <HI>bitter remarks</HI> upon the <HI>Essays;</HI> which have made it <HI>necessary</HI> that I should thus let the world know the <HI>particular (manner,</HI> as well as) <HI>reasons</HI> of my conduct, especially in <HI>publishing his let∣ters,</HI> which he has endeavored to represent to his readers in such terrible colours." And upon the whole would observe, that his <HI>talent</HI> seems to lye in misrepresentation, and in giving the most odious turn to the most innocent actions. And if he would take such liberty in a <HI>public piece,</HI> where I had op∣portunity of seeing and answering for myself; how much more may we suppose, that he gave
<PB N="148" REF="012739_0145_0F8BEA76656889C0"/>himself latitude in his <HI>private visits</HI> (which were so abundant) where I had little opportunity of hearing &amp; knowing what he said? (in fact picking up all the <HI>tittle-tattle</HI> that ever he heard about me from my childhood to this day, which received <HI>new authority as it came from his mouth.</HI>) No wonder then, that he hath wrought people to so high a pitch against me, especially since I am such "<HI>a hermit,</HI> and con∣verse so little with people." (Essays. <HI>p.</HI> 49.) And so have no opportunity of counter-acting his motions.</P>
<P>These things lye as a continued load on my spi∣rits; they wear out my life, depriving me of my natural rest, and rendering we weary of a vain world, where <HI>friends</HI> and <HI>friendship</HI> and every thing are so mutable and uncertain. And what will be the end of them is known only to the wise disposer of all things. To whom I desire to submit in this and all his dispensations, for I suffer JUSTLY from him, though UNJUSTLY from man. But whatever becomes of me, whether I stand or fall; it is sure the gates of hell shall never prevail against his church. His cause will flourish in spite of all op∣position. The great head of the church <HI>will carry the lamb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in his arms,</HI> and be their <HI>defence</HI> in the time of danger. And will let the world see, that <HI>his mark was not set on them in vain.</HI></P>
<P>May God give a happy termination to these things; may peace as well as truth flourish in our days; may we all have the temper of the gospel implanted and cultivated in us; and may this church (the first in <HI>New-England</HI>) be increased with the increasings of God, and may all the members of it be found walking in the ways of truth and peace, to the Redeemer's glory, the good of others, and rejoicing of their own souls in the day of Christ. AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the finishing of this answer, something has occurred, proper to mention, which per∣haps the reader will look upon as a mere tragi-comedy. Mr. <HI>H.</HI> a brother of the church being very uneasy at the present situation of affairs, of his own mere motion went to Mr. <HI>R.</HI> and earnest∣ly urged him to come and converse with me alone, and endeavor to heal the breach between us: this Mr. <HI>R.</HI> utterly refused. Mr. <HI>H.</HI> then proposed, that we should have another conference with some of the brethren present, to see if nothing could be done. This Mr. <HI>R.</HI> conceded to, and gave him leave to propose it to me; withal signi∣fying, that he was sensible he had been to blame in the affair. The proposition being made to me, after due consideration, I wrote as follows.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>Written to prevent mistakes, and as a help to the memory.</P>
<P>Whereas it has been proposed, that Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> and I should have another meeting, with a num∣ber of the brethren present, in order to adjust the difference between us; and Mr. <HI>Ribbins</HI> having consented: being sincerely desirous of peace upon proper grounds I also signify my consent thereto upon these terms. 1st. That previous to said meet∣ing, Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> signify his <HI>readiness</HI> to acknowledge, <HI>that he hath greatly wronged and injured me by his letters both as to matter and manner.</HI> And that this is a point, that shall not so much as be brought into debate at such meeting. 2d. That as to all other matters of complaint or grievance on either side, the particu∣lars
<PB N="150" REF="012739_0147_0F909095903CB530"/>be freely discussed and opened at said meeting, and an accommodation endeavored. 3d. That there shall be an equal number, of brethren chosen on both sides, and that their mouths shall not be stop∣ped, as at the former meeting; but that they shall have free liberty to speak, and mediate and inter∣pose as they shall see occasion. 4th. That if an accomodation be effected the terms shall be reduc∣ed to writing, and signed by both parties. 5th. That in order the more effectually to bring about an accommodation, whether it would not be pro∣per and advisable to have 2 or 3 neighboring mi∣nisters present? unless these terms be agreed to, I am confident it would be to little purpose to con∣fer in any shape. But if Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> concedes to them, I stand ready to meet him at any place that he shall propose, although I do not think myself obliged by the laws of christianity to take any fur∣ther <HI>private steps,</HI> but the affair seems ripe for a public cognizance. But for the sake of peace, I am ready to fall in with any thing that is lawful and reasonable, and that has a tendency to put an end to this uncomfortable affair.—</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This I wrote to prevent wrong accounts of the affair, (well knowing the <HI>danger</HI> of a <HI>verbal answer;</HI>) but I wrote not to Mr. <HI>R.</HI> because he did not write to me, and because my last letter was sent back with contempt, unread as he says. <HI>p.</HI> 70. The whole was designed merely as a memorandum, and to help Mr. <HI>H</HI>'s memory in returning an answer. This script being communicated to a number of the brethren and approved by them, I sometime after delivered to Mr. <HI>H.</HI> who upon hearing it read, said, "he believed (as he gathered from Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s talk) that he would consent to every particular, except that about minister's being present." I then directed him either to read the paper to Mr. <HI>R.</HI> or let him read it himself, and even take a co∣py of it (if he desired it) but to bring back the ori∣ginal. Mr. <HI>H.</HI> accordingly gave him the paper, which having read, he desired it might be left
<PB N="151" REF="012739_0148_0F90909706A5ACE8"/>with him for a while, as not having time to take a copy of it then. It seems he was in such a hurry to communicate it, that he would not take time, as he might well have done; and he could not so well represent it as a letter to him if it had not been in my hand-writing. He presently repairs to his <HI>grand non-communicant counsellor</HI> several times re∣ferred to in this piece; and having consulted with him, he then flies about the town from house to house, and read the paper (after his manner) to those of his favorers he met with, communicants or non-communicants, old and young, (with large annotations) spending the remainder of this and most of the next day in this exercise. So that it was late the next day, and after going 2 or 3 times, before Mr. <HI>H.</HI> could get back the original, and even then he appeared loth to part with it. But he re∣turned me no answer by Mr. <HI>H.</HI> either written or verbal, and signified to him his dislike of <HI>the whole paper,</HI> and that he was generally advised to take no notice of it, with intimations of my being impla∣cable, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the mean time, the report flew like lightning every where, and even into neighboring parishes, "that I had wrote another letter to Mr. <HI>R.</HI> and in it abused and <HI>insulted</HI> him in a high de∣gree, and in short had <HI>done worse than ever before.</HI>" I could not imagine how this could be; and the paper being returned, one or two of the brethren traced, the reports, having the original in their pockets; and the brethren to whom Mr. <HI>R.</HI> read it, appeared generally highly incensed against me for my bad treatment of Mr. <HI>R.</HI> Upon which they read the pa∣per to them. Most of them seemed amazed, and said, Mr. <HI>R.</HI> did not read it so to them, and could scarce believe it was the same paper, and some of them desired to hear it 2 or 3 times before they could give any credit to it, and most of them de∣clared, they could see no harm in the paper as it was read to them now. And some seemed so uneasy, that they said they would go and discourse with Mr. <HI>R.</HI> upon it. But how can this be account∣ed for? would even one of the worst of men have dared thus to impose upon people, when he was
<PB N="152" REF="012739_0149_0F909097B9B32DE0"/>so liable to detection? I answer, I suppose the case to be this; that as he read the paper, he kept paraphrasing as he went along, and keeping his eye upon the paper, they took his comments to be part of the paper: and so were angry or pleased; just as he appeared to be himself. However, this is not a full solution. It is evident by their several accounts, that there must be some paragraphs omit∣ted in reading: for it was generally understood. 1st. That I wrote him another letter, and so was going to create a fresh disturbance. 2d. That the motion for another meeting originated from me and not from him. 3d. That I insisted upon his making a confession previous to the meeting, and bringing or sending it to me in writing, or <HI>he should not see my face</HI> (as he phrased it, or read it, as some say.) Whereas the contrary to all this appeared plainly from the face of the paper. It was wrote to prevent mistakes, and not directed to him. It is a declared answer to a proposal of his; and all re∣quired was, "that he should <HI>signify his readiness</HI>" to make such a confession: but the <HI>actual doing</HI> of it was to be part of the business of the meeting. Thus they would have certainly understood it, if it had been read as it ought to have been. As to the article of <HI>confession,</HI> I thought it a <HI>necessary</HI> pre∣liminary; for what signified it to meet, unless he appeared <HI>disposed to do something?</HI> and this was the <HI>least</HI> I could accept of; and it was in some sort a coming to his terms of <HI>a general making up,</HI> which (to use his phrase) I thought even "a condescensi∣on in me." With respect to the second article, he said, that his hands were to be tyed, but I was to be lest open and loose: Whereas I had several ma∣terial articles against him, besides that of the let∣ters, which were left as much at a loose. The 3d. article he read with an <HI>emphasis,</HI> and it was made criminal in an high degree. There was nothing but <HI>shall, shall, shall.</HI> In short, I appeared as arbi∣trary and absolute as the great <HI>Turk:</HI> it was no∣thing but SHALL and WILL with me. So that I SHALL be almost afraid even to speak in the future tense again, at least in addressing Mr. <HI>R.</HI> There
<PB N="153" REF="012739_0150_0F90909876AF3CB0"/>was another despotical or dogmatic SHALL under the 4th head. As to the 5th, I was for bringing a council upon him at once, and it seems the words "proper and advisable," and it's being proposed by way of query, were sunk in the reading. For the hearers took it, that there was another SHALL here too. And to crown all, he denied that it was he who stop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the brethren's mouth at the form∣er meeting, and said, "it was my own proposal." (Article 3d.) My PROPOSAL! where are we now? into what a world have we got? I should as soon have expected, that he would have denied that we ever had any meeting at all: however I am glad it is come out before my answer went to the press. My PROPOSAL! the deacon who interposed between us, and the only witness in the case, will give his oath to the contrary. And his manage∣ment at the meeting (which I have recited) proves that the restriction came from him, and not from me. But it seems he is ashamed of it, and is going to father it upon me; when as I ever abhorred it, being unreasonable in itself, tending to defeat the whole design of the meeting, and repugnant to the example of all christians in the like cases: (I dare say no instance of this nature can be found in the annals of the church. Mr. <HI>R.</HI> must have the sole honor of the invention.) It was nothing but abso∣lute necessity, and my great desire of peace, that brought me to submit to it. A meeting was to be had upon no other terms But did he not offer other terms? and did not my refusal necessitate him to in∣sist on this? he indeed offered not to lay this re∣striction, if I would have excluded one brother from the meeting. But this I could not consent to: it was as necessary that brother should be present as I myself. Not only as an evidence, but as a par∣ty offended; he looking upon himself as equally involved in the charge of <HI>arminianism</HI> and danger∣ous doctrine; and there could be no thoro' making up without him. As to the conclusion of my pa∣per, that expression was very offensive, "the affair seems ripe for a public cognizance." Here it seems
<PB N="154" REF="012739_0151_0F9090995E78B090"/>I threatned him with a council. But withal sig∣nified, that he would not join or take notice of a council. He then thanks his mountain so strong, that it connot be moved; and is resolved to brave it out against all the world, as long as he can keep the majority of the parish on his side. But is this a christian disposition? is it not <HI>his</HI> (as well as <HI>my</HI>) duty to use all proper means of reconciliation? and is not the advice of ministers and churches one <HI>insti∣tuted means</HI> for that end? and will he reject all? and make numbers his sole refuge? Alas! what one single step hath he ever yet taken for peace, since this controversy begun? and he seems now to declare, that he never designs to take any, but to leave me to my fate! (which sort of manage∣ment seems to give full confirmation to a report long prevalent among us, namely, his saying, <HI>that if we had not got deacon</HI> T. <HI>with us, he should ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e nothing about it</HI>) And his principal adherents join in the same declaration, of taking no notice of my efforts. These are the chief things, that have transpired respecting this paper. His friends seem cautious of speaking, otherwise no doubt we should have ga∣thered up many more. One thing indeed I have heard further, that he gives out "Mr. <HI>H.</HI> went beyond his commission;" whether in making the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>position in his name, or in signifying his con∣sciousness of being to blame, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or in both, I can∣not say. Thus proposals of peace from me are turn∣ed into crimes: if I do, or not do, speak, write, or sit still, people will be more and more angry at me. If I had taken no notice of the proposal at all, I should have been represented as implacable, and bad to the last degree, as refusing all overtures of peace: and if I do take notice of it in the most modest and christian manner, it is looked upon as criminal. What shall I then do? and what will be the end of these things!</P>
