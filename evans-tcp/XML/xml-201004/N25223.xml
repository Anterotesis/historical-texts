<P>THE Governor's deeds to the other companies, their heirs and assigns forever, express a similar con∣veyance of the lands in fee simple.</P>

<HEAD>SECOND PROPOSITION. <HI>The companies assumed the term, fee-simple, and all the responsibility attached to it.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE evidence that they assumed the term is pre∣sented in the 7th section of the second article of the constitution of the Georgia Missisippi Company.</P>
<P>"The President and a majority of the whole Board of Directors and Executive Board collective∣ly, shall have power, and they are hereby fully au∣thorised to sell, and the grantees shall convey any part or parts, or the whole of the territory and rights, granted and conveyed to the Company, to any per∣son or persons in FEE SIMPLE."</P>
<P>EVERY holder of Mississippi script was entitled by virtue of his purchase and certificate to have and hold <HI>to himself and his heirs and assigns forever,</HI> his propor∣tion of the lands in <HI>fee simple.</HI> All the other com∣panies assumed the term, <HI>fee simple</HI>—and the deeds to the northern purchasers generally express a convey∣ance in the very words of the original deeds—but whether expressed or not, every purchaser is entitled to the fee simple by virtue of the public declaration made to the world, that the lands were thus holden and conveyed. Whenever a seller conveys lands in fee simple, he pledges his profits, his payments and his own property on the vesting of this kind of estate in the grantee. If the fee simple fails and he has done this ignorantly, yet he must replace the buyer in as good a situation as the buyer would have been, had the fee simple vested; but if he has used the ex∣pression fraudulently to allure and deceive purchasers, he must refund the money paid and respond in dam∣ages. In the present case it is wholly inconceivable that the Georgia companies have acted igno∣rantly or under the influence of any doubt, whether the fee simple actually vested in them, or not.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="proposition">
<PB N="47" REF="033425_0007_0FF7C3FCB5CF11F8"/>
<HEAD>THIRD PROPOSITION. <HI>The state of Georgia never had any right to the fee simple of the lands, conveyed to the companies.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AN estate in fee simple, is the largest and noblest estate, that a man can have in real property. The proprietor of such estate is invested with an absolute power to improve and dispose of his land as he pleases.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Swift's System.</NOTE> A fee is an estate of inheritance, being the highest interest, that a man can have in lands. When the word <HI>fee</HI> is used with the addition of the word <HI>sim∣ple,</HI> it denotes an unconditional, unlimited estate. The fee simple in lands being the largest possible es∣tate, comprehends all inferior and lesser estates, into which it may be divided.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Black. 10.</NOTE> This is the actual por∣tion of estate to which the northern purchasers are en∣titled.</P>
<P>OF the quality and value of visible estate the buy∣er may judge; but as the portion of estate which the seller has a right to convey, often depends on a long series of papers in the possession of the seller or on construction of law, the uniform presumption is that the seller knows the foundation of his title and his portion of estate; therefore every expression used by the seller, expressing the kind of estate, is stric∣ly construed and if he should sell the fee simple, when he owned but a lesser estate, he must save harmless the buyer from all loss, cost and damage occasioned by the failure of the fee simple. For this purpose the buyer has no need of covenants. His right of indemnity results from this principle of common equity, <Q>That the seller shall cause the buyer to have that for which he received the money or se∣curities of the buyer.</Q></P>
<P>THE money of the northern purchasers has been paid or their notes have been given for the fee sim∣ple
<PB N="48" REF="033425_0008_0FF7C438DE4757C0"/>of the lands, and if the State of Georgia owned this unlimited estate, there must have been some time at which they began to own it and some source from which it must have been derived.</P>
<P>THE author of the state of facts well aware that the right of the state to sell the fee was all important, has assumed the burden of proving it. He first cre∣ates out of nothing a right of pre-emption,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 4.</NOTE> then by severalingenious transmutations changes this pre-emp∣tive right into a right absolute in the soil.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Page 12.</NOTE> At the opening of his fourth page, the indians were the quiet occupants of the lands in fee simple; but in the compass of eight pages, he has deprived them of the fee—has vested it in three powerful nations, humane∣ly reserving to the Indians a right of hunting and fishing.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Minimis oriuntur magna.</NOTE> To shew the absurd origin of this right I present his exact words, page 4.</P>
<P><Q>THE Spaniards, who made the first discovery of America, claimed a right to exclude all other nations from making establishments in this vast extent of country: But other nations refused to admit this absurd claim, in respect to such parts as the Span∣iards had never even visited. The Spaniards in 1521 discovered, and soon after made a settlement in East Florida. The French some time after this, settled in Canada and from thence having acci∣dentally found the great river Missisippi, and pur∣suing its course, they discovered Louisiana, and in 1699 settled a colony at Mobile. The English, in 1607, made their first American settlement in Vir∣ginia—These three powerful nations, having each got possession of a part, disputed about the extent of their several boundaries in these immense re∣gions, through which an almost infinite number of Indian tribes were dispersed. Each claimed <HI>an exclusive right</HI> of purchasing from the natives
<PB N="49" REF="033425_0009_0FF7C43A8A7984C0"/>such lands, as lay within the limits they chose to set to themselves; the sovereignty of which they al∣so claimed: and this right of excluding other na∣tions from purchasing the Indian lands, within such limits, is the foundation of <HI>the right of pre-emption.</HI> These disputes gave rise to the war, that was end∣ed by the treaty of Paris, between France, Spain, and Great-Britain; by which in fact the principle of the right of pre-emption is recognized, in as much as many Indian tribes were living within the limits of each, as then agreed on.</Q></P>
<P>IT seems that the Spaniards, who claim to have first discovered this country, had (as they termed it) an indisputable right by the gift of Pope Alexander the 6th to the property and dominions of all the con∣tinents, islands and seas between the arctic and ant∣arctic poles, &amp;c.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Chandler's com. debates, vol. II. page 52.</NOTE> The French and English after∣wards got footing here, and these three powerful nations not agreeing, went to war, made a peace and then recognised each others rights. <HI>Their quar∣reling created the right, their treaty confirmed it!</HI></P>
<P>ON this foundation is laid the whole building of pre-emptive rights and on this is raised all the claim of the state of Georgia to the fee-simple of the lands, described in the companies deeds.—The author of the State of Facts has traced the whole from this or∣igin and if his outset were good, his conclusions in favor of the right of the state would be plausible at least: But what are the facts?</P>
<P N="1">1st. THE Indians were the first discoverers of this country, and if first discovery and continued occu∣pancy gives title according to the laws of nature and nations<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The law of nature consists in an application of the moral law to the condition of man. The law of nations is an adoption of the law of nature and an agreement in its application. This law, says Justin∣ian, is common to all the human race. This law guarantees to the first discoverer and occupant of any created thing an exclusive title; so that a forcible extermination of such an one is a violence to this law. Camb. Elem.</NOTE> they had acquired an unquestionable title.
<PB N="50" REF="033425_0010_0FF7C43D81D4CBB8"/>How many moons or centuries they had been here, when the Spaniards first discovered that they lived here, is to us wholly unknown. It is enough to the present purpose, that the Spaniards did not first dis∣cover this country, and those, who are very solicitous to decide which has the honor of <HI>discovering</HI> this country, Columbus or Vespusius or Don Juan, may more discerningly direct their historical researches to some tawny warrior of some far distant age.</P>
<P N="2">2d. THE discovery of the Spaniards, that this country was inhabited by peaceful inoffensive tribes, living on fishing and hunting, gave them no right to the soil, nor to the pre-emption of the soil; for the same law of nature which had given to the Indians the fee as first occupants, had also given them a right of selling it to whoever they pleased.</P>
<P N="3">3d. THE gift of Pope Alexander, (being only an abridgment of his predecessor's proffer of all the kingdoms of the earth) partakes too much of the ri∣diculous to be admitted as a serious ground of claim; yet this is as substantial, and certainly as sanctified a claim as ever was made by any christian nation to the pre-emption of Indian lands.</P>
<P N="4">4th. THAT the French discovered the Indians and Spaniards in this country, and that the English found them all here, is no serious ground of claim against the Indians: for they are a party deeply interested in this transaction.</P>
<P N="5">5th. THAT the Spanish, French and English could not agree in the ratio in which they might severally defraud and dispossess these first discoverers and oc∣cupants—and that they went to war about it—and
<PB N="51" REF="033425_0011_0FF7C40186DE8B80"/>that they got tired of fighting and made a treaty at Paris—and that they then agreed on this ratio, are rather arguments of the ravenous and insatiable spirit of those days, than of the right of either to the soil or pre-emption of this country.</P>
<P N="6">6th. THAT the king of Great Britain after this treaty, granted and patented out this country to the minions of his court and officers of his army, is no argument that he owned the fee or right of pre-emp∣tion; even if conquest had given him title to any part, that could not extend to parts not conquered: therefore his patenting from sea to sea is rather to be considered as the vapouring of power, than as an evidence of right. But this may be otherwise ac∣counted for;—the ignorance of the geography of this country, at that distant period, and even within the present century was great.—A man less subject than I am to a reverence for royalty and thrones would be apt to conceive that the kings of those days considered this continent as spread from north to south, like a piece of cloth upon a shop board, which they as arch taylors, were to cut into patterns according to the fancy of their employers: indeed a map of this country, exhibits such slashing, as shows its having been, at some time or other, roughly han∣dled by the head servants of his Majesty's Lords of the bed-chamber.</P>
<P N="7">7th. FROM the farcical parade of British charters we come to the declaration of independence, at which time the author of the state of facts contends, <Q>that the limits of the thirteen British colonies, as fixed by the king's charters or letters patent, were ad∣mitted as the bounds of the jurisdiction of each, without regard to the tribes of Indians living within such limits.</Q> This is a new way of sliding up a title. Pray were the Indians a party to this ad∣mission and confederation? Did they agree to be
<PB N="52" REF="033425_0012_0FF7C43FA4BE8A38"/>subject to such jurisdictions? Are they to suffer the loss of all things to pay for the introduction of white people among them? Or are they laboring under some hidden curse, which the policy of the wiseacres of this world is forever to conceal? They have been suffering and retreating, till one would think that even power and avarice would say, it is enough. If there ever was reason for swarms to rise from older countries and to settle in this, they have already more than room enough for their hives: but be that as it may, the Indians now live in the country, described in the companies deeds. Their progenitors lived there long before the days of Columbus. They have oc∣cupied and improved it—they have never abandoned it, nor been driven from it, and by the United States are recognised in treaties. The northern people have been accustomed to purchase land of Indians willing to sell, and the purchasers have regarded the Indians as <HI>lords of the soil, till deeds were obtained from them:</HI> So say the deeds in the records of the ancient colony of New-Haven: There the Indians conveyed <HI>the lands</HI> not their right of hunting and fishing on them—but can any one contemplate the lands in question and say that the state of Georgia owned the fee, so that Gov. Matthews could with propriety convey the lands in fee simple? For such is the expression in the deeds, <HI>In fee simple as tenants in common and not as joint-tenants.</HI> There is no such thing. The state of Georgia do not now pretend to the fee: The above words were inserted for the purpose of delusion. Congress dis∣avow the idea of states claiming the fee of Indian lands. If the term could ever have been tolerably applied to any part of the Indian country at any period, since the settlement of this country; yet certainly the ap∣plication of it to lands situated as these are, is wholly absurd.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="033425_0013_0FF7C4412D8726C0"/>
By the laws of nature and nations, and by the laws of the United States the Indians have a right in fee and possession to all the lands, described in the companies deeds, and to all the attributes of this right as fully and absolutely as the people of Connecticut can have to their lands, and no act of discovery, con∣quest, or occupancy, has ever vested any white na∣tion with any semblance of title to these lands. No act of dereliction or disuse on the part of the Indians has ever left a moments opening to any possible claim of this kind—hence <HI>the repeated declarations of the state of Georgia—their negociations with Congress—the nature of sovereignty—the implications of the Con. of the U. S.—the extent of boundaries claimed by the state, and the treaty of peace;</HI> so much insisted on by the author of the state of facts amount to nothing, because they are built on nothing. Tis not enough that three powerful nations recognised each others right to the fee or pre-emption of Indian lands. Such a right must first have existed; else a recognition was absurd. That it did not exist has been shewn as clearly as a negative proposition can be shewn, and a plausible affirmative on the origin of this right has never been ushered into our world. The long continued, actual and peaceable possession of the first discoverers is an instant and ample confutation of all that can be said in favor of the right of the state of Georgia to sell the fee of these lands.</P>
<P>I HAVE dwelt thus fully on this subject, because the state of Georgia in the granting act expressed a conveyance of the fee-simple—because the grantees in their deeds to the northern purchasers expressed a conveyance of the fee; because the State of Facts published by the companies declares (page 12) the right of the companies to have been a <HI>right absolute</HI> in the soil—and because under the influence of these delusions the advocates for the granting act are attempt∣ing
<PB N="54" REF="033425_0014_0FF7C406CF1D4340"/>to confound this subject by applying to it all the mazy principles, which in foreign countries have been drawn from feodal systems and landed tenures.</P>
<P>FROM the premises may be drawn the following conclusions.</P>
<P N="1">1st. THE Georgia sellers, in selling the fee of those lands, sold that which they did not own—the granting act was no good evidence of a title to sell the fee—nothing has passed by their deeds and the consideration of the bargains has wholly failed. I say <HI>wholly,</HI> because from my premises the right of pre-emption, if it existed, would be as worthless as the claim to the fee is unfounded; but suppose that the right of pre-emption were of some value; yet the seller is not obliged to admit it even as a partial consideration: For if a man declares to the world by an advertisement or verbally, that he owns the fee of a house and land and offers them for sale and I buy them of him, and it afterwards appears that he had only a lease of them, I am not obliged to open an account current with him—charging him the pur∣chase money and crediting him with the value of the lease; <HI>but the whole bargain is vacated, because the fee, which was the essence of it, did not exist.</HI> This is good law, whether accredited by the books or not. The above case would be more parallel, if the lease were to expire the next hour after the execution of the deed; for then the value of the lease would be just paramount to the value of a right of pre-emption to the Indian lands in the present case.</P>
<P>THE ready answer to this has been, You must have known the facts about this business, when you bought. My reply is, then we must have known that those, who circulated these pamphlets and who declared to us that they owned the fee, were impos∣tors at the time of our purchase, which is hardly sup∣posable. But if any one suppose it, he may be assur∣ed that we did not <HI>know it 'till afterwards.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="55" REF="033425_0015_0FF7C442B94C03B8"/>
2d. IF the fee of the lands was pretended to be conveyed; yet if in fact the fee did not pass—clear∣ly the books on landed tenures must be closed; their principles cannot apply for reasons before stated. The purchasers are not to be driven to all circuities and formalities necessary for a recovery on an un∣founded sale of the fee, because the sellers used the term <HI>fee.</HI> On a conveyance of lands which do not exist, or of lands inaccessible, the purchaser need not be outed and disseised; before he can recover against the seller.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>FOURTH PROPOSITION. <HI>All which the deeds of the northern purchasers can possibly contain is the Georgia right of pre-emption.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS right is of such description, that a rescind∣ing act is completely fatal to it. But before we come to this act, it may not be amiss to consider the nu∣merous circumstances, which render this pre-emptive right of the least possible value.</P>
<P N="1">1st. THE pretence of this right is a standing act of rebellion against the law of nature, which gives lands to the first occupants: It is contrary to the avowed principles of our settlement in this country—a con∣stant violence done to the Indians, by depriving them of an inherent right of selling to the highest bidder—and a wanton grasping for territory beyond the exi∣gences of this, and probably of any future, century.</P>
<P N="2">2d. A PRETENCE of this pre-emption, though holding its right foot on the British charters, and its left on the treaty of peace is a direct violation of the laws of nature and nations, especially while sustained against the consent of the natives and the sovereign will of the union. The issue of the question, wheth∣er these lands are or are not, within the territory of
<PB N="56" REF="033425_0016_0FF7C4450EB4ADD0"/>Georgia is yet doubtful; but the existence of a dis∣pute and the measures of Congress on this subject, shew that the conclusions in the State of Facts, drawn from the acquiescence of Congress, are not correct; and that the Georgia right of pre-emption is not re∣cognised by the supreme power of the union. We are not to believe that Congress are raising this ques∣tion for the purpose of securing to the United States a right of pre-emption; but for the better purpose of substantially guaranting to the Indians, that indem∣nity for wrongs and that protection from future in∣croachments, which they so eminently deserve from us as a nation. To calculate otherwise would be impeaching the justice of the union.</P>
<P N="3">3d. THE numbers, characters and situation of the Indian nations, who possess and cultivate these lands, form a phalanx of arguments against the value of a pre-emptive right, more formidable than the laws of nature or nations—arguments wholly unassailable by force or fraud, and far removed beyond the power of confutation.</P>
<P N="4">4th. THIS pre-emptive claim, unsupported by the laws of nature and nations, disputed by the United States, unheeded by the Indians, stands solely on the declaration of the state of Georgia—on the simple assertion of the only party interested to make it—and standing thus alone was never of any value and prob∣ably will never be of any value to the end of time.</P>
<P>PRE-EMPTIVE rights in their best estate are miser∣able; but this standing on a grant rescinded and burnt—on a title no better at best, than the gift of Pope Alexander—contemplating lands never to be in market, is miserable in the extreme: but this vain and illusive right of pre-emption, <HI>because like Pindar's razors, good for market,</HI> became an object of purchase. The granting act gave them a sort of significance— the parchments with the Governor's name, the seal
<PB N="57" REF="033425_0017_0FF7C40C1D5FED90"/>of the state and the words <HI>fee simple,</HI> all sanctioned by the usual formalities of sovereign legislation, aided by a <HI>State of Facts,</HI> bore a very imposing appearance.</P>
<P>PREVIOUS to the granting act several years had elapsed, in which these lands had not increased in value or demand; but now, by the magic alchymy of speculation, this shadowy, ambiguous right of pre∣emption was commuted to a <HI>fee simple,</HI> and though bought at a fair price in January, had, by the Septem∣ber following risen in market more than 400 per cent, and how high these productive acres would have risen is beyond calculation, if the rescinding act had not restored them to their original standard. By reason of this act the lands have ceased to be of value and the eyes of the northern purchasers have been opened to see the miserable foundation of the Georgia fee and pre-emption. This mighty fabric of speculation was built for tumbling and was desti∣ned to crush in its fall the builders or the owners. Doubtless the Georgians estimate their right as of some value; the glare of this speculation has dazzled them—doubtless the purchasers, who have paid the whole of their money, wish to believe better things about this Georgia right. They will not be persuaded that fee and pre-emption can so suddenly sink out of sight. Will the same men be surprised to hear that even a palace with its magnificent cor∣nices and entabletures has tumbled suddenly to ruins, after being informed that its real foundation was nothing more than <HI>painted bonnet-paper</HI> and that till the time of tumbling, it had been sustained by weak temporary props?</P>
<P>FROM the premises which have been present∣ed, it is fair to conclude that the state of Georgia did pretend to sell the <HI>fee</HI>—that the state never own∣ed
<PB N="58" REF="033425_0018_0FF7C448677F2138"/>the <HI>fee</HI>—that the <HI>fee</HI> never vested in the first com∣panies—that the northern purchasers have never ac∣quired the <HI>fee</HI> and therefore that the whole consider∣ation of the bargains has failed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="proposition">
<P>FIFTH PROPOSITION. <HI>The fee and a right to buy the fee are widely different, and the Georgia claim to pre∣emption is peculiarly worthless.</HI></P>
<P>A RIGHT to buy a fee is no part of a fee. A right of pre-emption is a meer contingent right, <HI>equally</HI> ap∣plicable to real and personal estates. It is a kind of thing, about which a covenant of seisin would be ab∣surd; a thing to which no ouster can be applied. It may be of some value or of no value, according to the object of it—as in the present case.</P>
<P>IF the king of Great-Britain had a clear right to charter to the state of Georgia, an exclusive right to buy the lands in question—and had actually done it —and the lands were clearly within the bounds of that charter—and the right of pre-emption was un∣contested—and the Indians were actually disposed to sell them for less than their value—and the state of Georgia had fairly assigned over this right of pre∣emption—and if there were power enough to prevent their rescinding the assignment—and if no principle of law or policy could annul the assignment of pre∣emptive rights to individuals; then a conveyance from the assignees would be of some value: That is, of just as much value as the Indians were willing to sell them, below what they could be sold for again: Which is just the amount of what the Indians would suffer, by being confined to one set of purchasers, instead of having all the world as bidders.</P>
<P>BUT what a confluence of contingencies is here? Without every one of which the right of pre-emp∣tion
<PB N="59" REF="033425_0019_0FF7C44A06586F78"/>is not worth having; and yet not one of them exists in the present case. Great-Britain had no right to charter the right of purchase—the bounda∣ries of the state and the right of pre-emption in the premises are contested—the Indians have no dispo∣sition to sell at any price—the state has never fairly assigned the right—they have rescinded their fraudu∣lent assignment without a possibility of control, and both law and policy annul the assignment.</P>
<P>ALL these propositions, except the last, are sustain∣ed in these numbers; and of the last, it is sufficient to observe, that if the law of nature and the policy of nations can have subjected the Indians to the pre∣emption of a single state; yet that law and policy must have contemplated states as acting on just and liberal principles: But how excessive is the oppression —when a state may barter this right to individuals, and when these may transfer it through a great suc∣cession of companies, each of which must, in giving an enhanced price for pre-emption, calculate on pur∣chasing the fee for as much <HI>less</HI> than the state could have given for it, as the price which they gave was <HI>more</HI> than the states' price to the purchasers! No one can fail to see that every progression of sales in such a business is an injury to the Indians to the whole amount of the profits in each sale. The event is that the last purchaser has given so much, that he can afford very little for the Indian right—the In∣dians cannot afford to sell it at such a reduced price —a war ensues, and this persecuted people must be driven nearer the southern ocean or the pole. Such has been too much the policy of the white people; and so far as the northern alienations of pre-emption have involved or induced this wrong, so far they have violated the laws of nature and the policy of nations.</P>
<P>THE author of the State of Facts on this subject says, (page 12) <Q>It is exclaimed, what mischiefs
<PB N="60" REF="033425_0020_0FF7C44BAD1CEF58"/>would ensue, if individuals were allowed to pur∣chase Indian rights! But it is no good objection to the validity of a title to property, that the pro∣prietor may use it in such manner, as to become inconvenient to the public.</Q></P>
<P>I AM of those who adopt the exclamation and mean to include in it all which is above expressed —founding myself on an incontestible maxim that a law tending directly to immorality and injustice is void from the beginning. No legislature could have had power to enact such a law.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If a Statute be against common Right or Reason, the common law shall control it and adjudge it to be void. 8 Rep. 118. 2 inst. 527.

Hob. 87. 8 Rep. 118.</P></NOTE> It is the province of phi∣losophers to explore causes; that of legislators to calculate consequences. The wrong in this case is precisely coeval with the law; for it is manifest that even the first grantees could not give the native pro∣prietors as much for their land as the state itself. Hence if law and policy had any reason for subjecting the natives to the pre-emption of a state, as for argu∣ment's sake I have admitted, yet on the instant of al∣ienating this to individuals, law and policy give way to avarice and oppression and the very principles on which the state claimed the right are abandoned. <HI>Hence the companies deeds are void, as given in violation of first principles.</HI></P>
<P>IN pursuit of wealth men are apt to disregard principles and means; but when every view of this subject, while it discloses fraud and collusion, exhib∣its the nothingness of these Georgia claims, surely the discerning purchaser will cease to look forward for gain: his sole object will be restitution for the money paid and indemnity for the wrong suffered.</P>

<HEAD>SIXTH PROPOSITION. <HI>Suppose the state of Georgia had owned the fee of the lands; yet the granting act and the companies deeds are void on principles of common law.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BY reason of the variety of interests and opinions on this subject many will differ from me in some of my premises and conclusions respecting the fee and pre-emption of these lands, I am therefore disposed to try the strength of this question without the aid of them. Be it that the laws of nature and nations were made for white people, and that the Indian na∣tions inhabiting and claiming these lands are to have no protection from the United States. Yet the northern purchasers have acquired nothing by their deeds. All the money paid, the notes given and the expence and labor created have been without any consideration; for the deeds of Governor Matthews to the companies and the granting act authorizing them are absolutely void on a fair principle of com∣mon law. Which is, that <Q>no man or body of men, not being in possession shall sell lands to another or others not in possession.</Q></P>
<P>THIS law has in several of the states been erected in∣to a statute, for the purpose of making it known, and of defining the penalty—it is founded on substantial reason and calculated to prevent disputes, quarrels and bloodshed. The original deeds of the compa∣nies present to the world a higher violation of this common law, than any which has been recorded. The deeds purport to be a conveyance of the fee sim∣ple of certain tracts of land, including islands, &amp;c. describing the very lands, owned, occupied and en∣joyed immemorially by the Indian nations, and lands, whereon the Indians were claiming at the very time when these deeds were signed, and this within the knowledge of the grantors. The author of the State of Facts, whose perception of difficulties appears very
<PB N="62" REF="033425_0022_0FF7C44E1232EB98"/>accurate, endeavours to obviate this by erecting two sovereign rights on the same land. 1st. A fee sim∣ple in the state of Georgia or as he terms it "a right in the soil simple and absolute in its nature." 2d. The Indians right of fishing and hunting, which he says, "is a right in the nation, as long as it continues to exist as a nation. It is an absolute right, of which it cannot be deprived, without its own consent in a fair purchase, by a voluntary abandonment, or by conquest."</P>
<P>This Indian right is unquestionably a sole right of possession, to the exclusion of all others, and has been so uniformly understood, ever since the settlement of this country. The author calls this Indian right <HI>an usufruct</HI> and says that "by long usage and general principles of law it is no less alienable than any other contingent or reversionary interest in lands whatso∣ever." <HI>This is good sliding again:</HI> but where is a sin∣gle instance, in this long usage, of a state selling the Indian lands in fee simple? Where is one general principle of law to justify such an usage? How come the words <HI>contingent</HI> and <HI>reversionary</HI> to be applied to lands sold in fee simple? The Indians know nothing about these nice distinctions, of right absolute in one and right perpetual in another, that is, a fee simple in Georgia, which comprehends and absorbs all lesser estates, and at the same time an usufruct in them, which completely absorbs and annihilates this fee.</P>
<P>THESE paradoxical niceties are exclusively vested in the Georgia companies, and the usufruct of them belongs to the author of the State of Facts.</P>
<P>BY the concession of this author the Indians own this perpetual right of usufruct so absolutely that they cannot be deprived of it, without their own con∣sent in a fair purchase, by a voluntary abandonment or by conquest: Yet according to him the state of Georgia owns the fee-simple.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="033425_0023_0FF7C45032D77CD8"/>
WE have now discovered what this fee-simple is. Instead of being like what the books call fee-simple, the <HI>greatest</HI> possible estate in lands—comprehending all lesser estates, it is the <HI>least</HI> possible estate and com∣prehends nothing. Instead of being, as other fee-simples are, coeval with the creation of this earth, and always vesting in some one, it dates its existence from the date of the Georgia deeds, and never vested in any one, till the delivery of them.</P>
<P>THE companies deeds are made in defiance of the common law, at the very point, where the law mar∣shals all its force: For the natural tendency of them is to produce, in a most aggravated degree, the very evils, the prevention of which gave existence to that law.</P>
<P>THE manner in which disputes, quarrels and blood∣shed would naturally ensue from these deeds has been detailed in the last chapter.</P>
<P>HAD the Indians been conquered, and were in a state of rebellion against the state of Georgia.—Had the state ever possessed these lands, far otherwise might be the merits of this question—but the Indians are on the lands, claiming, cultivating and acknowl∣edging no superior. Not only this: But by the very concession of the companies they are <HI>rightfully</HI> pos∣sessing and enjoying every privilege of a fee except the name; and the selling of the name is of no use; except the eventual intention of that sale be, to give the purchasers a colour of right to defraud, dispute, quarrel with or murder the injured possessors.</P>
<P>THE subject analized—stript of its covering, pre∣sents no other explanation: For the first companies cannot afford to give the Indians so much for their right, as the state could have given: Here is the foundation of fraud laid:—the first grantees can afford still less: The sales will be continued as long as any gain can be made: The fraud becomes magnified.
<PB N="64" REF="033425_0024_0FF7C41678890D90"/>Now if the Indians cannot be cheated, disputes and quarrels will be the consequence and <HI>murder</HI> will (as it ever has done, with those injured tribes) bring up the rear. Tis enough to my present purpose, that the state not being in possession, has sold to compa∣nies not in possession, and this in direct violation of an acknowledged principle of common law. The statutes, which in this case are but a transcript of the common law declare all conveyances of this descrip∣tion <HI>null and void,</HI> which terms may most warranta∣bly be applied to the granting act and the compa∣nies deeds.</P>
<P>SHALL it be said that common law principles are not to regulate and control legislative acts of sove∣reign states? I am ready to agree to the position, provided it may be considered as an agreed point be∣tween us—and it seems hardly competent that com∣mon law principles should be applied to legislative acts, where there is no common law power to en∣force the application: But this salvo will not help the companies; for they, knowing themselves not to be in possession, and purchasing of others who had no claim to possession, have, by their own violation of the same common law, made null and void their own title.—They can claim no exemption from com∣mon law, unless they should claim that the sove∣reignty of the state, (backed by long usage, accor∣ding to the State of Facts,) can sanctify a wrong of the most atrocious magnitude. Be it however, for their sakes, that the state can do this; yet their deeds to the northern purchasers are null and void, for here both parties are subject to this law.</P>
<P>HE who seeks equity must have done equity. He who seeks law must have done legally: But in this case they, who are claiming all the aid of the com∣mon law for the recovery of their notes, have, by their own shewing, been guilty of such a gross vio∣lation
<PB N="65" REF="033425_0025_0FF7C4525AAA4B40"/>of this common law, that the very men whom they are pursuing, have, <HI>by reason of this very violation,</HI> lost all title to the lands for which the notes were given.</P>
<P>IF ever a trial about the title to this naked vision∣ary fee could be brought up, the objection here rais∣ed, against the validity of the granting act and the companies deeds, would be conclusive against the northern purchasers; unless the court trying the question, should deviate from those decisions, which, I am told, have invariably prevailed on this subject.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed by a new compass to discover the fallacy of the companies pretensions.</P>

<HEAD>SEVENTH PROPOSITION. <HI>The Georgia right of fee or pre-emption is not sustained by the system of landed ten∣ures in this country.</HI></HEAD>
<P>JUDGE Blackstone in his Com. Vol. II. Page 7, says, <Q>So long as (colonizing) was confined to the stocking and cultivation of desert uninhabited countries, it kept strictly within the limits of the law of nature: But how far the seizing on coun∣tries already peopled and driving out or massa∣cring the innocent and defenceless natives, merely because they differed from their invaders in language, religion, customs, government or colour; how far such a conduct was consonant to nature, rea∣son or christianity, deserved well to be considered by those, who have rendered their names immor∣tal by thus civilizing mankind.</Q></P>
<P>IT is well known that the first settlers of this coun∣try owe no thanks to the principles accredited by this eminent writer. Whatever might have been their mo∣tives for emigration; yet nature, reason and religion
<PB N="66" REF="033425_0026_0FF7C454047DA498"/>will put in no claim to serve as a basis to our landed tenures.</P>
<P>IN Trumbull's History of Connecticut may be found claims of title, liveries of seizin, and modes of ejectment, unknown to the civil or canon law.</P>
<P>IT is said that our fore-fathers were persecuted for their religion and forced from their native land into this, then howling wilderness. If history discovers that their tribulation had worked patience; if their conduct evinced their abhorrence of persecution— and if the wilderness ceased to howl at their ap∣proach, we ought to bless the event,—It is said that the old world was overstocked, and that the natives of this had more land than they wanted. If history informs that our ancestors took their brethren of this new world by the hand and offered to give them, in exchange for the luxuries of this western hemisphere, the newly imported virtues and science of the east, we ought to bless the event. If He, whose is the earth, had decreed that our fore-fathers should have and enjoy this portion of it—and in token of this decree had put them in possession, we ought to cleave to this high evidence of title, and not to claim be∣yond it. <Q>Pleased with the possession, we seem a∣fraid to look back to the means, by which it was acquired, as if fearful of some defect in our title; or at best we rest satisfied with the decision of the laws in our favor, without examining the reason or authority upon which those laws have been built.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black. Com.

THE laws of nature and the subjects of occupan∣cy, dereliction and disuse have been discussed suffi∣ciently to convince, that on neither of these is our claim to this country supported. No principle found in books or avowed by man sustains this claim. No legal trial in this country has ever tried the strength of our title or decided its operations. From new premises must be new deductions, and he who endeavours to confound titles sustained by the law of nature, sanctioned by the books, confirmed by first occupancy and actual possession—with titles ha∣ving no such origin, aims to pervert mankind—and turning books and principles from their natural to an unnatural use—prostitutes them to the base purposes of seduction, imposture and delusion.</P>
<P>"MIGHT OVERCOMES RIGHT" stands as the basis of this new system of landed te∣nures, as will appear by the following historical com∣ments on the discovery of America. <Q>The war∣like animals on which the Spanish officers were mounted; the artificial thunders which issued from their hands; the wooden castles, which had waft∣ed them over the ocean, struck a panic into the natives, from which they did not recover, until it was too late. Wherever the Spaniards marched, they spared no age or sex, nothing sacred or pro∣fane. The Spaniards went out with their dogs to hunt after men. The unhappy savages almost na∣ked and disarmed, were pursued like deer into the thick of the forests, devoured by mastiffs, killed with gun shot, or surprised and burnt in their hab∣itations.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Guthrie's Discovery of America.</NOTE></Q> <HI>These were the triumphant liveries of seizin in the southern parts of America!!</HI></P>
<P>THE poverty of the inhabitants of Bahama taught Columbus, that this was not the country, which he
<PB N="68" REF="033425_0028_0FF7C41993F690B0"/>was seeking.—<Q>But steering further southward he found a country, abounding in all the necessaries of life, inhabited by a humane and hospitable peo∣ple; and what was of still greater consequence, promising considerable quantities of <HI>gold.</HI> This, therefore, he proposed to make the centre of his discoveries.</Q></P>
<P>IT was not benevolence nor science which moved Columbus to discover countries already discovered; to people regions already populated, or to moralize nations, more virtuous than his own: But <HI>auri sacra fames,</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The cursed thirst of gold.</NOTE> more powerful than Euroclydon, drove this impetuous hero upon these defenceless natives. Ev∣ery new discovery of <HI>gold</HI> formed a new epoch in this history and added fresh laurels to Guthrie's immortal Columbus.</P>
<P>THIS author exclaims, <Q>It is impossible to deter∣mine whether the genius of this great man in first conceiving the idea of these discoveries, or his sa∣gacity in the execution of the plan he had con∣ceived, most deserve our admiration.</Q> My admi∣ration is more suspended between the base motives of the hero, and the unfounded panegyric of his biog∣rapher. He adds, <Q>No one is now imposed on by the name of Americus Vespusius; all the world knows that Columbus was the first discoverer.</Q> I am one (of all the world) who know no such thing. Because this transaction is wholly novel, yet is lan∣guage to lose its usual significance? Is the term, DIS∣COVERY, so convertible that it can be applied with in∣creasing glory to new successions of adventurers?</P>
<P>AT the very time when this weight of glory devol∣ved on Columbus, the immense regions of this coun∣try were populated by millions far exceeding the numbers now living on it. Myriads of rational, in∣telligent beings were scattered throughout every part,
<PB N="69" REF="033425_0029_0FF7C430E3FA8A70"/>enjoying in innocence and simplicity the golden age of society. According to the above author, <Q>The empire of Mexico, at this time, rich, powerful, in∣habited by millions of Indians, had subsisted for a∣ges; its inhabitants were not rude and barbarous; but every thing announced a polished and intelli∣gent people.—Their government, founded on the sure basis of laws, combined with religion, seemed to bid defiance to time itself. Mexico, the capital of the empire, situated in the middle of a spacious lake, was the noblest monument of American in∣dustry. It communicated to the continent by im∣mense causeways, carried through the lake. The city was admired for its buildings all of stone, its squares and market places, the shops, which glit∣tered with gold and silver, and the sumptuous pal∣aces of Montezuma, some erected on columns of jasper, and containing whatever was most rare, curious or useful.</Q> <HI>This was the desert uninhabi∣ted wild, destined for the discovery of that immortal brute Fernando Cortez, whose evidence of title was proclaimed by the groans of Guatimozin, while stretched on burning coals, to compel a discovery, where his treasures were con∣cealed.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER inhospitable wilderness tempted the patriotism of Pizarro. The Peruvian empire, foun∣ded by Mango Capac, had been united, civilized, softened by the institution of a benevolent religion. "In short," says the above author, <Q>there was no part of America, where agriculture and the arts were so assiduously cultivated, and where the peo∣ple were of so mild and ingenuous manners. He adds, Pizarro had no conception of dealing gently with those, whom he called barbarians: But who, though less acquainted with the cruel art of des∣troying their fellow-creatures, were more civili∣zed than himself.</Q></P>

<P>NORTH-AMERICA, abounding less in valuable minerals, became a subject of more gradual and de∣liberate discovery. Among the worthies, whose names have acquired a paper immortality on this sub∣ject, the family of the Cabots stands most conspicu∣ous. In 1494, John Cabot, a Venetian, (born in England) had the <HI>honor</HI> of discovering Newfoundland and the island of St. John's; in consequence of which Henry VII. confered on him another <HI>honor</HI> just equal to it—the order of Knighthood: Whereupon the said John died, and his son Sebastian, using his fa∣ther's journals, had the <HI>honor</HI> of falling in with the continent in the 56th degree of north latitude—and thence the <HI>long extended honor</HI> of exploring the coast as far as the Floridas. <Q>From these discoveries origin∣ated the claims of England to these parts of the northern continent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Trumbull's Hist. of Connect.

<P>THE king's patents opened our title; persecution gave occasion to assert it. I shall only quote one livery of seizin as a sample of the rest. In the year 1637, when quarrels between the ancient inhabitants and the patentees had prepared for the work of death, the conflict at Mistic decided the fortune of
<PB N="71" REF="033425_0031_0FF7C45957A22008"/>this infant colony. The intrepid Capt. Mason, find∣ing that the Indians fought desperately for their wives, their children, their homes and their all, cried out to his men, <HI>We must burn them.</HI> He immediately entering a wigwam, took fire and put it into the mats, with which the wigwams were covered. The fire instantly kindling spread with such violence, that <Q>all the Indian houses were soon wrapped in one gene∣ral flame. The enemy were now seized with as∣tonishment and forced by the flames from their lurking places into open sight and became a fair mark for the English soldiers. Some climbed the palisadoes and were instantly brought down by the fire of the English muskets. Others, desperately sallying forth from their burning cells, were shot or cut in pieces with the sword. Such terror fell upon them, that they would run back from the English into the very flames. Great numbers perished in the conflagration.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE greatness and violence of the fire, the reflec∣tion of the light, the flashing and roaring of the arms, the shrieks and yellings of the men, women and children in the fort, and the shoutings of the Indians without, just at the dawn of the morning, exhibited a grand and awful scene. In little more than an hour this whole work of destruction was finished. Seventy wigwams were burnt and 5 or 600 Indians perished, either by the sword or in the flames. Thus parents and children, the san∣nup and squaw, the old man and the babe, per∣ished in promiscuous ruin.</Q></P>

<P>SUPPOSE that a subject of the Chinese nation should discover that we live here, occupying more land than we want, and savagely cheating each other with the surplus, and should report this to the Em∣peror, and he should patent it out, and the patentees should come with sufficient force to subdue us and should actually involve parent and child, the old man and babe in one promiscuous ruin, and should after∣wards be disputing about the <HI>honor of discovering</HI> this country. What would a survivor of these ruins call them: What would he think of them? The natives of this country differed no more from us than we do from the Chinese; they no more deserv∣ed to have their buildings burnt than we deserve the same calamity. Of one blood are created all nations of men to dwell on the face of the earth: By the same laws of morality and of nature are they all bound; but manifestly on these laws our title can∣not stand. I have introduced this discussion of the original discovery of this country to shew that in this instance MIGHT HAS OVERCOME RIGHT, and that we must resort to a system of landed tenures wholly unknown to the books.</P>
<P>THE king of Great-Britain patented these lands; not because he had any right to them;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The English books declare the king to be universal occupant and entitled to all <HI>derelict</HI> lands: but the same books acknowledge this position to be a fiction of law. <HI>See Bacons abr. term. prerogative.</HI>
<P>On this fiction of law was founded the patent to the earl of War∣wick, of lands thoroughly populated and thus <HI>derelict principles</HI> were substituted in the place of <HI>derelict</HI> lands, and thus for two centuries the Indians have been suffering on account of the profound ignorance of this universal occupant and all his ministers about this country, combined with an ignorance of the fair operation of their own FIC∣TIONS.</P></NOTE>; but because
<PB N="73" REF="033425_0033_0FF7C45C688375C0"/>he was more powerful than the inhabitants, about whose coast his servant Cabot had navigated.</P>
<P>ON the idea of discovery, power or conquest, the charter of New-England, granted in 1620, could not contain much land, as but little was, at that time, conquered or discovered by the king's subjects. The same is true of that of Connecticut in 1631. Both are very indefinite as to the kind of right intended to be conveyed; but both manifestly express the premises as extending from sea to sea; and by virtue of these and similar charters the different states have claimed a right of preference to purchase, incroach or con∣quer within the limits of them severally assigned.</P>
<P>THE first speculators in this business were the earl of Warwick and others to the number of 40, com∣monly called "The great Plymouth Company." These sold Massachusetts to Sir Henry Roswell and others—Connecticut to Viscount Say and Seal and Co.—and thus the titles went from hand to hand, as the Georgia speculation has done, <HI>neither party in possession,</HI> and the natural consequence was disputes, quarrels and bloodshed.</P>
<P>As the principles of natural and common law are now out of the question, all was well enough; there was substantial land at bottom; power enough to assert it; and an unlimited right to exercise this power was implied in the original charter; in this it differed much from the present speculation. History discov∣ers, that what money and fair words could not effect, this power effected—and in the event we have got the lands, and in them a goodly heritage.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="033425_0034_0FF7C424871917C8"/>
THE divines, moralists and historians of our coun∣try, confounded at the nothingness of these charters, and the cruelty which followed them, have endeav∣oured to make up a title from a mixture of ingre∣dients.</P>
<P>THE first of which is—<HI>The precedent of Moses in driving out the heathen from the promised land;</HI> and under this head we are told of the barbarity and sav∣age manners of the natives of this country. As the precedent was of divine authority, and the case in question was not, they do not well compare.</P>
<P N="2">2d. <HI>THAT our ancestors were persecuted and obliged to seek an asylum here.</HI> Much pains have been taken to rescue the characters of our persecuted pious an∣cestors from the obloquy cast on the first companies. Be it remembered that the tenure of lands, and peace of conscience are things wholly distinct, and that this discussion has nothing to do with ecclesiastical bear∣ings and distances. If persecution made an asylum necessary: yet an asylum from danger and a right to buy Indian lands, or to annoy, murder or expel quiet inhabitants are matters wholly different. If necessity be admitted as a fair argument; yet as that necessity extends not to the Georgia fee and pre-emption, its application to the present question is wholly inad∣missible.</P>
<P N="3">3d. <HI>THAT numerous treaties and purchases were made and Indian deeds obtained.</HI> This is the best evidence of title; but as these deeds express a conveyance of <HI>lands,</HI> not of any remnant of right therein they shew conclusively, that those, who made these purchases, did not rely on their charters. As there is no pretence that these Georgia lands have been bought or that any deed has been obtained, this evidence of title does not exist in the present case.</P>

4th. <HI>WHEN the argument of conquest is used, that not extending to the lands in question affords no evidence of right.</HI></P>
<P>WHETHER the lands now owned, occupied and enjoyed without molestation, by the citizens of the United States, are claimed on the ground of necessi∣ty, religion, persecution, treaty, purchase or conquest or whatever pretence of claim may be made to them:—Let it be regarded, that they are well hold∣en; but as none of these pretences can be made to the lands in question—the Georgia claim to fee or pre-emption is not sustained.</P>

<P>THE doctrine of pre-emptive right has always been understood with us as a mere right of a colony or state to exclude other colonies or states from pur∣chasing lands within the limits of their charters, which understanding included in it a reservation to themselves to purchase whenever the natives were disposed to sell. In this was not included any idea of a right in fee vesting in a colony or state, nor of any financial resources resulting from such reserva∣tion.</P>
<P>THOUGH this reservation followed the charter lines, it resulted not from the charter, but from the necessity of the case.</P>
<P>AFTER many years settlement in this country, it was found inexpedient to suffer individuals to be tampering with the natives for purchases of land; in consequence of which laws were made to prevent it.</P>
<P>THAT of Connecticut, enacted in 1717 is as fol∣lows:</P>

<HEAD>An act concerning purchases of native rights to land.</HEAD>
<P>This assembly observing many difficulties and per∣plexities arising in this government, by reason of many purchases of land made of Indian titles, without the preceding allowance, or subsequent approbation of this Assembly:</P>
<P>Which to remove; <HI>IT is hereby enacted and declared by this Assembly, and the authority thereof,</HI> That no title to any lands in this colony can accrue by any purchase made of Indians, on pretence of their being native pro∣prietors thereof, without the allowance or appro∣bation of this assembly.</P>
</DIV1>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>THE same necessity led up a similar arrangement between the colonies, and though it was an evil and a wrong to the natives; yet of two evils it was the least, as a competition among the colonies, about pur∣chases, might lead to quarrels and wars with the na∣tives. At the union of the colonies, this reservation was not thrown into common stock. By the treaty of peace a line between the British possessions and the United States was designated, which extending to the Missisippi, left within our lines about 220 millions acres of territory, mostly owned and enjoy∣ed immemorially by the natives. In the confedera∣tion of the United States, the reservation of each was not relinquished. But the reservation thus continu∣ed was in no respect fortified.</P>
<P>HOWEVER inventive speculation had in the mean time suggested, that selling this reservation to com∣panies would obviate the evils contemplated by suf∣fering individuals to purchase. The idea of filling the public coffers by selling this indefineable some∣thing induced the sale of the Chenessee country, and the lands south of Lake Erie. By the deeds the
<PB N="77" REF="033425_0037_0FF7C429E1CEE070"/>purchasers were not invested with the FEE SIMPLE of the lands, nor with any attribute of real estate; but with a right of excluding others from purchasing them, and of being purchasers in their own persons, whenever the policy of the United States and the dis∣position of the natives to sell, should coincide to bring them into market.</P>
<P>IN these sales the states did not authorize the pur∣chasers to claim any <HI>right</HI> against the natives, on the ground of <HI>necessity, religion, persecution, treaty, purchase or conquest.</HI> All this new system of landed tenures had wrought its perfect work. The states merely withdrew themselves from the chance such as it was, and in the two first releases received less than a 30th part of what the lands in fee with a right of posses∣sion would have been worth.</P>
<P>IN the mean time the policy of the United States, tho' elevated above the idea of taking advantages of the Indians; yet not having power to compel ces∣sions of this territory, had, by making treaties on the one hand, and on the other enacting laws, con∣troling the exercise of these reservations, sufficiently expressed its authority over pre-emptive rights.</P>
<P>THIS policy was expressed by the law on this sub∣ject passed March 1st, 1793.</P>
<P><Q>No purchase or grant of <HI>lands</HI> or of any title or claim thereto, from any Indians or nation or tribe of Indians within the bounds of the United States, shall be of any validity in law or equity, unless the same be made <HI>by</HI> a treaty or convention entered into <HI>pursuant to the constitution.</HI></Q></P>
<P>WHEN cessions of territory have been made to the United States, the utmost exertions could never draw from the supreme legislature any concession of the existence of a pre-emptive right, or any guaranty of any part to be reserved.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See resolutions of Congress when Connecticut cession was made.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="033425_0038_0FF7C46320E40370"/>
WHAT confidence could be placed in the wisdom, policy or good faith of a nation, which should sign treaties with one hand and with the other betray the tribes, with whom they were made? Or what confi∣dence could be placed in a nation, which trampling on the laws of nature, and the sacred doctrine of e∣qual rights, should give sanction to charters, baseless as those of the states, by aiding to extend their effects beyond the bounds, <HI>which even avarice and cruelty had formerly set to them?</HI> But this confidence remains; this policy has never been relaxed, except when the relaxation was perfectly in unison with the feelings and interests of the tribes concerned.</P>
<P>As the purchasers of the northern pre-emptions, have in fair market, with full consent of all parties, bought the fee and possession of the lands, and as no question has ever been had on the merits of the sub∣ject, it is impossible to draw any legal inference from our quit-claims to the Georgia conveyances.</P>
<P>As the northern states never claimed nor alienated the fee simple—as they alienated no right to pur∣chase—as the congressional power to hold a treaty alone gave the right to purchase, and as actual pur∣chase northern quit-claims on this subject amounted to no more than a declaration on the part of the states that they would never attempt to exercise a claim, which from my premises, appears to have had no founda∣tion even in the <HI>base</HI> principles of their charters, and which exercise had before been controled by the U∣nited States.</P>
<P>THESE states did not pretend to any fraud and collusion practised on them, and therefore did not rescind their quit-claims: had they done this, the consequence might have furnished a precedent in the present case.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="033425_0039_0FF7C464D5CF63A8"/>
As the event has proved, their renunciations of claim have not been prejudicial to the interest nor opposed to the policy of the union; therefore the evils, fairly calculable, as the issue of absolute claims on indian land have not occurred. But in the case of the Georgia sales, no such event can have pre∣sented.</P>
<P>THEREFORE—Whether we canvass the discovery of this country—the charters of the colonies, lead∣ing up their new system of landed tenures—the practice of the northern states upon this system—or the policy of the union; every view of the subject presents a more hideous conception of the daring swindling practised on the world by the Georgia granting act, and the companies deeds <HI>purporting to be conveyances of the fee-simple of the Indian lands.</HI></P>
<P>THIS view of our subject, while it excludes forev∣er the idea of a fee-simple, vesting in the state of Georgia, presents abundant reasons why the northern people were deluded by this speculation—and while it discloses a new system of landed tenures—excludes all the book principles on landed tenures—and all decisions upon those principles from any application to the present case.</P>
<P>As the insertion of the word FEE-SIMPLE in the companies deeds led up the whole imposture, I pre∣sent that insertion as a supreme instance of fraud, collusion and atrocious speculation, engendered be∣tween corrupt members of a legislature and corrupt∣ing purchasers, <HI>for the express purpose of swindling.</HI></P>
<P>HAD the companies deeds expressed a conveyance of <HI>the mere right of pre-emption,</HI> the northern sales could never have been effected. Men, alive, awake, capable of calculation as the northern people are,
<PB N="80" REF="033425_0040_0FF74C37C557B8B8"/>would never have bartered their substantial property for such a miserable shadow.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<P>THE next proposition selected from the first pamphlet, as a subject of evidence and discus∣sion, is, <HI>that the state of Georgia has fairly, legally and equitably rescinded the granting act.</HI></P>
<P>THE evidence of this rescinding is presented in the following form.</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="Act">
<HEAD><HI>AN ACT</HI> Declaring null and void a certain usurped act passed by the last legislature of this state, at Augusta, on the seventh day of January, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five, under the pretended title of "An act supplementary to an act enti∣tled, an act for appropriating a part of the unlocated territory of this state, for the payment of the late state troops, and for other purposes therein mentioned; declaring the right of this state to the unappropriated territory thereof, for the protection of the frontiers, and for other purposes:" And for expunging from the face of the public records the said usurped act, and for declaring the right of this state to all lands laying within the boundaries therein mentioned.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS the free citizens of this state, or in other words the community thereof, are essentially the source of the sovereignty of the state, and no individual or body of men can be entitled to, or vested with any authority which is not expressly derived from that source, and the ex∣ercise
<PB N="82" REF="033425_0042_0FF74C614CCAA880"/>or assumption of powers not so derived, become of themselves oppression and usurpation; which it is the right and duty of the people or their representatives to resist, and to restore the rights of the community so usurped and in∣fringed.</P>
<P>AND WHEREAS the will or constitution of the good people of this state is the only existing legal authority deriv∣ed from the essential source of sovereignty, and is the only foundation of the legislative power or government thereof, and so far as that will or constitution expressly warrants, the legislature may go, but no further; and all constructive powers not necessarily deduced from that expressed will, are violations of that essential source of sovereignty, and the rights of the citizens, and are therefore of no binding force or effect on the state, or the good people thereof, but null and void.</P>
<P>AND WHEREAS the last legislature of this state not confining itself to the powers with which that body was con∣stitutionally invested, did usurp a power to pass an act on the seventh day of January, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five, entitled "An act supplementary to an act enti∣tled, an act for appropriating a part of the unlocated territo∣ry of this state, for the payment of the late state troops and for other purposes therein mentioned, declaring the right of this state to the unappropriated territory thereof, for the protection of the frontiers, and for other purposes;" by which an enormous tract of unascertained millions of acres of the vacant territory of this state, was attempted to be dis∣posed of to a few individuals, in fee-simple, and the same is not only unfounded as being without express constitutional authority, but is repugnant to that authority, as well as to the principles and form of government, the good citizens of this state have chosen for their rule, which is democratical, or a government founded on equality of rights; and which is totally opposed to all propriety grants, or monopolies, in favor of a few, which tend to build up that destructive aris∣tocracy, in the new, which is tumbling in the old world; and which, if permitted, must end in the annihilation of de∣mocracy and equal rights; those rights and principles of government which our virtuous forefathers fought for, and established with their blood.</P>
<P>AND WHEREAS the fourth section of the fourth arti∣cle of the constitution of the United States declares, "The United States shall guarantee to every state in this Union a republican government," which could never have been in∣tended to a republican aristocracy, and which such extrava∣gant
<PB N="83" REF="033425_0043_0FF74C66E1BEC758"/>grants tend to establish, the constitution of the United States expressly acknowledging a republican democracy, or the foundation of the people: it receiving all its force and power from their hands as their gift, which is manifest from its context, "We the people of the United States."</P>
<P>AND WHEREAS as before mentioned the said usurped act is repugnant to the constitutional authority, in as much as that by the sixteenth section of the first article of the consti∣tution of this state it is declared, "That the general assembly shall have power to make all laws and ordinances which they shall deem necessary and proper for the good of the state, which shall not be repugnant to this constitution." And the said usurped act is opposed to the good of the state, and it is self-evident that the legislature which assumed the pow∣er did not deem it for the good of the state:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1st. Because self preservation or the protecting itself is the greatest good and first duty of every government, and as has been shewn, immense monopolies of land by a few individ∣uals under the sanction of government is opposed to the prin∣ciples of democracy, or the fundamental laws the citizens of this state have chosen for their rule, which so far from being for the good or self-preservation of the democratical, or equal government, is most manifestly for its destruction and in∣jury.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. Because the expression "good of the state" embraces the good of the citizens composing the state, and the good of the citizens consists in the peaceable pursuit of happiness, and the enjoyment of all rights natural, or acquired, not ex∣pressly delegated for the purposes of government; and a sale of such an enormous tract to a few speculators, which was and is the common right of all the good citizens of this state, is contrary to those rights, and therefore to their man∣ifest injury, and of course to the injury of the state.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. Because even supposing constitutional authority to have been vested in the legislature for the purpose of such disposal, the legislature was not vested with power to trans∣fer the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the state over the ter∣ritory attempted to be disposed of, which it has done by opening a door for sale to foreign powers, and a relinquish∣ment of the powers of taxation until the proprietors chuse to be represented, which is in fact dismembering the state, and which transfer and relinquishment cannot be for the good of the state.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4th. Because there was no necessity or pressing urgency for the sale of such an immense tract of territory, equal to some European kingdoms, to carry into execution, and ope∣ration,
<PB N="84" REF="033425_0044_0FF74C7034BC7918"/>the extinguishment of the Indian claims to the lands between the sunconee and Ockmulgee, contemplated by the act entitled "An act for appropriating a part of the unloca∣ted territory of this state for the payment of the late state troops, and for other purposes therein mentioned;" the sub∣terfuge on which the said usurped act of the seventh of Ja∣nuary, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five was foun∣ded, when the whole amount of the appropriation for that purpose was but thirty thousand dollars, and funds to a greater amount were then in the treasury unappropriated: And because no state or nation is justified in wantonly dissi∣pating its property or revenues, and a legal alienation of which can only take place from the most pressing necessity; and the territory attempted to be disposed of, was the said usurped law valid, was wantonly dissipated, it being disposed of for the trifling sum of five hundred thousand dollars, a sum not adequate to the annual quit rents such lands were char∣ged with previously to the revolution, by the British king; which wanton dissipation cannot be for the good of the state.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5th. Because exclusive of the immense loss of revenue to which the state is exposed from the relinquishment of taxa∣tion, the sum of five hundred thousand dollars was accepted as the consideration money for the sale, and the sum of eight hundred thousand dollars offered by persons of as large a cap∣ital, and as much respectability and credit, and on terms more advantageous to the state, was refused; which as it was (should the said usurped act have been considered valid) a clear loss of three hundred thousand dollars to the revenues of the state, it is evident that the law authorising the sale was not deemed by the members of the legislature for "the good of the state," which must have consisted in obtaining the highest price and the most advantageous terms.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6th. For the very excellent reasons given by his excel∣lency the governor in his dissent to the first bill for the dis∣posal of the said territory, delivered to the house of repre∣sentatives on the twenty-ninth of December, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-four, and which bill was not ma∣terially different from the act in question; and which rea∣sons prove, that his excellency as a negative branch of the legislature, although he concurred in the law, did not deem it for "the good of the state," and which dissent was in the words following:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1st. I doubt whether the proper time is arrived for dispos∣ing of the territory in question.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="85" REF="033425_0045_0FF74C7A7677CD48"/>
2d. If it was the proper time, the sum offered is inadequate to the value of the land.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. The quantity reserved for the citizens is too small, in proportion to the extent of the purchase.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4th. That greater advantages are secured to the purchasers than to the citizens.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5th. That so large an extent of territory being disposed of to companies of individuals will operate as monopolies, which will prevent or retard settlements, population and ag∣riculture.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6th. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> should such disposition be made, at least one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the lands should be reserved for the future disposal of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tate.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7th. That if public notice was given, that the land was for sale, the rivalship in purchasers would most probably have increased the sums offered.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8th. The power given to the executive by the constitu∣tion, the duty I owe the community, and the sacredness of my oath of office, will, I flatter myself, justify this dissent in the minds of the members of the legislature, and of my other fellow citizens.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>

<P>AND WHEREAS the said usurped act passed on the sev∣enth day of January, one thousand seven hundred and nine∣ty-five, is also repugnant to the afore recited sixteenth sec∣tion, in as much as it is repugnant to the seventeenth or sub∣sequent section of the said first article, which declares: "They (the legislature) shall have power to alter the boun∣daries of the present counties, and to lay off new ones, as well out of the counties already laid off, as out of the other terri∣tory belonging to the state. When a new county or coun∣ties shall be laid off out of any present county or counties, such new county or counties shall have their representation apportioned out of the number of representatives of the county or counties out of which it or they shall be laid out, and when any new county shall be laid off in the vacant ter∣ritory belonging to the state, such county shall have a num∣ber of representatives not exceeding three, to be regulated and determined by the general assembly:" And the territory disposed of not laying within the limits of any country al∣ready laid off, and a sale and grant thereof, should the said u∣surped law be deemed valid, having been made, it could not be defined the vacant territory belonging to the state, where∣by the constitutional powers vested in the general assembly by the said seventeenth section would be barred and prevent∣ed, and consequently the settlers on the territory sold, be de∣prived of the constitutional right of representation, and is
<PB N="86" REF="033425_0046_0FF74C864F2F7768"/>not only thus repugnant to the said fixteenth and seventeenth fections, but thereby and by the relinquishment of the right of taxation, until the settlers were represented, which they cannot constitutionally be, is also repugnant to the whole letter and spirit of the constitution, it operating as a derelic∣tion of jurisdictional rights, and a virtual dismemberment of the state.</P>
<P>AND WHEREAS in and by the articles of confederation entered into and finally ratified on the first day of March, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-one, by the then thirteen states of America, the territory within the limits of each of the said states is to each of them respectively confirm∣ed and guaranteed, first by the second article, to wit, "Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction and right, which is not by the con∣federation expressly delegated to the United States in Con∣gress assembled." And secondly, by the last clause in the second section of the ninth article, "No state shall be de∣prived of territory for the benefit of the United States." And in and by the first clause of the fixth article of the fed∣eral constitution of the United States, "All engagements entered into before the adoption of the said constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under the said con∣stitution as under the confederation:" and by the twelfth article of the amendments to the said constitution, ratified and adopted, "The powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states; are reserved to the states respectively or to the people."</P>
<P>AND WHEREAS in and by the definitive treaty of peace signed at Paris on the third of September, one thousand sev∣en hundred and eighty-three, the boundaries of the United States were established, and the United States fully recogni∣zed and acknowledged by the first article thereof, in the words following: "His Britannic majesty acknowledges the said United States, viz. New-Hampshire, Maifachusetts∣bay, Rhode-Island, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Caroli∣na, South-Carolina and Georgia, to be free, sovereign and in dependent states, that he treats with them as such, and for himself, his heirs and successors, relinquishes all claims to the government, proprietary and territorial rights of the same;" and by the second article it is declared; "And that all disputes which might arise in future on the subject of the boundaries of the said United States, may be prevented, it is hereby agreed that the following are and shall be their boun∣daries." And tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> boundaries thereby declared, which
<PB N="87" REF="033425_0047_0FF74C920E82CC48"/>limit the westwardly and southwardly parts of this state, are thus desined: "Along the middle of the Missisippi until it shall intersect the northernmost part of the thirty-first degree of north latitude; south by a line drawn due east from the termination of the line last mentioned in the latitude of thir∣ty-one degrees north of the equator, to the middle of the river Apalachicola or Chatahooche; thence along the middle thereof to its junction with Flint river: thence straight to the head of St. Mary's river; and thence along the middle of St. Mary's river to the Atlantic ocean;" and the king of Great Britain did, by proclamation dated the seventh day of October, in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty-three, annex to the then province of Georgia, all the lands laying between the said river St. Mary's and the Alatamaha, its former boundary claimed by South-Carolina under her charters; and the state of South-Carolina, in and by a con∣vention held and concluded between the commissioners of the said states, at Beaufort, under the authority and articles of the confederation, on the twenty-eighth of April, in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven, did con∣firm to the state of Georgia the southward and west wardly boundaries described in the said treaty of Paris, by cession and relinquishment of all right, title and claim which the said state possessed from the original charter thereof, to the government, sovereignty and jurisdiction in and over the same, and also the right of pre-emption of the soil from the native Indians, and all other the estate, property and claim, in or to the said land; and the boundaries so described, also coincide with the boundaries of this state as described by the land act of this state now in force, passed at Savannah, the seventeenth of September, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three, (except as to the northern boundary of the state) which by the said convention is thus established and ratified by the first article thereof: "The most northern branch or stream of the river Savannah from the sea or mouth of such stream, to the fork or confluence of the rivers now called Tugaloo or Keowee, and from thence to the most nor∣thern branch or stream of the said river Tugaloo, till it in∣tersects the north boundary line of South-Carolina, if the said branch or stream of Tugaloo extends so far north, reser∣ving all the islands in the said rivers Savannah and Tugaloo to Georgia; but if the head spring or source of any branch or stream of the said river Tugaloo does not 'extend to the north boundary of South-Carolina, then a west line to the Missisippi."</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="033425_0048_0FF74C9B79EE1400"/>
AND WHEREAS until the formation of the confedera∣tion there could possibly belong no territorial rights to the United States, nor after such formation within the chartered limits of any state, but such as were specially ceded and re∣linquished by the respective states; and the people of the state of Georgia have by no act of theirs, or in any manner or shape whatever, transferred or aliened or delegated a pow∣er to transfer or alien the territory attempted to be disposed of by said usurped act passed on the seventh of January, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five, and the same and every part thereof is hereby declared to be vested in the state and people thereof, and inalienable, but by a Convention called by the people for that express purpose, or by some clause of power expressed by the people delegating such ex∣press power to the legislature in the constitution.</P>
<P>AND WHEREAS divested of all fundamental and con∣stitutional authority which the said usurped act might be de∣clared by its advocates, and those who claim under it, to be founded on: fraud has been practised to obtain it, and the grants under it. And it is a fundamental principle both of law and equity, that there cannot be a wrong without a rem∣edy, and the state and the citizens thereof have suffered a most grievous injury in the barter of their rights by the said usurped act and grants, and there is no court existing if the dignity of the state would permit her entering one, for the trial of fraud and collusion of individuals, or to contest her sovereignty with them, whereby the remedy for so notorious an injury could be obtained; and it can no where better lay than with the representatives of the people chosen by them, after due promulgation by the grand juries of most of the counties of the state, of the means practised, and by the re∣monstrances of the people to the Convention, held on the tenth day of May, in the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five, setting forth the attrocious speculation, cor∣ruption and collusion, by which the said usurped act and grants were obtained.</P>
<P>AND WHEREAS the said petitions and remonstrances of the good people composing the state, to the said late con∣vention held at Louisville on the said tenth day of May, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five, produced a resolu∣tion of that body in the following words: "<HI>Resolved,</HI> That it is the opinion of this Convention, that from the numbers, respectability, and ground of complaint stated in the sundry petitions laid before them, that this is a subject of importance meriting legislative deliberation. <HI>Ordered therefore,</HI> That such petitions be preserved by the Secretary and laid before
<PB N="89" REF="033425_0049_0FF74CA6747F7FB8"/>the next Legislature at their ensuing session." Which res∣olution invests this Legislature with conventional powers, <HI>quoad hoc,</HI> or in common terms, for the purpose of investi∣gating the same, and which gives additional validity to le∣gislative authority, were the powers of one Legislature over the acts of another to be attempted to be questioned.</P>
<P>AND WHEREAS it does appear from sundry affidavits and a variety of proofs satisfactory to this Legislature, as well as from the presentments of the grand juries on oath of a considerable majority of the counties of the state, and by the afore-recited petitions and remonstrances of the good people thereof to the Convention, and by numerous peti∣tions to this present Legislature to the same purport, as also from the self-evident proof of fraud, arising from the rejec∣tion of eight hundred thousand dollars, and the acceptance of five hundred thousand dollars, as the consideration money for which the said territory was sold; that fraud and corrup∣tion were practised to obtain the said act and grants, and that a majority of those members of the Legislature who voted in favor of the aforesaid act, were engaged in the purchase; and a majority of one vote only appeared in favor of the said u∣surped act in the Senate, and on which majority in that branch the same was passed, and corruption appears against more than one member of that body; which exclusive of the many deceptions used, and the inadequacy of price for such an immense and valuable tract of country, would be sufficient in equity, reason, and law, to invalidate the contract, even supposing it to be constitutional, which this Legislature de∣clares it is not.</P>

<P>THIS rescinding act, whether regarded in a legal, equitable or moral point of view does the highest credit to the legislature which passed it. If it depriv∣ed the northern purchasers of momentary hopes of wealth without labor, it probably saved thousands from imposition. If it nipt in the bud a number of aspiring swindlers, it exhibited to the world an act of sovereign justice, which thoroughly canvassed, will be found to stand on an immoveable basis.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>SECOND PROPOSITION. <HI>This rescinding act is com∣pletely fatal to all claims on the part of the companies and the northern purchasers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>To try the strength and equity of this act, let us first consider what was in fact conveyed by the granting act and the companies deeds.</P>
<P>NOTHING more can vest or pass by any convey∣ance, than what the grantor owned or had a right to convey; therefore the <HI>fee-simple,</HI> though expressed in the deeds, did not pass; because the state did not
<PB N="93" REF="033425_0053_0FF74CCD26AB3B20"/>own it. The right of possession, use or dominion could not pass; because the state had not even a claim to it. An assignment of any right under the British charters could not pass; for the lands des∣cribed had never been altered nor affected since the creation of the world. No pretence under the old or new system of landed tenures, could reach these lands. It could not convey a right to buy the land; for this could only be given by the United States. It could not be a right to conquer the Indians; for this either in a state or an individual would have been treason against the union.</P>
<P>THE whole extract and essence of the granting act and the companies deeds was a simple, unresponsible declaration of the representatives of the sovereign people of Georgia, that the people after the date thereof would have no claim upon certain lands with∣in their assumed limits.</P>
<P>THIS declaration, which ought long before to have been made to the United States was made to the companies for the price of half a million dollars, and instead of being couched in the narrow compass of a due-bill, was promulgated to the world with great legislative formality as a bona fide conveyance of the fee-simple of lands within their territory.</P>
<P>THE progress of this business from its rising to its zenith and thence its falling to its original nothing∣ness have been sufficiently traced. But the people of Georgia, indignant at the granting act, have re∣scinded this declaration, and such are the real con∣tents of the granting act that this rescinding is fatal to the companies.</P>
<P>CONSIDERING the rescinding act in this point of view, what is the condition of the northern purcha∣sers? They claim a right to purchase the lands, merely because the representatives of the state of Georgia declared that after the 7th of Jan. 1795,
<PB N="94" REF="033425_0054_0FF74CD433C68440"/>the state would not claim such a right; but after∣wards in Feb. 1796, the people declared that they would claim such a right, and further declared that the companies, to whom this first declaration was made, might take their money again: but for you, who had been defrauded by these companies, they made no provision, and you have no means to com∣pel the state to withdraw their claim.</P>
<P>Now suppose the best possible case for the pur∣chasers, viz. that the state of Georgia owned the fee: yet these men, who are pursuing you for money, have it completely in their power to receive back the money from the treasury—to give up their deeds, and to ratify and confirm the act beyond all contro∣versy: for the contract was only between the state and the companies—you are no parties to it. This can be done now, or at any time hereafter. The re∣scinding act has left your claim wholly in the power of your tormentors, and has given them the tempta∣tion of half a million dollars to exercise this power, and their past conduct has left you no room to doubt their disposition to do it.</P>
<P>SHEWING you this in the case of a fee, you will apprehend on what a slender thread your title is sus∣pended, provided the granting act should happen to include any estate less than a fee.</P>
<P>'TIS true you are told by the books, that <HI>a fee al∣ways vests in some one,</HI> and from thence may infer, that in the case proposed the fee would have been vested in you, so that no agreement between the state and the companies could be conclusive: but unfortu∣nately the same law, which gives you this momenta∣ry comfort, tells you <HI>that no fee can vest, where nei∣ther party is in possession;</HI> provided, <HI>that any is in pos∣session claiming and holding all others out,</HI> which was true in the present case. And unfortunately the last clause of this law applies to every kind of right
<PB N="95" REF="033425_0055_0FF74A605FE93468"/>or claim in real estate, and when you leave real estate the law leaves you; so that however you might con∣sider your claim, it would be completely voidable by the act of the parties who made the contract.</P>
<P>THUS, separate from the strength and operation of the rescinding act in itself, and from all your feel∣ings and reasonings about it, your claim is left whol∣ly at the mercy of the companies, and this because you have not the actual fee simple, which they pre∣tended to sell you.</P>
<P>THIS consideration, added to the <HI>worthlessness</HI> of your claim, presents, in a strong point of view, the vanity of all reliance on your purchases.</P>
<P>BEYOND this, by destroying the records of the ori∣ginal deeds, and closing the records against after con∣veyances, the rescinding act has put it in the power of any person, intermediately claiming the lands, to break a link in the chain of title, on which you may rely; this he may do by burning his deed or by con∣veying to another and dating his deed anterior to yours. As you have no record, nor act of possession to evidence your title, and as the proof of such fraud would doubtless be out of your power, you see how easily your prospects might be cut off; and this merely by the <HI>existence</HI> of the rescinding act, without any reference to its merits.</P>
<P>BUT the actual strength and operation of this act is further discovered, <HI>in its having actually destroyed the marketable quality of the lands.</HI> This shews that the body of mankind, whatever they may think of its equity, really considers it fatal to your claim; for if they judged the rescinding act to be of no consequence, your lands would be of as much value as ever.</P>
<P>BUT the strength of this act is further discovered in its having withstood all the elements combined to defeat it, triumphant over all the passions, which a∣gitate men disappointed in prospect of wealth, and
<PB N="96" REF="033425_0056_0FF74A68F2BEF780"/>equally above the fine spun sophisms of dealers in <HI>remnants</HI> of law. As the causes of its existence and object of it formed a combination wholly new, so the act is itself without a precedent, and standing thus alone, is firmly supported by the voice of the people, by the inherent sovereignty of the state, and by a train of argument, well calculated to enforce its e∣quity and validity upon every unprejudiced mind.</P>
<P>THE very effects of the rescinding act, prove that the contents of the granting were weak; they also prove that the rescinding act possesses stamina of ex∣istence stronger and more durable than its enemies have been willing to allow it. This act contains in itself forcible reasons why it was made; it does not descend to all the reasons which might have been of∣fered —nor to any formal confutation of the argu∣ments against it; but as these arguments have been assiduously and in some instances successfully used at the northward, it may be proper to try the strength of them.</P>
<P>THE first is, <HI>This rescinding act is wholly unprece∣dented and unsupported by authorities, therefore good for nothing.</HI></P>
<P>I ACCEDE to the premises; but deny the conclu∣sion.—It is true that the British king did not rescind his patent to the earl of Warwick. Massachusetts did not rescind their grant of the Genessee country, nor Connecticut theirs of the Reserve. But suppose that either or all these sovereign powers had rescin∣ded their grants, before the lands were obtained by the grantees, what remedy would the grantees have had? As there is no precedent of the case, there can be no precedent of a remedy, and those who use this argument, have never proceeded so far as to suggest even a plausible remedy in the present case. But it
<PB N="97" REF="033425_0057_0FF74A70CCD362E0"/>so happens, there is no precedent of the fraud, col∣lusion, atrocious speculation and corruption, practised on a sovereign legislature, to render such an act ne∣cessary, and where a new case occurs, its merits must be tried by the rules of reason and common sense.</P>
<P>THE novelty of the case was created by the fraud of the companies, and it should not be in their power to draw arguments, from this very novelty, against the rescinding act.—The best, which can be said of this argument is, that the very terms of the premises wholly foreclose any conclusion in favor of or against the rescinding act.</P>
<P>THE second argument is, <HI>that however the rescind∣ing act might have operated, previous to any sales made by the companies: yet that it can have no effect on the northern purchasers; because they bought in open mar∣ket at a fair price, ignorant of the collusion.</HI> I have al∣ready suggested the effects which it has had, and the impracticability of remedy; but in direct answer to the argument, be it remarked, that if any right ex∣isted, it belonged to the sovereign people of Geor∣gia— that the collusion of representatives is not the collusion of the people, and that when those act be∣yond their delegated powers, their acts are voidable by the people. But when they, under the influence of bribes, agree to cheat their constituents and these bribes are given by the grantees, the contract be∣comes void on common law principles.</P>
<P><Q>As the king's grants proceed chiefly from his own bounty, and his letters patent are records of a high nature, they ought to contain the ut∣most truth and certainty, and have in all times been construed most favourably for the king contrary to the grants of common persons; and accordingly in a great variety of cases we find
<PB N="98" REF="033425_0058_0FF74A73E27E9CB8"/>incertainty, misrecitals, false suggestions, and all such matters as shew that the king was deceived in his grant, held such reasons as have been suf∣ficient to vitiate the grants.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plow. 333. Co. 44.6 Co. 55.7 Co. 12.8 Co. 56.2 Co 24.8 Co. 145. Hob. 224. Pollexf. 418.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>EQUITY will relieve a man against a contract, en∣tered into, when he was in a state of ebriety, pro∣vided he were drawn into such debauch by the ma∣nagement and contrivance of him, who gained the contract.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Powel on contracts, page 29.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN the first quotations regarding the sovereign people, as standing in the place of the king, and their representatives as the king's ministers—the cases will apply, and the granting act would be void, on common law principles. On the last quotation, let the fraud be compared to the debauch, and equity will declare the granting act void. An exception taken under this argument is, that the property is now in bona fide purchasers, who are not partakers in the fraud:—but this exception is never admitted where a grant, deed, or contract is null and void in itself.</P>
<P>THIS dark work of legislation partook too much of the Ethiopian huc, and the conduct of the compa∣nies too much of the Leopards spots, ever to bring a white and unspotted title, to the northern purchasers.</P>
<P>IN this case the state has, by a sovereign act, done no more, than what courts of law or equity would do in <HI>similar</HI> contracts between individuals.</P>
<P>THE third argument is, <HI>If the granting act was null and void in itself, there was no need of a rescinding act and that if it was not thus null and void, a rescinding act
<PB N="99" REF="033425_0059_0FF74A7D3AFA2500"/>could not make it so:—therefore that the validity of the granting act ought to have been tried by courts.</HI></P>
<P>IF Gunn and Co. had raised a military force, and with colours flying, drums beating, loaded artillery and all the imposing attitudes of hostile array, had procured this grant—and afterwards the state of Georgia had, by armed force, overpowered these in∣vaders—and the assembly had afterwards convened and rescinded the grant, and outlawed Gunn &amp; Co. would not all the world say they had done right— and that burning was good enough for an act thus obtained? All kings, all nations and sovereign states would do this, and the world would approve it; but their approbation would be founded on princi∣ples broader and more enlarged than are contempla∣ted in the books.</P>
<P>THE principles of the laws of nature and nations, including the laws of morality, take root deeper than the roots of society—the book decisions take root in a soil less deep than that of society—the sovereignty of the people is between them. Society is founded on first principles—Legislatures declare the opera∣tion of those principles—Courts apply these decla∣rations to all the variety of cases, which the weak∣ness and wickedness of man present for their deci∣sion. The sovereignty of the people never aliena∣ted to its servants the judges of courts a right to judge of impositions on that sovereignty.</P>
<P>OF extremes of fraud or force this sovereign peo∣ple will judge, lesser violations are left to courts.— Once adopt as a principle that in such cases, courts may decide over the heads of legislatures, and you disseize the people of all sovereignty and erect <HI>impe∣ria in imperiis</HI> without end.</P>
<P>THE confusion of leaving a question of this kind to courts would be endless. Without books or prin∣ciples
<PB N="100" REF="033425_0060_0FF74A8425A3D570"/>to form their decisions, and without power to enforce them, the claimants would be led into im∣mense expence without possible profit.</P>
<P>HAPPILY the question about the validity of the granting act has been decided by a power, from which there is no appeal; and the rescinding act has pub∣lished this decision in terms, liable to no miscon∣struction.</P>
<P>THE fourth argument is, <HI>That the rescinding act is an ex post facto law.</HI></P>
<P>ALL this doctrine about ex post facto laws, are re∣spects this case, is wholly irrelevant: for though it be law and reason, that no man shall be punished for the breach of a law passed after the commission of an act, and though no law of this description can alter the rights of individuals as respects each other: yet all this cannot apply to contracts between sovereign and subject; for in the first case parties exist which can be called into court and compelled to answer: here there is but one existing party—the other is be∣yond the power of the court. It created the court, and in this creation never imparted to it a power to control itself in legislative measures.</P>
<P>THE term <HI>ex post facto law</HI> was derived from the immorality and inexpediency of such laws: but it wholly loses its name, where it loses its application; that is, when the after law is both moral and expe∣dient, and when the power making the law is in ev∣ery respect uncontrolable.</P>
<P>THIS argument therefore is weak for two import∣ant reasons; one, that it cannot apply to the case: another, that if it might apply in theory, there is no court or power on earth, mighty enough to make the application in practice.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="033425_0061_0FF74A8D691CA498"/>
THE fifth argument is, <HI>That a grant is sacred and irreversible; therefore that the rescinding act cannot des∣troy the force of the granting act.</HI></P>
<P>IF the Georgia grant is sacred now, it would have been so, if the whole senate and house of representa∣tives and governor had been bribed and if the land had been sold for five dollars, instead of half a mill∣ion; but the fact is, nothing can make a grant <HI>sa∣cred,</HI> but the <HI>sacred integrity</HI> of the contracting par∣ties.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Truth and integrity being absolute requisites in contracts, fals∣hood and fraud render them positively void. <HI>See Hutchinson on law of nature.</HI></NOTE> Nothing can make a grant irreversible, but <HI>a want of power in both parties to reverse it.</HI> In the present case was no sympton of integrity, and one of the contracting parties, having <HI>abundant power</HI> for the purpose, has actually reversed it. Hence equity and power have been united in proving, to the con∣fusion of the Georgia companies and disappointment of the northern purchasers, that the granting act was neither sacred nor inviolable.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE the state had received for this land 800,000 dollars, the highest price offered, and the assembly had, without any corruption, or collusion, constitutionally, freely and with the full consent of their constituents, granted this land and had receiv∣ed full pay for it and had afterwards, on any pre∣tence, rescinded it and kept the money—all the world would have cried out <HI>shame!</HI> But what good would all this do to the suffering purchaser? What lawyer could point to him any mode of revesting him∣self with a sole exclusive right to buy these lands? Tis beyond the power of human invention.</P>
<P>IF in such case the state had owned the fee and pos∣session, and the individual had asserted and regained his right by force of arms—all the world might say,
<PB N="102" REF="033425_0062_0FF74A979CDAAC48"/>he had done well in opposing might to might, and in redressing an injury: But now in order to do this he must first violate the laws of nature and na∣tions by extirpating the right owners; and they must expatriate every principle of decency and hon∣esty, in attempting to vindicate by force, a claim founded in fraud and iniquity; for very different from the above case, in point of equity and morality, has been the conduct of the state of Georgia. By their rescinding act, while they have asserted the ma∣jesty of a sovereign people, they have exercised all the equity of an individual, by forgiving the wrong and offering to refund the money.</P>
<P>THE condition of <HI>statu quo</HI> proposed by this act, though generally recognised among all nations, as a <HI>desideratum</HI> between contending parties is not at all to the humor of these colluders. It severs them forever from the prospect of immense wealth with∣out labor, invention or honesty, which was the glo∣rious boon in prospect.</P>
<P>HAD the state confiscated the purchase money, for the treachery practised against the sovereign people, more might have been said; but they have honora∣bly offered it back to those who deposited it. Try them by the law of nations for this rescinding act and they will be honorably acquitted. Tried by the laws of nature, the state of Georgia would be ap∣proved.</P>
<P>FROM all the maxims, which regulate sovereign states, the claimants fly to courts of inferior jurisdic∣tion—courts highly respectable in their institution— highly capable of administering justice between man and man; but <HI>wholly inadequate,</HI> in delegated power, for a decision of this question; and in such courts, borrowing the mantles of more honest suitors, they practically avow their designs of plunder, and not content with having violated the principles of fair
<PB N="103" REF="033425_0063_0FF74AA5C970FA18"/>dealing in the first instance, would under the mask of law, <HI>pirate the world</HI> of the fair distinctions which sub∣sist between honest and dishonest applicants for jus∣tice.</P>
<P>CONTRACTS between kings and subjects, between sovereign states and individuals, stand on <HI>moral,</HI> not on legal principles.</P>
<P>THE high approbation, with which the rescinding act is now received by an impartial public, establishes its conformity to the laws of morality and of nature. If the advocates of this argument could have shewn that this grant was fairly and sacredly obtained, the public would have lamented that this sovereign pow∣er had been immorally exercised: but the absolute necessity that sovereign power should in all govern∣ments reside somewhere, has foreclosed all appeals in the present case.</P>
<P>THE sixth argument is, <HI>That the Indian right to part of the lands described in the granting act has been extinguished—therefore that the rescinding act could not at best reach the whole.</HI></P>
<P>To this my remarks on the nullity of sale (nei∣ther partly in possession) furnish a sufficient answer.</P>
<P>THE seventh argument is, <HI>That the companies are still possessed of the original deeds of Governor Matthews —therefore that the rescinding act, by destroying the re∣cords, cannot have destroyed the title.</HI></P>
<P>BUT deeds are only evidences of title, and like other evidences, they may speak truth or falshood —theirs in conveying the fee violate the truth.— Deeds may be good or bad—valid or void, accord∣ing
<PB N="104" REF="033425_0064_0FF74AB3B1DA40B8"/>to the power of the contracting parties, or the integrity and legality of their contracts. These deeds were given by a party, unable to contract: they were founded on fraud, and the subject of them was unconstitutional and illegal. Deeds create no fee-simple, nor any other quantity of estate in lands. The estate must first exist: but it did not exist in the present case. Your original deeds from the Go∣vernor can answer no other purpose, than as a stan∣ding memorial, that there was a time, when certain representatives of a free people were guilty of most abandoned treachery against their constituents, and when there was a class of men, capable of improving the basest of means for the vilest of ends:—but the rescinding act is to remain as an illustrious memori∣al of the everlasting abhorrence with which their treachery and your corruption are to be regarded by this and future generations.</P>
<P>THE foregoing and similar arguments have been proposed by the sellers in every form in order to give currency to a second edition of <HI>delusions,</HI> which may be truly said to be <HI>much enlarged</HI> by the authors. Every principle of law and equity has been put on the rack to compel a disclosure of something in favor of the granting act. The books and their conserva∣tors have been put in requisition. Cases have been nicely fashioned to the fancy of employers, and the mighty quotient has been <HI>that the rescinding act is good for nothing!</HI></P>
<P>AMIDST the preparations for hostility, some of the northern purchasers have been discomfited—some settlements have been effected; but even these have been magnified and multiplied, for the purpose of drawing others to accommodation. It was not e∣nough, that wretches were employed at the north∣ward
<PB N="105" REF="033425_0065_0FF74ABEB832CF70"/>under the mask of purchasers to draw in their neighbours; but pretences that these very impos∣tors have settled, have been since improved to draw those very neigbours to a settlement.</P>
<P>A THOROUGH detail of the frauds practised in the first, second and last stages of this business would be voluminous, and in the present case of no other use than to add a new chapter to the volume of argu∣ments which prove to what a depth of degradation the predominant lust of wealth is able to sink the character of man, and to what a boundless field of wickedness, those men are introduced who leave the path of morals and integrity, and abandon their duty as men and members of society.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The frauds practiced in the northern sales are within the knowl∣edge and proof of the companies or individuals on whom they were practised.</NOTE></P>

<P>CLEMENT LANIER, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> one of the representatives in the legislature of this state, who being duly sworn, on the holy Evangelist of Almighty God, deposeth and says, that during the last session of the legislature at Augusta, in the winter of the year 1794, he being a member of the house of representatives, and sitting on the same seat with Henry Gindrat, another of the members of that house, before the speaker took the chair, the said Gindrat recommended to him, to be in favour of selling of the western lands, for that he, said Gindrat understood it was worth our notice; for Mr. Thomas Wylly, a senator from Effingham county, had told the said Gindrat, that he, the said Wylly, could have eight or ten likely negroes for his part: And the deponent further saveth, that on the same day, in the afternoon, the said Thomas Wylly, came into the lobby of the house, and beck∣oned to the deponent, who followed him out, when a con∣versation commenced about the Yazoo act; at the same time, a Mr. Dennison, came by and asked what we were upon— the said Wylly answered, the land business; the said Den∣ison, then came up, and Wylly withdrew; the said Denni∣son, then told the deponent, that he did not pretend to advise any member to be in favor of selling the land, but those who were in favor of it, were handsomely provided for, and that if the deponent thought proper to be in favor of selling, that he should have part, and that the said Denison said he was a purchaser of such of the members parts, as had a mind to sell, but understood that some of the members pretended to ask eight and ten negroes for a share, or their shares; he said he could not give so much, but the deponent might depend he would purchase: The deponent further sayeth, that previous to any of the before recited circumstances, Mr. William Long∣street, one of the members of the said legislature, frequently called on the deponent, and asked him why he was not in fa∣vour of selling the western lands, who answered he did not think it right to sell to companies of speculators. The de∣ponent at this time wishing to make further discovery of the conduct of the members on that sale, and therefore affected to be inclined to come into the measure, and by that means kept up a conversation about it occasionally; that on the day the bill received its first reading, before the house was convened, the said Longstreet spoke to the deponent, to get his approbation to the sale. The deponent asked him to shew thm what security the members had of the purchasers, when the said Longstreet presented a certificate, entitling the bearer to two shares of twenty-five thousand acres each, sign∣ed
<PB N="107" REF="033425_0067_0FF74ACA71B7D820"/>by Nathaniel Pendleton, chairman. The deponent then told the said Longstreet, that that was not what he had for∣merly told him was a member's share; for that the said Long∣street, had before said, a member's share was seventy-five thousand acres. That the said Longstreet, then told the de∣ponent, if he would wait a few minutes, or an hour, he would bring him another certificate from Gunn's company, for the same number of acres. That the deponent in order to dis∣engage himself from the conversation, then said the security was not sufficient to entitle him to the land. That the said Longstreet then told the deponent, if he was not satisfied with the certificates, he would give him one thousand dol∣lars for it, or for them. The deponent then presented the certificates to the said Longstreet, and went into the house, which was the last interview he had on the subject. The deponent further sayeth, that the shares offered him as afore∣said, were expressly designed to induce him, the deponent, to vote for the bill for disposing of the western territory.</P>

<P>PETER L. VAN ALEN, being duly sworn, sayeth that about the 12th or 13th of January 1795, he was in compa∣ny with a Mr. Gindrat, who, the deponent understood was a member of the legislature, then lately adjourned, that in consequence of the advice of R. P. Sanders, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> another member of the same legislature, who advised the deponent to purchase some of the western lands, which the said legisla∣ture had sold, and in the purchase of which the deponent understood the said R. P. Sanders was interested, and from the information of the said Sanders, they could purchase be∣tween them two shares in Gunn's company, and to the best of the deponents recollection a share in Glascocks compa∣ny for a thousand dollars. That the said Gindrat, told the deponent, in a conversation upon that subject, that he should have his, the said Gindrat's share, for that sum, provided the money was paid by a certain time. That in consequence, the deponent went to exchange some governors warrants for money; and when he returned, Gindrat refused to let him have them; having as the deponent understood and believ∣ed, met with a better market. The deponent further say∣eth, that he believes, and then understood, that a certain quantity was allotted to each member in the majority, who were not to pay any money therefor in advance, but were particularly indulged until the whole purchase money was payable at the treasury, in consequence of their vote and
<PB N="108" REF="033425_0068_0FF74AD22DC57BC8"/>support of the law for selling the lands. The deponent fur∣ther sayeth, that R. P. Sanders, told the deponent, that he had made a contract with Lachlan M'Intosh, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who was, as the deponent understood, a member of the same general assembly, for all the shares that the said M'Intosh held in the different companies, for which he had contracted to give him eight negroes, fifty barrels rice, and a certain sum of money, which the deponent does not recollect: That this contract was made before the first bill had been negatived by the governor; but that a reservation being made in the se∣cond bill in favor of the citizens and the state, would deduct considerably from the quantity of land in each share. He, the said R. P. Sanders, objected to giving so much. The said M'Intosh, however urged the completing the contract. The said R. P. Sanders, further told the deponent, that the contract was broken off by reason of that deduction. The deponent further sayeth, that he was present in company with Lachlan M'Intosh, and others, when some one of the company, he thinks Mr. M'Intosh himself, said that he, the said M'Intosh, held six shares in the Georgia Missisippi com∣pany, which he offered at three hundred dollars premium each, and on the same day the deponent understood that he did sell them for a premium of two hundred and fifty dol∣lars each, to one of the grantees of that company.</P>

<P>Q. 2. Had you, or had you not, conversation with him on the subject of the sale of the western territory of this state, whilst that subject was in agitation, or before or after that time?</P>
<P>A. He had before, at, and after the passing the act.</P>
<P>Q. 3. Did he, or did he not tell you, or give you to under∣stand, that he held a share or shares in some one or more of the companies who purchased the lands; and did he, or did he not, make known to you that such share or shares, were giv∣en to him by the company or companies without being lia∣ble to pay any money therefor, and that his certificate differ∣ed from those given to persons out of the legislature in that respect?</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="033425_0070_0FF74AE070358D80"/>
A. After the passing of the act, he brought a considerable sum of money to my house, and asked me to take care of it. I believe it was two thousand dollars, on which I asked him, how he got it, or if he got it for his proportion of the land, or words to that effect. He said it is nothing to you, take care of it; and smiled.</P>
<P>Q. 4. Are you, or are you not, intimately acquainted with some one or more of the grantees of said companies; and have you not heard some one or more of them say, that the said Roberds Thomas, did receive a gratuitous certificate for a share or shares in the purchase, and that he would not be content with one in the usual form?</P>
<P>A. I am acquainted with the grantees of the companies; I never heard it from any of them.</P>
<P>Q. 5. Have you, or have you not, heard the said Roberds Thomas say, that he received any sum or sums of money from any of the companies, or any individual of those companies, either in consideration of his share or shares, or otherwise, for being in favor of the sale of the land; or have you not heard any member of either said companies declare, that the said Roberds Thomas did receive any sum or sums of money for or on account of such shares, or otherwise, from any of the members of the said companies, for that consideration?</P>
<P>A. I did not, but had my own opinion.</P>
<P>Q. 6. From every circumstance, which has come to your knowledge, do you, or do you not know or believe, that the said Roberds Thomas or any of the members of the last legis∣lature, were absolutely interested in the purchase of the wes∣tern lands, or did receive money or other things to induce them or him to vote for the sale thereof?</P>
<P>A. I do not know, but I suppose they were from general supposition.</P>
<P>Q. 7. Did you, or did you not, understand from the ques∣tion you put to Roberds Thomas, when he brought you the money, and the manner in which he answered it, that he had received the money for his vote in the legislature, or being in favor of the sale of the land?</P>
<P>A. I did suppose from a knowledge of Mr. Thomas's cir∣cumstances, that he could not have got that sum of money, unless it had been in that way either directly or indirectly.</P>
<P>Q. 8. Do you, or do you not, know the associates of the respective companies?</P>

The depo∣nent said he did not think it was right to sell the lands; but the said Longstreet told him if he would, he might make a fortune for himself and family forever, or words to that ef∣fect: The deponent said it would be injurious to the com∣munity, and it would be displeasing to our constituents to dispose of their rights. The said Longstreet then said it was no matter, that the deponent nor himself need not care, pro∣vided they could not get the land, whether they ever came there again, or words to that effect. That the deponent had a conversation with Philip Clayton, at the State-House, about the 23th of December 1794, concerning the lands, when said Clayton urged the deponent to go home. That the same evening, the said Clayton, called the deponent in∣to his office, and told the deponent, that provided that he would give him, the said Clayton, an order on the speaker for his warrant, which he said, by his calculation, was twen∣ty eight pounds, and go home immediately, and return no more, that he would give the deponent seventy pounds; the deponent answered, he had business up town, and re∣turned to him no more that night. A few evenings after∣wards, the said Clayton told the deponent, that he need not be angry with him, for that it was at the request of general Gunn, and he would pay the expense.</P>

That after the deponent found the land would be sold, he was desirous to get a part of it, and applied to Mr. Cox, one of the grantees in one company, to know if he could get a part; that Mr. Cox told the deponent he could not, for that all the shares were taken up; that he then ap∣plied to the said Reuben Wilkinson, to know if he could get him a part, who said he could, and did let the deponent have a share, which was in the name of the said Reuben Wilk∣inson, and was for about twenty-seven thousand acres, or thereabout, subject to a deduction. The deponent further sayeth, that he frequently heard Reuben Wilkinson say, af∣ter the legislature rose, that he should make a great deal of money by that measure. That during the sitting of the le∣gislature, Mr. Longstreet frequently urged the deponent to try to prevail on Mr. Shepherd, another member, to go home; the deponent said he could not influence Mr. Shepherd. The deponent understood and believed, that the said Long∣street wished to get Mr. Shepherd to go home, to prevent him voting against the sale of the lands. That he likewise had a conversation with Mr. Wilkinson, who also asked the deponent if Shepherd would not go home: The deponent answered he did not know; when Wilkinson replied, "By God, I wish he would." The deponent further sayeth, that before the assembly rose, and before the Governor signed the bill, he, the said Wilkinson, shewed the deponent two writ∣ten certificates, for four shares each, or for a certain number of acres, the deponent does not precisely recollect which, said certificate did not mention that any sum was to be paid for them—They were signed by Nathanial Pendleton, chairman, he believes. That afterwards, the said Wilkinson shewed the deponent two printed certificates from the Tennessee company; one from the Georgia company, for fifty six thou∣sand acres, signed James Gunn, Matthew M'Allister and George Walker, he believes; and two printed certificates from the Georgia Missisippi company. That the said Wil∣kinson informed the deponent, that the first two written cer∣tificates had been given up, and that he had received the last two printed ones in lieu thereof.</P>

<P>CAPT. ROBERT RAINES deposes, that during the ses∣sion of the last legislature and previous to the passing of the act, Philip Clayton, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> treasurer of the state, called on the deponent, and informed him, if you could prevail on Mr. Mitchell, a member of the senate in that legislature, and the brother in law of this deponent to go home, he the deponent might have five hundred dollars, pounds or guineas, this de∣ponent does not remember which, and any appointment from the legislature he would ask, which was in their power to give. The said Clayton observed at the same time, that as the deponent was the brother of Mr. Mitchell, he thought he might have influence enough with him to prevail on him to go home, as the act would be passed whether he went home or not; to which the deponent made some slight reply.—And the said Clayton then said, he hoped the deponent would not think any thing of him, for he was authorised to say what he had. And this deponent further saith, that some time on or about the first of August last, he was in Augusta, and saw Richard Worsham, a member of the last legislature there, who had a share in the Georgia company, commonly called Gunn's company, and was offering the same for sale to Mr. Maher; that this deponent also saw Reuben Wilkinson, a member of the last legislature, in Au∣gusta, at the same time, who informed this deponent he had shares in the purchase of the western lands, and that he wish∣ed to sell them.</P>

<P>WILLIAM SALLARD, of the county of Hancock, be∣ing duly sworn, maketh oath, that on or about the 22d, 23d, or 24, days of January, 1795, he the deponent was at Augus∣ta, procuring some articles, and disposing of some tobacco, and that during the said term he was at general Glasscock's, one of the grantees of the western territory; that a conver∣sation took place between the general and himself, relative to it and concerning Roberds Thomas▪ (the senator in the legis∣lature, which disposed of it) for the said county of Hancock, that the general asked the deponent what the people of Han∣cock thought of Thomas and if they would kill him; the deponent replied he did not know they would kill him but that he stood a great chance of hugging a sapling, or words to that effect, for they had an idea Thomas was bribed: The general replied that he did not know that he was bribed, but that he had a good deal of the land; that he himself had pur∣chased some of the shares, and had paid himself, with a Mr. Nightingale, to Thomas, 1700 dollars to the best of the de∣ponent's recollection, and 400 dollars to John Thomas as he believes, Roberds Thomas's brother, for the land; that the general further said, the other companies he expected had al∣so paid the said Roberds Thomas as much money, for lands or shares, as he had paid; that he yesterday in his way down, met with John Thomas, the said Roberds Thomas's brother, who acknowledged to the deponent, that he had received money from general Glascock.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>Signed,</HI> WILLIAM SALLARD. <HI>Proved as before.</HI></SIGNED><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From these depositions, it appears that the companies well under∣stood that indirect bribery was more decent and successful than direct bribery—that a settled plan was laid and carried into effect, to interest as many of the members (as might be) in the companies shares—that some were to have shares and to pay for them, relying on the certain advantage of buying at the rate of <HI>500,000</HI> dollars the sum proposed, instead of <HI>800,000</HI> dollars (the sum which might have been had.) These, however, were to have assurances of <HI>certain</HI> profit.

<HEAD>In the House of Representatives, Friday the 15th of Jan∣uary, 1796.</HEAD>
<P>These petitions and the doings of the convention were read, whereupon a committee, consisting of nine respectable members were named, of which Gen. Jackson, the present governor of that state was chairman.—The committee de∣voted their attention faithfully to the subject and on the 21st of the same month reported, that they had taken the same un∣der their serious consideration, and <Q>lament that they are compelled to declare, that the <HI>fraud,</HI> corruption and collu∣sion

It appears to your com∣mittee that public good was placed entirely out of view and private interest alone consulted, that the rights of the present generation were violated, and the rights of poster∣ity bartered by the said act: That by it the mounds of e∣qual rights were broken down, and the principles of aris∣tocracy established in their stead.</Q></P>
<Q><P>The committee whilst they thus with shame and confu∣sion, acknowledge that such a legislature, intrusted with the rights of their constituents should have existed in Georgia, cannot however forbear to congratulate the pres∣ent legislature and community at large that there are suffi∣cient grounds, as well with respect to the unconstitution∣ality of the act, as from the testimony before the committee of the fraud practised to obtain it, to pronounce that the same is a nullity of itself and not binding or obligatory on the people of this state, and they flatter themselves, that a declaration to that purport, by a legislative act, will check that rapacious and avaricious spirit of speculation, which has in this state, overleaped all decent bounds, and which if it were to continue, would totally annihilate morality and good faith from among the citizens of the state.</P>

THE depositions here presented need no other commentary, than the <HI>able and practical</HI> one made on them by the rescinding act. I have endeavoured to notice summarily the arguments against this act in one or another part of these numbers. They have been of every description. Whatever could opiate the reflections or brighten the prospects of the Georgia sellers has been improved; but no one has met the rescinding act at the point, where it concentres all its strength; which is in THE SOVEREIGNTY OF AN IN∣DEPENDENT STATE. This stands above all the ar∣guments opposed to it, and will continue so to do, till some one will find a power mighty enough to control it.</P>
<P>THE rescinding act of the United States, in respect to their promise to pay Spanish milled dollars for continental bills, and the acts of the several states, which rescinded their plighted faith for the payment of their notes and bills, were never called in question; although these acts involved property to the amount of millions, and affected subjects, whose meritorious services and honest earnings of the bills or notes were never doubted. This rescinding resulted from the necessity of the case, and became irresistible BY REA∣SON OF THE VERY SOVEREIGNTY, WHICH PASSED IT. But now, where necessity and equity were com∣bined with this sovereignty, a rescinding act must be∣come instantly void—because <HI>purchasers of members rights</HI> are in danger of suffering. The first rescinding acts contemplated bills, purporting to be equal to Spanish dollars. The last operated on deeds pur∣porting to convey fee simples. The bills and the deeds were equally deceitful: yet the sufferer by the first is left to lament that he trusted to a power beyond his control; while the <HI>purchasers of members rights</HI> are to bid defiance to the power which has already crush∣ed them.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="033425_0082_0FF74B3AD30DEA18"/>
THIS vain gasconading, these nice distinctions re∣sult not from reason and nature; not from prece∣dents and principles; but from judgments perverted by money and from the miserable items of a fee-table.</P>
<P>NOT being so well versed in the indexes of law books as the opposers of the rescinding act, I beg leave to close this number with a fable, the due ap∣plication of which will render further discussion of the merits of this act unnecessary.</P>
<P><HI>ONCE on a time, a lion and a fox entered into a treaty of mutual convenants; but the fox had craftily drawn the lion into articles, wholly foreign from the object of the trea∣ty, and very inconvenient for the lion to perform. The lion discovering the treachery determined on redress when a fair opportunity should present. Soon after, Reynard took the liberty of breaking a very essential article; upon which the lion, without ceremony, put him to death.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THE foxes assembled and complaining bitterly of cruelty and tyranny, determined,</HI> 1st. <HI>That the lion had no right to put Reynard to death.</HI> 2d. <HI>That the question about the breach of treaty ought to have been tried by a court of foxes. And</HI> 3d. <HI>That as the lion had no right to kill Reynard, and as the question ought to have been tried, therefore</HI> Reynard was not dead. <HI>Able counsellors were named to make out the case, and report their opinion. After much consultation they reported as follows:</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1st. <HI>SUPPOSE Reynard was now alive—and suppose a lion was no stronger than a fox—then he could not kill a fox; therefore</HI> Reynard is still alive.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. <HI>SUPPOSE a lion never before killed a fox for breach of treaty; then the lion had nothing to justify him in doing it; therefore he has not done it, and therefore</HI> Reynard is still alive.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. <HI>As Reynard had, after making the treaty, lived for a considerable time—and as his breath had vested in
<PB N="123" REF="033425_0083_0FF74B41E0B667A8"/>him; therefore the lion could not take it away and there∣fore</HI> Reynard is certainly alive. <HI>All which was hum∣bly submitted.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>As the burden of the business was</HI> Reynard's alive, <HI>and as the whole assembly of foxes wished to believe it, the report was unanimously adopted; and the counsellors were re-appointed to devise and report ways and means for carrying this judgment into effect.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THIS was an arduous task; but they at length reported that as this lion was very powerful aad lawless, it would be best to wait for his decease, and perhaps his successor might be as small and weak as a mouse.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To this it was objected, that as the life of a fox was far short of that of a lion, the present generation would not have the honor of carrying their judgment into effect. They therefore appointed a committee to wait on the lion with a copy of their judgment and to demand his assent to their propositions. This being delivered, the monarch of the forest replied—</HI> <Q><HI>Your reasoning may be very good; if you will appoint one of your number to enforce it upon me, I will receive him in the anti-chamber where your Reynard-alive is deposited; and further tell your as∣sembly, that when foxes deal with lions they must deal with good faith.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>THAT</HI> Reynard was actually dead <HI>had been a sore thing at the bottom of all their measures: but good reasoning had hitherto kept them up. Now this severe answer returned to the company produced a sadness, which led to the following humbling resolves:</HI></P>

<HEAD>Georgia Speculation Unveiled. <HI>CONCLUSION.</HI> ADDRESSED TO THE NORTHERN PURCHASERS.</HEAD>
<P>IN these numbers I have endeavoured to combine, in a narrow compass, a variety of considerations, calculated to present this subject to you as wholly dif∣ferent from all others. My aim has been to unite you in a belief that you have obtained nothing for your money or your notes. Such an union would lead to a combination of measures for your relief wholly irresistible.</P>
<P>BEFORE I pledge my confidence in such a combi∣nation, it may be prudent to consider the different classes of men who are to unite—the obstacles to this union—and to sum up the real strength of this sub∣ject.</P>
<P>THE first class is of those, who placed implicit con∣fidence in all the stories of the sellers—who had amu∣sed themselves with the delicious idea of immense wealth—and had anticipated the splendor of fortune. It is hard for these to unbelieve—to renounce their idol—to part with their phantom—to reflect that they have been duped.</P>
<P>OF a second class are a few, who have paid little attention to this subject; who have a general idea, that states cannot rescind their grants; who have
<PB N="125" REF="033425_0085_0FF74B6E704A5DA0"/>advanced but little money; who have heard much profane abuse against Jackson and his party and have been willing to receive it as argument.</P>
<P>OF a third class are some, who partly assisted by the sellers and partly by their own hopes have made up a sort of system about this business, out of very mixt ingredients—and after very liberal abatements of the fraud—very high conceptions of the sacred nature of a grant—some suggestions that the rescind∣ing act will be rescinded and that if it is not, why it is no great matter, they believe it will all come out right in the end.</P>
<P>OF a fourth class are a few, who have no opinion of their own; who ask every man they meet, what he thinks of the Georgia business; who tremble at the shaking of a leaf; who feel some resentment at the fraud; but dare not utter it—lest these lion-like <HI>pur∣chasers of members rights</HI> should eat them up; but who are willing to have a stout defence made in their cau∣ses, if they can only keep clear of the bustle.</P>
<P>THE fifth and most numerous class is of those, who feel indignant at the swindling and fraud practised in the sales; who feel practically that the rescinding act is fatal to their claim: who are willing to receive every rational proposition in favor of a defence in their causes—and to unite in measures well adapted for that end.</P>
<P>BUT in the sheeps-cloathing of sufferers are some who are hand and glove with the sellers, who (though apparent purchasers) never paid a farthing; but who are receiving commissions and rewards for their services—and another class not much better, who partly bought and partly did not buy—have partly paid and partly not—who are in habits of friendship with the insidious sellers, and who by fawning and sycophancy expect to make fair weather. Such, though they differ much in character from the harm∣less
<PB N="126" REF="033425_0086_0FF74B7637BC43C8"/>animal who licks the hand, just raised to shed his blood, will meet a similar fate. There is no depen∣dence on men, who have passed the bounds of mo∣rality, truth and honesty. They who depend on them lean on <HI>the staff of a bruised reed</HI> that will surely pierce them.</P>
<P>THE first class of obstacles to a union is, the policy of the sellers to <HI>divide and conquer.</HI> They have sep∣arated companies, and have thus rendered them less formidable.</P>
<P>THE second is, that, <HI>what is every body's business is nobody's.</HI> Almost every one neglects attention to this subject, calculating that his single exertions will not avail on a question of this magnitude.</P>
<P>THE third is, <HI>the artful impositions of the sellers and their confederates.</HI></P>
<P>THEY tell you, that the legislature of 1795, was uniformly respectable; and that of 1796, was con∣temptible—that the people of influence in Georgia despise the rescinding act—that Gen. Jackson is the mainspring of motion, and that whenever he retires, the granting act will be restored. But they careful∣ly conceal from you the measures taken to get members into the first legislature, who might be bri∣bed. They do not tell you that the offer of 800,000 dollars was a bona fide offer. They say nothing a∣bout the armed force, which came to the legislature to prevent the passing of the granting act, and that these were not dispersed, till assurances were given, that if the act should pass, it should be rescinded. They do not tell you, that after the act passed, the people were astonished to find the companies compo∣sed of some of the most influential men in the state—nor do they tell you, that most of these men denied any knowledge of their names being improved, and indignantly refused to have any connection with the business: nor do they tell you, that on this discov∣ery,
<PB N="127" REF="033425_0087_0FF74B835BE2AFE8"/>there was a general burst of indignation from among the people against the granting act—that the indignation of the constituents of ROBERDS THOMAS was not confined to making him hug a sapling, ac∣cording to the last deposition; but that <HI>they put him to death.</HI> They do not tell you, that all the news∣papers, published in the state, expressed unequivocally this indignation. They say nothing of the doings of the convention in May 1795; nor of the general preparations of the people of the state for the rescin∣ding of the grant. They cautiously conceal their own exertions to counteract the spirit of the people by at∣tempting a re-election of the members in favor of the granting act—their conviction, that they could not procure more than <HI>five</HI> to their purpose; the fact that they got but <HI>three;</HI> their coming to the north∣ward and effecting their sales, <HI>while knowing all these things.</HI></P>
<P>YET testimony of these things is now in our posses∣sion, and would be published, were they not reserved to be presented to the public in the trial of pending causes.</P>
<P>As to the character of the two legislatures, it is unquestionably true, that the characters of Mr. Watkins and some others in favor of the granting act are respectable; but no amount of individual character can wash away the stain, which the rescind∣ing act has indelibly fixed on the legislature of 1795.</P>
<P>As to GOV. JACKSON, that he is a man of genius, resources and patriotism, and that he resigned an em∣inent rank in the federal legislature, to interest him∣self against the obnoxious act is true, and that he had influence in effecting it is equally true. But among the other names in favor of this rescinding act are also others of genius, resoures and patriotism.</P>
<P>IT is beyond a question that the body of the peo∣ple approve the rescinding act; else why are all the
<PB N="128" REF="033425_0088_0FF68282FAB96E98"/>Yazoo men, as they are termed, peaceably turned out of office? Why are the legislative, judicial and executive offices of the state filled with the advocates of the rescinding act? Why has the same legislature been continued? Are we to be told in one breath that Gen. Jackson has no influence except among a miserable rabble? And in the next that his influence over all the departments of government is uncontrol∣able and wholly irresistible, and that when he is out of the way, the great men, the rich men, and the mighty captains will dare to shew their heads? <HI>These are miserable cobweb deceits.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the real merits of this subject, men are drawn by interest and credulity to numerous chime∣ras—each of which, after serving its purpose of de∣lusion, will leave them. They are told that the lands are now worth more than they cost. Who tells this? <HI>The sellers.</HI> Why then do not the sellers give practi∣cal proof of this declaration by taking back the lands? They say they are not able; but the truth is that they would rather pursue you, through all the laby∣rinths of law, <HI>for a single cent per acre,</HI> than take back the lands. They are now rending together the rem∣nants of their shattered fortunes to pay immense charges in prosecuting for the recovery of some notes, which, if wholly undisputed, would not bring 5<ABBR><HI>s</HI></ABBR> in the pound. They are telling that the granting act is good. Any man, who really believed this, would take back the lands; for, the granting act being good, and the lands worth what they declared them to be, they are worth as much now and be they worth ever so little are worth more than their notes in suit, by the certain difference of all the cost and charge of sustaining the suits.</P>
<P>MIND not their <HI>words,</HI> but look at their <HI>actions.</HI> When they tell you that others have settled and paid in full, deny it; for there are ten chances to one that
<PB N="129" REF="033425_0089_0FF74B9471EF4F58"/>what you would understand by a settlement has not been made. Some who were most powerfully under the influence of their delusions have paid in full; that number is small. Others, fearing the expenses of law, have compromised and paid 5 per cent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Sales to the amount of 70,000 dollars in the Georgia Missisippi Co. have been vacated and the notes given up, <HI>on payment of</HI> 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> by the purchasers, and other negociations are making to the same purport.</NOTE> The great body of the purchasers will never pay.</P>
<P>BUT the fourth obstacle is, <HI>The books, and the o∣pinions of Lawyers.</HI></P>
<P>My ideas on the application of books to this subject have been already expressed—and as to Lawyers o∣pinions, you may have observed, that men, who have such causes to advocate as those of the Georgia sel∣lers, generally employ a great number of Lawyers. They wish to monopolize the possession. Hence you are in the way of hearing a great deal of law and a multitude of opinions, better calculated (I trust) to alarm than to convince you. <HI>Such are the following.</HI> That you must certainly pay the scrip notes and as to negotiable notes there can be no question about them, all the decisions are that way, and to this point they will refer you to the following cases, (Dyer 300. Hob. 62. Sid. 365. Lutw. 238. 2 Mod. 62. Carth. 413. Salk. 622. pl. 1. Comb. 443. <HI>Giles</HI> v. <HI>Hart.</HI> 3 Salk. 353. Ld. Raym. 254. S. C.) I have not been particular to see whether any of the books or pages quoted have even a specious reference to the cases in question. That they apply as well as any other books or cases I have no doubt. The fact is, that the books, as they are called (meaning reports of cases, between Aplin and Booth, and Steel and Mason, &amp;c.) are not mighty enough to decide a ques∣tion depending solely on the law of nature and na∣tions.
<PB N="130" REF="033425_0090_0FF74B9B716994F8"/>The writers of such books never conceived of a pre-emptive right, and never heard of a sove∣reign independent state rescinding an act. Any at∣torney's clerk may find authorities enough about FEE and GRANT and OUSTER and DISSEISIN and what the judges of Westminster-Hall have said about landed tenures; but what these have to do with a legislative act of a sovereign state, impowering their governor, contrary to constitution, to convey the <HI>fee-simple</HI> right of the state, to buy land of the right ow∣ners, is beyond my conception.</P>
<P>THE real essential difference between this subject in every point of view and all the subjects in those books, distances all application.</P>
<P>THE introduction of English books into our prac∣tice is much like our own introduction into this coun∣try. In that country an enormous national debt, an expensive army and navy, extravagant schemes of foreign murder and ambition, and an incalculable civil list, "dragging its slow length along," through the crooked paths of secret service money, sinecures and all the items of abandoned expence, rendered it necessary for the government to command and en∣gross the coin and to set up the idol paper in its stead. This policy rendered it necessary to protect and sup∣port the paper, and this necessity, originating with bank-bills, government securities and company stocks, at length extended its jaws to private notes, bills and bonds and the whole became fast bound in an imperious, unseen and irresistible policy. The king's judges were constrained to bend the whole practice of law, within these limits, to this policy. Hence come negotiable notes. Hence the nice subtlety, that fraud and want of consideration shall not be pleadable against notes. Hence the expedi∣ent of turning men round to the chancery side of
<PB N="131" REF="033425_0091_0FF74BA1C0B32748"/>courts for manifest justice, or obliging them to pay their notes and sue for the fraud.</P>
<P>THOUGH our system of landed tenures and our whole policy was widely variant from that of Eng∣land; yet the indroduction of all these subtleties was well enough. It saved us from the trouble of erect∣ing a system of common law on common reason and our own circumstances—it loaded our libraries with English books—kept us <HI>piously</HI> in mind of our moth∣er country—and increased the glorious uncertainty of the law. While it always furnished one side with abundance of precedents, it afforded the other a no∣ble occasion of shewing that the precedents did not apply. And thus, however barren of incident a cause might be; yet our juries, sworn to judge accor∣ding to the evidence given them in court and the <HI>laws of the state</HI> have seldom failed to be amused by the authorities; and jury-rooms have resounded more with discussions about the comparative merit of the cases cited from the books, than of the case which they had solemnly engaged to decide.</P>
<P>ALL this was well enough, and if any of those books declare, that <HI>notes originating out of Missisippi script or negotiable notes for the fee of land which does not exist, or of pre-emption good for nothing, or for both un∣der a rescinded grant</HI> shall be recovered; or if any case can be found, justifying such a conclusion, I will freely give up the question. But the impossibility of any fair application has been sufficiently discussed.</P>
<P>I ONLY add that a note is evidence of indebtedness and like other evidences may be deceitful. A note may have been signed or not signed by the person whose name is subscribed to it—it may have been give under duress; and if it has been obtained by extreme force or fraud, or if the consideration has wholly and manifestly failed, in innumerable instances the books will shew that negotiable bonds, bills, &amp;c.
<PB N="132" REF="033425_0092_0FF74BAA639EE198"/>have been avoided, both at law and in chancery. If then the bare existence of a note is not conclusive a∣gainst the maker or endorser, your lawyers can form you a defence, combining more strength, than can be found in the books.</P>
<P>LAWYERS from their habits of thinking, of com∣bining facts and arguments, and of public discussion, are well able to raise a system upon this unpreceden∣ted subject; but meerly as lawyers, understanding the books, they are no more competent to manage these causes, <HI>than a mason is competent to repair the ru∣ins of the fall or a surgeon to amputate a tree.</HI> But if they feel confidence in their books, let them prove by them the right of their clients to sell the see of these lands—let them storm in front the sovereignty of the state of Georgia—and batter down the ever∣lasting rights of the natives to the premises;—then shall we have an argument worth a fee.</P>
<P>BUT instead of this we have cases made out of suppositions; such as, <HI>suppose the fee of the lands be∣longed to the state, and suppose the state honestly sold it,</HI> why then the following cases will apply.</P>
<P>(Comb. 403. Ld. Raym. 154. 2 Salk. 676. pl. 3. Carth. 411. Trygarn v. Fletcher.) <HI>Well suppose they did not own the fee, and suppose there was fraud in obtaining the granting act, why then the following cases will be relevant.</HI></P>
<P>(Hard. 336. 2 Lev. 194. And. 307. Cro. Eliz. 352. Rol. Abr. 939. Dowse v. Jeffries.)</P>
<P><HI>WELL, suppose the state has rescinded the grant: the following cases will shew that they had no right to do it;</HI></P>
<P>Noy 5. Show. 321. S. C. cited. Lit. Rep. 190. Everard v. Herne. Cro. Car. 551. March 95. <HI>Therefore the granting act is good, or at all events the question whether it is good or not must be tried by courts.</HI></P>

<HI>THE purchasers must enter upon the land or preemp∣tive right or parchment or whatever they have got, more or less, and must be ousted and disseised by the Creek na∣tion, or whatever nation is on it; or they must oust and disseize the natives—peaceably, if it can be done, other∣wise with a strong hand, or something must be done.</HI></P>

<P>I CALCULATE that such arguments will be used, till the money which you have advanced, shall be expended, and then will be an end of the bub∣ble.
<PB N="134" REF="033425_0094_0FF74BBBB9F59DB0"/>The men, who are spinning such fine argu∣ments, would be ready to assist you <HI>without reward</HI> in extinguishing a fire which was consuming your dwellings; but in a calamity more afflicting to ma∣ny of you in point of property, their profession has set them against you, I will do them all the justice to believe that they heartily wish a more respectable field for the exercise of their talents. No man is so poor and humble as to be unable to wound and injure his fellow-men. No elevation in life, profes∣sion, talents nor rewards can justify a man for abet∣ting a wrong. The advocate, who exerts himself to defend a felon from the punishment of death, acts consistently with the merciful spirit of the penal code; but he who, in any way, assists a felon to de∣fraud his neighbours—violates the principles of good faith—tears the ligaments of social intercourse, and tho' he may be treasuring up money against the day of want, is treasuring up crime against the day of retribution.</P>
<P>THO' I should press moral considerations into hard service, were I to address them to the men who have defrauded you▪ yet they are fairly applied to that class of men, on whose exertions they rely for the eventual success of their unprincipled projections.</P>
<P>BUT opposed to every obstacle, stands the real strength of your cause. In the first pamphlet having suggested the different considerations, composing this subject and in this having discussed those, which were most important, I now proceed to present you the following general conclusions-</P>
<P N="1">1st. BY the Georgia deeds, by your own deeds, by the pamphlets and by the declarations of the sellers, you had a right to believe that you had bought the FEE of the lands in question. This was what you bar∣gained
<PB N="135" REF="033425_0095_0FF682896F2703B0"/>for, and what you are entitled to have; for this only have your monies been paid and your notes been given: You are not obliged to accept any sub∣stitute: If the fee has failed, the whole consideration of the bargains has failed: The bargains are wholly void, and courts of chancery will compel the holders to give up your notes and refund your money, or courts of law, exercising concurrent powers, will af∣ford you equal relief.</P>
<P>I HAVE now left the field, where books and the power of courts cannot reach; but though the books cannot furnish nor confute your premises, they af∣ford abundant application, as soon as your notes, founded on those premises, are within the cogni∣zance of courts.</P>
<P>BUT the fee has <HI>wholly failed.</HI> It is not sustained by the law of nature—by the principles of our landed tenures—by any precedent, nor by the policy of the United States; but Congress has denied the exist∣ence of a fee in a similar case. The Indians, by the very shewing of the State of Facts, own rightfully every thing about the lands, which constitutes a fee; and the sovereign people of Georgia do not now pre∣tend that they ever owned the <HI>fee:</HI> and there is no person, who undertakes to quote any time, at which this fee vested in Georgia, or any source from which they could have derived it. Every argument on the subject of the fee is decidedly in favor of the natives, who possess it.</P>
<P>IT is fair therefore to conclude that you have wholly failed of that which was the subject of your bargains, and the consideration of your notes; which conclusion will justify the relief before proposed.</P>
<P>THIS selling of a fee, which did not exist, is a fraud of sufficient magnitude to exonerate you from payment, and the proof that it was thus sold, and that it did not exist in the sellers, is within the reach of
<PB N="136" REF="033425_0096_0FF74BCCD692D6D0"/>every one of you. The sellers adroitly calculated, (as satan did when he proposed the comeliness of the fruit) that the word <HI>fee</HI> would be alluring to purcha∣sers, and therefore inserted it, computing that when that failed, a decent substitute would be preferred to a breaking up of their bargains; but they relied too much on their success in the first delusions, and little imagined that the spirit of an independent people would reduce a <HI>majority</HI> to the number of <HI>three</HI> and that the act would be rescinded with marks of detes∣tation.</P>
<P>THE plausible right of pre-emption was intended as a substitute, and this to the northern purchasers was not without its comeliness; the argument that the companies sold in Georgia, and bought of, and sold to each other, takes nothing from the imputa∣tion. This was all done with an eye to the event, which was to sell again.</P>
<P N="2">2d. THIS PRE-EMPTION, (as it is termed) turns out to be the most delusive of all shadows; as unlike to a <HI>fee</HI> and as miserable a substitute as could be con∣ceived of. After exploring every resource, we at length find, that a right to purchase lands of the na∣tives is absolutely involved in a right to hold a treaty with the natives, which right can alone be acquired from the President of the union—that the United States are under no express nor implicit obligation to grant it to a state or to any individual company, in preference to another—that they have never granted it, for the purpose of purchase, except when the Indians were disposed to sell—that the native possessors of these lands are never likely to consent to sell; for the principal nation among them are <HI>very averse to part∣ing with their lands.</HI></P>
<P>WE therefore find, that we never had any thing more by our deeds, than a fractional part of the declaration of the representatives of Georgia, that
<PB N="137" REF="033425_0097_0FF74BD3D8552810"/>they would not apply for this right to hold a treaty— which state of Georgia was the least likely of any in the union to obtain such a permission—and we find that we could never avail ourselves of this declaration in any other way, than by application to the presi∣dent (if a proper time should ever arrive) stating as a ground of superior merit, that we had bought this declaration. This time would not probably arrive, till the lapse of many ages, and if any of our poster∣ity should state to congress that their ancestors had been dupes to a set of speculators, I trust it would not reflect much honor on us or them.</P>
<P>TIS true that this permission to hold treaty has been sometimes granted to the releasees of a state; but if our right of pre-emption, our <HI>substitute for a fee-simple,</HI> is reduced to the pitiful chance of being THE MOST MERITORIOUS BEGGARS FOR A RIGHT TO CHEAT INDIANS, it must be declared a most delu∣sive substitute, and if any thing more can be made of it, it must be done by men more capable than I am of discerning its merits.</P>
<P N="3">3d. BUT this negative, worthless declaration of the state of Georgia, <HI>which the breath of a southern slave might have blown into its original nothingness,</HI> has been crushed by a power mighty enough to have annihila∣ted a fee-simple, combined with an absolute right to deforce the occupants. The rescinding act presents a system of fraud in the companies, which would been fatal to any claim of whatever nature or description. Call it a fee and exclude the fraud, and the contract has been shewn to be void on principles of common law; but introduce the fraud, which is the principal argument in the act itself, and a new and conclusive defence in your favor is derived from this fraud.</P>
<P>THAT the very men, of whom you purchased were guilty of this fraud, is proved by a cloud of witnes∣ses.
<PB N="138" REF="033425_0098_0FF74BDD3B6863A8"/>Nearly the whole legislature of 1796, acting without any bias of private interest in a high respon∣sible capacity, have, by a public and solemn act, de∣clared their belief in this testimony—and the sove∣reign people, year after year, are bearing public tes∣timony of the integrity of their legislators in this transaction.</P>
<P>FRAUD cannot be more conclusively proved, and this fraud has been practised by the very men, who are pursuing you for payment of your notes. Can a stronger case be laid before a court?</P>
<P>WHEN these frauds are thoroughly known to our courts, the books and the authorities will be of as little avail to the counsel, as the rocks and the moun∣tains will be to their clients in another day.</P>
<P>THE distinction, which I have taken, between that part of this subject, where the books cannot apply— and that part, where they may apply, is precisely this. The subject matter of the granting act and the companies deeds—the means of obtaining the act—the sovereignty of an independent state—the re∣lation of such a state to the federal union—the influ∣ence of the policy of the union on the measures of the separate states—the rescinding act, with its pow∣er and consequences, are all either unprecedented or unparalled, and could not have been treated of in the books; and as all these depend on a system of prin∣ciples, coeval only with our existence as a nation, it is impossible that the principles in the books should be able to furnish or combat the principles on which your cause is sustained.</P>
<P>FRAUD of the first magnitude has been conceived, brought forth, matured and stands confest before the court, at the very point of these causes, where the books can be consistently opened—and opened at this point, the authorities both at law and in chan∣cery are conclusively in your favor. At my request
<PB N="139" REF="033425_0099_0FF74BE850E66E68"/>they have been examined and if it was in my pro∣vince to introduce them, they should be pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ted in this place: But in the present situation of the causes pending and to be commenced, I confine myself to remarking on the law-side of this question—<HI>that your script notes, your negotiable notes, your securities of what∣ever description for these lands, whatever may be the form of your conveyances stand on the same footing as counterfeit bank bills.</HI> There never yet was a question, whether a counterfeit bill, passing through ever so many hands, should or should not cease to be counterfeit. Can there be any more question about negotiable notes for Missisippi script which begun in fraud, con∣tinued by artifice and ended in nothing? Did ever the holder of a counterfeit bill recover the amount from the bank and turn it round to the wretch, who first passed it? Will it answer for the holder to say that he exchanged silver for it? No! The reply of the bank is, <HI>we received nothing for it.</HI></P>
<P>As a bill must be originally good, so must a nego∣tiable note be good, and if it fail in any of the <HI>requi∣sites</HI> of a good note, in the first instance, that failure is not helped by its passing from hand to hand. This remark is true in a qualified sense—that is, a note must be legally signed by the maker or endors∣er, and this not under any fear of bodily harm. It must be legally the act and deed of the maker or en∣dorser. These are absolute requisites and the want of them cannot be supplied by any change of owners.</P>
<P>So a note, which, through fraud or any other cause, might have been avoided, had the suit been in the name of the party to the fraud, is not made good, by its having been passed from hand to hand, <HI>when that very passing was done for the express purpose of aid∣ing a recovery</HI>—which is precisely true and proveable respecting a great number and perhaps all the notes of this description.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="033425_0100_0FF74BF0165A7D08"/>
FROM the general knowledge of this fraud which has now obtained and of the notes which have issued from this corrupt original, the presumption is very strong, that no man would receive these as he would mercantile notes—and any circumstance, shewing that in the passing of the note, passed any agreement (either express or implied) to resund, in case a recov∣ery should be barred on account of the base origin of the note, the holder, however distant from the en∣dorser or deceiver, would fail of recovery; and this on the fairest principles of common law. The means of defence on these and all the other notes have been presented in the frauds, discoverable in an attempt to sell the fee—in the total failure of the substitute and in the necessity of a rescinding act—add to these the auxiliary considerations, suggested in these numbers, add to these your own exertions, and to all, the inge∣nuity of your counsel—and courts of law will sustain you.</P>
<P>ON the equity side of this question, I confine my∣self to presenting you the following authorities, not as reaching the extent of your case; but as shewing the principles and practice of chancery courts on sub∣jects of fraud, <HI>far less aggravated,</HI> than what you have to plead for your relief.</P>

<HEAD>STENT VS BAILIS. (See Peere Williams, 2d. Vol. page 218.)</HEAD>
<P>THIS was a bill to be relieved against a contract in writing for the sale of eleven shares in the Lustring Company, which shares were never transferred, the books of the Company being shut up, &amp;c.</P>
<P>FOR the defendant, it was objected, 1st. That though this was a hard case on the now plaintiff; yet that it had been likewise hard on the defendant, who was not a contriver of the project; but a sufferer by it, having himself bought stocks at high rates. 2d. That equity ought, in such cases, to stand neuter and to let the hardship rest where the law had cast it, and at law, now the defendant had a ver∣dict. 3d. Though the books had been shut for some time, it was im∣possible to know but that they might be open again, and that in a lit∣tle time, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Master of the Rolls.</HI> It is against natural justice that any one should pay for a bargain, which he cannot have; there ought to be <HI>quid pro
<PB N="141" REF="033425_0101_0FF74BF64EA54868"/>quo;</HI> but in this case the defendant has sold the plaintiff <HI>a bubble or moonshine.</HI></P>
<P>IT is impossible that this bargain should ever be made good to the plaintiff; for here is proof by the company's own secretary of his having advised with three eminent counsel, who all agreed that the company cannot justify accepting any more transfers, and the mo∣ney cannot be said to be due in conscience, <HI>supposing the plaintiff to be incapable of coming at what he contracted for and in consideration whereof he was to pay his money.</HI></P>
<P>IF I should buy an house and before such time as, by the articles I am to pay for the same, the house be burnt down by casualty of fire, I shall not in equity be bound to pay for the house: and yet the house may be built up again: but I doubt it will be impossible to set up the company again, as in the other case the seller may do the house.</P>
<P>IT being four years since the contract; and the books having never been opened since, it is to be presumed they never will.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY it cannot be imagined that the plaintiff would have been prevailed upon to covenant for the payment of the money at a precise day, had he entertained the least apprehension, that the books would never have been opened.</P>
<P>As to the objection that the plaintiff here might have defended himself at law—Matters of fraud are cognizable in equity as well as at law. The seller in this case is the chief actor; he went to market with the bubble and since no transfer can be made let there be a per∣petual injunction and let the defendant, at the plaintiffs charge, enter satisfaction on the judgment.</P>
<P>ON a rehearing, it was contended for the defendant that he was not the first projector or inventor (of the bubble,) &amp;c. but no opinion was had—the cause being adjusted by the parties.</P>

<P><HI>BY the Court.</HI> Either <HI>suppressio veri</HI> or <HI>suggestio falsi</HI> is a good reason to set aside any release or conveyance. Now to recite in a deed, as in this case, that the will was duly executed when it was not, is <HI>suggestio falsi</HI> and to conceal from the heir (as in this case) that the will was not duly executed is <HI>suppressio veri,</HI> so that both circum∣stances concur; so the court relieved the heir from the release.</P>

<HEAD>COLT &amp; al' vs. WOOLLASTON &amp; ARNOLD. (P. Will. vol. II. p. 155.)</HEAD>
<P>THE plaintiffs brought their bill to be repaid the two several sums of 120<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and 120<ABBR>l.</ABBR> which they had paid to the defendants, as mana∣gers and projectors of a bubble, called the <HI>Land Security and Oil Patent.</HI></P>
<P>THE defendant <HI>Woollaston</HI> had (it seems) invented a project for ex∣tracting oil out of <HI>English</HI> radishes, and got a patent for the sole ex∣ercise of this invention; and having bought an estate for 31,800<ABBR>l.</ABBR> cal∣led <HI>Sutton Marsh</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> formerly the estate of lady <HI>Corn∣bury,</HI> which was then in mortgage for 28,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR></P>
<P>IN <HI>June</HI> 1720, this <HI>Woollaston</HI> made public this project and assigned his oil patent to the defendant <HI>Arnold,</HI> in trust for all the contributors
<PB N="142" REF="033425_0102_0FF74BFC8A77A060"/>towards the project, which he divided into five thousand shares, valu∣ing every share at 20<ABBR>l.</ABBR> in order to raise 100,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR></P>
<P>AND as an encouragement and security for all the contributors, <HI>Woollaston</HI> conveyed his purchase of <HI>Sutton Marsh</HI> to the defendant <HI>Arnold</HI> and his heirs, in trust, in the first place, to pay off the two mortgages, being 28,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and afterwards to pay to himself (the said <HI>Woollaston</HI>) 57,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> in all 85,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and as to the surplus which the estate would raise, it was to be for the benefit of the contributors; the project or bubble was to be called the <HI>Land Seurity and Oil Patent,</HI> and was represented by the defendants to be a most advantageous project without any hazard, there being landed security given for the benefit of the contributors.</P>
<P>The plaintiffs paid unto the defendant <HI>Arnold</HI> the several sums of 120<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and 120<ABBR>l.</ABBR> for six shares a-piece, for which <HI>Arnold</HI> gave them re∣ceipts, and the projectors sold about 1000 tickets amounting to 20,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR></P>
<P>IN <HI>August</HI> 1720 the project failed, no oil having ever been made, or radishes sowed on the premises.</P>
<P>WHEREUPON the contributors, with some resentment, called upon the projectors for their money, which occasioned the projectors to advertise, that in six months time, they would return the money with interest; but afterwards this was refused.</P>
<P>INSISTED for the defendants, that the plaintiff being acquainted with this security as to the lands, they ought to resort thither; that there could be no imposition in this case, because the parties had no∣tice; and the extracting oil out of radishes having had the sanction of a patent, could not be thought a cheat; and as to the advertise∣ments, it was pretended they were gained by threatnings; and that the parties admitting they were aggrieved, had their remedy at law.</P>
<P><HI>Master of the Rolls:</HI> This is an imposition, to propose the surplus of the value of an estate which cost but 31,800<ABBR>l.</ABBR> after 85,000 charged upon it, which is much more than double the value) as a security to the contributors who laid out their money upon this project; it is giving them <HI>moonshine</HI> instead of any <HI>thing real,</HI> and the proof is ve∣ry slight, whereas it ought to have been extremely strong; it is hard to believe, that any person would consent to be so imposed upon And what makes it worse is, that this great sum of 57,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> is reserved to the defendant the projector himself.</P>
<P>THE gaining the patent can be no sanction to the cheat, because the patent does not secure the patentee, if it is not a new invention, but others may use the same, or if it be not the first patent, the pat∣entee is not secure from an action; and patents of new inventions, as well as grants of other things, may be obtained by surprize and false suggestions.</P>
<P>IF this were a fraud against any private or single person, a court of equity would relieve; <HI>a fortiori,</HI> when it is a fraud against great numbers, against multitudes, where the mischief is more extensive, and many families thereby ruined.</P>
<P>IT is no objection, that the parties have their remedy at law, and may bring an action for monies had and received for the plaintiffs own use; for in cases of fraud, the court of equity has a concurrent jurisdiction with the common law, matter of fraud being the great subject of relief here.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="033425_0103_0FF74C0C48C8FA48"/>
ACCORDINGLY cases of this nature have frequently met with relief in this court, as in <HI>Aaron Hill's</HI> case, which was a patent for extract∣ing oil out of beech, which was also divided into shares, (as this is) and a security proposed and agreed to be made of lands, which came out to be <HI>terra incognita</HI> betwixt the degrees of latitude 50 and 57; and in the principal case, the land, after the 85,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> paid, seems to be worth as little as <HI>Aaron Hill's.</HI></P>
<P>AND as to the pretence of gaining the advertisements by force, the contributors were angry, and had reason to be so, and one of the con∣tributors (tho' it does not appear to have been either of the plaintiffs) threatened to cut the defendants throats; but this all ended in an arrest of one of the defendants, which was a lawful proceeding, and after all these threatenings were over, the last advertisement was given out by the defendants on the 19th of <HI>September</HI> 1720.</P>
<P>FURTHER it is just that the defendant <HI>Arnold,</HI> as well as the defen∣dant <HI>Woollaston,</HI> should be charged; for as <HI>Woollaston</HI> was the first projector and procurer of the patent, and purchaser of the land, so <HI>Arnold</HI> was his trustee, accepted the conveyance, was the treasurer, received the money, and gave the receipts, was partner in the fraud, and plainly <HI>particeps criminis.</HI></P>
<P>THEREFORE decree both the defendants to pay back to the plain∣tiffs their principal, interest and costs.</P>
<P><HI>Note;</HI> the same decree was made in the case of <HI>Spackman</HI> versus <HI>Woolldston,</HI> which was the next cause in the paper, of the same na∣ture, against the same defendants, and on the same project.</P>

<P>IN this view of our subject will you still be amused by the sellers telling you, that you can take possession of the lands, Congress or no Congress?—That you can drive off the Indians, Georgia willing or not willing? And pray could you not have been guilty of treason and violence, without purchasing? As well might robbers comfort their victims, by telling them, that they can earn as much more, or can indemnify themselves by robbing the next man they meet.</P>
<P>WILL you still be amused by being told, that per∣haps Georgia may release these lands to the United States and then you may get a title, or that perhaps they will again have a legislature abandoned enough to restore the granting act? Shall every new position in which this floating bubble can be presented charm you with new colours and brighten your hopes? Alas! all these attempts to amuse you are but like the opiates administered to wounded men which lull
<PB N="144" REF="033425_0104_0FF74C159DC9CF08"/>while they operate; but when they lose their effect, leave the patient awake to all the horror of his pains.</P>
<P>YOUR lands are irretrievably gone, you have no substitute for them. Your money has been paid to men who will probably be soon unable to refund, and if your notes should be recovered, the loss to the a∣mount of your whole purchases would be a total loss. To prevent such recovery your exertions alone are necessary. Let me request all, who have been pur∣chasers and sufferers by this Georgia business, to com∣bine these exertions.</P>
<P>BY your success, millions of dollars now pledged on this speculation, will be restored to the channels of industry—languishing credit and confidence will revive, and the records of our courts will bear stand∣ing testimony, of your triumph—over A SYSTEM OF FRAUD AND SWINDLING, MORE COMPLICATED IN ITS MACHINERY AND VARIED IN ITS OPERATIONS, THAN ANY WHICH HAS DISGRACED THE CHARAC∣TER OF MAN IN THIS OR ANY OTHER AGE.</P>
