<HEAD>Preface.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE</HI> following essay was originally designed for the use of the writer's Farmer only: to whom the want of time, and the want of practice had rendered READING, a work of his utmost exertions and industry to accomplish—who would have viewed a large treatise, as a most formidable undertaking; but might receive with great pleasure, the same matter thrown into a small compass—in which he could see, almost at a glance, the con∣stant object of his thoughts and occupation, treated of in a concise and reasonable manner, which might become the entertainment of his winter evenings, and from the various new hints and remarks con∣tained therein, lead him to try the truth of them by the unfailing test of experiment, and excite in him a laudable ambition of excelling in the line of his profession.</P>
<P>The appendix to the following essay, is little more than an a∣bridgment of various voluminous publications on the subject of agri∣culture and good husbandry, fitted to the use of Farmers in New-England. But in the Address it has been attempted to point the Farmer's mind to a serious attention to a system of oeconomics, in the various branches of his occupation, and in the relations he has to sus∣tain with those around him.—It is there said, "that more is gained by sowing than by hard labor"—even labor must be oeconomical—e∣qually distant from indolence on the one hand, and from hurry on the other—he who is over wrought to day, on the morrow must require su∣pernumerary hours of rest and relaxation, to retribute the excess. But the thrift of a saving man is regular and certain, though gradual and almost imperceptible. After a few years of systematical oeconomy, he looks back with astonishment on the aggregate amount of savings, com∣posed of articles seemingly below the waste of a moment's considera∣tion.</P>

<HEAD>The Character of a complete Farmer.</HEAD>
<P>A COMPLETE Farmer is a most careful, Indus∣trious and frugal, as well as reputable and useful man: and unless carefulness, industry and oeconomy are united in the character, it will be an imperfect one. Although a Farmer cannot live without labor, by labor alone he never can grow rich and reputable. Much depends upon his laying out and performing certain kinds of labor in the times and seasons when they ought to be performed. If he will not cart out his summer dung, nor plough those lands in the fall, which he means to seed in the following spring—if he will not put his seeds into the ground early, and as soon as the season will admit—if he will not attend to his Fences and see that they are sufficient—and if he will not cut his grass when it is ripe and do ev∣ery thing necessary to secure it in good order; he will be perpetually hurried from one kind of labor to a∣nother, and every one will be slighted: his flax will not be well coated, nor his grain properly filled out; his corn will be shortened for want of being well hoed, and his grass will become dead and dry away in the field. Let every kind of labor, therefore, be per∣formed in due season. A complete Farmer is also a man of great carefulness and solicitude; without care, the severest labor on the best of Farms, will never produce riches nor plenty. If the Farmer will
<PB N="6" REF="030307_0005_0FE5B041E62FA280"/>not milk his cows in season—see that they are pro∣perly tended—go to the male in the right time for the next year's profit; and that his dairy is neatly and carefully managed, he may labour without ceas∣ing, will have a small, poor breed of cattle, &amp; never enjoy a fulness of good butter, and cheese. It is care which makes a flock increase and grow to a good size, which brings forth the profits of a dairy, and which fills the house of the Farmer with good things. If he will not carefully inspect his fields and meadows, and see that his fences are in good order, his grass and his corn will be cropt by his cattle: and if he will not gather and put them up carefully and in due season, he will have a short and a mouldy crop. If he mows, rakes, and fodders his cattle in a careless slovenly manner, his flock will be pinched through the winter, and become poor and lousy in the spring —poor oxen too poor to do the labor of the sea∣son—poor cows, with little or no milk, and wretch∣ed calves and poor horses, too feeble to draw, and too weak to ride with safety. If his swine, poultry and stock in general, and if his carts, rakes and tools of all kinds, are not carefully attended to, the Farm∣er never can grow rich and respectable. It is atten∣tion which gradually collects from various sources, and covers the soil with manure; it is attention which causes the hills, fields and valleys to yield their increase, and advances and completes the most bene∣ficial improvements. There is a third virtue without the practice of which, the Farmer can never attain to wealth and independence: I mean oeconomy. Without this both labor in raising, and care in pre∣serving the fruits of the earth, are absolutely thrown away. Oeconomy is an excellent virtue in any man: it is indispensible in the affairs and profession of a Farmer. And of this he should never be unmind∣ful
<PB N="7" REF="030307_0006_0FE5B043777A87A8"/>when he looks into his barn, his cellar, or his gar∣ret, or even his pastures; to say nothing of his fields, mowing lands and meadows. But Farmers, as well as other men, are too apt to forget, that in their pursuits after riches, almost every thing depends up∣on oeconomy joined with care and industry. A fru∣gal, industrious man, blessed with but a common share of understanding, will undoubtedly succeed and advance his interest, beyond what ever he ex∣pected, when he first set out in life: provided no singular providential evil should overtake him. More is gained by saving than by hard labor. A Farmer therefore whose utmost profits are small and slow, as he cannot grow rich suddenly from his profession, should be a rigid and steady oeconomist. He should consider the saving he may make in every thing: in his fuel, tools, clothes, meat, drink, and pocket ex∣pences; above all in his Time, which is equal to so much money in hand. Every day that his neighbour runs down to market on his horse, with a pound or two of butter and a few eggs, if he stays at home and keeps steady to his labor, he gets two, if not three days the start of him. While his neighbour wastes his time and spends his money by this impru∣dent and trifling pursuit he saves both time and mo∣ney, in dressing and improving his lands, and which de∣mand all his attention. There is no leisure hour to be found on a farm from early in the spring, till late in the fall. Through all that whole period, a good farmer knows how to spend every hour profitably on his lands. He can have no time to pass in idleness—in chatting with people as they pass by—in making needless visits—in attending courts, horse races, taverns, and the like. By these means the public is annually de∣prived of many thousands of bushels of Potatoes, corn, tons of hay, &amp;c. and individuals themselves be∣come
<PB N="8" REF="030307_0007_0FE5993C5C6977D0"/>poor, and fall into the worst of habits—into idleness, gaming, drinking, &amp;c. There is no kind of oeconomy in the Farmer, which will not be well re∣warded. Early rising will contribute to his health, and preserve his fields from the inroads of unruly creatures, which commonly begin their trespasses just as the day begins to dawn. Close mowing and careful raking, will enable him to winter one cow ex∣traordinary. Feeding his hogs by weeds and other vegetable substances, will enable him to pay his shoe∣makers. Scraping his door and barn yards, after rains and showers, will clothe his boy. Saving his early apples, and which are commonly lost entirely, will pay his taylor, his poultry well attended, will pay his maid. His calves will pay all his taxes, and some part of his hired labor, if proper care be taken of them. In fine, let a Farmer who possesses only fifty acres of good land—who owes no man, and who has a common blessing on the labors of his hands, strictly attend to the management of his affairs; live a life of patient industry, and practice agreeable to the principles of oeconomy, and I think he may live well—may be excused the hardest of labor—leave his hoe and spade to the next generation, by the time he has seen Fifty years, when most men begin to think of comfort, ease and independence.</P>

<HEAD>The importance of Manure.</HEAD>
<P>TOO much cannot be said upon the subject of manure. The vast importance of this article has not been sufficiently attended to by Farmers in gen∣eral, although it is the principal source of their riches. Without it, after all their care and labor, they can have but miserable crops of grass, flax, corn, &amp;c. A man must plough, hoe, mow, rake and hire, more on poor, than on rich land: and it will take a much greater number of acres to support his family comfortably. And it requires the same quantity of seed; is much harder to till, and is taxed the same as rich land; and after all produces not one half the profits. Every Farmer, therefore, who wishes to reap the fruits of his labor and care; to improve his lands and increase his substance; and to live easy some future day, should carefully attend to the in∣crease of his manure. And here I would observe, that the hogstye, properly attended, will be found to be one of the greatest and richest sources of this important article. Almost any quantity may be ob∣tained from it; provided the Farmer will be as care∣ful to feed the stye, as the swine confined in it. All kinds of weeds, potatoe tops, straw, pomace, broken peat, dressings of flax, butt-stalks, roots and vegetables of every kind, will soon become the richest of ma∣nure, when thrown into the hogstye. Three or four swine in this way, will make twelve or fifteen loads in a year; the value of which, where dung is scarce and dear, will be four pounds at least. Several ju∣dicious
<PB N="10" REF="030307_0009_0FE5B04B710A17A8"/>Farmers of my acquaintance, are persuaded that the greatest profits in keeping swine, arise from their sties. A small proportion of this manure, mixed with soil and rubbish, would be seen in a field of potatoes, or of indian corn. And the quan∣tity to be made in one stye, well supplied with weeds and other vegetable substances through the year, is almost incredible; some have said, that "forty loads" may be obtained in this way, from ten, or twelve swine, in one year only. And great quantities of excellent manure for dressing grass land, may be obtained by ploughing, or cutting up green sward two or three inches thick, by the sides of roads, walls, &amp;c. and laying it in heaps, grass side down, for eight or ten months. A little lime mixed with it, would render it fit for use much sooner. One would think, that a Farmer who mows over three or four acres of land, naturally good, but worn down, and which yield not more than fifteen or twenty hundreds of hay—who cultivates as many acres of indian corn, on a soil equally as good, but starved and ex∣hausted, and which return him sixty or seventy bush∣els only; when he looks into the fields of his neigh∣bor, which are not better, if quite so good, in point of soil, but which are richly manured, and yield three times the crops yearly, must be convinced of the vast importance of manure; and of the amazing ad∣vantages to be derived from this great and capital ar∣ticle in the cultivation of the earth. The Chinese, who may be stiled a vast nation of Farmers, as agri∣culture is their most honorable and their principal employment, pay the greatest attention to it. The urine of families is all carefully saved; and the re∣fuse of every kind of vegetable substance which the earth produces, through their labor and care, is made to contribute to reproductions. And, as very little
<PB N="11" REF="030307_0010_0FE5B04D04A56C30"/>can be done in the farming line, in the states of New-England, without manure, excepting new lands, which from the general deluge have increased in rich∣ness, by the falling of leaves, and other substances scattered on their surfaces, it ought to be considered and attended to most carefully. And there can be no judicious Farmer among us, who does not endea∣vor to obtain large quantities of this article, in pro∣portion, if possible, to the proposed cultivation and improvements of the next year.</P>
<P>We read, that the lands of the rich man brought forth plentifully, but this was not merely because the possessor was rich; for, the lands of the wealthy, will be no more productive, than those of the poor, if they neglect to manure and cultivate them properly. The truth is, a plenty of manure and a judicious, seasona∣ble cultivation, will soon put a new face upon almost any lands whatever. And if Farmers in general would pay more attention to the increase of their manure, they would experience a decrease in their labors, and receive a much greater profit from them. A few a∣cres of good land richly manured and highly cultivat∣ed would support their families confortably. And there is scarcely any soil, but which, by these means, would give a prudent man a decent living. And that Farmer in this state who will not give his attention to this sub∣ject, cannot reasonably expect any great profits from cultivating the earth, nor to become respectable in his profession.</P>

<HEAD>On Labor.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I have been riding in the country in a very hot day, and seen Farmers mowing and hoeing in the full blaze of the noon day sun, the custom of those Farmers with whom I was conversant when a Lad, has immediately occured to my mind. In the months of June, July and August, they retired so early to rest, that they seldom needed a candle to light them to their beds: and they rose as early in the morning as they could see to work. In the heat of the day, unless a shower, or some thing extra cal∣led them to exert themselves, they laid aside their la∣bors for an hour or two, and indulged themselves in a comfortable nap after dinner. This gave them fresh strength and vigor: and they went forth to the labor of the evening, with spirit and pleasure. And if Farmers would work as early and late as they could, in the summer season, they might rest from e∣leven until two o'clock, and escape the intense heat and thirst of the day: and not be one half so much fati∣gued as others, who begin their labor late in the morn∣ing—at six or perhaps seven o'clock; &amp; who, to perform the labors of the day, must bear the heat and burden of it, and go to their beds at night exceeding weary, and quite exhausted. From eleven 'till two, you may walk round your farm, stir hay, or do any light labor, without fatiguing yourself in the least. This walk will refresh your spirits; and may save your lands from the inroads of unruly cattle, sheep, swine, &amp;c. Walls and other fences should often be inspec∣ted,
<PB N="13" REF="030307_0012_0FE5B05396B00778"/>if you wish to preserve the fruits of your labors, and half an hour, or more, in the time and season of it, devoted to this purpose, would not fail of being well rewarded—These hints may be improved on: and I close this paper by observing, that mowing and hoeing, both for comfort and profit, should be per∣formed early in the morning and late in the evening. The labor of a Farmer is hard in general; a great part of the year it is severe; and even when pru∣dence has alone done all that she can do, and which is not a little, still, in the sweat of his face shall he eat bread.</P>

<HEAD>Exchanging Work.</HEAD>
<P>FARMERS who handle but little money, should be cautious of entering into cash engagements; they will find it more convenient to exchange Labor, than to hire and pay money. Neighbors who have lands to break up, and teams to connect together, may do this business cheaper, by exchanging with each other, than by hiring help and cattle. It will of∣ten be found mutually beneficial to make exchanges, even in mowing and hoeing. Through a difference in the situations and soils of farms, though adjoining each other; and through early cultivation in the one, and late in the other, it frequently happens, that the corn, grass, flax, &amp;c. on one, is forwarder and ripe sooner by several days, than on the other. In this case it would be prudent to unite their labors and not to hire; this would be almost so much saved. But then, these exchanges should never make any alteration, either in meats or drinks, in the Farmer's family. For, if any extra provision is made an extraordinary ex∣pence is incured. The chief use of land, and that which makes it principally beneficial and profitable to a man, is this, it gives him employment: It is of very little advantage or profit to him who does not labor upon it in person. A Farmer should there∣fore be cautious of hiring much help; and at no time more than he can fully and profitably employ and readily pay. And to do this if he hires for a month, or for a year he should endeavour to raise a surplusage of some one, or of several articles to the amount of the labor∣er's
<PB N="15" REF="030307_0014_0FE5B05765CD1020"/>wages at least. And if he does this, even then, he finds that a year's wages are not easily paid: it will take off a considerable part of his corn, flax, dai∣ry, or some other produce.</P>
<P>Those Farmers who hire much labor done, will soon be convinced, if men of sense, that scarce any farm will yield six per cent. and keep up the necessary repairs: and that although they posses flocks and herds, and are the proprietors or owners of the soil, they are but little more than stewards to their laborers. And this should excite them to labor industriously with their own hands, and to do all they can within them∣selves. When diet and labor are scarce and dear, and a man has several farms, or more land to improve and cultivate, than he can take care of, unless he hires a number of laborers, he should let, or put them to the halves, as it is called, to honest and industri∣ous men, if he can find them. For, the difference between hiring laborers and boarding them, and let∣ting, or putting out a farm, as above, the produce of which may amount to eighty or an hundred pounds, would be twenty, or twenty-five per cent. in favor of the proprietor. And he will not have the trouble of providing for, and paying a number of people: some of whom, after all his attention and punctuality toward them, will not acknowledge themselves satisfied and contented. Good help, as it is called, is generally scarce and dear, and with difficulty obtained; and a Farmer who hires careless, ignorant and slothful labor∣ers, notwithstanding all his own industry, will never grow rich.</P>

<HEAD>The profits of a Nursery.</HEAD>
<P>TO this interesting subject so little attention has been paid for many years past, that the scarcity and price of fruit, are now so exceeding great, as almost to prohibit the use of it. How surprizing a neglect in the Farmer who lives in New-England, the climate and soil of which are more than favorable to the prop∣agation of various kinds of delicious fruits. The citizens of New-York have resisted this careless, in∣dolent disposition, and been well rewarded for their industry. Considerable sums of money are annually remited them from this State for the productions of their nurseries, purchased at a most extravagant price, although the risk of transporting them is ve∣ry great. And I have no doubt, that the Farmers of Massachusetts would soon find it to their advan∣tage would they engage in this business. Their la∣bors are often bestowed upon productions, not of one half the importance and value. For, although it is commendable in the Farmer to raise a portion of ev∣ery article consumed in his family, provided his lands can easily be made to produce it; yet, a little patch of tobacco, or of pumpkins, ought not, year after year, to prevent the cultivation of a nursery: the profits of which, within the term of seven years, would be vastly greater than could possibly arise from the cultivation of those vegetables, in the same pe∣riod and proportion.</P>
<P>Twenty years ago the writer obtained half a pole of land, in the corner of a gentleman's garden, and filled it with young appletrees; taken up carefully
<PB N="17" REF="030307_0016_0FE5B060A040E5A0"/>with the point of a knife, when they had four, or six leaves on them, as they shot out of the pomace scat∣tered round a neighboring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. When they were four years old he grafted them close to the ground; and three years after he sold them for more than FIVE POUNDS sterling. They were remo∣ved to a suitable situation, and now form a most beautiful and productive orchard. Thus profitable was that little effort in the nursery way. There have been many others of the like kind, on a larger scale, and all very advantageous. One in particular shall be mentioned.</P>
<P>About ten years ago, a very worthy gentleman in my neighbourhood, possessed of a fine taste, and of an excellent judgment in the management of a nur∣sery, began the propagation of fruit and other trees: partly for his amusement, and partly for the use of his farm. Since which he has furnished a most beau∣tiful and extensive garden, with a rich and vast vari∣ety, from his own nurseries: and now has an abun∣dance of the finest apples, plumbs, peaches, apricots, cheries, &amp;c. From so great a number of young and thrifty trees, bearing and coming on to bear, one can scarcely pretend to guess at the quantity of fruit which they will yield in the period of four, or five years more.</P>
<P><HI>[The following account is taken from his Gardener.]</HI></P>
<P>"In the spring of the year, 1790, when I engaged in the service of E. H. D. <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> his gardens were not so extensive as they now are; and his nursery was small, compared with what it is at present. But lit∣tle was done in it that year. Some apple, pear, and fruit trees were planted; and a collection of seeds made for the following year: in which, apple, pear, plumb, apricot, peach, cherry, mulberry, elm, button
<PB N="18" REF="030307_0017_0FE5B0626BA04238"/>wood seeds, &amp;c. were sowed, all of which have fully answered the expectations of the proprietor, and of the best judges of propagating these kinds of trees. Yearly additions have been made to this nursery, and it now takes up nearly one acre and one quarter of land. The whole of the expence bestowed upon it, from 1790 to 1795, does not exceed, in my opinion, the sum of forty pounds. And this year, trees have been taken from it, and sold, to that amount: and had there been enough of a suitable age and growth, for transplanting, one hundred pounds worth might have been disposed of. Not to mention the great number of trees taken out of this nursery, to supply the proprietor's own gardens, and those presented to his friends, it now contains more than two thousand of button wood trees, five years from the seeds, and from seedlings brought from the town of Boylston, one thousand of which are more than seven feet high, and which are to be removed next spring, to a suita∣ble situation, for the purpose of a woodlot for the use of his farm. Including these, there are now in this nursery about fourteen thousand trees; many of them are small, and have not been inoculated. I estimate them on an average, at six pence: and at this low price the value of them will be THREE HUNDRED and FIFTY POUNDS, the nett proceeds, on profits of one acre and one quarter of land improved in this way. For, the trees which have been taken up and distributed on the farm, with those which have been given away, would more than pay the rent of the land, and the expence of fencing it. And it ought to be observed, that a very consi∣derable portion of the labor bestowed on this nursery, might have been performed at times when little else could have been done."</P>
<P>Here we see the exertions and rewards of industry
<PB N="19" REF="030307_0018_0FE5B063FA299E30"/>in the cultivation of a nursery. And one would think that this example would be followed by many atten∣tive and judicious Farmers among us. But if it should not, this is certain, viz. that it is an example of great industry, and well worthy the attention of the public.</P>
<P>But it may be observed, that if Farmers in general should attend to the cultivation of fruit trees they would soon become plenty, and be of little value. To determine this matter, let them consider, how great a number of their neighbours, and who might raise corn in plenty, do nevertheless neglect to cultivate so much of it as would supply their families, although bread is the staff of life. Good husbands only will be the rivals of those who may engage in the propagation of fruit trees. And this will give those who engage in the business, two chances at least, out of three, in favor of a ready market for their productions of this kind. And besides, old orchards are mouldering away; new farms are rapidly increasing; and a country without bounds is daily soliciting a supply from the nursery. When nurseries were numerous; when orchards, now decayed and past bearing, were in their full strength and vigor; and when money was very scarce—even then—forty years ago, appletrees from the nursery would fetch eight pence each; and there is no great probability that they will ever be much cheaper in this State.</P>

<HEAD>The advantages of an Orchard.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we survey the country around us, of which our industrious Ancestors took possession about one century and an half ago, we see the ruins of ma∣ny once beautiful and flourishing orchards: and we are surprized that their descendants have endeavored no more to counteract those ravages of time, by re∣placing the labors of their hands. To excuse this negligence it has been observed, that young orchards will not succeed on those lands from which old ones have been removed; though peartrees will, and last for more than one generation. But if this observa∣tion be just, and it is more than probable that it may be, for large trees must impoverish the ground on which they grow, there is scarcely any considerable farm on which some new situation may not be found on which to place an orchard. Any southeast pros∣pect, or an hill dripping towards the south, which is a most excellent situation, or even the sides of roads and fences around pastures and mowing lands, will answer very well. Trees thus placed will yield a great plenty of fruit; increase the grass; afford a comfort∣able shelter for cattle, and be highly ornamental. It would be judicious to propagate a large proportion of sweet apples: as they afford a rich repast for the table of the Farmer; are equal in value to any other apples for cyder; and will almost fatten sheep and swine. One would imagine, that the profits and pleasures arising from an orchard, would stimulate the Rarmer to propagate the appletree; but in noth∣ing,
<PB N="21" REF="030307_0020_0FE5B071F6887EB8"/>perhaps, has the present generation been more deficient. Many farms on which scarcely an apple is now to be seen, abounded with those of the first quali∣ty fifty years ago. Cyder was then so plenty that it would not fetch more than two or three shillings, at the press, per barrel; nor more than five or six in the market. In that part of the country in which the writer then lived, about a dozen miles from Boston, apples, pears, plumbs, cherries and peaches were exceeding plenty. Boys were seldom or never known to rob fruit trees of any kind: and the poor had only to ask and gather what they wanted. I know of no tree in this country which produces a greater variety of fruit; scarcely any two, unless grafted, or innoculated, being of the same taste and flavor, which can be used in a greater variety of ways, and preserved for a longer space of time, than that which I am recommending. In bloom the ap∣pletree makes a most beautiful appearance, and the fruit of it, even in its crude state, affords an agreea∣ble tart. Although it is said by naturalists, that the crab is the poorest of all apples, they differ in many essential respects from each other. Some are ripe in July, and highly agreeable to the palate: others are mature in August, and in September; and so on, in succession, 'till late in October, when all come to perfection, and there is the greatest variety and a∣bundance. While some are most excellent for pyes, and others for sauce, a greater proportion are for eat∣ing; and may be preserved through the winter, with no other expence than barreling, or boxing them up: and all of them may be converted into a very whole∣some, vinous liquor, which will keep through the whole of the year. But some have observed, that appletrees are liable to frosts, worms, catterpillars, &amp;c. and therefore they neglect the propagation of them.
<PB N="22" REF="030307_0021_0FE5B074999D6B38"/>Apply this reasoning to flax, barley, and to corn: shall we neglect these things because they are subject to frosts, worms, mildews, and the like evils? It is true, that apples are not so necessary as bread; but they are very grateful and profitable. If only one tree out of twenty set out by the farmer, should flourish and bear fruit, within twenty years after the propagation of it, he will receive a tenfold reward for all his expence and trouble. Let your appletrees be carefully planted out; well secured from sheep and cattle; and judici∣ously grafted; then you may comfort yourself with the reflection, that you have laid the foundation of that wealth which will grow and increase as you ad∣vance in years, and eventually descend to your chil∣dren. Could I name a certain tree, which would grow rapidly; and extend its branches far and wide; and which would last for a century or more; and that this tree within less than a dozen years after the seeds of it had been sowed, would start up and bear a multi∣tude of little silver pieces, equal in value to the sixteenth or even the sixtieth part of a dollar, would you not endea∣vor to propagate that tree? Why, then, can you not be persuaded that all the profits of this tree may be re∣alized, if you will cultivate the appletree? Although the fruit of this tree is another kind of property, and differs in appearance from those little pieces of sil∣ver, it will as certainly produce them, as if the tree itself had borne them. Whatever you cultivate, and which produces silver, is the same in point of profit, as silver itself.</P>
<P>There is one consideration more on this subject, and which may not be unworthy of your attention. Many Farmers who hire a number of laborers are o∣bliged thereby to pay a very heavy tax, to which their forefathers were entire strangers. I mean the expence incurred by RUM, and which is more prejudicial to
<PB N="23" REF="030307_0022_0FE5B0762D329A38"/>their interests than frosts and caterpillars are to their orchards. And I can see no way of withstanding this growing evil, but through the influence and increase of CYDER. When this liquor was plenty, and when good small beer held a respectable place in the Farmer's cellar, the best of laborers—men who would reap, or hoe an acre per day, in light land, and go home at night contented with their wages, were ready to be hired—there were enough of these characters wishing to work, and the Farmer had not to court them into his service. And I have no doubt, was cyder as plenty, and good small beer in as much reputation in these days, as they were fifty or sixty years ago, Farmers would soon experience an altera∣tion in their favor. The man who will not labor chearfully and faithfully when he has victuals enough, and good cyder and beer, is not worth his keeping. If then, you would reap the above profits and plea∣sures, and rid yourself of this needless and burthen∣some tax, cultivate the appletree; and endeavor to excel in the quantity and quality of your cyder, which is annually increasing in value.</P>
<P>I shall close by observing, that every apple tree in∣creases the value of the farm on which it grows. Those farms on which good orchards are placed will commonly be in demand, and greatly preferred to those which have none. Indeed a judicious man will not readily buy a farm which has no orchard on it; because it wants one essential advantage; more especially if it be near a market town. A young and flourishing orchard, has rendered many an old and worn-out farm saleable.</P>

<HEAD>The management of Cyder.</HEAD>
<P>MANY Farmers who spare no expence nor labor in preparing their pork, veal and mutton in the best manner, with the view of obtaining the highest prices for those articles, pay very little attention to another equally as important a part of their produce; and which would well reward them for all their cares and pains bestowed upon it; I mean cyder. That which is sweet and good, will fetch one sixth part more at least, than that which is four and ordinary. This must be an object to the Farmer, even when he has but one or two tons to dispose of: and when he has three, or four times that quantity to sell, it becomes of great importance to him. If his lot is cast with∣in eight or ten miles of a market town, this sixth part will almost defray the expences of carting the whole. And this kind of cyder will meet with a rea∣dy sale: the man who offers it, will not be obliged to stand a great many hours in the heat of the day, per∣haps, in fly time, or in a storm, and after all his anxiety, and the sufferings of his cattle, to court a chapman. And whatever the feelings of those may be, who regard neither the quality of the article they have for sale, nor the trouble and artifice they are o∣bliged to submit to, in order to dispose of it, the Far∣mer who knows that his meat, meal, cyder, &amp;c. are really good, when he shall hear them commended and receive a generous price for them, will enjoy the approbation of his own heart and go home rejoicing. It must be of as much advantage to a Farmer, as it is to a merchant, or to a mechanic, to establish and
<PB N="25" REF="030307_0024_0FE5B07E354592C0"/>support a reputable and good character. But, that good cyder may be more common, and that those Farmers who have orchards may be benefited by this publication, let them attend to the following directions, communicated by a respectable Gentleman: and who, for a number of past years has experienced the utility of them.</P>
<P>"Let the Farmer who wishes to have the clearest, sweetest and best of cyder, see that his apples are fully ripe, and perfectly sound before they are ground. And two or three days after the cyder has been well made in the common way, and before it begins to ferment, let him take out the head of a cask which will contain one hundred gallons, and set it upright, with a faucet or plug placed in it near the bottom. Then let him empty his barrels into it, and grate one quarter of a pound of chalk into the liquor: let it be stirred with a stick, the end of which has been broomed, until it begins to ferment. Then let it stand for two, or three days, according as the weather may be, when all the pomace will rise and float on the top of the li∣quor. Then let it be drawed off into casks perfectly sweet and new, for bad casks will spoil the best cyder if put into them, and let it stand without giving it vent, 'till the beginning of February following, when it must be racked off. Cyder, naturally good and managed in this way, is equal, in the opinion of many Gentlemen, to small wines; and will always fetch a generous price in the market. If it should not be per∣fectly clear in the spring, after it is racked off, take a pound of good coarse sugar, with two or three eggs, break them into the sugar, shells and all, &amp; add to them half a pint of fine sand; beat them well together; put them into the barrel of cyder; stir the liquor with a broomed stick, until it shall be found to fer∣ment
<PB N="26" REF="030307_0025_0FE5B0ACAD19CE90"/>powerfully; and within ten or twelve days after this operation, it will be fit to be bottled."</P>
<P>I shall close this paper by observing, that there may be a very great advantage derived from grafting fruit of the apple kind, even when the orchard is intended for cyder only; provided a number of trees be set with one kind of fruit, and a number with another kind, and so on: for all these different kinds will have their several periods of perfection; and may be made into cyder as they become ripe. This is not the case with ungrafted apples: in their natural state, and taken promiscuously as is common, some will be crude, or not ripe, some in perfection, and some rot∣ten ripe; and from such a collection good cyder can∣not reasonably be expected.</P>
<P>To give a fine amber, or curious color to cyder, not naturally so, let it lay in the promace fifteen or twenty hours, before it is put into the vat or cheese to be pressed, and take care that no water comes near it.</P>

<HEAD>Keeping a Day Book.</HEAD>
<P>BOTH merchants and mechanics are greatly in∣debted to their books of accounts, for information and success in the several branches of their business, by re∣gular and correct entries. The transaction of every day should be correctly noted. The time when you plough, sow, plant, mow, pull flax, cut fuel, gather corn, potatoes, &amp;c. and the quantity and quality of manure laid on each field, should be carefully notic∣ed. You will then know the season when labor must be done the next year, in those fields, and the kinds and proportions of manure required to dress them. Farmers should weigh all their pork, beef, butter and cheefe; and measure all their grain, corn, potatoes, &amp;c. and indeed, every article they lay up for winter; and also the time when they kill their creatures and the food on which they were fatted. This will shew the quantity they consume, what, and how much of each article, and how much they may have to dispose of. Days on which they hire labor∣ers; the labor performed on those days, and the price paid for that labor, should be entered. This will shew what time and labor must be performed the next year, the price of it, and the money which may be wanted to carry on the business of the farm. Every farmer should mark the day on which his cows, mares, &amp;c. associate with the males of their several kinds; he will then be able to provide proper room, &amp;c. for the reception of their young and to attend to their keeping in due season, and which ought to be a little better then common, at those periods.
<PB N="28" REF="030307_0027_0FE5B08170225788"/>For want of this attention, multitudes of calves, lambs, pigs, &amp;c. are annually lost. The ages of lambs, calves, colts, &amp;c. should be carefully noted, and the weight of them when killed; as this will point out those ewes, cows, &amp;c. which are best for breeders; which is a very material branch of knowledge, in regard to the growth and value of a stock of cat∣tle. In short, the Farmer should note the business of every day, how and where he past it, and what the weather was; and he should not forget, that so much of the goodness of his crops depends upon early and seasonable cultivation, that he had better give any price for labor than be belated; more depends on this than farmers in general seem to be sensible of. Flax, sowed early, will have a better coat, and more seed than when sowed late. Barley sowed early will not be liable to blast and mildue; and indian corn planted and hoed in good season, will not be so liable to suf∣fer from drought, and from frosts, and will be fuller and heavier, than when planted late, poorly ploughed, and indifferently hoed. Grass land on which manure is spread early, will yield a much better crop, than if spread late, and <HI>one</HI> load of grass, cut when ripe, and before it withers and turns white in the field, will be of more value than <HI>two</HI> loads of the same kind, cut after it is ripe, dried away and weatherbeaten: it has lost its juices in this state, which is all that is valuable. Our summers are so short, that every pos∣sible advantage should be taken for early cultivation: for negligence and inattention in the spring, will cer∣tainly be followed by cold and hunger of the follow∣ing winter.</P>
<P>But to return. A Farmer should keep a careful entry of all his fodder; the quantity and quality of each kind: for, he may wish to purchase and winter a cow or two extraordinary—and an account of the
<PB N="29" REF="030307_0028_0FE5B08301C0BEE8"/>manure made by his swine, by scraping of the roads, his yards, by mud, barn dung, &amp;c. for, this will show him at once, how much land to break up, and the strength he will have for the next year's cul∣tivation: if he neglects this branch of good husband∣ry, he cannot expect to form a just estimate, either of the labor or profits of the next year. To avail himself of many of the advantages which stand con∣nected with his situtation and farm, he must attend to these things, many of which may appear of little or of no consequence in the eyes of the mass of farm∣ers; but they certainly deserve their very serious at∣tention. Laborers, unless upon some urgent occasions, should never be hired by the month, nor even for a single day, in the winter season; when the days are short, cold and stormy, and when an industrious man can hardly earn his living. The quantity of pork, beef, cyder and other provisions expended, in other words, almost thrown away, by this imprudent prac∣tice, will certainly be missed, and severely felt in the following spring and summer; unless and additional stock of each be laid up to support it in the fall pro∣ceeding. The farmer may hire labor in the spring, to get a good crop in the ground in due season; in the summer, to secure his grass; and in the fall of the year, to gather in his harvest; but not in the winter, when nothing can be raised, either for the use of man or beast.</P>
<P>And here I observe, that every Farmer should en∣deavour to cultivate and take care of his own lands; and not let the profits of them depend on hirelings more than he cannot possibly avoid. And he should never work within door, while any thing can be done to advantage without; nor set himself, or his laborers, to that work in fair, which can be done in foul weather.</P>

<HEAD>Contracting Debts.</HEAD>
<P>A FARMER, as his lands yield but one crop in a year, and as the proceeds of that cannot be received 'till late in the fall, or the winter, should take as lit∣tle as possible on credit: for of all that he raises he will have but little to spare, unless he deprives his family of some of the comforts and conveniences of their lives. It will take a considerable proportion of a large stock of cattle, as they rise, to raise even an hundred dollars, in common times; and these are the only times on which he ought to form his calcu∣lations. What by over dry, or by otherwise unpro∣fitable seasons, he should bear in mind, that every seventh or eighth year, will be but indifferent in point of profit; and on which all his exertions will but just render his family comfortable. Instead, therefore, of spending all, in years of plenty, he should endeavor to lay up something, against those days of scarcity. Debts may, soon be contracted, and to a ruinous a∣mount, if care be not taken to avoid them. When a Farmer owes his merchant, his schoolmaster, la∣borers, &amp;c. and when he has paid them all off, he will find that a very considerable part of his crops are disposed of and gone. And he ought to reflect, when he lays himself under pecuniary obligations to his neighbors, that some of them are entirely igno∣rant of his resources, and of the only season in which he can conveniently discharge them. A man who never sows, thinks not of the time for reaping. Creditors may call for their monies, when it will not
<PB N="31" REF="030307_0030_0FE5B08B73663400"/>be in his power to satisfy them, without making a most injurious sacrifice of his stock, or some other things—they may call when his crops are on the grounds; or in the spring, before they are put into the earth; and when all his industry and labor can∣not save him. It is greatly to the disadvantage of any man to be in debt, most commonly, and to no man more, perhaps, than to the Farmer. But here, I expect the Farmer will observe that there are so many temptations, and that such is the fashion of the times at present, that it is almost impossible for him to keep clear of debts. I acknowledge and la∣ment the truth of his observation: but there are remedies at hand, with which to counteract these e∣vils. A good share of prudence, and a manly spirit of self-denial, will secure him, at all times, against them. Let him, in the first place, guard against the cry of good bargains, for, it has often been the case, that men, for a little and convenient piece of land, have paid very dear. Either the day of pay∣ment was not duly considered, and provided for; or the soil did not answer their expectations—was not rich, well senced and watered; or it was a purchase beyong their ability. Again, the Farmer sees his neighbour, not more wealthy in lands, stock, or ready money, than himself, mounted on an excellent horse, or riding in an elegant chaise quite at his ease and pleasure; while he has but an ordinary creature, both for his own, and for his wife's accommodation; and feels himself most sensibly affected. Pride, or a desire of appearing to an equal advantage, steps in at once to the relief of his mortified feelings, and he immediately resolves to excel, or at least to equal him in outward appearance. But before he takes a single step in this weighty affair, he ought to consider the age and circumstances of the man who he wishes
<PB N="32" REF="030307_0031_0FE5B08D06BCDA80"/>to rival. He may be an older man than him, and have labored more years; he may have been more in∣dustrious, careful and oeconomical; or his family may not have been so large and expensive—he may have more sons,—possess better faculties, and know how to save in one thing, what he expends extra in anoth∣er. And if he has labored more years, and taken bet∣ter care of his lands, crops, stock, manure, &amp;c. he may well ride while others go on foot who have not paid an equal attention to their farms. But if he had not labored more years than you had—had no pecu∣liar advantages above you, nor been a better husband, and you cannot afford to buy an elegant horse, or a fine chaise, the man deserves your pity, rather than your envy. Consider this matter, and how painful the reflections arising from it, after a few years of gay and flashy appearance, to be turned out of doors, and to leave your wife and children to the cold hand of charity! Surely, this must operate against the passion you wish to indulge; get the better of all these idle and foolish sensations; render you quite ea∣sy, although you see your neighbours finer than you are, and lead you to avoid all needless and ruinous expences.</P>
<P>It is true, there is a peculiar pleasure in appearing, and living equal to those of our rank and station, and which we hardly know how to relinquish; but it is much wiser to sacrifice a little, yea a great deal to our feelings, than to be reduced to dependence. Nothing, indeed, can exceed the folly of those, who live beyond their stated incomes, and who are ambi∣tious to maintain an appearance, without the means with which to do it.</P>
<P>Let it therefore be the desire of the Farmer, to cultivate and improve the soil on which he lives, with the greatest attention, and to confine his expences to
<PB N="33" REF="030307_0032_0FE5B08EE2BD0548"/>the annual income of his lands. This will save him from the pains of many an anxious and distressing hour as he passes along through life, and soften his pillow, when in the hour of death.</P>

<HEAD>Cloathing and Diet.</HEAD>
<P>THE earth is the parent of us all: her breasts are inexhaustible: the Farmer is her first born: and yet, how often does he forfeit her blessing! Every man who tills the ground, and who endeavours not to live, as much as possible, upon the productions of his own labor, is guilty of this extravagance. The Merchant may indulge in foreign luxuries, may eat, drink and wear, such articles as are not the growth and manufacture of his own country, as he imports them, and as they come cheaper to him, than to those who buy of him, and consume the greater part of them. And the Mechanic, from his profession, is <HI>obliged</HI> to live upon the productions of other men's labors; but the Farmer is the most independent man in the world, as he may raise every article for his own consumption—bread, milk, pork, beef, butter and cheese, potatoes, wool, flax, cyder, beer,—and what other good things can he then stand in need of? you will say, perhaps, a little coffee, a little tea, sugar, rum, &amp;c. I acknowledge, that those little things, all but the last mentioned, may now and then be in∣dulged in; provided the Farmer, and his family, will be contented to perform a considerable portion of ex∣traordinary labor, and to use these things more oeconomically, or sparingly, through the year. For rum, freely used, will soon reduce, and render poor, the most wealthy Farmer. If he should expend but one gallon per week, from the spring to the last of autumn, seven months only—it will form a direct
<PB N="35" REF="030307_0034_0FE5B09341C28BD8"/>tax, of six or seven pounds; and which is more, perhaps, than all his state, county, town and parish taxes put together. I have said a <HI>direct</HI> tax; and it often proves as heavy an evil <HI>indirectly:</HI> that is to say, it takes time to run to the shops for it; it takes time to sit and chat over it; and it takes time to re∣cover from the baneful effects of it. For, it gradu∣ally impairs the strength, as it weakens the powers of the stomach, and eventually brings on premature old age, to say nothing of the manifold contentions and quarrels excited by the use of it. I am now speak∣ing of this article, used to excess, as it is but too commonly. In hot and sultry weather, a moderate portion of it, well diluted, six parts, at least, out of seven, with water, when the laborer is greatly fatigued, exceeding thirsty, and compelled to drink immode∣rately, may not be prejudicial: but even then, good cyder, and malt liquors, are much better, and more salutary, both for the body and purse of the Farmer. Our fathers tilled the ground without it, were strong and vigorous, left their farms unmortgaged, and died in a good old age. I wish I could say, that their de∣scendants had not acquired very different habits, not a little unhappy for themselves and for their children. When men of sixty, or of seventy years of age, re∣collect the days of their youth, they cannot but re∣member, how easy and independent their fathers past their days. When the Collector or Tax-gatherer came, and which was seldom oftener than once in a year, to receive their several assessments, he commonly 05 found them laid up and ready for him.—It was al∣most scandalous in those who obliged him to call a second time for his due; and as to those persons who were compelled by a course of law to pay their just debts, they fell into open and great disgrace thereby.
<PB N="36" REF="030307_0035_0FE5B094CFB48200"/>And to what was this owing—to what causes, under GOD, were they indebted for their freedom, ease and independence, but their industry, and care against contracting debts for luxuries, and for things not ne∣cessary; and to their making it an irrevocable rule, not to eat, drink nor wear scarcely any thing which was not raised on their farms, and which was not the fruit of their own labors. In those days, when the rites of hospitality were peculiarly attended to, rum, tea, &amp;c. were hardly known: and the daughters of the most wealthy and independent farmers, the mothers of many of the more respectable persons now living in these States, seldom appeared in silks. And it would be highly advantageous to Farmers in these days, if they would endeavor to raise more on their lands for their own consumption, and to buy less of unnecessa∣ry articles imported from abroad. That Farmer who has not money at interest, and who can only make both ends of the year meet by his own labors, before he purchases any superfluous article for his family, should look into his cellar, corn-barn, &amp;c. and con∣sider whether he has any, and how much grain, but∣ter, cheese, &amp;c. to spare, over and above that portion which must be disposed of, to pay his laborers, taxes, and a number of incidental demands. Let him re∣flect upon the toil and labor those articles have cost him, which he will acknowledge to be very conside∣rable, and more than enough to convince him of their value and importance. Let the extraordinary industry of the Farmer's daughters, with the profits of a good yard of poultry, bear some kind of pro∣portion to the luxuries he purchases; and then he will not feel those expenses so heavily, and his affairs will continue to wear a good aspect.</P>

<HEAD>Engaging in Law-suits.</HEAD>
<P>THE Farmers of New-England in general, are too apt to contend with each other in the law; and to refer, even the most trisling controversies between them, to the decisions of Courts of Justice. But they ought to guard against this ruinous practice, as they would against the greatest disappointments and misfortunes. For if they will attend to the fruits of this unhappy passion, they will see that but few, if any, have been benefited, while multitudes have been utterly ruined by it. So great are the unavoidable expenses of time, counsel, witnesses, attendance, fees of officers, and so many the vexations of mind, that in general, a man had better compound with his neighbor in a quiet and peaceable manner, and give him his coat, although he had previously taken away his cloak, than submit to the manifold evils which may possibly arise from a process in law. But you will say, he may gain the cause, and then—to which it may be replied, he may loose it and <HI>then.</HI>— Farther you may observe, that there are certain cha∣racters, with which you are obliged to be connected occasionally, who are so given to contention that it is next to impossible to keep up an amicable correspon∣dence with them.—They will encroach, deceive, op∣press and pay no conscientious regard to their conduct and engagements. Doubtless there may be such cha∣racters: but if you know them, it must be your own fault, in some measure, if difficulties arise between you and them. It is imprudent to have any great
<PB N="38" REF="030307_0037_0FE5B09C954FCB98"/>intimacy, or much to do with a man of a dishonest contentious spirit. And yet, it must be acknowledged, that it may sometimes be a duty which you owe to the public, as well as to yourself, to oppose his base and dishonest attempts. As, where a man challen∣ges the title you have to your lands, when he might as well claim the lands and tenements of any other neighbor—to oppose, and if possible, suitably punish such a character, so avaricious and wicked, every man ought always to be ready and willing. Such men in neighborhoods and in society, are like foxes and wolves in a flock of sheep: and we have to lament the lot of that man who is obliged to come forward, and to expose them at his own expense. But to a∣void the vexations and expences which unavoidably follow from suits and processes in law, <Q>study to be quiet, and to do your own business—keep your shop, and your shop will keep you.</Q> Avoid tav∣erns, horse-races, shooting-matches and gaming-ta∣bles. Pay all your little, as well as your greater debts punctually. Give your laborers their hard ear∣ned wages daily, or at least, weekly; and close all your accounts with every man, at the close of every year. Use the creatures and goods of your neigh∣bor, when hired, or borrowed, as carefully, or more carefully, than you would if they were your own—be truly charitable, and look upon all men as your bre∣thren. Accustom yourselves to do little savors for your neighbors, and without any expectations, of re∣ward from them. Overlook things said and done by them, when they were angry, mistaken, or heated with liquor. Never attempt to take the advantage of them, however they may expose themselves; but throw the mantle of charity over their weaknesses. Remember that you also are a man; and that benevolence is the law of your nature. Above all things, make it your
<PB N="39" REF="030307_0038_0FE5B09E53F131B0"/>study and endeavour, <HI>to regulate and controul your pas∣sions and appetites.</HI> An example of this kind, may be followed by your neighbors; and if it should, it would put an end to contentions of all kinds; and save you from the expences and vexations of the law; which, though necessary and good in itself, may prove the most permanent source of distress, to those who rashly and wantonly engage in it.</P>

<HEAD>Good Neighborhood.</HEAD>
<P>IT will contribute not a little to the interest and the comfort of the Farmer, to keep up a good corres∣pondence with his neighbors: and to do this, he must keep good fences, orderly cattle, and borrow as little as possible. A great part of the contentions which have taken place among neighbors in the country, some of which have been carried to the most serious and distressing length, will be found, upon ex∣amination, to have originated in poor fences, unruly cattle, and borrowing. A principal object with eve∣ry good Farmer, is the security of his crops; and when he has been at great pains and expence in enclo∣sing his lands on his own part; and his neighbor's cattle, sheep or swine, break in and destroy the fruits of his labors, through the inattention he has paid to his part of the same, it will give him not a little un∣easiness: and repeated inroads, from the same cause, will bring on a coldness, and lead him, at length, to seek a redress, through the disagreeable and expen∣sive medium of law. One unruly ox, horse or sheep, has proved the ruin of all social and friendly inter∣course, between those who had long lived in the most neighborly habits and familiarities; the advantages and pleasure of which, ought not to have been haz∣arded for five times the value of those creatures. And many Farmers, though rich in lands, spend more time in running to their neighbors after saws, ham∣mers, awls, hatchets, a few nails, and a little wire to ring an hog with, &amp;c. than would purchase all those
<PB N="41" REF="030307_0040_0FE5B0A1CAC362E8"/>articles out right. It must be acknowledged, that we are all dependen tupon each other, in a degree; and that every Farmer must borrow, occasionally, or suf∣fer; but obligations of this kind do not arise one half so often from necessity, as from mere carelessness, and a want of a manlike attention to things. But if you must borrow, take care lest you abuse the thing borrowed, and return it immediately after you have done with it; and never depend upon borrowing it, again and again, as many do, but consider with your∣self, whether you cannot make, or afford to buy it. A farmer should endeavor, never to be destitute of meat, meal, butter, cheese, &amp;c. on any day in the year; and it is scarcely honest to live by wearing out his neighbours tools. But although he should avoid borrowing as much as possible, he ought to be wil∣ling to lend to every neighbor who would return the article lent, in good order, and as soon as he should have done with it; and it is a breach of trust, or, to say the least, great neglect in him not to do it. It often proves a great disadvantage to a Farmer, when he has one or two men in his service, and is engaged in a piece of labor, to have one of his tools in this, and a∣nother in that neighbors hands, he scarcely knows where to look for them—borrowed of him, perhaps six, or seven months before, and carried a mile or two out of his way; and which is not an uncommon case. On this branch of the subject I shall only observe far∣ther, that a man ought to lend to every neighbor, worthy of his confidence, whenever he requests the favor, if he can spare the article desired, and to bor∣row of no man, but when pressed by urgent ne∣cessity.</P>
<P>I have observed, that bad fences, and unruly cat∣tle, are often the causes of contention between neigh∣bors,
<PB N="42" REF="030307_0041_0FE5993AD4F478B0"/>and to these fences we may add one or two more, viz. a difference in religious, and in political senti∣ments. In regard to the former, it is the privilege and duty of every man to determine for himself. And no man who lives "soberly, righteously and godly," can be a bad neighbor, under whatever donomina∣tion of christians, he chuses to be considered. To despise such a man, and not to feel interested in his welfare, and not to treat him with all the love and kindness due to a neighbour, although he calls himself a baptist, or a socinian, or an episcopalian, indicates a narrow &amp; contracted mind. And the same observation may be applied in regard to the political sentiments of your neighbor; and who, so long as he continues a quiet and peaceable subject of the government under which you both live, deserves your respect and love and candor; although he does not engage in the in∣terests of the party, which you think proper to pa∣tronize and espouse. I only add, that these subjects deserve a degree of attention, however trifling they may be considered by some? not only, as they may respect the happiness of the present neighborhood in which you live; but as they may affect those who may come after us: for, prejudices and opinion often descendt the third, and even to the fourth generation.</P>

<HEAD>Education.</HEAD>
<P>IT is in the power of almost every Farmer who lives in New-England, to bestow such a degree of e∣ducation on his children and apprentices, as will a∣mount to common reading, writing and arithmetic. And greatly to the dishonor of the father of a family it must be, when his offspring and others under his care, are found to be ignorant of these necessary and important acquisitions. And this is but one part of the charge against such a character: for, neglected through his inattention and want of care on this head, they themselves are most irreparably injured. It is like taking away a right eye, and cutting off the right arm from those whom natural affection, every hour, admonishes him in the most persuasive language, to guard, instruct and foster in his bosom.</P>
<P>Consider this matter in great seriousness—After you are gone off the stage of life, your sons are to come forward and to transact the concerns of the public: They are to compose in part, the legislature of the land in which you now live; and to go through the same or a more important routine of the public services than you have done. But this will be im∣possible unless they have received such a degree of scholastic education, at least, as is commonly bestow∣ed; and which the public, in great wisdom and gen∣erosity offers to every one in this land of light and knowledge. Circumstanced as they are, I can con∣ceive of no apology for those Farmers in New-Eng∣land who do not endeavour to have their children and apprentices instructed in all the more common
<PB N="44" REF="030307_0043_0FE5B0A98D7ED198"/>and necessary branches of knowledge; as the means afforded for these ends are as common as the manna was formerly, which fell round about the tent doors of the Israelites: and of which heavenly food every man might freely gather as much as he wanted, or as much as was necessary.</P>
<P>And yet, through ignorance, covetousness, or some other inimical mean, the children of Farmers are of∣ten brought up like the wild asses colt.</P>
<P>Let me request you, who are parents and heads of families, and who are careless and unconcerned in re∣gard to the instruction and information of those whom GOD has placed under you, to reflect upon your con∣duct; and to consider how you will be able to answer for this criminal neglect to yourselves, to your coun∣try, and to GOD. Consider the days of youthful in∣nocence; in which the mind is ready to receive the most useful impressions; and in which, curiosity, em∣ulation, and a desire of pleasing and excelling, are peculiarly influential: And if you wish to see your sons useful, and your daughters respectable, give them so much education at least, as shall qualify them for the common occupations and offices of the country in which you live.</P>
<P>Do we not say, "we see?" must it not then be un∣pardonable in us if we walk not agreeable to the light of which we boast, and do not endeavor to render, posterity as wise and as happy as we ourselves are? Then let it never be said, that a man, or a woman born and brought up in New-England, can neither read nor write, nor knows any thing of the use and powers of figures. Allow your children time and opportunity for improving in all the common and more useful branches of knowledge. A learned ed∣ucation is out of the question: the writer is plead∣ing only for that measure of information which is re∣ally
<PB N="45" REF="030307_0044_0FE5B0AB1C71C4D0"/>necessary, and which you may, and are in duty bound to bestow upon them. One would think it unnecessary to add any thing more on this subject: but it may not be amiss to observe still farther, that every Farmer ought to be qualified to keep and adjust his own accounts; and which, although tri∣fling in comparison with those of the Merchant, ought, nevertheless, to be attended to with the great∣est exactness, if he would do justice to himself and to his neighbors, and avoid one very fruitful source of contention. I add further, that, as young people in general, when the business of the day is over, will be ready to engage in some pursuits of interest or pleasure, the sous of those Farmers who have been taught to read, write and cypher well, instead of spending their evenings in idleness, or at taverns, may find a most grateful and useful amusement, in the perusal of some good author; in endeavoring to improve their hands in writing; or in revising their past labors in arithmetic. The fact is this, when there comes on a stormy disagreeable change of wea∣ther, and when little or nothing can be done to ad∣vantage on the farm, and many such days occur eve∣ry year, a young man will not be at a loss how to employ those leisure hours to advantage, and to find a most agreeable amusement at home. These neces∣sary accomplishments of a common school education, have proved a source of innocent amusement to many, and been the means of preserving them from various temptations and misfortunes. Therefore, if you regard your own happiness, the innocent amuse∣ments of your children, and their future usefulness, and would guard them against the snares of vice, give them a good common education, at least.</P>

<HEAD>Appendix.</HEAD>
<P>APPLES, for winter, should be gathered by hand —first of October—middle of the day, when fair and dry weather—spread thin on a chamber floor, 'till late in November, then barreled up, and put in a cool place in the cellar.</P>
<P>AUTUMN. In this season cart out your sum∣mer dung; and plough all your land to be seeded the next spring. One ploughing at this time, will answer for one in the spring, when your team is feeble, and save spring labor, which is very precious.</P>
<P>BARLEY ground should be ploughed twice, or three times—sowed early—two bushels to one acre— ploughed in immediately after sowing—no grain is harder to sprout; and none requires more ripening in the field.</P>
<P>BEES. Their house is too well known to need a description. In May and June they generally send forth swarms; and to manage them on these occa∣sions, let your Bee house be made so tall as to admit three tier of hives, one above another. Let the hives be ten inches deep, and 12 or 14 broad. An under hive is made with a round hole through the top, of three inches diameter, covered with a sliding shutter. One of these hives should be placed directly under an inhabited hive, before they are disposed to send out a new swarm. Instead of swarming they will descend
<PB N="47" REF="030307_0046_0FE5B0AFB54FE360"/>into the hive below; and when that is full, let them find another beneath it; they will take possession of the lowermost. They begin at the top and build downwards. When a hive is taken up, instead of destroying the bees, drive in the shutter, and run a long thin knife round, to part it from that which is below it: slip the hive off upon a smooth board, and carry it into your dwelling-house, and open one of the windows of the room, after the hive is laid on its side. This must be done in a cool morning, and when the sun gets up and the air grows warmer, the bees will quit the hive, and go into the hive next to the place whence they were taken. Those bees which are found among the honey, stiff and unable to fly, may be thrown into a tub of water: they will soon recover their activity and go after their companions.</P>
<P>BURNETT grows well on the poorest of ground. One acre will yield three loads of hay—cut it twice— forty bushels of seed to an acre—better than oats for horses—the straw, when threshed, better than com∣mon hay. Burnett keeps green all the winter, and grows—no frost hurts it—may be cut and given to cattle in the spring, as soon as the snow is gone, they will eat it greedily. It may be used fall and spring, as long, and as soon as the ground is bare. It would be proper to have pastures of it.</P>
<P>CABBAGES require moist, rich land. The later taken up the better, in a dry and windy day—set them heads down, 'till carried into the cellar, and then heads up, and close together, where they may have a little frost—warmth soon destroys them.</P>
<P>CALVES for veal, should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the cow— suck only two tits the first week <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> second, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> after the two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> then kill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> ear∣ly as April—have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> twelve
<PB N="48" REF="030307_0047_0FE5B0B25CDCC370"/>weeks. After the first fortnight, mix in skimed milk, or hay tea, or meal and water. When they are a month old, place some sweet hay in cleft sticks, and they will soon learn to eat it. As soon as grass is grown, turn them out—give them milk and water for a few days, and house them for a few nights— they should be housed early in the fall and kept warm in the winter.</P>
<P>CATTLE. If you must pinch them, do it in the beginning, rather than in the close of winter. They feel the first coming of cold weather severely; and the spring may open early. It hurts them to graze in the winter—should be confined to the barn yard, and there watered—will save all their dung. They should be housed in cold rains, which hurt them more than the severest dry cold. To increase manure, some Farmers keep a numerous stock; but the just rule is this, no more cattle than will eat all your fodder. In general, one load of hay will make one load of dung. Estimate your dung by your fodder.</P>
<P>CARROTS, sow on sandy, or loamy land— plough, or dig 12 inches deep—sow last week in April. A little dung sufficient to dress the ground— will yield abundantly—good for fattening cattle, swine and sheep.</P>
<P>CLOVER will grow on any soil—dry, sandy, loamy, or gravelly—bears drought better than any other grass, as it comes forward early, and has a long tap root. Sow ten pounds to an acre—in England they sow twenty—you may bush, or plow it in—it requires less manure than any other grass—mow it in June, when the heads are about half turned, and in the morning. Spread, turn and rake it into cocks before night—next day, open, spread and turn it once or twice, and cock it again; and let it sweat a
<PB N="49" REF="030307_0048_0FE5B0B3EB3D59E8"/>day, or two before housing. This grass requires all your attention in making it—it enriches land—lasts but two years, and is the only hay that will fat an horse without provender. It is most excellent for swine to feed on—one acre of rich land, well set with it, will keep twenty hogs well, from the beginning of May, to the end of October, without any other food: and the swine will enrich the land.</P>
<P>COLT, to break him, never strike, but often lead him by the side of another horse, with a bridle. When he walks well, bring him to trot after him. Then lead him often in the saddle. Then put on a small weight, and gradually increase it. Then let one hold, and another mount him, and ride after another horse, in a ploughed field, 'till he learns the use of the bit, and will stop, or go on at your pleasure. By this easy method you will break your colt, without breaking his spirits.</P>
<P>COW. Great attention should be paid to so pro∣fitable a creature. At the lowest estimate, her value must be more than five pounds per annum. She should be milked morning and evening, at the same time in the day, as near as possible—when near calv∣ing, put her into a pen by herself—when calved, give her warm drink for the first two days—if she does not clean, give her a bucket of warm water, in which some wood ashes have been put—card her gently du∣ring the winter, 'till near the time of her calving, then cease. Keep no more cows than you can feed plentifully, both winter and summer. Rich pastures in summer, will afford an abundance of milk for but∣ter and cheese; and good keeping in winter, will give you fat calves in the spring. Farrow cows should have corn as well as good hay, or milking them for twelve months will render them very thin
<PB N="50" REF="030307_0049_0FE5B0B5CBC69278"/>and poor. In very hot weather cows should be wa∣tered three times in a day, and placed in shady pas∣tures. Farmers should bear it in mind, that a far∣row cow is not so profitable by one third part, as one which calves annually.</P>
<P>CYONS, should be cut in February, or in March, and may be stuck in moist mud, or in clay. They will keep two, or three months: but I prefer those taken immediately from the tree. Avoid suckers.</P>
<P>DUNG. There are several kinds of dung, as there are of soils on which to lay it.</P>
<P>ASHES. Best for low, mossy lands, spread even∣ly on the ground. A few bushels, sowed just before a rain, a good top dressing for an acre—fifteen bushels a full dressing—it will be seen for several years—peat ashes best—fifteen bushels to an acre. DOOR DUNG for mellons—COW-DUNG for a warm, sandy soil. HOGS-DUNG for flax, corn and po∣tatoes, and for all kinds of vines. HORSE-DUNG for a low, wet soil. HUMAN-ORDURE mixed with a great quantity of soil, for cold, sour land, and for recruiting old pear-trees, SHEEP AND FOWLS DUNG, for a wet sour soil. SLAUGH∣TER-HOUSE-DUNG is very excellent. And be∣side these several kinds of dung, there are other ma∣nures, such as LIME, for a cold, stiff clay soil, 120 bushels to an acre—it destroys moss—mixed with green sward, in layers, the composition will be sit for use in six months, in summer. URINE, OR STALE, is also excellent manure, and when saved, of as much value nearly, as the dung itself of the stock. And to save it in SUMMER, as soon as your barn-yard is cleared out, in the spring, take the first leisure hour, and take care to find such an hour, to cart in a large quantity of loom, mud, clay, rubbish, broken peat,
<PB N="51" REF="030307_0050_0FE5B0BB37CB3FB8"/>or even sand; which will absorb the urine, and being mixed with the dung, make a most excellent ma∣nure. In winter, a great part of the stale may be saved, if you have a tight floor, by giving the cattle a plenty of litter: every night a fresh layer of chaff, flax-dressings, or whatever the barn affords. MUD from ponds, in the opinion of some Farmers, is e∣qual to good dung for Indian-corn, planted on a dry, gravelly soil: SEA-MUD also is very good; but all kinds of mud are better when laid in the barn-yard and trodden into the dung and stale of the cat∣tle. They should be shovelled into heaps, and lay a few days before they are carried into the fields for use. Some Farmers have long and narrow cow-yards by the sides of roads, or elsewhere, in which they yard their cattle every night; and every two or three days, they plough them deep. This mixture of soil, dung and stale, is said to be equal to any manure which is made. It must be very good for grass land, spread as soon as the crop is mowed off.</P>
<P>EWES. Breeders should have long and fine wool. From October first, to November twentieth keep the males from them—feed them well for some days before yeaning. Let them have good feed from their first going to pasture, 'till the middle of July— this will make fat lambs, and the ewes themselves will be fit for market.</P>
<P>FLAX, a most useful and profitable crop to the farmer—does best in moist land—at nine pence per pound, one acre will gain six pounds clear profit. After the ground is well manured with old and rot∣ten cow-dung, or with the contents of the hog stye, plough and mix the soil well—it cannot be too much pulverized, and then, in early season, which will give the best coat to the flax, sow from seven to eight pecks of seed on an acre—fresh and new seed every
<PB N="52" REF="030307_0051_0FE5B0BD4AED12C8"/>year, and from a good distance, the crop will be the better. Pull it when the leaves are fallen from the stalk, and when they begin to have a bright yellow co∣lor, and the bolls are just beginning to have a brown∣ish cast. If you water rot it, pull it when the blos∣soms are generally fallen. If you dew rot it, when it is done sufficiently, the coat will separate from the stalk, at the slender branching parts, near the top ends.</P>
<P>FOALS, should be fed when weaned, with sweet hay, oats and wheat bran. For the first winter al∣low one sixteen bushels of oats; afterwards he will do with good hay. A late foal should not be wean∣ed before March, and have oats all winter. Within one month after the foal is dropped, it receives its shape, &amp;c. which it will ever after retain—you may then see your future horse in miniature.</P>
<P>FOWL-MEADOW GRASS does best on low lands, swamps, &amp;c.—keeps green a long time—bears a great burden—is excellent fodder, especially for horses, and may be mowed, from last of July, to first of October.</P>
<P>FODDERING should not take place 'till really necessary; and then only in mornings.—The worst fodder should be given out in the coldest weather.— Never lay so much before your cattle as will serve to fill them—fodder twice in the morning and twice in the evening. The leavings of horned cattle may be laid before horses, and the leavings of horses, before those who divide the hoof; they will eat after each other. If any thing be left in the mangers of the cattle, carry it out into the open air, and spread it on clean snow. Young and hardy stock will winter well on coarse meadow hay and straw. Every farm yard should have a long shed, and a rack under it, in which to fodder in a clean and profitable manner—
<PB N="53" REF="030307_0052_0FE5B0BED5FF7C28"/>very necessary for sheep.</P>
<P>GOOSE more profitable than a dung-hill fowl. Pluck your goose but once in a year, and at moult∣ing time, or when they shed their quills.</P>
<P>GRAZEING. Kill grass fed beeves by the first of November, for, after that the grass soon loses so much of its virtue, that it will not fatten cattle at all —they will fall away.—Vales for tillage, hill for pas∣ture.</P>
<P>HEMP requires a rich and well prepared soil— bears drought well—plough deep in the fall—dung as for indian corn—sow as early as the season and soil will admit—sow the last year's seed, three bushels to an acre. On the last of July pull that which has the flowers on it, when growing yellow at the top, white at the root, and the leaves are withered. Put it into a pond, four or five days when it will be rot∣ted enough: then spread and dry it in the sun. Seed hemp is not ripe till five or six weeks after, when the seeds turn brown: and which must be combed out.</P>
<P>This hemp will require almost three times as much watering as the first. It may be rotted and dressed like flax: when ten, or twelve feet long it may be cut in the middle to make it handy for dressing.— Stalks too thick for the break, may be pealed by hand. Hemp is a profitable crop; is liable to no disease, nor will any creature crop and eat it: and it will grow well in almost any northern climate.</P>
<P>FARM. One hundred acres of land are enough for one—a tenth of that tillage land—much less will do near a market town—small farms are best, when labor is dear—those which afford a plenty of good sweet grass, best for a dairy.—Never overstock your farm—this will prove a great loss to you—better have fodder left in the spring, and lay over for another year—and if you feed close, the soil will soon become bound.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="030307_0053_0FE5B0C0B3CB3B48"/>
HERDS-GRASS, as good and profitable as any, Grows well on any soil, except sandy and gravelly, when mixed with clover, as that decreasses, this increa∣ses, so that the crop of grass will hold out for several years—cut it just before it goes out of blossom, or a little sooner.</P>
<P>HORSE, a good one, high neck, full breast, and a lively eye—strong back, stiff, dark, full buttocks, ribs reaching near to the hips, and rather large hoofs —small horse most profitable: but large ones best for the chaise and plough—horses are great eaters— require the best of hay and pastures—a small farm can hardly keep one—if he labors all summer should be fed with green grass mowed, and brought in a basket, as he wants it—not so much trouble as lead∣ing him one quarter of a mile to pasture—a small spot of long and thick grass, will feed him; for by the time the whole is mowed over, you may begin again. In this manner cows are fed all summer in some places; where the soil is rich—it saves all their dung, and they live well with very little pasture.— This is called SOILING of cattle—in this way, one acre will feed several cows.</P>
<P>INDIAN-CORN improves by standing in the field so long as there is any moisture in the stalk, or even in the cob—should be harvested by the first of November. When it ripens late, and is uncom∣monly green, cut it up close to the ground, and set it up in small shooks in the field; and it will ripen well, and take no damage. In a dry season hoe your corn in the morning and evening. Take your seed out of the middle of your fairest corn—plant no corns with black eyes—put twenty loads of dung on one acre, if spread—eight or ten will do in the hole, and produce a tolerable crop.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="030307_0054_0FE5B0C704ECC1E8"/>
LAMBS, if they cannot come at the teat, cut a∣way the wool and tags—if the ewe will not own him, shut them up together, two or three days, in a close pen. They should not be weaned till seven weeks old; and then have the best of pasture.</P>
<P>LANDS worn out by tillage, may be recruited by seven or eight years pasturing, only ploughing and sowing clover, to be fed, not mowed off. Or you may turn up the green sward, dung it and plant pota∣toes the first year.—Indian-corn, well dunged the second year—lay it down to clover the third year, for two years, plant potatoes the fourth year—flax &amp; corn the fifth year —and then clover. It is not judicious to take two crope of Indian-corn, following each other.</P>
<P>MARES for breeding, should be strong, high spirit∣ed, well shaped, and of a good color—not breed before they are seven years old—go to the horse in the lat∣ter part of June. When with foal, housed early in the fall; fed well till they foal, and not used for two, or three months before that time. They go eleven months, and as many days over that time, as the mare is years old.</P>
<P>MEADOWS must not be fed late in the fall nor early in the spring. Poor water grass should be cut rather before it is grown to its full length, it may be cut a second time.</P>
<P>MOWING late no advantage, as the days grow shorter, and heavies dews fall—but mow close, or you will lose more than your wages every day you mow. Comeings, as they are called, are a disgrace and a loss to the Farmer. Cut the thickest grass first; the thinnest next; and then that which is middling— mow early in the morning, and late in the evening.</P>
<P>MOWING LAND when bound, if not con∣venient to plough it, may receive a severe harrowing. A top dressing of old cow dung in the fall, or of oth∣er
<PB N="56" REF="030307_0055_0FE5B0C8925B1CA8"/>dung in the spring, bushed over to break it small, will increase your crop surprisingly as it will be al∣most double; and all mowing land should be thus treated, once at least in every two years. If you do not dress them, seed off the crop once in three years, never seed them in the spring, nor close at any time. If your lands be rich the drought will have little ef∣fect upon them, and you will often have two good crops in the year. It is not the quantity of land, but the care which is taken of it, that increases hay.</P>
<P>MEASLES in swine, to cure. Take half a spoonfull of spirits of hartshorn, two ounces of bole armoniac, mix it with meal and water, and give it in the morning, fasting or when he is hungry; and repeat it four or five days going.</P>
<P>NURSERY should not be placed on a soil quite so rich, as that on which the young trees are to be transplanted—should not be on a spot where large trees have lately growed; nor on a soil very wet or very dry. To prepare the soil, plough, or dig deep, in the latter part of summer. Plant either seeds, or stones in the latter part of October, Apple seeds may be sowed in the pomace. When two or three years old you may place them in the nursery, in lines three feet apart, trenching in proportion to the length, &amp;c. of their roots; tap roots, and all small fibrous ones to be trimmed off—take up the stock with as many roots as possible—let them be placed in the trenches 12 or 14 inches asunder. Never cut the main branch for the top, side or lateral branches should be pruned off, and in proportion to the roots. Let the stock stand in this position, until they are six or seven feet high— when they will be fit for transplanting into orchards, until which time, hoe, or dig among them every spring and fall—root out all grass and weeds, keep off all suckers and buds.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="030307_0056_0FE5B0CA22206F58"/>
OATS cannot be sowed too early—3 bushels to one acre—the poorer the soil the more seed must be sowed on it—plough them twice—once may do— mow them early, the straw not wholly turned yel∣low. Neither rake nor stir them in the middle of the day or when they are dry—morning and evening best to move them—are apt to shell out.</P>
<P>ONIONS sow on a moist, sandy soil, manure with old rotten cow dung, ashes, or which is better, with soot, sow last week in April—bury the seed one inch deep—middle sized best for use—hoe them three or four times—when all the greenness is gone out of the tops, take them up and lay them in the fun to harden, for eight or ten days—put them in a dry and cool cellar—they bear the cold well—a great spirit in them—sear the small fibrous roots, and they will not sprout.</P>
<P>PARSNIP sow early in March, if possible, in a rich mellow soil—dig eighteen inches deep—set them six inches apart—a little fine manure will answer— they grow 'till the tops are dead, or killed by the frost—Dig them in November—neither snag, nor cut their tops close—no frost hurts them when hous∣ed —keep them cold and covered with dry sand.</P>
<P>PASTURES should be divided into 4, 8, or 12 acre lots, bordered with trees, not fed 'till 20th of May—feed the driest first, and shut it up in 15 days —beat the dung in it; six weeks will recruit it. Every Farmer should have four pastures at least, in the latter part of October the cattle may run through them all in common; keep up the fences all winter—land grows richer by being pastured; these pastures should be mowed once in three or four years, and some mowing lot be fed, seeding pastures in rotation makes one acre better than two not so fed.</P>
<P>PLOUGHING should never be done when the

Always plough in your corn when the dew is on. Plough new lands in the latter part of sum∣mer, that they may rot well. All tillage land should be ploughed in the fall—indian hills split and deep. All above the pan, will become dark earth, in a year or two—never plough an hill up and down, lest it wash and gully away. Ribbing hills, eight or ten feet apart, is beneficial—will catch the rain and re∣tain moisture.</P>
<P>POTATOES. The best grow in a dry soil, but a wet one will yield the most. Plough deep, and the more pulverized the earth, the better the crop; ex∣cept green sward, which produces at one plough∣ing, the greatest crop of any land. Poor land, well cultivated, will yield 100 bushels per acre. Hogs dung, mixed with a great proportion of straw, rub∣bish, &amp;c. excellent manure for them. As they will grow almost any where, they are apt to be neglected; but no crop will pay the Farmer better. Cut seed better than whole; a middling potatoe will give six pieces, with one, or two eyes in each piece: and any part, even the rind, and heart will produce, put three pieces in an hill, six inches apart, and cover them deep. The shooting part of a potatoe, like a tree; the butt end of it, the stump—therefore cut length ways as much as you can, in hoeing do not earth them up too much, and let the last heoing he when they are in blossom; when parboiled, very good for swine, not so good raw—they increase milk in cows. A gentleman in Nova-Scotia used to wash,
<PB N="59" REF="030307_0058_0FE5B0D29C2C43D8"/>and cut them, and give them in plenty to his fat∣tening cattle: he informed me, that a bushed would make a pound of tallow in a creature fo fed.</P>
<P>SOW. If she will not call for the male, give her a little bit of rennet. Feed her for a few days before she pigs, plentifully; it will prevent her devouring them. She should pig in March or April if the pigs are to be reared.</P>
<P>SEEDS not natural to the climate degenerate— should be changed annually, if only from one field to another. A considerable distance better. Flax, and most early seeds, carried 100 miles north, do well—late ones carried as far south, do well also. Corn, barley, oats and seeds of all kinds, should be changed every year; it will pay the Farmer fourfold for all his trouble in doing it.</P>
<P>SHEEP. Buy them, and indeed all cattle, from a soil poorer than your own. Buy large boned ones, with long, fine, greasy wool. Dry land good to feed them on, and so are salt marshes. They go with lamb 20 weeks. One male sufficient for 20 ewes, or more. Propagate those which have large bodies, with long, silky wool. Shady pastures, and free from brush, best for them. The more a sheep drinks the faster she fats. Once fat, kill them, never will be so fat again. Wash them in a warm day, in the middle, or last of June. Let them run three or four days in the pasture, and sweat in their wool, be∣fore you shear them: and then avoid pricking and cutting them. If a cold rain falls soon after shear∣ing, house them. Black wool is never so strong, nor fine, as white.</P>
<P>SALTHAY may be cut one day, cocked the next, and housed the third—throw straw between each layer, in the barn. A portion of it excellent for cattle in the winter.</P>

SPINDLEWORM on Indian corn, is killed by sprinkling the corn with a week lye of wood ashes.</P>
<P>SWINE, profitable. Every family should keep one, to take off the weeds of the garden, and refuse of the kitchen. Carrots good for them—should have a change of diet and be fed in a cleanly manner. Some Farmers throw their corn to them in the dur∣tiest of pens, where it is buried at once in filth, and almost entirely lost. Nothing can be more slovenly. Keep them in a small pasture, or orchard, well fen∣ced and watered; with a close warm stye to retreat to. Keep them always in a middling good plight; yokes prejudicial to them; but no hog should ever be seen without a ring in his nose. Put them up to fatten in September, and kill them middle of Nov∣ember or sooner. He who fats a hog in winter must be a loser—meal better for them than corn—green corn out of the field, excepted. Give them fair wa∣ter for drink—the wash of the kitchen, worse than nothing for fatting hogs. Let them have no more food at a time, than they will eat up clean. If mangy, pour oil on their backs. Give them litter in plenty, and keep their issues open, or they will not fatten. The Chinese breed very good to propa∣gate.</P>
<P>TURKEY. Plunge the chick into cold water, as soon as hatched, or the next day after, and force down one whole pepper corn, &amp; give it to its mother to be brooded, it will be as hardy as the chick of a hen. If they droop while young, view their rumps, and you will find two or three feathers, whose quill parts are filled with blood—draw them, and the chick will soon recover.</P>
<P>TURNIP. Sow on a light, sandy soil, not very rich. New cleared land proper. Sow middle of Ju∣ly, when the ground is moist; not when it is dry.
<PB N="61" REF="030307_0060_0FE5B0D5B5547B28"/>One pound of seed to an acre. House, and bury them in dry sand—it will prevent their growing corky.</P>
<P>WHEAT. Sow one bushel and an half on an a∣cre, on a loamy soil well pulverized. Manure with old dung, and change your seed annually. Wash it before sowing, and sow in the latter part of August, and never when the earth is very dry. Plough it in with a shallow furrow, and leave the land rough. Spring wheat should be sowed as early as possible, and only harrowed in. Never feed grain, unless it be likely to ear out in the fall.</P>
<P>WOOL. Divide it into three parts, or setts.
