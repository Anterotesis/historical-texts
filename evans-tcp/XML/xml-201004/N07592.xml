<P>Quest. 12th. <HI>Since then, by the righteous Judgment of God, we deserve temporal and eternal Punishment, is there no Way by which we may escape that Punishment, and be again received into Favour?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> God will have his Justice<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Ex. 20, 5.</NOTE>. satisfied; and therefore we must make this full<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Rom. 8, 3.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cor. 5, 14.15.</NOTE> Satis∣faction, either by ourselves, or by another.</P>

<P>Quest. 16th. <HI>Why must he be very Man, and also perfectly righteous?</HI></P>

<P>Quest. 40th. <HI>Why was it necessary for Christ to humble himself even to Death?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Because, with respect to the Justice and Truth of God, Satisfaction for our Sins could be made<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Gen. 2, 17.</NOTE> no otherwise than by the Death of the<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Heb. 2, 9.10. Phil. 2, 8.</NOTE> Son of God.</P>

<P>Quest. 42. <HI>Since then Christ died for us, why must we also die?</HI></P>

<P>Quest. 43. <HI>What further Benefit do we receive from the Sacrifice and Death of Christ on the Cross?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> That by Virtue thereof, our Old Man is crucified, dead, and<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Rom. 6, 6.7. &amp;c.</NOTE> buried with Him; that so the corrupt Inclinations of the Flesh may no more<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Rom. 6, 12.</NOTE> reign in us; but that we may<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Rom. 12, 1.</NOTE> offer ourselves unto Him a Sacrifice of Thanksgiving.</P>

<P><PB N="38" REF="009694_0036_0F7785EF1304F138"/>
<HI>Ans.</HI> In forbidding Murder, God teaches us, that He abhors the Causes thereof; such as<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">James 1, 20.

<P>Quest. 107th. <HI>But is it enough that we don't kill any Man in the Manner mentioned above?</HI></P>

<P><HI>Ans.</HI> That all Uncleanness is accursed<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Leviticus 18, 27.</NOTE> of God, and that therefore we must with all our Hearts<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Judges 22, 23.</NOTE> detest the same, and live<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1 Thes. 4, 3.4.</NOTE> chastely and temperately, whether in<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Heb. 13, 4. 1 Corin. 7, 4.9.</NOTE> holy Wedlock, or in a single Life.</P>
<P>Quest. 109th. <HI>Doth God forbid in this Command, only Adultery, and such like gross Sins?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Since both our Body and Soul are Temples of the Holy Ghost, He commands us to preserve them pure and holy; therefore he forbids all unchaste Actions,<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Ephesians 5, 3. 1 Corinthi. 6.18.</NOTE> Gestures, Words, Thoughts,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Matthew 5, 28.</NOTE> Desires, and whatever<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Ephesians 5, 18. 1 Corin. 15, 33.</NOTE> can entice Men thereto.</P>

<P>Quest. 114. <HI>But can those who are con∣verted to God, perfectly keep these Commands?</HI></P>
