<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y Purpose is only to relate Facts, as near as I am capable, from the best In∣formation I could get: But it is pro∣bable there may be some Mistakes from Misinformation, arising from the diffe∣rent Apprehension Men have had concerning Facts, and the different Interests Men have in View: Some having a Desire to render their own, and the Actions of their Friends better than they were, and the Actions of others worse than they ought to appear: Which makes it difficult in every Case to obtain an impartial Account.</P>
<P>On the 15th of <HI>March</HI> 1743, 4, <HI>France</HI> being insti∣gated by <HI>Spain</HI> (which was in open War with <HI>England</HI>) declared War with <HI>Great Britain: France</HI> had in Con∣cert with <HI>Spain</HI> long laid this Scheme; hoping here∣by to bring down <HI>England</HI> to their Will: And the aspiring young <HI>French</HI> Monarch hop'd to make him∣self great; and render his Neighbours low.

<P>But in the Year 1745, <HI>July</HI> 5th, the <HI>Indian</HI> Enemy came to a Place called the <HI>Great Meadow</HI> on <HI>Connecti∣cut River</HI> about sixteen Miles above <HI>Fort-Dummer;</HI> and took one <HI>William Phips</HI> as he was hoeing his Corn. The <HI>two</HI> that took him led him near half a Mile from the Place and stopt: Upon which (as we have heard from the <HI>Indians</HI>) one went down a steep Hill to fetch something they had left: on his Return <HI>Phips</HI> catch'd hold of one of their Guns, shot him down, and then fell upon the other with his Hoe, which he had car∣ried with him; struck him down, and chop'd him very much, and then attempted to run away: But <HI>three Indians</HI> coming up at that Instant, shot him down, kill'd &amp; scalp'd him, &amp; mangled his Body very much: and we have heard, the <HI>Indian</HI> which he wounded with his Hoe, died afterwards of his Wounds.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 10. The same, or some other Party of <HI>Indians,</HI> came to a Place called the <HI>Upper-Ashuelot,</HI> kill'd and scalp'd Deacon <HI>Josiah Fisher,</HI> as he was driving his Cows to the Pasture, about half a Mile from the Garrison.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 11. A considerable Party of <HI>French</HI> &amp; <HI>Indians,</HI> came to a Place called the <HI>Great Meadow;</HI> and made an Attempt on the <HI>Fort,</HI> but did not succeed: But took Mr. <HI>Nehemiah How</HI> Captive, and carried him to <HI>Quebec,</HI> where he died in Prison above a Year after he was taken. As these Enemies went off they kill'd and
<PB N="3" REF="006488_0004_10290F0A9792AEE8" MS="y"/>scalp'd one <HI>David Rugg,</HI> who with another Man was coming down the River in a Canoe; the other Man made his Escape: and they kill'd a Number of Cat∣tle.</P>

<P><HI>April</HI> 19. The Enemy came to the uppermost, and most Frontier Place in <HI>Connecticut River</HI> called <HI>Number Four;</HI> where they took <HI>three Men</HI> as they were going to Mill about half a Mile distant from the Garrison; viz. Capt. <HI>John Spafford, Isaac Parker,</HI> and <HI>Stephen Fainsworth.</HI> They were Prisoners some time in <HI>Canada;</HI> but are since returned to their Homes.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 22. A Man was shot upon between <HI>North∣field</HI> and <HI>Deerfield;</HI> but only shot thro' the Brim of his Hat.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 23. About <HI>fifty</HI> of the <HI>Indian</HI> Enemy came to a Place called the <HI>Upper-Ashuelot</HI> early in the Morning, and designed to have rush'd into the Garrison just after the People went out: But one at a little Distance from the Garrison saw them, and gave Warning to the Peo∣ple.—They pursued those that were out of the Garri∣son, and took one <HI>Nathan Blake</HI> Captive, who after a long Imprisonment is returned to his Friends. The Enemy approached near the Garrison-Gate, shot down one <HI>John Bullard,</HI> who soon died; and stab'd one <HI>Da∣niel McKenny</HI>'s Wife in the Back with a long Knife, who soon died. Soon after which, the Enemy burnt <HI>seven Buildings,</HI> not only to devour the Peoples Substance, but to conceal their Dead; for humane Bones were found in the Ashes: They kill'd also <HI>twenty three Cattle.</HI></P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 26. It is probable some of the same <HI>Indians</HI> Way-laid the Road between <HI>Lunenburg</HI> and <HI>Northfield,</HI> and kill'd and scalp'd one <HI>Joshua Halton</HI> of <HI>Northfield;</HI> who was returning from <HI>Boston</HI> with a considerable Sum of Money for billeting of Soldiers.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="006488_0005_10290EDF21F8EA28" MS="y"/>
<HI>May</HI> 2. The Enemy came again to <HI>Number Four;</HI> and as a few Men went out in the Morning about 50 or 60 <HI>Rods</HI> from the <HI>Fort,</HI> the Enemy lay in a Barn, fired on them; and kill'd one <HI>Seth Putnam:</HI> as the Enemy were scalping of him, Major <HI>Josiah Willard,</HI> with two Men, ran near to them, fir'd upon them, and made them immediately retreat in Confusion: and we hear by the Captives that <HI>two</HI> of the <HI>Enemy</HI> were kill'd as they were scalping <HI>Putnam.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 6. A Party of <HI>Indians</HI> came to <HI>Lower-Ashuelot,</HI> and lay about the Garrison, till they observing Deacon <HI>Timothy Brown</HI> and <HI>Robert Moffet</HI> going out of the Gar∣rison towards <HI>Upper-Ashuelot,</HI> Way-laid them, and fir'd upon them. <HI>Moffet</HI> shot on them and broke the chief Indian's Arm: They were both taken Captive, and carried to <HI>Canada;</HI> but are since returned.</P>
<P>At the <HI>same Time,</HI> a Party lay about the Garrison at the <HI>Upper-Ashuelot;</HI> and as one of them ventur'd to come up to the <HI>Fort,</HI> and shook the Gate in the Night, the Watch shot at the Gate, and shot the <HI>Indian</HI> thro' the bottom of his Belly: who died before he reach'd <HI>Crown Point.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 9. A considerable Party of <HI>Indians</HI> came to <HI>Fall-Town;</HI> with a Design to rush into the <HI>Fort</HI> in the middle of the Day, when the Men were Abroad: but a Soldier a little distant from the <HI>Fort</HI> discovering them, alarmed the <HI>Fort;</HI> but he himself could not recover the <HI>Fort.</HI> There being but <HI>three Men</HI> in the <HI>Fort,</HI> de∣fended themselves; the <HI>Women</HI> assisting in charging the Guns. The Enemy approached near the <HI>Fort;</HI> but were soon repulsed; did no Mischief, except slightly wounding <HI>John Buck,</HI> burning <HI>one House,</HI> and killing <HI>ten Cattle.</HI> The <HI>chief Indian</HI> had his Arm broke, and one or two more were wounded.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="006488_0006_10290F0D80E88370"/>
The <HI>same</HI> Day Serjeant <HI>John Hawks</HI> and <HI>John Mihils,</HI> being a little distant from <HI>Fort-Massachusetts,</HI> riding on a Horse; <HI>two Indians</HI> Way-laid them, fir'd upon them, and wounded both of them. <HI>Mihils</HI> made his Escape to the <HI>Fort.</HI> Serjeant <HI>Hawks</HI> falling from the Horse, the <HI>Indians</HI> ran to scalp him; but he soon re∣covering, presented his Gun: One <HI>Indian</HI> jump'd down the Bank, the other got behind a Tree: one being a little distant from his Gun, the other discharged; in their Language, as we have since heard, called for Quarter; but he not understanding them, continued hallowing to the <HI>Fort</HI> to come and help take them; but they not hearing, the <HI>Indians</HI> made their Escape.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 10. Some of the <HI>Indians,</HI> that were the Day before disappointed at <HI>Fall-Town,</HI> turned off to <HI>Cole∣rain,</HI> about ten Miles <HI>North West</HI> from <HI>Deerfield,</HI> and Way-laid the Road; and as one <HI>Matthew Clark</HI> with his Wife and Daughter, and <HI>three</HI> Soldiers, were going from the Garrison to <HI>Clark</HI>'s House, they fir'd upon them: they kill'd and scalp'd said <HI>Clark,</HI> and wounded his Wife and Daughter: one Solider play'd the Man, fir'd several Times—defended and bro't off the Wo∣man and her Daughter to the <HI>Fort,</HI> who are recovered of their Wounds.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 24. There came a large Body of the Enemy to <HI>Number Four.</HI> Capt. <HI>Pain</HI> with his Troop arriving there while the Enemy lay in Ambush; about <HI>twenty Men</HI> went out of the <HI>Fort</HI> to view the Place where <HI>Putnam</HI> was kill'd: the Ambush rose, fir'd upon them, and endeavour'd to run between them and the <HI>Fort.</HI> Capt. <HI>Stevens</HI> and a Number of Men issued out of the <HI>Fort</HI> for their Relief: a Skirmish began, in which <HI>Aa∣ron Lion, Peter Perrin, Joseph Mercy</HI> of Capt. <HI>Pain</HI>'s Troop; <HI>Samuel Fainsworth,</HI> and <HI>Elijah Allen,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Fort,</HI> were killed: Quarter-Master <HI>Bacon</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="006488_0007_10290EF33A1A5420" MS="y"/>wounded, and Ensign <HI>Obadiah Sartle</HI> taken Captive, who is since returned Home: He says, he saw <HI>five</HI> of the Enemy dead after the Fight: They left thirteen Blankets, five Coats, a Gun and other Things.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 11. A considerable Number of <HI>Indians</HI> came to <HI>Fort-Massachusetts;</HI> fell upon some Men who were at Work some Distance from the <HI>Fort;</HI> kill'd, and scalp'd <HI>Elisha Nims;</HI> wounded <HI>Gershom Hawks:</HI> An Ambush arose near the <HI>Fort,</HI> and endeavoured to in∣tercept those who were running to the Fort, but were repulsed by a brisk firing from the <HI>Fort:</HI> They took <HI>Benjamin Tainter</HI> Captive, who is since returned Home. They kill'd near <HI>One Hundred Creatures</HI> belonging to the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch.</HI> A few Days after, one of the <HI>Indians</HI> was found buried in the Side of the Bank of the River; and also some long Leading-Lines bro't to lead Captives Home in Triumph, were found.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 19. A large Body of the Enemy came again to <HI>Number Four;</HI> and as Capt. <HI>Stevens</HI> and Capt. <HI>Brown,</HI> with about <HI>fifty Men</HI> were going into the Meadow per∣ceived by the Dogs with them, that there was an Am∣bush by the Causey; which put them into a Readiness for an Engagement: One of Capt. <HI>Stevens</HI>'s Men saw one of the Enemy, and fired at him: Upon which, the Ambush arose, and a sharp Engagement ensued: the Enemy were forced to retreat, drawing off their dead Men, as was known by the Signs afterwards discovered: None of our Men were kill'd on the Spot: <HI>Jedidiah Winchel</HI> was wounded, and died of his Wounds a Fort∣night after: <HI>David Parker, Jonathan Stanhope,</HI> and Cornet <HI>Heaton,</HI> were wounded, but are recovered: a Scalp was drop'd by the <HI>Indians,</HI> supposed to be a <HI>French</HI> Scalp: one Gun, eight Blankets, and other Things left by the Enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="006488_0008_1028DC55E0EB2B78"/>
<HI>June</HI> 24. A Party of the Enemy came near to a <HI>Fort</HI> called <HI>Bridgman's-Fort,</HI> about two Miles below <HI>Fort-Dummer:</HI> fell upon some Men at Work in the Meadow, kill'd <HI>William Robbins,</HI> and <HI>James Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r:</HI> and took one <HI>Daniel How,</HI> and <HI>John Beaman</HI> Captive, who just before he was taken shot an <HI>Indian</HI> and kill'd him; they are since returned from Captivity: they also wounded <HI>Michael Gilson,</HI> and <HI>Partrick Ray,</HI> who are recovered of their Wounds.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 3. A small Party of the Enemy laid an Am∣bush at Col. <HI>Hinsdell</HI>'s Mill. Col <HI>Willard</HI> with about <HI>twenty Men</HI> went to get some Grinding: when they set the Mill a going, went to search round the Mill to see whether there were not an Ambush: and some of the Men happening to go where the Ambush was, the Enemy fired upon them: our Men engaged, and pur∣sued them a little Way, and recovered of the Enemy the most of their Packs: one <HI>Wright</HI> was slightly wound∣ed.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 28. <HI>David Morrison</HI> of <HI>Colerain,</HI> a young lad, seeing a Hawk light on a Tree a little distance from his Father's <HI>Fort,</HI> went to shoot him: there hap∣pened to be about <HI>twelve Indians</HI> at the Place, who took him Captive: We have no certain News what became of him.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 3. A large Body of the Enemy came to <HI>Number Four.</HI> The Dogs gave Information that the Enemy were about them: Early in the Morning some went out near to a Nursery, and were fir'd upon by some <HI>Indians</HI> who lay there. One <HI>Phillips</HI> was kill'd: the Enemy run off: our Men charg'd their Guns and returned to the <HI>Fort.</HI> Some time after, when they went to fetch <HI>Phillips</HI> into the <HI>Fort,</HI> the Ambush arose, and fired about an Hundred Guns at them: the Men fired some time, retreating to the <HI>Fort.</HI> The Enemy
<PB N="8" REF="006488_0009_10290EE69490D4E0" MS="y"/>continued firing 'till the next Day: then burnt the Buildings, kill'd the Cattle, and drew off.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 6. About <HI>thirty Indians</HI> came to <HI>Winchester;</HI> Way-laid the Road: and as six of our Men were passing, they fir'd on them, kill'd and scalp'd one <HI>Jo∣seph Rawson,</HI> and slightly wounded <HI>Amasa Wright.</HI></P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 11. A small Party of <HI>Indians</HI> came to <HI>North∣field:</HI> Shot upon <HI>Benjamin Wright</HI> a young Man, as he was riding after Cows to bring them out of the Woods; but his Horse brought him into Town, and he died the following Night.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 15. A Number of <HI>Indians</HI> shot upon <HI>four Men</HI> near <HI>Shattuck's-Fort,</HI> but hurt none. A few Days before, they hung up white Flag in Sight of the <HI>Fort.</HI></P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 17. Some <HI>Indians</HI> came to a Place called <HI>Pequalog;</HI> kill'd and scalp'd one <HI>Ezekiel Wallingford,</HI> who was alone out at some Distance from the <HI>Fort.</HI></P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 20. About <HI>seven</HI> or <HI>eight Hundred</HI> of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> came to <HI>Fort-Massachusetts,</HI> and laid Seige about twenty-four Hours. After which, they desired to speak with the Officer; who admitted the Messen∣ger into the <HI>Fort,</HI> who said in the Name of the Gene∣ral, that if they would surrender, they should be well used. Our Men consulted together, finding they had not Ammunition to stand them many Hours, tho' they had been sparing in firing; and considering the Num∣ber of Sick they had in the Fort, tho't it their wisest Method to make the best Capitulation they could: accordingly resigned themselves Prisoners of War into the Hands of the <HI>French;</HI> with the General's Promise, that none of them should be given into the Hands of the <HI>Indians;</HI> and that the Sick, and such as could not travel should be carried. Yet notwithstanding, He the next Day delivered one Half of our People into the Hands of the <HI>Indians;</HI> who the next Night kill'd <HI>one</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="006488_0010_10290F15D778AAC0"/>of our Men, who was sick, rather than carry him. The <HI>French</HI> treated our Men civilly and tenderly: So also did the <HI>Indians</HI> those with them according to their Manner. <HI>Thirty-two Men, Women</HI> and <HI>Children</HI> sur∣rendred; many of whom died in <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P>The Reason of this Garrison's being lost, was, it's want of Ammunition; which had they been well sup∣ply'd with, they might have defended the <HI>Fort,</HI> and done much greater Spoil on the Enemy than they did: yet we have had Intelligence that near <HI>fifty</HI> of the Ene∣my were kill'd before the <HI>Fort</HI> surrendered.</P>
<P>By whose Neglect the <HI>Fort</HI> was lost, we know not; but it's probable had the Officer been deficient, he would have been disgraced. But want of Ammunition was not only the Calamity of that Fort; but also of the greater Part of our Garrisons at that Time.</P>
<P>There was <HI>one Man</HI> kill'd in the Fight, and many died in Prison at <HI>Canada:</HI> Some are returned Home. And the <HI>Fort</HI> was burnt down; which it cost the Pro∣vince many Hundreds to re-build.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 22. As about ten of our Men were going from <HI>Deerfield</HI> to <HI>Colerain,</HI> two or three <HI>Indians</HI> lying by the Road, fired on them; shot down one <HI>Constant Bliss</HI> a <HI>Connecticut</HI> Soldier: the rest made off as fast as they were able: The Indians scalp'd <HI>Bliss:</HI> and finding some Rum our Men left; the <HI>Indians</HI> took it, got very merry with it, and (as they told afterwards) the next Morning when they awak'd, they were near one of the Garrisons at <HI>Colerain:</HI> The Rum had lik'd to have proved as fatal to them as to our Men.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 25. <HI>Thirty</HI> of this Army came to <HI>Deerfield;</HI> not being satisfied with what was done at <HI>Fort-Massa∣chusetts;</HI> and fell upon some People in the South Part of the Meadow: They kill'd and scalp'd <HI>Samuel Allen, Eleazer Hawks,</HI> Jun. <HI>Oliver Amsden, Simeon Amsden,</HI> of
<PB N="10" REF="006488_0011_10290EE81ACFA9A8"/><HI>Deerfield,</HI> and <HI>Adonjah Gillet,</HI> a Soldier: they wound∣ed <HI>Eunice Allen;</HI> and took <HI>Samuel Allen,</HI> a Child of about nine Years old: <HI>Allen</HI> kill'd one of the Enemy just before he was kill'd; and it is supposed another was kill'd by some other Person.</P>
<P>☞ Had there not been a continual firing in the Town from Day to Day; the People would have took the Alarm, and might have been upon the Enemy before ever they could have got out of the Meadow: Which shews the great Necessity of Order and Disci∣pline in Frontier Towns.</P>
<P>This <HI>Summer</HI> a Proclamation was issued for inlisting Soliders for an Expedition against <HI>Canada:</HI> and a great Number freely inlisted, hoping the Time was coming, that God would deliver us out of the Hands of our Enemies in <HI>Canada:</HI> and the Soldiers especially inlisted out of the Garrisons; some in order to be freed from the Province Service, which they were weary of; others with some more generous Views for the public Good: and all Endeavours to put a Check to the Fury of the Enemy were stopt: the whole Concern was to get ready for the expected Expedition: but how this turned out, we all know: great Numbers of Men kept in Pay and Idleness 'till disbanded, to the Ruin of many of them, and the great Hurt of the Country.</P>

<DIV2 N="1747" TYPE="events of year">
<HEAD>1747.</HEAD>
<P><HI>March</HI> 30. About <HI>thirty</HI> or <HI>forty Indians</HI> came to a <HI>Fort</HI> called <HI>Shattuck</HI>'s-<HI>Fort</HI> between <HI>Northfield</HI> and Col. <HI>Hinsdel</HI>'s, with a Design to burn it: they had made Faggots of dry Spruce &amp; Pitch Pine; dipt the Ends of them in Brimstone; brought Fire in a Kettle covered with a Blanket; and coming silently to the Fort in the Night, set it on Fire; which burnt down <HI>that Part</HI> of it which stood on the <HI>South-Side</HI> of the
<PB N="11" REF="006488_0012_10290F19175F46C0" MS="y"/><HI>Brook:</HI> but presently after the Fire began, the Wind which was Southerly, turning to the Northward, and the Soldiers getting into the other Part, by help of the Brook and Wind, prevented the Progress of the Fire to the <HI>North-Side:</HI> and then the Enemy with Surprize observing the sudden Turn of the Wind, in our Fa∣vour, drew off without doing any other Mischief. The <HI>English</HI> fired at them, &amp; broke the Leg of one of them.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 31. Capt. <HI>Eleazer Melvin</HI> with some of his Company who were then at <HI>Northfield,</HI> pursued them to the <HI>Great Meadow,</HI> shot a-cross the River at them, and kill'd one of them. They burnt the <HI>Fort</HI> which the <HI>English</HI> had deserted.</P>
<P><HI>April.</HI> 7. An Army of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> came to <HI>Number Four,</HI> and laid Siege to the Garrison. Capt. <HI>Stevens</HI> being there with about <HI>thirty</HI> Men, made all necessary Provision for their Defence; especially by digging Trenches from under the <HI>Fort,</HI> about a Yard outwards in several Places, at so near a Distance to each other, as by throwing Water we might put out the Fire, in Case the Enemy by their four Wheel Carriages loaden with Faggots shoul'd set any outward Part of the Fort of Fire. They continued shooting, and throwing their <HI>Fire-Arrows</HI> for near two Days: and then desired to speak with the Captain, who admitted three of them into the Fort; three of our Men going out to the Enemy at the same Time: they demanded the Fort; &amp; promis'd our Men to carry them safe to <HI>Mount-Real,</HI> to their Friends, if they would surrender: but the Captain assured them he should not resign the Fort.— After which they continued firing, and made some Preparation to Storm the Fort, till the next Day; and then they requested the Captain to sell them some Corn; he told them he would grant them five Bushels of Corn for every Hostage they should send into the
<PB N="12" REF="006488_0013_10290EEC4F7F7010" MS="y"/>Fort, to be kept till the Enemy should bring and deli∣ver so many of our Captives from <HI>Canada.</HI> But on the third Day they drew off, having done no Mischief, except slightly wounding <HI>Joseph Ely</HI> and <HI>John Brown.</HI> Governour <HI>Knowles</HI> was so pleased with Capt. <HI>Stevens</HI>'s Conduct, as to make him a Present of a very costly Silver-hilted Sword.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 14. This or another Army came to <HI>Northfield,</HI> with a Design to have taken Part of the Town. The next Day a little after Sun-set, they kill'd and scalp'd <HI>Nathaniel Dickinson</HI> and <HI>Asahel Burt,</HI> as they were bring∣ing Cows out of the Woods; and then drew off in the Night to <HI>Winchester,</HI> and the two <HI>Ashuelots,</HI> &amp; burnt down those three Towns; which a little before had been deserted by the Inhabitants, because the Soldiers were all drawn off without any Orders to assist the In∣habitants in removing or carrying off their Substance:</P>
<P>☞ Such little Concern has there been to the poor People in the Frontiers at other Times as well as this.</P>
<P><HI>May.</HI> 25. As Col. <HI>William Williams</HI> with a consider∣able Body of <HI>Canada-Soldiers</HI> were by Order of the Government re-building <HI>Fort-Massachusetts;</HI> an Army of the Enemy came upon them with a Design to frus∣trate them. Major <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Stockbridge</HI> had been to <HI>Albany</HI> for Stores; and was now on his Return with a Number of Waggons near the Fort: He sent a few Men this Morning to mend the Way, and give No∣tice to the Fort that they were a coming: when they had got within fifty or sixty Rods of the Fort, they saw the Enemy creeping towards the Fort: They fired upon them; which made them discover them∣selves, and fire at our Men who were on the Guard, and at Work; and pursue those who were coming from Major <HI>Williams:</HI> Our Men fired from the Fort, and pursued them at some distance from the Fort;
<PB N="13" REF="006488_0014_10290F1AFB2714E8" MS="y"/>'till the Enemy seemed to aim to get between them and the Fort, and then they retreated. The Enemy kill'd <HI>one Stockbridge-Indian,</HI> and wounded <HI>three</HI> more of our Men, who are since recovered. What Mischief was done upon them is uncertain.—But we have the following Account by the Way of the <HI>Indians</HI>—The Enemy discovered our Men when they went over, and immediately carried News to <HI>Canada:</HI> They sent out an Army of <HI>six Hundred:</HI> when they came near to <HI>Hoosuck,</HI> finding Part of our Men were gone to <HI>Albany, three Hundred</HI> went to Way-lay them; but falling in the Rear, supposed, by the Waggons and Signs of Men, there was a great Army gone from <HI>Albany,</HI> they there∣fore sent away a Post to them at the Fort, to give them Information: Who coming in the Time of the Engagement, was the Cause of their drawing off as they did; and that they lost <HI>Ten</HI> in the Engagement.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 15. About <HI>thirty</HI> or <HI>forty Indians</HI> came to <HI>Fall-Town,</HI> and shot upon <HI>Eliakim Shelden</HI> as he was hoeing Corn in the Field: the escaped to the Fort, but died the Night after.</P>
<P><HI>August.</HI> A Party of <HI>Indians</HI> went to <HI>Ashuelot,</HI> and kill'd three Cattle: Our Men went out after them, shot at them, and they at our Men, but no Mischief was done them.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 26. A Party of the Enemy came to a <HI>Vil∣lage South-West</HI> of <HI>Northampton:</HI> and kill'd and scalp'd <HI>Noah Clark</HI> as he was thrashing in his Barn.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 1. <HI>Peter Boovee,</HI> a Soldier at <HI>Hoosuck,</HI> or <HI>Massachusetts Fort,</HI> went out a Hunting: A Party of the Enemy discovering him, took him Captive, and carried him to <HI>Canada:</HI> He is since returned.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 16. As Major <HI>Willard,</HI> Captain <HI>Alexander,</HI> and others, were coming from <HI>Ashuelot</HI> to <HI>Northfield;</HI> in <HI>Winchester</HI> they met some Cattle running, as tho'
<PB N="14" REF="006488_0015_10290EEF7B7CE990"/>pursued: Captain <HI>Alexander</HI> being foremost, saw a <HI>French</HI> Man in the Path coming towards him: When he saw our Men, he jumped out of the Path behind a Tree. Captain <HI>Alexander</HI> shot at him, and shot him in the Breast: The <HI>French</HI> Man came up to him, saluted him handsomely; but he soon grew faint, and as our Men supposed, was dying: They being afraid the <HI>Indians</HI> were near, made haste and left him: After our Men were gone, the <HI>Indians</HI> came to him, and he revived; they carried him some Way; but fearing the <HI>English</HI> would pursue them, left him; and a few Days after he came into <HI>Northfield,</HI> and resigned himself Prisoner to Captain <HI>Alexander.</HI> After he was healed of his Wound, he was carried to <HI>Boston;</HI> where he was kindly entertained. And in the Month of <HI>February</HI> following, was conducted back to <HI>Canada;</HI> and has been since out with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and done Mis∣chief on our Frontiers.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 19. As <HI>John Smead,</HI> who was taken at <HI>Fort-Massachusetts,</HI> and had just returned from <HI>Canada,</HI> was travelling from <HI>Northfield</HI> to <HI>Sunderland,</HI> was Way-laid by a small Party of <HI>Indians,</HI> and kill'd and scalp'd.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 22. About <HI>forty</HI> of the Enemy came to a Place called <HI>Bridgmans-Fort,</HI> and took one <HI>Jonathan Sartle,</HI> as he was going from Col. <HI>Hinsdel's</HI>-Fort into the Woods. After which they burnt Capt. <HI>Bridgmans</HI>-Fort, House and Barn.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 14. As twelve of our Men were drawing off from <HI>Number Four,</HI> a considerable Party of the Ene∣my Way-laid them within half a Mile of the Garrison; shot upon them, kill'd and scalp'd <HI>Nathaniel Goold</HI> and <HI>Thomas Goodale: Oliver Avery</HI> was wounded, <HI>John Henderson</HI> was taken Captive. It is observable; that the Night before; this <HI>Goodale,</HI> when he met with some Difficulty to obtain Liberty of his Officer to
<PB N="15" REF="006488_0016_10290F1E26A83D80"/>come off, said <Q>he would come notwithstanding all the Powers above &amp; below.</Q></P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 15. The Snow being very deep, and our Men not fearing a small Party of sculking <HI>Indians,</HI> about <HI>eight</HI> of our Men went out about 60 Rods Dis∣tance from Number <HI>Four</HI> to get Wood: The Enemy about <HI>ten</HI> in Number come within 30 Rods of the Fort; run to meet our Men, fired upon them, killed <HI>Charles Stevens,</HI> wounded one <HI>Andreas,</HI> and took <HI>Elea∣zer Priest</HI> Captive. Our Men not having <HI>Snow Shoes</HI> could not run out of the Path and make their Escape: Nor had the Men in the Garrison <HI>Snow Shoes</HI> to pursue them, which the Enemy were informed of by the <HI>French</HI> Prisoner the Month before: For some of the Garrison told him as he went along, <Q>they would gladly accompany him Part of the Way, but they had neither <HI>Indian Shoes</HI> nor <HI>Snow Shoes.</HI></Q> Thus poorly have our Garrisons been stored; whilst many Hundred Pair of <HI>Snow Shoes</HI> lie on Spoil some where or other, which the Province have paid for.</P>

<P><HI>March</HI> 29. About <HI>twelve</HI> or <HI>fifteen Indians</HI> Way-laid the Scout-Path from <HI>Fort Dummer</HI> to <HI>Colerain:</HI> Lieutenant <HI>Sergeant</HI> and <HI>four</HI> more went out in this Path to get some Timber for Oars and Paddles: A∣bout a Mile from <HI>Fort Dummer</HI> they were fired upon; <HI>Moses Cooper</HI> was mortally Wounded the first Shot, and made his Escape to the Fort as fast as he could; he died the next Night: Lieutenant <HI>Sergeant, his Son</HI> and <HI>Joshua Wells</HI> engaged the Enemy, fighting on a Retreat; <HI>Wells</HI> was soon killed; <HI>Sergeant</HI> encouraged his Son; said they should have Help from the Fort: They charged many Times: <HI>Sergeant</HI> shouted as often as the Enemy did, and called upon them to come out
<PB N="16" REF="006488_0017_10290EF614FE6B90"/>and fight boldly. These <HI>two</HI> fought on a Retreat half a Mile; but Lieutenant <HI>Sergeant</HI> was killed, and <HI>his Son</HI> taken: They could not have any Help from the Fort; there being but a few Men there, and some of them sick with the Measels, and others not having <HI>Snow-Shoes</HI> in Readiness, could not go on the Snow.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 16. One <HI>Badcock</HI> was taken at <HI>Paquoig</HI> as he was at Work in his Field.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 8. About <HI>twelve Indians</HI> lay in Ambush near an House at <HI>South Hampton,</HI> and killed one <HI>Noah Pixley.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 21. About <HI>thirty Indians</HI> lay in Ambush near <HI>Fort-Massachusetts,</HI> to take our Men as they should come out towards <HI>Deerfield.</HI> Serjeant <HI>Elisha Chapin</HI> going out from <HI>Deerfield,</HI> with a Number of our Men, went silently along the Road, and came within a few Rods of them. One of the Enemy standing up look∣ing towards the Fort discovered them: <HI>Chapin</HI> suspect∣ing they might be <HI>Stockbridge Indians,</HI> called to them: Upon which the Ambush jump'd up and ran: <HI>Cha∣pin</HI> and <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two</HI> more next to him fired at them and killed <HI>one</HI> of them, and got his Scalp: They left a Gun, the most of their Blankets, and many other Things.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 25. Capt. <HI>Melvin</HI> with <HI>eighteen</HI> Men, who went out after the Enemy, came to the <HI>Lake</HI> a little South of <HI>Crown-Point;</HI> saw two Canoes about 50 or 60 Rods from the Shore, going to <HI>Crown-Point</HI> (these doubtless were the <HI>Indians</HI> who were drove from <HI>Hoo∣suck</HI> the Week before) Capt. <HI>Melvin</HI> and his Company shot 50 or 60 Guns: The <HI>Indians</HI> made a great La∣mentation whilst they were shooting at them: <HI>Crown-Point</HI> immediately took the Alarm; fired their Cannon: And that Night our Men perceived the Ene∣my had got before them in their Way Home. Capt. <HI>Melvin</HI> took a contrary Course, when he come a-cross their Track, so that he escap'd them, 'till he came on
<PB N="17" REF="006488_0018_10290F21D5F27050"/><HI>West-River</HI> on the 31st of <HI>May;</HI> they laid an Ambush on the Bank of the River, where they were satisfied Capt. <HI>Melvin</HI> would come between them and the River: Providence so ordered it that Capt. <HI>Melvin</HI> stop'd with∣in a few Rods of the Muzzles of the Enemies Guns; they fired on him: Our Men jump'd up the Bank, and fired at them; some of our Men that were in the Rear made up the River; our Men fired some Time at them, and suppose they killed several of the Enemy. <HI>Six</HI> of our Men were killed, viz. <HI>Joseph Petty, John How∣ard, John Dod, Daniel Man, Isaac Taylor,</HI> &amp; <HI>Samuel Severance.</HI> Capt. <HI>Melvin</HI> and his Men came in, all but <HI>Six,</HI> at different Times at <HI>Fort Dummer.</HI> This was a surprizing Stroke, and struck a great Damp into the Spirits of our Men who had Thoughts of going into their Country; when they found how far the <HI>Indians</HI> would pursue them to get an Advantage upon them.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 16. A large Body of the Enemy Way-laid the Road between Col <HI>Hinsdell's Fort</HI> and <HI>Fort Dummer: Thirteen</HI> of our Men going from Col. <HI>Hinsdell's</HI> to <HI>Fort Dummer,</HI> were shot upon; <HI>three</HI> were killed on the Spot. Some Time after, the Bones of a Man were found where they lodged the first Night: <HI>Joseph Rich∣ardson, Nathan French,</HI> and <HI>John Frost</HI> were killed on the Spot. The Man that was kill'd where they Lodg'd the first Night is supposed to be <HI>William Bickford;</HI> the rest were taken Captive, except <HI>three</HI> who made their Escape in the Fight.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 26. As Capt. <HI>Humphrey Hobbs</HI> was passing with a Scout of <HI>forty</HI> Men from Number <HI>Four</HI> to <HI>Fort Shirley,</HI> they were pursued by <HI>One Hundred and fifty</HI> of the Enemy: and West of <HI>Fort Dummer,</HI> as our Men stop'd to eat some Victuals, their Guards being out, and the Man set to watch their back Track discovered the Enemy, who gave the Alarm. There immediately
<PB N="18" REF="006488_0019_10290EF7D17302B0"/>began a very hot Fight: The Enemy rushed on very violently; but our Men stood their Ground and gave them a warm Reception: The Fight lasted <HI>four Hours,</HI> in which Time <HI>three</HI> Men were killed, viz. <HI>Samuel Gunn, Ebenezer Mitchel</HI> &amp; <HI>Ely Scot;</HI> &amp; <HI>three</HI> very dangerously wounded, viz. <HI>Samuel Graves,</HI> who was shot in the Head, and some of his Brains came out; <HI>Daniel Mc'Keney</HI> had his Thigh broke; and <HI>Nathan Walker</HI> had his Arm broke, and the Bullet lodged be∣tween the Bones of the Arm: <HI>Ralph Ryce</HI> was slightly Wounded: Capt. <HI>Hobbs</HI> shot the last Gun at the Ene∣my, and is supposed to have killed the <HI>chief Indian</HI> who encouraged them in the Fight. After the Enemy were drawn off, Capt. <HI>Hobbs</HI> brought off his dead and wounded Men; came about half a Mile, and buried his Dead as well as he could in the dark: The next Day he bro't his Wounded into <HI>Fort Dummer,</HI> and the next Day to <HI>Northfield.</HI> The Enemy doubtless lost many; they went off without Shouting, and when some Captives saw them about a Week after, they looked very sorrowful. This was a very manly Fight; and all will grant our Men quitted themselves like Men, who Need not to be ashamed.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 8. A Number of <HI>Indians</HI> came to the <HI>Upper-Ashuelot,</HI> and kill'd eleven Cattle. About the same Time a <HI>Fort</HI> of ours was taken at <HI>Lunenburg; two</HI> Sol∣dier were killed; a Man &amp; Woman &amp; <HI>five</HI> Children were taken Captive, but are since returned.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 14. The Enemy that fought with Capt. <HI>Hobbs</HI> having been as far as <HI>West River,</HI> and left Part of their Company, returned and Way-laid the Road between Col. <HI>Hinsdell's-Fort</HI> &amp; <HI>Fort-Dummer;</HI> and as <HI>seventeen</HI> Men were going to <HI>Fort-Dummer,</HI> were shot upon. Serjeant <HI>Thomas Taylor</HI> commanded the Men to fight them; but the Enemy rushed upon them, killed <HI>two
<PB N="19" REF="006488_0020_10290F235ED4CE98"/>Men</HI> on the Spot, and wounded <HI>two more</HI> whom they carried about a Mile and killed. The Men kil∣led were <HI>Joseph Rose, Asael Graves,</HI> — <HI>Billings,</HI> and — <HI>Chandler: Nine</HI> were taken Prisoners, viz. Serjeant <HI>Thomas Taylor, Thomas Crisson, John Henry,</HI> — <HI>Law∣rence, — Walker, Daniel How,</HI> Jun. — <HI>Edghill, Da∣niel Farmer,</HI> &amp; <HI>Ephraim Powers. Four</HI> escaped; <HI>one</HI> of whom was badly wounded, but is since recovered.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 23. A small Party of the Enemy came to <HI>Northfield,</HI> and Way-laid the Town-Street; and as <HI>Aaron Belden</HI> was going from one Fort to another a little before Sun rise, they shot him down and scalp'd him; and run off into the Woods before any Body was really apprized what was the Matter. <HI>Thus bold and daring had the Enemy grown, before the Cessation of Arms.</HI></P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 1. A Large Body of the Enemy came to <HI>Fort-Massachusetts,</HI> and laid an Ambush: The Dogs made a Rout, which made the Men sensible that the Enemy were there. Capt. <HI>Williams</HI> and the Officers were consulting how to go out, and come upon them in their Ambush; but a few Soldiers ran out without Orders near where the Dogs bark'd: The Enemy a∣rose some few of 'em and fir'd, which caused the Cap∣tain and his Men to rush out; one of the Enemy call'd to the Captain to come along: Our Men went so far, that the Ambush arose partly behind them near∣er the Fort: Our Men stood and fired several Times a-piece without any Thing to shelter them from the Bullets; and retreated firing, to the Fort: In the Fight Lieutenant <HI>Hawley</HI> was shot thro' the Legg, <HI>Ezekiel Wells</HI> had his Thigh broke, but is almost recovered; one <HI>Abbot</HI> was shot thro' the Body, who died in a Day or two; we have heard considerable Spoil was done upon the Enemy. A <HI>Cessation of Arms</HI> being heard of in <HI>Canada,</HI> put a stop to the Enemy's coming out.</P>

<PB N="20" REF="006488_0021_10290EFD6669A610"/>
<HEAD>REMARKS. The following <HI>Remarks</HI> are easy and na∣tural from the preceeding H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>y.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1st. WHAT a great Difference there is between our managing a War, and our Enemies: The most we do is to defend our selves at Home; but they are for an offensive War. And it is true if they have any, they must have this; for a defensive War they can have none with us: For not a Man of ours has seen a <HI>French</HI> Settlement all this War, except such as were carried Captive or went with a Flagg of Truce.</P>
<P N="2">2ndly. It is a rare thing we can obtain an <HI>Indian</HI> Scalp, let us do what Spoil we will upon them; so careful are they to carry off and conceal their Dead. For at <HI>Fort-Massachusetts,</HI> where it is probable near <HI>sixty</HI> have been killed, never have been found more than <HI>three Scalps;</HI> which shows us that our Men will not venture out after the Enemy on any Scalping Act whatsoever: Our Men will not venture their Lives and Service, on such uncertain Encourage∣ments; if they should be much greater than ever they have been. The like is demonstrated at Number <HI>Four,</HI> where they have killed so many of the Enemy, never a Scalp could be recovered.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. We may observe, Of how much Importance the Enemy judge those <HI>two Forts</HI> at Number <HI>Four</HI> and <HI>Hoosuck,</HI> to be to us, Hence their repeated Endeavours to destroy them; which they would not do, were they not advantageous to us, and in their Way in coming upon us.— And it shows how much it must encourage our Enemies, for us to give up either of them.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. We may observe, How safely the Enemy can draw off, when they have done Miscief. I think but <HI>one</HI> Instance has there been all this War of our pursuing, and overtaking the Enemy to do any Spoil on them, and there are many Reasons for it: One is, that no Body may move 'til an Account is sent to the <HI>chief Colonel;</HI> and then Men must be mustered, which takes so long a Time that there is no possibility of our taking them. Another Reason is, that we never have Men near, equipp'd to pursue them in the Woods; and when they have gone a few Miles in the Woods, they are dis∣couraged and return Home.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="21" REF="006488_0022_10290F28CE63B740"/>
5thly. It is observable, That the continual changing of Schemes renders all Measures for the War unsuccessful. Before any one single Scheme is tried, it is flung up, and nothing ever prosecuted to Advantage: There is scarce any one Scheme of more than <HI>six Months</HI> continuance.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. We may observe, That when the Province have voted any Number of Men for a particular Service; by that Time the Commissary can furnish the Men with their Provisions, their Time is expired; and this was the Case the Summer past: It took the greater Part of the Summer to supply the Garrisons with Provisions; they were so scarce: And the <HI>Soldiers</HI> who were designed as Scouts towards <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> were a good Part of their Time employed in guarding Provisions to the <HI>Forts.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7thly. It is observable to all who know the State of these Fron∣tiers, That there is not due Provision made to furnish Men out on any Occasion after the Enemy. There is neither <HI>Bread</HI> nor <HI>Meat, Shoes, Blanketts,</HI> &amp;c, that a Number of Men may take on any sud∣den Occasion. They have their Bread to bake, their Meat to cook, and other Things to get; when they should be on their March: And so long as this is the Case, the Enemy never need fear our annoying of them when they have distressed us.</P>
<P N="8">8thly. It is observable, That all this War we have never kept Men in the Woods towards <HI>Crown-Point</HI> to discover their large Bodies coming down upon us, and give Notice of an approaching Enemy: So that they come securely Week after Week upon us; yea, we have since found that the Enemy have camp'd <HI>several Months</HI> within <HI>thirty</HI> or <HI>forty Miles</HI> of <HI>Fort-Dummer.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9thly. Another Thing observeable, Is the great <HI>Temptation</HI> Sol∣diers have to be <HI>unfaithful</HI> in the Service. For there is no Distinc∣tion made, as to their <HI>Wages,</HI> between a Soldier <HI>posted</HI> in an Old <HI>Town,</HI> one in a <HI>Garrison,</HI> and one <HI>marching</HI> in the Woods; who when he is in the Woods, wears out as many Cloths as his Wages will procure, besides all his Hardships and Sufferings. Soldiers therefore choose to Lodge in the Garrison; and think hard if they must be kept in the Woods, when others have as much Pay in <HI>Old</HI> Towns, who eat and lodge well.</P>
<P N="10">10thly. <HI>We</HI> differ much from the <HI>French</HI> with Respect to the War. They will not give Men Commissions, 'till they have been out in the War and done some Spoil on their Enemies. If the like Method was pactised with us; there would be fewer Commis∣sions,
<PB N="22" REF="006488_0023_10290EFEEF517AC8" MS="y"/>and more its probable would be done on the Enemy, in order to obtain them: But so long as no Regard is had to this in pro∣moting of Men, we can't expect Men will exert themselves as they ought to do.</P>
<P N="11">11thly. The Reader may observe, How much the People in the <HI>Western-Frontiers,</HI> must be distress'd by the War; and how falsely they judge, who think the War is an Advantage to them. Their Case is most distressing: The repeated Alarms take them off from their Business <HI>Day after Day</HI> for <HI>forty</HI> or <HI>fifty</HI> Miles together. And the Reader is to observe, that in the preceeding History there is no mention of great Numbers of Times of the Enemy being seen and shot at, both in the Night and Day Time; and of their setting open Gates, and turning Creatures into Fields to devour Crops. It was not the Design of the Author to give you an Account of the People's Losses; but of the Mischief done: If any envy the In∣habitants in the Frontiers their Portion, they may come and take their Lot with them.</P>
<P N="12">12thly, It ought to be observed, That great Injustice is done the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> in the <HI>Frontiers</HI> in <HI>pressing</HI> them out of their Business, into the Province Service, either to follow the Enemy or convoy Stores, and not rewarding them suitably. They are sent out Day after Day with their Horses, and have <HI>not half</HI> so much per Day as they must give a Man to labour for them in the mean Time.</P>
<P>Lastly, We may observe, Than in this War, as we encreased <HI>our</HI> Number of Men in our <HI>Forts</HI> or <HI>Scouts,</HI> the Enemy have in∣creased <HI>their</HI> Numbers; and the longer the War continued, the oftner they came, and the more bold they grew. Which shows us, what we must expect, if the War breaks out a-new: Especially at this Time, when there is no Provision made for Men in our Frontiers.</P>
