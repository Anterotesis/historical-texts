<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Kingdom of Christ is a subject of great importance: for, accord∣ing to the views we have of that king∣dom will our conclusions be, respecting various branches of religious conduct. If those views be imaginary, these con∣clusions must be false. By the former, the glory of Messiah's regal character will be obscured: by the latter, his worship will be corrupted: whereas the true doctrine concerning this holy empire, may not only be the mean of preserving from those evils, but of pre∣senting us with <HI>data</HI> for the decision of many disputes among the professors of Christianity. A competent acquaint∣ance, therefore, with its nature and laws, its emoluments and honors, is closely connected with our duty and our happiness: which acquaintance must be derived from divine Revelation.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="023213_0003_0FBEDC4624963218"/>
Important, however, as the subject manifestly is, it has been but seldom pro∣fessedly discussed. This consideration was a leading motive to the present at∣tempt. To illustrate the nature of our Lord's Kingdom, and to infer the con∣clusions flowing from it, constitute the design of this Essay.</P>
<P>The author has expressed his thoughts with great freedom; yet without in∣tending the least offence to any party of Christians, or to any person, from whose notions and practices he conscientiously differs. In the course of discussion he animadverts, indeed, on some particu∣lars, with a degree of severity: but then they appear to him in the light of <HI>political artifices,</HI> which either impeach the dominion of Christ in his own king∣dom; or degrade and corrupt that worship which he requires. Now, in cases of this kind, the writer is of opini∣on, that allegiance to the King Messiah,
<PB N="v" REF="023213_0004_0FBEDC4818055E48"/>and true benevolence to man, demand the language of marked opposition.</P>
<P>Such is the nature of our Lord's em∣pire, that few of his loyal subjects can seriously reflect upon it, without feel∣ing themselves both delighted and re∣proved. <HI>Delighted;</HI> because it is for the honor of their Mediator, to be the Sovereign of a spiritual monarchy. A character of this kind apparently suits the dignity of his Person, the design of his mediation, and the riches of his grace.—<HI>Reproved;</HI> because they daily find a want of that spirituality in their affections, and of that heavenly mind∣edness, which become the professed subjects of such a kingdom. When meditating on the characteristics of this holy empire, they stand convicted be∣fore its divine Sovereign of much car∣nality and worldly mindedness, over which they sincerely mourn: while
<PB N="vi" REF="023213_0005_0FBEDC49987CEBC0"/>merely nominal subjects of the King Messiah, or superficial professors of the gracious gospel, are but little concern∣ed about the state of their hearts, in re∣ference to heaven; or with regard to the spirituality of their worship.</P>
<P>This being the case with multitudes, the author would not be much surpri∣sed, were various particulars in the fol∣lowing pages to prove disgusting to the taste of numbers professing godliness. But facts are stubborn things; and the sayings of Jesus Christ must not be ex∣plained away, that conscience may rest in a false peace, or that the public taste may be gratified<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LUTHER says, Potius quam aliquid Regno Christi et Gloriae ejus decedat, ruat non solum pax sed coelum et terra. <HI>Loci Commun.</HI> Class iv. p 35.</NOTE> For, when thinking of our Sublime Sovereign, THY KING∣DOM COME, is the language of every up∣right heart, let carnal professors and the profligate world say what they please.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>IT having been revealed by ancient Prophets, that the Lord Messiah should be a King, and have universal empire, the chosen tribes in every age expected his appearance under the regal character. While, however, the ge∣neral idea of that expectation was fully warranted by the Spirit of prophecy, the bulk of Abraham's natural posterity were under a gross mistake, respecting the true design of their Messiah's ap∣pearance, and the real nature of his kingdom: which mistake had the most pernicious influence upon their temper and conduct, when the gracious pro∣mise of his coming was fulfilled.</P>
<P>The sense which they affixed to pro∣phecies respecting the great Redeemer, was manifestly such as flattered their pride and fostered their carnality. This gave it a decided advantage, in their
<PB N="8" REF="023213_0007_0FBEDC53F4891CA8"/>estimation, over that for which our Lord and his Apostles contended; and led them to overlook whatever in the ancient Oracles opposed their secular views. Ignorant of their spiritual wants, and flushed with a false persua∣sion of interest in Jehovah's peculiar fa∣vor, on the ground of carnal descent from Abraham, and of the Covenant made at Horeb; the doctrine, example, and claims of Christ, were extremely of∣fensive. Not appearing as a temporal prince, discovering no disposition to free them from the Roman yoke, and frequently addressing their consciences with keen reproof, on account of their pride and hypocrisy, superstition and covetousness; they rejected with de∣termined opposition all the evidences of his divine mission, treated him as an im∣postor, and procured his crucifixion.—After he was risen from the dead, and ascended to heaven, multitudes of them indeed believed, and professed the Christian faith: but a great majority of the nation continued in hardened im∣penitence, and persecuted the Apostles with unrelenting malevolence. Thus they proceeded till, divine forbearance being exhausted, <HI>wrath came upon them to the uttermost,</HI> in the total subversion of their civil and ecclesiastical polity.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="023213_0008_0FBEDC54DCE93AD8"/>
This mistake of the Jews, respecting the kingdom of their Messiah, lying at the foundation of all the opposition with which they treated him, and of their own ruin; it behoves us to guard with diligence against every thing which tends to secularize the dominion of Christ: lest, by corrupting the Gos∣pel Oeconomy, we dishonor the Lord Redeemer, and be finally punished as the enemies of his government. Our danger of contracting guilt, and of in∣curring divine sentiment in this way, is far from small. For we are so con∣versant with sensible objects, and so de∣lighted with exterior show, that we are naturally inclined to wish for something in the religion of Jesus, to gratify our carnality. Under the influence of that master prejudice, <HI>the expectation of a temporal kingdom,</HI> Jewish depravity re∣jected Christ; and our corruption, if we be not watchful, may so misrepre∣sent his empire, and oppose his royal prerogatives, as implicitly to say, <HI>We will not have him to rule over us.</HI></P>
<P>Among the numerous admirable say∣ings of Jesus Christ, and of his Apostles, that stand recorded in the New Testa∣ment, and are adapted to instruction in this important subject; there is one
<PB N="10" REF="023213_0009_0FBEDC5654B81B90"/>which deserves peculiar notice. The saying to which I advert, is part of that <HI>good confession</HI> which our Lord witnessed before Pontius Pilate; <HI>My kingdom is not of this world.</HI> A concise, but com∣prehensive declaration, and worthy of him that made it!—This capital saying may be considered as the grand maxim on which he formed his conduct when among men; and it is pregnant with needful instruction to all his disciples, respecting the New Oeconomy and the Christian Church Relative to matters of that kind, there is not, perhaps, a more interesting passage in all the New Testament; nor one which is better adapted to rebuke the pride and carna∣lity of millions who bear the Christian character. To approve of Christ as a spiritual monarch, agreeably to the meaning and tendency of this emphati∣cal text, requires a degree of heavenly mindedness which comparatively few possess.</P>
<P><HI>My kingdom is not of this world,</HI> says Messiah the Prince, when standing be∣fore the Roman governor, and ques∣tioned about his claim of dignity. He boldly avows himself a King; yet, while advancing his title to the honors,
<PB N="11" REF="023213_0010_0FBEDC5877196478"/>of royalty, he tacitly informs Pilate that the civil rights of Cesar had no∣thing to fear from him; and that his own disciples had no advantages to ex∣pect, of a secular kind, as the result of embarking in his cause.—Our Lord, a little while before, had im∣plicitly conveyed the general idea of this declaration, by receiving from a surrounding multitude the acclamati∣ons due to his royal character, when <HI>riding upon an ass:</HI> for while he accept∣ed the honours of royalty, the poverty and meanness of his appearance plainly implied, that his kingdom was not of a temporal kind. Zechariah had fore∣told that the children of Zion should loudly rejoice in this humble manifes∣tation of the King Messiah, and that their joy should kindle into rapture. An incontrovertible evidence that he predicted the public inauguration of a Sovereign, whose <HI>kingdom is not of this world.</HI> For the loyal and affectionate subjects of a political monarch never thought it matter of exultation, that he appeared among them, when pro∣claimed king, with all the marks of meanness and of poverty. Yet so it was in respect of the King Messiah.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="023213_0011_0FBEDC5C6E0DFA60"/>
It is generally allowed, if I mistake not, that the kingdom of Christ is no other than the Gospel Church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Regnum Dei in evangeli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, says WITSIUS, vix alia significatione venit qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ut notet slatum exi∣mium et vere iberum Ecclesioe Testamenti Novi sub Rege Messia Exercitat, in Orat. Dominic. Exercit, ix. § 11.</NOTE>; which is both distinguished from the world, and opposed to it. Relative to this kingdom, and its divine Sovereign, Je∣hovah says; <HI>I have set my King upon my holy hill of Zion.</HI> This prophetic Oracle was fulfilled when our Lord, <HI>leading captivity captive,</HI> ascended on high and sat down on the right of the eternal Fa∣ther. Then was he most solemnly in∣augurated and proclaimed King of the New Testament Church, amidst ador∣ing myraids of attendant angels, and <HI>spirits of just men made perfect.</HI> In pur∣suance of which most grand investiture with his regal office, he distributed royal donatives, at the feast of Pentecost, among his devoted subjects— such do∣natives, as perfectly suited the majesty of his Person, and the nature of his kingdom. Yes, that wonderful assem∣blage of spiritual gifts and heavenly graces, which he bestowed upon his disciples at the Jewish festival, was a
<PB N="13" REF="023213_0012_0FBEDC5E76194228"/>glorious first-fruit of his ascension, and of his being <HI>a priest upon his throne.</HI> The Gospel Church, which is the sub∣ject of his laws, the seat of his govern∣ment, and the object of his care, being surrounded with powerful opposers; he is represented as ruling <HI>in the midst of his enemies.</HI> Nor shall his mediatorial kingdom and administration cease, till all those enemies become his footstool.</P>
<P>The empire of Christ, indeed, extends to every creature: for <HI>all authority in heaven and on earth</HI> is in his hands, and he <HI>is head over all things to the Church.</HI> But the kingdom of which we treat, stands distinguished from that of gene∣ral Providence, as well as from every political state. It must be considered, therefore, as consisting of those persons whom he bought with his blood, whom he calls by his grace, and over whom he reigns as a spiritual monarch. These constitute what is frequently called, the Catholic Church, wherever the favor∣ed individuals may reside. Of such al∣so, or of those who make a credible pro∣fession of being such, all those particu∣lar churches consist, which constitute our Lord's visible kingdom—that king∣dom of which we speak. Into the
<PB N="14" REF="023213_0013_0FBEDC5F5E8D9438"/>principal characteristics of this holy empire, and into the genuine conse∣quences of those criteria, we shall now enquire.</P>
<P><HI>The Gospel Church is a kingdom not of this world, in regard to its origin.</HI> From the time of Nimrod to the present age, secular empires have generally origi∣nated in the vile passions of their first founders: for, in almost every instance, avarice and pride, ambition and a lust of dominion, have been conspicuous.—Not so, in the kingdom of Christ. The remote foundation of his dominion was laid in the counsels of Heaven before time commenced, by all comprehend∣ing wisdom and infinite goodness, for the glory of God and the benefit of man: and the immediate basis on which it stands, is his own vicarious obedience to divine law; both as to its precepts, and as to its penalty. Justice and good∣ness, therefore, are the foundation of his throne. Mercy and truth attend the whole of his administration.</P>
<P><HI>The kingdom of Christ is not of this world, respecting the subjects of his righte∣ous government.</HI> The generality of peo∣ple in all countries, were <HI>born</HI> subjects
<PB N="15" REF="023213_0014_0FBEDC62857CA1F0"/>of those governments under which they lived. No sooner, for instance, were we capable of reflecting upon our ci∣vil connections, than we found our∣selves freeborn subjects of the British crown: and thus it commonly is in the sovereignties of secular princes. Their dominion being confined to the exteri∣or of human conduct, and not reaching the heart; natural birth and local cir∣cumstances constitue subjects of the state, put them under the protection of law, and invest them with civil rights. Such subjects are perfectly well suited to the kingdoms of this world, and to the character of their sovereigns. For, considered as men, kings and subjects are on a level: and, as distinguished by po∣litical characters, their obligations are mutual; allegiance on the one part, and protection on the other.—Besides, temporal kingdoms respect the present world. The mutual duties of sove∣reigns and of subjects, as such, regard the happiness of civil society, and of that only. As an investiture with poli∣tical sovereignty does not constitute a lord of conscience, it gives no claim to authority in spiritual things, but is en∣tirely confined to the concerns of this world. It is, indeed, the indispensable
<PB N="16" REF="023213_0015_0FBEDC63D3CBB020"/>duty of secular princes, and of their people, to love and adore God: yet that obligation does not arise from any political relation subsisting among them, but from their being reasonable crea∣tures. It is also their happiness to be the subjects of Jesus Christ: but that felicity does not result from any thing short of divine mercy exercised upon them, as depraved and guilty crea∣tures.</P>
<P>The kingdom and claims of Christ be∣ing very different from those of Ceasar, the qualifications and obedience of his real subjects must be so too. For per∣sons may be good subjects of a temporal sovereign, and enjoy the rights of such a character, while they are so far from bearing true allegiance to Jesus Christ, as to be quite inimical to his dominion, and entire strangers to the privileges of his kingdom. The empire of Christ <HI>is not of this world:</HI> it is not a temporal, but a spiritual kingdom. Our Lord, there∣fore, is a spiritual sovereign; whose dominion extends to the mind, consci∣ence, and heart, no less than to the ex∣ternal behaviour. Consequently, all the subjects of his government must have spiritual dispositions, and yield spiritual
<PB N="17" REF="023213_0016_0FBEDC6590477330"/>obedience—obedience, proceeding from an enlightened understanding, an awakened conscience, and a renewed heart. For, as is the sovereign, such are the subjects, and such the allegiance required. A spiritual Sovereign, and subjects yielding an obedience merely external, are manifestly incon∣sistent.</P>
<P>As all mankind are born in a state of a postasy from God: as the natural turn of the heart, or <HI>the carnal mind, is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be;</HI> we must be born again—<HI>born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God,</HI> before we are permitted to consider ourselves, or to be considered by others, as the sub∣jects of Him whose kingdom is of a spiritual kind. Remarkable are the words of our Lord, when speaking of his loyal subjects: <HI>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</HI> No: they are described by the Apostles, as being <HI>of the truth; of faith;</HI> and <HI>of God</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xviii. 17. Gal. iii. 7.9. 1. Joh. iv. 4 6.</NOTE> <HI>Of the truth:</HI> enlightened, converted, and sanctified by the gospel. <HI>Of faith:</HI> living by it; deriving peace
<PB N="18" REF="023213_0017_0FBEDC6792F3FD60"/>and holiness from Jesus Christ through believing in him. <HI>Of God:</HI> born of him; or <HI>begotten again to a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.</HI>—Such are the subjects of our Lord's kingdom: in opposition to whom, the New Testament represents the rest of our apostate race, as being <HI>of the works of the law; of the world; of darkness;</HI> and <HI>of the devil</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 10. Joh. viii. 23 1 Joh iv. 5.1 Thess. v. 5. Joh viii, 38.41.44 1 Joh. lii. 8.12.</NOTE> <HI>Of the works of the law;</HI> seeking acceptance with God by their own imperfect obe∣dience, which leaves them under a curse. <HI>Of the world:</HI> carnally minded, and in a state of enmity to God. <HI>Of darkness:</HI> ignorant of their perishing state, and unacquainted with Jesus Christ. <HI>Of the devil:</HI> partakers of his image, subjects of his dominion, and performers of his will<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom, viii, 6, 7, 8. Eph. v. 8. Joh. viii. 44. Eph. ii. 2.</NOTE> So great is the contrast formed by Scripture, be∣tween those who are under our Lord's government, and the rest of mankind! Agreeably to which, real Christians are further described, as <HI>delivered from the power of darkness,</HI> or the tyranny of Satan, and translated into the kingdom
<PB N="19" REF="023213_0018_0FBEDC6C3B2FEE88"/>of God's dear Son: and as being <HI>of God,</HI> while all the rest of the <HI>world lies in wickedness.</HI> None, therefore, but those who are born from above, are the subjects of Jesus Christ: for if the heart be not under his dominion, he reigns not at all as a spiritual monarch.</P>
<P>That none but real Christians sub∣jects of our Lord's kingdom, is yet further apparent from the descriptive characters of those that were members of the apostolic churches. We find them described in the New Testament, as <HI>gladly receiving the word</HI> of grace, as <HI>the called of Jesus Christ,</HI> and as <HI>called to be saints.</HI> The Apostles denominate them <HI>brethren, faithful brethren, holy brethren, saints,</HI> and <HI>lively stones</HI> in the spiritual temple<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 41. Rom. i 6. 1 Cor. i. 2. Eph. i. 1. Philip. i. 1. Col. i. 2. Thess. i 3. Heb. iii. 1.1 Pet. 1. 2, 3. and ii. 5.2 Pet. i. 1.</NOTE> These and similar characters are frequently applied to members of the primitive churches in general; and of those churches the vi∣sible kingdom of Christ then consisted. We may therefore say, with VITRINGA; <Q>The kingdom of grace, in which Christ is king upon mount Zion, is properly and emphatically <HI>the king∣dom
<PB N="20" REF="023213_0019_0FBEDC6D926D0E68"/>of Christ:</HI> of which none are subjects, except those who are cho∣sen, called, faithful, peaceable, and humble; in whom Jesus Christ lives by his Spirit, as in the members of a mystical and spiritual body, of which he is the head<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Observat. Sac.</HI> L V. C. iv.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>This view of our Lord's subjects is perfectly agreeable to the nature and genius of the New Covenant, with which the Messiah's kingdom is closely connected: because it appears, that subjects of any other description, have no reason to consider themselves as covenantees; and it is plain that a di∣vine Covenant must suit the Kingdom to which it belongs, whether Jewish or Christian.—When, <HI>in the fulness of time,</HI> God performed his gracious and comprehensive promise of blessing all nations, it was by the intervention of a New and better Covenant than that which was made at Sinai. For thus it is written: <HI>Behold, the days come, faith the Lord, that I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:</HI> NOT ACCORU∣ING TO THE COVENANT THAT I MADE<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">8. See D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. ERSRINE'S <HI>Theolog. Dissertat.</HI> p. 111—115.</NOTE>
<PB N="21" REF="023213_0020_0FBEDC6F9C927400"/>WITH THEIR FATHERS, IN THE DAY THAT <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>OK THEM BY THE HAND TO BRING <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>HEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT; <HI>which my Covenant they brake although I was an husband unto them, saith the Lord. But this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their ini∣quity, and I will remember their sin no more</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxxi. 31—34. Heb. viii. 8, 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>This admirably gracious Covenant is completely suited to a spiritual king∣dom, and to the subjects we have been describing: for it announces no de∣signs, makes no provisions, confers no blessings, but those that are spiritual, internal, and everlasting. The true knowledge of Jehovah, writing his law in the heart, forgiveness of all sin, and perpetual relation to God, are
<PB N="22" REF="023213_0021_0FBEDC7232D7F208"/>the blessings for which it engages; but there is not a word <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>cting <HI>temporal</HI> blessings, nor concer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng any merely <HI>external relation</HI> to the Great Supreme, though these were <HI>the grand articles</HI> in the Covenant made at Horeb. Covenantees, therefore, under the Christian Oeconomy, can be no other than the spiritual seed of Abraham: and such are the subjects of this king∣dom. Hence the Gospel Covenant is called <HI>new,</HI> and is expressly opposed to the Sinai Confederation, from which it is extremely different. It is also pronounced <HI>a better</HI> Covenant than that which Jehovah made with the ancient Israel: and so it is, whether we consider its objects, its blessings, its confirmation, or its continuance. Its <HI>objects:</HI> for they are the spiritual feed of Abraham, gathered out of all nations. Its <HI>blessings:</HI> for they are all spiritual and internal. Its <HI>confirmation:</HI> for it was ratified by the death of Christ. Its <HI>continuance:</HI> for it is <HI>an everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure.</HI> Yes, it is as much better than the Covenant made at Sinai, as being the children of God by regeneration, is preferable to carnal descent from A∣braham—as the number of God's elect
<PB N="23" REF="023213_0022_0FBEDC770898B6D0"/>in all nations, exceeds that of the cho∣sen t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>—as blessings entirely spi∣ritual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> immortal, are more excel∣lent than those of an earthly kind and of short duration—as redemption from spiritual bondage and eternal ruin, is greater and nobler than deliverance from temporal slavery—as the ratifi∣cation of this Covenant, by the blood of Immanuel, is more sacred than that which the Old Covenant received by the slaughter of brute animals—as the Son of God, the mediator of it, is greater than Moses, who appeared under that character at Horeb—and as a Covenant of everlasting efficacy, that secures the final happiness of all to whom it relates, is better than one of a temporary nature, which was vi∣olated by the covenantees, and is be∣come for ever obsolete. Hence we read, not only of a better <HI>testament,</HI> but also of better <HI>promises,</HI> on which the New Covenant is established; of a better <HI>hope,</HI> introduced by it; of bet∣ter <HI>sacrifices,</HI> by which guilt is expiated; of better <HI>things</HI> provided for the Christ∣ian, than were enjoyed by the Jewish church; and of a better <HI>country</HI> for an inheritance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. viii. 6. vii. 19. ix. 23. xi. 17.40.</NOTE>, than the earthly Ca∣naan,
<PB N="24" REF="023213_0023_0FBEDC78D5D56E88"/>Nay, we are assured by an in∣spired writer, that the Sinai <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>enant and the Mosaic Dispensation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad no glory attending them, compared with that of the New Covenant and of the Messiah's Oeconomy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2. Cor. iii. 7—11.</NOTE>. Now, to this more glorious Covenant, the kingdom of Christ, and the subjects of it, must a∣gree. As, therefore, none but spiritual blessings are contained in that Cove∣nant; so none but real saints are the subjects of our Lord's dominion.</P>
<P>Very different, then, is the kingdom of Christ from the ancient <HI>Israelitish Theocracy.</HI> For, of that Theocracy, all Abraham's natural descendents were true subjects, and properly qualified members of the Jewish church; such only excepted, as had not been circum∣cised according to the order of God, or were guilty of some capital crime. To be an obedient subject of their ci∣vil government, and a complete mem∣ber in their ecclesiastical state, were manifestly the same thing; because, by treating Jehovah as their political sovereign, they avowed him as the true God, and were entitled to all the emo∣luments of their National Covenant.
<PB N="25" REF="023213_0024_0FBEDC7A4ED787B0"/>Under that Oeconomy, Jehovah ac∣knowledged all those for <HI>his people,</HI> and himself as <HI>their God,</HI> who per∣formed an external obedience to his commands, even though in their hearts disaffected to him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judges viii. 23.1 Sam. viii. 6, 7. and xii. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Chron, xxviii. 5. xxix. 23.2 Chron. ix. 8.</NOTE> These prerogatives were enjoyed, independent of sanctify∣ing grace, and of any pretention to it, either in themselves, or in their parents.</P>
<P>The state of things, however, under the New Oeconomy, is extremely dif∣ferent. For the great Proprietor and Lord of the Christian church, having absolutely disclaimed a kingdom that is <HI>of this world,</HI> cannot acknowledge any as the subjects of his government, who do not know and revere him—who do not confide in him, and sincerely love him. Having entirely laid aside those ensigns of political sovereignty, and those marks of external grandeur, which made such a splendid appearance in the Jewish Theocracy; he disdains to be called <HI>the King,</HI> or <HI>the God,</HI> of any person who does not obey and <HI>worship him in spirit and in truth.</HI> Appearing as the head of his church, merely under the
<PB N="26" REF="023213_0025_0FBEDC7E01795990"/>character of a spiritual monarch, over whomsoever he reigns, it is in the un∣derstanding, by the light of his truth; in the conscience, by the force of his authority; and in the heart, by the in∣fluence of his love: for as to all others, his dominion is that of Providence, not that of Grace.—The New Testament affords no more ground for concluding, that our being descended from parents of a certain description, constitutes us the subjects of our Lord's kingdom; than it does to suppose, that carnal descent, in a particular line of ancestry, confers a claim to the character and work of ministers in the same kingdom.</P>
<P>It is of great importance to the right interpretation of many passages in the Old Testament, that this particular be well understood and kept in view, Je∣hovah is very frequently represented as the LORD and GOD of all the ancient Israelites; even where it is manifest that multitudes of them were consider∣ed as destitute of internal piety, and many of them as enormously wicked. How, then, could he be called <HI>their</HI> Lord, and <HI>their</HI> God, in distinction from his relation to Gentiles, (whose crea∣tor, benefactor, and sovereign he was) except on the ground of the Sinai Cove∣nant?
<PB N="27" REF="023213_0026_0FBEDC7FD52CDA48"/>He was THEIR <HI>Lord,</HI> as being the sovereign whom, by a federal transacti∣on, they were bound to obey, in oppo∣sition to every political monarch, who should at any time presume to govern them by laws of his own. He was THEIR <HI>God,</HI> as the only object of holy wor∣ship; and whom, by the same National Covenant, they had solemnly engaged to serve according to his own rule, in opposition to every Pagan idol. But that National relation between Jehovah and Israel being long since dissolved, and the Jew having no prerogative above the Gentile; the nature of the Gospel Oeconomy, and the Messiah's kingdom, abosolutely forbids our sup∣posing, that either Jews or Gentiles are warranted to call the Great Supreme THEIR <HI>Lord,</HI> or THEIR <HI>God,</HI> if they do not yield willing obedience to him, and perform spiritual worship. It is, there∣fore, either for want of understanding, or of considering, the nature, aspect, and influence of the Sinai Constitution, that many persons dream of the New Covenant, in great numbers of places, where Moses and the Prophets had no thought about it; but had the Conven∣tion at Horeb directly in view. It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wing to the same ignorance, or inad∣vertency,
<PB N="28" REF="023213_0027_0FBEDC81D4D5E490"/>that others argue from vari∣ous passages in the Old Testament, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r justification before God by their own obedience, and against the final perse∣verance of real saints. Because, to be entitled to national happiness, by per∣forming the conditions of the Sinai Co∣venant, and to lose that right by back∣sliding into profligacy of manners; are very different things, from obtaining justification before God, and forfeiting an interest in the great Redeemer—so different, that there is no arguing from the one to the other.</P>
<P>Again: As none but real Christians are the subjects of our Lord's kingdom, neither adults, nor infants, can be mem∣bers of the Gospel Church, in virtue of an <HI>external</HI> covenant, or of a <HI>relative</HI> holiness. A striking disparity this, be∣tween the Jewish and the Christian church. Of this difference we may be assured by considering, That a barely relative sanctity, supposes its possessors to be the people of God in a merely ex∣ternal sense: that such an external peo∣ple, supposes an external covenant, or one that relates to exterior con∣duct and temporal blessings: and an external covenant supposes an ex∣ternal king. Now an external king,
<PB N="29" REF="023213_0028_0FBEDC86D708AEC8"/>is a political sovereign: but such is not our Lord Jesus Christ, not yet the divine Father. Once, indeed, it was otherwise: for, concerning the Israelitish nation, it is thus written; <HI>I,</HI> Jehovah, <HI>will be thy king. Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you. Jehovah shall rule over you. Jehovah, your God, was your king</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hosea xiii. 10. Judges viii 23. 1 Sam. xii. 12.</NOTE> It was the peculiar honor and happiness of Israel, to have a Sovereign who was the only object of their worship. For thus the Psalmist sings; <HI>Blessed is the nation, whose</HI> (king) JEHOVAH <HI>is their God</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ps. xxxiii. 12 and cxliv. 15. <HI>Heb.</HI> See the Sep∣tuagint Version, and that of JUNIUS and TRE∣MELLIUS; together with POLI. <HI>Synops.</HI> and VE∣NEMA <HI>Comment.</HI> in loc.</NOTE> <HI>!</HI> Hence Jeho∣vah's complaint; <HI>They have rejected me, that I should not reign over them</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. viii. 7.</NOTE> Yes, Jehovah, as a temporal monarch, stood related to the ancient Israelites, and entered into a federal transaction with them at Sinai, not only as the Ob∣ject of their worship, but as their King. their judicial and civil insti∣tutes, their laws of war and of peace, various orders respecting the land they occupied, and the annual acknow∣ledgments to the great Proprietor of
<PB N="30" REF="023213_0029_0FBEDC87D8251F30"/>it, were all from God, as their politi∣cal sovereign. Hence all the natural posterity of Abraham were Jehovah's people, on the ground of an external covenant made with the whole nation.</P>
<P>The children of Israel, being distin∣guished from the Gentile world, by a system of ceremonial precepts, and their divine Sovereign residing among them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere denominated <HI>a holy nation:</HI> for that external sanctity which they pos∣sessed, seems to have arisen, partly from their <HI>National Covenant,</HI> and partly from their having <HI>the Divine Presence,</HI> among them. By the former, they renounced idolatry in all its forms, and gave up themselves to Jehovah in op∣position to the false objects of Pagan worship; which separation to the ser∣vice of God, is denominated <HI>holiness.</HI> By the latter, they had a kind of local nearness to God, which conferred a relative sanctity; as appears by various instances. When, for example, Moses with astonishment beheld the burning bush, the ground on which he stood was pronounced <HI>holy,</HI> because of Jeho∣vah's peculiar presence there. Thus it was in the case of Joshua: and so in regard to the place of our Lord's trans∣figuration; for Peter calls it <HI>the</HI> HOLY,
<PB N="31" REF="023213_0030_0FBEDC8A016ED628"/><HI>mount</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. iii. 5. Josh. v. 15.2 Pet. i. 18.</NOTE> And why was part of the an∣cient sanctuary called <HI>the most holy place?</HI> but because Jehovah in a singular man∣ner, and under a visible emblem, dwelt there. Hence it is manifest, that the Divine Presence, whether under the form of an <HI>august personage,</HI> as in the case of Joshua; or under the emblem of <HI>devouring fire,</HI> as in the bush, and up∣on mount Sinai<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Exod. xix. 18.</NOTE>; or under the milder appearance of <HI>a luminous cloud,</HI> as over the mercy seat, and at our Lord's trans∣figuration, confers a relative holiness. It is also equally plain, that this mira∣culous presence of God being with∣drawn from the several places to which we have just adverted, they have now no more holiness than any other part of the earth.</P>
<P>So the Israelites, being separated from all other nations for the worship of Jehovah as their God, to the exclusi∣on of all idolatry; avowing subjection to him as their king, in contradistincti∣on to all other sovereigns; and he resi∣ding among them in the sanctuary, as in his royal palace; there was a rela∣tive

Besides, it is plain that the external symbol of Jehovah's presence, was a sufficient indication of God's <HI>glory</HI> in the tabernacle. Thus the holiness of the people, equally as that of places, was derived from the ex∣ternal presence of God<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dissertat. Sac. L. ii. C. iii. § 6.</NOTE></Q>—Now, as the Divine Presence had a local, vi∣sible residence over the mercy-seat, which was the throne of Jehovah; as that Presence among the Israelites had such an extensive operation upon their state, both in respect of privilege and of duty; as the whole nation was a

<P>Under the Gospel Dispensation, how∣ever, these peculiarities have no exist∣ence. For Christ has not made an external covenant with any people. He is not the king of any particular nation. He dwells not in a palace made with hands. His throne is in the heavenly sanctuary; nor does he af∣ford his visible Presence in any place upon earth. The partition wall be∣tween Jews and Gentiles has long been demolished: and, consequently, our divine Sovereign does not stand related to any people, or to any person, so as to confer a relative sanctity, or to pro∣duce an external holiness</P>

Now so long as political relation subsisted between the Son of God and the seed of Abraham, an exter∣nal holiness continued, as resulting from that relation. But though this foundation of relative sanctity was not removed till the death of Christ, there is no intimation in the Evangeli∣cal History of any one being entitled to a New Testament rite, or to the cha∣racter of a subject in the Messiah's kingdom, in virtue of that holiness.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">198. <HI>Dissertat, Sac.</HI> L.

<P>The Covenant made at Horeb having long been obsolete, all its peculiarities are vanished away: among which, re∣lative sanctity made a conspicuous figure. That National Constitution being abolished, Jehovah's political so∣vereignty is at an end. The covenant therefore now in force, and the royal relation of our Lord to the church, are entirely spiritual. All that external holiness of persons, of places, and of things, which existed under the Old Oeconomy, is gone for ever: so that if the professors of Christianity do 'not possess a real, internal sanctity, they have none at all.—The National Con∣federation at Sinai is expressly contras∣ted, in holy Scripture, with the New Covenant<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxxi. 31—34. Heb. viii. 7—13.</NOTE>: and though the latter ma∣nifestly provides for internal holiness, respecting all the covenante, yet it says not a word about relative sanctity. And, indeed, how should it? since, by its commencement, the whole Sinai Constitution became obsolete; the
<PB N="37" REF="023213_0036_0FBEDC988F63BE38"/>partition wall was broken down; the special relation between God and A∣braham's natural seed ceased, and left no difference of a religious kind be∣tween Jews and Gentiles—no differ∣ence, in respect of nearness to God and communion with him, except that which regeneration and faith in Christ produce. For, under the pre∣sent Dispensation, <HI>Christ is all in all.</HI> We may therefore safely conclude, that were the Jews converted and re∣settled in Palestine, both they and their infant offspring would be as entirely destitute of the ancient relative holi∣ness, as those Mahommedans are who now reside in that country.</P>
<P>But did an external holiness now exist, we should be obliged to consider it as very different from that of the ancient Israelites: for it appears, by what has been said, that the grounds of their exterior sanctity make no part of the Christian Oeconomy. Besides, their holiness extended to the whole nation: but in what Utopia shall we find all the inhabitants possessed of this relative purity? Theirs continued as long as they lived; except they com∣mitted
<PB N="38" REF="023213_0037_0FBEDC9F556F4630"/>some enormous crime, by which they forfeited their lives, or were cast out of the congregation. for it did not wear out by age, nor was it lost merely by continuing in a state of un∣regeneracy. Whereas, that external holiness for which so many plead, is not generally considered by them as extending beyond the time of infancy. —But why should any contend for the relative holiness of infants, who deny a sanctity of that kind, to places of worship, clerical habits, and various other things? for it is plain that the Jewish external purity, whether of persons, of places, or of things, ori∣ginated in the same National Cove∣nant, and in the same relation of God to Israel: and, consequently, must have the same duration in one case, as in another. We may therefore justly conclude, that the federal and relative holiness of which so many speak, nei∣ther agrees with the laws of Judaism, nor with the nature of Christianity. But if so, it cannot belong to the kingdom of Christ.</P>
<P>Further: If all the subjects of Christ he real saints, it may be justly queried whether any <HI>National religious esta∣blishment</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="023213_0038_0FBEDCA09EDA73E8"/>can be a part of his kingdom. That multitudes of individuals be∣longing to such establishments are sub∣jects of the King Messiah, is cheer∣fully granted: but is it not plain, that a National church is inimical to the spirit of our Lord's declaration. <HI>My kingdom is not of this world?</HI> Does not that comprehensive and important say∣ing compel us to view the church and the world in a <HI>contrasled</HI> point of light? And does not the idea of a Na∣tional church lead us to <HI>confound</HI> them?

Thus Bp. LATIMER, in his Sermon of the <HI>Plough:</HI> "This much I dare say, that since <HI>lording</HI> and loitering hath come up, preach∣ing hath come down, contrary to the Apostles times.

Well, well. Is this their duty? Is this their office? Is this their calling? Should we have ministers of the church comptrollers of the mints?

<P><PB N="43" REF="023213_0042_0FBEDCAC259CAD68"/>
The tenor of the New Testament, however, agreeably to our Lord's maxim, leads us to consider particular churches as Congregational; and as consisting of those who make a credi∣ble profession of repentance and faith. Such congregations, wherever they be, constitute the visible kingdom of Christ.—That the apostolic churches were Congregational, is clear from the sacred Records; and that there was no National church for the first three hundred years, is equally evident. Because there could not be any such establishment, till the civil govern∣ment of some nation or other professed Christianity; which was not the case before CONSTANTINE ascended the Im∣perial throne. Then, indeed, a kind of political Christianity came into fashion, which has continued ever
<PB N="44" REF="023213_0043_0FBEDCAD5E5D6830"/>since, and is yet in great repute. Nor are National churches likely to fail, while the policy of sovereign princes, and the pride of aspiring prelates can support them. But, being established by human laws, and each of them ac∣knowledging a visible head, either civil or ecclesiastical, either prince or pon∣tiff; they are secular kingdoms, and unworthy the name of Christian churches.</P>
<P>Once more: As none but regenerate persons belong to the kingdom of Christ, no one is a better subject of his dominion, or a more honorable mem∣ber of his church, on account of <HI>wealth</HI> or <HI>power,</HI> of <HI>parts</HI> or <HI>learning.</HI> These things, though useful in their places, of much reputation to a secular empire, and of great consequence to it; nei∣ther pertain to the true glory of a Christian church, nor to the sterling worth of a Christian character. For what concern have worldly wealth and civil power, informing a spiritual cha∣racter, or in adorning a spiritual king∣dom? The greatest affluence and the highest authority that mortals can en∣joy, add nothing to any one's moral worth. No one is a better man, be∣cause
<PB N="45" REF="023213_0044_0FBEDCAED57DC520"/>he is rich and powerful; nor the worse, because he is poor and in a low station. These things are all exterior to moral character. For the most li∣centious are often exalted and wealthy, while the most upright and amiable are lost in obscurity and oppressed with want Besides, when wealth, or pow∣er, is possessed by a true subject of our Lord's kingdom, the honor attending his character does not arise from his riches, or his authority; but from the holiness of his life, or his likeness to Je∣sus Christ.</P>
<P>As our British Sovereign is the foun∣tain of honor to all his subjects, even so is the King Messiah to all that are under his dominion. The only way however to be great and honorable in his kingdom, is to be humble, diligent, and useful, in promoting the happi∣ness of our fellow Christians and fellow creatures. For among the fundamental laws of Messiah's empire, the following is one, and it relates to comparative honor: <HI>Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and who∣soever will be chief among you, let him be your servant. Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to mi∣nister,
<PB N="46" REF="023213_0045_0FBEDCB3E82D2800"/>and to give his life a ransom for many</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt xx. 26, 27. Mark x. 42—45.</NOTE> This being the law of honor, and the rule of promotion, in the king∣dom of Christ, we may safely conclude, that the meanest domestic may be a dig∣nified character in a gospel church, and <HI>adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour:</HI> while his wealthy and powerful master, professing the same faith, may disgrace the name of a Christian, and bring re∣proach on the congregation to which he belongs. If the former be diligent and faithful in his menial station: if he be <HI>sound in the faith,</HI> zealous for God, and heavenly minded; he is an honor∣able subject of Jesus Christ, and high in the estimation of Heaven. If, on the contrary, the latter be formal in his re∣ligious profession; if he be unjust or haughty, voluptuous or covetous; he does not belong to the kingdom of Christ, but is manifestly a subject of Satan.</P>
<P>Nor do the most shining mental ac∣complishments, or literary acquisitions, enter into the true glory of this king∣dom. Genius and learning, like wealth and power, are frequently possessed by
<PB N="47" REF="023213_0046_0FBEDCB60BCB9F70"/>the worst of moral characters. They cannot, therefore, make any part of that excellence by which the subjects of Jesus Christ are distinguished from those secular princes. It is not by the gifts of common Providence, among which parts and learning make a con∣spicuous figure; but by the graces of the Holy Spirit, that any person, as a Christian, is worthy of regard.—Yes, it is faith in Christ, and obedience to him; love to God, and benevolence to man; humility, patience, and resig∣nation; spirituality, and heavenly mind∣edness, which adorn the subjects of our Lord's kingdom—which distinguish them from the children of this world. These, and similar things, respect the state of the conscience, and of the heart. They form a character for eternity, and savour of the heavenly world. Where∣as, learning and parts, equally as wealth and power, are quite of a differ∣ent nature. The distinction they make between one another is entirely super∣ficial, and often disgraced by a profli∣gate heart—belongs only to this world, and has no connection with heaven. But as will appear in its proper place, the kingdom of Christ is nearly allied to heaven—is a state of preparation for
<PB N="48" REF="023213_0047_0FBEDCB8AF5343D0"/>that sublime blessedness, an introduction to its employments, and gives an earnest of its fruitions Consequently, the true glory of that kingdom cannot but con∣sist, in the lively exercise of holy tem∣pers and heavenly affections. The more there is of a likeness to heaven, in the heart and life of any Christian; the more there is of that <HI>honor which comes from God,</HI> and the more is the cause of Christ adorned.—To be a real subject of this kingdom, is a much greater honor than merely to be a Prophet, or an A∣postle. For Balaam was the former, and Judas was the later; yet both of them were base and wretched <HI>Rejoice not that the devils are subject to you; but rather rejoice that your names are writ∣ten in heaven. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels,—and though I have the gift of prophecy, and under∣stand all mysteries and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could re∣move mountains, and have no charity, I am nothing,</HI> in the estimate of a spiritual Sovereign, or in reference to the hea∣venly state.</P>
<P>No minister of the word, therefore, when performing his public work, should ever think of exalting himself as an officer in this kingdom, by dis∣playing
<PB N="49" REF="023213_0048_0FBEDCBAD97CEAE8"/>his learning, his genius, or his eloquence; for that would be to <HI>preach himself, not Christ Jesus the Lord:</HI> but, as <HI>in the sight of God,</HI> he should honestly aim at <HI>commending himself to every man's conscience, by manifestation of the truth.</HI> Then will he imitate a first rate minister in the Messiah's kingdom, and obtain the approbation of his divine Sove∣reign.—Besides, in the displays of pro∣found learning, by critical disquisitions; of great acumen, by metaphysical spe∣culations; or of a sparkling genius, by agreeable turns of wit. Christ and con∣science feel their interests but little concerned. The former is too obser∣vant of the preacher's motives, and too jealous of his own honor, to be pleas∣ed with such a procedure; and the lat∣ter is either too sleepy to be aroused, or too much pained to receive relief, by those means. If our Lord consider himself as honored by the preacher's labours, and if the minister have any reason to expect success, it must be by a faithful and simple promulgation of revealed truths—those truths which regard supreme authority in the divine law, and saving grace in the glorious gospel—those truths, I will add, which
<PB N="50" REF="023213_0049_0FBEDCBC668684B0"/>lie open to common capacities. If the conscience receive advantage, it is by the operation of the same truths; ei∣ther as convincing of sin and enforcing duty, or as revealing pardon and af∣fording peace. But the honor of Christ and the tranquility of conscience are seldom promoted, in a public ministry, by the researches of learning, or the refinements of genius: for they are too sacred, and too spiritual, to ac∣knowledge their obligations to such things.</P>
<P><HI>The kingdom of Christ is not of this world, with regard to the means he em∣ployed in its first establishment, and those he appointed for its enlargement and sup∣port.</HI> Craft and violence, injustice and cruelty, have been commonly used in the founding, supporting, and extend∣ing of secular kingdoms. The Roman empire was founded, and grew to its height, in blood. Even the Jewish republic was established, enlarged, and defended by force of arms. The Ca∣naanitish nations, on account of their enormous wickedness, were extermi∣nated by the sword of Israel; or, if spared by the chosen tribes, became <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>butary to them. This, though ac∣cording
<PB N="51" REF="023213_0050_0FBEDCBDCF918110"/>to Jehovah's appointment, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the great Proprietor of the whole earth; and though a righteous execution of punishment, for acts of rebellion against the Eternal Sovereign; was a plain indication that, in various res∣pects, the Israelitish church was a kingdom of this world. Such also was that kingdom of the Messiah which the carnal Jews in our Lord's time vainly expected, whenever the great promise made to their fathers should be fulfilled: for they dreamed of being exalted to the highest pitch of political grandeur, and of having all the other nations un∣der their control.—The principle instruments employed by princes, to establish, maintain, and extend their do∣minions, are—not persons the most re∣markable for integrity and benevo∣lence, for piety and philanthropy; but those who are most eminent for politi∣cal prudence, or martial bravery; for secret intrigue, or open hostility— those who are best qualified to per∣suade by eloquence, to circumvent by cunning, or to subdue by force.</P>
<P>But the most illustrious instruments employed by our Anointed Prince in the erecting of his monarchy, were of a
<PB N="52" REF="023213_0051_0FBEDCC50DFF38B0"/>character quite the reverse. They were chiefly selected from the lower orders of life, and called from occupa∣tions esteemed mean. Uneducated in the courts of royalty, in the schools of learning, or in the field of war; they were strangers to the finesse of politici∣ans, little acquainted with Gentile phi∣losophy, and unpractised in the art of eloquence. It may be justly presum∣ed, therefore, that a strong degree of rusticity appeared in their dress, their aspect, and their accent: for they were apparently <HI>unlearned and unpolished men.</HI> So ignorant were they of sciences cal∣led liberal, so unpolite in their address, and so uncanonical in their garb, that multitudes called Christians, it is highly probable, would be ashamed to give them a hearing, were they now present among us; unless the public attention were first excited, by the exercise of their miraculous powers.—Yes, by the instrumentality of those unlettered and plain men did our Lord erect his king∣dom, or establish the gospel church. In making war upon Satan's empire, evangelical truth and spiritual gifts, laborious preaching and ardent prayer, fortitude, patience, and a holy exam∣ple, were the arms they used. Such
<PB N="53" REF="023213_0052_0FBEDCC61F08DAD0"/>were the militia, and such the armour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> employed by our divine Sovereign; yet perfectly suited to the nature of his kingdom. For it is an empire, not of secular power and external pomp; but of truth and of righteousness, of love and of peace.</P>
<P>Were the Messiah's kingdom <HI>of this world,</HI> his loyal subjects might lawful∣ly take the sword, to repel assailants and subdue his enemies: for without the liberty of such defence, no secular state can long subsi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. This, however, he absolutely po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibited: which prohibi∣tion is founded in the peculiar nature of his kingdom. For thus he speaks, to one who thought of defending his per∣son and cause by force; <HI>Put up thy sword into the sheath.</HI> Soon after, on another occasion, he said; <HI>If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews. but now is my kingdom not from hence</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh. xviii. 11, 36.</NOTE> As by the particle <HI>now,</HI> our spiritual So∣vereign apparently refers to his king∣dom among the Jews, so he seems to distinguish his dominion in the gospel church, from that over the Israelitish nation.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="023213_0053_0FBEDCC797E33430"/>
In former times, the Holy Spirit fre∣quently came upon the subjects of Je∣hovah's government, to inspire them with martial courage for the defence of his kingdom, and to destroy his enemies. Hence, among the ancient worthies, we read of those who <HI>subdued kingdoms, waxed valiant in fight, and put to flight the armies of the aliens.</HI> But the disciples of Christ being called to a different kind of conflict, divine energy is granted for a different purpose. The military service of a Christian, as, such, is entire∣ly of a spiritual nature. It is a <HI>good fight of faith: a striving against sin,</HI> in himself, and in the world around him: a <HI>holding fast the profession of his faith,</HI> in spite of all opposition. The Christian hero is conformed to the captain of salvation, in maintaining the truth, and in bearing the cross; in enduring the contradiction of sinners, and in despi∣sing the shame that is cast upon him. His accoutrements are, as Paul informs us, <HI>The girdle of truth,</HI> and <HI>the breast∣plate of righteousness; the shield of faith, and hemlet of hope,</HI> and <HI>the sword of the Spirit,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephes. vi. 10—18. 1 Thess. v. 8.2 Cor▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 3, 4, 5.</NOTE> Such is the armour provided by the King Messiah for his devoted
<PB N="55" REF="023213_0054_0FBEDCC910AE3F98"/>subjects; by which they are enabled to defend themselves, and to promote the general interests of his kingdom. This holy empire depends not upon power, wealth, or learning, either for ornament or support. <HI>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Je∣hovah.</HI></P>
<P>Neither the force of <HI>secular power,</HI> nor the arts of <HI>carnal policy,</HI> ought there∣fore to be used in promoting the cause of Christ: such things being quite ab∣horrent from his intention, and from the nature of his kingdom. The great design of our Lord in founding a Spiri∣tual empire was, to display the perfec∣tions of God in the holiness and happi∣ness of his chosen people. The king∣dom of Christ, as before observed, is a dominion of truth and of rectitude, of love and of peace. Now the interests of such a monarchy, and the end pro∣posed by it, cannot be promoted by any other than spiritual means, and those of divine appointment. It is only so far as the minds of men are enlightened by heavenly truth, their consciences impressed with God's authority, and their hearts engaged on spiritual things, that the cause of Christ is advanced.
<PB N="56" REF="023213_0055_0FBEDCD16A483800"/>But in what way shall persecuting force be applied, to irradiate the dark under∣standing, to arouse the stupid consci∣ence, and to sanctify the depraved heart? It is only by the fruits of an adoring af∣fection for God, of sincere love to the brethren, and of cordial good will to all mankind, that our Lord is honored, or his end answered, by the subjects of his dominion. How, then, shall coercive measures increase those fruits of holi∣ness? Or how shall malevolence, in any of its infernal forms, be employed to support a kingdom of love and of peace.</P>
<P>Nor are the contrivances of <HI>carnal policy</HI> less foreign to the nature of this kingdom, than the exertions of secular power. For what has the policy of princes, or of prelates, to do in main∣taining; or in extending, and empire of truth and of rectitude? Truth seeks no subterfuge, and rectitude fears no exa∣mination: but the operations of policy are subtle, and its first designs are latent. The policy of great men may form ci∣vil establishments of Christianity, and adorn the exterior of public worship. It may dignify ministers of the word with pompous titles, unknown to the
<PB N="57" REF="023213_0056_0FBEDCD311B19E08"/>New Testament, and invest them with temporal power, till their claim of suc∣ceeding to the Apostles becomes an in∣sult upon common sense. These and similar things may be effected by it, un∣der the fair pretext of rendering reli∣gion respectable, and of making it more general: but the empire of Jesus Christ disdains them all, because they belong to the kingdoms of this world.</P>
<P>But though our Lord neither needs, nor accepts, the puny arts of men, to advance his cause and support his inter∣ests; yet various methods have been devised by acclesiastics, to obviate <HI>the offence of the cross,</HI> to render themselves respectable, and to promote something called <HI>Christianity.</HI> That they might not be thought, like the Fishermen of Galilee, <HI>unlearned and ignorant</HI> persons, they have eagerly sought literary tiles, and to be called <HI>Rabbi.</HI> To adorn the ministerial office, and to sanction their administrations, they have been as care∣ful as Jewish priests to appear in cano∣nicals. To prevent the pride of their hearers being disgusted, certain humi∣liating truths have been kept out of sight; and that the consciences of others might not be pained, softening in∣terpretations
<PB N="58" REF="023213_0057_0FBEDCD45F969028"/>of divine precepts have been given. To stand free from a sus∣picion of bigotry, the importance of capital truths has been surrendered; and to keep fair with something called <HI>charity,</HI> it has been agreed that human inventions should hold the place of di∣vine institutions.—Many of the clerical character, in our National Establish∣ment, have deliberately subscribed what they did not believe; solemnly professed their consent to what they could not approve; and frequently practised, as part of their public devo∣tions, what they were constrained to wish had never existed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For can any man upon earth really believe <HI>all</HI> that in contained in the <HI>Thirty Nine Articles,</HI> and cordially approve of <HI>every thing</HI> contained in the <HI>Book of Common Prayer?</HI></NOTE>.

Some, of different communions, have deliberately acted as if the preacher's work were a mere trial of skill, and as if a pulpit were the stage of a harlequin. To display the fertility of their inven∣tion, they have selected for texts mere scraps of scripture language; which, so far from containing complete pro∣positions, have not, in their dislocated state conveyed a single idea. Upon these they have harangued; while the ignorant multitude have been greatly surprised that the preacher could find so much, where common capacities per∣ceived nothing.—Sometimes these men
<PB N="61" REF="023213_0060_0FBEDCDD0D34F758"/>of genius will choose passages of Scrip∣ture expressive of plain historical facts, which have no connection with the great work of salvation by Jesus Christ; and handle them (not professedly by way of accommodation, for then it might be admitted) but as if they were <HI>sacred allegories.</HI> Such historical facts being <HI>spiritualized,</HI> as they love to call it, doctrines, privileges, duties, in abundance, are easily derived from them. Nay, so ingenious are preachers of this turn, that it is no hard matter for them to find a great part of their creed in almost any text they take. Thus they allego<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ze common sense into pious absurdity.—It might, per∣haps, be too barefaced, though it would certainly suit the vanity of such preach∣ers, were they frequently to address their hearers on the pronominal mo∣nosyllable <HI>I:</HI> and there are two passa∣ges of sacred Writ where it occurs in the most apposite manner.

Others, and often the same persons, frequently use the gestures of the theatre, and the language of a mountebank: as if their business were to amuse, to entertain, and to make their hearers laugh. Extravagant attitudes and quaint expressions, idle stories and similies quite ludicrous, appear in abun∣dance, and constitute no small part of the entertainment furnished by such characters. But in what a state must the consciences of those preachers be, who can deliberately and with preme∣diation
<PB N="63" REF="023213_0062_0FBEDCDFF9ECC7F8"/>act in this manner! Or, what must we think of their petitions for di∣vine assistance, in addressing the peo∣ple, when they intend thus to treat them!—I called it <HI>entertainment;</HI> and, surely, they themselves do not consider it in a religious point of light. For can any man, who is not insane delibe∣rately adopt measures of this kind, when really aiming, either to produce, or to promote, a devotional and hea∣venly temper in the hearts of his hear∣ers? Yet that is the general end of preaching. Or can the preacher have any devotion, while showing the ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of a mountebank; and when, if the bulk of his auditory had no more de∣cency than himself, there would be a burst of laughter throughout the assem∣bly? Whatever such declaimers may think, where there is no solemnity, there is no devotion: and, we may venture to add, that a person habitually destitute of devotion in his own heart, while pretending to teach others the doctrine of Christ, is a wretched cha∣racter in the sight of God, and has rea∣son to tremble. Such a man serves not our Lord Jesus Christ, but his own in∣terests, in some form or other. He may wish for popularity, and perhaps may,
<PB N="64" REF="023213_0063_0FBEDCE12A97D2E8"/>obtain it from the ignorant multitude; but people of sense and of piety will consider him as disgracing his office, as affronting their understandings, and as insulting the majesty of that Divine Pre∣sence in which he stands. For where, upon earth, are we to expect solemnity, if not in the pulpit? There, a man should be serious and solemn as death.</P>
<P>It may perhads be said; <Q>This kind of trifling has its use. It is a mean of exciting curiosity, and of draw∣ing many to hear the gospel, who might not otherwise have the least inclination so to do.</Q> Such, I pre∣sume, is the chief reason by which preachers of this cast endeavour to jus∣tify themselves at the bar of their own consciences. In answer to which, a re∣petition of that capital saving, <HI>My king∣dom is not of this world,</HI> might be suffici∣ent: for that must be a wretched cause, even of a secular kind, which needs buffoonery to support it. To trifle in the service of God, is to be profane. It is, therefore, an impious kind of tri∣fling: and <HI>shall we do evil that good may come?</HI>—Through the interference of Providence, and the sovereign grace of God, various instances of enormous
<PB N="65" REF="023213_0064_0FBEDCE426E0CA10"/>wickedness have issued in the highest good to mankind. Of this we have un∣doubted evidence in the selling of Jo∣seph by his envious brethren. We have a still more striking instance in the death of Christ, through the treachery of Judas and malice of the Jews. Nay, persecu∣tion has <HI>frequently</HI> been an occasion of spreading the gospel: yet few, I take it for granted, have persecuted for that end, or attempted to justify the prac∣tice upon that principle.

<P>Conformable to this idea of that Su∣blime Being whom every preacher pro∣fesses to serve, was the conduct of Paul when dispensing the gospel. For, in opposition to some who <HI>handled the word of God deceitfully,</HI> to amuse the carnal and win their affections; he la∣boured, <HI>by manifestation of the truth,</HI> to <HI>commend himself to every man's consci∣ence,</HI> as <HI>in the sight of God.</HI> Truth, con∣science, and God! What facred and solemn ideas! Yet Paul, as a preacher, habitually acted under their influence. That evangelical truth might be display ed, that the human conscience might be impressed, and that the will of God
<PB N="67" REF="023213_0066_0FBEDCEAF67187D0"/>might be performed, were all included in his design▪ How foreign are these particulars from every thing of a farci∣cal nature! Nor, can any person who considers himself, when preaching the word, as having eternal truth for the subject of his discourse, the conscien∣ces of men for the objects of his regard, and the omnicient God for a witness of his conduct; be otherwise than solemn: for such an one will speak, as knowing that he <HI>must give an account.</HI>—When hearing a minister who acts in charac∣ter, and copies the example of Paul, we are led to reflect on that ancient oracle; <HI>I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me,</HI> to perform sacred service. But when sitting under the effusions of a pul∣pit buffoon, the language of an Egypti∣an tyrant occurs to remembrance; <HI>Who is Jehovah, that I should obey him?</HI> or what is his worship, that I should treat it with reverence?</P>
<P>When a sermon was expected from Peter, by Cornelius and his friends, the centurion expressed himself thus: <HI>We are all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</HI> These Gentiles, it is manifest, were pe∣netrated with devout solemnity, and
<PB N="68" REF="023213_0067_0FBEDCEC6B000E80"/>filled with holy expectation. Not be∣ing assembled for carnal amusement, but in order to know and perform the will of God; they considered them∣selves as in the Divine Presence: and so did their inspired teacher. A wor∣thy example for us to follow, when convened to preach and to hear the word of truth. But how contrary to this is that pulpit drollery, which is the object of our censure! For it converts the solemn service of God (shocking metamorphosis!) into carnal amuse∣ment, upon which numbers indeed at∣tend with pleasure, but with no more devotion than if they were in a play∣house.</P>
<P>Is there any raeson to be surprised that men of sense, who are already pre∣judiced against the genuine gospel, should have their disaffection to evan∣gelical truths increased, when they find those truths avowed, and their impor∣tance loudly urged, by merry andrews? If, instead of <HI>sound speech, which cannot be condemned,</HI> they meet with extrava∣gance and nonsense, what will thy say? Is there any reason to wonder, that In∣fidels should thence take occasion to re∣dicule the Scripture, as calculated to
<PB N="69" REF="023213_0068_0FBEDCEDCFE0DD78"/>serve the meanest purposes; or that they should contemptuously call preaching <HI>priest craft?</HI> If those who profess to love revealed truths dress them up in a fool's coat, for the enter∣tainment of their hearers, will Deists forbear to laugh?

Of this mind was an old Nonconformist minister, when he said; <Q>Of all preaching in the world I hate that most, which has a tendency to make the hearers laugh; or to affect their minds with such levity as stage-plays do, instead
<PB N="70" REF="023213_0069_0FBEDCF39DA4AF20"/>of affecting them with an holy reve∣rence for the name of God.

But if the kingdom be of a spiritual kind, the sovereign must be so too. His laws must extend no less to the conscience, than to the conversation, and be enfor∣ced by sanctions of a spiritual nature. Such is the King Messiah, and such are the laws of his kingdom.</P>
<P>The subjects of our divine Sovereign may be considered, either as detatched individuals, or as united in distinct so∣cieties,
<PB N="72" REF="023213_0071_0FBEDCF6CFE27B88"/>and visibly professing their sub∣jection to his authority. Hence the execution of those laws by which they are governed, comes under a twofold consideration. <HI>As detatched individuals,</HI> the application of his laws to particu∣lar cases, is entirely with him, and with the conscience of each individual. <HI>As united in distinct societies,</HI> which are called particular churches, his laws of admission, of worship, and of exclusion, are to be applied by the community— applied, not under the influence of car∣nal motives, but under the operation of his authority, and for purposes entirely spiritual.</P>
<P>By the laws of this kingdom, a credi∣ble profession of repentance and faith is required of all, previous to baptism. Such profession being considered as an evidence of their <HI>fellowship in the gospel,</HI> and of willing subjection to the autho∣rity of Christ, they are entitled to mem∣bership in a particular church. On this ground they are admitted: nor do they forfeit their membership, except by some capital departure from <HI>that</HI> gospel, or some flagrant offence against <HI>this</HI> authority.—But as, by the laws of our heavenly Sovereign, their admission
<PB N="73" REF="023213_0072_0FBEDCFB21561A78"/>to visible fellowship was entirely for spiritual purposes, their exclusion from it does not include temporal disadvan∣tages Their situation as men, and as the subjects of a political state, not be∣ing altered by their church-relation commencing; they should not be af∣fected, in those respects, by the disso∣lution of that relation. For as the laws of Christ say nothing about the ad∣mission of one or another, on account of his domestic or civil connections; nor yet for his wealth or influence, his parts or learning; so they are equally silent about pecuniary fines and satisfac∣tory penances, about civil disabilities and corporal punishments, attending the exclusion of any offender. The former being quite foreign to qualifi∣cations for a spiritual kingdom, the lat∣ter must be utterly abhorrent from the laws by which it is governed; being manifestly the inventions of Antichrist, and the supporters of his cruel throne. Civil penalties, in this case, are adapted to generate fear, and promote hypo∣crisy; to suppress truth, and render Christianity itself suspicious.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="023213_0073_0FBEDCFD99162268"/>
Here we perceive another disparity between the Jewish and the Christian church. For under the Old Oecono∣my, the laws of religion were sanctified by <HI>temporal politics,</HI> and frequently those of the severest kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Exod, xii. 53, 19. xxx. 33, 38 xxxi. 14. Lev. vii. 20—27. xvii. 3—9. xix. 8. xxiii. 27, 28, 29. Numb. ix. 13. xv. 30, 31. xix. 13. with ma∣ny other similar places.</NOTE> To be cast out of the congregation, to be forbid∣den access to the sanctuary worship, (except for ceremonial pollution) was to be deprived, not only of ecclesiasti∣cal privileges, but also of civil rights. The church and the state being coex∣tended, and including the same persons, an exclusion from the former was an expulsion from the latter; whether it was by a sentence of capital punish∣ment, or in some other way. But this, like many other things, was peculiar to that Dispensation. It was founded in the-National form of their church-state, and in their Theocracy. Thence it was that blasphemy and idolatry were punished with death, as being high-treason against their divine Sovereign. That Oeconomy being abolished, the church of God has taken a new form. <HI>The priesthood being changed, there is of
<PB N="75" REF="023213_0074_0FBEDCFF0ECABE40"/>necessity a change also of the law,</HI> relating to the constitution, members, and go∣vernment of the church. The laws of admission, and of exclusion, must there∣fore be very different; as well as those pertaining to public worship. Now, to understand these laws, we must study—not the Pentateuch of Moses; much less the <HI>Provinciale</HI> of LYNDWOOD, or the <HI>Codex</HI> of GIBSON, but—the New Testament of Jesus Christ. To reason from the constitution and form, the laws and government, the privileges and rites of the Jewish, to those of the chris∣tian church; is to adopt a capital principle of Papal depravity, and gross∣ly to corrupt our holy religion.</P>
<P>Our divine Sovereign has also pro∣vided for the edification of his loyal subjects, by ordinances and rites of worship, no less than for the govern∣ment of his kingdom. As King of the Christian church, it constitutes a distin∣guished part of his royal prerogative, to prescribe the whole of that spiritual service which is to be performed. Of this prerogative Jehovah was always jealous: nor, under the former Oeco∣nomy, did he ever more instantly, or more severely punish, than when his
<PB N="76" REF="023213_0075_0FBEDD008E486EE0"/>orders about the affairs of religion were disregarded; even though, as in the case of Uzzah, the motive appeared laudable.—What is religion, in its va∣rious branches, but that obedience which is due to God? And what is obe∣dience, but submission to his authority? Now, as authority exerts itself in com∣mands, there cannot be obedience, there cannot be holy worship, where there is no divine command, either explicit or implicit. <HI>Who hath required this at your hands? In vain do ye worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men</HI>—exclude and condemn a great number of things, which millions esteem ornamental and useful in the worship of God.</P>
<P>Strange, that any Protestant church should avowedly claim a <Q>power to decree rites or ceremonies</Q> in the solemn service of our divine Lord! As if he were not the legislator in his own kingdom! Or as if, though possessed of authority, he had not wis∣dom enough to provide for his own honor; or were defective in goodness, respecting his faithful subjects! But whatever the compilers and the sub∣scribers of a National Creed may
<PB N="77" REF="023213_0076_0FBEDD06D371A170"/>think, to perform rites which Christ did not appoint, and to alter those which he enjoined, are vile impeach∣ments of his royal character, and must expose to his resentment. The former usurps his throne: the latter annuls his laws.—<HI>Strange,</HI> did I say? the ex∣pression must be recalled. For there is no reason to wonder that a National reli∣gious establishment, with a political so∣vereign for its head, should make the claim I have just mentioned. Who can doubt whether the same authority which constitutes, governs, and supports a community for any particular purpose, may not prescribe to that community with a view to the end intended by it? But things should not be called by wrong names; and to denominate such an esta∣blishment <HI>a church of Christ,</HI> is a gross misnomer.</P>
<P><HI>The kingdom of Christ is not like the em∣pires of this world, in regard to external splendor.</HI> The grandeur of a temporal kingdom chiefly consists, in the number and affluence of its nobility, the titles and pompous appearance of its various magistrates, the flourishing state of its trade and commerce, the wealth of its
<PB N="78" REF="023213_0077_0FBEDD0816DF1E28"/>yeomanry, and the elegance of its pub∣lic buildings. Magnificent palaces and royal robes are quite in character for secular princes. Ensigns of honor, splendid equipages, and stately mansi∣ons, are suitable to the nobles: while a more solemn kind of exterior pomp is very becoming the ministers of public justice. These and similar things give an air of dignity, and of importance, to political sovereignties: but they are all foreign to the kingdom of Christ, the glory of which is entirely spiritual—The Christian Church is dignified and adorned, by being the depositary of di∣vine truth in its unadulterated state, and by practising divine appointments in their primitive purity; by possessing the beauties of holiness, and by enjoy∣ing the presence of God. Such is the true glory of our Lord's kingdom, which renders it incomparably superior to every temporal monarchy.</P>
<P>It must therefore be very absurd to think of doing honor to Christianity, by erecting <HI>pompous places</HI> of worship, by <HI>consecrating</HI> those places, and by adorn∣ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mith <HI>showy vestments,</HI> in the per∣formance of public worship. Let the galaces of princes, and the mansions of
<PB N="79" REF="023213_0078_0FBEDD098E3F7218"/>the mighty, be magnificent and richly ornamented; let the nobles and judges of the land, when acting agreeably to their different characters, appear in robes of state and in robes of magistracy; as those things belong to the kingdoms <HI>of this world,</HI> nor pretend to any thing more, there is nothing amiss, nothing in∣consistent with station or profession. But confine them there, and by no means think of decorating the kingdom, or of promoting the cause of Christ, by any thing similar. Were any man to lacker gold, and paint the diamond, to increase their lustre, he would certainly be consi∣dered as insane Yet the conduct of those persons is more absurd, who borrow the trappings of secular kingdoms, to adorn the spiritual kingdom of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>As to <HI>places of worship,</HI> conveniency is all that is wanted, and all that be∣comes the simplicity of Christianity. To lay the first stone of such an edifice with solemn formalities, is Jewish<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezra. iii. 10.11.</NOTE>: to de∣dicate it, when completed, to any par∣ticular saint, is manifestly superstitious: to consecrate it by any solemn form; looks as if it succeeded to the honors of
<PB N="80" REF="023213_0079_0FBEDD0EE9342050"/>Solomon's temple; as if the Deity were expected to reside in it, rather than grant his presence to the congregation worshipping there; and as if it were to possess a relative holiness, like that of the ancient sanctuary. I may venture to add, that any religious parade at the first opening of such a place, is apparent∣ly inconsistent with the idea of all dis∣tinction of places, in regard to worship, being abolished, and too much resem∣bles a Jewish, or a Popish consecration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I will here subjoin a few particulars mentioned by Mr. <HI>James Owen,</HI> relative to Consecrations. He shows, that the Israelites dedicated not only the ta∣bernacle and temple, but also their private houses, and their cities (Deut. xx. <HI>5.</HI> Psalm xxx. <HI>title.</HI> Nehem. xii. 27.)—That the Jewish synagogues were not consecrated, nor esteemed holy, as the temple was—That the consecration of places for Christian worship was invented in the time of <HI>Con∣stantine</HI>—That Christians had not long been in pos∣session of consecrated temples, before they thought it expedient to furnish them with altars; and be∣ing provided with altars, they afterwards invented the sacrifice of the mass—That the Papists, like the old Pagan Romans, first consecrate the ground, and then the edifice erected upon it—That <HI>Durandus</HI> argues for the consecration of churches, from the example of Nebuchadnezzar dedicating his golden image—That Roman Catholics consecrate, with va∣rious and solemn formalities, the first foundation stone of a building intended for public worship—That they consecrate bells, priests-garments, and almost every thing belonging to their corrupted worship—That though in England, since the Reformation▪ it does not appear that any Form for the consecrating of churches, and of burying grounds, has received the sanction of public autho∣rity; yet various Forms for those purposes have been published and used—That the consecrating bishop <HI>blesses</HI> the church or chapel, and prays <Q>that that the blessed Spirit would send down on the <HI>place, his sanctifying power and grace</HI></Q>—That he consecrates the font, the pulpit, the reading-desk, the communion table, the paten, the chalice, and so on. <HI>Hist. of Consecrat. of Altars, Temples, and Churches,</HI> passim.</NOTE>.</P>

In regard to <HI>ministers,</HI> when attend∣ing to any branch of their holy functi∣on, let them not think of heightening their own importance, or of promo∣ting the cause of Christ, by imitating Jewish or pagan priests, adorned with peculiar habits, when performing their different rites. If Christian ministers be decently clothed, when in their own families, when visiting their friends, or when walking the streets; why should they not be considered as properly ha∣bited for the performance of their sa∣cred office? What reason can be as∣signed for the use of any particular dress, when engaged in public service, that would not militate against the spi∣rituality of our Lord's kingdom, and the simplicity of his worship?</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="023213_0081_0FBEDD11EA7BD2F0"/>
It may, perhaps, be said, <Q>Clerical habits are indifferent and harmless things, except when they are impo∣sed.</Q> But if so, the idea of imposi∣tion being excluded, the canonical dress of a Popish priest, the red hat of a car∣dinal, and the triple crown of a pontiff, may all be justified: for, in themselves, they are equally harmless as the gown, the surplice, or the band. Innocent, however, as all these peculiarities are, detached from the ministerial charac∣ter, and from holy worship; the <HI>reason</HI> or <HI>motive</HI> of wearing them in sacred service, may be carnal, base, and sinful. In some, there is too much ground of suspicion, a desire of being esteemed by the vulgar, either as persons of learning, or as episcopally ordained, when they are not so; and, in others, a lust of increasing their learned and priestly importance, are the latent rea∣sons of wearing those idle badges of clerical distinction. But when illite∣rate men assume the garb of learning, their vanity is contemptible: when they intend, by so doing, to obtain that respect from the ignorant, of which they know themselves unworthy, their practical falsehood is detestable: and when any minister thinks of magnify∣ing
<PB N="83" REF="023213_0082_0FBEDD13AE2DDE70"/>his office, by pomposity in the pul∣pit, he betrays his ignorance relating to the nature of that kingdom in which he professes to be an officer.—Do the laws of this holy empire forbid the subjects to affect shining and costly apparel, as not becoming those who <HI>profess godli∣ness</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii. 9, 10, 1 Pet. iii. 3, 4.</NOTE>; and will not the principle of that prohibition apply with increasing force to the case before us? Is it in∣consistent with that spiritual minded∣ness, of which every avowed disciple of Christ makes an implicit profession, to be fond of a showy dress in the inter∣courses of common life; and can it be suitable to the simplicity of Christian worship, to the character of its Lord, or to the example of his Apostles, for ministers to make a more grand appear∣ance, and take more state upon them, when performing their solemn service, than at any other time? Let these who understand the Christian system, and are heavenly minded, form the determina∣tion.</P>
<P>It must indeed be acknowledged, that the ancient people of God had a splen∣did sanctuary, and a sumptuous temple;
<PB N="84" REF="023213_0083_0FBEDD15B097E160"/>that the Jewish priests, when perform∣ing sacred service, apeared in holy gar∣ments; and that the high priest, on cer∣tain occasions, was richly adorned, in a manner peculiar to his office. But then it is plain, that those things were expressly appointed by Jehovah; that the Dispensation to which they belong∣ed was of a typical nature; that they were suited to the church while in a state of minority; that the whole Jewish nation was then the visible church; that Jehovah was not only the God, but also the King of that nation; that the an∣cient sanctuary was a palace, where po∣litical royalty resided<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. v. 35.</NOTE>, as well as a tem∣ple, where Deity was adored; and that the priests were officers in the state, as well as ministers of religion. To such a politico-ecclesiastical kingdom the splendor of the sanctuary, and the dress of the priests, were manifestly adapted. Hence the tabernacle is cal∣led <HI>a worldly sanctuary,</HI> and the rites performed there <HI>elements of the world</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix 1. Gal. 43, 9. Col. ii. 8, 20.</NOTE> To these, the heavenly sanctuary, into which our Great High priest is entered, and the spiritual worship of the Chris∣tian church, stand opposed.—It should
<PB N="85" REF="023213_0084_0FBEDD1A26BFAD80"/>not be forgotten, that though the Son of God, when displaying his glory as King of the Jewish state, took up his abode in the sanctuary, as in a royal pa∣lace; yet, when <HI>he came into his own country</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh. i. 11. Sec Dr. <HI>Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dridge</HI> in loc.</NOTE>, as King of the Gospel Church, he had not <HI>where to lay his head.</HI></P>
<P>What, then, have the splendor, the laws, or the rites of Judaism, to do in the New Oeconomy; except we mean to convert the Christian church into the Jewish temple? Grandeur and show, whether as pertaining to places of wor∣ship, or to ministers of the word, are abhorrent from the Gospel Dispensati∣on: nor, under the present Oeconomy, have they any other tendency, than to gratify that pride from which they ori∣ginate, and to give the kingdom of Christ a secular appearance.—The New Oeconomy being intended for all nati∣ons and all succeeding ages, is equally fitted for the rich and the poor: nor does it make any distinction, in regard to places, where its worship should be performed. That God be adored <HI>in spirit and in truth,</HI> according to his own rule, is all it requires or one congrega∣tion
<PB N="86" REF="023213_0085_0FBEDD1B98B69D48"/>or of another. It disdains, there∣fore, to borrow any part of its glory, from the grandeur of an edifice, or from the garb of a minister. Though far from supposing rusticity, illiteracy, and meanness, to be characteristics of a Gospel church; yet I may venture to assert, that an assembly of princes in a splendid cathedral, with an archprelate appearing in canonical pomp, may in∣sult the Divine Majesty, and be utterly unworthy the name of a church; while a congregation of day-labourers, with an illiterate minister in the meanest ha∣bit, convened in a barn, may be a spiri∣tual temple, enjoy the Divine Presence, and perform the Christian worship in all its glory.—It has been well obser∣ved, by a certain author, that <Q>the presence of God confers dignity and importance:</Q> but that <Q>he can re∣ceive none from created, much less from artificial pomp and magnifi∣cence.</Q> To which I will add, in the words of Dr. OWEN; <Q>If the whole structure of the temple, and all its beautiful services, were now in be∣ing on the earth, no glory would re∣dound unto God thereby: he would receive none from it. To expect the
<PB N="87" REF="023213_0086_0FBEDD1D0E601590"/>glory of God in them, would be an high dishonor unto him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the Person of Christ, <HI>p. 354, 355.</HI></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>If secular grandeur, however, must needs attend the religion of Him who was born in a stable, and lived in pover∣ty, who received the acclamations of royalty, when riding upon an ass, and quickly after expired on a cross;—if, I say, it <HI>must</HI> appear in the worship of any who pretend to follow the Fisher∣men of Galilee, those prime ministers in the Messiah's kingdom, let it be con∣fined to such as avow themselves mem∣bers of a National establishment. For, with regard to those who maintain that particular churches are Congregation∣al, consisting of such as make a credible profession of repentance and faith; pomp and show in the worship of God are quite unbecoming their principles. Yes, let those monopolize the splendor in question, who consider the church and the state as of equal dimensions; who acknowledge a visible head of po∣litical royalty; and who must search, not the New Testament, but a code of Canons and Constitutions larger than
<PB N="88" REF="023213_0087_0FBEDD229B449358"/>the whole Bible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Refering to <HI>Gibson's Codex.</HI> "When," says Sir <HI>Michael Forster,</HI> <Q>Christianity became the established religion of the empire, and church and state became one body, considered only in different views and under different relations; the ecclesiastical and civil laws of the empire flowed from one and the same source, <HI>imperial rescripts.</HI></Q> <HI>Examinat. of Bp. Gibson's Codex, p.</HI> 122. Edit. 3d.</NOTE>, if they would know on what foundations their ecclesiasti∣cal fabric stands, and by what laws it is governed. The National form of the Jewish church being their model, and a temporal monarch being their head, why should not they have magnificent cathedrals, and consecrate them like Jewish temples? Why should not anci∣ent Judaism be imitated in these parti∣culars, as well as in other things? As the head of the English Church is adorned with royal robes; as the prin∣ciple officers in it are appointed by him, and are Lords in the legislature; and as it is established by laws of the state, who shall forbid the various orders of its ministers being adorned with sound∣ing titles, and with pompous canoni∣cals? There is no reason to wonder that, in such a constitution and such a polity, almost every thing should wear a secular appearance. For, political
<PB N="89" REF="023213_0088_0FBEDD23D58FA740"/>authority pervading the whole ecclesi∣astical frame, it would be inconsistent with itself if its various parts had not an air of external grandeur. As a king∣dom of this world, it is respectable; but it should not pretend to any thing more.</P>
<P>But, however it may be with a Na∣tional establishment, let not Protestant Dissenters be have as if they envied, ei∣ther its magnificence, or its emolu∣ments. No: let not those who consi∣der the Church and the World as oppo∣site ideas; who maintain, that Christ only is the head of Christian communi∣ties; and that the New Testament con∣tains the whole of their ecclesiastical po∣lity, be desirous of external grandeur in any thing pertaining to public wor∣ship: lest they practically deny their own principles, and implicitly reproach primitive Christianity for being too simple and too spiritual. It is fre∣quently much easier for people, and much more desired by them, to assemble in an elegant edifice, and for their mi∣nister to appear in canonical fashion; than to perform a spiritual worship, and to shine in the beauties of holiness. The
<PB N="90" REF="023213_0089_0FBEDD25577A6BF8"/>splendor of a place for assembling, and the pageantry of clerical dress, are pro∣cured by money; but the graces of real sanctity, and internal devotion, are of heavenly origin: nor is the exercise of them to be expected, unless by those who are habitually aiming at it.—I will add, whatever kind of succession to the Apostles may be claimed by diocesan bishops<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Dr. Owen's</HI> Nature of a Gospel Church, and its Government. <HI>p. 33.</HI></NOTE>, yet let not Protestant Dissent∣ing ministers implicitly arrogate an apostolic mission, powers, and authori∣ty, by calling themselves AMBASSADORS <HI>of Christ.</HI> For that character, it is plain, belonged to the first-rate messengers of our divine Sovereign. Or, if any of those who publish the gospel of peace consider a title of that high importance as quite suitable to the dignity of their ecclesiastical station, their credentials must be produced.</P>
<P>By this characteristic of our Lord's kingdom, and by the general nature of it, we are further taught, That <HI>simplicity</HI> and <HI>spirituality</HI> must constitute the chief glory of that worship which he requires —This forms another striking desparity between the Messiah's government and

<P>But though that system was fitted both to the people, and to the times; though it was of great utility, and answered the purpose of Jehovah, under a shadowy dispensation; yet the New Testament informs us, that its numerous rites were the mere <HI>elements</HI> of spiritual know∣ledge, and of holy worship.

To save appearances, however, as many things in the Jewish ritual were pretty well adapted to please the carnally minded, they will be contented with having the Christian worship reformed, in various particulars, according to the ancient model, as completed in the time of David.—Who, that enters a splen∣did edifice, where he beholds a minis∣ter in his canonicals, and meets with such entertaining worship, can forbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r

Heathens having often reproached Christianity, for the poverty and simplicity of its ap∣pearance, the Christians of the fourth century adopted many of the Pagan rites. Ministers of the word, for ex∣ample, when performing their office, appeared in canonical habits, and with priestly pomp. Their newly erected temples were consecrated, by singing of such hymns as were thought suita∣ble to the occasion, by prayers, and by thanksgivings. Then, in the Eastern
<PB N="97" REF="023213_0096_0FBEDD3900CC8F30"/>churches, the responsive singing of David's Psalms was introduced; pre∣centors were appointed, and laws were framed by different Councils to direct the singers in the performance of their service<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Spanhemii Hist.

This was thought expedient, in order to render the religion of Jesus a little more pleas∣ing, respectable, and edifying, than it was in its native state. But well may he demand, with the aspect of incensed majesty, <HI>Who hath required this at your hand?</HI></P>
<P><HI>The kingdom of Christ is not of this world, in respect of its immunities, its riches, and its honors.</HI> Wealth, titles, and au∣thority, are frequently confered by se∣cular princes: but they are all external
<PB N="98" REF="023213_0097_0FBEDD3B1BBD2688"/>things. A patent of peerage, or a lu∣crative office, gives no wisdom to the mind, no peace to the conscience, no holiness to the heart. The possossor, notwithstanding his plentiful income and splendid title, may be a fool, a wretch, and a disgrace to the human spe∣cies.—The highest honors and the great∣est emoluments which the subjects of an earthly kingdom can enjoy, are all of them unsatisfactory: and, therefore, the first favourites of temporal princes are sometimes the most unhappy. Of this we have a remarkable instance in Haman, the prime favourite of Aha∣suerus.—Great privileges a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d exalted honors are enjoyed by comparatively very few subjects of any temporal mo∣narch; the nature of the case forbid∣ding them to become general, among the inhabitants of any country. Duke∣doms, marquisates, and grants from the crown, are but seldom bestowed, how loyal soever the subjects may be. Be∣sides, those distinguished favors are of short duration, and quite uncertain.</P>
<P>Whereas, the immunities, emolu∣ments, and honors of our Lord's king∣dom, are all of them spiritual and in∣ternal. They are suited to the state of
<PB N="99" REF="023213_0098_0FBEDD3C9A18D8E0"/>an enlightened mind, to the feelings of an awakened conscience, and to the de∣sires of a renewed heart. Pardon of all sin, and complete acceptance with God; adoption into the heavenly family, and a title of future glory, are some of the privileges and honors enjoyed by the subjects of this kingdom. Blessings, these, of infinite worth, because of their spiritual nature and immortal duration. Nor are they confined to a few distin∣guished favourites of our celestial So∣vereign; for they are common to all his real subjects. Yes, they are all en∣riched, and all ennobled, with <HI>righte∣ousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P>Now, as the immunities, grants, and honors, bestowed by the King Messiah, are all of a spiritual nature; his faith∣ful subjects have no reason to wonder, or to be discouraged, at any persecuti∣ons, afflictions, or poverty which may befal them. Were his empire <HI>of this world,</HI> then indeed it might be expect∣ed, from the goodness of his heart and the power of his arm, that those who are submissive to his authority, zealous for his honor, and conformed to his image, would commonly find them∣selves easy and prosperous in their tem∣poral

Yes, were his dominion of a secular kind, it might be supposed that an habitually consci∣entious regard to his laws, would se∣cure from the oppression of ungodly men, and from the distresses of temporal want.—Thus it was with Israel under their Theocracy. When the rulers and the people in general were punctu∣al in observing Jehovah's appoint∣ments, the stipulations of the Sinai Co∣venant secured them from being op∣pressed by their enemies, and from any remarkable affliction by the immediate hand of God. Performing the condi∣tions of their National Confederation, they were, as a people, warranted to expect every species of temporal pros∣perity.

In this respect, however, as well as in other things, there is a vast difference between the Jewish, and the Christian Oeconomy. This disparity was plain∣ly intimated, if I mistake not, by the op∣posite modes of divine proceeding, in establishing Jehovah's kingdom among the Jews, and in founding the empire of Jesus Christ. To settle the Israelitish church, to exalt the chosen tribes above surrounding nations, and to render the ancient Theocracy supremely venera∣ble, the divine Sovereign appeared in terrible majesty. Wasting plagues and awful deaths were often inflicted by eternal justice, on those who dared to oppose, or to oppress, the people of God. An angel was commissioned to destroy the Egyptian first-born; Pha∣raoh, with his mighty host, were drowned in the Red sea; and the Ca∣naanitish nations were put to the sword,
<PB N="102" REF="023213_0101_0FBEBD9250BFD780"/>that the subjects of Jehovah might pos∣sess their fertile country. Manifest in∣dications these, in connection with ex∣press promises, that the special Provi∣dence of God would exalt and bless the natural seed of Abraham with temporal felicity; provided they did not violate the Sinai Covenant.</P>
<P>But when the Prince Messiah found∣ed his kingdom, all things were other∣wise. No marks of external grandeur attendeded his personal appearance: and, instead of executing righteous vengeance on those who opposed him, his language was; <HI>The Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do!</HI>—After a life of labour and of beneficence, of poverty and of reproach, he fell a victim to per∣secution, and a martyr to-truth. Such was the plan of divine Providence, respecting Christ our King, and such was the treatment with which he met from the world! Striking intimations, these, that his most faithful subjects would have no ground of discourage∣ment, in any sufferings which might a wait them; and that, considered as his dependants, spiritual blessings were all they should have to expect.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="023213_0102_0FBEDA6B8882D540"/>
It must indeed be acknowledge, that as vicious tempers and immoral prac∣tices have a natural tendency to impair health, distress the mind, and waste the property; so the exercise of holy affecti∣ons, and the practice of true godliness, have the most friendly aspect on a Chris∣tian's own temporal happiness, (ex∣cept so far as persecution intervenes) and on the welfare of society. But then it is evident that this arises from the nature of things, and from the superin∣tendency of common Providence; ra∣ther than from the dominion of Christ, as a spiritual monarch. For, so con∣sidered, spiritual blessings are all that they have to expect from his royal hand.</P>
<P>By the prophetic declarations of our Lord himself, and by the history of this kingdom, it plainly appears, that among all the subjects of his govern∣ment, none have been more exposed to persecution, affliction, and poverty, than those who were most eminent for obedience to his laws, and most useful in his empire. The most uniform sub∣jection to his authority, and the warm∣est zeal for his honor, that ever appear∣ed upon earth; were no security from bitter persecution, from pinching po∣verty,
<PB N="104" REF="023213_0103_0FBEDA6CE200E908"/>or from complicated affliction. Our divine Lord, considered as a spiri∣tual sovereign, is concerned for the spi∣ritual interests of those that are under his government. His personal perfec∣tions and royal prorogatives, his pow∣er and wisdom, his love and care, are therefore to be regarded as engaged, both by office and by promise,—not to make his dependants easy and prosper∣ous in their temporal concerns; but— to strengthen them for their spiritual warfare; to preserve them from final∣ly falling by their invible enemies; to make all afflictions <HI>work together for their good;</HI> to render them, in the final issue, <HI>more than conquerors</HI> over every opposer; and to crown them with everlasting life.</P>
<P>Our Lord has promised, indeed, that their obedience to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s royal pleasure, shall meet with his gracious regards in the present life. Not by indulging them with temporal riches, or by granting them external honor and ease; but by admitting them into more inti∣mate communion with himself, and by rejoicing their hearts with his favor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh. xii. 26. and xiv. 21, 23.</NOTE> Yes, to deliver from spiritual enemies,
<PB N="105" REF="023213_0104_0FBEDA6F8D818118"/>and to provide for spiritual wants; to indulge with spiritual riches, and to ennoble with spiritual honors, are those royal acts which belong to Him, whose <HI>kingdom is not of this world.</HI> In the be∣stowment of these blessings, the glory of his regal character is much concern∣ed. But millions of his devoted sub∣jects may fall by the iron hand of op∣pression, starve in obscurity, or suffer accumulated affliction in other ways; without the least impeachment of his power, his goodness, or his care, as the sovereign of a spiritual kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>The kingdom of Christ is not like the do∣minions of secular princes, with regard to its limits and its duration.</HI> The widely extended monarchies of antiquity were confined to certain parts of the habita∣ble globe, and in the course of a few centuries they came to an end.

The pleasures which they enjoy, considered as the subjects of Jesus Christ, are all of a spiritual nature, and all sa∣vour of the heavenly world.</P>
<P>As Christ is a spiritual monarch, his dominion respects the understandings, the consciences, the hearts of men;
<PB N="108" REF="023213_0107_0FBEDA79F60B20F8"/>and is a preparation for that sublime state, where knowledge and rectitude, where obedience and love, where har∣mony and joy, are all in their full glory. The foundation of this government, as it respects individuals, is laid in re∣generation. There the preparation for heaven begins: and all the genuine fruits of that important change, which is made by divine influence, in the mind, conscience, and heart of a sin∣ner, have a tendency toward heaven; and many of them are anticipations of it. That worship▪ which is performed by the subjects of Christ, is no further spiritual, and agreeable to the New Oeconomy, than it is animated with such affections as abound in heaven. For the time is come, when those that worship the Father, <HI>must worship him in spirit and in truth.</HI> Knowledge and reverence of God, as revealed by the Mediator; confidence in him, and love to him; self-abasement in his presence, and acquiescence in his dominion; are the principle ideas included in spiritual worship, whether as performed by the subjects of Christ here, or by the saints made perfect in glory.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="023213_0108_0FBEDA7C74DC7880"/>
It is manifest from this characteristic of our Lord's kingdom, that a professi∣on of allegiance to him is entirely vain, not attended with <HI>spiritual mindedness:</HI> because it is natural for good subjects to seek the prosperity of that kingdom to which they belong. Now the inter∣ests of Messiah's empire are all of a spiritual nature. In the spread of evan∣gelical truth, and the purity of divine worship; in the exercise of love, and the practice of holiness, the interests and honor of this kingdom chiefly consist. Indifference about these, is an evidence of the heart being disaffected to our di∣vine Sovereign; but allegiance to him, will manifest itself by an habitual re∣gard to them.—In whomsoever this holy Monarch reigns, there is a relish for spiritual riches, honors, pleasures. To enjoy his favor, and bear his image; to perform his will, and be∣hold his glory, are things of the high∣est importance in the esteem of real saints. Nor is it a mere dictate of the understanding and conscience, that it should be so. It is matter of choice: for their hearts are engaged on those objects.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="023213_0109_0FBEDA7DF59FE3D8"/>
It is common for subjects to imitate a sovereign whom they love and re∣vere; especeially, if they have deri∣ved signal benefits from his administra∣tion. Now such is the nature of our Lord's government, that it is impossi∣ble for any one to be under it, without sincerely loving and profoundly rever∣ing him—without seeing an excellence in his example, which commands esteem and excites imitation. But if we be fond of wealth, or emulous of grandeur and show; if we pursue pre∣eminence, and grasp at power; we imitate the children of this world, not Jesus Christ. Those things are eagerly sought, and highly prized, by the sub∣jects of Satan, because they are carnally minded; but he is unworthy to be cal∣led a disciple of Christ, who is not ha∣bitually striving to copy his exam∣ple. Nor can any pretend, that he ever encouraged, by word or deed, the pur∣suit of secular distinctions, the acquisi∣tion of wealth, or the pleasures of sen∣suality, but quite the reverse. Far from seeking <HI>honor which comes from men,</HI> he neither courted the smiles of the rich, nor the patronage of the mighty: for <HI>the friendship of this world, is enmity with God.</HI> So our Lord esteemed it, and so
<PB N="111" REF="023213_0110_0FBEDA7F58C57610"/>must his disciples. To be the subjects of a spiritual kingdom, and to have our hearts on temporal enjoyments, are in∣consistent. <HI>To be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded, is life and peace.</HI></P>
<P>As Christ is a spiritual sovereign, and his church a spiritual kingdom, all the subjects of his government must be con∣sidered, as <HI>in a state of preparation for heaven.</HI> The prevailing dispositions of their hearts are in favor of heavenly things and to promote the exercise of spiritual affections, the New Oeco∣nomy, in all its branches, is much bet∣ter adapted than was the Mosaic system. For as it is the most perfect dispensati∣on of divine grace, that ever was, or ever will be enjoyed on earth; so it makes the nearest approaches to heaven.</P>
<P>It has been justly remarked by a cer∣tain author, <Q>That the Legal Oeco∣nomy introduced that of Grace, by the gospel, and then vanished away, The Dispensation of Grace, in like manner, is now performing its work, fulfilling its day, announcing, un∣folding, introducing the kingdom of glory: and <HI>when that which is per∣fect
<PB N="112" REF="023213_0111_0FBEDA80D7E89EE8"/>is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.</HI></Q>—Yes, the Old Oeconomy, and the Jewish Theocracy, were manifestly introductory to the Christian Dispensation, and the Messi∣ah's kingdom. Those, being typical and shadowy, led to these, and in them received their final completion. But the New Dispensation, and the king∣dom of Christ, have no completion short of heaven. Thither they lead, and there they terminate. No wor∣ship is agreeable to the Messiah's king∣dom, which is not animated by hea∣venly affections. All the external ser∣vices of religion are only so many means of exciting those holy affecti∣ons, of promoting communion with God, and of cultivating a heavenly temper. Consequently, the worship of those who rest in exterior services, is quite superficial, and has nothing spi∣ritual, nothing heavenly in it.</P>

<P><Q>God, says Dr ERSKINE, as husband of the the Gospel church, claims from his people inward affection and love, and accepts them only who
<PB N="114" REF="023213_0113_0FBEDA84D5FD3620"/>worship him in spirit and in truth. In the mosaic covenant it was otherwise. There he appeared chiefly as a tem∣poral prince, and therefore gave laws intended rather to direct the outward conduct, than to regulate the actings of the heart. Hence every thing in that Dispensation was adapted to strike his subjects with awe and re∣verence. The magnificence of his palace, and all its utensils; his nu∣merous train of attendants; the splendid robes of the high-priest, who, though his prime minister, was not allowed to enter the Holy of ho∣lies, save once a year, and, in all his ministrations, was obliged to disco∣ver the most humble veneration for Israel's King; the solemn rites with which the priests were consecrated; the strictness with which all impuni∣ties and indecencies were forbidden, as things which, though tolerable in others, were unbecoming the dig∣nity of the people of God, especially when approaching to him: all these tended to promote and secure the respect due to their glorious Sove∣reign.</Q>— It was, however, foretold, by one of the minor Prophets, <Q>that in Gospel times, men should not call

<P>Yes, under the Mosaic system, the high priest only, and he but once in a year, was admitted to the mercy seat, or throne of Jehovah, in <HI>a worldly sanc∣tuary.</HI> That appearance of the Jewish pontiff before the Lord, though grand and solemn, was a mere emblem of spi∣ritual things, and of that holy inter∣course which all the subjects of this kingdom have with God, in the per∣formance of spiritual worship. For as Jesus entered into the heavenly sanctu∣ary, <HI>with his own blood:</HI> as he is there <HI>a priest upon his throne,</HI> uniting the sa∣cerdotal censer with the regal ceptre; he ever lives, not only to govern his widely extended empire, but likewise to intercede for all his followers, and to be the medium of their access to the di∣vine Father. In virtue of his atone∣ment
<PB N="116" REF="023213_0115_0FBEDA8BC98D0D98"/>made on the cross, and of his ap∣pearance in the heavenly world, the meanest subjects of his dominion, when performing sacred service, <HI>have bold∣ness to enter into the holiest.</HI> Each of them, in the exercise of faith, of hope, and of love, has access to the Divine Majesty on a throne of grace; and each has reason to expect a condescend∣ing audience from the King Eternal.

<PB N="118" REF="023213_0117_0FBEDA8F24971890"/>by New Testament believers; and that, by beholding it, they are gradually <HI>transformed into the glorious image of God.</HI> What an illustrious view does the Apostle here give us of the New Oe∣conomy! He not only represents the state and privileges of the Gospel Church, as greatly superior to those of the Jewish people; but as nearly ap∣proaching to the employments, and the fruitions of the celestial world. For we cannot easily form a more exalted idea of the business and blessedness of heaven, than that of contemplating the glory of God, and of making continual advances in likeness to him.</P>
<P>As, in the person of our Mediator, the nature of God and the nature of man were not united, till just before the commencement of this kingdom; as God was not <HI>manifested in the flesh,</HI> but with an immediate view to this holy and spiritual empire; so there is no rea∣son to wonder that the favored sub∣jects of Messiah's government have a more intimate communion with Jeho∣vah, than was ever enjoyed by the Jew∣ish church. Under the Old Covenant, Israel in general had a kind of local nearness to God, in the performance of
<PB N="119" REF="023213_0118_0FBEDA90A5139F78"/>religious worship; and real saints had spiritual communion with him. But then it was by means of priests, who had infirmities; of sacrifices, that were imperfect; and of services, that were mere shadows of heavenly things: all which were confined to an earthly sanc∣tuary. Whereas the subjects of Jesus Christ have access to the Father of mer∣cies, without regarding any priest, be∣sides their Sovereign; any sacrifice, besides his death; any incense, besides his intercession. All these they regard as appearing, as operating, as efficacious on their behalf, in the heavenly sanctu∣ary. Yes, their High-priest, who is of infinite dignity, their sacrifice, which is of boundless worth; and their incense, which is consummately fra∣grant, are for ever in the immediate presence of God—for ever deserving, and for ever obtaining the divine ap∣probation. On these, therefore, in all their approaches to Eternal Majesty, their dependence fixes Hence their worship is performed, through the aids of grace, with reverence and with confidence, with love and with delight. <HI>We have access with confidence, by the faith of</HI> Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="023213_0119_0FBEDA952C68C258"/>
Now, to worship God with pro∣found reverence, yet without a slavish fear; with steady confidence, connect∣ed with deep humility; with submis∣sion to his will, as the most high Lord; with love to his excellence, as the infi∣nite beauty; and with joy in his all-sufficiency, as the Chief Good; is to perform a spiritual service, and to adore in a heavenly manner. In the perform∣ance of such worship, we have commu∣nion with <HI>the spirits of just men made perfect</HI>—we enter within the veil—we have fellowship with God—we antici∣pate the business of heaven, and taste its refined pleasures. In these holy ex∣ercises of the mind, conscience, and heart, we feel ourselves near to God, as the fountain of all blessedness, and are trained for the heavenly world. Thus we are habituated to a kind of celestial service, by which our likeness to Christ is promoted, and our desires after heaven increased. In these things the very life of spiritual worship and of real religion consists. He therefore is not worthy to be called a subject of our Lord's kingdom, who is not habi∣tually aiming in his devotional services, at his delightful and solemn intercourse with God. Nor is he deserving of that
<PB N="121" REF="023213_0120_0FBEDA9768947550"/>exalted character, whose thoughts and cares, whose hopes and fears, whose joys and sorrows, are not principally concerned about the government and grace of Christ, considered in their con∣nection with the heavenly state.</P>
<P>It must, indeed, be admitted, that this communion with heaven is ex∣tremely imperfect in the present life. Because, though every true subject of the King Messiah be in a state very dif∣ferent from that of a merely nominal Christian, and though he is thankful for that difference; yet he is not, he can∣not be satisfied, either with what he knows, or with what he enjoys; with what he is, or with what he does. Not with what he <HI>knows:</HI> for he knows but <HI>in part,</HI> and he feels the deficiency. His acquaintance with the Greatest and Best of beings—with the character and perfections, with the works and ways of God, is extremely small. His know∣ledge of the adorable Jesus—of his Per∣son and offices, of his grace and work, of his kingdom and glory, is ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> con∣tracted. Nay, the knowledge he has of himself, and of his final destination in the heavenly world, is exceedingly
<PB N="122" REF="023213_0121_0FBEDA990B4A0B90"/>scanty: for <HI>the heart is deceitful above all things;</HI> and <HI>it does not yet appear what we shall be.</HI> He cannot therefore be contented with such a pittance of spiritual knowledge.</P>
<P>Not with what he <HI>enjoys:</HI> for his enjoyment of spiritual pleasure is, at the highest, comparatively low. Be∣sides, it is frequently interrupted by the insurrections of indwelling sin, and by the incursions of outward temptation. Though he sometimes exults in the light of God's countenance, partaking of joy that is <HI>unspeakable and full of glory;</HI> yet he frequently mourns the want of that exalted pleasure, and <HI>groans being burdened.</HI></P>
<P>Not with what he <HI>is:</HI> for he feels much depravity, and laments over it, as affecting his mind with darkness; his conscience with guilt, or with stupidi∣ty; and his passions with carnality. So far from perfectly bearing the image of Christ, that his language frequently is; <HI>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death!</HI></P>
<P>Not with what he <HI>does:</HI> for though he sincerely desires to perform the will of God▪ as revealed in divine precepts,
<PB N="123" REF="023213_0122_0FBEDA9A61664718"/>and illustrated by the example of Christ; yet he perceives that his obe∣dience is very imperfect. Does he, for instance, address himself to God in prayer? in that devout exercise his whole soul should be engaged. Reve∣rence of the divine Majesty, and an abasing sense of his own guilt; saith in the great atonement, and confidence in paternal mercy; the ardour of petition, and the comfort of expectation, should be all united. But frequently, alas! his thoughts wander, and his pious af∣fections are dull, if not dormant. His prayer seems little besides a conflict with his own corruption. He rises from his knees with sorrow and with sighs. Ashamed of the manner in which he has treated the omniscient Object of his worship, he cannot for bear exclaim∣ing; <HI>God be merciful to me a sinner!</HI> and this, perhaps, is the only petition over which he does not mourn, as destitute of holy animation.—Or if he enjoy li∣berty in his converse with the Father of all mercies, how often does he find se∣cret pride, and self-gratulation, arise in his heart? as if the Most Holy would regard his confessions, petitions, and thanksgivings for the sake of their own excellence! Aware of the latent poison,
<PB N="124" REF="023213_0123_0FBEDA9D637FA968"/>he is almost confounded. For well he knows, that Christianity is the religion of sinners—of depraved, of guilty, of unworthy creatures: and that nothing is more inconsistent with evangelical truth, or more detestable in the sight of our Maker, than self-applause respect∣ing acceptance with God. Knowing himself to be a polluted worm that de∣serves to perish, he trembles to think of ever supposing that the majesty of the Most High, and the purity of the Most Holy, will accept his imperfect servi∣ces for their own sake. In the most em∣phatical manner he, therefore, with Job exclaims; <HI>Behold, I am vile!—I abhor myself!</HI> So various and so great are the defects in our devotional ser∣vices, that we might well despair, were it not for a High-priest who bears the iniquity of our <HI>holy things.</HI> For we <HI>find a law, that when we would do good, evil is present with us.</HI></P>
<P>To such imperfections and such com∣plaints, is a real subject of our Lord's dominion liable in the present life. But, looking forward to the separate state, when he shall <HI>be with Christ, which is far better,</HI> and to the resurrection of the righteous; with joy he adopts the
<PB N="125" REF="023213_0124_0FBEDA9E1AAE3B10"/>language of David and says, <HI>I shall be satisfied, when I awake with thy likeness.</HI> Yes, when that ultimate and everlasting Oeconomy commences, his mind be∣ing all irradiated with divine truth, he shall be satisfied with what he <HI>knows:</HI> perfectly possessing the Chief Good, he shall be satisfied with what he <HI>enjoys;</HI> conscious of complete rectitude, he shall be satisfied with what he <HI>is:</HI> and knowing his obedience to be consum∣mate, he shall be satisfied with what he <HI>does.</HI>—Delightful, ravishing thought! To have all our immortal powers ex∣panded and filled, with knowledge of the Supreme truth, and with love to the Supreme Beauty; with reverence of the Supreme Lord, and with delight in the Supreme Good, must constitute com∣plete happiness. Yet such is the grand result of our Lord's dominion in the hearts of men! To this, therefore, we must look, upon this our affections must be placed, if we would behave as the subjects of Jesus Christ, and finish our course with honor. For as this life is the seed-time of an eternal harvest; as no one <HI>gathers grapes of thorns, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> figs of thistles;</HI> and as <HI>whatever a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ows, that shall he also rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> so we have no
<PB N="126" REF="023213_0125_0FBEDAA08FB86618"/>reason to expect heaven as our final re∣sidence, if we be not habitually desirous of communion with God in all our wor∣ship, and of making it our business to perform his will.</P>
<P>It is one of the noblest and most de∣lightful employments of the human mind, to contemplate the gradual reve∣lation of Jehovah's will, and the grow∣ing display of his eternal favor, from the fall of our first parents, to the con∣summation of the divine Oeconomy. It is both pleasing and improving to re∣flect on the Patriarchal Dispensation in∣troducing the Mosaic System; on the Sinai Confederation making way for the New Covenant; on the Jewish Theocracy leading to the Kingdom of Christ; on the government of that kingdom as a preparation for celestial mansions; on the performance of holy worship, by the subjects of Christ here, as the mean of communion with <HI>saints in light;</HI> and on the present state of worship and of blessedness in the hea∣venly sanctuary, as preparing for the ultimate glory.</P>
<P>In reference to the communion of believers with <HI>the spirits of just men made
<PB N="127" REF="023213_0126_0FBEDAA445B038F8"/>perfect,</HI> in the performance of spiritual worship; and respecting the consum∣mation of all things, Dr. OWEN speaks as follows, with whose words I shall conclude. <Q>Were all that die in the Lord immediately received into that state wherein <HI>God shall be all in all,</HI> without any use of the mediation of Christ, or the worship of praise and honor unto God by him, without be∣ing exercised in the ascription of ho∣nor, glory, power and dominion unto [Christ,] on the account of the past and present discharge of his office; there could be no communion be∣tween them and us. But whilst they are in the <HI>sanctuary,</HI> in <HI>the temple of God,</HI> in the holy worship of Christ, and of God in him, and we are not only employed in the same work in sacred ordinances suited unto our state and condition, but in the per∣formance of our duties do by faith <HI>enter in within the veil,</HI> and approach unto the same throne of grace in the most holy place; there is a spiritual communion between them and us. So the Apostle expresseth it, in the twelfth of Hebrews—As we are here, in and by the word and other ordi∣nances, prepared and made meet for
<PB N="128" REF="023213_0127_0FBEDAA82D87A7A8"/>the present state of things in glory; so are they, the spirits of the just made perfect] by the temple wor∣ship of heaven, sitted for that state of things when Christ shall <HI>give up the kingdom unto the Father, that</HI> GOD MAY BE ALL IN ALL<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>On the Person of Christ,</HI> Chap. xx. p. 365, 366.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
