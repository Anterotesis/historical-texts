<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> Of the Rise of Methodism (so called) in Europe and America.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 1. WHAT was the Rise of Methodism, so called, in Europe?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> In 1729, two young Men, reading the Bible, saw they could not be saved without Holi∣ness, followed after it, and incited others so to do. In 1737, they saw likewise, that Men are justified before they are sanctified: but still Holiness was their Object. God then thrust them out, to raise an holy People.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 2. What was the Rise of Methodism, so called, in America?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> During the Space of thirty Years past, certain Persons, Members of the Society, emigrated from England and Ireland, and settled in various Parts of this Country. About twenty Years ago, Philip Embury, a local Preacher from Ireland, began to preach in the City of New-York, and formed a Society of his own Countrymen and the Citizens. About the same Time, Robert Straw∣bridge, a local Preacher from Ireland, settled in

Frederick County, in the State of Maryland, and preaching there formed some Societies. In 1769, Richard Boardman and Joseph Pilmoor, came to New-York; who were the first regular Methodist Preachers on the Continent. In the latter End of the Year 1771, Francis Asbury and Richard Wright, of the same Order, came over.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 3. What may we reasonably believe to be God's Design, in raising up the Preachers called Methodists?</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> On the Nature and Constitution of our Church.</HEAD>
<P>WE are thoroughly convinced, that the Church of England, to which we have been united, is deficient in several of the most im∣portant Parts of Christian Discipline; and that (a few Ministers and Members excepted) it has lost the Life and Power of Religion. We are not
<PB N="6" REF="020522_0005_0FAF3A5E9AFF5C98"/>
ignorant of the Spirit and Designs it has ever disco∣vered in Europe, of rising to Pre-eminence and worldly Dignities by Virtue of a national Establish∣ment, and by the most servile Devotion to the Will of temporal Governors: and we fear, the same Spirit will lead the same Church in these United States (tho' altered in its Name) to similar Designs and Attempts, if the Number and Strength of its Members will ever afford a Probability of Success; and particularly, to obtain a national Establishment which we cordially abhor as the great Bane of Truth and Holiness, the greatest Impediment in the World to the Progress of vital Christianity.</P>
<P>For these Reasons, we have thought it our Duty to form ourselves into an Independent Church. And as the most excellent Mode of Church Govern∣ment according to our maturest Judgment, is that of <HI>a moderate Episcopacy;</HI> and as we are persuaded, <HI>that the uninterrupted Succession of Bishops from the Apostles,</HI> can be proved neither from Scripture nor Antiquity; we therefore have constituted ourselves into an <HI>Episcopal Church,</HI> under the Direction of <HI>Bishops, Elders, Deacons,</HI> and <HI>Preachers,</HI> according to the Forms of Ordination annexed to our Prayer Book, and the Regulations laid down in this Form of Discipline.</P>

<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 3. To whom is the Bishop amenable for his Conduct?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> To the Conference: who have Power to expel him for improper Conduct, if they see it necessary.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION VII.</HI> On the Method of receiving Preachers, and their Duty.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 1. HOW is a Preacher to be received?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. By the Conference.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the Interval of the Conference, by the Elder.</P>
<P N="3">3. When his Name is not printed in the Minutes, he must receive a written Licence from his Elder.</P>

<ITEM>4. To meet the Leaders.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. To preach in the Morning, where he can get Hearers.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> We are fully determined never to drop Morning-Preaching; and to preach at five o'Clock in the Summer, and at six in the Winter, where∣ever it is practicable.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="12" REF="020522_0011_0FAF3A6392CDF318"/><HI>Quest.</HI> 3. Are the Preachers to read our Liturgy?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> All that have received a written Direction for that Purpose, under the Hand of a Bishop or Elder, may read the Liturgy, as often as they think it expedient.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 4. What are the Directions given to a Preacher?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. Be diligent. Never be unemployed. Never be triflingly employed. Never trifle away Time; neither spend any more Time at any Place than is strictly necessary.</P>
<P N="2">2. Be serious. Let your Motto be, <HI>Holiness to the Lord.</HI> Avoid all Lightness, jesting and foolish Talking.</P>
<P N="3">3. Converse sparingly and cautiously with Wo∣men.</P>
<P N="4">4. Take no Step towards Marriage without first consulting with your Brethren.</P>
<P N="5">5. Believe Evil of no one: Unless you see it done, take Heed how you credit it. Put the best Construction on every Thing. You know the Judge is always supposed to be on the Prisoner's Side.</P>
<P N="6">6. Speak Evil of no one: Else your Word espe∣cially would eat as doth a Canker. Keep your Thoughts within your own Breast, till you come to the Person concerned.</P>
<P N="7">7. Tell every one under your Care, what you think wrong in his Conduct and Tempers, and that plainly as soon as may be: Else it will fester in your Heart. Make all Haste to cast the Fire out of your Bosom.</P>
<P N="8">8. Do not affect the Gentleman. You have no more to do with this Character than with that of a Dancing-Master. A Preacher of the Gospel is the Servant of all.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="13" REF="020522_0012_0FAF3A640CCA1BE0" MS="y"/>9. Be ashamed of nothing but Sin.</P>
<P N="10">10. Be punctual. Do every Thing exactly at the Time. And do not mend our Rules, but keep them; not for Wrath but Conscience sake.</P>
<P N="11">11. You have nothing to do but to save Souls. Therefore spend and be spent in this Work. And go always not only to those that want, but to those that want you most.</P>
<P>Observe. It is not your Business to preach so many Times, and to take Care of this or that Society: But to save as many Souls as you can; to bring as many Sinners as you possibly can to Re∣pentance, and with all your Power to build them up in that Holiness, without which they cannot see the Lord. And remember! A Methodist Preacher is to mind every Point, great and small, in the Methodist Discipline! Therefore you will need to exercise all the Sense you have.</P>
<P N="12">12. Act in all Things, not according to your own Will, but as a Son in the Gospel. As such it is your Part to employ your Time in the Manner which we direct: Partly in preaching and visiting from House to House: Partly in reading, Medita∣tion and Prayer. Above all, if you labour with us in our Lord's Vineyard, it is needful you should do that Part of the Work which we advise, at those Times and Places which we judge most for His Glory.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 5. What Method do we use in receiving a Preacher at the Conference?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> After solemn Fasting and Prayer, every Person proposed shall then be asked, before the Con∣ference, the following Questions (with any others which may be thought necessary) viz. Have you Faith in Christ? Are you going on to Perfection? Do you expect to be made perfect in Love in this
<PB N="14" REF="020522_0013_0FAF3A649DD0B4A8"/>
Life? Are you groaning after it? Are you resolved to devote yourself wholly to God and his Work? Do you know the Rules of the Society? Of the Bands? Do you keep them? Do you constantly attend the Sacrament? Have you read the Form of Discipline? Are you willing to conform to it? Have you considered the Rules of a Preacher; espe∣cially the first, tenth and twelfth? Will you keep them for Conscience Sake? Are you determined to employ all your Time in the Work of God? Will you endeavour not to speak too long or too loud? Will you diligently instruct the Children in every Place? Will you visit from House to House? Will you recommend Fasting or Abstinence, both by Precept and Example? Are you in Debt?</P>
<P>We may then, if he gives Satisfaction, receive him as a Probationer, by giving him the Form of Discipline, inscribed thus: To A. B. <HI>"You think it your Duty to call Sinners to Repentance. Make full Proof hereof, and we shall rejoice to receive you as a Fellow-Labourer."</HI> Let him then carefully read and weigh what is contained therein; that if he has any Doubt, it may be removed. Observe! Taking on Trial is entirely different from admitting a Preacher. One on Trial, may be either admitted or rejected, without doing him any Wrong; other∣wise it would be no Trial at all. Let every Dea∣con explain this to them that are on Trial.</P>
<P>After two Years Probation, being recommended by the Elder or Deacon, and examined by the Bishop, he may be received into full Connection, by giving him the Form of Discipline, inscribed thus: <HI>As long as you freely consent to, and earnestly endeavour to walk by these Rules, we shall rejoice to acknowledge you as a Fellow-Labourer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Let none who are <HI>local,</HI> preach or exhort

in any of our Societies without a Note of Permission from the Deacon: Let every local Preacher or Ex∣horter take Care to have this renewed yearly: And let every Elder insist upon it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION VIII.</HI> Of the Collections that are made, and how the Money is to be expended.</HEAD>

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. A Quarterly Collection from the Members of the Society, to supply the Preachers; and when that is deficient, a Public Quarterly Col∣lection: If there be any Overplus, let one third be reserved for future Deficiencies; one third be given to the Poor in general; and one third applied to the building or improving of our Churches.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION IX.</HI> On Class-Meeting.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 1. HOW may the Leaders of Classes be rendered more useful?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. Let each of them be diligently exa∣mined concerning his Method of meeting a Class. Let this be done with all possible Exactness, at least once a Quarter. In Order to this, take sufficient Time.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let each Leader carefully inquire how every Soul in his Class prospers: Not only how each Per∣son observes the outward Rules, but how he grows in the Knowledge and Love of God.</P>

<P N="2">2. If they do not amend, let the Deacon exclude them in the Society; shewing that they are laid aside for a Breach of our Rules of Discipline, and not for immoral Conduct.</P>

<P N="5">5. Christian Conference: Are you convinced how important and how difficult it is to order your Con∣versation aright? Is it always in Grace? Seasoned with salt? Meet to minister Grace to the Hearers? Do you not converse too long at a Time? Is not an Hour commonly enough? Would it not be well always to have a determinate End in View? And to pray before and after it?</P>
<P N="2">II. Prudential Means we may use, either as Christians, as Methodists, as Preachers, or as Mi∣nisters.</P>
<P N="1">1. As Christians: What particular Rules have you in order to grow in Grace? What Arts of Holy Living?</P>
<P N="2">2. As Methodists: Do you never miss your Class or Band?</P>
<P N="3">3. As Preachers: Do you meet every Society? Also, the Leaders and Bands?</P>
<P N="4">4. As Ministers: Have you thoroughly consi∣dered your Duty? And do you make a Conscience of executing every Part of it?</P>
<P>These Means may be used without Fruit. But there are some Means which cannot; namely, Watching, Denying ourselves, taking up our Cross, Exercise of the Presence of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. Do you steadily watch against the World? Yourself? Your besetting Sin?</P>
<P N="2">2. Do you deny yourself every useless Pleasure of Sense? Imagination? Honour? Are you temperate in all Things? Instance in Food. (1) Do you use only that Kind, and that Degree, which is best both for your Body and Soul? Do you see the Ne∣cessity of this? (2) Do you eat no Flesh Suppers?
<PB N="20" REF="020522_0019_0FAF3A691DFF3300" MS="y"/>
(3) Do you eat no more at each Meal than is neces∣sary? Are you not heavy or drowsy after Dinner? (4) Do you use only that Kind and that Degree of Drink which is best both for your Body and Soul? (5) Do you chuse and use Water for your common Drink? And only take Wine and other Liquors medicinally?</P>
<P N="3">3. Wherein do you take up your Cross daily? Do you chearfully bear your Cross (whatever is grievous to Nature) as a Gift of God, and labour to profit thereby?</P>
<P N="4">4. Do you endeavour to set God always before you? To see His Eye continually fixed upon you? Never can you use these Means, but a Blessing will ensue. And the more you use them, the more will you grow in Grace.</P>

<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 1. WHAT is the best general Method of Preaching?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. To invite: 2. To convince. 3. To offer Christ. 4. To build up: And to do this in some Measure in every Sermon.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 2. Are there any smaller Advices relative to Preaching, which might be of Use to us?</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="020522_0023_0FAF3A6C1ED10DA8" MS="y"/><HI>Answ.</HI> Perhaps these: 1. Be sure never to dis∣appoint a Congregation. 2. Begin precisely at the Time appointed. 3. Let your whole Deportment before the Congregation be serious, weighty and solemn. 4. Always suit your Subject to your Audi∣ence. 5. Chuse the plainest Texts you can. 6. Take Care not to ramble, but keep to your Text, and make out what you take in Hand. 7. Take Care of any Thing aukward or affected, either in your Gesture, Phrase or Pronunciation. 8. Print nothing without the Approbation of the Conference, and one of the Bishops. 9. Do not usually pray <HI>ex tempore</HI> above eight or ten Minutes (at most) without Intermission. 10. Frequently read and en∣large upon a Portion of the Notes: And let young Preachers often exhort without taking a Text. 11. Always avail yourself of the great Festivals by preaching on the Occasion. 12. Be courteous to all.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 3. Have not some of us been led off from practical Preaching by (what is called) preaching Christ?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Indeed we have. The most effectual Way of Preaching Christ, is to preach him in all his Offices; and to declare his Law, as well as his Gospel, both to Believers and Unbelievers. Let us strongly and closely insist upon inward and outward Holiness in all its Branches.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XVI.</HI> Against Antinomianism.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 1. WHAT can be done to guard against Antinomianism?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. Let all the Preachers carefully read over Mr. Wesley's and Mr. Fletcher's Tracts. 2. Let
<PB N="25" REF="020522_0024_0FAF3A6CDCCD7578" MS="y"/>
them frequently and explicitly preach the Truth, but not in a controversial Way. And let them take Care to do it in Love and Gentleness: Not in Bit∣terness, returning Railing for Railing. 3. Answer all the Objections of our People as Occasion offers. But take Care to do this with all possible Sweetness both of Look and Accent.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 2. Wherein lies our Danger of it?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. With Regard to Man's Faithfulness, Our Lord himself taught us to use the Expression. Therefore we ought never to be ashamed of it. We ought steadily to assert upon his Authority, that if a Man is not faithful in the unrighteouss Mammon, God will not give him the true Riches.</P>
<P N="2">2. With regard to working for Life, which our Lord expressly commands us to do. Labour <HI>(erga∣zesthe)</HI> literally <HI>work for the Meat that endureth to everlasting Life.</HI> And in Fact every Believer till he comes to Glory, works for, as well as from Life.</P>
<P N="3">3. We have received it as a Maxim, that "A Man is to do nothing in order to Justification:" Nothing can be more false. Whoever desires to find Favour with God, should cease from Evil, and learn to do well. So God Himself teaches by the Prophet Isaiah. Whoever repents, should do Works meet for Repentance: And if this is not in order to find Favour, what does he do for them?</P>
<P>Once more review the whole Affair.</P>
<P N="1">1. Who of us is now accepted of God?</P>
<P>He that now believes in Christ with a loving, obedient Heart.</P>
<P N="2">2. But who among those that never heard of Christ?</P>
<P>He that according to the Light he has, scareth God, and worketh Righteousness.</P>
<P N="3">3. Is this the same with, He that is sincere?</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="020522_0025_0FAF3A6E1C27B3E0"/>Nearly, if not quite.</P>
<P N="4">4. Is not this Salvation by Works?</P>
<P>Not by the Merit of Works, but by Works as a Condition.</P>
<P N="5">5. The grand Objection to one of the preceed∣ing Propositions, is drawn from Matter of Fact. God does in Fact justify those who by their own Confession neither feared God, nor wrought Righte∣ousness. Is this an Exception to the general Rule?</P>
<P>It is a Doubt whether God makes any Exception at all. But how are we sure that the Person in question never did fear God, and work Righteous∣ness?</P>
<P>His own thinking so, is no Proof. For we know how all that are convinced of sin, undervalue them∣selves in every Respect.</P>
<P N="6">6. Does not talking without proper Caution of a justified or sanctified State, tend to mislead Men? Almost naturally leading them to trust in what was done in one Moment? Whereas we are every Mo∣ment pleasing or displeasing God, according to our Works; according to the whole of our present in∣ward Tempers, and outward Behaviour.</P>

<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 3. But why are we not more knowing?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Because we are idle. We forget our first Rule, "Be diligent. Never be unemployed. Never be triflingly employed; neither spend any more Time at any Place than is strictly necessary." I fear there is altogether a Fault in this Matter, and that few of us are clear. Which of you spends as many Hours a Day in God's Work, as you did formerly in Man's Work? We talk, talk—or read History, or what comes next to Hand. We must, abso∣lutely must, cure this Evil, or betray the Cause of God. But how? 1. Read the most useful Books, and that regularly and constantly. Steadily spend all the Morning in this Employment, or at least five Hours in four and twenty. "But I have no Taste for reading." Contract a Taste for it by Use, or return to your former Employment. "But I have no Books." Be diligent to spread the Books, and you will have the Use of them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XXII.</HI> On Perfection.</HEAD>
<P>LET us strongly and explicitly exhort all Be∣lievers to go on to Perfection. That we may all speak the same Thing, we ask once for all, Shall we defend this Perfection, or give it up? We all agree to defend it, meaning thereby (as we did from the Beginning) Salvation from all Sin, by the Love of God and Man filling our Heart. The Papists say, "This cannot be attained till we have been refined by the Fire of Purgatory." Some Professors say, "Nay, it will be attained as soon as the Soul and Body part." Others say, "It may be attained before we die: A Moment after is too late." Is it so, or not? We are all agreed, we may be saved from all Sin before Death. The Substance then is settled. But as to the Circumstances, is the Change gradual or instantaneous! It is both the one and the other. "But should we in Preaching insist both on one and the other?" Certainly we should insist on the gradual Change; and that ear∣nestly and continually. And are there not Reasons why we should insist on the instantaneous also? If there be such a blessed Change before Death, should
<PB N="31" REF="020522_0030_0FAF3A71D859AC50" MS="y"/>
we not encourage all Believers to expect it? And the rather, because constant Experience shews, the more earnestly they expect this, the more swiftly and steadily does the gradual Work of God go on in their Souls; the more careful are they to grow in Grace; the more zealous of good Works, and the more punctual in their Attendance on all the Ordinances of God; (whereas just the contrary Effects are observed, whenever this Expectation ceases.) They are saved by Hope, by this Hope of a total Change, with a gradually increasing Sal∣vation. Destroy this Hope, and that Salvation stands still, or rather decreases daily. Therefore whoever would advance the gradual Change in Be∣lievers, should strongly insist on the instantaneous.</P>

<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 1. HOW can we further assist those under our Care?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. By instructing them at their own Houses. What unspeakable Need is there of this? The World says, "The Methodists are no better than other People." This is not true. But it is nearer the Truth than we are willing to believe. For 1. Personal Religion either toward God, or Man, is
<PB N="33" REF="020522_0032_0FAF3A72DB526A50" MS="y"/>
very superficial among us. We can but just touch on a few Generals. How little Faith is there among us? How little Communion with God? How little living in Heaven, walking in Eternity, Deadness to every Creature? How much Love of the World? Desire of Pleasure, of Ease, of getting Money? How little brotherly Love? What continual Judg∣ing one another? What Gossipping, Evil-speaking. Tale-bearing? What Want of moral Honesty? To instance only one Particular; Who does as he would be done by, in buying and selling?</P>
<P N="2">2. Family-Religion is wanting in many Branches. And what avails Public Preaching alone, though we could preach like Angels? We must, yea, every Travelling-Preacher must instruct them from House to House. Till this is done, and that in good Ear∣nest, the Methodists will be little better than other People.</P>
<P>Our Religion is not deep, universal, uniform; but superficial, partial, uneven. It will be so, till we spend half as much Time in this Visiting, as we now do in talking uselessly. Can we find a better Method of doing this than Mr. Baxter's? If not, let us adopt it without Delay. His whole Tract, intitled, <HI>Gildas Salvianus,</HI> is well worth a careful Perusal. Speaking of this visiting from House to House, he says, (p. 351.)</P>
<P>"We shall find many Hindrances, both in our∣selves and the People.</P>
<P N="1">1. In ourselves, there is much Dulness and Lazi∣ness, so that there will be much ado to get us to be faithful in the Work.</P>
<P N="2">2. We have a base, man-pleasing Temper, so that we let Men perish, rather than lose their Love; we let them go quietly to Hell, lest we should offend them.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="020522_0033_0FAF3A739B336CB8"/>Some of us have also a foolish Bashfulness. We know not how to begin, and blush to contradict the Devil.</P>
<P N="4">4. But the greatest Hindrance is Weakness of Faith. Our whole Motion is weak, because the Spring of it is weak.</P>
<P N="5">5. Lastly, we are unskilful in the Work. How few know how to deal with Men, so as to get within them, and suit all our Discourse to their se∣veral Conditions and Tempers: To chuse the fittest Subjects, and follow them with a holy Mixture of Seriousness and Terror, and Love, and Meekness?</P>
<P>But undoubtedly this private Application is im∣plied in those solemn Words of the Apostle, <HI>I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the Quick and Dead at his appearing, preach the Word, be instant in Season, out of Season: Re∣prove, rebuke, exhort, with all Long-suffering.</HI></P>
<P>O Brethren, if we could but set this Work on foot in all our Societies, and prosecute it zealously, what Glory would redound to God. If the common Lukewarmness were banished, and every Shop, and every House busied in speaking of the Words and Works of God; surely God would dwell in our Habitations, and make us His Delight.</P>
<P>And this is absolutely necessary to the Welfare of our People, some of whom neither believe nor re∣pent to this Day. Look round and see how many of them are still in apparent Danger of Damnation. And how can you walk, and talk, and be merry with such People, when you know their Case? Methinks when you look them in the Face, you should break forth into Tears, as the Prophet did when he looked upon Hazael, and then set on them with the most vehement Exhortations. O, for God's Sake, and the Sake of poor Souls, bestir
<PB N="35" REF="020522_0034_0FAF3A745AF35290" MS="y"/>
yourselves, and spare no Pains that may conduce to their Salvation!</P>
<P>What Cause have we to bleed before the Lord this Day, that we have so long neglected this good Work! If we had but engaged in it sooner, how many more might have been brought to Christ? And how much holier and happier might we have made our Societies before now? And why might we not have done it sooner? There are many Hin∣drances: And so there always will be. But the greatest Hindrance was in ourselves, in our Little∣ness of Faith and Love.</P>
<P>But it is objected, 1. This will take up so much Time, we shall not have Leisure to follow our Studies.</P>
<P>We answer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>taining Knowledge is a good Thing, but saving Souls is a better. 2. By this very Thing you will gain the most excellent Know∣ledge, that of God and Eternity. 3. You will have Time for gaining other Knowledge too. Only sleep not more than you need; and never be idle or triflingly employed. But, 4. If you can do but one, let your Studies alone. I would throw by all the Libraries in the World rather than be guilty of the Loss of one Soul.</P>

His Patience, <HI>Neither count I my Life dear unto myself.</HI> And among all other Mo∣tives, let these be ever before our Eyes: 1. <HI>The Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own Blood.</HI> 2. <HI>Grievous Wolves shall enter in; yea, of yourselves shall Men arise, speaking perverse Things.</HI></P>
<P>Write this upon your Hearts, and it will do you more good than twenty Year's Study. Then you will have no Time to spare: You will have Work enough. Then likewise no Preacher will stay with us who is as Salt that has lost its Savour. For to such this Employment would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Drudgery. And in order to it, you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> need of all the Knowledge you can procure.</P>
<P>The Sum is, Go into every House in course, and teach every one therein, young and old, if they belong to us, to be Christians inwardly and out∣wardly Make every Particular plain to their Un∣derstandings; fix it in their Minds; write it on their Hearts. In order to this, there must be Line upon Line, Precept upon Precept. What Patience, what Love, what Knowledge is requisite for this? We must needs do this, were it only to avoid Idle∣ness. Do we not loiter away many Hours in every Week? Each try himself: No Idleness is consistent with Growth in Grace. Nay, without Exactness in redeeming Time, you cannot retain the Grace you received in Justification.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 2. Why are we not more holy, why do not we live in Eternity? Walk with God all the Day long? Why are we not all devoted to God? Breathing the whole Spirit of Missionaries?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Chiefly because we are Enthusiaists; look∣ing for the End without using the Means. To

touch only upon two or three Instances: Who of you rises at four? Or even at five, when he does not preach? Do you know the Obligation and Be∣nefit of Fasting or Abstinence? How often do you practise it? The Neglect of this alone is sufficient to account for our Feebleness and Faintness of Spi∣rit. We are continually grieving the Holy Spirit of God by the habitual Neglect of a plain Duty. Let us amend from this Hour.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 3. How shall we guard against Sabath-breaking, Evil-speaking, unprofitable Conversation, Lightness, Expensiveness or Gaiety of Apparel, and contracting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> without due Care to discharge them?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> preach expressly on each of these Heads. 2. Read in every Society the Sermon on Evil-speaking. 3. Let the Leaders closely exa∣mine and exhort every Person to put away the accursed Thing. 4. Let the Preacher warn every Society, that none who is guilty herein, can remain with us. 5. Extirpate Smugling, buying or selling uncustomed Goods, out of every Society. Let none remain with us who will not totally abstain from eve∣ry Kind and Degree of it. 6. Extirpate Bribery, re∣ceiving any Thing, directly or indirectly, for voting at any Election. Shew no Respect of Persons here∣in, but expel all that touch the accursed Thing.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 4. What shall we do to prevent Scandal, when any of our Members fail in Business, or con∣tract Debts which they are not able to pay?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Let the Elder or Deacon desire two or three judicious Members of the Society to inspect the Accounts of the supposed Delinquents; and if they have behaved Dishonestly, or borrowed Money without a Probability of paying, let them be sus∣pended till their Credit is restored.</P>

<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 1. IS any Thing advisable in regard to Building?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Let all our Churches be built plain and decent; but not more expensively than is absolutely unavoidable: Otherwise the Necessity of raising Money will make Rich Men necessary to us. But if so, we must be dependent on them, yea, and governed by them. And then farewel to the Me∣thodist-Discipline, if not Doctrine too.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> 1. That no Person shall be eligible as a Trustee to any of our Churches or Colleges, that is not in constant Church-Communion, and a regular Leader or Member of a Class. 2. That no Person that is a Trusttee, shall be ejected while he is in joint Security for Money, unless such Relief be given him that is demanded; or that the Person who makes the Loan will accept.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 2. Is there any Exception to the Rule, "Let the Men and Women sit apart?"</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> There is no Exception. Let them sit apart in all our Churches.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 3. But is there not a worse Indecency than this, Talking in the Congregation, before and after Service? How shall this be cured?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Let all the Ministers and Preachers join as one Man, and enlarge on the Impropriety of Talking before or after Service; and strongly ex∣hort those that are concerned to do it no more. In

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XXVIII.</HI> On raising a general Fund for the Pro∣pagation of the Gospel.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> HOW may we raise a general Fund for carrying on the whole Work of God?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> By a yearly Collection, and, if need be, a quarterly one, to be raised by every Assistant in every principal Congregation in his Circuit. To this End, he may then read and enlarge upon the following Hints in every such Congregation.</P>
<P>"How shall we send Labourers into those Parts where they are most of all wanted? Many are wil∣ling to hear, but not to bear the Expence. Nor can it as yet be expected of them: Stay till the Word of God has touched their Hearts, and then they will gladly provide for them that preach it. Does it not lie upon us in the mean Time to supply their Lack of Service? To raise a general Fund, out of which from Time to Time that Expence may be defrayed? By this Means those who willingly offer themselves, may travel through every Part, whether there are Societies or not, and stay wherever there is a Call, without being burdensome to any. Thus may the

Gospel, in the Life and Power thereof, be spread from Sea to Sea. Which of you will not rejoice to throw in your Mite to promote this glorious Work?</P>
<P>"Besides this, in carrying on so large a Work through the Continent, there are Calls for Money in various Ways, and we must frequently be at consider∣able Expence, or the Work must be at a full Stop. Many too are the occasional Distresses of our Preach∣ers, or their Families, which require an immediate Supply. Otherwise their Hands would hang down, if they were not constrained to depart from the Work.</P>
<P>"The Money contributed will be brought to the ensuing Conference.</P>
<P>"Men and Brethren, help! Was there ever a Call like this since you first heard the Gospel-Sound? Help to relieve your Companions in the Kingdom of Jesus, who are prest above Measure. Bear ye one another's Burdens, and so fulfil the Law of Christ. Help to send forth able, willing Labourers into your Lord's Harvest: So shall ye be assistant in saving Souls from Death, and hiding a Multitude of Sins. Help to propagate the Gospel of your Salvation to the remotest Corners of the Earth, till the Knowledge of our Lord shall cover the Land as the Waters cover the Sea. So shall it appear to ourselves and all Men, that we are indeed one Body united by one Spirit; so shall the baptized Heathens be yet again constrained to say, "See how these Christians love one another."</P>
