And truly, many of us have cause to say with that emi∣nent Servant of the LORD: <HI>Every day they wrest our words; all their thoughts are against Us for evil,</HI> Psalms 56: 5:</Q></P>
<Q><P><HI>It was by the same method that the ancient enemies of</HI> Christianity <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sed to pervert the right way of the</HI> LORD, <HI>as</HI> Celsus, Porphyry, Juli∣an &amp;c. <HI>And the same means were employed by the Opposers of the</HI> Re∣formation <HI>to defame it, and the</HI> Instruments <HI>thereof</HI></P>
<P>Let the <HI>Writings</HI> of any of the <HI>Members</HI> of any <HI>of the Churches</HI> of <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> GERMANY &amp; FRANCE, at the time of the <HI>Reformati∣on</HI> be consulted, and it will appear that they made the same complaint, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do, of the <HI>injustice,</HI> partiality and abuse of their <HI>adversaries</HI> in refe∣rence to the misgiving of their <HI>Principles,</HI> abusing of their <HI>Writings,</HI> &amp; rendering them not only <HI>erroneous,</HI> but <HI>inconsistent</HI> with <HI>Government;</HI> so that they might <HI>Fire</HI> the <HI>Civil Magistrates</HI> upon them as the <HI>Jews</HI> would have done the <HI>Romans</HI> upon the <HI>Primitive Christians,</HI> as enemies to <HI>Cesar</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Now observe here; the above hath been and is the exact method of our</HI> Adversaries, <HI>as was the method of the</HI> Adversaries <HI>of the</HI> ancient Christians <HI>and first</HI> Reformers.</P></Q>
<P><HI>The Next is the</HI> Author himself <HI>in the</HI> Introduction <HI>to the said</HI> Book, <HI>who there tells us how</HI> Origen <HI>an</HI> Ancient Defender <HI>of the</HI> Christian Re∣ligion <HI>complain'd in his day against the</HI> Christians <HI>then Adversaries,</HI> particularly <HI>against one</HI> Celsus <HI>for abusing the</HI> Scriptures, <HI>taking them by piece meal, as our</HI> Adversaries <HI>now do our Friends</HI> Writing: Origens <HI>words being thus,</HI> viz: <Q><HI>Celsus</HI> his hatred of us, more than love to <HI>Truth</HI> hath induced him to collect some instances which may be <HI>Inter∣preted</HI> to Our prejudice, passing by all those that would have turn∣ed to our advantage.</Q></P>

Intituled An Apostate Conscience exposed &amp;c. Said of him, Therefore be pleas'd First to take notice of some hints that the hath writ of him; and see what she writes out of his book called, the Quakers detected writ two Years after he turn'd to the <HI>Church of Eng∣land,</HI> He there giving a relation how he came to be a Quaker, in which relation having spoken of their Doctrine of the Light, their practices. Conversation and deportment, and what simplicity attended their Ministry in the beginning. He then adds and says <HI>page</HI> 14. <Q>I was still more and more Confi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d that it was a dispensation of the Love of God sent as a visitation to Mankind; being thus perswaded I resol∣ved to bear the Cross and did utterly despise the shame that attended them and their message and was not behind any of my Equals both in doing and suffering for the testimony thereof, as some among them can still bear me witness and in this manner we went on for many Years and loved one another with love unfeigned, and doubtless God blessed our Meetings with the Comfortable Enjoyment of his pre∣sence &amp;c.</Q> Note here we may see how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly he was made to Confess on the Quakers behalf &amp; tho' this was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a Church-man, yet doubtless he had not then wholly <HI>Forgotten the Days of his Espousals,</HI> which since he seems quite to gave done▪ And let us now examine whether it was not to than the Cross, which at first he says he was content to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecome so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ To resolve that, the Author tells that she having heard he had conformed to the Church of England, asked him the cause, and that his Answer was, <HI>what</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="001230_0009_0FB17D4A53B31B28"/><HI>would you have me to do? The Statute of Twenty pound per month will be put in Execution against me and I have suffered enough already.</HI> Well, by this we may a little guess at his honesty towards God. Let us next see how he hath been (as by the said Authors relation, page 57) towards men. She saith, upon the <HI>Bishop of Norwich</HI> his not only reo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmending him as an object of Charity deserving the bounty of well disposed persons, but also Certifying that he ap∣peared to him a sober, honest and industrious man. This last the said Ann Dockwray saith, will <HI>be matter of Admiration to all inqui∣sitive people</HI> when the real truth of this concern is known; for be∣sides the many lies told of particular friends, and for which she hath there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>cted him she having as above been acquainted with him <HI>many years</HI> she tells us <Q>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to his honesty and industry if he had been an honest and industrious man as the Bishop saith, he would not have lost his time and neglected his trade for near twenty years as (said she) I can make appear out of his own books and spent a good Estate in scribbling against the Quakers to no purpose, as will further appear and run many hundred pounds in debt more than he was able to pay and his Creditors most have lost much money by him if this project with the Bishop &amp; some of the Clergy did not take which was a thing doubtful by his own confession in his 20: Book page 147.</Q></P>
<P>There may (saith she) be much more said upon this accoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I will instance but few of them <Q>In or about the year 1697; He married his Daughter, made great Feasting and Entertainments that was said to be very chargeable; and promised three hundred pounds portion with her upon the marriage and at the same time he was indebted many hundred pounds more than he was worth. He al∣so gave Bond to make his wife a Joynture of some part of his, Estate which he hath since sold to his Son.</Q> Those things (saith she) he hath confessed to me and others &amp;c. page 53. And as to his writing lies against us, she saith, that when he was told of it by
<PB N="11" REF="001230_0010_0FB17D4BC6791EA8"/>some friends. His answer was <HI>His pen would run too quick sometimes.</HI> These things considered, we hope, we may be very well ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed for saying what we did in answer to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s giving the said Bugg the Epithet of HONEST FRANCIS.</P>
<P>And now, whereas of late years you have been so busy to call up∣on us to deny our ancient Friends writings from your very <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>i∣ting perverting and false quoting them,</HI> or from your taking advan∣tage of a word or a few words (tho' well meant, yet) not so well guarded as we could have wished they had been, or of here and there a word or two which possibly might be either misprision of Transcriber, Printer or Corrector in either Book or Errata; tho' the sense you put upon them as also the passages themselves, if unfound, have been denied <HI>to be according to our Principles;</HI> yet you very unfairly continue to cite them against us. As in the case of Solomon Eccles his un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound expression<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> saying. The blood of Christ was no more than the blood of another Saint. And that of Christopher Atkins saying. Your imagined God above the stars; and your carnal Christ &amp;c: is disowned by us. As to the first G:W: saith, he hath disowned that comparison about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and saith, <HI>Solomon Eccles</HI> was not in the <HI>Counsel or Wisdom of God therein.</HI> And for the last, both the Passage &amp; Author have been also disowned by us, see Antidote page 224 225. Truth &amp; in∣nocency &amp;c: page 52. Yet your inveterate haired of us, and your unjust dealings towards us have been such, that you repeat the same things over and over, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our Principles,</HI> as if they had never been answered, or disowned at all. Now we ask would you be w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ling the Papists or others should put you upon disowing those Eminent primitive Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>as William <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wil∣liam Thorp Sadeel, Martin Luther &amp;c: about Succession Priesthood, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orced Maintenance, Priests Annual Wages Tythes Oathes Ʋni∣versities, restrained Preaching, Women's Preaching &amp;c:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cited in this Appendix, under the penalty of being entituled to those re∣cited

Surely, if they should so put you to it, it would be a great pinch upon you; your doctrines and practices in those respects being so manifestly <HI>contray to those famous Reformers;</HI> as well as it is con¦trary to ours: whereas most of those things you so loudly charge against us as heresies and blasphemies &amp;c: are your own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>a∣tions, perversion or down<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght nothings viz: there are no such words as you cite, and which our now business is partly to make complaint against you for, and put you to the proof of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and do expect you should in print make good those charges <HI>in the Bomb and D: L's Almanack seeing J: T: hath espoused them</HI> both ma∣king good the Scripture-Proverb viz: <HI>Like Priest like people.</HI></P>
<P>☞<HI>Caleb Pusey</HI> not only tells <HI>D: L:</HI> of divers falshoods contained in his Trumpet and other Prin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; but also plainly tells b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h where they are and what they be: and therefore now we call upon them to prove in as publick a manner as they have charged or else we do Justly expect they should as publickly acknowledge they have wronged us: Pray do not trifle with us, nor flout at us <HI>about in∣fallibility</HI> as some of you have done, because we cannot retract th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or errors which is your manifest perversions &amp;c: and yet at the same time refuse to do us justice by proving or retracting what you have so unjustly charged upon us; however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f among the many writings that our friends have writ these fifty years or up∣wards there appear any passage that is not justifiable, be it misprision of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rkship faults in printing, slip of the pen; or if by com∣paring the rest of his works it appear an error of the mind, we hope we never shall vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate in such case.</P>
<P>We find Calv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed by Daniel Philips for saying thus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vind: Veri page, 64.

<P>And now we shall desire the Candid Reader, that in reading the following charges against these men, and our observations on them that he read and consider them very impartially; but before we re∣cite them we also request the Reader that he would be Pleased to take the advice given by these eminent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersons following <HI>concern∣ing the reading of books.</HI></P>
<P>The first is the famous <HI>John Lock,</HI> who saith thus <Q>To have one's words exact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> quoted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cited by the said D: P: pa: 97, 98.</NOTE> and their mean∣ing interpreted by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp; visible <HI>design of the Au∣thor in his whole discourse</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing a right that every writer hath a ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t claim to and such as a lover of truth will be very wary of v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ating</Q></P>
<P>The next is Bishop Rider in his Demonstration of the Messias, who is of an opinion, That we are to be governed as to the sig∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fication of a word by the contex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> &amp; subject matter.</P>
<P>Js<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s is of an opinion <Q>That a man must not take <HI>little piece-meals</HI> by themselves and put that sense upon them that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rst comes into his head but he must weigh every word and <HI>exa∣min the context, the subject matter in which it treats on, and why it was written so.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now this Justice is wanting in our present adversaries; there∣fore let the reader bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke these famous mens advice in the read∣ing of our friends books; let him but honestly examine the con∣text, and the subject matter of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rears and why it was so written; and I doubt not at all but we shall appear to all im∣partial and sensible people to be such as deserve not that odious Contractor given us by these men.</P>
<P>And so we proceed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rges and begin first with the <HI>Bomb;</HI> the charges in which is J: T's task now particularly to
<PB N="14" REF="001230_0013_0FB17D502BF305B8"/>prove; in which altho' we have corrected above twenty to them, yet we find but <HI>four</HI> places quoted by them out of our friends books, and they grosly abused; and there being so many charges and so few quotations produced as proof: it therefore we had no other reasons to reject J: T's printed challenge, yet that of it self had been sufficient for now should we <HI>weigh every word, examins the Context &amp; Subject which it treats on, and why it was so written?</HI> How should we have the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> meaning interpreted by the plain and <HI>visible design of the Author in his whole discourse,</HI> as the above per∣sons have laid down as a right and just method to be taken in read∣ing of books if we know not a reasonable time afore-hand what the books and pages are in order thereto? but seeing, as to the Bomb, it is otherwise, our method therefore of shewing our books, as herein after advertised, will have the less effect in re∣lation to satisfy the inquisitive and unprejudiced reader; there∣fore, as to that, we can but take the charges as they have gi∣ven them, which are as followeth.</P>
<P><LABEL>Bomb.</LABEL> <HI>First by their contempt of the Holy Scriptures, calling them Dust Death and Serpent's meat beastly ware <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><LABEL>Ans:</LABEL> This with many other things have been so often answered that we think it meerly needless to say much more of it; and as to the word Dust, it was no ways spoken in contempt of the Ho∣ly Scriptures; but it was written against some few of old who ran so far into an extteam as to <HI>Deify as it were the very letter of the Scriptures,</HI> which, to be sure, may be termed Dust; and that there were such Priests see <HI>G: F's Great Mystery page 261;</HI> how one Roger Atkins affirmed <HI>That the Letter of the Scripture is God.</HI> And Richard Stoaks affirmed that the <HI>Scripture is God.</HI> And Jeremiah Jves affirmed, it was an error to say, the Letter of the Scripture <HI>is carnal.</HI> ibid: page 111.</P>
<P>Now, tho' our friends in those days have seemed to some to run something into an extream by using such expressions as they did
<PB N="15" REF="001230_0014_0FB17D51AA9D4958"/>in opposition to such extreams of those sort of priests, whose said crooked expressions did need straightning: we hope they are not to be condemned for using endeavours as they did for that end. As for the word Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vind: Veritatis, page, 192.</NOTE> as D: Philips saith, what difference is there between <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aying, the Letter killeth, and the Letter is death; for the <HI>Apostle in Cor: 2.3 6. saith, The Letter killeth;</HI> and is not the sense the same, tho' differently worded; and surely as the Apostle used not any slighting expression of the Scripture; no more, we are well satisfied, did G: F: &amp;c. As for the words, Serpents meat, see also what the said D: P: shews us in the same page, how the adversary abusively joyned those following words together; which are not so in G: F's book viz. Your word is carnal. The Letter and the Light is carnal. The Letter, and so dust is the Serpents meat &amp;c. Now to this D: P: aptly answers and sayes, whereas, in that page there are twelve lines between, The Light is carnal the letter, and so dust is the Serpents meat: in this in∣termediate space G: F: treats of Infants Baptism and the Lord's Supper: from these two Subjects coming between two Propositi∣ons. I conclude, no man that understands a Pro∣position will say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sober Expostula∣tion pa: 104.</NOTE> <HI>So dust is the Serpents meat is pre∣dicated of the Letter, consequently no wayes respects the Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>As for those words <HI>Beastly ware,</HI> we are, as to that, also much abused, G: W: saith. <Q>I have examined the said book out of which the said expressions have been pretended to be taken, I find no such gross expressions, as calling the Scripture, beastly ware, but divers severe reflections upon the co∣vetous, persecuting priests in those days; writ by some prisoners at York-Castle, 1653:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A brief Disco∣very, pa: 9.</NOTE> and what is there called beastly ware, is not the Scriptures▪ but what Ba∣bylons Merchants <HI>sell for a large price (i: e.)</HI> A rabble of no∣tions
<PB N="16" REF="001230_0015_0FB17D540CC3E608"/>heaped up in the brain all the week; and which they sell for lucres sake &amp;c: calling them also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> merchants, costly Sermon-makers who persecuted the pure truth the Saints lived in: but not a word of calling <HI>the Scriptures beastly ware;</HI> and I am perswaded such blasphemy and contempt of the Holy Scriptures was far from the thoughts of the said prisoners &amp; that which they would <HI>have abominated and rejected with abhor∣rence, if they had been charged therewith.</HI></Q></P>
<P>As for the word <HI>Jdol,</HI> seeing there is no book quoted, we only say thus, that to set up any creature so as to call it God, is to idolize that creature; but in those days, as above, some Priests did so set up the Letter, which is a creature, so as to call it God. What then did they less than idolize the creature?</P>
<P>But now, to shew that our friends have from the beginning had a high and reverend esteem of the Holy Scriptures, see first what G: F: saith of them in answer to those very priests that said the Letter was God &amp;c. In answer to the said Roger Atkins he lays down the said Roger's words, and answers thus, the priest having said the Letter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Scripture was God, it was asked, <HI>If the Letter Paper and Ink was God? And he said it was God,</HI> and brought Io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, 1: to prove it. And again, he said the Letter was the word of God, G: F: answers. <Q>The Scriptures of Truth, they are the <HI>words of God</HI> and were all learned of God.</Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Mystery, page, 261.</NOTE> <Q><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Scriptures are not God, but they were holy men of God, which learned of God which spake them forth.</Q> And in his answer to the said Richard Stoaks, he saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. pa 111.</NOTE> <Q>And the Scriptures of Truth are not God, <HI>but are his wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> that cannot be broken</Q> And in his answer to the said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> holding that the Letter of the Scripture is not car∣nal G F: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> The Letter of the Scripture, <HI>Paper and ink,</HI> we cannot say is spiritual, but that which it <HI>speaks of is spi∣ritual.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="001230_0016_0FB17D560464BD98"/>And Edward Burrough saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> page, 104.</NOTE> the Scripture is a declaration of the word, and what is written of, is the word [mark that] Again he saith, I do honour the Scrip∣ture <HI>above other writings,</HI> and give them the authority,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> esteem and respect due unto them, and more I dare not.</P>
<P>And in the book called Several Papers &amp;c: published by G: F: in the year 1654, there it is said thus concerning the Scriptures, they are a <HI>true declaration</HI> of that word which was in them that gave or spake them forth, and are of no private interpretation; but were given forth to be read, and fulfilled in the Saints as they were given forth by the Holy Ghost, without adding or di∣minishing; and were not given forth for men <HI>to make a trade of or get money by:</HI> but as they are, they are profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto every good work.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1655. page, 2.</NOTE>And Richard Farnsworth in his book called <HI>The Scriptures Vindication</HI> saith (in answer to a priest say∣ing that we say the Scriptures are not the word of truth) that the Scriptures are words that proceeded from <HI>the Spirit of Truth</HI> we do not deny but own, and so they are words of truth: but that the Scriptures are the word of God and eternal life as thou wouldest have them to be, thou canst not prove. And in his book called <HI>The Holy Scriptures cleared from scandal,</HI> He saith, the Scriptures I own, and that holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. And such have the be∣nefit and comfort of the Scriptures as they are guided by the Ho∣ly Ghost &amp;c. Multitudes of instances of our truly owning the Ho∣ly Scriptures we might produce, but this we hope is sufficient to satisfy any sober enquirer, and detect the falshoods of these our false accusers.</P>

<P>As for the <HI>Bomb's</HI> fourth charge about Baptism and the Supper he meerly begs the question in saying we neglect, contemn and deny the Sacred Ordinances of the Gospel, namely Baptism &amp;c: for we do not understand that by Scripture those outward things, as eating bread and drinking wine, and sprinkling Infants having sureties called God-fathers and God-mothers to promise that the child shall forsake the Devil and all his works &amp;c: were any of the Ordinances of the Gospel: Concerning all which having already answered so many Objections about it, we see no need to say more of it here. <HI>But see R: Barclay's Apology, and Thomas Lawson's Treatise of Baptism &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><LABEL>Bomb.</LABEL> <HI>That they undervalue the Death and Sufferings of our Sa∣viour, by affirming not only their own sufferings to be not onely great∣er but more unjust than the Sufferings of Christ, his Apostles and blessed Martyrs.</HI></P>
<P><LABEL>Ans:</LABEL> This we know <HI>Francis Bugg</HI> hath long ago laid to the charge of Edward Burrough, concerning which tho' we grant that passage of E: B's was not safely worded, yet we really believe, considering (according to the above Isodorus his advice) the Context, the Subject of which it treats, <HI>and why it was so written,</HI> his meaning was no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the least, to undervalue the Death and Sufferings of our Saviour, nor to set up or compare our friends Sufferings to his, as in themselves; <HI>but that they were more unjust,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="001230_0019_0FB17D59F7816960"/><HI>according to the Laws of men:</HI> Those Persecutors who put our Sa∣viour to death of old having a Law, as they thought, for what they did, saying we have a Law, and by our Law he ought to die: And in Queen Marie's days they persecuted according to their unjust Laws; but those Persecutors that <HI>Edward Burrough</HI> spoke of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">E.

Hereby, saith he, it appears the sufferings to be more unjust (viz:) in the Persecutors (meaning than in the days of Christ, the Abo∣stles and Martyrs) because what the Persecutors of old did to the people of God, they did by a Law, and by the due execution of a Law; but now many are caused to suffer deeply, whom the transgression of no Law, good or bad (saith he) can be charged against, and others suffer without the due execution of a Law. Again (saith he) many now suffer cruel things about trivial and foolish matters, as for not pulling off a hat, or for theeing of men. Again (saith he) hundreds have suffered upon suspicion when nothing at all can be charged against them, and this is contrary to Magna Charta. Is it not clear that these words of E: B's are very naturally construed above to be his intent and meaning? tho' we still say they were not safely worded: How∣ever it doth not follow from his, or any other friends words or sentences mistaken or misworded, that therefore they are not true Ministers &amp;c: <HI>as to the main of their ministry;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam: 16: 6 7.</NOTE> for was not the Prophet Samuel mistake <HI>when he took Eliab to be the Lord's Anointed?</HI> Was not that Eminent Apostle, Peter something blameable when Paul withstood him to his face; be∣cause, saith he, <HI>he was to be blamed, Gal: 2 11:</HI> Yet surely these men were friends of God Ministers of Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Apostles &amp;c.</P>

<P>We now come to other charges against us in the Bomb, which we expect J: Talbot should also prove as publickly as there char∣ged, or else that he should as publickly acknowledge he hath wronged us; seeing he hath so far espoused it, as to offer to prove it. The first is.</P>

<P><LABEL>Bomb.</LABEL> <HI>They tell us that the Name Jesus and Christ belongs to every member as well as as to the head, meaning, as well to every believing Quaker, as to Christ the head.</HI></P>

What I: P: said, was by way of question, and he concludes his question with this caution (viz:) <Q>So that the Name is not given to the Vessel, but to the Nature, to the hea∣venly treasure, to that which is of him in the Vessel, to that which the Lord from heaven begets in his own Image and like∣ness of his own substance, of his own seed, of his own Spirit &amp; pure life &amp;c:</Q> But for the word Jesus it's the Bomb's addition, Isaac Pennington hath not there the word Jesus mentioned: Yet, tho' Jesus signifies a Saviour and therefore a name most proper∣ly and peculiarly belonging to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; yet we find <HI>the Saints are called Saviours also.</HI></P>

<P>As for Edward Burrough's saying in the year 1656 to the Priests and Professors that we had sufficient cause to cry against them, and to deny their Church, their worship and their whole religion: His next following words explain his meaning (viz:) as not being in the power and by the spirit of the living God, as commanded of him, or practic'd [mark practic'd] by his saints; so that it appears it was their <HI>practical, not their professing part that E: B: chiefly struck at.</HI></P>
<P><LABEL>Bomb.</LABEL> <HI>That our Service-Book bottom'd on divine authority &amp;c: is idolatrous because we pray: O Son of David have mercy on us.</HI></P>
<P><LABEL>Ans:</LABEL> <HI>A very notorious falshood.</HI> We deny the charge. We E∣steem it no ways idolatrous to say, O Son of David have mercy upon us. And we deny the Service-Book to be bottom'd on di∣vine authority; it hath been rather composed, and kept up by humane authority, there being no Scripture-rule directing, nor pretence of any being required of God to set up such a limited form of worship; however we deny it not for the reason the Bomb, as above, alledg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h</P>

<P><LABEL>Ans:</LABEL> Where is now the Bomb's charity; thus by whole-sale, with his foolish and overtly distinction, to unchristian us; how∣ever, we are no more convinced than the Bomb hath proved that when we dine it's our bounden duty to say Good Lord par∣don our sins &amp;c: There is no precept nor practice for it in all
<PB N="24" REF="001230_0023_0FB17D60B5C6DC68"/>the Scripture; however it's not the words but the custom and manner of it, without waiting for the motion of life to a duty, that occasions our testimony against joyning with it, and seeing they say they are in duty bound to use the like words when they go to meals, how is it then that so many of themselves so often sit down thereto <HI>and use no words at all, and others not those words?</HI> neither are those words to be found in any of their Graces which they have ordered to be said before and after mean: but y<SUP>t</SUP> we say, to pray for Jesus Christ's sake, <HI>is to pray, petition and give thanks in the name, and for the sake of a dead God,</HI> is like the rest of his nauseous stuff and abuses. Edward Burrough saith not a word of praying in the name of Jesus, nor for Christ's sake in either of the pages cited by the Bomb: It's true in 1655 he writ sharply against the priests of that time, who were so often <HI>praying and petition∣ing</HI> the then powers against our friends, as in the Westmorland petition may be seen; which petitions and prayers were too much hearkened unto by them: which caused our friends to be greatly persecuted by those powers; therefore it's no wonder we find <HI>Edward Burrough in page</HI> 101, telling them, as he doth, that the beast was risen in defence of them, and then told them how they prayed <HI>to their dead Gods, and preach'd to their ignorant people against God's heritage:</HI> But not a word of a dead God, or of praying to God or Christ or Jesus do we find in that page, nor in any part of that Chapter, nor in any part of page 518 cited also by the Bomb.

<P><LABEL>Ans:</LABEL> When he hath prov'd this as publickly as charged, we shall then grant he hath done good service for friends; but till then we shall sit down well assured of the contrary; how∣ever,
<PB N="25" REF="001230_0024_0FB17D628C224320"/>no honest or judicious man should so publickly and in such a lavish manner accuse his neighbours, but should as publickly, when required by the accused, either make good what he saith, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as publickly acknowledge his fault: One of which we expect from him, as he would approve himself such; for we utterly <HI>deny this lavish and monstrous charge.</HI></P>

<P><LABEL>Bomb.</LABEL> <HI>They render the Holy Scriptures to be of no more Au∣thority than Aesop's Fables.</HI></P>
<P><LABEL>Ans:</LABEL> This is as false, as it is alledged without proof.

And as we find things thus under the Gospel (viz) the Temple of God to be the bodies of the Saints and that the time of reformation is come in which ended the meats, drinks, divers washings and carnal or∣dinances, and the washing is now to be with pure water, and the Sprink∣ling is to be that of the heart, from an evil Conscience; and that the Baptism and drinking is to be by and into one Spirit, and the singing is to be in the Spirit: and in short that the Father is to be worship'd in Spirit. So that upon the whole we cannot therefore find it any ways unscriptural to conclude that none of those things are now outwardly to be practis'd as Ordinances of the Gospel Commanded by our blessed Saviour or his holy Apostles; but rather that it is something <HI>besides the very nature of the new Covenant as distinguished from the old,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 8.10.</NOTE> which new Co∣venant was, that God would write his Law <HI>in the heart</HI> and put his Spirit in the inward part, and he would dwell <HI>in them</HI> and walk <HI>in them,</HI> and be their God, and that they should be his People. But that many of those above things, as hath been said, were practised by some outwardly in the Apostles days, is true; and by the Apostle's words it seem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they were not all of necessity, then presently to vanish away, for in the same Chapter wherein he was treating of the new Covenant as a∣foresaid, as minding those words, that the Lord would make a new Co∣venant &amp;c.

<P>☞<HI>Bernard</HI> in his Epistle 341 saith, <Q>The discipline of <HI>Silence</HI> seemeth burdensome unto some;<NOTE PLACE="marg">pa: 129.</NOTE> but the Prophet considering that it was rather a strength than a burden, saith, <HI>In silence and in hope shall be your strengh,</HI> in silence (he saith) and hope; <HI>for it is good to wait for the Lord in Silence:</HI> for the consolation of present things weakneth the Soul, but the expectation of future things doth strength∣en it.</Q> Now this of receiving strength by waiting on the Lord in silence, well agrees also with the Prophet in another place who saith. <HI>Keep silence before me O Islands, let the people renew their strength, Isaiah</HI> 41▪ 1.

<P>Much more might be instanced than what's at the beginning of this Appendix, out of the Holy Scripture concerning the Light of Christian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as also than what hath been here produced out of the Fathers; but at present we shall wave them till further occasion offers. Howbeit by what hath been produced from both may be clearly seen the weak∣ness and folly of those who term, such as turn from the Inventions and Traditions of men to believe in, embrace and walk in this Light, to be such as run after new Lights, as hath been often, but very foolishly ob∣jected against us: and indeed it's only said, but not proved, for it's no o∣ther than an old Gospel Truth, (though much clouded and obscured from men by the misty times of darkness, and by divers humane inventions &amp; Traditions) that God is Light and as God is Light; so should we walk in the Light, that we may have fellowship one with another, and that the blood of Christ may cleanse us from all Sin. And this being the mes∣sage they had to declare of old, it's not novell but an old, necessary Gos∣pel Truth, to declare the same thing now in order that a man may attain the same end, (to wit) to be cleansed from Sin, from which cleansing follows the Salvation of the Soul.

<P><HI>Doctor John Edwards</HI> in his free Discourse concerning Truth and Error, faith of the Quakers thus, <Q>The Quakers are very strict and precise in their Looks, Garbs, Speech and Behaviour above other persons, and make great shew of Sobriety and self Denyal; whilst they talk much of a Light within them, they do not neglect the outward lustre and shining of their lives: whilst men and women of other perswasions (to their shame be it spoken) are given too much to vain affecting of fa∣shions, to pride of Apparel, to Lightness, Wanttonness and Luxury, things highly unbecoming their holy profession, those persons in the mean time abstain from the Sins of the time, and declare against the vanities of the Age. I have read some of their books (as <HI>Barclays</HI> &amp;c:) with great delight, wherein they exhort to self denial, abandoning of Carnal pleasures, Worldly lusts and Vanities and all Excess; and this with great warmth and Zeal, and in pathetick and choice words <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they excellently represent Temperance, Charity, Gravity, Humility and other moral accomplishments; they worthily extoll a virtuous life, and fall into some noble Raptures, whilest they are doing so.

<P>Now observe, the <HI>Bomb</HI> with his false fire lately thrown among us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith indefinitely, that the Quakers are Cheats, Lyars, Impostors, and that their whole business is to deceive.

And surely there is no shining lustre in Cheats, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yars and Impo∣stors; nor in them who make if their whole business to deceive.

religion is largely treated on) with great delight; but what sort of person would this render the said Doctor to be, to read books with great delight; the tendency of which is to debauch mankind. And whereas the <HI>Bomb</HI> saith, The Quakers are as vile impostors as ever were, the sink of all Heresies &amp;c: Yet we see the said Judicious Judge <HI>Hales</HI> saith, Take away some singularities, they are as other men &amp;c:</P>
<P>And whereas G: K: in his reasons for renouncing Quakerism pa: 14. speaking of the Quakers, saith, If a stranger should ask them what they are, <HI>he could receive no other answer than that they are what other men are not &amp;c:</HI></P>
<P>Now note Reader, the account here given of the Quakers by this par∣tial and inveterate Adversary G: K: and when compared with the above account of the aforesaid Doctor, what will it amount to, (seeing G: K: saith we are only what other men are not) but this, (so wit) that the Quakers a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stain from <HI>the Sins of the times,</HI> but other men do not: the Quakers declare against <HI>the Vanities of the Age,</HI> but other men do not: The Quakers keep up the <HI>outward lustre and shining of their Lives, and exhort to self-denial, abandoning all excess with great We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> and Zeal,</HI> but other men do not: the Quakers <HI>Extoll a virtuous life, so that they seem to preach nothing but a divine life &amp; heaven▪</HI> but other men do not.</P>
<P>Now the reason why these men differ thus widely in their representa∣tions concerning us seems very plain, for that on the one side some speak for self interest; and others from deep prejudice; but the other side from a more impartial and Christian observation of us, and from a more solid and sedate Judgment concerning us.</P>
<P>And likewise concerning the Episcopal Clergy, the said Judge <HI>Hales</HI> saith thus, <Q>As to the Pope's supremacy they disdain it, but if you acknow∣ledge not Episcopal Government, if you swear not Canonical Obedience to your Ordinary, if you submit not to the Liturgy and Ceremonies, Vestments and Musick used in the Church, you are at best a Schisma∣tick.page 28.</Q></P>

<P>WE come now to examine some among the many more of <HI>Daniel Leeds</HI> false charges against our friends; most of which have been in a more brief manner so charged upon him already in print, to which he hath made no reply.</P>
<P>First, We begin with his <HI>News of a Trumpet,</HI> page 6 [marked 7] where D: L▪ cites <HI>Williams Penn</HI> from <HI>Sandy Foundation</HI> pa: 22, <Q>thus since Christ could not pay what was not his own [debt] it follows that in the payment of his own the case still remains equally grievous, since the debt is not hereby absolved or forgiven men but transferr'd only.</Q></P>

<ITEM>1. That it's unlawful and impossible for God Almighty to be gra∣cious and merciful, or to pardon Transgressors, than which what's more unworthy of God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That God was inevitably compelled to this way of saving men, the highest affront to his incontroulable nature.</ITEM>

4. It doth not only disacknowledge the true virtue and real intent of Christ's life and death, but intirely deprives God of that praise which is owing to his greatest Love and Goodness.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. It represents the Son more kind and compassionate than the Fa∣ther, whereas if both be the same God, then either the Father is as loving as the Son, or the Son as angry as the Father.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. It robs God of the Gift of his Son for our Redemption, (which the Scriptures attribute to the unmerited love he had for the World) in affirming the Son purchased that Redemption from the Father by the gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of himself to God as our compleat satisfaction.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Since <HI>Christ</HI> could not pay what was not his own, it follows, that in the payment of his own, the case still remains equally grie∣vous since the debt is not hereby absolved or forgiven, but transferr'd only; and by consequence we are no better provided for Salvation than before, owing that now to the Son which was once owing to the Father.</ITEM>

<P>Observe Reader, here is the whole page inserted verbatim, where thou may see here is no such thing (as since Christ could not pay what was not his own <HI>[debt]</HI> the word <HI>debt</HI> in the Crotchets, being but a Crotchet of D. L's envious brain, both to render <HI>G: Whitehead</HI> and <HI>W: Penn</HI> incon∣sistent with each other, (G: W: having there been cited by him, as count∣ing <HI>T: Danson</HI> a blasphemer for holding that Christ was not Innocent when he suffered for our Sins) and also to render <HI>W: Penn</HI> to hold that Christ was guilty of Sin, [O horrible to think on!] when he so suffered. But as the word <HI>debt</HI> there is not said D: L: <HI>ought therefore to make satis∣faction,</HI> by publickly acknowledging his fault at least.</P>
<P>Again saith D: L: <Q>so here G: W: renders W: P's Doctrine blasphemous for holding that Christ had a debt of his own to satisfie to God, as W: P: those largely affirms,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly: Ibid.</NOTE> pa: 22 of Sandy Foundation.</Q></P>

<PB N="63" REF="001230_0062_0FB17DA42F46EBA8"/>
Is there any such words in any part thereof, as D. L: most abusively ren∣ders W: P: largely to affirm, (to wit) <HI>that Christ had a debt of his own to satisfy to God?</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urely no; for neither largely▪ nor any otherwise doth W: P: in the least affirm a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y such thing, but exactly contrary, where tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may see he there owns there was nothing <HI>due</HI> from Christ, and that he was <HI>Innocent.</HI> It's true it was his own that he laid down, his own life that he give for a ransom Matth: 20: 28. and therefore it was what was his own, according to W: P: that he ransomed us with: but yet it fol∣lows not therefore that it was to pay a <HI>debt of his own;</HI> for what he did therein was for us, as himself said, I lay down my life for the Sheep, John 10.15 &amp; if for the Sheep, then not to pay a debt of his own. There∣fore in fine, for that <HI>D. L:</HI> hath here publickly exposed W: P: rendring him largely to affirm that Christ had <HI>a Debt of his own to satisfy to God</HI> W: P: having no ways affirmed, nor in the least intimated any such thing but the contrary, as above; it's therefore a horrid abuse and publick slander upon him by D. L: for which <HI>he ought as publickly to acknowledge his fault.</HI></P>
<P><HI>3ly▪</HI> See again his <HI>News of a Trumpet</HI> pa: 14. where he cites thus, <HI>Christian Quaker</HI> by G: W: pa: 212. <Q>The man is mistaken if he suppose that we plead for the righteousness of a Creature [i, e, Christ as many or mens own righteousness, which he is enabled to perform, as the cause of our Justification &amp;c:</Q></P>
<P>Note G: W: was here answering one <HI>Stephen Scandret,</HI> who it seems in his pa: 99. spake of a four <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old righteousness, the fourth of which as he worded it, was thus (viz) the perfect, everlasting and infinitely pre∣cious obedience of the Lord Jesus Christ; this last the best robe to be the righteousness of God himself. Now G: W: having before spoken something about the other three, he comes to the fourth. But the said <HI>S: S:</HI> having alledged that this fourth righteousness is the perfect &amp;c: o∣bedience of our Lord Jesus Christ as above; and this being said as it seems he thought, in opposition to the Quakers, whom it's like, he also supposed, according to the then too much vulgar mistake, to have held that the righteousness of a Creature, even mans own righteousness which of our selves we are able to perform, was the cause of our Justification &amp;c: To rectify which mistake <HI>G: W:</HI> begins his reply, as is here under, truly and more fully Cited than D L. hath done it, which is this. <Q>The man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that we plead either the righte∣ousness of a Creature, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> righteousness, which he himself
<PB N="64" REF="001230_0063_0FB17DA676707278"/>
is enabled to perform, as the cause of our Justification. For Christ that strengthens us and enables us by his Power and Spirit dwelling in us to do the Fathers will, he is the ground and cause of our Justi∣fication, and in him, who is the beloved, are we accepted &amp;c:</Q></P>
<P>Observe here, We justly charge <HI>D: L:</HI> of abusing G: W: by adding those words, as the Reader may see, [i, e, Christ, as man] to G: W's words there by making the passage to look so erroneous as if we put a slight upon the righteousness of <HI>Christ, as man,</HI> or what he did, as man, for us. But for that there is no such words writ by G: W: but foisted in by D: L: therefore for this he ought <HI>as publickly to acknowledge his fault.</HI></P>
<P><HI>4ly.</HI> Again D: L: in pa: 23. of his <HI>Trumpet</HI> cites <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> thus G: W's <HI>Nature of Christianity</HI> pa: 29. "Christ hath not the body of man▪</P>
<P>But the whole page of G: W: truly cited, is thus to his opponent: <Q>see thy manifest contradiction (viz.) a perfect Justification and redemption (of sinners) without them, when no good is wrought in them (contra) but now it must be done by Christ's appearance in believers, through Faith by his Spirit.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As also thou grantest that his appearing the second time, is without Sin to Salvation, but when thinkest thou that must be, is it in this life or hereafter? thou sayest that after the bodily death you shall be raised out of the Grave, and made partakers of that Salvation pa: 13. 'tis strange the Salvation of sinners, yea of the whole world, as thy word is should be completed at once above sixteen hundred years since, (from whence thou shouldest look upon us, whom thou revilest and condemnest to be in as good a state as thy self) as yet to be so long after death looked for, how long is not known to thee; or dost thou look for Christ as the Son of <HI>Mary</HI> to appear outwardly in a bodily existence to save thee according to thy words pa: 30? If thou dost; thou may look untill thy Eyes drop out, before thou wilt see such an appearance of him.</Q></P>
<P>Observe here is the whole page, &amp; as the then whole debate betwixt G: W: &amp; his opposer was, about the way &amp; manner of obtaining Salva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on by Christ: so <HI>Robert Gordin</HI> it seems expected it should be done by Christ as the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> appearing outwardly in a bodily existence which occasioned G W <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> say if thou dost, thou may look till thy Ey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out &amp;c. which pos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y this time may be true in fact. And the G. W. opposes R. G's looking for Christ's appearing outwardly in a bodily exi∣stence
<PB N="65" REF="001230_0064_0FB17DA810999688"/>to SAVE MEN which was the subject then in Controversy; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> neither of which, nor yet any other ways doth he deny Christ to have <HI>the body of man,</HI> no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that his body doth exist outwardly. And seeing the being or existence of Christ is of God head and Soul as well as body, it's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re surely improper to say that Christ IS; but rather more proper, that Christ HATH a bodily existence without us. To be short, D: L: having most falsly accused G: W: of saying and holding such false do∣ctrine, as that Christ hath not <HI>the body of man,</HI> G: W: saying no such thing; therefore for this <HI>he ought to make satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P>And note tho' <HI>D: L:</HI> hath here falsly accused G: W: of denying Christ to have the body of man, yet in the self same page, endeavouring to squeeze from him a Contradiction, he quotes the same G: W: in answer to <HI>W: Haworth,</HI> (near thirty years ago <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> largely owning Christ to have the bo∣dy of man, [thus,] <Q>Christ did rise in that body wherein he suffered, and in the same ascended into the heavens. — And it's so far circum∣scribed in the heavens, as 'tis capable of, and as is proper to it; and tho it be Spiritual and Glorious, yet a body, and therefore not in eve∣ry place where God is.</Q> Note, this with much more, and of older date, too tedious here to name, being near thirty years ago, It's in vain to tell us now we did not own these things till after <HI>Francis Bugg;</HI> the <HI>Snake</HI> and G: K: had writ against us &amp;c: a Story they have of late endeavo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red to impose upon the Reader.</P>
<P N="5">5 Again in his <HI>Almanack,</HI> on the month <HI>January</HI> 1703: he cities W: P: from <HI>Quakerism a New Nick name &amp;c:</HI> pa: 6. saying, <Q>Faith in Christ's outward manifestation is a deadly poyson these latter ages have been infected with, to the destruction of goldly Living.</Q> This <HI>D. L.</HI> and <HI>G. K.</HI> have published over and over; and therefore I shall cite the whole page 6. of W. P's said book▪ with a few lines for connexion's sake, in pages 5 and 7 which is thus, <Q>Christianity then is not an historical belief of the exterior acts the true Christ did in that bodily, appearance, which is but historical Christianity, as our Adversary weakly argues, pa. 4. for that was the least part of it, since Christianity is that which brings to God; which thousands which believe the other, never arrive at: <HI>but a firm belief in him that so appeared lived, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, rose and ascended,</HI> both as testified of in the Scriptures of Truth, and more especially as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaks in upon the Soul by his divine discoveries, as the true Light enlightening every man. This I call Christianity; and that man is a
<PB N="66" REF="001230_0065_0FB17DA975C92A40"/>
Child of Light, who obeys that Light, a true Christian, who is Christ-like, a Child of God, and heir of the promise, who is inwardly renew∣ed and begot anew of the incorruptible Seed and Word of God; for those who were Christians of Old, were such as came to know Christ no more after the flesh, but as the second <HI>Adam,</HI> the Lord from hea∣ven, the quickning Spirit, who said I am the Resurrection and the Life, really witnessing him to be that in themselves; wherefore they believ∣ed, and upon repentance received remission of Sins and eternal Salvation. And I do affirm that Christianity stands in the manifestation of a mea∣sure of that righteousness, power, wisdom, truth and life in the Soul, which appeared so gloriously in that Body at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to work re∣pentance, then give remission, so renew, redeem and finally save: And who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be made sensible of that heavenly treasure in their mor∣tal bodies, and to improve it as good Stewards, were possessors of true Christianity, and therefore right Christians, the distinction betwixt mo∣ral and Christian: the making holy life legal, and faith in the history of Christ's outward manifestation, Christianity, hath been a deadly poyson, these latter Ages have been infected with, to the destruction of godly living, and apostatizing of those Churches in whom there might once have been begotten some earnest living thirst after the inward life of righteousness.</Q></P>
<P>Observe here are <HI>W. P</HI>'s words verbatim, not only the whole page, but the whole Section, placing the word [manifestation] in it's proper place, as it is corrected in the Errata; and we see he did not call <HI>faith in Christ's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> manifestation a deadly poyson,</HI> but on the contrary, it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s clear he did in express words then own a firm belief <HI>in him that so viz. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s manifested, lived, died, rose and ascended.</HI> But it was such as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a holy life, slightingly calling that legal, and so making faith only in the history of Christ being outwardly manifested, to be Christianity,</HI> was what W P so testified against; but W. P. had a better and more Christian understanding, than to render faith in Christ's outward manifestation, a deadly poyson, but 'twas <HI>the slighting and excluding holy life,</HI> from having a share in Christianity, calling that legal, as the place clearly shews that W. P. so struck at. And truly tho' these opposers run so ati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t at him a∣bout it, yet W. P. is not without good company on his side▪ he hath the great and eminent <HI>Apost<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Paul,</HI> who told the <HI>Church</HI> at the <HI>Romans</HI> who had then faith in Christ's outward manifestation) so as he tells them
<PB N="67" REF="001230_0066_0FB17DAB010E0118"/>
their <HI>Faith was spoken of throughout the whole world.</HI> Rom: 1.8. yet he also told them that <HI>if they lived after the flesh, they should dye; but if thro' the Spirit they should mortify the deeds of the body they should live,</HI> 8.13. Again he exhorted the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> (who, to be sure, had also faith in Christ's outward manifestation, for he called them his <HI>holy bre∣thren, and partakers of the heavenly calling,</HI> Heb. 3.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) <HI>to follow peace with all men, and holiness without which no man should see the Lord,</HI> 12.14. Here the Apostle, as well as W: P: enjoins the necessity of a ho∣ly life upon them, who then already had the faith of Christ's outward manifestation: So that we see, it was not that faith alone that was suf∣ficient, as the Apostle <HI>James</HI> also very expre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly hath it, saying, <HI>Faith, if it hath not works, is dead being alone.</HI> James, 2, 17. <HI>And that by w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ks faith was made perfect</HI> verse 22. <HI>You see then</HI> (saith he again) <HI>how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</HI> verse 24. and again, That <HI>as the body without the Spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</HI> verse 26. So that we see the difference betwixt what the A∣postles, and what W: P: said in the matter, lies only in the wording, but not in the doctrinal part; neither were the Apostles words at all times nor in this case the fame, tho' their doctrine was. But to conclude, D. L. having affirmed that W. P. did here call <HI>Faith in Christ's outward mani∣festation, a deadly poyson,</HI> it is a very great falshood in him, and as great an abuse upon W. P. for which the said D. L. <HI>ought to make satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P>Again see D. L.'s <HI>Almanack, November</HI> month 1703 where he accuses <HI>G: F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x</HI> of mangling and perverting a Priest's words, which if true, D: L. above most men should have been silent, he being, in his observation there∣on guilty of no less tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> base forgery against W. P. concerning which hear him, for saith he, <Q>But have they no cloke to cover these forgeries of G F's? Yes, the fluent Tong<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed <HI>Penn</HI> hath inverted such a cover as no Equivocating Jesuite could out do it, 'tis in <HI>Penn</HI>'s preface to G.

<P>Now the said Preface having been diligently perused, we do affirm D. L. hath most grievously abused W. P. in this matter also. That part of W. P's preface wherein we find words most like to those wherein D L. hath so extravagantly and lavishly abused him; is this. W.

And indeed the words in themselves seem to import thus (viz) that, by the North therein menti∣oned that was prophesied of, did allude to what the Prophet prophesied of bringing God's people out of the North Countrey, which was then in measure fulfilled in a Christian and Spiritual sense, as more plainly appears by the following words (which D. L: very unwarrantably left out) viz: <HI>the army is coming out of the North against you terrible ones &amp;c:</HI> as above. And it seems that by the <HI>North</HI> we may understand an alluding to the place whither the people had been driven, and from whence, at their return, they shall, as saith the Lord, <HI>come with weeping; and with supplication will I read them I will cause them to walk by the rivers of wa∣ters in a strait way wherein they shall not st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mble,</HI> see <HI>Jerom:</HI> 16: 15 &amp; 31: 8. Neither do we find in that book called <HI>News out of the North,</HI> any thing that had the least tendency of giving particularly any news out of the <HI>North</HI> litterally speaking, so that, to conclude, we find it a pie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of base forgery in D. L: First, to add those words [called <HI>George Fox</HI>] and secondly, that he added them nineteen words, before the passage was
<PB N="70" REF="001230_0069_0FB17DB02E26D1C0"/>
ended, to which he added them, and then quite leaving out the said part. For all which publick abuses <HI>he ought to make publick satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P>Again in his <HI>January</HI> month 1704. D: L: hath it expressly thus. <Q>The Scriptures (saith <HI>Francis Howgil)</HI> are the Attire of the Whore, of false Church, which brings none to know God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ. page <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>11 of his Works.</Q></P>
<P>This is also a great falshood; and to shew the Reader, the more plain, that it is so, we have taken pains and transcribed from the begin∣ning of the Chapter to several lines after those words [the attire of the Whore] are mentioned, which take as followeth. <Q>For since the Apo∣stles days, their foundation hath been taken, either Traditions, Imita∣tions, Inventions of their own brain, or borrowed things from the Jews in the first Covenant, or at the best, the Letter hath been the ground of their faith and foundation, which they have turned and translated this way, and that, according to the wit and reason of every particular Sect and opinion; and according to the understanding of their private Spi∣rit: now all these Buildings and Towers that men have builded up in the Apostacy, they would fasten upon the writings of the holy men of God, and so have raised an imagination of their own, and so would have the Scripture prove what they say; and the writings of the A∣postles, they all call the Gospel; and the word of faith, and the Light of the Gospel, and the foundation and the Tryer of Spirits, and the Touchstone, and say, it's the foundation of their faith and religi∣on; and so are all in the distraction, one envying another, and per∣secuting one another about the words of Truth, spoken from the Spi∣rit of Truth, which cannot be understood again, but by the same Spi∣rit, &amp; so all them <HI>that have not the Spirit of Truth, are in the Apostacy; and all Sects, Judgments and Opinions that have risen up since the A∣postacy from the faith that hath been once delivered to the Saints,</HI> when the Woman travailed and brought forth a Man child, which after be∣cause of the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agons power, fled into the wilderness, and her Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d was caught up unto God. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the Faith and Worship, that since is sprung up, since the Whore hath sitten as a Queen in Majesty, is all de∣ni'd <HI>the Ground of her Worship, Laws, Traditions, Inventions, and all their Invented Practices and Forms, and Images, and Likenesses are de∣nied and disowned, as to be the dress and attire of the whore, which hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> people through her enticing pretences, and shews of holiness;</HI> when indeed all is but spiritual adultery, and this must be all turned
<PB N="71" REF="001230_0070_0FB17DB2414B6FA8"/>
under again, the Whore's flesh burned, and her attire plucked off, and her nakedness appear, and her shame to them that have committed for∣nication with her, and they shall be ashamed of themselves and of her, and abh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r themselves, and abhor her, and destroyed shall she be; and the Lambs Wife shall be beautified and come out of the secret place into open view, out of the Solitary wilderness, into the beautiful place, that the Lord will bring<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her into. And after sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ And the many changeable dresses of the Whore, many attires in which she hath appeared, and Imaginary Worships into which all have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un, since they were Apostatized from the faith, all this shall be disannulled and come to an end.</Q></P>
<P>Observe reader, here is all that's mentioned of the attire of the Whore, is there any thing here said as D: L: asserts, viz: <HI>that the Scripture is the attire of the Whore, the false Church which brings none to know God or Christ?</HI> No, we see it was the ground of their Worship, Laws, &amp;c: that sprung up in the Apostacy, since the Whore sate as a Queen, that had not the Spirit to give them the understanding of the Scripture, and all the invented Practices, Forms and Images of the divers Opinions, which they all wrongfully pretend the Scripture was the foundation of, when it was only their own twisting and turning them &amp;c: Was that he called the <HI>At∣tire of the Whore;</HI> but as to the Scriptures, we see he expresly calls them <HI>the Writings of the holy men of God, words of Truth spoken from the Spirit of Truth &amp;c:</HI> but as the reader may see, he doth not call the Scripture <HI>the Attire of the Whore, the false Church which brings none to know God or Christ,</HI> as this D: L: so very abusively, expressly renders him to say; therefore for this also <HI>he ought to make satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P>Again, see his <HI>May</HI> month 1704▪ he cites a passage of a blasphemous Letter, which he saith, was writ by <HI>John Audland to G: F:</HI> beginning thus <HI>Dear and precious One, in whom is my life bound up, and my strength in thee stands, by thy breathings I am nourished, by thee is my strength re∣newed. Blessed are all they that enjoy thee; Life and strength comes from thee, Holy one &amp;c:</HI></P>
<P>Now as confidently as D: L: affirms this was from <HI>John Audland</HI> in a Letter to G: F: without any pretence of proof that it was so. So we have many reasons to believe the contrary, some of which are aptly laid down by our friend <HI>Joseph Wyeth</HI> in page 483 of the <HI>Switch for the Snake,</HI> which reasons take as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><Q>Some of our Adversaries, as the <HI>Snake</HI> page 115. pretended to give
<PB N="72" REF="001230_0071_0FB17DB3D37D45E8"/>
some pieces of it, [meaning the aforesaid Letter] but have contradicted one another as to the matter of it, by which contradiction in terms it is fully shewn that they could not all be right, as they pretended they were. Again saith he, "this pretended Letter from <HI>John Aud∣land</HI> to G: F: was not so well contrived, but the forgers who have here∣tofore given it with a date, have made it bear date from <HI>Bristoll</HI> Anno 1665. this was a very unlucky oversight, which as it cannot now be mended, so it absolutely overthrows the pretence of it's being his, be∣cause <HI>John Audland</HI> was buried in <HI>Westmoreland</HI> the 24 of the first month 1663, being the last day of that year, so that it appears he was dead about two years before the date of the pretended Letter.</Q></P>
<P>Now observe, since D: L: hath expresly called it <HI>John Audland's</HI> Letter to G: F: upon our disowning and denying it to be so upon such good grounds as above, he ought to prove it as well as charge, and until he so do, how can we esteem him less than a false accuser of us herein also; and fo as that for which he <HI>ought to make satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P>Again, D: L: in his <HI>January</HI> month 1704. hath it thus, <Q><HI>Josiah Coale</HI> page 115 of his Works, brings a passage against the Protestant Mini∣sters, saying, Consider with your selves says he▪ How deplorable a thing it is to see such Hypocritical Intruders stand in a pulpit with such a brazen fac'd book, as is their corrupt &amp; perverse Bible in their hands.</Q></P>
<P>Observe, tho' D: L: in his <HI>Almanack</HI> 1705 disowns that he quoted those above words, as <HI>Josiah Coals</HI> words yet we appeal to the conside∣rate and impartial reader, whether as he had cra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tily worded the above passage, unless any had otherwise known the contrary they could be any otherwise taken than <HI>for Josiahs words;</HI> and they were taken as such, tho' they were the words of a <HI>Papist,</HI> and cited by <HI>Josiah Coale,</HI> as part of a whole Chapter, containing about three pages in quarto of the <HI>Pa∣pist</HI> (but not above five lines about the Bible) whose book against the Protestants or Sectarian Ministers, as the said <HI>Papist</HI> called them, <HI>Josiah</HI> had there answered; and there being in that particular Chapter such matters contained against other Protestants, as about their <HI>Ministers Com∣mission, the King being supreme head of the Church, singing Psalms &amp;c:</HI> which we neither held nor practiced, and that was therefore more proper for them to answer than for him, which he left for them to do if they thought good. But now if D: L: had not cited that part of the said re∣cited <HI>Papist</HI>'s Chapter, which so contumpteously spoke of the Bible on
<PB N="73" REF="001230_0072_0FB17DB4B73C6950"/>
purpose, to make it look like <HI>Josiah's words,</HI> but the Papist's words, why was he not so plain as to tell whose words they were? <HI>three words more would have done it'</HI> And further, why did he not, since he now implicitly pretends he cited them as the Papist's words, cite them truly as they stand in the said <HI>Josiah's</HI> book? no, then he must have cited them, (being the Papist's words) confounding <HI>Singular and plural;</HI> for thus they stand in the Papist's Chapter, viz: <HI>Reader consider with your self &amp;c:</HI> which so to confound singular and plural is not the Quakers way of speaking, so that he might well know that to have so t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uly cited it, would the easier have discovered the trick. But <HI>D: L</HI>'s false citation is, <HI>consider with your selves,</HI> to which he adds, [saith he] to make it look just like our friend <HI>Josiah's words</HI> and language, plainly shewing it was <HI>Josiah</HI> that he would be thought to have meant, for no other [he] was he speaking about, so that all his shifts and quiblings are too short to cover his baseness, and so we also charge D: L: with being a base and false insinuater against us, for which in justice he ought also <HI>to acknowledge his fault.</HI></P>
<P>Again in his <HI>April</HI> month 170<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he cites <HI>Edward Burrough thus.</HI> <Q>O thou North of <HI>England,</HI> who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> counted as desolate and ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en, and reckoned the least of the Nations; yet out of thee did the Branch <HI>[Fox]</HI> spring, and the Star <HI>[F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x]</HI> arise, which gives Light to all the regions round about; in thee the Star of righteousness <HI>[Fox]</HI> appeared.</Q></P>
<P>But <HI>Edward Burrough</HI> truly and more fully cited is thus. <Q>O thou North of <HI>England,</HI> who art counted desolate, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>en, and reckoned the least of the Nations; yet out of thee did the Branch spring, and the Star arise, which gives light unto all the regions round about; in thee the Sun of righteousness appeared with woun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing and healing, and out of thee did the terrour of the Lord proceed, which makes the earth to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emble and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emoved; out of the Kings, Princes and Prophets did come forth in the name of the Most High, which uttered their voices as thunders, and laid their Swords on the necks of their Enemies, and never returned empty from the slaughter. Though I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e at the waters of <HI>Babylon,</HI> in a strange Land▪ and as a Pilgrim and stranger destitute but not forsaken, as dying, but behold I live, yet if I forget thee, let my right-hand forget her Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing &amp;c:</Q></P>
<P>Observe, as much of this passage is to be read and understood in a Spi∣ritual sense, so it was written in an Epistle by <HI>Edward Burrough,</HI> when he was in the Service of the Ministry in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and was directed <HI>to the
<PB N="74" REF="001230_0073_0FB17DB627AB4DD0"/>
Camp of the Lord in England,</HI> to whom he writ in general▪ but as in the North of <HI>England,</HI> his native place, the clear manifestation of the Truth did first most eminently break <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1th, and the Branch, the Star and Sun of righteousness did most eminently appear, so he directed one part of the said Epistle particularly to them, as above in part is mentioned. But that he there called <HI>G: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: the Branch, the Star or Sun of righteousness,</HI> names peculiar and intended only to Christ <HI>the Lord, our Righteousness,</HI> we see is not so; for, as above appears, there is not the name <HI>[F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x],</HI> no, nor is it in any part of the said Epistle, neither could it follow by any conse∣quence that G: F: was meant, for he did not spring out of the North, but rather near the middle of <HI>England;</HI> but for that D: L: hath so pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usely and wretchedly added in those places the word <HI>[Fox]</HI> on purpose to de∣fame our profession, and the professors of it: therefore for this great a∣buse <HI>he ought to make satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P>Again lastly. The last we shall mention at present is, where in his <HI>Ja∣nuary</HI> month 1704. D: L: having there alledged against our friends from <HI>Quakers Refuge</HI> pa: 17. saying that we query whether the Pen man of the Scripture was <HI>Moses or Hermes</HI> &amp;c: the falseness of which I detected in Postscript to last years <HI>Almanack,</HI> he quotes &amp; cites <HI>G: F:</HI> thus, <Q>Then comes their great Apostle <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x</HI> in his <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s Errand,</HI> pa: 7, and saith, The cur∣sed Serpent is in the Letter, which is Earthly and Carnal, Death, beast∣ly ware, Ink and Paper; so these Serpents feed upon dust, and their Gospel is Dust, <HI>Mathew, Mark, Luke</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> which is the Letter which killeth.</Q></P>
<P>Now that the falseness of this Quotation may also plainly appear, we shall recite the whole page of the said book where any thing of the Scrip∣ture is mentioned or spoken of: and begin with his Adversary's objecti∣on against him thus.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Object:</HI> He said that whosoever took a place of Scripture and made a Sermon of it or from it, was a Conjurer, &amp; his preaching was Conjuration.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> He that puts the Letter for the Light, when the Letter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith Christ is the Light, he is blind, John 8.12.

<P><PB N="75" REF="001230_0074_0FB17DB861FA7C80"/>"<HI>Object: Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fox</HI> said the Scripture was Carnal.</P>
<P><HI>Ans:</HI> The Letter of the Scripture is Carnal, and the Letter is Death and killeth, but the Spirit giveth Life, 2 Cor: 3: 6. which was in them that gave forth the scrip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>res, and that I witness which is Eternal &amp; not Carnal; for the <HI>Jews</HI> which had the Letter persecuted Jesus Christ▪ the substance. And so do you now which have the Letter and not the substance: there were Ministers of the Letter then, and Ministers of the Spirit; so there is now.</P></Q>
<P>Observe now Impartial and Candid Reader, here is all in the whole page where any thing of the Scripture is spoken to, and something more of the said <HI>Sauls Errand</HI> verbatim. Have we not cause therefore to say, this <HI>virulent person</HI> is a profuse scribbler, a false accuser, a Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ger o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lies, a Physician of no value. We see here is no such passage, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can the passage be found, we verily believe▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n any book written by any friend of our Society; notwithstanding this Adversary thus abusively lets loose his lavish pen again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t us; Is this the way, as in his Almanack, <HI>January</HI> month 1705, he vainly talks of <HI>to war against Satan transformed,</HI> thus to appear himself, whilst in his work, so grievously <HI>deformed from Truth &amp; honesty?</HI> And now for that he hath taken such liberty from time to time thus lavishly to abuse the living and the dead; he might do well ingeni∣ously to confess his fault, and do so no more, otherwise it's not being a pretended contender for the faith, that will defend him from the por∣tion of a false accuser of the brethren: And now inasmuch as he hath raised against us so many lewd, abusive and false accusations, until he hath as publickly acknowledged as he hath charged them, what credit can be given to him as an Author. However, notwithstanding which, it is our desire and earnest prayer to the Lord, to bring him to a sense of his evil works, and so to preserve us at all times ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Enmity against him, as that we can sincerely say, the Lord forgive him if it be his will,</P>
<P>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, friendly reader, is some of the many lies &amp; s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and'rous abuses to say nothing of the <HI>miscitations, Clipping of sentences, and perverting of our friends writings,</HI> that this D: L: this poor pretended contender for the Christian faith, which works by Love, and for Charity which envieth not, nor v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h it self, is guilty of, concerning all or any of which we do not remember he hath made any reply, except about his quibling about <HI>Josiah Coal,</HI> and of his so very falsly accusing W: P: from page 20 of <HI>San∣dy Foundation,</HI> of calling Christ as man, the finite and impotent Creature
<PB N="76" REF="001230_0075_0FB17DB941C7F2A8"/>
Therefore it's but a poor Evasion in him to say, as he doth in his Alma∣nack <HI>January</HI> month 1705. that it's almost too late in the day <HI>to give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>articular Answers to such stuff.</HI> An idle, tho' confident evasion (as if he had from time to time r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d sufficiently already) for here is produced so plainly against him, such and so much of his own false and abusive stuff unanswered, so short of Christianity, honesty of good neighbourhood, that it must needs lye as an heavy odium upon him in the minds of all our judicious and impartial neighbours or others that may have the know∣ledge of it. Concerning all which, as we said before, we say again, If he shall still persist in this manner of evil work against us, without taking due notice by way of reply to our just defence, which from time to time we have made, or acknowledging his faults as above, we hope we shall be excused, if we do not think our selves oblidg'd so particularly to ans∣wer him as hitherto we have done.</P>
<P>And lastly, that the reader may see, we are willing to give our neigh∣bours, or others what reasonable satisfaction we can, concerning the Truth of what we have here retorted upon D: L: in the above twelve particulars, as also in the <HI>Bombs four quoted charges,</HI> together with the above <HI>Sandy Foundation</HI> and <HI>Josiah Coal's</HI> Book, We have procured the books out of which their quotations are pretended to be taken to be lodged one whole year, commencing the first of the ninth month 1705 at the house of <HI>Ro∣bert Burrow in Chesnut Street in Philadelphia▪</HI> where any person may seasonably and soberly come and view any of the said passages in order to satisfy himself, whether what we have here transcribed out of their books, and our observations on them <HI>be not genuine; as also whether in D: L's &amp; the Bomb's charges or in our answers there remains the falshood.</HI></P>
