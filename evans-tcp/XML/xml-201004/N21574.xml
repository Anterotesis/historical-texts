<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PROVERBS,</HI> xxii. 6.</BIBL>
<P>TRAIN UP A CHILD IN THE WAY HE SHOULD GO: AND WHEN HE IS OLD HE WILL NOT DEPART FROM IT.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>ANY wise and excellent <HI>proverbs</HI> have been established, by men of the most eminent worth and value, as useful and important. Among which, not any have a more just claim to preeminence, than those of the wise and learned <HI>King</HI> of Is∣rael. Perhaps not one, among the great variety to be found in his writings, is more useful and excellent, than that which we have chosen for the <HI>theme</HI> of our discourse.</P>
<P>THIS, above all others, is verified in most in∣stances. It cannot be reasonably expected, that it should be strictly confirmed in every particular in∣stance; as there are but very few, if any, rules, prov∣erbs
<PB N="8" REF="028362_0005_0FD8C6BC8576F8B8"/>
or maxims, but what admit of some few exceptions. In most of the instances where this <HI>proverb,</HI> contained in the <HI>text,</HI> is thought not to prove strictly true, yet if they should be carefully examined, there would be found some defect in not having strictly attended to the <HI>proverb,</HI> rather than in the <HI>proverb</HI> itself, We may, therefore, safely receive this <HI>proverb,</HI> as one of the most general, useful and important proverbs or max∣ims, any where known, either verbally among man∣kind, or upon record.</P>
<P>"TRAIN <HI>up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old he will not depart from it.</HI>"</P>
<P>As this <HI>proverb</HI> is so generally verified, so useful and important, a strict attention to the <HI>exhortation</HI> contained in it, which is, <HI>"Train up a child in the way he should go,"</HI> is of the <HI>highest moment:</HI> for in so doing, the happy consequence, will, according to the <HI>proverb,</HI> naturally follow, which is, <HI>"And when he is old he will not depart from it."</HI></P>
<P>FROM the <HI>Exordium,</HI> the <HI>question</HI> which will af∣ford matter for the sequel of the discourse, naturally ariseth, How or in what manner are CHILDREN to be trained up? Both reason and revelation, are ready to give an <HI>answer.</HI></P>
<P>REASON <HI>answers,</HI> Train up CHILDREN in that way, in which they will make valuable members of a com∣munity; and in that way also, which will secure to them, <HI>joy, peace</HI> and <HI>happiness</HI> of mind as long as they continue to exist. REVELATION is ready to aid and confirm the voice of REASON, by saying, "<HI>And ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the</HI> LORD."</P>
<P>IF CHILDREN, according to the <HI>passage</HI> now cited, are trained up in the nurture &amp; admonition of the LORD, they will become useful ORNAMENTS of society, happy
<PB N="9" REF="028362_0006_0FD8C6BC8837E1C0"/>
in their own minds, and will, beyond the short span of human life, be completely happy in the enjoyment of their CREATOR.</P>
<P>THIS, in various places in the <HI>sacred oracles,</HI> is evidently confirmed. Those that are trained up in the way of true christian virtue, will be adopted as the true <HI>children</HI> of God, such being chosen through Christ, as heirs of a joyful immortality. Unto such, the <HI>Gospel</HI> assures us, <HI>all things,</HI> which God in his consummate wisdom and goodness, sees will best tend to advance their everlasting <HI>peace, joy</HI> and <HI>happiness,</HI> shall be a∣bundantly added.</P>
<P>THIS is the language of the GOSPEL, "<HI>Seek ye first the kingdom of</HI> GOD, <HI>and his righteousness, and all these things shall he added unto you.</HI>"</P>
<P>THAT this most happy <HI>consequence,</HI> resulting from training up <HI>children</HI> in the way they should go, might take place, they must, while buding to bloom in youth, be properly educated.</P>
<P>THE education of children, is an interesting con∣cern, to all those that are possessed of sentiments of love and compassion for them; as also to all such as have any regard for the well being of mankind, especially of the inhabitants of the <HI>community,</HI> to which they belong.</P>
<P>THE peace and happiness of <HI>children</HI> in the future periods of their existence, and likewise of their place of residence, as also of mankind in general, eminently de∣pend upon their being rightly educated.</P>
<P>IF their education should be neglected, they will step forth upon the <HI>stage</HI> of action, ignorant, rude and barbarous, unfit rightly to serve and worship their CRE∣ATOR; and likewise unqualified for the company of the polished and well informed part of mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="028362_0007_0FD8C6C0A757AF90"/>SHOULD, therefore, the education of children be∣come generally neglected, superstition, misery and de∣struction, would inevitably be the awful consequences. Intellectual pleasures, or those of a mind refined by ce∣lestial virtue, and illuminated by the emanating rays of divine love, could then never be experienced in all their purifying and pleasurable effects. But few other joys and pleasures, would be known, but those which are sensual, proceeding from hearts defiled, like contami∣nated streams, issuing from impure fountains. Victo∣ry and triumph, would consist, as they now do among the <HI>savages of the wilderness;</HI> while the honor of ob∣taining a victory over ther own passions would be un∣known, and the joys of a happy triumph over the <HI>pow∣ers of darkness</HI> never possess their hearts. Their virtue and morality, would be none other, than that which was conformable, however ridiculous, to the place in which they had been trained up. Such are the deplor∣able consequences of ignorance, every one will readily acknowledge, who has but superficially examined the history of mankind; and but with indifference, sur∣veyed the great variety of practices and customs of some of the many states, kingdoms and nations of the earth. By such, it will be acknowledged, that those <HI>actions</HI> or <HI>practices,</HI> which, in some places among the ignorant and unpolished, are esteemed as virtuous and honorable, are indeed ridiculous and impious; and which, among the truly virtuous and well informed, would be thus es∣teemed. According, therefore, as children are educa∣ted, will be their <HI>notions, ideas</HI> and <HI>practices,</HI> when they shall have come forth upon the theatre of time. Truly is the <HI>proverb</HI> contained in the <HI>text,</HI> verified,— <HI>"Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old he will not depart from it."</HI></P>
<P>BY contrasting <HI>ignorance</HI> with <HI>knowledge,</HI> it will still be thought to have a more glaring and odious ap∣pearance. Innumerable are the happy consequences resulting from a general diffusion of useful knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="028362_0008_0FD8C6C1C68F8120"/>THOSE that have early had their minds refined by a good education, can rise, upon the wings of science, far above the sordid pleasures of the ignorant and un∣polished. With their aspiring minds, they can soar on high, even from <HI>earth</HI> to <HI>heaven,</HI> and from <HI>pole</HI> to <HI>pole,</HI> contemplating with exquisite delight, the majes∣tic works of creation and the beauties of nature, which, with pleasing astonishment, every where strike the en∣lightened mind.</P>
<P>LEARNING not only capacitates the mind for scan∣ning with pleasure the works and beauties of creation: but renders it a fit recipient and a proper repository of consistent ideas of God, the great Creator and Up∣holder of all things.</P>
<P>THOSE minds, which remain deformed by <HI>igno∣rance,</HI> have very inconsistent ideas of God, his per∣fections natural and moral, and of his dealings with his intelligent creatures. To the truth of this assertion, both history and our own observations, will bear testi∣mony.</P>
<P>KNOWLEDGE obtained from useful <HI>learning,</HI> im∣prints on the mind many important ideas; prepares, if rightly improved, those, whose minds are thus ex∣panded, to act their parts right and well in the world; and to them, points out the <HI>way,</HI> that leads to the happy abodes of the blessed, where fountains of knowl∣edge, springs of peace, rivers of pleasure and streams of joy, in one incessant prospect for ever rise, making glad the hearts of the <HI>myriads</HI> of its <HI>elysian</HI> inhabitants. It is knowledge, which teaches us to assert the sover∣eignty of our nature; and to assume that <HI>dignity</HI> in the scale of being, for which we were created.</P>
<P>THOUSANDS of utilities, elegancies, joys and pleasures, owe their birth and being to it, without which, existence itself would be but an insipid enjoy∣ment.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="028362_0009_0FD8C6C888B22688"/>SUCH are the happy consequences, privileges and advantages; which wholly depend upon the right <HI>education</HI> of children.</P>
<P>THE real worth or superiority of mankind, above the beasts of the forest, appear only, by rightly culti∣vating, replenishing and polishing their minds, with <HI>knowledge</HI> received from learning's source.</P>
<P>LEARNING or education, does for the mind, the same that the polishing hand of the artist that works on rich and precious GEMS, does to ONE taken from the earth, as it there laid in its hidden recesses.</P>
<P>THE <HI>mind</HI> originally, as in children upon their entrance into the world, is destitute of all ideas, ex∣cepting such as they immediately receive from sensa∣tion.</P>
<P>THE mind or understanding, seems not to have any original ideas imprinted on it, but appears rather to be destitute of the least glimmering of all innate knowledge.</P>
<P>"A CAREFUL examination of the minds of young children, <HI>says a learned and ingenious Writer,</HI> will sufficiently convince us, that they bring not many o∣riginal ideas into the world with them."</P>
<P>IF there were any original ideas in the <HI>mind,</HI> which in its first being it receives, those ideas most certainly would be universally known, and acknowledged by all mankind as incontestible truths; which we suffi∣ciently know has never been the case, even with res∣pect to the most self evident propositions and necessary existences.</P>
<P>THIS, therefore, is sufficient to convince us, that the <HI>mind</HI> originally is similar to white paper, being void of all innate characters.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="028362_0010_0FD8C6C9E45AC728"/>AS God has neither made nor done any thing in vain, it would be impertinent to suppose that the <HI>mind</HI> had any ideas or characters engraven on it in its first existence: for as we are endowed with such noble powers and faculties by which we are capacitated, to obtain all the ideas necessary for us to have, to sup∣pose this, would be to suppose a superfluous operation of the divine agency.</P>
<P>IT is therefore, only by improvement, and that by degrees, that the mind comes to be stored with any <HI>fund</HI> of useful knowledge. At first, the senses let into the mind, particular ideas, called the ideas of sensa∣tion. After which, the mind, begins to exercise its own powers, by abstracting and compounding the ideas it received from sensation; and by a certain progres∣sion, learns for each of its ideas both simple and com∣plex, particular and general names with their use and design. The ideas received from the perception of the operations of the <HI>mind,</HI> are the ideas of reflection; which operations are the source, from which proceeds all our useful knowledge, respecting virtue and mo∣rality, in which is included our duty both towards God and man, as well as our joy, peace and happiness. This is the <HI>way</HI> or <HI>manner,</HI> in which the <HI>mind</HI> is fur∣nished with ideas and the use of language; and by which it is enabled to exercise its discursive faculties. It, therefore, eminently depends upon the right edu∣cation of children, respecting their future prosperity, knowledge and usefulness in the world. It is educa∣tion, which raises one above another in real worth and merit.</P>
<P>THE divine portion of genius is diffused among the rich and the poor, the high and the low; and requires only the polishing hand of education, to make it shine <HI>in each</HI> with distinguished lustre.</P>
<P>THE great disparity among mankind, arises not so much from the want of gifts, as from the want of a
<PB N="14" REF="028362_0011_0FD8C6CE8E5841A8"/>
proper education. Among crouds of the untutored, real evidences of a bright genius, may often plainly be discovered. Many of those, who traverse America's deserts, to whom no other joys and pleasures are known, "but the chase and the pipe"—have as great if not greater natural abilities, than those, who among the civilized, fill distinguished stations of usefulness and honor.</P>
<P>"MAN, by nature, <HI>says</HI> ONE, is like a piece of marble just taken from the quarry; and 'tis education which gives the use, the form and the polish."</P>
<P>MANY of those, who have been raised to dignified stations of honor and usefulness, have been taken from the most humble situations in the world, and advanced to them, by means of their education with great dig∣nity and reputation. A striking instance of this, we have in the life of MOSES. Reflect a moment,—"How great the contrast between <HI>Moses</HI> in the marshy weeds," and MOSES the Commander of the people and <HI>armies</HI> of the GOD of hosts! Behold <HI>him</HI> at one time in an <HI>Ark</HI> of bulrushes, floating upon the river Nile; and at a∣nother as a most noble Commander under the supreme KING of <HI>kings,</HI> standing upon the banks of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> safely conducting the chosen of the Lord, through the paths of the watery element! Whence, therefore, may the question be justly asked, was this strange sur∣prizing reverse of fortune? Was it wholly owing to his being taken from the <HI>Ark</HI> of bulrushes, upon the banks of a dangerous river? No! For notwithstanding he was thus saved from the very jaws of death; yet his eminence and worth, are to be attributed to some great∣er CAUSE. It was his education, under the superin∣tending providence of God, which prepared him to be such a pattern of meekness; such a blessing to the chosen of the Lord; and to commence the performer of such a scene of wonders, as "must astonish the world to the latest ages." Had it not been for his ed∣ucation, his genius and latent seeds of meekness and
<PB N="15" REF="028362_0012_0FD8C6CFEAAFAC60"/>
virtue, together with his great usefulness to generations gone, to the present and to those that are yet to come, would, like a lump of unwrought gold, never have ap∣peared according to their true value; but would have been concealed by the impenetrable shades of igno∣rance.</P>
<P>PHARAOH'S daughter is worthy of a high eulogium, for her kind assistance to <HI>Moses,</HI> a poor forsaken child; for snatching him from a watery grave; and for what is yet greater, providing him with the means of educa∣tion. "As soon as his age and capacity would admit, <HI>says a celebrated</HI> DIVINE, he was sent to school, where under the most improved instructors, he made uncom∣mon proficiency in his studies." "<HI>He was learned,</HI> saith an inspired WRITER, <HI>in all the wisdom of the E∣gyptians, and was mighty in words and deeds.</HI>"</P>
<P>BY educating this child, O <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Called so by Josephus.</NOTE> Thermutis! thou didst perform great service to mankind; <HI>and didst heap upon</HI> thyself exalted encomlums. This benevolent act, gave thee more joy, than all the gay pleasures of a splendid life; added more charms to thy person than sparkling eyes, blushing cheeks, and curling trusses.</P>
<P>THE supreme glory, shall be ascribed to God, while blooming flowers shall be scatter'd in the paths, in which, O Thermutis! thou walkest with thy maid∣ens down to the River, from which thou didst draw <HI>Mo∣ses,</HI> the son of a slave.</P>
<P>SINCE such wonderous acts are performed, and such great good accrues to mankind, by the means of education, it is of the utmost importance to cultivate by learning, those latent sparks of genius in the minds of children, that they may be rightly employed for their own advantage, and for the benefit of society.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="028362_0013_0FD8BD73521F8AA8"/>THE more that true knowledge is diffused, the more will true peace and happiness be enjoyed; the more safe will be the rights and liberties of each indi∣vidual; and the more likely will be the holy religion of the blessed <HI>Redeemer</HI> to prevail and flourish.</P>
<P>A GENERAL diffusion of useful knowledge, will have a happy tendency to make the inhabitants of the world, as are the citizens of America enlightened and free; to prevent the ambitious and designing from u∣surping either political or ecclesiastical tyranny; and to qualify a people to be happy subjects and virtuous rulers.</P>
<P>"TYRANNY, bigotry and superstition, <HI>says</HI> ONE, are supported only by gloomy ignorance." "These, whenever the divine ray of knowledge shall illume the benighted parts of the earth, will flee, like Satan," "with the shades of the night."</P>
<P>IN this Country, where liberty is the basis of its government, where birth and riches give no preem∣inence; "and where merit alone has the surest claim" to distinction, there are but very few, who may not be so trained up or educated, as to be qualified to fill <HI>with reputation</HI> the highest places of honor and trust; or at the least, to make honest, useful and peaceable citizens. If therefore, CHILDREN are trained up in the way they should go, when they shall have arisen to years of maturity, they will not depart from it; but in it with pleasure will delight to walk.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>FROM what has been said upon this subject, we may infer, that it is the indispensible duty of parents, to rightly train up or educate their children in <HI>that way,</HI> in which they should go when they are old.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="028362_0014_0FD8C6D671262F10"/>AS children come into the world destitute of ideas, as we have shown, they ought early to be furnished with the means of education, that their young and ten∣der minds, which can easily be moulded into any form, might be replenished with suitable &amp; necessary knowl∣edge. It is, therefore, dangerous to defer the edu∣cation of children till they shall have imbibed certain sentiments, notions and ideas, which, however <HI>ridicu∣lous</HI> and <HI>absurd,</HI> they will never renounce.</P>
<P>MANY parents really injure their children by not giving them a proper education for the calling, in which it is probable they will follow, at as early a period of life, as would have been consistent with their capacities for learning and improvement.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING a very considerable knowledge of the arts and sciences, may, at an advanced age of life be obtained; yet it has been remarked and that very justly, that most of such persons will be contracted in their views and sentiments, practicably infallible and self conceited, and illiberal and uncharitable in most of their proceedings. They are commonly destitute of all delicate impressions, their hearts being as hard as the adamantine rock. If such persons sustain a religious character or act in a sacred profession, they will impute all their inconsistencies to the sacred spirit of God, or perhaps for a conscientious zeal for his glory. By their blind, absurd and infatuated zeal, together with their pretended orthodoxy, they essentially injure the cause of true religion, which they have been endeavouring to support. The opinions or sentiments of such, can by reason no more be altered, than thunder clouds can be turned, or the everlasting hills be moved by the voice or strength of man. Nothing but fear, shame and punishment, withhold them from imitating the deluded followers of the <HI>Eastern Impostor,</HI> in unsheathing the SWORD of JEHOVAH, and pointing it at the breasts of those, who fall not in with their fanatical notions
<PB N="18" REF="028362_0015_0FD8C6D76CCF9690"/>
and persecuting principles. Such, <HI>my friends,</HI> are the natural and dreadful consequences, of neglecting the early and proper education of children.</P>
<P>SUFFER me, therefore, ye PARENTS <HI>present,</HI> to di∣rect a few words of <HI>address</HI> to you, upon this important and interesting concern.</P>
<P>PERMIT <HI>one, my friends,</HI> who experimentally knows not the joys, fears and anxieties of a parent, to intreat you for your own honor, and for what is yet far greater, for the future prosperity of your children, to give to them as good an education as you can consistently with your several abilities. The future characters and conduct of your children, yea, their everlasting happi∣ness in an eminent sense, depend upon the education they shall receive from you. You can perform no greater kindness, and manifest no greater parental affection for <HI>them,</HI> than by giving <HI>them</HI> an opportunity to obtain a useful and valuable education. In this <HI>way,</HI> you will probably prevent their own misery and ruin; and at the same time perform an essential service to mankind. To thus assist them, is far more commendable, than it is to bestow on them riches and hereditary honors. By so doing, you will prepare them for usefulness in the world, for honor and happiness, and for a proper man∣agement of themselves, when they shall appear upon the stage of action, to take a part in life's great DRAMA.</P>
<P>MANY a bright genius, have spent their days in the low and humble walks of life, for the want of hav∣ing their minds improved by education; and finally have gone down to the grave, without ever appearing to advantage in the world. Hearken to the language of a celebrated POET, after contemplating, <HI>in a bury∣ing yard,</HI> the <HI>monuments</HI> erected to the memory of the <HI>dead:</HI>—
<Q><LG>
<L>"Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid</L>
<L>"Some heart once pregnant with eclestial fire;</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="028362_0016_0FD8C6D9A5BEB458"/>"Hands that the rod of <HI>EMPIRE</HI> might have sway'd,</L>
<L>"Or wak'd to exstacy the living lyre.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"But knowledge to their eyes her ample page,</L>
<L>"Rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll;</L>
<L>"Chill penury repress'd their noble rage,</L>
<L>"And froze the genial current of the soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Full many a gem of purest ray serene,</L>
<L>"The dark unfathom'd caves of <HI>OCEAN</HI> bear;</L>
<L>"Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,</L>
<L>"And waste its sweetness in the desart air."</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>SUFFICIENT has been said to persuade you, <HI>my friends,</HI> not to neglect the early and proper education of your children. In educating them, you will aim to have them instructed in heavenly knowledge.</P>
<P>A FEW words, in addition to what has been said, respecting their <HI>spiritual</HI> instruction, will not be con∣sidered as unnecessary.</P>
<P>AS long as they are under your particular care and direction, you will, like the pious and most amiable PARENT, the AUTHOR of the text, be frequently cal∣ling upon them to obtain heavenly knowledge; and with all their getting to get a wise and understanding heart. Guard as much as possible, against their em∣bracing such religious sentiments, as are dishonorary to God, or inconsistent with that benevolent character, in which he is clothed both in the BOOK of reason and revelation. In a particular manner, guard against their being enthusiastical in religion; against their minds being absorbed in a <HI>system,</HI> which literally shuts the gate of mercy upon most of the human race.</P>
<P>NEVER become guilty of instructing, yea nor even countenancing them in embracing such religious sen∣timents,
<PB N="20" REF="028362_0017_0FD8C6DEB84C9130"/>
as involve in them such palpable absurdities, as neither <HI>Angels, Man</HI> nor <HI>Devils,</HI> can ever make to appear plausible to a rational and unprejudiced mind. Always endeavor to represent God to them, in the most amiable, endearing and benevolent character; that they may love, not servilely fear and dread HIM, as some awful, horrible and most powerful TYRANT, de∣lighting in damnation and misery. With the pious ELDER of old, may you say, <HI>"I have no greater joy, than to hear that my children walk in the truth."</HI></P>
<P>MAY you have the happiness to see your <HI>children,</HI> increase in learning; preparing to shine as distinguish∣ed LIGHTS in the world, and to behold THEM walking in <HI>that path,</HI> which leads to the heavenly mansions in glory, where there is <HI>knowledge</HI> to be obtained beyond finite conception, and peace, joys and pleasures be∣yond expression.</P>
<P>THE youth of this <HI>congregation,</HI> particularly those that have attended my instructions, shall next claim particular attention in the sequel of the <HI>subject.</HI></P>
<P>MY YOUNG FRIENDS,</P>
<P>YOU have heard in this <HI>discourse,</HI> that your future honor, usefulness and happiness, depend eminently on your education. You will, therefore, while in the morning of your <HI>days,</HI> prepare yourselves by your ed∣ucation, for honor among mankind, usefulness to the world, and profit to yourselves, when the <HI>voices</HI> of your parents can no more be heard, nor their <HI>hands</HI> be stretched out no longer for your assistance. If it is the duty of your <HI>parents</HI> to instruct you, and to pro∣vide for you the means of education, it is then your indispensible duty, to hearken to all their faithful and benevolent admonitions, precepts and instructions; and gratefully to improve every <HI>opportunity,</HI> which they may afford you for obtaining useful knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="028362_0018_0FD8C6E0622516C0"/>NOW is the best and only time for the proper im∣provement and cultivation of your minds. Be intreat∣ed then, to attend diligently to all the means of in∣struction, with which your PARENTS in <HI>love</HI> may fa∣vor you.</P>
<P>BUT above all, you must seek to obtain the knowl∣edge of God; and of his Son Jesus Christ, and the way of Salvation through HIM, as it is revealed in the <HI>Gospel.</HI> To this END, you will faithfully attend to the instructions of pious PARENTS and TEACHERS. Heavenly knowledge, is highly recommended to your <HI>choice</HI> in repeated instances by the wise, virtuous and learned <HI>Preacher</HI> of Israel. This is his language:—</P>
<P>"MY <HI>Son, hear the instruction of thy</HI> FATHER, <HI>and forsake not the law of thy</HI> MOTHER: <HI>For they shall be an</HI> ornament of grace <HI>unto thy head, and</HI> chains <HI>about</HI> thy neck." "<HI>Hear ye children the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding. For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law. For I was my</HI> FATHER'S <HI>son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my</HI> MOTHER." My <HI>Father</HI> taught me, and my <HI>Mother</HI> frequently instructed me—<HI>"And said un∣to me, let thine heart retain my words; keep my com∣mandments and live." "Take fast hold of</HI> instruction; <HI>let</HI> her <HI>not go; keep</HI> her; <HI>for</HI> she <HI>is thy life." "Re∣ceive my</HI> instruction, <HI>and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. For</HI> wisdom <HI>is better than ru∣bies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to"</HI> her. Many more passages might be easily cited, <HI>were it necessary,</HI> in which wisdom and instruction are highly recommended to the choice of Youth.</P>
<P>AMONG the great variety you shall only once more be refered to the <HI>story</HI> of the wise <HI>Preacher's</HI> choice, when God in the days of his youth, thus addressed <HI>him, "Ask what I shall give thee."</HI> His choice, <HI>my

young friends,</HI> teaches <HI>you</HI> that wisdom or a wise and understanding heart, is to be chosen and prefered as far more valuable than all earthly honors, riches and pleasures. While <HI>health, riches</HI> and victory, were spreading their alluring charms before the <HI>young Mon∣arch,</HI> recommending themselves to his choice, when <HI>wisdom</HI> appeared, it was with her alone, with which he was captivated. While it is an accepted time, be persuaded to imitate <HI>Solomon</HI> in his choice; and like him, may you be wise to know the God of your fath∣ers, and to serve HIM with a perfect heart and willing mind. Your youthful days are fleeting fast; and will soon be gone. Expiring time will soon scatter hoary hairs among the most beautiful locks; "draw furrows on the smoothest brow; and blast the roses on the finest cheek." Those, therefore, who, AFTER <HI>their youth∣ful and vigorous</HI> days are past, would appear amiable and beautiful, must have their <HI>minds</HI> adorned with heavenly wisdom, and their <HI>hearts</HI> replenished with the graces of the divine SPIRIT. May you be continually abounding in true knowledge and wisdom; in true pi∣ety and virtue; and in every good word and work. When done with time, may you be admitted to the full fruition of the joys and pleasures of heaven; where you will ever be increasing in knowledge; flourishing in <HI>immortal youth;</HI> and glowing with crowns and di∣adems of dazling beauty, through the rolling and ceas∣less <HI>ages</HI> of <HI>Eternity.</HI></P>
<P>IN a word, to comprehend, "THE ONE THING NEEDFUL," which involves in it, <HI>knowledge</HI> the most important, as well as all riches, honors and pleasures, is to have a <HI>spiritual knowledge</HI> of HIM, whom to know aright is <HI>Life eternal.</HI></P>
<P>TO conclude therefore; May we all both young and old, be trained up for everlasting life; and when through <HI>death's</HI> dark <HI>vault</HI> we shall have passed, may we

through faith in the merits of the REDEEMER, be admit∣ted to the delightful participation of the perfectly bles∣sed in glory.</P>
