<HEAD>THE CRISIS. NUMBER XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Casca's Epistle to Lord NORTH.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>—<HI>Ita digerit omnia Coelehas.</HI></L>
<BIBL>Virgil.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><L>If sad Britannia wails, in deep distress,</L>
<L>Her taxes greater and her freedom less:</L>
<L>She owes these grievances to Bute's vile tribe,</L>
<L>North's dissolution, and a treas'ry bribe.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LG>
<L>TO you my lord, these honest lines I send;</L>
<L>To you the sov'reign's not the people's friend</L>
<L>The sov'reign's friend? yes, when I think again,</L>
<L>A friend like Wolsey in a Harry's reign.</L>
<L>Harry, who gave his royal lusts full scope;</L>
<L>Commenc'd a devil and renounc'd the pope.</L>
<L>In Bute and North two devils make us groan,</L>
<L>And at Quebec the pope resumes his throne.</L>
<L>Harry's despotic frowns o'er cast us now;</L>
<L>Fate hangs on Bute's proud will and George's brow.</L>
<L>Below, North represents absconding Bute,</L>
<L>Above, a Nation dyes by Roy le veut.</L>
<L>Proud of North's name corruption wears no veil;</L>
<L>At North's soft bribe, no senator turns pale.</L>
<L>Shrew'd Walpole never went your lordship's length;</L>
<L>But boldness with supplies has gather'd strength.</L>
<L><PB N="150" REF="013984_0002_0F92599A17ED7918"/>
Safe from impeachments in this venal time,</L>
<L>Each parricide may triumph in his crime.</L>
<L>Knaves in your lordship's numbers put their hope;</L>
<L>Lords fear no ax, and commoners no rope,</L>
<L>Virtue's fair dawn you've clouded with a sum;</L>
<L>And check'd her test for seven years to come.</L>
<L>Association is a dreadful sound;</L>
<L>And Bute must dye if virtue is not bound.</L>
<L>Shou'd tests ensue; impeachments wou'd take place,</L>
<L>And old St. Stephen wear an honest face.</L>
<L>What must be done?—"dissolve, cries Bute in fits:</L>
<L>"Dissolve—and stab your country with new writs."</L>
<L>He spoke, and North obedient to his voice,</L>
<L>With gold prepar'd his boroughs for their choice.</L>
<L>Appriz'd his members of the dex'trous cheat,</L>
<L>And plac'd corruption in her former seat.</L>
<L>Crouching she licks the hand by which she's fed,</L>
<L>And joys to see Sir Fletcher at her head;</L>
<L>To see North ape Bute's dictatorial nod,</L>
<L>For George deserts his country and his God.</L>
<L>To see her sons alert when North commands,</L>
<L>And at his beck lift up four hundred hands.</L>
<L>But whence this mighty influence? whence this pow'r?</L>
<L>All virtue's delug'd in a golden show'r.</L>
<L>A treas'ry storm what virtue can resist?</L>
<L>Ev'n George to drown her, dips his civil list.</L>
<L>With thirst hydropic all North's patriots drink,</L>
<L>And half a million scarce will make 'em sink.</L>
<L>From craving more no decency restrains,</L>
<L>At once they poison and exhaust our veins.</L>
<L>Let those, who feel the civil list decrease,</L>
<L>Call on Mountstewart to restore his fleece.</L>
<L>Father and son are equally a curse:</L>
<L>One dupes the sov'reign, and one drains the purse.</L>
<L><PB N="151" REF="013984_0003_0F92599ACA916608"/>
In baubles and douceurs what treasures fly?</L>
<L>How are the people plunder'd to supply!</L>
<L>Elegance lavish'd on a Scot is vain,</L>
<L>A hovel might content an embryo thane.</L>
<L>His ancestors (this truth is wormwood now,)</L>
<L>Whose hut contain'd their wife, their bairns, &amp; cow,</L>
<L>Thought e'er their union taught their pride to feel,</L>
<L><HI>A Pounde in Siller was a muckle deale.</HI></L>
<L>But since Scots felt the blessings of that law,</L>
<L>Which laid their Thanes on down instead of straw,</L>
<L>Bless'd them with commerce, arts, and all their fruits,</L>
<L>And bade them herd no longer with their brutes;</L>
<L>By culture humaniz'd their savage mind,</L>
<L>And plac'd them on a footing with mankind;</L>
<L>Their haughty sons who else had fed on grass,</L>
<L>Or filch'd for hunger, thistles from their ass,</L>
<L>Shiv'ring on mountains desolate and cold,</L>
<L>Strangers alike to luxury and gold.</L>
<L>Forgetting, like their sires, want's bitter sting,</L>
<L>Disdain the palace of an English King;</L>
<L>Demand superb additions, vast expence,</L>
<L>To fit it for a lordlings residence.</L>
<L>O! shame! where art thou fled!—ye Briton rise?</L>
<L>Is it for Bute's proud race you grant supplies?</L>
<L>With just resentment bid Mountstewart fly,</L>
<L>And feed his pride beneath his father's sky;</L>
<L>There pinch on rocks where barren nature sleeps;</L>
<L>Yes—scourge him back to his paternal nieps.</L>
<L>Weak sov'reigns, thus their artful minions bless;</L>
<L>Ask what they dare their constant answer's yes.</L>
<L>When injur'd subjects with petitions go,</L>
<L>The sov'reign, low'ring, looks an haughty no.</L>
<L><PB N="152" REF="013984_0004_0F92599BBAC16D78"/>
Yet if his kingship wants a fresh supply,</L>
<L>Below—aye, aye,—above, contents the cry.</L>
<L>Petitioners with rebels are involv'd;</L>
<L>Let Bute but hint—the parliament's dissolv'd.</L>
<L>This influence Beckford labour'd to resist;</L>
<L>Corruption, was maintain'd, and he dismiss'd.</L>
<L>Cities petition, yet their plague endures;</L>
<L>But virtue's rage quick dissolution cures.</L>
<L>Say (for you know, my lord) the cause of this,</L>
<L>You know who counsels and who acts amiss.</L>
<L>Disguise no truth by specious, trite harangue;</L>
<L>But say, at once your parliament's a gang.</L>
<L>If truth's a crime, and George's frown you dread,</L>
<L>Say in a whisper who is at their head?</L>
<L>That question's home—your lordship's filent still—</L>
<L>I'll answer it myself then—frown who will.</L>
<L>In ancient days when simple monarchs saw</L>
<L>No better means by reigning than by law,</L>
<L>When sages counsell'd with an honest heart.</L>
<L>And kings religiously perform'd their part;</L>
<L>E'er standing armies were a standing curse,</L>
<L>Subjects were children, and their king a nurse;</L>
<L>No suitor unredress'd then left the throne;</L>
<L>The nurse's interest and the child's were one.</L>
<L>The three estates then us'd to coalesce,</L>
<L>With no intention but to save and bless.</L>
<L>Now kings, lords, and commons faithfully agree,</L>
<L>Like a banditti in confed'racy.</L>
<L>Combin'd to plunge a nation in distress,</L>
<L>To double grievances without redress.</L>
<L>In vain to George the suppliant knee is bent;</L>
<L>He enjoins silence, suff'ring and content.</L>
<L>With sullen gloom he arms his sulky brow,</L>
<L>And tells us slav'ry is our charter now,</L>
<L><PB N="153" REF="013984_0005_0F92599C5528D308"/>
Astonish'd at his city's daring cries,</L>
<L>He tells 'em kings and parliaments are wise.</L>
<L>Tells 'em their constitution is controul;</L>
<L>That of all trades oppression is the soul;</L>
<L>That their protection hangs on royal breath;</L>
<L>To day 'tis slav'ry and to-morrow death.</L>
<L>That all are rebels, but that passive tribe,</L>
<L>Who kiss his chains, his footstool and his bribe.</L>
<L>That ev'ry subject's traiterous in his view,</L>
<L>Who dares petition, meet, consult or sue.</L>
<L>These sentiments are Bute's by Mansfield penn'd;</L>
<L>Mansfield who tells us he is virtue's friend.</L>
<L>This doctrine good my lord, full scope affords,</L>
<L>To your vile commons and your supple lords.</L>
<L>Since ev'ry act brings forth some grievance new,</L>
<L>Enlarge the narrow bounds of treason too.</L>
<L>Like Mary' Minion in her tyrant reign,</L>
<L>Enlarge old Edward's act amend, explain,</L>
<L>Shew Edward's sages they mistook the case;</L>
<L>Declare new treasons—'tis an act of grace.</L>
<L>Declare it treason but to wish success</L>
<L>To freedom's arms, or supplicate redress;</L>
<L>Work your new doctor's insult into fact;</L>
<L>'Tis Johnson's thought, so call it Johnson's act.</L>
<L>Go farther still, and stop the teeming press;</L>
<L>If wishing's treason, writing is no less.</L>
<L>Safe in your votes, corruption now invites:</L>
<L>This is your time—lop off the hand that writes.</L>
<L>By libels full of truth, your Mansfield bleeds,</L>
<L>And Bute still dreads impeachment's swelling seeds.</L>
<L>Preserve your sov'reign in tyrannic health;</L>
<L>Nor let him read the CRISIS but by stealth.</L>
<L>No quarter to that whiggish Crisis give;</L>
<L>Aut let the Tory patriot's falsehoods live.</L>
<L><PB N="154" REF="013984_0006_0F92599D4916D3F8"/>
Let Johnson's sheets attrack the monarch's eye;</L>
<L>There he may see how knaves well paid can lye.</L>
<L>In Johnson's tenets let him read his own,</L>
<L>That kings are born to laugh whilst subjects groan;</L>
<L>That pow'r is their's in supplication's spite;</L>
<L>Whatever they and heav'n inflict, is right.</L>
<L>When kings for wanton slaughter give the word,</L>
<L>Subjects are bound to fall upon their sword.</L>
<L>When kings by famine choose their slaves shou'd die;</L>
<L>Those slaves must drop without an asking eye.</L>
<L>So much for life—to claim our own is vain:</L>
<L>Like Montesquieu they fancy who complain.</L>
<L>What has a slave? nor fire, nor cloaths, nor meat;</L>
<L>Not for themselves they're warm'd, or cloath'd, or eat;</L>
<L>But to desend their master in his pride;</L>
<L>Their sov'reign; who may tax their very hide.</L>
<L>Flay off their skin in wantonness and sport,</L>
<L>Or send an order for their heads from court.</L>
<L>Shou'd freedom's odious form presume to rise,</L>
<L>North makes a motion, and the phantom flies.</L>
<L>Mansfield and Bute the murd'rous bill invent.</L>
<L>North brings it in—'tis pass'd—and gains assent.</L>
<L>No tax, no pain, no penalty's too much;</L>
<L>All are thrice hallow'd by the scepter's touch.</L>
<L>Thus by no tyranny the slave's oppress'd;</L>
<L>The means are sacred, and the end is bless'd.</L>
<L>He's the best subject who most prostrate lies,</L>
<L>He's the true patriot who submits and dies.</L>
<L>Thus Johnson writes: at court his works have praise;</L>
<L>No resolution whims in George's days!</L>
<L>Thus frantic savages present their breast,</L>
<L>To pointed lightnings, with false zeal possess'd;</L>
<L><PB N="155" REF="013984_0007_0F92599DD05CE760"/>
Behold th' enthusiasts all Jove's rage invoke;</L>
<L>And he's the happiest who receives the stroke.</L>
<L>O mighty king! wise council! righteous throne!</L>
<L>Where freedom, property, nor life's our own.</L>
<L>Briton's adore this sun, that gilds your days,</L>
<L>Surround St. James's with new songs of praise.</L>
<L>Let Wilkes no more, like Beckford's ghost, arise,</L>
<L>And with petitions fear his sov'reign's eyes,</L>
<L>For wrong'd America, let pity cease,</L>
<L>Let all her sons be massacr'd in peace.</L>
<L>Those minds, says George, which sympathy can stir,</L>
<L>In blackest treason with his foes concurr.</L>
<L>Those are his foes; Bute's, North's, and Mansfield's too,</L>
<L>Who of their actions take too near a view.</L>
<L>Demand the cause why sword or famine drinks</L>
<L>Bostonian blood?—Cries Johnson, Boston thinks;</L>
<L>Thinks as her cursed ancestors were us'd,</L>
<L>By whom our martyr Charles was so abus'd.</L>
<L>O glorious martydom! henceforth appear,</L>
<L>The joyous feast of ev'ry future year.</L>
<L>Blest be those shades! who taught our kings to dread,</L>
<L>No loss of honour like a loss of head!</L>
<L>'Tis that alone, my lord, that can restrain</L>
<L>Kings and their minions in a tyrant reign.</L>
<L>The good or ill their ministers may do,</L>
<L>Arises always from the point in view.</L>
<L>Their darling aim gives life to their designs;</L>
<L>Now vacates patents, and now watches mines.</L>
<L>To day supplants a Bentick in his right,</L>
<L>And backs mean Lowther in a legal fight;</L>
<L>The board of customs by direction meet</L>
<L>To-morrow, and pronounce Sir James a cheat.</L>
<L><PB N="156" REF="013984_0008_0F92599F08E61768"/>
For why? of late Sir James too restive draws;</L>
<L>To scourge him North pretends a public cause.</L>
<L>Now for Sir James, in patents picking holes,</L>
<L>And now against him for his frauds in coals.</L>
<L>Thus we discern the justice of the state;</L>
<L>That kings and ministers breathe life or fate:</L>
<L>Petitions as rebellious are withstood,</L>
<L>Whilst spleen is gratify'd for public good.</L>
<L>Beware the goal, my lord, nor drive too high;</L>
<L>Kings dare be tyrants, but they durst not die.</L>
<L>'Tis a nice conduct that can steer between</L>
<L>King's lusts, mens rights, and ills that intervene.</L>
<L>When godlike kings (like Alfred) give assent</L>
<L>To all that can relieve, assist, content;</L>
<L>When justice by the royal touch gains force,</L>
<L>And virtue is supported in her course;</L>
<L>When regal power is for a blessing us'd,</L>
<L>And mercy like the beams of heaven diffus'd;</L>
<L>Then righteousness and truth surround the throne,</L>
<L>Then kings are ministers that heav'n may own.</L>
<L>By day their presence gives all hearts delight,</L>
<L>And ev'ry subject is their guard by night.</L>
<L>But when inflate with pride they ape the god;</L>
<L>Affect to damp addresses with a nod;</L>
<L>Check and o'er bear the humble suitor's claim,</L>
<L>And give to liberty, vile treason's name:</L>
<L>When in their face and words the tyrant's reigns,</L>
<L>And free born subjects must receive their chains;</L>
<L>When you, my lord, behold this daring scene,</L>
<L>With caution steer your little bark between</L>
<L>The sov'reign's and the subject's side;</L>
<L>On a rough sea behold each vessel ride,</L>
<L>This mann'd by freedom, that by tyrant pride.</L>
